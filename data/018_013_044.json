    "message_2": "First, we need to find the Cartesian product AxB. AxB is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nAxB = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, we can find (AxB)∪C, which is the union of the sets AxB and C. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either set.\n\n(AxB)∪C = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 3, 5}\n\nFor the second part of the problem, AxB∪C, it seems there is a typo or misunderstanding in the notation. The correct notation should be (A∪C)xB, which means the Cartesian product of the union of sets A and C with set B.\n\nFirst, we find the union of sets A and C:\n\nA∪C = {1, 2, 3, 5}\n\nNow, we can find the Cartesian product (A∪C)xB:\n\n(A∪C)xB = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4)}\n\nSo, (AxB)∪C = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 3, 5} and (A∪C)xB = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4)}."
