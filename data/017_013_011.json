    "message_2": "A group of order 18 has the prime factorization 18 = 2 * 3^2. According to the Sylow theorems, we can determine the possible number of subgroups of each order that divides 18.\n\nFor a Sylow 2-subgroup (order 2):\nBy Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 3^2, and it must be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are 1 and 9. \n\nFor a Sylow 3-subgroup (order 3 or 9):\nBy Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 2, and it must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible numbers of Sylow 3-subgroups are 1 and 2.\n\nNow, let's determine whether these subgroups are normal or not. A Sylow p-subgroup is normal if and only if it is unique.\n\nFor the Sylow 2-subgroup:\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal. If there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, they are not normal.\n\nFor the Sylow 3-subgroup:\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it is normal. If there are 2 Sylow 3-subgroups, they are not normal.\n\nNow, let's classify the group up to isomorphism.\n\nCase 1: There is one normal Sylow 2-subgroup and one normal Sylow 3-subgroup.\nIn this case, the group is the direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the orders of these subgroups are coprime, the group is isomorphic to Z_2 x Z_9, which is isomorphic to Z_18.\n\nCase 2: There is one normal Sylow 2-subgroup and two non-normal Sylow 3-subgroups.\nIn this case, the group is a semidirect product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. The group is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 18, which is unique up to isomorphism and denoted by D_18 (dihedral group of order 18).\n\nIn conclusion, there are two possible isomorphism classes for a group of order 18: the cyclic group Z_18 and the dihedral group D_18. The Sylow 2-subgroup is normal in both cases, while the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal in the case of Z_18 and not normal in the case of D_18."
