    "message_2": "To determine whether a group of order 27 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27, we can use the properties of group theory, specifically the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 divides 27, and\n2. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\n\nThe possible divisors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. However, only 1 and 27 satisfy the second condition. \n\nIf n_3 = 1, then there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, which must be a normal subgroup of G. Let P be this 3-Sylow subgroup. Since the order of P is 3^2 = 9, P is isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3 by the classification of groups of order p^2 (where p is a prime). In either case, P is abelian.\n\nNow, consider the factor group G/P. Since the order of G is 27 and the order of P is 9, the order of G/P is 27/9 = 3. Thus, G/P is isomorphic to C3, which is also abelian.\n\nBy the correspondence theorem, if G has an abelian normal subgroup P and an abelian factor group G/P, then G must be abelian as well. Therefore, G is an abelian group of order 27.\n\nSince G is abelian and has order 27, it must be isomorphic to either C27, C3 × C9, or C3 × C3 × C3. However, the only non-abelian group of order 27 is not isomorphic to any of these abelian groups. Thus, G cannot be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn conclusion, the given group of order 27 must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C27, as it cannot be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27."
