    "message_2": "In symplectic geometry, the area of a circle is calculated using the same formula as in Euclidean geometry. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nFor a circle with a radius of 5, the area would be:\n\nA = π(5)²\nA = π(25)\nA ≈ 78.54 square units\n\nSo, the area of the circle with a radius of 5 in symplectic geometry is approximately 78.54 square units."
