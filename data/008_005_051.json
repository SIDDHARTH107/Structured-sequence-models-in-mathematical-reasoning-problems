    "message_2": "To solve the non-homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by -1/2 and add it to the second equation, and multiply the first equation by -3/2 and add it to the third equation.\n\n-1/2 * (2x + y - z) = -1/2 * 5\n-x - 1/2y + 1/2z = -5/2\n\nNow, add the first modified equation to the second equation:\n(-x - 1/2y + 1/2z) + (x - 3y + 2z) = -5/2 - 1\n-7/2y + 5/2z = -7/2\n\nNow, add the second modified equation to the third equation:\n-3/2 * (2x + y - z) = -3/2 * 5\n-3x - 3/2y + 3/2z = -15/2\n\n(3x + 7y - 5z) + (-3x - 3/2y + 3/2z) = 12 + (-15/2)\n9/2y - 7/2z = 9/2\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n-7/2y + 5/2z = -7/2\n9/2y - 7/2z = 9/2\n\nTo eliminate z, we will multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 5, and then add the two equations:\n\n-49y + 35z = -49\n45y - 35z = 45\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n-4y = -4\ny = 1\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the equations to find the value of z. We will use the first modified equation:\n\n-7/2y + 5/2z = -7/2\n-7/2(1) + 5/2z = -7/2\n5/2z = 0\nz = 0\n\nNow that we have the values of y and z, we can substitute them back into one of the original equations to find the value of x. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + y - z = 5\n2x + 1 - 0 = 5\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nSo, the solution to the non-homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 1, and z = 0."
