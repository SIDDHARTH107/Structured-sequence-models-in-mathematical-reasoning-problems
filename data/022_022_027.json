    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-iωt)] dt, from -∞ to ∞\n\nIn this case, f(t) = cos(t) + i sin(t). So, we need to find the Fourier transform of this function:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[(cos(t) + i sin(t)) * e^(-iωt)] dt, from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, let's use Euler's formula to rewrite the given function:\n\ne^(it) = cos(t) + i sin(t)\n\nSo, f(t) = e^(it). Now, we can rewrite the Fourier transform as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(it) * e^(-iωt)] dt, from -∞ to ∞\n\nCombine the exponentials:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(i(t - ω)t)] dt, from -∞ to ∞\n\nThis integral is not easy to solve directly. However, we can notice that the result will be a Dirac delta function. The Dirac delta function, δ(x), is defined as:\n\nδ(x) = ∞, if x = 0\nδ(x) = 0, if x ≠ 0\n∫[δ(x)] dx, from -∞ to ∞ = 1\n\nThe Fourier transform of f(t) will be a Dirac delta function centered at ω = 1:\n\nF(ω) = 2πδ(ω - 1)\n\nThe factor of 2π comes from the normalization convention used in the Fourier transform. So, the Fourier transform of f(t) = cos(t) + i sin(t) is F(ω) = 2πδ(ω - 1) for -∞ < t < ∞."
