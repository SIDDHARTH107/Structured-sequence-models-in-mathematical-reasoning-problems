The data is as follows:\n\nJanuary: 150 units\nFebruary: 180 units\nMarch: 200 units\nApril: 220 units\nMay: 240 units\nJune: 260 units\nJuly: 280 units\nAugust: 300 units\nSeptember: 320 units\nOctober: 340 units\nNovember: 360 units\nDecember: 380 units\n\nFind the average number of units produced per month over the past 12 months.",
    "message_2": "To find the average number of units produced per month, we need to add up the total number of units produced over the past 12 months and then divide by the number of months (12).\n\nTotal units produced = 150 + 180 + 200 + 220 + 240 + 260 + 280 + 300 + 320 + 340 + 360 + 380 = 2940 units\n\nNow, we will divide the total units produced by the number of months:\n\nAverage units produced per month = 2940 units / 12 months = 245 units\n\nSo, the average number of units produced per month over the past 12 months is 245 units."
