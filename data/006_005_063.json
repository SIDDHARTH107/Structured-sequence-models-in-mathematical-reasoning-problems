    "message_1": "A factory produces chocolate bars with an average weight of 100 grams and a standard deviation of 5 grams. If a randomly selected chocolate bar weighs less than 95 grams, what is the probability of occurrence in the given time period?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a chocolate bar weighing less than 95 grams, we can use the z-score formula. The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the observation (in this case, 95 grams), μ is the mean (100 grams), and σ is the standard deviation (5 grams).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nz = (95 - 100) / 5\nz = -5 / 5\nz = -1\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find the probability. The table gives the probability that a value from a standard normal distribution is less than the given z-score.\n\nLooking up a z-score of -1 in the z-table, we find that the probability is approximately 0.1587.\n\nSo, the probability of a randomly selected chocolate bar weighing less than 95 grams is approximately 15.87%."
