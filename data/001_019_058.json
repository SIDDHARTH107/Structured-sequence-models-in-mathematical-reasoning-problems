    "message_2": "To solve the equation |2x - 5| = 9, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 5 = 9\nIn this case, we solve for x:\n2x = 9 + 5\n2x = 14\nx = 7\n\nCase 2: 2x - 5 = -9\nIn this case, we solve for x:\n2x = -9 + 5\n2x = -4\nx = -2\n\nSo, the solutions for x are x = 7 and x = -2."
