    "message_2": "Since the group is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30, we know that it has a generator element, say g, such that the group can be written as {1, g, g^2, ..., g^29}. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = 1. A cyclic subgroup of order 5 is generated by an element of order 5.\n\nNow, we need to find the elements of order 5 in the group. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of an element must divide the order of the group. Since the order of the group is 30, the possible orders of elements are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. We are interested in elements of order 5.\n\nLet's consider the element g^k, where k is a positive integer. The order of g^k is given by the formula ord(g^k) = ord(g) / gcd(ord(g), k), where ord(g) is the order of g and gcd is the greatest common divisor. Since g is a generator of the cyclic group, ord(g) = 30.\n\nWe want to find k such that ord(g^k) = 5. Using the formula, we have:\n\n5 = 30 / gcd(30, k)\n\nMultiplying both sides by gcd(30, k), we get:\n\n5 * gcd(30, k) = 30\n\nNow, we need to find the values of k that satisfy this equation. The possible values of gcd(30, k) are divisors of 30, which are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. However, since 5 * gcd(30, k) = 30, the only possible value for gcd(30, k) is 6. Therefore, we have:\n\n5 * 6 = 30\n\nNow, we need to find the values of k such that gcd(30, k) = 6. The values of k that satisfy this condition are k = 6, 12, 18, and 24. These values of k correspond to the elements g^6, g^12, g^18, and g^24, which are the generators of cyclic subgroups of order 5.\n\nThus, there are 4 cyclic subgroups of order 5 in every group of order 30 that is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30."
