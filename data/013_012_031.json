    "message_1": "Suppose a company is the leader in a Stackelberg competition with two firms in the market. The demand curve is given by Q = 200 – P, where Q is the total quantity demanded and P is the price in dollars. The leader’s marginal cost is MC = 40, while the follower’s marginal cost is MC = 60. What is the profit of the leader and the follower, and what price and quantity will each produce?",
    "message_2": "In a Stackelberg competition, the leader firm chooses its output first, and then the follower firm chooses its output based on the leader's output. We will first find the reaction function of the follower firm and then use it to find the optimal output for the leader firm. Finally, we will calculate the profits for both firms.\n\n1. Find the reaction function of the follower firm:\n\nThe follower firm's profit function is given by:\nπ_F = (P - MC_F) * q_F\n\nSubstitute the demand curve (Q = 200 - P) to get the price in terms of quantity:\nP = 200 - Q = 200 - (q_L + q_F)\n\nNow, substitute this into the profit function:\nπ_F = ((200 - (q_L + q_F)) - MC_F) * q_F\n\nPlug in the follower's marginal cost (MC_F = 60):\nπ_F = ((200 - (q_L + q_F)) - 60) * q_F = (140 - q_L - q_F) * q_F\n\nTo maximize the profit, we take the derivative of π_F with respect to q_F and set it equal to 0:\ndπ_F/dq_F = 140 - q_L - 2q_F = 0\n\nSolve for the follower's reaction function, q_F:\nq_F = (140 - q_L) / 2\n\n2. Find the optimal output for the leader firm:\n\nThe leader firm's profit function is given by:\nπ_L = (P - MC_L) * q_L\n\nSubstitute the demand curve and the follower's reaction function into the profit function:\nπ_L = ((200 - (q_L + ((140 - q_L) / 2))) - MC_L) * q_L\n\nPlug in the leader's marginal cost (MC_L = 40):\nπ_L = ((200 - (q_L + (140 - q_L) / 2)) - 40) * q_L = (160 - (3/2)q_L) * q_L\n\nTo maximize the profit, we take the derivative of π_L with respect to q_L and set it equal to 0:\ndπ_L/dq_L = 160 - 3q_L = 0\n\nSolve for the leader's optimal output, q_L:\nq_L = 160 / 3 ≈ 53.33\n\n3. Find the follower's optimal output using the reaction function:\nq_F = (140 - q_L) / 2 = (140 - 53.33) / 2 ≈ 43.33\n\n4. Find the total quantity and price:\nQ = q_L + q_F = 53.33 + 43.33 = 96.66\nP = 200 - Q = 200 - 96.66 = 103.34\n\n5. Calculate the profits for both firms:\nπ_L = (P - MC_L) * q_L = (103.34 - 40) * 53.33 ≈ 3373.33\nπ_F = (P - MC_F) * q_F = (103.34 - 60) * 43.33 ≈ 1873.33\n\nIn summary, the leader firm will produce approximately 53.33 units and the follower firm will produce approximately 43.33 units. The price in the market will be approximately $103.34. The leader firm's profit will be approximately $3,373.33, and the follower firm's profit will be approximately $1,873.33."
