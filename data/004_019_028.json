    "message_2": "To find the car's velocity, we need to find the first derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t. \n\ns(t) = 12t^2 - 2t + 6\n\ns'(t) = d/dt (12t^2 - 2t + 6)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\ns'(t) = 24t - 2\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at t = 3 seconds by plugging in t = 3 into the velocity function s'(t):\n\ns'(3) = 24(3) - 2 = 72 - 2 = 70\n\nSo, the car's velocity at t = 3 seconds is 70 m/s.\n\nNext, to find the car's acceleration, we need to find the second derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t. \n\ns''(t) = d^2/dt^2 (12t^2 - 2t + 6)\n\nWe already found the first derivative s'(t) = 24t - 2, so now we need to differentiate it again:\n\ns''(t) = d/dt (24t - 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\ns''(t) = 24\n\nThe second derivative is a constant, which means the acceleration is constant and does not depend on time. Therefore, the car's acceleration at t = 3 seconds is 24 m/sÂ²."
