    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of graph G, we can use the recursive formula:\n\nT(G) = T(G\\e) + T(G/e)\n\nwhere G\\e is the graph obtained by deleting edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e.\n\nLet's label the edges of the graph G as follows:\n\n![Graph G with labeled edges](https://i.imgur.com/3w1Qy6j.png)\n\nNow, we will compute the Tutte polynomial using the recursive formula:\n\n1. T(G) = T(G\\e1) + T(G/e1)\n2. T(G\\e1) = T(G\\e1\\e2) + T(G\\e1/e2)\n3. T(G\\e1\\e2) = T(G\\e1\\e2\\e3) + T(G\\e1\\e2/e3)\n4. T(G\\e1\\e2\\e3) = T(G\\e1\\e2\\e3\\e4) + T(G\\e1\\e2\\e3/e4)\n\nSince G\\e1\\e2\\e3\\e4 is an empty graph with 4 vertices, its Tutte polynomial is (x-1)^4. Also, G\\e1\\e2\\e3/e4 is a graph with 3 vertices and 1 edge, so its Tutte polynomial is (x-1)^3 * (y-1).\n\nNow, we can substitute back:\n\n5. T(G\\e1\\e2) = (x-1)^4 + (x-1)^3 * (y-1)\n6. T(G\\e1/e2) = T(G\\e1/e2\\e3) + T(G\\e1/e2/e3)\n\nG\\e1/e2\\e3 is a graph with 3 vertices and 1 edge, so its Tutte polynomial is (x-1)^3 * (y-1). G\\e1/e2/e3 is a graph with 2 vertices and 1 edge, so its Tutte polynomial is (x-1)^2 * (y-1)^2.\n\n7. T(G\\e1/e2) = (x-1)^3 * (y-1) + (x-1)^2 * (y-1)^2\n8. T(G\\e1) = T(G\\e1\\e2) + T(G\\e1/e2) = (x-1)^4 + (x-1)^3 * (y-1) + (x-1)^3 * (y-1) + (x-1)^2 * (y-1)^2\n9. T(G/e1) = T(G/e1\\e2) + T(G/e1/e2)\n\nG/e1\\e2 is a graph with 3 vertices and 1 edge, so its Tutte polynomial is (x-1)^3 * (y-1). G/e1/e2 is a graph with 2 vertices and 1 edge, so its Tutte polynomial is (x-1)^2 * (y-1)^2.\n\n10. T(G/e1) = (x-1)^3 * (y-1) + (x-1)^2 * (y-1)^2\n11. T(G) = T(G\\e1) + T(G/e1) = (x-1)^4 + 2*(x-1)^3 * (y-1) + 2*(x-1)^2 * (y-1)^2\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of graph G is:\n\nT(G) = (x-1)^4 + 2*(x-1)^3 * (y-1) + 2*(x-1)^2 * (y-1)^2"
