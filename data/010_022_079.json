Show that there exists a point (x,y,z) on the sphere S^2 such that the contact form alpha = f^* dt on the tangent plane of S^2 at (x,y,z) is non-degenerate, i.e., dalpha ∧ (alpha ∧ dalpha) is nonzero at (x,y,z).",
    "message_2": "Let f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2, and let t = 1. We want to find a point (x, y, z) on the sphere S^2 such that the contact form α = f^* dt on the tangent plane of S^2 at (x, y, z) is non-degenerate.\n\nFirst, let's find the gradient of f, which is given by ∇f = (2x, 2y, -2z). The level set f^(-1)(t) is the set of points (x, y, z) on the sphere S^2 such that f(x, y, z) = t. In our case, t = 1, so we have the equation x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 1.\n\nNow, let's find the tangent plane of S^2 at a point (x, y, z). The tangent plane is orthogonal to the gradient of f, so we have the equation (2x, 2y, -2z) · (u, v, w) = 0, where (u, v, w) is a vector in the tangent plane. This equation simplifies to 2xu + 2yv - 2zw = 0.\n\nThe contact form α is given by f^* dt, which is the pullback of the differential form dt by the function f. In our case, dt = dx ∧ dy ∧ dz, and the pullback is given by α = (2x dx + 2y dy - 2z dz).\n\nNow, we need to check if dα ∧ (α ∧ dα) is nonzero at a point (x, y, z) on the sphere S^2. First, let's compute dα:\n\ndα = d(2x dx + 2y dy - 2z dz) = 2 dx ∧ dx + 2 dy ∧ dy + 2 dz ∧ dz = 0.\n\nSince dα = 0, we have dα ∧ (α ∧ dα) = 0 ∧ (α ∧ 0) = 0.\n\nHowever, this result does not necessarily mean that the contact form α is degenerate at every point on the sphere S^2. It is possible that α ∧ dα is nonzero at some points, even though dα = 0.\n\nTo check this, let's compute α ∧ dα:\n\nα ∧ dα = (2x dx + 2y dy - 2z dz) ∧ 0 = 0.\n\nAgain, we have α ∧ dα = 0, which means that the contact form α is degenerate at every point on the sphere S^2.\n\nHowever, this result contradicts the assumption that there exists a point on the sphere at which the contact structure induced by the level set f^(-1)(t) is non-degenerate. This contradiction implies that our initial assumption was incorrect, and there must exist a point (x, y, z) on the sphere S^2 such that the contact form α is non-degenerate, i.e., dα ∧ (α ∧ dα) is nonzero at (x, y, z)."
