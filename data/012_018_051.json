    "message_2": "To disconnect the graph, we need to find a cut set, which is a set of edges whose removal will result in a disconnected graph. In this case, we can observe that vertex 5 is a cut vertex, as it connects the two parts of the graph: {1, 2, 3, 4} and {6, 7}. \n\nTo disconnect the graph, we need to remove all the edges connected to vertex 5. These edges are (3,5), (4,5), (5,6), and (5,7). Therefore, the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph is 4."
