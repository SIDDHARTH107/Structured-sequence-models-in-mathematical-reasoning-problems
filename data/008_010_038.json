    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we need to perform a series of operations on the augmented matrix to bring it to its reduced row-echelon form. The given system of linear equations can be represented as an augmented matrix:\n\n[ 1  2  3 |  6 ]\n[ 2  3  4 | 13 ]\n[ 3  4  5 | 17 ]\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the 2nd and 3rd rows.\nTo do this, we'll perform the following row operations:\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\nR3 = R3 - 3 * R1\n\n[ 1  2  3 |  6 ]\n[ 0 -1 -2 |  1 ]\n[ 0 -2 -4 |  2 ]\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the 3rd row.\nTo do this, we'll perform the following row operation:\nR3 = R3 - 2 * R2\n\n[ 1  2  3 |  6 ]\n[ 0 -1 -2 |  1 ]\n[ 0  0  0 |  0 ]\n\nNow, we have reached the row-echelon form of the matrix. We can see that the last row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 0, which is always true. So, we can ignore this row and focus on the first two rows.\n\nStep 3: Solve for y and z using back-substitution.\nFrom the second row, we have the equation:\n-y - 2z = 1\ny = -1 - 2z\n\nNow, substitute the value of y in the first row equation:\nx + 2(-1 - 2z) + 3z = 6\nx - 4z - 2 + 3z = 6\nx - z = 8\n\nStep 4: Express z in terms of a parameter.\nLet z = t, where t is a parameter. Then,\nx = 8 + t\ny = -1 - 2t\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is given by:\nx = 8 + t\ny = -1 - 2t\nz = t\n\nwhere t is any real number. This system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, and they are dependent on the parameter t."
