    "message_1": "A manufacturing company needs to decide how much of two products, Product A and Product B, to produce each week. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units per week due to production capacity constraints. The profit for each unit of Product A is $200, while the profit for each unit of Product B is $300. However, the production of Product A requires 2 hours of machine time per unit, while the production of Product B requires 3 hours of machine time per unit. The company has a maximum of 250 hours of machine time available per week. \n\nHow many units of Product A and Product B should the company produce each week to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 100 (production capacity constraint)\n2. 2x + 3y ≤ 250 (machine time constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 200x + 300y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will solve the constraint inequalities graphically and find the vertices of the feasible region. Then, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex to determine the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, we will rewrite the constraint inequalities as equalities to find the boundary lines:\n\n1. x + y = 100\n2. 2x + 3y = 250\n\nNow, we will find the intercepts of these lines:\n\nFor line 1:\nx-intercept: y = 0, x = 100\ny-intercept: x = 0, y = 100\n\nFor line 2:\nx-intercept: y = 0, x = 125\ny-intercept: x = 0, y = 83.33 (250/3)\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of line 1 and the y-axis: (0, 100)\n2. Intersection of line 2 and the y-axis: (0, 83.33)\n3. Intersection of line 1 and line 2:\n\nx + y = 100\n2x + 3y = 250\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 50 and y = 50.\n\nSo, the third vertex is (50, 50).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 100) = 200(0) + 300(100) = $30,000\nP(0, 83.33) = 200(0) + 300(83.33) ≈ $25,000\nP(50, 50) = 200(50) + 300(50) = $25,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $30,000, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of Product A and 100 units of Product B."
