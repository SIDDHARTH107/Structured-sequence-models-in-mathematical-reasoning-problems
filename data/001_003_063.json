    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we want to make the coefficients of either x or y the same in both equations so we can eliminate one of the variables. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2. This will give us:\n\n4x + 6y = 24 (1st equation multiplied by 2)\n4x - 5y = 15 (2nd equation)\n\nNow, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x - 5y) = 24 - 15\n4x + 6y - 4x + 5y = 9\n11y = 9\n\nNow, we can solve for y by dividing both sides by 11:\n\ny = 9/11\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either the first or second equation to solve for x. We'll use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 12\n2x + 3(9/11) = 12\n\nNow, we can multiply 3 by 9/11:\n\n2x + 27/11 = 12\n\nTo solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 11:\n\n11(2x + 27/11) = 12 * 11\n22x + 27 = 132\n\nNow, we can subtract 27 from both sides:\n\n22x = 105\n\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 22 to find the value of x:\n\nx = 105/22\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 105/22\ny = 9/11"
