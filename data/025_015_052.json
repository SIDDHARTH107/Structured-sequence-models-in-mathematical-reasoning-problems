    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane that contains the surface given by the equation x² + y² - z² = 1 at the point (1, 0, 0), we first need to find the normal vector to the surface at that point.\n\nThe gradient of the surface is given by the vector of partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∇f(x, y, z) = (df/dx, df/dy, df/dz)\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives of the given equation:\n\ndf/dx = 2x\ndf/dy = 2y\ndf/dz = -2z\n\nAt the point (1, 0, 0), the gradient vector is:\n\n∇f(1, 0, 0) = (2, 0, 0)\n\nThis vector is the normal vector to the surface at the given point. Now, we can use the point-normal form of the equation of a plane:\n\nA(x - x₀) + B(y - y₀) + C(z - z₀) = 0\n\nwhere (A, B, C) is the normal vector and (x₀, y₀, z₀) is the given point. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n2(x - 1) + 0(y - 0) + 0(z - 0) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get the equation of the plane:\n\n2x - 2 = 0\n\nor\n\nx = 1"
