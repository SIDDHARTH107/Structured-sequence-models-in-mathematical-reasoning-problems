    "message_2": "First, let's find the union and symmetric difference of sets A and B.\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (all elements from both sets, without repetition)\n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1, 2, 5, 6} (elements that are in either A or B, but not in both)\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∪ B) and (A ∆ B).\n\n(A ∪ B) ∆ (A ∆ B) = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {1, 2, 5, 6}) ∪ ({1, 2, 5, 6} - {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})\n= {3, 4} ∪ {} = {3, 4}\n\nNow, let's verify if the distributive property of sets holds for the symmetric difference. The distributive property states that:\n\nA ∆ (B ∪ C) = (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C)\n\nIn our case, we have A, B, and (A ∪ B) as the sets. Let's check if the distributive property holds:\n\nA ∆ ((A ∪ B) ∪ B) = (A ∆ (A ∪ B)) ∪ (A ∆ B)\n\nSince (A ∪ B) ∪ B = A ∪ B, we have:\n\nA ∆ (A ∪ B) = (A ∆ (A ∪ B)) ∪ (A ∆ B)\n\nWe already found that A ∆ (A ∪ B) = {3, 4} and A ∆ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}. Now let's find (A ∆ (A ∪ B)) ∪ (A ∆ B):\n\n{3, 4} ∪ {1, 2, 5, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nSince A ∆ (A ∪ B) ≠ (A ∆ (A ∪ B)) ∪ (A ∆ B), the distributive property of sets does not hold for the symmetric difference in this case."
