    "message_2": "To calculate the maximum Lyapunov exponent (MLE) for the Hénon-Heiles system, we need to numerically integrate the system's equations of motion and their variational equations. The Hénon-Heiles system is described by the Hamiltonian:\n\nH(x, y, px, py) = 1/2 (px^2 + py^2) + 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) + x^2*y - 1/3*y^3\n\nThe equations of motion are:\n\ndx/dt = px\ndy/dt = py\ndpx/dt = -x - 2*x*y\ndpy/dt = -y - x^2 + y^2\n\nThe variational equations are:\n\nd(dx'/dt) = dpx'\nd(dy'/dt) = dpy'\nd(dpx'/dt) = -dx' - 2*(x'*y + x*dy')\nd(dpy'/dt) = -dy' - 2*x*dx' + 2*y*dy'\n\nGiven the initial conditions x = 0.1, y = 0.1, px = 0.1, and py = 0.1, we can numerically integrate these equations using a suitable numerical method, such as the Runge-Kutta method. After integrating the equations, we can calculate the MLE using the following formula:\n\nMLE = (1/t) * log(||dX(t)|| / ||dX(0)||)\n\nwhere t is the integration time, dX(t) is the deviation vector at time t, and ||dX(t)|| is the norm of the deviation vector.\n\nCalculating the MLE requires numerical methods and is beyond the scope of a simple text response. However, you can use software like Python with packages such as SciPy or MATLAB to perform the numerical integration and calculate the MLE for the given initial conditions."
