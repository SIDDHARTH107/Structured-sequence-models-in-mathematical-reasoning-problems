    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest possible vertex cover.\n\nIn this graph, we can find a minimum vertex cover by selecting the following vertices: {B, C, E}. This covers all the edges in the graph:\n\n- Edge AB is covered by vertex B.\n- Edge BC is covered by vertex B and C.\n- Edge CD is covered by vertex C.\n- Edge DE is covered by vertex E.\n- Edge EF is covered by vertex E.\n- Edge FG is covered by vertex E.\n- Edge CF is covered by vertex C.\n\nNo smaller set of vertices can cover all the edges, so the minimum size of a vertex cover for this graph is 3."
