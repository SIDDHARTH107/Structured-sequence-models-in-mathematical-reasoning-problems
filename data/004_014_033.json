    "message_2": "To find the volume of the cone using integration, we first need to set up an equation for the radius of the cone as a function of its height. We can do this by using similar triangles. Let r be the radius of a cross-sectional disk at height h, and R and H be the radius and height of the cone, respectively.\n\nr/h = R/H\n\nWe are given R = 6 cm and H = 8 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nr/h = 6/8\nr = (3/4)h\n\nNow, we can set up the integral to find the volume of the cone. The volume of a small disk at height h with thickness dh is given by the formula:\n\ndV = πr^2 dh\n\nSubstituting r = (3/4)h, we get:\n\ndV = π((3/4)h)^2 dh\n\nNow, we integrate this expression with respect to h from 0 to H:\n\nV = ∫[0, 8] π((3/4)h)^2 dh\n\nV = π ∫[0, 8] (9/16)h^2 dh\n\nNow, we integrate and evaluate the definite integral:\n\nV = π(9/16) ∫[0, 8] h^2 dh\nV = π(9/16) [(1/3)h^3] |[0, 8]\nV = (9π/48) [((1/3)(8^3) - (1/3)(0^3))]\nV = (9π/48) (1/3)(512)\nV = (3π/16)(512)\n\nV = 96π cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is 96π cubic centimeters."
