    "message_1": "What is the total number of complex roots of the polynomial function  f(z) = z^3 + 2z^2 + 3z + 4?\nThe Liouville's Theorem and Fundamental Theorem of Algebra can be applied to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that a polynomial function of degree n will have exactly n complex roots, counting multiplicities. In this case, the polynomial function f(z) = z^3 + 2z^2 + 3z + 4 has a degree of 3. Therefore, it has exactly 3 complex roots."
