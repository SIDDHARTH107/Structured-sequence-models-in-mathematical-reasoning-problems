    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the Rosenbrock function using the differential evolution algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of 20 individuals with random values for x and y within the interval [-5, 5].\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each individual using the Rosenbrock function.\n3. Perform the differential evolution algorithm for 100 generations.\n4. Select the best individual from the final population as the solution.\n\nSince I am an AI language model, I cannot directly execute code or perform calculations. However, I can provide you with a Python code using the `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution` function to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import differential_evolution\n\ndef rosenbrock(x):\n    return (1 - x[0])**2 + 100 * (x[1] - x[0]**2)**2\n\nbounds = [(-5, 5), (-5, 5)]\n\nresult = differential_evolution(rosenbrock, bounds, popsize=20, maxiter=100)\n\nprint(\"Minimum value of the Rosenbrock function:\", result.fun)\nprint(\"Optimal values of x and y:\", result.x)\n```\n\nBy running this code, you will obtain the minimum value of the Rosenbrock function and the corresponding values of x and y. The global minimum of the Rosenbrock function is 0, which occurs at the point (1, 1). The differential evolution algorithm should provide a solution close to this point."
