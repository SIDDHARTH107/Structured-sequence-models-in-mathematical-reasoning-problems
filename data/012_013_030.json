    "message_2": "Let's denote the vertices of the graph G as A, B, C, D, and E. Since all possible pairs of vertices are connected except for two vertices, let's assume that vertices A and B are not connected. The graph G is almost a complete graph (K5) but missing one edge (AB).\n\nTo find the chromatic polynomial of G, we can use the deletion-contraction formula. The deletion-contraction formula states that for any graph G and edge e, the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G/e, k)\n\nwhere G - e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n\nIn our case, we can choose the missing edge AB as the edge e. So, G - e is the complete graph K5, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting vertices A and B into a single vertex, which results in the complete graph K4.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of a complete graph Kn is given by:\n\nP(Kn, k) = k(k - 1)(k - 2)...(k - n + 1)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of K5 is:\n\nP(K5, k) = k(k - 1)(k - 2)(k - 3)(k - 4)\n\nAnd the chromatic polynomial of K4 is:\n\nP(K4, k) = k(k - 1)(k - 2)(k - 3)\n\nNow, we can use the deletion-contraction formula to find the chromatic polynomial of G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(K5, k) - P(K4, k)\nP(G, k) = k(k - 1)(k - 2)(k - 3)(k - 4) - k(k - 1)(k - 2)(k - 3)\n\nFactoring out the common terms, we get:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k - 1)(k - 2)(k - 3)[(k - 4) - 1]\nP(G, k) = k(k - 1)(k - 2)(k - 3)(k - 5)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of G is:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k - 1)(k - 2)(k - 3)(k - 5)"
