    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between points. In this case, we are looking for linear transformations that preserve the metric $ds^2 = dx^2 + 4dy^2 + 4dz^2$ and fix the origin.\n\nLet $T$ be a linear transformation that preserves the metric, and let $T(x, y, z) = (x', y', z')$. Then, we have:\n\n$$ds^2 = dx^2 + 4dy^2 + 4dz^2 = dx'^2 + 4dy'^2 + 4dz'^2$$\n\nSince $T$ is linear, we can write it as a matrix multiplication:\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ z' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the squared distance in terms of the transformed coordinates:\n\n$$dx'^2 + 4dy'^2 + 4dz'^2 = (ax + by + cz)^2 + 4(dx + ey + fz)^2 + 4(gx + hy + iz)^2$$\n\nExpanding this expression and comparing it with the original metric, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$$\n$$4d^2 + 4e^2 + 4f^2 = 4$$\n$$4g^2 + 4h^2 + 4i^2 = 4$$\n$$ab + de + cf = 0$$\n$$ac + dh + ci = 0$$\n$$bg + eh + fi = 0$$\n\nThe first three equations tell us that the columns of the transformation matrix are orthogonal and have lengths 1, 2, and 2, respectively. The last three equations tell us that the columns are also pairwise orthogonal. Thus, the transformation matrix represents an orthogonal transformation, and since it preserves the origin, it is an isometry.\n\nThe isometries that preserve the origin are given by the orthogonal matrices with columns of lengths 1, 2, and 2. These matrices can be found by considering all possible combinations of signs and permutations of the columns. There are 8 possible combinations of signs and 6 possible permutations, giving a total of 48 isometries."
