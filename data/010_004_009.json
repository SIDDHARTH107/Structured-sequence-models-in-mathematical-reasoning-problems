    "message_2": "To determine whether the sequence (1/n) converges in X, we need to find if there exists a limit point in X such that the sequence converges to that point.\n\nConsider the sequence (1/n) where n is a positive integer. As n approaches infinity, the terms of the sequence (1/n) approach 0. In other words, for any ε > 0, there exists an N ∈ ℕ such that for all n > N, |(1/n) - 0| < ε.\n\nSince 0 is an element of the unit interval X = [0,1], we can conclude that the sequence (1/n) converges to 0 in X."
