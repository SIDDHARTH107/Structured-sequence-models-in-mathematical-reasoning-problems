    "message_2": "First, let's recall some properties of the groups mentioned:\n\n1. C10 is a cyclic group of order 10, which means it has a single generator and is abelian (commutative).\n2. D5 is the dihedral group of order 10, which is the group of symmetries of a regular pentagon. It is non-abelian and has two generators: a rotation and a reflection.\n3. There is no non-abelian group of order 10 other than D5, as we will see in the justification below.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of G:\n\nSince the order of G is 10, by the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a subgroup of order 5 and a subgroup of order 2. Let H be the subgroup of order 5 and K be the subgroup of order 2. Note that the order of H (5) is prime, so H is cyclic and isomorphic to C5. Also, K is isomorphic to C2 since it has order 2.\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\nIn this case, G must be a direct product of its subgroups H and K, i.e., G ≅ H × K ≅ C5 × C2. Since the orders of C5 and C2 are coprime, their direct product is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 10, i.e., G ≅ C10.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian.\nIn this case, G cannot be a direct product of H and K. We know that |H| = 5 and |K| = 2, and since |G| = |H| * |K|, we have that H and K have trivial intersection, i.e., H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element. Also, since the order of H is 5 and the order of K is 2, we have that HK = KH. Therefore, G can be expressed as a semi-direct product of H and K, i.e., G ≅ H ⋊ K.\n\nNow, we know that H is isomorphic to C5 and K is isomorphic to C2. The semi-direct product is determined by the action of K on H, which can be described by an automorphism of H. Since H is isomorphic to C5, it has four possible automorphisms: the identity automorphism and three others. However, since K is isomorphic to C2, the automorphism must be of order 2. This leaves only one possibility for the automorphism, which corresponds to the inversion automorphism in C5.\n\nWith this unique choice of automorphism, we have that G ≅ C5 ⋊ C2, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be either isomorphic to the cyclic group C10 if it is abelian or isomorphic to the dihedral group D5 if it is non-abelian. There is no other non-abelian group of order 10. To determine which one G is isomorphic to, we would need more information about the properties of G."
