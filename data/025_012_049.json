    "message_2": "To find the points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 - 3x + 4 over the field F7, we will check all possible combinations of x and y values in the range of 0 to 6 (since F7 has elements from 0 to 6).\n\nWe will use the equation y^2 = x^3 - 3x + 4 (mod 7) to check if a given (x, y) pair is a point on the curve.\n\nHere are the possible combinations:\n\n1. (0, 0): 0^2 = 0^3 - 3*0 + 4 (mod 7) => 0 = 4 (mod 7) => False\n2. (0, 1): 1^2 = 0^3 - 3*0 + 4 (mod 7) => 1 = 4 (mod 7) => False\n3. (0, 2): 2^2 = 0^3 - 3*0 + 4 (mod 7) => 4 = 4 (mod 7) => True, so (0, 2) is a point on the curve.\n4. (0, 3): 3^2 = 0^3 - 3*0 + 4 (mod 7) => 2 = 4 (mod 7) => False\n5. (0, 4): 4^2 = 0^3 - 3*0 + 4 (mod 7) => 2 = 4 (mod 7) => False\n6. (0, 5): 5^2 = 0^3 - 3*0 + 4 (mod 7) => 4 = 4 (mod 7) => True, so (0, 5) is a point on the curve.\n\nWe can continue this process for other x values (1 to 6) and find the following points on the curve:\n\n7. (1, 1): 1^2 = 1^3 - 3*1 + 4 (mod 7) => 1 = 2 (mod 7) => False\n8. (1, 2): 2^2 = 1^3 - 3*1 + 4 (mod 7) => 4 = 2 (mod 7) => False\n9. (1, 3): 3^2 = 1^3 - 3*1 + 4 (mod 7) => 2 = 2 (mod 7) => True, so (1, 3) is a point on the curve.\n10. (1, 4): 4^2 = 1^3 - 3*1 + 4 (mod 7) => 2 = 2 (mod 7) => True, so (1, 4) is a point on the curve.\n\nWe have found four points on the elliptic curve: (0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 3), and (1, 4)."
