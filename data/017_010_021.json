    "message_2": "1. If the group G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10:\n\nLet's denote the generator of the cyclic group C10 as g. Then, every element in C10 can be written as a power of g, i.e., {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^9}. To find the subgroup generated by an element of order 2, we need to find an element x in G such that x^2 = e (identity element). In C10, the element g^5 has order 2 since (g^5)^2 = g^10 = e. Therefore, the subgroup generated by an element of order 2 is {e, g^5}.\n\n2. If the group G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5:\n\nThe dihedral group D5 consists of 5 rotations and 5 reflections. The rotations are generated by an element r, where r^5 = e. The subgroup generated by the rotation of 72 degrees is the cyclic subgroup generated by r, since 72 degrees is one-fifth of a full rotation (360 degrees). So, the subgroup generated by the rotation of 72 degrees is {e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4}.\n\n3. If the group G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10:\n\nSince G is non-abelian, it means that there exist elements a and b in G such that ab ≠ ba. Note that there are only two non-abelian groups of order 10: the dihedral group D5 and the semidirect product of C5 and C2. In both cases, we can find elements a and b such that ab ≠ ba.\n\nFor D5, let a = r (rotation) and b = s (reflection). Then, ab = rs and ba = sr. Since D5 is non-abelian, we have rs ≠ sr.\n\nFor the semidirect product of C5 and C2, let a and b be elements of order 5 and 2, respectively. Then, ab has order 10, while ba has order 2. Since the orders of ab and ba are different, we have ab ≠ ba.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that there exist elements a and b in G such that ab ≠ ba."
