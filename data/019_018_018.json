    "message_2": "Let's consider two even numbers, say 'a' and 'b'. By definition, an even number can be represented as 2n, where n is an integer.\n\nSo, we can write 'a' and 'b' as:\na = 2n (where n is an integer)\nb = 2m (where m is another integer)\n\nNow, let's find the sum of these two even numbers:\na + b = 2n + 2m\n\nWe can factor out the common factor '2' from the expression:\na + b = 2(n + m)\n\nSince both n and m are integers, their sum (n + m) is also an integer. Let's denote this integer as 'k', where k = n + m.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as:\na + b = 2k\n\nThis shows that the sum of two even numbers 'a' and 'b' can be represented as a product of 2 and an integer 'k'. Therefore, the sum of two even numbers is always even. QED."
