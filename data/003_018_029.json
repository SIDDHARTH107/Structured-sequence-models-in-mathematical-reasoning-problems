    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 3sin(2x) + 2cos(3x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. \n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. \n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the given function:\n\ndy/dx = d(3sin(2x))/dx + d(2cos(3x))/dx\n\nFor the first term, the outer function is 3sin(u) and the inner function is u = 2x. The derivative of 3sin(u) with respect to u is 3cos(u), and the derivative of 2x with respect to x is 2. Applying the chain rule:\n\nd(3sin(2x))/dx = 3cos(2x) * 2 = 6cos(2x)\n\nFor the second term, the outer function is 2cos(v) and the inner function is v = 3x. The derivative of 2cos(v) with respect to v is -2sin(v), and the derivative of 3x with respect to x is 3. Applying the chain rule:\n\nd(2cos(3x))/dx = -2sin(3x) * 3 = -6sin(3x)\n\nNow, we can write the derivative of the whole function:\n\ndy/dx = 6cos(2x) - 6sin(3x)\n\nNow we need to find the value of the derivative at x = π/4:\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = 6cos(2(π/4)) - 6sin(3(π/4))\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = 6cos(π/2) - 6sin(3π/4)\n\ncos(π/2) = 0 and sin(3π/4) = √2/2, so:\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = 6(0) - 6(√2/2)\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = -6(√2/2) = -3√2\n\nSo, the derivative of y = 3sin(2x) + 2cos(3x) at x = π/4 is -3√2."
