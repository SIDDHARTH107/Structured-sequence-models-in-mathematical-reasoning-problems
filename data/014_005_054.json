    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to digitally sign a document using the RSA algorithm with a private key exponent of $d = 29$ and a modulus of $n = 437$. The hash of the document she wants to sign is $h = 123$. What is the digital signature that Alice should append to the document? (Hint: Recall that the signature is computed as $s = h^d \\bmod n$.)",
    "message_2": "To compute the digital signature, we need to calculate $s = h^d \\bmod n$. We are given $h = 123$, $d = 29$, and $n = 437$. \n\nUsing the given values, we have:\n\n$s = 123^{29} \\bmod 437$\n\nTo calculate this, we can use the exponentiation by squaring method, which is an efficient way to compute large powers modulo a number. \n\nFirst, we compute the binary representation of the exponent $d = 29$. In binary, $29$ is represented as $11101$.\n\nNow, we perform the exponentiation by squaring:\n\n1. Initialize the result variable $s$ to $1$.\n2. Iterate through the binary representation of $d$ from left to right:\n   a. Square the current value of $s$ and take the result modulo $n$.\n   b. If the current bit is $1$, multiply $s$ by $h$ and take the result modulo $n$.\n\nFollowing these steps:\n\n1. $s = 1$\n2. First bit is $1$:\n   a. $s = (1^2) \\bmod 437 = 1$\n   b. $s = (1 \\times 123) \\bmod 437 = 123$\n3. Second bit is $1$:\n   a. $s = (123^2) \\bmod 437 = 15129 \\bmod 437 = 69$\n   b. $s = (69 \\times 123) \\bmod 437 = 8487 \\bmod 437 = 390$\n4. Third bit is $1$:\n   a. $s = (390^2) \\bmod 437 = 152100 \\bmod 437 = 254$\n   b. $s = (254 \\times 123) \\bmod 437 = 31242 \\bmod 437 = 166$\n5. Fourth bit is $0$:\n   a. $s = (166^2) \\bmod 437 = 27556 \\bmod 437 = 97$\n   b. (Skip this step since the current bit is $0$)\n6. Fifth bit is $1$:\n   a. $s = (97^2) \\bmod 437 = 9409 \\bmod 437 = 53$\n   b. $s = (53 \\times 123) \\bmod 437 = 6519 \\bmod 437 = 75$\n\nAfter completing the exponentiation by squaring, we have the result:\n\n$s = 75$\n\nSo, the digital signature that Alice should append to the document is $75$."
