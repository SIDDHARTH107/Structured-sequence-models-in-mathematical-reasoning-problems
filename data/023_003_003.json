    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using Fourier series, we first need to identify the type of PDE. The given PDE is a homogeneous wave equation with a wave speed of 2 (since c^2 = 4). We will use the method of separation of variables to find the solution.\n\nLet u(x, t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\nX''(x)T(t) - 4X(x)T''(t) = 0\n\nNow, divide both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = 4T''(t)/T(t)\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on t, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ^2:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = 4T''(t)/T(t) = -λ^2\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1) X''(x) + λ^2X(x) = 0\n2) T''(t) + (λ^2/4)T(t) = 0\n\nSolve the first ODE with the given periodic boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = X(1), X'(0) = X'(1)\n\nThe general solution of the first ODE is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nA = A*cos(λ), B = B*sin(λ)\n\nSince the boundary conditions are periodic, λ = 2πn for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nNow, solve the second ODE:\n\nT''(t) + (λ^2/4)T(t) = 0\n\nThe general solution of the second ODE is:\n\nT(t) = C*cos(λt/2) + D*sin(λt/2)\n\nNow, we have the general solution of the PDE:\n\nu(x, t) = ∑[(A_n*cos(2πnx) + B_n*sin(2πnx))*(C_n*cos(πnt) + D_n*sin(πnt))]\n\nApply the initial conditions:\n\nu(x, 0) = x(1-x), ∂u(x, 0)/∂t = 0\n\nu(x, 0) = ∑[(A_n*cos(2πnx) + B_n*sin(2πnx))*C_n] = x(1-x)\n\n∂u(x, 0)/∂t = ∑[(A_n*cos(2πnx) + B_n*sin(2πnx))*D_n*πn] = 0\n\nSince the second initial condition is zero, D_n = 0 for all n. Now, we only need to find the coefficients A_n and C_n.\n\nUsing the orthogonality of cosine functions, we can find A_n:\n\nA_n = 2*∫[x(1-x)*cos(2πnx)dx] from 0 to 1\n\nA_0 = 1/3, A_n = (-1)^n/(π^2n^2) for n ≥ 1\n\nNow, we have the solution of the PDE at time t = 1:\n\nu(x, 1) = ∑[(A_n*cos(2πnx))*C_n*cos(πn)]\n\nSince D_n = 0 for all n, we only need to find C_n. However, we don't have enough information to find C_n. The problem is not well-posed to find the solution at time t = 1."
