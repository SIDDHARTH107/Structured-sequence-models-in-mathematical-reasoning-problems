    "message_2": "To calculate the chromatic polynomial of G, we will use the deletion-contraction formula. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) represents the number of ways to color the graph G with k colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nLet's start by removing the edge between vertices B and D. We get two subgraphs: G1, which is a complete graph with 4 vertices (K4), and G2, which is a cycle with 4 vertices (C4).\n\n```\nG1:       G2:\nA — B     A — B\n|\\  |     |   |\n| \\ |     |   |\nC — D     C — D\n```\n\nNow, we can apply the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G1, k) - P(G2, k)\n\nFor G1 (K4), the chromatic polynomial is k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3), since there are k choices for the first vertex, k-1 choices for the second vertex, k-2 choices for the third vertex, and k-3 choices for the fourth vertex.\n\nFor G2 (C4), the chromatic polynomial is (k(k-1)^2 - k(k-1)), since there are k choices for the first vertex, k-1 choices for the second vertex, k-1 choices for the third vertex, and then we subtract the overcounted cases where the first and fourth vertices have the same color.\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) - (k(k-1)^2 - k(k-1))\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) - k(k-1)^2 + k(k-1)\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)[(k-2)(k-3) - (k-1) + 1]\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k^2 - 5k + 6)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of G is P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k^2 - 5k + 6)."
