    "message_1": "A group of five friends, Alex, Ben, Chris, Dave, and Eric, are playing a game that involves them each secretly writing down a number between 1 and 10. They then take turns guessing each other's numbers, but they can only make a guess if they know for certain what the number is. If someone guesses wrong, they are out of the game.\n\nAfter the first round of guessing, the following statements were made:\n\nAlex: \"I don't know what Ben's number is.\"\nBen: \"I don't know what Chris's number is.\"\nChris: \"I don't know what Dave's number is.\"\nDave: \"I don't know what Eric's number is.\"\nEric: \"I don't know what Alex's number is.\"\n\nWhat is the highest possible number of players who could be correct and still stay in the game?",
    "message_2": "All five friends can be correct and still stay in the game.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSince they can only make a guess if they know for certain what the number is, the fact that they all said they don't know the number means that none of them saw a number that would allow them to make a certain guess. This means that each of them wrote down a number that is not unique among the numbers chosen by the group.\n\nLet's assume that all five friends wrote down the same number, say 5. In this case, none of them would be able to make a certain guess, as there are no unique numbers to identify a specific person's number. Therefore, all five of them would be correct in saying they don't know the other person's number, and they would all still be in the game."
