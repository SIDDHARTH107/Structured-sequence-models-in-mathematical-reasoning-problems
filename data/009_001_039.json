    "message_1": "Consider a population of rabbits. If the initial population is 500 and the growth rate is proportional to the population at any time, with a constant of proportionality of 0.05 rabbits per month, write a differential equation modeling the rabbit population over time, and use it to determine the population after 3 months.",
    "message_2": "To model the rabbit population over time, we can use a differential equation. Let P(t) represent the population of rabbits at time t (in months). Since the growth rate is proportional to the population at any time, we can write the differential equation as:\n\ndP/dt = k * P(t)\n\nwhere dP/dt is the rate of change of the population with respect to time, k is the constant of proportionality (0.05 rabbits per month), and P(t) is the population at time t.\n\nNow we have:\n\ndP/dt = 0.05 * P(t)\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use separation of variables. Divide both sides by P(t) and multiply both sides by dt:\n\n(1/P(t)) * dP = 0.05 * dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P(t)) dP = ∫0.05 dt\n\nThe left side integrates to ln|P(t)| and the right side integrates to 0.05t + C, where C is the constant of integration:\n\nln|P(t)| = 0.05t + C\n\nTo find the constant of integration, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 500:\n\nln|500| = 0.05(0) + C\nln|500| = C\n\nNow we can write the general solution:\n\nln|P(t)| = 0.05t + ln|500|\n\nTo solve for P(t), we can use the property of logarithms that ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b):\n\nln|P(t)/500| = 0.05t\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides to get rid of the natural logarithm:\n\nP(t)/500 = e^(0.05t)\n\nP(t) = 500 * e^(0.05t)\n\nNow, we can find the population after 3 months by plugging in t = 3:\n\nP(3) = 500 * e^(0.05 * 3)\nP(3) ≈ 500 * e^0.15\nP(3) ≈ 500 * 1.1618\nP(3) ≈ 580.9\n\nAfter 3 months, the rabbit population will be approximately 580.9 rabbits. Since we cannot have a fraction of a rabbit, we can round up to 581 rabbits."
