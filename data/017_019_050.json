    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order of the group: 36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups: For each prime factor p, we can have a group of order p^n, where n is the exponent of p in the prime factorization. For 2^2, we have two possibilities: 2^2 or 2 * 2. For 3^2, we have two possibilities: 3^2 or 3 * 3. Combining these possibilities, we have 2 * 2 = 4 abelian groups: Z_36, Z_18 x Z_2, Z_9 x Z_4, and Z_6 x Z_6.\n\n3. Determine the number of possible non-abelian groups: To do this, we can use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 36, and let n_p be the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G.\n\n- For p = 2, by Sylow's third theorem, n_2 must divide 3^2 = 9, and n_2 must be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal in G. If n_2 = 9, then there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal in G.\n- For p = 3, by Sylow's third theorem, n_3 must divide 2^2 = 4, and n_3 must be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G. If n_3 = 4, then there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and none of them are normal in G.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of n_2 and n_3:\n\n- If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, both of which are normal. In this case, G is the direct product of these subgroups, and G is abelian (already counted in step 2).\n- If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup, and G is a semi-direct product of this subgroup with a Sylow 3-subgroup. There is only one non-abelian group in this case: the semi-direct product of Z_4 and Z_9, which is isomorphic to the group of upper triangular 3x3 matrices over the field with 3 elements (GL(3,3)).\n- If n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup, and G is a semi-direct product of this subgroup with a Sylow 2-subgroup. There is only one non-abelian group in this case: the semi-direct product of Z_9 and Z_4, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_18.\n- If n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4, then G has no normal Sylow subgroups, and G is not a semi-direct product of its Sylow subgroups. There are no non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 4 abelian groups and 2 non-abelian groups, giving a total of 4 + 2 = 6 non-isomorphic groups of order 36."
