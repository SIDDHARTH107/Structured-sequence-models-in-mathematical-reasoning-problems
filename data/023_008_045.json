    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of f(x), we first need to make f(x) a periodic function. We can do this by extending f(x) periodically with period 2. Now, let's find the Fourier series representation of the periodic extension of f(x):\n\nThe Fourier series of a function g(x) with period 2L is given by:\n\ng(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients and are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] g(x) dx\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] g(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] g(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nIn our case, L = 1, so the Fourier series representation of the periodic extension of f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx) + b_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n:\n\na_0 = (1/1) * ∫[-1, 1] f(x) dx\na_0 = ∫[-1, 1] x dx\na_0 = [x^2/2](-1 to 1) = (1/2 - (-1/2)) = 0\n\na_n = (1/1) * ∫[-1, 1] f(x) * cos(nπx) dx\na_n = ∫[-1, 1] x * cos(nπx) dx\na_n = 0 (since the integrand is an odd function)\n\nb_n = (1/1) * ∫[-1, 1] f(x) * sin(nπx) dx\nb_n = ∫[-1, 1] x * sin(nπx) dx\nb_n = [(-1/(nπ)) * x * cos(nπx)](-1 to 1) - ∫[-1, 1] (-1/(nπ)) * cos(nπx) dx\nb_n = (-1/(nπ)) * (cos(nπ) - (-cos(-nπ))) = 0 (since cos(nπ) = cos(-nπ))\n\nSo, all the Fourier coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n are 0. This means that the periodic extension of f(x) cannot be represented as a Fourier series. This is because f(x) is not continuous at x = -1 and x = 1, and the discontinuities cause the Fourier series to fail to converge to the original function at those points."
