    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot oligopoly consisting of two firms. Their marginal cost functions are given by MC1(q1) = 2q1 and MC2(q2) = 3q2, respectively. The market demand function is given by P (Q) = 20−Q, where Q = q1 + q2 is the total quantity produced by both firms. Find the Cournot-Nash equilibrium quantities and profits for each firm in this market.",
    "message_2": "To find the Cournot-Nash equilibrium quantities and profits for each firm, we first need to find the reaction functions for each firm. The reaction function shows the optimal quantity produced by a firm given the quantity produced by the other firm.\n\nLet's start with firm 1. Firm 1's profit function is given by:\n\nπ1(q1, q2) = P(Q) * q1 - C1(q1)\n\nwhere C1(q1) is the cost function for firm 1. To find C1(q1), we integrate the marginal cost function MC1(q1):\n\nC1(q1) = ∫ MC1(q1) dq1 = ∫ 2q1 dq1 = q1^2 + C\n\nSince there is no fixed cost, C = 0, and the cost function is:\n\nC1(q1) = q1^2\n\nNow we can write the profit function for firm 1:\n\nπ1(q1, q2) = (20 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 - q1^2\n\nTo find the reaction function, we need to maximize the profit function with respect to q1. We do this by taking the first-order derivative of the profit function with respect to q1 and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndπ1/dq1 = -2q1 + 20 - q2 - q1 = 0\n\nSolving for q1, we get the reaction function for firm 1:\n\nq1 = (20 - q2)/3\n\nNow we do the same for firm 2. The cost function for firm 2 is:\n\nC2(q2) = ∫ MC2(q2) dq2 = ∫ 3q2 dq2 = (3/2)q2^2\n\nThe profit function for firm 2 is:\n\nπ2(q1, q2) = P(Q) * q2 - C2(q2) = (20 - (q1 + q2)) * q2 - (3/2)q2^2\n\nTaking the first-order derivative with respect to q2 and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndπ2/dq2 = -3q2 + 20 - q1 - q2 = 0\n\nSolving for q2, we get the reaction function for firm 2:\n\nq2 = (20 - q1)/4\n\nNow we have the reaction functions for both firms:\n\nq1 = (20 - q2)/3\nq2 = (20 - q1)/4\n\nTo find the Cournot-Nash equilibrium quantities, we need to solve this system of equations. We can substitute the expression for q2 from the second equation into the first equation:\n\nq1 = (20 - ((20 - q1)/4))/3\n\nSolving for q1:\n\nq1 = (80 - 5q1)/12\n12q1 = 80 - 5q1\n17q1 = 80\nq1 = 80/17 ≈ 4.71\n\nNow we can find q2:\n\nq2 = (20 - q1)/4\nq2 = (20 - 80/17)/4\nq2 = (60/17)/4\nq2 = 60/68 ≈ 0.88\n\nSo the Cournot-Nash equilibrium quantities are q1 ≈ 4.71 and q2 ≈ 0.88.\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium prices and profits for each firm. The market price is:\n\nP(Q) = 20 - (q1 + q2) = 20 - (4.71 + 0.88) ≈ 14.41\n\nFirm 1's profit is:\n\nπ1 = P(Q) * q1 - C1(q1) = 14.41 * 4.71 - 4.71^2 ≈ 47.87\n\nFirm 2's profit is:\n\nπ2 = P(Q) * q2 - C2(q2) = 14.41 * 0.88 - (3/2) * 0.88^2 ≈ 8.97\n\nSo the Cournot-Nash equilibrium profits are approximately 47.87 for firm 1 and 8.97 for firm 2."
