Determine whether or not G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, or one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120? If so, provide a proof of the isomorphism. If not, explain why the group G cannot be isomorphic to any of these groups.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of these groups, we can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of G.\n\nRecall that the order of G is 120, which can be factored as 2^3 * 3 * 5. Thus, we can apply the Sylow theorems to the Sylow p-subgroups of G for primes p = 2, 3, and 5.\n\n1. For p = 2, by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 * 5 = 15, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. If n_2 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8, which is normal in G.\n\n2. For p = 3, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^3 * 5 = 40, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4. If n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, which is normal in G.\n\n3. For p = 5, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 2^3 * 3 = 24, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6. If n_5 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5, which is normal in G.\n\nNow, we analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, then G is a direct product of these subgroups, and G is isomorphic to C8 × C3 × C5, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C120.\n\n- If G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, but not a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, then G is a semidirect product of the form (C8 × C3) ⋊ C5. In this case, G is not isomorphic to C120 or A5 × C2 × C2, but it could be one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\n- If G does not have a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, then G cannot be isomorphic to C120 or A5 × C2 × C2, but it could be one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nIn conclusion, G could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C120, or it could be one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120. However, G cannot be isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, as this group has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, but not a unique Sylow 3-subgroup."
