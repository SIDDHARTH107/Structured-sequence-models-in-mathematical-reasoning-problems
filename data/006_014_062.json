    "message_1": "A system has 8 components, each with a 10% probability of failing. What is the probability that at least one component will fail?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one component will fail, it's easier to first find the probability that none of the components will fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single component will not fail is 90% or 0.9 (since there's a 10% chance it will fail). Since the components are independent, the probability that all 8 components will not fail is:\n\n0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.9^8 ≈ 0.43046721\n\nNow, subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that at least one component will fail:\n\n1 - 0.43046721 ≈ 0.56953279\n\nSo, the probability that at least one component will fail is approximately 56.95%."
