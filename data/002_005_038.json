    "message_1": "What is the length of the diagonal in a rectangular prism with dimensions 6 cm x 8 cm x 10 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal in a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides (a, b, and c).\n\nd^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2\n\nIn this case, the dimensions of the rectangular prism are 6 cm x 8 cm x 10 cm, so a = 6, b = 8, and c = 10.\n\nd^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 + 10^2\nd^2 = 36 + 64 + 100\nd^2 = 200\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the diagonal:\n\nd = √200\nd ≈ 14.14 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal in the rectangular prism is approximately 14.14 cm."
