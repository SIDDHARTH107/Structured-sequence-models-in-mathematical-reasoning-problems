    "message_2": "To find the other number, we can use the formula for LCM (Least Common Multiple):\n\nLCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)\n\nwhere a and b are the two numbers, and GCD(a, b) is their greatest common divisor.\n\nWe are given that LCM(a, b) = 120 and one of the numbers is 24, so a = 24. We need to find the other number, b.\n\nFirst, let's find the GCD(24, b). The prime factors of 24 are 2, 2, 2, and 3. Since we don't know the prime factors of b yet, let's represent the GCD as the product of the common prime factors of 24 and b:\n\nGCD(24, b) = 2^x * 3^y\n\nwhere x and y are the exponents of the common prime factors 2 and 3 in the prime factorization of b.\n\nNow we can use the LCM formula:\n\n120 = (24 * b) / (2^x * 3^y)\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for b:\n\nb = (120 * 2^x * 3^y) / 24\n\nSince 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\nb = (2^3 * 3 * 5 * 2^x * 3^y) / 24\n\nb = (2^(3+x) * 3^(1+y) * 5) / (2^3 * 3)\n\nNow we can cancel out the common factors:\n\nb = 2^x * 3^y * 5\n\nSince b must be an integer, the only possible values for x and y are 0 and 1. If x = 0 and y = 0, then b = 5, which doesn't give us an LCM of 120. If x = 1 and y = 0, then b = 2 * 5 = 10, which does give us an LCM of 120.\n\nTherefore, the other number is 10."
