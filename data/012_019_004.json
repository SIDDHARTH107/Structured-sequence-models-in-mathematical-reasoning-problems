    "message_2": "To find the chromatic index of the given graph, we need to color the edges using the minimum number of colors such that no two adjacent edges have the same color. Let's label the edges as follows:\n\n```\n   1 --- 2\n  /|\\   /|\\\n 3 | \\ / | 4\n  \\|  X  |/\n   5 --- 6\n```\n\nEdges: e1(1-2), e2(1-3), e3(1-4), e4(1-5), e5(1-6), e6(2-3), e7(2-4), e8(2-5), e9(2-6), e10(3-4), e11(3-5), e12(3-6), e13(4-5), e14(4-6), e15(5-6)\n\nNow, let's color the edges:\n\n1. Color e1 with color A: A(1-2)\n2. Color e6 with color A: A(2-3)\n3. Color e11 with color A: A(3-5)\n4. Color e15 with color A: A(5-6)\n5. Color e9 with color A: A(2-6)\n6. Color e14 with color A: A(4-6)\n\nNow, we need to use a new color for the remaining edges:\n\n7. Color e2 with color B: B(1-3)\n8. Color e7 with color B: B(2-4)\n9. Color e12 with color B: B(3-6)\n10. Color e4 with color B: B(1-5)\n11. Color e13 with color B: B(4-5)\n\nFinally, we need a third color for the last two edges:\n\n12. Color e3 with color C: C(1-4)\n13. Color e10 with color C: C(3-4)\n14. Color e5 with color C: C(1-6)\n15. Color e8 with color C: C(2-5)\n\nSo, the chromatic index of the given graph is 3, as we used three colors (A, B, and C) to color the edges such that no two adjacent edges have the same color."
