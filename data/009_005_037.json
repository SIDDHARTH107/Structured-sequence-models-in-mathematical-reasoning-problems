    "message_2": "To find the current in the circuit when the capacitor is fully charged, we need to first find the impedance of the circuit. The impedance (Z) of a series RLC circuit is given by the formula:\n\nZ = √(R^2 + (XL - XC)^2)\n\nwhere R is the resistance, XL is the inductive reactance, and XC is the capacitive reactance.\n\nFirst, let's find the inductive reactance (XL) and capacitive reactance (XC).\n\nXL = 2 * π * f * L\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * f * C)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, L is the inductance, and C is the capacitance.\n\nGiven values:\nf = 50 Hz\nL = 0.1 H\nC = 0.001 F\n\nNow, let's calculate XL and XC:\n\nXL = 2 * π * 50 * 0.1 = 31.42 ohms\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * 50 * 0.001) = 3.18 ohms\n\nNow, we can find the impedance (Z):\n\nZ = √(R^2 + (XL - XC)^2)\nZ = √(10^2 + (31.42 - 3.18)^2)\nZ = √(100 + (28.24)^2)\nZ = √(100 + 797.5)\nZ = √897.5\nZ ≈ 29.96 ohms\n\nNow that we have the impedance, we can find the current (I) using Ohm's Law:\n\nI = V / Z\n\nwhere V is the voltage.\n\nGiven value:\nV = 20V\n\nNow, let's calculate the current (I):\n\nI = 20 / 29.96\nI ≈ 0.67 A\n\nSo, the current in the circuit when the capacitor is fully charged is approximately 0.67 A."
