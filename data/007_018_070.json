    "message_2": "A prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest prime gap between two consecutive primes greater than 10,000, we need to find the first pair of primes greater than 10,000 with the smallest difference.\n\nThe first few prime numbers greater than 10,000 are: 10007, 10009, 10037, 10039, and so on.\n\nThe smallest prime gap between two consecutive primes greater than 10,000 is between 10007 and 10009, with a difference of 2."
