    "message_2": "To find the expected number of people to be elected as president out of 5000, we can multiply the total number of people (5000) by the probability of being elected (0.003).\n\nExpected number of people = 5000 * 0.003 = 15\n\nSo, out of 5000 people, 15 are expected to be elected as the president in the upcoming election."
