    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1 on the interval [-3, 5], we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to 0.\n2. Determine the end points of the interval.\n3. Evaluate the function at the critical points and end points.\n4. Compare the values to find the maximum and minimum.\n\nStep 1: Find the critical points\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nSetting f'(x) = 0:\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nFactoring:\n3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0\n3(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nStep 2: Determine the end points of the interval\nThe end points of the interval are x = -3 and x = 5.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the function at the critical points and end points\nf(-3) = (-3)^3 - 6(-3)^2 + 9(-3) + 1 = -27 - 54 - 27 + 1 = -107\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 1 = 1 - 6 + 9 + 1 = 5\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 1 = 27 - 54 + 27 + 1 = 1\nf(5) = (5)^3 - 6(5)^2 + 9(5) + 1 = 125 - 150 + 45 + 1 = 21\n\nStep 4: Compare the values to find the maximum and minimum\nf(-3) = -107\nf(1) = 5\nf(3) = 1\nf(5) = 21\n\nThe maximum value of the function on the interval [-3, 5] is 21 at x = 5, and the minimum value is -107 at x = -3."
