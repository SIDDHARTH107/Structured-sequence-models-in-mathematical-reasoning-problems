    "message_2": "To show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, we will use the Sylow Theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 25, we can write it as 5^2. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_5 divides the order of G, so n_5 divides 25.\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nThe possible divisors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25. The only divisor that satisfies both conditions is n_5 = 1. This means that there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup in G, which we will call P.\n\nSince P is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be normal in G. The order of P is 5, which is a prime number, so P is a cyclic group. Let a be a generator of P, so P = ⟨a⟩.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/P. Since the order of G is 25 and the order of P is 5, the order of G/P is 25/5 = 5. Since 5 is a prime number, G/P is a cyclic group. Let bP be a generator of G/P, where b is an element of G.\n\nNow, we will show that G is generated by a and b. Let g be an arbitrary element of G. Since G/P is generated by bP, we can write gP = (bP)^k for some integer k. This means that gP = b^kP, so g and b^k belong to the same coset of P in G. Thus, g = b^k * p for some p in P.\n\nSince P is generated by a, we can write p = a^j for some integer j. Therefore, g = b^k * a^j, which shows that G is generated by a and b.\n\nNow, we will show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. Since G is generated by a and b, we have two cases:\n\n1. The order of the element ab is 25. In this case, G is cyclic, generated by the element ab.\n\n2. The order of the element ab is not 25. In this case, the order of ab must be a divisor of 25, which means it must be 1 or 5. Since a and b have order 5, the order of ab cannot be 1. Therefore, the order of ab must be 5. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, generated by a and b.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
