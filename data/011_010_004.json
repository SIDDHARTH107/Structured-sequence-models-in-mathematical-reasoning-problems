    "message_1": "Suppose you have a regular polygon with 10 sides. In how many ways can you draw non-intersecting diagonals such that they do not intersect inside the polygon?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Catalan numbers. The number of ways to draw non-intersecting diagonals in a convex polygon with n+2 sides is given by the nth Catalan number, which is defined as:\n\nC_n = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n)\n\nIn this case, we have a regular polygon with 10 sides, so n = 10 - 2 = 8. Now, we can calculate the 8th Catalan number:\n\nC_8 = (1/(8+1)) * (2*8 choose 8)\nC_8 = (1/9) * (16 choose 8)\nC_8 = (1/9) * 12,870\n\nC_8 = 1,430\n\nSo, there are 1,430 ways to draw non-intersecting diagonals in a regular polygon with 10 sides such that they do not intersect inside the polygon."
