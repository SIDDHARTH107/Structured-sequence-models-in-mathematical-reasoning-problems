    "message_2": "To show that ¬(p ∧ ¬p) is not provable in intuitionistic logic, we can use the fact that intuitionistic logic is sound with respect to the Kripke semantics. In Kripke semantics, a formula is valid if it is true in every Kripke model. If we can find a Kripke model where ¬(p ∧ ¬p) is not true, then it cannot be provable in intuitionistic logic.\n\nConsider a Kripke model with two worlds, w1 and w2, and an accessibility relation R such that w1Rw2. Let the valuation function V be defined as follows:\n\nV(p, w1) = 0 (false)\nV(p, w2) = 1 (true)\n\nNow, let's evaluate ¬(p ∧ ¬p) in both worlds:\n\n1. In w1:\n- V(p, w1) = 0\n- V(¬p, w1) = 1 (since p is false in w1)\n- V(p ∧ ¬p, w1) = 0 (since both p and ¬p cannot be true at the same time)\n- V(¬(p ∧ ¬p), w1) = 1 (since p ∧ ¬p is false in w1)\n\n2. In w2:\n- V(p, w2) = 1\n- V(¬p, w2) = 0 (since p is true in w2)\n- V(p ∧ ¬p, w2) = 0 (since both p and ¬p cannot be true at the same time)\n- V(¬(p ∧ ¬p), w2) = 1 (since p ∧ ¬p is false in w2)\n\nIn both worlds, ¬(p ∧ ¬p) evaluates to true. However, this does not mean that ¬(p ∧ ¬p) is provable in intuitionistic logic. In Kripke semantics, a formula is valid if it is true in every Kripke model and forced in every world of the model.\n\nIn our model, ¬(p ∧ ¬p) is not forced in w1, because there is an accessible world w2 where p is true. In other words, we cannot prove that ¬(p ∧ ¬p) holds in w1 without knowing the truth value of p in w2.\n\nSince ¬(p ∧ ¬p) is not forced in every world of the Kripke model, it is not provable in intuitionistic logic."
