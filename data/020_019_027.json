    "message_1": "A rocket is launched into space and its height (in meters) above the ground at time t (in seconds) is given by the function h(t) = -0.15t^3 + 18t^2 + 200. The rocket's maximum altitude can be determined by finding the maximum value of h(t) over the interval [0, 40]. Determine the maximum altitude reached by the rocket and at what time it reaches that altitude.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum altitude reached by the rocket, we need to find the maximum value of the function h(t) = -0.15t^3 + 18t^2 + 200 over the interval [0, 40]. To do this, we can find the critical points of the function by taking the first derivative and setting it equal to 0.\n\nThe first derivative of h(t) is:\nh'(t) = -0.45t^2 + 36t\n\nNow, set h'(t) equal to 0 and solve for t:\n-0.45t^2 + 36t = 0\n\nFactor out a t:\nt(-0.45t + 36) = 0\n\nSo, t = 0 or -0.45t + 36 = 0.\n\nSolve for t in the second equation:\n-0.45t + 36 = 0\n-0.45t = -36\nt = 80\n\nSince the interval we are considering is [0, 40], we can ignore the t = 80 solution. Now we need to check the endpoints of the interval and the critical point t = 0 to find the maximum value of h(t).\n\nh(0) = -0.15(0)^3 + 18(0)^2 + 200 = 200\nh(40) = -0.15(40)^3 + 18(40)^2 + 200 = -38400 + 28800 + 200 = -9400 (This is a negative value, so the rocket has already landed at this point)\n\nSince h(0) = 200 and h(40) is negative, the maximum altitude must occur at some point between 0 and 40. Since t = 0 is the only critical point in the interval, we can conclude that the maximum altitude is reached at t = 0 seconds, and the maximum altitude is 200 meters."
