    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x and y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4  2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 7 |\n    | 8 |\n\nNow, we find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant of A = (2 * 2) - (3 * 4) = 4 - 12 = -8\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find the inverse using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/determinant) * adjoint(A)\n\nThe adjoint of A is obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nAdjoint(A) = |  2  -3 |\n                     | -4   2 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-8) * |  2  -3 |\n                          | -4   2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | -1/4   3/8  |\n             |  1/2  -1/4 |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = | -1/4   3/8  | * | 7 |\n        |  1/2  -1/4 |   | 8 |\n\nX = | (-1/4 * 7) + (3/8 * 8) |\n        |  (1/2 * 7) - (1/4 * 8) |\n\nX = | -7/4 + 3 |\n        |  7/2 - 2 |\n\nX = | 1/4 |\n        | 3/2 |\n\nSo, the values of x and y are:\n\nx = 1/4\ny = 3/2"
