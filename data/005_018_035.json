    "message_1": "Suppose a medical study is conducted on a new drug to determine how long it takes for the drug to show negative side effects in patients. The study includes 50 patients who have been taking the drug for varying lengths of time. The following data shows the time in months each patient has been taking the drug before experiencing negative side effects: \n\n7, 14, 8, 15, 6, 12, 10, 9, 13, 11, 5, 16, 4, 20, 18, 2, 3, 17, 21, 19, 22, 26, 25, 27, 24, 23, 28, 29, 32, 33, 31, 30, 35, 36, 38, 40, 37, 42, 47, 50, 45, 41, 55, 60, 58, 57, 53, 54, 59, 56, 51, 48, 49\n\nFind the median time when the patients show negative side effects due to the drug.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to sort the data in ascending order:\n\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60\n\nSince there are 50 data points (an even number), the median will be the average of the 25th and 26th data points.\n\nThe 25th data point is 26, and the 26th data point is 27.\n\nSo, the median time when the patients show negative side effects due to the drug is (26 + 27) / 2 = 26.5 months."
