    "message_1": "A student is planning a road trip and wants to calculate the probability of encountering at least one flat tire during the trip. They know that the probability of encountering a flat tire on any given day of driving is 0.05. If the road trip is 10 days long, what is the probability of encountering at least one flat tire during the entire trip?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of encountering at least one flat tire during the entire trip, we can use the complementary probability rule. This means we will first find the probability of not encountering a flat tire on any day of the trip and then subtract that probability from 1.\n\nThe probability of not encountering a flat tire on any given day is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor a 10-day trip, the probability of not encountering a flat tire on any day of the trip is 0.95^10 (since the events are independent).\n\n0.95^10 ≈ 0.5987\n\nNow, we will find the complementary probability, which is the probability of encountering at least one flat tire during the entire trip:\n\n1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013\n\nSo, the probability of encountering at least one flat tire during the 10-day trip is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
