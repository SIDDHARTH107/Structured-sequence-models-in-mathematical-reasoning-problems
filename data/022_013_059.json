    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function $f(z) = e^{z^2 + 5z}$, we can use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a function $g(z) = h(k(z))$, then the derivative of $g(z)$ with respect to $z$ is given by $g'(z) = h'(k(z)) \\cdot k'(z)$.\n\nIn our case, we have $h(z) = e^z$ and $k(z) = z^2 + 5z$. The derivatives of these functions are:\n\n$h'(z) = e^z$ (since the derivative of $e^z$ is itself)\n\n$k'(z) = 2z + 5$ (using basic rules of differentiation)\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule to find the derivative of $f(z)$:\n\n$f'(z) = h'(k(z)) \\cdot k'(z) = e^{z^2 + 5z} \\cdot (2z + 5)$\n\nNow, we want to find the value of $f'(-2)$:\n\n$f'(-2) = e^{(-2)^2 + 5(-2)} \\cdot (2(-2) + 5) = e^{4 - 10} \\cdot (-4 + 5) = e^{-6} \\cdot 1 = e^{-6}$\n\nSo, the value of $f'(-2)$ is $e^{-6}$."
