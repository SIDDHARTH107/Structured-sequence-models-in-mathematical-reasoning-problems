    "message_2": "To compute the number of non-zero magnitude coefficients after applying the two-dimensional Fourier transform to the image, we need to consider the dimensions of the image.\n\nThe image has 512 columns and 256 rows, so there are a total of 512 x 256 = 131,072 pixels in the image. When we apply the two-dimensional Fourier transform, we will obtain a frequency domain representation of the image with the same dimensions, i.e., 512 x 256 complex Fourier coefficients.\n\nNow, the magnitude of the complex Fourier coefficients represents the contribution of each frequency component to the image. In general, there is no guarantee that any of these coefficients will be zero, as the image may contain various frequency components. Therefore, we can assume that all 131,072 coefficients have non-zero magnitudes.\n\nSo, there are 131,072 non-zero magnitude coefficients after applying the two-dimensional Fourier transform to the image."
