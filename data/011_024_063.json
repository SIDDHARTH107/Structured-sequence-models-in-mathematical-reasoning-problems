    "message_1": "A company needs to transport 500 units of goods from its warehouse to a particular location. There are three different transportation routes available, each with its own capacity limit: route 1 can transport 200 units, route 2 can transport 300 units, and route 3 can transport 400 units. The cost of transportation per unit along the three routes is $5, $4 and $6 respectively. What is the minimum cost of transporting 500 units of goods? Create a network flow diagram for this problem.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of transporting 500 units of goods, we need to find the optimal distribution of goods across the three routes. Let's denote the amount of goods transported through each route as x1, x2, and x3 for routes 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\nConstraints:\n1. x1 + x2 + x3 = 500 (Total units to be transported)\n2. x1 ≤ 200 (Capacity of route 1)\n3. x2 ≤ 300 (Capacity of route 2)\n4. x3 ≤ 400 (Capacity of route 3)\n\nObjective function (Cost): Minimize C = 5x1 + 4x2 + 6x3\n\nTo minimize the cost, we should prioritize the route with the lowest cost per unit, which is route 2. We will transport as many goods as possible through route 2, up to its capacity.\n\nx2 = 300\n\nNow, we have 200 units left to transport (500 - 300). We will use route 1 for the remaining units since it has a lower cost per unit than route 3.\n\nx1 = 200\nx3 = 0\n\nNow, let's calculate the minimum cost:\n\nC = 5(200) + 4(300) + 6(0) = 1000 + 1200 = $2200\n\nThe minimum cost of transporting 500 units of goods is $2200.\n\nNetwork flow diagram:\n\n```\n+------+      200      +------+\n|      |-------------->|      |\n|Warehouse|      300      |Location|\n|      |-------------->|      |\n+------+      400      +------+\n  x1=200        x2=300    x3=0\n```\n\nIn this diagram, the arrows represent the three routes, and the numbers above the arrows represent the capacity of each route.
