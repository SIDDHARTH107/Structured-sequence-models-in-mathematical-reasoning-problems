    "message_2": "The treewidth of a graph is the minimum width of a tree decomposition of the graph. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices of the graph, and the tree satisfies the following properties:\n\n1. The union of all bags contains all vertices of the graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there is a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the graph, the bags containing v form a connected subtree.\n\nTo find the treewidth of the given graph, we can try to find a tree decomposition with the minimum width. The width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus one.\n\nHere is one possible tree decomposition for the given graph:\n\n```\n    {A, B, D}\n   /    |    \\\n{A, C, D} {B, D, E} {D, F, G}\n```\n\nEach bag has three vertices, so the width of this tree decomposition is 3 - 1 = 2. We cannot find a tree decomposition with a smaller width, so the treewidth of the given graph is 2."
