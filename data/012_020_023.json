    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of the vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. In other words, it is a bijective function that maps the vertices of the graph to themselves such that the edge structure is preserved.\n\nIn this graph, we can observe the following automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself.\n2. A reflection along the horizontal axis, which swaps vertices A and F, B and E, and leaves C and D unchanged.\n3. A reflection along the vertical axis, which swaps vertices A and B, E and F, and leaves C and D unchanged.\n4. A 180-degree rotation, which swaps vertices A and E, B and F, and leaves C and D unchanged.\n\nThese are the only automorphisms that preserve the edge structure of the graph. Therefore, the size of the automorphism group of this graph is 4."
