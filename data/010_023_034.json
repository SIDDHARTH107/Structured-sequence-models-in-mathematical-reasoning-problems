    "message_2": "The given knot diagram represents the trefoil knot, which is the simplest nontrivial knot. To determine the genus of a knot, we can use the formula:\n\ngenus = (crossing number - 1) / 2\n\nThe trefoil knot has a crossing number of 3 (there are three crossings in the diagram). Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\ngenus = (3 - 1) / 2\ngenus = 2 / 2\ngenus = 1\n\nSo, the genus of the trefoil knot is 1."
