    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 + 3x - 5, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x. \n\n0 = 2x^2 + 3x - 5\n\nNow, we can either factor the quadratic or use the quadratic formula to solve for x. In this case, the quadratic does not factor easily, so we will use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 2, b = 3, and c = -5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(3) ± √((3)^2 - 4(2)(-5))) / 2(2)\n\nx = (-3 ± √(9 + 40)) / 4\n\nx = (-3 ± √49) / 4\n\nx = (-3 ± 7) / 4\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (-3 + 7) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1\n\nx = (-3 - 7) / 4 = -10 / 4 = -5/2\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 + 3x - 5 are x = 1 and x = -5/2."
