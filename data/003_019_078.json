    "message_2": "To find the definite integral of the function f(x) = sin(2x) from 0 to π/4, we first need to find the antiderivative of sin(2x) with respect to x.\n\nThe antiderivative of sin(2x) is:\n\n∫sin(2x) dx = (-1/2)cos(2x) + C\n\nNow, we will evaluate the definite integral from 0 to π/4:\n\n(-1/2)cos(2(π/4)) - (-1/2)cos(2(0))\n\n= (-1/2)cos(π) - (-1/2)cos(0)\n\n= (-1/2)(-1) - (-1/2)(1)\n\n= 1/2 + 1/2\n\n= 1\n\nSo, the definite integral of the function f(x) = sin(2x) from 0 to π/4 is 1."
