Show that A × B is not equal to B × A.\n\nNote: A × B means the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of set A and b is an element of set B. Similarly, B × A means the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is an element of set B and a is an element of set A.",
    "message_2": "1. A × B (Cartesian product of A and B)\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\n2. B × A (Cartesian product of B and A)\n\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\n3. Show that A × B is not equal to B × A.\n\nTo show that A × B is not equal to B × A, we can simply compare the elements of both sets. If there is at least one element in A × B that is not in B × A, or vice versa, then the two sets are not equal.\n\nFrom the sets we found above, we can see that the ordered pair (1, 4) is in A × B but not in B × A, and the ordered pair (4, 1) is in B × A but not in A × B. This shows that A × B is not equal to B × A."
