    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. We will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first and second equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 1, so that the coefficients of z in both equations are equal:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n8x + 12y + 4z = 40\\\\\nx - 2y + 4z = -4\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n$$\n(8x + 12y + 4z) - (x - 2y + 4z) = 40 - (-4)\n$$\n\n$$\n7x + 14y = 44\n$$\n\nNext, let's eliminate z from the first and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by -1 and the third equation by 1, so that the coefficients of z in both equations are equal:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-2x - 3y - z = -10\\\\\n3x + y - z = 6\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow, add the first equation to the third equation:\n\n$$\n(-2x - 3y - z) + (3x + y - z) = -10 + 6\n$$\n\n$$\nx - 2y = -4\n$$\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n7x + 14y = 44\\\\\nx - 2y = -4\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nTo eliminate y, we can multiply the second equation by 7:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n7x + 14y = 44\\\\\n7x - 14y = -28\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow, add the first equation to the second equation:\n\n$$\n(7x + 14y) + (7x - 14y) = 44 + (-28)\n$$\n\n$$\n14x = 16\n$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by 14:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{16}{14} = \\frac{8}{7}\n$$\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into the equation x - 2y = -4:\n\n$$\n\\frac{8}{7} - 2y = -4\n$$\n\nAdd -8/7 to both sides:\n\n$$\n-2y = -\\frac{36}{7}\n$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by -2:\n\n$$\ny = \\frac{18}{7}\n$$\n\nFinally, substitute the values of x and y back into any of the original equations to find the value of z. We will use the first equation:\n\n$$\n2x + 3y + z = 10\n$$\n\n$$\n2\\left(\\frac{8}{7}\\right) + 3\\left(\\frac{18}{7}\\right) + z = 10\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{16}{7} + \\frac{54}{7} + z = 10\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{70}{7} + z = 10\n$$\n\nSubtract 70/7 from both sides:\n\n$$\nz = 10 - \\frac{70}{7} = \\frac{20}{7}\n$$\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{8}{7},\\ y = \\frac{18}{7},\\ z = \\frac{20}{7}\n$$"
