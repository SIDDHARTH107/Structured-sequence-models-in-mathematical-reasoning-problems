    "message_2": "Let's explore the elements in the set S by applying the given rules:\n\n1. Since 1 is in S, we can apply rule b: 3(1) + 2 = 5, so 5 is in S.\n2. Since 5 is in S and not equal to 1, we can apply rule c: 5 - 1 = 4, so 4 is in S.\n3. Since 4 is in S, we can apply rule b: 3(4) + 2 = 14, so 14 is in S.\n4. Since 14 is in S and not equal to 1, we can apply rule c: 14 - 1 = 13, so 13 is in S.\n5. Since 13 is in S, we can apply rule b: 3(13) + 2 = 41, so 41 is in S.\n6. Since 41 is in S and not equal to 1, we can apply rule c: 41 - 1 = 40, so 40 is in S.\n7. Since 40 is in S, we can apply rule b: 3(40) + 2 = 122, so 122 is in S.\n\nWe can continue this process, but it's clear that the set S will contain all odd numbers (since rule b generates an odd number from any number in S) and all numbers that are one less than a multiple of 3 (since rule c generates a number one less than the current number in S).\n\nNow, let's look for the smallest natural number not in S. The first few natural numbers are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...\n\nWe can see that 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, ... are in S. The smallest natural number not in S is 2, since it doesn't fit the rules for being in S. Therefore, the smallest natural number not in S is 2."
