    "message_2": "To calculate the Tutte polynomial of a graph G, we use the formula T_G(x, y) = T_G'(x, y) + T_G''(x, y), where G' is the graph obtained by deleting an edge e from G, and G'' is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e in G. We will use the recursive definition of the Tutte polynomial:\n\nT_G(x, y) = x * T_G/e(x, y) + y * T_G\\{e}(x, y) if e is a bridge (cut-edge),\nT_G(x, y) = T_G/e(x, y) + T_G\\{e}(x, y) if e is not a bridge.\n\nHere, G/e denotes the graph obtained by contracting edge e, and G\\{e} denotes the graph obtained by deleting edge e.\n\nSince we don't have the specific graph, we cannot compute the exact Tutte polynomial. However, we can provide some general information about the Tutte polynomial for a graph with 5 vertices and 7 edges.\n\nLet G be a graph with 5 vertices and 7 edges. The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is 10 (complete graph K_5). Since G has 7 edges, it is not a complete graph, and there must be at least one non-bridge edge. Let e be a non-bridge edge in G.\n\nNow, we can apply the recursive definition of the Tutte polynomial:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_G/e(x, y) + T_G\\{e}(x, y)\n\nSince G/e is a graph with 4 vertices and 6 edges, and G\\{e} is a graph with 5 vertices and 6 edges, we can continue applying the recursive definition to these graphs. However, without the specific graph, we cannot compute the exact Tutte polynomial.\n\nIn general, the Tutte polynomial of a graph with 5 vertices and 7 edges can be computed using the recursive definition, but it requires knowledge of the specific graph structure."
