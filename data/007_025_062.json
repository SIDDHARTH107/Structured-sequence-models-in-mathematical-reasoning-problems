Alice chooses a large prime number p = 463 and a primitive root α = 3. Bob chooses a large prime number q = 197 and a primitive root β = 5. Alice's private key is x = 5, and Bob's private key is y = 7.\n\nWhat is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use?",
    "message_2": "To establish a shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, Alice and Bob will follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = α^x mod p, where α is the primitive root, x is Alice's private key, and p is the large prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = α^y mod p, where α is the primitive root, y is Bob's private key, and p is the large prime number.\n3. Alice and Bob exchange A and B.\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key as K = B^x mod p.\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key as K = A^y mod p.\n\nNow let's calculate the shared secret key:\n\n1. Alice computes A = 3^5 mod 463 = 243 mod 463 = 243.\n2. Bob computes B = 3^7 mod 463 = 2187 mod 463 = 33.\n3. Alice and Bob exchange A and B (Alice has 243 and Bob has 33).\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key as K = 33^5 mod 463 = 39135393 mod 463 = 99.\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key as K = 243^7 mod 463 = 22702052767843 mod 463 = 99.\n\nThe shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use is 99."
