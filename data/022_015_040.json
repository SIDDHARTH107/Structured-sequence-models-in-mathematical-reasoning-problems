Use the Schwarz reflection principle to find the unique function $F(z)$ that is analytic on the entire complex plane, except for a simple pole at $z = i$, and such that $F(z) - f(z)$ is bounded as $z$ approaches the real axis from above. Determine the residue of $F(z)$ at $z = i$.",
    "message_2": "To apply the Schwarz reflection principle, we first reflect the function $f(z)$ across the real axis. Let $g(z) = f(\\overline{z}) = \\frac{1}{\\overline{z} - i}$. Now, we define the function $F(z)$ as follows:\n\n$$F(z) = \\begin{cases}\nf(z), & \\text{if } \\operatorname{Im}(z) > 0 \\\\\ng(z), & \\text{if } \\operatorname{Im}(z) < 0\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nWe can rewrite $g(z)$ as $g(z) = \\frac{1}{\\overline{z} - i} = \\frac{z - i}{|z - i|^2}$. Thus, $F(z) = \\frac{z - i}{|z - i|^2}$ for $\\operatorname{Im}(z) < 0$. Note that $F(z)$ is analytic on the entire complex plane except for a simple pole at $z = i$.\n\nNow, we need to show that $F(z) - f(z)$ is bounded as $z$ approaches the real axis from above. As $z$ approaches the real axis from above, we have:\n\n$$F(z) - f(z) = f(z) - f(z) = 0$$\n\nwhich is clearly bounded. Therefore, $F(z)$ is the unique function that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nTo find the residue of $F(z)$ at $z = i$, we first rewrite $F(z)$ as:\n\n$$F(z) = \\frac{z - i}{(z - i)(\\overline{z} - i)} = \\frac{1}{\\overline{z} - i}$$\n\nNow, we can find the residue by taking the limit as $z$ approaches $i$:\n\n$$\\operatorname{Res}_{z=i} F(z) = \\lim_{z \\to i} (z - i) F(z) = \\lim_{z \\to i} \\frac{1}{\\overline{z} - i}$$\n\nSince the limit is taken as $z$ approaches $i$, we can replace $z$ with $i$:\n\n$$\\operatorname{Res}_{z=i} F(z) = \\frac{1}{\\overline{i} - i} = \\frac{1}{-i - i} = \\frac{1}{-2i} = -\\frac{1}{2}i$$\n\nTherefore, the residue of $F(z)$ at $z = i$ is $-\\frac{1}{2}i$."
