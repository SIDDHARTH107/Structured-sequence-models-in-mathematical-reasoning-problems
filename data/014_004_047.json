    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem related to elliptic curve cryptography:\n\nLet's say the equation of the elliptic curve used in a cryptographic system is y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 10 (mod 17), where \"mod 17\" means that all calculations are done within the finite field of integers modulo 17.\n\nGiven the private key k = 5, compute the corresponding public key (x, y).\n\nSolution: \n\nTo compute the public key, we need to multiply the base point (x0, y0) on the elliptic curve by the private key k. \n\nAssuming the base point is (2, 2) (in other words, we start with the point (2, 2) and keep adding it to itself k times), we get:\n\nk = 5\n(2, 2) + (2, 2) = (11, 6)\n(2, 2) + (11, 6) = (3, 9)\n(2, 2) + (3, 9) = (4, 13)\n(2, 2) + (4, 13) = (2, 15)\n(2, 2) + (2, 15) = (16, 3)\n\nTherefore, the public key is (16, 3).",
