    "message_1": "Consider the forced van der Pol oscillator described by the following second order differential equation:\n\nx'' + ε(x^2 − 1)x' + x = cos(t)\n\nwhere x represents the position of the oscillator, ε is a parameter that governs the strength of the nonlinear damping, and t represents time. \n\nSuppose ε = 0.1, x(0) = 1 and x'(0) = 0. Find the numerical solution of the system for 30 seconds using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of 0.01. Plot the time series of the solution and identify the periodic and aperiodic behavior.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given second-order differential equation using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we first need to convert it into a system of first-order differential equations. Let's define two new variables:\n\nv = x'\nw = v'\n\nNow, we have two first-order differential equations:\n\nx' = v\nv' = w = cos(t) - ε(x^2 - 1)v - x\n\nwith initial conditions x(0) = 1 and v(0) = 0. Now we can apply the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of 0.01.\n\nHere's a Python code to solve the system and plot the time series of the solution:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef van_der_pol(t, x, v, epsilon):\n    w = np.cos(t) - epsilon * (x**2 - 1) * v - x\n    return w\n\ndef runge_kutta(t, x, v, h, epsilon):\n    k1_x = h * v\n    k1_v = h * van_der_pol(t, x, v, epsilon)\n\n    k2_x = h * (v + 0.5 * k1_v)\n    k2_v = h * van_der_pol(t + 0.5 * h, x + 0.5 * k1_x, v + 0.5 * k1_v, epsilon)\n\n    k3_x = h * (v + 0.5 * k2_v)\n    k3_v = h * van_der_pol(t + 0.5 * h, x + 0.5 * k2_x, v + 0.5 * k2_v, epsilon)\n\n    k4_x = h * (v + k3_v)\n    k4_v = h * van_der_pol(t + h, x + k3_x, v + k3_v, epsilon)\n\n    x_new = x + (k1_x + 2 * k2_x + 2 * k3_x + k4_x) / 6\n    v_new = v + (k1_v + 2 * k2_v + 2 * k3_v + k4_v) / 6\n\n    return x_new, v_new\n\nepsilon = 0.1\nx0 = 1\nv0 = 0\nt0 = 0\ntf = 30\nh = 0.01\n\nt_values = np.arange(t0, tf, h)\nx_values = [x0]\nv_values = [v0]\n\nx = x0\nv = v0\nfor t in t_values[:-1]:\n    x, v = runge_kutta(t, x, v, h, epsilon)\n    x_values.append(x)\n    v_values.append(v)\n\nplt.plot(t_values, x_values)\nplt.xlabel('Time (t)')\nplt.ylabel('Position (x)')\nplt.title('Time Series of the Forced van der Pol Oscillator')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nRunning this code will generate a plot of the time series of the solution. The plot shows that the solution exhibits periodic behavior after an initial transient phase. The aperiodic behavior is observed during the transient phase, while the periodic behavior is observed after the system settles into a stable oscillation."
