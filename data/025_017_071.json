    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension 2 over $\\mathbb{C}$ with an ample class of $-K_X$. Suppose that the canonical class $K_X$ is represented by a smooth curve of genus $g \\geq 2$ and let $C$ be a nodal curve of arithmetic genus $p$ such that $p - g > 1$. Use the theory of minimal models to prove that there is a minimal resolution of $C \\subseteq X$. What is the total number of exceptional curves (i.e. the number of $-1$ curves) in the exceptional locus of this minimal resolution?",
    "message_2": "Let $\\pi: \\tilde{X} \\to X$ be the minimal resolution of the singularities of $C$. Since $X$ is a smooth surface, the exceptional locus of $\\pi$ is a collection of disjoint rational curves $E_1, \\dots, E_n$ with self-intersection $-1$. By the negativity lemma, we have that $\\pi^*K_X = K_{\\tilde{X}} + \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i E_i$ with $a_i \\ge 0$ for all $i$. \n\nNow, we have that $K_X$ is represented by a smooth curve of genus $g \\ge 2$. Since $-K_X$ is ample, we have that $K_X \\cdot C < 0$. By the projection formula, we have\n$$K_X \\cdot C = \\pi^*K_X \\cdot \\pi^*C = (K_{\\tilde{X}} + \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i E_i) \\cdot \\tilde{C},$$\nwhere $\\tilde{C}$ is the strict transform of $C$ in $\\tilde{X}$. \n\nSince $K_{\\tilde{X}} \\cdot \\tilde{C} \\ge 0$ and $a_i \\ge 0$ for all $i$, we must have that $K_{\\tilde{X}} \\cdot \\tilde{C} = 0$ and $a_i > 0$ for some $i$. This implies that $K_{\\tilde{X}}$ is numerically equivalent to an effective divisor, and thus $\\tilde{X}$ is a minimal model of $X$.\n\nNow, let's compute the total number of exceptional curves in the exceptional locus of this minimal resolution. By the genus formula, we have\n$$p_a(\\tilde{C}) - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\tilde{C} \\cdot (\\tilde{C} + K_{\\tilde{X}}),$$\nwhere $p_a(\\tilde{C})$ is the arithmetic genus of $\\tilde{C}$. Since $K_{\\tilde{X}} \\cdot \\tilde{C} = 0$, we get\n$$p_a(\\tilde{C}) - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\tilde{C}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (C^2 + 2n),$$\nwhere $n$ is the total number of exceptional curves.\n\nBy the genus formula for nodal curves, we have\n$$p - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} C^2.$$\n\nComparing the two equations, we get\n$$p - 1 = p_a(\\tilde{C}) - 1 - n \\Rightarrow n = p_a(\\tilde{C}) - p.$$\n\nSince $p_a(\\tilde{C}) \\ge g$ and $p - g > 1$, we have that $n = p_a(\\tilde{C}) - p \\ge g - p > 1 - p < 0$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no minimal resolution of $C \\subseteq X$ with the given conditions."
