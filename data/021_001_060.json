    "message_2": "First, we will rewrite the given system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n|  3   2  -1 |  1\n|  2  -2   4 | -2\n| -1  0.5 -1 |  0\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to transform the matrix into row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Swap row 1 and row 3 to have a non-zero pivot element in the first row:\n\n```\n| -1  0.5 -1 |  0\n|  2  -2   4 | -2\n|  3   2  -1 |  1\n```\n\nStep 2: Add 2 times row 1 to row 2 and 3 times row 1 to row 3:\n\n```\n| -1  0.5 -1 |  0\n|  0   -1   2 | -2\n|  0   3.5 -4 |  1\n```\n\nStep 3: Multiply row 2 by -1 to make the pivot element positive:\n\n```\n| -1  0.5 -1 |  0\n|  0   1  -2 |  2\n|  0   3.5 -4 |  1\n```\n\nStep 4: Subtract 3.5 times row 2 from row 3:\n\n```\n| -1  0.5 -1 |  0\n|  0   1  -2 |  2\n|  0   0   3 | -6\n```\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nStep 5: Divide row 3 by 3:\n\n```\n| -1  0.5 -1 |  0\n|  0   1  -2 |  2\n|  0   0   1 | -2\n```\n\nStep 6: Add 2 times row 3 to row 2 and row 3 to row 1:\n\n```\n| -1  0.5  0 | -2\n|  0   1   0 |  2\n|  0   0   1 | -2\n```\n\nStep 7: Add -0.5 times row 2 to row 1:\n\n```\n| -1   0   0 | -3\n|  0   1   0 |  2\n|  0   0   1 | -2\n```\n\nStep 8: Multiply row 1 by -1 to make the pivot element positive:\n\n```\n|  1   0   0 |  3\n|  0   1   0 |  2\n|  0   0   1 | -2\n```\n\nThe matrix is now in reduced row-echelon form, and we can read the solution directly:\n\nx = 3\ny = 2\nz = -2"
