    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle in the graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Let's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F, corresponding to the rows and columns in the adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix tells us which vertices are connected:\n\n```\n  A B C D E F\nA 0 1 1 0 0 0\nB 1 0 1 1 1 0\nC 1 1 0 0 1 1\nD 0 1 0 0 1 1\nE 0 1 1 1 0 1\nF 0 0 1 1 1 0\n```\n\nNow, let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph. We can start at vertex A and try to find a cycle that visits all vertices:\n\n1. A -> B (since A is connected to B and C, but C is connected to all other vertices, so we choose B)\n2. B -> D (since B is connected to A, C, D, and E, but we've already visited A and want to save C for later)\n3. D -> F (since D is connected to B, E, and F, but we've already visited B)\n4. F -> E (since F is connected to C, D, and E, but we've already visited D)\n5. E -> C (since E is connected to B, C, and D, but we've already visited B and D)\n6. C -> A (since C is connected to A, B, and F, but we've already visited B and F)\n\nSo, the Hamiltonian cycle in the graph is A -> B -> D -> F -> E -> C -> A."
