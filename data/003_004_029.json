    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos(2x) = 1/2, we first need to find the angles for which the cosine function equals 1/2. \n\nThe general solution for cos(θ) = 1/2 is given by:\n\nθ = 360n ± 60°\n\nwhere n is an integer.\n\nNow, we have cos(2x) = 1/2, so we can replace θ with 2x:\n\n2x = 360n ± 60°\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x that lie between 0° and 360°. We can do this by trying different values of n and checking if the resulting x is within the given range.\n\nFor n = 0:\n\n2x = ±60°\n\nx = ±30°\n\nSince -30° is not within the given range, we only consider x = 30°.\n\nFor n = 1:\n\n2x = 360° ± 60°\n\n2x = 300° or 420°\n\nx = 150° or 210°\n\nOnly x = 150° is within the given range.\n\nFor n = 2:\n\n2x = 720° ± 60°\n\n2x = 660° or 780°\n\nx = 330° or 390°\n\nOnly x = 330° is within the given range.\n\nThere are no more values of x within the given range for higher values of n.\n\nSo, the solutions for x within the given range are:\n\nx = 30°, 150°, and 330°."
