    "message_1": "A principal hires an agent to sell a product and offers them a commission based on sales. The agent has two options: work hard (H) and sell 200 units with a 70% chance, or slack off (L) and sell only 100 units with a 30% chance. The principal values the agent's effort at $50 per unit sold. If the agent chooses to work hard, they receive a $5,000 bonus, but if they slack off, they only get $2,000. What is the optimal strategy for the agent and the expected profits for both the principal and the agent?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal strategy for the agent, we need to calculate the expected profits for both the agent and the principal under each scenario (working hard or slacking off).\n\n1. Working Hard (H):\nAgent's expected profit: (0.7 * 200 * $50) + $5,000 = $7,000 + $5,000 = $12,000\nPrincipal's expected profit: (0.7 * 200 * $50) - $12,000 = $7,000 - $12,000 = -$5,000\n\n2. Slacking Off (L):\nAgent's expected profit: (0.3 * 100 * $50) + $2,000 = $1,500 + $2,000 = $3,500\nPrincipal's expected profit: (0.3 * 100 * $50) - $3,500 = $1,500 - $3,500 = -$2,000\n\nComparing the expected profits for the agent, working hard (H) yields a higher expected profit of $12,000 compared to slacking off (L) with an expected profit of $3,500. Therefore, the optimal strategy for the agent is to work hard.\n\nFor the principal, slacking off (L) yields a higher expected profit of -$2,000 compared to working hard (H) with an expected profit of -$5,000. However, the principal cannot control the agent's decision. Since the agent's optimal strategy is to work hard, the principal's expected profit will be -$5,000.\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal strategy for the agent is to work hard, resulting in an expected profit of $12,000 for the agent and an expected profit of -$5,000 for the principal."
