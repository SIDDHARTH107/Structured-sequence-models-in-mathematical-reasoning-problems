The distances between locations are given in the table below:\n\n|Location | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J |\n|---------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|A        | 0 | 4 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 8 | 3 |\n|B        | 4 | 0 | 6 | 8 | 7 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 5 | 2 |\n|C        | 7 | 6 | 0 | 9 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 8 | 2 | 2 |\n|D        | 8 | 8 | 9 | 0 | 5 | 6 | 8 | 2 | 2 | 6 |\n|E        | 9 | 7 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 7 | 8 | 6 | 1 | 5 |\n|F        | 2 | 3 | 3 | 6 | 7 | 0 | 3 | 7 | 3 | 2 |\n|G        | 4 | 5 | 2 | 8 | 8 | 3 | 0 | 4 | 4 | 7 |\n|H        | 1 | 7 | 8 | 2 | 6 | 7 | 4 | 0 | 2 | 9 |\n|I        | 8 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 5 |\n|J        | 3 | 2 | 2 | 6 | 5 | 2 | 7 | 9 | 5 | 0 |\n\nWhat is the shortest route that the delivery truck can take to deliver all the packages and return to the depot? What is the total distance travelled?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest route, we can use the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm. One of the simplest approaches to solve TSP is the nearest neighbor algorithm. However, this algorithm does not guarantee the optimal solution. For this problem, we will use the nearest neighbor algorithm as an approximation.\n\nStarting from location A:\n1. Nearest to A is H (distance 1)\n2. Nearest to H is D (distance 2)\n3. Nearest to D is I (distance 2)\n4. Nearest to I is E (distance 1)\n5. Nearest to E is C (distance 3)\n6. Nearest to C is J (distance 2)\n7. Nearest to J is B (distance 2)\n8. Nearest to B is F (distance 3)\n9. Nearest to F is G (distance 3)\n10. Return to A from G (distance 4)\n\nThe route is A -> H -> D -> I -> E -> C -> J -> B -> F -> G -> A.\nThe total distance travelled is 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 23."
