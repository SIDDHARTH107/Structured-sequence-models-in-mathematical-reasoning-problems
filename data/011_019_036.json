    "message_2": "An orthogonal array OA(N, k, s, t) is defined by the following parameters:\n\n- N: the number of rows\n- k: the number of columns\n- s: the number of symbols (levels) in each column\n- t: the strength of the array\n\nA second-order orthogonal array (OA with t=2) has the property that every pair of columns forms all possible combinations of symbols with equal frequency. In this case, we have an OA(2^4, 3, 2, 1), which means:\n\n- N = 2^4 = 16 rows\n- k = 3 columns\n- s = 2 symbols (levels) in each column\n- t = 1 (first-order orthogonal array)\n\nTo convert this first-order orthogonal array into a second-order orthogonal array, we need to ensure that every pair of columns forms all possible combinations of symbols with equal frequency.\n\nSince there are 2 symbols in each column, there are 2^2 = 4 possible combinations of symbols for each pair of columns. In a second-order orthogonal array with 16 rows, each combination should appear 16/4 = 4 times.\n\nNow, let's analyze the number of columns that need to be changed:\n\n- Column 1 and Column 2: If they don't form all possible combinations of symbols with equal frequency, we need to change one of them.\n- Column 1 and Column 3: If they don't form all possible combinations of symbols with equal frequency, we need to change one of them. If we already changed Column 1 in the previous step, we only need to change Column 3. Otherwise, we need to change Column 1.\n- Column 2 and Column 3: If they don't form all possible combinations of symbols with equal frequency, we need to change one of them. If we already changed Column 2 or Column 3 in the previous steps, we don't need to change any more columns. Otherwise, we need to change either Column 2 or Column 3.\n\nIn the worst case, we need to change all three columns to convert the given OA(2^4, 3, 2, 1) into a second-order orthogonal array."
