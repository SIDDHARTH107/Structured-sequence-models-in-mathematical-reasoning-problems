    "message_1": "Suppose that you are playing the Dictator Game with a partner, and you have been given $100 to split between yourself and your partner. What amount would you choose to give to your partner if the amount of money your partner receives is tripled, but the amount you keep remains the same?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount you give to your partner, and (100 - x) be the amount you keep for yourself. Since the amount your partner receives is tripled, they will receive 3x. The total amount of money in the game remains the same, which is $100.\n\nTo maximize the total amount of money for both you and your partner, you should aim to balance the amounts you both receive. Set the amount you keep equal to the tripled amount your partner receives:\n\n100 - x = 3x\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n100 = 4x\nx = 25\n\nSo, you should give $25 to your partner, which will be tripled to $75 for them, and you will keep $75 for yourself (100 - 25). Both you and your partner will receive $75 each."
