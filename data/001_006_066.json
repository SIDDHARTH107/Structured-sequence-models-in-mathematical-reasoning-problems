    "message_2": "To graph the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 - 4x + 3, we first need to find its vertex. The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by the formula:\n\nVertex (h, k) = ( -b / 2a , f(-b / 2a) )\n\nIn our case, a = 2, b = -4, and c = 3.\n\nFirst, let's find h:\nh = -b / 2a = -(-4) / (2 * 2) = 4 / 4 = 1\n\nNow, let's find k by plugging h back into the equation:\nk = f(1) = 2(1)^2 - 4(1) + 3 = 2 - 4 + 3 = 1\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation is (1, 1).\n\nNext, let's find the axis of symmetry. The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, and its equation is given by:\n\nx = h\n\nIn our case, h = 1, so the axis of symmetry is x = 1.\n\nFinally, let's find the y-intercept. The y-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the y-axis, which means x = 0. To find the y-intercept, we plug x = 0 into the equation:\n\ny = 2(0)^2 - 4(0) + 3 = 0 - 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 3).\n\nIn summary:\n- Vertex: (1, 1)\n- Axis of symmetry: x = 1\n- Y-intercept: (0, 3)\n\nNow, to graph the quadratic equation, plot the vertex, axis of symmetry, and y-intercept on a coordinate plane. Then, draw a parabola that passes through these points, opening upwards since a > 0."
