    "message_1": "What is the rate of decomposition of a chemical reaction of A to B if A decomposes at a rate of 0.05 moles/L/min and B decomposes at a rate of 0.02 moles/L/min, given that the initial concentration of A is 0.1 moles/L and B is absent initially? The chemical reaction is represented by A→B.",
    "message_2": "In the given chemical reaction A → B, the rate of decomposition of A is given as 0.05 moles/L/min, and the rate of formation of B is 0.02 moles/L/min. However, since B is formed from the decomposition of A, the rate of decomposition of A should be equal to the rate of formation of B.\n\nLet's denote the rate of decomposition of A as -rA and the rate of formation of B as rB. According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, we have:\n\n-rA = rB\n\nGiven that the initial concentration of A is 0.1 moles/L and B is absent initially, we can write the rate equation for the reaction as:\n\n-rA = 0.05 moles/L/min\n\nSince -rA = rB, the rate of formation of B is also 0.05 moles/L/min. Therefore, the rate of decomposition of the chemical reaction A → B is 0.05 moles/L/min."
