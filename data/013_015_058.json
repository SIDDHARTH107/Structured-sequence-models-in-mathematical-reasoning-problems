    "message_1": "Suppose a principal hires an agent to complete a task. The value of the completed task to the principal is $1000. The agent can choose to exert low effort, which will result in a completion probability of 0.4, or high effort, which will result in a completion probability of 0.8. The costs of exerting low or high effort are $50 and $90, respectively. Determine the optimal effort level for the agent if the principal offers a fixed fee of $400 to the agent regardless of the effort level.",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal effort level for the agent, we need to calculate the expected net gain for the agent at both effort levels and compare them.\n\n1. Low effort:\nThe probability of completing the task is 0.4. If the task is completed, the agent receives a fixed fee of $400 and incurs a cost of $50 for exerting low effort. The expected net gain for the agent at low effort is:\n\nExpected net gain (low effort) = (probability of completion * fixed fee) - cost of low effort\n= (0.4 * $400) - $50\n= $160 - $50\n= $110\n\n2. High effort:\nThe probability of completing the task is 0.8. If the task is completed, the agent receives a fixed fee of $400 and incurs a cost of $90 for exerting high effort. The expected net gain for the agent at high effort is:\n\nExpected net gain (high effort) = (probability of completion * fixed fee) - cost of high effort\n= (0.8 * $400) - $90\n= $320 - $90\n= $230\n\nComparing the expected net gains for both effort levels, we see that the agent's expected net gain is higher when exerting high effort ($230) compared to low effort ($110). Therefore, the optimal effort level for the agent is to exert high effort."
