    "message_2": "A sine wave can be represented as a function of time:\n\nx(t) = A * sin(2 * π * f * t)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, f is the frequency, and t is the time.\n\nIn this case, the sine wave has an amplitude of 5 and a frequency of 10 Hz:\n\nx(t) = 5 * sin(2 * π * 10 * t)\n\nTo find the frequency components of the signal, we can use the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal x(t) is given by:\n\nX(f) = ∫ x(t) * e^(-j * 2 * π * f * t) dt\n\nwhere X(f) is the Fourier transform of x(t), f is the frequency variable, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nFor a sine wave, the Fourier transform will result in two non-zero components: one at the positive frequency and one at the negative frequency. In this case, the positive frequency is 10 Hz, and the negative frequency is -10 Hz.\n\nThe amplitude of the frequency components can be found by calculating the magnitude of the Fourier transform at these frequencies. Since the sine wave has only one frequency component (10 Hz), the amplitude of this component will be the same as the amplitude of the sine wave, which is 5.\n\nSo, the frequency components of the signal are 10 Hz and -10 Hz, both with an amplitude of 5."
