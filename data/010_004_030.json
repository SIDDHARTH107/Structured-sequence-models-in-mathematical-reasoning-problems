    "message_2": "To prove that the set {1/n : n is a positive integer} is a compact subset of X, we need to show that every open cover of the set has a finite subcover. In other words, given any collection of open sets {U_i} such that {1/n : n is a positive integer} is a subset of the union of the U_i, we need to find a finite number of the U_i that still cover the set.\n\nLet {U_i} be an open cover of {1/n : n is a positive integer}. Since 1 is an element of the set, there exists an open set U_1 in the cover such that 1 is in U_1. Since U_1 is open, there exists an ε > 0 such that the interval (1 - ε, 1 + ε) is contained in U_1.\n\nNow, let N be a positive integer such that 1/N < ε/2. Then, for all n ≥ N, we have 1/n ≤ 1/N < ε/2. This implies that for all n ≥ N, the interval (1 - 1/n, 1 + 1/n) contains the interval (1 - ε, 1 + ε), and thus, 1/n is also in U_1 for all n ≥ N.\n\nFor the remaining elements {1/n : 1 ≤ n < N}, there are only finitely many of them. For each of these elements, there must exist an open set U_i in the cover that contains it. Let's denote these open sets as U_2, U_3, ..., U_{N+1}.\n\nNow, the finite collection of open sets {U_1, U_2, ..., U_{N+1}} covers the set {1/n : n is a positive integer}. To see this, consider an arbitrary element 1/n in the set. If n ≥ N, then 1/n is in U_1, and if 1 ≤ n < N, then 1/n is in one of the sets U_2, U_3, ..., U_{N+1}. Thus, we have found a finite subcover of the open cover {U_i}, which proves that the set {1/n : n is a positive integer} is a compact subset of X."
