    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 72, we will first analyze the possible structures of G using Sylow theorems and then show that G must be isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nRecall that the order of G is 72 = 2^3 * 3^2. By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3^2 = 9, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 2^3 = 8, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom condition 1, n_2 can be 1 or 9. From condition 2, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since both subgroups are unique, they are normal in G. The intersection of P_2 and P_3 is trivial (since their orders are coprime), so G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3. However, this would make G an abelian group, which contradicts the assumption that the center of G is trivial. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 9, which is normal in G. Let P_2 be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8. Since P_3 is normal in G, we can form the semi-direct product P_2 ⋊ P_3. The semi-direct product depends on the homomorphism φ: P_3 → Aut(P_2). Since P_3 is of order 9 and P_2 is of order 8, the possible orders of φ(P_3) are 1, 3, or 9. If the order is 1, then G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3, which is abelian and contradicts the assumption. If the order is 3 or 9, then G is non-abelian and isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, with the roles of the Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup reversed. G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8, which is normal in G. Let P_3 be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9. We can form the semi-direct product P_3 ⋊ P_2, which depends on the homomorphism φ: P_2 → Aut(P_3). Since P_2 is of order 8 and P_3 is of order 9, the possible orders of φ(P_2) are 1, 2, 4, or 8. If the order is 1, then G is isomorphic to the direct product P_3 × P_2, which is abelian and contradicts the assumption. If the order is 2, 4, or 8, then G is non-abelian and isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has 9 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. However, this case does not provide enough information to determine the structure of G, and it is not guaranteed that G is non-abelian.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 72 in Cases 2 and 3."
