    "message_2": "Given that the temperature profile varies sinusoidally with position, we can represent the temperature function T(x) as:\n\nT(x) = A * sin(kx)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude (50°C), k is the wave number (2π/λ), and λ is the wavelength (12 cm).\n\nFirst, let's find the wave number k:\n\nk = 2π/λ = 2π/12 cm = π/6 cm^(-1)\n\nNow we can write the temperature function T(x) as:\n\nT(x) = 50 * sin(πx/6)\n\nSo, the expression for the temperature as a function of position is:\n\nT(x) = 50 * sin(πx/6)"
