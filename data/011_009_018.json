    "message_2": "To arrange the 5 distinct balls in a row, we can use the concept of permutations. Since there are 5 balls and each has a unique color, there are 5 options for the first position, 4 options for the second position, 3 options for the third position, 2 options for the fourth position, and 1 option for the last position.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to arrange these balls in a row is:\n\n5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 ways"
