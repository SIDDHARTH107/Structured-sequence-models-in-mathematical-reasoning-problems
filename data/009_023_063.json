    "message_2": "To find the soliton wave profile $\\psi(x,t)$ at time $t=1$, we first need to find the general solution of the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation. For soliton solutions, we can use the ansatz (a trial solution) of the form:\n\n$$\\psi(x,t) = A(t) \\mathrm{sech}(B(t)(x - C(t))) e^{iD(t)(x - C(t)) + iE(t)}$$\n\nwhere $A(t)$, $B(t)$, $C(t)$, $D(t)$, and $E(t)$ are real-valued functions of time $t$ that need to be determined.\n\nSubstituting this ansatz into the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation, we obtain a set of ordinary differential equations for the functions $A(t)$, $B(t)$, $C(t)$, $D(t)$, and $E(t)$. Solving these equations, we find that:\n\n$$A(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\n$$B(t) = 1$$\n$$C(t) = 4t$$\n$$D(t) = -2$$\n$$E(t) = -2t$$\n\nNow, we can write the soliton wave profile $\\psi(x,t)$ as:\n\n$$\\psi(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\mathrm{sech}(x - 4t) e^{-2i(x - 4t) - 2it}$$\n\nFinally, we can find the soliton wave profile at time $t=1$:\n\n$$\\psi(x,1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\mathrm{sech}(x - 4) e^{-2i(x - 4) - 2i}$$"
