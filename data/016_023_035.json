    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are N = 5 self-similar pieces, and each piece is scaled down by a factor of s = 3 (since the original square is divided into 3x3 smaller squares, and 5 of them are filled).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal with a side length of 1 is approximately 1.465."
