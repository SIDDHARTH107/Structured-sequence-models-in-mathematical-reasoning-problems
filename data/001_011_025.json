    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we will first find a common denominator for all the fractions, which in this case is 15. Then, we will multiply each term by the common denominator to eliminate the fractions. Finally, we will solve for x.\n\nThe equation is:\n\n(3x+5)/5 - (2x-1)/3 = (4x+2)/15\n\nThe common denominator is 15, so we will multiply each term by 15:\n\n15 * (3x+5)/5 - 15 * (2x-1)/3 = 15 * (4x+2)/15\n\nNow, we simplify:\n\n3 * (3x+5) - 5 * (2x-1) = 4x+2\n\nDistribute the numbers:\n\n9x + 15 - 10x + 5 = 4x + 2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(9x - 10x) + (15 + 5) = 4x + 2\n\n-x + 20 = 4x + 2\n\nNow, isolate x:\n\n20 - 2 = 4x + x\n\n18 = 5x\n\nNow, divide by 5:\n\n18/5 = x\n\nSo, x = 18/5."
