Suppose that the thermal diffusivity of the material is k = 1 and L = 5. Evaluate the solution of the heat equation at t = 3.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Fourier Transform of the function f(x) = x over the domain [-L, L]. We will use the Fourier sine series since the function is odd. The Fourier sine series is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑[(2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx] * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere the integral is taken over the domain [-L, L]. For f(x) = x, we have:\n\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[x * sin(n * π * x / L) dx] from -L to L\n\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\n\na_n = (2/L) * [(L^2 / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n)]\n\nNow, let's find the solution to the heat equation in one dimension when the temperature is initially given by this function and is allowed to evolve over time. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = k * ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x, t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity. The solution to the heat equation with the initial condition u(x, 0) = f(x) can be found using the method of separation of variables. The solution is given by:\n\nu(x, t) = ∑[a_n * e^(-k * (n * π / L)² * t) * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nSubstituting the expression for a_n, we get:\n\nu(x, t) = ∑[(2/L) * (L^2 / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * e^(-k * (n * π / L)² * t) * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nNow, let's evaluate the solution of the heat equation at t = 3, k = 1, and L = 5:\n\nu(x, 3) = ∑[(2/5) * (25 / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * e^(-(n * π / 5)² * 3) * sin(n * π * x / 5)]\n\nThis is an infinite series, and we can't find an exact value for u(x, 3). However, we can approximate the solution by taking the first few terms of the series. The more terms we take, the better the approximation will be."
