    "message_1": "A car manufacturer produces brake pads for their vehicles. The thickness of the brake pads follows a normal distribution with a mean of 10 millimeters and a standard deviation of 0.5 millimeters. If a sample of 25 brake pads is taken, what is the probability that the average thickness of the sample will be less than 9.8 millimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the average thickness of the sample will be less than 9.8 millimeters, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed if the sample size is large enough, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 10 millimeters, the population standard deviation (σ) is 0.5 millimeters, and the sample size (n) is 25.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nSE = 0.5 / √25\nSE = 0.5 / 5\nSE = 0.1\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 9.8 millimeters. The z-score is given by the formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / SE\n\nz = (9.8 - 10) / 0.1\nz = -0.2 / 0.1\nz = -2\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability that the z-score is less than -2. The probability that the z-score is less than -2 is approximately 0.0228.\n\nSo, the probability that the average thickness of the sample will be less than 9.8 millimeters is approximately 0.0228 or 2.28%."
