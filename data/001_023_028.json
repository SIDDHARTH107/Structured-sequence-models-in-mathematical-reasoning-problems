    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(x) + cos(x) = 1, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1\n\nNow, let's square both sides of the given equation:\n\n(sin(x) + cos(x))^2 = 1^2\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\nsin^2(x) + 2sin(x)cos(x) + cos^2(x) = 1\n\nNow, we can substitute the trigonometric identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 into the equation:\n\n1 + 2sin(x)cos(x) = 1\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) = 0\n\nNow, we can use the double-angle identity for sine:\n\nsin(2x) = 0\n\nTo find the solutions for x between 0 and 2π, we can set 2x equal to the angles for which the sine is zero:\n\n2x = 0, π, 2π\n\nNow, divide each by 2 to find the solutions for x:\n\nx = 0, π/2, π\n\nSo, the solutions for x between 0 and 2π are x = 0, π/2, and π."
