    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a space-filling curve that is constructed iteratively. The perimeter of the Gosper curve increases with each iteration or order.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the Gosper curve of order n as P(n). The perimeter of the initial equilateral triangle (order 0) is P(0) = 3 * 3 = 9 units.\n\nFor each iteration, the length of each side is divided into 7 equal parts, and the new segments are connected to form the new curve. Therefore, the perimeter of the Gosper curve of order n is given by:\n\nP(n) = 7^n * P(0)\n\nTo find the perimeter of the Gosper curve of order 4, we can plug in the values:\n\nP(4) = 7^4 * 9\nP(4) = 2401 * 9\nP(4) = 21609 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Gosper curve of order 4, where each side of the initial equilateral triangle is 3 units long, is 21,609 units."
