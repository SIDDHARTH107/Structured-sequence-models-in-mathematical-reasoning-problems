    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, width of 3 cm, and height of 7 cm. What is the total surface area of the prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of one pair of opposite faces (length x width): 5 cm * 3 cm = 15 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 15 cm² * 2 = 30 cm².\n\n2. The area of the second pair of opposite faces (length x height): 5 cm * 7 cm = 35 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 35 cm² * 2 = 70 cm².\n\n3. The area of the third pair of opposite faces (width x height): 3 cm * 7 cm = 21 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 21 cm² * 2 = 42 cm².\n\nNow, add the areas of all the pairs of faces together: 30 cm² + 70 cm² + 42 cm² = 142 cm².\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 142 cm²."
