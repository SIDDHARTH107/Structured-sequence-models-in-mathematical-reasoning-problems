    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of a population, we can use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere:\n- CI is the confidence interval\n- x̄ is the sample mean (70 kg)\n- t is the t-score for the desired level of confidence (95%) and degrees of freedom (n-1 = 50-1 = 49)\n- s is the sample standard deviation (5 kg)\n- n is the sample size (50)\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score for a 95% confidence interval with 49 degrees of freedom. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find that the t-score is approximately 2.0096.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 70 ± (2.0096 * (5 / √50))\n\nCI = 70 ± (2.0096 * (5 / 7.071))\n\nCI = 70 ± (2.0096 * 0.7071)\n\nCI = 70 ± 1.4204\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the population is approximately (68.5796 kg, 71.4204 kg)."
