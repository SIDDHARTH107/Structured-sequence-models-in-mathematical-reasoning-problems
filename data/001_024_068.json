    "message_2": "To simplify the given trigonometric expression, we need to recall the definitions of sec(x) and csc(x). \n\nsec(x) = 1/cos(x)\ncsc(x) = 1/sin(x)\n\nNow, substitute these definitions into the expression:\n\nsin(x) * (1/cos(x)) + cos(x) * (1/sin(x))\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n(sin(x)/cos(x)) + (cos(x)/sin(x))\n\nTo combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator, which is sin(x) * cos(x). So, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n(sin^2(x) + cos^2(x)) / (sin(x) * cos(x))\n\nNow, we know that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 (based on the Pythagorean identity). Therefore, the simplified expression is:\n\n1 / (sin(x) * cos(x))"
