    "message_1": "Suppose a company wants to produce two products P1 and P2. The company has limited resources of 300 units of labor, 400 units of material, and 500 units of machine time available. The production of P1 requires 2 units of labor, 3 units of material, and 4 units of machine time; while the production of P2 requires 4 units of labor, 3 units of material, and 1 unit of machine time. The profit for each unit of P1 and P2 is $10 and $15, respectively. Determine the optimal production level of P1 and P2 that maximizes the profit of the company.",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal production level of P1 and P2 that maximizes the profit of the company, we can use linear programming. Let x1 be the number of units of P1 produced and x2 be the number of units of P2 produced. The objective function to maximize is the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nProfit = 10x1 + 15x2\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x1 + 4x2 ≤ 300 (labor constraint)\n3x1 + 3x2 ≤ 400 (material constraint)\n4x1 + x2 ≤ 500 (machine time constraint)\nx1, x2 ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints as:\n\nx2 ≤ (300 - 2x1) / 4\nx2 ≤ (400 - 3x1) / 3\nx2 ≤ 500 - 4x1\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region by graphing these inequalities and finding the intersection points.\n\nIntersection points:\n1. (0, 0)\n2. (0, 100)\n3. (100, 0)\n4. (60, 80)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these intersection points:\n\n1. Profit(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. Profit(0, 100) = 10(0) + 15(100) = $1500\n3. Profit(100, 0) = 10(100) + 15(0) = $1000\n4. Profit(60, 80) = 10(60) + 15(80) = $1800\n\nThe maximum profit is $1800, which occurs when the company produces 60 units of P1 and 80 units of P2. Therefore, the optimal production level is 60 units of P1 and 80 units of P2."
