    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function, we first need to find the first derivative and then differentiate it once more. \n\nThe first derivative, f'(x), can be found by differentiating f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^4 - 8x^3 - 6x^2 + 24x - 12)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 24x^2 - 12x + 24\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative, f''(x), by differentiating f'(x) with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx(12x^3 - 24x^2 - 12x + 24)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x - 12\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) is f''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x - 12."
