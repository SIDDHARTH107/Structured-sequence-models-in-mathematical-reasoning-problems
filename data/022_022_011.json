    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform F(k) of f(x), we first need to express f(x) in terms of its Fourier coefficients. Since f(x) is a real and odd function, its Fourier series will only have sine terms:\n\nf(x) = ∑(n=1)^∞ [B_n sin(n x)]\n\nComparing this with the given Fourier series, we have:\n\nB_n = 2(-1)^n / (nπ) for odd n, and B_n = 0 for even n.\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform F(k) using the following formula:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[-π, π] f(x) e^(-ikx) dx\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function, and e^(-ikx) is an even function, their product will be an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, F(k) = 0 for all k.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for the Fourier series coefficients, which are related to the magnitude spectrum, we already have them as B_n. To plot the magnitude spectrum over the range -10 ≤ k ≤ 10, we can use the following values:\n\nB_n = 2(-1)^n / (nπ) for odd n, and B_n = 0 for even n.\n\nFor k = -10 to 10, we have:\n\nB_-10 = B_10 = 0\nB_-9 = B_9 = 2(-1)^9 / (9π) = -2 / (9π)\nB_-8 = B_8 = 0\nB_-7 = B_7 = 2(-1)^7 / (7π) = -2 / (7π)\nB_-6 = B_6 = 0\nB_-5 = B_5 = 2(-1)^5 / (5π) = -2 / (5π)\nB_-4 = B_4 = 0\nB_-3 = B_3 = 2(-1)^3 / (3π) = -2 / (3π)\nB_-2 = B_2 = 0\nB_-1 = B_1 = 2(-1)^1 / (1π) = -2 / π\nB_0 = 0\nB_1 = 2(-1)^1 / (1π) = -2 / π\nB_2 = 0\nB_3 = 2(-1)^3 / (3π) = -2 / (3π)\nB_4 = 0\nB_5 = 2(-1)^5 / (5π) = -2 / (5π)\nB_6 = 0\nB_7 = 2(-1)^7 / (7π) = -2 / (7π)\nB_8 = 0\nB_9 = 2(-1)^9 / (9π) = -2 / (9π)\nB_10 = 0\n\nPlot these values on a graph with k on the x-axis and B_n on the y-axis to obtain the magnitude spectrum of f(x) over the range -10 ≤ k ≤ 10."
