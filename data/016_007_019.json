    "message_2": "A Menger Sponge is a fractal shape that is created through a recursive process. The construction of a Menger Sponge starts with a cube. At each stage, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the larger cube are removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nTo find the volume of a Menger Sponge at stage 3, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = Initial Volume * (1 - Removed Volume Ratio)^Stage\n\nThe initial volume of the cube is V = a^3, where a is the side length of the cube. The removed volume ratio is the ratio of the volume of the removed cubes to the volume of the larger cube. In each stage, 7 of the 27 smaller cubes are removed, so the removed volume ratio is 7/27.\n\nLet's assume the side length of the initial cube is 1 (a = 1). Then the initial volume is 1^3 = 1.\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of the Menger Sponge at stage 3:\n\nVolume = 1 * (1 - 7/27)^3\nVolume = 1 * (20/27)^3\nVolume ≈ 1 * (0.74074)^3\nVolume ≈ 0.4073\n\nSo, the volume of a Menger Sponge of stage 3 is approximately 0.4073 times the volume of the initial cube."
