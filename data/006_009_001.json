    "message_1": "In a certain population, 8% of people have a particular medical condition. If a random sample of 250 people from this population is taken, what is the probability that at least 20 of them have the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial\n- n is the number of trials\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- p = 0.08 (8% probability of having the medical condition)\n- n = 250 (sample size)\n- k = 20 (number of people with the medical condition)\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability that at least 20 people have the medical condition, which means we need to find the probability for k = 20, 21, 22, ..., 250. To do this, we can find the probability of the complementary event (i.e., fewer than 20 people have the medical condition) and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we need to find the probability for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 19 and then subtract the sum of these probabilities from 1.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 19:\n\nsum = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 19\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula:\n\nsum = Σ [C(250, k) * (0.08)^k * (1-0.08)^(250-k)] for k = 0 to 19\n\nNow, we can use a calculator or software to compute the sum of these probabilities. After calculating, we get:\n\nsum ≈ 0.5663\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least 20 people with the medical condition by subtracting the sum from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = 1 - sum ≈ 1 - 0.5663 ≈ 0.4337\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 people in the sample of 250 have the medical condition is approximately 43.37%."
