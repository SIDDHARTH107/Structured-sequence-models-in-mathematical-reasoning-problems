    "message_1": "Here's a possible question for a math student:\n\nA school wants to test the difference in the reading speed between two groups of students: one group received extra reading lessons during the summer, while the other did not. To do so, the school records the time (in seconds) that each student takes to read a given text, and divide them into the two groups. The data is not normally distributed and the variance between the groups is unknown. Using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with a 0.05 significance level, can you determine if there is a significant difference between the groups?\n\nHere are the reading times for each group:\n\nGroup 1: \n79, 85, 88, 90, 92, 93, 94, 98, 103, 104\n\nGroup 2:\n86, 88, 92, 94, 98, 101, 103, 109, 112, 115\n\nNote: The Wilcoxon rank-sum test, also known as Mann-Whitney U test, is a non-parametric statistical test that compares two independent groups to determine if they have different medians. The test uses the rank of the data instead of their actual values and assumes that there is no significant difference in the shapes of the distributions.",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Combine the data from both groups and rank them in ascending order.\n2. Calculate the sum of the ranks for each group.\n3. Calculate the test statistic U for each group.\n4. Determine the critical value for the test.\n5. Compare the test statistic to the critical value to determine if there is a significant difference between the groups.\n\nStep 1: Combine and rank the data\n\n| Value | Rank |\n|-------|------|\n| 79    | 1    |\n| 85    | 2    |\n| 86    | 3    |\n| 88    | 4.5  |\n| 88    | 4.5  |\n| 90    | 6    |\n| 92    | 7.5  |\n| 92    | 7.5  |\n| 93    | 9    |\n| 94    | 10.5 |\n| 94    | 10.5 |\n| 98    | 12.5 |\n| 98    | 12.5 |\n| 101   | 14   |\n| 103   | 15.5 |\n| 103   | 15.5 |\n| 104   | 17   |\n| 109   | 18   |\n| 112   | 19   |\n| 115   | 20   |\n\nStep 2: Calculate the sum of the ranks for each group\n\nGroup 1: 1 + 2 + 4.5 + 6 + 7.5 + 9 + 10.5 + 12.5 + 15.5 + 17 = 86\nGroup 2: 3 + 4.5 + 7.5 + 10.5 + 12.5 + 14 + 15.5 + 18 + 19 + 20 = 114\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic U for each group\n\nU1 = n1 * n2 + (n1 * (n1 + 1)) / 2 - R1\nU2 = n1 * n2 + (n2 * (n2 + 1)) / 2 - R2\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the sample sizes of the two groups, and R1 and R2 are the sum of the ranks for each group.\n\nU1 = 10 * 10 + (10 * 11) / 2 - 86 = 100 + 55 - 86 = 69\nU2 = 10 * 10 + (10 * 11) / 2 - 114 = 100 + 55 - 114 = 41\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value for the test\n\nFor a two-tailed test with a 0.05 significance level and sample sizes of 10 for both groups, the critical value of U can be found in the Wilcoxon rank-sum test table or using statistical software. In this case, the critical value is 23.\n\nStep 5: Compare the test statistic to the critical value\n\nSince both U1 (69) and U2 (41) are greater than the critical value (23), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is no significant difference between the reading speeds of the two groups at the 0.05 significance level."
