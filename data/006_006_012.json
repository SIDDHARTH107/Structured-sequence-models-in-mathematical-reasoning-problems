    "message_1": "A basketball player has a free throw percentage of 80%. If the player takes 10 free throws in a game, what is the probability that the player will make exactly 8 of those free throws?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial\n- n is the number of trials\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 10 (the number of free throws)\n- k = 8 (the number of successful free throws)\n- p = 0.8 (the free throw percentage)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(10, 8), which is the number of ways to choose 8 successes out of 10 trials:\n\nC(10, 8) = 10! / (8! * (10-8)!)\n          = 10! / (8! * 2!)\n          = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\n          = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)\n          = 45\n\nNow we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * p^8 * (1-p)^(10-8)\n         = 45 * (0.8)^8 * (0.2)^2\n         = 45 * 0.16777216 * 0.04\n         â‰ˆ 0.301989888\n\nSo the probability that the player will make exactly 8 of the 10 free throws is approximately 30.2%."
