    "message_2": "To solve this nonlinear differential equation, we first need to separate the variables:\n\ndx/dt = x(2 - x)\n\ndx / (x(2 - x)) = dt\n\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1 / (x(2 - x))) dx = ∫ dt\n\nTo solve the integral on the left side, we can use partial fraction decomposition. Let:\n\n1 / (x(2 - x)) = A / x + B / (2 - x)\n\n1 = A(2 - x) + Bx\n\nComparing the coefficients, we get the following system of equations:\n\nA + B = 0\n-2A = 1\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nA = -1/2\nB = 1/2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral:\n\n∫(-1/2x + 1/2(2 - x)) dx = ∫ dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n-1/2 ln|x| + 1/2 ln|2 - x| = t + C\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition x(0) = 1:\n\n-1/2 ln|1| + 1/2 ln|1| = C\n\nC = 0\n\nSo, our solution is:\n\n-1/2 ln|x| + 1/2 ln|2 - x| = t\n\nNow, we want to find the time at which the solution becomes negative. This means that x(t) < 0. Since x(t) is inside the absolute value in the natural logarithm, we need to find when 2 - x(t) < 0. \n\n2 - x(t) < 0\nx(t) > 2\n\nNow, we can plug this back into our solution:\n\n-1/2 ln|x| + 1/2 ln|2 - x| = t\n\nLet x = 2 + ε, where ε is a small positive number:\n\n-1/2 ln|2 + ε| + 1/2 ln|ε| = t\n\nAs ε approaches 0, ln|ε| approaches -∞. Therefore, the time at which the solution becomes negative does not exist, as it would require an infinite amount of time for x(t) to become greater than 2."
