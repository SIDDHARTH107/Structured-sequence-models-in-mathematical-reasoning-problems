    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Sierpinski carpet can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski carpet, N = 8, as it is made up of 8 smaller copies of itself, and S = 3, as each side of the smaller copies is 1/3 the length of the original side.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski carpet (regardless of order) is:\n\nD = log(8) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.8928\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension does not change with the order of the Sierpinski carpet, so the dimension for the order 4 Sierpinski carpet is also approximately 1.8928."
