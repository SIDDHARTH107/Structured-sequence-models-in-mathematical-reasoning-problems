    "message_2": "The probability of the car not getting a flat tire is the complement of the probability of it getting a flat tire. \n\nProbability of not getting a flat tire = 1 - Probability of getting a flat tire\n\nProbability of not getting a flat tire = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\n\nSo, the probability that their car will not get a flat tire during the entire trip is 0.8 or 80%."
