    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5, we will use the power rule for differentiation, which states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1).\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x, denoted as f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx + d(2x)/dx - d(5)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule:\n\nf'(x) = 3(2x^(2-1)) + 2(1x^(1-1)) - 0\nf'(x) = 6x + 2\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) + 2\nf'(2) = 12 + 2\nf'(2) = 14\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5 at x = 2 is 14."
