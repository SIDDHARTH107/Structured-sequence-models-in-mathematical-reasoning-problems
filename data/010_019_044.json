    "message_2": "(a) To find the critical points of y, we need to find the points where the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to 0. \n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 12x^2 + 41x - 30)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\ny'(x) = 3x^2 - 24x + 41\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which y'(x) = 0:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 24x + 41\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -24, and c = 41. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (24 ± √((-24)^2 - 4(3)(41))) / (2(3))\n\nx = (24 ± √(576 - 492)) / 6\n\nx = (24 ± √84) / 6\n\nx ≈ 2.732 and x ≈ 5.268\n\nSo, the critical points of y are approximately x = 2.732 and x = 5.268.\n\n(b) Morse homology is a mathematical tool used to study the topology of a space by analyzing the critical points of a smooth function on that space. In this case, we are asked to compute the number of critical points of y at levels y = 1 and y = 10.\n\nTo do this, we need to find the values of x for which y(x) = 1 and y(x) = 10:\n\n1. For y = 1:\n\n1 = x^3 - 12x^2 + 41x - 30\n\nx^3 - 12x^2 + 41x - 31 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots is not straightforward. However, we can use numerical methods (e.g., Newton's method) to approximate the roots. Doing so, we find that there are no critical points at y = 1.\n\n2. For y = 10:\n\n10 = x^3 - 12x^2 + 41x - 30\n\nx^3 - 12x^2 + 41x - 40 = 0\n\nAgain, this is a cubic equation, and we can use numerical methods to approximate the roots. Doing so, we find that there are no critical points at y = 10.\n\nTherefore, there are 0 critical points of y at levels y = 1 and y = 10."
