    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a confidential message to Bob securely using RSA encryption. Alice chooses p = 11 and q = 17 as her prime numbers for the key generation process. If Alice's message is the number m = 7, what is the encrypted message (i.e., the ciphertext) that Alice should send to Bob?",
    "message_2": "To find the encrypted message (ciphertext), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n2. Compute the totient function, φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\n3. Choose a public key exponent e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1\n4. Compute the encrypted message (ciphertext) using the formula: c = m^e mod n\n\nStep 1: Compute n = p * q\nn = 11 * 17 = 187\n\nStep 2: Compute the totient function, φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\nφ(n) = (11 - 1) * (17 - 1) = 10 * 16 = 160\n\nStep 3: Choose a public key exponent e\nWe can choose e = 3, as it is a common choice and satisfies the conditions 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1.\n\nStep 4: Compute the encrypted message (ciphertext)\nc = m^e mod n\nc = 7^3 mod 187\nc = 343 mod 187\nc = 156\n\nSo, the encrypted message (ciphertext) that Alice should send to Bob is 156."
