    "message_2": "To prove that (C × D) × E = C × (D × E), we need to show that the elements in both sets are the same.\n\nLet's first define the Cartesian products:\n\n1. (C × D) × E = {((a1, b1, c1), (b2, c2, d2), (a3, b3, d3)) | (a1, b1, c1) ∈ C, (b2, c2, d2) ∈ D, (a3, b3, d3) ∈ E}\n2.

Therefore, the elements in both sets have the same conditions and restrictions.\n\nSince the elements in both sets have the same conditions and restrictions, we can conclude that (C × D) × E = C × (D × E)."
