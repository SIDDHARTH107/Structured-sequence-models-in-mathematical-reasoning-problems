    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given signal f(t), we need to use the following formula:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nSince f(t) = 4t^2 - 4 for -1 ≤ t ≤ 1 and f(t) = 0 otherwise, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[-1 to 1] [(4t^2 - 4) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, let's solve the integral:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[-1 to 1] [(4t^2 - 4) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n     = [∫[-1 to 1] (4t^2 * e^(-jωt)) dt] - [∫[-1 to 1] (4 * e^(-jωt)) dt]\n\nLet's solve the first integral:\n\n∫[-1 to 1] (4t^2 * e^(-jωt)) dt\n= 4 ∫[-1 to 1] (t^2 * e^(-jωt)) dt\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts:\nu = t^2, dv = e^(-jωt) dt\ndu = 2t dt, v = -1/(jω) * e^(-jωt)\n\nuv - ∫v du = (-t^2/(jω) * e^(-jωt)) - ∫[-1 to 1] (-2t/(jω) * e^(-jωt)) dt\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts again:\nu = -2t, dv = e^(-jωt) dt\ndu = -2 dt, v = -1/(jω) * e^(-jωt)\n\nuv - ∫v du = (-2t^2/(ω^2) * e^(-jωt)) - ∫[-1 to 1] (2/(ω^2) * e^(-jωt)) dt\n\nNow, we can integrate the last term:\n2/(ω^2) * ∫[-1 to 1] e^(-jωt) dt = 2/(ω^2) * [-1/(jω) * e^(-jωt)] | from -1 to 1\n= 2/(ω^3) * (e^(-jω) - e^(jω))\n\nSo, the first integral is:\n4 ∫[-1 to 1] (t^2 * e^(-jωt)) dt = 4 * ([-t^2/(jω) * e^(-jωt) - 2t^2/(ω^2) * e^(-jωt) + 2/(ω^3) * (e^(-jω) - e^(jω))] | from -1 to 1)\n\nNow, let's solve the second integral:\n\n∫[-1 to 1] (4 * e^(-jωt)) dt = 4 * [-1/(jω) * e^(-jωt)] | from -1 to 1\n= 4/(jω) * (e^(-jω) - e^(jω))\n\nNow, we can combine both integrals:\n\nF(ω) = 4 * ([-t^2/(jω) * e^(-jωt) - 2t^2/(ω^2) * e^(-jωt) + 2/(ω^3) * (e^(-jω) - e^(jω))] | from -1 to 1) - 4/(jω) * (e^(-jω) - e^(jω))\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the Fourier transform:\n\n|F(ω)| = |4 * ([-t^2/(jω) * e^(-jωt) - 2t^2/(ω^2) * e^(-jωt) + 2/(ω^3) * (e^(-jω) - e^(jω))] | from -1 to 1) - 4/(jω) * (e^(-jω) - e^(jω))|\n\nTo sketch the magnitude spectrum of the Fourier transform, you would plot |F(ω)| against ω. The exact shape of the plot will depend on the specific values of the integral, but it will generally be a continuous curve with peaks and valleys. Note that the magnitude spectrum will be an even function, as the given signal f(t) is an even function."
