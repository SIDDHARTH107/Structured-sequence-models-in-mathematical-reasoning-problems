    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C4 or V4, we will consider the number of elements of order 2 in G.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nIf G has an element of order 4, let's call it a, then G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element. In this case, G is cyclic, generated by a, and is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G has no elements of order 4.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let G = {e, a, b, c}, where a, b, and c are distinct non-identity elements. Since they all have order 2, we have a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e.\n\nNow, consider the product ab. It cannot be equal to a or b, because then a = b or b = a, which contradicts the distinctness of a and b. It also cannot be equal to e, because then a = b^(-1), which means a = b, again contradicting the distinctness of a and b. Therefore, ab = c.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that bc = a and ac = b. Thus, G has the following operation table:\n\n```\n  e a b c\ne e a b c\na a e c b\nb b c e a\nc c b a e\n```\n\nThis operation table is identical to the operation table of V4, so G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, if G has an element of order 4, it is isomorphic to C4. If it has no elements of order 4, it is isomorphic to V4."
