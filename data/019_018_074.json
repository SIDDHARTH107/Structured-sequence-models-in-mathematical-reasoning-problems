Each step of the proof must be justified using a rule of inference (modus ponens, universal introduction, etc.). How many steps are required to prove the theorem T, given the following information?\n\nA1: p -> (q -> r)\nA2: (p ^ q) -> s\nA3: (r -> ~s) v (q -> ~s)\nA4: ~s -> ~(r ^ q)\nA5: p\nA6: q\n\nT: ~r",
    "message_2": "To prove the theorem T: ~r, we can proceed with the following steps using natural deduction:\n\n1. p (A5)\n2. q (A6)\n3. p -> (q -> r) (A1)\n4. q -> r (1, 3, Modus Ponens)\n5. r (2, 4, Modus Ponens)\n6. p ^ q (1, 2, Conjunction Introduction)\n7.
