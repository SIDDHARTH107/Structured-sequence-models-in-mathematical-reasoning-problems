    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct isomorphism classes for a group G of order 18, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 18 is 2 * 3^2. \n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 9 (3^2) and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The only possible value for n_3 is 1.\n\nNow, we consider the cases for n_2 and n_3:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup (P) and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup (Q) in G. Both P and Q are normal in G, and G is the internal direct product of P and Q. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups of order 2 and 9, i.e., G is isomorphic to C_2 × C_9.\n\n2. If n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1, then there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup (Q) in G. Since Q is normal in G, G has a semidirect product structure. The action of a Sylow 2-subgroup on Q can be either trivial or nontrivial. If the action is trivial, G is isomorphic to the direct product C_2 × C_9, which we already considered in the first case. If the action is nontrivial, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product C_9 ⋊ C_2, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_18.\n\nThus, there are two distinct isomorphism classes for a group G of order 18: C_2 × C_9 and D_18. To determine which isomorphism class G belongs to, we would need more information about the structure of G."
