    "message_2": "The given function is y = 2cos(3x - π/4). To find the phase shift, we need to look at the argument of the cosine function, which is (3x - π/4).\n\nThe general form of a cosine function is y = A*cos(B(x - C)), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our case, A = 2, B = 3, and the argument of the cosine function is (3x - π/4). To find the phase shift C, we need to rewrite the argument in the form B(x - C).\n\n3x - π/4 = 3(x - C)\n\nNow, we can see that the phase shift C is equal to π/4 divided by the frequency B:\n\nC = (π/4) / 3\n\nSo, the phase shift of the given trigonometric function is C = π/12 radians."
