The distances between the cities are:\n\n- City 1 to City 2: 10 km\n- City 1 to City 3: 20 km\n- City 1 to City 4: 15 km\n- City 1 to City 5: 30 km\n- City 1 to City 6: 25 km\n- City 2 to City 3: 35 km\n- City 2 to City 4: 25 km\n- City 2 to City 5: 30 km\n- City 2 to City 6: 20 km\n- City 3 to City 4: 30 km\n- City 3 to City 5: 10 km\n- City 3 to City 6: 15 km\n- City 4 to City 5: 40 km\n- City 4 to City 6: 35 km\n- City 5 to City 6: 20 km\n\nWhat is the shortest possible distance the salesman can travel to visit all 6 cities exactly once and return to the starting city?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance, we can use the brute force method to calculate the total distance for each possible route and then choose the shortest one. There are 5! (5 factorial) possible routes since there are 5 cities to visit after the starting city, which equals 120 routes. However, we can divide this number by 2 since the route can be traversed in reverse, resulting in 60 unique routes to consider.\n\nHere are the shortest routes found:\n\n1. City 1 → City 2 → City 6 → City 3 → City 5 → City 4 → City 1\n   Distance: 10 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 40 + 15 = 110 km\n\n2. City 1 → City 4 → City 2 → City 6 → City 3 → City 5 → City 1\n   Distance: 15 + 25 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 30 = 110 km\n\nThe shortest possible distance the salesman can travel to visit all 6 cities exactly once and return to the starting city is 110 km."
