    "message_2": "To find the value of dy/dx, we will first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, using the chain rule for implicit differentiation.\n\nDifferentiating x^3 with respect to x gives 3x^2.\nDifferentiating y^3 with respect to x gives -3y^2(dy/dx) (using the chain rule).\nDifferentiating 6xy with respect to x gives 6y + 6x(dy/dx) (using the product rule).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n3x^2 - 3y^2(dy/dx) = 6y + 6x(dy/dx)\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx. First, isolate the dy/dx terms:\n\n3y^2(dy/dx) + 6x(dy/dx) = 3x^2 - 6y\n\nFactor out dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx (3y^2 + 6x) = 3x^2 - 6y\n\nNow, divide both sides by (3y^2 + 6x) to solve for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = (3x^2 - 6y) / (3y^2 + 6x)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values x = 2 and y = 2:\n\ndy/dx = (3(2)^2 - 6(2)) / (3(2)^2 + 6(2))\n\ndy/dx = (12 - 12) / (12 + 12)\n\ndy/dx = 0 / 24\n\ndy/dx = 0\n\nSo, the value of dy/dx when x = 2 and y = 2 is 0."
