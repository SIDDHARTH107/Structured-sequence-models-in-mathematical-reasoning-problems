    "message_2": "We can use the right triangle trigonometry to solve this problem. Let's denote the angle between the ladder and the ground as θ. We are given the length of the ladder (hypotenuse) as 15m and the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall (adjacent side) as 6m. We can use the cosine function to find the angle θ.\n\ncos(θ) = (adjacent side) / (hypotenuse)\ncos(θ) = 6 / 15\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse cosine (also known as arccos or cos^(-1)) to find the angle θ.\n\nθ = arccos(6 / 15)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nθ ≈ 64.16°\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle the ladder makes with the ground is approximately 64°."
