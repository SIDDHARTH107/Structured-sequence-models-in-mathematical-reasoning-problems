    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Relevance Logic, we need to identify the relevant information and use it to find the time it takes for both trains to meet each other.\n\nRelevant Information:\n1. Train A's speed: 50 km/h\n2. Train B's speed: 60 km/h\n3. Distance between stations: 500 km\n\nWhen both trains are moving towards each other, their speeds are added together. So, the combined speed of both trains is:\n\nCombined speed = Train A's speed + Train B's speed\nCombined speed = 50 km/h + 60 km/h\nCombined speed = 110 km/h\n\nNow, we can use the formula for distance, speed, and time:\n\nDistance = Speed ร Time\n\nWe know the distance between the stations is 500 km, and the combined speed of both trains is 110 km/h. We need to find the time it takes for them to meet, so we can rearrange the formula to solve for time:\n\nTime = Distance รท Speed\n\nPlugging in the relevant information:\n\nTime = 500 km รท 110 km/h\n\nTime = 4.545 hours (approximately)\n\nSo, it will take approximately 4.545 hours for both trains to meet each other."
