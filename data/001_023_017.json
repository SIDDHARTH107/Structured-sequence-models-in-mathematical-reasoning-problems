    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(2x) = √2 - 1 for x in the interval [0, 2π), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate sin(2x).\n2. Find the value of 2x.\n3. Solve for x.\n\nStep 1: Isolate sin(2x)\nDivide both sides of the equation by 2:\nsin(2x) = (√2 - 1)/2\n\nStep 2: Find the value of 2x\nTake the inverse sine (sin^(-1)) of both sides:\n2x = sin^(-1)((√2 - 1)/2)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n2x ≈ 0.4636 or 2x ≈ π - 0.4636 (since sine is positive in both the first and second quadrants)\n\nStep 3: Solve for x\nDivide both sides of each equation by 2:\nx ≈ 0.2318 or x ≈ (π - 0.4636)/2\n\nCalculating the second value for x:\nx ≈ (3.1416 - 0.4636)/2 ≈ 1.3390\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the interval [0, 2π) are approximately:\nx ≈ 0.2318 and x ≈ 1.3390"
