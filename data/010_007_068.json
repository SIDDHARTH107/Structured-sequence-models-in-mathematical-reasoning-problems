By the Galois correspondence between subgroups of the fundamental group and covering spaces, we know that the deck transformation group is isomorphic to the quotient group $G/H$.\n\nSince the deck transformation group is given as $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, we have:\n\n$G/H \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, we need to find a subgroup $H$ of $G = \\mathbb{Z}$ such that the quotient group $\\mathbb{Z}/H$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. \n\nRecall that the subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}$ are of the form $n\\mathbb{Z}$ for some integer $n \\geq 0$. Thus, we are looking for an integer $n$ such that $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. \n\nIt is clear that $n = 2$ satisfies this condition, as $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, the subgroup $H$ of $G$ that corresponds to a regular cover of $X$ with the deck transformation group $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ is:\n\n$H = 2\\mathbb{Z}$."
