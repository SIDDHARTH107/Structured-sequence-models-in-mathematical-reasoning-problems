    "message_1": "A company wants to maximize the profit of producing and selling two products X and Y. The profit per unit of X is $8 and the profit per unit of Y is $12. The production process requires 4 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time for each unit of X, and 3 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time for each unit of Y. The company has a total of 100 hours of labor and 80 hours of machine time available for production per day. How many units of X and Y should the company produce each day to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 8x + 12y\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are:\n4x + 3y ≤ 100 (labor constraint)\n2x + 3y ≤ 80 (machine constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can graph the constraints and find the feasible region. Then, we will evaluate the objective function at each corner point of the feasible region to find the maximum profit.\n\nGraphing the constraints, we get the following corner points of the feasible region:\nA(0, 0)\nB(0, 26.67) [y = 100/3]\nC(20, 20)\nD(40, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 8x + 12y at each corner point:\n\nP(A) = 8(0) + 12(0) = $0\nP(B) = 8(0) + 12(26.67) = $320.04\nP(C) = 8(20) + 12(20) = $400\nP(D) = 8(40) + 12(0) = $320\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point C, where the company should produce 20 units of product X and 20 units of product Y. The maximum profit is $400 per day."
