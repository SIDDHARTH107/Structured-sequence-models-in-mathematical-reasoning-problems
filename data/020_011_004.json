    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The profit earned by selling one unit of A is $10, and the profit earned by selling one unit of B is $15. Each product requires a certain amount of resources to be produced, and the company has a limited amount of resources available. The resource requirements for each product are:\n\n- Product A requires 2 units of resource X and 1 unit of resource Y\n- Product B requires 1 unit of resource X and 3 units of resource Y\n\nThe company can allocate a maximum of 120 units of resource X and 90 units of resource Y for production. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can earn if they produce both products A and B? How many units of each product should be produced to achieve this maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The profit function P(x, y) can be represented as:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nThe resource constraints can be represented as:\n\n2x + y ≤ 120 (Resource X constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 90 (Resource Y constraint)\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we will solve this linear programming problem. First, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 120\n   y ≤ -2x + 120\n\n2. x + 3y ≤ 90\n   y ≤ (-1/3)x + 30\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 30), (45, 15), and (60, 0). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 30) = 10(0) + 15(30) = $450\n3. P(45, 15) = 10(45) + 15(15) = $750\n4. P(60, 0) = 10(60) + 15(0) = $600\n\nThe maximum profit of $750 is achieved when the company produces 45 units of product A and 15 units of product B."
