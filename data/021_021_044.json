    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for a math student:\n\nSuppose you have a function f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 10. Use the Cuckoo Search Algorithm to minimize the function over the interval [-5, 10]. Use an initial population size of 20, a maximum generation count of 50, and assume that the discovery rate of each cuckoo is 0.25. Report the optimal solution and its corresponding objective function value.",
    "message_2": "The Cuckoo Search Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. It is not possible to provide an exact solution using this algorithm, as it is a stochastic search method. However, I can provide a general outline of the algorithm and guide you through the steps to solve the problem.\n\n1. Initialization: Generate an initial population of 20 random solutions (nests) within the given interval [-5, 10]. Calculate the objective function value (f(x)) for each solution.\n\n2. For each generation (up to 50 generations):\n   a. Choose a random cuckoo (solution) and generate a new solution using a Levy flight (a random walk with step sizes drawn from a Levy distribution). Ensure the new solution is within the interval [-5, 10].\n   b. Calculate the objective function value (f(x)) for the new solution.\n   c. Choose a random nest (solution) from the population. If the new solution has a better (lower) objective function value, replace the chosen nest with the new solution.\n   d. With a probability of 0.25 (discovery rate), choose a random nest and replace it with a new random solution within the interval [-5, 10].\n   e. Update the best solution found so far (the one with the lowest objective function value).\n\n3. After 50 generations, report the best solution found and its corresponding objective function value.\n\nNote that the Cuckoo Search Algorithm is a stochastic method, and the results may vary each time you run the algorithm. To obtain a more accurate solution, you can run the algorithm multiple times and choose the best result from all runs."
