    "message_1": "A solar panel company needs to decide how many solar panels to produce to maximize its profit. However, the amount of sunlight and therefore the energy output of each panel is uncertain and follows a normal distribution with mean 8 kW and standard deviation 1 kW. The company estimates that each panel costs $500 to produce and sells them for $1000 each. What is the optimal number of solar panels to produce to maximize the company's expected profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the company's expected profit, we need to find the optimal number of solar panels to produce. We can do this by calculating the expected profit for each number of solar panels produced and finding the maximum value.\n\nLet x be the number of solar panels produced. The cost of producing x solar panels is 500x. The revenue from selling x solar panels is 1000x. The profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\nProfit = 1000x - 500x\nProfit = 500x\n\nSince the energy output of each panel follows a normal distribution with mean 8 kW and standard deviation 1 kW, we can assume that the demand for solar panels is also normally distributed. However, the problem does not provide information about the relationship between the energy output and the demand for solar panels. Therefore, we cannot determine the optimal number of solar panels to produce based on the given information.\n\nIn this case, the company should consider other factors, such as market demand, production capacity, and competition, to determine the optimal number of solar panels to produce."
