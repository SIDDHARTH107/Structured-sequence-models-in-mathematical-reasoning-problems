    "message_2": "To solve the initial value problem y' = 2x, y(0) = 1 using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of 0.1 over the interval [0, 1], we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the function f(x, y) = y' = 2x\n2. Initialize the variables: x0 = 0, y0 = 1, h = 0.1, and n = 10 (since we are taking 10 steps of size 0.1 to cover the interval [0, 1])\n3. Implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method\n4. Calculate the approximate values of y at each step\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n1. f(x, y) = 2x\n\n2. x0 = 0, y0 = 1, h = 0.1, n = 10\n\n3. Fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\nFor i = 1 to n:\n  k1 = h * f(x0, y0)\n  k2 = h * f(x0 + h/2, y0 + k1/2)\n  k3 = h * f(x0 + h/2, y0 + k2/2)\n  k4 = h * f(x0 + h, y0 + k3)\n\n  y1 = y0 + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n  x1 = x0 + h\n\n  Update: x0 = x1, y0 = y1\n\n4. Calculate the approximate values of y at each step:\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n\nStep 1:\nk1 = 0.1 * f(0, 1) = 0.1 * 2 * 0 = 0\nk2 = 0.1 * f(0.05, 1) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.05 = 0.01\nk3 = 0.1 * f(0.05, 1.005) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.05 = 0.01\nk4 = 0.1 * f(0.1, 1.01) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.1 = 0.02\n\ny1 = 1 + (0 + 2 * 0.01 + 2 * 0.01 + 0.02) / 6 = 1.005\nx1 = 0 + 0.1 = 0.1\n\nStep 2:\nk1 = 0.1 * f(0.1, 1.005) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.1 = 0.02\nk2 = 0.1 * f(0.15, 1.015) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.15 = 0.03\nk3 = 0.1 * f(0.15, 1.015) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.15 = 0.03\nk4 = 0.1 * f(0.2, 1.025) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n\ny2 = 1.005 + (0.02 + 2 * 0.03 + 2 * 0.03 + 0.04) / 6 = 1.02\nx2 = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2\n\n...\n\nStep 10:\nk1 = 0.1 * f(0.9, 1.45) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.9 = 0.18\nk2 = 0.1 * f(0.95, 1.49) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.95 = 0.19\nk3 = 0.1 * f(0.95, 1.49) = 0.1 * 2 * 0.95 = 0.19\nk4 = 0.1 * f(1, 1.52) = 0.1 * 2 * 1 = 0.2\n\ny10 = 1.45 + (0.18 + 2 * 0.19 + 2 * 0.19 + 0.2) / 6 = 1.5\nx10 = 0.9 + 0.1 = 1\n\nSo, the approximate solution to the initial value problem y' = 2x, y(0) = 1 using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of 0.1 over the interval [0, 1] is y(1) â‰ˆ 1.5."
