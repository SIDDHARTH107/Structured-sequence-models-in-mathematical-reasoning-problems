    "message_2": "First, we need to find the Cartesian product A x B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A x B) x {5}. Let's denote the set (A x B) as C. So, C = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\nC x {5} = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}\n\nSo, (A x B) x {5} = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}."
