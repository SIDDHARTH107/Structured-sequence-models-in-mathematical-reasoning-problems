    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector formed by a central angle of 45 degrees, we can use the formula for the area of a sector:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r²\n\nwhere the central angle is given in degrees, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 45 degrees, and the radius is 10 cm.\n\nArea of sector = (45 / 360) × π × 10²\n\nArea of sector = (1/8) × π × 100\n\nArea of sector = 12.5 × π\n\nThe area of the sector is 12.5π square centimeters."
