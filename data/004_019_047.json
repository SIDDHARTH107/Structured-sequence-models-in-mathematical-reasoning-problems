    "message_2": "To find the velocity and acceleration of the car at t = 2 seconds, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the position function s(t).\n\nThe first derivative of s(t) with respect to t represents the velocity function, v(t):\nv(t) = ds/dt = d(3t^2 - 6t + 9)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\nv(t) = 6t - 6\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at t = 2 seconds by plugging t = 2 into the velocity function:\nv(2) = 6(2) - 6 = 12 - 6 = 6 m/s\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration function, a(t), which is the second derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to t:\na(t) = dv/dt = d(6t - 6)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\na(t) = 6\n\nSince the acceleration function is a constant, the acceleration at t = 2 seconds is the same as the acceleration at any other time:\na(2) = 6 m/s²\n\nSo, the velocity of the car at t = 2 seconds is 6 m/s and the acceleration is 6 m/s²."
