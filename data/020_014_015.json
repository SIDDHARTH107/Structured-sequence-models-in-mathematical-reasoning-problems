    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has an assembly line that produces 3 types of products, A, B and C. The assembly line can produce a maximum of 700 units per day. The profit per unit of A, B, and C is $10, $15, and $25 respectively. However, due to limited resources, the maximum number of units for A, B and C that can be produced per day are 200, 300 and 250 respectively. \n\nAssuming that the company wants to maximize its daily profit, what is the optimal number of units of each product the company should produce?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the daily profit, the company should focus on producing the products with the highest profit per unit first, while considering the maximum number of units that can be produced for each product.\n\nIn this case, the profit per unit for product C is the highest at $25, followed by product B at $15, and then product A at $10.\n\nFirst, let's produce the maximum number of units for product C, which is 250 units. This will contribute a profit of 250 * $25 = $6250.\n\nNext, let's produce the maximum number of units for product B, which is 300 units. However, since the assembly line can only produce a maximum of 700 units per day, and we have already produced 250 units of product C, we can only produce 700 - 250 = 450 units of product B. This will contribute a profit of 450 * $15 = $6750.\n\nFinally, we can produce product A. Since the assembly line is already at its maximum capacity, we cannot produce any more units of product A.\n\nSo, the optimal number of units to produce for each product is:\n- Product A: 0 units\n- Product B: 450 units\n- Product C: 250 units\n\nThe total daily profit will be $6250 (from product C) + $6750 (from product B) = $13,000."
