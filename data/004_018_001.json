    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^5 - 2x^2 + 7x - 9 using the power rule of differentiation, we need to apply the power rule to each term in the function. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\n1. For the term 4x^5, n = 5. So, the derivative is (5)(4x^(5-1)) = 20x^4.\n2. For the term -2x^2, n = 2. So, the derivative is (2)(-2x^(2-1)) = -4x.\n3. For the term 7x, n = 1. So, the derivative is (1)(7x^(1-1)) = 7.\n4. For the constant term -9, the derivative is 0, as the derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, combining the derivatives of each term, we get the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 20x^4 - 4x + 7"
