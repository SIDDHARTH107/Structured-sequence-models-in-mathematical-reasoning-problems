    "message_2": "There are five groups of order 16 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. The cyclic group of order 16, denoted by C_16. This group is generated by a single element of order 16, so it is cyclic.\n\n2. The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, denoted by C_4 × C_4. This group is not cyclic, as it has no element of order 16. However, it is not isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2, as it has elements of order 4.\n\n3. The direct product of four cyclic groups of order 2, denoted by C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2. This group is not cyclic, as it has no element of order 16. It is also not isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2, as it has more than two factors.\n\n4. The dihedral group of order 16, denoted by D_16. This group is not cyclic, as it has no element of order 16. It is also not isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2, as it has elements of order 8.\n\n5. The quaternion group of order 16, denoted by Q_16. This group is not cyclic, as it has no element of order 16. It is also not isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2, as it has elements of order 8.\n\nIn summary, only the first group (C_16) is cyclic, and none of the groups of order 16 are isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2."
