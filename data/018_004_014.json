    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to define a universal set U that contains all possible elements, including those in set A. The complement of set A, denoted as A', consists of all elements in U that are not in set A.\n\nLet's assume the universal set U contains the integers from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Now we can find the complement of set A.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nA' = {7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nTo show that the complement of set A is unique, we need to prove that there is no other set B' that can be the complement of set A. Suppose there is another set B' that is the complement of set A. Then, B' must also satisfy the condition that all elements in B' are not in set A.\n\nSince A' and B' both contain elements not in set A, and there are no other elements in the universal set U that are not in set A, A' and B' must contain the same elements. Therefore, A' = B', and the complement of set A is unique."
