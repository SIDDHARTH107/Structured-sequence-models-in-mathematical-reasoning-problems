    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the car, we need to find the second derivative of the position function s(t) with respect to time t. \n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, which represents the velocity of the car:\n\nv(t) = ds/dt = d(2t^3 - 15t^2 + 24t)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nv(t) = 6t^2 - 30t + 24\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, which represents the acceleration of the car:\n\na(t) = dv/dt = d(6t^2 - 30t + 24)/dt\n\nAgain, using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\na(t) = 12t - 30\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration at t = 4 seconds:\n\na(4) = 12(4) - 30\na(4) = 48 - 30\na(4) = 18\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car at t = 4 seconds is 18 m/sÂ²."
