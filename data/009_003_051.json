    "message_1": "Sure! Here is a precise numerical problem on Heat transfer and diffusion equations:\n\nA metal bar of length 10 cm and cross-sectional area 1 cm² is heated at one end by a flame of temperature 800°C. The other end is kept at a constant temperature of 200°C. Assuming that the initial temperature of the bar is 300°C, find the temperature distribution in the bar after 5 minutes. The thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.01 cm²/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. The equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x, t) is the temperature at position x and time t, α is the thermal diffusivity of the material, and ∂T/∂t and ∂²T/∂x² are the first and second partial derivatives of T with respect to time and position, respectively.\n\nWe are given the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0, t) = 800°C (heated end)\nT(10, t) = 200°C (cooler end)\n\nand the initial condition:\n\nT(x, 0) = 300°C (initial temperature of the bar)\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = αT(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nDividing both sides by αXT, we get:\n\n(1/αT)∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on position, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ². Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n(1/αT)∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²\n(1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²\n\nSolving the first equation for T(t), we get:\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-αλ²t)\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nSolving the second equation for X(x), we get:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants.\n\nNow we apply the boundary conditions to find the constants A, B, and λ:\n\nT(0, t) = X(0)T(t) = 800\nX(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = A = 800\n\nT(10, t) = X(10)T(t) = 200\nX(10) = 800*cos(λ*10) + B*sin(λ*10) = 200\n\nSince A = 800, we have:\n\ncos(λ*10) = 1/4\n\nSolving for λ, we get:\n\nλ*10 = arccos(1/4)\nλ = arccos(1/4) / 10\n\nNow we can write the general solution as:\n\nT(x, t) = 800*e^(-α(arccos(1/4)/10)²t) * (cos(arccos(1/4)/10 * x) + B*sin(arccos(1/4)/10 * x))\n\nTo find B, we use the initial condition T(x, 0) = 300:\n\n300 = 800 * (cos(arccos(1/4)/10 * x) + B*sin(arccos(1/4)/10 * x))\n\nSince sin(0) = 0, we have:\n\nB = (300 - 800*cos(arccos(1/4)/10 * x)) / sin(arccos(1/4)/10 * x)\n\nNow we have the temperature distribution in the bar:\n\nT(x, t) = 800*e^(-α(arccos(1/4)/10)²t) * (cos(arccos(1/4)/10 * x) + ((300 - 800*cos(arccos(1/4)/10 * x)) / sin(arccos(1/4)/10 * x))*sin(arccos(1/4)/10 * x))\n\nTo find the temperature distribution after 5 minutes (t = 300 seconds), we plug in t = 300 and the given value of α = 0.01 cm²/s:\n\nT(x, 300) = 800*e^(-0.01(arccos(1/4)/10)²*300) * (cos(arccos(1/4)/10 * x) + ((300 - 800*cos(arccos(1/4)/10 * x)) / sin(arccos(1/4)/10 * x))*sin(arccos(1/4)/10 * x))\n\nThis equation gives the temperature distribution in the metal bar after 5 minutes."
