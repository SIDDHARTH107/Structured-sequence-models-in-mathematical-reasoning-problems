    "message_1": "A company produces electronic devices and the probability of a device failing due to a certain technological issue is 0.05. If the company produces 1,000 devices, what is the probability that at least 50 devices will fail due to this technological issue?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k devices failing\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the total number of devices (1,000)\n- k is the number of failed devices (50 or more)\n- p is the probability of a device failing (0.05)\n- 1-p is the probability of a device not failing (0.95)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 50 devices failing, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 50, 51, 52, ..., 1000.\n\nHowever, calculating this directly would be very time-consuming. Instead, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring. In this case, we want to find the probability of at least 50 devices failing, so we can find the probability of fewer than 50 devices failing and subtract it from 1.\n\nP(at least 50 devices fail) = 1 - P(less than 50 devices fail)\n\nP(less than 50 devices fail) = P(0 devices fail) + P(1 device fails) + ... + P(49 devices fail)\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 49.\n\nP(at least 50 devices fail) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 49\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(at least 50 devices fail) ≈ 1 - 0.0668 = 0.9332\n\nSo, the probability that at least 50 devices will fail due to this technological issue is approximately 0.9332 or 93.32%."
