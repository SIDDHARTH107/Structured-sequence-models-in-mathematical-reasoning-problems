    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each iteration, the number of tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nTo find the total number of triangles in the 7th iteration, we first need to find the total number of tetrahedra in the 7th iteration. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal tetrahedra = 4^n\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the 7th iteration:\n\nTotal tetrahedra = 4^7 = 16,384\n\nNow, each tetrahedron has 4 faces, which are triangles. So, to find the total number of triangles in the 7th iteration, we multiply the total number of tetrahedra by 4:\n\nTotal triangles = 16,384 * 4 = 65,536\n\nSo, there will be 65,536 triangles in the 7th iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid construction."
