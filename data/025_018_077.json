    "message_2": "Let's first find the dimension of the vector space of complex polynomials in two variables up to degree 3. A complex polynomial in two variables x and y can be written as:\n\nP(x, y) = a_0,0 + a_1,0x + a_0,1y + a_2,0x^2 + a_1,1xy + a_0,2y^2 + a_3,0x^3 + a_2,1x^2y + a_1,2xy^2 + a_0,3y^3\n\nThere are 10 coefficients (a_i,j) in total, so the dimension of the vector space of complex polynomials in two variables up to degree 3 is 10.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that the polynomial vanishes at 6 points in the complex plane. Let these points be (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_6, y_6). For each of these points, we have a linear equation in the coefficients of the polynomial:\n\nP(x_i, y_i) = 0, for i = 1, 2, ..., 6\n\nThese 6 linear equations form a system of linear equations in the 10 coefficients of the polynomial. The rank of this system is at most 6, since there are only 6 equations. Therefore, the dimension of the subspace of polynomials that vanish at these 6 points is at least 10 - 6 = 4.\n\nSo, the math student can find at least 4 linearly independent polynomials of degree 3 that vanish at the given 6 points in the complex plane."
