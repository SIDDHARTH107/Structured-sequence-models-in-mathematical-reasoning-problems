    "message_2": "To find the minimum point of the function f(x) = sin(x) + 0.5sin(3x) using particle swarm optimization (PSO), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the swarm: Create a population of particles with random positions and velocities within the search space (-10, 10).\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each particle: Calculate the value of f(x) for each particle's position.\n3. Update personal best and global best: If a particle's current position has a better fitness than its personal best, update its personal best. If the personal best of any particle is better than the global best, update the global best.\n4. Update the velocity and position of each particle: Use the PSO update equations to update the velocity and position of each particle.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a certain number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nHere's a simple implementation of PSO to find the minimum point of the function:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef f(x):\n    return math.sin(x) + 0.5 * math.sin(3 * x)\n\ndef pso(iterations, swarm_size, w, c1, c2):\n    # Initialize the swarm\n    particles = [{'position': random.uniform(-10, 10), 'velocity': random.uniform(-1, 1)} for _ in range(swarm_size)]\n    for particle in particles:\n        particle['pbest'] = particle['position']\n        particle['pbest_fitness'] = f(particle['position'])\n\n    gbest = min(particles, key=lambda x: x['pbest_fitness'])\n    gbest_fitness = gbest['pbest_fitness']\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        for particle in particles:\n            # Update velocity\n            r1, r2 = random.random(), random.random()\n            particle['velocity'] = w * particle['velocity'] + c1 * r1 * (particle['pbest'] - particle['position']) + c2 * r2 * (gbest['pbest'] - particle['position'])\n\n            # Update position\n            particle['position'] += particle['velocity']\n\n            # Evaluate fitness\n            fitness = f(particle['position'])\n\n            # Update personal best\n            if fitness < particle['pbest_fitness']:\n                particle['pbest'] = particle['position']\n                particle['pbest_fitness'] = fitness\n\n                # Update global best\n                if fitness < gbest_fitness:\n                    gbest = particle\n                    gbest_fitness = fitness\n\n    return gbest['pbest'], gbest_fitness\n\n# Run PSO\niterations = 1000\nswarm_size = 30\nw = 0.7\nc1 = 1.5\nc2 = 1.5\n\nmin_x, min_value = pso(iterations, swarm_size, w, c1, c2)\nprint(\"Minimum point of the function: x =\", min_x, \", f(x) =\", min_value)\n```\n\nThis implementation may not always find the exact minimum point due to the stochastic nature of PSO, but it should provide a good approximation. You can adjust the parameters (iterations, swarm_size, w, c1, and c2) to improve the performance of the algorithm."
