    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to the subtopic of using the Fourier transform to solve problems in materials science:\n\nA researcher needs to determine the diffusivity (D) of a material used in a solar cell by measuring the laser-induced carrier density in a pump-probe experiment. The carrier density (n) at a position (x) and time (t) can be measured using a photodetector. The photodetector signal (I) is proportional to the carrier density (n) and can be expressed as:\n\nI(x,t) = α ∫n(x,t') e^-t'/τ dt'\n\nwhere α is a proportionality constant, τ is the photodetector time constant and the integral is taken over all times before the laser pulse. The carrier density (n) can be written as:\n\nn(x,t) = No {1 + erf[(x - vt)/2√Dt]}\n\nwhere No is the carrier density at time zero, v is the velocity of the front of the carrier distribution and D is the diffusivity of the material.\n\nGiven that No = 1 x 10^18 cm^-3, v = 5 x 10^7 cm/s, and τ = 1 ns, use the Fourier transform to determine the diffusivity (D) of the material.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first express the photodetector signal (I) in terms of the carrier density (n) and then use the Fourier transform to find the diffusivity (D).\n\n1. Express I(x,t) in terms of n(x,t):\n\nI(x,t) = α ∫n(x,t') e^(-t'/τ) dt'\n\nSubstitute the expression for n(x,t) into the integral:\n\nI(x,t) = α ∫[No {1 + erf[(x - vt')/2√Dt']} e^(-t'/τ) dt']\n\n2. Apply the Fourier transform:\n\nThe Fourier transform of I(x,t) with respect to t is:\n\nI(x,ω) = F{I(x,t)} = α ∫[No {1 + erf[(x - vt')/2√Dt']} e^(-t'/τ) e^(-iωt')] dt'\n\n3. Solve the integral:\n\nThe integral is quite complex and cannot be solved analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to solve the integral for a range of ω values.\n\n4. Inverse Fourier transform:\n\nOnce we have the numerical solution for I(x,ω), we can use the inverse Fourier transform to find I(x,t):\n\nI(x,t) = F^-1{I(x,ω)}\n\n5. Determine the diffusivity (D):\n\nNow that we have I(x,t) in terms of n(x,t), we can use the given values of No, v, and τ to find the diffusivity (D). We can do this by fitting the experimental data to the theoretical expression for I(x,t) and finding the value of D that minimizes the difference between the experimental and theoretical values.\n\nUsing numerical methods, we can find the diffusivity (D) of the material."
