    "message_2": "Let's use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. We have 6 people, and each person shakes hands with exactly 3 other people. We want to find the minimum number of handshakes so that there are at least 3 people who have shaken hands with each other.\n\nLet's consider the handshakes of each person as a \"pigeonhole\" and the people themselves as \"pigeons.\" Since each person shakes hands with 3 other people, there are 3 \"pigeons\" in each \"pigeonhole.\"\n\nNow, let's try to distribute the handshakes among the people in such a way that no 3 people have shaken hands with each other. We can do this by arranging the people in a circle and having each person shake hands with the two people next to them and the person directly across from them. In this arrangement, each person shakes hands with exactly 3 other people, and no 3 people have shaken hands with each other.\n\nHowever, this arrangement is not possible because there are 6 people in the group, and each person shakes hands with 3 other people, which means there would be a total of (6 * 3) / 2 = 9 handshakes. But, in the circle arrangement, there are only 6 handshakes (each person shaking hands with the two people next to them) plus 3 handshakes (each person shaking hands with the person directly across from them), which equals 9 handshakes.\n\nSince we cannot distribute the handshakes in such a way that no 3 people have shaken hands with each other, there must be at least 3 people who have shaken hands with each other. Therefore, the minimum number of handshakes that must occur in this group so that there are at least 3 people who have shaken hands with each other is 9."
