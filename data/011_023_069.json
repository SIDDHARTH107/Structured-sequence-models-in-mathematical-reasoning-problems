    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices, we need to consider the maximum degree of a vertex in the graph, which is the largest number of edges connected to a single vertex. This is because a vertex with the maximum degree will require the most colors to ensure that no adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nIn a graph with 7 vertices, the maximum possible degree of a vertex is 6, which occurs when a vertex is connected to all other vertices. However, the actual maximum degree of the graph in question might be lower, depending on the specific connections between vertices.\n\nIn general, the minimum number of colors needed to properly color a graph is equal to the maximum degree of a vertex plus 1. This is because each vertex can be assigned a color that is different from all of its adjacent vertices, and the maximum degree determines the maximum number of adjacent vertices.\n\nSo, to properly color the vertices in a graph with 7 vertices, we need to know the maximum degree of a vertex in the graph. If the maximum degree is d, then the minimum number of colors needed is d + 1."
