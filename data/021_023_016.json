    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of grey wolves. To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x + 5 within the interval [-4, 4], we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the GWO parameters: population size, number of iterations, and search space boundaries.\n2. Generate an initial population of candidate solutions (wolves).\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each wolf in the population.\n4. Update the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves (the three best solutions).\n5. Update the positions of the other wolves based on the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the specified number of iterations.\n7. Return the position of the alpha wolf as the minimum value of the function.\n\nHere's a simplified Python implementation of the GWO algorithm:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**3 - 6*x**2 + 11*x + 5\n\ndef GWO(pop_size, max_iter, lb, ub):\n    # Initialize population\n    wolves = np.random.uniform(lb, ub, pop_size)\n    fitness = np.array([f(wolf) for wolf in wolves])\n\n    # Find initial alpha, beta, and delta wolves\n    sorted_indices = np.argsort(fitness)\n    alpha, beta, delta = wolves[sorted_indices[:3]]\n\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        # Update positions of wolves\n        for i, wolf in enumerate(wolves):\n            a = 2 * np.random.rand() - 1\n            A = 2 * a * (alpha - wolf)\n            C = 2 * np.random.rand() * alpha\n            X_alpha = C - A\n\n            a = 2 * np.random.rand() - 1\n            A = 2 * a * (beta - wolf)\n            C = 2 * np.random.rand() * beta\n            X_beta = C - A\n\n            a = 2 * np.random.rand() - 1\n            A = 2 * a * (delta - wolf)\n            C = 2 * np.random.rand() * delta\n            X_delta = C - A\n\n            wolves[i] = (X_alpha + X_beta + X_delta) / 3\n\n            # Ensure wolf position is within bounds\n            wolves[i] = np.clip(wolves[i], lb, ub)\n\n            # Update fitness\n            fitness[i] = f(wolves[i])\n\n        # Update alpha, beta, and delta wolves\n        sorted_indices = np.argsort(fitness)\n        alpha, beta, delta = wolves[sorted_indices[:3]]\n\n    return alpha, f(alpha)\n\npop_size = 50\nmax_iter = 100\nlb, ub = -4, 4\nalpha, min_value = GWO(pop_size, max_iter, lb, ub)\nprint(f\"Minimum value: {min_value} at x = {alpha}\")\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified version of the GWO algorithm and may not provide the most accurate results. For a more robust implementation, consider using an optimization library or package that includes GWO."
