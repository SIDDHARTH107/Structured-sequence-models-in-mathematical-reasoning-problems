    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. To calculate φ(n) for a given n, we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nIn this case, n = 15. The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5. So, we have:\n\nφ(15) = 15 * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/5)\nφ(15) = 15 * (2/3) * (4/5)\nφ(15) = (15 * 2 * 4) / (3 * 5)\nφ(15) = 120 / 15\nφ(15) = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 positive integers less than or equal to 15 that are relatively prime to 15."
