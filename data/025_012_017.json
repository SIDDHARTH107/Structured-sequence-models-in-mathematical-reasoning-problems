    "message_2": "To find the equation of an elliptic curve in short Weierstrass form, we need to find the coefficients a and b such that the equation is of the form:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + ax + b\n\nWe are given three points on the curve: (0,0), (2,-1), and (4,5). We can use these points to form a system of equations to solve for a and b.\n\nFor point (0,0):\n0^2 = 0^3 + a(0) + b\n0 = b\n\nFor point (2,-1):\n(-1)^2 = 2^3 + a(2) + 0\n1 = 8 + 2a\na = -7/2\n\nNow we have the equation of the elliptic curve in short Weierstrass form:\n\ny^2 = x^3 - (7/2)x\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the additional properties of the curve:\n\n1. The curve has a point of order 7.\n2. The curve has no points of order 11 or 13.\n\nThese properties are related to the group structure of the elliptic curve and cannot be directly incorporated into the short Weierstrass form. To verify these properties, one would need to compute the group structure of the curve and check if it satisfies the given conditions. This process is beyond the scope of a simple mathematical calculation and would require more advanced techniques and tools, such as the Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm for counting points on elliptic curves.\n\nIn summary, the equation of the elliptic curve in short Weierstrass form is:\n\ny^2 = x^3 - (7/2)x\n\nHowever, it is not possible to directly verify the additional properties of the curve using this form alone."
