Divide the larger number (54) by the smaller number (24) and find the remainder.\n   54 รท 24 = 2 with a remainder of 6.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (54) with the smaller number (24) and the smaller number with the remainder (6) from the previous step.\n\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the remainder is 0.\n\n   24 รท 6 = 4 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 6.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 54 and 24 is 6."
