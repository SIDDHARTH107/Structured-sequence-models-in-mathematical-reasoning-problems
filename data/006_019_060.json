    "message_1": "What is the probability that a randomly selected person from a country will vote for a certain political party in the upcoming election? Assume that there are only two major political parties in the country and that there are no independent or third-party candidates running in this election. The party's current approval rating is 42%, and the latest poll survey conducted with 3000 randomly selected participants showed that 1300 of them are likely to vote for the party.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected person will vote for the certain political party, we can use the information provided in the poll survey. \n\nOut of the 3000 randomly selected participants, 1300 are likely to vote for the party. Therefore, the probability of a randomly selected person voting for the party is:\n\n1300 (number of people likely to vote for the party) / 3000 (total number of participants) = 0.4333\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected person will vote for the certain political party in the upcoming election is approximately 43.33%."
