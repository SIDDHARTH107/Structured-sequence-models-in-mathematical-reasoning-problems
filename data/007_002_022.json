    "message_2": "If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 9, then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Since the sum of the digits is 36, which is divisible by 9 (9 * 4 = 36), the number itself is also divisible by 9. Therefore, the remainder when the number is divided by 9 is 0."
