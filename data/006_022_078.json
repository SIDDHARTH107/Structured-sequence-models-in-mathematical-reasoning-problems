    "message_1": "A school has a total of 600 students, out of which 280 are boys and 320 are girls. The probability of a boy getting selected for a science competition is 0.6 and the probability of a girl getting selected is 0.4. What is the probability that the students getting selected for the competition are both a boy and a girl?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the students getting selected for the competition are both a boy and a girl, we can use the formula:\n\nP(both a boy and a girl) = P(boy) * P(girl)\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of selecting a boy and a girl from the total students.\n\nP(boy) = number of boys / total students = 280 / 600 = 7/15\nP(girl) = number of girls / total students = 320 / 600 = 8/15\n\nNext, we need to find the probability of a boy and a girl getting selected for the competition.\n\nP(boy selected) = P(boy) * probability of a boy getting selected = (7/15) * 0.6 = 7/25\nP(girl selected) = P(girl) * probability of a girl getting selected = (8/15) * 0.4 = 8/25\n\nNow, we can find the probability that the students getting selected for the competition are both a boy and a girl.\n\nP(both a boy and a girl) = P(boy selected) * P(girl selected) = (7/25) * (8/25) = 56/625\n\nSo, the probability that the students getting selected for the competition are both a boy and a girl is 56/625."
