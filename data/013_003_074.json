    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player 1 has been given $100 to split with Player 2. Player 1 proposes a split and Player 2 must decide whether to accept or reject. If Player 2 accepts, both players get the agreed-upon amounts. If Player 2 rejects, neither player gets anything. The catch is that Player 2 knows the split beforehand and may reject if they feel it is unfair. What is the minimum amount Player 1 must offer to ensure that Player 2 agrees?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the minimum amount Player 1 must offer to ensure that Player 2 agrees can vary depending on the rationality and preferences of Player 2. However, in a purely rational scenario, Player 1 could offer the smallest possible amount greater than $0, for example, $1. In this case, Player 2 would accept the offer since $1 is better than getting nothing at all. So, the minimum amount Player 1 must offer to ensure that Player 2 agrees is $1. However, it is important to note that human behavior may not always follow this purely rational approach, and Player 2 might reject the offer if they perceive it as unfair."
