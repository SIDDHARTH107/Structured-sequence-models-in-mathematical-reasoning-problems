    "message_1": "A 100 N force is applied to push a crate with a mass of 50 kg a distance of 10 meters along a straight path that is inclined at an angle of 30 degrees with the horizontal. Assuming that the coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the surface is 0.2, use integration to find the work done by the force.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we need to consider the force components along the inclined plane and the force of friction acting against the motion. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the gravitational force acting on the crate along the inclined plane:\nF_gravity = m * g * sin(theta)\nwhere m = 50 kg (mass of the crate), g = 9.81 m/s² (acceleration due to gravity), and theta = 30 degrees (angle of inclination).\n\nF_gravity = 50 * 9.81 * sin(30) = 50 * 9.81 * 0.5 = 245.25 N\n\n2. Calculate the force of friction acting against the motion:\nF_friction = μ * F_normal\nwhere μ = 0.2 (coefficient of kinetic friction) and F_normal = m * g * cos(theta) (normal force).\n\nF_normal = 50 * 9.81 * cos(30) = 50 * 9.81 * 0.866 = 424.215 N\nF_friction = 0.2 * 424.215 = 84.843 N\n\n3. Calculate the net force acting along the inclined plane:\nF_net = F_applied - F_gravity - F_friction\nwhere F_applied = 100 N (applied force).\n\nF_net = 100 - 245.25 - 84.843 = -230.093 N\n\nSince the net force is negative, it means the applied force is not enough to move the crate along the inclined plane. Therefore, the work done by the force is zero."
