    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = sin(1/z) centered at z = 0, we first need to express sin(1/z) in terms of its power series expansion. Recall that the power series expansion of sin(x) is given by:\n\nsin(x) = ∑((-1)^n * x^(2n+1)) / (2n+1)!, for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nNow, we substitute x = 1/z into the power series expansion:\n\nsin(1/z) = ∑((-1)^n * (1/z)^(2n+1)) / (2n+1)!\n\nNow, we can rewrite the series in terms of z:\n\nsin(1/z) = ∑((-1)^n * z^(-2n-1)) / (2n+1)!, for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = sin(1/z) centered at z = 0. The series converges in the annulus 1 < |z| < 2, as required."
