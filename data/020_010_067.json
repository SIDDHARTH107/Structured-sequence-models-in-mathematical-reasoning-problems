    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The cost of producing one unit of A and B is $5 and $8 respectively. The selling price of A and B is $9 and $14 respectively. Due to market volatility, the selling price of both products may vary by a maximum of 10%. Determine the number of units of each product to be produced to maximize the profit, considering this uncertainty in pricing.\n\nAssuming the production capacity is unlimited, what is the optimal number of units of product A and B to produce to maximize the profit, considering the uncertainty in pricing?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal production ratio of product A and B considering the uncertainty in pricing. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe profit function can be written as:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nRevenue for product A = (Selling price of A) * x\nRevenue for product B = (Selling price of B) * y\n\nCost for product A = (Cost of producing A) * x\nCost for product B = (Cost of producing B) * y\n\nProfit = (9x + 14y) - (5x + 8y)\n\nSimplify the profit function:\n\nProfit = 4x + 6y\n\nNow, we need to consider the uncertainty in pricing. The selling price of both products may vary by a maximum of 10%.\n\nMinimum selling price of A = 9 * (1 - 0.1) = 8.1\nMaximum selling price of A = 9 * (1 + 0.1) = 9.9\n\nMinimum selling price of B = 14 * (1 - 0.1) = 12.6\nMaximum selling price of B = 14 * (1 + 0.1) = 15.4\n\nTo maximize the profit, we should produce more units of the product with the highest profit margin (selling price - cost price) when considering the uncertainty in pricing.\n\nProfit margin for product A at minimum selling price = 8.1 - 5 = 3.1\nProfit margin for product A at maximum selling price = 9.9 - 5 = 4.9\n\nProfit margin for product B at minimum selling price = 12.6 - 8 = 4.6\nProfit margin for product B at maximum selling price = 15.4 - 8 = 7.4\n\nComparing the profit margins, we can see that product B has a higher profit margin at both minimum and maximum selling prices. Therefore, to maximize the profit, the company should focus on producing more units of product B.\n\nSince the production capacity is unlimited, the optimal number of units to produce for product A (x) can be any non-negative number, and the optimal number of units to produce for product B (y) should be as high as possible."
