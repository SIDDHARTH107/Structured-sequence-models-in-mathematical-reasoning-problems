DE (6)\n4. AB (4)\n5. AC (9)\n6. BC (9)\n7. CF (7)\n\nNow, we start adding the edges to the minimum weight spanning tree in the order listed above, making sure not to form any cycles.\n\n1. Add EF (2)\n2. Add BE (3)\n3. Adding DE (6) would form a cycle with BE and EF, so we skip it.\n4. Add AB (4)\n5. Adding AC (9) would form a cycle with AB and BE, so we skip it.\n6. Adding BC (9) would form a cycle with AB and BE, so we skip it.\n7. Add CF (7)\n\nThe minimum weight spanning tree is now complete, with the following edges and their weights:\n\n1. AB (4)\n2. BE (3)\n3. EF (2)\n4. CF (7)\n\nThe total weight of the minimum weight spanning tree is 4 + 3 + 2 + 7 = 16."
