    "message_2": "First, we need to compute n and φ(n):\n\nn = p * q = 17 * 23 = 391\n\nφ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = (17 - 1) * (23 - 1) = 16 * 22 = 352\n\nNow, we need to find the private key d such that:\n\nd * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n\nIn our case, e = 7 and φ(n) = 352. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of e.\n\nExtended Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize: r0 = 352, r1 = 7, t0 = 0, t1 = 1\n2. Divide: q = r0 // r1 = 352 // 7 = 50\n3. Update: r2 = r0 - q * r1 = 352 - 50 * 7 = 2, t2 = t0 - q * t1 = 0 - 50 * 1 = -50\n4. Update: r0 = r1, r1 = r2, t0 = t1, t1 = t2\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until r1 = 1\n\nIteration 1:\nr0 = 7, r1 = 2, t0 = 1, t1 = -50\nq = 7 // 2 = 3\nr2 = 7 - 3 * 2 = 1, t2 = 1 - 3 * (-50) = 151\n\nSince r1 = 1, we have found the modular inverse of e:\n\nd = t1 = 151\n\nNow, we can decrypt the ciphertext C = 10 using the private key d:\n\nM = C^d mod n = 10^151 mod 391\n\nWe can use the square-and-multiply algorithm to compute this efficiently:\n\n1. Write d in binary: 151 = 10010111\n2. Initialize: result = 1\n3. For each bit of d (from left to right):\n   - Square: result = (result * result) mod n\n   - If the bit is 1, multiply: result = (result * C) mod n\n\nIteration 1 (first bit is 1): result = (1 * 1 * 10) mod 391 = 10\nIteration 2 (second bit is 0): result = (10 * 10) mod 391 = 100\nIteration 3 (third bit is 0): result = (100 * 100) mod 391 = 16\nIteration 4 (fourth bit is 1): result = (16 * 16 * 10) mod 391 = 2560 mod 391 = 46\nIteration 5 (fifth bit is 0): result = (46 * 46) mod 391 = 2116 mod 391 = 64\nIteration 6 (sixth bit is 1): result = (64 * 64 * 10) mod 391 = 40960 mod 391 = 121\nIteration 7 (seventh bit is 1): result = (121 * 121 * 10) mod 391 = 146410 mod 391 = 214\nIteration 8 (eighth bit is 1): result = (214 * 214 * 10) mod 391 = 457960 mod 391 = 88\n\nThe decrypted message M is 88."
