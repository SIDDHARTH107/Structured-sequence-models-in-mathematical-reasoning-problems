    "message_2": "Suppose there exists a group G of order 10 that is isomorphic to the direct product of two nontrivial groups H and K, i.e., G ≅ H × K. Let |H| = m and |K| = n, where m and n are positive integers greater than 1. Then, |G| = |H × K| = mn.\n\nSince |G| = 10, we have mn = 10. The only possible factor pairs of 10 are (1, 10) and (2, 5). Since m and n are greater than 1, we must have (m, n) = (2, 5) or (5, 2). Without loss of generality, let m = 2 and n = 5.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. Therefore, H is a subgroup of order 2 and K is a subgroup of order 5. Since 2 and 5 are prime, H and K must be cyclic groups, i.e., H ≅ Z_2 and K ≅ Z_5.\n\nNow, consider the direct product H × K ≅ Z_2 × Z_5. The elements of Z_2 × Z_5 can be represented as pairs (a, b), where a ∈ Z_2 and b ∈ Z_5. The group operation is component-wise addition modulo the respective orders, i.e., (a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c mod 2, b + d mod 5).\n\nNotice that the order of an element (a, b) in Z_2 × Z_5 is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of a and b. Since the orders of a and b are at most 2 and 5, respectively, the order of (a, b) is at most LCM(2, 5) = 10. Therefore, Z_2 × Z_5 has an element of order 10.\n\nHowever, this contradicts the fact that G has no element of order 10. Recall that if a group has an element of the same order as the group, then the group must be cyclic. Since G has order 10, if it had an element of order 10, it would be a cyclic group. But G is assumed to be isomorphic to the direct product of two nontrivial groups, which means it cannot be cyclic.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there exists a group G of order 10 that is isomorphic to the direct product of two nontrivial groups H and K must be false."
