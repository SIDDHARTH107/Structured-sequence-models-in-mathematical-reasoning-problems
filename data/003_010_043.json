    "message_1": "A building is 50 meters tall. If you stand 30 meters away from the base of the building and look up at an angle of 60 degrees from the ground, what is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. Specifically, we can use the tangent function, which relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (height of the building) and the adjacent side (distance from the base of the building).\n\nLet's denote the angle of elevation as θ, the height of the building as h, and the distance from the base of the building as d. In this case, θ = 60 degrees, d = 30 meters, and we want to find h.\n\nThe tangent function is defined as:\n\ntan(θ) = h / d\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ (in radians) = θ (in degrees) * (π / 180)\nθ = 60 * (π / 180) = π / 3\n\nNow, we can use the tangent function:\n\ntan(π / 3) = h / 30\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 30:\n\n30 * tan(π / 3) = h\n\nNow, we can calculate the tangent of π / 3:\n\ntan(π / 3) ≈ 1.732\n\nFinally, we can find the height:\n\n30 * 1.732 ≈ 51.96 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 51.96 meters."
