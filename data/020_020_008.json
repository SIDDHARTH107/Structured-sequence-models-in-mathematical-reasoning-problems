    "message_1": "An engineering company needs to design a rectangular box with a volume of 1000 cubic meters. The cost of the material used to build the base of the box is $10 per square meter, and the cost of material used for the sides of the box is $8 per square meter. What is the minimum cost of building the box?",
    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be length (L), width (W), and height (H). The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = L * W * H = 1000 cubic meters\n\nThe cost of the material for the base is $10 per square meter, and the base area is L * W. So, the cost of the base is:\n\nCost_base = 10 * L * W\n\nThe cost of the material for the sides is $8 per square meter. There are 4 sides, with areas L * H, W * H, L * H, and W * H. So, the cost of the sides is:\n\nCost_sides = 8 * (2 * L * H + 2 * W * H) = 16 * (L * H + W * H)\n\nThe total cost of the box is the sum of the cost of the base and the cost of the sides:\n\nCost_total = Cost_base + Cost_sides = 10 * L * W + 16 * (L * H + W * H)\n\nTo minimize the cost, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a new variable λ (the Lagrange multiplier) and form the following equation:\n\nF(L, W, H, λ) = 10 * L * W + 16 * (L * H + W * H) - λ * (L * W * H - 1000)\n\nNow we take the partial derivatives with respect to L, W, H, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂F/∂L = 10 * W + 16 * H - λ * W * H = 0\n∂F/∂W = 10 * L + 16 * H - λ * L * H = 0\n∂F/∂H = 16 * (L + W) - λ * L * W = 0\n∂F/∂λ = L * W * H - 1000 = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that:\n\nL = 10 meters\nW = 10 meters\nH = 10 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that minimize the cost are 10 meters by 10 meters by 10 meters. Now we can calculate the minimum cost:\n\nCost_total = 10 * L * W + 16 * (L * H + W * H)\nCost_total = 10 * 10 * 10 + 16 * (10 * 10 + 10 * 10)\nCost_total = 1000 + 16 * 200\nCost_total = 1000 + 3200\nCost_total = $4200\n\nThe minimum cost of building the box is $4200."
