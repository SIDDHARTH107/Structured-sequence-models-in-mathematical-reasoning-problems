    "message_1": "The problem is: \nSolve the following system of linear equations with noisy data using Gaussian elimination:\n\\begin{equation*}\nx + y + z = 6.3 \\\\\n2x - 3y + z = -4.4 \\\\\n3x + 4y - 2z = 5.5 \\\\\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere the coefficients of the equations are known exactly, but the right-hand side has a measurement error of $\\pm 0.2$ units for each equation.",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 6.3 \\\\\n2 & -3 & 1 & -4.4 \\\\\n3 & 4 & -2 & 5.5 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we perform Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 6.3 \\\\\n0 & -5 & -1 & -16 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -5 & -13.4 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n2. Divide the second row by -5, and add the second row to the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 6.3 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1/5 & 3.2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -24/5 & -16.6 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n3. Multiply the third row by -5/24, and subtract 1/5 times the third row from the second row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 6.3 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 2.5 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 3.45 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n4. Finally, subtract the third row from the first row, and subtract the second row from the first row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0.35 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 2.5 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 3.45 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is approximately $x \\approx 0.35$, $y \\approx 2.5$, and $z \\approx 3.45$. However, since there is a measurement error of $\\pm 0.2$ units for each equation, the true values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ might be slightly different."
