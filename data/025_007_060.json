    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology groups $H^2(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(k))$ for $k=1, 2, 3$, we will use the Serre duality theorem. The Serre duality theorem states that for a smooth projective variety $X$ of dimension $n$ over an algebraically closed field $k$, and a coherent sheaf $\\mathcal{F}$ on $X$, we have:\n\n$$H^i(X, \\mathcal{F}) \\cong H^{n-i}(X, \\omega_X \\otimes \\mathcal{F}^{\\vee})^{\\vee}$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_X$ is the canonical sheaf of $X$, $\\mathcal{F}^{\\vee}$ is the dual sheaf of $\\mathcal{F}$, and $(-)^{\\vee}$ denotes the dual vector space.\n\nIn our case, $X$ is a smooth cubic curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2_{\\mathbb{C}}$, so it has dimension $n=1$. The canonical sheaf of a smooth curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2_{\\mathbb{C}}$ of degree $d$ is given by $\\omega_X \\cong \\mathcal{O}_X(3-d)$. Since our curve is cubic, we have $d=3$, so $\\omega_X \\cong \\mathcal{O}_X(0)$.\n\nNow, we want to compute $H^2(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(k))$ for $k=1, 2, 3$. By Serre duality, we have:\n\n$$H^2(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(k)) \\cong H^{1-2}(X, \\omega_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_X(-k))^{\\vee} = H^{-1}(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(-k))^{\\vee}$$\n\nSince cohomology groups are trivial for negative indices, we have:\n\n$$H^2(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(k)) \\cong 0$$\n\nfor $k=1, 2, 3$."
