    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the curve, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. Let's define the function F(x, y) as follows:\n\nF(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 2x^2\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 - 4x\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nA singular point occurs when both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n-3x^2 - 4x = 0\n2y = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, we get y = 0. Now, let's solve the first equation for x:\n\nx(-3x - 4) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x: x = 0 and x = -4/3.\n\nNow, we need to check if these values of x satisfy the original equation of the curve:\n\n1) For x = 0:\n\ny^2 = 0^3 + 2(0)^2\ny^2 = 0\n\nSo, y = 0.\n\nThe first singular point is (0, 0).\n\n2) For x = -4/3:\n\ny^2 = (-4/3)^3 + 2(-4/3)^2\ny^2 = -64/27 + 32/9\ny^2 = 0\n\nSo, y = 0.\n\nThe second singular point is (-4/3, 0).\n\nThus, the curve has two singular points: (0, 0) and (-4/3, 0)."
