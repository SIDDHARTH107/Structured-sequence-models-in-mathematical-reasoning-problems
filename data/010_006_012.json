Define a continuous function f from X to Y such that f reduces to the identity map on the boundary of X. Determine the homotopy class of f relative to the boundary of X.\n\n(Note: The answer will involve the fundamental group of Y with respect to the basepoint at (1,0).)",
    "message_2": "To determine the homotopy class of f relative to the boundary of X, we first need to understand the fundamental group of Y, which is the circle. The fundamental group of a circle is isomorphic to the integers, denoted as π₁(Y) ≅ ℤ, with respect to the basepoint (1,0).\n\nNow, let's consider the continuous function f: X → Y such that f reduces to the identity map on the boundary of X. This means that f maps the boundary of the rectangle X to the basepoint (1,0) in Y. \n\nSince f is continuous and maps the boundary of X to the basepoint in Y, we can define a homotopy H: X × [0,1] → Y such that H(x,0) = f(x) and H(x,1) = (1,0) for all x in the boundary of X. This homotopy H is a deformation of f that keeps the boundary of X fixed at the basepoint (1,0) in Y.\n\nNow, we need to determine the homotopy class of f relative to the boundary of X. Since f maps the boundary of X to the basepoint (1,0) in Y, the homotopy class of f will be determined by the number of times f wraps around the circle Y. This is represented by an integer n, where n ∈ ℤ.\n\nThus, the homotopy class of f relative to the boundary of X is [f] = n, where n is an integer representing the number of times f wraps around the circle Y."
