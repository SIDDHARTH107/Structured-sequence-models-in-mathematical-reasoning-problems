    "message_2": "There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 25, where 5 is prime. These groups are:\n\n1. The cyclic group of order 25, denoted as C_25 or Z_25. This group has the structure {0, 1, 2, ..., 24} with addition modulo 25 as the group operation. It is generated by a single element, for example, 1, since 1 has order 25 in the group.\n\n2. The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, denoted as C_5 × C_5. This group has the structure {(a, b) | a, b ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}}, with component-wise addition modulo 5 as the group operation. It can be generated by two elements, for example, (1, 0) and (0, 1), each of order 5.\n\nThese are the only non-isomorphic groups of order 25, as the number of groups of order p^2 (where p is prime) is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of groups = 1 + (p^2 - p) / 2\n\nIn this case, p = 5, so the number of groups is:\n\nNumber of groups = 1 + (25 - 5) / 2 = 1 + 20 / 2 = 1 + 10 = 11\n\nHowever, since we are only considering non-isomorphic groups, we have two groups: C_25 and C_5 × C_5."
