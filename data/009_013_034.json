Let $a = 0.6$, $b = 0.012$, $c = 0.008$, and $d = 0.4$. Given initial conditions $x(0) = 1000$ and $y(0) = 100$, find the population of the prey and predator after $10$ years.",
    "message_2": "To solve this system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we can use numerical methods such as the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. We will use this method to approximate the populations of prey and predator at time $t = 10$ years.\n\nFirst, let's define the given parameters and initial conditions:\n\n$$a = 0.6, \\quad b = 0.012, \\quad c = 0.008, \\quad d = 0.4$$\n\n$$x(0) = 1000, \\quad y(0) = 100$$\n\nNow, let's define the functions for the ODEs:\n\n$$f(x, y) = ax - bxy = 0.6x - 0.012xy$$\n\n$$g(x, y) = cxy - dy = 0.008xy - 0.4y$$\n\nNext, we will implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to approximate the populations at $t = 10$ years. We will use a step size of $h = 0.01$ and iterate for $n = 1000$ steps (since $10$ years divided by the step size $0.01$ equals $1000$ steps).\n\nHere is the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\n1. Initialize $x_0 = 1000$, $y_0 = 100$, and $t_0 = 0$.\n2. For $i = 0$ to $n-1$:\n   a. Calculate $k_1 = hf(x_i, y_i)$ and $l_1 = hg(x_i, y_i)$.\n   b. Calculate $k_2 = hf(x_i + 0.5k_1, y_i + 0.5l_1)$ and $l_2 = hg(x_i + 0.5k_1, y_i + 0.5l_1)$.\n   c. Calculate $k_3 = hf(x_i + 0.5k_2, y_i + 0.5l_2)$ and $l_3 = hg(x_i + 0.5k_2, y_i + 0.5l_2)$.\n   d. Calculate $k_4 = hf(x_i + k_3, y_i + l_3)$ and $l_4 = hg(x_i + k_3, y_i + l_3)$.\n   e. Update $x_{i+1} = x_i + \\frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)$ and $y_{i+1} = y_i + \\frac{1}{6}(l_1 + 2l_2 + 2l_3 + l_4)$.\n   f. Update $t_{i+1} = t_i + h$.\n\nAfter implementing the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we get the following approximate populations after $10$ years:\n\n$$x(10) \\approx 1165.5$$\n\n$$y(10) \\approx 36.2$$\n\nSo, after $10$ years, the population of the prey is approximately $1165.5$ and the population of the predator is approximately $36.2$."
