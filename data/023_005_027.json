    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. The Fourier transform of a function y(x) is defined as:\n\nY(ω) = ∫[y(x) * e^(-iωx)] dx\n\nwhere Y(ω) is the Fourier transform of y(x), and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nLet's find the Fourier transform of the given differential equation:\n\ny''(x) + 4y(x) = 10sin(3x)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides:\n\nd²Y(ω)/dω² + 4Y(ω) = 10 * (δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3))\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we have a second-order ordinary differential equation in the frequency domain. To solve this equation, we need to find the particular and homogeneous solutions.\n\n1. Particular solution:\n\nYp(ω) = A * (δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3))\n\nSubstitute Yp(ω) into the differential equation:\n\nd²(A * (δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3)))/dω² + 4(A * (δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3))) = 10 * (δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3))\n\nSince the second derivative of the Dirac delta function is not well-defined, we only consider the second term:\n\n4(A * (δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3))) = 10 * (δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3))\n\nComparing the coefficients of the Dirac delta functions, we find that A = 10/4 = 5/2. So, the particular solution is:\n\nYp(ω) = (5/2) * (δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3))\n\n2. Homogeneous solution:\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n\nd²Yh(ω)/dω² + 4Yh(ω) = 0\n\nThis is a simple harmonic oscillator equation, and its general solution is:\n\nYh(ω) = B * cos(2ω) + C * sin(2ω)\n\nNow, we need to apply the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0. To do this, we first take the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) = Yp(ω) + Yh(ω):\n\ny(x) = (1/2π) * ∫[((5/2) * (δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3))) + B * cos(2ω) + C * sin(2ω)] * e^(iωx) dω\n\nApplying the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 1:\n\n(1/2π) * ∫[((5/2) * (δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3))) + B * cos(2ω) + C * sin(2ω)] * e^(iω*0) dω = 1\n\n(1/2π) * ∫[((5/2) * (δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3))) + B * cos(2ω)] dω = 1\n\nUsing the properties of the Dirac delta function, we get:\n\n(5/2) * (1/2π) * ∫(δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3)) dω + (1/2π) * ∫[B * cos(2ω)] dω = 1\n\n(5/2) * (1 - (-1)) + 0 = 1\n\nB = -1\n\ny'(0) = 0:\n\n(1/2π) * ∫[((5/2) * (δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3))) - cos(2ω) + C * sin(2ω)] * iω * e^(iω*0) dω = 0\n\n(1/2π) * ∫[C * iω * sin(2ω)] dω = 0\n\nSince the integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero, we get:\n\nC = 0\n\nNow we have the complete solution in the frequency domain:\n\nY(ω) = (5/2) * (δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3)) - cos(2ω)\n\nTaking the inverse Fourier transform:\n\ny(x) = (1/2π) * ∫[((5/2) * (δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3)) - cos(2ω)) * e^(iωx) dω\n\ny(x) = (5/2) * (sin(3x)/3) - (1/2π) * ∫[cos(2ω) * e^(iωx) dω]\n\nThe last integral can be solved using integration by parts or using tables of Fourier transforms, and we get:\n\ny(x) = (5/2) * (sin(3x)/3) - (1/4) * cos(2x)\n\nSo, the solution to the given differential equation with the initial conditions is:\n\ny(x) = (5/6) * sin(3x) - (1/4) * cos(2x) + 1"
