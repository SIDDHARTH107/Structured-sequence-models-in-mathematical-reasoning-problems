    "message_2": "To determine the analytic continuation of the function f(z) = √(z-1) around the point z=1/4, we first need to find a suitable representation of the function that allows us to analyze its behavior around the point z=1. One common approach is to use the polar representation of the complex numbers.\n\nLet z = r * e^(iθ), where r is the distance from the origin and θ is the angle with the positive real axis. Then, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(z) = √(r * e^(iθ) - 1)\n\nNow, let's consider a path that encircles the point z=1 in the counterclockwise direction. We can parameterize this path as:\n\nz(t) = 1 + R * e^(it), 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π\n\nwhere R is a small positive real number. As we move along this path, the angle θ changes from 0 to 2π. We can rewrite the function f(z) in terms of this path:\n\nf(z(t)) = √(R * e^(it))\n\nNow, let's find the analytic continuation of f(z) along this path. As we move along the path, the angle θ changes continuously. When we complete one full counterclockwise loop around z=1, the angle θ will have increased by 2π. Therefore, the function f(z) will have the following behavior:\n\nf(z(0)) = √(R * e^(i0)) = √(R)\nf(z(2π)) = √(R * e^(i2π)) = √(R * e^(i4π)) = -√(R)\n\nNotice that f(z(0)) ≠ f(z(2π)). This means that the function f(z) = √(z-1) does not have an analytic continuation along the path that encircles the point z=1 in the counterclockwise direction. The function has a branch point at z=1, and the branch cut can be chosen along the positive real axis."
