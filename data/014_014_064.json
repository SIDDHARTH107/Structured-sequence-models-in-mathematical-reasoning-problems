    "message_2": "To encode the message \"MATH IS FUN\" using the Playfair cipher with the keyword \"CRYPTO\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the keyword \"CRYPTO\":\n   C R Y P T\n   O A B D E\n   F G H I K\n   L M N S U\n   V W X Z Q\n\n2. Split the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them. If the message has an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end:\n   MA TH IS FU NX\n\n3. Encode each digraph using the Playfair matrix:\n   - For MA: M is in row 4 and column 2, A is in row 2 and column 2. They share the same column, so replace each letter with the one below it (wrap around if necessary). The encoded digraph is LN.\n   - For TH: T is in row 1 and column 5, H is in row 3 and column 3. They don't share a row or column, so form a rectangle with these letters and replace them with the letters on the same row but at the opposite corners. The encoded digraph is YD.\n   - For IS: I is in row 3 and column 4, S is in row 4 and column 3. They don't share a row or column, so form a rectangle and replace them with the letters on the same row but at the opposite corners. The encoded digraph is KN.\n   - For FU: F is in row 3 and column 1, U is in row 4 and column 5. They don't share a row or column, so form a rectangle and replace them with the letters on the same row but at the opposite corners. The encoded digraph is LV.\n   - For NX: N is in row 4 and column 3, X is in row 5 and column 3. They share the same column, so replace each letter with the one below it (wrap around if necessary). The encoded digraph is SV.\n\n4. Combine the encoded digraphs to get the encoded message:\n   LN YD KN LV SV\n\nSo, the encoded message using the Playfair cipher with the keyword \"CRYPTO\" is \"LNYDKNLVSV\"."
