    "message_2": "To find the nature of the singularity at $z=0$, we will first find the limit of the function as $z$ approaches $0$. \n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{e^{z^2}-1}{\\sin z}$$\n\nWe can use L'Hopital's rule since both the numerator and denominator go to $0$ as $z$ approaches $0$. Taking the derivative of both the numerator and the denominator with respect to $z$, we get:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{d}{dz}(e^{z^2}-1) \\Big/ \\frac{d}{dz}(\\sin z) = \\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{2ze^{z^2}}{\\cos z}$$\n\nNow, we can see that the limit still goes to $0/1$ as $z$ approaches $0$. So, we can apply L'Hopital's rule again:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{d}{dz}(2ze^{z^2}) \\Big/ \\frac{d}{dz}(\\cos z) = \\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{2e^{z^2} + 4z^2e^{z^2}}{-\\sin z}$$\n\nNow, we can see that the limit goes to $2/0$ as $z$ approaches $0$. Since the limit does not exist, we have a singularity at $z=0$. To determine the nature of the singularity, we can look at the order of the pole.\n\nThe order of the pole is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that the limit\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} (z-0)^k f(z)$$\n\nexists and is nonzero. In this case, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} z^k \\frac{e^{z^2}-1}{\\sin z}$$\n\nFor $k=1$, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} z \\frac{e^{z^2}-1}{\\sin z} = \\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{e^{z^2}-1}{\\sin z \\Big/ z}$$\n\nUsing the fact that $\\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin z}{z} = 1$, we get:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{e^{z^2}-1}{1} = e^{0^2} - 1 = 0$$\n\nSince the limit is zero for $k=1$, we need to try higher values of $k$. For $k=2$, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} z^2 \\frac{e^{z^2}-1}{\\sin z} = \\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{e^{z^2}-1}{\\sin z \\Big/ z^2}$$\n\nUsing the fact that $\\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin z}{z} = 1$, we get:\n\n$$\\lim_{z \\to 0} \\frac{e^{z^2}-1}{1} = e^{0^2} - 1 = 0$$\n\nSince the limit is still zero for $k=2$, we need to try higher values of $k$. However, we can notice that for any positive integer $k$, the limit will still be zero due to the presence of $e^{z^2}-1$ in the numerator. Therefore, there is no smallest positive integer $k$ for which the limit exists and is nonzero.\n\nSince there is no smallest positive integer $k$ for which the limit exists and is nonzero, the singularity at $z=0$ is an essential singularity."
