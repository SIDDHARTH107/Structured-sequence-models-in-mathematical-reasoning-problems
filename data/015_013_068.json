    "message_2": "When r is set to 4, the logistic equation becomes chaotic. This means that the values of x_n will not converge to a fixed point or a periodic cycle, but instead will exhibit seemingly random behavior. Let's calculate the first few values of x_n to see this.\n\nGiven x_0 = 0.5 and r = 4, we can calculate x_n for n = 1, 2, ..., 10:\n\nx_1 = 4 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) = 1\nx_2 = 4 * 1 * (1 - 1) = 0\nx_3 = 4 * 0 * (1 - 0) = 0\nx_4 = 4 * 0 * (1 - 0) = 0\n...\nx_n = 0 for all n > 2\n\nIn this specific case, the sequence converges to 0 after the first few iterations. However, if we choose a slightly different initial value for x_0, the sequence will exhibit chaotic behavior. For example, if x_0 = 0.5001:\n\nx_1 ≈ 0.9996\nx_2 ≈ 0.0016\nx_3 ≈ 0.0064\nx_4 ≈ 0.0254\n...\n\nThe values of x_n will continue to fluctuate and not settle into a fixed point or periodic cycle. This is the hallmark of chaotic behavior in the logistic equation when r = 4."
