    "message_2": "For a first-order reaction, the concentration of the reactant at any time can be calculated using the integrated rate law:\n\n[A]t = [A]0 * e^(-kt)\n\nwhere [A]t is the concentration of the reactant at time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration of the reactant, k is the rate constant, and t is the time.\n\nGiven the initial concentration [A]0 = 1.5 mol/L, the rate constant k = 0.02 min^-1, and the time t = 20 minutes, we can calculate the concentration of the reactant after 20 minutes:\n\n[A]t = 1.5 * e^(-0.02 * 20)\n\n[A]t = 1.5 * e^(-0.4)\n\n[A]t ≈ 1.5 * 0.6703\n\n[A]t ≈ 1.005 mol/L\n\nSo, the concentration of the reactant after 20 minutes will be approximately 1.005 mol/L."
