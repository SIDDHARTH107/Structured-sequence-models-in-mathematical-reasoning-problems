Let $b_1$ denote the first Betti number of $M$ and assume that $b_1>0$.\n\nProblem: Compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(HF^\\pm(M,\\omega))$ of the Floer homology groups $HF^\\pm(M,\\omega)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(HF^\\pm(M,\\omega))$, we first need to recall the definition of the Floer homology groups $HF^+(M,\\omega)$ and $HF^-(M,\\omega)$. These are homology groups associated to a chain complex generated by the periodic orbits of the Reeb vector field $R_\\omega$ associated with the contact form $\\omega$. The differential in the Floer complex counts certain pseudo-holomorphic curves in the symplectization of $(M,\\omega)$.\n\nNow, let's compute the Euler characteristic. Recall that the Euler characteristic of a chain complex is given by the alternating sum of the ranks of its homology groups:\n\n$$\\chi(HF^\\pm(M,\\omega)) = \\sum_{k=0}^{b_1} (-1)^k \\mathrm{rank}(HF_k^\\pm(M,\\omega)).$$\n\nBy the Poincaré duality, we have\n\n$$\\mathrm{rank}(HF_k^\\pm(M,\\omega)) = \\mathrm{rank}(HF_{b_1-k}^\\pm(M,\\omega)).$$\n\nThus, the Euler characteristic can be written as\n\n$$\\chi(HF^\\pm(M,\\omega)) = \\sum_{k=0}^{b_1} (-1)^k \\mathrm{rank}(HF_k^\\pm(M,\\omega)) = \\sum_{k=0}^{b_1} (-1)^k \\mathrm{rank}(HF_{b_1-k}^\\pm(M,\\omega)).$$\n\nNow, we can pair up the terms in the sum according to their Poincaré duals:\n\n$$\\chi(HF^\\pm(M,\\omega)) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor b_1/2 \\rfloor} (-1)^k \\left(\\mathrm{rank}(HF_k^\\pm(M,\\omega)) + \\mathrm{rank}(HF_{b_1-k}^\\pm(M,\\omega))\\right).$$\n\nSince the summand is non-negative for all $k$, it follows that\n\n$$\\chi(HF^\\pm(M,\\omega)) \\geq 0.$$\n\nFurthermore, by the non-degeneracy of $\\omega$, we know that the Floer homology groups $HF^+(M,\\omega)$ and $HF^-(M,\\omega)$ are isomorphic to the singular homology groups $H_*(M;\\mathbb{Z})$. In particular, we have\n\n$$\\mathrm{rank}(HF_k^\\pm(M,\\omega)) = \\mathrm{rank}(H_k(M;\\mathbb{Z})).$$\n\nNow, recall that the Euler characteristic of a closed orientable surface $M$ of genus $g$ is given by\n\n$$\\chi(M) = 2 - 2g.$$\n\nSince $b_1 = 2g$, we have\n\n$$\\chi(HF^\\pm(M,\\omega)) = \\chi(M) = 2 - 2g.$$"
