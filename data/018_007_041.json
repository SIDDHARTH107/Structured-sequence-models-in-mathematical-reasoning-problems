    "message_2": "To find the cardinality of the power set P(A), we can use the formula |P(A)| = 2^|A|, where |A| is the cardinality of set A.\n\nSince |A| = 3, we can substitute this value into the formula:\n\n|P(A)| = 2^3 = 8\n\nSo, the cardinality of the power set P(A) is 8.\n\nNow, we need to prove that |P(A)| > |A|. We already know that |A| = 3 and |P(A)| = 8. Comparing these two values, we can see that 8 > 3, which means |P(A)| > |A|. This proves that the cardinality of the power set P(A) is greater than the cardinality of set A."
