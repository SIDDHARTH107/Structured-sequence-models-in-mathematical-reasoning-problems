    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 10 cm and the length of its two parallel sides are 15 cm and 20 cm respectively. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × height × (sum of the lengths of the parallel sides)\n\nIn this case, the height is 10 cm, and the lengths of the parallel sides are 15 cm and 20 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) × 10 × (15 + 20)\nArea = (1/2) × 10 × 35\nArea = 5 × 35\nArea = 175\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 175 square centimeters."
