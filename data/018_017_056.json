    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A x B and B, and B Δ B.\n\nRecall that the symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nB Δ B = {x : x ∈ B and x ∉ B} or {x : x ∉ B and x ∈ B} = ∅ (the empty set)\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B.\n\nA x B = {(a, b) : a ∈ A and b ∈ B} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A x B) Δ B and A x (B Δ B).\n\n(A x B) Δ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)} Δ {2, 3} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2)} (since (2, 3) is the only element in the intersection)\n\nA x (B Δ B) = A x ∅ = ∅ (since the Cartesian product with the empty set is always the empty set)\n\nNow, we can see that (A x B) Δ B ≠ A x (B Δ B) because {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2)} ≠ ∅.\n\nThis shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference, as we have found a counterexample where the equality does not hold."
