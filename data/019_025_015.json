    "message_2": "A researcher is studying the relationship between the number of hours spent studying and the final exam scores of students. They have collected data from 50 students and found that there is a positive correlation between the two variables. The researcher wants to use causal logic to determine if the number of hours spent studying has a direct impact on the final exam scores.\n\nThe researcher decides to use a linear regression model to analyze the data. The model is given by:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nwhere y represents the final exam score, x represents the number of hours spent studying, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.\n\nThe researcher finds that the best-fit line for the data has a slope of 2.5 and a y-intercept of 65.\n\n1. What is the equation of the best-fit line?\n2. If a student spends 10 hours studying, what is their predicted final exam score?\n3. Can the researcher conclude that the number of hours spent studying directly causes an increase in the final exam score? Why or why not?"
