    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one of those triangles, then multiply by the number of triangles.\n\nAn equilateral triangle has all sides equal, so the side length of the triangle is also 8 cm. To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (side² * √3) / 4\n\nArea of one equilateral triangle = (8² * √3) / 4\nArea of one equilateral triangle = (64 * √3) / 4\nArea of one equilateral triangle = 16√3 cm²\n\nSince there are 6 equilateral triangles in a hexagon, we can find the total area by multiplying the area of one triangle by 6:\n\nArea of hexagon = 6 * (16√3 cm²)\nArea of hexagon = 96√3 cm²"
