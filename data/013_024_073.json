    "message_1": "A group of 5 volunteers are participating in a charity event. Each one of them has to donate some money for the charity cause. They will earn 10 points if everyone donates, but if someone decides not to donate, he will get 15 points while everyone else will get 0. If two or more volunteers decide not to donate, the charity event will be cancelled and everyone will lose one point. What would be the best decision for each volunteer to maximize their points?",
    "message_2": "The best decision for each volunteer to maximize their points would be for all of them to donate. In this scenario, each volunteer would earn 10 points, resulting in a total of 50 points for the group.\n\nIf one volunteer decides not to donate, that person would get 15 points, but the other four would get 0 points, resulting in a total of 15 points for the group.\n\nIf two or more volunteers decide not to donate, the charity event will be cancelled, and everyone will lose one point, resulting in a total of -5 points for the group.\n\nTherefore, the best decision for each volunteer to maximize their points is for all of them to donate and earn 10 points each."
