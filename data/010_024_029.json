    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the angle sum of a triangle is always less than 180 degrees. Given the angles of 60 degrees and 70 degrees, we can find the value of x by considering that the sum of the angles is less than 180 degrees:\n\n60 + 70 + x < 180\n\n130 + x < 180\n\nx < 50\n\nSo, the value of x must be less than 50 degrees. Since all angles are less than 90 degrees, the hyperbolic triangle is acute."
