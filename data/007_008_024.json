    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, we have:\n\na^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)\n\nIn this case, n = 7, which is a prime number, and a = 3, which is not divisible by 7. So we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n3^(7-1) ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\n3^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when 3^n (3^7) is divided by 7. We can rewrite 3^7 as 3^6 * 3:\n\n3^7 = 3^6 * 3\n\nSince we know that 3^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n3^7 ≡ 1 * 3 (mod 7)\n\n3^7 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nSo the remainder when 3^7 is divided by 7 is 3."
