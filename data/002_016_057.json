    "message_1": "What is the length of each side of an equilateral triangle if its perimeter is 24 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of each side of an equilateral triangle, you can divide the perimeter by the number of sides. In this case, the perimeter is 24 cm, and there are 3 sides in an equilateral triangle.\n\nLength of each side = Perimeter / Number of sides\nLength of each side = 24 cm / 3\nLength of each side = 8 cm\n\nSo, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 8 cm."
