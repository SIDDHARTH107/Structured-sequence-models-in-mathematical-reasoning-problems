Here are the results:\n4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 18, 21, 25, 36\n\nCalculate the median and interquartile range of the data set using the method of robust statistics.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the median and interquartile range of the data set, we first need to organize the data in ascending order, which is already done in this case.\n\nThe data set has 10 values, so the median will be the average of the 5th and 6th values.\n\nMedian = (12 + 15) / 2 = 27 / 2 = 13.5\n\nNow, let's find the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n\nTo find Q1, we need to find the median of the lower half of the data set (excluding the overall median if there's an odd number of data points). In this case, the lower half is:\n\n4, 6, 7, 8, 12\n\nSince there are 5 values, the first quartile (Q1) is the middle value, which is 7.\n\nTo find Q3, we need to find the median of the upper half of the data set (excluding the overall median if there's an odd number of data points). In this case, the upper half is:\n\n15, 18, 21, 25, 36\n\nSince there are 5 values, the third quartile (Q3) is the middle value, which is 21.\n\nNow, we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 21 - 7 = 14\n\nSo, the median of the data set is 13.5, and the interquartile range is 14."
