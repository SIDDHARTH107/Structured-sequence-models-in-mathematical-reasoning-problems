    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products A and B, which require two types of raw materials X and Y. The cost per unit of X is $5 and Y is $3. Product A requires 2 units of X and 1 unit of Y while product B requires 1 unit of X and 2 units of Y. The selling price of product A is $10 and B is $8. The company wants to maximize its profit. What is the optimal production quantity for products A and B?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production quantity for products A and B, we need to calculate the profit for each product and then determine the production quantities that maximize the total profit.\n\nLet's denote the production quantity of product A as x and product B as y.\n\nProfit for product A:\nRevenue: $10 per unit\nCost: 2 units of X ($5 each) + 1 unit of Y ($3 each) = $13\nProfit per unit of A: $10 - $13 = -$3\n\nProfit for product B:\nRevenue: $8 per unit\nCost: 1 unit of X ($5 each) + 2 units of Y ($3 each) = $11\nProfit per unit of B: $8 - $11 = -$3\n\nSince both products have a negative profit per unit, the company should not produce either product A or B to maximize its profit. The optimal production quantity for both products A and B is 0."
