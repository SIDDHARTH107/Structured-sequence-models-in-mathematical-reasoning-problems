    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem related to Mechanism Design in Game Theory:\n\n\"Suppose there are 3 bidders participating in an auction for a painting. The bidders have private valuations for the painting, distributed as follows: bidder 1 has a value of 100, bidder 2 has a value of 80, and bidder 3 has a value of 70. Design a mechanism that maximizes the seller's revenue, assuming the bidders are truthful about their valuations.\" \n\nThe math student can use their knowledge in Mechanism Design to come up with a strategy for the seller to elicit truthful valuations from the bidders and maximize their revenue in this auction.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the seller's revenue, we can use a second-price sealed-bid auction, also known as a Vickrey auction. In this auction, each bidder submits a sealed bid, and the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid price. This mechanism encourages bidders to be truthful about their valuations because they know they will only pay the second-highest price if they win.\n\nIn this case, the bidders have private valuations of 100, 80, and 70. They will submit sealed bids according to their valuations:\n\n- Bidder 1: 100\n- Bidder 2: 80\n- Bidder 3: 70\n\nBidder 1 has the highest bid and wins the auction. However, they will pay the second-highest bid price, which is 80. This mechanism maximizes the seller's revenue while ensuring that bidders are truthful about their valuations. The seller's revenue in this auction is 80."
