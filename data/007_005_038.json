    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 24, 30, and 36, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n30 = 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1\n36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n\n2. Identify the highest power of each prime factor in the given numbers:\n2^3, 3^2, and 5^1\n\n3. Multiply the highest powers of each prime factor together:\nLCM = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^1 = 8 * 9 * 5 = 72 * 5 = 360\n\nThe least common multiple of 24, 30, and 36 is 360."
