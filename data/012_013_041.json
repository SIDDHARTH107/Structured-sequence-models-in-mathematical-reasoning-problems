    "message_2": "A graph with 7 vertices, where each vertex is connected to every other vertex, is called a complete graph and is denoted by K_7. The chromatic polynomial of a graph counts the number of proper colorings of the graph using k colors.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of a complete graph K_n can be computed using the formula:\n\nP(K_n, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1)\n\nIn our case, n = 7, so the chromatic polynomial of K_7 is:\n\nP(K_7, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-4)(k-5)(k-6)\n\nThis is the chromatic polynomial of the complete graph with 7 vertices."
