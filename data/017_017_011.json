Let f: V â†’ G be the isomorphism between V and G.\n\nSince V has order 4, G must also have order 4, as isomorphisms preserve the order of groups. However, we are given that G has order 30, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there cannot exist a group of order 30 which is isomorphic to the Klein four-group."
