    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A x B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find (A x B) ∩ B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\n(A x B) ∩ B = {} (empty set, since there are no common elements)\n\nNext, let's find A ∩ B. The intersection of sets A and B is the set of elements that are common to both A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = {2}\n\nNow, let's find (A ∩ B) x B. We already found that A ∩ B = {2}, so we just need to find the Cartesian product of {2} and B.\n\n(A ∩ B) x B = {(2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare the results of (A x B) ∩ B and ((A ∩ B) x B):\n\n(A x B) ∩ B = {}\n((A ∩ B) x B) = {(2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nSince the results are different, this proves that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
