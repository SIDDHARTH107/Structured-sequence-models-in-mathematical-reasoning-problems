    "message_1": "In a school, there are 300 students in total. Out of them, 60 students are in the honors program. If a student is chosen at random, what is the probability that the selected student is in the honors program?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting a student in the honors program, we need to divide the number of students in the honors program by the total number of students in the school.\n\nNumber of students in the honors program = 60\nTotal number of students in the school = 300\n\nProbability of selecting a student in the honors program = (Number of students in the honors program) / (Total number of students in the school)\n\nProbability = 60 / 300\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 60.\n\nProbability = (60/60) / (300/60) = 1 / 5\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a student in the honors program is 1/5 or 0.2 (20%)."
