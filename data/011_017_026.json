    "message_2": "To find the total number of distinct 4x4 Latin squares, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. The first row can be filled in 4! (4 factorial) ways, as there are 4 numbers and each can be placed in any of the 4 positions. So, there are 4! = 24 ways to fill the first row.\n\n2. For the second row, there are 3 possible numbers for the first position (since it cannot be the same as the number above it), 2 possible numbers for the second position (since it cannot be the same as the number above it or the one to its left), and only 1 possible number for the third position (since it cannot be the same as the number above it or the ones to its left). The fourth position is determined by the remaining number. So, there are 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to fill the second row.\n\n3. For the third row, there are 2 possible numbers for the first position (since it cannot be the same as the number above it), and 2 possible numbers for the second position (since it cannot be the same as the number above it or the one to its left). The third and fourth positions are determined by the remaining numbers. So, there are 2 × 2 = 4 ways to fill the third row.\n\n4. The fourth row is determined by the remaining numbers in each column, so there is only 1 way to fill the fourth row.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways to fill each row to find the total number of distinct 4x4 Latin squares:\n\n24 (first row) × 6 (second row) × 4 (third row) × 1 (fourth row) = 576\n\nSo, there are 576 distinct 4x4 Latin squares possible."
