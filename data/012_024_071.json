    "message_2": "To determine the genus of a graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and its generalization for graphs embedded on surfaces of higher genus. The Euler's formula states that for a connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2,\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, for a graph embedded on a surface of genus g, the formula becomes:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g.\n\nWe are given a graph with 12 vertices (V = 12) and 20 edges (E = 20). We want to find the genus g of the graph. To do this, we first need to find the number of faces F.\n\nSince we don't have information about the specific graph, we can use the inequality for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n20 ≤ 3 * 12 - 6,\n20 ≤ 30.\n\nSince 20 is less than or equal to 30, it is possible that the graph is planar (genus 0). However, we need to check if the graph can be drawn without any edge crossings on a surface of genus 0.\n\nIf the graph cannot be drawn without edge crossings on a planar surface, we can try to find the smallest genus g for which the graph can be embedded without edge crossings. For a graph embedded on a surface of genus g, the inequality becomes:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6.\n\nWe can start with g = 1 and see if the inequality holds:\n\n20 ≤ 3 * 12 + 6 * 1 - 6,\n20 ≤ 36.\n\nSince 20 is less than or equal to 36, the graph can be embedded on a surface of genus 1 (a torus) without edge crossings. However, since the graph also satisfies the inequality for a planar surface, we can conclude that the genus of the graph is 0 (planar)."
