    "message_1": "A carnival game involves spinning a wheel divided into equal sections, each labeled with a number. The player wins a prize if the wheel lands on an even number. If the numbers 1 through 6 are equally likely to come up, what is the probability of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "There are 6 equally likely outcomes on the wheel: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Out of these, 3 are even numbers: 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, the probability of winning the game is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (even numbers) to the total number of outcomes:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes) = 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%."
