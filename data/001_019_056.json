    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |2x - 7| = 12, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 7 = 12\nSolving for x, we get:\n2x = 12 + 7\n2x = 19\nx = 19/2\n\nCase 2: 2x - 7 = -12\nSolving for x, we get:\n2x = -12 + 7\n2x = -5\nx = -5/2\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation |2x - 7| = 12 are x = 19/2 and x = -5/2."
