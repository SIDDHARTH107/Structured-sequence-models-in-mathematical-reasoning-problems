    "message_2": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"LDGYNYFGJCZIUYKD\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\", we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: MATHS\n2. Complete the matrix with the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, as I and J are treated as the same letter in the Playfair cipher):\n\n   M A T H S\n   B C D E F\n   G I K L N\n   O P Q R U\n   V W X Y Z\n\nNow, we will decrypt the ciphertext by pairing the letters and applying the Playfair rules:\n\n1. LD -> PL\n2. GY -> AY\n3. NY -> FA\n4. FG -> IR\n5. JC -> ME\n6. ZI -> SS\n7. UY -> AG\n8. KD -> E\n\nSo, the plaintext message is \"PLAYFAIRMESSAGE\"."
