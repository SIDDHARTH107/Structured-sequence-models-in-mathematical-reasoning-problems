    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point $(2, 3)$, we first need to find the value of the parameter $t$ that corresponds to this point. Since the $x$-coordinate is given by $t^2 + 1$, we can set up the equation:\n\n$2 = t^2 + 1$\n\nSolving for $t$, we get:\n\n$t^2 = 1$\n\n$t = \\pm 1$\n\nNow, we need to check which value of $t$ gives the correct $y$-coordinate. The $y$-coordinate is given by $t^3 + t$. Plugging in $t = 1$, we get:\n\n$y = 1^3 + 1 = 2$\n\nThis does not match the given point $(2, 3)$. Now, plugging in $t = -1$, we get:\n\n$y = (-1)^3 + (-1) = -2$\n\nThis also does not match the given point $(2, 3)$. Therefore, there is no point on the curve with the parametrization $(t^2 + 1, t^3 + t)$ that corresponds to the point $(2, 3)$. Consequently, it is not possible to find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point $(2, 3)$."
