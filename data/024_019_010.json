    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a compact surface with boundary:\n\n∫∫_S K dA + ∮_∂S k_g ds = 2πχ\n\nwhere K is the Gaussian curvature, k_g is the geodesic curvature of the boundary, dA is the area element, ds is the arc length element along the boundary, and χ is the Euler characteristic.\n\nGiven that the Gaussian curvature K is constant and equal to 2π, and the Euler characteristic χ is 2, we can rewrite the Gauss-Bonnet theorem as:\n\n(2π) * ∫∫_S dA + ∮_∂S k_g ds = 2π * 2\n\nLet A be the total area of the surface S. Then, the left side of the equation becomes:\n\n(2π) * A + ∮_∂S k_g ds = 4π\n\nNow, we need to find the total geodesic curvature of the boundary of the surface, which is given by:\n\n∮_∂S k_g ds\n\nTo do this, we can rearrange the equation to isolate the term we want to find:\n\n∮_∂S k_g ds = 4π - (2π) * A\n\nSince we don't have information about the area A, we cannot find the exact value of the total geodesic curvature of the boundary. However, we have established a relationship between the area and the total geodesic curvature:\n\nTotal geodesic curvature of the boundary = 4π - (2π) * A"
