    "message_1": "In a regression analysis of the relationship between height (in inches) and weight (in pounds) for a sample of 20 individuals, the following regression equation was obtained: \nweight = 120 + 5.6 * height. \n\nIf a person is 68 inches tall, what is the predicted weight for that individual according to this regression equation?",
    "message_2": "To find the predicted weight for a person who is 68 inches tall, we can plug the height value into the regression equation:\n\nweight = 120 + 5.6 * height\n\nSubstitute the height value (68 inches) into the equation:\n\nweight = 120 + 5.6 * 68\n\nNow, multiply 5.6 by 68:\n\nweight = 120 + 380.8\n\nFinally, add 120 to 380.8:\n\nweight = 500.8\n\nAccording to this regression equation, the predicted weight for a person who is 68 inches tall is 500.8 pounds."
