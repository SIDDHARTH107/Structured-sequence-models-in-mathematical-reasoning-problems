    "message_1": "Assume that there are four volunteers who have agreed to install a new security system in their neighborhood. Each volunteer is considering whether they should install the security system themselves, or make a $200 contribution to a pool fund, which is currently worth $600, to hire a professional installer. If at least three volunteers make the contribution, the fund will be used to hire the professional installer. What should each volunteer do to maximize their benefit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their benefit, we need to consider the two possible scenarios:\n\n1. If three or more volunteers contribute $200 each to the pool fund:\nIn this case, the total fund will be at least $600 + $200*3 = $1200. This will be enough to hire a professional installer, and all four volunteers will have the security system installed professionally. The cost for each volunteer who contributed will be $200.\n\n2. If fewer than three volunteers contribute to the pool fund:\nIn this case, the fund will not be used to hire a professional installer, and each volunteer will have to install the security system themselves. The cost for each volunteer in this scenario depends on their individual skills and resources, but it is likely to be higher than the $200 contribution, as they will have to spend time and effort on the installation.\n\nTo maximize their benefit, each volunteer should consider the following:\n\n- If they believe that at least two other volunteers will contribute to the pool fund, they should also contribute $200. This way, they ensure that the professional installer is hired, and they only pay $200 for the installation.\n- If they believe that fewer than two other volunteers will contribute, they should install the security system themselves. In this case, contributing to the fund would not result in hiring a professional installer, and they would still have to install the system themselves.\n\nHowever, if all volunteers think strategically and expect others to contribute, they might all decide to contribute to the pool fund, ensuring that the professional installer is hired and maximizing the benefit for everyone. In conclusion, the best course of action for each volunteer is to contribute $200 to the pool fund if they believe that at least two other volunteers will also contribute."
