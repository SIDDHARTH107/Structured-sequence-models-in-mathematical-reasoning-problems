    "message_2": "To determine the cut vertices and bridges in the given graph, we will first define what they are:\n\n1. Cut vertices: A vertex in a connected graph is called a cut vertex if its removal (along with its incident edges) increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\n2. Bridges: An edge in a connected graph is called a bridge if its removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given graph:\n\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nEdges: {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9)}\n\nCut vertices:\n- Removing vertex 2 disconnects vertices 1 and 5 from the rest of the graph, so vertex 2 is a cut vertex.\n- Removing vertex 3 disconnects vertices 1 and 6 from the rest of the graph, so vertex 3 is a cut vertex.\n- Removing vertex 4 disconnects vertices 1 and 5 from the rest of the graph, so vertex 4 is a cut vertex.\n- Removing vertex 6 disconnects vertices 8 and 9 from the rest of the graph, so vertex 6 is a cut vertex.\n\nTherefore, the cut vertices are {2, 3, 4, 6}.\n\nBridges:\n- Removing edge (2, 5) disconnects vertex 5 from the rest of the graph, so edge (2, 5) is a bridge.\n- Removing edge (3, 6) disconnects vertices 8 and 9 from the rest of the graph, so edge (3, 6) is a bridge.\n\nTherefore, the bridges are {(2, 5), (3, 6)}."
