    "message_1": "A town has a population of 10,000 people. An infectious disease has broken out in the town and is spreading rapidly. The rate of spread is given by the differential equation: \n\ndI/dt = 0.0001*I*(10000-I)\n\nwhere I is the number of infected people and t is time in days. \n\nSuppose that initially there are 100 infected people in the town. How many days will it take for there to be 5000 infected people?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the given differential equation and then find the time it takes for the number of infected people to reach 5000.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the differential equation as:\n\ndI/dt = 0.0001*I*(10000-I)\n\nNow, we can separate the variables:\n\n(1/(I*(10000-I))) dI = 0.0001 dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/(I*(10000-I))) dI = ∫0.0001 dt\n\nTo solve the integral on the left side, we can use partial fraction decomposition:\n\n1/(I*(10000-I)) = A/I + B/(10000-I)\n\nMultiplying both sides by I*(10000-I), we get:\n\n1 = A*(10000-I) + B*I\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B:\n\nFor I = 0, A = 1/10000, so A = 0.0001\nFor I = 10000, B = -1/10000, so B = -0.0001\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral:\n\n∫(0.0001/I - 0.0001/(10000-I)) dI = ∫0.0001 dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n0.0001*ln(|I/(10000-I)|) = 0.0001*t + C\n\nNow, we need to find the constant C using the initial condition I(0) = 100:\n\n0.0001*ln(100/9900) = C\n\nC ≈ -0.4605\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n0.0001*ln(|I/(10000-I)|) = 0.0001*t - 0.4605\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for I to reach 5000:\n\n0.0001*ln(5000/5000) = 0.0001*t - 0.4605\n\n0 = 0.0001*t - 0.4605\n\nt = 0.4605/0.0001\n\nt ≈ 4605\n\nSo, it will take approximately 4605 days for there to be 5000 infected people in the town."
