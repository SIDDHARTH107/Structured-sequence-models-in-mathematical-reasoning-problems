    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set C is a subset of sets A and B, we need to show that every element in set C is also an element in sets A and B. \n\nRecall the definition of a subset: A set D is a subset of a set E (denoted as D ⊆ E) if every element of D is also an element of E.\n\nSince set C is the empty set, it contains no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in set C that are not in sets A and B. By definition, this means that the empty set C is a subset of both sets A and B.\n\nIn set notation, we can write this as:\n\nC ⊆ A\nC ⊆ B\n\nSince the empty set is a subset of both sets A and B, it is also a subset of any other set, including itself. Therefore, the empty set is a subset of all three sets A, B, and C."
