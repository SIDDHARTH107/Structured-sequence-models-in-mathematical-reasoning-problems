The painting has an estimated value of $10,000. There are two potential buyers: Alice and Bob. Each buyer has a private valuation of the painting, which is uniformly distributed between $0 and $20,000. The auction will be a sealed-bid, second-price (Vickrey) auction, where the highest bidder wins the painting and pays the second-highest bid. \n\nWhat is the expected revenue of the auction? \n\nHint: You may need to use integration to compute the expected value of the second-highest bid.",
    "message_2": "To find the expected revenue of the auction, we need to compute the expected value of the second-highest bid. Let X be Alice's bid and Y be Bob's bid. Since both bids are uniformly distributed between $0 and $20,000, the joint probability density function (pdf) is given by:\n\nf(x, y) = 1 / (20,000 * 20,000) for 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 20,000\n\nNow, let's find the expected value of the second-highest bid, which can be expressed as:\n\nE[min(X, Y)] = ∫∫ min(x, y) * f(x, y) dx dy\n\nWe need to split the integral into two parts, one where x < y and another where y < x:\n\nE[min(X, Y)] = ∫∫ x * f(x, y) dx dy + ∫∫ y * f(x, y) dx dy\n\nFor x < y:\n\n∫∫ x * f(x, y) dx dy = ∫∫ x * (1 / (20,000 * 20,000)) dx dy\n= (1 / (20,000 * 20,000)) * ∫∫ x dx dy\n\nWe integrate x from 0 to y and y from 0 to 20,000:\n\n= (1 / (20,000 * 20,000)) * ∫[0 to 20,000] ( ∫[0 to y] x dx ) dy\n= (1 / (20,000 * 20,000)) * ∫[0 to 20,000] (y^2 / 2) dy\n= (1 / (20,000 * 20,000)) * (1 / 2) * (20,000^3 / 3)\n\nFor y < x:\n\n∫∫ y * f(x, y) dx dy = ∫∫ y * (1 / (20,000 * 20,000)) dx dy\n= (1 / (20,000 * 20,000)) * ∫∫ y dx dy\n\nWe integrate x from y to 20,000 and y from 0 to 20,000:\n\n= (1 / (20,000 * 20,000)) * ∫[0 to 20,000] ( ∫[y to 20,000] y dx ) dy\n= (1 / (20,000 * 20,000)) * ∫[0 to 20,000] (y * (20,000 - y)) dy\n= (1 / (20,000 * 20,000)) * ∫[0 to 20,000] (20,000y - y^2) dy\n= (1 / (20,000 * 20,000)) * ( (20,000^3 / 3) - (20,000^3 / 6) )\n\nNow, we sum the two parts:\n\nE[min(X, Y)] = (1 / (20,000 * 20,000)) * ( (1 / 2) * (20,000^3 / 3) + (20,000^3 / 3) - (20,000^3 / 6) )\n= (1 / (20,000 * 20,000)) * (20,000^3 / 2)\n= 20,000 / 2\n= 10,000\n\nSo, the expected revenue of the auction is $10,000."
