    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve, and its length increases with each order. The length of the Hilbert curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (2^n - 1) * a\n\nwhere \"n\" is the order of the curve and \"a\" is the length of the initial segment.\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 4, we have:\n\nLength = (2^4 - 1) * a = (16 - 1) * a = 15 * a\n\nHowever, without knowing the length of the initial segment \"a\", we cannot determine the total length of the Hilbert curve of order 4. If you provide the length of the initial segment, we can calculate the total length."
