    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that increases in complexity with each order. The perimeter of the curve increases as the order increases. For an n-th order Hilbert curve, the perimeter can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 4^n * (1/2^(n-1))\n\nFor a 5th-order Hilbert curve, we can plug in n=5:\n\nPerimeter = 4^5 * (1/2^(5-1))\nPerimeter = 1024 * (1/16)\nPerimeter = 64\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 5th-order Hilbert curve with the initial square side length of 1 is 64."
