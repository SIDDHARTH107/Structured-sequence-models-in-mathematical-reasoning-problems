    "message_2": "To determine the average speed of the car, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n\nIn this case, the total distance is 150 km and the total time is 2.5 hours. So, the average speed is:\n\nAverage speed = 150 km / 2.5 hours = 60 km/h\n\nNow, we need to find at least one point in time when the car was traveling at exactly the mean speed. We can use the Mean Value Theorem to solve this problem.\n\nThe Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nLet f(t) be the position function of the car, where t is the time in hours. We know that the car travels 150 km in 2.5 hours, so the interval we are considering is [0, 2.5]. The average rate of change of the position function over this interval is the average speed, which we found to be 60 km/h.\n\nSince the position function of a moving object is continuous and differentiable, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem. There exists at least one point c in the interval (0, 2.5) such that:\n\nf'(c) = (f(2.5) - f(0)) / (2.5 - 0)\n\nWe know that f'(c) represents the instantaneous speed of the car at time c, and we want to find a point in time when the car was traveling at exactly the mean speed (60 km/h). So, we can set f'(c) equal to 60 km/h:\n\n60 = (f(2.5) - f(0)) / (2.5 - 0)\n\nSince f(2.5) - f(0) is the total distance traveled (150 km), we can substitute it into the equation:\n\n60 = (150) / (2.5 - 0)\n\nNow, we can see that the equation is true, which means that there exists at least one point c in the interval (0, 2.5) such that the car was traveling at exactly the mean speed of 60 km/h. However, without more information about the position function f(t), we cannot determine the exact value of c."
