    "message_1": "In a class of 20 students, the teacher asks them to rate their enjoyment level of a recent math exam on a scale of 1 to 10. The ratings are as follows: 5, 7, 4, 9, 2, 8, 6, 1, 5, 7, 6, 8, 5, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 5. Calculate the median and mode of the data and determine if the distribution is skewed.",
    "message_2": "First, let's arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9\n\nTo find the median, we need to find the middle value(s) of the data. Since there are 20 students, there are two middle values (10th and 11th values):\n\n1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9\n\nThe 10th and 11th values are both 5, so the median is 5.\n\nTo find the mode, we need to find the value(s) that occur most frequently in the data. In this case, the number 5 occurs the most (5 times), so the mode is 5.\n\nNow, let's determine if the distribution is skewed. A distribution is skewed if it is not symmetric and has a longer tail on one side. In this case, the data appears to be relatively symmetric, with no significant skewness:\n\n1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9\n\nSince the distribution is relatively symmetric, it is not significantly skewed."
