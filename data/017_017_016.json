    "message_2": "To determine whether the group G of order 30 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nRecall that the order of G is 30, which can be factored as 2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exist Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor of the order of G.\n\nLet's consider the Sylow 5-subgroups. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide the index 6 (30/5) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. This means that there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 5-subgroup, say P_5, of order 5 in G.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide the index 10 (30/3) and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possibilities are n_3 = 1 or n_3 = 10. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 3-subgroup, say P_3, of order 3 in G.\n\nNow, if both n_3 = 1 and n_5 = 1, then G has a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique normal Sylow 5-subgroup. In this case, the product of these subgroups, P_3P_5, is a subgroup of G with order 3 * 5 = 15. By the second Sylow theorem, the order of the quotient group G/P_3P_5 is 2, which implies that G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P_3P_5 and the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since P_3P_5 is isomorphic to C3 × C5, which is a cyclic group of order 15, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of C15 and C2. This is precisely the dihedral group D15.\n\nIf n_3 = 10, then there are 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, and we cannot conclude that G is isomorphic to D15. However, we can still use the fact that there is a unique normal Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. Let Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Then, since P_5 is normal in G, the product PQ is a subgroup of G with order 3 * 5 = 15. By the second Sylow theorem, the order of the quotient group G/PQ is 2, which implies that G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of PQ and the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since PQ is isomorphic to C3 × C5, which is a cyclic group of order 15, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of C15 and C2. This is again the dihedral group D15.\n\nIn either case, we have shown that the group G of order 30 is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15."
