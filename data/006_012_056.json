    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, burglaries) occurring in a fixed interval of time (30 days) given a known average rate (5 burglaries per month).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson probability mass function is:\n\nP(X = k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k events occurring in the given time interval\n- λ is the average rate of events (in this case, 5 burglaries per month)\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for (in this case, at least 1 burglary)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 1 burglary occurring in the next 30 days, we can find the probability of no burglaries occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of no burglaries (k = 0) occurring in the next 30 days:\n\nP(X = 0) = (λ^0 * e^(-λ)) / 0!\n          = (5^0 * e^(-5)) / 1\n          = (1 * e^(-5)) / 1\n          = e^(-5)\n          ≈ 0.0067\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 1 burglary occurring:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\n         = 1 - 0.0067\n         ≈ 0.9933\n\nSo, the probability of a burglary occurring in the specific neighborhood within the next 30 days is approximately 0.9933 or 99.33%."
