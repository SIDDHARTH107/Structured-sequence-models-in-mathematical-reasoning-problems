In this case, the function is $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. Let's compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n1. With respect to x:\n   $$\n   \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x \\\\\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2\n   $$\n\n2. With respect to y:\n   $$\n   \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y \\\\\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 2\n   $$\n\n3. With respect to z:\n   $$\n   \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = 2z \\\\\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2} = 2\n   $$\n\nNow, we can find the Laplacian of $f$ by summing these second partial derivatives:\n\n$$\n\\nabla^2 f = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2} = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n$$\n\nSo, the Laplacian of $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ on the sphere of radius 2 is 6."
