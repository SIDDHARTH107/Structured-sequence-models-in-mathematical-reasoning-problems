    "message_1": "A communication system transmits an electrical signal, which can be modeled as a periodic function f(t) with a period of 5 milliseconds. The signal is sampled at a rate of 400 Hz, and the resulting samples are transmitted through a noisy network. Using the Fourier Transform, determine the frequency content of the transmitted signal and find the bandwidth required to transmit this signal without loss.",
    "message_2": "Given that the signal is periodic with a period of 5 milliseconds (T = 5 ms), we can determine its fundamental frequency (F0) using the following formula:\n\nF0 = 1 / T\n\nF0 = 1 / (5 * 10^(-3)) = 200 Hz\n\nNow, we know that the signal is sampled at a rate of 400 Hz. According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, the sampling rate should be at least twice the highest frequency component of the signal to avoid aliasing and to be able to reconstruct the signal without loss.\n\nSampling rate = 2 * highest frequency component\n\nIn this case, the sampling rate is 400 Hz, so the highest frequency component that can be transmitted without loss is:\n\nHighest frequency component = Sampling rate / 2 = 400 / 2 = 200 Hz\n\nSince the fundamental frequency of the signal is 200 Hz, the bandwidth required to transmit this signal without loss is equal to the highest frequency component, which is 200 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the bandwidth required to transmit the signal without loss is 200 Hz."
