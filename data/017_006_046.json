    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 35, we know that |G| = 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers. By the Sylow theorems, we can find the number of 5-Sylow subgroups and 7-Sylow subgroups in G.\n\nLet n_5 be the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G. By Sylow's third theorem, n_5 must divide 7 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Therefore, there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup in G, say P_5, and it is a normal subgroup of G since it is unique.\n\nSimilarly, let n_7 be the number of 7-Sylow subgroups in G. By Sylow's third theorem, n_7 must divide 5 and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7). The only possibility is n_7 = 1. Therefore, there is a unique 7-Sylow subgroup in G, say P_7, and it is a normal subgroup of G since it is unique.\n\nNow, consider the product of the two normal subgroups P_5 and P_7. Since |P_5| = 5 and |P_7| = 7, and 5 and 7 are coprime, we have |P_5 ∩ P_7| = 1. Thus, the intersection of P_5 and P_7 is the identity element of G.\n\nSince P_5 and P_7 are both normal subgroups of G, we can form the internal direct product of P_5 and P_7. Let H = P_5 × P_7. Then, |H| = |P_5| * |P_7| = 5 * 7 = 35, which is equal to the order of G.\n\nSince H is a subgroup of G with the same order as G, we have H = G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, which are P_5 and P_7."
