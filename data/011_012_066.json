    "message_2": "To find out how many students do not like to play either basketball or soccer, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, we add the number of students who like basketball and soccer: 20 + 15 = 35.\nHowever, we have counted the students who like both games twice, so we need to subtract the number of students who like both games: 35 - 10 = 25.\n\nNow we know that 25 students like either basketball or soccer. Since there are 30 students in total, the number of students who do not like either game is: 30 - 25 = 5.\n\nSo, 5 students do not like to play either basketball or soccer."
