    "message_2": "In the set X = {2, 4, 6, 8}, there are two types of numbers: even numbers and multiples of 2.\n\n1. Even numbers: All the numbers in the set X are even numbers because they are divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. The terms of this type are 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n\n2. Multiples of 2: All the numbers in the set X are multiples of 2 because they can be expressed as a product of 2 and another integer. The terms of this type are 2 (2x1), 4 (2x2), 6 (2x3), and 8 (2x4)."
