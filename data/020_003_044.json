For Product A, the fixed cost is $5000 and the variable cost is $10 per unit. For Product B, the fixed cost is $10000 and the variable cost is $8 per unit. The selling price for Product A is $15 per unit, and for Product B is $16.50 per unit. \n\nSuppose the demand for each product is given by: \n\n- Demand for Product A = 1000 - 2 × price of Product A \n- Demand for Product B = 1500 - price of Product B \n\nWhat is the optimal production quantity for each product in order to maximize the total profit of the company?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production quantity for each product, we need to first find the profit function for each product and then find the production quantity that maximizes the profit.\n\nLet x be the production quantity for Product A and y be the production quantity for Product B.\n\nRevenue for Product A = price of Product A × demand for Product A = 15x\nRevenue for Product B = price of Product B × demand for Product B = 16.5y\n\nCost for Product A = fixed cost + variable cost = 5000 + 10x\nCost for Product B = fixed cost + variable cost = 10000 + 8y\n\nProfit for Product A = revenue for Product A - cost for Product A = 15x - (5000 + 10x) = 5x - 5000\nProfit for Product B = revenue for Product B - cost for Product B = 16.5y - (10000 + 8y) = 8.5y - 10000\n\nTotal profit = profit for Product A + profit for Product B = (5x - 5000) + (8.5y - 10000)\n\nNow, we need to find the demand for each product:\n\nDemand for Product A = 1000 - 2 × price of Product A = 1000 - 2 × 15 = 1000 - 30 = 970\nDemand for Product B = 1500 - price of Product B = 1500 - 16.5 = 1483.5\n\nSince the company wants to maximize profit, it should produce and sell all the demanded units. Therefore, the optimal production quantity for each product is:\n\nOptimal production quantity for Product A = x = 970 units\nOptimal production quantity for Product B = y = 1483.5 units (rounded down to 1483 units since we cannot produce half a unit)\n\nSo, the optimal production quantity for Product A is 970 units, and for Product B is 1483 units."
