    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star of the given 1-form α with respect to the metric tensor g, we first need to know the components of g. Since g is not provided, we will assume the standard Euclidean metric tensor, which has the components g_{ij} = δ_{ij} (Kronecker delta), meaning g_{11} = g_{22} = g_{33} = 1 and all other components are zero.\n\nNow, let's compute the Hodge star of α. The Hodge star of a 1-form in 3-dimensional space is a 2-form, which can be written as:\n\n*(α) = (1/2) ε^ijk α_j g_kl dx^i ∧ dx^l\n\nwhere ε^ijk is the Levi-Civita symbol, and α_j are the components of the 1-form α. In our case, α = -3z dx + 2x dy + y dz, so α_1 = -3z, α_2 = 2x, and α_3 = y.\n\nNow, let's compute the components of the Hodge star:\n\n*(α)_1 = (1/2) ε^1jk α_j g_kl = (1/2) (ε^123 α_2 g_33 + ε^132 α_3 g_22) = (1/2) (2x + y)\n\n*(α)_2 = (1/2) ε^2jk α_j g_kl = (1/2) (ε^231 α_3 g_11 + ε^213 α_1 g_33) = (1/2) (-3z - y)\n\n*(α)_3 = (1/2) ε^3jk α_j g_kl = (1/2) (ε^312 α_1 g_22 + ε^321 α_2 g_11) = (1/2) (3z - 2x)\n\nSo, the Hodge star of α is:\n\n*(α) = (1/2) (2x + y) dy ∧ dz - (1/2) (3z + y) dz ∧ dx + (1/2) (3z - 2x) dx ∧ dy\n\nNow, let's evaluate this at the point (1, -2, 3):\n\n*(α) = (1/2) (2(1) - 2) dy ∧ dz - (1/2) (3(3) - 2) dz ∧ dx + (1/2) (3(3) - 2(1)) dx ∧ dy\n\n*(α) = - dy ∧ dz - 4 dz ∧ dx + 7 dx ∧ dy\n\nSo, the Hodge star of α with respect to the metric tensor g at the point (1, -2, 3) is:\n\n*(α) = - dy ∧ dz - 4 dz ∧ dx + 7 dx ∧ dy"
