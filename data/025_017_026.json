    "message_2": "To find the minimal model of the given elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + 2$, we need to find a birationally equivalent curve with minimal discriminant. We can do this by applying a series of transformations to the curve.\n\nFirst, let's compute the discriminant of the given curve. The discriminant of a cubic curve of the form $y^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C$ is given by the formula:\n\n$\\Delta = -4A^3C + A^2B^2 - 4B^3 - 27C^2 + 18ABC$.\n\nIn our case, $A = -4$, $B = 5$, and $C = 2$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$\\Delta = -4(-4)^3(2) + (-4)^2(5)^2 - 4(5)^3 - 27(2)^2 + 18(-4)(5)(2) = -2048 + 320 - 500 - 216 + 720 = -724$.\n\nNow, let's perform a change of variables to eliminate the $x^2$ term. We can do this by setting $x' = x - \\frac{A}{3} = x + \\frac{4}{3}$ and $y' = y$. Then, we have:\n\n$y'^2 = (x' - \\frac{4}{3})^3 - 4(x' - \\frac{4}{3})^2 + 5(x' - \\frac{4}{3}) + 2$.\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$y'^2 = x'^3 - \\frac{25}{3}x' + \\frac{118}{27}$.\n\nNow, we have a curve in the form $y'^2 = x'^3 + Ax' + B$, with $A = -\\frac{25}{3}$ and $B = \\frac{118}{27}$. The discriminant of this curve is the same as the original curve, which is $\\Delta = -724$.\n\nSince the discriminant is non-zero, the curve is non-singular. Moreover, the $j$-invariant of this curve is given by:\n\n$j = 2^8 \\cdot \\frac{(\\Delta_A)^3}{\\Delta} = 2^8 \\cdot \\frac{(-27A)^3}{\\Delta} = 2^8 \\cdot \\frac{(-27(-\\frac{25}{3}))^3}{-724} = 2^8 \\cdot \\frac{(-25)^3}{-4} = 2^8 \\cdot 390625$.\n\nSince the $j$-invariant is non-zero and finite, the curve is already minimal. Therefore, the minimal model of the given curve is:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 - \\frac{25}{3}x + \\frac{118}{27}$."
