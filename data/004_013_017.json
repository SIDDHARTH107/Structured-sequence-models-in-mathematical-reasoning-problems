    "message_2": "To find the maximum or minimum value of the quadratic function f(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 5, we first need to determine if the parabola opens upwards or downwards. Since the coefficient of the x^2 term is positive (3), the parabola opens upwards, which means it has a minimum value but no maximum value.\n\nTo find the minimum value and the x-value at which it occurs, we can use the vertex formula for a quadratic function in the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c:\n\nVertex: (h, k)\nh = -b / 2a\nk = f(h)\n\nIn our case, a = 3, b = -18, and c = 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the x-value (h) at which the minimum occurs:\n\nh = -(-18) / (2 * 3) = 18 / 6 = 3\n\nNow, let's find the minimum value (k) by plugging h back into the function:\n\nk = f(3) = 3(3)^2 - 18(3) + 5 = 3(9) - 54 + 5 = 27 - 54 + 5 = -22\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function is -22, and it occurs at x = 3. There is no maximum value for this function since the parabola opens upwards."
