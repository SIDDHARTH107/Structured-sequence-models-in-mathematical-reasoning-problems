Using the forward difference method, estimate the acceleration of the car at t=5s.\n\n| time (s) | velocity (m/s) |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0 | 0 |\n| 1 | 5 |\n| 2 | 12 |\n| 3 | 22 |\n| 4 | 35 |\n| 5 | 51 |\n| 6 | 70 |\n| 7 | 92 |\n| 8 | 115 |\n| 9 | 139 |\n| 10 | 164 |",
    "message_2": "To estimate the acceleration using the forward difference method, we need to find the difference in velocity between two consecutive time points and divide it by the time interval. Since we want to find the acceleration at t=5s, we will use the velocity values at t=5s and t=6s.\n\nAcceleration = (Velocity at t=6s - Velocity at t=5s) / (6s - 5s)\n\nAcceleration = (70 m/s - 51 m/s) / (1s)\n\nAcceleration = 19 m/s²\n\nSo, the estimated acceleration of the car at t=5s using the forward difference method is 19 m/s²."
