    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of f(x), we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since f(x) is an odd function (f(-x) = -f(x)), all the a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to compute the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe formula for b_n is given by:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) is defined piecewise, we need to split the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (-1) * sin(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] (1) * sin(nx) dx]\n\nNow, we can integrate each part:\n\n∫[-π, 0] (-1) * sin(nx) dx = (1/n) * [cos(nx)] | from -π to 0\n∫[0, π] (1) * sin(nx) dx = (-1/n) * [cos(nx)] | from 0 to π\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integrals at their limits:\n\n(1/n) * [cos(nx)] | from -π to 0 = (1/n) * [cos(0) - cos(-nπ)] = (1/n) * [1 - cos(nπ)]\n(-1/n) * [cos(nx)] | from 0 to π = (-1/n) * [cos(nπ) - cos(0)] = (-1/n) * [cos(nπ) - 1]\n\nNow, we can sum the two parts to find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/n) * [1 - cos(nπ)] - (1/n) * [cos(nπ) - 1]]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nb_n = (2/nπ) * [1 - cos(nπ)]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ [b_n * sin(nx)] from n=1 to infinity\n\nf(x) = Σ [(2/nπ) * [1 - cos(nπ)] * sin(nx)] from n=1 to infinity\n\nNow, we need to evaluate f(π/4):\n\nf(π/4) = Σ [(2/nπ) * [1 - cos(nπ)] * sin(n(π/4))] from n=1 to infinity\n\nSince f(x) is defined as 1 for 0 ≤ x < π, we have:\n\nf(π/4) = 1"
