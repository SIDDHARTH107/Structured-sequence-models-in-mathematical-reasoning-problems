    "message_2": "To find the pattern, let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n3 - 1 = 2\n7 - 3 = 4\n13 - 7 = 6\n21 - 13 = 8\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are increasing by 2 each time. So, the next difference should be 8 + 2 = 10. \n\nNow, to find the next term in the sequence, add this difference to the last term:\n\n21 + 10 = 31\n\nSo, the next term in the sequence is 31."
