    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the region bounded by the curve y = 2x^2 and the x-axis between x = 0 and x = 4 about the x-axis, we can use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the area of cross-sectional disks along the axis of rotation.\n\nThe area of each disk is given by A(x) = πr^2, where r is the radius of the disk. In this case, the radius is equal to the function y = 2x^2. So, A(x) = π(2x^2)^2 = 4πx^4.\n\nNow, we integrate the area function A(x) with respect to x from 0 to 4:\n\nV = ∫[0, 4] 4πx^4 dx\n\nTo integrate, we use the power rule: ∫x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C\n\nV = 4π ∫[0, 4] x^4 dx = 4π[(x^5)/5] from 0 to 4\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds:\n\nV = 4π[(4^5)/5 - (0^5)/5] = 4π[(1024)/5] = 819.2π\n\nSo, the volume of the solid formed by rotating the region bounded by the curve y = 2x^2 and the x-axis between x = 0 and x = 4 about the x-axis is 819.2π cubic units."
