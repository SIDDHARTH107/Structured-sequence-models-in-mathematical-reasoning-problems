    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to the application of the Fourier transform to finance and economics:\n\nThe daily stock price of a certain company for the past year is given by the function f(t) = 95 + 10 sin(2πt/365), where t is measured in days. Find the frequency and amplitude of the stock price oscillation using the Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency and amplitude of the stock price oscillation, we can analyze the given function f(t) = 95 + 10 sin(2πt/365). The Fourier transform is not necessary in this case, as the function is already in a simple sinusoidal form.\n\nThe function f(t) represents a sinusoidal oscillation with a constant term and a sinusoidal term. The constant term is 95, which represents the average stock price. The sinusoidal term is 10 sin(2πt/365), which represents the oscillation of the stock price around the average.\n\nThe amplitude of the oscillation is given by the coefficient of the sinusoidal term, which is 10. This means that the stock price oscillates with an amplitude of 10 units around the average price.\n\nThe frequency of the oscillation can be found by analyzing the argument of the sine function, which is (2πt/365). The coefficient of t in the argument is (2π/365), which represents the angular frequency of the oscillation. To find the frequency in cycles per day, we can divide the angular frequency by 2π:\n\nFrequency = (2π/365) / 2π = 1/365 cycles per day\n\nSo, the frequency of the stock price oscillation is 1/365 cycles per day.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude of the stock price oscillation is 10 units, and the frequency is 1/365 cycles per day."
