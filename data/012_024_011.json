    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the inequality for non-planar graphs.\n\nEuler's formula for planar graphs states that:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, V = 10 and E = 15. We want to find the smallest possible genus g such that the graph can be embedded on a surface of genus g without edge crossings.\n\nFor non-planar graphs, we can use the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6\n\nLet's first check if the graph is planar by plugging in the values of V and E:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nThe inequality is not satisfied, so the graph is not planar. Now, let's find the smallest genus g that satisfies the inequality:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 + 6g - 6\n6g ≥ 15 - 30 + 6\n6g ≥ -9\ng ≥ -1.5\n\nSince the genus must be a non-negative integer, the smallest possible genus for the graph G is g = 1. Therefore, the genus of the graph G is 1."
