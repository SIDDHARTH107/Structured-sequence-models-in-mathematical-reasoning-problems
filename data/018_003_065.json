    "message_2": "The union of set A and set B is the set of all elements that are in either set A or set B or in both. To find the union, we simply combine the elements of both sets without repeating any elements.\n\nSet A = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nSet B = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n\nUnion of set A and set B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, we need to prove that this resulting set is a superset of both set A and set B. A superset is a set that contains all the elements of another set.\n\nLet's call the union set C.\n\nSet C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nFor set C to be a superset of set A, every element in set A must also be in set C. We can see that this is true:\n\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ C\n4 ∈ A and 4 ∈ C\n6 ∈ A and 6 ∈ C\n8 ∈ A and 8 ∈ C\n\nTherefore, set C is a superset of set A.\n\nSimilarly, for set C to be a superset of set B, every element in set B must also be in set C. This is also true:\n\n1 ∈ B and 1 ∈ C\n3 ∈ B and 3 ∈ C\n5 ∈ B and 5 ∈ C\n7 ∈ B and 7 ∈ C\n\nTherefore, set C is a superset of set B.\n\nIn conclusion, the union of set A and set B, which is set C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, is a superset of both set A and set B."
