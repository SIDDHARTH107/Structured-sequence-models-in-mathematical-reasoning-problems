    "message_2": "To find the invariant ring of the action of G on X, we need to find the set of functions on X that are invariant under the action of G. Let's denote the action of G on X as φ: G × X → X, where φ(g, (x, y)) = (x', y').\n\nFor g = 0 (mod 2), we have φ(0, (x, y)) = (x, y), and for g = 1 (mod 2), we have φ(1, (x, y)) = (-x, iy).\n\nNow, let's consider the coordinate ring of X, which is the ring of polynomial functions on X. We can denote this ring as k[x, y]/(y^2 - x^3 + x), where k is the field of coefficients (usually the field of complex numbers).\n\nThe invariant ring of the action of G on X is the set of functions f(x, y) in the coordinate ring of X such that f(φ(g, (x, y))) = f(x, y) for all g in G.\n\nFor g = 0 (mod 2), we have f(φ(0, (x, y))) = f(x, y), which is trivially true for all functions in the coordinate ring of X.\n\nFor g = 1 (mod 2), we need to find the functions f(x, y) such that f(-x, iy) = f(x, y). Let's consider a general polynomial function f(x, y) = ∑_{i, j} a_{i, j} x^i y^j, where a_{i, j} are coefficients in k.\n\nWe have:\n\nf(-x, iy) = ∑_{i, j} a_{i, j} (-x)^i (iy)^j = ∑_{i, j} a_{i, j} (-1)^i x^i i^j y^j.\n\nFor f(-x, iy) to be equal to f(x, y), we need the following conditions to hold:\n\n1. If i is odd, then a_{i, j} = 0, because (-1)^i = -1 and we need the terms with odd powers of x to cancel out.\n2. If j is odd, then a_{i, j} = 0, because i^j = i and we need the terms with odd powers of y to cancel out.\n\nThus, the invariant ring consists of polynomial functions with even powers of x and y. We can write a general element of the invariant ring as:\n\nf(x, y) = ∑_{i, j} a_{2i, 2j} x^{2i} y^{2j}.\n\nHowever, we still need to take into account the defining equation of X, y^2 = x^3 - x. Since y^2 is even, we can substitute it into the invariant polynomial:\n\nf(x, y) = ∑_{i, j} a_{2i, 2j} x^{2i} (x^3 - x)^j.\n\nNow, we can rewrite f(x, y) as a polynomial in x only:\n\nf(x, y) = ∑_{i, j} a_{2i, 2j} x^{2i + 3j} (1 - x^2)^j.\n\nSo, the invariant ring of the action of G on X is the set of polynomial functions in x with even powers, subject to the defining equation of X. In other words, the invariant ring is k[x^2, x^4, x^6, ...]/(x^6 - x^4)."
