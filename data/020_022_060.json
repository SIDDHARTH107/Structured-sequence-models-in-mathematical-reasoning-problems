    "message_1": "A company produces two different products, Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 5 units of Resource X and 3 units of Resource Y for production, and each unit of Product B requires 2 units of Resource X and 6 units of Resource Y for production. The company has a total of 200 units of Resource X and 300 units of Resource Y available for production. If the profit made from each unit of Product A sold is $10 and from each unit of Product B sold is $15, what is the maximum profit that the company can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced and y be the number of units of Product B produced.\n\nThe constraints for the resources are as follows:\n\n5x + 2y ≤ 200 (Resource X constraint)\n3x + 6y ≤ 300 (Resource Y constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraints for y:\n\nFrom the Resource X constraint:\n\ny ≤ (200 - 5x) / 2\n\nFrom the Resource Y constraint:\n\ny ≤ (300 - 3x) / 6\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. For the Resource X constraint, when x = 0, y = 100; when x = 40, y = 0.\n2. For the Resource Y constraint, when x = 0, y = 50; when x = 100, y = 0.\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 50), (40, 0), and (20, 40).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0, 50) = 10(0) + 15(50) = $750\n3. Profit at (40, 0) = 10(40) + 15(0) = $400\n4. Profit at (20, 40) = 10(20) + 15(40) = $800\n\nThe maximum profit is $800, which occurs when the company produces 20 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B."
