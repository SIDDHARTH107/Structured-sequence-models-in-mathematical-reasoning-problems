    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products, A and B, which each require different amounts of resources. Product A requires 2 units of resource X and 3 units of resource Y, while product B requires 4 units of resource X and 1 unit of resource Y. The company has 60 units of resource X and 45 units of resource Y available. The company sells product A for $5 per unit and product B for $8 per unit. Using the artificial bee colony algorithm, determine the optimal number of products A and B that the company should produce in order to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. However, since this is a relatively simple linear programming problem, we can solve it using the graphical method or the simplex method. Here, we will use the graphical method to find the optimal solution.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The constraints for the problem are:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 60 (resource X constraint)\n3x + y ≤ 45 (resource Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product A)\ny ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product B)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 8y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 4y ≤ 60 => y ≤ (60 - 2x) / 4 => y ≤ 15 - 0.5x\n2. 3x + y ≤ 45 => y ≤ 45 - 3x\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 15), (10, 10), and (15, 0). Now, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 15) = 5(0) + 8(15) = $120\n3. P(10, 10) = 5(10) + 8(10) = $130\n4. P(15, 0) = 5(15) + 8(0) = $75\n\nThe maximum profit of $130 is achieved when the company produces 10 units of product A and 10 units of product B."
