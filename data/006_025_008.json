    "message_1": "A theater performance has a total of 50 seats. The probability of each seat being occupied is 0.6. What is the probability that at least 30 seats will be occupied during the performance?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 30 seats will be occupied, we can use the binomial probability formula and sum the probabilities from 30 to 50 seats being occupied. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the total number of seats (50), k is the number of occupied seats, p is the probability of a seat being occupied (0.6), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 30 seats being occupied, so we need to sum the probabilities for k = 30 to k = 50:\n\nP(X ≥ 30) = Σ P(X=k) for k = 30 to 50\n\nCalculating each term and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 30) ≈ 0.996\n\nSo, the probability that at least 30 seats will be occupied during the performance is approximately 0.996 or 99.6%."
