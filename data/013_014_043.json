You have four interested buyers, and you know each buyer's maximum price for the car. The potential buyers' maximum prices for the car are $60,000, $70,000, $80,000, and $85,000. \n\nHow can you design an auction so that you maximize your revenue while ensuring that the vintage car ends up in the hands of the buyer who values it the most? Provide a detailed mechanism design that outlines which buyer gets the car and what price they will pay.",
    "message_2": "To maximize your revenue while ensuring that the vintage car ends up in the hands of the buyer who values it the most, you can use a second-price sealed-bid auction, also known as a Vickrey auction. In this auction mechanism, each buyer submits a sealed bid, and the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid price.\n\nHere's how the auction would work:\n\n1. Each of the four buyers submits a sealed bid, which represents their maximum price for the car. In this case, the bids are $60,000, $70,000, $80,000, and $85,000.\n\n2. You, as the auctioneer, open the sealed bids and determine the highest bid and the second-highest bid. In this example, the highest bid is $85,000, and the second-highest bid is $80,000.\n\n3. The highest bidder (the buyer who values the car the most) wins the auction and pays the second-highest bid price. In this case, the buyer who bid $85,000 wins the auction and pays $80,000 for the vintage car.\n\nThis auction mechanism ensures that the car goes to the buyer who values it the most, as they are willing to bid the highest amount. Additionally, it encourages buyers to bid their true maximum price, as they know they will only have to pay the second-highest bid if they win. This design maximizes your revenue while maintaining fairness and efficiency in the auction process."
