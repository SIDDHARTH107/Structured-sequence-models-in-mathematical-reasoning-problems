    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nA company's stock price, measured in dollars, is given by the function $f(t) = 10\\cos(0.1t) + 5\\sin(0.2t) + 2\\cos(0.5t),$ where $t$ is measured in months. Use Fourier analysis to determine the frequencies and amplitudes of the underlying cycles in this stock price.\n\n(Note: To solve this problem, the student will need to apply the Fourier transform to the given function $f(t)$ and analyze the resulting frequency spectrum.)",
    "message_2": "To determine the frequencies and amplitudes of the underlying cycles in the stock price, we can analyze the given function $f(t) = 10\\cos(0.1t) + 5\\sin(0.2t) + 2\\cos(0.5t)$. We can see that this function is already in the form of a sum of sinusoidal functions, so we don't need to apply the Fourier transform. Instead, we can directly read off the frequencies and amplitudes from the function.\n\nThe function has three sinusoidal components:\n\n1. $10\\cos(0.1t)$: The amplitude is 10, and the frequency is $0.1$ (in units of radians per month). To convert this to cycles per month, we divide by $2\\pi$: $\\frac{0.1}{2\\pi} \\approx 0.0159$ cycles per month.\n\n2. $5\\sin(0.2t)$: The amplitude is 5, and the frequency is $0.2$ (in units of radians per month). To convert this to cycles per month, we divide by $2\\pi$: $\\frac{0.2}{2\\pi} \\approx 0.0318$ cycles per month.\n\n3. $2\\cos(0.5t)$: The amplitude is 2, and the frequency is $0.5$ (in units of radians per month). To convert this to cycles per month, we divide by $2\\pi$: $\\frac{0.5}{2\\pi} \\approx 0.0796$ cycles per month.\n\nSo, the underlying cycles in the stock price have the following frequencies and amplitudes:\n\n1. Amplitude: 10, Frequency: $\\approx 0.0159$ cycles per month\n2. Amplitude: 5, Frequency: $\\approx 0.0318$ cycles per month\n3. Amplitude: 2, Frequency: $\\approx 0.0796$ cycles per month"
