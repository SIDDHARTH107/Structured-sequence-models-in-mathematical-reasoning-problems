    "message_1": "A company produces light bulbs, and the mean lifespan for a bulb is 2000 hours with a standard deviation of 100 hours. A random sample of 50 bulbs is taken, and the mean lifespan is found to be 1950 hours. Is there evidence to suggest that the mean lifespan of the bulbs has decreased? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is evidence to suggest that the mean lifespan of the bulbs has decreased, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the mean lifespan has not decreased, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the mean lifespan has decreased.\n\nGiven information:\nPopulation mean (μ) = 2000 hours\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 100 hours\nSample size (n) = 50 bulbs\nSample mean (x̄) = 1950 hours\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean:\nSE = σ / √n = 100 / √50 ≈ 14.14\n\nNext, we calculate the t-score:\nt = (x̄ - μ) / SE = (1950 - 2000) / 14.14 ≈ -3.53\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 49. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.68.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-3.53) is less than the critical t-value (-1.68), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H1). There is evidence to suggest that the mean lifespan of the bulbs has decreased at a significance level of 0.05."
