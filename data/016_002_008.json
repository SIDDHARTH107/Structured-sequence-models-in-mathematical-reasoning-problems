    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a Koch snowflake after four iterations, we need to understand how the perimeter changes with each iteration. \n\nIn the first iteration, each side of the equilateral triangle is divided into three equal parts, and a smaller equilateral triangle is added to the middle part. This process increases the length of each side by 1/3. So, after the first iteration, the length of each side becomes (4/3) times the original length.\n\nWith each subsequent iteration, the same process is applied to every side of the resulting shape. Therefore, after four iterations, the length of each side will be (4/3)^4 times the original length.\n\nSo, the length of each side after four iterations is (4/3)^4 * 6 cm ≈ 21.3333 cm.\n\nSince the Koch snowflake has three sides, the perimeter after four iterations is 3 * 21.3333 cm ≈ 64 cm."
