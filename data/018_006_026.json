    "message_2": "To find the complement of set $A$, denoted by $A'$, we need to find all the elements in the universal set $U$ that are not in set $A$. Since $U$ contains all integers between -6 and 8, and $A = \\{-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1\\}$, we can list the elements in $A'$ as follows:\n\n$A' = \\{-6, -5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$\n\nNow, we need to find the union of sets $A$ and $A'$, denoted by $A \\cup A'$. The union of two sets is the set containing all elements that are in either of the two sets. In this case, since $A$ and $A'$ are complements, their union will contain all elements in the universal set $U$. \n\n$A \\cup A' = \\{-6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$\n\nAs we can see, $A \\cup A'$ contains all integers between -6 and 8, which is the same as the universal set $U$. Therefore, $A \\cup A' = U$."
