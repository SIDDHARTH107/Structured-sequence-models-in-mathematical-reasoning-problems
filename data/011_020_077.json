    "message_1": "During a game of Set (a card game), a set of cards is chosen from a deck of 81 cards. Each card has four attributes, which can have three values each. A set is a group of three cards where all attributes are either the same or different. \n\nHow many different sets of cards can be chosen?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the four attributes of the cards. Since each attribute can have three values, there are 3^4 = 81 different cards in the deck, which matches the problem statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of attributes for a set. For each attribute, there are three possibilities:\n\n1. All three cards have the same value for the attribute.\n2. All three cards have different values for the attribute.\n\nFor each attribute, there are 3 ways to choose the same value (since there are 3 possible values) and 3! (3 factorial) ways to choose different values. So, there are 3 + 3! = 3 + 6 = 9 possible combinations for each attribute.\n\nSince there are four attributes, there are 9^4 = 6561 possible combinations of attributes for a set. However, this includes the combination where all four attributes are the same for all three cards, which is not allowed in the game of Set. There is only 1 such combination (the same card repeated three times), so we need to subtract it from the total.\n\nTherefore, there are 6561 - 1 = 6560 different sets of cards that can be chosen in the game of Set."
