    "message_1": "For a math student studying group theory and trying to prove that every group of order 4 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4, a precise numerical problem to solve could be:\n\nSuppose G is a group of order 4. Show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4 by determining the multiplication table for G and verifying the group axioms for each possible isomorphism.",
    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 4 with elements {e, a, b, c}. We know that e is the identity element. We will now consider two cases to show that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nWithout loss of generality, let the order of element a be 4. Then, a^2 ≠ e and a^3 ≠ e, but a^4 = e. Since the order of G is 4, the remaining two elements b and c must be the other powers of a. Thus, b = a^2 and c = a^3. The multiplication table for G is:\n\n```\n   e  a  b  c\ne  e  a  b  c\na  a  b  c  e\nb  b  c  e  a\nc  c  e  a  b\n```\n\nThis multiplication table represents the cyclic group C4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G has no elements of order 4.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Thus, a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. The multiplication table for G is:\n\n```\n   e  a  b  c\ne  e  a  b  c\na  a  e  c  b\nb  b  c  e  a\nc  c  b  a  e\n```\n\nThis multiplication table represents the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 4 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
