    "message_2": "The union of sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. In this case, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}.\n\nNow, we need to prove that A ∪ B is a superset of both set A and set B. A set C is a superset of set A if every element of A is also an element of C. Similarly, a set C is a superset of set B if every element of B is also an element of C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of set A:\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\nSince all elements of set A are also elements of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of set A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of set B:\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\nSince all elements of set B are also elements of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of set B.\n\nTherefore, we have proved that the union of sets A and B, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}, is a superset of both set A and set B."
