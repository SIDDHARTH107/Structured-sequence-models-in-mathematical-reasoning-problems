    "message_1": "Let's say there are 6 members in a community who are asked to contribute to the creation and maintenance of a park. Each member can either decide to contribute or not. If a member contributes, they contribute $10, and if they don't contribute, they don't have to pay anything. The park needs a total of $40 to be created and maintained. If less than 6 members contribute, the park will not be created. \n\n1) What is the minimum number of members needed to contribute for the park to be created?\n2) If all 6 members contribute, what is each member's payoff? \n3) If only 4 members contribute, what is each member's payoff? \n4) If all 6 members don't contribute, what happens to the park and what is each member's payoff?",
    "message_2": "1) The minimum number of members needed to contribute for the park to be created is 4. This is because 4 members contributing $10 each will provide the required $40 for the park's creation and maintenance.\n\n2) If all 6 members contribute, the total amount contributed will be $60. Since the park only needs $40, there will be a surplus of $20. This surplus can be divided equally among the 6 members, so each member will receive $20/6 = $3.33 (rounded to two decimal places) back. Therefore, each member's payoff will be $10 (the amount they contributed) - $3.33 (the amount they receive back) = $6.67.\n\n3) If only 4 members contribute, the total amount contributed will be $40, which is exactly the amount needed for the park's creation and maintenance. In this case, there will be no surplus, so each of the 4 contributing members will have a payoff of $0 (since they don't receive any money back). The other 2 members who didn't contribute will have a payoff of $0 as well, as they didn't contribute any money.\n\n4) If all 6 members don't contribute, the park will not be created, as there will be no funds for its creation and maintenance. In this scenario, each member's payoff will be $0, as no one contributed any money."
