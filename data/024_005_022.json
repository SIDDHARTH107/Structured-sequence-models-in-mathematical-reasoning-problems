    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms. Let's parameterize the surface S by the coordinates (x, y) as follows:\n\nr(x, y) = (x, y, x^2 - 2y^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_x = (1, 0, 2x)\nr_y = (0, 1, -4y)\n\nAt the point (1, -1, -1), we have:\n\nr_x(1, -1) = (1, 0, 2)\nr_y(1, -1) = (0, 1, 4)\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_x • r_x = 1^2 + 0^2 + 2^2 = 5\nF = r_x • r_y = 1*0 + 0*1 + 2*4 = 8\nG = r_y • r_y = 0^2 + 1^2 + 4^2 = 17\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_xx = (0, 0, 2)\nr_yy = (0, 0, -8)\nr_xy = r_yx = (0, 0, 0)\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = r_xx • N = (0, 0, 2) • (0, 0, 1) = 2\nM = r_xy • N = (0, 0, 0) • (0, 0, 1) = 0\nN = r_yy • N = (0, 0, -8) • (0, 0, 1) = -8\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures by solving the characteristic equation:\n\ndet(K - kI) = 0\n\nwhere K is the shape operator matrix:\n\nK = | L M | = |  2  0 |\n    | M N |   |  0 -8 |\n\nand k is the principal curvature. The characteristic equation is:\n\n(2 - k)(-8 - k) - 0 = 0\nk^2 - 6k + 16 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the principal curvatures:\n\nk1 = (6 + sqrt(6^2 - 4*16)) / 2 = 3 + sqrt(5)\nk2 = (6 - sqrt(6^2 - 4*16)) / 2 = 3 - sqrt(5)\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1, -1, -1) are k1 = 3 + sqrt(5) and k2 = 3 - sqrt(5)."
