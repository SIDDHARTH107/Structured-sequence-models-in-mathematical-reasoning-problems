The market demand function is P(Q) = 200 - Q, where Q = Q1 + Q2 is the total quantity produced. What is the Cournot equilibrium quantity produced by each firm and the market price?",
    "message_2": "To find the Cournot equilibrium, we need to first find the reaction functions for each firm. The reaction function shows the best response of one firm to the quantity produced by the other firm. \n\nLet's start with firm 1. Firm 1's profit function is given by:\n\nπ1(Q1, Q2) = P(Q) * Q1 - TC1(Q1)\n\nSubstitute the given functions:\n\nπ1(Q1, Q2) = (200 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q1 - 30Q1\n\nNow, to find the reaction function, we need to maximize the profit function with respect to Q1. To do this, we take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to Q1 and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπ1/dQ1 = (200 - Q1 - Q2 - 30) - Q1 = 0\n\nSolve for Q1:\n\n170 - 2Q1 - Q2 = 0\n\nThe reaction function for firm 1 is:\n\nQ1 = (170 - Q2) / 2\n\nNow, let's find the reaction function for firm 2. Firm 2's profit function is given by:\n\nπ2(Q1, Q2) = P(Q) * Q2 - TC2(Q2)\n\nSubstitute the given functions:\n\nπ2(Q1, Q2) = (200 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q2 - 20Q2\n\nTake the first derivative of the profit function with respect to Q2 and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπ2/dQ2 = (200 - Q1 - Q2 - 20) - Q2 = 0\n\nSolve for Q2:\n\n180 - Q1 - 2Q2 = 0\n\nThe reaction function for firm 2 is:\n\nQ2 = (180 - Q1) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the Cournot equilibrium by solving the two reaction functions simultaneously:\n\nQ1 = (170 - Q2) / 2\nQ2 = (180 - Q1) / 2\n\nSubstitute the expression for Q2 from the second equation into the first equation:\n\nQ1 = (170 - ((180 - Q1) / 2)) / 2\n\nSolve for Q1:\n\nQ1 = 60\n\nNow, substitute the value of Q1 back into the second reaction function to find Q2:\n\nQ2 = (180 - 60) / 2\nQ2 = 60\n\nSo, the Cournot equilibrium quantities produced by each firm are Q1 = 60 and Q2 = 60.\n\nNow, let's find the market price at this equilibrium. The market demand function is P(Q) = 200 - Q, where Q = Q1 + Q2. Substitute the equilibrium quantities:\n\nP(Q) = 200 - (60 + 60)\nP(Q) = 200 - 120\nP(Q) = 80\n\nThe Cournot equilibrium market price is $80."
