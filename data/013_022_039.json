    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player A is given $10 to share with Player B. Player A can allocate any amount between $0 and $10 to Player B, keeping the remainder for themselves. If Player B accepts the allocation, both players keep their respective amounts. If Player B rejects the allocation, both players receive $0. If Player B is only concerned with their own payoff, what is the minimum amount that Player A should offer to Player B to ensure acceptance?",
    "message_2": "If Player B is only concerned with their own payoff and wants to maximize it, they would accept any amount greater than $0, as receiving something is better than receiving nothing. Therefore, the minimum amount that Player A should offer to Player B to ensure acceptance is $0.01 (1 cent), as it is the smallest positive amount that can be offered."
