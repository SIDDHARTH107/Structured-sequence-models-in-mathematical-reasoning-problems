    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference between A and B. The symmetric difference (A △ B) is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nIntersection of A and B (A ∩ B) = {2, 3}\n\nA △ B = (A - (A ∩ B)) ∪ (B - (A ∩ B)) = {1} ∪ {4} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of each set. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. We need to define a universal set U to find the complements. Let's assume the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nAᶜ = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 2, 3} = {4, 5}\nBᶜ = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4} = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between Aᶜ and Bᶜ.\n\nAᶜ △ Bᶜ = (Aᶜ - (Aᶜ ∩ Bᶜ)) ∪ (Bᶜ - (Aᶜ ∩ Bᶜ)) = {4} ∪ {5} = {4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference (A △ B).\n\n(A △ B)ᶜ = U - (A △ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 4} = {2, 3, 5}\n\nSince (A △ B)ᶜ ≠ Aᶜ △ Bᶜ, the distributive property does not hold for this case."
