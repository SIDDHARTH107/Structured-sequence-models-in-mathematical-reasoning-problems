    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the given multiplication table. We can see that it is not abelian since, for example, be ≠ eb. Therefore, it cannot be isomorphic to C36, which is an abelian group.\n\nNow let's consider A4 × C3. The order of A4 × C3 is 12 × 3 = 36, which matches the order of the given group. However, A4 × C3 is also abelian since both A4 and C3 are abelian. Since the given group is not abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C3.\n\nSince the given group is not isomorphic to either C36 or A4 × C3, it must be one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36."
