    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nLet L be the length of the initial segment (1st iteration). At each iteration, the total length of the curve doubles. So, for the nth iteration, the total length of the curve is L * 2^(n-1).\n\nFor the 11th iteration, the total length of the curve would be:\n\nL * 2^(11-1) = L * 2^10 = L * 1024\n\nSo, the total length of the 11th iteration of the Heighway dragon curve is 1024 times the length of the initial segment (L)."
