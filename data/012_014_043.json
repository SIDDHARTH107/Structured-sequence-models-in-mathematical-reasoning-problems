    "message_2": "Graph 1 and Graph 2 are not isomorphic. To show this, we can use the degree sequence of the vertices in each graph. The degree sequence is a list of the degrees of the vertices in a graph, sorted in non-increasing order.\n\nFor Graph 1, we have a triangle connected to a square. The degree sequence for this graph is {3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1}, where the three vertices of the triangle have degree 3, the three vertices of the square have degree 2, and the vertex connecting the triangle to the square has degree 1.\n\nFor Graph 2, we have two triangles connected to each other. The degree sequence for this graph is {3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2}, where the two vertices connecting the triangles have degree 3, and the other four vertices have degree 2.\n\nSince the degree sequences of Graph 1 and Graph 2 are not the same, the two graphs are not isomorphic."
