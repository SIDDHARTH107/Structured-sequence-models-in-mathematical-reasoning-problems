    "message_1": "Suppose that the average daily temperature and the daily ice cream sales for a community are recorded over a period of one month. After analyzing the data, it is found that there is a strong positive correlation between the two variables. The average daily temperature for the month of July is 85°F. If on a day when the temperature reaches 100°F, the total ice cream sales for that day were 200 units, what would be the predicted ice cream sales on a day where the temperature reaches 90°F?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of linear regression. Since there is a strong positive correlation between the average daily temperature and daily ice cream sales, we can assume that the relationship between these two variables can be represented by a linear equation of the form:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nwhere y represents the daily ice cream sales, x represents the average daily temperature, m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-intercept.\n\nWe are given that when the temperature reaches 100°F, the total ice cream sales for that day were 200 units. So, we have one data point (100, 200).\n\nWe also know that the average daily temperature for the month of July is 85°F. We can assume that the average daily ice cream sales for the month of July would be the average of the ice cream sales on a day when the temperature reaches 100°F and the ice cream sales on a day when the temperature reaches 90°F. Let's call the ice cream sales on a day when the temperature reaches 90°F as y_90.\n\nSo, the average daily ice cream sales for the month of July would be (200 + y_90) / 2.\n\nNow, we can use the given data points to find the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) of the linear equation.\n\nUsing the point (100, 200), we can write the equation as:\n\n200 = m * 100 + b\n\nUsing the average daily temperature and average daily ice cream sales for the month of July, we can write the equation as:\n\n(200 + y_90) / 2 = m * 85 + b\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables (m and b):\n\n1) 200 = 100m + b\n2) (200 + y_90) / 2 = 85m + b\n\nFirst, solve equation 1 for b:\n\nb = 200 - 100m\n\nNow, substitute this expression for b into equation 2:\n\n(200 + y_90) / 2 = 85m + (200 - 100m)\n\nSimplify and solve for m:\n\n(200 + y_90) / 2 = -15m + 200\n\nNow, subtract 200 from both sides:\n\ny_90 / 2 = -15m\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\ny_90 = -30m\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y_90 back into the equation for b:\n\nb = 200 - 100(-30m)\n\nb = 200 + 3000m\n\nNow, we have expressions for both y_90 and b in terms of m:\n\ny_90 = -30m\nb = 200 + 3000m\n\nNow, substitute the expression for b back into equation 1:\n\n200 = 100m + (200 + 3000m)\n\nSimplify and solve for m:\n\n0 = 100m + 3000m\n\n3100m = 0\n\nm = 0\n\nSince we have a strong positive correlation between the two variables, the slope (m) should not be 0. This indicates that there might be some missing information or an error in the problem statement. However, based on the given information, we cannot find the predicted ice cream sales on a day where the temperature reaches 90°F."
