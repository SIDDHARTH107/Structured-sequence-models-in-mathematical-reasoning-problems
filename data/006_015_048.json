    "message_1": "Suppose that a network is susceptible to two types of cyber attacks: A and B. The probability of attack A occurring on any given day is 0.1, and the probability of attack B occurring is 0.05. What is the probability that the network will experience at least one cyber attack in a given day?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one cyber attack occurring in a given day, we can first find the probability of no cyber attacks occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of attack A not occurring is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9, and the probability of attack B not occurring is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95. Since these events are independent, the probability of both not occurring is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(no A and no B) = P(no A) * P(no B) = 0.9 * 0.95 = 0.855\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one cyber attack occurring by subtracting the probability of no attacks from 1:\n\nP(at least one attack) = 1 - P(no A and no B) = 1 - 0.855 = 0.145\n\nSo, the probability that the network will experience at least one cyber attack in a given day is 0.145 or 14.5%."
