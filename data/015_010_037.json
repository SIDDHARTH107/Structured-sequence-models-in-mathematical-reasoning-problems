    "message_2": "To find the period-4 cycle of the chaotic system x(n+1) = sin(πx(n)) with the initial condition x(0) = 0.5, we will iterate the system four times and then solve for the fixed points.\n\nLet's first iterate the system four times:\n\n1. x(1) = sin(πx(0)) = sin(π(0.5)) = sin(π/2) = 1\n2. x(2) = sin(πx(1)) = sin(π(1)) = sin(π) = 0\n3. x(3) = sin(πx(2)) = sin(π(0)) = sin(0) = 0\n4. x(4) = sin(πx(3)) = sin(π(0)) = sin(0) = 0\n\nNow, we have x(4) = 0, and since we are looking for a period-4 cycle, we want x(4) = x(0) = 0.5. To find the fixed points, we will set x(4) = x(0) and solve for x(0):\n\n0.5 = sin(πx(0))\n\nTo solve for x(0), we will take the inverse sine of both sides:\n\nx(0) = (1/π) * arcsin(0.5)\n\nx(0) ≈ (1/π) * (π/6) = 1/6\n\nSo, the period-4 cycle for the initial condition x(0) = 0.5 is approximately x(0) ≈ 0.17 (accurate to two decimal places)."
