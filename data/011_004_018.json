    "message_1": "How many ways can you assign five different math textbooks to three students if each student must receive at least one book?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to distribute the books without any restrictions. There are 3 students, and each book can be given to any of the 3 students. So, for each book, there are 3 choices. Since there are 5 books, the total number of ways to distribute the books is 3^5 = 243.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the cases where at least one student doesn't receive a book. There are 3 ways to choose which student doesn't receive a book, and then there are 2 choices for each of the 5 books (either given to the first student or the second student). So, there are 3 * 2^5 = 96 ways where at least one student doesn't receive a book.\n\nHowever, we have subtracted the cases where two students don't receive a book twice, so we need to add those cases back. There are 3 ways to choose which student receives all the books, and there is only 1 way to distribute the books in this case (all 5 books go to the chosen student). So, there are 3 * 1 = 3 ways where two students don't receive a book.\n\nUsing the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the total number of ways to distribute the books such that each student receives at least one book is:\n\nTotal ways - Ways with at least one student without a book + Ways with two students without a book = 243 - 96 + 3 = 150.\n\nSo, there are 150 ways to distribute the five different math textbooks to three students, ensuring that each student receives at least one book."
