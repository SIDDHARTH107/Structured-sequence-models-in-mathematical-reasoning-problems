    "message_1": "A delivery truck starts at point A and has to deliver packages to points B, C, D, and E. The distances between the points are AB = 6 km, BC = 8 km, CD = 4 km, and DE = 7 km. What is the optimal route for the delivery truck to minimize the total distance traveled?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the brute force method by calculating the total distance for each possible route and then selecting the route with the shortest distance. Since the truck starts at point A and has to deliver packages to points B, C, D, and E, there are 4! (4 factorial) = 24 possible routes. However, we can eliminate some routes by observing that the truck must travel between B and C, C and D, and D and E. This leaves us with the following possible routes:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E\n2. A-B-D-C-E\n3. A-C-B-D-E\n4. A-C-D-B-E\n5. A-D-B-C-E\n6. A-D-C-B-E\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance for each route:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E: 6 + 8 + 4 + 7 = 25 km\n2. A-B-D-C-E: 6 + (BD) + 4 + 7 = 6 + BD + 11\n3. A-C-B-D-E: (AC) + 8 + 4 + 7 = AC + 19\n4. A-C-D-B-E: (AC) + (CD) + (BE) = AC + CD + BE\n5. A-D-B-C-E: (AD) + (DB) + 8 + 7 = AD + DB + 15\n6. A-D-C-B-E: (AD) + 4 + (BE) = AD + 4 + BE\n\nSince we don't have the exact distances for AC, AD, BD, BE, and CD, we cannot determine the exact optimal route. However, we can make some observations:\n\n- Route 1 has a total distance of 25 km, which is the longest possible distance without any additional distance from the missing values.\n- Routes 2, 3, 5, and 6 all have at least one missing value, which means their total distances will be greater than the given values (11, 19, 15, and 4, respectively).\n- Route 4 has two missing values (AC and CD), which means its total distance will be greater than the given value (BE).\n\nBased on these observations, we can conclude that the optimal route will be one of the routes with only one missing value (Routes 2, 3, 5, or 6). However, without the exact distances for AC, AD, BD, and BE, we cannot determine the exact optimal route."
