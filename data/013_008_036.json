    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, there are 4 players who each have to decide how much money to contribute to the public pool. The payoffs are such that each player starts with $100 and the combined amount contributed to the public pool is multiplied by a factor of 1.5 and then split equally amongst all players. What is the optimal amount for each player to contribute to maximize their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the amount contributed by each player as x1, x2, x3, and x4. The total amount contributed to the public pool will be the sum of these amounts: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4.\n\nThe combined amount contributed to the public pool is then multiplied by a factor of 1.5: 1.5(x1 + x2 + x3 + x4).\n\nThis amount is then split equally among all players, so each player receives: (1.5(x1 + x2 + x3 + x4))/4.\n\nThe payoff for each player is their initial $100 minus their contribution plus their share of the public pool. For example, the payoff for player 1 is: 100 - x1 + (1.5(x1 + x2 + x3 + x4))/4.\n\nTo maximize their own payoff, each player should consider the other players' contributions as fixed and choose their own contribution to maximize their payoff. Taking the derivative of the payoff function with respect to the player's contribution and setting it to zero, we can find the optimal contribution for each player.\n\nFor player 1, the derivative of the payoff function with respect to x1 is: -1 + (1.5/4) = -0.625. Since this is a negative value, it means that the optimal contribution for player 1 is x1 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, for players 2, 3, and 4, the derivatives of their payoff functions with respect to their contributions are also negative, indicating that the optimal contributions for these players are also 0.\n\nTherefore, the optimal amount for each player to contribute to maximize their own payoff is $0. However, it is important to note that this result is based on the assumption that each player is only concerned with maximizing their own payoff and does not consider the overall welfare of the group. In practice, the outcome of a Public Goods Game can be influenced by factors such as cooperation, altruism, and social norms."
