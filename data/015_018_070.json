    "message_2": "The Duffing oscillator is a nonlinear oscillator, and its chaotic behavior can be analyzed using numerical methods. To find the amplitude of the oscillator when it is in its chaotic behavior, we can use a numerical integration method, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to solve the differential equation.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\n1. x' = y\n2. y' = cos(t) - 0.1y - x - 0.5x^3\n\nNow, we can use the Runge-Kutta method to solve this system of equations with the initial conditions x(0) = 0 and y(0) = 1. The Runge-Kutta method involves iterating through time steps and updating the values of x and y at each step.\n\nAfter performing the numerical integration for a sufficient amount of time, the system will reach its chaotic behavior. At this point, we can analyze the values of x(t) to find the amplitude of the oscillator. The amplitude will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of x(t) during the chaotic behavior.\n\nNote that the specific amplitude value will depend on the numerical integration method used and the time step chosen for the integration. Additionally, chaotic systems are sensitive to initial conditions, so the amplitude may vary slightly for different initial conditions or numerical methods."
