What is the shortest route the truck can take to visit all locations and return to its base location, assuming it starts and ends at the same location?\n\n| Location | A | B | C | D | E |\n|----------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A        | 0 | 3 | 6 | 7 | 10 |\n| B        | 3 | 0 | 4 | 9 | 2  |\n| C        | 6 | 4 | 0 | 5 | 8  |\n| D        | 7 | 9 | 5 | 0 | 3  |\n| E        |10 | 2 | 8 | 3 | 0  |",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest route, we can use the brute force method by calculating the total distance for all possible routes and then selecting the one with the minimum distance. Since there are 5 locations (excluding the base location), there are 5! (5 factorial) or 120 possible routes. However, since the route is a round trip, we can divide this by 2, resulting in 60 unique routes to consider.\n\nHere are the possible routes and their total distances:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E-A: 3+4+5+3+10 = 25\n2. A-B-C-E-D-A: 3+4+8+3+7 = 25\n3. A-B-D-C-E-A: 3+9+5+8+10 = 35\n4. A-B-D-E-C-A: 3+9+3+8+6 = 29\n5. A-B-E-C-D-A: 3+2+8+5+7 = 25\n6. A-B-E-D-C-A: 3+2+3+5+6 = 19\n\n7. A-C-B-D-E-A: 6+4+9+3+10 = 32\n8. A-C-B-E-D-A: 6+4+2+3+7 = 22\n9. A-C-D-B-E-A: 6+5+9+2+10 = 32\n10. A-C-D-E-B-A: 6+5+3+3+3 = 20\n11. A-C-E-B-D-A: 6+8+2+9+7 = 32\n12. A-C-E-D-B-A: 6+8+3+3+3 = 23\n\n13. A-D-B-C-E-A: 7+9+4+8+10 = 38\n14. A-D-B-E-C-A: 7+9+2+8+6 = 32\n15. A-D-C-B-E-A: 7+5+4+2+10 = 28\n16. A-D-C-E-B-A: 7+5+8+2+3 = 25\n17. A-D-E-B-C-A: 7+3+2+4+6 = 22\n18. A-D-E-C-B-A: 7+3+8+4+3 = 25\n\n19. A-E-B-C-D-A: 10+2+4+5+7 = 28\n20. A-E-B-D-C-A: 10+2+9+5+6 = 32\n21. A-E-C-B-D-A: 10+8+4+9+7 = 38\n22. A-E-C-D-B-A: 10+8+5+9+3 = 35\n23.
