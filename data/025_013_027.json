    "message_2": "The genus of an elliptic curve is a topological invariant and does not depend on the field over which the curve is defined. In general, the genus of an elliptic curve given by a Weierstrass equation (such as the one provided) is always 1. Therefore, the genus of the elliptic curve with equation $y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 1$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_5$ is 1."
