    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x, we first need to find its derivative, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points.\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first factor out the greatest common divisor, which is 3:\n\n3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the equation 3(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0 has two solutions:\n\nx = 1 and x = 3\n\nThese are the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x."
