    "message_1": "A researcher conducts a survey on the daily number of hours spent on different activities by 100 students. The researcher wants to reduce the data by compressing the information into a few variables. The researcher performs principal component analysis and obtains two principal components. The two principal components explain 70% and 20% of the total variation, respectively. Calculate the percentage of the total variation explained by the remaining principal components.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the percentage of the total variation explained by the remaining principal components, we need to subtract the percentages explained by the first two principal components from 100%.\n\nTotal variation = 100%\nTotal variation explained by the first two principal components = 70% + 20% = 90%\n\nPercentage of total variation explained by the remaining principal components = Total variation - Total variation explained by the first two principal components\n\nPercentage of total variation explained by the remaining principal components = 100% - 90% = 10%\n\nSo, the remaining principal components explain 10% of the total variation."
