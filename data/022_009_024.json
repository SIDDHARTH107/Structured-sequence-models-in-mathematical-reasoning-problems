    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than 1, then the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{(x+3)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}}{\\frac{(x+3)^n}{n!}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x+3)^{n+1}n!}{(x+3)^n(n+1)!}\\right|$$\n\nCancel out the common terms:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x+3)}{n+1}\\right|$$\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the expression converges to 0, which is less than 1. Therefore, the power series converges for all x, and the radius of convergence is infinite.\n\nSince the radius of convergence is infinite, the interval of convergence is the entire real number line:\n\n$$(-\\infty, \\infty)$$"
