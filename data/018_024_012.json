    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B, then find the complement of the set obtained by symmetric difference. Using these sets, prove that the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it's the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the set obtained by symmetric difference. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. Let's assume the universal set U contains all the elements from sets A and B.\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nThe complement of the symmetric difference set (A ∆ B) is:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {1, 4} = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement. To do this, we need to show that (A ∆ B)' ≠ A' ∆ B'. If the symmetric difference were distributive over complement, then these two sets would be equal.\n\nFirst, let's find the complements of sets A and B:\n\nA' = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {1, 2, 3} = {4}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3, 4} = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the complements A' and B':\n\nA' ∆ B' = (A' ∪ B') - (A' ∩ B')\n\nA' ∪ B' = {4} ∪ {1} = {1, 4}\nA' ∩ B' = {4} ∩ {1} = {}\n\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 4} - {} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets we found:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = {2, 3}\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 4}\n\nSince (A ∆ B)' ≠ A' ∆ B', the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement."
