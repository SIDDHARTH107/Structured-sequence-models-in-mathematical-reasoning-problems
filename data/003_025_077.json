    "message_1": "A plane is traveling north at a speed of 300 km/h. There is a crosswind blowing from the east at a speed of 50 km/h. Find the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity vector of the plane. Use trigonometry to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity vector of the plane, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry.\n\nLet Vp be the velocity of the plane (300 km/h) and Vw be the velocity of the wind (50 km/h). The resultant velocity vector Vr can be represented as the hypotenuse of a right triangle with Vp and Vw as the legs.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the magnitude of the resultant velocity vector:\n\nVr^2 = Vp^2 + Vw^2\nVr^2 = (300 km/h)^2 + (50 km/h)^2\nVr^2 = 90,000 + 2,500\nVr^2 = 92,500\nVr = √92,500\nVr ≈ 304.14 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the direction of the resultant velocity vector using trigonometry. We'll use the tangent function and the arctangent (inverse tangent) function to find the angle θ between the north direction and the resultant velocity vector.\n\ntan(θ) = Vw / Vp\ntan(θ) = 50 km/h / 300 km/h\ntan(θ) = 1/6\n\nθ = arctan(1/6)\nθ ≈ 9.46 degrees\n\nSo, the magnitude of the resultant velocity vector is approximately 304.14 km/h, and its direction is approximately 9.46 degrees east of north."
