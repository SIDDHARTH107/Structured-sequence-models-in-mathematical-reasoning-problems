    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (-3, -4), we first need to find the slope (m) of the line. The formula for the slope is:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points (x1, y1) = (2, 5) and (x2, y2) = (-3, -4), we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nm = (-4 - 5) / (-3 - 2)\nm = (-9) / (-5)\nm = 9/5\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nPlugging in the slope (m = 9/5) and one of the points (x1, y1) = (2, 5):\n\ny - 5 = (9/5)(x - 2)\n\nTo get the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), we can distribute the 9/5 and simplify:\n\ny - 5 = (9/5)x - (9/5)(2)\ny - 5 = (9/5)x - 18/5\ny = (9/5)x - 18/5 + 25/5\ny = (9/5)x + 7/5\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (-3, -4) is:\n\ny = (9/5)x + 7/5"
