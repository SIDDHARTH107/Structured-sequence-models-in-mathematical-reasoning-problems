    "message_2": "According to Wilson's theorem, for a prime number p, (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p. Let's find the smallest prime number p that satisfies this condition.\n\nFor p = 2, (2-1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is divisible by 2.\n\nTherefore, the smallest prime number p such that (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p according to Wilson's theorem is p = 2."
