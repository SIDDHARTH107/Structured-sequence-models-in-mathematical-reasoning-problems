    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order nonlinear differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. The differential equation is:\n\ndy/dt = y(5-2y)\n\nRearrange the equation to separate the variables:\n\ndy/(y(5-2y)) = dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides of the equation:\n\n∫(1/(y(5-2y))) dy = ∫ dt\n\nTo solve the integral on the left side, we can use partial fraction decomposition. Let:\n\n1/(y(5-2y)) = A/y + B/(5-2y)\n\nMultiplying both sides by y(5-2y) to clear the denominators, we get:\n\n1 = A(5-2y) + B(y)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by choosing appropriate values for y:\n\n1. Let y = 0:\n1 = 5A => A = 1/5\n\n2. Let y = 5/2:\n1 = B(5/2) => B = 2/5\n\nNow we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n∫(1/5(1/y) + 2/5(1/(5-2y))) dy = ∫ dt\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n(1/5)∫(1/y) dy + (2/5)∫(1/(5-2y)) dy = ∫ dt\n\n(1/5)ln|y| - (1/5)ln|5-2y| = t + C\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition y(0) = 1:\n\n(1/5)ln|1| - (1/5)ln|5-2(1)| = 0 + C\n\n0 - (1/5)ln|3| = C\n\nC = -(1/5)ln(3)\n\nNow we have the general solution:\n\n(1/5)ln|y| - (1/5)ln|5-2y| = t - (1/5)ln(3)\n\nTo find the behavior of the system as t increases to infinity, we can analyze the equation:\n\nAs t -> ∞, the left side of the equation must also increase. Since ln|y| and ln|5-2y| are both logarithmic functions, they will increase slowly as their arguments increase. However, ln|5-2y| has a negative coefficient, so it will decrease as its argument increases. This means that as t -> ∞, y must approach the value that makes the term ln|5-2y| as small as possible, which occurs when y -> 5/2.\n\nTherefore, as t increases to infinity, the behavior of the system is such that y(t) approaches 5/2."
