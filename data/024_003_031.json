    "message_2": "The Gaussian curvature (K) of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nK = 1/R^2\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the radius (R) is 5 units. So, the Gaussian curvature (K) can be calculated as:\n\nK = 1/(5^2)\nK = 1/25\nK = 0.04 units^-2\n\nThe Gaussian curvature of this sphere is 0.04 units^-2."
