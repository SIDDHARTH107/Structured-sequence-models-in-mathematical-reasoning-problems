    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it consists of elements that are unique to each set.\n\nFor sets A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {2, 4, 6}, their symmetric difference A Δ B is:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nSince there is no intersection between A and B, the symmetric difference is simply the union of both sets."
