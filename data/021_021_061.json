    "message_1": "A factory produces two products, A and B. Each unit of A requires 3 hours of processing time and 2 hours of finishing time, while each unit of B requires 2 hours of processing and 1 hour of finishing time. The factory has 240 hours of processing time and 160 hours of finishing time available each week. The profit per unit of A is $100 and the profit per unit of B is $150. What is the maximum profit the factory can earn per week if it uses the cuckoo search algorithm to solve the optimization problem?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum profit, we need to set up the constraints and the objective function for the optimization problem.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Processing time: 3x + 2y ≤ 240\n2. Finishing time: 2x + y ≤ 160\n3. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 100x + 150y\n\nThe cuckoo search algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that can be used to find the optimal solution to this problem. However, since this is a linear programming problem, we can also solve it using the graphical method or the simplex method.\n\nUsing the graphical method, we can plot the constraints and find the feasible region:\n\n1. 3x + 2y = 240 -> y = (240 - 3x) / 2\n2. 2x + y = 160 -> y = 160 - 2x\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0,0), (0,80), (40,60), and (80,0). We can now evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 100(0) + 150(0) = $0\n2. P(0,80) = 100(0) + 150(80) = $12,000\n3. P(40,60) = 100(40) + 150(60) = $13,000\n4. P(80,0) = 100(80) + 150(0) = $8,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $13,000 per week, which occurs when the factory produces 40 units of product A and 60 units of product B."
