    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nWe are given the base (10 cm) and an angle (60 degrees) between the base and one of its sides. We can use the sine function to find the height of the triangle.\n\nLet's denote the given angle as A, the base as b, and the other side as c. We can use the sine function as follows:\n\nsin(A) = height / c\n\nWe are given A = 60 degrees and c = 8 cm. First, we need to find the sine of 60 degrees:\n\nsin(60) = √3 / 2\n\nNow, we can find the height:\n\nheight = sin(60) * c\nheight = (√3 / 2) * 8\nheight = 4√3 cm\n\nNow that we have the height, we can find the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * 10 * 4√3\nArea = 5 * 4√3\nArea = 20√3 cm²"
