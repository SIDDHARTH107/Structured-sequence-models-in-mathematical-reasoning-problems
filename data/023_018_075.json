    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input using the Fourier transform, we first need to represent the input signal in the frequency domain. The input signal is a sinusoid with amplitude 3 and frequency 1 rad/s, which can be represented as:\n\nx(t) = 3 * sin(1 * t)\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of the input signal x(t). The Fourier transform of a sine function is given by:\n\nX(jω) = (j * A * π) * (δ(ω - ω0) - δ(ω + ω0))\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, ω0 is the frequency, and δ is the Dirac delta function. In our case, A = 3 and ω0 = 1, so the Fourier transform of the input signal is:\n\nX(jω) = (j * 3 * π) * (δ(ω - 1) - δ(ω + 1))\n\nNow, we need to find the output signal in the frequency domain by multiplying the input signal's Fourier transform with the system's transfer function. The Laplace transform is used to represent the transfer function in the frequency domain. Since G(s) is already given as a function of s, we can substitute s = jω to obtain the frequency domain representation:\n\nG(jω) = (jω + 2) / ((jω)^2 + 2(jω) + 2)\n\nNow, we can find the output signal in the frequency domain by multiplying G(jω) with X(jω):\n\nY(jω) = G(jω) * X(jω)\n\nY(jω) = ((jω + 2) / ((jω)^2 + 2(jω) + 2)) * (j * 3 * π) * (δ(ω - 1) - δ(ω + 1))\n\nTo find the steady-state response, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(jω). However, since the output signal is a product of the transfer function and the input signal, we can directly find the steady-state response by substituting ω = 1 in G(jω):\n\nG(j) = (j + 2) / (j^2 + 2j + 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the magnitude and phase of G(j):\n\n|G(j)| = sqrt((j + 2)(j* - 2)) / sqrt((j^2 + 2j + 2)(-j^2 + 2j + 2))\n\n|G(j)| ≈ 1.075\n\n∠G(j) = atan2(Imaginary part, Real part) = atan2(1, 2) ≈ 0.4636 rad\n\nNow, we can find the steady-state response y(t) by multiplying the input signal x(t) with the magnitude and phase of G(j):\n\ny(t) = |G(j)| * 3 * sin(1 * t + ∠G(j))\n\ny(t) ≈ 3.225 * sin(t + 0.4636)\n\nSo, the steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input of frequency 1 rad/s and amplitude 3 is approximately:\n\ny(t) ≈ 3.225 * sin(t + 0.4636)"
