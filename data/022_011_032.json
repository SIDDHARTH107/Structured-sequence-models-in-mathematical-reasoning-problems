    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function, we need to solve the equation $z^3 + 3z - 2 = 0$. To find the poles, we need to solve the equation $z^2 + 1 = 0$. \n\nFirst, let's find the zeros of the function:\n\n$z^3 + 3z - 2 = 0$\n\nThis equation does not have an obvious factorization, so we can use numerical methods to find the zeros. Using a numerical solver, we find that the zeros are approximately:\n\n$z_1 \\approx -1.5321$\n$z_2 \\approx 0.7660 - 0.6428i$\n$z_3 \\approx 0.7660 + 0.6428i$\n\nNow, let's find the poles of the function:\n\n$z^2 + 1 = 0$\n\nThis equation can be factored as $(z + i)(z - i) = 0$. So, the poles are:\n\n$z_4 = i$\n$z_5 = -i$\n\nNow, we can determine the orders of the zeros and poles. In this case, all zeros and poles are simple (order 1) because they are distinct and do not have any repeated factors.\n\nIn summary, the function $f(z) = \\frac{z^3 + 3z - 2}{z^2 + 1}$ has three zeros and two poles. The zeros are located at $z_1 \\approx -1.5321$, $z_2 \\approx 0.7660 - 0.6428i$, and $z_3 \\approx 0.7660 + 0.6428i$, all with order 1. The poles are located at $z_4 = i$ and $z_5 = -i$, also with order 1."
