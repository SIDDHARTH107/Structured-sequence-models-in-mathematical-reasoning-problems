    "message_1": "A company has a dataset of 100 applicants containing their scores in math, science, and English. Out of these 100 applicants, 60 were selected for a job interview and the remaining 40 were rejected. Using discriminant analysis, can you predict which of the remaining applicants would be selected for an interview based on their scores in math (X₁), science(X₂), and English (X₃): \n\n- Applicant 1: X₁=90, X₂=80, X₃=70\n- Applicant 2: X₁=60, X₂=75, X₃=85",
    "message_2": "To perform discriminant analysis, we need more information about the dataset, such as the mean and covariance matrix of the scores for both the selected and rejected groups. Discriminant analysis is a statistical method that requires this information to create a discriminant function that can classify new data points (in this case, the remaining applicants) into one of the two groups (selected or rejected).\n\nHowever, without this information, it is not possible to perform discriminant analysis and predict which of the remaining applicants would be selected for an interview based on their scores in math (X₁), science (X₂), and English (X₃)."
