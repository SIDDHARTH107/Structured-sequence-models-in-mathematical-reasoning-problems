The cosine of an angle is equal to the x-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle.\n\nFor the angle θ = 5π/6 (or 150°), the cosine value is:\n\ncos(5π/6) = -√3/2\n\nTherefore, the exact value of arccosine of (-√3/2) is:\n\narccos(-√3/2) = 5π/6 (or 150°)"
