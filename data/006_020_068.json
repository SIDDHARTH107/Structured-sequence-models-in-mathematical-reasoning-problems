    "message_1": "In a small community of 200 families, 60% have a pet dog, 30% have a pet cat and 10% have both as a pet. If a family is randomly selected from the community, what is the probability that they do not have any pets?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a family does not have any pets, we first need to find the probability that a family has either a dog or a cat or both. We can use the formula:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)\n\nwhere A represents having a dog, B represents having a cat, and A and B represent having both a dog and a cat.\n\nP(A) = 60% = 0.6\nP(B) = 30% = 0.3\nP(A and B) = 10% = 0.1\n\nP(A or B) = 0.6 + 0.3 - 0.1 = 0.8\n\nNow, we can find the probability of not having any pets by subtracting the probability of having a pet from 1:\n\nP(No pets) = 1 - P(A or B) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected family does not have any pets is 0.2 or 20%."
