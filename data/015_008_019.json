    "message_2": "The Feigenbaum constant $\\delta$ is a universal constant that appears in the study of bifurcation diagrams of certain nonlinear maps, such as the logistic map. It is approximately equal to $\\delta \\approx 4.6692$. This constant is independent of the specific logistic map equation and its parameters.\n\nTo find the associated value of $r_\\infty$ for this system, we need to find the value of $r$ at which the logistic map undergoes an infinite number of bifurcations in a finite interval of $r$ values. This is known as the accumulation point of bifurcations. The value of $r_\\infty$ can be found using the following formula:\n\n$$r_\\infty = r_n + \\frac{r_{n+1} - r_n}{\\delta}$$\n\nHere, $r_n$ and $r_{n+1}$ are the values of $r$ at which the $n$-th and $(n+1)$-th bifurcations occur. To find these values, we need to analyze the bifurcation diagram of the logistic map equation.\n\nFor the logistic map with $r=3.5$, the system undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation at $r_1 \\approx 3$ and another one at $r_2 \\approx 3.4495$. Using these values, we can find the value of $r_\\infty$:\n\n$$r_\\infty = r_1 + \\frac{r_2 - r_1}{\\delta}$$\n$$r_\\infty = 3 + \\frac{3.4495 - 3}{4.6692}$$\n$$r_\\infty \\approx 3.0962$$\n\nSo, the Feigenbaum constant $\\delta \\approx 4.6692$ and the associated value of $r_\\infty \\approx 3.0962$ for this logistic map system."
