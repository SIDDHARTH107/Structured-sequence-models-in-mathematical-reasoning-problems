    "message_2": "A maximal simplex is a simplex that is not a proper face of any other simplex in the simplicial complex. In the given simplicial complex K, we have the following simplices:\n\n1. {v1, v2, v3}\n2. {v2, v3, v4}\n3. {v1, v3, v4}\n\nNone of these simplices are proper faces of any other simplex in K. Therefore, all three simplices are maximal simplices.\n\nThe number of maximal simplices in K is 3."
