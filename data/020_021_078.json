The processing time required for each product on each machine is given in the table:\n\n\n\n| Product | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 | Machine 4 |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| A       | 6         | 2         | 1         | 5         |\n| B       | 3         | 5         | 4         | 2         |\n| C       | 2         | 4         | 5         | 1         |\n\n\nEach product must go through each of the 4 machines, and the manufacturing process must be scheduled in a way that minimizes the total processing time for all 3 products. What is the optimal scheduling plan for the manufacturing process, given the above processing times?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total processing time for all 3 products, we can use the Johnson's rule algorithm. This algorithm is used for scheduling tasks on two or more machines in a way that minimizes the total processing time.\n\nStep 1: Identify the shortest processing time among all the remaining unscheduled tasks.\nStep 2: If the shortest processing time is on Machine 1, schedule the task as early as possible. If it is on Machine 2, 3, or 4, schedule the task as late as possible.\nStep 3: Remove the scheduled task from the list of unscheduled tasks.\nStep 4: Repeat Steps 1-3 until all tasks are scheduled.\n\nApplying Johnson's rule to the given problem:\n\n1. Shortest processing time: 1 (Product A on Machine 3)\n2. Schedule Product A on Machine 3 as early as possible.\n3. Remove Product A from the list of unscheduled tasks.\n\n| Product | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 4 |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| B       | 3         | 5         | 2         |\n| C       | 2         | 4         | 1         |\n\n1. Shortest processing time: 1 (Product C on Machine 4)\n2. Schedule Product C on Machine 4 as late as possible.\n3. Remove Product C from the list of unscheduled tasks.\n\n| Product | Machine 1 | Machine 2 |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| B       | 3         | 5         |\n\n1. Shortest processing time: 3 (Product B on Machine 1)\n2. Schedule Product B on Machine 1 as early as possible.\n3. Remove Product B from the list of unscheduled tasks.\n\nThe optimal scheduling plan is:\n\n| Order   | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 | Machine 4 |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1       | B         | A         | A         | C         |\n| 2       | C         | C         | B         | B         |\n| 3       | A         | B         | C         | A         |\n\nTotal processing time: (3+2+6) + (5+4+2) + (4+5+1) + (1+2+5) = 11 + 11 + 10 + 8 = 40."
