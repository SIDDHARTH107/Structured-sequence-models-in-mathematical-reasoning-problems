    "message_2": "A group of order 20 can have subgroups of order 5 due to Sylow's Theorem. Let's denote the number of subgroups of order 5 as n_5. According to Sylow's Theorem, n_5 must divide the order of the group (20) and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 4.\n\nNow let's consider the three isomorphic groups of order 20: C20, D10, and the non-abelian group.\n\n1. C20 (Cyclic group of order 20): \nC20 has a unique subgroup of order 5, generated by an element of order 5. So in this case, n_5 = 1.\n\n2. D10 (Dihedral group of order 20):\nD10 has 4 subgroups of order 5, generated by the rotations of the 10-gon. So in this case, n_5 = 4.\n\n3. Non-abelian group:\nThe non-abelian group of order 20 is the semidirect product of C5 and C4, denoted as C5 ⋊ C4. This group also has 4 subgroups of order 5, generated by the elements of order 5 in the C5 component. So in this case, n_5 = 4.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 20 can have either 1 or 4 subgroups of order 5. If it has 1 subgroup of order 5, it is isomorphic to C20. If it has 4 subgroups of order 5, it can be isomorphic to either D10 or the non-abelian group C5 ⋊ C4."
