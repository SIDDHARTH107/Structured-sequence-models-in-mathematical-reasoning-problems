    "message_2": "To find a suitable δ, we first analyze the expression |f(x) - f(x₀)|:\n\n|f(x) - f(x₀)| = |x² - x₀²| = |(x - x₀)(x + x₀)|.\n\nWe want to find a δ such that |x - x₀| < δ implies |f(x) - f(x₀)| < ε.\n\nSince x, x₀ ∈ [0, 1], we have that x + x₀ ≤ 1 + 1 = 2. Thus, |x - x₀||x + x₀| ≤ 2|x - x₀|.\n\nNow, let δ = ε/2. Then, if |x - x₀| < δ, we have:\n\n|f(x) - f(x₀)| = |(x - x₀)(x + x₀)| ≤ 2|x - x₀| < 2δ = ε.\n\nSo, for any ε > 0 and x₀ ∈ [0, 1], we can choose δ = ε/2 to satisfy the given condition."
