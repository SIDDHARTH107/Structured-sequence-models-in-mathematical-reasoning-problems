    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the particle's velocity is between 4 and 6 after 3 seconds, given that its initial velocity is 2 and its velocity follows a Wiener process.\n\nFirst, let's recall the properties of a Wiener process. A Wiener process W(t) has the following properties:\n\n1. W(0) = 0\n2. The increments are independent, i.e., W(t+s) - W(t) is independent of W(u+v) - W(u) for all s, t, u, v such that t ≠ u and s ≠ v.\n3. The increments are normally distributed with mean 0 and variance t, i.e., W(t) - W(s) ~ N(0, t-s) for all 0 ≤ s < t.\n\nNow, let's consider the given Wiener process for the particle's velocity: dV = 5dW(t). Integrating both sides with respect to time, we get:\n\nV(t) - V(0) = 5(W(t) - W(0))\n\nSince W(0) = 0 and V(0) = 2, we have:\n\nV(t) = 2 + 5W(t)\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the particle's velocity is between 4 and 6 after 3 seconds, i.e., P(4 ≤ V(3) ≤ 6). Using the expression for V(t), we get:\n\nP(4 ≤ 2 + 5W(3) ≤ 6)\n\nSubtracting 2 from all sides, we get:\n\nP(2 ≤ 5W(3) ≤ 4)\n\nDividing by 5, we get:\n\nP(0.4 ≤ W(3) ≤ 0.8)\n\nSince W(3) is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 3, we can standardize the variable by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (which is the square root of the variance):\n\nP( (0.4 - 0) / √3 ≤ (W(3) - 0) / √3 ≤ (0.8 - 0) / √3 )\n\nP( 0.4 / √3 ≤ Z ≤ 0.8 / √3 )\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability:\n\nP( 0.2309 ≤ Z ≤ 0.4619 )\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find the corresponding probabilities:\n\nP(Z ≤ 0.4619) = 0.6772\nP(Z ≤ 0.2309) = 0.4082\n\nNow, we can find the probability that Z is between 0.2309 and 0.4619:\n\nP( 0.2309 ≤ Z ≤ 0.4619 ) = P(Z ≤ 0.4619) - P(Z ≤ 0.2309) = 0.6772 - 0.4082 = 0.2690\n\nSo, the probability that the particle's velocity is between 4 and 6 after 3 seconds is approximately 0.2690 or 26.90%."
