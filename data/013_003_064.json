    "message_1": "In Ultimatum Game, Player 1 is given $200 and offers a portion of it to Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the offer, they both keep the money. If Player 2 rejects the offer, neither player gets any money. What is the minimum offer Player 1 should make to Player 2 in order to maximize his/her chances of Player 2 accepting the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the minimum offer Player 1 should make to Player 2 in order to maximize his/her chances of Player 2 accepting the offer depends on the rationality and preferences of Player 2. \n\nIf Player 2 is perfectly rational and only cares about maximizing their own monetary gain, then Player 1 could offer the smallest possible amount above $0 (e.g., $0.01) and Player 2 would accept it, as it is better than getting nothing. \n\nHowever, in reality, people often have preferences for fairness and may reject offers that they perceive as too low or unfair. In this case, Player 1 should offer an amount that is more likely to be perceived as fair by Player 2. A common benchmark for fairness is a 50-50 split, so offering $100 to Player 2 would be a reasonable strategy to maximize the chances of acceptance.\n\nUltimately, the minimum offer depends on the specific context and the preferences of the players involved."
