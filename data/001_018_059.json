    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x^2 + 9) - log(3x) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms. \n\nFirst, we can combine the two logarithms using the quotient rule, which states that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b):\n\nlog((x^2 + 9)/(3x)) = 2\n\nNow, we can remove the logarithm by using the property that if log(a) = b, then a = 10^b:\n\n(x^2 + 9)/(3x) = 10^2\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 + 9 = 300x\n\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 300x + 9 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -300, and c = 9:\n\nx = (300 ± √((-300)^2 - 4(1)(9))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (300 ± √(90000 - 36)) / 2\n\nx = (300 ± √(89964)) / 2\n\nx = (300 ± 299.94) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (300 + 299.94) / 2 = 599.94 / 2 = 299.97\n\nx = (300 - 299.94) / 2 = 0.06 / 2 = 0.03\n\nSo, the two possible solutions for x are x = 299.97 and x = 0.03."
