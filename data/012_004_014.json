    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm, we will start with an arbitrary vertex and then iteratively add the shortest edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside the tree. We will start with vertex A.\n\n1. Add vertex A to the tree.\n2. Add the shortest edge connected to A, which is A-B with weight 5. The tree now contains vertices A and B.\n3. The shortest edge connected to A or B is B-D with weight 4. Add vertex D and the edge B-D to the tree.\n4. The shortest edge connected to A, B, or D is D-C with weight 3. Add vertex C and the edge D-C to the tree.\n\nNow all vertices are included in the tree, and the minimum spanning tree is complete. The tree contains the following edges: A-B, B-D, and D-C.\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is the sum of the weights of these edges: 5 + 4 + 3 = 12."
