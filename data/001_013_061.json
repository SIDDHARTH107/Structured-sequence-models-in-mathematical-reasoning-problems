    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(2x + 7) = 5, we will first square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n\n(√(2x + 7))^2 = 5^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x + 7 = 25\n\nNow, we will isolate the x term by subtracting 7 from both sides:\n\n2x = 25 - 7\n2x = 18\n\nFinally, we will divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx = 18 / 2\nx = 9\n\nSo, the solution to the equation √(2x + 7) = 5 is x = 9."
