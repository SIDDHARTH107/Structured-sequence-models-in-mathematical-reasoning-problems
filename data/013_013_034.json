    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid first-price auction, each bidder submits a secret bid, and the highest bidder wins the item, paying the amount of their bid. Bidders typically bid less than their true valuation to avoid overpaying.\n\nTo calculate the expected revenue for the seller, we need to consider the possible bidding strategies of each bidder. Let's assume that each bidder bids a fraction of their true valuation:\n\nBidder 1: $1000 * x\nBidder 2: $800 * y\nBidder 3: $1200 * z\n\nSince we don't have information about the specific bidding strategies, we can assume that each bidder bids a fraction between 0 and 1 of their true valuation. In this case, the expected bid for each bidder would be half of their valuation:\n\nBidder 1: $1000 * 0.5 = $500\nBidder 2: $800 * 0.5 = $400\nBidder 3: $1200 * 0.5 = $600\n\nUnder these assumptions, Bidder 3 would win the auction with a bid of $600. Therefore, the expected revenue for the seller would be $600. However, it's important to note that the actual revenue could be different depending on the specific bidding strategies used by the bidders."
