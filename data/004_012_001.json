    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 / (2x + 1), we will use the quotient rule. The quotient rule states that if you have a function f(x) = g(x) / h(x), then the derivative f'(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (g'(x) * h(x) - g(x) * h'(x)) / (h(x))^2\n\nIn this case, g(x) = 3x^2 and h(x) = 2x + 1. First, we need to find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x):\n\ng'(x) = d(3x^2) / dx = 6x\nh'(x) = d(2x + 1) / dx = 2\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = (g'(x) * h(x) - g(x) * h'(x)) / (h(x))^2\nf'(x) = (6x * (2x + 1) - 3x^2 * 2) / (2x + 1)^2\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = (12x^2 + 6x - 6x^2) / (4x^2 + 4x + 1)\nf'(x) = (6x^2 + 6x) / (4x^2 + 4x + 1)\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 / (2x + 1) is:\n\nf'(x) = (6x^2 + 6x) / (4x^2 + 4x + 1)"
