    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student to solve in Combinatorial optimization:\n\nYou are a teacher and you have to prepare 8 multiple-choice questions for an exam. Each question has 4 options, and only one option is correct. You want to make sure that no student can answer all the questions correctly by guessing randomly. What is the minimum number of questions that you must add to the exam taking into account this constraint?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of questions that must be added to the exam to ensure that the probability of a student guessing all the questions correctly is less than 1.\n\nLet's first calculate the probability of a student guessing all 8 questions correctly. Since there are 4 options for each question, the probability of guessing one question correctly is 1/4. Therefore, the probability of guessing all 8 questions correctly is (1/4)^8 = 1/65536.\n\nNow, let's denote the number of additional questions we need to add as x. We want to find the minimum x such that the probability of guessing all (8+x) questions correctly is less than 1.\n\nThe probability of guessing all (8+x) questions correctly is (1/4)^(8+x). We want this probability to be less than 1, so:\n\n(1/4)^(8+x) < 1\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides (base 4):\n\n8+x < 0\n\nx < -8\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a negative number of questions, the minimum number of questions that must be added is 0. This means that with the current 8 questions, it is already guaranteed that no student can answer all the questions correctly by guessing randomly."
