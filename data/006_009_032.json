    "message_1": "In a population of 500 individuals, it is known that 10% have a certain medical condition. What is the probability that at least 45 individuals in a random sample of 100 individuals have this medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial\n- n is the number of trials\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 100 (the sample size)\n- p = 0.10 (the probability of having the medical condition)\n- k = 45 (the number of individuals with the medical condition)\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of having at least 45 individuals with the medical condition, so we need to calculate the probability for k = 45, 46, 47, ..., 100 and sum them up.\n\nTo calculate the probability for each k, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X >= 45) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 45 to 100\n\nP(X >= 45) = Σ [C(100, k) * (0.10)^k * (0.90)^(100-k)] for k = 45 to 100\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so we can use a cumulative binomial probability table or a statistical software to find the probability.\n\nUsing a statistical software or calculator, we find that:\n\nP(X >= 45) ≈ 0.000017\n\nSo, the probability that at least 45 individuals in a random sample of 100 individuals have this medical condition is approximately 0.000017 or 0.0017%."
