    "message_2": "The harmony search algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. It is a stochastic search algorithm that mimics the musical improvisation process where musicians search for a better state of harmony. The algorithm is not deterministic, so the results may vary in different runs. Here, I will provide a general outline of the algorithm and a possible solution.\n\n1. Initialize the problem parameters:\n   - Harmony memory size (HMS): the number of solution vectors in the harmony memory (e.g., 20)\n   - Harmony memory considering rate (HMCR): the probability of selecting a value from the harmony memory (e.g., 0.9)\n   - Pitch adjusting rate (PAR): the probability of adjusting a selected value (e.g., 0.3)\n   - Number of improvisations (NI): the maximum number of iterations (e.g., 1000)\n   - The range of x and y: [-10, 10]\n\n2. Generate the initial harmony memory (HM) by randomly creating HMS solution vectors within the given range.\n\n3. Improvise a new harmony vector (solution) as follows:\n   - For each decision variable (x and y), generate a random number between 0 and 1.\n   - If the random number is less than HMCR, select a value from the HM for that variable. Otherwise, generate a random value within the given range.\n   - If the selected value is from the HM and another random number is less than PAR, adjust the value by adding or subtracting a small random amount (e.g., within 10% of the variable's range).\n\n4. Evaluate the new harmony vector using the objective function f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy.\n\n5. Update the harmony memory:\n   - If the new harmony vector is better than the worst harmony in the HM, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony vector.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for NI iterations.\n\n7. The best harmony vector in the HM represents the approximate solution to the optimization problem.\n\nAfter running the harmony search algorithm with the given parameters, you may obtain a solution close to the global minimum. Note that the results may vary due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm. For example, you might get:\n\n- Minimum value of the function: -249.99\n- Values of x and y at the minimum point: x = 1.00, y = 2.00\n- Number of iterations: 1000\n\nKeep in mind that these results are not guaranteed, and you may need to run the algorithm multiple times or fine-tune the parameters to get a more accurate solution."
