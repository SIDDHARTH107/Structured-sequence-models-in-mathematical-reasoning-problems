    "message_1": "Suppose a company wants to minimize the cost and maximize the revenue of a product. The cost function is given by C(x) = 0.01x^2 + 2x + 500, where x is the quantity produced, and the revenue function is given by R(x) = 10x - 0.1x^2. What is the optimal quantity that the company should produce to maximize revenue while minimizing cost?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal quantity that the company should produce to maximize revenue while minimizing cost, we need to find the profit function, which is the difference between the revenue function and the cost function: P(x) = R(x) - C(x).\n\nP(x) = (10x - 0.1x^2) - (0.01x^2 + 2x + 500)\nP(x) = -0.11x^2 + 8x - 500\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. We do this by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\nP'(x) = -0.22x + 8\n\nNow, set P'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n-0.22x + 8 = 0\n-0.22x = -8\nx = 8 / 0.22\nx ≈ 36.36\n\nSince the quantity produced must be a whole number, we can consider the two closest integer values, x = 36 and x = 37.\n\nNow, we need to check the second derivative of the profit function to ensure that the critical point is a maximum:\n\nP''(x) = -0.22\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, the critical point corresponds to a maximum. Now, we need to compare the profit for x = 36 and x = 37:\n\nP(36) = -0.11(36)^2 + 8(36) - 500 ≈ 44.96\nP(37) = -0.11(37)^2 + 8(37) - 500 ≈ 44.97\n\nSince the profit is slightly higher for x = 37, the company should produce 37 units to maximize revenue while minimizing cost."
