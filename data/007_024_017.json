    "message_2": "The discrete logarithm problem is to find an integer x such that b^x ≡ a (mod p), where a, b, and p are given integers, and p is a prime number. In this case, we want to find x such that 2^x ≡ 5 (mod 17).\n\nWe can use the brute force method to find the discrete logarithm:\n\n2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\n2^3 ≡ 8 (mod 17)\n2^4 ≡ 16 (mod 17)\n2^5 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n2^6 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n2^7 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n2^8 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n2^9 ≡ 2 (mod 17) (cycle starts repeating)\n\nWe can see that none of the powers of 2 modulo 17 equal 5. This means that there is no discrete logarithm of 5 with base 2 modulo 17."
