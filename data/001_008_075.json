If he wants to spend at least $200 on the new phone, write an inequality to represent the maximum amount he can spend on a laptop. Solve the inequality and graph the solution on a number line.\"",
    "message_2": "Let x represent the amount John spends on the new phone, and y represent the amount he spends on the laptop. We are given that John has a budget of $400, so the total amount he spends on both items cannot exceed $400. This can be represented by the inequality:\n\nx + y ≤ 400\n\nWe are also given that John wants to spend at least $200 on the new phone, which can be represented by the inequality:\n\nx ≥ 200\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum amount John can spend on the laptop (y). To do this, we can substitute the lower bound of x (200) into the first inequality:\n\n200 + y ≤ 400\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny ≤ 400 - 200\ny ≤ 200\n\nSo, the maximum amount John can spend on the laptop is $200.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line, we can represent y on the number line. Since y is less than or equal to 200, we can shade the region on the number line from 200 and below, including 200. The shaded region will represent all possible amounts John can spend on the laptop."
