If yes, show the isomorphism between the two graphs. If no, explain why they are not isomorphic.",
    "message_2": "Yes, graph A and graph B are isomorphic.\n\nAn isomorphism between two graphs is a bijection (one-to-one and onto) function that preserves adjacency between vertices. In this case, we can find an isomorphism between graph A and graph B as follows:\n\nf(1) = A\nf(2) = B\nf(3) = C\nf(4) = D\nf(5) = E\n\nThis function maps each vertex in graph A to a corresponding vertex in graph B, and the adjacency between vertices is preserved. For example, vertices 1 and 2 are connected in graph A, and their corresponding vertices A and B are connected in graph B. This holds true for all the edges in both graphs. Therefore, graph A and graph B are isomorphic."
