    "message_1": "In a society of 100 individuals, each person has access to a common field in which they can graze their sheep. The societal benefit from keeping the field healthy and well-maintained is $10 per person. However, each additional sheep grazing in the field reduces the quality of the field, resulting in a societal cost of $5 per sheep per person. Each person has to decide how many sheep to graze in the field, with the aim of maximizing their personal profit. How many sheep will be grazed in total and what will be the resulting societal benefit and cost? And how many sheep should each person graze to maximize their personal profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of sheep grazed by each person. The personal profit for each person can be calculated as:\n\nPersonal profit = Societal benefit - Societal cost\nPersonal profit = 10 - 5 * x * 100\n\nTo maximize personal profit, we need to find the value of x that maximizes this equation. To do this, we can take the derivative of the personal profit equation with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Personal profit)/dx = -500x + 10 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 10/500 = 1/50\n\nSince there are 100 individuals in the society, the total number of sheep grazed in the field will be:\n\nTotal sheep = 100 * (1/50) = 2\n\nThe resulting societal benefit is:\n\nSocietal benefit = 100 * $10 = $1000\n\nThe resulting societal cost is:\n\nSocietal cost = 2 * $5 * 100 = $1000\n\nThus, each person should graze 1/50 of a sheep (which is not practically possible, but it represents the optimal grazing rate) to maximize their personal profit. In this scenario, the total number of sheep grazed is 2, and the resulting societal benefit and cost are both $1000."
