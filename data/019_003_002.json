    "message_1": "Let's consider the following situation: \n\nAt a party, there are 10 guests and a cake is served. Each guest has the option to choose one of the 3 flavors of the cake. Modal logic tells us that a proposition about the cake's flavor can be expressed as a modal formula. Suppose we define the modal operator \"Pl\" as \"at least p of the guests have chosen flavor l\". \n\nNow, let p be the proposition that \"at least 4 guests have chosen flavor A\", and q be the proposition that \"at least 5 guests have chosen flavor B\". Write a modal formula in terms of p and q that expresses the statement \"at least 2 guests have chosen flavor C\".",
    "message_2": "Let r be the proposition that \"at least 2 guests have chosen flavor C\". Since there are 10 guests in total, we can express r in terms of p and q as follows:\n\n¬(Pl(4, A) ∧ Pl(5, B))\n\nThis means that it is not the case that both at least 4 guests have chosen flavor A and at least 5 guests have chosen flavor B. In other words, if at least 2 guests have chosen flavor C, then it is not possible for both p and q to be true simultaneously."
