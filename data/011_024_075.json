The cost of shipping one unit of their product from each factory to each warehouse is given in the following table:\n\n|      | Warehouse 1 | Warehouse 2 | Warehouse 3 | Warehouse 4 | Warehouse 5 |\n|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| F1   | 4           | 3           | 7           | 5           | 9           |\n| F2   | 6           | 10          | 2           | 1           | 8           |\n| F3   | 5           | 2           | 8           | 5           | 5           |\n| F4   | 8           | 5           | 5           | 7           | 2           |\n| F5   | 7           | 6           | 8           | 9           | 3           |\n\nThe company wants to know how many units of product should be shipped from each factory to each warehouse in order to minimize their shipping costs while meeting the demands of each warehouse. The demand for each warehouse is as follows:\n\n- Warehouse 1: 400 units\n- Warehouse 2: 300 units\n- Warehouse 3: 500 units\n- Warehouse 4: 200 units\n- Warehouse 5: 600 units\n\nWhat is the minimum cost of shipping the required products to each warehouse from each factory?",
