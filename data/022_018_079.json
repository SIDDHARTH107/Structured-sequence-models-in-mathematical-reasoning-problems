    "message_2": "To determine if the given function u(x, y) = e^(2x)cos(3y) satisfies the partial differential equation u_xx + u_yy = 0, we need to compute the second partial derivatives of u with respect to x and y, and then check if their sum is equal to 0.\n\nFirst, let's find the first partial derivatives of u with respect to x and y:\n\nu_x = ∂u/∂x = 2e^(2x)cos(3y)\nu_y = ∂u/∂y = -3e^(2x)sin(3y)\n\nNow, let's find the second partial derivatives:\n\nu_xx = ∂²u/∂x² = 4e^(2x)cos(3y)\nu_yy = ∂²u/∂y² = -9e^(2x)cos(3y)\n\nNow, let's check if the sum of u_xx and u_yy is equal to 0:\n\nu_xx + u_yy = 4e^(2x)cos(3y) - 9e^(2x)cos(3y) = -5e^(2x)cos(3y)\n\nSince u_xx + u_yy is not equal to 0, the function u(x, y) = e^(2x)cos(3y) does not satisfy the given partial differential equation u_xx + u_yy = 0."
