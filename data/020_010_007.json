    "message_1": "A food processing company needs to decide how much of two ingredients A and B to use in a recipe for a new product. Ingredient A costs $0.50 per pound and ingredient B costs $0.80 per pound. The company wants to have at least 500 pounds of the new product and at most 1500 pounds of the new product. Also, they want to make sure that each pound of new product has at least 25 grams of protein and at most 40 grams of fat. Ingredient A contains 4 grams of protein and 3 grams of fat per pound, while ingredient B contains 3 grams of protein and 5 grams of fat per pound. How many pounds of each ingredient should the company use to minimize the total cost?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of pounds of ingredient A and y be the number of pounds of ingredient B. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y >= 500 (total weight of the new product must be at least 500 pounds)\n2. x + y <= 1500 (total weight of the new product must be at most 1500 pounds)\n3. 4x + 3y >= 25(x + y) (protein constraint: at least 25 grams of protein per pound)\n4. 3x + 5y <= 40(x + y) (fat constraint: at most 40 grams of fat per pound)\n\nThe objective function to minimize is the total cost: C = 0.5x + 0.8y.\n\nFirst, we need to simplify constraints 3 and 4:\n\n3. 4x + 3y >= 25x + 25y => 21x >= 22y\n4. 3x + 5y <= 40x + 40y => 37x >= 35y\n\nNow we can find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. y >= 500 - x\n2. y <= 1500 - x\n3. y >= (21/22)x\n4. y <= (37/35)x\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 500), (500, 0), (A_x, A_y), and (B_x, B_y), where (A_x, A_y) is the intersection of y = (21/22)x and y = 1500 - x, and (B_x, B_y) is the intersection of y = (37/35)x and y = 500 - x.\n\nTo find (A_x, A_y), we solve the system of equations:\n\nA_y = (21/22)A_x\nA_y = 1500 - A_x\n\n(21/22)A_x = 1500 - A_x\nA_x = 660\nA_y = 1500 - 660 = 840\n\nTo find (B_x, B_y), we solve the system of equations:\n\nB_y = (37/35)B_x\nB_y = 500 - B_x\n\n(37/35)B_x = 500 - B_x\nB_x = 175\nB_y = 500 - 175 = 325\n\nNow we evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nC(0, 500) = 0.5(0) + 0.8(500) = $400\nC(500, 0) = 0.5(500) + 0.8(0) = $250\nC(660, 840) = 0.5(660) + 0.8(840) = $924\nC(175, 325) = 0.5(175) + 0.8(325) = $335\n\nThe minimum cost is $250, which occurs when the company uses 500 pounds of ingredient A and 0 pounds of ingredient B."
