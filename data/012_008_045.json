    "message_2": "To determine if a graph is planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs, which states that for a connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (including the outer face).\n\nWe are given a graph with 9 vertices (V = 9) and 13 edges (E = 13). We can use the inequality derived from Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for V and E:\n\n13 ≤ 3(9) - 6\n13 ≤ 27 - 6\n13 ≤ 21\n\nSince the inequality holds true, it is possible that the graph is planar. However, this inequality is not a guarantee that the graph is planar, so we need to check further.\n\nAnother necessary condition for a graph to be planar is that it must not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 3+3 vertices). If the graph contains either of these subgraphs, it is non-planar.\n\nWithout more information about the specific graph, we cannot definitively say whether it is planar or not. However, based on the inequality derived from Euler's formula, it is possible that the graph is planar. To determine planarity, we would need more information about the graph's structure and the presence or absence of K5 or K3,3 subgraphs."
