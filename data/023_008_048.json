    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the function f(x) = x(2-x) in the interval [0,2], we first need to determine the Fourier series expansion of the function. The Fourier series expansion of a function f(x) in the interval [0, L] is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and L is the length of the interval.\n\nIn this case, L = 2, so the Fourier series expansion is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx/2) + b_n * sin(nπx/2)]\n\nTo find the Fourier coefficients, we use the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) dx] from 0 to L\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/2) * ∫[x(2-x) dx] from 0 to 2\na_0 = (1/2) * [(x^2 - (x^3)/3) from 0 to 2]\na_0 = (1/2) * [(4 - (8/3)) - (0 - 0)]\na_0 = (1/2) * (4/3)\na_0 = 2/3\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1) * ∫[x(2-x) * cos(nπx/2) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nIntegration by parts is required here. Let u = x(2-x) and dv = cos(nπx/2) dx. Then du = (2-2x) dx and v = (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2).\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\na_n = (1) * [(2/nπ) * x(2-x) * sin(nπx/2)] from 0 to 2 - (1) * ∫[(2/nπ) * (2-2x) * sin(nπx/2) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nThe first term evaluates to 0 because sin(0) = sin(nπ) = 0. So we only need to evaluate the second term:\n\na_n = - (2/nπ) * ∫[(2-2x) * sin(nπx/2) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nAgain, we need to use integration by parts. Let u = (2-2x) and dv = sin(nπx/2) dx. Then du = -2 dx and v = -(4/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx/2).\n\na_n = - (2/nπ) * [-(4/n^2π^2) * (2-2x) * cos(nπx/2)] from 0 to 2 + (2/nπ) * ∫[-(4/n^2π^2) * (-2) * cos(nπx/2) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nThe first term evaluates to 0 because cos(0) = 1 and cos(nπ) = (-1)^n. So we only need to evaluate the second term:\n\na_n = (8/n^3π^3) * ∫[cos(nπx/2) dx] from 0 to 2\na_n = (8/n^3π^3) * [(2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)] from 0 to 2\na_n = (16/n^4π^4) * [sin(nπ) - sin(0)]\na_n = 0 (since sin(nπ) = 0)\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1) * ∫[x(2-x) * sin(nπx/2) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nUsing the same integration by parts method as before:\n\nb_n = (2/nπ) * [x(2-x) * cos(nπx/2)] from 0 to 2 - (2/nπ) * ∫[(2-2x) * cos(nπx/2) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nThe first term evaluates to 0 because cos(0) = 1 and cos(nπ) = (-1)^n. So we only need to evaluate the second term:\n\nb_n = - (2/nπ) * ∫[(2-2x) * cos(nπx/2) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nUsing the same integration by parts method as before:\n\nb_n = - (2/nπ) * [-(4/n^2π^2) * (2-2x) * sin(nπx/2)] from 0 to 2 + (2/nπ) * ∫[-(4/n^2π^2) * (-2) * sin(nπx/2) dx] from 0 to 2\n\nThe second term evaluates to 0 because sin(0) = sin(nπ) = 0. So we only need to evaluate the first term:\n\nb_n = (8/n^3π^3) * [sin(nπ) - sin(0)]\nb_n = 0 (since sin(nπ) = 0)\n\nSo, the Fourier series expansion of the function f(x) = x(2-x) in the interval [0,2] is:\n\nf(x) = 2/3\n\nSince all the coefficients a_n and b_n are 0, there are no cosine or sine terms in the expansion."
