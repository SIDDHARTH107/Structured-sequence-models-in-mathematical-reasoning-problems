    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal, and its perimeter increases with each iteration (order). To calculate the perimeter of a Vicsek fractal of order 4, we can use the following formula:\n\nPerimeter = P₀ * (N ^ (order))\n\nwhere P₀ is the initial perimeter (in this case, 4 units), N is the scaling factor (in this case, 3, as each segment is divided into 3 smaller segments), and the order is 4.\n\nPerimeter = 4 * (3 ^ 4)\nPerimeter = 4 * 81\nPerimeter = 324 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of a Vicsek fractal of order 4, where each segment has a length of 1 unit, is 324 units."
