    "message_1": "Suppose there are two players A and B in a Dictator Game with resources worth $100. Player A is given the complete control over the resources distribution and can choose to keep any amount between $0 and $100 for himself/herself, and give the rest to player B. If player B accepts the offered amount, both players get to keep their share, but if player B rejects, neither player gets anything. If player B has a minimum acceptable payoff of $30, what is the maximum amount that player A can keep for himself/herself, such that player B still accepts the offer?",
    "message_2": "If player B has a minimum acceptable payoff of $30, then player A must offer at least $30 to player B in order for player B to accept the offer. In this case, the maximum amount that player A can keep for himself/herself is $100 - $30 = $70."
