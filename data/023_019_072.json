    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system, we first need to find the characteristic equation of the homogeneous part of the differential equation, which is:\n\ny'' + 2y' + 5y = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 + 2r + 5 = 0\n\nNow, we find the roots of this equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nr = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nr = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4(1)(5))) / 2(1)\n\nr = (-2 ± √(-16)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex:\n\nr = -1 ± 2i\n\nSince the real part of the roots is negative, the homogeneous part of the system is stable.\n\nNow, let's find the particular solution using the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of the given differential equation is:\n\nY(s) * (s^2 + 2s + 5) = F(s)\n\nwhere Y(s) is the Fourier transform of y(t) and F(s) is the Fourier transform of f(t).\n\nThe Fourier series of f(t) is already given:\n\nf(t) = 3 + 2cos(t) + 4sin(2t) - 3cos(3t) - sin(4t)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of f(t), we get:\n\nF(s) = 3δ(s) + [δ(s-1) + δ(s+1)] + 2[δ(s-2) - δ(s+2)] - 3/2[δ(s-3) + δ(s+3)] - 1/2[δ(s-4) + δ(s+4)]\n\nNow, we can find Y(s) by dividing F(s) by (s^2 + 2s + 5):\n\nY(s) = F(s) / (s^2 + 2s + 5)\n\nNow, we take the inverse Fourier transform of Y(s) to find the particular solution y_p(t):\n\ny_p(t) = 3 + 2cos(t) + 4sin(2t) - 3cos(3t) - sin(4t)\n\nThe general solution of the system is the sum of the homogeneous solution and the particular solution:\n\ny(t) = C1 * e^(-t) * cos(2t) + C2 * e^(-t) * sin(2t) + y_p(t)\n\nSince the homogeneous part of the system is stable, the overall system is stable as well."
