    "message_2": "To find the distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30, we first note that 30 = 2 * 3 * 5, which are all prime numbers. By the Sylow theorems, we can analyze the possible Sylow subgroups for each of these prime factors.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: There is either one or fifteen 2-subgroups of order 2. If there is only one, it must be normal.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: There is either one or ten 3-subgroups of order 3. If there is only one, it must be normal.\n\n3. Sylow 5-subgroups: There is either one or six 5-subgroups of order 5. If there is only one, it must be normal.\n\nNow, we consider the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: All Sylow subgroups are normal. In this case, the group is the direct product of the Sylow subgroups, which gives us the cyclic group C30 (since 2, 3, and 5 are pairwise coprime).\n\nCase 2: Only the Sylow 2-subgroup is not normal. In this case, the group cannot be abelian, as the Sylow 3-subgroup and Sylow 5-subgroup would commute with all elements. However, we know that the group must have a normal 3-subgroup and a normal 5-subgroup, so the group is a semidirect product of these two subgroups. This gives us the dihedral group D15, which is the semidirect product of C3 and C5.\n\nCase 3: Only the Sylow 3-subgroup is not normal. This case is symmetric to Case 2, and we again obtain the dihedral group D15.\n\nCase 4: Only the Sylow 5-subgroup is not normal. This case is symmetric to Case 2 and Case 3, and we again obtain the dihedral group D15.\n\nCase 5: None of the Sylow subgroups are normal. In this case, the group is non-abelian, as it contains non-normal subgroups. The group must have a non-normal 2-subgroup, a non-normal 3-subgroup, and a non-normal 5-subgroup. This gives us a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nThus, there are three distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30: the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, and the non-abelian group of order 30."
