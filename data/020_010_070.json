    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from product A is $10 per unit and the profit from product B is $15 per unit. Each production run of product A requires 1 unit of resource X and 2 units of resource Y, whereas each production run of product B requires 3 units of resource X and 1 unit of resource Y. The maximum available quantities of resources X and Y are 100 and 80 units, respectively. \n\nThe company wants to determine how many units of each product to produce in order to maximize their total profit, while also ensuring that they do not exceed the available resources. However, due to the uncertainty in the availability of resources, the company wants to use a robust optimization strategy.\n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of each product to produce using a robust optimization strategy, and what is the maximum profit that the company can earn?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using a robust optimization strategy, we will first set up the linear programming problem and then find the optimal solution.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize the total profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n1x + 3y ≤ 100 (resource X constraint)\n2x + 1y ≤ 80 (resource Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nNow, we will graph the feasible region and find the optimal solution.\n\n1. Solve the constraints for y:\ny ≤ (100 - x) / 3\ny ≤ 80 - 2x\n\n2. Plot the constraints on a graph:\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied.\n\n3. Identify the corner points of the feasible region:\n(0, 0), (0, 33.33), (40, 0), and (20, 26.67)\n\n4. Evaluate the objective function at each corner point:\n(0, 0): Profit = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n(0, 33.33): Profit = 10(0) + 15(33.33) = $499.95\n(40, 0): Profit = 10(40) + 15(0) = $400\n(20, 26.67): Profit = 10(20) + 15(26.67) = $800\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the corner point (20, 26.67), where the company should produce 20 units of product A and approximately 27 units of product B. The maximum profit that the company can earn using a robust optimization strategy is $800."
