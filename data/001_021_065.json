    "message_2": "To solve the cubic equation x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0, we can first try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (-6) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (1).\n\nFactors of -6 are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6. Since the leading coefficient is 1, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6. We can test these values to see if any of them are roots:\n\n1. f(1) = (1)^3 + 2(1)^2 - 5(1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 5 - 6 ≠ 0\n2. f(-1) = (-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 - 5(-1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 5 - 6 ≠ 0\n3. f(2) = (2)^3 + 2(2)^2 - 5(2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 10 - 6 ≠ 0\n4. f(-2) = (-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 - 5(-2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 10 - 6 = 0\n\nSo, x = -2 is a root of the equation. Now we can perform synthetic division or polynomial long division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6) / (x + 2) = x^2 - 5\n\nNow we have a quadratic equation x^2 - 5 = 0. To solve this equation, we can add 5 to both sides and then take the square root:\n\nx^2 = 5\nx = ±√5\n\nSo, the three solutions to the equation x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0 are x = -2, x = √5, and x = -√5."
