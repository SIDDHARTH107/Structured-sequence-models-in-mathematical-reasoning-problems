    "message_1": "Consider the following two-dimensional heat conduction problem on a square domain $\\Omega$ with sides of length $L$: \n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} = 0,$$\n\nwhere $T(x,y)$ denotes the temperature at the point $(x,y)$ and the boundary conditions are given by\n\n$$T(x,0) = T(x,L) = T(0,y) = T(L,y) = 0,$$\n\nand the initial condition is\n\n$$T(x,y,0) = xy(1-x)(1-y).$$\n\nUsing finite element methods, find the numerical solution for $T(x,y,t)$ at $t=0.1$ with $L = 1$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using finite element methods, we first need to discretize the domain and approximate the solution using basis functions. We will use a simple linear triangular element for this problem.\n\n1. Discretize the domain: Divide the square domain into smaller triangles. For simplicity, let's use a uniform grid with 10 divisions along each side, resulting in 100 squares, each divided into two triangles (200 triangles in total).\n\n2. Define basis functions: We will use linear triangular elements, so the basis functions are linear functions of x and y. For each triangle, we have three nodes, and the basis functions are defined such that they are equal to 1 at one node and 0 at the other two nodes.\n\n3. Formulate the weak form of the problem: Multiply the governing equation by a test function and integrate over the domain. This will result in a system of linear equations in the form of $Ku = f$, where $K$ is the stiffness matrix, $u$ is the vector of unknown coefficients, and $f$ is the force vector.\n\n4. Assemble the global stiffness matrix and force vector: For each triangle, compute the local stiffness matrix and force vector, and then assemble them into the global stiffness matrix and force vector.\n\n5. Apply boundary conditions: Since the boundary conditions are homogeneous (T = 0 on the boundaries), we can simply remove the rows and columns corresponding to the boundary nodes from the stiffness matrix and force vector.\n\n6. Solve the linear system: Solve the reduced linear system for the unknown coefficients.\n\n7. Compute the solution at t = 0.1: Since the problem is steady-state (no time dependence), the solution does not change with time. Therefore, the solution at t = 0.1 is the same as the solution at t = 0.\n\n8. Post-process the results: Use the computed coefficients to evaluate the temperature at any point in the domain.\n\nNote that this is a high-level description of the finite element method for this problem. To actually compute the numerical solution, you would need to implement these steps in a programming language or use a finite element software package."
