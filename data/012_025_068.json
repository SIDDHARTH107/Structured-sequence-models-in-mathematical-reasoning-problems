    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph G has a Hamiltonian cycle, we can use Dirac's theorem, which states that a graph with n vertices (n ≥ 3) has a Hamiltonian cycle if the degree of each vertex is at least n/2.\n\nIn our case, the graph G has 6 vertices, so according to Dirac's theorem, each vertex must have a degree of at least 6/2 = 3.\n\nSince the graph has 10 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 10 = 20. This means that the average degree of a vertex in the graph is 20/6 ≈ 3.33. Since the average degree is greater than 3, it is possible for each vertex to have a degree of at least 3.\n\nHowever, this does not guarantee the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle. To find a Hamiltonian cycle, we can try to construct one.\n\nLet's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F. We can construct a graph with the following edges:\n\n1. A-B\n2. A-C\n3. A-D\n4. B-C\n5. B-E\n6. C-F\n7. D-E\n8. D-F\n9. E-F\n10. B-D\n\nNow, we can find a Hamiltonian cycle in this graph: A-B-C-F-D-E-A.\n\nIn conclusion, the graph G with 6 vertices and 10 edges can have a Hamiltonian cycle, and one example of such a cycle is A-B-C-F-D-E-A."
