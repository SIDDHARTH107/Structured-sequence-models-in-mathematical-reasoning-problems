    "message_1": "A company that produces light bulbs claims that their bulbs have an average lifespan of 1000 hours with a standard deviation of 100 hours. A sample of 25 bulbs is selected and tested for their lifespans. Using Bayesian statistics, if the sample mean is found to be 1050 hours, what is the probability that the true mean lifespan of the bulbs is at least 1020 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Bayesian statistics, we need to find the posterior distribution of the true mean lifespan given the sample mean. We'll assume a normal distribution for the prior distribution of the true mean lifespan and the likelihood function.\n\nLet μ be the true mean lifespan of the bulbs. The prior distribution of μ is given by:\n\nP(μ) = N(1000, 100^2)\n\nThe likelihood function, given the sample mean (x̄) and sample size (n), is:\n\nP(x̄ | μ) = N(μ, (100^2)/25)\n\nNow, we can find the posterior distribution using Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(μ | x̄) ∝ P(x̄ | μ) * P(μ)\n\nSince both the prior and likelihood are normal distributions, the posterior distribution will also be a normal distribution. The posterior mean (μ_post) and variance (σ_post^2) can be calculated as follows:\n\nμ_post = (σ_likelihood^2 * μ_prior + σ_prior^2 * x̄) / (σ_likelihood^2 + σ_prior^2)\nσ_post^2 = (σ_likelihood^2 * σ_prior^2) / (σ_likelihood^2 + σ_prior^2)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nμ_post = (100^2 * 1000 + (100^2/25) * 1050) / (100^2 + (100^2/25))\nμ_post = (10000 * 1000 + 10000/25 * 1050) / (10000 + 10000/25)\nμ_post = (10000000 + 420000) / (10000 + 400)\nμ_post = 10420000 / 10400\nμ_post = 1002\n\nσ_post^2 = (100^2 * (100^2/25)) / (100^2 + (100^2/25))\nσ_post^2 = (10000 * 400) / (10000 + 400)\nσ_post^2 = 4000000 / 10400\nσ_post^2 = 384.62\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the true mean lifespan is at least 1020 hours:\n\nP(μ ≥ 1020 | x̄) = 1 - P(μ < 1020 | x̄)\n\nTo find P(μ < 1020 | x̄), we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution with mean 1002 and variance 384.62:\n\nP(μ < 1020 | x̄) = Φ((1020 - 1002) / sqrt(384.62))\nP(μ < 1020 | x̄) = Φ(0.92)\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n\nΦ(0.92) ≈ 0.8212\n\nNow, we can find the probability that the true mean lifespan is at least 1020 hours:\n\nP(μ ≥ 1020 | x̄) = 1 - 0.8212\nP(μ ≥ 1020 | x̄) ≈ 0.1788\n\nSo, there is approximately a 17.88% probability that the true mean lifespan of the bulbs is at least 1020 hours given the sample mean of 1050 hours."
