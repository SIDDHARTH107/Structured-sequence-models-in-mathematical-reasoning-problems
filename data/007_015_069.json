    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. To find the smallest possible value of p, we can start by testing the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\n2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\n\n3 is a prime number, so the smallest possible value of p in the expression 2^p - 1 to make it a Mersenne prime is p = 2."
