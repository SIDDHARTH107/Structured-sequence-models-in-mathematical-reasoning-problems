    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors, we use the following formula:\n\nC = A x B = <AyBz - AzBy, AzBx - AxBz, AxBy - AyBx>\n\nwhere A = <Ax, Ay, Az> and B = <Bx, By, Bz>.\n\nGiven vector A = <2, 3, 4> and vector B = <5, 6, 7>, we can find the cross product as follows:\n\nC = A x B = <(3 * 7) - (4 * 6), (4 * 5) - (2 * 7), (2 * 6) - (3 * 5)>\nC = <(21 - 24), (20 - 14), (12 - 15)>\nC = <-3, 6, -3>\n\nSo, the cross product of vector A and vector B is <-3, 6, -3>."
