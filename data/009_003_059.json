    "message_1": "Consider a one-dimensional rod of length 1 meter, where the temperature varies only along the length of the rod. At time t = 0, the temperature distribution on the rod is given by T(x,0) = sin(πx) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. The ends of the rod are maintained at a constant temperature of 0°C. \n\nIf the thermal diffusivity of the rod is 0.1 sq. meter per second, find the temperature distribution in the rod at time t = 1 second.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat (or variation in temperature) in a given region over time. In one dimension, the heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature distribution along the rod, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x and t are the spatial and time variables, respectively.\n\nGiven the initial condition T(x,0) = sin(πx) and the boundary conditions T(0,t) = T(1,t) = 0, we can solve the heat equation using separation of variables and Fourier series.\n\nLet T(x,t) = X(x)T(t). Then, the heat equation becomes:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = α X''(x)T(t)\n\nDivide both sides by αXT:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = α X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ²\nα X''(x) / X(x) = -λ²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) T'(t) = -λ²T(t)\n2) α X''(x) = -λ²X(x)\n\nSolve the second equation:\n\nX''(x) = -(λ²/α)X(x)\n\nThe general solution for this equation is:\n\nX(x) = A sin(λx) + B cos(λx)\n\nApply the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0 (since the temperature at x=0 is 0)\nX(1) = A sin(λ) = 0 (since the temperature at x=1 is 0)\n\nSince A sin(λ) = 0, and A cannot be 0 (otherwise the solution would be trivial), sin(λ) must be 0. Therefore, λ = nπ, where n is an integer.\n\nNow, the solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A sin(nπx)\n\nSolve the first equation:\n\nT'(t) = -λ²T(t) = -n²π²T(t)\n\nThe general solution for this equation is:\n\nT(t) = C exp(-n²π²t)\n\nNow, the general solution for T(x,t) is:\n\nT(x,t) = ∑[A_n sin(nπx) exp(-n²π²t)]\n\nApply the initial condition T(x,0) = sin(πx):\n\nsin(πx) = ∑[A_n sin(nπx)]\n\nComparing the coefficients, we have:\n\nA_1 = 1 and A_n = 0 for n ≠ 1\n\nSo, the solution for T(x,t) is:\n\nT(x,t) = sin(πx) exp(-π²t)\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution at t = 1 second:\n\nT(x,1) = sin(πx) exp(-π²)\n\nThis is the temperature distribution along the rod at t = 1 second."
