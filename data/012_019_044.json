    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. In this case, the graph G is as follows:\n\n```\n    A ---- B\n    |      | \\\n    |      |  D\n    |      | /  \n    C ---- E\n```\n\nTo determine the chromatic index, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph. In this case, the maximum degree is 3 (vertex B).\n\n2. Apply Vizing's theorem, which states that the chromatic index of a graph is either equal to the maximum degree (Δ) or Δ + 1. In this case, the chromatic index is either 3 or 4.\n\n3. Attempt to color the edges using the minimum number of colors (Δ). If it is not possible, use Δ + 1 colors.\n\nLet's try to color the edges using 3 colors:\n\n```\nColor 1: A-B, B-D\nColor 2: A-C, B-E\nColor 3: C-E, D-E\n```\n\nThe graph can be colored using 3 colors without any adjacent edges sharing the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index of the graph G is 3."
