    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the third equation to get rid of the fractions:\n\nx - (1/2)y + (1/4)z = 4/3\n\nMultiply the entire equation by 4 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n4x - 2y + z = 16/3\n\nNow our system of linear equations is:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 7\n2x - 4y + 3z = -12\n4x - 2y + z = 16/3\n\nNext, perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third equations.\n\nTo eliminate x from the second equation, multiply the first equation by -2/3 and add it to the second equation:\n\n(-2/3)(3x + 2y - z) = (-2/3)(7)\n-2x - (4/3)y + (2/3)z = -14/3\n\nNow add this to the second equation:\n\n(2x - 4y + 3z) + (-2x - (4/3)y + (2/3)z) = -12 + (-14/3)\n(-8/3)y + (8/3)z = -50/3\n\nTo eliminate x from the third equation, multiply the first equation by -4/3 and add it to the third equation:\n\n(-4/3)(3x + 2y - z) = (-4/3)(7)\n-4x - (8/3)y + (4/3)z = -28/3\n\nNow add this to the third equation:\n\n(4x - 2y + z) + (-4x - (8/3)y + (4/3)z) = 16/3 + (-28/3)\n(-2/3)y + (7/3)z = -12/3\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third equation.\n\nTo eliminate y from the third equation, multiply the second equation by (2/3)/(8/3) and add it to the third equation:\n\n(3/4)(-8/3)y + (8/3)z = (3/4)(-50/3)\n-2y + 3z = -25\n\nNow add this to the third equation:\n\n(-2/3)y + (7/3)z + (-2y + 3z) = -12/3 + (-25)\n(-8/3)y + (15/3)z = -37/3\n\nNow we have:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 7\n-8/3y + 8/3z = -50/3\n-8/3y + 15/3z = -37/3\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nAdd the second and third equations:\n\n-8/3y + 8/3z + (-8/3y + 15/3z) = -50/3 + (-37/3)\n7z = -87/3\n\nNow divide by 7:\n\nz = -87/21\nz = -29/7\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nSubstitute z back into the second equation:\n\n-8/3y + 8/3(-29/7) = -50/3\n-8/3y - 232/7 = -50/3\n\nMultiply by 3 to eliminate fractions:\n\n-8y - 696/7 = -50\n-8y = 646/7\ny = -323/14\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nSubstitute y and z back into the first equation:\n\n3x + 2(-323/14) - (-29/7) = 7\n3x - 646/14 + 29/7 = 7\n\nMultiply by 14 to eliminate fractions:\n\n3x - 646 + 58 = 98\n3x = 696\nx = 232\n\nSo the solution is x = 232, y = -323/14, and z = -29/7."
