    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, there are 4 players who each contribute an amount of money towards a goal. The goal is to reach $100 in total contributions, which will benefit all players equally. Each player receives a benefit equal to the average contribution, regardless of how much they contributed. However, any money not contributed by the players is lost and does not go towards the goal.\n\nIf Player 1 contributes $30, Player 2 contributes $20, and Player 3 contributes $10, how much must Player 4 contribute in order to reach the goal of $100?",
    "message_2": "To reach the goal of $100, we need to find out how much more is needed after the contributions of Player 1, Player 2, and Player 3.\n\nPlayer 1 contributes $30, Player 2 contributes $20, and Player 3 contributes $10. So, the total contribution so far is:\n\n$30 + $20 + $10 = $60\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more is needed to reach the goal of $100:\n\n$100 - $60 = $40\n\nTherefore, Player 4 must contribute $40 in order to reach the goal of $100."
