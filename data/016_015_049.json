    "message_2": "To find the number of times a Hilbert curve crosses the diagonal of an n x n grid, we need to consider the order of the curve. The order of a Hilbert curve is the number of times it is recursively constructed. For an n x n grid, the order of the Hilbert curve is given by log2(n).\n\nFor example, for a 4 x 4 grid, the order of the Hilbert curve is log2(4) = 2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the number of times the Hilbert curve crosses the diagonal for different orders:\n\n- Order 1: The curve does not cross the diagonal.\n- Order 2: The curve crosses the diagonal 1 time.\n- Order 3: The curve crosses the diagonal 5 times.\n- Order 4: The curve crosses the diagonal 21 times.\n\nFrom these observations, we can see a pattern emerging. The number of times the Hilbert curve crosses the diagonal for a given order is given by the formula:\n\ncrossings = (4^(order - 1) - 1) / 3\n\nSo, for an n x n grid, the number of times the Hilbert curve crosses the diagonal is given by:\n\ncrossings = (4^(log2(n) - 1) - 1) / 3\n\nFor example, for a 4 x 4 grid (order 2):\n\ncrossings = (4^(2 - 1) - 1) / 3 = (4 - 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1\n\nSo, the Hilbert curve crosses the diagonal 1 time in a 4 x 4 grid."
