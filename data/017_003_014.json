    "message_2": "A generator of a group of prime order 23 is an element that, when raised to successive powers, generates all the non-identity elements of the group. In other words, if g is a generator of a group G of order 23, then the set {g^1, g^2, ..., g^22} contains all the non-identity elements of G.\n\nTo find a generator, we can consider the multiplicative group of integers modulo 23, denoted as (Z/23Z)^*. This group has order 22, since there are 22 elements that are relatively prime to 23 (i.e., 1, 2, 3, ..., 22).\n\nNow, we need to find an element g in (Z/23Z)^* such that g^k (mod 23) generates all the non-identity elements for k = 1, 2, ..., 22. We can start by checking the smallest non-identity element, which is 2:\n\n2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 23)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 23)\n2^3 ≡ 8 (mod 23)\n...\n2^11 ≡ 1 (mod 23)\n\nSince 2^11 ≡ 1 (mod 23), 2 is not a generator of the group, as it does not generate all non-identity elements. We can continue checking other elements:\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 23)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 23)\n3^3 ≡ 4 (mod 23)\n...\n3^22 ≡ 1 (mod 23)\n\nIn this case, the powers of 3 generate all the non-identity elements of the group (Z/23Z)^*. Therefore, 3 is a generator of a group of prime order 23. Note that there may be other generators as well, but 3 is the smallest one."
