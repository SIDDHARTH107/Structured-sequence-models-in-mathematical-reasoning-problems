    "message_2": "To determine whether X is connected, path-connected, or both, we first need to understand the definitions of connected and path-connected.\n\nA topological space X is said to be connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. In other words, X is connected if there are no two non-empty open sets A and B such that X = A ∪ B and A ∩ B = ∅.\n\nA topological space X is said to be path-connected if for any two points x, y ∈ X, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y. In other words, there is a continuous path between any two points in X.\n\nNow let's analyze the given set X = [-2, 2] ∪ [-1, 1] ∪ {3}.\n\nFirst, we can see that X is not connected. To see this, consider the open sets A = (-∞, 2.5) and B = (2.5, ∞). Then, X = (A ∩ X) ∪ (B ∩ X), and (A ∩ X) ∩ (B ∩ X) = ∅. Since we found two disjoint non-empty open sets whose union is X, X is not connected.\n\nNow let's check if X is path-connected. Consider two points x, y ∈ X. If both x and y are in [-2, 2] or both are in [-1, 1], then there is a continuous path between them, as both intervals are path-connected. If x ∈ [-2, 2] and y = 3, we can define a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X as follows:\n\nf(t) = { (1-t)x + 2t, if 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2\n         2(1-t) + 3t, if 1/2 < t ≤ 1 }\n\nThis function is continuous, and f(0) = x, f(1) = y. Similarly, if x ∈ [-1, 1] and y = 3, we can define a continuous function g: [0, 1] → X as follows:\n\ng(t) = { (1-t)x + t, if 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2\n         (1-t) + 3t, if 1/2 < t ≤ 1 }\n\nThis function is also continuous, and g(0) = x, g(1) = y. Thus, X is path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, the given set X = [-2, 2] ∪ [-1, 1] ∪ {3} is not connected but is path-connected."
