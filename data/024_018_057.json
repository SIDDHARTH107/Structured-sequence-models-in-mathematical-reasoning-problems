    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms. Let's start by finding the tangent vectors.\n\nThe tangent vectors are the partial derivatives of the position vector with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = ∂(x, y, z)/∂u = (cos(v), sin(v), 1/u)\nr_v = ∂(x, y, z)/∂v = (-usin(v), ucos(v), 0)\n\nNow, let's compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = (cos(v))^2 + (sin(v))^2 + (1/u)^2\nF = r_u • r_v = -ucos(v)sin(v) + usin(v)cos(v) = 0 (since they are orthogonal)\nG = r_v • r_v = (usin(v))^2 + (ucos(v))^2 = u^2\n\nNow, let's compute the second fundamental form coefficients. First, we need to find the unit normal vector N:\n\nN = r_u x r_v / ||r_u x r_v||\n\nr_u x r_v = (sin(v)/u, -cos(v)/u, u)\n\n||r_u x r_v|| = sqrt((sin(v)/u)^2 + (-cos(v)/u)^2 + u^2) = sqrt(1/u^2 + u^2)\n\nN = (sin(v)/(u*sqrt(1/u^2 + u^2)), -cos(v)/(u*sqrt(1/u^2 + u^2)), u/sqrt(1/u^2 + u^2))\n\nNow, we can compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = N • ∂^2(x, y, z)/∂u^2 = N • (-cos(v), -sin(v), -1/u^2)\nM = N • ∂^2(x, y, z)/∂u∂v = N • (sin(v), -cos(v), 0)\nN = N • ∂^2(x, y, z)/∂v^2 = N • (-ucos(v), -usin(v), 0)\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\nH = (LE + GN - 2FM) / 2(EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (u=1, v=π/4), we have:\n\nE = 2\nF = 0\nG = 1\nL = -1/sqrt(2)\nM = 0\nN = -1/sqrt(2)\n\nK = (-1/sqrt(2) * -1/sqrt(2)) / (2 * 1) = 1/2\nH = (-1/sqrt(2) + -1/sqrt(2)) / 4 = -1/sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the sectional curvature of the surface at the point (u=1, v=π/4) is K = 1/2."
