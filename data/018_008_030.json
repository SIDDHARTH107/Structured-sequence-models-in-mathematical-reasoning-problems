    "message_2": "A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. To find A × B, we will list all the possible ordered pairs with the first element from set A and the second element from set B:\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find B × A. This is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A. We will list all the possible ordered pairs with the first element from set B and the second element from set A:\n\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, A × B and B × A are not equal because the ordered pairs in each set are different. The elements in A × B have the first element from set A and the second element from set B, while the elements in B × A have the first element from set B and the second element from set A."
