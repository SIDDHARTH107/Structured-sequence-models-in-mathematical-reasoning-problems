    "message_2": "We can use the Poisson distribution to solve this problem. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, accidents) occurring in a fixed interval of time (in this case, weeks) given a known average rate (in this case, 2 accidents per week).\n\nThe probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (accidents), k is the specific number of events we are interested in (0 accidents in this case), λ is the average rate of events (2 accidents per week), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nWe want to find the probability of having no accidents (k = 0) in the next 3 weeks. Since we have an average of 2 accidents per week, the average rate for 3 weeks is λ = 2 * 3 = 6 accidents.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-6) * 6^0) / 0!\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-6) * 1) / 1\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ (0.00247875 * 1) / 1\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.00247875\n\nSo, the probability of having no accidents in the next 3 weeks is approximately 0.00247875, or 0.247875%."
