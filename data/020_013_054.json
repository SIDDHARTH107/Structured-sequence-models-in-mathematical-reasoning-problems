    "message_2": "To solve this problem using semi-definite programming, we can first rewrite the objective function and constraint in matrix form.\n\nLet's define the following matrices:\n\nX = [x, y]^T (column vector)\nQ = [0, -1/2; -1/2, 0] (symmetric matrix)\nA = [1, 0; 0, 1] (identity matrix)\nb = 4 (scalar)\n\nNow, the objective function can be written as:\n\nf(X) = -X^T * Q * X\n\nAnd the constraint can be written as:\n\nX^T * A * X ≤ b\n\nNow, we can set up the semi-definite programming problem:\n\nMinimize: -X^T * Q * X\nSubject to: X^T * A * X ≤ 4\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Lagrangian method. The Lagrangian function is:\n\nL(X, λ) = -X^T * Q * X + λ(X^T * A * X - b)\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of L with respect to X and set it to zero:\n\n∇L(X, λ) = -2Q * X + 2λA * X = 0\n\nSolving for X, we get:\n\nX = (Q - λA)^(-1) * 0 = 0\n\nSince X = 0, we have x = 0 and y = 0. However, this solution does not satisfy the constraint x² + y² ≤ 4. Therefore, we need to check the boundary of the constraint, where x² + y² = 4.\n\nOn the boundary, we can use polar coordinates to rewrite the constraint as:\n\nx = 2cos(θ)\ny = 2sin(θ)\n\nNow, the objective function becomes:\n\nf(θ) = -4cos(θ)sin(θ) = -2sin(2θ)\n\nThe minimum value of sin(2θ) is -1, which occurs at θ = 3π/4 and 7π/4. Therefore, the minimum value of f(θ) is 2.\n\nSo, the minimum value of the original problem is f(x, y) = 2, which occurs at the points (x, y) = (2cos(3π/4), 2sin(3π/4)) and (x, y) = (2cos(7π/4), 2sin(7π/4))."
