    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures at the point (1,1,3), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of the surface equation.\n\nGiven the surface equation z = x^2 + 2y^2, we have:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = 4y\n\nNow, we find the tangent vectors at the point (1,1,3):\n\nT_x = (1, 0, ∂z/∂x) = (1, 0, 2)\nT_y = (0, 1, ∂z/∂y) = (0, 1, 4)\n\nNext, we compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = T_x • T_x = 1^2 + 0^2 + 2^2 = 5\nF = T_x • T_y = 1*0 + 0*1 + 2*4 = 8\nG = T_y • T_y = 0^2 + 1^2 + 4^2 = 17\n\nNow, we find the second derivatives of the surface equation:\n\n∂²z/∂x² = 2\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\n∂²z/∂y² = 8\n\nWe compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = N • (∂²z/∂x²) = 2\nM = N • (∂²z/∂x∂y) = 0\nN = N • (∂²z/∂y²) = 8\n\nNow, we find the principal curvatures k1 and k2 by solving the following equation:\n\n(E*N - 2*F*M + G*L) * k^2 - (E*N + G*L) * k + L*G - M^2 = 0\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n(5*8 - 2*0 + 17*2) * k^2 - (5*8 + 17*2) * k + 2*17 - 0^2 = 0\n(40 + 34) * k^2 - (40 + 34) * k + 34 = 0\n74 * k^2 - 74 * k + 34 = 0\n\nNow, we solve the quadratic equation for k:\n\nk1 = (74 + sqrt(74^2 - 4*74*34)) / (2*74) ≈ 0.459\nk2 = (74 - sqrt(74^2 - 4*74*34)) / (2*74) ≈ 1.541\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1,1,3) are approximately k1 ≈ 0.459 and k2 ≈ 1.541."
