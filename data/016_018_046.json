    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set does not depend on the number of iterations. It remains constant regardless of how many times the middle third is removed. To calculate the Hausdorff dimension, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and M is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Cantor set, after each iteration, there are 2 self-similar pieces (N = 2) and the scaling factor is 3 (M = 3) since we remove the middle third.\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(3) â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is approximately 0.6309, regardless of the number of iterations."
