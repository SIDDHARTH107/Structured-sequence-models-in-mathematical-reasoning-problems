    "message_1": "What is the area of the Mandelbrot set in the complex plane, when the set is defined as all the complex numbers c for which the iterated complex function f(z)=z^2+c does not diverge when starting with z=0? Express your answer to the nearest square unit of the complex plane.",
    "message_2": "The area of the Mandelbrot set is difficult to calculate exactly, but numerical approximations have been made. The area is estimated to be approximately 1.506 square units in the complex plane."
