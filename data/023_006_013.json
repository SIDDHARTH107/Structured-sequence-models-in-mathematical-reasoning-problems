    "message_2": "To find the value of f(t) at t = 2, we need to use the inverse Fourier transform formula:\n\nf(t) = (1 / (2π)) * ∫[F(ω) * e^(jωt) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nGiven F(ω) = 4 / (ω^2 + 1), we need to find the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nf(t) = (1 / (2π)) * ∫[(4 / (ω^2 + 1)) * e^(jωt) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we need to find the value of f(t) at t = 2:\n\nf(2) = (1 / (2π)) * ∫[(4 / (ω^2 + 1)) * e^(jω(2)) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nThis integral is a complex integral, and its evaluation requires the use of complex analysis techniques, specifically the residue theorem. The integral has simple poles at ω = ±j. We can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral by finding the residues at these poles.\n\nResidue at ω = j:\nRes = lim_(ω->j) [(ω - j) * (4 / (ω^2 + 1)) * e^(jω(2))]\nRes = (4 / (2j)) * e^(-2) = -2e^(-2) / j\n\nResidue at ω = -j:\nRes = lim_(ω->-j) [(ω + j) * (4 / (ω^2 + 1)) * e^(jω(2))]\nRes = (4 / (-2j)) * e^(2) = -2e^(2) / j\n\nSince the contour of integration is along the real axis, only the pole at ω = j is enclosed by the contour. Therefore, the integral is equal to 2πj times the residue at ω = j:\n\nf(2) = (1 / (2π)) * (2πj) * (-2e^(-2) / j)\nf(2) = -2e^(-2)\n\nSo, the value of f(t) at t = 2 is -2e^(-2)."
