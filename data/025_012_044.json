    "message_2": "The given equation is y^2 = x^3 + x + 1, which is a cubic curve. To determine the arithmetic genus of this curve, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem. However, it's important to note that the arithmetic genus of an elliptic curve can be directly computed using the formula:\n\ng = (n-1)(n-2)/2\n\nwhere g is the arithmetic genus and n is the degree of the curve. In this case, the degree of the curve is 3 (cubic curve), so we can directly compute the arithmetic genus:\n\ng = (3-1)(3-2)/2\ng = (2)(1)/2\ng = 1\n\nTherefore, the arithmetic genus of the given elliptic curve is 1."
