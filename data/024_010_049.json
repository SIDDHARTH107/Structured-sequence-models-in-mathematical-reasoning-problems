    "message_2": "To find the Levi-Civita connection of the given metric, we will use the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, which are given by:\n\nΓ^k_ij = (1/2) * g^(kl) * (∂g_lj/∂x^i + ∂g_li/∂x^j - ∂g_ij/∂x^l)\n\nwhere g^(kl) is the inverse of the metric tensor g_kl.\n\nFirst, let's find the inverse of the metric tensor g. The given metric can be written in matrix form as:\n\ng = | 1  1 |\n    | 1  1 |\n\nTo find the inverse, we compute the determinant:\n\ndet(g) = (1)(1) - (1)(1) = 0\n\nSince the determinant is zero, the given metric tensor is degenerate and does not have an inverse. Therefore, the Levi-Civita connection cannot be computed for this metric."
