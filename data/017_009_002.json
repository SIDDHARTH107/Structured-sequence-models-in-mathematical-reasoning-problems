    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 9, and let a be an element of G of order 3. Since the order of G is 9, by the Sylow Theorems, G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup P. Since the order of a is 3, a is an element of P. Note that the order of P is 3, so P is generated by a, i.e., P = ⟨a⟩.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/P. Since |G| = 9 and |P| = 3, we have |G/P| = 9/3 = 3. Let bP be a generator of G/P, where b is an element of G. Then, G/P = ⟨bP⟩, and (bP)^3 = b^3P = P, which implies that b^3 ∈ P. Since P = ⟨a⟩, there exists an integer k such that b^3 = a^k. The possible values of k are 0, 1, or 2, as a has order 3.\n\nCase 1: k = 0\nIn this case, b^3 = a^0 = 1. So, G is generated by a and b, with a^3 = b^3 = 1. Since G has order 9, every element in G can be written uniquely in the form a^i * b^j, where 0 ≤ i, j ≤ 2. Thus, G is isomorphic to C9, the cyclic group of order 9.\n\nCase 2: k = 1\nIn this case, b^3 = a. Consider the element aba^(-1)b^(-1). Since P is normal in G, we have a^(-1)b^(-1)a = b^(-1)a^(-1)a = b^(-1). Thus, aba^(-1)b^(-1) = ab^(-1)a^(-1) = a^2b^(-1)a^(-1) = a^2(ba)^(-1) = a^2(a^2b)^(-1) = a^2a^(-4)b^(-1) = b^(-1). So, ba = a^2b, and G is generated by a and b with the relations a^3 = b^3 = 1 and ba = a^2b. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 9 defined by the presentation ⟨a, b | a^3 = b^3 = 1, ba = a^2b⟩.\n\nCase 3: k = 2\nIn this case, b^3 = a^2. We can show that this case is equivalent to Case 2. Consider the element c = b^2. Then, c^3 = (b^2)^3 = b^6 = a^4 = a. So, we are back to Case 2 with c replacing b. Thus, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 9 defined by the presentation ⟨a, b | a^3 = b^3 = 1, ba = a^2b⟩.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9 defined by the presentation ⟨a, b | a^3 = b^3 = 1, ba = a^2b⟩."
