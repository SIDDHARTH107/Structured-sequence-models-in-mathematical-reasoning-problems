    "message_2": "To find the integral of sin^2(x)dx from x = 0 to x = pi/2, we can use the power-reduction formula:\n\nsin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2\n\nNow, we can integrate this expression with respect to x:\n\n∫sin^2(x)dx = ∫(1 - cos(2x))/2 dx\n\nLet's integrate each term separately:\n\n∫(1/2)dx - ∫(1/2)cos(2x)dx\n\nThe integral of (1/2)dx is (1/2)x, and we can use substitution to find the integral of (1/2)cos(2x)dx. Let u = 2x, so du/dx = 2, and dx = du/2:\n\n(1/2)∫cos(u)du\n\nNow, we can integrate cos(u) with respect to u:\n\n(1/2)∫cos(u)du = (1/2)sin(u) + C\n\nSubstitute back for x:\n\n(1/2)sin(2x) + C\n\nNow, we have the indefinite integral:\n\n(1/2)x - (1/2)sin(2x) + C\n\nTo find the definite integral from x = 0 to x = pi/2, we'll evaluate the indefinite integral at the bounds and subtract:\n\n[(1/2)(pi/2) - (1/2)sin(2(pi/2))] - [(1/2)(0) - (1/2)sin(2(0))]\n\n= (pi/4 - 0) - (0 - 0)\n\n= pi/4\n\nSo, the integral of sin^2(x)dx from x = 0 to x = pi/2 is pi/4."
