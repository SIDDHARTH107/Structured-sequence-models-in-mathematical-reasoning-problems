    "message_1": "Suppose in a population of 1000 individuals, the probability of having a certain medical condition is 0.05. What is the probability that at most 50 individuals in the population have the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k individuals with the medical condition\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k! * (n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of having the medical condition (0.05)\n- n is the total number of individuals (1000)\n- k is the number of individuals with the medical condition\n\nWe want to find the probability that at most 50 individuals have the medical condition, which means we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to k = 50.\n\nP(X ≤ 50) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 50\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be computationally intensive, so we can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability. The binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean μ = n * p and standard deviation σ = √(n * p * (1-p)).\n\nIn this case, μ = 1000 * 0.05 = 50 and σ = √(1000 * 0.05 * 0.95) ≈ 6.84.\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) to find the probability. We need to find P(Z ≤ (50.5 - μ) / σ), where 50.5 is used as a continuity correction factor.\n\nZ = (50.5 - 50) / 6.84 ≈ 0.073\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that P(Z ≤ 0.073) ≈ 0.5294.\n\nSo, the probability that at most 50 individuals in the population have the medical condition is approximately 0.5294 or 52.94%."
