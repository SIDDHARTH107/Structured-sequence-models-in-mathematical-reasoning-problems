Anne has $100 and has to decide how much money to send to Bob. For every dollar she sends, Bob will receive $3. Bob then has to decide how much of the money he received to send back to Anne. For every dollar he sends back, Anne will receive $2. How much money should Anne send to Bob to maximize her total payoff?\n\nNote: In the Trust Game, the players have to decide how much to trust each other and how much to cooperate. The problem requires the student to evaluate the optimal decision-making strategy in order to maximize the payoff.",
    "message_2": "To maximize Anne's total payoff, we need to consider the best possible outcome for her, assuming that Bob will act in a way that maximizes his own payoff. Let x be the amount of money Anne sends to Bob, and y be the amount of money Bob sends back to Anne.\n\nAnne's total payoff will be her initial $100 minus the amount she sends to Bob (x) plus the amount she receives back from Bob (2y). So, her payoff is P_A = 100 - x + 2y.\n\nBob receives 3x dollars from Anne and sends back y dollars to Anne. So, his payoff is P_B = 3x - y.\n\nBob will act in a way that maximizes his own payoff. Therefore, he will send back an amount y that maximizes P_B. To find the optimal y, we can take the derivative of P_B with respect to y and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(P_B)/dy = -1\n\nSince the derivative is a constant and does not depend on y, there is no maximum or minimum value for P_B based on y. This means that Bob has no incentive to send any money back to Anne, as it does not affect his payoff. In this case, the optimal strategy for Bob is to keep all the money he receives (y = 0).\n\nKnowing that Bob will not send any money back, Anne should not send any money to Bob in the first place, as she will not receive any return on her investment. Therefore, the optimal strategy for Anne is to send x = 0 dollars to Bob.\n\nIn this scenario, Anne's total payoff is maximized at $100, and Bob's payoff is $0."
