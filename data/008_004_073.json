    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and add it to the second equation, and multiply the first equation by 3 and add it to the third equation.\n\nFirst equation * 2:\n2x + 6y - 4z = 0\n\nAdd to the second equation:\n(2x - 4y + 6z) + (2x + 6y - 4z) = 0\n4x + 2z = 0\n\nFirst equation * 3:\n3x + 9y - 6z = 0\n\nAdd to the third equation:\n(-3x + 7y - 4z) + (3x + 9y - 6z) = 0\n16y - 10z = 0\n\nNow we have a new system of equations with two variables:\n\n4x + 2z = 0\n16y - 10z = 0\n\nLet's solve the first equation for x:\n\n4x = -2z\nx = -1/2z\n\nNow, substitute x in the second equation:\n\n16y - 10z = 0\n16y = 10z\ny = 5/8z\n\nNow we have x and y in terms of z. Since this is a system of linear equations with three variables and three equations, we can express the solution as a parametric vector form:\n\n(x, y, z) = z(-1/2, 5/8, 1)\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -1/2z\ny = 5/8z\nz = z\n\nwhere z can be any real number."
