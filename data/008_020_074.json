    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  1 |  5 ]\n[ 4  2 | 10 ]\n[ 3 -1 | -1 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Divide the first row by 2:\n\n```\n[ 1  0.5 |  2.5 ]\n[ 4  2   | 10   ]\n[ 3 -1   | -1   ]\n```\n\n2. Replace the second row with (-4 times the first row) + the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0.5 |  2.5 ]\n[ 0  0   |  0   ]\n[ 3 -1   | -1   ]\n```\n\n3. Replace the third row with (-3 times the first row) + the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0.5 |  2.5 ]\n[ 0  0   |  0   ]\n[ 0 -2.5 | -8.5 ]\n```\n\n4. Divide the third row by -2.5:\n\n```\n[ 1  0.5 |  2.5 ]\n[ 0  0   |  0   ]\n[ 0  1   |  3.4 ]\n```\n\n5. Replace the first row with (-0.5 times the third row) + the first row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0 |  0.3 ]\n[ 0  0 |  0   ]\n[ 0  1 |  3.4 ]\n```\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. From the matrix, we can read off the solutions:\n\nx = 0.3\ny = 3.4\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 0.3 and y = 3.4."
