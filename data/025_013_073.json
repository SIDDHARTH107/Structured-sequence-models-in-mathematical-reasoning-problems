    "message_2": "1. To find the Jacobian of the curve, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the given equation with respect to x and y. Let F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 2x - 1. Then, the Jacobian matrix J is given by:\n\nJ = [∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y]\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 - 2\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix J is:\n\nJ = [-3x^2 - 2, 2y]\n\n2. To find the rank of the Jacobian at the point (1, -1), we need to evaluate the Jacobian matrix at this point:\n\nJ(1, -1) = [-3(1)^2 - 2, 2(-1)] = [-5, -2]\n\nSince the Jacobian matrix at this point is a 1x2 matrix with non-zero elements, its rank is 1."
