    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE), we can use the method of characteristics. The PDE is given by:\n\n∂u/∂x + i∂u/∂y = xy\n\nFirst, we rewrite the PDE in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\ndx/dt = 1, dy/dt = i, du/dt = xy\n\nNow, we solve the ODEs for x(t), y(t), and u(t):\n\n1. dx/dt = 1 => x(t) = t + C1\n\n2. dy/dt = i => y(t) = it + C2\n\n3. du/dt = xy => du/dt = (t + C1)(it + C2)\n\nTo solve the third ODE, we can use an integrating factor. Let's multiply both sides by e^(∫(t+C1)dt):\n\ne^(∫(t+C1)dt) * du/dt = e^(∫(t+C1)dt) * (t + C1)(it + C2)\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product u(t)e^(∫(t+C1)dt):\n\nd(u(t)e^(∫(t+C1)dt))/dt = (t + C1)(it + C2)e^(∫(t+C1)dt)\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to t:\n\nu(t)e^(∫(t+C1)dt) = ∫(t + C1)(it + C2)e^(∫(t+C1)dt) dt + C3\n\nNow, we can solve for u(t):\n\nu(t) = e^(-∫(t+C1)dt) * [∫(t + C1)(it + C2)e^(∫(t+C1)dt) dt + C3]\n\nNow, we need to find the constants C1, C2, and C3 using the boundary conditions:\n\n1. u(0,0) = 1 => u(t=0) = 1\n\n2. u(1,0) = 0 => u(t=1) = 0\n\n3. u(x,1) = x^2 => u(t, t=i) = (t + C1)^2\n\nUnfortunately, this PDE with the given boundary conditions does not have a unique solution using the method of characteristics. The problem is that the boundary conditions are not compatible with the characteristics of the PDE. In this case, it is necessary to use other methods or techniques to find a solution, or to modify the boundary conditions to make them compatible with the characteristics of the PDE."
