    "message_2": "First, we need to correct the statement: 25 is not a prime number, it is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself (5 x 5 = 25). Now, let's find all possible groups of order 25.\n\nA group of order 25 has 25 elements. Since 25 = 5^2, we can use the Sylow theorems to help us classify the possible groups of order 25.\n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in a group of order 25 must divide the order of the group (25) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibilities are 1 and 25. However, since there must be at least one Sylow 5-subgroup, we can exclude the possibility of 25 Sylow 5-subgroups. Therefore, there must be exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup.\n\nThis Sylow 5-subgroup is of order 5, and since it is unique, it must be normal in the group. Let's denote this subgroup as H. Since the order of H is 5, which is a prime number, H is cyclic and isomorphic to Z_5 (the group of integers modulo 5 under addition).\n\nNow, let G be the group of order 25. Since H is a normal subgroup of G, we can form the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is |G|/|H| = 25/5 = 5, which is a prime number. Therefore, G/H is also cyclic and isomorphic to Z_5.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that G has a normal subgroup H isomorphic to Z_5 and a quotient group G/H isomorphic to Z_5 to classify the possible groups of order 25. There are two possibilities:\n\n1. G is the direct product of H and G/H, which is isomorphic to Z_5 x Z_5 (the direct product of two copies of Z_5). This group is abelian and has the property that every element has order 1, 5, or 25.\n\n2. G is a semidirect product of H and G/H. However, since the only automorphism of Z_5 is the identity automorphism, the semidirect product is essentially the same as the direct product. Therefore, G is isomorphic to Z_5 x Z_5 in this case as well.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one group of order 25 up to isomorphism, and it is the abelian group Z_5 x Z_5."
