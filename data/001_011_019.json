    "message_2": "To solve the equation (5/x) + (2/(x+1)) = 1, we will first find a common denominator for the two fractions, which is x(x+1). Then, we will rewrite the equation with the common denominator:\n\n(5(x+1) + 2x) / (x(x+1)) = 1\n\nNow, we will multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator, x(x+1), to eliminate the fractions:\n\n5(x+1) + 2x = x(x+1)\n\nNext, we will distribute the terms and simplify the equation:\n\n5x + 5 + 2x = x^2 + x\n\nCombine the like terms on the left side:\n\n7x + 5 = x^2 + x\n\nNow, we will move all the terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nWe can now factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0\n\nFinally, we will solve for x by setting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 1 = 0  =>  x = 1\nx - 5 = 0  =>  x = 5\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 1 and 5."
