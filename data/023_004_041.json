At x = 0, the exponential term is 1. So, the first integral becomes:\n\n(1/(-2π(1 + ik))) * (1 - 0) = 1/(-2π(1 + ik)).\n\nFor the second integral, as x approaches -∞, the exponential term goes to 0. At x = 0, the exponential term is 1. So, the second integral becomes:\n\n(1/(2π(1 - ik))) * (1 - 0) = 1/(2π(1 - ik)).\n\nNow, we can add the two integrals:\n\nF(k) = 1/(-2π(1 + ik)) + 1/(2π(1 - ik)).\n\nTo simplify, let's find a common denominator:\n\nF(k) = [(1 - ik) - (1 + ik)] / [4π^2(1 - k^2)].\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\nF(k) = -2ik / [4π^2(1 - k^2)].\n\nFinally, we can simplify the expression:\n\nF(k) = -ik / [2π(1 - k^2)].\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-2π|x|) is:\n\nF(k) = -ik / [2π(1 - k^2)]."
