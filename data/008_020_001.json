    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method, we will perform a series of operations on the augmented matrix to get it into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 6 |\n| 2  5  4 | 4 |\n| 3  7  5 | 3 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\nTo do this, we will subtract 2 times the first row from the second row and 3 times the first row from the third row.\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 3 * Row1\n\n| 1  2  3 |  6  |\n| 0  1 -2 | -8  |\n| 0  1 -4 | -15 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\nTo do this, we will subtract the second row from the third row.\n\nRow3 = Row3 - Row2\n\n| 1  2  3 |  6  |\n| 0  1 -2 | -8  |\n| 0  0 -2 | -7  |\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can solve for z by dividing the third row by -2.\n\nRow3 = Row3 / -2\n\n| 1  2  3 |  6  |\n| 0  1 -2 | -8  |\n| 0  0  1 |  3.5|\n\nz = 3.5\n\nStep 4: Back-substitute to find y and x.\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into the second row to find y.\n\ny - 2(3.5) = -8\ny - 7 = -8\ny = 1\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z back into the first row to find x.\n\nx + 2(1) + 3(3.5) = 6\nx + 2 + 10.5 = 6\nx = -6.5\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -6.5, y = 1, and z = 3.5."
