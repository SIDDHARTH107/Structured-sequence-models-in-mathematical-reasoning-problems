    "message_1": "Let $C$ be a rational curve in the plane defined by the equation $x^2+y^2=8xy$. Determine the number of singular points on $C$ and classify each singular point as a node, cusp, or an isolated point.",
    "message_2": "To find the singular points on the curve $C$, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to $x$ and $y$. \n\nLet $F(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 8xy$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 2x - 8y$ and $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y - 8x$.\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y)$ where both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n$2x - 8y = 0$ and $2y - 8x = 0$.\n\nSolving the first equation for $x$, we get $x = 4y$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n$2y - 8(4y) = 0 \\Rightarrow 2y - 32y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$.\n\nSince $y = 0$, we can substitute this back into the equation for $x$ to get $x = 4(0) = 0$. So, the only singular point is $(0, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to classify this singular point as a node, cusp, or isolated point. To do this, we can compute the second partial derivatives of $F(x, y)$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x^2} = 2$, $\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial y^2} = 2$, and $\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -8$.\n\nWe can then compute the discriminant $\\Delta$ of the Hessian matrix, which is given by:\n\n$\\Delta = \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x^2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial y^2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\right)^2 = 2 \\cdot 2 - (-8)^2 = 4 - 64 = -60$.\n\nSince $\\Delta < 0$, the singular point $(0, 0)$ is a node.\n\nTherefore, the curve $C$ has one singular point, which is a node at $(0, 0)$."
