    "message_2": "To calculate the total surface area of the metal ball, we can use the formula for the surface area of a sphere:\n\nSurface Area (A) = 4 * π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nSince the diameter of the metal ball is 10 cm, its radius (r) is half of the diameter:\n\nr = 10 cm / 2 = 5 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the radius into the formula:\n\nA = 4 * π * (5 cm)²\nA = 4 * π * 25 cm²\nA = 100 * π cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the metal ball is approximately 314.16 cm² (rounded to two decimal places)."
