What is the minimum number of friends needed to guarantee that either 3 of them have the same favorite color or 3 of them have different favorite colors?\n2. If one more friend joins the group, what is the minimum number of friends needed to guarantee the same result?",
    "message_2": "1. The minimum number of friends needed to guarantee that either 3 of them have the same favorite color or 3 of them have different favorite colors is 4. Here's why:\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the first two friends have different favorite colors (e.g., red and blue). The third friend can either have the same favorite color as one of the first two friends (in which case we have 3 friends with the same favorite color) or have a different favorite color (e.g., green), in which case we have 3 friends with different favorite colors.\n\n2. If one more friend joins the group, making it a group of 7 friends, the minimum number of friends needed to guarantee the same result remains 4. Adding more friends to the group does not change the minimum number of friends needed to guarantee that either 3 of them have the same favorite color or 3 of them have different favorite colors."
