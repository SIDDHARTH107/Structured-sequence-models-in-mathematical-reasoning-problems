    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 8x, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = x^3 + 2x^2 - 8x\n\nFirst, notice that there is a common factor of x in all terms. We can factor it out:\n\n0 = x(x^2 + 2x - 8)\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + 2x - 8. To do this, we can either factor the quadratic or use the quadratic formula. In this case, the quadratic can be factored:\n\nx^2 + 2x - 8 = (x + 4)(x - 2)\n\nSo, we have:\n\n0 = x(x + 4)(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can set each factor equal to 0 and solve for x:\n\nx = 0\nx + 4 = 0 => x = -4\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\n\nThus, the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation are x = 0, x = -4, and x = 2."
