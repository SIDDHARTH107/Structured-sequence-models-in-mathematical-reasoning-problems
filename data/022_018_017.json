    "message_2": "To solve this partial differential equation, we can use the method of characteristics. First, let's rewrite the equation in terms of the complex variable $z = x + iy$ and its conjugate $\\bar{z} = x - iy$. We have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} + i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = 0\n$$\n\nNow, let's introduce a new function $v(z, \\bar{z})$ such that:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = -i\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z}\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} - \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = 0\n$$\n\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $\\bar{z}$, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = v(z) + f(z)\n$$\n\nwhere $f(z)$ is an arbitrary holomorphic function. Now, we can integrate this equation with respect to $z$:\n\n$$\nu(z, \\bar{z}) = \\int v(z) dz + F(z) + G(\\bar{z})\n$$\n\nwhere $F(z)$ and $G(\\bar{z})$ are arbitrary holomorphic functions. Now, we can use the initial conditions to determine these functions. We have:\n\n$$\nu(x, 0) = 0 \\Rightarrow F(x) + G(x) = 0\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}(x, 0) = x \\Rightarrow \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}(x) = x\n$$\n\nIntegrating the second equation, we get $G(\\bar{z}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\bar{z}^2 + C$, where $C$ is a constant. Since $u(z, \\bar{z})$ is entire, $G(\\bar{z})$ must be entire as well, which implies that $C = 0$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$\nG(\\bar{z}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\bar{z}^2\n$$\n\nNow, using the first initial condition, we get $F(z) = -\\frac{1}{2}z^2$. Therefore, the unique solution to the given partial differential equation is:\n\n$$\nu(z, \\bar{z}) = \\int v(z) dz - \\frac{1}{2}z^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\bar{z}^2\n$$\n\nSince we don't have any information about $v(z)$, we cannot find an explicit expression for $u(z, \\bar{z})$. However, we have found the general form of the solution, which is entire in the complex plane."
