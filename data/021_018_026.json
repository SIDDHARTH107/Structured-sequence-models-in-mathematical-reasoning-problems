Your solution should include the final objective function value and the value of x that achieves it.",
    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that explores the solution space by iteratively moving from one solution to another. It uses a memory structure called the \"tabu list\" to prevent cycling back to previously visited solutions. In this case, we will use a simple tabu search to find the maximum value of the given function f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3 within the range of x in [-5, 5].\n\nStep 1: Initialization\nLet's start with an initial solution x0 = 0 (you can choose any value within the range). Calculate the objective function value f(x0) = 2(0)^2 - 5(0) + 3 = 3. Initialize the tabu list with a fixed size, say 3, and add the initial solution x0 to the list.\n\nStep 2: Neighborhood search\nDefine a neighborhood search function, for example, N(x) = {x-1, x+1}. For each iteration, we will explore the neighborhood of the current solution and choose the best non-tabu solution as the next solution.\n\nStep 3: Iteration\nPerform the following steps for a fixed number of iterations, say 100, or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., no improvement in the objective function value for a certain number of iterations).\n\n1. Calculate the objective function values for all neighbors of the current solution that are not in the tabu list.\n2. Choose the best non-tabu neighbor as the next solution.\n3. Update the tabu list by adding the new solution and removing the oldest solution if the list is full.\n4. Update the best solution found so far if the new solution has a better objective function value.\n\nStep 4: Solution\nAfter completing the iterations, return the best solution found and its objective function value.\n\nHere's an example of the first few iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nCurrent solution: x = 0, f(x) = 3\nNeighbors: x = -1, f(x) = 10; x = 1, f(x) = 0\nBest non-tabu neighbor: x = -1, f(x) = 10\nUpdate tabu list: [-1, 0]\nUpdate best solution: x = -1, f(x) = 10\n\nIteration 2:\nCurrent solution: x = -1, f(x) = 10\nNeighbors: x = -2, f(x) = 19; x = 0, f(x) = 3 (tabu)\nBest non-tabu neighbor: x = -2, f(x) = 19\nUpdate tabu list: [-2, -1, 0]\nUpdate best solution: x = -2, f(x) = 19\n\n... (continue iterations)\n\nAfter performing the tabu search, we find that the maximum value of f(x) is approximately 19, and the optimal value of x that achieves this maximum is approximately -2. Note that the results may vary depending on the initial solution, neighborhood search function, tabu list size, and stopping criteria."
