    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of proper k-colorings of G.\n\n1. First, let's consider the edge connecting vertices 1 and 2. We can delete this edge to get a new graph G' and contract it to get another graph G''.\n\n2. The graph G' is a cycle with 5 vertices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The chromatic polynomial of a cycle with an odd number of vertices is P(G', k) = (k-1)^n - (-1)^n(k-1), where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n = 5, so P(G', k) = (k-1)^5 - (-1)^5(k-1).\n\n3. The graph G'' is obtained by merging vertices 1 and 2 into a single vertex. This results in a cycle with 4 vertices (1-2, 3, 4, 5). The chromatic polynomial of a cycle with an even number of vertices is P(G'', k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1), where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n = 4, so P(G'', k) = (k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1).\n\n4. Now, we can use the deletion-contraction formula to find the chromatic polynomial of G: P(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k).\n\nP(G, k) = [(k-1)^5 - (-1)^5(k-1)] - [(k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1)]\nP(G, k) = (k-1)^5 - (k-1) - (k-1)^4 - (k-1)\nP(G, k) = (k-1)^5 - (k-1)^4 - 2(k-1)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G is P(G, k) = (k-1)^5 - (k-1)^4 - 2(k-1)."
