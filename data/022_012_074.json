    "message_2": "To find the poles of the meromorphic function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z^2 + 1), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero, as these are the points where the function will be undefined.\n\nThe denominator is z^2 + 1. To find the zeros, we set this equal to zero and solve for z:\n\nz^2 + 1 = 0\nz^2 = -1\nz = ±√(-1)\n\nSince √(-1) is equal to the imaginary unit i, the zeros of the denominator are z = ±i. These are the poles of the meromorphic function f(z).\n\nNow, we need to find the order of each pole. The order of a pole is the number of times it appears as a root of the denominator. In this case, both ±i are simple roots of the denominator, as they each appear only once. Therefore, the poles ±i both have order 1.\n\nIn summary, the meromorphic function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z^2 + 1) has two poles, ±i, and both have order 1."
