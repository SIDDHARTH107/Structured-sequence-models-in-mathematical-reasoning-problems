    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos(x) + sin(2x) = 1 for x in the range of 0 to 360 degrees, we can use the double angle identity for sine, which is sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x). \n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\ncos(x) + 2sin(x)cos(x) = 1\n\nNow, factor out the cos(x):\n\ncos(x)(1 + 2sin(x)) = 1\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\n1) cos(x) = 0\n2) 1 + 2sin(x) = 1\n\nFor case 1, cos(x) = 0:\n\nx = 90 degrees or x = 270 degrees\n\nFor case 2, 1 + 2sin(x) = 1:\n\n2sin(x) = 0\nsin(x) = 0\n\nx = 0 degrees or x = 180 degrees\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the range of 0 to 360 degrees are:\n\nx = 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees."
