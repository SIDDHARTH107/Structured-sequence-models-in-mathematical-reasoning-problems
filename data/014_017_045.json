    "message_1": "A message has been encrypted using a substitution cipher. After performing a frequency analysis on the encrypted message, it is found that the letter \"W\" appears the most frequently. The frequency of this letter is 0.14. What is the probability that any given letter in the English alphabet is also encrypted as \"W\"? (Assume a uniform distribution of letters in the English language.)",
    "message_2": "Since we are assuming a uniform distribution of letters in the English language, each of the 26 letters in the alphabet has an equal chance of being encrypted as \"W\". Therefore, the probability that any given letter is encrypted as \"W\" is 1/26, or approximately 0.0385."
