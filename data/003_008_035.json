    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we first need to find the height (the other leg of the right triangle). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to do this:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the legs of the right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse. In this case, the base (a) is 18 inches and the hypotenuse (c) is 20 inches. We need to find the height (b).\n\n18^2 + b^2 = 20^2\n324 + b^2 = 400\n\nNow, subtract 324 from both sides:\n\nb^2 = 76\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nb = √76 ≈ 8.72 inches\n\nNow that we have the height, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nArea = (18 * 8.72) / 2 ≈ 78.48 square inches\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 78.48 square inches."
