    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the length of the two equal sides are 7 cm each. Find the length of the third side if the perimeter of the triangle is 21 cm.",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the third side be x cm. Since the perimeter of the triangle is 21 cm, we can write the equation:\n\n7 + 7 + x = 21\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n14 + x = 21\nx = 21 - 14\nx = 7\n\nSo, the length of the third side is 7 cm."
