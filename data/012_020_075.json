In this case, we have a simple square graph with vertices A, B, C, and D.\n\nThere are 8 automorphisms for this graph:\n\n1. Identity (no change): A -> A, B -> B, C -> C, D -> D\n2. Horizontal reflection: A -> B, B -> A, C -> D, D -> C\n3. Vertical reflection: A -> C, B -> D, C -> A, D -> B\n4. Diagonal reflection (A-D): A -> D, B -> C, C -> B, D -> A\n5. Diagonal reflection (B-C): A -> C, B -> B, C -> A, D -> D\n6. 90-degree rotation clockwise: A -> B, B -> D, C -> A, D -> C\n7. 90-degree rotation counterclockwise: A -> C, B -> A, C -> D, D -> B\n8. 180-degree rotation: A -> D, B -> C, C -> B, D -> A\n\nThese 8 automorphisms form the automorphism group of the given graph, which is isomorphic to the Dihedral group of order 8, denoted as D4."
