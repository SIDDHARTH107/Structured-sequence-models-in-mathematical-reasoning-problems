    "message_2": "The Riemann-Roch theorem for a compact Riemann surface (or algebraic curve) relates the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with prescribed orders at a given set of points to the genus of the curve and the orders of the points. In the case of a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2, the Riemann-Roch constant is given by the formula:\n\nRiemann-Roch constant = g - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\n\nwhere g is the genus of the curve. In this case, the genus is 2, so the Riemann-Roch constant for the given hyperelliptic curve is 1."
