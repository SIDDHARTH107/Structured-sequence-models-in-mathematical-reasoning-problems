    "message_1": "A materials science researcher is investigating the thermal properties of a metal sample. The thermal conductivity of the sample varies with position, given by the function k(x) = 0.2 + 0.1x, where x is the distance (in meters) from one end of the sample. The researcher wants to find the temperature distribution in the sample when an initial temperature of 50°C is applied to one end of the sample, assuming that the other end of the sample is insulated. Can you use the Fourier transform to solve for the temperature distribution as a function of position x (in meters) and time t (in seconds) when t = 10 seconds?",
    "message_2": "In this case, the Fourier transform method is not the most appropriate method to solve the problem, since the thermal conductivity k(x) is not constant. Instead, we can use the non-homogeneous heat equation to find the temperature distribution.\n\nThe non-homogeneous heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = k(x) * ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature distribution as a function of position x and time t, and k(x) is the thermal conductivity as a function of position x.\n\nGiven k(x) = 0.2 + 0.1x, we can rewrite the heat equation as:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = (0.2 + 0.1x) * ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nTo solve this partial differential equation, we can use separation of variables or numerical methods such as finite difference or finite element methods. However, finding an analytical solution for this problem is quite challenging due to the non-constant thermal conductivity. Therefore, it is more practical to use numerical methods to solve this problem.\n\nOnce the temperature distribution T(x,t) is found using a numerical method, you can evaluate it at t = 10 seconds to find the temperature distribution as a function of position x at that time."
