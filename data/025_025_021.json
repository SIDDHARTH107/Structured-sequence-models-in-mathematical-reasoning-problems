    "message_2": "Let's rewrite the given equation as follows:\n\n$x_1^3x_2 - 2x_1x_2^2 + x_2x_1^2 + x_2^2x_1 - x_1x_2 = 0$\n\n$x_1^3x_2 - x_1x_2 + x_2x_1^2 - x_1x_2^2 + x_2^2x_1 = 0$\n\nNow, let's factor out $x_1x_2$ from the first and second terms, and $x_2x_1$ from the third and fourth terms:\n\n$x_1x_2(x_1^2 - 1) + x_2x_1(x_2^2 - 1) = 0$\n\nNow, let's factor out $x_1x_2$ from the entire equation:\n\n$x_1x_2[(x_1^2 - 1) + (x_2^2 - 1)] = 0$\n\nNow, we have three cases to consider:\n\n1. $x_1 = 0$: In this case, the equation becomes $0 = 0$, which is true for any value of $x_2$. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions in this case.\n\n2. $x_2 = 0$: In this case, the equation becomes $0 = 0$, which is true for any value of $x_1$. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions in this case as well.\n\n3. $(x_1^2 - 1) + (x_2^2 - 1) = 0$: In this case, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2$. This is the equation of a circle with radius $\\sqrt{2}$ centered at the origin in the complex plane. Since both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are complex numbers, there are infinitely many solutions in this case as well.\n\nSo, in all three cases, there are infinitely many solutions for $x_1$ and $x_2$ in the algebraically closed field $\\mathbb{C}$."
