    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we will use the fact that a group of prime order is always cyclic. Let's consider the elements of G. Since G has order 5, there are 5 elements in G: {e, a, b, c, d}, where e is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's take any element g in G, where g ≠ e. Since the order of G is 5, the order of any element g in G must divide 5. The only divisors of 5 are 1 and 5. If the order of g is 1, then g = e, which is a contradiction because we assumed g ≠ e. Therefore, the order of g must be 5.\n\nSince g has order 5, the subgroup generated by g, denoted as <g>, must have 5 elements: {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4}. Notice that this subgroup has the same number of elements as G, so <g> = G. This means that G is cyclic, and g is a generator of G.\n\nNow, let's find all possible generators of G. Since G is cyclic, all generators of G are of the form g^k, where k is an integer and gcd(k, 5) = 1. The integers k that satisfy this condition are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, the possible generators of G are g, g^2, g^3, and g^4.\n\nIn conclusion, G is a cyclic group of order 5, and its possible generators are g, g^2, g^3, and g^4, where g is any element in G such that g ≠ e."
