    "message_2": "The treewidth of the given graph can be determined by finding a tree decomposition with the smallest width. In this case, we can represent the graph as a tree with the following nodes and edges:\n\n```\nNode 1: {A, B, C}\nNode 2: {B, D, E}\nNode 3: {C, F}\n\nEdges:\nNode 1 - Node 2: {B}\nNode 1 - Node 3: {C}\n```\n\nEach node in the tree corresponds to a subset of nodes in the original graph, and each edge in the tree corresponds to a set of nodes in the original graph that separate the two subsets represented by the nodes connected by the edge.\n\nThe width of this tree decomposition is the size of the largest node minus one. The largest node has 3 vertices, so the treewidth is 3 - 1 = 2."
