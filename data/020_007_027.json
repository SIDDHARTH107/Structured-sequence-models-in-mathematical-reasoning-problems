    "message_1": "A student needs to optimize their schedule for the semester by taking 4 courses out of 6 options. They can take either Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Statistics, Numerical Analysis or Game Theory. Each course has a different credit value (3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3 respectively) and the student wants to maximize their total credit value. What is the optimal combination of 4 courses the student should take?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total credit value, the student should choose the courses with the highest credit values. In this case, the courses with the highest credit values are Linear Algebra (4 credits), Statistics (4 credits), and Numerical Analysis (4 credits). The student can then choose one of the remaining courses with 3 credits to complete their schedule.\n\nThe optimal combination of 4 courses for the student to take would be Linear Algebra, Statistics, Numerical Analysis, and either Calculus, Probability Theory, or Game Theory. This would give the student a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 15 credits for the semester."
