    "message_1": "A travel company offers two types of tours to a popular tourist destination. Tour A costs $300 per person and has a 70% chance of being successful. Tour B costs $500 per person and has a 90% chance of being successful. \n\nWhat is the probability that a group of 4 people, who want to maximize their chances of success, will book Tour B?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to compare the probabilities of success for a group of 4 people on each tour. \n\nLet's first calculate the probability of success for a group of 4 people on Tour A:\nThe probability of success for one person on Tour A is 70%, or 0.7.\nThe probability of success for the whole group is the product of the individual probabilities, so:\nP(success for group on Tour A) = 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.7^4 ≈ 0.2401, or 24.01%.\n\nNow let's calculate the probability of success for a group of 4 people on Tour B:\nThe probability of success for one person on Tour B is 90%, or 0.9.\nThe probability of success for the whole group is the product of the individual probabilities, so:\nP(success for group on Tour B) = 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.9^4 ≈ 0.6561, or 65.61%.\n\nSince the probability of success for the group on Tour B (65.61%) is higher than the probability of success for the group on Tour A (24.01%), the group of 4 people will choose Tour B to maximize their chances of success."
