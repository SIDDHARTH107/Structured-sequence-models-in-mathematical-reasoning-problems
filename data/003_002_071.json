    "message_2": "The sine of a 60-degree angle in a 30-60-90 triangle can be found using the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side lengths have a specific ratio: the side opposite the 30-degree angle is half the length of the hypotenuse, and the side opposite the 60-degree angle is the square root of 3 times the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle.\n\nLet's call the side opposite the 30-degree angle \"a,\" the side opposite the 60-degree angle \"b,\" and the hypotenuse \"c.\" Then, the ratios are:\n\na/c = 1/2\nb/c = √3/2\n\nSince we want to find the sine of the 60-degree angle, we are looking for the ratio b/c. Therefore, the sine of the 60-degree angle is √3/2."
