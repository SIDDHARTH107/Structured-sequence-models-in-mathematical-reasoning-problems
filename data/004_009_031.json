    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the product of two functions, we can use the product rule, which states that $(fg)'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$. \n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(5x^2) = 10x$\n\n$g'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = 2$\n\nNow, we can apply the product rule:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)g(x)) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x) = (10x)(2x) + (5x^2)(2) = 20x^2 + 10x^2 = 30x^2$\n\nSo, the derivative of the product of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is $\\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)g(x)) = 30x^2$."
