    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular pentagon, we simply multiply the side length by the number of sides. In this case, the side length is 6 cm and there are 5 sides in a pentagon.\n\nPerimeter = side length × number of sides\nPerimeter = 6 cm × 5\nPerimeter = 30 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the pentagon is 30 cm."
