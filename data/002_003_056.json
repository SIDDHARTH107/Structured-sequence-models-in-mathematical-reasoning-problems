    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the surface area of one face, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared (s^2). In this case, the side length is 7 cm.\n\nArea of one face = 7^2 = 49 square centimeters\n\nSince there are 6 faces, we can find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by 6.\n\nTotal surface area = 49 * 6 = 294 square centimeters"
