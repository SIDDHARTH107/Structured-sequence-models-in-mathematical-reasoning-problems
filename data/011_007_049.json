    "message_1": "Suppose you have a population of rabbits. Each month, every pair of rabbits produces a new pair of rabbits. However, each new pair takes one month before they themselves can start producing offspring. If you start with a single pair of rabbits, how many pairs of rabbits will you have after 12 months?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the Fibonacci sequence. In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...\n\nIn this rabbit population problem, the number of rabbit pairs in each month corresponds to the Fibonacci sequence. The first month starts with 1 pair, the second month also has 1 pair (since the first pair has not yet produced offspring), and from the third month onwards, the number of rabbit pairs follows the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nSo, to find the number of rabbit pairs after 12 months, we need to find the 13th number in the Fibonacci sequence (since we start counting from the first month).\n\nUsing the Fibonacci sequence, we can calculate the number of rabbit pairs in the 12th month as follows:\n\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144\n\nAfter 12 months, there will be 144 pairs of rabbits."
