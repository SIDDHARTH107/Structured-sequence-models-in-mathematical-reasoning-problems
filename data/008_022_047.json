    "message_1": "A company manufactures 3 products: A, B, and C. The production of each product requires a certain amount of raw materials. The company has 500 units of raw materials available per day. The production processes also take some time and they can produce a maximum of 400 units of each product in a day. The profit for each unit sold is $2 for product A, $4 for product B, and $5 for product C. Determine how many units of each product the company should manufacture in order to maximize their daily profit if the matrix representing the production process is ill-conditioned.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to know the amount of raw materials required for each product. Since the matrix representing the production process is ill-conditioned, we cannot rely on it to provide accurate information. However, we can still attempt to find a solution using linear programming.\n\nLet x, y, and z represent the number of units of products A, B, and C, respectively. We want to maximize the profit function P = 2x + 4y + 5z, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Raw materials constraint: ax + by + cz ≤ 500 (where a, b, and c are the amounts of raw materials required for each product)\n2. Production capacity constraints: x ≤ 400, y ≤ 400, z ≤ 400\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, z ≥ 0\n\nSince we don't have the exact values for a, b, and c, we cannot provide a specific solution. However, the company should focus on producing the product with the highest profit per unit of raw material, as long as it doesn't exceed the production capacity constraints. In this case, product C has the highest profit per unit, so the company should prioritize its production.\n\nIf more information about the raw materials required for each product is provided, we can use linear programming techniques, such as the simplex method, to find the optimal solution for the number of units of each product to maximize the daily profit."
