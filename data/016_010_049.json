    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the interstices between circles with new circles that are tangent to the surrounding circles. In this case, we start with three non-intersecting circles with radii 1, 2, and 3 units.\n\nTo find the radius of the fourth circle, we can use the Descartes Circle Theorem. The theorem states that if four circles are mutually tangent, then the curvature of each circle (k) is related by the following equation:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n\nThe curvature of a circle is the reciprocal of its radius (k = 1/r). So, for our initial circles, we have:\n\nk1 = 1, k2 = 1/2, k3 = 1/3\n\nWe can now solve for k4:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + k4)^2 = 2(1^2 + (1/2)^2 + (1/3)^2 + k4^2)\n\nSolving for k4, we get:\n\nk4 = 1/6\n\nNow we have four circles with curvatures k1, k2, k3, and k4. To construct the Apollonian gasket, we need to find all possible combinations of three circles and find the new circle that is tangent to them. We can use the same Descartes Circle Theorem to find the new circles.\n\nFor each new circle, we can find its curvature using the following formula:\n\nk_new = k1 + k2 + k3 + 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1)\n\nWe will have the following combinations of initial circles:\n\n1. (k1, k2, k3)\n2. (k1, k2, k4)\n3. (k1, k3, k4)\n4. (k2, k3, k4)\n\nFor each combination, we can find the new circle's curvature and then find its radius (r_new = 1/k_new). However, since the Apollonian gasket is a fractal, it has an infinite number of circles. So, the total number of circles required to construct an Apollonian gasket is infinite."
