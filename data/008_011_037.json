    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing each column with the constant terms (Dx, Dy, Dz).\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 11\n3x + 2y + z = 6\n4x + 5y + 2z = 17\n\nThe coefficient matrix (A) and the constant terms (B) are:\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 3  2  1 |\n    | 4  5  2 |\n\nB = | 11 |\n    |  6 |\n    | 17 |\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of A (D):\n\nD = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 3  2  1 |\n    | 4  5  2 |\n\nD = 2(2*2 - 5*1) - 3(3*2 - 4*1) + 4(3*5 - 4*2)\nD = 2(4 - 5) - 3(6 - 4) + 4(15 - 8)\nD = 2(-1) - 3(2) + 4(7)\nD = -2 - 6 + 28\nD = 20\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the first column of A with B (Dx):\n\nDx = | 11  3  4 |\n     |  6  2  1 |\n     | 17  5  2 |\n\nDx = 11(2*2 - 5*1) - 3(6*2 - 17*1) + 4(6*5 - 17*2)\nDx = 11(4 - 5) - 3(12 - 17) + 4(30 - 34)\nDx = 11(-1) - 3(-5) + 4(-4)\nDx = -11 + 15 - 16\nDx = -12\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the second column of A with B (Dy):\n\nDy = | 2  11  4 |\n     | 3  6   1 |\n     | 4  17  2 |\n\nDy = 2(6*2 - 17*1) - 11(3*2 - 4*1) + 4(3*17 - 4*6)\nDy = 2(12 - 17) - 11(6 - 4) + 4(51 - 24)\nDy = 2(-5) - 11(2) + 4(27)\nDy = -10 - 22 + 108\nDy = 76\n\nFinally, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the third column of A with B (Dz):\n\nDz = | 2  3  11 |\n     | 3  2  6  |\n     | 4  5  17 |\n\nDz = 2(2*17 - 5*6) - 3(3*17 - 4*6) + 11(3*5 - 4*2)\nDz = 2(34 - 30) - 3(51 - 24) + 11(15 - 8)\nDz = 2(4) - 3(27) + 11(7)\nDz = 8 - 81 + 77\nDz = 4\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z using the determinants:\n\nx = Dx / D = -12 / 20 = -3/5\ny = Dy / D = 76 / 20 = 19/5\nz = Dz / D = 4 / 20 = 1/5\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -3/5\ny = 19/5\nz = 1/5"
