    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues, we first need to find the characteristic equation of the matrix A. The characteristic equation is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. \n\nMatrix A - λI is:\n\n[[4 - λ, 1],\n [2, 3 - λ]]\n\nNow, we find the determinant of this matrix:\n\n(4 - λ)(3 - λ) - (1)(2) = 0\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\nλ^2 - 7λ + 10 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can find its roots (eigenvalues) using the quadratic formula:\n\nλ = (7 ± √(7^2 - 4 * 10)) / 2\nλ = (7 ± √(49 - 40)) / 2\nλ = (7 ± √9) / 2\nλ = (7 ± 3) / 2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are:\n\nλ1 = (7 + 3) / 2 = 5\nλ2 = (7 - 3) / 2 = 2\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 5:\n\n(A - λ1I) * x = 0\n\nSubstitute λ1:\n\n[[-1, 1],\n [2, -2]] * x = 0\n\nThe system of equations is:\n\n-1x1 + x2 = 0\n2x1 - 2x2 = 0\n\nSolving the system, we get x1 = x2. Let x1 = 1, then x2 = 1. So, the eigenvector for λ1 is:\n\nv1 = [1, 1]\n\nFor λ2 = 2:\n\n(A - λ2I) * x = 0\n\nSubstitute λ2:\n\n[[2, 1],\n [2, 1]] * x = 0\n\nThe system of equations is:\n\n2x1 + x2 = 0\n2x1 + x2 = 0\n\nSolving the system, we get x2 = -2x1. Let x1 = 1, then x2 = -2. So, the eigenvector for λ2 is:\n\nv2 = [1, -2]\n\nThus, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A are:\n\nEigenvalue λ1 = 5, Eigenvector v1 = [1, 1]\nEigenvalue λ2 = 2, Eigenvector v2 = [1, -2]"
