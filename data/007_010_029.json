    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). \n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given congruences as:\n\nx = 4a + 1 (since x ≡ 1 (mod 4))\ny = 3b + 2 (since y ≡ 2 (mod 3))\n\nNow, we know that x is a multiple of 3, so we can write x as 3c. Similarly, y is a multiple of 5, so we can write y as 5d.\n\nWe have:\n\n3c = 4a + 1\n5d = 3b + 2\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive integer values for a, b, c, and d that satisfy these equations.\n\nLet's start with the first equation:\n\n3c = 4a + 1\n\nWe can try different values of a and see which one gives us a multiple of 3 for the right side of the equation:\n\na = 1: 4(1) + 1 = 5 (not a multiple of 3)\na = 2: 4(2) + 1 = 9 (a multiple of 3)\n\nSo, when a = 2, we get 3c = 9, which means c = 3. Thus, x = 3c = 3(3) = 9.\n\nNow, let's move to the second equation:\n\n5d = 3b + 2\n\nWe can try different values of b and see which one gives us a multiple of 5 for the right side of the equation:\n\nb = 1: 3(1) + 2 = 5 (a multiple of 5)\n\nSo, when b = 1, we get 5d = 5, which means d = 1. Thus, y = 5d = 5(1) = 5.\n\nFinally, the smallest possible positive integer value of x + y is 9 + 5 = 14."
