    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nLet's consider the position function of the truck, s(t), where s(t) represents the distance traveled by the truck at time t. We are given that the truck travels 150 km in 2.5 hours. So, we have:\n\ns(0) = 0 km (initial position)\ns(2.5) = 150 km (final position)\n\nThe average speed of the truck over the interval [0, 2.5] hours is:\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance) / (Total time)\nAverage speed = (150 km) / (2.5 hours) = 60 km/hr\n\nNow, let's apply the Mean Value Theorem. The position function s(t) is continuous and differentiable on the interval [0, 2.5] since it represents the position of a moving truck. According to the MVT, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 2.5) such that:\n\ns'(c) = (s(2.5) - s(0)) / (2.5 - 0)\n\ns'(c) represents the instantaneous speed of the truck at time c. So, we have:\n\nInstantaneous speed at time c = Average speed\ns'(c) = 60 km/hr\n\nTherefore, by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 2.5) hours at which the truck was traveling exactly 60 km/hr."
