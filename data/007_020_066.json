To find the values of 𝜑(𝑛) and 𝑛, we first need to calculate 𝑛 = 𝑝 × 𝑞 and 𝜑(𝑛) = (𝑝 - 1)(𝑞 - 1).\n\nn = p × q = 7 × 11 = 77\n\n𝜑(𝑛) = (𝑝 - 1)(𝑞 - 1) = (7 - 1)(11 - 1) = 6 × 10 = 60\n\nSo, 𝑛 = 77 and 𝜑(𝑛) = 60.\n\n2. We need to choose an integer 𝑒 such that 1 < 𝑒 < 𝜑(𝑛) and 𝑒 is coprime to 𝜑(𝑛). Let's choose 𝑒 = 13, as it is a prime number and does not share any factors with 60.\n\n3. To find the value of 𝑑, we need to solve the equation 𝑒𝑑 ≡ 1 (mod 𝜑(𝑛)). In other words, we need to find the modular inverse of 𝑒 (mod 𝜑(𝑛)).\n\n13𝑑 ≡ 1 (mod 60)\n\nBy trying different values of 𝑑, we find that 𝑑 = 37 satisfies the equation:\n\n13 × 37 = 481 ≡ 1 (mod 60)\n\nSo, 𝑑 = 37.\n\n4. To encrypt the message \"23\" using 𝑒 and 𝑛, we need to calculate the ciphertext 𝑐 using the formula 𝑐 ≡ 𝑚^𝑒 (mod 𝑛), where 𝑚 is the message.\n\n𝑐 ≡ 23^13 (mod 77)\n\nUsing a calculator or modular exponentiation, we find that:\n\n𝑐 ≡ 63 (mod 77)\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"63\".\n\n5.
