    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the powers of its prime factors. In this case, 48 = 2^4 * 3^1.\n\nWe can use the formula for the number of groups of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer. The formula is given by:\n\nNumber of groups of order p^n = (p^(n-1) - p^(n-2)) * (p^(n-2) - p^(n-3)) * ... * (p - 1)\n\nFor the 2^4 part, we have:\n\nNumber of groups of order 2^4 = (2^3 - 2^2) * (2^2 - 2^1) * (2 - 1) = (8 - 4) * (4 - 2) * 1 = 4 * 2 * 1 = 8\n\nFor the 3^1 part, we have:\n\nNumber of groups of order 3^1 = (3 - 1) = 2\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the number of groups of order p^a * q^b, where p and q are distinct prime numbers, and a and b are positive integers:\n\nNumber of groups of order p^a * q^b = (number of groups of order p^a) * (number of groups of order q^b)\n\nIn our case:\n\nNumber of groups of order 48 = (number of groups of order 2^4) * (number of groups of order 3^1) = 8 * 2 = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 possible non-isomorphic groups of order 48.\n\nNow, let's find out how many of them are non-abelian. We know that the cyclic group of order 48, Z_48, is abelian. Also, the direct product of two cyclic groups, Z_16 × Z_3 and Z_8 × Z_6, are abelian as well. This accounts for 3 abelian groups.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-abelian groups of order 48 is:\n\n16 (total non-isomorphic groups) - 3 (abelian groups) = 13\n\nSo, there are 13 non-abelian groups of order 48."
