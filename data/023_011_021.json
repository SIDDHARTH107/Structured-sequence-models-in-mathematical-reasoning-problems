    "message_1": "A signal s(t) is defined as: \n\ns(t) = sin(2π(50)t) + 0.5sin(2π(120)t) \n\nUse the Fourier transform to analyze the signal and determine the frequencies and amplitudes of the two sine waves that make up the signal.",
    "message_2": "The given signal s(t) is already represented as a sum of two sine waves. Therefore, we do not need to apply the Fourier transform to analyze the signal. We can directly read the frequencies and amplitudes of the two sine waves from the given equation.\n\ns(t) = sin(2π(50)t) + 0.5sin(2π(120)t)\n\nThe first sine wave has an amplitude of 1 and a frequency of 50 Hz:\n\nAmplitude_1 = 1\nFrequency_1 = 50 Hz\n\nThe second sine wave has an amplitude of 0.5 and a frequency of 120 Hz:\n\nAmplitude_2 = 0.5\nFrequency_2 = 120 Hz\n\nSo, the two sine waves that make up the signal have amplitudes of 1 and 0.5, and frequencies of 50 Hz and 120 Hz, respectively."
