    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and their opposite angles as A, B, and C, respectively. In this case, let's consider side c to be the longest side (12), and its opposite angle C to be the largest angle. Then, we have:\n\na = 8\nb = 10\nc = 12\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find the measure of angle C:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\n\nPlugging in the values of a, b, and c, we get:\n\ncos(C) = (8^2 + 10^2 - 12^2) / (2 * 8 * 10)\ncos(C) = (64 + 100 - 144) / 160\ncos(C) = 20 / 160\ncos(C) = 1/8\n\nNow, we can find the measure of angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nC = arccos(1/8)\nC ≈ 82.82°\n\nSo, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 82.82°."
