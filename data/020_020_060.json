    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has a rectangular piece of sheet metal with a length of 10 meters and a width of 5 meters. They want to design a storage tank by cutting out identical squares from each corner of the rectangular sheet, bending up the sides, and welding the edges together. What should be the dimensions of each square cut out so that the tank will have a maximum volume?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square cut out from each corner of the rectangular sheet. After cutting out the squares and bending up the sides, the dimensions of the storage tank will be:\n\nLength: 10 - 2x\nWidth: 5 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume V of the storage tank can be calculated as:\n\nV = (10 - 2x)(5 - 2x)x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the volume function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndV/dx = (10 - 2x)(5 - 2x)(1) + (10 - 2x)(-2)(x) + (5 - 2x)(-2)(x)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\ndV/dx = -12x^2 + 40x - 20\n\nNow, set dV/dx equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = -12x^2 + 40x - 20\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = -12, b = 40, and c = -20:\n\nx = (-40 ± √(40^2 - 4(-12)(-20))) / 2(-12)\nx = (-40 ± √(1600 - 960)) / (-24)\nx = (-40 ± √640) / (-24)\nx ≈ 0.8333 or x ≈ 4\n\nSince x represents the side length of the square cut out from each corner, it cannot be greater than half of the width (5 meters) of the sheet metal. Therefore, x ≈ 4 is not a valid solution.\n\nSo, the dimensions of each square cut out should be approximately 0.8333 meters by 0.8333 meters to maximize the volume of the storage tank."
