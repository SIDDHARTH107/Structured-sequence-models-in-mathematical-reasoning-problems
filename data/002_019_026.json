    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 5 cm and a slant height of 12 cm. What is the surface area of the cone?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the circular base and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. In this case, the radius of the base is 5 cm.\n\nA_base = π(5^2) = 25π square centimeters\n\nThe formula for the lateral surface area of a cone is A_lateral = πrs, where r is the radius and s is the slant height. In this case, the radius is 5 cm and the slant height is 12 cm.\n\nA_lateral = π(5)(12) = 60π square centimeters\n\nNow, we add the two areas together to find the total surface area of the cone:\n\nSurface area = A_base + A_lateral = 25π + 60π = 85π square centimeters\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is 85π square centimeters."
