    "message_1": "A drug company conducted a study to determine if their new medication reduces the risk of heart attacks in patients with high blood pressure. The study showed that out of 800 patients who took the medication, only 32 had heart attacks, while out of 400 patients who did not take the medication, 40 had heart attacks. Calculate the absolute risk reduction of taking the medication in percentage.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the absolute risk reduction, we first need to find the risk of heart attacks in both groups.\n\nFor the group that took the medication:\nRisk = (Number of heart attacks) / (Total number of patients)\nRisk = 32 / 800 = 0.04 or 4%\n\nFor the group that did not take the medication:\nRisk = (Number of heart attacks) / (Total number of patients)\nRisk = 40 / 400 = 0.1 or 10%\n\nNow, we can calculate the absolute risk reduction:\nAbsolute Risk Reduction = Risk in the non-medicated group - Risk in the medicated group\nAbsolute Risk Reduction = 10% - 4% = 6%\n\nSo, the absolute risk reduction of taking the medication is 6%."
