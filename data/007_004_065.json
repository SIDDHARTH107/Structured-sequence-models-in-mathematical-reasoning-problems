    "message_2": "The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 54 and 96 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (96) by the smaller number (54) and find the remainder.\n   96 รท 54 = 1 (remainder 42)\n\n2. Replace the larger number (96) with the smaller number (54) and the smaller number with the remainder (42).\n   GCD(54, 42)\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n   54 รท 42 = 1 (remainder 12)\n   GCD(42, 12)\n\n   42 รท 12 = 3 (remainder 6)\n   GCD(12, 6)\n\n   12 รท 6 = 2 (remainder 0)\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 6. So, the GCD of 54 and 96 is 6."
