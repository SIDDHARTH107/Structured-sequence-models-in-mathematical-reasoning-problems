    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 6 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of order p, where p is a prime number, is always cyclic.\n2. If a group has an element of order 6, it is isomorphic to C6.\n3. If a group has elements of order 2 and 3, it is isomorphic to D3.\n\nLet G be a group of order 6 with the operation *. Since 6 = 2 * 3, where 2 and 3 are prime numbers, by the Sylow theorems, G has a subgroup of order 2 and a subgroup of order 3.\n\nLet H be a subgroup of order 2, and K be a subgroup of order 3. Then, there exist elements a ∈ H and b ∈ K such that the order of a is 2 and the order of b is 3.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 6.\nSuppose there exists an element c ∈ G such that the order of c is 6. Then, the cyclic group generated by c, ⟨c⟩, has 6 elements. Since G also has 6 elements, G = ⟨c⟩, and G is isomorphic to C6.\n\nCase 2: G does not have an element of order 6.\nIn this case, the order of every element in G must be either 1, 2, or 3. The identity element e has order 1. We already have elements a and b with orders 2 and 3, respectively.\n\nNow, consider the element ab ∈ G. Since a and b are from different subgroups H and K, they commute, i.e., ab = ba. The order of ab cannot be 1, as it would imply ab = e, which is not possible as a ≠ e and b ≠ e.\n\nIf the order of ab is 2, then (ab)^2 = e, which implies aba = b. Since a has order 2, a^(-1) = a, and we get abab = bb, which implies ab = b, a contradiction as a and b are distinct elements.\n\nTherefore, the order of ab must be 3. Then, G has elements of order 2 (a) and 3 (b and ab). Since G has 6 elements, G = {e, a, b, b^2, ab, ab^2}. The group operation table for G will be consistent with the dihedral group D3. Thus, G is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIn conclusion, a group G of order 6 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
