    "message_2": "The temporal logic formula $\\Box(p\\rightarrow q)$ means that for all future states, if $p$ is true, then $q$ must also be true. We are given that $p$ is true in states $s_1, s_3, s_4$ and $q$ is true in states $s_1, s_2, s_4$. Let's analyze the truth value of the formula in each state:\n\n1. State $s_1$: Since $p$ is true and $q$ is also true, the implication $p\\rightarrow q$ is true. As there are no future states where $p$ is true and $q$ is false, the formula $\\Box(p\\rightarrow q)$ is true in state $s_1$.\n\n2. State $s_2$: In this state, $p$ is false and $q$ is true. The formula $p\\rightarrow q$ is true in this state because an implication is true when the antecedent is false. Since there are no future states where $p$ is true and $q$ is false, the formula $\\Box(p\\rightarrow q)$ is true in state $s_2$.\n\n3. State $s_3$: In this state, $p$ is true and $q$ is false. The implication $p\\rightarrow q$ is false in this state. However, there are no future states where $p$ is true and $q$ is false, so the formula $\\Box(p\\rightarrow q)$ is true in state $s_3$.\n\n4. State $s_4$: In this state, both $p$ and $q$ are true, so the implication $p\\rightarrow q$ is true. As there are no future states where $p$ is true and $q$ is false, the formula $\\Box(p\\rightarrow q)$ is true in state $s_4$.\n\nIn conclusion, the temporal logic formula $\\Box(p\\rightarrow q)$ is true in all states $s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4$."
