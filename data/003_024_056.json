    "message_2": "To find the scalar projection of vector 𝑣 onto 𝑢, we need to find the dot product of 𝑣 and 𝑢, and then divide it by the magnitude of 𝑢.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of 𝑣 and 𝑢:\n𝑣 • 𝑢 = (4 * -3) + (-7 * 5) = -12 - 35 = -47\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of 𝑢:\n||𝑢|| = √((-3)^2 + (5)^2) = √(9 + 25) = √34\n\nNow, let's find the scalar projection of 𝑣 onto 𝑢:\nscalar projection = (𝑣 • 𝑢) / ||𝑢|| = -47 / √34 ≈ -8.05"
