    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P, we need to diagonalize the matrix A. We can do this by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.\n\nFirst, let's find the eigenvalues of A. We need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[2 - λ, 1], [-1, 4 - λ]]\n\ndet(A - λI) = (2 - λ)(4 - λ) - (-1)(1) = λ^2 - 6λ + 8 - 1 = λ^2 - 6λ + 7\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the characteristic polynomial:\n\nλ^2 - 6λ + 7 = 0\n\n(λ - 1)(λ - 7) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 7.\n\nNext, let's find the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues.\n\nFor λ1 = 1:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n([[1, 1], [-1, 3]])([x1, x2]) = [0, 0]\n\nFrom the first row, we get x1 + x2 = 0, so x2 = -x1. Let x1 = 1, then x2 = -1. So, the eigenvector v1 = [1, -1].\n\nFor λ2 = 7:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n([[-5, 1], [-1, -3]])([x1, x2]) = [0, 0]\n\nFrom the first row, we get -5x1 + x2 = 0, so x2 = 5x1. Let x1 = 1, then x2 = 5. So, the eigenvector v2 = [1, 5].\n\nNow, we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = [[1, 1], [-1, 5]]\n\nThe inverse of P is:\n\nP^-1 = (1/6)[[5, -1], [1, 1]]\n\nAnd the diagonal matrix D is formed using the eigenvalues:\n\nD = [[1, 0], [0, 7]]\n\nNow, let's check if P^-1AP = D:\n\nP^-1AP = (1/6)[[5, -1], [1, 1]] * [[2, 1], [-1, 4]] * [[1, 1], [-1, 5]]\n\nP^-1AP = (1/6)[[5, -1], [1, 1]] * [[3, 6], [-2, 19]]\n\nP^-1AP = (1/6)[[11, 1], [1, 25]]\n\nP^-1AP = [[1, 0], [0, 7]]\n\nSo, P^-1AP = D, as required."
