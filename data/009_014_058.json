    "message_1": "A certain population of bacteria is growing at a rate proportional to the number of bacteria present, with a growth constant of 0.8. If the initial population is 100 bacteria, what will be the size of the population after 24 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential growth:\n\nP(t) = P0 * e^(kt)\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, P0 is the initial population, k is the growth constant, and t is the time in hours.\n\nGiven the initial population P0 = 100 bacteria, the growth constant k = 0.8, and the time t = 24 hours, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(24) = 100 * e^(0.8 * 24)\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of e^(0.8 * 24):\n\ne^(0.8 * 24) ≈ e^19.2 ≈ 203392.472\n\nFinally, we can multiply this value by the initial population to find the population after 24 hours:\n\nP(24) = 100 * 203392.472 ≈ 20,339,247.2\n\nAfter 24 hours, the size of the population will be approximately 20,339,247 bacteria."
