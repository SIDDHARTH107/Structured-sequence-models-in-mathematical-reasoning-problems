    "message_1": "A construction company is building a metal storage container that needs to have a volume of 50 cubic meters. They want to minimize the cost of materials by using the least amount of metal possible. The container will have a rectangular base and a fixed height of 2 meters. What are the dimensions of the container that will minimize the cost of materials?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of materials, we need to minimize the surface area of the container while maintaining a volume of 50 cubic meters. Let the length, width, and height of the container be l, w, and h, respectively. We are given that h = 2 meters.\n\nFirst, we'll find the relationship between the volume and the dimensions:\nV = lwh\n50 = l * w * 2\n\nNow, we'll solve for one of the dimensions, say w:\nw = 50 / (2l)\nw = 25 / l\n\nNext, we'll find the surface area of the container:\nA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nSubstitute the expression for w in terms of l:\nA = 2l(25 / l) + 2l(2) + 2(25 / l)(2)\nA = 50 + 4l + 100 / l\n\nNow, we'll minimize the surface area A by taking the derivative with respect to l and setting it equal to 0:\ndA/dl = 4 - 100 / l^2\n\nSet dA/dl = 0 and solve for l:\n0 = 4 - 100 / l^2\n100 / l^2 = 4\nl^2 = 100 / 4\nl^2 = 25\nl = 5 (since l must be positive)\n\nNow, we'll find the corresponding width w:\nw = 25 / l\nw = 25 / 5\nw = 5\n\nSo, the dimensions that will minimize the cost of materials are length = 5 meters, width = 5 meters, and height = 2 meters."
