    "message_1": "A plane is flying due west with a velocity of 400 km/h. A wind is blowing southwest with a velocity of 100 km/h. What is the resultant velocity of the plane? Use trigonometry to solve.",
    "message_2": "To find the resultant velocity of the plane, we need to break down the wind's velocity into its westward and southward components and then add the westward component to the plane's westward velocity.\n\nSince the wind is blowing southwest, it is blowing at a 45-degree angle to the westward and southward directions. We can use trigonometry to find the westward and southward components of the wind's velocity.\n\nLet Vw be the westward component of the wind's velocity and Vs be the southward component of the wind's velocity.\n\nVw = 100 * cos(45°)\nVs = 100 * sin(45°)\n\nUsing the fact that cos(45°) = sin(45°) = √2 / 2:\n\nVw = 100 * (√2 / 2) = 50√2 km/h\nVs = 100 * (√2 / 2) = 50√2 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the resultant velocity of the plane by adding the westward component of the wind's velocity to the plane's westward velocity:\n\nResultant westward velocity = Plane's westward velocity + Wind's westward component\nResultant westward velocity = 400 km/h + 50√2 km/h ≈ 470.71 km/h\n\nThe southward component of the wind's velocity remains unchanged, as there is no southward velocity from the plane itself:\n\nResultant southward velocity = Wind's southward component = 50√2 km/h ≈ 70.71 km/h\n\nNow we can find the magnitude of the resultant velocity using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nResultant velocity = √(Resultant westward velocity² + Resultant southward velocity²)\nResultant velocity = √((470.71 km/h)² + (70.71 km/h)²) ≈ 475.34 km/h\n\nSo, the resultant velocity of the plane is approximately 475.34 km/h."
