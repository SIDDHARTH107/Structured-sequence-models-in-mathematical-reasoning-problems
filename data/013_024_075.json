    "message_1": "In a volunteer organization, there are 5 members who can do a particular task. All members incur a cost of $20 for doing the task, but if only one member does it, they will get a reward of $100. If more than one member does the task, the reward will be divided equally among them. If no member does the task, there will be no reward but also no cost incurred. What is the best strategy for the members to maximize their rewards?",
    "message_2": "The best strategy for the members to maximize their rewards is to use a random selection process to choose one member to do the task. This way, the chosen member will get the $100 reward, and the cost incurred will be $20. The net gain for the group will be $80 ($100 reward - $20 cost).\n\nIf more than one member does the task, the reward will be divided equally among them, and the total cost will increase, reducing the net gain for the group. For example, if two members do the task, the reward will be $50 each, and the total cost will be $40 ($20 x 2), resulting in a net gain of $60.\n\nIf no member does the task, there will be no reward and no cost, resulting in a net gain of $0.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to randomly select one member to do the task, maximizing the net gain for the group at $80."
