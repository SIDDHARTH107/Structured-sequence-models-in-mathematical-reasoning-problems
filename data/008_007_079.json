    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A. \n\nMatrix A:\n((2, -1, 0),\n (5, 1, 0),\n (4, -1, 1))\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (A - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\n|A - λI| = |((2-λ, -1, 0), (5, 1-λ, 0), (4, -1, 1-λ)|\n\nComputing the determinant, we get:\n\n(2-λ)[(1-λ)(1-λ)] - (-1)(-5) = 0\n(2-λ)(λ^2 - 2λ + 1) - 5 = 0\n(λ^2 - 2λ - 1)(λ - 2) = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation, we get the eigenvalues:\nλ1 = 1 + √2\nλ2 = 1 - √2\nλ3 = 2\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors:\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFor λ1 = 1 + √2:\n(A - λ1I)v = ((1-√2, -1, 0), (5, -√2, 0), (4, -1, -√2))v = 0\nRow reducing to echelon form, we get:\n((1, -1, 0), (0, 1, -√2), (0, 0, 0))\nThe eigenvector v1 = (1, 1, √2)\n\nFor λ2 = 1 - √2:\n(A - λ2I)v = ((1+√2, -1, 0), (5, √2, 0), (4, -1, √2))v = 0\nRow reducing to echelon form, we get:\n((1, -1, 0), (0, 1, √2), (0, 0, 0))\nThe eigenvector v2 = (1, 1, -√2)\n\nFor λ3 = 2:\n(A - λ3I)v = ((0, -1, 0), (5, -1, 0), (4, -1, -1))v = 0\nRow reducing to echelon form, we get:\n((1, -1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 0))\nThe eigenvector v3 = (1, 1, 0)\n\n3. Form the matrices D and P:\nNow that we have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can form the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P.\n\nMatrix D is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues on the diagonal:\nD = ((1+√2, 0, 0),\n     (0, 1-√2, 0),\n     (0, 0, 2))\n\nMatrix P is formed by placing the eigenvectors as columns:\nP = ((1, 1, 1),\n     (1, 1, 1),\n     (√2, -√2, 0))\n\nNow we have D and P such that D = P^(-1)AP."
