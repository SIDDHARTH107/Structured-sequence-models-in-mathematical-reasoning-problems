    "message_1": "In a school with 450 students, it is known that 40% of them are expected to pass a certain math test. What is the probability that out of a random sample of 60 students from this school, at least 25 students will pass the test?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success in a single trial (in this case, 40% or 0.4)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 60 students)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 25 students passing)\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 25 students passing, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 25 to k = 60.\n\nP(X >= 25) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 25 to 60\n\nWe can calculate this using the binomial probability formula for each value of k and summing the results:\n\nP(X >= 25) = P(X = 25) + P(X = 26) + ... + P(X = 60)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the binomial probabilities and sum them, we get:\n\nP(X >= 25) ≈ 0.959\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25 students will pass the test in a random sample of 60 students from this school is approximately 0.959 or 95.9%."
