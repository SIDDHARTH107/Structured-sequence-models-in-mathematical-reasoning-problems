    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curve y = x^2, the x-axis, and the vertical lines x = 1 and x = 3, we need to integrate the function y = x^2 with respect to x from x = 1 to x = 3.\n\nThe integral of x^2 with respect to x is (x^3)/3 + C, where C is the constant of integration. However, since we are finding a definite integral, we don't need to worry about the constant.\n\nSo, we need to evaluate the integral from x = 1 to x = 3:\n\nArea = [(x^3)/3] evaluated from 1 to 3\nArea = [(3^3)/3 - (1^3)/3]\nArea = [(27)/3 - (1)/3]\nArea = [26/3]\n\nTherefore, the area bounded by the curve y = x^2, the x-axis, and the vertical lines x = 1 and x = 3 is 26/3 square units."
