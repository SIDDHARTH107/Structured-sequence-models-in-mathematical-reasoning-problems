    "message_2": "To find the value of the constant $a$, we first need to analyze the singular points of the curve C. Singular points occur when both the partial derivatives with respect to x and y are zero, and the Hessian determinant is also zero.\n\nLet $F(x, y, z) = y^2z + xy^2 + x^3 + az^4$. Then, we have the following partial derivatives:\n\n$F_x = 3x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$\n$F_y = 2yz + x^2 + 2xy$\n$F_z = y^2 + 4az^3$\n\nNow, we need to find the points where $F_x = F_y = F_z = 0$. From $F_z = 0$, we have two cases:\n\n1) $y = 0$ and $z \\neq 0$: In this case, $F_x = 3x^2$ and $F_y = x^2$. Since $F_x = F_y = 0$, we have $x = 0$. So, the point is $(0, 0, 1)$.\n\n2) $z = 0$ and $y \\neq 0$: In this case, $F_x = 3x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$ and $F_y = x^2 + 2xy$. Since $F_x = F_y = 0$, we have $x = -\\frac{1}{2}y$. Substituting this into the curve equation, we get $y^3(1 - 2a) = 0$. So, either $y = 0$ (which contradicts our assumption) or $1 - 2a = 0$.\n\nNow, let's compute the Hessian matrix of F:\n\n$H(F) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6x + 2y & 2x + 2y & 0 \\\\\n2x + 2y & 2z + 2x & 2y \\\\\n0 & 2y & 12az^2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe Hessian determinant is given by:\n\n$H(F) = (6x + 2y)(2z + 2x)(12az^2) - (2x + 2y)^3$\n\nNow, we need to find the points where the Hessian determinant is zero:\n\n1) For the point $(0, 0, 1)$, the Hessian determinant is zero.\n\n2) For the points with $z = 0$, we have $H(F) = -8y^3(1 - 2a)^2$. Since we want the curve to have exactly one node and two cusps, we need the Hessian determinant to be zero for exactly three points. Thus, we must have $1 - 2a = 0$, which gives $a = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSo, the value of the constant $a$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$ for the curve C to have exactly one node and two cusps."
