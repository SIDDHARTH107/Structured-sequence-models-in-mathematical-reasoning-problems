    "message_1": "According to historical data, the probability of a certain stock increasing in value by $1.50 per share within a week is 0.38. If a person invests $10,000 in this stock, what is the expected value of the investment in a week?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value of the investment in a week, we first need to determine how many shares the person can buy with their $10,000 investment. Then, we'll calculate the expected increase in value per share and multiply that by the number of shares.\n\n1. Calculate the number of shares:\nAssuming the current price of the stock is P dollars per share, the person can buy N shares with their $10,000 investment, where N = 10,000 / P.\n\n2. Calculate the expected increase in value per share:\nThe probability of the stock increasing in value by $1.50 per share within a week is 0.38. The probability of the stock not increasing in value by $1.50 per share within a week is 1 - 0.38 = 0.62. Therefore, the expected increase in value per share is:\n(0.38 * $1.50) + (0.62 * $0) = $0.57.\n\n3. Calculate the expected value of the investment in a week:\nThe expected value of the investment in a week is the expected increase in value per share multiplied by the number of shares:\nExpected value = N * $0.57 = (10,000 / P) * $0.57.\n\nSince we don't know the current price of the stock (P), we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the expected value of the investment in a week. However, we can express it as a function of P:\nExpected value = (10,000 / P) * $0.57."
