    "message_1": "Consider the matrix A = [[2, 1], [1, 3]]. Using the power iteration method, find the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector of A with an initial vector of [1,1]. Round your answer to 3 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector using the power iteration method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial vector, in this case, [1, 1].\n2. Multiply the matrix A by the initial vector.\n3. Normalize the resulting vector.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\n\nLet's perform the power iteration method:\n\nInitial vector: v0 = [1, 1]\n\nIteration 1:\nA * v0 = [[2, 1], [1, 3]] * [1, 1] = [3, 4]\nNormalize: v1 = [3/5, 4/5] = [0.6, 0.8]\n\nIteration 2:\nA * v1 = [[2, 1], [1, 3]] * [0.6, 0.8] = [1.6, 2.8]\nNormalize: v2 = [1.6/3.2, 2.8/3.2] = [0.5, 0.875]\n\nIteration 3:\nA * v2 = [[2, 1], [1, 3]] * [0.5, 0.875] = [1.375, 2.625]\nNormalize: v3 = [1.375/3, 2.625/3] = [0.458, 0.875]\n\nIteration 4:\nA * v3 = [[2, 1], [1, 3]] * [0.458, 0.875] = [1.333, 2.667]\nNormalize: v4 = [1.333/3, 2.667/3] = [0.444, 0.889]\n\nAt this point, the eigenvector is converging, and we can stop the iterations. The dominant eigenvector is approximately [0.444, 0.889].\n\nTo find the dominant eigenvalue, we can use the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nλ = (v4^T * A * v4) / (v4^T * v4)\n\nλ = ([0.444, 0.889] * [[2, 1], [1, 3]] * [0.444, 0.889]) / ([0.444, 0.889] * [0.444, 0.889])\n\nλ ≈ 3.111\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue is approximately 3.111, and its corresponding eigenvector is [0.444, 0.889]. Both values are rounded to 3 decimal places."
