    "message_2": "To compute the intersection number of the divisors $D_1$ and $D_2$ on the variety defined by the polynomial equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0$, we will first find the points of intersection between the divisors and the variety, and then compute the intersection multiplicity at each point.\n\nFirst, let's find the points of intersection between the variety and the divisors:\n\n1. Intersection of $D_1$ with the variety:\n\nSince $D_1$ is defined by $x = 0$, we substitute $x = 0$ into the polynomial equation of the variety:\n\n$0^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3(0)(y)(z) = y^3 + z^3 = 0$\n\nThis equation can be factored as $(y+z)(y^2 - yz + z^2) = 0$. So, the intersection points are given by either $y = -z$ or $y^2 - yz + z^2 = 0$. \n\nFor $y = -z$, we have the point $(0, y, -y)$ for any $y \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nFor $y^2 - yz + z^2 = 0$, we can solve for $z$ in terms of $y$:\n\n$z(y-z) = y^2 \\Rightarrow z = \\frac{y^2}{y-z}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation $y = z$, we get $y = \\frac{y^2}{y-z}$, which simplifies to $y^2 = y^2 - y^3$. This gives us $y^3 = 0$, so $y = 0$. Thus, we have the point $(0, 0, 0)$.\n\n2. Intersection of $D_2$ with the variety:\n\nSince $D_2$ is defined by $y = z$, we substitute $y = z$ into the polynomial equation of the variety:\n\n$x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = x^3 + 2y^3 - 3xy^2 = 0$\n\nNow, let's compute the intersection multiplicities at each point:\n\n1. Intersection multiplicity at $(0, y, -y)$:\n\nWe need to compute the order of vanishing of the polynomial equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz$ at the point $(0, y, -y)$. Since $x = 0$, the equation becomes $y^3 - y^3 = 0$, which is identically zero. Thus, the intersection multiplicity at this point is infinite.\n\n2. Intersection multiplicity at $(0, 0, 0)$:\n\nWe need to compute the order of vanishing of the polynomial equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz$ at the point $(0, 0, 0)$. Since all terms in the equation vanish at this point, the intersection multiplicity is at least 1. To determine the exact multiplicity, we can compute the partial derivatives of the polynomial equation with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz) = 3x^2 - 3yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz) = 3y^2 - 3xz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} (x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz) = 3z^2 - 3xy$\n\nAt the point $(0, 0, 0)$, all these partial derivatives vanish, so the intersection multiplicity is at least 2. However, since the variety is a cubic, the intersection multiplicity cannot be greater than 3. Thus, the intersection multiplicity at $(0, 0, 0)$ is 2.\n\nNow, we can compute the intersection number of the divisors $D_1$ and $D_2$ on the variety:\n\nIntersection number = $\\sum_{i} m_i = \\infty + 2 = \\infty$\n\nThus, the intersection number of the divisors $D_1$ and $D_2$ on the variety is infinite."
