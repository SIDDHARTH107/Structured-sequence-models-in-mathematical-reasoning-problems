    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, player 1 is given $100 to split with player 2. Player 1 decides to keep $75 for themselves and gives $25 to player 2. If the players were to play this game 100 times, what is the expected total amount of money that player 2 would receive?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, player 1 decides the split, and in this case, they have decided to give $25 to player 2. If they play the game 100 times, and the split remains the same each time, then player 2 would receive $25 in each game.\n\nTo find the expected total amount of money player 2 would receive after 100 games, simply multiply the amount they receive per game by the number of games:\n\n$25 per game * 100 games = $2500\n\nSo, player 2 would be expected to receive a total of $2500 after playing the Dictator Game 100 times."
