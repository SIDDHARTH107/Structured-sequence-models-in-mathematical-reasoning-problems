In a particular substitution cipher, the letter \"A\" is always replaced with the letter \"D\", while the other letters remain the same.

Since \"A\" is replaced with \"D\", we can assume that the substitution is a simple Caesar cipher with a shift of 3 positions back in the alphabet. \n\nSo, we will shift each letter in the encrypted message 3 positions back:\n\nD -> A\nl -> i\nr -> o\nr -> o\nk -> h\n(space remains the same)\nz -> w\nr -> o\nu -> r\no -> l\ng -> d\n\nThe decrypted message is: \"Alooh world\"."
