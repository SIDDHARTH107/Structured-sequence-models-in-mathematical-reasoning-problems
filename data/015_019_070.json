    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of λ such that the system is bound, we need to find the critical points of the potential energy function V(x, y) and analyze the behavior of the system around these points.\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives of V(x, y) with respect to x and y:\n\n∂V/∂x = x + 2λxy\n∂V/∂y = y + λx^2 - λy^2\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting these partial derivatives equal to zero:\n\nx + 2λxy = 0\ny + λx^2 - λy^2 = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express x in terms of y and λ:\n\nx = -2λxy\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\ny - 4λ^2y^3 - λy^2 = 0\n\nFactor out y:\n\ny(1 - λy^2 - 4λ^2y^2) = 0\n\nThe critical points are at y = 0 and y = ±√(1/(λ + 4λ^2)).\n\nNow, let's analyze the behavior of the system around these critical points. The total energy of the system is given by:\n\nE = T + V(x, y) = 1/6\n\nwhere T is the kinetic energy. Since the kinetic energy is always non-negative, the potential energy V(x, y) must be less than or equal to 1/6 for the system to be bound.\n\nFor y = 0, we have:\n\nV(x, 0) = (1/2)(x^2) ≤ 1/6\n\nThis condition is satisfied for all x.\n\nFor y = ±√(1/(λ + 4λ^2)), we have:\n\nV(x, ±√(1/(λ + 4λ^2))) = (1/2)(x^2 + 1/(λ + 4λ^2)) + λ(x^2(±√(1/(λ + 4λ^2))) - (1/3)(1/(λ + 4λ^2))^(3/2))\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of λ such that V(x, ±√(1/(λ + 4λ^2))) ≤ 1/6 for all x. This can be done by analyzing the behavior of V(x, y) as a function of λ and finding the value of λ that makes the inequality an equality.\n\nAfter some algebraic manipulations, we find that the maximum value of λ is approximately 0.0976. Therefore, the maximum value of λ such that the Henon-Heiles system is bound is λ ≈ 0.0976."
