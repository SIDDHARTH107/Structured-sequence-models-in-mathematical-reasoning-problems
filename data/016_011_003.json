    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of a self-similar fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, after each iteration, the square is divided into 3x3 smaller squares, and 5 of them are filled (the center square and the four corner squares). So, N = 5, and the scaling factor s = 3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.46497\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal after the 4th iteration is approximately 1.46497. Note that the dimension remains the same for all iterations of the Vicsek fractal, as it is a property of the fractal itself and not dependent on the number of iterations."
