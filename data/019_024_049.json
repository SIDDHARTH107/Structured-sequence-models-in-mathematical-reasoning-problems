    "message_2": "To find the missing number, we can look for a pattern in the given sequence. Let's analyze the differences between consecutive numbers:\n\n5 - 2 = 3\n11 - 5 = 6\n\nNow, let's try to find a pattern in these differences. The difference between 6 and 3 is 3. If we continue this pattern, the next difference should be 3 more than the previous difference, which is 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nSo, the missing number in the sequence should be 11 + 9 = 20. The complete sequence is:\n\n2, 5, 11, 20, 23, 29."
