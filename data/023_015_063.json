    "message_1": "A piano string is fixed at both ends and has a length of 2 meters. If the string is initially plucked at the middle to produce a triangular wave with a maximum amplitude of 0.5 cm, find the Fourier series of the wave and the fundamental frequency.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the triangular wave, we first need to define the wave function. Since the string is plucked at the middle, the wave function can be defined as a piecewise function:\n\nf(x) = x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1\nf(x) = 2 - x for 1 < x ≤ 2\n\nThe wave function is periodic with a period of 2 meters.\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier series representation of the wave function. The Fourier series of a periodic function f(x) with period L is given by:\n\nf(x) = a0/2 + Σ[an*cos(nπx/L) + bn*sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere an and bn are the Fourier coefficients, given by:\n\nan = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L)]dx from 0 to L\nbn = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)]dx from 0 to L\n\nFor the given wave function, a0 = 0 (since the function is odd), and we need to find the bn coefficients. Since the wave function is defined piecewise, we need to compute the bn coefficients separately for each piece:\n\nFor 0 ≤ x ≤ 1:\nbn = (1/2) * ∫[x * sin(nπx/2)]dx from 0 to 1\n\nFor 1 < x ≤ 2:\nbn = (1/2) * ∫[(2 - x) * sin(nπx/2)]dx from 1 to 2\n\nAfter integrating and summing the two parts, we get:\n\nbn = (8/((nπ)^2)) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) for odd n\nbn = 0 for even n\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of the wave function:\n\nf(x) = Σ[((8/((nπ)^2)) * (-1)^((n-1)/2)) * sin(nπx/2)] for odd n\n\nTo find the fundamental frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nfundamental frequency = v / (2L)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the wave on the string and L is the length of the string. The speed of the wave on the string depends on the tension and linear density of the string, which are not given in the problem. However, we can express the fundamental frequency in terms of the speed:\n\nfundamental frequency = v / (2 * 2) = v / 4\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the triangular wave is given by the sum of the odd harmonics with coefficients bn, and the fundamental frequency is v/4, where v is the speed of the wave on the string."
