    "message_2": "There are four distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30. We can classify them as follows:\n\n1. The cyclic group of order 30: C_30\nThis group has 30 elements, and its structure is generated by a single element of order 30. It is isomorphic to the group Z_30 (the additive group of integers modulo 30).\n\n2. The dihedral group of order 30: D_15\nThis group consists of the symmetries of a regular 15-gon, including 15 rotations and 15 reflections. It has 30 elements and is generated by a rotation of order 15 and a reflection of order 2. The group presentation is given by D_15 = ⟨r, s | r^15 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(-1)⟩.\n\n3. The semidirect product of C_5 and C_6: C_5 ⋊ C_6\nThis group has 30 elements and is a non-abelian group. It is formed by taking the direct product of C_5 and C_6 and then applying a non-trivial homomorphism from C_6 to the automorphism group of C_5 (which is isomorphic to C_4). The group presentation is given by C_5 ⋊ C_6 = ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^6 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^2⟩.\n\n4. The semidirect product of C_3 and C_10: C_3 ⋊ C_10\nThis group has 30 elements and is also a non-abelian group. It is formed by taking the direct product of C_3 and C_10 and then applying a non-trivial homomorphism from C_10 to the automorphism group of C_3 (which is isomorphic to C_2). The group presentation is given by C_3 ⋊ C_10 = ⟨a, b | a^3 = b^10 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^(-1)⟩.\n\nThese are the four distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30."
