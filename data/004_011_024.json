    "message_2": "Let V be the volume of the water in the tank, h be the depth of the water, and r be the radius of the water surface at depth h. We are given that dV/dt = 3 cubic meters per minute, and we want to find dh/dt when h = 5 meters.\n\nFirst, we need to find the relationship between r and h. Since the tank is in the shape of a cone, we can use similar triangles to find the ratio of r to h:\n\nr/h = 4/6\nr = (2/3)h\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the water in the tank using the formula for the volume of a cone:\n\nV = (1/3)πr^2h\n\nSubstitute r = (2/3)h into the volume formula:\n\nV = (1/3)π((2/3)h)^2h\nV = (1/3)π(4/9)h^3\nV = (4/9)πh^3\n\nNow, we can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = (4/9)π(3h^2)(dh/dt)\n\nWe are given that dV/dt = 3 cubic meters per minute, so:\n\n3 = (4/9)π(3h^2)(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we want to find dh/dt when h = 5 meters. Substitute h = 5 into the equation:\n\n3 = (4/9)π(3(5)^2)(dh/dt)\n\nNow, solve for dh/dt:\n\n3 = (4/9)π(75)(dh/dt)\n3 = 100π(dh/dt)/3\ndh/dt = 9/(100π)\n\nSo, the depth of the water in the tank is increasing at a rate of 9/(100π) meters per minute when the water is 5 meters deep."
