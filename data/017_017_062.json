    "message_2": "A group of order 30 can be factored as 2 * 3 * 5. By Sylow's theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The possible divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. The only divisors that satisfy the congruence condition are 1 and 6. \n\nNow, we consider the group structures of those subgroups. Since the order of the subgroups is 5, which is a prime number, the subgroups must be cyclic. Therefore, the group structures of the subgroups of order 5 are isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 5, denoted as C_5 or Z_5.\n\nIn summary, there can be either 1 or 6 subgroups of order 5 in a group of order 30, and the corresponding group structures of those subgroups are isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 5 (C_5 or Z_5)."
