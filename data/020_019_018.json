Here's a problem for a math student to solve related to optimal control:\n\nA rocket is launched from Earth and its altitude over time can be modeled by the equation: \n\nh(t) = -16t^2 + 800t\n\nAssume that the rocket has a maximum fuel capacity of 10,000 gallons and that it burns fuel at a rate of 200 gallons per second. Determine the optimal time to cut off fuel to the rocket to maximize its altitude.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal time to cut off fuel to maximize altitude, we need to find the maximum point of the altitude function h(t) = -16t^2 + 800t. We can do this by finding the vertex of the parabola.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola in the form f(t) = at^2 + bt + c is given by the formula:\n\nt_vertex = -b / (2a)\n\nIn our case, a = -16 and b = 800, so:\n\nt_vertex = -800 / (2 * -16) = 800 / 32 = 25 seconds\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the fuel constraint. The rocket has a maximum fuel capacity of 10,000 gallons and burns fuel at a rate of 200 gallons per second. To find out how long the rocket can burn fuel, we can calculate:\n\nt_fuel = 10000 / 200 = 50 seconds\n\nSince the optimal time to cut off fuel to maximize altitude (25 seconds) is less than the time it takes to burn all the fuel (50 seconds), we can conclude that the optimal time to cut off fuel to the rocket to maximize its altitude is 25 seconds."
