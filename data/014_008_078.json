    "message_1": "Suppose you have a block cipher algorithm that operates on blocks of 64 bits, and each block has 16 rounds of encryption. If the key size is 128 bits, how many different keys are possible for this block cipher algorithm?",
    "message_2": "If the key size is 128 bits, then there are 2^128 possible different keys for this block cipher algorithm. This is because each bit can have 2 possible values (0 or 1), and there are 128 bits in the key. So the total number of different keys is 2 * 2 * 2 * ... (128 times) = 2^128."
