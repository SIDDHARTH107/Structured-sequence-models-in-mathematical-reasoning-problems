    "message_2": "To determine the girth of the graph G, we need to find the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. The girth is the minimum number of edges that form a cycle.\n\nFirst, let's consider the maximum number of edges a graph with 11 vertices can have without forming a cycle. This can be achieved by constructing a tree, which is a connected graph with no cycles. A tree with n vertices always has n-1 edges. So, for 11 vertices, the maximum number of edges without forming a cycle is 11 - 1 = 10 edges.\n\nNow, our graph G has 17 edges, which means there are 17 - 10 = 7 additional edges beyond the tree structure. Each additional edge will create at least one cycle in the graph.\n\nLet's consider the possible girths and the number of additional edges needed to achieve them:\n\n1. Girth of 3 (a triangle): To form a triangle, we need at least one additional edge.\n2. Girth of 4 (a square): To form a square, we need at least two additional edges.\n3. Girth of 5 (a pentagon): To form a pentagon, we need at least three additional edges.\n\nSince we have 7 additional edges, it's guaranteed that we can form a cycle of length 3 (a triangle) in the graph G. Therefore, the girth of the graph G is 3."
