    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge (also known as a cut edge) is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph, the cut vertices are B, C, and D. Removing any of these vertices will increase the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nThe bridges in the graph are the edges connecting the following pairs of vertices:\n1. (A, B)\n2. (B, C)\n3. (C, D)\n\nRemoving any of these edges will increase the number of connected components in the graph."
