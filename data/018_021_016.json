    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A ∆ B) with A and B:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ A = {1, 2}\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {5, 6}\n\nNow we can find the symmetric difference of these two sets:\n\n({1, 2} ∆ {5, 6}) = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's consider a set C and find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and (A ∆ C) ∩ B. We will show that this is equal to (A ∆ B ∩ B ∆ C) ∪ (A ∆ C ∩ B ∆ C).\n\nLet C be an arbitrary set. Then:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ ((A ∆ C) ∩ B) = (A ∆ B ∩ B ∆ C) ∪ (A ∆ C ∩ B ∆ C)\n\nWe can rewrite the left side of the equation using the properties of symmetric difference:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ ((A ∆ C) ∩ B) = (A ∆ B ∩ (A ∆ C)') ∪ (A ∆ B)' ∩ (A ∆ C) ∩ B\n\nNow, let's rewrite the right side of the equation using the properties of intersection and symmetric difference:\n\n(A ∆ B ∩ B ∆ C) ∪ (A ∆ C ∩ B ∆ C) = (A ∆ B ∩ (A ∆ C)') ∪ (A ∆ B)' ∩ (A ∆ C) ∩ B\n\nComparing both sides of the equation, we can see that they are equal:\n\n(A ∆ B ∩ (A ∆ C)') ∪ (A ∆ B)' ∩ (A ∆ C) ∩ B = (A ∆ B ∩ (A ∆ C)') ∪ (A ∆ B)' ∩ (A ∆ C) ∩ B\n\nThus, we have shown that the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and (A ∆ C) ∩ B is equal to (A ∆ B ∩ B ∆ C) ∪ (A ∆ C ∩ B ∆ C)."
