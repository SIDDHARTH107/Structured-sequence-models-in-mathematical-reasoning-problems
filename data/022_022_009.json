    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-x^2), we will use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nwhere F(k) is the Fourier transform of f(x), and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIn our case, f(x) = e^(-x^2). So, we need to compute the following integral:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-x^2) * e^(-2πikx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use complex analysis. We will first rewrite the integral in terms of complex exponentials:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-x^2 - 2πikx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, let's complete the square in the exponent:\n\n-x^2 - 2πikx = -(x^2 + 2πikx + (πk)^2) + (πk)^2\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\nF(k) = e^((πk)^2) ∫[e^(-(x + πik)^2)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, let's make a substitution: let z = x + πik. Then, dz = dx, and the limits of integration become -∞ + πik and ∞ + πik. The integral now becomes:\n\nF(k) = e^((πk)^2) ∫[e^(-z^2)] dz from -∞ + πik to ∞ + πik\n\nThis integral is a complex Gaussian integral. To solve it, we will use the residue theorem from complex analysis. The residue theorem states that the integral of a function along a closed contour is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function at its poles inside the contour.\n\nThe function e^(-z^2) has no poles, so we will need to find a suitable contour to apply the residue theorem. We will use a rectangular contour with vertices at -R, -R + πik, R + πik, and R, where R is a large positive real number. The integral along this contour can be split into four integrals along the edges of the rectangle.\n\nAs R goes to infinity, the integrals along the vertical edges of the rectangle go to zero. Therefore, the integral along the contour is equal to the sum of the integrals along the horizontal edges:\n\n∫[e^(-z^2)] dz from -∞ to ∞ + ∫[e^(-z^2)] dz from ∞ + πik to -∞ + πik\n\nSince the function e^(-z^2) has no poles, the integral along the contour is zero. Therefore, the sum of the integrals along the horizontal edges is also zero:\n\n∫[e^(-z^2)] dz from -∞ to ∞ + ∫[e^(-z^2)] dz from ∞ + πik to -∞ + πik = 0\n\nNow, let's solve for the integral we are interested in:\n\n∫[e^(-z^2)] dz from -∞ + πik to ∞ + πik = -∫[e^(-z^2)] dz from -∞ to ∞\n\nThe integral on the right-hand side is a standard Gaussian integral, which is equal to the square root of π:\n\n∫[e^(-z^2)] dz from -∞ to ∞ = √π\n\nSo, we have:\n\n∫[e^(-z^2)] dz from -∞ + πik to ∞ + πik = -√π\n\nFinally, we substitute back x + πik for z:\n\nF(k) = e^((πk)^2) (-√π)\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-x^2)."
