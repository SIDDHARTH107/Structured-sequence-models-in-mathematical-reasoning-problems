    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2^(x+1) - 12(2^x) + 16 = 0, we can make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let y = 2^x. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n2y - 12y + 16 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\n2y - 12y + 16 = 0\n-10y + 16 = 0\n-10y = -16\ny = 16/10\ny = 8/5\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. Since we made the substitution y = 2^x, we can now write:\n\n8/5 = 2^x\n\nTo solve for x, we can take the logarithm of both sides (using base 2):\n\nlog2(8/5) = log2(2^x)\nlog2(8/5) = x\n\nSo, the solution for x is:\n\nx = log2(8/5)"
