    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) and A, denoted as (A △ B) × A. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A △ B) × A = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B.\n\nA × B = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A × B) and A, denoted as (A × B) △ A.\n\n(A × B) △ A = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)}\n\nSimilarly, let's find the symmetric difference of (B × A) and B, denoted as (B × A) △ B.\n\nB × A = {(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)}\n\n(B × A) △ B = {(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)}\n\nNow, let's prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference. To show this, we need to show that (A △ B) × A ≠ (A × B) △ A and (A × B) △ A ≠ (B × A) △ B.\n\nWe can see that the sets (A △ B) × A, (A × B) △ A, and (B × A) △ B are all different:\n\n(A △ B) × A = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)}\n\n(A × B) △ A = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)}\n\n(B × A) △ B = {(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)}\n\nSince the sets are different, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
