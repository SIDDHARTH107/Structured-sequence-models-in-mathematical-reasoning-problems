    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a simplicial complex is given by the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this simplicial complex, we have:\n- V = 4 (four vertices)\n- E = 4 (four edges)\n- F = 0 (no faces, as there are no triangles or higher-dimensional simplices)\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic is:\n\nχ = 4 - 4 + 0 = 0"
