    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 6 cm and a minor radius of 3 cm. Determine the volume of the torus in terms of pi, correct to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (pi * (minor radius)^2) * (2 * pi * major radius)\n\nIn this case, the major radius (R) is 6 cm and the minor radius (r) is 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (pi * (3 cm)^2) * (2 * pi * 6 cm)\n\nVolume = (pi * 9 cm^2) * (12 * pi cm)\n\nVolume = 108 * pi^2 cm^3\n\nNow, we'll approximate the value of pi^2 to two decimal places:\n\npi^2 ≈ 9.87 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is:\n\nVolume ≈ 108 * 9.87 cm^3\n\nVolume ≈ 1065.96 cm^3\n\nTherefore, the volume of the torus is approximately 1065.96 cm^3 in terms of pi, correct to two decimal places."
