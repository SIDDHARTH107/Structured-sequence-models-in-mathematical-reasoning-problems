    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a certain type of product defect occurring is 0.18. If a batch of 500 products are produced, what is the probability that exactly 70 products in the batch will have the defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (defective products in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (total number of products produced)\n- x is the number of successes (defective products)\n- p is the probability of success (probability of a product being defective)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (x!(n-x)!)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 500\n- x = 70\n- p = 0.18\n\nFirst, let's calculate nCx:\nnCx = 500! / (70!(500-70)!)\nnCx = 500! / (70!430!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(70) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\nP(70) = (500! / (70!430!)) * (0.18^70) * (1-0.18)^(500-70)\n\nCalculating this expression, we get:\n\nP(70) â‰ˆ 0.0303\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 70 products in the batch will have the defect is approximately 0.0303 or 3.03%."
