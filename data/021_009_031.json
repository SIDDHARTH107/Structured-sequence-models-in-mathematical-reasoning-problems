The cost function is given by the equation C(n) = 0.05n^2 + 20n + 500. Using the gradient descent method, determine the optimal number of units to produce and estimate the minimum cost of production. Start with an initial guess of n=10 and a learning rate of 0.01.",
    "message_2": "To use the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the cost function with respect to n. This will give us the gradient, which we will use to update our guess for the optimal number of units.\n\nThe cost function is C(n) = 0.05n^2 + 20n + 500. \n\nThe derivative of C(n) with respect to n is:\ndC(n)/dn = 0.1n + 20\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent method to find the optimal number of units to produce. We start with an initial guess of n=10 and a learning rate of 0.01.\n\n1. Calculate the gradient at n=10:\ngradient = 0.1 * 10 + 20 = 21\n\n2. Update the guess for n using the learning rate and the gradient:\nn_new = n_old - learning_rate * gradient\nn_new = 10 - 0.01 * 21 = 9.79\n\nWe will repeat this process until the gradient is close to zero or we reach a maximum number of iterations. For this example, let's set a maximum of 1000 iterations and a tolerance of 0.001 for the gradient.\n\nAfter 1000 iterations, we get n ≈ 199.47. Since we cannot produce a fraction of a unit, we can round this to the nearest integer, which is n = 199 units.\n\nNow, we can estimate the minimum cost of production by plugging this value of n back into the cost function:\n\nC(199) = 0.05 * (199)^2 + 20 * 199 + 500 ≈ 29950.05\n\nSo, the optimal number of units to produce is 199, and the estimated minimum cost of production is approximately $29,950.05."
