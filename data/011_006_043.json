    "message_2": "Let's first find the total number of ways to select a team of 5 students from a class of 20 students without any restrictions. This can be done using combinations, which is given by the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students, k is the number of students we want to select, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to select a team of 5 students from a class of 20 students is:\n\nC(20, 5) = 20! / (5!(20-5)!) = 20! / (5!15!) = 15504\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to select a team with no boys or only one boy. Let's assume there are B boys and G girls in the class. We need to find the number of ways to select a team with no boys (5 girls) and a team with only one boy (1 boy and 4 girls).\n\nFor a team with no boys (5 girls), the number of ways is:\n\nC(G, 5) = G! / (5!(G-5)!)\n\nFor a team with only one boy (1 boy and 4 girls), the number of ways is:\n\nC(B, 1) * C(G, 4) = B! / (1!(B-1)!) * G! / (4!(G-4)!)\n\nNow, to find the number of ways to select a team with at least 2 boys, we subtract the number of ways to select a team with no boys or only one boy from the total number of ways:\n\nNumber of ways with at least 2 boys = Total number of ways - (Number of ways with no boys + Number of ways with only one boy)\n\nSince we don't have the exact values for B and G, we cannot calculate the exact number of ways to select a team with at least 2 boys. However, the formula above can be used to find the answer once the values for B and G are known."
