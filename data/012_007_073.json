    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, we will iteratively find augmenting paths from the source (S) to the sink (T) and update the flow along these paths. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Start with an initial flow of 0.\n2. Find an augmenting path from S to T. One possible path is S -> B -> F -> G -> T. The bottleneck capacity along this path is 6 (the minimum capacity of the edges in the path).\n3. Update the flow along the augmenting path by adding the bottleneck capacity. The new flow values are:\n\n                   6\n        (S) ------------> (B)        (T)\n          |\\              / |          |\n          | \\            /  |          |\n        4 |  \\          / 0 |          | 7\n          |   \\        /   |          |\n          |    \\      /    |          |\n          v     v    v     v          v\n        (D)----->(E)----->(F)----->(G)\n\n4. Find another augmenting path. One possible path is S -> D -> E -> F -> G -> T. The bottleneck capacity along this path is 4.\n5. Update the flow along the augmenting path by adding the bottleneck capacity. The new flow values are:\n\n                   6\n        (S) ------------> (B)        (T)\n          |\\              / |          |\n          | \\            /  |          |\n        0 |  \\          / 4 |          | 7\n          |   \\        /   |          |\n          |    \\      /    |          |\n          v     v    v     v          v\n        (D)----->(E)----->(F)----->(G)\n\n6. We can't find any more augmenting paths from S to T, so the algorithm terminates.\n\nThe maximum flow from S to T is the sum of the flow values on the edges entering T, which is 6 + 4 = 10."
