The student has received acceptance letters from two colleges, College A and College B. \n\nThe student has a 70% chance of being happy at College A and a 80% chance of being happy at College B. If the student chooses College A, there is a 40% chance they will get a scholarship worth $10,000. If they choose College B, there is a 60% chance they will get a scholarship worth $8,000. \n\nAssuming the student's only goal is to maximize their expected happiness and financial benefit, which college should they choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine which college the student should choose, we need to calculate the expected value of happiness and financial benefit for each college. \n\nFor College A:\nExpected happiness value = 0.7 (since there's a 70% chance of being happy)\nExpected financial benefit = 0.4 * $10,000 = $4,000 (since there's a 40% chance of getting a $10,000 scholarship)\n\nFor College B:\nExpected happiness value = 0.8 (since there's an 80% chance of being happy)\nExpected financial benefit = 0.6 * $8,000 = $4,800 (since there's a 60% chance of getting an $8,000 scholarship)\n\nComparing the expected values:\n\nCollege A:\nHappiness: 0.7\nFinancial benefit: $4,000\n\nCollege B:\nHappiness: 0.8\nFinancial benefit: $4,800\n\nSince the student's goal is to maximize their expected happiness and financial benefit, they should choose College B, as it has higher expected values for both happiness and financial benefit."
