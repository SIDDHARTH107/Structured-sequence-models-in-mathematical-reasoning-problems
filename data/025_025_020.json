Determine if the coordinate ring of this set is isomorphic to the polynomial algebra $k[t]$, and if so, provide a generating set for the coordinate ring.",
    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the given polynomials as follows:\n\n$f_1 = x^2 - 2xy = x(x - 2y)$\n$f_2 = y^2 - 2yx = y(y - 2x)$\n\nNow, let's consider the ideal generated by these polynomials, denoted by $I = \\langle f_1, f_2 \\rangle$. We want to determine if the coordinate ring of the affine algebraic set given by the vanishing ideal of these polynomials, which is $k\\langle x, y\\rangle / I$, is isomorphic to the polynomial algebra $k[t]$.\n\nNotice that if we set $x = 2y$, then $f_1 = 0$. Similarly, if we set $y = 2x$, then $f_2 = 0$. Therefore, the affine algebraic set consists of the points $(x, y)$ such that $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. This set can be parameterized by a single parameter $t$, where $x = 2t$ and $y = t$ or $x = t$ and $y = 2t$. \n\nNow, let's define a map $\\phi: k[t] \\to k\\langle x, y\\rangle / I$ as follows:\n\n$\\phi(t) = x - 2y + I$\n\nWe will show that this map is an isomorphism.\n\n1. $\\phi$ is well-defined: Since $x - 2y \\in I$, the map is well-defined.\n\n2. $\\phi$ is a homomorphism: Let $p(t), q(t) \\in k[t]$. Then,\n\n$\\phi(p(t) + q(t)) = x - 2y + I = \\phi(p(t)) + \\phi(q(t))$\n$\\phi(p(t)q(t)) = (x - 2y)(x - 2y) + I = \\phi(p(t))\\phi(q(t))$\n\n3. $\\phi$ is injective: Suppose $\\phi(p(t)) = 0 + I$. Then, $p(t)(x - 2y) \\in I$. Since $x - 2y$ is not a zero divisor in $k\\langle x, y\\rangle$, it must be the case that $p(t) = 0$. Thus, $\\phi$ is injective.\n\n4. $\\phi$ is surjective: Let $g(x, y) + I \\in k\\langle x, y\\rangle / I$. We can write $g(x, y) = p(x, y) + r(x, y)$, where $p(x, y) \\in I$ and $r(x, y)$ is a polynomial of degree less than 1 in $x$ and $y$. Then, $r(x, y) = at + b$, where $a, b \\in k$. Since $x - 2y \\in I$, we have $g(x, y) + I = (at + b)(x - 2y) + I = \\phi(at + b)$. Thus, $\\phi$ is surjective.\n\nSince $\\phi$ is a well-defined homomorphism that is both injective and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, the coordinate ring of the affine algebraic set given by the vanishing ideal of the polynomials $f_1$ and $f_2$ is isomorphic to the polynomial algebra $k[t]$.\n\nA generating set for the coordinate ring is given by the image of the standard generating set for $k[t]$, which is $\\{1, t\\}$. Thus, the generating set for the coordinate ring is $\\{1 + I, x - 2y + I\\}$."
