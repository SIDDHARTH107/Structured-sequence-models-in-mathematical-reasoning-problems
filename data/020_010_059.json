    "message_1": "A company produces two types of bags of rice, A and B. The production process needs two types of raw material, X and Y. The cost of raw material X is $1.40 per kilogram, and the cost of raw material Y is $2.20 per kilogram. Type A bag requires 2 kilograms of X and 3 kilograms of Y, while type B bag requires 3 kilograms of X and 1 kilogram of Y. The company has a daily supply of 1500 kilograms of raw material X and 900 kilograms of raw material Y. The profit of type A bag is $4.50, and the profit of type B bag is $3.50. \n\nAssuming that the maximum daily production capacity of the company is 250 bags of both types combined, use robust optimization to find out how many bags of each type the company should produce to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal number of bags of type A and type B to produce, given the constraints on raw materials and production capacity. Let's denote the number of type A bags as x and the number of type B bags as y.\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 4.50x + 3.50y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Raw material X: 2x + 3y ≤ 1500\n2. Raw material Y: 3x + y ≤ 900\n3. Production capacity: x + y ≤ 250\n4. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we can use the graphical method to find the feasible region and the optimal solution.\n\n1. Draw the constraint lines on a graph with x-axis representing type A bags and y-axis representing type B bags.\n2. Identify the feasible region where all constraints are satisfied.\n3. Find the vertices of the feasible region.\n4. Calculate the profit at each vertex.\n5. Choose the vertex with the highest profit as the optimal solution.\n\nAfter plotting the constraints and identifying the feasible region, we find the vertices of the feasible region to be:\n\nA: (0, 0)\nB: (0, 300)\nC: (250, 0)\nD: (150, 100)\n\nNow, we calculate the profit at each vertex:\n\nA: P(0, 0) = 4.50(0) + 3.50(0) = $0\nB: P(0, 300) is infeasible due to constraints 2 and 3.\nC: P(250, 0) = 4.50(250) + 3.50(0) = $1125\nD: P(150, 100) = 4.50(150) + 3.50(100) = $975\n\nThe optimal solution is to produce 250 bags of type A and 0 bags of type B, which will result in a maximum profit of $1125."
