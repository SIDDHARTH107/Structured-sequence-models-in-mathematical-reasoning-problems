    "message_2": "First, let's write the given system of linear equations in matrix form AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  5 |\n    | 4  6 10 |\n    | 8 12 20 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    | 20 |\n    | 40 |\n\nNow, let's analyze the matrix A to determine if it's a sparse matrix. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, matrix A doesn't have any zero elements, so it's not a sparse matrix.\n\nHowever, we can simplify the system of linear equations by dividing each equation by their common factors. Doing this, we get:\n\n1x + 1.5y + 2.5z = 5\n2x + 3y + 5z = 10\n4x + 6y + 10z = 20\n\nNotice that the first and second equations are the same, and the third equation is just the second equation multiplied by 2. This means that the third equation doesn't provide any new information, and we can remove it from the system:\n\n1x + 1.5y + 2.5z = 5\n2x + 3y + 5z = 10\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with three variables, which means there are infinitely many solutions. To find a general solution, we can express one variable in terms of the others. Let's solve for z in the first equation:\n\n2.5z = 5 - 1x - 1.5y\nz = (5 - x - 1.5y) / 2.5\n\nNow we have a general solution for z in terms of x and y. Since there are infinitely many solutions, we cannot find specific values for x, y, and z that satisfy the system of linear equations. However, we have found a relationship between the variables:\n\nz = (5 - x - 1.5y) / 2.5"
