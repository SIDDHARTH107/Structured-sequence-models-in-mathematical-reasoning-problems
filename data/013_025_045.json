    "message_1": "Here is a possible numerical problem involving Traveler's Dilemma for a math student to solve:\n\nTwo airline passengers accidentally damage each other's suitcases during their flight. The actual cost of repairing each suitcase is not known to them, but it is believed to be between $100 and $200. The airline offers them a deal: each passenger writes down the amount they believe the damage to their own suitcase will cost, and the airline will pay the lower amount plus a bonus of $50 to the passenger who wrote the lower estimate. However, if both passengers write down the same amount, the airline will pay that amount to both passengers but without any bonus.\n\nIf both passengers are rational and employ the Traveler's Dilemma strategy, what amount should they write down to maximize their own payoff?\n\n(note: the Traveler's Dilemma strategy involves selecting a number that is one less than the maximum value that would be considered reasonable and then subtracting that number from one's actual estimate. The other player does the same thing, resulting in a Nash equilibrium where both players choose the same number that is lower than their actual estimate.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, let's first consider the range of possible values the passengers can write down, which is between $100 and $200. The Traveler's Dilemma strategy involves selecting a number that is one less than the maximum value that would be considered reasonable. In this case, the maximum value is $200, so the number to be considered is $199.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible outcomes for both passengers:\n\n1. If both passengers write down $199, they will both receive $199 without any bonus.\n2. If one passenger writes down $199 and the other writes down $198, the one who wrote $198 will receive $248 ($198 + $50 bonus), while the other will receive $198.\n3. If both passengers write down $198, they will both receive $198 without any bonus.\n\nAs rational players, both passengers will realize that writing down $199 will not maximize their payoff, as they could potentially receive a higher payoff by writing down $198. Therefore, both passengers will choose to write down $198, resulting in a Nash equilibrium where both players choose the same number that is lower than their actual estimate. In this case, they will both receive $198 without any bonus."
