    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^p - 1, where p is a prime number. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 100, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that 2^p - 1 > 100.\n\nWe can start by testing prime numbers greater than 5 (since 2^5 - 1 = 31, which is less than 100):\n\nFor p = 7, 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127. Since 127 is a prime number, the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 100 is 127."
