    "message_2": "The set of all subsets of the natural numbers is called the power set of the natural numbers. The cardinality of the power set of a set with cardinality n is 2^n. In this case, the natural numbers have a countably infinite cardinality, denoted as ℵ₀ (aleph-null). \n\nTo find the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers, we need to calculate 2^(ℵ₀). This cardinality is known as the cardinality of the continuum, denoted as ℵ₁ (aleph-one). So, the cardinality of the set of all subsets of the natural numbers in second-order logic is ℵ₁."
