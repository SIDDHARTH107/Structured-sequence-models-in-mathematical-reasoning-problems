The corresponding Hill Cipher decryption key matrix is to be found. What is the Hill Cipher decryption key matrix?",
    "message_2": "To find the Hill Cipher decryption key matrix, we first need to find the inverse of the given encryption key matrix K modulo 26. The given matrix K is:\n\nK = | 4  5 |\n      | 7  8 |\n\nFirst, we need to find the determinant of K:\n\ndet(K) = (4 * 8) - (5 * 7) = 32 - 35 = -3\n\nSince we are working with modulo 26, we need to find the modular inverse of the determinant:\n\n-3 (mod 26) = 23\n\nNow, we need to find the adjugate of K:\n\nadj(K) = |  8  -5 |\n             | -7   4 |\n\nNext, we multiply the adjugate of K by the modular inverse of the determinant:\n\nD = 23 * adj(K) = | 23 * 8  -23 * 5 |\n                         | -23 * 7  23 * 4 |\n\nD = | 184  -115 |\n        | -161  92 |\n\nFinally, we need to find the matrix D modulo 26:\n\nD (mod 26) = | 0  11 |\n                    | 11  18 |\n\nSo, the Hill Cipher decryption key matrix is:\n\nD = | 0  11 |\n        | 11  18 |"
