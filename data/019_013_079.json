    "message_2": "The number of subsets of a set with five elements can be calculated using the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the set. In this case, n = 5.\n\n2^5 = 32\n\nSo, there are 32 subsets of a set with five elements. This result holds true in both first-order and second-order logic, as it is a mathematical calculation and not dependent on the logic system."
