    "message_1": "A transposition cipher of a message has a key of 6. The plaintext message is \"MATHEMATICS\". What is the ciphertext message after encryption using this key?",
    "message_2": "A transposition cipher rearranges the letters in the plaintext message according to a specific pattern determined by the key. In this case, the key is 6. We can arrange the plaintext message \"MATHEMATICS\" in a grid with 6 columns:\n\nM A T H E M\nA T I C S\n\nNow, we read the ciphertext message column by column:\n\nCiphertext: MAMTATEHICS"
