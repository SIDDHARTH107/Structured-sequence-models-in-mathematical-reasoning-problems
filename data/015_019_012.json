    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student based on the Henon-Heiles system of Chaos Theory:\n\nConsider the Henon-Heiles system given by the Hamiltonian function H(x, y, p_x, p_y) = 1/2(p_x^2 + p_y^2) + x^2y - (1/3)x^3 + (1/2)y^2. Compute the value of the total energy E(x, y, p_x, p_y) = H(x, y, p_x, p_y) at the point (x, y, p_x, p_y) = (0.5, 1, 0, 0.5) and determine whether the system is in a bound or unbound state.",
    "message_2": "To compute the total energy E(x, y, p_x, p_y) at the given point (x, y, p_x, p_y) = (0.5, 1, 0, 0.5), we substitute these values into the Hamiltonian function H(x, y, p_x, p_y):\n\nE(0.5, 1, 0, 0.5) = H(0.5, 1, 0, 0.5) = 1/2(0^2 + 0.5^2) + (0.5)^2(1) - (1/3)(0.5)^3 + (1/2)(1)^2\n\nE(0.5, 1, 0, 0.5) = 1/2(0 + 0.25) + 0.25 - (1/3)(0.125) + 0.5\n\nE(0.5, 1, 0, 0.5) = 0.125 + 0.25 - 0.0416666667 + 0.5\n\nE(0.5, 1, 0, 0.5) ≈ 0.833333333\n\nThe total energy at the given point is approximately 0.8333.\n\nTo determine whether the system is in a bound or unbound state, we need to consider the potential energy V(x, y) = x^2y - (1/3)x^3 + (1/2)y^2. At the given point (x, y) = (0.5, 1):\n\nV(0.5, 1) = (0.5)^2(1) - (1/3)(0.5)^3 + (1/2)(1)^2\n\nV(0.5, 1) = 0.25 - 0.0416666667 + 0.5\n\nV(0.5, 1) ≈ 0.708333333\n\nThe potential energy at the given point is approximately 0.7083. Since the total energy is greater than the potential energy, the system is in an unbound state."
