    "message_1": "In a video game, a team of 5 volunteers needs to decide who will defend the main base and who will attack the enemy base. If all volunteers choose to attack, there is a 70% chance of winning, but the main base will be left undefended, resulting in a 100% chance of losing. If one volunteer chooses to defend and the other four choose to attack, there is a 90% chance of winning and a 10% chance of losing. However, the volunteer who chooses to defend will not gain any points or rewards for the attack. If two or more volunteers choose to defend, the game will be forfeited due to lack of attackers. \n\nWhat is the optimal strategy for the volunteers to maximize their chances of winning and earning rewards? How many volunteers should choose to defend to ensure the best outcome?",
    "message_2": "The optimal strategy for the volunteers to maximize their chances of winning and earning rewards is to have one volunteer choose to defend the main base while the other four volunteers choose to attack the enemy base. This will result in a 90% chance of winning and a 10% chance of losing. Although the volunteer who chooses to defend will not gain any points or rewards for the attack, the overall team's chances of winning are significantly higher compared to the other scenarios."
