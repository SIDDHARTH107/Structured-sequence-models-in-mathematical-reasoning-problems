    "message_1": "A delivery company needs to deliver 10 packages to different locations within a city. The company has 3 delivery trucks, each with a capacity of 4 packages. What is the minimum number of delivery trucks needed to complete all deliveries in the most efficient way possible?",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of delivery trucks needed, we can divide the total number of packages (10) by the capacity of each truck (4).\n\n10 รท 4 = 2.5\n\nSince a truck cannot carry a fraction of a package, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the minimum number of delivery trucks needed to complete all deliveries in the most efficient way possible is 3."
