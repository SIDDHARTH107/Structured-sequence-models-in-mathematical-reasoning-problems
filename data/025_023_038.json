    "message_2": "To compute the intersection cohomology groups IH^*(Y, Q), we first need to understand the singularities of Y. Since Y is the zero locus of a section s of L^2, it is a divisor on X. Moreover, since L is very ample, Y is a smooth curve on X.\n\nNow, let's consider the long exact sequence in cohomology associated with the short exact sequence of sheaves on X:\n\n0 → O_X → O_X(L^2) → O_Y(L^2) → 0\n\nTaking cohomology, we get:\n\n0 → H^0(X, O_X) → H^0(X, O_X(L^2)) → H^0(Y, O_Y(L^2)) → H^1(X, O_X) → ...\n\nSince X is a smooth projective surface, we have H^1(X, O_X) = 0. Therefore, the long exact sequence becomes:\n\n0 → H^0(X, O_X) → H^0(X, O_X(L^2)) → H^0(Y, O_Y(L^2)) → 0\n\nNow, let's compute the intersection cohomology groups IH^*(Y, Q). Since Y is a smooth curve, its intersection cohomology groups are the same as its usual cohomology groups. We have:\n\nIH^0(Y, Q) = H^0(Y, Q) = Q\n\nIH^1(Y, Q) = H^1(Y, Q) = H^0(Y, O_Y(L^2)) ⊗ Q\n\nIH^2(Y, Q) = H^2(Y, Q) = Q\n\nAll other intersection cohomology groups are zero.\n\nIn conclusion, the intersection cohomology groups of Y are:\n\nIH^0(Y, Q) = Q\nIH^1(Y, Q) = H^0(Y, O_Y(L^2)) ⊗ Q\nIH^2(Y, Q) = Q\nIH^i(Y, Q) = 0 for i > 2"
