    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(θ)\n\nwhere ||u|| and ||v|| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n||u|| = √(2² + 5²) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n||v|| = √((-3)² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n\nNext, we need to find the angle between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (||u|| ||v||)\n\nBut first, we need to find the dot product using the standard method:\n\nu · v = (2 * -3) + (5 * 4) = -6 + 20 = 14\n\nNow, we can find the angle between the two vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (||u|| ||v||) = 14 / (√29 * 5)\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula for the dot product using trigonometry:\n\nu · v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(θ) = (√29)(5)(14 / (√29 * 5))\n\nThe (√29) and (5) in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nu · v = 14\n\nSo, the dot product of the vectors u = [2, 5] and v = [-3, 4] is 14."
