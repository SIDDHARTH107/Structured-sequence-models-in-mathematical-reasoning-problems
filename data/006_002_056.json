    "message_2": "To find the probability of exactly two 4s in three rolls, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (rolls), k is the number of successful trials (rolling a 4), p is the probability of success (rolling a 4), and q is the probability of failure (not rolling a 4).\n\nIn this case, n = 3, k = 2, p = 1/6 (since there is one 4 on a six-sided die), and q = 5/6 (since there are five other numbers on the die).\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of combinations of rolling two 4s in three rolls, which is given by nCk:\n\nnCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n3C2 = 3! / (2!(3-2)!)\n3C2 = 6 / (2*1)\n3C2 = 3\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = (3C2) * (1/6)^2 * (5/6)^(3-2)\nP(X = 2) = 3 * (1/36) * (5/6)\nP(X = 2) = 3 * (1/36) * (5/6)\nP(X = 2) = 3/36 * 5/6\nP(X = 2) = 15/216\n\nSo, the probability of rolling exactly two 4s in three rolls is 15/216, which can be simplified to 5/72."
