    "message_1": "Suppose a stock is currently trading at $100 per share. The probability that the stock price will increase by $20 per share is 0.35, and the probability that it will decrease by $10 per share is 0.15. What is the probability that the stock price will either increase by $20 per share or decrease by $10 per share?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the stock price will either increase by $20 per share or decrease by $10 per share, we simply add the probabilities of each event occurring, since they are mutually exclusive events.\n\nProbability of stock price increasing by $20 per share = 0.35\nProbability of stock price decreasing by $10 per share = 0.15\n\nProbability of either event occurring = 0.35 + 0.15 = 0.50\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will either increase by $20 per share or decrease by $10 per share is 0.50 or 50%."
