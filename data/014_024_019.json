    "message_2": "To decrypt a Caesar cipher with a key of 7, we need to shift each letter in the encrypted message 7 positions back in the alphabet.\n\nU -> N\nJ -> C\nL -> E\nH -> A\nJ -> C\nO -> H\nL -> E\nY -> T\n\nThe decrypted message is \"NCEACHET\". Since the original message was a 4-letter word, we can group the decrypted message into pairs: \"NC\", \"EA\", \"CH\", \"ET\". The original 4-letter word is \"NEAT\"."
