    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the two equal sides have a length of 6 cm each. If the triangle has a perimeter of 18 cm, what is the length of the third side?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the third side be x cm. Since the triangle has a perimeter of 18 cm, we can write the equation:\n\n6 + 6 + x = 18\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n12 + x = 18\nx = 18 - 12\nx = 6\n\nSo, the length of the third side is 6 cm."
