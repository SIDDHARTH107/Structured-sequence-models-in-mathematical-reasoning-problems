    "message_2": "To find the least distance at which both designs will repeat together, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 6.\n\nPrime factorization of 4: 2^2\nPrime factorization of 6: 2 * 3\n\nLCM(4, 6) = 2^2 * 3 = 12\n\nThe least distance at which both designs will repeat together is 12 feet."
