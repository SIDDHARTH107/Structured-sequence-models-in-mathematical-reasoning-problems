    "message_2": "First, let's prove the \"if\" direction: If there exists a continuous surjective map f: Y → {0,1} where {0,1} has the discrete topology, then Y cannot be connected.\n\nSince f is continuous and surjective, the preimages of 0 and 1 under f are non-empty, open, and disjoint subsets of Y, say U = f^(-1)(0) and V = f^(-1)(1). Moreover, since f is surjective, we have Y = U ∪ V. Thus, Y can be written as a union of two non-empty, open, and disjoint subsets, which means that Y is not connected.\n\nNow, let's prove the \"only if\" direction: If Y is not connected, then there exists a continuous surjective map f: Y → {0,1} where {0,1} has the discrete topology.\n\nSince Y is not connected, there exist non-empty, open, and disjoint subsets U and V of Y such that Y = U ∪ V. Define a function f: Y → {0,1} as follows:\n\nf(y) = 0 if y ∈ U\nf(y) = 1 if y ∈ V\n\nWe claim that f is continuous and surjective. To show that f is continuous, let W be an open subset of {0,1} with the discrete topology. If W = ∅, then f^(-1)(W) = ∅, which is open in Y. If W = {0}, then f^(-1)(W) = U, which is open in Y. If W = {1}, then f^(-1)(W) = V, which is open in Y. If W = {0,1}, then f^(-1)(W) = Y, which is open in Y. Thus, f is continuous.\n\nTo show that f is surjective, note that since U and V are non-empty, there exist points u ∈ U and v ∈ V. Then f(u) = 0 and f(v) = 1, so f is surjective.\n\nTherefore, if Y is not connected, there exists a continuous surjective map f: Y → {0,1} where {0,1} has the discrete topology.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that Y cannot be connected if and only if there exists a continuous surjective map f: Y → {0,1} where {0,1} has the discrete topology."
