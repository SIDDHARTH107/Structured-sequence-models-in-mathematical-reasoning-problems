    "message_2": "To extend the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z-1}$ analytically into the region $G=\\{z:|z|>2\\}$, we can use the technique of analytic continuation. We can rewrite the function $f(z)$ as a geometric series by factoring out a term that will allow us to use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the function $f(z)$ as follows:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z-1} = \\frac{1}{z}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{z}}$$\n\nNow, we can use the geometric series formula for the second term:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{z}} = 1 + \\frac{1}{z} + \\frac{1}{z^2} + \\frac{1}{z^3} + \\cdots$$\n\nSo, the function $f(z)$ can be written as:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{z} + \\frac{1}{z^2} + \\frac{1}{z^3} + \\cdots\\right)$$\n\nThis series converges for $|z| > 1$, which includes the region $G=\\{z:|z|>2\\}$. Therefore, we can use this series representation of $f(z)$ as its analytic continuation into the region $G$.\n\nNow, we can find the value of $f(3)$ using this series representation:\n\n$$f(3) = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\frac{1}{3^3} + \\cdots\\right)$$\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term $a = 1$ and the common ratio $r = \\frac{1}{3}$. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula:\n\n$$S = \\frac{a}{1-r}$$\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$ and $r = \\frac{1}{3}$, so the sum is:\n\n$$S = \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\nFinally, we multiply this sum by the factor $\\frac{1}{3}$:\n\n$$f(3) = \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSo, the value of $f(3)$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$."
