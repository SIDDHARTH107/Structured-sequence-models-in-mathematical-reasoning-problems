    "message_2": "For the statement \"All cats are mammals,\" we can use predicate logic to represent it as follows:\n\n∀x (C(x) → M(x))\n\nHere, C(x) represents \"x is a cat\" and M(x) represents \"x is a mammal.\" The universal quantifier ∀x means \"for all x,\" and the implication arrow (→) means \"implies.\" So, the equation reads \"For all x, if x is a cat, then x is a mammal.\"\n\nNow, for the negation of the statement, we want to represent \"Not all cats are mammals.\" We can write this as:\n\n¬(∀x (C(x) → M(x)))\n\nThis can be further simplified using De Morgan's laws and the equivalence between ¬∀ and ∃¬ (there exists an x such that not):\n\n∃x ¬(C(x) → M(x))\n\nThis can be further simplified by noting that ¬(A → B) is equivalent to (A ∧ ¬B):\n\n∃x (C(x) ∧ ¬M(x))\n\nSo, the negation of the statement reads \"There exists an x such that x is a cat and x is not a mammal.\""
