    "message_2": "To solve this partial differential equation, we can use the method of characteristics. The characteristic equations are given by:\n\n$$\\frac{dx}{1} = \\frac{dy}{i} = \\frac{du}{0}$$\n\nSince $\\frac{du}{0}$ is undefined, we can ignore it. Now, we solve the other two equations:\n\n$$\\frac{dx}{1} = \\frac{dy}{i} \\Rightarrow i dx = dy$$\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n$$ix = y + C_1$$\n\nwhere $C_1$ is an arbitrary constant of integration. Now, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$y = -ix + C_1$$\n\nSince $u(x,y)$ is a complex-valued function, we can write it as:\n\n$$u(x,y) = f(-ix + C_1)$$\n\nwhere $f$ is an arbitrary complex-valued function. This is the general solution to the given partial differential equation."
