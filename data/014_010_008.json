    "message_1": "Suppose you are using a substitution cipher that maps every letter in the English alphabet to a unique number between 1 and 26, inclusive. If the letter \"A\" encrypted as the number 10, what number would the letter \"Z\" encrypt as?",
    "message_2": "To find the number that the letter \"Z\" encrypts as, we first need to determine the pattern of the substitution cipher. Since \"A\" is the first letter of the alphabet and it encrypts as the number 10, we can assume that each subsequent letter is assigned a number one greater than the previous letter.\n\nSo, the pattern would be:\nA -> 10\nB -> 11\nC -> 12\n...\nZ -> ?\n\nNow, we can find the position of \"Z\" in the alphabet. \"Z\" is the 26th letter. Since \"A\" is the first letter and it encrypts as the number 10, we can calculate the number for \"Z\" by adding 25 to 10 (since there are 25 letters between \"A\" and \"Z\").\n\n10 + 25 = 35\n\nHowever, since the numbers are between 1 and 26, we need to wrap around the numbers. To do this, we can subtract 26 from 35:\n\n35 - 26 = 9\n\nSo, the letter \"Z\" would encrypt as the number 9."
