    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first find the factorial of 10 (10!) and then find the factorial of that result ((10!)!). Finally, we will find the remainder when this result is divided by 11.\n\nFirst, let's find 10!:\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n\nNow, let's find (10!)!:\nCalculating the factorial of 3,628,800 is computationally intensive and not practical to do by hand. However, we can use Wilson's theorem to simplify the problem.\n\nWilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p). In our case, p = 11 (which is a prime number), so we have:\n(11-1)! ≡ -1 (mod 11)\n10! ≡ -1 (mod 11)\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when (10!)! is divided by 11. Since 10! ≡ -1 (mod 11), we can rewrite (10!)! as (-1)!. However, -1 is not a valid input for a factorial function. To address this issue, we can use the property that a! ≡ a × (a-1)! (mod p). In our case, we have:\n10! ≡ 10 × 9! (mod 11)\n\nSince 10! ≡ -1 (mod 11), we can substitute -1 for 10! in the equation:\n-1 ≡ 10 × 9! (mod 11)\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when (-1)! is divided by 11. Since -1 is not a valid input for a factorial function, we can use the property that a! ≡ a × (a-1)! (mod p) again. In our case, we have:\n-1! ≡ -1 × (-2)! (mod 11)\n\nNow, we can see that the factorial function is not defined for negative numbers, and we cannot proceed further using this method.\n\nHowever, we can use another approach to solve this problem. Since 10! is divisible by 11 (as 11 is one of its factors), we can say that 10! ≡ 0 (mod 11). Now, we need to find the remainder when (10!)! is divided by 11. Since 10! ≡ 0 (mod 11), we can rewrite (10!)! as (0)!. By definition, 0! = 1, so the remainder when (10!)! is divided by 11 is 1."
