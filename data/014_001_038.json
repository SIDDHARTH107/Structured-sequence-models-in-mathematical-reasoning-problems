    "message_1": "Here's an example of a problem using RSA encryption:\n\nSuppose that Bob wants to send a confidential message to Alice using RSA encryption. Alice has a public key (e, n) where e = 17 and n = 187. Bob encrypts his message by first converting it to a number m = 13 (using an agreed upon method). He then computes c = m^e mod n and sends c to Alice.\n\nWhat is the encrypted message that Bob sends to Alice?",
    "message_2": "To find the encrypted message that Bob sends to Alice, we need to compute c = m^e mod n, where m = 13, e = 17, and n = 187.\n\nc = 13^17 mod 187\n\nFirst, calculate 13^17:\n13^17 = 865041591928470153\n\nNow, find the result modulo 187:\n865041591928470153 mod 187 = 106\n\nSo, the encrypted message that Bob sends to Alice is 106."
