    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium(s) of this game, we need to identify the strategies where no player has an incentive to deviate from their current strategy, given the other player's strategy.\n\nLet's analyze each player's best response to the other player's strategies:\n\n1. If player 2 chooses strategy X:\n   - Player 1's best response is to choose strategy B, as the payoff for (B, X) is 5, which is higher than the payoff for (A, X), which is 2.\n\n2. If player 2 chooses strategy Y:\n   - Player 1's best response is to choose strategy A, as the payoff for (A, Y) is 3, which is higher than the payoff for (B, Y), which is 0.\n\nNow let's analyze player 2's best responses:\n\n1. If player 1 chooses strategy A:\n   - Player 2's best response is to choose strategy Y, as the payoff for (A, Y) is -3, which is lower than the payoff for (A, X), which is -2.\n\n2. If player 1 chooses strategy B:\n   - Player 2's best response is to choose strategy X, as the payoff for (B, X) is -5, which is lower than the payoff for (B, Y), which is 0.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that there is a Nash equilibrium at the strategy profile (B, X). In this equilibrium, player 1 chooses strategy B, and player 2 chooses strategy X. Neither player has an incentive to deviate from their current strategy, given the other player's strategy."
