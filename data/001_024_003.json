    "message_2": "We are given that cos(x) = 0.6. We need to find sin(x) to simplify the expression cos^2(x) - sin^2(x).\n\nWe know that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 (Pythagorean identity). So, we can find sin(x) as follows:\n\nsin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x)\nsin^2(x) = 1 - (0.6)^2\nsin^2(x) = 1 - 0.36\nsin^2(x) = 0.64\n\nNow, we can find sin(x). Since we don't know the quadrant of the angle x, we will consider the positive value of sin(x) for simplification purposes:\n\nsin(x) = âˆš0.64\nsin(x) = 0.8\n\nNow, we can simplify the given expression:\n\ncos^2(x) - sin^2(x) = (0.6)^2 - (0.8)^2\ncos^2(x) - sin^2(x) = 0.36 - 0.64\ncos^2(x) - sin^2(x) = -0.28\n\nSo, the simplified trigonometric expression is -0.28."
