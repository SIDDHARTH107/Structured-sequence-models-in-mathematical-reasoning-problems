    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of the number 12345678910111213141516171819, we can use the trial division method. We start by dividing the number by the smallest prime number, 2, and continue with the next smallest prime numbers until we find a factor.\n\n12345678910111213141516171819 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. The next smallest prime number is 3.\n\n12345678910111213141516171819 รท 3 = 4115226303370404380505390607\n\nThe division is exact, so the smallest prime factor of the number 12345678910111213141516171819 is 3."
