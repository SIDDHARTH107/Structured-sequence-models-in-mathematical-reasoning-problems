    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points in the space. For the given metric $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the isometries are the transformations that preserve the Euclidean distance between points. These transformations can be classified into three types:\n\n1. Translations\n2. Rotations\n3. Reflections\n\nLet's find the matrix representation of each type of isometry with respect to the standard basis.\n\n1. Translations:\n\nA translation is a transformation that moves every point in the plane by a fixed distance in a fixed direction. The translation by a vector $\\mathbf{v} = (a, b)$ can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx' \\\\\ny'\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{pmatrix}\n+\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na \\\\\nb\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe matrix representation of a translation is the identity matrix, and the translation vector is added to the coordinates of the points.\n\n2. Rotations:\n\nA rotation is a transformation that turns the plane around a fixed point, called the center of rotation. The rotation by an angle $\\theta$ around the origin can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx' \\\\\ny'\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta \\\\\n\\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe matrix representation of a rotation is a 2x2 orthogonal matrix with determinant equal to 1.\n\n3. Reflections:\n\nA reflection is a transformation that flips the plane over a fixed line, called the axis of reflection. The reflection over the line $y = mx$ can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx' \\\\\ny'\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\frac{1}{1+m^2}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1-m^2 & 2m \\\\\n2m & m^2-1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe matrix representation of a reflection is a 2x2 orthogonal matrix with determinant equal to -1.\n\nIn summary, the isometries of the given metric are translations, rotations, and reflections, and their matrix representations with respect to the standard basis are given above."
