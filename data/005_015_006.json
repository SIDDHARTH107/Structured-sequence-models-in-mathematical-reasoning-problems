    "message_1": "A university conducted a survey of 100 students about their favorite sports. The data was collected and analyzed using cluster analysis to group the students into similar preference clusters. The results showed that there were 3 clusters: Cluster 1 had 35 football fans, Cluster 2 had 27 basketball fans, and Cluster 3 had 38 cricket fans. \n\nWhat is the percentage of students in each cluster among the surveyed students?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of students in each cluster, we will divide the number of students in each cluster by the total number of surveyed students and then multiply by 100.\n\nCluster 1 (Football fans):\nPercentage = (35 / 100) * 100 = 35%\n\nCluster 2 (Basketball fans):\nPercentage = (27 / 100) * 100 = 27%\n\nCluster 3 (Cricket fans):\nPercentage = (38 / 100) * 100 = 38%\n\nSo, among the surveyed students, 35% are in Cluster 1 (Football fans), 27% are in Cluster 2 (Basketball fans), and 38% are in Cluster 3 (Cricket fans)."
