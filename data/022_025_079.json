Express your answer in terms of m, L, and ħ.",
    "message_2": "For the given potential well, V(x) = 0 for 0 ≤ x ≤ L. Therefore, the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\n(∂²/∂x² + 2mE/ħ²)ψ(x) = 0.\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation, and its general solution is:\n\nψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx),\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions. Since the potential is infinite outside the interval [0, L], the wave function must be zero at x = 0 and x = L:\n\nψ(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0,\nψ(L) = A sin(kL) = 0.\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise, the wave function would be identically zero), we must have sin(kL) = 0. This means that kL = nπ for some positive integer n. The smallest nonzero value of n is 1, which corresponds to the ground state (minimum energy) of the particle. Therefore, kL = π, and k = π/L.\n\nNow we can find the minimum energy E:\n\nE = (ħk)²/(2m) = (ħ(π/L))²/(2m) = (ħ²π²)/(2mL²).\n\nSo, the minimum energy E of the particle in the one-dimensional potential well is:\n\nE = (ħ²π²)/(2mL²)."
