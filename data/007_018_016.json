    "message_2": "A prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest prime gap greater than 1000, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Start with a prime number, say p.\n2. Find the next prime number, say q.\n3. Calculate the prime gap, g = q - p.\n4. If g > 1000, we found the smallest prime gap greater than 1000.\n5. If g <= 1000, repeat steps 2-4 with p = q.\n\nUsing this approach, we find that the smallest prime gap greater than 1000 occurs between the prime numbers 26861 and 26903. The prime gap is:\n\ng = 26903 - 26861 = 42\n\nSo, the smallest prime gap greater than 1000 is 42."
