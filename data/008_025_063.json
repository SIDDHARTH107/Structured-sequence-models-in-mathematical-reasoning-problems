    "message_2": "To show that the given system of linear equations has no solution, we can try to find a contradiction by manipulating the equations.\n\nFirst, let's try to eliminate one of the variables by using the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we can use the elimination method. Notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation:\n\n(2x + 3y = 7) * 2 => 4x + 6y = 14\n\nSince the second equation is a multiple of the first equation, they represent the same line. In other words, they are dependent and have infinitely many solutions, not no solution. Therefore, there is a contradiction in the problem statement, and the system of linear equations does not have no solution."
