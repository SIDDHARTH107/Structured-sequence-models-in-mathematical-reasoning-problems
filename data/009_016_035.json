    "message_1": "A common problem in Laplace's equation for electrostatics is to find the electric potential of a specific charge distribution. Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA charge distribution consists of two point charges: +2 μC at (0, 0) and -3 μC at (3, 0). Determine the electric potential at the point (2, 2).",
    "message_2": "To determine the electric potential at the point (2, 2), we need to calculate the potential due to each point charge and then sum them up. The formula for the electric potential V due to a point charge q at a distance r is:\n\nV = k * q / r\n\nwhere k is the electrostatic constant, approximately 8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2.\n\nFirst, let's find the distance between each point charge and the point (2, 2):\n\nFor the +2 μC charge at (0, 0):\nr1 = sqrt((2 - 0)^2 + (2 - 0)^2) = sqrt(8)\n\nFor the -3 μC charge at (3, 0):\nr2 = sqrt((2 - 3)^2 + (2 - 0)^2) = sqrt(5)\n\nNow, let's calculate the electric potential due to each charge:\n\nV1 = k * q1 / r1 = (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (2 * 10^-6 C) / sqrt(8)\nV2 = k * q2 / r2 = (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (-3 * 10^-6 C) / sqrt(5)\n\nFinally, let's sum up the potentials:\n\nV_total = V1 + V2\n\nV_total = (8.99 * 10^9 * 2 * 10^-6 / sqrt(8)) + (8.99 * 10^9 * -3 * 10^-6 / sqrt(5))\n\nV_total ≈ 2.52 * 10^3 V - 3.81 * 10^3 V\n\nV_total ≈ -1.29 * 10^3 V\n\nSo, the electric potential at the point (2, 2) is approximately -1.29 * 10^3 V."
