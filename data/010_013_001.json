    "message_2": "The rank of a vector bundle is the dimension of its fibers. Given that both $E$ and $F$ are of rank $n$, their fibers have dimension $n$. \n\nThe direct sum of two vector bundles, $E \\oplus F$, is a new vector bundle whose fibers are the direct sum of the fibers of $E$ and $F$. In this case, the fiber of $E \\oplus F$ at a point $x \\in X$ is given by $(E \\oplus F)_x = E_x \\oplus F_x$. \n\nSince the direct sum of two vector spaces has a dimension equal to the sum of the dimensions of the original vector spaces, the dimension of the fiber $(E \\oplus F)_x$ is $n + n = 2n$. \n\nTherefore, the rank of the vector bundle $E \\oplus F$ is $2n$."
