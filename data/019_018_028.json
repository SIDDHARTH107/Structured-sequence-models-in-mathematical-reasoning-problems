    "message_2": "Proof by contrapositive:\nWe want to prove that \"If x is an even integer, then x^2 is an even integer.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If x^2 is not an even integer, then x is not an even integer.\" If we can prove the contrapositive, then the original statement is also true.\n\nAssume that x^2 is not an even integer. This means that x^2 is an odd integer. An odd integer can be written in the form 2k + 1, where k is an integer. So, x^2 = 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nNow, let's consider the square of an odd integer. If x is an odd integer, it can be written in the form 2m + 1, where m is an integer. Then, x^2 = (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 2(2m^2 + 2m) + 1. This is in the form of 2k + 1, which confirms that x^2 is an odd integer.\n\nSince x^2 is an odd integer, x must also be an odd integer (not an even integer). Thus, we have proven the contrapositive, and the original statement \"If x is an even integer, then x^2 is an even integer\" is true.\n\nProof by contradiction:\nNow, we want to prove that \"If x is an even integer, then x+1 is an odd integer.\" We will use proof by contradiction. Assume the opposite of the statement, which is \"If x is an even integer, then x+1 is not an odd integer (i.e., x+1 is an even integer).\"\n\nLet x be an even integer, which means x = 2n for some integer n. Then, x + 1 = 2n + 1. Since 2n is an even integer, 2n + 1 is an odd integer (as it is one more than an even integer). This contradicts our assumption that x+1 is an even integer.\n\nTherefore, our assumption was false, and the original statement \"If x is an even integer, then x+1 is an odd integer\" is true."
