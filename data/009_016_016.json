    "message_1": "A rectangular metal plate with length 5 cm and width 3 cm is grounded. The potential along the longer sides of the plate is held at zero volts while a potential of 10 volts is applied along the shorter sides. Find the electric potential at any point inside the metal plate if the Laplace's equation is satisfied.",
    "message_2": "To find the electric potential at any point inside the metal plate, we can use the method of separation of variables to solve Laplace's equation. Laplace's equation in two dimensions is given by:\n\n∇²V(x, y) = ∂²V/∂x² + ∂²V/∂y² = 0\n\nWe assume a solution of the form V(x, y) = X(x)Y(y) and substitute it into Laplace's equation:\n\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0\n\nNow, divide both sides by X(x)Y(y):\n\nX''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y) = 0\n\nSince the left side is a function of x and the right side is a function of y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -k²:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -k²\nY''(y)/Y(y) = k²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + k²X(x) = 0\nY''(y) - k²Y(y) = 0\n\nSolving the first equation for X(x), we get:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(kx) + B*sin(kx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions for the longer sides of the plate (x = 0 and x = 5), we get:\n\nX(0) = A = 0 (since the potential is 0 along the longer sides)\nX(5) = B*sin(5k) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), sin(5k) must be zero. This implies that 5k = nπ, where n is an integer. So, k = nπ/5.\n\nNow, the solution for X(x) becomes:\n\nX(x) = B*sin(nπx/5)\n\nSolving the second equation for Y(y), we get:\n\nY(y) = C*cosh(nπy/5) + D*sinh(nπy/5)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions for the shorter sides of the plate (y = 0 and y = 3), we get:\n\nY(0) = C = 0 (since the potential is 0 along the longer sides)\nY(3) = D*sinh(nπ*3/5) = 10 (since the potential is 10 volts along the shorter sides)\n\nNow, the solution for Y(y) becomes:\n\nY(y) = D*sinh(nπy/5)\n\nThe general solution for V(x, y) is given by the sum of all possible solutions for different values of n:\n\nV(x, y) = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/5) * D_n * sinh(nπy/5)]\n\nTo find the coefficients B_n and D_n, we can use Fourier series:\n\nB_n = (2/5) * ∫[V(x, 0) * sin(nπx/5)] dx from 0 to 5\nD_n = (1/10) * (10/sinh(nπ*3/5))\n\nSince V(x, 0) = 0, B_n = 0 for all n. Therefore, the electric potential at any point inside the metal plate is given by:\n\nV(x, y) = Σ [(1/10) * (10/sinh(nπ*3/5)) * sin(nπx/5) * sinh(nπy/5)]\n\nThis infinite series converges and gives the electric potential at any point (x, y) inside the metal plate."
