    "message_1": "A disease spreads through a population of 10,000 people. The rate of new infections is given by dI/dt = 0.5*I*(1-I/10000), where I is the number of infected individuals and t is time in days. Find the maximum number of infected individuals at any given time, and the time it takes to reach this maximum.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of infected individuals, we need to find the critical points of the function I(t). To do this, we first need to solve the differential equation dI/dt = 0.5*I*(1-I/10000).\n\nLet's rewrite the equation as:\n\ndI/dt = 0.5*I*(10000 - I)/10000\n\nNow, let's use the separation of variables method:\n\n(1/I) * dI = (0.5/10000) * (10000 - I) * dt\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/I) dI = ∫(0.5/10000) * (10000 - I) dt\n\nln(I) = -0.5/10000 * I^2/2 + 0.5/10000 * 10000 * t + C\n\nNow, we need to find the constant C. Let's assume that at t=0, there is one infected individual (I=1):\n\nln(1) = -0.5/10000 * 1^2/2 + 0.5/10000 * 10000 * 0 + C\n\n0 = C\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nln(I) = -0.5/10000 * I^2/2 + 0.5/10000 * 10000 * t\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points of I(t) by taking the derivative with respect to t and setting it to zero:\n\ndI/dt = 0.5*(1 - I/10000)\n\n0 = 0.5*(1 - I/10000)\n\nI/10000 = 1 - I/10000\n\nI = 5000\n\nSo, the maximum number of infected individuals is 5000.\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes to reach this maximum. Plug I = 5000 back into the equation:\n\nln(5000) = -0.5/10000 * 5000^2/2 + 0.5/10000 * 10000 * t\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt = (ln(5000) + 0.5/10000 * 5000^2/2) / (0.5/10000 * 10000)\n\nt ≈ 6.9078\n\nSo, it takes approximately 6.91 days to reach the maximum number of infected individuals, which is 5000."
