    "message_2": "To determine the electric field between the plates, we can use the formula:\n\nE = V/d\n\nwhere E is the electric field, V is the voltage, and d is the plate separation.\n\nE = (500 V) / (4 mm) = (500 V) / (0.004 m) = 125,000 V/m\n\nNow, to determine the amount of stored electric energy in the capacitor, we first need to find the capacitance (C) using the formula:\n\nC = ε₀ * A / d\n\nwhere ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^(-12) F/m), A is the plate area, and d is the plate separation.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the plate area from cm² to m²:\n\nA = 100 cm² = 0.01 m²\n\nNow, we can find the capacitance:\n\nC = (8.854 x 10^(-12) F/m) * (0.01 m²) / (0.004 m) = 2.2135 x 10^(-11) F\n\nNext, we can find the stored electric energy (U) using the formula:\n\nU = 0.5 * C * V²\n\nU = 0.5 * (2.2135 x 10^(-11) F) * (500 V)² = 0.5 * (2.2135 x 10^(-11) F) * (250,000 V²) = 2.766875 x 10^(-6) J\n\nSo, the electric field between the plates is 125,000 V/m, and the amount of stored electric energy in the capacitor is 2.766875 x 10^(-6) J."
