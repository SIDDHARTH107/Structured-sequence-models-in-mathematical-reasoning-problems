Assume that you have a continuous function $f_t: S^2 \\rightarrow S^2$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ that satisfies $f_0=id$ and $f_1(p)=p$, where $id$ is the identity map. \n\nWhat is the value of the homotopy group $\\pi_1(S^2 \\setminus \\{p\\})$?",
    "message_2": "The homotopy group $\\pi_1(S^2 \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the space $S^2 \\setminus \\{p\\}$, which is the group of homotopy classes of loops based at a point in $S^2 \\setminus \\{p\\}$.\n\nSince $S^2 \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we can compute the fundamental group of $S^2 \\setminus \\{p\\}$ by computing the fundamental group of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. \n\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a contractible space, meaning that it can be continuously deformed to a point. In particular, any loop in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can be continuously contracted to a point, so every loop is homotopic to the constant loop. Therefore, the fundamental group of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the trivial group, which contains only the identity element.\n\nThus, the homotopy group $\\pi_1(S^2 \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is isomorphic to the trivial group, which has only one element."
