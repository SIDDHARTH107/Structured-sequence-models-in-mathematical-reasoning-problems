    "message_2": "The Busy Beaver function, denoted as BB(n), is a function that gives the maximum number of steps a Turing machine with n states can take before halting, when started on a blank tape. For a two-state Turing machine, the Busy Beaver function value is BB(2) = 6. This means that the maximum number of steps a two-state Turing machine can take before halting is 6."
