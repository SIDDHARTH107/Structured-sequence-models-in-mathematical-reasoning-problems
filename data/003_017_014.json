    "message_2": "To find the average value of a function over an interval [a, b], we can use the formula:\n\naverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = 2sin(x), and the interval is [0, π]. So we have:\n\naverage value = (1/(π-0)) * ∫[0, π] 2sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to integrate 2sin(x) with respect to x:\n\n∫2sin(x) dx = -2cos(x) + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral over the interval [0, π]:\n\n[-2cos(x)](from 0 to π) = -2cos(π) - (-2cos(0)) = -2(-1) - (-2(1)) = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nNow, we can find the average value:\n\naverage value = (1/(π-0)) * 4 = 4/π\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) over the interval [0, π] is 4/π."
