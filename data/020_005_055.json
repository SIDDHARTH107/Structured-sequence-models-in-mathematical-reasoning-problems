    "message_1": "A furniture manufacturer produces two types of chairs: a regular chair which sells for $50 and a luxury chair which sells for $100. The production of a regular chair requires 2 hours of labour and 3 units of wood, whereas the production of a luxury chair requires 4 hours of labour and 5 units of wood. The manufacturer has 80 hours of labour and 90 units of wood available for production. What is the maximum profit that can be made by the manufacturer? How many chairs of each type should be produced to achieve the maximum profit? (Assume all chairs produced are sold.)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of regular chairs produced and y be the number of luxury chairs produced.\n\nThe constraints for labor and wood can be expressed as:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 80 (labor constraint)\n3x + 5y ≤ 90 (wood constraint)\n\nThe profit function can be expressed as:\n\nP(x, y) = 50x + 100y\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the feasible region determined by the constraints and then evaluate the profit function at the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 80\nx + 2y ≤ 40\ny ≤ (40 - x) / 2\n\n3x + 5y ≤ 90\ny ≤ (90 - 3x) / 5\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 20), (15, 10), and (30, 0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 50(0) + 100(0) = $0\nP(0, 20) = 50(0) + 100(20) = $2000\nP(15, 10) = 50(15) + 100(10) = $1750\nP(30, 0) = 50(30) + 100(0) = $1500\n\nThe maximum profit is $2000, which occurs when the manufacturer produces 0 regular chairs and 20 luxury chairs."
