    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 18, we need to analyze the prime factorization of 18, which is 2 × 3^2. There are two possibilities for the structure of a group of order 18: either it is a semi-direct product of two smaller groups, or it is a direct product of two smaller groups.\n\n1. Direct product: The only possibility for a direct product is Z_2 × Z_9, which is isomorphic to Z_18.\n\n2. Semi-direct product: We have two possibilities for the semi-direct product: Z_9 ⋊ Z_2 and Z_3^2 ⋊ Z_2. \n\nFor Z_9 ⋊ Z_2, there is only one non-trivial homomorphism from Z_2 to Aut(Z_9), which has order 6. This gives us one non-isomorphic group.\n\nFor Z_3^2 ⋊ Z_2, there are two non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_2 to Aut(Z_3^2), which has order 6. However, one of these homomorphisms results in a group isomorphic to the one obtained from Z_9 ⋊ Z_2. Thus, we only get one additional non-isomorphic group from this case.\n\nIn total, there are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 18: Z_18, and two groups obtained from the semi-direct products."
