    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2, we will apply the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nFor our function, we have three terms: 3x^2, 5x, and -2.\n\n1. For the first term, 3x^2, n = 2. Applying the power rule, we get:\n   (2) * 3x^(2-1) = 6x^1 = 6x\n\n2. For the second term, 5x, n = 1. Applying the power rule, we get:\n   (1) * 5x^(1-1) = 5x^0 = 5\n\n3. For the third term, -2, n = 0. Since the derivative of a constant is 0, the derivative of this term is 0.\n\nNow, we add the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 5\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2 is f'(x) = 6x + 5."
