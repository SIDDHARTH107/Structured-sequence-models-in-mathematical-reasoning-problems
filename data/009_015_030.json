    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question:\n\nA sample of radioactive material has a half-life of 10 days. If the initial mass of the sample is 500 grams, how much of the material will be left after 30 days? Round your answer to the nearest tenth.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential decay:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 500 grams, the time elapsed is 30 days, and the half-life is 10 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/2)^(30/10)\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/2)^3\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/8)\nFinal mass = 62.5 grams\n\nSo, after 30 days, there will be approximately 62.5 grams of the radioactive material left. Rounded to the nearest tenth, the answer is 62.5 grams."
