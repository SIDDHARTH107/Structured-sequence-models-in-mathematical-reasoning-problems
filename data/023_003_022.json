    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) with the given boundary conditions, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution u(x, y) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending on x and the other depending on y:\n\n$$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$$\n\nNow, we will substitute this into the given PDE:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}=-2$$\n$$\\Rightarrow X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = -2$$\n\nNow, we will divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -2$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-k^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2 - \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}$$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1) $$X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0$$\n2) $$Y''(y) - (k^2 + 2)Y(y) = 0$$\n\nNow, we will solve these ODEs with the given boundary conditions:\n\nFor X(x):\n$$X(0) = 0, X(1) = 1$$\n\nFor Y(y):\n$$Y(0) = 0, Y(1) = 0$$\n\nThe general solution for the ODEs are:\n\n1) $$X(x) = A\\sin(kx) + B\\cos(kx)$$\n2) $$Y(y) = C\\sinh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 2}y) + D\\cosh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 2}y)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nFor X(x):\n$$X(0) = B = 0$$\n$$X(1) = A\\sin(k) = 1$$\n\nFor Y(y):\n$$Y(0) = D = 0$$\n$$Y(1) = C\\sinh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 2}) = 0$$\n\nSince $C\\neq 0$, we must have:\n\n$$\\sinh(\\sqrt{k^2 + 2}) = 0$$\n\nHowever, this equation has no non-trivial solutions for k. Therefore, we must consider a Fourier series solution for the given PDE.\n\nLet's rewrite the solution u(x, y) as a sum of Fourier sine series:\n\n$$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n\\pi x)Y_n(y)$$\n\nNow, we will substitute this into the given PDE:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (-n^2\\pi^2 A_n \\sin(n\\pi x)Y_n(y) + A_n \\sin(n\\pi x)Y_n''(y)) = -2$$\n\nComparing the coefficients of $\\sin(n\\pi x)$, we get:\n\n$$-n^2\\pi^2 A_n Y_n(y) + A_n Y_n''(y) = -2$$\n\nNow, we have the following ODE for $Y_n(y)$:\n\n$$Y_n''(y) - n^2\\pi^2 Y_n(y) = -2$$\n\nThe general solution for this ODE is:\n\n$$Y_n(y) = C_n\\sinh(n\\pi y) + D_n\\cosh(n\\pi y) + \\frac{2}{n^2\\pi^2}$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions for Y(y):\n\n$$Y_n(0) = D_n + \\frac{2}{n^2\\pi^2} = 0 \\Rightarrow D_n = -\\frac{2}{n^2\\pi^2}$$\n$$Y_n(1) = C_n\\sinh(n\\pi) - \\frac{2}{n^2\\pi^2} = 0$$\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$$Y_n(y) = C_n\\sinh(n\\pi y) - \\frac{2}{n^2\\pi^2}$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the Fourier series solution:\n\n$$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n\\pi x)(C_n\\sinh(n\\pi y) - \\frac{2}{n^2\\pi^2})$$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $u(1, y) = 1$:\n\n$$1 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n\\pi)(C_n\\sinh(n\\pi y) - \\frac{2}{n^2\\pi^2})$$\n\nSince $A_n \\sin(n\\pi) = 1$, we have $A_n = \\frac{1}{\\sin(n\\pi)}$.\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series solution for the given PDE:\n\n$$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sin(n\\pi)} \\sin(n\\pi x)(C_n\\sinh(n\\pi y) - \\frac{2}{n^2\\pi^2})$$"
