    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √75, we need to find the prime factors of 75 and look for any perfect squares.\n\n75 = 3 × 25\nSince 25 is a perfect square (5 × 5), we can simplify the expression as follows:\n\n√75 = √(3 × 25) = √(3 × 5²)\n\nNow, we can separate the square root of the perfect square:\n\n√75 = 5√3\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is 5√3."
