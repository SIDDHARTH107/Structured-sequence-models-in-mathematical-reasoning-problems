    "message_1": "A square pulse of electric current of height 4A and width 1ms is injected into a coaxial cable with propagation speed 2.5x10^8m/s. How far from the injection point is the pulse when its front has traveled 1/3 of the length of the coaxial cable?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the coaxial cable as L. Since the front of the pulse has traveled 1/3 of the length of the cable, the distance it has traveled is (1/3)L.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for distance, which is:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\nIn this case, the speed is the propagation speed of the coaxial cable, which is 2.5 × 10^8 m/s. We need to find the time it takes for the pulse to travel (1/3)L.\n\nLet's denote the time as t. We can rearrange the formula to solve for t:\n\nt = Distance / Speed\n\nt = (1/3)L / (2.5 × 10^8 m/s)\n\nNow we have an expression for the time it takes for the pulse to travel 1/3 of the length of the coaxial cable. To find the distance from the injection point, we can plug this time back into the distance formula:\n\nDistance_from_injection = Speed × Time\n\nDistance_from_injection = (2.5 × 10^8 m/s) × [(1/3)L / (2.5 × 10^8 m/s)]\n\nThe (2.5 × 10^8 m/s) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving:\n\nDistance_from_injection = (1/3)L\n\nSo, the distance from the injection point when the front of the pulse has traveled 1/3 of the length of the coaxial cable is (1/3)L."
