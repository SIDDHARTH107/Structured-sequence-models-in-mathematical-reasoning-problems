    "message_2": "A twin prime pair consists of two prime numbers that differ by 2. To find the smallest twin prime pair greater than or equal to 100, we can start by checking prime numbers greater than or equal to 100 and see if their neighbor (the number 2 greater than the prime) is also prime.\n\nThe first prime number greater than or equal to 100 is 101. The number 2 greater than 101 is 103, which is also a prime number. Therefore, the smallest twin prime pair greater than or equal to 100 is (101, 103)."
