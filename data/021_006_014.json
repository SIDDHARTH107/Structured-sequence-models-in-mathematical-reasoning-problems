    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM) with linear triangular elements and piecewise linear basis functions, we first need to discretize the spatial domain and then apply the Galerkin method to obtain a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can be solved for u(x,t) at the specified time points.\n\n1. Discretize the spatial domain:\nDivide the interval [0, 1] into N equal subintervals, with N+1 nodes x_i, i = 0, 1, ..., N. Let h = 1/N be the length of each subinterval. In this case, we will use linear triangular elements, so the basis functions will be piecewise linear functions.\n\n2. Define the basis functions:\nLet φ_i(x) be the piecewise linear basis function associated with node x_i, such that φ_i(x_i) = 1 and φ_i(x_j) = 0 for j ≠ i. The approximate solution u(x,t) can be written as a linear combination of the basis functions:\n\nu(x,t) ≈ ∑[U_i(t) * φ_i(x)]\n\n3. Apply the Galerkin method:\nMultiply the PDE by a test function φ_j(x) and integrate over the spatial domain:\n\n∫[∂u/∂t * φ_j(x) dx] = ∫[∂²u/∂x² * φ_j(x) dx]\n\nSubstitute the approximate solution u(x,t) into the equation:\n\n∫[∂(∑[U_i(t) * φ_i(x)])/∂t * φ_j(x) dx] = ∫[∂²(∑[U_i(t) * φ_i(x)])/∂x² * φ_j(x) dx]\n\nThis results in a system of ODEs for the coefficients U_i(t):\n\n∑[dU_i(t)/dt * ∫[φ_i(x) * φ_j(x) dx]] = ∑[U_i(t) * ∫[∂²φ_i(x)/∂x² * φ_j(x) dx]]\n\n4. Assemble the mass and stiffness matrices:\nDefine the mass matrix M and the stiffness matrix K as follows:\n\nM_ij = ∫[φ_i(x) * φ_j(x) dx]\nK_ij = ∫[∂²φ_i(x)/∂x² * φ_j(x) dx]\n\nThe system of ODEs can be written in matrix form as:\n\ndU(t)/dt = M^(-1) * K * U(t)\n\n5. Apply the initial and boundary conditions:\nThe initial condition u(x,0) = sin(πx) can be used to find the initial coefficients U_i(0):\n\nU_i(0) = ∫[sin(πx) * φ_i(x) dx]\n\nThe boundary conditions u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0 imply that U_0(t) = U_N(t) = 0 for all t.\n\n6. Solve the system of ODEs:\nUse a numerical method, such as the implicit Euler method or the Crank-Nicolson method, to solve the system of ODEs for U(t) at the specified time points t = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4.\n\n7. Compute the approximate solution u(x,t):\nOnce the coefficients U_i(t) are obtained, the approximate solution u(x,t) can be found by evaluating the linear combination of the basis functions:\n\nu(x,t) ≈ ∑[U_i(t) * φ_i(x)]\n\nThis will give the approximate solution of the PDE at the specified time points using the finite element method with linear triangular elements and piecewise linear basis functions."
