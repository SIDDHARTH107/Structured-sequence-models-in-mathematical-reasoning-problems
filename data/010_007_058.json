Suppose that the fundamental group of X is isomorphic to the integers, i.e., pi_1(X) ~= Z. Determine the number of non-isomorphic connected covering spaces of X up to homeomorphism that have at most three sheets.",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic connected covering spaces of X with at most three sheets, we will use the correspondence between subgroups of the fundamental group and covering spaces.\n\nSince the fundamental group of X is isomorphic to the integers, pi_1(X) ~= Z, we can consider the subgroups of Z. The subgroups of Z are of the form nZ, where n is a non-negative integer. In our case, we are interested in subgroups corresponding to covering spaces with at most three sheets, so we will consider n = 1, 2, and 3.\n\n1. n = 1: The subgroup 1Z = Z corresponds to the trivial covering, which is just X itself.\n\n2. n = 2: The subgroup 2Z corresponds to a 2-sheeted covering space of X. Since 2Z is a normal subgroup of Z, this covering space is unique up to homeomorphism.\n\n3. n = 3: The subgroup 3Z corresponds to a 3-sheeted covering space of X. Similar to the case of n = 2, 3Z is a normal subgroup of Z, so this covering space is unique up to homeomorphism.\n\nThus, there are three non-isomorphic connected covering spaces of X up to homeomorphism that have at most three sheets: the trivial covering (X itself), a 2-sheeted covering space, and a 3-sheeted covering space."
