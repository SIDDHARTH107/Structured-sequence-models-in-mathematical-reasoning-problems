    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first few perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128. Perfect numbers can be generated using the formula 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1), where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers.\n\nThe first seven perfect numbers are generated with the following prime values of p: 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, and 19. The next prime number is 31, but 2^31 - 1 is not prime. The next prime number is 61, and 2^61 - 1 is prime. Therefore, the eighth perfect number is generated using p = 61:\n\n2^(61-1) * (2^61 - 1) = 2^60 * (2^61 - 1) = 2,305,843,009,213,693,952.\n\nSo, the eighth perfect number is 2,305,843,009,213,693,952."
