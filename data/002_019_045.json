    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a right circular cone, we need to find the area of the base and the lateral area, and then add them together. The formula for the surface area of a cone is given by:\n\nSurface Area = Base Area + Lateral Area\n\nThe base of the cone is a circle, so we can find its area using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nBase Area = π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base.\n\nThe lateral area of the cone can be found using the formula:\n\nLateral Area = π * r * l\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base and l is the slant height of the cone.\n\nGiven that the radius (r) is 4 cm and the slant height (l) is 10 cm, we can now find the surface area of the cone:\n\nBase Area = π * (4^2) = 16π cm^2\n\nLateral Area = π * 4 * 10 = 40π cm^2\n\nNow, we can add the base area and the lateral area to find the total surface area:\n\nSurface Area = Base Area + Lateral Area = 16π + 40π = 56π cm^2\n\nTo round the answer to the nearest tenth, we can use the value of π ≈ 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 56 * 3.14 = 175.84 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 175.8 cm^2 when rounded to the nearest tenth."
