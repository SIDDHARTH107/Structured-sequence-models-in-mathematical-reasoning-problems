    "message_1": "Here's an example problem for the math student to solve:\n\nConsider a system described by a differential equation: y''(t) - 4y'(t) + 4y(t) = u(t), where y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 2. The input function u(t) is subject to the constraint that it satisfies |u(t)| ≤ 1 for all t ≥ 0. Find the optimal input function u(t) that minimizes the objective J, where J is defined as the integral of (y(t) - 0)^2 dt from t = 0 to t = 2.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the general solution for the homogeneous equation y''(t) - 4y'(t) + 4y(t) = 0. The characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is:\n\nr^2 - 4r + 4 = 0\n\nThis can be factored as:\n\n(r - 2)^2 = 0\n\nThe solution to this equation is r = 2, which is a repeated root. Therefore, the general solution for the homogeneous equation is:\n\ny_h(t) = (C1 + C2*t) * e^(2t)\n\nNow, we need to find a particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation y''(t) - 4y'(t) + 4y(t) = u(t). Since u(t) is an arbitrary function, we can use the method of variation of parameters. We assume the particular solution is in the form:\n\ny_p(t) = v1(t) * e^(2t) + v2(t) * t * e^(2t)\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives of y_p(t), we get:\n\ny_p'(t) = v1'(t) * e^(2t) + 2 * v1(t) * e^(2t) + v2'(t) * t * e^(2t) + (2 * v2(t) + v2'(t)) * e^(2t)\n\ny_p''(t) = v1''(t) * e^(2t) + 4 * v1'(t) * e^(2t) + 4 * v1(t) * e^(2t) + v2''(t) * t * e^(2t) + (4 * v2'(t) + 2 * v2''(t)) * e^(2t) + 4 * v2'(t) * e^(2t) + 4 * v2(t) * e^(2t)\n\nSubstituting y_p(t), y_p'(t), and y_p''(t) into the non-homogeneous equation, we get:\n\nu(t) = v1''(t) * e^(2t) + 4 * v1'(t) * e^(2t) + 2 * v2''(t) * e^(2t)\n\nNow, we apply the variation of parameters method by setting:\n\nv1''(t) * e^(2t) = 0\n4 * v1'(t) * e^(2t) + 2 * v2''(t) * e^(2t) = u(t)\n\nSolving the first equation, we get:\n\nv1'(t) = C3\nv1(t) = C3 * t + C4\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n4 * C3 * e^(2t) + 2 * v2''(t) * e^(2t) = u(t)\n\nv2''(t) = (u(t) - 4 * C3) / 2\n\nIntegrating twice, we get:\n\nv2'(t) = ∫(u(t) - 4 * C3) / 2 dt + C5\nv2(t) = ∫(∫(u(t) - 4 * C3) / 2 dt + C5) dt + C6\n\nNow, we can write the particular solution as:\n\ny_p(t) = (C3 * t + C4) * e^(2t) + (∫(∫(u(t) - 4 * C3) / 2 dt + C5) dt + C6) * t * e^(2t)\n\nThe general solution for the non-homogeneous equation is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n\ny(t) = y_h(t) + y_p(t)\n\nApplying the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 2, we can solve for the constants C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6. However, since we are looking for the optimal input function u(t) that minimizes the objective J, we can focus on the particular solution y_p(t) as it contains u(t).\n\nTo minimize the objective J, we need to find u(t) that minimizes the integral of (y_p(t))^2 dt from t = 0 to t = 2, subject to the constraint |u(t)| ≤ 1 for all t ≥ 0. This is an optimal control problem that can be solved using calculus of variations and Pontryagin's minimum principle. However, the solution to this problem depends on the specific form of u(t) and may require numerical methods to find the optimal input function u(t)."
