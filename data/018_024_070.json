    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference between A and B. The symmetric difference between two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in both. \n\nA symmetric difference B = {x: x ∈ A and x ∉ B} ∪ {x: x ∈ B and x ∉ A}\n\nA symmetric difference B = {3, 5} ∪ {2, 4} = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A union B. The complement of a set is the set of elements that are not in the given set. \n\nA union B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nAssuming the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B, the complement of A union B can be found as:\n\nC = U - (A union B)\n\nSince we don't have a specific universal set, we can't find the exact elements in C. However, we can still find the symmetric difference between (A symmetric difference B) and C.\n\n(A symmetric difference B) symmetric difference C = {x: x ∈ (A symmetric difference B) and x ∉ C} ∪ {x: x ∈ C and x ∉ (A symmetric difference B)}\n\nNow, let's show that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement. To do this, we need to show that (A symmetric difference B) symmetric difference C ≠ (A symmetric difference C) symmetric difference (B symmetric difference C).\n\nLet's find (A symmetric difference C) and (B symmetric difference C):\n\nA symmetric difference C = {x: x ∈ A and x ∉ C} ∪ {x: x ∈ C and x ∉ A}\nB symmetric difference C = {x: x ∈ B and x ∉ C} ∪ {x: x ∈ C and x ∉ B}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between (A symmetric difference C) and (B symmetric difference C):\n\n(A symmetric difference C) symmetric difference (B symmetric difference C) = {x: x ∈ (A symmetric difference C) and x ∉ (B symmetric difference C)} ∪ {x: x ∈ (B symmetric difference C) and x ∉ (A symmetric difference C)}\n\nSince we don't have a specific universal set, we can't find the exact elements in (A symmetric difference C) and (B symmetric difference C). However, we can see that the expressions for (A symmetric difference B) symmetric difference C and (A symmetric difference C) symmetric difference (B symmetric difference C) are different. Therefore, the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement."
