    "message_1": "A manufacturer must decide on the optimal production levels of two products, A and B, to maximize profits. The profit on product A is $10 per unit and the profit on product B is $15 per unit. However, the demand for each product is uncertain and ranges from 100 to 150 units per day for product A and 75 to 125 units per day for product B. The manufacturer wants to ensure that no matter what the actual demand is, they will earn at least $500 in profit per day. What is the minimum number of units of each product the manufacturer must produce to guarantee a profit of at least $500 per day under any demand scenario?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to find the minimum values of x and y such that the profit is at least $500 per day under any demand scenario.\n\nThe profit function is given by P(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nWe need to consider the worst-case scenario for demand, which is when the demand for product A is at its lowest (100 units) and the demand for product B is at its lowest (75 units). In this case, we want to ensure that the profit is at least $500.\n\nSo, we have the inequality:\n\n10x + 15y â‰¥ 500\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum values of x and y that satisfy this inequality. Since the demand for product A is at least 100 units and the demand for product B is at least 75 units, we can start by setting x = 100 and y = 75.\n\n10(100) + 15(75) = 1000 + 1125 = 2125\n\nSince 2125 is greater than 500, this production level guarantees a profit of at least $500 per day under any demand scenario. Therefore, the manufacturer must produce at least 100 units of product A and 75 units of product B to guarantee a profit of at least $500 per day."
