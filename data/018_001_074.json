    "message_2": "Yes, the empty set is a subset of set A. \n\nTo prove this, we need to use the subset definition of set theory. According to the definition, a set B is a subset of a set A (denoted as B ⊆ A) if and only if every element of B is also an element of A.\n\nThe empty set, denoted as ∅, is a set with no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A. Since there are no elements in the empty set to contradict the subset definition, we can conclude that the empty set is a subset of any set, including set A.\n\nSo, ∅ ⊆ A, where A = {2, 4, 6}."
