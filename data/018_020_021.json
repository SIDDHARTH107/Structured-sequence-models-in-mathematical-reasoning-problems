    "message_2": "First, we need to find the symmetric difference (A Δ B) between sets A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nIntersection of A and B: {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, we find the elements in A or B but not in their intersection:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 5}\n\nNext, we need to find the union of the symmetric difference (A Δ B) and set C:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 5}\nC = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nThe union of two sets is the set containing all elements from both sets:\n\n(A Δ B) ∪ C = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n(A Δ B) ∪ C = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}"
