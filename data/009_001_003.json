    "message_2": "Let P(t) be the population of rabbits at time t (in years). We are given that P(0) = 100 and P(3) = 200. Since the rate of population growth is proportional to the population itself, we can write the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality. To solve this differential equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = k dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\nln(P) = kt + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. To find C, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 100:\n\nln(100) = k(0) + C\nC = ln(100)\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln(P) = kt + ln(100)\n\nTo find k, we can use the condition P(3) = 200:\n\nln(200) = k(3) + ln(100)\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\nk = (ln(200) - ln(100))/3 = ln(2)/3\n\nNow we have the equation:\n\nln(P) = (ln(2)/3)t + ln(100)\n\nTo find the population after 6 years, we can plug in t = 6:\n\nln(P) = (ln(2)/3)(6) + ln(100)\nln(P) = 2ln(2) + ln(100)\n\nTaking the exponent of both sides, we get:\n\nP = e^(2ln(2) + ln(100))\nP = e^(ln(4) + ln(100))\nP = e^(ln(400))\n\nSince e^(ln(x)) = x, we have:\n\nP = 400\n\nSo the population after 6 years is 400 rabbits."
