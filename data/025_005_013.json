    "message_2": "(a) To find the critical points of $f(x,y)$, we need to find the points where both partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ are zero. Let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 6x + 2y$\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 - 6y + 2x$\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$3x^2 - 6x + 2y = 0$\n$3y^2 - 6y + 2x = 0$\n\nWe can rewrite the first equation as:\n\n$x^2 - 2x + \\frac{2}{3}y = 0$\n\nNow, let's solve for $x$:\n\n$x^2 - 2x = -\\frac{2}{3}y$\n$x(x - 2) = -\\frac{2}{3}y$\n\nNow, let's substitute $2x$ from the second equation into the first equation:\n\n$3y^2 - 6y + 3y^2 - 6y = 0$\n$6y^2 - 12y = 0$\n$y(6y - 12) = 0$\n\nSo, we have two possible values for $y$: $y = 0$ and $y = 2$. \n\nFor $y = 0$, we have:\n\n$x(x - 2) = 0$\n\nSo, we have two critical points: $(0, 0)$ and $(2, 0)$.\n\nFor $y = 2$, we have:\n\n$x(x - 2) = -\\frac{4}{3}$\n\nThis equation has no real solutions for $x$. Therefore, we have only two critical points: $(0, 0)$ and $(2, 0)$.\n\n(b) To determine whether each critical point is a singular point or a regular point, we need to compute the second partial derivatives and the determinant of the Hessian matrix.\n\nThe second partial derivatives are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x - 6$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 6y - 6$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 2$\n\nThe Hessian matrix is:\n\n$H = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6x - 6 & 2 \\\\\n2 & 6y - 6\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe determinant of the Hessian matrix is:\n\n$D = (6x - 6)(6y - 6) - 4 = 36xy - 36x - 36y + 36$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the determinant at each critical point:\n\n$D(0, 0) = 36$\n$D(2, 0) = -36$\n\nSince $D(0, 0) > 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}(0, 0) > 0$, the point $(0, 0)$ is a regular point and a local minimum.\n\nSince $D(2, 0) < 0$, the point $(2, 0)$ is a singular point (saddle point)."
