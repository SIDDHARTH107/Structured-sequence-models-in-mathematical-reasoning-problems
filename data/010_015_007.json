Consider the linear map $D: \\mathcal{P}_4 \\to \\Omega^1(S^2)$ defined by $D(f) = df$, where $df$ is the exterior derivative of $f$ and $\\Omega^1(S^2)$ is the space of 1-forms on $S^2$.

    "message_2": "First, let's determine the dimension of the domain and codomain spaces. The space $\\mathcal{P}_4$ consists of all polynomials of degree at most 4. A general polynomial of degree 4 can be written as:\n\n$$f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + a_4x^4$$\n\nSo, the dimension of $\\mathcal{P}_4$ is 5, as there are 5 coefficients $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$.\n\nNow, let's consider the space of 1-forms on $S^2$. Since $S^2$ is a 2-dimensional manifold, the space of 1-forms on $S^2$ is generated by the differentials of the coordinate functions, i.e., $dx$ and $dy$. Therefore, the dimension of $\\Omega^1(S^2)$ is 2.\n\nNow, let's compute the kernel of the linear map $D$. The kernel of $D$ consists of all polynomials $f \\in \\mathcal{P}_4$ such that $D(f) = df = 0$. Since $f$ is a polynomial of degree at most 4, its exterior derivative $df$ is a 1-form of degree at most 3. The only way for $df$ to be zero is if the polynomial $f$ is a constant function. Thus, the kernel of $D$ consists of constant polynomials, and its dimension is 1.\n\nFinally, let's compute the image of $D$. By the rank-nullity theorem, we have:\n\n$$\\dim(\\ker(D)) + \\dim(\\operatorname{im}(D)) = \\dim(\\mathcal{P}_4)$$\n\nSince we know that $\\dim(\\ker(D)) = 1$ and $\\dim(\\mathcal{P}_4) = 5$, we can compute the dimension of the image of $D$:\n\n$$\\dim(\\operatorname{im}(D)) = \\dim(\\mathcal{P}_4) - \\dim(\\ker(D)) = 5 - 1 = 4$$\n\nHowever, we also know that the dimension of $\\Omega^1(S^2)$ is 2, which is less than 4. Therefore, the dimension of the image of $D$ cannot be greater than the dimension of the codomain, so we must have:\n\n$$\\dim(\\operatorname{im}(D)) = \\dim(\\Omega^1(S^2)) = 2$$\n\nIn conclusion, the dimension of $\\ker(D)$ is 1, and the dimension of $\\operatorname{im}(D)$ is 2."
