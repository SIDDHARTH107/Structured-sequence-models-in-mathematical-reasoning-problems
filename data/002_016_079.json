    "message_2": "To find the length of a side in an equilateral triangle when given the height, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. \n\nLet's denote the length of a side as \"a\" and the height as \"h\". Since the height bisects the equilateral triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles, we can focus on one of these right triangles. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides is 1:√3:2. \n\nThe height (h) corresponds to the side opposite the 60-degree angle, and half of the side length (a/2) corresponds to the side opposite the 30-degree angle. Therefore, we can set up the following equation using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n(a/2)^2 + h^2 = (a^2)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given height (h = 10 cm) and solve for the side length (a):\n\n(a/2)^2 + (10)^2 = (a^2)\n(a/2)^2 + 100 = a^2\n\nLet x = a/2, so the equation becomes:\n\nx^2 + 100 = (2x)^2\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx^2 + 100 = 4x^2\n100 = 3x^2\nx^2 = 100/3\nx = √(100/3)\n\nNow, find the side length (a):\n\na = 2x = 2√(100/3) ≈ 11.55 cm\n\nSo, the length of a side in the equilateral triangle is approximately 11.55 cm."
