    "message_2": "To find the intersection points between the curves defined by the equations $x^2 + y^2 = 4$ and $xy = 1$ in the complex plane, we will first solve for one variable in terms of the other in one of the equations, and then substitute that expression into the other equation.\n\nLet's solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ in the second equation:\n\n$xy = 1 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{1}{x}$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $y$ into the first equation:\n\n$x^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2 = 4$\n\nSimplify and solve for $x$:\n\n$x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} = 4$\n\nTo solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by $x^2$ to get rid of the fraction:\n\n$x^4 + 1 = 4x^2$\n\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation in $x^2$:\n\n$x^4 - 4x^2 + 1 = 0$\n\nLet $z = x^2$. Then the equation becomes:\n\n$z^2 - 4z + 1 = 0$\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $z$:\n\n$z = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2}$\n\nSo, we have two possible values for $z$:\n\n$z_1 = \\frac{4 + \\sqrt{12}}{2}$ and $z_2 = \\frac{4 - \\sqrt{12}}{2}$\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding $x$ values. Since $z = x^2$, we have:\n\n$x_1 = \\pm\\sqrt{z_1} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{4 + \\sqrt{12}}{2}}$\n\n$x_2 = \\pm\\sqrt{z_2} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{4 - \\sqrt{12}}{2}}$\n\nFinally, we can find the corresponding $y$ values using the expression $y = \\frac{1}{x}$:\n\n$y_1 = \\frac{1}{x_1} = \\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{4 + \\sqrt{12}}{2}}}$\n\n$y_2 = \\frac{1}{x_2} = \\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{4 - \\sqrt{12}}{2}}}$\n\nThus, the intersection points between the curves in the complex plane are:\n\n$(x_1, y_1) = \\left(\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{4 + \\sqrt{12}}{2}}, \\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{4 + \\sqrt{12}}{2}}}\\right)$\n\n$(x_2, y_2) = \\left(\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{4 - \\sqrt{12}}{2}}, \\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{4 - \\sqrt{12}}{2}}}\\right)$"
