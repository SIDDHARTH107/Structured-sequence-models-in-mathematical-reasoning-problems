    "message_2": "1. If G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16, then G has φ(16) generators, where φ is the Euler's totient function. φ(16) = 16 * (1 - 1/2) = 8. So, G has 8 generators.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8, then G has 2n elements, where n is the number of sides of the polygon. In this case, n = 8. The dihedral group D8 has n elements of order 2, which are the reflections. So, G has 8 elements of order 2.\n\n3. If G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 16, then G is isomorphic to the Quaternion group Q16 or the semi-dihedral group SD16. Both of these groups have 5 normal subgroups: the trivial group, the whole group, and three other subgroups of orders 2, 4, and 8."
