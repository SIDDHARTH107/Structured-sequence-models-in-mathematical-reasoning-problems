They have a set of 6 items to choose from, each with its own weight and value. The details are:\n\nItem 1: weight 2 kg, value $10\nItem 2: weight 3 kg, value $15\nItem 3: weight 5 kg, value $20\nItem 4: weight 7 kg, value $25\nItem 5: weight 9 kg, value $30\nItem 6: weight 11 kg, value $35\n\nWhat is the maximum value of items the student can carry in their backpack? Assume that only whole items can be taken and individual items cannot be divided.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the value of items the student can carry in their backpack, we can use a greedy algorithm. We will sort the items by their value-to-weight ratio and then select the items with the highest ratio until the backpack is full or no more items can be added.\n\nValue-to-weight ratios:\nItem 1: 10/2 = 5\nItem 2: 15/3 = 5\nItem 3: 20/5 = 4\nItem 4: 25/7 ≈ 3.57\nItem 5: 30/9 ≈ 3.33\nItem 6: 35/11 ≈ 3.18\n\nSorted by value-to-weight ratio:\n1. Item 1 (5)\n2. Item 2 (5)\n3. Item 3 (4)\n4. Item 4 (3.57)\n5. Item 5 (3.33)\n6. Item 6 (3.18)\n\nNow, we will select items in this order until the backpack is full or no more items can be added:\n\n1. Add Item 1: weight = 2 kg, value = $10, remaining capacity = 15 - 2 = 13 kg\n2. Add Item 2: weight = 3 kg, value = $15, remaining capacity = 13 - 3 = 10 kg\n3. Add Item 3: weight = 5 kg, value = $20, remaining capacity = 10 - 5 = 5 kg\n\nAt this point, we cannot add any more items without exceeding the backpack's weight limit. The maximum value of items the student can carry in their backpack is $10 + $15 + $20 = $45."
