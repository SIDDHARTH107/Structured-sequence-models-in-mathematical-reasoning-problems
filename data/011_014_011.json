    "message_1": "Suppose a company has 6 departments and there are 10 employees in total. Each employee can only work in one department. In how many ways can the company assign employees to departments if each department must have at least one employee?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. \n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to assign 10 employees to 6 departments without any restrictions. This can be done using the formula for distributing n identical items into r distinct groups, which is C(n-1, r-1). In this case, n = 10 and r = 6, so the total number of ways is C(9, 5) = 126.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways in which at least one department is empty. We can choose 5 departments from 6 in C(6, 5) = 6 ways. Then, we can distribute the 10 employees among these 5 departments in C(9, 4) = 126 ways. So, there are 6 * 126 = 756 ways in which at least one department is empty.\n\nNext, let's find the number of ways in which at least two departments are empty. We can choose 4 departments from 6 in C(6, 4) = 15 ways. Then, we can distribute the 10 employees among these 4 departments in C(9, 3) = 84 ways. So, there are 15 * 84 = 1260 ways in which at least two departments are empty.\n\nFinally, let's find the number of ways in which at least three departments are empty. This is not possible since we have 10 employees and only 6 departments, so at most 2 departments can be empty.\n\nNow, we can apply the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to find the number of ways to assign employees to departments with each department having at least one employee:\n\nTotal ways = (Total ways without any restrictions) - (Ways with at least one empty department) + (Ways with at least two empty departments)\nTotal ways = 126 - 756 + 1260 = 630\n\nSo, there are 630 ways to assign 10 employees to 6 departments such that each department has at least one employee."
