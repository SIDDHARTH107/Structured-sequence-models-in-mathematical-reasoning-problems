    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface S at the point (1,1,1), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface S by two parameters u and v. We can choose u = x and v = y. Then, the surface can be represented as a vector function:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, (u^2 + v^2)/4)\n\nNow, we need to find the first derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, u/2)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, v/2)\n\nNext, we need to find the second derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_uu = (∂²r/∂u²) = (0, 0, 1/2)\nr_uv = (∂²r/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (∂²r/∂v²) = (0, 0, 1/2)\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + (u^2)/4\nF = r_u • r_v = uv/4\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + (v^2)/4\n\nL = r_uu • N = (1/2)N_z\nM = r_uv • N = 0\nN = r_vv • N = (1/2)N_z\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface S. To find N, we first find the normal vector by taking the cross product of r_u and r_v:\n\nn = r_u × r_v = (-u/2, -v/2, 1)\n\nNow, we normalize n to get the unit normal vector N:\n\nN = n/|n| = (-u/2, -v/2, 1)/sqrt((u^2 + v^2)/4 + 1)\n\nNow, we can find N_z:\n\nN_z = 1/sqrt((u^2 + v^2)/4 + 1)\n\nNow, we can substitute N_z back into L and N:\n\nL = (1/2)N_z = 1/(2sqrt((u^2 + v^2)/4 + 1))\nN = (1/2)N_z = 1/(2sqrt((u^2 + v^2)/4 + 1))\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (1/2)((EN + GL - 2FM)/(EG - F^2))\n\nAt the point (1,1,1), we have u = 1 and v = 1:\n\nE = 1 + (1^2)/4 = 5/4\nF = (1)(1)/4 = 1/4\nG = 1 + (1^2)/4 = 5/4\nL = 1/(2sqrt((1^2 + 1^2)/4 + 1)) = 1/(2sqrt(2))\nN = 1/(2sqrt((1^2 + 1^2)/4 + 1)) = 1/(2sqrt(2))\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula for H:\n\nH = (1/2)(((5/4)(1/(2sqrt(2))) + (5/4)(1/(2sqrt(2))) - 2(1/4)(0))/((5/4)^2 - (1/4)^2))\nH = (1/2)((5/(2sqrt(2)) + 5/(2sqrt(2)))/(25/16 - 1/16))\nH = (1/2)((10/(2sqrt(2)))/(24/16))\nH = (1/2)((10/(2sqrt(2)))/(3/2))\nH = (10/4sqrt(2))/(3/2)\nH = (5/2sqrt(2))/(3/2)\nH = 5/(6sqrt(2))\n\nTherefore, the mean curvature of the surface S at the point (1,1,1) is H = 5/(6sqrt(2))."
