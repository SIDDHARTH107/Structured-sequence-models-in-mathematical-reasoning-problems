    "message_2": "In a community of 500 people, 60% attend social events regularly. That means 0.6 * 500 = 300 people attend social events regularly.\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 250 people will attend the event this weekend. Since 300 people attend social events regularly, the probability of at least 250 people attending is quite high.\n\nHowever, to calculate the exact probability, we would need more information about the distribution of attendance (e.g., is it a binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, etc.) and any factors that might affect attendance this weekend (e.g., weather, competing events, etc.).\n\nWithout that information, we can only say that the probability of at least 250 people attending is high, given that 300 people attend social events regularly in the community."
