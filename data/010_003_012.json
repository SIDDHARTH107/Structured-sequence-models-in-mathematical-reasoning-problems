    "message_1": "Suppose X is a topological space such that every pair of distinct points can be separated by open neighborhoods. If X has 10 points, what is the maximum number of open sets required to satisfy the definition above?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the 10 points in the topological space X as {x1, x2, ..., x10}. Since every pair of distinct points can be separated by open neighborhoods, we need to consider all possible pairs of points. There are C(10, 2) = 45 pairs of points, where C(n, k) denotes the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nFor each pair of points (xi, xj), we need at least two open sets Ui and Uj such that xi ∈ Ui, xj ∉ Ui, and xj ∈ Uj, xi ∉ Uj. However, we can reuse open sets for multiple pairs of points as long as the conditions are satisfied.\n\nLet's consider the maximum number of open sets required. We can start by constructing an open set U1 containing x1 but not x2. Then, we need another open set U2 containing x2 but not x1. Now, we can reuse U1 for the pair (x1, x3) by ensuring x3 ∉ U1, and we need another open set U3 containing x3 but not x1. Similarly, we can reuse U2 for the pair (x2, x3) by ensuring x3 ∉ U2, and we need another open set U4 containing x3 but not x2.\n\nContinuing this process, we can construct open sets for each pair of points (x1, xi) and (x2, xi) for i = 3, 4, ..., 10. This will require a total of 2 + 2*(10 - 2) = 18 open sets. However, we still need to consider the pairs (x3, x4), (x3, x5), ..., (x3, x10). We can reuse the open sets U3 and U4 for these pairs, and we need an additional 10 - 3 = 7 open sets for the remaining pairs. So, the total number of open sets required so far is 18 + 7 = 25.\n\nFor the remaining pairs (xi, xj) with i ≥ 4 and j ≥ 5, we can reuse the open sets Ui and Uj for each pair, so we don't need any additional open sets.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of open sets required to satisfy the definition is 25."
