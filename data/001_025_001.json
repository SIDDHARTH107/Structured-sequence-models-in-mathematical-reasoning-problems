    "message_2": "To solve the complex equation, we first need to get all the terms with z on one side of the equation and the constants on the other side. \n\n(2 + 3i)z - (4 - i) = (1 - 2i)z + (5 - 3i)\n\nNow, move the (1 - 2i)z term to the left side of the equation:\n\n(2 + 3i)z - (1 - 2i)z = (5 - 3i) + (4 - i)\n\nCombine the z terms on the left side:\n\n[(2 + 3i) - (1 - 2i)]z = (5 - 3i) + (4 - i)\n\nSimplify the expression in the brackets:\n\n(2 + 3i - 1 + 2i)z = (5 - 3i) + (4 - i)\n\n(1 + 5i)z = 9 - 4i\n\nNow, to solve for z, divide both sides by (1 + 5i):\n\nz = (9 - 4i) / (1 + 5i)\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary part in the denominator, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (1 - 5i):\n\nz = [(9 - 4i)(1 - 5i)] / [(1 + 5i)(1 - 5i)]\n\nMultiply the numerators and denominators:\n\nz = (9 - 45i - 4i + 20i^2) / (1 - 25i^2)\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can substitute -1 for i^2:\n\nz = (9 - 45i - 4i - 20) / (1 + 25)\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nz = (-11 - 49i) / 26\n\nSo, the complex number z is:\n\nz = -11/26 - 49i/26"
