    "message_1": "A math student is trying to decide between buying two textbooks for their Logic class. The first textbook costs $50 and has a 90% chance of covering all the material needed for their final exam. The second textbook costs $80 and has a 95% chance of covering all the material needed for their final. Which textbook should the student choose if they want to maximize their chances of passing the final?",
    "message_2": "If the student wants to maximize their chances of passing the final, they should choose the second textbook, which costs $80 and has a 95% chance of covering all the material needed for their final exam. This is because it has a higher probability of covering all the necessary material compared to the first textbook, which only has a 90% chance."
