    "message_1": "A cable company wants to run a fiber-optic cable from a control station to a town which is on a straight shoreline, the control station being located 5 km inland from the shore. The town is located 10 km down the shoreline from the point on the shore nearest the control station. The cost of laying cable along the shoreline is $1000 per km, and the cost of laying cable inland is $3000 per km. Given that the company would like to minimize its costs, what route should be chosen for the cable? (Note: the cable can be run in a straight line from any point on the shoreline to any other point on the shoreline.)",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost, we need to find the shortest path for the cable. Let's denote the control station as point A, the nearest point on the shoreline to the control station as point B, and the town as point C. We can consider two possible paths: \n\n1. Running the cable directly from point A to point C.\n2. Running the cable from point A to a point D on the shoreline between B and C, and then from point D to point C.\n\nFor the first path, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between A and C:\n\nAC = √((10 km)^2 + (5 km)^2) = √(100 + 25) = √125 ≈ 11.18 km\n\nThe cost of laying the cable directly from A to C would be:\n\nCost = 11.18 km * $3000 per km ≈ $33,540\n\nFor the second path, let x be the distance from point B to point D. Then, the distance from point D to point C is (10 - x) km. Using the Pythagorean theorem for the triangle ABD, we get:\n\nAD = √((5 km)^2 + (x km)^2)\n\nThe cost of laying the cable from A to D and then from D to C would be:\n\nCost = (AD * $3000 per km) + ((10 - x) * $1000 per km)\n\nTo minimize the cost, we need to minimize the function:\n\nf(x) = (AD * $3000) + ((10 - x) * $1000)\n\nTaking the derivative of f(x) with respect to x and setting it to 0, we get:\n\nf'(x) = (d(AD)/dx * $3000) - $1000 = 0\n\nd(AD)/dx = $1000 / $3000 = 1/3\n\nUsing similar triangles, we can find the relationship between x and the derivative of AD:\n\nx / 5 = (10 - x) / (d(AD)/dx * 5)\n\nx / 5 = (10 - x) / (1/3 * 5)\n\nx = 10 - x / (1/3)\n\nx = 7.5 km\n\nSo, the point D should be 7.5 km from point B. The distance AD can be calculated as:\n\nAD = √((5 km)^2 + (7.5 km)^2) ≈ 9.01 km\n\nThe cost of laying the cable from A to D and then from D to C would be:\n\nCost = (9.01 km * $3000 per km) + (2.5 km * $1000 per km) ≈ $29,030\n\nSince the cost of laying the cable from A to D and then from D to C is lower than the cost of laying the cable directly from A to C, the company should choose the second path to minimize its costs. The cable should be run from the control station to a point 7.5 km down the shoreline from the nearest point, and then 2.5 km along the shoreline to the town."
