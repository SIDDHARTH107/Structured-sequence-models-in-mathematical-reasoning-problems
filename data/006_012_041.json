    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a theft occurring in a specific neighborhood within a week, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, thefts) occurring within a fixed interval of time (a week).\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of thefts per week. Since there are 3 thefts per month on average, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the average number of thefts per week is:\n\nλ = 3 thefts/month * (1 month/4 weeks) = 0.75 thefts/week\n\nNow, we can use the Poisson probability formula to find the probability of a theft occurring within a week:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * (λ^k)) / k!\n\nFor k = 1 (one theft occurring within a week):\n\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-0.75) * (0.75^1)) / 1! ≈ 0.284\n\nSo, the probability of a theft occurring in a specific neighborhood within a week, given that the historical data shows that on average there are 3 thefts per month in that neighborhood, is approximately 28.4%."
