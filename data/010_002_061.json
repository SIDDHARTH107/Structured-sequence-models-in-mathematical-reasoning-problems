    "message_2": "In the discrete topology, every subset of X is an open set. To determine if the function f is continuous at each point in X, we need to check if the preimage of every open set in the codomain (R with the standard topology) is open in the domain (X with the discrete topology).\n\nSince every subset of X is open in the discrete topology, the preimage of any open set in R will also be open in X. Therefore, the function f is continuous at every point in X."
