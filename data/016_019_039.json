    "message_2": "The Koch island fractal is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The Koch curve is generated by dividing a straight line into three equal segments and replacing the middle segment with an equilateral triangle without its base (which is the middle segment). After each iteration, the process is repeated for each new line segment.\n\nLet's denote the length of the original equilateral triangle's side as L (in this case, L = 1 unit). After the first iteration, each side of the triangle is replaced by a Koch curve with 4 segments, each of length L/3. So, the total length of the curve after the first iteration is 4 * (L/3) = (4/3)L.\n\nAfter each iteration, the number of segments in the curve increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is divided by 3. Therefore, after n iterations, the length of the curve is (4/3)^n * L.\n\nSince the Koch island fractal is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of the equilateral triangle, the perimeter of the Koch island fractal after n iterations is 3 times the length of the curve, which is 3 * (4/3)^n * L.\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter of the Koch island fractal after 5 iterations:\n\nPerimeter = 3 * (4/3)^5 * L\nPerimeter = 3 * (1024/243) * 1\nPerimeter ≈ 3 * 4.214\nPerimeter ≈ 12.642 units"
