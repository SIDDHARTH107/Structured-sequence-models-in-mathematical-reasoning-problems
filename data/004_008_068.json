    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at a given point, we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x, and then evaluate it at the given x-value.\n\nThe function is y = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 1.\n\nFirst, find the derivative dy/dx:\ndy/dx = d(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 1)/dx\ndy/dx = 6x^2 - 10x + 3\n\nNow, evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\ndy/dx(2) = 6(2)^2 - 10(2) + 3\ndy/dx(2) = 6(4) - 20 + 3\ndy/dx(2) = 24 - 20 + 3\ndy/dx(2) = 7\n\nThe slope of the tangent line to the curve at x = 2 is 7."
