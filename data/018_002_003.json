    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of set A and set B is a subset of set A and a subset of set B, we first need to find the intersection of set A and set B.\n\nIntersection of set A and set B, denoted as A ∩ B, is the set of all elements that are common to both set A and set B.\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nNow, let's find the common elements in set A and set B:\n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nB = {4, 8, 12}\n\nThe common elements are 4 and 8. Therefore, the intersection of set A and set B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 8}\n\nNow, we need to prove that A ∩ B is a subset of set A and a subset of set B.\n\nA subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. In other words, if every element in set X is also an element of set Y, then set X is a subset of set Y, denoted as X ⊆ Y.\n\n1. Proving A ∩ B is a subset of set A:\n\nWe need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also an element of set A.\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 8}\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nBoth 4 and 8 are elements of set A. Therefore, A ∩ B ⊆ A.\n\n2. Proving A ∩ B is a subset of set B:\n\nWe need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also an element of set B.\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 8}\nB = {4, 8, 12}\n\nBoth 4 and 8 are elements of set B. Therefore, A ∩ B ⊆ B.\n\nIn conclusion, we have proven that the intersection of set A and set B (A ∩ B) is a subset of set A and a subset of set B."
