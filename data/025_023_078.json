    "message_2": "To compute the topological Euler characteristic of the intersection using intersection cohomology, we first need to find the intersection of the two quadric surfaces.\n\nLet's add the two equations:\n\nx^2 + y^2 - z^2 + x^2 - y^2 + z^2 = 1 + 1\n2x^2 = 2\nx^2 = 1\nx = ±1\n\nNow, let's substitute x = 1 into the two equations:\n\n1 + y^2 - z^2 = 1\n1 - y^2 + z^2 = 1\n\nThe first equation simplifies to:\n\ny^2 - z^2 = 0\n(y - z)(y + z) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possibilities:\n\ny - z = 0 => y = z\ny + z = 0 => y = -z\n\nNow, let's substitute x = -1 into the two equations:\n\n1 + y^2 - z^2 = 1\n1 - y^2 + z^2 = 1\n\nThese equations simplify to the same equations as before:\n\ny^2 - z^2 = 0\n(y - z)(y + z) = 0\n\nThis again gives us two possibilities:\n\ny - z = 0 => y = z\ny + z = 0 => y = -z\n\nNow, we have four intersection points:\n\n(1, 1, 1), (1, -1, -1), (-1, 1, -1), and (-1, -1, 1)\n\nThe intersection cohomology of the intersection is given by the alternating sum of the dimensions of the cohomology groups. Since the intersection consists of four isolated points, the cohomology groups are concentrated in degree 0, and their dimensions are given by the number of points.\n\nThus, the topological Euler characteristic of the intersection is:\n\nχ = dim H^0 - dim H^1 + dim H^2 - ...\n\nSince the intersection consists of four isolated points, the Euler characteristic is:\n\nχ = 4 - 0 + 0 - ... = 4"
