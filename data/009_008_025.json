    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, t) = X(x)T(t). Then, the wave equation becomes:\n\nX''(x)T(t) - (1/v^2)X(x)T''(t) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = (1/v^2)T''(t)/T(t)\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on t, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -k^2:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -k^2\n(1/v^2)T''(t)/T(t) = -k^2\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0\nT''(t) + (v^2)k^2T(t) = 0\n\nSolve the first equation for X(x):\n\nX(x) = A*sin(kx) + B*cos(kx)\n\nApply the boundary conditions u(0, t) = 0 and u(L, t) = 0:\n\nX(0) = A*sin(0) + B*cos(0) = B = 0\nX(L) = A*sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince L = 1, we have:\n\nA*sin(k) = 0\n\nNon-trivial solutions exist when k = n*pi, where n is an integer. So, X_n(x) = A_n*sin(n*pi*x).\n\nNow, solve the second equation for T(t):\n\nT(t) = C*cos(v*k*t) + D*sin(v*k*t)\n\nApply the initial condition u_t(x, 0) = 0:\n\nT'(t) = -v*k*C*sin(v*k*t) + v*k*D*cos(v*k*t)\nT'(0) = D*v*k = 0\n\nSince k ≠ 0, we have D = 0. So, T_n(t) = C_n*cos(n*pi*v*t).\n\nThe general solution is:\n\nu(x, t) = sum(C_n*sin(n*pi*x)*cos(n*pi*v*t))\n\nApply the initial condition u(x, 0) = sin(pi*x):\n\nu(x, 0) = sum(C_n*sin(n*pi*x)) = sin(pi*x)\n\nComparing the terms, we see that C_1 = 1 and C_n = 0 for n ≠ 1. Therefore, the solution to the given wave equation with the given initial and boundary conditions is:\n\nu(x, t) = sin(pi*x)*cos(pi*v*t)"
