    "message_2": "To guarantee that there are at least 3 students who are members of the same club, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are n pigeonholes (clubs) and m+1 pigeons (students), where m is the maximum number of pigeons that can be placed in a pigeonhole without exceeding the desired condition, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than m pigeons.\n\nIn this case, we have 7 clubs (pigeonholes) and we want to guarantee at least 3 students (pigeons) in the same club. So, m = 2, because if there are 2 students in each club, we still haven't exceeded the desired condition.\n\nUsing the Pigeonhole Principle, we need (7 * 2) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15 students to guarantee that there are at least 3 students who are members of the same club."
