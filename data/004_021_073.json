    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of f(x) with respect to x, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x).\n\nThe first derivative, f'(x), is found by differentiating f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (4x^3 - x^2 + 5x - 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 2x + 5\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative, f''(x), by differentiating f'(x) with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (12x^2 - 2x + 5)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\nf''(x) = 24x - 2\n\nSo, the second derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf''(x) = 24x - 2"
