    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360°) × π × r²\n\nwhere the central angle is 60° and the radius (r) is 8 cm.\n\nArea of sector = (60° / 360°) × π × 8²\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 64\n\nArea of sector = 64π/6\n\nArea of sector = 32π/3\n\nThe area of the sector is (32π/3) square centimeters."
