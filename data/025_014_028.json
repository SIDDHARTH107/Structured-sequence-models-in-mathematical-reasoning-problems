Let P = (1,1) and Q = (2,3) be two points on this curve. \n\nDetermine the value of the Riemann constant associated to the divisor (P-Q). \n\nHint: Use the Riemann-Roch Theorem and the definition of Theta functions to compute the value of the Riemann constant associated to the divisor (P-Q).",
    "message_2": "To compute the Riemann constant associated to the divisor (P-Q), we will first use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem for a compact Riemann surface X of genus g states that for any divisor D on X, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K-D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles only at the points of D, K is the canonical divisor, and deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D.\n\nIn our case, the Riemann surface is an elliptic curve (genus g = 1), and the divisor D = P - Q. The canonical divisor K on an elliptic curve is the zero divisor, so K - D = Q - P. Since the degree of P - Q is 0, the Riemann-Roch theorem simplifies to:\n\nl(P-Q) - l(Q-P) = 1.\n\nNow, we need to compute the Riemann constant associated with the divisor (P-Q). The Riemann constant is defined as the half-period of the Theta function associated with the divisor (P-Q). The Theta function is given by:\n\nΘ(z; τ) = ∑_{n ∈ Z} exp(πi(n^2τ + 2nz)),\n\nwhere z is a complex variable and τ is the period matrix of the Riemann surface.\n\nTo compute the Riemann constant, we need to find the value of z for which the Theta function vanishes, i.e., Θ(z; τ) = 0. Since l(P-Q) - l(Q-P) = 1, there exists a unique meromorphic function f with a pole at P and a zero at Q. This function can be expressed in terms of the Theta function as:\n\nf(z) = Θ(z - z_P + z_Q; τ) / Θ(z - z_P; τ),\n\nwhere z_P and z_Q are the complex coordinates of the points P and Q, respectively.\n\nThe Riemann constant is the value of z for which f(z) has a pole, i.e., Θ(z - z_P; τ) = 0. Since Θ(z; τ) is an even function, this occurs when z = z_P + z_Q. Therefore, the Riemann constant associated with the divisor (P-Q) is given by:\n\nRiemann constant = z_P + z_Q."
