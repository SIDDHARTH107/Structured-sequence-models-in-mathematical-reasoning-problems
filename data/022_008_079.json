    "message_2": "Since f(z) is a polynomial of degree 4, it has exactly 4 roots in the complex plane, counting multiplicities. To find the number of roots with a real part greater than 1, we can use the fact that complex roots of a polynomial with real coefficients come in conjugate pairs. \n\nLet's first find the roots of f(z) using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the divisors of the constant term (2) divided by the divisors of the leading coefficient (4). The possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±1/2, and ±1/4. \n\nTesting these values, we find that f(1/2) = 0, so z = 1/2 is a root. Since the coefficients are real, the conjugate z = 1/2 is also a root. Now, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\nf(z) = (4z^4 - 7z^3 + 3z^2 - 5z + 2) / ((z - 1/2)(z - 1/2))\n     = 4(z^2 - z + 1)\n\nNow we have a quadratic factor, 4(z^2 - z + 1), which has two complex roots. To find these roots, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (1 ± √(1^2 - 4(1)(1)))/2 = (1 ± √(-3))/2\n\nThe two complex roots are (1 + √(-3))/2 and (1 - √(-3))/2. Both of these roots have a real part equal to 1/2, which is not greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, there are no roots of f(z) in the complex plane, excluding multiplicities, whose real part is greater than 1."
