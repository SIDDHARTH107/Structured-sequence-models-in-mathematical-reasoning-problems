    "message_2": "To find the volume of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 6 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(6)³\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(216)\n\nVolume = (4/3) * 3.14159265359 * 216\n\nVolume = 4 * 3.14159265359 * 72\n\nVolume ≈ 904.778684234 cm³\n\nThe volume of the sphere is approximately 904.78 cubic centimeters."
