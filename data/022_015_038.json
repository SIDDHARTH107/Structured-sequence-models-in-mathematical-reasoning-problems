    "message_2": "We will use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to solve this problem. Let $f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$, where $u(x, y)$ and $v(x, y)$ are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of $f(z)$, respectively. Then, the Cauchy-Riemann equations are given by:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} &= \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}, \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} &= -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we are given that $\\mathrm{Re}f(z) \\leq \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Re}z}$ and $\\mathrm{Im}f(z) \\leq \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Im}z}$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. In particular, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nu(x, y) &\\leq \\sqrt{x}, \\\\\nv(x, y) &\\leq \\sqrt{y}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $f(z)$ is entire, it is differentiable everywhere in the complex plane. Thus, we can differentiate the inequalities above with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} &\\leq \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}, \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} &\\leq \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{y}}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to obtain:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} &\\leq \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}, \\\\\n-\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} &\\leq \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{y}}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $f(0) = 0$, we have $u(0, 0) = 0$ and $v(0, 0) = 0$. Therefore, the partial derivatives of $u$ and $v$ must also be zero at $(0, 0)$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(0, 0) &= 0, \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}(0, 0) &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we are given that $f(i) = 2$. Since $i = 0 + i$, we have $u(0, 1) = 0$ and $v(0, 1) = 2$. Thus, we can write:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(0, 1) &= 0, \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}(0, 1) &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $f(z)$ is entire, it is also analytic. Therefore, we can use the identity theorem for analytic functions, which states that if two analytic functions have the same derivatives at a point, then they are equal everywhere. Thus, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nu(x, y) &= 0, \\\\\nv(x, y) &= 2y.\n\\end{align*}\n\nFinally, we can find the value of $f(-i)$. Since $-i = 0 - i$, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(-i) &= u(0, -1) + iv(0, -1) \\\\\n&= 0 + i(-2) \\\\\n&= -2i.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the value of $f(-i)$ is $\\boxed{-2i}$."
