    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, four players each contribute money toward a common pot. The amount of money in the pot is then doubled and split evenly among the players, regardless of how much each player contributed. If a player keeps their money and doesn't contribute to the pot, they keep their own money and receive none of the doubled amount. \n\nPlayer 1 contributes $30, Player 2 contributes $20, Player 3 contributes $40, and Player 4 contributes $10. How much money will each player receive after the pot is doubled and split evenly among them?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the total amount of money in the pot after all players have contributed:\n\nPlayer 1: $30\nPlayer 2: $20\nPlayer 3: $40\nPlayer 4: $10\n\nTotal in the pot: $30 + $20 + $40 + $10 = $100\n\nNow, we double the amount in the pot: $100 * 2 = $200\n\nNext, we split the doubled amount evenly among the four players: $200 / 4 = $50\n\nSo, each player will receive $50 after the pot is doubled and split evenly among them."
