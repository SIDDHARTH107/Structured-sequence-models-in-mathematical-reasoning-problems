    "message_2": "To determine if 89,773 is prime or composite using the trial division method, we will test if it is divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root. The square root of 89,773 is approximately 299.62, so we will test prime numbers up to 299.\n\nPrime numbers up to 299: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293\n\nNow, we will check if 89,773 is divisible by any of these prime numbers:\n\n89,773 ÷ 2 = 44,886.5 (not divisible)\n89,773 ÷ 3 = 29,924.333 (not divisible)\n89,773 ÷ 5 = 17,954.6 (not divisible)\n89,773 ÷ 7 ≈ 12,824.714 (not divisible)\n...\n89,773 ÷ 293 ≈ 306.362 (not divisible)\n\nNone of the prime numbers up to 299 divide 89,773 evenly. Therefore, 89,773 is a prime number."
