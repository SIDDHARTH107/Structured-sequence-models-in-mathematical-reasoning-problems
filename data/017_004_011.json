    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 25. Since 25 = 5^2 and 5 is prime, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, satisfies:\n\n1. n_5 divides 25/5 = 5, and\n2. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5).\n\nFrom these conditions, we have that n_5 can only be 1 or 5. \n\nCase 1: n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one 5-Sylow subgroup, say H, in G. By the Sylow theorems, H is a normal subgroup of G. Since the order of H is 5, which is prime, H is cyclic, i.e., H ≅ C_5 (the cyclic group of order 5). \n\nNow, let g be an element of G that is not in H. Since H is normal in G, the set {gh : h ∈ H} is also a subgroup of G. Let K = {gh : h ∈ H}. Note that the order of K is also 5, as there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of H and K. Thus, K is also a cyclic group of order 5, i.e., K ≅ C_5.\n\nSince the orders of H and K are both 5, their intersection is trivial, i.e., H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Moreover, since the order of G is 25, any element of G can be written as a product of elements from H and K. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of H and K, i.e., G ≅ H × K ≅ C_5 × C_5.\n\nCase 2: n_5 = 5\nIn this case, there are five 5-Sylow subgroups in G. Let H be one of these subgroups. Since the order of H is 5, which is prime, H is cyclic, i.e., H ≅ C_5.\n\nNow, consider the action of G on the set of 5-Sylow subgroups by conjugation. This action gives rise to a homomorphism φ: G → S_5, where S_5 is the symmetric group on 5 elements. The kernel of φ, say N, is a normal subgroup of G. Since the action is nontrivial, N is a proper subgroup of G, and thus, the order of N is either 1 or 5. If the order of N is 1, then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_5, which is a contradiction since the order of G is 25 and there is no subgroup of S_5 with order 25. Therefore, the order of N must be 5.\n\nSince the order of N is 5, N is a cyclic group of order 5, i.e., N ≅ C_5. Moreover, N is a normal subgroup of G. Let g be an element of G that is not in N. Then, the set {gn : n ∈ N} is also a subgroup of G. Let K = {gn : n ∈ N}. Note that the order of K is also 5, as there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of N and K. Thus, K is also a cyclic group of order 5, i.e., K ≅ C_5.\n\nSince the orders of N and K are both 5, their intersection is trivial, i.e., N ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Moreover, since the order of G is 25, any element of G can be written as a product of elements from N and K. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of N and K, i.e., G ≅ N × K ≅ C_5 × C_5.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 25 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
