Assume that the cylinder is located at the origin of the coordinate plane and the flow is in the positive x-direction.",
    "message_2": "To find the complex potential for the fluid flow around a circular cylinder, we can use the complex potential function for a uniform flow combined with a doublet. The complex potential function for a uniform flow is given by:\n\nW_uniform(z) = Uz\n\nwhere U is the uniform flow velocity (5 m/s in this case) and z is the complex variable representing the position in the flow field.\n\nThe complex potential function for a doublet is given by:\n\nW_doublet(z) = -K/(2πz)\n\nwhere K is the strength of the doublet, which is related to the circulation around the cylinder. For a non-viscous fluid, the circulation is zero, so the doublet strength K can be calculated as:\n\nK = U * (radius^2)\n\nIn this case, the radius of the cylinder is 1, so:\n\nK = 5 * (1^2) = 5\n\nNow, we can combine the complex potential functions for the uniform flow and the doublet to find the total complex potential function:\n\nW_total(z) = W_uniform(z) + W_doublet(z)\nW_total(z) = 5z - 5/(2πz)\n\nSo, the complex potential for the fluid flow around a circular cylinder of radius 1, with a uniform flow on the x-axis of 5 m/s, when the fluid is non-viscous and has a density of 1.2 kg/m^3, is given by:\n\nW_total(z) = 5z - 5/(2πz)"
