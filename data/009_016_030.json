Find the potential inside the rectangular region using Laplace's equation. Let a = 2 m, b = 3 m, and V0 = 50 V.",
    "message_2": "To find the potential inside the rectangular region, we can use the method of separation of variables to solve Laplace's equation. Laplace's equation in two dimensions is given by:\n\n∇²V(x, y) = ∂²V/∂x² + ∂²V/∂y² = 0\n\nWe assume a solution of the form V(x, y) = X(x)Y(y). Substituting this into Laplace's equation, we get:\n\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by X(x)Y(y):\n\nX''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y) = 0\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. We can set:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -k²\nY''(y)/Y(y) = k²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + k²X(x) = 0\nY''(y) - k²Y(y) = 0\n\nThe general solutions for these equations are:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(kx) + B*sin(kx)\nY(y) = C*cosh(ky) + D*sinh(ky)\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\nV(0, y) = Y(y)X(0) = 0 => X(0) = A = 0\nV(a, y) = Y(y)X(a) = 0 => X(a) = B*sin(ka) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise the potential would be zero everywhere), we must have sin(ka) = 0. This implies that ka = nπ, where n is an integer. Thus, k = nπ/a.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nX(x) = B*sin(nπx/a)\n\nNext, we apply the boundary conditions on Y(y):\n\nV(x, 0) = X(x)Y(0) = 0 => Y(0) = C = 0\nV(x, b) = X(x)Y(b) = V0 => Y(b) = D*sinh(nπb/a) = V0/X(x)\n\nNow, we have:\n\nY(y) = V0 * sinh(nπy/a) / sinh(nπb/a)\n\nThe final solution is a sum of all possible values of n:\n\nV(x, y) = Σ [V0 * B_n * sin(nπx/a) * sinh(nπy/a) / sinh(nπb/a)]\n\nTo find the coefficients B_n, we can use the orthogonality property of sine functions and the fact that the potential on the V0 wall is 50 V:\n\n50 = Σ [V0 * B_n * sin(nπx/a) * sinh(nπb/a) / sinh(nπb/a)]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n1 = Σ [B_n * sin(nπx/a)]\n\nNow, we can use the orthogonality property to find B_n:\n\nB_n = 2/a * ∫[sin(nπx/a)] dx from 0 to a\n\nFor n = 1, we have:\n\nB_1 = 2/a * ∫[sin(πx/a)] dx from 0 to a\nB_1 = 2/a * [-a/π * cos(πx/a)] from 0 to a\nB_1 = 2/π\n\nFor n > 1, B_n = 0 because the integral of sin(nπx/a) over the interval [0, a] is zero.\n\nSo, the potential inside the rectangular region is:\n\nV(x, y) = V0 * (2/π) * sin(πx/a) * sinh(πy/a) / sinh(πb/a)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values a = 2 m, b = 3 m, and V0 = 50 V:\n\nV(x, y) = 50 * (2/π) * sin(πx/2) * sinh(πy/2) / sinh(3π/2)"
