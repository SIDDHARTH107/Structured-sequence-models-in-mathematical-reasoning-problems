    "message_2": "First, let's note that the order of G is 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structure of G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (denoted n_5) must divide 2^3 * 3 = 24 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 6. If n_5 = 1, then G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, say P_5. \n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (denoted n_3) must divide 2^3 * 5 = 40 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1, 4, and 10. If n_3 = 1, then G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, say P_3.\n\nIf both P_5 and P_3 are normal in G, then their product P_5P_3 is a normal subgroup of G of order 15. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (denoted n_2) must divide 3 * 5 = 15 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The only possible value for n_2 is 1, meaning G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, say P_2.\n\nNow, G has normal subgroups of orders 2, 3, and 5. Since these orders are pairwise coprime, G must be isomorphic to the direct product of these subgroups, which is the cyclic group C120.\n\nIf either n_5 or n_3 is not equal to 1, then G is not isomorphic to C120. In this case, we can analyze the structure of G using the Sylow theorems and the possible values of n_5 and n_3. One possible structure is A5 × C2 × C2, which is a semi-direct product of A5 and C4. The other possible structures correspond to the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, or one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120. The specific isomorphism depends on the values of n_5 and n_3, which can be determined using the Sylow theorems."
