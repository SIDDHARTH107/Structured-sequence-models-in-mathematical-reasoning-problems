    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces a certain product with a cost of $50 per unit. However, due to the uncertainty in the market, the company's manager wants to find a production plan that maximizes the profit in case the cost of production increases by 10%. The demand for the product is normally distributed with a mean of 5000 units and a standard deviation of 1000 units. What is the optimal production quantity that maximizes profit under such uncertainty, and what is the expected profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production quantity that maximizes profit under the uncertainty of a 10% increase in production cost, we need to consider the new cost per unit and the demand distribution.\n\nNew cost per unit = $50 + 10% of $50 = $50 + $5 = $55 per unit\n\nLet x be the production quantity, and let P(x) be the profit function. The profit function depends on the demand, which is normally distributed with a mean of 5000 units and a standard deviation of 1000 units.\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the production quantity x that maximizes the expected profit E[P(x)].\n\nE[P(x)] = E[Revenue - Cost] = E[(min(x, Demand) * Selling Price) - (x * Production Cost)]\n\nLet's assume the selling price is constant and is not affected by the uncertainty in the market. We can denote the selling price as S.\n\nE[P(x)] = E[(min(x, Demand) * S) - (x * $55)]\n\nTo find the optimal production quantity x, we can use the newsvendor model, which is a common approach for solving problems with uncertain demand and a single stocking decision. The newsvendor model uses the critical fractile method to determine the optimal production quantity.\n\nCritical fractile = (Selling Price - Production Cost) / Selling Price = (S - $55) / S\n\nLet Z be the standard normal random variable corresponding to the critical fractile. Then, we can find the optimal production quantity x* as follows:\n\nx* = Mean + Z * Standard Deviation = 5000 + Z * 1000\n\nTo find Z, we need to know the selling price S. Since it's not provided in the problem, we cannot find the exact value of Z and x*. However, once the selling price is known, we can use the critical fractile method to find the optimal production quantity x* and the expected profit E[P(x*)]."
