    "message_2": "First, we need to find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, we need to find the complements of (A △ B) and A. Since we don't have a universal set defined, we will assume the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B.\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\n(A △ B)' = U - (A △ B) = {2, 3}\nA' = U - A = {4}\n\nNow, we need to find the symmetric difference of (A △ B)' and A':\n\n((A △ B)' △ A') = ({2, 3} △ {4})\n\n((A △ B)' △ A') = ({2, 3, 4} - { })\n\nSo, (A △ B)' △ A' = {2, 3, 4}."
