    "message_2": "To determine the period, amplitude, and maximum and minimum values of the given function, we need to analyze the different components of the function.\n\nFunction: f(x) = 3 cos(2x - π/4) + 4\n\n1. Amplitude:\nThe amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the cosine function. In this case, the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\n2. Period:\nThe period of a cosine function is given by the formula (2π)/|B|, where B is the coefficient of x inside the cosine function. In this case, B = 2. Therefore, the period is (2π)/|2| = π.\n\n3. Maximum and Minimum Values:\nThe maximum and minimum values of a cosine function are determined by adding or subtracting the amplitude from the vertical shift. In this case, the vertical shift is 4 (the constant added to the cosine function).\n\nMaximum value = Amplitude + Vertical Shift = 3 + 4 = 7\nMinimum value = Vertical Shift - Amplitude = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nSo, the amplitude is 3, the period is π, the maximum value is 7, and the minimum value is 1."
