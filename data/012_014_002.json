    "message_2": "To determine if the two graphs are isomorphic, we need to find a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the vertices of the two graphs such that the adjacency of vertices is preserved.\n\nLet's list the degrees of the vertices in both graphs:\n\nGraph 1:\n- Degree of A: 3 (connected to B, C, D)\n- Degree of B: 2 (connected to A, C)\n- Degree of C: 2 (connected to A, B)\n- Degree of D: 1 (connected to A)\n\nGraph 2:\n- Degree of 1: 3 (connected to 2, 3, 4)\n- Degree of 2: 2 (connected to 1, 3)\n- Degree of 3: 2 (connected to 1, 2)\n- Degree of 4: 1 (connected to 1)\n\nNow, let's try to find a bijection between the vertices of the two graphs:\n\n- A (degree 3) can be mapped to 1 (degree 3)\n- B (degree 2) can be mapped to 2 (degree 2)\n- C (degree 2) can be mapped to 3 (degree 2)\n- D (degree 1) can be mapped to 4 (degree 1)\n\nNow, let's check if the adjacency of vertices is preserved:\n\n- A (1) is connected to B (2), C (3), and D (4) in Graph 1\n- 1 is connected to 2, 3, and 4 in Graph 2\n\n- B (2) is connected to A (1) and C (3) in Graph 1\n- 2 is connected to 1 and 3 in Graph 2\n\n- C (3) is connected to A (1) and B (2) in Graph 1\n- 3 is connected to 1 and 2 in Graph 2\n\n- D (4) is connected to A (1) in Graph 1\n- 4 is connected to 1 in Graph 2\n\nThe adjacency of vertices is preserved in the bijection, so the two graphs are isomorphic."
