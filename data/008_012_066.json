    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = |  8  |\n    | -11 |\n\nNow, we find the inverse of matrix A. To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant(A) = (2 * -5) - (3 * 4) = -10 - 12 = -22\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find the inverse of A, denoted as A^(-1).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/Determinant(A)) * adjoint(A)\n\nThe adjoint of A is obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the signs of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nAdjoint(A) = | -5 -3 |\n             | -4  2 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-22) * | -5 -3 |\n                 | -4  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 5/22  3/22 |\n         | 4/22 -2/22 |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y by multiplying A^(-1) with B.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\n| x |   |  5/22  3/22 |   |  8  |\n| y | = |  4/22 -2/22 | * | -11 |\n\nMultiplying the matrices, we get:\n\nx = (5/22 * 8) + (3/22 * -11) = 40/22 - 33/22 = 7/22\ny = (4/22 * 8) + (-2/22 * -11) = 32/22 + 22/22 = 54/22 = 27/11\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 7/22 and y = 27/11."
