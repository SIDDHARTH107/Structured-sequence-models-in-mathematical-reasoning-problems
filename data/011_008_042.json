    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to partition a set of 8 objects into 4 non-empty subsets, so we are looking for the value of S(8, 4).\n\nThe formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate S(8, 4) as follows:\n\n1. Calculate S(7, 3):\n   S(7, 3) = 3 * S(6, 3) + S(6, 2)\n   S(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)\n   S(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\n   S(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2)\n   S(3, 3) = 1 (since n=k)\n   S(3, 2) = 3\n   S(4, 3) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\n   S(5, 3) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\n   S(6, 3) = 3 * 25 + 31 = 106\n   S(7, 3) = 3 * 106 + 90 = 408\n\n2. Calculate S(7, 4):\n   S(7, 4) = 4 * S(6, 4) + S(6, 3)\n   S(6, 4) = 4 * S(5, 4) + S(5, 3)\n   S(5, 4) = 4 * S(4, 4) + S(4, 3)\n   S(4, 4) = 1 (since n=k)\n   S(4, 3) = 6 (from previous calculations)\n   S(5, 4) = 4 * 1 + 6 = 10\n   S(6, 4) = 4 * 10 + 25 = 65\n   S(7, 4) = 4 * 65 + 106 = 366\n\nFinally, we have:\n\nS(8, 4) = 4 * S(7, 4) + S(7, 3)\nS(8, 4) = 4 * 366 + 408\nS(8, 4) = 1464 + 408\nS(8, 4) = 1872\n\nSo, there are 1872 ways to partition a set of 8 objects into 4 non-empty subsets using Stirling numbers of the second kind."
