    "message_1": "A school cafeteria offers three different entrees and three different sides. A Latin square is created by selecting one entree and one side for each student's meal. \n\nHow many different Latin squares can be created for a class of 5 students?",
    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, in which each symbol occurs exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we have 3 entrees and 3 sides, so we are looking for a 3 x 3 Latin square.\n\nThere are two main methods to count the number of Latin squares of order 3:\n\nMethod 1:\n1. Fill the first row with the entrees in any order (3! = 6 ways).\n2. Fill the first column with the sides in any order (3! = 6 ways).\n3. The remaining 4 cells are now determined, as each entree and side must appear once in each row and column.\n\nSo, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible Latin squares of order 3.\n\nMethod 2:\n1. Fill the first row with the entrees in any order (3! = 6 ways).\n2. Fill the second row with the entrees in any order, making sure that no entree is in the same column as the first row (2! = 2 ways).\n3. The third row is now determined, as each entree must appear once in each column.\n\nSo, there are 6 * 2 = 12 possible Latin squares of order 3.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of Latin squares for a class of 5 students. Since a Latin square of order 3 has 9 cells, it is not possible to create a Latin square for a class of 5 students using only 3 entrees and 3 sides."
