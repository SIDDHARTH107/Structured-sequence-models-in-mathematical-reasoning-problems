    "message_1": "A heat conducting rod has a length of 1 meter with one end kept at a constant temperature of 100 ℃ and the other end at 0 ℃. The initial temperature of the rod is 20 ℃. Use the Fourier transform to find the temperature distribution of the rod at time t = 10 minutes, given that the thermal diffusivity is 0.001 m²/min.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution of the rod at time t = 10 minutes, we can use the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes how the temperature distribution changes over time. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α ∇²u\n\nwhere u(x, t) is the temperature distribution, α is the thermal diffusivity, and ∇² is the Laplacian operator. In one dimension, the heat equation becomes:\n\n∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²\n\nWe are given the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0, t) = 100 ℃\nu(1, t) = 0 ℃\n\nand the initial condition:\n\nu(x, 0) = 20 ℃\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of the heat equation is:\n\n∂U/∂t = α k²U\n\nwhere U(k, t) is the Fourier transform of u(x, t) and k is the wave number. This equation can be solved by separation of variables:\n\nU(k, t) = A(k) * e^(-α k²t)\n\nNow we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of U(k, t) to get u(x, t). To do this, we first need to find A(k). We can find A(k) by taking the Fourier transform of the initial condition:\n\nA(k) = ∫[u(x, 0) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nA(k) = ∫[20 * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nNow we can find the inverse Fourier transform of U(k, t):\n\nu(x, t) = (1/2π) ∫[A(k) * e^(ikx - α k²t)] dk\n\nu(x, t) = (1/2π) ∫[20 * e^(ikx - α k²t)] dk\n\nWe can now plug in the given values for t and α:\n\nt = 10 minutes = 10 min\nα = 0.001 m²/min\n\nu(x, 10) = (1/2π) ∫[20 * e^(ikx - 0.001 k² * 10)] dk\n\nTo find the temperature distribution u(x, 10), we need to evaluate this integral. Unfortunately, this integral does not have a closed-form solution, so we would need to use numerical methods to evaluate it. However, this expression gives us the temperature distribution of the rod at any time t, given the initial and boundary conditions."
