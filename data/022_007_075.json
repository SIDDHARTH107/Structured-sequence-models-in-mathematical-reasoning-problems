    "message_2": "To show that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 2, we will use Cauchy's integral formula for the derivatives of f(z). Cauchy's integral formula states that for an entire function f(z) and a simple closed curve C,\n\nf^(n)(a) = n!/(2πi) * ∫(f(z)/(z-a)^(n+1))dz,\n\nwhere f^(n)(a) denotes the nth derivative of f(z) evaluated at a.\n\nLet C be a circle with center 0 and radius R. Then, for any positive integer n, we have\n\n|f^(n)(0)| = |n!/(2πi) * ∫(f(z)/z^(n+1))dz| ≤ n!/(2π) * ∫|f(z)/z^(n+1)| |dz|,\n\nwhere the integral is taken over C.\n\nNow, we know that |f(z)| ≤ 3|z|^2 + 5 for all z. Thus, we have\n\n|f^(n)(0)| ≤ n!/(2π) * ∫((3|z|^2 + 5)/|z^(n+1)|) |dz|.\n\nSince we are integrating over the circle C, we have |z| = R, and so\n\n|f^(n)(0)| ≤ n!/(2π) * ∫((3R^2 + 5)/R^(n+1)) |dz|.\n\nThe integral of |dz| over C is the circumference of the circle, which is 2πR. Therefore,\n\n|f^(n)(0)| ≤ n! * (3R^2 + 5)/R^n.\n\nNow, let's take the limit as R goes to infinity:\n\nlim (R→∞) |f^(n)(0)| ≤ lim (R→∞) n! * (3R^2 + 5)/R^n.\n\nFor n ≥ 3, the limit on the right-hand side is 0, since the denominator grows faster than the numerator. Therefore, for n ≥ 3, we have\n\n|f^(n)(0)| = 0.\n\nThis implies that the third derivative and all higher derivatives of f(z) are identically zero. Thus, f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 2."
