    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem on Feigenbaum constant:\n\nIf a simple chaotic system exhibits period-doubling bifurcations, and the ratio of successive bifurcation intervals tends towards the Feigenbaum constant of 4.669, what would be the value of the 6th bifurcation interval?\n\nAssume that the 1st bifurcation interval is 1.0.",
    "message_2": "To find the value of the 6th bifurcation interval, we can use the Feigenbaum constant and the given information about the 1st bifurcation interval.\n\nThe Feigenbaum constant (δ) is the ratio of successive bifurcation intervals. We are given that δ ≈ 4.669 and the 1st bifurcation interval is 1.0.\n\nLet B_n be the nth bifurcation interval. Then, we have the following relationships:\n\nB_2 = B_1 * δ\nB_3 = B_2 * δ\nB_4 = B_3 * δ\nB_5 = B_4 * δ\nB_6 = B_5 * δ\n\nWe are looking for the value of B_6. We can find it by successively calculating the values of B_2, B_3, B_4, and B_5 using the given values of B_1 and δ:\n\nB_2 = 1.0 * 4.669 ≈ 4.669\nB_3 = 4.669 * 4.669 ≈ 21.807\nB_4 = 21.807 * 4.669 ≈ 101.853\nB_5 = 101.853 * 4.669 ≈ 475.753\nB_6 = 475.753 * 4.669 ≈ 2222.807\n\nTherefore, the value of the 6th bifurcation interval is approximately 2222.807."
