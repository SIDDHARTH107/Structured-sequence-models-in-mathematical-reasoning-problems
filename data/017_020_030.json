However, we are given that every Sylow 5-subgroup is cyclic, which implies that there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup (otherwise, the intersection of two distinct Sylow 5-subgroups would be non-trivial, contradicting the fact that they are cyclic). So n_5 = 1.\n\nLet P be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Since P has order 5, which is prime, P is cyclic and isomorphic to C5.\n\nNow, let's find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2. By the Sylow theorems, n_2 satisfies:\n\n1. n_2 divides 5, and\n2. n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2).\n\nThe only possibility for n_2 is 1. Let Q be the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since Q has order 8, it can be either cyclic (isomorphic to C8) or a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 (isomorphic to C4 x C2 or C2 x C2 x C2).\n\nNow, since n_5 = n_2 = 1, both P and Q are normal subgroups of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are coprime (5 and 8), their intersection is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nBy the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P x Q. Since P is isomorphic to C5, we have three possibilities for G:\n\n1. G ≅ C5 x C8,\n2. G ≅ C5 x (C4 x C2), or\n3. G ≅ C5 x (C2 x C2 x C2).\n\nIn the first case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 40, C40. In the second and third cases, G is not cyclic, as it has more than one element of order 2.\n\nHowever, we are given that every Sylow 5-subgroup of G is cyclic. In the second and third cases, G has a non-cyclic Sylow 5-subgroup, which is a contradiction. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 40, C40."
