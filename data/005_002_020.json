A sample of 36 coffee packages was selected and analyzed, revealing a sample mean of 175 mg and a sample standard deviation of 20 mg. Create a 95% confidence interval for the mean caffeine content in the 12 oz packaged coffee.",
    "message_2": "To create a 95% confidence interval for the mean caffeine content in the 12 oz packaged coffee, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * (Sample Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 175 mg, the sample standard deviation is 20 mg, and the sample size is 36. For a 95% confidence interval, the critical value (z-score) is approximately 1.96.\n\nConfidence Interval = 175 ± (1.96 * (20 / √36))\n\nNow, let's calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * (20 / √36) = 1.96 * (20 / 6) = 1.96 * 3.333 = 6.53 (approximately)\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nLower Limit = 175 - 6.53 = 168.47 mg\nUpper Limit = 175 + 6.53 = 181.53 mg\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the mean caffeine content in the 12 oz packaged coffee is approximately (168.47 mg, 181.53 mg)."
