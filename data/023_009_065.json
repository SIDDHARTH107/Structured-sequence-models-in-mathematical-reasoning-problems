    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using the Fourier transform method, we first need to find the Fourier sine series representation of the given inhomogeneous term, which is x in this case. Since the boundary conditions are homogeneous (y(0) = 0 and y(π) = 0), we will use the Fourier sine series.\n\nThe Fourier sine series for a function f(x) on the interval [0, π] is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑[B_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere B_n = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x) dx] from 0 to π.\n\nFirst, we find the Fourier sine series for f(x) = x:\n\nB_n = (2/π) * ∫[x * sin(n * x) dx] from 0 to π\n\nTo find the integral, we use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\nThen, du = dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫[u * dv] = u * v - ∫[v * du]\n\nB_n = (2/π) * {[-(x/n) * cos(n * x)] from 0 to π + (1/n) * ∫[cos(n * x) dx] from 0 to π}\n\nB_n = (2/π) * {[-(π/n) * cos(n * π)] + (1/n^2) * [sin(n * x)] from 0 to π}\n\nFor n even, cos(n * π) = 1, and for n odd, cos(n * π) = -1. Since sin(n * x) is 0 at x = 0 and x = π, the second term vanishes. So, we have:\n\nB_n = 0 for n even\nB_n = (2/π) * {(-2 * π/n)} for n odd\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier sine series for x:\n\nx = ∑[(4/π) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) * (1/n) * sin(n * x)] for odd n\n\nNow, we substitute this Fourier sine series into the given differential equation:\n\ny''(x) + 4y(x) = ∑[(4/π) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) * (1/n) * sin(n * x)] for odd n\n\nSince the Fourier sine series representation of y(x) must satisfy the given differential equation, we can find the Fourier sine series representation of y(x) by solving the above equation term by term.\n\nFor each term in the series, we have:\n\ny_n''(x) + 4y_n(x) = (4/π) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) * (1/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nThe general solution of the homogeneous equation y_n''(x) + 4y_n(x) = 0 is:\n\ny_n(x) = A_n * cos(2 * x) + B_n * sin(2 * x)\n\nSince y(0) = 0, we have A_n = 0. So, the solution becomes:\n\ny_n(x) = B_n * sin(2 * x)\n\nNow, we substitute this into the inhomogeneous equation:\n\n(4 * B_n * cos(2 * x)) + 4 * (B_n * sin(2 * x)) = (4/π) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) * (1/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nComparing the coefficients of sin(n * x), we get:\n\n4 * B_n = (4/π) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) * (1/n)\n\nB_n = (-1)^((n-1)/2) * (1/(n * π))\n\nNow, we can write the solution y(x) as the sum of the Fourier sine series:\n\ny(x) = ∑[(-1)^((n-1)/2) * (1/(n * π)) * sin(n * x)] for odd n\n\nThis is the solution of the given boundary value problem using the Fourier transform method."
