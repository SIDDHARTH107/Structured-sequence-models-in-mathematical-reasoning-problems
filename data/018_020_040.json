The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nB = {2, 3, 5, 8}\n\nIntersection of A and B, A∩B = {2, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the elements that are in either A or B but not in their intersection:\n\nAΔB = {4, 6} ∪ {3, 5} = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow we need to find the union of (AΔB) and B:\n\n(AΔB)∪B = {3, 4, 5, 6} ∪ {2, 3, 5, 8} = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}\n\nSo, (AΔB)∪B = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}."
