    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of length 8 cm and a height of 5 cm. What is the area of the triangle using trigonometry?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a right triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 8 * 5\n\nArea = 4 * 5\n\nArea = 20 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 20 square centimeters."
