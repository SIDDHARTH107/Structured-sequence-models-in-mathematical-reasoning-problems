    "message_2": "A Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is formed by iteratively replacing each line segment with a smaller \"bump\" that consists of four segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. \n\nAfter the first iteration, the number of segments increases from 1 to 4, and the length of each segment is 1/3. After the second iteration, the number of segments increases from 4 to 16, and the length of each segment is 1/9. After the third iteration, the number of segments increases from 16 to 64, and the length of each segment is 1/27. After the fourth iteration, the number of segments increases from 64 to 256, and the length of each segment is 1/81.\n\nThe perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the fourth iteration can be calculated as follows:\n\nPerimeter = (number of segments) × (length of each segment)\n\nPerimeter = 256 × (1/81)\n\nPerimeter = 256/81 ≈ 3.1605 units"
