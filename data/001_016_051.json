    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression (2^3 * 3^2)/(2^2 * 3^3), we can use the properties of exponents.\n\nFirst, let's deal with the 2's:\n\n(2^3)/(2^2) = 2^(3-2) = 2^1 = 2\n\nNow, let's deal with the 3's:\n\n(3^2)/(3^3) = 3^(2-3) = 3^(-1) = 1/3\n\nNow, multiply the simplified expressions:\n\n(2) * (1/3) = 2/3\n\nSo, the simplified exponential expression is 2/3."
