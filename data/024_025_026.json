    "message_2": "To calculate the third Chern class c₃ of the complex manifold M, we need to know the dimension of the manifold. However, this information is not provided in the problem statement. \n\nIn general, the Chern classes are related to the curvature of a complex manifold and are used to study its topological properties. The first Chern class c₁ is associated with the line bundles over the manifold, while the second Chern class c₂ is related to the curvature of the tangent bundle. The higher Chern classes, such as c₃, are more difficult to interpret geometrically and are not as commonly used in mathematical literature.\n\nWithout knowing the dimension of the manifold M, it is not possible to determine the third Chern class c₃. If more information about the manifold is provided, we may be able to calculate c₃."
