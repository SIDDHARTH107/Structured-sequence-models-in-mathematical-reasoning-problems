    "message_2": "To find the prime factorization of 10403 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a function f(x) and an initial value x0.\n2. Iterate the function to generate a sequence of values.\n3. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difference between two values in the sequence and the number 10403.\n4. If the GCD is not 1 or the number itself, we have found a non-trivial factor.\n\nLet's choose f(x) = x^2 + 1 and x0 = 2.\n\nNow, we will generate a sequence using the function and find the GCD of the differences:\n\n1. x1 = f(x0) = f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5\n2. x2 = f(x1) = f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26\n3. GCD(x2 - x0, 10403) = GCD(26 - 2, 10403) = GCD(24, 10403) = 1 (no factor found)\n\nNext iteration:\n\n1. x3 = f(x2) = f(26) = 26^2 + 1 = 677\n2. x4 = f(x3) = f(677) = 677^2 + 1 = 458330\n3. GCD(x4 - x2, 10403) = GCD(458330 - 26, 10403) = GCD(458304, 10403) = 101 (factor found)\n\nNow we have found a factor, 101. To find the other factor, divide 10403 by 101:\n\n10403 / 101 = 103\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 10403 is 101 * 103."
