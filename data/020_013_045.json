The cost of using each machine per hour is given in the table below. For each product, the factory has to run each machine for a specified number of hours. Use semi-definite programming to minimize the total cost of production while meeting the time requirements for each product on each machine.\n\n| Machine | Cost per hour for each machine |\n|---------|---------------------------------------|\n| P       | $6                                    |\n| Q       | $8                                    |\n| R       | $10                                   |\n\n| Product | P Hours | Q Hours | R Hours |\n| --------| -------| --------| -------|\n| A       | 3      | 2       | 1      |\n| B       | 2      | 2       | 2      |\n| C       | 1      | 3       | 2      |\n| D       | 4      | 1       | 3      |\n\nFind the minimum cost of production while meeting the time requirements for each product on each machine.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use linear programming instead of semi-definite programming, as the problem is a linear optimization problem.\n\nLet x_A, x_B, x_C, and x_D be the number of units of products A, B, C, and D produced, respectively.\n\nThe objective function to minimize is the total cost of production:\n\nCost = 6 * (3x_A + 2x_B + x_C + 4x_D) + 8 * (2x_A + 2x_B + 3x_C + x_D) + 10 * (x_A + 2x_B + 2x_C + 3x_D)\n\nSimplifying the objective function:\n\nCost = 18x_A + 12x_B + 6x_C + 24x_D + 16x_A + 16x_B + 24x_C + 8x_D + 10x_A + 20x_B + 20x_C + 30x_D\n\nCost = 44x_A + 48x_B + 50x_C + 62x_D\n\nSince there are no constraints given for the number of units of each product to be produced, we can set the production of each product to zero to minimize the cost:\n\nx_A = 0, x_B = 0, x_C = 0, x_D = 0\n\nIn this case, the minimum cost of production is $0, as no products are being produced. However, this solution may not be practical for the factory, as they would not be producing any products. Additional constraints, such as minimum production requirements for each product, would be needed to find a more practical solution."
