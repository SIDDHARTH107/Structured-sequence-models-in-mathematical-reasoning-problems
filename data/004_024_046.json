    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point (3,4), we need to find the derivative dy/dx. We can use the chain rule to differentiate the given implicit function.\n\nGiven equation: x^2 + y^2 = 25\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx (x^2) + d/dx (y^2) = d/dx (25)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find dy/dx:\n\n2y(dy/dx) = -2x\n\n(dy/dx) = -2x / 2y\n\n(dy/dx) = -x / y\n\nNow, substitute the point (3,4) into the equation:\n\n(dy/dx) = -3 / 4\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point (3,4) is -3/4."
