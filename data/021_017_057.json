    "message_1": "Consider a function f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 6 in the interval [-5, 5]. Use differential evolution to find the minimum value of the function and the value of x that minimizes it. Use a population size of 20, a scaling factor of 0.7, and a crossover probability of 0.9. Start with random initial solutions in the interval [-5, 5].",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using differential evolution, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of 20 random solutions (x values) in the interval [-5, 5].\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution using the function f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 6.\n3. Perform the mutation, crossover, and selection steps until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a sufficiently low fitness value).\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the differential evolution algorithm for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 + 5*x + 6\n\ndef differential_evolution(pop_size, scaling_factor, crossover_prob, max_iter):\n    # Initialize population\n    population = np.random.uniform(-5, 5, size=pop_size)\n    fitness = np.array([f(x) for x in population])\n\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        for i in range(pop_size):\n            # Mutation\n            a, b, c = np.random.choice(pop_size, 3, replace=False)\n            mutant = population[a] + scaling_factor * (population[b] - population[c])\n\n            # Crossover\n            j_rand = np.random.randint(pop_size)\n            trial = np.copy(population[i])\n            for j in range(pop_size):\n                if np.random.rand() < crossover_prob or j == j_rand:\n                    trial[j] = mutant\n\n            # Selection\n            trial_fitness = f(trial)\n            if trial_fitness < fitness[i]:\n                population[i] = trial\n                fitness[i] = trial_fitness\n\n    # Find the best solution\n    best_index = np.argmin(fitness)\n    best_x = population[best_index]\n    best_fitness = fitness[best_index]\n\n    return best_x, best_fitness\n\n# Run the differential evolution algorithm\nbest_x, best_fitness = differential_evolution(20, 0.7, 0.9, 1000)\nprint(f\"Minimum value of the function: {best_fitness}\")\nprint(f\"Value of x that minimizes the function: {best_x}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum value of the function and the value of x that minimizes it. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm. You can adjust the `max_iter` parameter to control the stopping criterion."
