    "message_2": "The fractal dimension (D) of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski arrowhead curve, there are N = 3 self-similar pieces, and each piece is scaled down by a factor of S = 2.\n\nSo, the fractal dimension is:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.585\n\nRounded to 3 decimal places, the fractal dimension of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve is 1.585."
