    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem related to Complex analysis of heat equations for the math student to solve:\n\nConsider a 2-dimensional metal plate with a temperature distribution at time t = 0 given by:\n\nu(x, y, 0) = 5x^2 + y^2\n\nThe edges of the plate are insulated, so there is no heat flow across the boundary. Assuming that the plate conducts heat uniformly, find the solution u(x, y, t) at time t for the following point:\n\nP(2, 3)\n\nAfter 5 seconds, what is the temperature at point P?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the solution to the heat equation with the given initial condition and boundary conditions. The heat equation in 2 dimensions is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nwhere α is the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nThe initial condition is:\n\nu(x, y, 0) = 5x² + y²\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n\n∂u/∂x = 0 and ∂u/∂y = 0 at the edges of the plate.\n\nSince the problem is asking for the temperature at a specific point and time, we can use the method of separation of variables to find the solution. Let u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation and dividing by αXYT, we get:\n\n(1/T)(dT/dt) = (1/X)(d²X/dx²) + (1/Y)(d²Y/dy²)\n\nNow, we can set each side of the equation equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\n(1/T)(dT/dt) = -λ\n(1/X)(d²X/dx²) + (1/Y)(d²Y/dy²) = -λ\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(√(λ) x) + B*sin(√(λ) x)\nY(y) = C*cos(√(λ) y) + D*sin(√(λ) y)\nT(t) = E*exp(-αλt)\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions. Since the edges of the plate are insulated, we have:\n\n∂u/∂x = 0 and ∂u/∂y = 0 at the edges of the plate.\n\nThis implies that B = 0 and D = 0. So, our solution becomes:\n\nu(x, y, t) = (A*cos(√(λ) x))(C*cos(√(λ) y))(E*exp(-αλt))\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients A, C, and E, and the eigenvalue λ that satisfy the initial condition:\n\nu(x, y, 0) = 5x² + y²\n\nSince the problem does not provide the dimensions of the plate or the thermal diffusivity α, we cannot find the exact solution. However, we can find the temperature at point P(2, 3) after 5 seconds by substituting the point into the initial condition:\n\nu(2, 3, 0) = 5(2²) + (3²) = 5(4) + 9 = 20 + 9 = 29\n\nTherefore, the temperature at point P(2, 3) at time t = 0 is 29. To find the temperature after 5 seconds, we would need more information about the plate's dimensions and material properties."
