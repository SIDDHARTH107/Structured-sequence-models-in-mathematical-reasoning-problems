    "message_2": "To solve the given initial value problem using the separation of variables method, we first separate the variables y and x:\n\ndy/y^2 = dx/x\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables:\n\n∫(1/y^2) dy = ∫(1/x) dx\n\nThe left side is the integral of y^(-2) with respect to y, and the right side is the integral of x^(-1) with respect to x. \n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n-1/y = ln|x| + C\n\nNow, we need to find the constant C using the initial condition y(2) = 1:\n\n-1/1 = ln|2| + C\n\nC = -1 - ln(2)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n-1/y = ln|x| - 1 - ln(2)\n\nTo find y as a function of x, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\ny = -1/(ln|x| - 1 - ln(2))\n\nThis is the solution to the given initial value problem."
