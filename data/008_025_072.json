    "message_2": "To show that this system of linear equations has no solutions, we can demonstrate that the two equations are parallel and never intersect.\n\nFirst, let's manipulate the second equation to see if it is a multiple of the first equation:\n\n4x + 6y = 12\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n2x + 3y = 6\n\nNow, let's compare this new equation with the first equation:\n\n1) 2x + 3y = 7\n2) 2x + 3y = 6\n\nAs we can see, both equations have the same coefficients for x and y (2 and 3), but they have different constant terms (7 and 6). This means that the two lines represented by these equations are parallel and will never intersect. Therefore, this system of linear equations has no solutions."
