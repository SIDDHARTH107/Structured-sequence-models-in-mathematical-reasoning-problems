    "message_2": "To prove that if P → Q and Q → R are both true, then P → R is also true using the natural deduction system, we will use the following rules:\n\n1. Modus Ponens (MP): If we have A → B and A, then we can infer B.\n2. Implication Introduction (→I): If we have A and from A we can infer B, then we can infer A → B.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the proof:\n\n1. Assume P → Q (Premise)\n2. Assume Q → R (Premise)\n3. Assume P (Assumption for →I)\n4. Q (From 1 and 3, using MP)\n5. R (From 2 and 4, using MP)\n6. P → R (From 3 to 5, using →I)\n\nThus, if P → Q and Q → R are both true, then P → R is also true."
