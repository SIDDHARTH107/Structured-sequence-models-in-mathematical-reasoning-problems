    "message_1": "Let  𝑈 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} be the universal set. If sets A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and  A' = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9} are the complement of set A, prove that the union of set A and its complement is the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To prove that the union of set A and its complement A' is the universal set U, we need to show that every element in U is also in the union of A and A'.\n\nThe union of two sets A and B is denoted by A ∪ B and is defined as the set containing all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. In this case, we are looking at the union of set A and its complement A', which is denoted by A ∪ A'.\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nNow, let's combine the elements of both sets without repeating any elements:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nWe can see that the union of set A and its complement A' contains all the elements of the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} = U\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the union of set A and its complement A' is indeed the universal set U."
