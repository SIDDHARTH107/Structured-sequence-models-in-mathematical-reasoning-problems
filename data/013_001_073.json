    "message_1": "Two criminals, A and B, are arrested and held in separate cells. The prosecutor offers each criminal a deal:\n- If only one confesses, the confessor goes free and the other serves 20 years in prison.\n- If both confess, each serves 10 years in prison.\n- If neither confesses, each serves only 5 years in prison.\n\nWhat is the best decision for both A and B?",
    "message_2": "This is a classic example of the Prisoner's Dilemma in game theory. The best decision for both A and B would be to cooperate and not confess, as this would result in the lowest combined prison sentence (5 years each, totaling 10 years). However, due to the lack of communication and trust between the two criminals, they may choose to act in their own self-interest and confess, leading to a suboptimal outcome of both serving 10 years in prison (totaling 20 years)."
