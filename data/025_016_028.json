    "message_1": "Let X be the curve given by the equation y^2 = x^3 - 5x + 6. \nFind a rational function f(x) such that the change of variables (x,y) → (f(x),g(x)) transforms X into the elliptic curve Y given by the Weierstrass equation Y: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b for a, b ∈ ℚ.",
    "message_2": "To transform the given curve X: y^2 = x^3 - 5x + 6 into the Weierstrass form Y: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b, we can apply a change of variables (x, y) → (f(x), g(x)).\n\nLet's first find f(x). We can apply a linear transformation to x, so let f(x) = x - c, where c is a constant to be determined. Then, the equation for the curve X becomes:\n\ny^2 = (x - c)^3 - 5(x - c) + 6\n\nNow, let's find g(x). Since we want to preserve the degree of y^2, we can apply a linear transformation to y as well. Let g(x) = ky, where k is a constant to be determined. Then, the equation for the curve Y becomes:\n\n(ky)^2 = (x - c)^3 - 5(x - c) + 6\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation for Y, we get:\n\nk^2y^2 = x^3 - 3cx^2 + (3c^2 + 5)x - c^3 - 5c + 6\n\nNow, we want to match the coefficients of the powers of x in the equations for X and Y. Comparing the coefficients, we get the following system of equations:\n\n1. k^2 = 1 (coefficient of y^2)\n2. -3c = 0 (coefficient of x^2)\n3. 3c^2 + 5 = -5 (coefficient of x)\n4. -c^3 - 5c + 6 = 6 (constant term)\n\nFrom equation (2), we get c = 0. Plugging this into equations (3) and (4), we get:\n\n3(0)^2 + 5 = -5 => contradiction\n- (0)^3 - 5(0) + 6 = 6 => true\n\nSince we got a contradiction in equation (3), we cannot find a linear transformation f(x) = x - c that transforms the curve X into the Weierstrass form. However, we can try a more general transformation for f(x) and g(x) to find a suitable transformation."
