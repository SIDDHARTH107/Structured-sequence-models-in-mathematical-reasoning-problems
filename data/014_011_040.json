    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, we need to reverse the transposition cipher process. Since every 5th letter is written together, we can divide the encrypted message into groups of 5:\n\n1. CEE_T\n2. SHNRI\n3. YI_TP\n4. MSGEE\n\nNow, we can rearrange the letters by taking the first letter of each group, then the second letter of each group, and so on:\n\n1. C Y M S\n2. E I S G\n3. E T G E\n4. _ P E E\n\nReading the letters from left to right, the decrypted message is \"ENCRYPT THIS MESSAGE\"."
