    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set and A be a subset of U such that A has 40 elements. If the complement of A has 60 elements, prove that the union of A and its complement is equal to U.",
    "message_2": "Let A' be the complement of A. By definition, A' contains all the elements in U that are not in A. \n\nNow, let's consider the union of A and A', denoted as A ∪ A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements that are in either of the sets. Since A contains all its elements and A' contains all the elements not in A, the union of A and A' must contain all the elements in U.\n\nFurthermore, there are no overlapping elements between A and A' because A' is the complement of A. Therefore, the total number of elements in A ∪ A' is the sum of the number of elements in A and the number of elements in A', which is 40 + 60 = 100.\n\nSince A ∪ A' contains all the elements in U and has the same number of elements as U, we can conclude that A ∪ A' = U."
