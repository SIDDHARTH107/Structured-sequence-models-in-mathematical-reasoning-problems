    "message_2": "First, let's define connected and path-connected spaces.\n\nA topological space X is called connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. In other words, X is connected if the only subsets of X that are both open and closed are the empty set and X itself.\n\nA topological space X is called path-connected if for any two points x, y in X, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] -> X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nNow let's analyze the given space X = {1, 2, 3} with the topology T = {{}, {1}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}}.\n\nConnectedness:\nConsider the open sets A = {1, 2} and B = {3} in T. We have A ∪ B = X and A ∩ B = {}. Since A and B are disjoint non-empty open sets whose union is X, the space X is not connected.\n\nPath-connectedness:\nTo show that X is not path-connected, we need to find two points in X for which there is no continuous path between them. Let's consider the points x = 1 and y = 3. Suppose there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] -> X such that f(0) = 1 and f(1) = 3. Since f is continuous and the inverse image of an open set under a continuous function is open, we have f^(-1)({1}) and f^(-1)({3}) are open subsets of [0, 1] in the standard topology.\n\nHowever, the only open sets in [0, 1] containing 0 are intervals of the form (a, b) with a < 0 and b > 0, and the only open sets containing 1 are intervals of the form (c, d) with c < 1 and d > 1. Since f^(-1)({1}) and f^(-1)({3}) are disjoint, their union must be a proper subset of [0, 1]. But this contradicts the fact that the union of all open intervals containing 0 and 1 is [0, 1] itself. Therefore, there is no continuous path between x = 1 and y = 3, and the space X is not path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, the space X = {1, 2, 3} with the topology T = {{}, {1}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}} is neither connected nor path-connected."
