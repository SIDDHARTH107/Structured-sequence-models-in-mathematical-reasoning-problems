    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from the original square. In each iteration, the square is divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the central square is removed. This process is repeated for the remaining 8 squares.\n\nFor a Sierpinski carpet of order 4, this process is repeated 4 times. Let's first find the total number of small squares that are removed after 4 iterations.\n\nIn the first iteration, 1 square is removed.\nIn the second iteration, 8 squares are left, and 1/9 of each is removed, so 8 * 1 = 8 squares are removed.\nIn the third iteration, 8^2 = 64 squares are left, and 1/9 of each is removed, so 64 * 1 = 64 squares are removed.\nIn the fourth iteration, 8^3 = 512 squares are left, and 1/9 of each is removed, so 512 * 1 = 512 squares are removed.\n\nThe total number of removed squares is 1 + 8 + 64 + 512 = 585.\n\nNow let's find the side length of the small squares after 4 iterations. Since the original square is divided into 9 equal smaller squares in each iteration, the side length of the small squares is:\n\n3 cm / (3^4) = 3 cm / 81 = 1/27 cm\n\nNow, let's find the total length of the removed squares' sides. Each removed square has 4 sides, so the total length of the removed squares' sides is:\n\n585 * 4 * (1/27) cm = 2340/27 cm\n\nFinally, let's find the perimeter of the original square and subtract the total length of the removed squares' sides to get the perimeter of the Sierpinski carpet of order 4:\n\nPerimeter of original square = 4 * 3 cm = 12 cm\nPerimeter of Sierpinski carpet of order 4 = 12 cm - 2340/27 cm = (324 - 2340)/27 cm = -2016/27 cm\n\nSince the perimeter cannot be negative, there must be an error in the calculation. The error comes from subtracting the total length of the removed squares' sides from the original square's perimeter. This is not correct because the removed squares do not affect the outer perimeter of the Sierpinski carpet.\n\nThe perimeter of a Sierpinski carpet of order 4 with an original square side length of 3 cm remains the same as the original square, which is 12 cm."
