    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices will contain either a clique of size m (a complete subgraph with m vertices) or an independent set of size n (a set of n vertices with no edges between them).\n\nFor R(3,3), it represents the smallest number of vertices in a graph such that there is either a clique of size 3 (a triangle) or an independent set of size 3.\n\nThe Ramsey number R(3,3) is 6. This means that in any graph with 6 vertices, there must be either a triangle (a complete subgraph with 3 vertices) or an independent set of 3 vertices with no edges between them."
