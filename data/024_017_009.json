    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector v = (1, 0, 0) at the point (r, 0, 0) along the curve C, we first need to compute the tangent vector T(t) of the curve C. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the position vector with respect to the parameter t:\n\nT(t) = (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt)\n\nTaking the derivatives, we get:\n\ndx/dt = -r sin(t)\ndy/dt = r cos(t)\ndz/dt = 2r / pi\n\nSo, T(t) = (-r sin(t), r cos(t), 2r / pi)\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of v along C. The parallel transport of a vector is obtained by keeping the angle between the vector and the tangent vector constant as we move along the curve. Mathematically, this is expressed as the covariant derivative of the vector field being zero:\n\nDv/Dt = 0\n\nwhere Dv/Dt is the covariant derivative of the vector field v along the curve C.\n\nTo compute the covariant derivative, we need to find the Christoffel symbols for the given coordinate system. However, since we are working in Cartesian coordinates, the Christoffel symbols are all zero, which simplifies the computation.\n\nNow, we can compute the covariant derivative:\n\nDv/Dt = (dv_x/dt, dv_y/dt, dv_z/dt)\n\nSince v = (1, 0, 0), we have:\n\ndv_x/dt = 0\ndv_y/dt = 0\ndv_z/dt = 0\n\nSo, Dv/Dt = (0, 0, 0)\n\nSince the covariant derivative is zero, the vector v remains constant along the curve C. Therefore, the parallel transport of the vector v = (1, 0, 0) at the point (r, 0, 0) along the curve C is simply v itself:\n\nParallel transport of v = (1, 0, 0)"
