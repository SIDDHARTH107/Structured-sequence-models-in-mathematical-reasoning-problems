    "message_1": "A ladder is 20 feet long and is leaning against a wall. If the base of the ladder is 12 feet away from the wall, what angle does the ladder make with the ground?",
    "message_2": "We can use the right triangle trigonometry to solve this problem. Let's denote the angle between the ladder and the ground as θ. In this right triangle, the ladder is the hypotenuse (20 feet), the base of the ladder is the adjacent side (12 feet), and the height of the ladder on the wall is the opposite side. We can use the cosine function to find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\ncos(θ) = 12 / 20\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse cosine (also known as arccos) to find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(12 / 20)\n\nθ ≈ 53.13 degrees\n\nSo, the angle the ladder makes with the ground is approximately 53.13 degrees."
