    "message_2": "The surface S defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4 is a sphere with radius r = 2. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the total curvature of a closed surface to its Euler characteristic:\n\nK_total = 2πχ(S),\n\nwhere K_total is the total curvature and χ(S) is the Euler characteristic of the surface S.\n\nFor a sphere, the Euler characteristic is χ(S) = 2. Therefore, using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we can determine the total curvature of the sphere:\n\nK_total = 2πχ(S) = 2π(2) = 4π.\n\nSo, the total curvature of the surface S is 4π."
