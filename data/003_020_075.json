    "message_2": "We can use the right triangle trigonometry to solve this problem. Let's denote the angle of elevation from the ground to the top of the pole as θ. The 10-meter pole is the hypotenuse of the right triangle, and the base of the pole is 6 meters from the wall, which is the adjacent side of the angle θ.\n\nWe can use the cosine function to find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\ncos(θ) = 6 / 10\ncos(θ) = 0.6\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse cosine (also known as arccos) of 0.6 to find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(0.6)\nθ ≈ 53.13 degrees\n\nRounding to the nearest degree, the angle of elevation from the ground to the top of the pole is approximately 53 degrees."
