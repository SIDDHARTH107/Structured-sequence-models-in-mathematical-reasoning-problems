    "message_1": "Suppose you intercept the Hill cipher message \"ZGSP\" over the communication channel. Assume that the message is encrypted using a 2x2 matrix key in Hill cipher. Determine the original message sent by the sender, assuming that the plaintext is composed of only uppercase English letters.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Hill cipher message \"ZGSP\" using a 2x2 matrix key, we first need to know the key matrix. Since the key matrix is not provided, we cannot determine the original message sent by the sender.\n\nHowever, if you provide the 2x2 key matrix, I can help you decrypt the message."
