    "message_2": "The chromatic polynomial of a graph G, denoted as P(G, k), is a polynomial that counts the number of proper k-colorings of G. A proper k-coloring is an assignment of k colors to the vertices of G such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nThe given graph G is a cycle with 5 vertices. Let's denote the vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, and v5, and the edges as e1 = (v1, v2), e2 = (v2, v3), e3 = (v3, v4), e4 = (v4, v5), and e5 = (v5, v1).\n\nTo find the chromatic polynomial of G, we can use the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k),\n\nwhere G - e is the graph obtained by deleting an edge e from G, and G / e is the graph obtained by contracting an edge e in G.\n\nLet's choose edge e1 for the deletion-contraction formula. When we delete e1, we get a path with 5 vertices, which we'll call G1. When we contract e1, we get a cycle with 4 vertices, which we'll call G2.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of a path with n vertices is given by:\n\nP(path_n, k) = k(k - 1)^(n - 1).\n\nSo, for G1 (a path with 5 vertices), we have:\n\nP(G1, k) = k(k - 1)^4.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of a cycle with n vertices is given by:\n\nP(cycle_n, k) = (k - 1)^n + (-1)^n(k - 1).\n\nSo, for G2 (a cycle with 4 vertices), we have:\n\nP(G2, k) = (k - 1)^4 + (-1)^4(k - 1) = (k - 1)^4 + (k - 1).\n\nNow, we can apply the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G1, k) - P(G2, k)\n        = k(k - 1)^4 - [(k - 1)^4 + (k - 1)]\n        = k(k - 1)^4 - (k - 1)^4 - (k - 1).\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of G is:\n\nP(G, k) = (k - 1)[k(k - 1)^3 - (k - 1)^3 - 1]."
