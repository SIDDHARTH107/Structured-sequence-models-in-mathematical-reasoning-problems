    "message_2": "To find the determinant of a 2x2 matrix A = [a b; c d], we use the formula:\n\ndeterminant = (a * d) - (b * c)\n\nIn this case, A = [7 2; 3 5], so a = 7, b = 2, c = 3, and d = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ndeterminant = (7 * 5) - (2 * 3) = 35 - 6 = 29\n\nSo, the determinant of matrix A is 29."
