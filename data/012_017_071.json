    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all vertices such that each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the matching. In this graph, there are two perfect matchings:\n\n1. Edges (a, c) and (b, d)\n2. Edges (a, d) and (b, c)\n\nSo, the number of perfect matchings in this graph is 2."
