    "message_2": "To find the image of the point $0.8i$ under the conformal map, we can use the well-known conformal map from the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ to the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$, which is given by the MÃ¶bius transformation:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z - i}{z + i}$$\n\nApplying this transformation to the point $0.8i$, we get:\n\n$$f(0.8i) = \\frac{0.8i - i}{0.8i + i} = \\frac{-0.2i}{1.8i}$$\n\nNow, we can divide the numerator and denominator by $-0.2i$:\n\n$$f(0.8i) = \\frac{-0.2i}{1.8i} \\cdot \\frac{-1}{0.2} = \\frac{1}{-9}$$\n\nSo, the image of the point $0.8i$ under the conformal map is $\\frac{1}{-9}$."
