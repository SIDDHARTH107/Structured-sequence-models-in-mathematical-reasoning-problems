    "message_2": "In Pascal's triangle, each entry is obtained by adding the two numbers directly above it. The value of an entry in Pascal's triangle can also be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the row number (starting from 0), k is the entry number in that row (starting from 0), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the value of the 8th entry in the 10th row. So, n = 10 and k = 7 (since we start counting from 0).\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7!(10-7)!)\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7!3!)\nC(10, 7) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\nC(10, 7) = (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1)\nC(10, 7) = 720 / 6\nC(10, 7) = 120\n\nSo, the value of the 8th entry in the 10th row of Pascal's triangle is 120."
