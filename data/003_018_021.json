    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = cos(2x), we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is cos(u) and the inner function is u = 2x.\n\nThe derivative of cos(u) with respect to u is -sin(u), and the derivative of 2x with respect to x is 2.\n\nNow, we'll apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = -sin(2x) * 2\n\nf'(x) = -2sin(2x)\n\nNow, we'll find the derivative at x = π/4:\n\nf'(π/4) = -2sin(2(π/4))\n\nf'(π/4) = -2sin(π/2)\n\nSince sin(π/2) = 1, we have:\n\nf'(π/4) = -2(1)\n\nf'(π/4) = -2\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = cos(2x) at x = π/4 is -2."
