    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose 3 items out of 7, we use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 and k = 3.\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!)\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!4!)\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(7, 3) = 210 / 6\n\nC(7, 3) = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 different ways to choose 3 items out of 7."
