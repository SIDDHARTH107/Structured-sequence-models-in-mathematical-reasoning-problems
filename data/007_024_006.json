    "message_2": "To find the discrete logarithm of 4 to the base 3 (mod 7), we are looking for an integer x such that:\n\n3^x ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n\nWe can start by testing different values of x:\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n3^2 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n3^3 ≡ 6 (mod 7)\n3^4 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the discrete logarithm of 4 to the base 3 (mod 7) is x = 4."
