    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(2x) = 1, we first isolate sin(2x):\n\nsin(2x) = 1/2\n\nNow, we find the values of 2x for which the sine function equals 1/2. Since x is in the interval [0, 2π], 2x will be in the interval [0, 4π]. The sine function equals 1/2 at the following angles:\n\n2x = π/6 + 2πn or 2x = 5π/6 + 2πn, where n is an integer.\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\nx = (π/6 + 2πn)/2 or x = (5π/6 + 2πn)/2\n\nWe need to find the values of x in the interval [0, 2π]. We can do this by plugging in different values of n:\n\nFor n = 0:\nx = π/6 or x = 5π/6\n\nFor n = 1:\nx = (π/6 + 2π)/2 = (π/6 + 6π/6)/2 = 7π/6 or x = (5π/6 + 2π)/2 = (5π/6 + 6π/6)/2 = 11π/6\n\nBoth 7π/6 and 11π/6 are in the interval [0, 2π].\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the interval [0, 2π] are:\n\nx = π/6, 5π/6, 7π/6, 11π/6"
