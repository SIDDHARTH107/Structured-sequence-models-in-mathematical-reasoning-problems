    "message_2": "First, we will write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n| -4  2 -1 | 6\n|  3 -1  2 | 3\n| -2  3  5 | 1\n```\n\nStep 1: Add 4/3 times the first row to the second row to eliminate the x term in the second row:\n\n```\n| -4  2 -1 |  6\n|  0  1  5/3 | 11/3\n| -2  3  5 |  1\n```\n\nStep 2: Add 1/2 times the first row to the third row to eliminate the x term in the third row:\n\n```\n| -4  2 -1 |  6\n|  0  1  5/3 | 11/3\n|  0  4  9/2 |  7\n```\n\nStep 3: Divide the third row by 4 to make the y coefficient 1:\n\n```\n| -4  2 -1 |  6\n|  0  1  5/3 | 11/3\n|  0  1  9/8 |  7/4\n```\n\nStep 4: Subtract the second row from the third row to eliminate the y term in the third row:\n\n```\n| -4  2 -1 |  6\n|  0  1  5/3 | 11/3\n|  0  0 -1/24 | -5/12\n```\n\nStep 5: Multiply the third row by -24 to make the z coefficient 1:\n\n```\n| -4  2 -1 |  6\n|  0  1  5/3 | 11/3\n|  0  0  1 |  2\n```\n\nNow we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = 2\n\ny + (5/3)z = 11/3\ny + (5/3)(2) = 11/3\ny = 11/3 - 10/3\ny = 1/3\n\n-4x + 2y - z = 6\n-4x + 2(1/3) - 2 = 6\n-4x + 2/3 = 8\n-4x = 22/3\nx = -11/6\n\nSo the solution is x = -11/6, y = 1/3, and z = 2."
