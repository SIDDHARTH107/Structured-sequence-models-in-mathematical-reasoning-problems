    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line, we first need to find the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b).\n\n1. Find the slope (m):\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\nUsing the given points (-3, 5) and (2, -2), we have:\nm = (-2 - 5) / (2 - (-3))\nm = (-7) / (5)\nm = -7/5\n\n2. Find the y-intercept (b):\nWe can use the point-slope form (y - y1 = m(x - x1)) and one of the given points, for example (-3, 5):\ny - 5 = -7/5(x - (-3))\ny - 5 = -7/5(x + 3)\n\nNow, we can solve for y to get the slope-intercept form:\ny = -7/5(x + 3) + 5\ny = -7/5x - 7/5(3) + 5\ny = -7/5x - 21/5 + 25/5\ny = -7/5x + 4/5\n\nSo, the equation in slope-intercept form is:\ny = -7/5x + 4/5\n\n3. Convert to standard form (Ax + By = C):\nTo convert to standard form, we want to eliminate the fractions and have the x and y terms on the left side of the equation:\n5y = -7x + 4\n7x + 5y = 4\n\nSo, the equation in standard form is:\n7x + 5y = 4\n\n4. Graph the line:\nTo graph the line, we can use the slope-intercept form (y = -7/5x + 4/5). The y-intercept is at (0, 4/5), and the slope is -7/5. Starting from the y-intercept, we can go down 7 units and to the right 5 units to find another point on the line, which is (5, -6). Plot these two points and draw a line through them to represent the equation y = -7/5x + 4/5 or 7x + 5y = 4."
