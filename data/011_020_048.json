    "message_1": "Consider a group of 10 friends who all go out to eat at a restaurant. They order a total of 5 pizzas, with different toppings. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. In how many ways can the slices of the pizzas be distributed among the 10 friends so that each friend gets at least one slice and no two friends get the same combination of toppings?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE). Let's first find the total number of ways to distribute the slices without any restrictions. There are 40 slices in total (5 pizzas * 8 slices each), and we want to distribute them among the 10 friends.\n\nUsing stars and bars method, we can represent this distribution as 40 stars (slices) and 9 bars (dividing the slices among friends). So, the total number of ways to distribute the slices without any restrictions is C(49, 9), where C(n, k) denotes the number of combinations of n things taken k at a time.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the cases where at least one friend doesn't get a slice. For each friend, there are C(39, 9) ways to distribute the slices among the remaining 9 friends. Since there are 10 friends, we have 10 * C(39, 9) such cases. However, we have overcounted the cases where at least two friends don't get a slice.\n\nFor each pair of friends, there are C(29, 9) ways to distribute the slices among the remaining 8 friends. There are C(10, 2) pairs of friends, so we have C(10, 2) * C(29, 9) such cases. Continuing with PIE, we need to add back the cases where at least three friends don't get a slice, and so on.\n\nUsing PIE, the total number of ways to distribute the slices so that each friend gets at least one slice is:\n\nC(49, 9) - 10 * C(39, 9) + C(10, 2) * C(29, 9) - C(10, 3) * C(19, 9) + C(10, 4) * C(9, 9)\n\nCalculating the values, we get:\n\nC(49, 9) = 2,085,845\nC(39, 9) = 91,390\nC(29, 9) = 2,002\nC(19, 9) = 16\nC(9, 9) = 1\n\nPlugging these values into the PIE formula:\n\n2,085,845 - 10 * 91,390 + C(10, 2) * 2,002 - C(10, 3) * 16 + C(10, 4) * 1\n= 2,085,845 - 913,900 + 45 * 2,002 - 120 * 16 + 210 * 1\n= 1,171,945 + 90,090 - 1,920 + 210\n= 1,260,325\n\nSo, there are 1,260,325 ways to distribute the slices of the pizzas among the 10 friends so that each friend gets at least one slice and no two friends get the same combination of toppings."
