    "message_2": "To determine whether G is cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25, we can use the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 125, which is a prime power (5^3), we know that G is a p-group. In this case, p = 5.\n\nNow, let's use the Sylow theorems to find the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G. Let n_5 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_5 divides the order of G, so n_5 divides 125.\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nThe only possibility for n_5 that satisfies both conditions is n_5 = 1. This means that there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup in G, and it must be a normal subgroup of G. Let's call this normal subgroup H.\n\nSince H is a normal subgroup of G and has order 25, we can consider the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is |G|/|H| = 125/25 = 5. Since the order of G/H is 5, which is prime, G/H must be a cyclic group.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that G/H is cyclic to determine the structure of G. Since G/H is cyclic, there exists an element g in G such that the cosets of H in G are {H, gH, g^2H, g^3H, g^4H}. This means that G can be generated by the elements of H and the element g.\n\nSince H is a normal subgroup of G, the product of an element of H and g is also in G. Therefore, G can be generated by the elements of the form hg, where h is in H and g is in G. This means that G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and the cyclic group generated by g.\n\nSince H has order 25 and the cyclic group generated by g has order 5, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
