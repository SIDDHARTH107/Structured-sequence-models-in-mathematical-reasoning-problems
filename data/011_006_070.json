    "message_1": "Suppose you have 7 identical red balls, 5 identical blue balls and 3 identical green balls. What is the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in the generating function that represents the number of ways to choose a subset of these balls such that the subset contains an even number of red balls, an odd number of blue balls and at least one green ball?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use generating functions. Let's first find the generating functions for each color of balls with the given conditions.\n\nFor red balls, we need an even number of them. The generating function for red balls is:\n$R(x) = 1 + x^2 + x^4 + x^6$ (0, 2, 4, or 6 red balls)\n\nFor blue balls, we need an odd number of them. The generating function for blue balls is:\n$B(x) = x + x^3 + x^5$ (1, 3, or 5 blue balls)\n\nFor green balls, we need at least one of them. The generating function for green balls is:\n$G(x) = x + x^2 + x^3$ (1, 2, or 3 green balls)\n\nNow, we need to find the generating function for the combined conditions. We do this by multiplying the generating functions for each color of balls:\n$F(x) = R(x) \\cdot B(x) \\cdot G(x)$\n\n$F(x) = (1 + x^2 + x^4 + x^6)(x + x^3 + x^5)(x + x^2 + x^3)$\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in $F(x)$. We can do this by expanding the product and looking for terms that multiply to $x^{10}$. \n\nAfter expanding and combining terms, we find that the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in $F(x)$ is 8. Therefore, there are 8 ways to choose a subset of these balls with the given conditions."
