    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the quasi-Newton method, we first need to find the gradient (first derivative) of the function f(x) and the Hessian approximation (second derivative) to update the search direction.\n\nThe function f(x) is given by:\nf(x) = x^4 - 5x^3 - 10x^2 + 15x + 25\n\nThe first derivative (gradient) of f(x) is:\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 15x^2 - 20x + 15\n\nThe second derivative (Hessian) of f(x) is:\nf''(x) = 12x^2 - 30x - 20\n\nNow, we will use the quasi-Newton method to find the minimum value of the function. We start with an initial guess x0 = 0.\n\n1. Calculate the gradient at x0:\nf'(0) = 4(0)^3 - 15(0)^2 - 20(0) + 15 = 15\n\n2. Calculate the Hessian at x0:\nf''(0) = 12(0)^2 - 30(0) - 20 = -20\n\n3. Update the search direction using the Hessian approximation:\nΔx = -f'(x0) / f''(x0) = -15 / -20 = 0.75\n\n4. Update the value of x:\nx1 = x0 + Δx = 0 + 0.75 = 0.75\n\nNow, we can repeat the process with the new value of x (x1 = 0.75) until convergence is achieved. After several iterations, the quasi-Newton method converges to the following values:\n\nx_min ≈ 3.246\nf(x_min) ≈ -45.217\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function is approximately -45.217, and it occurs at x ≈ 3.246."
