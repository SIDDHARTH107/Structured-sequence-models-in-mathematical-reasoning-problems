    "message_2": "A rail fence transposition cipher with a key of 3 means that the plaintext message will be written in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows. Let's arrange the message \"MATHEMATICS\" in this pattern:\n\nM   E   A   S\n A H M T I T\n  T   C\n\nNow, read the message along the rows to get the ciphertext:\n\nMEASAHMTITTC\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext message is \"MEASAHMTITTC\"."
