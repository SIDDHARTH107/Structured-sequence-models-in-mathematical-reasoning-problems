    "message_2": "To find the union of the two sets A and B, we combine all the unique elements from both sets. The union of A and B is denoted as A ∪ B.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 4}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, we need to show that the union is a superset of each of the individual sets. A set C is a superset of set D if every element of D is also an element of C.\n\nFor A ∪ B to be a superset of A, every element of A must be in A ∪ B.\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nFor A ∪ B to be a superset of B, every element of B must be in A ∪ B.\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of A and B is also in A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B is a superset of both A and B."
