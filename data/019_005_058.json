    "message_1": "Suppose you and your friend A are given a number between 1 and 20 (inclusive), and your friend B is given the information of the number given to one of you, but not whom. You and your friend A cannot communicate with each other, but friend A is allowed to make one guess of the number given. What strategy would you propose to friend A to ensure that the guess has the highest chance of being correct? What is the probability of this strategy succeeding?",
    "message_2": "Since friend A can only make one guess, the best strategy is for friend A to guess the number that has the highest probability of being chosen. In this case, since the numbers are between 1 and 20 (inclusive), each number has an equal probability of being chosen, which is 1/20.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy for friend A is to choose any number between 1 and 20, as they all have the same probability of being correct. The probability of this strategy succeeding is 1/20, or 5%."
