The payoff matrix is given below:\n\n|   | Strategy X | Strategy Y |\n| - | --------- | --------- |\n| A | 4         | 1         |\n| B | 3         | 2         |\n\nWhat is the Nash equilibrium of this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the best response for each player given the other player's strategy. \n\n1. If player A chooses Strategy X, player B's best response is to choose Strategy X as well (since 3 > 2).\n2. If player A chooses Strategy Y, player B's best response is to choose Strategy X as well (since 3 > 2).\n\nNow, let's look at player A's best responses:\n\n1. If player B chooses Strategy X, player A's best response is to choose Strategy X (since 4 > 1).\n2. If player B chooses Strategy Y, player A's best response is to choose Strategy X as well (since 4 > 1).\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when both players are playing their best response given the other player's strategy. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when both players choose Strategy X. The payoff for this Nash equilibrium is (4, 3) for players A and B, respectively."
