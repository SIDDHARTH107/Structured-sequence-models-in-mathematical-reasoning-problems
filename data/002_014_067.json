    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is the total surface area of the rectangular prism in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length × width.\n\nThere are three pairs of faces on a rectangular prism:\n\n1. Two faces with dimensions 5 cm × 4 cm (length × width)\n2. Two faces with dimensions 5 cm × 3 cm (length × height)\n3. Two faces with dimensions 4 cm × 3 cm (width × height)\n\nNow, we find the area of each pair of faces and add them together:\n\n1. Two faces with dimensions 5 cm × 4 cm: 2 × (5 × 4) = 2 × 20 = 40 square centimeters\n2. Two faces with dimensions 5 cm × 3 cm: 2 × (5 × 3) = 2 × 15 = 30 square centimeters\n3. Two faces with dimensions 4 cm × 3 cm: 2 × (4 × 3) = 2 × 12 = 24 square centimeters\n\nTotal surface area = 40 + 30 + 24 = 94 square centimeters."
