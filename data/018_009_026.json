    "message_2": "First, let's find (A × B) × C and A × (B × C).\n\n(A × B) × C:\nTo find the Cartesian product of A and B, we form ordered pairs with elements from A and B such that the first element of the ordered pair is from A and the second element is from B. So, A × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\nNow, we find the Cartesian product of (A × B) and C. The ordered pairs will have the first element from (A × B) and the second element from C. So, (A × B) × C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}.\n\nA × (B × C):\nTo find the Cartesian product of B and C, we form ordered pairs with elements from B and C such that the first element of the ordered pair is from B and the second element is from C. So, B × C = {(3, 5), (4, 5)}.\n\nNow, we find the Cartesian product of A and (B × C). The ordered pairs will have the first element from A and the second element from (B × C). So, A × (B × C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}.\n\nNow, let's prove that (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) are equal:\n\nWe can rewrite the elements of (A × B) × C as:\n{((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)} = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}.\n\nComparing the elements of (A × B) × C and A × (B × C), we can see that they are the same:\n(A × B) × C = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nSince both sets have the same elements, we can conclude that (A × B) × C = A × (B × C)."
