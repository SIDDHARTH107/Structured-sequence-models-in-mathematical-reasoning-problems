Determine the number of possible partitions for each prime factor's exponent:\n   For 2^4: (4), (3, 1), (2, 2), (2, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1) -> 5 partitions\n   For 3^1: (1) -> 1 partition\n3. Use the formula for the number of abelian groups of a given order: \n   A(n) = product of the number of partitions for each prime factor's exponent\n   A(48) = 5 * 1 = 5 abelian groups\n4. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of a given order:\n   G(n) = (1/n) * sum of (phi(d) * A(n/d)) for all divisors d of n\n   G(48) = (1/48) * (phi(1) * A(48) + phi(2) * A(24) + phi(3) * A(16) + phi(4) * A(12) + phi(6) * A(8) + phi(8) * A(6) + phi(12) * A(4) + phi(16) * A(3) + phi(24) * A(2) + phi(48) * A(1))\n\n5. Calculate the values of A(n/d) for each divisor d of 48:\n   A(1) = 1, A(2) = 2, A(3) = 1, A(4) = 5, A(6) = 2, A(8) = 5, A(12) = 5, A(16) = 7, A(24) = 3, A(48) = 5\n\n6. Calculate the values of phi(d) for each divisor d of 48:\n   phi(1) = 1, phi(2) = 1, phi(3) = 2, phi(4) = 2, phi(6) = 2, phi(8) = 4, phi(12) = 4, phi(16) = 8, phi(24) = 8, phi(48) = 16\n\n7. Substitute the values of A(n/d) and phi(d) into the formula for G(48):\n   G(48) = (1/48) * (1 * 5 + 1 * 3 + 2 * 7 + 2 * 5 + 2 * 5 + 4 * 2 + 4 * 5 + 8 * 1 + 8 * 2 + 16 * 1)\n   G(48) = (1/48) * (5 + 3 + 14 + 10 + 10 + 8 + 20 + 8 + 16 + 16)\n   G(48) = (1/48) * 110\n   G(48) = 2.2916 (approximately)\n\nSince the number of non-isomorphic groups must be an integer, we round up to the nearest integer:\n\nG(48) = 3\n\nTherefore, there are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
