    "message_1": "Consider a torus with a circle drawn around its circumference. If we cut the torus along this circle, how many connected components and how many boundary components does the resulting object have?",
    "message_2": "When you cut a torus along the circle drawn around its circumference, you will get a single connected component, which is a cylinder. This cylinder has two boundary components, one at each end of the cylinder. So, the resulting object has 1 connected component and 2 boundary components."
