    "message_2": "Sparse matrices are used to represent matrices with a significant number of zero elements. However, in this case, there are no zero elements in the given system of linear equations. Therefore, we will solve this system using Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion.\n\nFirst, let's represent the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n|  2  3  4 | 16\n|  5 -6  7 |-10\n|  8  9 -10| 45\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to obtain an upper triangular matrix:\n\n1. Divide the first row by 2:\n\n|  1  1.5  2 |  8\n|  5  -6  7 |-10\n|  8  9 -10| 45\n\n2. Replace the second row with (-5 times the first row) + second row:\n\n|  1  1.5  2 |  8\n|  0 -13.5 -3 |-50\n|  8  9 -10| 45\n\n3. Replace the third row with (-8 times the first row) + third row:\n\n|  1  1.5  2 |  8\n|  0 -13.5 -3 |-50\n|  0 -3 -26| -19\n\n4. Divide the second row by -13.5:\n\n|  1  1.5  2 |  8\n|  0  1  3/13.5 | 50/13.5\n|  0 -3 -26| -19\n\n5. Replace the third row with (3 times the second row) + third row:\n\n|  1  1.5  2 |  8\n|  0  1  3/13.5 | 50/13.5\n|  0  0 -25/1.5| 31/1.5\n\n6. Divide the third row by (-25/1.5):\n\n|  1  1.5  2 |  8\n|  0  1  3/13.5 | 50/13.5\n|  0  0  1 | -31/25\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. z = -31/25\n2. y = (50/13.5) - (3/13.5) * (-31/25) = 50/13.5 + 93/27 = 3\n3. x = 8 - 1.5 * 3 - 2 * (-31/25) = 8 - 4.5 + 62/25 = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 3, and z = -31/25."
