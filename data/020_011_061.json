    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of electronic devices A and B. The production of each device requires time on two machines M1 and M2. \n\nDevice A requires 5 minutes on M1 and 4 minutes on M2, and device B requires 4 minutes on M1 and 6 minutes on M2. \n\nThe cost of producing each device is $200 for device A and $250 for device B. \n\nIf the company has 1200 minutes of time available on M1 and 1500 minutes of time available on M2, what is the optimal combination of devices that should be produced to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of device A produced and y be the number of device B produced.\n\nThe constraints for the time available on machines M1 and M2 can be written as:\n\n5x + 4y ≤ 1200 (time constraint on M1)\n4x + 6y ≤ 1500 (time constraint on M2)\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\n\nP(x, y) = 200x + 250y\n\nTo find the optimal combination of devices, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region. Then, we can find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the profit function at each vertex to determine the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the constraints in terms of y:\n\ny ≤ (1200 - 5x) / 4\ny ≤ (1500 - 4x) / 6\n\nNow, let's find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of the two lines:\n(1200 - 5x) / 4 = (1500 - 4x) / 6\n6(1200 - 5x) = 4(1500 - 4x)\n7200 - 30x = 6000 - 16x\n14x = 1200\nx = 85.71\n\ny = (1500 - 4(85.71)) / 6\ny = 76.19\n\nHowever, x and y must be integers (since we cannot produce a fraction of a device). So, we will consider the two closest integer points to (85.71, 76.19): (85, 76) and (86, 76).\n\n2. Intersection with x-axis (y = 0):\ny = (1200 - 5x) / 4\n0 = (1200 - 5x) / 4\nx = 240\n\n3. Intersection with y-axis (x = 0):\ny = (1500 - 4x) / 6\ny = 250\n\nNow, let's evaluate the profit function at each of the vertices:\n\nP(85, 76) = 200(85) + 250(76) = 17,000 + 19,000 = 36,000\nP(86, 76) = 200(86) + 250(76) = 17,200 + 19,000 = 36,200\nP(240, 0) = 200(240) = 48,000\nP(0, 250) = 250(250) = 62,500\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at the vertex (0, 250), which corresponds to producing 0 units of device A and 250 units of device B. The maximum profit is $62,500."
