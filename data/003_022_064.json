    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n|u| = √(5² + (-2)²) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n|v| = √(3² + 8²) = √(9 + 64) = √73\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ between the vectors u and v. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (|u| |v|)\n\nwhere u · v is the dot product of u and v. To find u · v, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = (5 * 3) + (-2 * 8) = 15 - 16 = -1\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (-1) / (√29 * √73)\n\nNow, we can find the dot product of the vectors u and v using the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ) = (√29 * √73) * (-1) / (√29 * √73) = -1\n\nSo, the dot product of the vectors u and v is -1."
