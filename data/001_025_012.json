    "message_2": "To solve the equation |x + 3| = 5, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: x + 3 is positive or zero.\nIn this case, we can simply remove the absolute value sign and solve for x:\nx + 3 = 5\nx = 5 - 3\nx = 2\n\nCase 2: x + 3 is negative.\nIn this case, we need to negate the expression inside the absolute value sign before solving for x:\n-(x + 3) = 5\n-x - 3 = 5\n-x = 8\nx = -8\n\nSo, the two solutions for x are x = 2 and x = -8."
