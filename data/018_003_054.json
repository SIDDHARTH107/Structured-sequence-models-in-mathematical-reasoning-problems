    "message_2": "To show that A∪B is a superset of B, we need to prove that every element in set B is also an element in the set A∪B.\n\nThe union of sets A and B, A∪B, is defined as the set containing all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. In other words, if x is an element of A∪B, then x is either an element of A or an element of B (or both).\n\nNow, let's consider the elements of set B: {2, 4, 6}. \n\n1. 2 is an element of B. Since 2 is in B, it is also in A∪B (by the definition of union).\n2. 4 is an element of B. Since 4 is in B, it is also in A∪B (by the definition of union).\n3. 6 is an element of B. Since 6 is in B, it is also in A∪B (by the definition of union).\n\nWe have shown that every element in set B is also an element in the set A∪B. Therefore, A∪B is a superset of set B."
