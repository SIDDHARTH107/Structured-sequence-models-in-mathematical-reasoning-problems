    "message_1": "What is the variance explained by the first three factors in a data set with 10 variables when the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix are as follows: 4.5, 2.7, 1.8, 1.2, 0.9, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.1, and 0.1?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the variance explained by the first three factors, we need to find the proportion of the total variance that these factors account for. First, we need to find the total variance, which is the sum of all eigenvalues:\n\nTotal variance = 4.5 + 2.7 + 1.8 + 1.2 + 0.9 + 0.6 + 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 12\n\nNow, we need to find the variance explained by the first three factors:\n\nVariance explained by first three factors = 4.5 + 2.7 + 1.8 = 9\n\nNext, we need to find the proportion of the total variance that these factors account for:\n\nProportion of variance explained = (Variance explained by first three factors) / (Total variance) = 9 / 12 = 0.75\n\nSo, the variance explained by the first three factors is 75%."
