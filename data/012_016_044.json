    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of graph G, we first need to determine the number of connected components and the number of cycles in the graph. The graph G can be represented as follows:\n\n```\nA -- B -- C\n|    |    |\nE    D -- F\n```\n\nThere is only one connected component in the graph. Now, let's find the number of cycles. There are two cycles in the graph: ABCDA and BCDFC.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial T_G(x, y) is defined as:\n\nT_G(x, y) = (x - 1)^k * (y - 1)^(n - k) * T_M(x, y)\n\nwhere k is the number of connected components, n is the number of vertices, and T_M(x, y) is the Tutte polynomial of the graph G with the connected components removed.\n\nIn our case, k = 1 and n = 6. So, we have:\n\nT_G(x, y) = (x - 1)^1 * (y - 1)^(6 - 1) * T_M(x, y)\n\nNow, we need to find the Tutte polynomial T_M(x, y) for the graph G with the connected component removed. Since there is only one connected component, removing it will result in an empty graph. The Tutte polynomial of an empty graph is 1. Therefore, T_M(x, y) = 1.\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of graph G is:\n\nT_G(x, y) = (x - 1) * (y - 1)^5 * 1\nT_G(x, y) = (x - 1)(y - 1)^5"
