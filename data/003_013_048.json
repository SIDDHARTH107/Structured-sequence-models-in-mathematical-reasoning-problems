    "message_2": "To find the minimum distance to walk from the base of the hill to the tower, we need to find the shortest path along the hill's surface. This can be done by using the concept of right triangles and trigonometry.\n\nLet's denote the minimum distance as d, the height of the tower as h, and the angle of inclination of the hill as θ.\n\nWe know that the height of the tower, h = 25 meters, and the angle of inclination, θ = 30 degrees.\n\nWe can use the sine function to relate the height of the tower, the angle of inclination, and the minimum distance:\n\nsin(θ) = h / d\n\nNow, we can plug in the values we know:\n\nsin(30) = 25 / d\n\nSince sin(30) = 1/2, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1/2 = 25 / d\n\nNow, we can solve for d:\n\nd = 25 / (1/2)\n\nd = 25 * 2\n\nd = 50 meters\n\nSo, the minimum distance to walk from the base of the hill to the tower is approximately 50 meters."
