    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem related to paraconsistent logic for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider the paraconsistent logic with as its base the set {0, 1, 2}. Let \"~\" denote negation, \"^\" denote conjunction, and \"v\" denote disjunction. Suppose the truth values of p, q, and r are given as follows:\n\np = 1\nq = 2\nr = 0\n\nDetermine whether the following statement is true or false:\n\n[(p v ~r) ^ (q v r)] --> (q v ~q)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to define the operations for this paraconsistent logic with the base set {0, 1, 2}.\n\nNegation (~):\n~0 = 2\n~1 = 1\n~2 = 0\n\nConjunction (^):\n0 ^ 0 = 0\n0 ^ 1 = 0\n0 ^ 2 = 0\n1 ^ 1 = 1\n1 ^ 2 = 1\n2 ^ 2 = 2\n\nDisjunction (v):\n0 v 0 = 0\n0 v 1 = 1\n0 v 2 = 2\n1 v 1 = 1\n1 v 2 = 2\n2 v 2 = 2\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statement:\n\n[(p v ~r) ^ (q v r)] --> (q v ~q)\n\nWe are given p = 1, q = 2, and r = 0. First, we need to find the values of ~r and ~q:\n\n~r = ~0 = 2\n~q = ~2 = 0\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the statement:\n\n[(1 v 2) ^ (2 v 0)] --> (2 v 0)\n\nNext, we evaluate the disjunctions and conjunction:\n\n[2 ^ 2] --> 2\n\nNow, we evaluate the implication. In paraconsistent logic, an implication is true if the antecedent is less than or equal to the consequent:\n\n2 --> 2\n\nSince 2 is equal to 2, the statement is true."
