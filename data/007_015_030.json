    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two, in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 1000, we can start by finding the smallest n such that 2^n - 1 > 1000.\n\n2^10 = 1024, so 2^10 - 1 = 1023. However, 1023 is not a prime number (it is divisible by 3 and 11). We can continue to test the next values of n:\n\n2^11 - 1 = 2047, which is also not prime (divisible by 23 and 89).\n\n2^13 - 1 = 8191, which is a prime number.\n\nSo, the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 1000 is 8191."
