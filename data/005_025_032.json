    "message_1": "A car manufacturer claims that their cars have an average fuel efficiency of 30 miles per gallon (mpg) with a standard deviation of 3 mpg. A math student takes a sample of 25 cars and finds the average fuel efficiency to be 28 mpg. Find the p-value and determine whether the student's finding provides enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim at a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the student's finding provides enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a hypothesis test. We will use a one-sample t-test since we are comparing the sample mean to a known population mean and the population standard deviation is given.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 30 mpg (the manufacturer's claim is true)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 30 mpg (the manufacturer's claim is false)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the test statistic.\nThe test statistic for a one-sample t-test is given by the formula:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, s is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nt = (28 - 30) / (3 / √25) = -2 / (3 / 5) = -2 / 0.6 = -3.33\n\nStep 3: Find the p-value.\nSince this is a two-tailed test (we are testing for a difference, not just an increase or decrease), we will find the area in both tails of the t-distribution with 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the p-value to be approximately 0.003.\n\nStep 4: Compare the p-value to the significance level.\nThe p-value (0.003) is less than the significance level (0.05), so we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nThe student's finding provides enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim that their cars have an average fuel efficiency of 30 mpg at a significance level of 0.05."
