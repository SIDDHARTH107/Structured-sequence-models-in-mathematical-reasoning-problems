    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 2 out of the 4 bills presented in the parliament will be passed, we can consider the following scenarios: exactly 2 bills are passed, exactly 3 bills are passed, and all 4 bills are passed. We will calculate the probabilities for each of these scenarios and then sum them up.\n\n1. Exactly 2 bills are passed:\nThere are C(4,2) = 6 ways to choose 2 bills out of 4.\nThe probability of 2 bills being passed is 0.6^2 = 0.36.\nThe probability of 2 bills not being passed is (1-0.6)^2 = 0.4^2 = 0.16.\nSo, the probability of exactly 2 bills being passed is 6 * 0.36 * 0.16 = 0.3456.\n\n2. Exactly 3 bills are passed:\nThere are C(4,3) = 4 ways to choose 3 bills out of 4.\nThe probability of 3 bills being passed is 0.6^3 = 0.216.\nThe probability of 1 bill not being passed is (1-0.6) = 0.4.\nSo, the probability of exactly 3 bills being passed is 4 * 0.216 * 0.4 = 0.3456.\n\n3. All 4 bills are passed:\nThere is only 1 way to choose all 4 bills.\nThe probability of all 4 bills being passed is 0.6^4 = 0.1296.\n\nNow, we sum up the probabilities for each of these scenarios:\nP(at least 2 bills passed) = P(exactly 2 bills passed) + P(exactly 3 bills passed) + P(all 4 bills passed)\nP(at least 2 bills passed) = 0.3456 + 0.3456 + 0.1296 = 0.8208.\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 out of the 4 bills presented in the parliament will be passed is 0.8208."
