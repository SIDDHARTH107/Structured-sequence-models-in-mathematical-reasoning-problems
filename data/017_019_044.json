    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2. \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal. If n_2 = 9, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are guaranteed to be normal.\n\nNext, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 = 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The only possible value for n_3 is 1, so there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible structures of the groups of order 36:\n\n1. If both the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup are normal, then the group is a direct product of these subgroups. Since there are two possible structures for the Sylow 2-subgroup (C_4 or C_2 x C_2) and one possible structure for the Sylow 3-subgroup (C_9), there are 2 * 1 = 2 possible groups in this case: C_4 x C_9 and C_2 x C_2 x C_9.\n\n2. If the Sylow 2-subgroup is not normal (n_2 = 9), then the group must have a semi-direct product structure. In this case, we need to consider the action of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the Sylow 3-subgroup. There are two possible actions for the Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4 (C_4 or C_2 x C_2) on the Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9 (C_9). For the action of C_4 on C_9, there is one non-trivial homomorphism, which gives a semi-direct product group that is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_18. For the action of C_2 x C_2 on C_9, there are three non-trivial homomorphisms, but two of them give isomorphic groups. So, in this case, there are two non-isomorphic groups: D_18 and (C_2 x C_2) ⋊ C_9.\n\nIn total, there are 2 + 2 = 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 36:\n\n1. C_4 x C_9\n2. C_2 x C_2 x C_9\n3. D_18 (Dihedral group of order 18)\n4. (C_2 x C_2) ⋊ C_9"
