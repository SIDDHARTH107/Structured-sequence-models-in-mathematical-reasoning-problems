The reaction can be represented by the system of equations:\n\n2x + y + z = 4\nx + 4y + z = 8\nx + 2y + 3z = 10\n\nwhere x, y, and z are the amounts of the compounds and the numbers on the right-hand side represent the amount of each product formed.\n\nSolve the system of equations to determine the amounts of each compound needed to produce the specified amount of products.",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we will subtract the first equation from the second and third equations.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n(x + 4y + z) - (2x + y + z) = 8 - 4\n-1x + 3y = 4\n=> x = 3y - 4 (1)\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the third equation:\n(x + 2y + 3z) - (2x + y + z) = 10 - 4\n-x + y + 2z = 6\n=> x = y + 2z - 6 (2)\n\nNow, we will set equations (1) and (2) equal to each other and solve for y:\n3y - 4 = y + 2z - 6\n=> 2y = 2z - 2\n=> y = z - 1 (3)\n\nNow, we will substitute equation (3) back into equation (2) to solve for x:\nx = (z - 1) + 2z - 6\n=> x = 3z - 7 (4)\n\nNow, we will substitute equations (3) and (4) back into the first equation to solve for z:\n2(3z - 7) + (z - 1) + z = 4\n=> 6z - 14 + z - 1 + z = 4\n=> 8z = 19\n=> z = 19/8\n\nNow, we will substitute the value of z back into equations (3) and (4) to find the values of y and x:\ny = (19/8) - 1\n=> y = 11/8\n\nx = 3(19/8) - 7\n=> x = 57/8 - 56/8\n=> x = 1/8\n\nSo, the amounts of the compounds needed to produce the specified amount of products are:\nx = 1/8\ny = 11/8\nz = 19/8"
