    "message_2": "Cauchy's theorem states that if a function is analytic (i.e., holomorphic) on a simply connected domain, then the integral of the function over any closed curve in that domain is zero. However, the function f(z) = 3z^2 - 5z + 2 is a polynomial, and polynomials are holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, the function f(z) is holomorphic on the unit circle C and its interior.\n\nSince f(z) is holomorphic on and inside the unit circle C, we can apply Cauchy's theorem to conclude that the integral of f(z) over the curve C is zero:\n\nâˆ®(3z^2 - 5z + 2) dz = 0"
