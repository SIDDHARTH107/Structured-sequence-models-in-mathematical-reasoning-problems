    "message_2": "To find the maximum area of the square that can be cut out, we need to consider the three possible cases where the square is cut from each of the three corners of the right-angled triangle.\n\nCase 1: Square is cut from the corner with the right angle.\nIn this case, the side of the square will be equal to the shortest side of the triangle, which is 10 cm. So, the area of the square will be 10 * 10 = 100 square cm.\n\nCase 2: Square is cut from the corner opposite to the side with length 24 cm.\nLet the side of the square be x cm. In this case, the square will be cut along the sides of length 10 cm and 26 cm. So, we have two equations:\nx + a = 10 (where a is the remaining length of the side with length 10 cm)\nx + b = 26 (where b is the remaining length of the side with length 26 cm)\n\nSince the triangle is right-angled, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\na^2 + (x + b)^2 = 24^2\nSubstituting the value of x + b from the second equation, we get:\na^2 + (26 - x)^2 = 24^2\n\nNow, substituting the value of x + a from the first equation, we get:\n(10 - x)^2 + (26 - x)^2 = 24^2\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n2x^2 - 72x + 1000 = 576\n\nFurther simplification gives:\nx^2 - 36x + 212 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get two possible values for x: x = 6 and x = 35. Since the side of the square cannot be greater than the side of the triangle, we discard the value x = 35. Therefore, the side of the square is 6 cm, and the area of the square is 6 * 6 = 36 square cm.\n\nCase 3: Square is cut from the corner opposite to the side with length 10 cm.\nFollowing the same procedure as in Case 2, we get the quadratic equation:\nx^2 - 60x + 600 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get two possible values for x: x = 20 and x = 30. Since the side of the square cannot be greater than the side of the triangle, we discard the value x = 30. Therefore, the side of the square is 20 cm, and the area of the square is 20 * 20 = 400 square cm.\n\nComparing the areas of the squares in all three cases, we find that the maximum area of the square that can be cut out is 400 square cm."
