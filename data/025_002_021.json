    "message_2": "To find the degree of the intersection of X and Y, we need to find the number of intersection points of X and Y, counting multiplicities. We can do this by solving the system of equations formed by the equations of X and Y.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation of Y as:\n\ny(x² + xy + y²) = 0\n\nThis implies that either y = 0 or x² + xy + y² = 0.\n\nCase 1: y = 0\nIn this case, the equation of X becomes:\n\nx³ = 0\n\nThis implies x = 0. So, the only intersection point in this case is [0:0:1] (in homogeneous coordinates).\n\nCase 2: x² + xy + y² = 0\nNow, let's substitute this expression into the equation of X:\n\nx³ + 2x²y + xy² + y³ = 0\n\nWe can factor out an x from the first three terms:\n\nx(x² + 2xy + y²) + y³ = 0\n\nNow, notice that x² + 2xy + y² = (x + y)². So, we have:\n\nx(x + y)² + y³ = 0\n\nSince we are in the case where x² + xy + y² = 0, we can substitute this back into the equation:\n\nx(-y)² + y³ = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nx(y²) + y³ = 0\n\nNow, we can factor out a y²:\n\ny²(x + y) = 0\n\nThis implies that either y² = 0 or x + y = 0.\n\nSubcase 2.1: y² = 0\nIn this case, we have y = 0, which we already considered in Case 1.\n\nSubcase 2.2: x + y = 0\nIn this case, we can substitute x = -y into the equation of Y:\n\n(-y)²y + (-y)y² + y³ = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ny³ - y³ + y³ = 0\n\nThis implies that y³ = 0, so y = 0. But this is again the same as Case 1.\n\nTherefore, the only intersection point of X and Y is [0:0:1], and the degree of the intersection is 1."
