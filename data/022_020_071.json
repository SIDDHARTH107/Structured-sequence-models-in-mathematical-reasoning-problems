    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using the method of separation of variables, we assume that the solution $u(x, y)$ can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $y$. That is, $u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$. \n\nSubstituting this into the given partial differential equation, we get:\n\n$(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) + X(x)Y(y)) = 0$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} + 1 = 0$\n\nSince the left side depends on both $x$ and $y$, the only way for this equation to hold for all $x$ and $y$ is if both terms are equal to a constant. Let's denote this constant as $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2 - 1$\n\n$\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda^2$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$X''(x) + (\\lambda^2 + 1)X(x) = 0$\n\n$Y''(y) - \\lambda^2 Y(y) = 0$\n\nSolve the first equation for $X(x)$:\n\nThe general solution of this equation is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 + 1}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 + 1}x)$\n\nNow, apply the boundary conditions $u(0, y) = 1$ and $u(1, y) = 2$:\n\n$X(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 1$\n\n$X(1) = \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 + 1}) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 + 1}) = 2$\n\nNow, solve the second equation for $Y(y)$:\n\nThe general solution of this equation is:\n\n$Y(y) = C\\cosh(\\lambda y) + D\\sinh(\\lambda y)$\n\nApply the boundary conditions $u(x, 0) = 0$ and $u(x, 1) = 0$:\n\n$Y(0) = C\\cosh(0) + D\\sinh(0) = C = 0$\n\n$Y(1) = D\\sinh(\\lambda) = 0$\n\nSince $D$ cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have $\\sinh(\\lambda) = 0$. However, this is not possible because $\\sinh(x)$ is never zero for nonzero $x$. Therefore, there is no solution for this problem using the method of separation of variables."
