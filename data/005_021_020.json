    "message_1": "A store has collected data of the number of items sold per day for the past 30 days. The mean and standard deviation of the data are 75 and 10, respectively. Use bootstrapping to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean of items sold per day.",
    "message_2": "Bootstrapping is a resampling technique used to estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with replacement. To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean of items sold per day using bootstrapping, follow these steps:\n\n1. Resample the original dataset with replacement multiple times (e.g., 1000 times) to create new datasets of the same size (30 days).\n2. Calculate the mean of each resampled dataset.\n3. Arrange the calculated means in ascending order.\n4. Determine the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the means, which represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nSince we don't have the original dataset, we can't perform the bootstrapping process directly. However, we can provide a general idea of what the confidence interval might look like based on the given mean and standard deviation.\n\nGiven:\n- Mean (µ) = 75 items sold per day\n- Standard deviation (σ) = 10 items sold per day\n- Sample size (n) = 30 days\n\nUsing the Central Limit Theorem, we know that the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean (µ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nStandard error (SE) = σ / √n = 10 / √30 ≈ 1.83\n\nNow, we can estimate the 95% confidence interval using the standard error and the z-score for a 95% confidence interval (1.96).\n\nLower bound = µ - 1.96 * SE ≈ 75 - 1.96 * 1.83 ≈ 71.61\nUpper bound = µ + 1.96 * SE ≈ 75 + 1.96 * 1.83 ≈ 78.39\n\nSo, the estimated 95% confidence interval for the population mean of items sold per day is approximately (71.61, 78.39). Keep in mind that this is just an estimation based on the provided mean and standard deviation, and the actual confidence interval would require bootstrapping with the original dataset."
