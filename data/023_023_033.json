    "message_1": "A network has an input signal given by the function $f(t) = 3\\sin(4\\pi t) + 4\\cos(6\\pi t)$, where $t$ is time measured in seconds. Find the frequency components of the input signal using the Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency components of the input signal, we can analyze the given function $f(t) = 3\\sin(4\\pi t) + 4\\cos(6\\pi t)$. The Fourier transform is not necessary in this case, as the function is already given as a sum of sinusoids.\n\nThe first term, $3\\sin(4\\pi t)$, is a sinusoidal function with a frequency of $4\\pi$ radians per second. To convert this to Hertz (cycles per second), we can divide by $2\\pi$:\n\nFrequency 1: $\\frac{4\\pi}{2\\pi} = 2$ Hz\n\nThe second term, $4\\cos(6\\pi t)$, is a sinusoidal function with a frequency of $6\\pi$ radians per second. To convert this to Hertz, we can divide by $2\\pi$:\n\nFrequency 2: $\\frac{6\\pi}{2\\pi} = 3$ Hz\n\nSo, the frequency components of the input signal are 2 Hz and 3 Hz."
