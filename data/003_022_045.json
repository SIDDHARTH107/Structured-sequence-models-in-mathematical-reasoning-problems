    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n|u| = √((-3)^2 + (1)^2) = √(9 + 1) = √10\n|v| = √((2)^2 + (5)^2) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (|u| |v|)\n\nwhere u · v is the dot product of u and v. To find the dot product, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = (-3)(2) + (1)(5) = -6 + 5 = -1\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula for cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (-1) / (√10 * √29)\n\nNow, we can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ) = (√10)(√29)(-1) / (√10 * √29) = -1\n\nSo, the dot product of the two vectors u and v is -1."
