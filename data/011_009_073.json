    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Bell numbers. A Bell number is a number that counts the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets. The Bell number B(n) can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:\n\nB(n) = sum of S(n, k) for k = 1 to n, where S(n, k) is the Stirling number of the second kind.\n\nFor the given problem, we have a group of 6 people, so we need to find the Bell number B(6).\n\nUsing the Bell triangle or Bell numbers table, we can find the Bell numbers for n = 1 to 6:\n\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\nB(5) = 52\nB(6) = 203\n\nSo, there are 203 ways to split a group of 6 people into smaller groups for a team building activity."
