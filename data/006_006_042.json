    "message_2": "The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes (team A winning, team B winning, and a draw) must equal 1. Let P(B) be the probability of team B winning the match. We can set up the equation:\n\nP(A) + P(B) + P(draw) = 1\n\nSubstitute the given probabilities:\n\n(2/5) + P(B) + (1/5) = 1\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(3/5) + P(B) = 1\n\nNow, subtract (3/5) from both sides of the equation to solve for P(B):\n\nP(B) = 1 - (3/5)\n\nP(B) = (5/5) - (3/5)\n\nP(B) = 2/5\n\nSo, the probability of team B winning the match is 2/5."
