    "message_1": "Suppose a group of 8 students are going to be split into two teams of 4 players each for a game. How many possible team combinations can be made if two players, Bob and Alice, refuse to be on the same team?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the total number of ways to split the 8 students into two teams of 4 without any restrictions. This can be done using combinations, which is given by the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students and k is the number of students in each team.\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * (8-4)!)\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * 4!)\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nNow, let's consider the cases where Bob and Alice are on the same team. There are two possibilities: either they are both on Team 1 or both on Team 2.\n\nIf they are both on Team 1, there are 6 remaining students to choose from to fill the other 2 spots on Team 1. This can be done in C(6, 2) ways:\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!)\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * 4!)\nC(6, 2) = 15\n\nSimilarly, if they are both on Team 2, there are also 15 ways to choose the other 2 players for Team 2.\n\nSo, there are a total of 15 + 15 = 30 ways where Bob and Alice are on the same team.\n\nNow, to find the number of ways where Bob and Alice are not on the same team, we subtract the number of ways they are on the same team from the total number of ways without any restrictions:\n\nTotal combinations = 70 - 30 = 40\n\nTherefore, there are 40 possible team combinations where Bob and Alice are not on the same team."
