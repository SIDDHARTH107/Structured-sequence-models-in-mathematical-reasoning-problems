    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between vertex A and vertex D, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Assign tentative distances to all vertices: set the distance to the starting vertex (A) to 0 and all other vertices to infinity.\n2. Set the current vertex as the starting vertex (A).\n3. For each neighbor of the current vertex, calculate the distance to the neighbor through the current vertex. If this distance is less than the previously known distance to the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance.\n4. Mark the current vertex as visited.\n5. Select the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance as the new current vertex and repeat steps 3-5 until all vertices have been visited or the target vertex (D) has been visited.\n\nApplying the algorithm:\n\n1. Tentative distances: A=0, B=∞, C=∞, D=∞\n2. Current vertex: A\n3. Neighbors of A: B and C. Update distances: B=2, C=3\n4. Mark A as visited.\n5. Smallest tentative distance: B=2. Set B as the new current vertex.\n\n1. Tentative distances: A=0, B=2, C=3, D=∞\n2. Current vertex: B\n3. Neighbors of B: A and D. Update distances: D=5 (2+3)\n4. Mark B as visited.\n5. Smallest tentative distance: C=3. Set C as the new current vertex.\n\n1. Tentative distances: A=0, B=2, C=3, D=5\n2. Current vertex: C\n3. Neighbors of C: A and D. Update distances: D=4 (3+1)\n4. Mark C as visited.\n5. Smallest tentative distance: D=4. Set D as the new current vertex.\n\n1. Tentative distances: A=0, B=2, C=3, D=4\n2. Current vertex: D\n3. Neighbors of D: B and C. No need to update distances since D is the target vertex.\n4. Mark D as visited.\n\nThe shortest path between vertex A and vertex D is A -> C -> D, and the corresponding distance is 4."
