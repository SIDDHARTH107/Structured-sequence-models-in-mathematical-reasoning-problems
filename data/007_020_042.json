    "message_1": "Suppose that Alice sends a message to Bob using RSA encryption with a public key (e, n) where e=5 and n=323. If Alice encodes the message \"HELLO\" into one integer m using ASCII code, what is the corresponding ciphertext c that Bob receives?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to convert the message \"HELLO\" into its ASCII representation. The ASCII codes for each character are as follows:\n\nH - 72\nE - 69\nL - 76\nL - 76\nO - 79\n\nNow, we concatenate these codes to form a single integer:\n\nm = 7269767679\n\nNext, we use the RSA encryption formula to compute the ciphertext c:\n\nc = m^e mod n\n\nPlugging in the values for e and n:\n\nc = 7269767679^5 mod 323\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\nc = 315\n\nSo, the ciphertext c that Bob receives is 315."
