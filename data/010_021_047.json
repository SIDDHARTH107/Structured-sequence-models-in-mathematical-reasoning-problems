Let $f = x_1^2 - x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2$ be a smooth function on $M$. Find the Hamiltonian vector field $X_f$ associated to $f$.\n\nHint: Recall that the Hamiltonian vector field $X_f$ is characterized by the condition $i_{X_f}\\omega = df$, where $i_{X_f}\\omega$ denotes the interior product of $\\omega$ with $X_f$, which is a 1-form, and $df$ is the differential of $f$, which is also a 1-form.",
    "message_2": "First, we compute the differential of the function $f$. The differential of a function is given by the sum of its partial derivatives with respect to each coordinate, multiplied by the corresponding coordinate differentials:\n\n$$df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} dx_1 + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} dx_2$$\n\nTaking the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x_1$ and $x_2$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} = 2x_1 + 2x_2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} = -2x_2 + 2x_1$$\n\nSo, the differential of $f$ is:\n\n$$df = (2x_1 + 2x_2) dx_1 + (-2x_2 + 2x_1) dx_2$$\n\nNow, we need to find the Hamiltonian vector field $X_f$ such that $i_{X_f}\\omega = df$. The Hamiltonian vector field $X_f$ can be written as:\n\n$$X_f = a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} + b \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2}$$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are functions of $x_1$ and $x_2$. The interior product $i_{X_f}\\omega$ is given by:\n\n$$i_{X_f}\\omega = a \\omega(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1}) + b \\omega(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2})$$\n\nUsing the matrix representation of $\\omega$, we can write this as:\n\n$$i_{X_f}\\omega = a \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + b \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2a - b \\\\ -a + 2b \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow, we need to find $a$ and $b$ such that $i_{X_f}\\omega = df$. Comparing the components of $i_{X_f}\\omega$ and $df$, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$$2a - b = 2x_1 + 2x_2$$\n$$-a + 2b = -2x_2 + 2x_1$$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that $a = x_1 + x_2$ and $b = x_1 - x_2$. Therefore, the Hamiltonian vector field $X_f$ is:\n\n$$X_f = (x_1 + x_2) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} + (x_1 - x_2) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2}$$"
