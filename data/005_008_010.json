    "message_2": "To find the trendline equation, we will use the least squares method to fit a linear regression model to the data. The equation of a linear regression model is given by:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nwhere y is the dependent variable (sales), x is the independent variable (month), m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean of the x values (months) and the mean of the y values (sales):\n\nMean of x values (months): (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 12) / 12 = 78 / 12 = 6.5\nMean of y values (sales): (300 + 350 + 450 + ... + 1300) / 12 = 7800 / 12 = 650\n\nNext, we need to calculate the slope (m) using the following formula:\n\nm = Σ[(x - x_mean)(y - y_mean)] / Σ(x - x_mean)^2\n\nCalculating the numerator and denominator separately:\n\nNumerator: Σ[(x - x_mean)(y - y_mean)] = (1-6.5)(300-650) + (2-6.5)(350-650) + ... + (12-6.5)(1300-650) = 45500\n\nDenominator: Σ(x - x_mean)^2 = (1-6.5)^2 + (2-6.5)^2 + ... + (12-6.5)^2 = 429.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the slope (m):\n\nm = 45500 / 429.5 ≈ 105.93\n\nNext, we need to calculate the y-intercept (b) using the following formula:\n\nb = y_mean - m * x_mean\n\nb = 650 - 105.93 * 6.5 ≈ 31.96\n\nNow, we have the trendline equation:\n\ny = 105.93x + 31.96\n\nTo predict the sales for the 13th month, we can plug x = 13 into the equation:\n\ny = 105.93 * 13 + 31.96 ≈ 1400.09\n\nThe predicted sales for the 13th month are approximately 1400 units."
