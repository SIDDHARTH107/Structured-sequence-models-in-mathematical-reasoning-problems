    "message_2": "Proof:\n\nAssume for contradiction that there exists an infinite model (A, R) of T. Since R is irreflexive and transitive, it is also a strict partial order on A. We will show that this leads to a contradiction with the assumption that there are no infinite descending chains in R.\n\nConsider the set A. Since A is infinite, we can choose an element a_1 from A. Now, consider the set A - {a_1}. If this set is empty, then A would be finite, which contradicts our assumption. So, there must be an element a_2 in A - {a_1}. Since R is a strict partial order, either a_1Ra_2 or a_2Ra_1 must hold. Without loss of generality, assume a_1Ra_2.\n\nNow, consider the set A - {a_1, a_2}. Again, if this set is empty, then A would be finite, which contradicts our assumption. So, there must be an element a_3 in A - {a_1, a_2}. Since R is a strict partial order, either a_2Ra_3 or a_3Ra_2 must hold. Without loss of generality, assume a_2Ra_3.\n\nContinuing this process, we can construct an infinite sequence a_1, a_2, a_3, ... such that a_iRa_(i+1) for all i. This is an infinite descending chain in R, which contradicts the assumption that there are no infinite descending chains in R.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that there exists an infinite model of T must be false. Hence, every model of T is finite."
