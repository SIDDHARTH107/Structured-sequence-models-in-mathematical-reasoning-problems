    "message_1": "In a group of 8 friends, how many different ways can they sit at a circular table if two of the friends, Alice and Bob, refuse to sit next to each other?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of circular permutations and complementary counting.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways the 8 friends can sit at the circular table without any restrictions. Since there is no fixed starting point in a circle, we consider (n-1)! ways for n people to sit in a circle. In this case, there are 7! ways for the 8 friends to sit, which is equal to 5,040 ways.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways Alice and Bob sit next to each other. We can treat Alice and Bob as a single entity, so we have 7 entities (6 friends + 1 Alice-Bob pair) to arrange in a circle. There are (7-1)! = 6! ways to arrange these entities, which is equal to 720 ways. However, within the Alice-Bob pair, there are 2! ways to arrange Alice and Bob. So, there are 720 * 2 = 1,440 ways where Alice and Bob sit next to each other.\n\nNow, we can use complementary counting to find the number of ways where Alice and Bob do not sit next to each other. We subtract the number of ways they sit together from the total number of ways:\n\n5,040 (total ways) - 1,440 (Alice and Bob together) = 3,600 ways\n\nSo, there are 3,600 different ways for the 8 friends to sit at the circular table with Alice and Bob not sitting next to each other."
