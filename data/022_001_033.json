    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{1-z}$, we can use the geometric series formula. Recall that for $|x| < 1$, the geometric series converges and can be written as:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^n = \\frac{1}{1-x}$$\n\nNow, let $x = z$. Then, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{1-z} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} z^n$$\n\nThis series converges for $|z| < 1$. However, we want to find an analytic continuation of $f(z)$ for the entire complex plane, except for the point $z = 1$. To do this, we can rewrite $f(z)$ in terms of another variable, say $w$, such that $z = 1 - w$. Then, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - (1 - w)} = \\frac{1}{w}$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the geometric series formula in terms of $w$:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1 - w)^n = \\frac{1}{w}$$\n\nThis series converges for $|1 - w| < 1$, which is equivalent to $0 < |w| < 2$. Since $z = 1 - w$, we have $-1 < z < 1$. Thus, the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1 - (1 - z))^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} z^n$$\n\nThis series converges for the entire complex plane, except for the point $z = 1$."
