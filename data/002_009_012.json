    "message_1": "A cylinder has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm. What is its surface area?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius. In this case, the radius is 5 cm.\n\nArea of one circular base = π(5 cm)² = 25π cm²\n\nSince there are two bases, we multiply this area by 2:\n\nTotal area of both bases = 2 × 25π cm² = 50π cm²\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height. In this case, the radius is 5 cm and the height is 10 cm.\n\nLateral surface area = 2π(5 cm)(10 cm) = 100π cm²\n\nFinally, we add the areas of the bases and the lateral surface area together to find the total surface area:\n\nTotal surface area = 50π cm² + 100π cm² = 150π cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is 150π cm²."
