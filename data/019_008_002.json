    "message_1": "A student is measuring the length of a pencil using a ruler with precision of 1 mm. However, due to human error, the student's measurement may be off by plus or minus 0.5 mm. If the student measures the length of the pencil to be 15.8 mm, what is the range of possible actual lengths of the pencil using fuzzy logic?",
    "message_2": "Using fuzzy logic, we can account for the possible human error in the student's measurement. The student measured the pencil to be 15.8 mm, and the error could be off by plus or minus 0.5 mm. \n\nTo find the range of possible actual lengths of the pencil, we can add and subtract the error from the measured length:\n\nLower bound: 15.8 mm - 0.5 mm = 15.3 mm\nUpper bound: 15.8 mm + 0.5 mm = 16.3 mm\n\nSo, the range of possible actual lengths of the pencil is between 15.3 mm and 16.3 mm."
