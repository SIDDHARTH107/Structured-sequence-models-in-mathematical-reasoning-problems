    "message_2": "To find the geodesic path on the surface of a sphere, we can use the great circle distance formula. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere, and its plane passes through the center of the sphere. The geodesic path between two points on a sphere is the shortest path along the great circle that connects them.\n\nLet's first convert the Cartesian coordinates (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) to spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ), where r is the radius, θ is the polar angle (angle from the positive z-axis), and φ is the azimuthal angle (angle from the positive x-axis in the xy-plane).\n\nFor the point (1,0,0):\nr = 5 (given)\nθ = arccos(z/r) = arccos(0/5) = π/2\nφ = arctan(y/x) = arctan(0/1) = 0\n\nSo, the spherical coordinates are (5, π/2, 0).\n\nFor the point (0,1,0):\nr = 5 (given)\nθ = arccos(z/r) = arccos(0/5) = π/2\nφ = arctan(y/x) = arctan(1/0) = π/2\n\nSo, the spherical coordinates are (5, π/2, π/2).\n\nNow, we can use the great circle distance formula to find the geodesic path:\n\nd = r * arccos(sin(θ1) * sin(θ2) * cos(φ1 - φ2) + cos(θ1) * cos(θ2))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nd = 5 * arccos(sin(π/2) * sin(π/2) * cos(0 - π/2) + cos(π/2) * cos(π/2))\nd = 5 * arccos(1 * 1 * 0 + 0 * 0)\nd = 5 * arccos(0)\nd = 5 * π/2\n\nSo, the geodesic path between the points (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) on the surface of a sphere of radius 5 is 5 * π/2 units long."
