    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 6 cm and a minor radius of 3 cm. Assuming the torus is a solid shape, what is its total volume rounded to the nearest tenth?",
    "message_2": "The volume of a torus can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * (minor radius)^2) * (2 * π * major radius)\n\nIn this case, the major radius is 6 cm and the minor radius is 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (π * (3 cm)^2) * (2 * π * 6 cm)\n\nVolume = (π * 9 cm^2) * (12π cm)\n\nVolume = 108π^2 cm^3\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nVolume ≈ 108 * (3.14)^2 cm^3\n\nVolume ≈ 108 * 9.8596 cm^3\n\nVolume ≈ 1064.9536 cm^3\n\nRounded to the nearest tenth, the volume of the torus is approximately 1065.0 cm^3."
