    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin tosses, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads) in n trials (coin tosses)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (getting a head) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (getting a tail) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n is the number of trials (coin tosses), which is 5 in this case\n- k is the number of successes (heads) we want, which is 3 in this case\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 3) = (5C3) * (0.5^3) * (0.5^(5-3))\n\nFirst, let's calculate 5C3:\n\n5C3 = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 5! / (3!2!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(2*1)) = 10\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\n(0.5^3) = 0.125\n(0.5^(5-3)) = (0.5^2) = 0.25\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.125 * 0.25 = 10 * 0.03125 = 0.3125\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin tosses is 0.3125 or 31.25%."
