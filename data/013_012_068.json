    "message_1": "Consider the following Stackelberg competition model:\n\nFirm 1 is the leader and Firm 2 is the follower. The market demand function is given by Q = 100 - P. The cost functions for the two firms are given by C1(Q1) = 5Q1, and C2(Q2) = 2Q2.\n\nAssuming perfect information and no collusion, what is the Stackelberg equilibrium level of output for Firm 1 and Firm 2? What is the price in the market? What is the profit earned by each firm at the equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To find the Stackelberg equilibrium level of output for Firm 1 and Firm 2, we first need to find the reaction function for Firm 2. We do this by maximizing Firm 2's profit function with respect to its output (Q2) while taking Firm 1's output (Q1) as given.\n\nThe profit function for Firm 2 is given by:\n\nπ2(Q2) = P * Q2 - C2(Q2)\n\nSince Q = Q1 + Q2 and P = 100 - Q, we can rewrite the profit function as:\n\nπ2(Q2) = (100 - Q1 - Q2) * Q2 - 2Q2\n\nNow, we take the first-order derivative with respect to Q2 and set it to zero to find the optimal output for Firm 2:\n\ndπ2/dQ2 = 100 - Q1 - 2Q2 - 2 = 0\n\nSolving for Q2, we get the reaction function for Firm 2:\n\nQ2 = (98 - Q1) / 2\n\nNow, we can find the optimal output for Firm 1 by maximizing its profit function with respect to Q1, taking into account the reaction function of Firm 2:\n\nπ1(Q1) = P * Q1 - C1(Q1)\n\nSubstituting the reaction function of Firm 2 and the demand function, we get:\n\nπ1(Q1) = (100 - Q1 - (98 - Q1) / 2) * Q1 - 5Q1\n\nSimplifying and taking the first-order derivative with respect to Q1, we get:\n\ndπ1/dQ1 = 50 - 3Q1/2 - 5 = 0\n\nSolving for Q1, we get the Stackelberg equilibrium output for Firm 1:\n\nQ1 = 30\n\nNow, we can find the Stackelberg equilibrium output for Firm 2 by plugging Q1 into its reaction function:\n\nQ2 = (98 - 30) / 2 = 34\n\nThus, the Stackelberg equilibrium level of output for Firm 1 is 30 and for Firm 2 is 34.\n\nNext, we find the market price by plugging the equilibrium quantities into the demand function:\n\nP = 100 - (Q1 + Q2) = 100 - (30 + 34) = 36\n\nThe market price at the Stackelberg equilibrium is 36.\n\nFinally, we can find the profit earned by each firm at the equilibrium by plugging the equilibrium quantities and price into their respective profit functions:\n\nπ1 = P * Q1 - C1(Q1) = 36 * 30 - 5 * 30 = 930\n\nπ2 = P * Q2 - C2(Q2) = 36 * 34 - 2 * 34 = 1156\n\nAt the Stackelberg equilibrium, Firm 1 earns a profit of 930, and Firm 2 earns a profit of 1156."
