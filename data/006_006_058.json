    "message_1": "In a basketball game, the probability of a particular player making a free throw is 0.8. If the player takes 10 free throws in the game, what is the probability that they make all 10 free throws?",
    "message_2": "Since the probability of making a free throw is independent for each attempt, we can simply multiply the probability of making each free throw together. \n\nThe probability of making all 10 free throws is:\n\n0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.8^10 = 0.1073741824\n\nSo, the probability of the player making all 10 free throws is approximately 0.1074 or 10.74%."
