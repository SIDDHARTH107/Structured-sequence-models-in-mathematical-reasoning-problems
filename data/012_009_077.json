    "message_2": "This degree sequence is not possible. To determine if a degree sequence is possible, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nIn this case, the sum of the degrees is 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 14, which is not an even number. Since the sum of the degrees must be even according to the Handshaking Lemma, this degree sequence is not possible for any graph."
