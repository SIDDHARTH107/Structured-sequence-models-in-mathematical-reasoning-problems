    "message_2": "First, we will perform Gaussian elimination to transform the system of linear equations into an upper triangular matrix.\n\n1. We will use the third equation as the first pivot equation since it already has x isolated:\n\nx - 3y + 2z = -1\n2x + y - z = 5\n3x + 2y + z = 2\n\n2. Eliminate x from the second and third equations:\n\nSecond equation: (2x + y - z) - 2*(x - 3y + 2z) = 5 - 2*(-1)\n=> -5y + 3z = 7\n\nThird equation: (3x + 2y + z) - 3*(x - 3y + 2z) = 2 - 3*(-1)\n=> 11y - 5z = 5\n\nNow we have the following upper triangular matrix:\n\nx - 3y + 2z = -1\n-5y + 3z = 7\n11y - 5z = 5\n\n3. Solve for y in the second equation:\n\ny = (7 + 5z) / -5\n\n4. Substitute y into the third equation:\n\n11((7 + 5z) / -5) - 5z = 5\n\n5. Solve for z:\n\n-11 - z = 5\nz = -16\n\n6. Substitute z back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (7 + 5*(-16)) / -5\ny = 3\n\n7. Substitute y and z back into the first equation:\n\nx - 3(3) + 2(-16) = -1\nx = 2\n\nSo the solution is x = 2, y = 3, and z = -16."
