    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, a statement is considered true if there is a constructive proof for it. In this case, we have two premises:\n\nP: 2+2=4\nQ: 2+2=5\n\nWe know that P is true because it has a constructive proof: 2+2 indeed equals 4. However, Q is false because there is no constructive proof that 2+2 equals 5.\n\nIn intuitionistic logic, the statement \"Either P or Q is true\" can be represented as P ∨ Q. This statement is true if there is a constructive proof for either P or Q. Since we have a constructive proof for P (2+2=4), the statement \"Either P or Q is true\" (P ∨ Q) is true in intuitionistic logic."
