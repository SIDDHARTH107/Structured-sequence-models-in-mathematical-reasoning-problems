    "message_1": "Consider the following non-monotonic logic rule: \"If John is not at home, he is most likely at work.\" If John is at home with a probability of 0.6, what is the probability that he is at work?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the event that John is at home, and B be the event that John is at work. We are given P(A) = 0.6, and we want to find P(B).\n\nSince John can only be in one of these two places (home or work), the probabilities of these events must sum to 1. Therefore, P(A) + P(B) = 1.\n\nWe can now solve for P(B):\n\nP(B) = 1 - P(A)\nP(B) = 1 - 0.6\nP(B) = 0.4\n\nSo, the probability that John is at work is 0.4 or 40%."
