    "message_2": "To find the degree of the polynomial, we need to find the highest total degree of any term in the polynomial. The total degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of the variables in that term. Let's find the total degree of each term:\n\n1. $x^2y$: The total degree is $2 + 1 = 3$.\n2. $xz^2$: The total degree is $1 + 2 = 3$.\n3. $7y^2z$: The total degree is $2 + 1 = 3$.\n4. $4xyz$: The total degree is $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\n\nThe highest total degree among all terms is 3, so the degree of the polynomial is 3.\n\nNow, let's determine if the polynomial is homogeneous. A polynomial is homogeneous if all its terms have the same total degree. In this case, all terms have a total degree of 3, so the polynomial is homogeneous."
