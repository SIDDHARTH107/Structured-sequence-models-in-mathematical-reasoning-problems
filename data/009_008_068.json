    "message_1": "A rope that is 10 meters long is held at one end and the other end is shaken back and forth with a frequency of 4 Hz. The wave moving along the rope travels at a speed of 20 m/s. At time t = 0, the shaking causes the rope to form a wave that has a displacement given by y(x,0) = 0.3 sin(πx/10), where x is measured in meters. Find the displacement of the rope at time t = 0.05 s at a point x = 2 meters.",
    "message_2": "To find the displacement of the rope at time t = 0.05 s and x = 2 meters, we need to use the wave equation:\n\ny(x, t) = A sin(kx - ωt + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nFrom the given displacement equation at t = 0, we have:\n\ny(x, 0) = 0.3 sin(πx/10)\n\nComparing this with the general wave equation, we can identify the following parameters:\n\nA = 0.3\nk = π/10\nφ = 0 (since there is no phase shift)\n\nNow, we need to find the angular frequency ω. We are given the frequency f = 4 Hz. The angular frequency is related to the frequency by the equation:\n\nω = 2πf\n\nSubstituting the given frequency:\n\nω = 2π(4) = 8π\n\nNow, we have all the parameters needed to find the displacement at time t = 0.05 s and x = 2 meters. Plugging these values into the wave equation:\n\ny(2, 0.05) = 0.3 sin((π/10)(2) - (8π)(0.05))\n\ny(2, 0.05) = 0.3 sin(π/5 - 4π/5)\n\ny(2, 0.05) = 0.3 sin(-3π/5)\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of the sine function:\n\nsin(-3π/5) ≈ -0.9511\n\nFinally, multiply by the amplitude:\n\ny(2, 0.05) = 0.3(-0.9511) ≈ -0.2853\n\nSo, the displacement of the rope at time t = 0.05 s and x = 2 meters is approximately -0.2853 meters."
