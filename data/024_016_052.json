    "message_1": "Consider the 2-dimensional manifold given by the parameterization \n\n$x(u,v) = u\\cos(v)$ and $y(u,v) = u\\sin(v)$. \n\nLet $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^3$ and $T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}$ be a vector field on this manifold. Find the covariant derivative $\\nabla_T df$ of the differential $df$ along the vector field $T$.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the partial derivatives of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3y^2$.\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of $x(u,v)$ and $y(u,v)$ with respect to $u$ and $v$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial u} = \\cos(v)$, $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial v} = -u\\sin(v)$, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u} = \\sin(v)$, and $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial v} = u\\cos(v)$.\n\nNext, we need to find the partial derivatives of $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$ with respect to $u$ and $v$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial u \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(2x) = 2\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial u} = 2\\cos(v)$,\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial v \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}(2x) = 2\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial v} = -2u\\sin(v)$,\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial u \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(3y^2) = 3\\cdot 2y\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u} = 6y\\sin(v)$,\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial v \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}(3y^2) = 3\\cdot 2y\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial v} = 6y\\cos(v)$.\n\nFinally, we can compute the covariant derivative $\\nabla_T df$:\n\n$\\nabla_T df = T(df) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}\\right)(df) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(2x\\,dx + 3y^2\\,dy) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}(2x\\,dx + 3y^2\\,dy)$.\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\n$\\nabla_T df = \\left(2\\cos(v) + 6y\\sin(v)\\right)du + \\left(-2u\\sin(v) + 6y\\cos(v)\\right)dv$.\n\nSo, the covariant derivative of the differential $df$ along the vector field $T$ is:\n\n$\\nabla_T df = \\left(2\\cos(v) + 6y\\sin(v)\\right)du + \\left(-2u\\sin(v) + 6y\\cos(v)\\right)dv$."
