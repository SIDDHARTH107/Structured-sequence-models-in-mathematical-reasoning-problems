If they do exist, give an example of each. If they do not exist, explain why.",
    "message_2": "An Eulerian path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it has at most two vertices with an odd degree. A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits every vertex exactly once.\n\nLet's analyze the degrees of each vertex in the given graph:\n\nA: degree 3 (connected to B, C, D)\nB: degree 2 (connected to A, C)\nC: degree 3 (connected to A, B, D)\nD: degree 4 (connected to A, C, E, F)\nE: degree 3 (connected to D, F, G)\nF: degree 4 (connected to D, E, G, C)\nG: degree 2 (connected to E, F)\n\nThere are four vertices with odd degrees (A, C, E, F). Since there are more than two vertices with odd degrees, there is no Eulerian path in this graph.\n\nNow let's check for a Hamiltonian path. A Hamiltonian path is not as easily determined by vertex degrees, so we'll try to construct one:\n\nA possible Hamiltonian path is: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> G -> F\n\nThis path visits every vertex exactly once, so there is a Hamiltonian path in this graph."
