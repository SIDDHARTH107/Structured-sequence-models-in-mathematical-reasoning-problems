    "message_1": "In a round of the Ultimatum Game, Player A proposes a split of $100 between themselves and Player B. If Player B rejects the proposal, both players get nothing. If Player B accepts the proposal, both players receive the proposed amounts. What is the smallest amount that Player A can offer to still have a chance of Player B accepting the proposal?",
    "message_2": "The smallest amount that Player A can offer to still have a chance of Player B accepting the proposal is $1. This is because even though it is a small amount, it is still better for Player B to accept the $1 rather than rejecting the proposal and getting nothing. However, it is important to note that the likelihood of Player B accepting such a small amount may be low, as they may feel it is unfair. But theoretically, offering $1 still gives Player A a chance of having the proposal accepted."
