    "message_1": "If there are 10 players on a basketball team and the coach wants to select a starting lineup of 5 players, how many different lineups can the coach choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of different lineups the coach can choose, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of players (10 in this case), k is the number of players in the lineup (5 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 30240 / 120\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo, the coach can choose from 252 different lineups."
