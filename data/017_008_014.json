    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct groups of order 8, we will use the following facts from group theory:\n\n1. Every group of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer, is a p-group.\n2. Every group of order 8 is a 2-group since 8 = 2^3.\n3. The number of distinct groups of order p^n is determined by the number of distinct abelian p-group structures.\n\nNow, let's find the distinct abelian 2-group structures of order 8. There are two possibilities:\n\n1. C_8: A cyclic group of order 8.\n2. C_2 × C_4: A direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 4.\n\nNote that C_2 × C_4 is isomorphic to C_4 × C_2, so we don't need to consider it separately. Thus, there are two distinct abelian groups of order 8.\n\nNow, let's consider non-abelian groups of order 8. There are two well-known non-abelian groups of order 8:\n\n1. Q_8: The quaternion group of order 8.\n2. D_4: The dihedral group of order 8.\n\nTo prove that every non-abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to either Q_8 or D_4, let G be a non-abelian group of order 8. Since G is a 2-group, its center Z(G) is non-trivial. There are two possibilities for the order of Z(G):\n\n1. |Z(G)| = 2: In this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 4, which is isomorphic to either C_4 or C_2 × C_2. If G/Z(G) is isomorphic to C_4, then G is a central extension of C_4 by C_2, which leads to G being isomorphic to D_4. If G/Z(G) is isomorphic to C_2 × C_2, then G is a central extension of C_2 × C_2 by C_2, which leads to G being isomorphic to Q_8.\n\n2. |Z(G)| = 4: In this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 2, which is cyclic. However, this would imply that G is abelian, which contradicts our assumption that G is non-abelian.\n\nTherefore, every non-abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to either Q_8 or D_4.\n\nIn conclusion, there are four distinct groups of order 8: C_8, C_2 × C_4, Q_8, and D_4. However, since C_2 × C_4 is isomorphic to C_4 × C_2, we can say that there are three distinct groups of order 8 up to isomorphism: C_8, Q_8, and D_4."
