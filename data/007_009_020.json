    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, denoted as φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nFor a given number n, if n is a prime number, then φ(n) = n - 1, since all numbers less than n are relatively prime to n. However, if n is not prime, we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nIn this case, n = 27, which is not a prime number. We need to find the prime factors of 27:\n\n27 = 3^3\n\nThere is only one distinct prime factor, which is 3. Now, we can use the formula:\n\nφ(27) = 27 * (1 - 1/3) = 27 * (2/3) = 18\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for n = 27 is φ(27) = 18."
