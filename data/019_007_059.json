    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student to solve related to non-monotonic logic:\n\nSuppose you have the following statements:\n\n1) All cats have fur.\n2) Fluffy is a cat.\n\nBased on these statements, can you conclude that Fluffy has fur? \n\n(a) Yes\n(b) No \n\nJustify your answer using non-monotonic logic.",
    "message_2": "(a) Yes\n\nIn non-monotonic logic, we make conclusions based on the information we have, but these conclusions can be revised if new information is introduced. In this case, we have the following information:\n\n1) All cats have fur.\n2) Fluffy is a cat.\n\nFrom these statements, we can make the non-monotonic inference that Fluffy has fur. This is because, based on the information we have, it is reasonable to assume that Fluffy has fur since Fluffy is a cat and all cats have fur.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this conclusion is non-monotonic, meaning that if new information is introduced that contradicts our current knowledge (e.g., Fluffy is a hairless breed of cat), we may need to revise our conclusion. But with the given information, we can conclude that Fluffy has fur."
