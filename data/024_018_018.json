Calculate the sectional curvature of the surface at the point \\((1,1,2)\\) in the direction of the tangent vectors corresponding to the unit vectors \\(\\hat{i}+\\hat{j}\\) and \\(\\hat{i}-\\hat{j}\\), where \\(\\hat{i}\\) and \\(\\hat{j}\\) are the standard unit vectors in the xy-plane.",
    "message_2": "To compute the sectional curvature, we first need to find the tangent vectors at the point (1,1,2) corresponding to the given unit vectors.\n\nThe gradient of the surface is given by:\n∇z = (dz/dx, dz/dy) = (2x, 2y)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), the gradient is:\n∇z = (2, 2)\n\nNow, we find the tangent vectors corresponding to the unit vectors (1,1,0) and (1,-1,0). We can use the cross product of the gradient and the unit vectors to find the tangent vectors:\n\nT1 = ∇z × (1,1,0) = (2, 2) × (1, 1, 0) = (0, 0, -2)\nT2 = ∇z × (1,-1,0) = (2, 2) × (1, -1, 0) = (0, 0, 4)\n\nNow, we need to find the second fundamental form for the surface. The second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nII = | L M |\n        | M N |\n\nWhere L = ∇²z(T1,T1), M = ∇²z(T1,T2), and N = ∇²z(T2,T2).\n\nThe Laplacian of z is given by:\n∇²z = d²z/dx² + d²z/dy² = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nNow, we can compute the second fundamental form:\n\nL = ∇²z(T1,T1) = 4\nM = ∇²z(T1,T2) = 0\nN = ∇²z(T2,T2) = 4\n\nSo, the second fundamental form is:\n\nII = | 4 0 |\n        | 0 4 |\n\nNow, we can compute the sectional curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (L * N - M^2) / (T1 • T1 * T2 • T2 - (T1 • T2)^2)\n\nK = (4 * 4 - 0^2) / ((-2)^2 * 4^2 - (0)^2) = 16 / (16 * 16) = 1/16\n\nThus, the sectional curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,2) in the direction of the tangent vectors corresponding to the unit vectors (1,1,0) and (1,-1,0) is 1/16."
