The initial conditions are x(0) = 2 m and x'(0) = -1 m/s. Find the displacement of the mass as a function of time.",
    "message_2": "To find the displacement of the mass as a function of time, we first need to solve the given second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients:\n\n3x'' + 4x' + 9x = 0\n\nWe start by finding the characteristic equation:\n\n3r^2 + 4r + 9 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nr = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 3, b = 4, and c = 9. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nr = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4*3*9)) / 2*3\nr = (-4 ± √(-80)) / 6\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we have complex roots:\n\nr = -2/3 ± (√80)i/6\n\nLet α = -2/3 and β = √80/6. The general solution for the given differential equation is:\n\nx(t) = e^(αt) * (A*cos(βt) + B*sin(βt))\n\nNow, we need to find the constants A and B using the initial conditions.\n\n1. x(0) = 2\n2. x'(0) = -1\n\nFor the first initial condition, x(0) = 2:\n\n2 = e^(0) * (A*cos(0) + B*sin(0))\n2 = A\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of x(t):\n\nx'(t) = e^(αt) * (αA*cos(βt) + αB*sin(βt) - βA*sin(βt) + βB*cos(βt))\n\nFor the second initial condition, x'(0) = -1:\n\n-1 = e^(0) * (αA*cos(0) + αB*sin(0) - βA*sin(0) + βB*cos(0))\n-1 = αA + βB\n-1 = (-2/3)(2) + (√80/6)B\n-1 = -4/3 + (√80/6)B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = (3 - 4/3) * 6/√80\nB = 5/√80\n\nNow, we have the constants A and B, so we can write the displacement of the mass as a function of time:\n\nx(t) = e^(-2t/3) * (2*cos(√80t/6) + (5/√80)*sin(√80t/6))"
