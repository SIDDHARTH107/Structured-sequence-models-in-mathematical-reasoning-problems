    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization technique that is used to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. However, the given problem is a continuous optimization problem. Therefore, using tabu search is not the most appropriate method for this problem. Instead, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or other continuous optimization techniques to find the minimum value of the given function subject to the constraints.\n\nHowever, if you still want to use tabu search, you can discretize the problem by considering a grid of points within the feasible region and then apply the tabu search algorithm. Here's a simple outline of the tabu search algorithm for this problem:\n\n1. Define a grid of points within the feasible region, e.g., with a step size of 0.1 or smaller for better accuracy.\n2. Initialize the current solution (x, y) randomly within the feasible region.\n3. Define a tabu list to store recently visited solutions.\n4. Evaluate the objective function f(x, y) for the current solution.\n5. Generate a set of neighboring solutions by perturbing the current solution within the feasible region.\n6. Evaluate the objective function for each neighboring solution.\n7. Choose the best neighboring solution that is not in the tabu list.\n8. Update the current solution to the best neighboring solution.\n9. Update the tabu list by adding the current solution and removing the oldest solution if the list exceeds a predefined size.\n10. Repeat steps 4-9 for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n11. Return the best solution found.\n\nPlease note that this approach may not guarantee finding the global minimum, and the quality of the solution depends on the choice of parameters and the discretization of the problem."
