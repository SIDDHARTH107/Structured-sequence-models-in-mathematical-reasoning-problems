    "message_2": "To solve for x, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n$2^{x+1} = 16$\n\nSince $16 = 2^4$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n$2^{x+1} = 2^4$\n\nNow, since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\n$x+1 = 4$\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n$x = 4 - 1$\n\n$x = 3$\n\nSo, the solution is $x = 3$."
