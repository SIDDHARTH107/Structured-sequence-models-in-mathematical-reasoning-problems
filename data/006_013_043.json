    "message_1": "Suppose that a certain region experiences an average of 5 earthquakes per year. Find the probability that this region will have at least one earthquake in the next two years.",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, earthquakes) occurring in a fixed interval of time (in this case, years) given a constant average rate (in this case, 5 earthquakes per year).\n\nLet X be the number of earthquakes in the next two years. We want to find the probability P(X >= 1). To do this, it's easier to find the probability of the complementary event, which is P(X = 0), and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere λ is the average rate (in this case, λ = 5 earthquakes per year * 2 years = 10 earthquakes in two years), k is the number of events we're interested in (in this case, k = 0), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-10) * 10^0) / 0!\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-10) * 1) / 1\nP(X = 0) = e^(-10)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one earthquake in the next two years:\n\nP(X >= 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\nP(X >= 1) = 1 - e^(-10)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nP(X >= 1) ≈ 1 - 0.0000454\nP(X >= 1) ≈ 0.9999546\n\nSo, the probability that this region will have at least one earthquake in the next two years is approximately 99.995%."
