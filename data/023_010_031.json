    "message_1": "A grayscale image has intensity values ranging from 0 to 255. Its 2D Fourier transform is computed and the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients are scaled to be in the range of 0 to 1. Find the percentage of coefficients with magnitude greater than or equal to 0.25.",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of coefficients with magnitude greater than or equal to 0.25, we need more information about the image itself, such as its dimensions and the distribution of intensity values. The 2D Fourier transform of an image provides information about the frequency content of the image, and the magnitude of the coefficients represents the strength of the corresponding frequencies.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific image, we cannot determine the exact percentage of coefficients with magnitude greater than or equal to 0.25. The percentage would depend on the image content and its frequency distribution."
