    "message_2": "The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm depends on the data structure used for the priority queue. If we use a binary heap as the priority queue, the time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is O((n+m)logn), where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges in the graph.\n\nThe algorithm performs the following operations:\n1. Extract the vertex with the minimum distance value from the priority queue, which takes O(logn) time.\n2. Update the distance values of its adjacent vertices, which takes O(logn) time for each update.\n\nSince each vertex is extracted from the priority queue once and each edge is considered once for updating the distance values, the total time complexity is O(nlogn + mlogn) = O((n+m)logn)."
