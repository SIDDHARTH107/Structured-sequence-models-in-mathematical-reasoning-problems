    "message_2": "To find the value of x in the equation 2^(x+1) = 16, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Rewrite the equation in terms of the base 2: 2^(x+1) = 2^4, since 16 is equal to 2^4.\n2. Since the bases are the same (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other: x+1 = 4.\n3. Solve for x: x = 4 - 1 = 3.\n\nSo, the value of x is 3."
