    "message_1": "Here is a problem for the student to solve:\n\nSuppose that f(z) is an entire function that satisfies the inequality |f(z)| ≤ 10|z|^5 for all complex numbers z. Use Liouville's theorem to prove that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 4. Then, use the fundamental theorem of algebra to show that f(z) must have at least one zero in the complex plane.",
    "message_2": "To prove that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 4, we will use Liouville's theorem. Liouville's theorem states that if a function is entire (holomorphic on the entire complex plane) and bounded, then the function must be constant.\n\nFirst, let's consider the function g(z) = f(z) / z^4. Since f(z) is entire, g(z) is also entire except for a possible pole at z = 0. Now, we will show that g(z) is bounded.\n\nUsing the given inequality, we have:\n\n|f(z)| ≤ 10|z|^5\n\nDivide both sides by |z|^4:\n\n|f(z) / z^4| ≤ 10|z|\n\nThis implies that |g(z)| ≤ 10|z|.\n\nAs z goes to infinity, the right-hand side of the inequality goes to infinity as well. However, we are interested in the behavior of g(z) as z approaches 0. To analyze this, we can use the limit:\n\nlim (z -> 0) |g(z)| = lim (z -> 0) |f(z) / z^4|\n\nSince f(z) is entire, it can be represented by its Taylor series expansion around z = 0:\n\nf(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + a_3z^3 + a_4z^4 + ...\n\nThus, g(z) = (a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + a_3z^3 + a_4z^4 + ...) / z^4\n\nAs z approaches 0, the terms with z in the numerator will go to 0, and we are left with:\n\nlim (z -> 0) |g(z)| = |a_4|\n\nSince a_4 is a constant, g(z) is bounded as z approaches 0.\n\nNow we have shown that g(z) is entire and bounded, so by Liouville's theorem, g(z) must be a constant function. This means that f(z) = a_4z^4 + a_3z^3 + a_2z^2 + a_1z + a_0, which is a polynomial of degree at most 4.\n\nNext, we will use the fundamental theorem of algebra to show that f(z) must have at least one zero in the complex plane. The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant polynomial has at least one complex root.\n\nSince f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 4 and is not constant (otherwise it wouldn't satisfy the given inequality), it must have at least one complex root by the fundamental theorem of algebra."
