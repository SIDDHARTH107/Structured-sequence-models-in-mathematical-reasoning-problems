    "message_1": "A plane is flying at an altitude of 5 km. Its angle of elevation to a nearby mountain is 15 degrees. What is the minimum distance the plane can fly to the mountain before it crashes into it? (Assume the mountain's peak is at the same altitude as the plane)",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance from the plane to the mountain as x. Since the plane and the mountain's peak are at the same altitude, we can use the tangent function to solve this problem.\n\nThe tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle. In this case, the opposite side is the altitude of the plane (5 km), and the adjacent side is the distance we want to find (x).\n\ntan(angle) = opposite / adjacent\n\nWe are given the angle of elevation as 15 degrees. So, we can plug in the values and solve for x:\n\ntan(15°) = 5 / x\n\nTo find x, we can take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nx = 5 / tan(15°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the value of tan(15°):\n\ntan(15°) ≈ 0.26795\n\nx = 5 / 0.26795 ≈ 18.66 km\n\nSo, the minimum distance the plane can fly to the mountain before it crashes into it is approximately 18.66 km."
