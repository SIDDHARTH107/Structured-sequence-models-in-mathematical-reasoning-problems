    "message_1": "Consider two persons, Alice and Bob, who want to establish a shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Alice chooses a prime number p = 17 and a primitive root g = 3. She then selects a random number a = 4 and calculates A = g^a mod p. Bob also chooses a random number b = 7 and calculates B = g^b mod p. Now, they exchange A and B, and each of them calculates the shared secret key using the formula K = B^a mod p = A^b mod p. What is the value of the shared secret key K?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate A and B:\n\nA = g^a mod p = 3^4 mod 17 = 81 mod 17 = 13\n\nB = g^b mod p = 3^7 mod 17 = 2187 mod 17 = 10\n\nNow, Alice and Bob will calculate the shared secret key K:\n\nAlice calculates K = B^a mod p = 10^4 mod 17 = 10000 mod 17 = 15\n\nBob calculates K = A^b mod p = 13^7 mod 17 = 62748517 mod 17 = 15\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have calculated the same shared secret key K = 15."
