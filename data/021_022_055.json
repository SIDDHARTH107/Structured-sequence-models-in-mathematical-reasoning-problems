    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B. The profit per unit for product A is $50 and for product B is $70. The production of each product requires the company to use two types of machines, X and Y. The requirements per unit of product for each machine are as follows:\n\n- Product A: 2 machines X and 1 machine Y\n- Product B: 1 machine X and 3 machines Y\n\nThe company has 20 machines X and 30 machines Y available for production. Using the firefly algorithm, determine the optimal production quantities of products A and B that maximize the profit of the company.",
    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is typically used for solving complex optimization problems. However, the problem presented here can be solved using linear programming, which is a more straightforward and efficient method for this type of problem. \n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is the total profit, which is given by:\n\nP = 50x + 70y\n\nThe constraints are based on the available machines X and Y:\n\n2x + y ≤ 20 (Machine X constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 30 (Machine Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method or by using software like Excel Solver or Python's scipy.optimize.linprog.\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices (0, 0), (0, 10), (10, 0), and (4, 8). Evaluating the objective function at each vertex, we get:\n\nP(0, 0) = 0\nP(0, 10) = 700\nP(10, 0) = 500\nP(4, 8) = 760\n\nThe maximum profit is obtained at the vertex (4, 8), which means that the company should produce 4 units of product A and 8 units of product B to maximize its profit. The maximum profit will be $760."
