    "message_2": "To find the measure of the angle opposite the side with length 10, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, a = 7, b = 9, and c = 10. We want to find the angle C. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n10² = 7² + 9² - 2 * 7 * 9 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 49 + 81 - 126 * cos(C)\n\n100 = 130 - 126 * cos(C)\n\nNow, we isolate cos(C):\n\n-30 = -126 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = 30/126\n\ncos(C) ≈ 0.2381\n\nNow, we find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 0.2381:\n\nC = arccos(0.2381)\n\nC ≈ 76.37°\n\nSo, the measure of the angle opposite the side with length 10 is approximately 76.37°."
