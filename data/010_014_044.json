    "message_2": "Since H^2(X) is a cyclic group of order 3, we know that it is generated by a single element, say α, and that α^3 = 0 in H^2(X). Now, we want to find the order of H^8(X).\n\nRecall that the cup product is a graded commutative ring structure on the cohomology groups of a topological space. In particular, we have a bilinear map\n\n∪ : H^p(X) × H^q(X) → H^(p+q)(X)\n\nsatisfying (α ∪ β) ∪ γ = α ∪ (β ∪ γ) and α ∪ β = (-1)^(pq) β ∪ α for homogeneous elements α ∈ H^p(X) and β ∈ H^q(X).\n\nNow, consider the element α^4 = α ∪ α ∪ α ∪ α ∈ H^8(X). Since the cup product is associative, we have\n\nα^4 = (α ∪ α) ∪ (α ∪ α).\n\nSince α has order 3, we know that α^3 = α ∪ α ∪ α = 0. Therefore, α^2 = α ∪ α is an element of order 3 in H^4(X). This means that (α^2)^3 = (α ∪ α)^3 = (α ∪ α) ∪ (α ∪ α) ∪ (α ∪ α) = 0.\n\nNow, we can compute the order of α^4 in H^8(X):\n\n(α^4)^3 = (α ∪ α ∪ α ∪ α)^3 = (α^2 ∪ α^2)^3 = (α^2)^3 ∪ (α^2)^3 = 0 ∪ 0 = 0.\n\nSince α^4 has order 3 in H^8(X), we conclude that the order of H^8(X) is at least 3. However, we cannot determine the exact order of H^8(X) without more information about the cohomology ring structure of X."
