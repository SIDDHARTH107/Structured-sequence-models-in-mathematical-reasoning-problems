By definition, a set S is a superset of another set T if every element of T is also an element of S.\n\nLet's check if every element of A is in A ∪ B:\n\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ A and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of A are in A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if every element of B is in A ∪ B:\n\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ B and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ B and 5 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of B are in A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the resulting set A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is a superset of both set A and set B."
