    "message_2": "To determine the order of the zero of f(z) at z = 1, we first need to simplify the function f(z) and find its zeros. We can factor the numerator of f(z) as follows:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 - 3z + 2)/(z - 1)^3 = ((z - 1)(z - 2))/(z - 1)^3\n\nNow, we can cancel out one (z - 1) term from the numerator and the denominator:\n\nf(z) = (z - 2)/(z - 1)^2\n\nNow, we can see that f(z) has a zero at z = 2. Since there is no zero at z = 1, the order of the zero of f(z) at z = 1 is 0.\n\nNext, we need to determine the location and order of the poles of f(z) on the complex plane. A pole occurs when the denominator of a function is equal to zero. In this case, the denominator is (z - 1)^2, which is equal to zero when z = 1. The order of the pole is the exponent of the (z - 1) term in the denominator, which is 2.\n\nSo, f(z) has a pole of order 2 at z = 1 on the complex plane."
