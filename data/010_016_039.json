    "message_2": "To compute the Betti numbers of X, we need to find the ranks of its homology groups. Since X is a closed, orientable 3-dimensional manifold, we know that its homology groups are finitely generated. The intersection form on X is given by the matrix:\n\n[ 0 1\n  1 0 ]\n\nThis matrix represents the bilinear form on the second homology group H_2(X; Z). The signature of this matrix is the difference between the number of positive and negative eigenvalues. In this case, the matrix has eigenvalues 1 and -1, so the signature is 0.\n\nNow, let's compute the Betti numbers:\n\nb_0: The zeroth Betti number represents the number of connected components of X. Since X is connected, b_0 = 1.\n\nb_1: The first Betti number represents the rank of the first homology group H_1(X; Z). Since X is a 3-dimensional manifold, its first homology group is isomorphic to the abelianization of its fundamental group. The intersection form is given on H_2(X; Z), so it doesn't provide information about b_1 directly. However, we can use Poincaré duality, which states that b_1 = b_2 for a closed, orientable 3-manifold.\n\nb_2: The second Betti number represents the rank of the second homology group H_2(X; Z). The intersection form is non-degenerate, so the rank of H_2(X; Z) is equal to the size of the matrix, which is 2. Therefore, b_2 = 2.\n\nb_3: The third Betti number represents the rank of the third homology group H_3(X; Z). Since X is a closed, orientable 3-manifold, we have b_3 = b_0 = 1 by Poincaré duality.\n\nSo, the Betti numbers of X are b_0 = 1, b_1 = 2, b_2 = 2, and b_3 = 1."
