    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 20 cm initially at a uniform temperature of 50°C is suddenly placed in an environment at 10°C. Use the Fourier Transform to find the temperature distribution at any point along the rod, given that the thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.003 m²/s. Assume that the initial temperature profile of the rod follows a sine wave with wavelength 40 cm.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution at any point along the rod, we will use the heat equation and Fourier Transform. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature distribution, α is the thermal diffusivity, x is the position along the rod, and t is the time.\n\nGiven that the initial temperature profile of the rod follows a sine wave with wavelength 40 cm, we can write the initial condition as:\n\nT(x,0) = 40 + 10sin(πx/L)\n\nwhere L is the length of the rod (20 cm).\n\nNow, we will apply the Fourier Transform to the heat equation. The Fourier Transform of the heat equation is:\n\n∂T^(k,t)/∂t = -αk²T^(k,t)\n\nwhere T^(k,t) is the Fourier Transform of T(x,t) and k is the wave number.\n\nThis equation can be solved using separation of variables. Let T^(k,t) = F(k)G(t). Then, we have:\n\n∂G(t)/∂t = -αk²G(t)\n\nwhich can be solved as:\n\nG(t) = e^(-αk²t)\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier Transform of the initial condition:\n\nT^(k,0) = ∫[40 + 10sin(πx/L)]e^(-ikx) dx\n\nThe Fourier Transform of a constant is a delta function, and the Fourier Transform of a sine function is a combination of delta functions. Therefore, the Fourier Transform of the initial condition is:\n\nT^(k,0) = 40δ(k) + 5i[δ(k-π/L) - δ(k+π/L)]\n\nNow, we can find the solution T^(k,t) by multiplying T^(k,0) with G(t):\n\nT^(k,t) = 40δ(k)e^(-αk²t) + 5i[δ(k-π/L) - δ(k+π/L)]e^(-αk²t)\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature distribution T(x,t) by taking the inverse Fourier Transform of T^(k,t):\n\nT(x,t) = (1/2π) ∫ T^(k,t)e^(ikx) dk\n\nT(x,t) = 40 + (10/π) ∑[(-1)^n * e^(-α(πn/L)²t) * sin(πnx/L)]\n\nwhere the summation is over all integer values of n.\n\nThis equation gives the temperature distribution at any point along the rod at any time t."
