    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, men affected by the disease) in n trials (the sample size of 100 men)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the prevalence rate of 20% or 0.2)\n- n is the sample size (100 men)\n- k is the number of successes (at least 30 men affected by the disease)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 30 men being affected, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 30, 31, ..., 100.\n\nP(X ≥ 30) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 30 to 100\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so we can use a complementary probability approach to make it easier:\n\nP(X ≥ 30) = 1 - P(X < 30) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 29\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 29 and subtract it from 1 to get the probability of at least 30 men being affected by the disease.\n\nUsing a calculator or software that can handle binomial probability calculations, we find:\n\nP(X ≥ 30) ≈ 1 - 0.949 = 0.051\n\nSo, the probability that at least 30 out of 100 men aged 30-40 will be affected by the disease with a prevalence rate of 20% is approximately 5.1%."
