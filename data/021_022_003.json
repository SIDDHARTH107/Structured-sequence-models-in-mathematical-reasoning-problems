    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is based on the flashing behavior of fireflies. However, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute algorithms like the firefly algorithm directly. Instead, I can provide you with a general outline of how to use the firefly algorithm to solve this problem.\n\n1. Initialize a population of fireflies with random positions (x values) within the given range [0, 10].\n\n2. Define the attractiveness and brightness of each firefly based on the value of the function f(x) at their current position. A higher value of f(x) corresponds to higher brightness and attractiveness.\n\n3. Set the parameters for the algorithm, such as the number of iterations, the absorption coefficient (gamma), and the attractiveness coefficient (beta).\n\n4. For each iteration:\n\n   a. Sort the fireflies based on their brightness.\n   \n   b. Update the position of each firefly by moving it towards the brighter fireflies using the following formula:\n   \n      x_new = x_old + beta * (x_bright - x_old) + gamma * random_noise\n      \n      where x_old is the current position, x_bright is the position of a brighter firefly, and random_noise is a random number between -1 and 1.\n      \n   c. Ensure that the new positions are within the given range [0, 10].\n   \n   d. Update the brightness and attractiveness of each firefly based on their new positions.\n   \n5. After the specified number of iterations, the firefly with the highest brightness will have the optimal x value that maximizes the function f(x).\n\nPlease note that this is a general outline, and you would need to implement the firefly algorithm in a programming language like Python or MATLAB to solve the problem numerically."
