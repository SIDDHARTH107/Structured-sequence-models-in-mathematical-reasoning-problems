    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^5 + 2x^3 - x^2 + 7 using the power rule, we will differentiate each term with respect to x.\n\nThe power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\n1. For the term 3x^5, n = 5, so the derivative is (5)(3)x^(5-1) = 15x^4.\n2. For the term 2x^3, n = 3, so the derivative is (3)(2)x^(3-1) = 6x^2.\n3. For the term -x^2, n = 2, so the derivative is (2)(-1)x^(2-1) = -2x.\n4. For the constant term 7, the derivative is 0, since the derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 15x^4 + 6x^2 - 2x."
