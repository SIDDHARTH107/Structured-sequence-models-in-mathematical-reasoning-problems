    "message_1": "In a certain neighborhood, the probability of a burglary occurring in any given day is 0.2. What is the probability that there will be at least one burglary in the neighborhood during a five-day period?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one burglary occurring in a five-day period, we can first find the probability of no burglaries occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no burglary occurring on a single day is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nFor no burglaries to occur in a five-day period, this has to happen on each of the five days. The probability of this happening is:\n\n0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.8^5 = 0.32768\n\nNow, we'll find the probability of at least one burglary occurring by subtracting the probability of no burglaries from 1:\n\n1 - 0.32768 = 0.67232\n\nSo, the probability of at least one burglary occurring in the neighborhood during a five-day period is approximately 0.672 or 67.23%."
