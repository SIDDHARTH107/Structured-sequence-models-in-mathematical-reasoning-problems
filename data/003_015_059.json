    "message_1": "A Ferris wheel has a diameter of 60 meters and it rotates once in 40 seconds. If a passenger gets on at the bottom of the wheel and ride to the top, how long will it take to make one complete cycle, and what is the amplitude of the passenger's height above the ground? (Assume the Ferris wheel is at the ground level when the passenger gets on.)",
    "message_2": "Since the Ferris wheel rotates once in 40 seconds, it takes 40 seconds for a passenger to make one complete cycle.\n\nThe amplitude of the passenger's height above the ground is half the diameter of the Ferris wheel, which is the radius. The diameter is 60 meters, so the amplitude (radius) is 30 meters."
