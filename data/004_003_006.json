    "message_1": "A farmer wants to build a rectangular pen for his animals along the side of his barn. He has 200 feet of fencing material and wants the pen to have the largest possible area. What should be the dimensions of the rectangular pen?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the pen be x feet and the width be y feet. Since the pen is built along the side of the barn, only three sides need fencing. Therefore, the total fencing material used will be x + 2y = 200 feet.\n\nWe need to maximize the area of the rectangular pen, which is given by A = xy.\n\nFrom the fencing material equation, we can express y in terms of x:\ny = (200 - x)/2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the area equation:\nA(x) = x((200 - x)/2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\nA(x) = 100x - (1/2)x^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A(x) with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\ndA/dx = 100 - x = 0\n\nSolve for x:\nx = 100\n\nNow, substitute x back into the equation for y:\ny = (200 - 100)/2\ny = 50\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular pen that will give the largest possible area are 100 feet in length and 50 feet in width. The maximum area is 100 * 50 = 5000 square feet."
