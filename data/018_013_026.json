    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A x B. A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, A x B = {(1,3), (2,3)}.\n\nNow, let's find the sets (A x B) ∪ {(1,3)} and {(1,3)} ∪ (A x B x B).\n\n1. (A x B) ∪ {(1,3)}:\nSince A x B = {(1,3), (2,3)}, the union of A x B and {(1,3)} is the set of all elements that are in A x B or in {(1,3)}. Thus, (A x B) ∪ {(1,3)} = {(1,3), (2,3)}.\n\n2. {(1,3)} ∪ (A x B x B):\nFirst, we need to find the Cartesian product A x B x B. This is the set of all ordered triples (a, b, c) where a ∈ A, b ∈ B, and c ∈ B. Since B has only one element, 3, A x B x B = {(1,3,3), (2,3,3)}.\n\nNow, the union of {(1,3)} and (A x B x B) is the set of all elements that are in {(1,3)} or in A x B x B. However, we cannot directly take the union of these two sets, as they contain elements of different types: ordered pairs in {(1,3)} and ordered triples in A x B x B. Therefore, we cannot find the union of these two sets, and the expression {(1,3)} ∪ (A x B x B) is not well-defined.\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets (A x B) ∪ {(1,3)} and {(1,3)} ∪ (A x B x B). The first set is well-defined and contains ordered pairs, while the second expression is not well-defined, as it attempts to take the union of sets with different types of elements. Therefore, the two sets are not equal.\n\nThis shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union, as the union operation requires the sets to have the same type of elements, and the Cartesian product can produce sets with different types of elements (e.g., ordered pairs and ordered triples)."
