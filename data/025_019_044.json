    "message_2": "The degree of a Fano variety X is defined as the intersection number of the anticanonical divisor -K_X with itself three times, i.e., deg(X) = (-K_X)^3.\n\nWe are given that L^3 = 8 and K_X . L^2 = 4. We want to find the relationship between L and -K_X. Since X is a Fano variety, we know that -K_X is an ample divisor, which means there exists a positive integer n such that L = n(-K_X).\n\nNow, we can use the given information to find n:\n\nL^3 = (n(-K_X))^3 = n^3(-K_X)^3.\n\nWe are given L^3 = 8, so:\n\n8 = n^3(-K_X)^3.\n\nWe are also given K_X . L^2 = 4, so:\n\n4 = K_X . (n(-K_X))^2 = n^2 K_X . (-K_X)^2.\n\nNow, we can use these equations to find the degree of X:\n\ndeg(X) = (-K_X)^3.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n\n(-K_X)^3 = 8/n^3.\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n\nn^2 K_X . (-K_X)^2 = 4.\n\nSince K_X = -n(-K_X), we can substitute:\n\nn^2(-n(-K_X)) . (-K_X)^2 = 4.\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nn^3(-K_X)^3 = 4.\n\nNow, we can use this equation to find the degree of X:\n\ndeg(X) = (-K_X)^3 = 8/n^3.\n\nSince we found that n^3(-K_X)^3 = 4, we can substitute:\n\ndeg(X) = 8/(4/(-K_X)^3) = 2(-K_X)^3.\n\nThus, the degree of the Fano variety X is 2(-K_X)^3."
