    "message_2": "An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices are adjacent. To find the maximum number of vertices in an independent set of G, we can use a greedy algorithm.\n\n1. Start with an empty set S.\n2. Add a vertex with the minimum degree to S.\n3. Remove the added vertex and its neighbors from the graph.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the graph is empty.\n\nFollowing this algorithm:\n\n1. S = {}\n2. Add vertex G (minimum degree) to S: S = {G}\n3. Remove G and its neighbors (none) from the graph: Vertex set = {A, B, C, D, E, F}, Edge set = {(A,B), (A,C), (B,C), (B,D), (C,E), (D,E), (E,F)}\n4. Add vertex A (minimum degree) to S: S = {G, A}\n5. Remove A and its neighbors (B, C) from the graph: Vertex set = {D, E, F}, Edge set = {(D,E), (E,F)}\n6. Add vertex D (minimum degree) to S: S = {G, A, D}\n7. Remove D and its neighbors (E) from the graph: Vertex set = {F}, Edge set = {}\n8. Add vertex F (minimum degree) to S: S = {G, A, D, F}\n9. Remove F and its neighbors (none) from the graph: Vertex set = {}, Edge set = {}\n\nThe graph is now empty, and the maximum independent set is S = {G, A, D, F} with 4 vertices."
