    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (x!(n-x)!)) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (in this case, 20 customers preferring brand A)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 50 customers)\n- x is the number of successes (in this case, 20 customers preferring brand A)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.6 for brand A)\n- q is the probability of failure (in this case, 1 - p = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4)\n- ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(20) = (50! / (20!(50-20)!)) * (0.6^20) * (0.4^30)\n\nTo calculate the factorials, we can use a calculator or a software tool:\n\n50! = 3.04140932 × 10^64\n20! = 2.43290201 × 10^18\n30! = 2.65252860 × 10^32\n\nNow, we can divide the factorials:\n\n(50! / (20! * 30!)) = 4.72528776 × 10^14\n\nNext, we calculate the probabilities:\n\n(0.6^20) = 3.65615844 × 10^-6\n(0.4^30) = 1.15292150 × 10^-9\n\nFinally, we multiply everything together:\n\nP(20) = (4.72528776 × 10^14) * (3.65615844 × 10^-6) * (1.15292150 × 10^-9)\nP(20) ≈ 0.00198\n\nSo the probability that exactly 20 customers prefer brand A is approximately 0.00198 or 0.198%."
