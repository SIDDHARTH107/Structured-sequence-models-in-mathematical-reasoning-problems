    "message_1": "What is the probability that a burglary occurs at least once in a particular neighborhood in a month, given that the average monthly frequency of burglaries in the neighborhood is 2 with a standard deviation of 0.5?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, burglaries) occurring in a fixed interval of time (a month) given a constant average rate (2 burglaries per month).\n\nLet X be the number of burglaries in a month. X follows a Poisson distribution with parameter λ = 2 (the average number of burglaries per month).\n\nThe probability that a burglary occurs at least once in a month is the complement of the probability that no burglaries occur in that month. In other words:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\n\nTo find P(X = 0), we can use the formula for the Poisson distribution:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nFor k = 0:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-2) * 2^0) / 0! = e^(-2)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one burglary:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e^(-2) ≈ 0.8647\n\nSo, the probability that a burglary occurs at least once in a particular neighborhood in a month is approximately 86.47%."
