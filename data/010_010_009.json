    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x, y), we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∇f(x, y) = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y)\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x - 8x^3 - 8xy^2\n∂f/∂y = 2y - 8x^2y - 4y^3\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n2x - 8x^3 - 8xy^2 = 0\n2y - 8x^2y - 4y^3 = 0\n\nWe can factor out common terms:\n\n2x(1 - 4x^2 - 4y^2) = 0\n2y(1 - 4x^2 - 2y^2) = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we have two cases:\n\n1) 2x = 0 => x = 0\n2) 1 - 4x^2 - 4y^2 = 0 => 4x^2 + 4y^2 = 1\n\nFrom the second equation, we have two cases:\n\n1) 2y = 0 => y = 0\n2) 1 - 4x^2 - 2y^2 = 0 => 4x^2 + 2y^2 = 1\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible combinations:\n\n1) x = 0, y = 0\nThis gives us the critical point (0, 0).\n\n2) x = 0, 4x^2 + 2y^2 = 1\nSince x = 0, this equation becomes 2y^2 = 1, which gives y = ±1/sqrt(2). This gives us two critical points: (0, 1/sqrt(2)) and (0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\n3) y = 0, 4x^2 + 4y^2 = 1\nSince y = 0, this equation becomes 4x^2 = 1, which gives x = ±1/2. This gives us two critical points: (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0).\n\nNow, let's compute the Hessian matrix to determine the index of the critical points:\n\nH(x, y) = | ∂²f/∂x²  ∂²f/∂x∂y |\n          | ∂²f/∂y∂x  ∂²f/∂y² |\n\n∂²f/∂x² = 2 - 24x^2 - 8y^2\n∂²f/∂x∂y = -16xy\n∂²f/∂y∂x = -16xy\n∂²f/∂y² = 2 - 8x^2 - 12y^2\n\nH(x, y) = | 2 - 24x^2 - 8y^2  -16xy |\n          | -16xy            2 - 8x^2 - 12y^2 |\n\nNow, let's evaluate the Hessian matrix at each critical point and compute the determinant:\n\n1) (0, 0)\nH(0, 0) = |  2  0 |\n          |  0  2 |\n\ndet(H(0, 0)) = 4 > 0\n\nSince both eigenvalues are positive, the index of the critical point (0, 0) is 0.\n\n2) (0, ±1/sqrt(2))\nH(0, ±1/sqrt(2)) = |  2  0 |\n                   |  0 -1 |\n\ndet(H(0, ±1/sqrt(2))) = -2 < 0\n\nSince one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, the index of the critical points (0, 1/sqrt(2)) and (0, -1/sqrt(2)) is 1.\n\n3) (±1/2, 0)\nH(±1/2, 0) = | -1  0 |\n             |  0  1 |\n\ndet(H(±1/2, 0)) = -1 < 0\n\nSince one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, the index of the critical points (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0) is 1.\n\nIn summary, we have the following critical points and their indices:\n\n(0, 0) - Index 0\n(0, 1/sqrt(2)) - Index 1\n(0, -1/sqrt(2)) - Index 1\n(1/2, 0) - Index 1\n(-1/2, 0) - Index 1"
