    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron or Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. After each iteration, the number of tetrahedra increases, and the number of faces also increases.\n\nLet's analyze the number of faces added at each iteration:\n\n1. At the initial stage (n=0), there are 5 faces (4 from the tetrahedron and 1 base face).\n2. After the first iteration (n=1), we have 4 smaller tetrahedra, each with 4 faces. However, 6 faces are shared between these tetrahedra (forming the inner tetrahedron), so we have 4 * 4 - 6 = 10 new faces. The total number of faces is now 5 + 10 = 15.\n3. After the second iteration (n=2), each of the 4 smaller tetrahedra is replaced by 4 new smaller tetrahedra, resulting in 4 * 4 = 16 new tetrahedra. Each of these new tetrahedra has 4 faces, but there are 3 shared faces between every 4 tetrahedra, so we have 16 * 4 - 3 * 4 = 52 new faces. The total number of faces is now 15 + 52 = 67.\n\nFrom this pattern, we can derive a formula for the total number of faces after n iterations:\n\nTotal_faces(n) = Initial_faces + (4^n - 3^n)\n\nwhere Initial_faces is the number of faces in the initial pyramid (5 in this case).\n\nSo, the total number of faces in the construction of a Sierpinski pyramid after n iterations is:\n\nTotal_faces(n) = 5 + (4^n - 3^n)"
