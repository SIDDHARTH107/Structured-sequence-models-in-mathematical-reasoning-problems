    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution formula, which is used to calculate the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of x events occurring\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of events occurring in the given interval\n- x is the number of events we want to find the probability for\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nIn this case, we are given that the neighborhood experiences 5 burglaries per month on average. We want to find the probability of at least one burglary occurring within a week.\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of burglaries per week. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can divide the monthly average by 4:\n\nλ = 5 burglaries/month * (1 month / 4 weeks) = 1.25 burglaries/week\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least one burglary occurring within a week. To do this, we can find the probability of no burglaries occurring and then subtract that from 1:\n\nP(0) = (e^(-1.25) * 1.25^0) / 0! = e^(-1.25) * 1 / 1 = e^(-1.25)\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one burglary:\n\nP(at least 1) = 1 - P(0) = 1 - e^(-1.25) ≈ 1 - 0.2865 ≈ 0.7135\n\nSo, the probability of a burglary occurring in the neighborhood within a week is approximately 0.7135 or 71.35%."
