    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 flips of a fair coin, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (k!(n-k)!)) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of getting exactly x successes (in this case, heads)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100 coin flips)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 50 heads)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.5 for heads)\n- q is the probability of failure (in this case, 0.5 for tails)\n- ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nPlugging in the values for our problem:\n\nP(50) = (100! / (50! * 50!)) * (0.5^50) * (0.5^50)\n\nFirst, we can calculate the binomial coefficient (100! / (50! * 50!)). Using a calculator or software, we find that this is equal to 100,891,344,545,564.\n\nNext, we can calculate (0.5^50) * (0.5^50), which is equal to (0.5^100) = 7.888609052210118e-31.\n\nNow, we can multiply the binomial coefficient by the probability:\n\nP(50) = 100,891,344,545,564 * 7.888609052210118e-31 â‰ˆ 0.0795892\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 flips of a fair coin is approximately 0.0796, or 7.96%."
