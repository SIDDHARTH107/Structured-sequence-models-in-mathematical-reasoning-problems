    "message_2": "Let's first understand the problem. We have a connected undirected graph with 10 vertices, and each vertex has a degree of 3 (i.e., connected to 3 other vertices). We need to find the diameter of the graph, which is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph.\n\nSince each vertex has a degree of 3, the total number of edges in the graph is (10 * 3) / 2 = 15, as each edge is counted twice (once for each vertex it connects).\n\nNow, let's use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In our case, the sum of the degrees is 10 * 3 = 30, and twice the number of edges is 2 * 15 = 30. So, the Handshaking Lemma holds true for our graph.\n\nTo find the diameter of the graph, let's consider the following possibilities:\n\n1. If the graph is a tree (i.e., no cycles), then it must have 9 edges (since a tree with n vertices has n-1 edges). But our graph has 15 edges, so it cannot be a tree.\n\n2. If the graph has a cycle, then it must have at least one cycle of length 3 (a triangle), because each vertex has a degree of 3. Let's consider a triangle formed by vertices A, B, and C. Since the graph is connected, all other vertices must be connected to at least one of these three vertices.\n\nNow, let's analyze the remaining 7 vertices. Each of the vertices A, B, and C has 2 more edges to connect to other vertices. So, they can connect to at most 6 other vertices. But we have 7 remaining vertices, so at least one of these vertices must be connected to two vertices from the triangle (let's say vertex D is connected to both A and B).\n\nIn this case, the longest shortest path in the graph is between vertex C and vertex D, which is 2 (C -> A -> D or C -> B -> D). Therefore, the diameter of the graph is 2."
