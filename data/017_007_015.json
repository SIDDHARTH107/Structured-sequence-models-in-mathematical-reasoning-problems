    "message_2": "Let's first recall some definitions and properties:\n\n1. The order of an element a in a group G is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where e is the identity element of G.\n2. The dihedral group D3 is a group of order 6, consisting of the symmetries of an equilateral triangle, including rotations and reflections.\n3. A group G is isomorphic to another group H if there exists a bijective function f: G -> H such that f(ab) = f(a)f(b) for all a, b in G.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the problem:\n\nSince the order of G is 6, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6. We are given that the order of a is not 1 or 6, so it must be either 2 or 3.\n\nCase 1: The order of a is 2.\nLet's assume there is another element b in G such that the order of b is 3. Then, we have a^2 = e and b^3 = e. Consider the element ab. We have:\n\n(ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = eb^2 = b^2,\n(ab)^3 = a^3b^3 = a^2b^2b = b^2b = b^3 = e.\n\nSince (ab)^2 ≠ e and (ab)^3 = e, the order of ab is 3. Now, we have three distinct elements a, b, and ab with orders 2, 3, and 3, respectively. Since G has 6 elements and the identity element e is also in G, there are only two more elements left in G. Let's denote them as x and y.\n\nNow, let's consider the elements a, b, ab, x, and y. We can create a multiplication table for these elements, similar to the dihedral group D3. We can see that G has the same structure as D3, and thus, G is isomorphic to D3.\n\nCase 2: The order of a is 3.\nIn this case, we have a^3 = e. Let's assume there is another element b in G such that the order of b is 2. Then, we have b^2 = e. Consider the element ab. We have:\n\n(ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = a^2e = a^2,\n(ab)^3 = a^3b^3 = e^2 = e.\n\nSince (ab)^2 ≠ e and (ab)^3 = e, the order of ab is 3. Now, we have three distinct elements a, b, and ab with orders 3, 2, and 3, respectively. Since G has 6 elements and the identity element e is also in G, there are only two more elements left in G. Let's denote them as x and y.\n\nNow, let's consider the elements a, b, ab, x, and y. We can create a multiplication table for these elements, similar to the dihedral group D3. We can see that G has the same structure as D3, and thus, G is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3."
