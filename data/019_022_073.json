    "message_1": "Suppose you are playing a game where you are offered a prize of $100 or two random prizes, one of $150 and the other of $50. The probability of winning the $150 prize is 3/4 and the probability of winning the $50 prize is 1/4. Using the expected value, should you choose the single prize of $100 or take your chances with the two random prizes?",
    "message_2": "To determine which option is better, we need to calculate the expected value of each option.\n\nOption 1: Single prize of $100\nThe expected value of this option is simply the value of the prize, which is $100.\n\nOption 2: Two random prizes ($150 with probability 3/4, and $50 with probability 1/4)\nTo calculate the expected value, we multiply the value of each prize by its probability and then sum the results.\n\nExpected value = (3/4 * $150) + (1/4 * $50)\n\nExpected value = ($112.50) + ($12.50)\n\nExpected value = $125\n\nComparing the expected values, we see that the expected value of Option 2 ($125) is greater than the expected value of Option 1 ($100). Therefore, it would be better to take your chances with the two random prizes."
