    "message_2": "In a right triangle, the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle can be found using the ratios of the sides of the triangle. Since we have a 30-degree angle in a right triangle, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle to find the side ratios.\n\nA 30-60-90 triangle has side lengths in the ratio of 1:√3:2, where the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 1, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is √3, and the hypotenuse is 2.\n\nNow, we can find the sine, cosine, and tangent of the 30-degree angle using the side ratios:\n\n1. Sine (sin) of 30 degrees:\nsin(30) = opposite side / hypotenuse = 1 / 2\n\n2. Cosine (cos) of 30 degrees:\ncos(30) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = √3 / 2\n\n3. Tangent (tan) of 30 degrees:\ntan(30) = opposite side / adjacent side = 1 / √3\n\nSo, the sine of the 30-degree angle is 1/2, the cosine is √3/2, and the tangent is 1/√3."
