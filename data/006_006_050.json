    "message_2": "To calculate the expected payout, we need to know the odds being offered for Team A winning. Let's assume the odds are given as \"x\" to 1. This means if you bet $50 on Team A and they win, you would receive $50 * x in winnings, plus your original $50 bet.\n\nThe expected payout can be calculated using the formula:\n\nExpected Payout = (Probability of Winning) * (Potential Payout)\n\nIn this case, the probability of winning is 0.6, and the potential payout is $50 * x + $50 (winnings plus original bet). So the expected payout would be:\n\nExpected Payout = 0.6 * ($50 * x + $50)\n\nHowever, without knowing the odds \"x,\" we cannot provide a specific expected payout value."
