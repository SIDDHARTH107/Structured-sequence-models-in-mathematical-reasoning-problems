Use the median height of the 20 known trees and the following heights to estimate the height of the missing tree using interpolation. \n\n21, 24, 30, 31, 35, 35, 37, 39, 40, 40, 42, 44, 46, 49, 52, 56, 58, 61, 63, and x (missing height). \n\nWhat is the estimated height of the missing tree?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the median height of the 19 known trees. To do this, we need to arrange the heights in ascending order, which is already done. Since there are 19 known trees, the median will be the height of the 10th tree.\n\nThe median height is 40.\n\nNow, let's use interpolation to estimate the height of the missing tree. Since the median height is 40, we can assume that the missing height is close to this value. We can look at the heights immediately before and after the median to get a better idea of the range in which the missing height might fall.\n\nThe heights immediately before and after the median are 39 and 42. We can take the average of these two heights to estimate the missing height:\n\n(39 + 42) / 2 = 81 / 2 = 40.5\n\nSo, the estimated height of the missing tree is 40.5."
