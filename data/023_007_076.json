    "message_2": "The Fourier series of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = a0/2 + Σ[an*cos(nωx) + bn*sin(nωx)]\n\nwhere ω is the fundamental angular frequency, an and bn are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is from n=1 to infinity.\n\nFor the given function f(x) = 2cos(3x) + 4sin(5x), we can see that it already has the form of a Fourier series with only two terms. Therefore, we can directly read off the Fourier coefficients and the fundamental angular frequency:\n\na3 = 2, b5 = 4, and all other an and bn coefficients are 0.\n\nThe fundamental angular frequency ω is determined by the smallest non-zero frequency present in the function. In this case, the smallest non-zero frequency is 3 (from the cos(3x) term). Therefore, the fundamental angular frequency ω is 3.\n\nTo find the fundamental frequency, we use the relation:\n\nω = 2πf\n\nwhere f is the fundamental frequency. Solving for f, we get:\n\nf = ω / (2π) = 3 / (2π)\n\nSo, the fundamental frequency of the signal is:\n\nf = 3 / (2π) Hz"
