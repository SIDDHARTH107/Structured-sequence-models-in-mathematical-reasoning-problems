    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. In other words, it is the greatest distance between any pair of vertices.\n\nTo find the diameter of G, we need to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices and then determine the longest of these shortest paths.\n\nHere are the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in G:\n\n1-2: 1\n1-3: 2 (1-2-3)\n1-4: 2 (1-2-4)\n1-5: 3 (1-2-4-5)\n1-6: 4 (1-2-4-5-6)\n1-7: 4 (1-2-4-5-7)\n\n2-3: 1\n2-4: 1\n2-5: 2 (2-4-5)\n2-6: 3 (2-4-5-6)\n2-7: 3 (2-4-5-7)\n\n3-4: 1\n3-5: 2 (3-4-5)\n3-6: 3 (3-4-5-6)\n3-7: 3 (3-4-5-7)\n\n4-5: 1\n4-6: 2 (4-5-6)\n4-7: 2 (4-5-7)\n\n5-6: 1\n5-7: 1\n\nNow, we need to find the longest of these shortest paths. The longest shortest path is 4, which occurs between vertices 1 and 6, and vertices 1 and 7.\n\nTherefore, the diameter of G is 4."
