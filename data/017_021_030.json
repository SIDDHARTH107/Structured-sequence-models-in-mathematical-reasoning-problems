    "message_2": "To determine the possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups for a group of order 48, we first find the prime factorization of 48. We have 48 = 2^4 * 3^1.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 48, and let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G.\n\nBy the Sylow Theorems, we have the following:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3^1 = 3, and n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n\n2. n_3 divides 2^4 = 16, and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where n_2 = 3. In this case, there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, each of order 16. Let P_2 be one of these Sylow 2-subgroups. By the Sylow Theorems, the normalizer N(P_2) of P_2 in G has index n_2 = 3, so |N(P_2)| = 16.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. If n_3 = 4, then there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, each of order 3. Let P_3 be one of these Sylow 3-subgroups. By the Sylow Theorems, the normalizer N(P_3) of P_3 in G has index n_3 = 4, so |N(P_3)| = 12.\n\nSince |N(P_2)| = 16 and |N(P_3)| = 12, we have gcd(|N(P_2)|, |N(P_3)|) = 4. Therefore, there exists a subgroup H of G with order 4. Since H is a subgroup of both N(P_2) and N(P_3), it follows that H is normal in both N(P_2) and N(P_3).\n\nNow, consider the semidirect product of P_2 and P_3 with respect to H. Since H is normal in both N(P_2) and N(P_3), this semidirect product is well-defined and has order 48. Moreover, since P_2 and P_3 are both normal in G, their semidirect product is isomorphic to a subgroup of G.\n\nIf this subgroup is the entire group G, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is isomorphic to C48 (the cyclic group of order 48). Otherwise, G must contain a proper subgroup isomorphic to the semidirect product of P_2 and P_3. In this case, G is one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nIn conclusion, if a group of order 48 has 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, then it is isomorphic to either C48 or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48."
