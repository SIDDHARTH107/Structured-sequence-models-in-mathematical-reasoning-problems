    "message_1": "Assume that a risk-neutral agent has to make one of two decisions: effort (E) or no effort (NE). If effort is chosen, the probability of success is p = 0.6 and the reward is $100. If no effort is chosen, the probability of success is p = 0.2 and the reward is $30. The agent gets a utility of u(W) = sqrt(W), where W is the reward obtained. The principal knows the agent's type: whether the agent is of high productivity (best) with probability q = 0.5 or of low productivity (worst) with probability (1-q) = 0.5. If the agent is of high productivity, then the cost of effort is zero. If the agent is of low productivity, the cost of efforts is c = $20.\n \nIf effort is observable but productivity is not observable, what decision should the principal make and what will be the agent's expected utility?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best decision for the principal, we need to calculate the expected utility for the agent in each case (effort and no effort) and compare them.\n\n1. Effort (E):\nFor high productivity agents (probability q = 0.5), the cost of effort is zero. The expected utility is:\nu_high_E = 0.6 * sqrt(100) + 0.4 * sqrt(0) = 0.6 * 10 = 6\n\nFor low productivity agents (probability 1-q = 0.5), the cost of effort is $20. The expected utility is:\nu_low_E = 0.6 * sqrt(100 - 20) + 0.4 * sqrt(0 - 20) = 0.6 * sqrt(80) = 0.6 * 8.944 = 5.366\n\nThe overall expected utility for effort is:\nu_E = q * u_high_E + (1-q) * u_low_E = 0.5 * 6 + 0.5 * 5.366 = 3 + 2.683 = 5.683\n\n2. No Effort (NE):\nFor both high and low productivity agents, the cost of no effort is zero. The expected utility is the same for both types of agents:\nu_NE = 0.2 * sqrt(30) + 0.8 * sqrt(0) = 0.2 * 5.477 = 1.095\n\nComparing the expected utilities, we can see that the expected utility for effort (u_E = 5.683) is higher than the expected utility for no effort (u_NE = 1.095). Therefore, the principal should choose effort (E) as the decision.\n\nThe agent's expected utility in this case is 5.683."
