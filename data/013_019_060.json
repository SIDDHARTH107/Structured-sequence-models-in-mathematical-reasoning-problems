    "message_1": "A car salesman has two cars to sell: a red one and a blue one. A buyer is interested in purchasing the red car but is only willing to pay $10,000 for it. The salesman knows the true value of the red car is $12,000 and the true value of the blue car is $8,000. However, the buyer believes that both cars are equally valuable. If the salesman was to \"talk cheap\" and make a false statement about the value of the blue car, what minimum value should they claim for the blue car (in dollars) to convince the buyer to purchase the blue car instead of the red car?",
    "message_2": "To convince the buyer to purchase the blue car instead of the red car, the salesman should claim a value for the blue car that is higher than the buyer's willingness to pay for the red car, which is $10,000. The minimum value the salesman should claim for the blue car is $10,001. This would make the buyer believe that the blue car is a better deal compared to the red car, as they think it is worth more than what they are willing to pay for the red car."
