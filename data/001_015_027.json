    "message_2": "To solve for x in the equation 2^(3x+1) = 16, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation with the same base on both sides.\nSince 16 can be written as 2^4, the equation becomes:\n\n2^(3x+1) = 2^4\n\nStep 2: If the bases are equal, then the exponents must be equal.\nSo, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n3x + 1 = 4\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n3x = 3\n\nNow, divide by 3:\n\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution is x = 1."
