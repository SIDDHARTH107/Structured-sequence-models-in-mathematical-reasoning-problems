So, the union of set A and set B is:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the union of set A and set B is a superset of both set A and set B. By definition, a set S is a superset of another set T if every element of T is also an element of S.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of set A:\n\n1 ∈ A ∪ B (since 1 ∈ A)\n3 ∈ A ∪ B (since 3 ∈ A)\n5 ∈ A ∪ B (since 5 ∈ A)\n\nSince every element of set A is also an element of A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B is a superset of set A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of set B:\n\n2 ∈ A ∪ B (since 2 ∈ B)\n4 ∈ A ∪ B (since 4 ∈ B)\n\nSince every element of set B is also an element of A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B is a superset of set B.\n\nTherefore, the union of set A and set B, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, is a superset of both set A and set B."
