    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from the initial square. In each iteration, the square is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the middle square is removed. This process is repeated for the remaining 8 squares.\n\nFor a Sierpinski carpet of order 4, this process is repeated 4 times. The area of the remaining carpet can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = Initial Area * (8/9)^n\n\nwhere n is the order of the Sierpinski carpet.\n\nIn this case, the initial area is 9 square units, and the order is 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = 9 * (8/9)^4\n\nArea = 9 * (4096/6561)\n\nArea â‰ˆ 5.6027 square units\n\nSo, the area of a Sierpinski carpet of order 4 with an initial square of 9 square units is approximately 5.6027 square units."
