    "message_2": "In a game of tic-tac-toe, there are 9 cells on the board, and each cell can be filled with either an X, an O, or left empty. However, we are only considering games that end with a win or a tie, so we will not have any empty cells.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Player X goes first and has 9 choices for their first move.\n2. Player O goes next and has 8 choices left for their first move.\n3. Player X has 7 choices left for their second move.\n4. Player O has 6 choices left for their second move.\n5. Player X has 5 choices left for their third move.\n\nAt this point, it's possible for Player X to win the game. However, we need to consider all possible game outcomes, including those that continue beyond this point.\n\n6. If Player X hasn't won yet, Player O has 4 choices left for their third move.\n\nAt this point, it's possible for Player O to win the game. However, we need to consider all possible game outcomes, including those that continue beyond this point.\n\n7. If Player O hasn't won yet, Player X has 3 choices left for their fourth move.\n8. If Player X hasn't won yet, Player O has 2 choices left for their fourth move.\n\nAt this point, the game will either end in a tie or Player X will win with their final move.\n\n9. If the game hasn't ended yet, Player X has 1 choice left for their fifth move, which will result in a tie.\n\nSo, the total number of ways two players can play a game of tic-tac-toe until one player wins or the game ends in a tie is:\n\n9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 362,880\n\nHowever, this number includes games with redundant moves (i.e., games that continue after a player has already won). To account for this, we need to subtract the number of redundant games from the total.\n\nThere are 8 possible ways to win for each player (3 horizontal, 3 vertical, and 2 diagonal). Since there are 5! (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120) ways to arrange the remaining moves after a win, we have:\n\n8 (winning ways) × 2 (players) × 5! (remaining moves) = 1920 redundant games\n\nSo, the total number of non-redundant games is:\n\n362,880 - 1,920 = 360,960\n\nTherefore, there are 360,960 ways two players can play a game of tic-tac-toe until one player wins or the game ends in a tie."
