    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the given function f(x), we need to determine the coefficients a_n and b_n for the following general Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π to π] f(x) dx\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function (f(-x) = -f(x)), the integral of f(x) over a symmetric interval around the origin will be zero. Therefore, a_0 = 0.\n\nNow let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π to π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nAgain, since f(x) is an odd function and cos(n * x) is an even function, their product will be an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval around the origin will be zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π to π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts, one for the interval [-π, 0) and another for the interval [0, π):\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π to 0] (-1) * sin(n * x) dx + ∫[0 to π] (1) * sin(n * x) dx]\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n * cos(n * x)) | from -π to 0 + (1/n * cos(n * x)) | from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n * cos(0) + 1/n * cos(-n * π)) + (1/n * cos(n * π) - 1/n * cos(0))]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(2/n) * cos(n * π) - 2/n]\n\nFor odd values of n (n = 2k + 1), cos(n * π) = -1, and for even values of n (n = 2k), cos(n * π) = 1. Since a_n = 0 for all n, the Fourier series for f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [b_n * sin(n * x)] = Σ [(2/n) * (-1)^n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity, and n takes only odd integer values."
