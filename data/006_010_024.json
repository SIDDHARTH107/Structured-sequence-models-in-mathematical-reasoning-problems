    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x successes (affected individuals) in n trials (total individuals)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of choosing x successes from n trials, which is calculated as n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n- p is the probability of success (prevalence rate of the disease)\n- n is the total number of trials (total individuals)\n- x is the number of successes (affected individuals)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 1000 (total individuals)\n- x = 150 (affected individuals)\n- p = 0.12 (prevalence rate of the disease)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(150) = (1000C150) * (0.12^150) * (1-0.12)^(1000-150)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate 1000C150:\n\n1000C150 = 1000! / (150! * (1000-150)!)\n1000C150 ≈ 2.702882 * 10^227 (using a calculator or software to compute the large numbers)\n\nNext, we can calculate 0.12^150 and (1-0.12)^(1000-150):\n\n0.12^150 ≈ 1.22 * 10^-109\n(1-0.12)^(1000-150) ≈ 1.60 * 10^-20\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nP(150) ≈ (2.702882 * 10^227) * (1.22 * 10^-109) * (1.60 * 10^-20)\nP(150) ≈ 5.28 * 10^-2\n\nSo, the probability that out of a group of 1000 individuals, 150 are affected with the disease if the overall prevalence rate of the disease is 12% in the population is approximately 5.28%."
