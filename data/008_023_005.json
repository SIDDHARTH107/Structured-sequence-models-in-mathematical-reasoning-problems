    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with noisy data, we first need to find the solution to the original system of linear equations. We can do this using the Gaussian elimination method or any other method for solving systems of linear equations.\n\n1. Original system of linear equations:\n\nx + 2y - z = 5\n3x - 2y + 4z = 3\n2x + y + 3z = 14\n\n2. Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 3 times the first equation from the second equation and 2 times the first equation from the third equation to eliminate x from the second and third equations.\n\nSecond equation: (3x - 2y + 4z) - 3(x + 2y - z) = 3 - 3*5 => -5z = -12\nThird equation: (2x + y + 3z) - 2(x + 2y - z) = 14 - 2*5 => -3y + 5z = 4\n\nStep 2: Solve the second equation for z: -5z = -12 => z = 12/5 = 2.4\n\nStep 3: Substitute z back into the third equation to solve for y: -3y + 5(2.4) = 4 => -3y + 12 = 4 => -3y = -8 => y = 8/3 ≈ 2.67\n\nStep 4: Substitute y and z back into the first equation to solve for x: x + 2(2.67) - 2.4 = 5 => x + 5.34 - 2.4 = 5 => x = 5 - 2.94 => x ≈ 2.06\n\nSo, the solution to the original system of linear equations is approximately x ≈ 2.06, y ≈ 2.67, and z ≈ 2.4.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum error of 0.1 in the coefficients. Since the coefficients can have a maximum error of 0.1, the solution can also have a maximum error of 0.1. Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations with noisy data, rounded to two decimal places, is:\n\nx ≈ 2.06 ± 0.1\ny ≈ 2.67 ± 0.1\nz ≈ 2.4 ± 0.1"
