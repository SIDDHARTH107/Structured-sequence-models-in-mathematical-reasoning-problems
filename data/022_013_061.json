    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of |f(z)| for z in D, we can use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that if a function is analytic and non-constant on a domain D, then the maximum value of the modulus of the function is attained on the boundary of D.\n\nHowever, the problem statement does not provide any information about the domain D or its boundary. Therefore, it is not possible to find the maximum value of |f(z)| for z in D without more information about the domain."
