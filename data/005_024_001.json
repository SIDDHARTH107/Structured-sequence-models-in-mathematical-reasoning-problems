    "message_2": "To calculate the mean, median, mode, and range of the data, we will follow these steps:\n\nMean:\n1. Add up all the salaries.\n2. Divide the sum by the number of salaries.\n\nMedian:\n1. Arrange the salaries in ascending order (which is already done in this case).\n2. Find the middle value.\n\nMode:\n1. Identify the salary that appears most frequently.\n\nRange:\n1. Subtract the lowest salary from the highest salary.\n\nNow let's calculate each of these:\n\nMean:\n($40,000 + $45,000 + $50,000 + $55,000 + $60,000 + $65,000 + $70,000 + $75,000 + $80,000) / 9 = $540,000 / 9 = $60,000\n\nMedian:\nSince there are 9 salaries, the middle value is the 5th salary, which is $60,000.\n\nMode:\nAll the salaries are unique, so there is no mode in this dataset.\n\nRange:\n$80,000 - $40,000 = $40,000\n\nSo, the mean is $60,000, the median is $60,000, there is no mode, and the range is $40,000."
