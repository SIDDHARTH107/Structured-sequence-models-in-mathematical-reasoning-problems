The following table shows the probabilities that a customer switches to a different campaign the following week:\n\n|     | Campaign A | Campaign B | Campaign C |\n| --- | --------- | --------- | --------- |\n| A   | 0.6       | 0.3       | 0.1       |\n| B   | 0.2       | 0.5       | 0.3       |\n| C   | 0.1       | 0.4       | 0.5       |\n\nIf the business begins with 100 customers in each campaign, how many customers will be in each campaign after two weeks?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of customers in each campaign after two weeks, we need to apply the transition probabilities twice. First, let's find the number of customers in each campaign after one week.\n\nAfter one week:\nCampaign A: (100 * 0.6) + (100 * 0.2) + (100 * 0.1) = 60 + 20 + 10 = 90\nCampaign B: (100 * 0.3) + (100 * 0.5) + (100 * 0.4) = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120\nCampaign C: (100 * 0.1) + (100 * 0.3) + (100 * 0.5) = 10 + 30 + 50 = 90\n\nNow, we apply the transition probabilities again to find the number of customers in each campaign after two weeks.\n\nAfter two weeks:\nCampaign A: (90 * 0.6) + (120 * 0.2) + (90 * 0.1) = 54 + 24 + 9 = 87\nCampaign B: (90 * 0.3) + (120 * 0.5) + (90 * 0.4) = 27 + 60 + 36 = 123\nCampaign C: (90 * 0.1) + (120 * 0.3) + (90 * 0.5) = 9 + 36 + 45 = 90\n\nSo, after two weeks, there will be 87 customers in Campaign A, 123 customers in Campaign B, and 90 customers in Campaign C."
