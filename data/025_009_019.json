    "message_1": "In algebraic geometry, the moduli space of genus 2 algebraic curves $M_2$ has a dimension of 6. Let $C$ be a specific curve in $M_2$ such that the span of the automorphism group $Aut(C)$ has dimension 3. Determine the dimension of the linear system $|\\mathcal{O}_C(2K_C)|$, where $K_C$ is the canonical divisor on $C$.",
    "message_2": "To determine the dimension of the linear system $|\\mathcal{O}_C(2K_C)|$, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. For a smooth curve $C$ of genus $g$ and a divisor $D$ on $C$, the Riemann-Roch theorem states that:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$.\n\nIn our case, we have $g = 2$, and we are interested in the divisor $D = 2K_C$. First, we need to compute the degree of $2K_C$. Since $K_C$ is the canonical divisor, we know that $\\deg(K_C) = 2g - 2 = 2$. Therefore, $\\deg(2K_C) = 4$.\n\nNow, we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\n$l(2K_C) - l(K_C - 2K_C) = \\deg(2K_C) + 1 - g = 4 + 1 - 2 = 3$.\n\nSince $K_C - 2K_C = -K_C$, we have $l(-K_C) = 0$ because the degree of $-K_C$ is negative. Therefore, we obtain:\n\n$l(2K_C) = 3$.\n\nHowever, we are given that the automorphism group $Aut(C)$ has dimension 3. The action of $Aut(C)$ on the linear system $|\\mathcal{O}_C(2K_C)|$ is linear, and since the dimension of $Aut(C)$ is equal to the dimension of $|\\mathcal{O}_C(2K_C)|$, the action is transitive. This means that the linear system has a base point, and we need to subtract 1 from the dimension to account for this.\n\nThus, the dimension of the linear system $|\\mathcal{O}_C(2K_C)|$ is $3 - 1 = \\boxed{2}$."
