    "message_1": "A company produces light bulbs and wants to estimate the proportion of defective bulbs in a large shipment of 10,000 bulbs. The company selects a random sample of 500 bulbs and finds that 20 of them are defective. Using Bayesian statistics, calculate the posterior probability that the proportion of defective bulbs in the entire shipment is between 0.02 and 0.025.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the posterior probability using Bayesian statistics, we need to define a prior distribution for the proportion of defective bulbs. Since we don't have any prior information, we can use a uniform prior distribution, which assumes that all proportions are equally likely. In this case, we can use a Beta distribution with parameters α=1 and β=1 as our prior, which is equivalent to a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.\n\nThe likelihood function for this problem is the binomial distribution, since we have a fixed number of trials (n=500) and a binary outcome (defective or not defective). The likelihood function is given by:\n\nL(p) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere p is the proportion of defective bulbs, n is the number of trials, k is the number of defective bulbs, and C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.\n\nIn our case, n=500 and k=20. The posterior distribution is proportional to the product of the prior distribution and the likelihood function:\n\nPosterior(p) ∝ Beta(1, 1) * L(p)\n\nSince the Beta distribution is a conjugate prior for the binomial likelihood, the posterior distribution is also a Beta distribution with updated parameters:\n\nPosterior(p) = Beta(α', β')\n\nwhere α' = α + k = 1 + 20 = 21 and β' = β + n - k = 1 + 500 - 20 = 481.\n\nNow, we want to calculate the probability that the proportion of defective bulbs is between 0.02 and 0.025. We can do this by calculating the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Beta distribution at these points and subtracting the lower CDF value from the upper CDF value:\n\nP(0.02 < p < 0.025) = CDF_Beta(0.025; 21, 481) - CDF_Beta(0.02; 21, 481)\n\nUsing a statistical software or calculator to find the CDF values:\n\nCDF_Beta(0.025; 21, 481) ≈ 0.9795\nCDF_Beta(0.02; 21, 481) ≈ 0.7351\n\nP(0.02 < p < 0.025) = 0.9795 - 0.7351 ≈ 0.2444\n\nSo, the posterior probability that the proportion of defective bulbs in the entire shipment is between 0.02 and 0.025 is approximately 24.44%."
