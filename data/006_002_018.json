    "message_1": "What is the probability of rolling a 3 on a standard dice?",
    "message_2": "A standard dice has 6 sides, each with an equal probability of being rolled. Since there is only one 3 on the dice, the probability of rolling a 3 is 1 out of 6, or 1/6. In decimal form, this is approximately 0.1667, or 16.67% chance."
