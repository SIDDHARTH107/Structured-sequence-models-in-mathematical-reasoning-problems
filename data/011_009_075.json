    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to partition a set of 6 elements into non-empty subsets, we can use the Bell number. The Bell number B(n) is the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets. \n\nFor n = 6, the Bell number B(6) is 203.\n\nSo, there are 203 ways to partition a set of 6 elements into non-empty subsets."
