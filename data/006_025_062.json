    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 5 clowns will successfully perform the trick, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of clowns)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of clowns successfully performing the trick)\n- p is the probability of success (0.6 in this case)\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 5 clowns successfully performing the trick, so we need to calculate the probabilities for 5, 6, 7, and 8 successful clowns and add them together.\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + P(X = 7) + P(X = 8)\n\nLet's calculate each probability:\n\n1. P(X = 5):\nC(8, 5) * 0.6^5 * 0.4^3 = 56 * 0.07776 * 0.064 = 0.3174\n\n2. P(X = 6):\nC(8, 6) * 0.6^6 * 0.4^2 = 28 * 0.046656 * 0.16 = 0.2119\n\n3. P(X = 7):\nC(8, 7) * 0.6^7 * 0.4^1 = 8 * 0.0279936 * 0.4 = 0.0896\n\n4. P(X = 8):\nC(8, 8) * 0.6^8 * 0.4^0 = 1 * 0.01679616 * 1 = 0.0168\n\nNow, let's add these probabilities together:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 0.3174 + 0.2119 + 0.0896 + 0.0168 = 0.6357\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 clowns will successfully perform the trick during today's performance is approximately 0.6357 or 63.57%."
