    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 36 is 2² * 3². \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3² = 9, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal. If n_2 = 9, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and we cannot guarantee that any of them are normal.\n\nNext, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2² = 4, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal. If n_3 = 4, there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and we cannot guarantee that any of them are normal.\n\nNow, we will consider the possible combinations of n_2 and n_3 values and analyze the resulting groups:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup. Their direct product forms a group of order 36, which is isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_9 (the direct product of two cyclic groups). This is the first non-isomorphic group of order 36.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4: In this case, there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup, but there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. The unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup is of order 4, so it is either isomorphic to Z_4 or Z_2 × Z_2. If it is isomorphic to Z_4, we get the group Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_3, which is the second non-isomorphic group of order 36. If it is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_2, we get the group (Z_2 × Z_2) × Z_3 × Z_3, which is the third non-isomorphic group of order 36.\n\n3. n_2 = 9, n_3 = 1: In this case, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and there is a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup. The unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup is of order 9, so it is isomorphic to Z_9. We get the group Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_9, which is the fourth non-isomorphic group of order 36.\n\n4. n_2 = 9, n_3 = 4: In this case, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. However, this case does not yield any new non-isomorphic groups.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 36:\n\n1. Z_4 × Z_9\n2. Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_3\n3. (Z_2 × Z_2) × Z_3 × Z_3\n4. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_9"
