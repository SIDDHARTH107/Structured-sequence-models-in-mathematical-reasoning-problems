    "message_1": "A digital image has dimensions of 512 x 512 pixels. Apply the two-dimensional Fourier transform to the image and compute the magnitude spectrum. What is the size of the resulting complex spectrum?",
    "message_2": "When you apply a two-dimensional Fourier transform to a digital image with dimensions of 512 x 512 pixels, the resulting complex spectrum will have the same dimensions as the original image. This is because the Fourier transform is a linear operation that maps the input image to a new representation in the frequency domain, but it does not change the size of the data.\n\nSo, the size of the resulting complex spectrum after applying the two-dimensional Fourier transform will also be 512 x 512."
