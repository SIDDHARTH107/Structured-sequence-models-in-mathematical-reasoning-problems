    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 5 cm and a slant height of 10 cm. What is the surface area of the cone, in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the area of the lateral surface (a sector of a larger circle). The formula for the surface area of a cone is given by:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base and l is the slant height.\n\nIn this case, r = 5 cm and l = 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = π(5)(5 + 10)\nSurface Area = π(5)(15)\nSurface Area = 75π\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the cone is 75π square centimeters, or approximately 235.62 square centimeters."
