    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are dependent and represent the same line in three-dimensional space. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions for this system of equations.\n\nHowever, we can still express the solutions in terms of a parameter. Let's solve for x and y in terms of z.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n2x + y - z = 5\n\nLet z = t (where t is a parameter), then:\n\ny = z + 2x - 5\ny = t + 2x - 5\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for y into the second equation:\n\n4x + 2y - 2z = 10\n\n4x + 2(t + 2x - 5) - 2t = 10\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n4x + 2t + 4x - 10 - 2t = 10\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n8x = 20\n\nDivide by 8:\n\nx = 20/8\nx = 5/2\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = t + 2(5/2) - 5\ny = t + 5 - 5\ny = t\n\nSo, the solutions for this system of linear equations can be expressed as:\n\nx = 5/2\ny = t\nz = t\n\nwhere t is any real number."
