    "message_2": "To solve the equation |2x + 5| - 3 = 10, we first isolate the absolute value expression by adding 3 to both sides of the equation:\n\n|2x + 5| = 13\n\nNow, we have two possible cases for the absolute value expression:\n\nCase 1: 2x + 5 = 13\nTo solve for x, we subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n2x = 8\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 4\n\nCase 2: 2x + 5 = -13\nTo solve for x, we subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n2x = -18\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = -9\n\nSo, the two possible values for x are 4 and -9."
