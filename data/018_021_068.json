Find the symmetric difference of A and B, and then find the intersection of the symmetric difference of A and B with the set {3, 4, 5}.

    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the symmetric difference of A and B with the set {3, 4, 5}.\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 6, 7} ∩ {3, 4, 5} = ∅ (the empty set)\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference of two sets A and B is distributive over their intersection.\n\nWe want to show that (A Δ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = (A ∩ B) Δ (B ∩ A).\n\nSince the symmetric difference is commutative, we can rewrite the right side as:\n\n(A ∩ B) Δ (A ∩ B)\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∩ B) with itself:\n\n(A ∩ B) Δ (A ∩ B) = (A ∩ B) - (A ∩ B) = ∅ (the empty set)\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the symmetric difference of A and B with their intersection:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = ({1, 2, 6, 7} ∪ {3, 4, 5}) - ({1, 2, 6, 7} ∩ {3, 4, 5}) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} - ∅ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, we have proven that the symmetric difference of two sets A and B is distributive over their intersection."
