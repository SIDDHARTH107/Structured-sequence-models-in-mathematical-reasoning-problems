    "message_2": "To find the rank of matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the matrix.\n\nMatrix A:\n\n 1 2 3 \n 2 4 6 \n 3 6 9 \n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n 1  2  3 \n 0  0  0 \n 0  0  0 \n\nThe row echelon form of matrix A has only one non-zero row. Therefore, the rank of matrix A is 1."
