    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 48 and their isomorphism classes, we first need to find the possible group structures. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3. We can use the Sylow theorems to determine the possible structures of the Sylow subgroups.\n\nFor the Sylow 2-subgroups, by the third Sylow theorem, the number of such subgroups must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. This means there can be either 1 or 3 Sylow 2-subgroups. If there is only 1 Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal, and the group is a semidirect product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. If there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, they may or may not be normal.\n\nFor the Sylow 3-subgroups, by the third Sylow theorem, the number of such subgroups must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. This means there can be either 1 or 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. If there is only 1 Sylow 3-subgroup, it is normal, and the group is a semidirect product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 2-subgroup. If there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, they may or may not be normal.\n\nNow we consider the possible structures of the Sylow subgroups themselves. The Sylow 2-subgroup has order 16, so it can be one of the following isomorphism classes: Z_16, Z_8 × Z_2, Z_4 × Z_4, or Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2. The Sylow 3-subgroup has order 3, so it is isomorphic to Z_3.\n\nWe can now analyze the possible semidirect products to find non-abelian groups:\n\n1. Z_16 ⋊ Z_3: This gives a non-abelian group of order 48.\n2. (Z_8 × Z_2) ⋊ Z_3: This gives a non-abelian group of order 48.\n3. (Z_4 × Z_4) ⋊ Z_3: This gives a non-abelian group of order 48.\n4. (Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2) ⋊ Z_3: This gives a non-abelian group of order 48.\n\nSo there are 4 non-abelian groups of order 48, and their isomorphism classes are:\n\n1. Z_16 ⋊ Z_3\n2. (Z_8 × Z_2) ⋊ Z_3\n3. (Z_4 × Z_4) ⋊ Z_3\n4. (Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2) ⋊ Z_3"
