    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone using integration, we first need to set up an equation for the radius of the cone as a function of its height. We can do this by using similar triangles. Let r be the radius of the cone at a height h, and R and H be the radius and height of the entire cone, respectively. Then we have:\n\nr / h = R / H\n\nGiven that R = 5 cm and H = 10 cm, we can write the equation for the radius as a function of height:\n\nr(h) = (5 / 10) * h = 1/2 * h\n\nNow, we can set up the integral to find the volume of the cone. The volume of a cone can be found by integrating the area of each infinitesimally small disk from the base to the tip of the cone. The area of each disk is given by the formula A(h) = π * r(h)^2. Substituting the equation for r(h) into the area formula, we get:\n\nA(h) = π * (1/2 * h)^2 = π * (1/4 * h^2)\n\nNow we can set up the integral for the volume:\n\nV = ∫[0, 10] A(h) dh = ∫[0, 10] (π * (1/4 * h^2)) dh\n\nTo solve the integral, we can use the power rule for integration:\n\nV = π * (1/4) * ∫[0, 10] h^2 dh = π * (1/4) * (1/3 * h^3) | [0, 10]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nV = π * (1/4) * (1/3 * (10^3 - 0^3)) = π * (1/4) * (1/3) * 1000 = (250/3)π\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is (250/3)π cubic centimeters."
