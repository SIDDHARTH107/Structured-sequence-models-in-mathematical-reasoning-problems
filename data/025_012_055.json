    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the elliptic curve at the point $(1, -1)$, we first need to find the derivative of the curve with respect to $x$. The equation of the curve is given by:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 - x + 1$\n\nWe can implicitly differentiate both sides with respect to $x$:\n\n$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - 1$\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3x^2 - 1}{2y}$\n\nAt the point $(1, -1)$, we can find the slope of the tangent line:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3(1)^2 - 1}{2(-1)} = \\frac{2}{-2} = -1$\n\nNow that we have the slope of the tangent line, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$\n\nPlugging in the point $(1, -1)$ and the slope $m = -1$, we get:\n\n$y - (-1) = -1(x - 1)$\n\nSimplifying, we get the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$y + 1 = -x + 1$\n\nOr\n\n$y = -x$"
