    "message_2": "To determine if a topological space X is connected or not, we need to check if there are any non-empty, disjoint open sets whose union is X. If such sets exist, then X is disconnected; otherwise, X is connected.\n\nIn our case, X = {1, 2, 3} and T = {∅, {1}, {2, 3}, X}. Let's consider the open sets in T and see if we can find any non-empty, disjoint open sets whose union is X.\n\n1. ∅ and {1}: These sets are disjoint, but their union is not X.\n2. ∅ and {2, 3}: These sets are disjoint, but their union is not X.\n3. {1} and {2, 3}: These sets are non-empty, disjoint, and their union is X.\n\nSince we found non-empty, disjoint open sets {1} and {2, 3} whose union is X, the topological space X is disconnected."
