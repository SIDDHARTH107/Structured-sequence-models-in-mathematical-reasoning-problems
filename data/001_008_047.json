    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x - 3 ≥ 5 - x, we first need to isolate x. \n\nStep 1: Add x to both sides of the inequality:\n2x - 3 + x ≥ 5 - x + x\n3x - 3 ≥ 5\n\nStep 2: Add 3 to both sides of the inequality:\n3x - 3 + 3 ≥ 5 + 3\n3x ≥ 8\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides by 3:\n3x/3 ≥ 8/3\nx ≥ 8/3\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is x ≥ 8/3.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line:\n\n1. Draw a number line and label it with numbers. Make sure to include 8/3 (approximately 2.67) on the number line.\n2. Place a closed circle (or a filled dot) on 8/3 to indicate that the value is included in the solution.\n3. Shade the region to the right of 8/3 to represent all values greater than or equal to 8/3.\n\nThe graph should look like this:\n\n<---(----[----)---->\n    0    8/3  3\n\nThe closed circle at 8/3 and the shaded region to the right of it represent the solution x ≥ 8/3."
