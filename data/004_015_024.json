    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 1, we need to find the points where the second derivative of the function changes its sign.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of the function, f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 1)\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 12x + 4\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative of the function, f''(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (6x^2 - 12x + 4)\nf''(x) = 12x - 12\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to find the values of x for which f''(x) = 0:\n\n12x - 12 = 0\n12(x - 1) = 0\nx = 1\n\nSo, there is an inflection point at x = 1. To find the corresponding y-value, we plug x = 1 back into the original function:\n\nf(1) = 2(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 4(1) + 1\nf(1) = 2 - 6 + 4 + 1\nf(1) = 1\n\nThus, the inflection point is (1, 1)."
