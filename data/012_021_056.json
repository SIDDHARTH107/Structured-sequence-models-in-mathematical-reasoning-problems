    "message_2": "The treewidth of a graph is the minimum width of a tree decomposition of the graph. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is associated with a subset of vertices of the graph, and the tree satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all subsets of vertices in the tree nodes is equal to the set of all vertices in the graph.\n2. For every edge in the graph, there exists a tree node whose associated vertex subset contains both endpoints of the edge.\n3. For any vertex v in the graph, the set of tree nodes whose associated vertex subsets contain v form a connected subtree.\n\nNow, let's find the treewidth of the given graph. We can decompose the graph into the following tree:\n\n```\n  A-B\n   |\n   C\n```\n\nHere, each node in the tree represents a subset of vertices from the graph:\n\n- Node A: {1, 2, 3}\n- Node B: {2, 3, 4}\n- Node C: {1, 3}\n\nThis tree decomposition satisfies all three conditions mentioned above. The width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest vertex subset associated with a tree node minus 1. In this case, the largest subset has 3 vertices, so the width is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the treewidth of the given graph is 2."
