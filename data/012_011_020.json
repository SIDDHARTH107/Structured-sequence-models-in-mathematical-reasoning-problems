    "message_1": "Consider the following undirected graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges:\n\n[Image of Graph]\n\n1. Identify all the cut-vertices in the graph.\n2. Identify all the bridges in the graph.\n3. If we remove the edges corresponding to all the identified bridges, how many connected components will the graph have?",
    "message_2": "Unfortunately, I cannot see the image of the graph you provided. However, I can explain the process to identify cut-vertices, bridges, and connected components after removing bridges.\n\n1. To identify cut-vertices in a graph, perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal and calculate the discovery time and low values for each vertex. A vertex is a cut-vertex if it satisfies one of the following conditions:\n   a. It is the root of the DFS tree and has at least two children.\n   b. It is not the root of the DFS tree and has a child v such that no vertex in the subtree rooted at v has a back edge to one of its ancestors.\n\n2. To identify bridges in a graph, perform a DFS traversal and calculate the discovery time and low values for each vertex. An edge (u, v) is a bridge if the low value of v is greater than the discovery time of u (low[v] > disc[u]).\n\n3. After identifying and removing all the bridges from the graph, the number of connected components can be found by performing another DFS traversal and counting the number of times the DFS starts a new traversal from an unvisited vertex.\n\nPlease provide the adjacency list or adjacency matrix of the graph, and I will help you identify the cut-vertices, bridges, and connected components after removing the bridges."
