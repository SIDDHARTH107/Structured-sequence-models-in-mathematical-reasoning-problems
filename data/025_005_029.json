    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^3 - y^2 = 0, we will compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^3 - y^2. Then the partial derivatives are:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2\n∂f/∂y = -2y\n\nNow we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n3x^2 = 0 => x = 0\n-2y = 0 => y = 0\n\nThe only point where both partial derivatives vanish is (0, 0). Now we need to classify this singularity as nodal, cuspidal, or hyperbolic.\n\nTo do this, we will compute the Hessian matrix of f, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives, and then compute its determinant:\n\nH(f) = | ∂²f/∂x²  ∂²f/∂x∂y |\n           | ∂²f/∂y∂x  ∂²f/∂y² |\n\n∂²f/∂x² = 6x\n∂²f/∂x∂y = 0\n∂²f/∂y∂x = 0\n∂²f/∂y² = -2\n\nH(f) = | 6x  0 |\n           |  0  -2 |\n\nNow we compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix:\n\ndet(H(f)) = (6x)(-2) - (0)(0) = -12x\n\nAt the singularity point (0, 0), the determinant of the Hessian matrix is:\n\ndet(H(0, 0)) = -12(0) = 0\n\nSince the determinant of the Hessian matrix is 0 at the singularity point, we cannot classify the singularity as nodal or hyperbolic. Therefore, the singularity at (0, 0) is cuspidal."
