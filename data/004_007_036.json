    "message_2": "To find the value of dy/dx, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if y is a function of u (y = f(u)) and u is a function of x (u = g(x)), then the derivative of y with respect to x is given by:\n\ndy/dx = (dy/du) * (du/dx)\n\nIn this case, let's define u as the inner function:\n\nu = 3x^2 + 1\n\nNow, y can be written as a function of u:\n\ny = u^4\n\nWe will now find the derivatives of y with respect to u (dy/du) and u with respect to x (du/dx).\n\n1) To find dy/du, we differentiate y = u^4 with respect to u:\n\ndy/du = 4u^3\n\n2) To find du/dx, we differentiate u = 3x^2 + 1 with respect to x:\n\ndu/dx = 6x\n\nNow, we can find dy/dx using the chain rule:\n\ndy/dx = (dy/du) * (du/dx) = 4u^3 * 6x\n\nWe know that x = √2, so we can find the value of u:\n\nu = 3(√2)^2 + 1 = 3(2) + 1 = 7\n\nNow, substitute the values of u and x into the expression for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = 4(7^3) * 6(√2) = 4(343) * 6(√2) = 1372 * 6(√2) = 8232(√2)\n\nSo, the value of dy/dx when x = √2 is 8232(√2)."
