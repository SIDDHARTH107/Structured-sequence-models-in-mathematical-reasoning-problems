    "message_2": "A rail fence cipher works by writing the message in a zigzag pattern along a set number of rails (in this case, 3 rails) and then reading the message off row by row. Here's how the message \"HELLO WORLD\" would be written using a rail fence cipher with a rail key of 3:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, read the message off row by row:\n\nHOLEWDLOR\n\nThe encrypted message using a rail fence cipher with a rail key of 3 is \"HOLEWDLOR\"."
