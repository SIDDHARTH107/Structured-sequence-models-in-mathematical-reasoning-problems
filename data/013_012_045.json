    "message_1": "Suppose there are two companies in a market, Company A and Company B. Company A is the leader and sets its quantity first, and Company B observes and sets its quantity second. The market demand function is Q = 100 - P. Company A's cost function is C1(Q1) = 2Q1, and Company B's cost function is C2(Q2) = 4Q2. What will be the profit-maximizing quantity and price for Company A and Company B in this Stackelberg competition?",
    "message_2": "To find the profit-maximizing quantity and price for Company A and Company B in this Stackelberg competition, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the inverse demand function (P as a function of Q).\n2. Calculate the reaction function for Company B.\n3. Find the profit function for Company A and maximize it.\n4. Calculate the profit-maximizing quantities and prices for both companies.\n\nStep 1: Inverse demand function\nThe market demand function is given as Q = 100 - P. We can rewrite this as the inverse demand function:\n\nP(Q) = 100 - Q\n\nStep 2: Reaction function for Company B\nCompany B's profit function is given by:\n\nπ2(Q2) = P(Q) * Q2 - C2(Q2) = (100 - Q) * Q2 - 4Q2\n\nwhere Q = Q1 + Q2.\n\nTo find Company B's reaction function, we need to maximize its profit function with respect to Q2. Taking the first-order derivative with respect to Q2 and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndπ2/dQ2 = (100 - Q) - Q2 - 4 = 0\n\nSubstituting Q = Q1 + Q2:\n\n100 - Q1 - 2Q2 - 4 = 0\n\nSolving for Q2:\n\nQ2 = (96 - Q1) / 2\n\nThis is Company B's reaction function.\n\nStep 3: Profit function for Company A and maximizing it\nCompany A's profit function is given by:\n\nπ1(Q1) = P(Q) * Q1 - C1(Q1) = (100 - Q) * Q1 - 2Q1\n\nSubstitute Company B's reaction function into the profit function:\n\nπ1(Q1) = (100 - (Q1 + (96 - Q1) / 2)) * Q1 - 2Q1\n\nSimplify the profit function:\n\nπ1(Q1) = (100 - Q1 - 48 + Q1/2) * Q1 - 2Q1\nπ1(Q1) = (52 - Q1/2) * Q1 - 2Q1\n\nTo maximize Company A's profit, take the first-order derivative with respect to Q1 and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπ1/dQ1 = (52 - Q1/2) - Q1 - 2 = 0\n\nSolving for Q1:\n\nQ1 = 32\n\nStep 4: Profit-maximizing quantities and prices for both companies\nNow that we have the profit-maximizing quantity for Company A, we can find the profit-maximizing quantity for Company B using its reaction function:\n\nQ2 = (96 - Q1) / 2\nQ2 = (96 - 32) / 2\nQ2 = 32\n\nThe total quantity in the market is:\n\nQ = Q1 + Q2 = 32 + 32 = 64\n\nUsing the inverse demand function, we can find the market price:\n\nP(Q) = 100 - Q = 100 - 64 = 36\n\nThus, the profit-maximizing quantity and price for Company A are Q1 = 32 and P = 36, and for Company B, they are Q2 = 32 and P = 36."
