    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. Let's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, and E, as shown below:\n\n```\nA -- B -- C\n|         |\nE -- D -- C\n```\n\nNow, let's consider the edge connecting vertices B and C. We will delete this edge and contract this edge separately and find the chromatic polynomial for each resulting graph.\n\n1. Deletion: Remove the edge BC.\n\n```\nA -- B    C\n|         |\nE -- D -- C\n```\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of this graph is P(G - e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\n2. Contraction: Merge vertices B and C into a single vertex, say X, and remove the edge BC.\n\n```\nA -- X\n|    |\nE -- D\n```\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of this graph is P(G / e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial of the original graph using the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) - k(k-1)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)[(k-3) - 1] = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-4).\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph is P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-4)."
