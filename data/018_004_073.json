    "message_1": "Let A be a set with 15 elements and B be the complement of A. If set C is also a complement of A, then how many elements does set C contain?",
    "message_2": "Since set C is also a complement of A, it means that set C contains all the elements that are not in set A. Since set B is also a complement of A, set C must have the same number of elements as set B. Therefore, set C contains the same number of elements as set B. However, without knowing the total number of elements in the universal set, we cannot determine the exact number of elements in set C."
