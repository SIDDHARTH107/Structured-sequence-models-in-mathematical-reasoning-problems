    "message_2": "Let the length of the garden parallel to the house be x meters and the width perpendicular to the house be y meters. Since one side of the garden is against the house wall, we only need to fence the other three sides. The total fencing material used is given by:\n\nx + 2y = 40\n\nWe want to maximize the area of the garden, which is given by:\n\nArea = x * y\n\nFirst, we need to express y in terms of x using the fencing material equation:\n\ny = (40 - x) / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the area equation:\n\nArea = x * ((40 - x) / 2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nArea = (40x - x^2) / 2\n\nTo maximize the area, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the area with respect to x and setting it to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dx = (40 - 2x) / 2\n\nSet the derivative to zero and solve for x:\n\n(40 - 2x) / 2 = 0\n40 - 2x = 0\n2x = 40\nx = 20\n\nNow, substitute the value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (40 - 20) / 2\ny = 20 / 2\ny = 10\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden that will maximize its area are 20 meters parallel to the house and 10 meters perpendicular to the house."
