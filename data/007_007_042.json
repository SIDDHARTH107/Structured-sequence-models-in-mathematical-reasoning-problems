    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions (x, y) for the Diophantine equation 3x + 5y = 31, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find one particular solution (x0, y0) that satisfies the equation.\n2. Use the general formula for Diophantine equations of the form ax + by = c to find all other solutions.\n\nStep 1: Find one particular solution (x0, y0)\n\nWe can start by finding one solution using trial and error or by using the extended Euclidean algorithm. In this case, trial and error works well:\n\n3x + 5y = 31\n3(3) + 5(4) = 9 + 20 = 31\n\nSo, one particular solution is (x0, y0) = (3, 4).\n\nStep 2: Use the general formula for Diophantine equations\n\nThe general formula for Diophantine equations of the form ax + by = c is:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is a particular solution, a and b are the coefficients of x and y in the equation (in this case, a = 3 and b = 5), d is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b (in this case, d = GCD(3, 5) = 1), and n is an integer.\n\nSince d = 1, the general formula for this problem simplifies to:\n\nx = x0 + 5n\ny = y0 - 3n\n\nSubstituting the particular solution (x0, y0) = (3, 4), we get:\n\nx = 3 + 5n\ny = 4 - 3n\n\nNow, we can find all integer solutions (x, y) by plugging in different integer values for n:\n\nn = 0: (x, y) = (3, 4)\nn = 1: (x, y) = (8, 1)\nn = -1: (x, y) = (-2, 7)\n\nThese are the only integer solutions for this Diophantine equation, as any other values of n will result in either x or y being negative. Therefore, the integer solutions for the equation 3x + 5y = 31 are:\n\n(x, y) = (3, 4), (8, 1), and (-2, 7)."
