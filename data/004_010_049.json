    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5, we will apply the power rule for integration, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately:\n\nAntiderivative of 3x^2:\n(3/3) * (x^(2+1))/(2+1) = x^3\n\nAntiderivative of 2x:\n(2/2) * (x^(1+1))/(1+1) = x^2\n\nAntiderivative of -5:\n-5 * (x^(0+1))/(0+1) = -5x\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nF(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 5x + C"
