    "message_1": "In a class of 25 students, 12 like to play basketball, 10 like to play football, and 8 like to play both basketball and football. Using inclusion-exclusion principle, how many students in the class do not like to play either basketball or football?",
    "message_2": "Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can find the number of students who like to play either basketball or football by adding the number of students who like each sport and then subtracting the number of students who like both sports.\n\nNumber of students who like basketball = 12\nNumber of students who like football = 10\nNumber of students who like both sports = 8\n\nNumber of students who like either basketball or football = (12 + 10) - 8 = 22 - 8 = 14\n\nNow, to find the number of students who do not like to play either basketball or football, we subtract the number of students who like either sport from the total number of students in the class.\n\nTotal number of students = 25\nNumber of students who like either basketball or football = 14\n\nNumber of students who do not like to play either basketball or football = 25 - 14 = 11\n\nSo, 11 students in the class do not like to play either basketball or football."
