    "message_2": "To solve the equation (3x + 1)/(2x - 3) = 5/4, we can start by cross-multiplying:\n\n(3x + 1) * 4 = (2x - 3) * 5\n\nNow, distribute the numbers:\n\n12x + 4 = 10x - 15\n\nNext, move all the terms with x to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side:\n\n12x - 10x = -15 - 4\n\n2x = -19\n\nFinally, divide by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx = -19/2"
