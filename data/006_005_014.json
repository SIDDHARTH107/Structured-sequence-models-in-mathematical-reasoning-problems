    "message_1": "A manufacturing plant produces light bulbs and the probability of a defective bulb is 0.05. If a customer buys a pack of 10 light bulbs, what is the probability that they get at least one defective bulb in the pack?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least one defective bulb in a pack of 10, we can first find the probability of getting no defective bulbs and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a bulb being non-defective is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nThe probability of all 10 bulbs being non-defective is (0.95)^10.\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least one defective bulb is 1 - (0.95)^10.\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\n1 - (0.95)^10 ≈ 1 - 0.5987369 ≈ 0.4012631\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting at least one defective bulb in a pack of 10 is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
