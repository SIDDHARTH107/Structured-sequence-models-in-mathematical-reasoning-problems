    "message_1": "A company is planning to produce two products, X and Y, and has a limited budget of $50,000 for production. The profit margin for each unit of X and Y are $60 and $90, respectively. However, due to uncertain market conditions, the profit margin could drop by 20% for either product. The company wants to determine the optimal number of units of each product to produce in order to maximize profit while ensuring that the production cost does not exceed the budget. How many units of each product should be produced under robust optimization?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for the profit margins of both products. Since the profit margin could drop by 20% for either product, we will calculate the reduced profit margins for both products.\n\nReduced profit margin for product X:\n$60 - (0.20 * $60) = $60 - $12 = $48\n\nReduced profit margin for product Y:\n$90 - (0.20 * $90) = $90 - $18 = $72\n\nNow, let's denote the number of units of product X as x and the number of units of product Y as y. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nTotal profit = $48x + $72y\n\nSubject to the constraint that the production cost does not exceed the budget:\n\nCost of producing x units of product X + Cost of producing y units of product Y ≤ $50,000\n\nLet's assume the production cost for each unit of product X is Cx and for product Y is Cy. Since we don't have the exact production costs, we can rewrite the constraint as:\n\nx * Cx + y * Cy ≤ $50,000\n\nTo find the optimal number of units of each product to produce, we can use linear programming techniques. However, without knowing the exact production costs (Cx and Cy), we cannot provide a specific solution for x and y.\n\nIn practice, the company would need to determine the production costs for each product and then use linear programming to find the optimal number of units of each product to produce under robust optimization."
