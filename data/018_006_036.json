Find the complement of set A and then find the union of set A and its complement. Prove that the union of set A and its complement is the same as the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', is:\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nComparing the elements of U and A, we can find the elements that are not in A:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nNow, we need to find the union of set A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements from both sets. \n\nA ∪ A' = {x ∈ U | x ∈ A or x ∈ A'}\n\nCombining the elements of A and A', we get:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's prove that the union of set A and its complement A' is the same as the universal set U. \n\nBy definition, the universal set U contains all the elements in the problem space. Since A and A' are subsets of U, their union should contain all the elements of U. \n\nComparing the elements of A ∪ A' and U, we can see that they are the same:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nSince A ∪ A' and U have the same elements, we can conclude that the union of set A and its complement A' is the same as the universal set U."
