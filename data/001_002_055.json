    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (1, 5) and (3, 9), we can use the slope-point form of a linear equation, which is:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is a point on the line and m is the slope of the line.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slope (m) of the line. The formula for the slope is:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points (1, 5) and (3, 9), we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nm = (9 - 5) / (3 - 1)\nm = 4 / 2\nm = 2\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use either of the given points to find the equation of the line. Let's use the point (1, 5). Plugging the values into the slope-point form:\n\ny - 5 = 2(x - 1)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\ny - 5 = 2x - 2\n\nAdd 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\ny = 2x + 3\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (1, 5) and (3, 9) is y = 2x + 3."
