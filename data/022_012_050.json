    "message_2": "To find the poles of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the function is not defined, i.e., when the denominator is zero. The sine function has zeros at integer multiples of π, so sin(πz) = 0 when z is an integer. Thus, the possible poles of f(z) are at z = ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the zeros of the numerator, as they may cancel out the poles in the denominator. The numerator z^2 - 1 has zeros at z = ±1. Since these zeros coincide with the zeros of the denominator, they will cancel out the poles at z = ±1. Therefore, the actual poles of f(z) are at z = ..., -2, 0, 2, ...\n\nNow, let's determine the order of the poles. The order of a pole is the number of times it appears as a root of the denominator. In our case, the denominator is sin(πz), and its zeros are simple zeros (i.e., they have multiplicity 1). Thus, the order of the poles of f(z) is 1.\n\nTo illustrate the locations of the poles on the complex plane, we can plot the real and imaginary parts of the complex number z. Since the poles are at integer values of z (excluding ±1), we can represent them as points on the real axis. The poles are located at ..., -2, 0, 2, ... on the complex plane.\n\nIn summary, f(z) has simple poles (order 1) at z = ..., -2, 0, 2, ... on the complex plane."
