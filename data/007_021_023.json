    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 26653 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) = (x^2 + 1) % n, where n is the number we want to factor (26653 in this case).\n2. Choose two initial values for x and y, usually x = y = 2.\n3. Iterate the function for x and y, updating x = f(x) and y = f(f(y)).\n4. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and n.\n5. If the GCD is 1, continue iterating. If the GCD is equal to n, restart with a different function or initial values. If the GCD is between 1 and n, we have found a non-trivial factor.\n\nLet's perform the algorithm:\n\n1. f(x) = (x^2 + 1) % 26653\n2. x = y = 2\n\nIteration 1:\n- x = f(x) = f(2) = (2^2 + 1) % 26653 = 5\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) % 26653 = 26\n- GCD(|5 - 26|, 26653) = GCD(21, 26653) = 1 (Continue iterating)\n\nIteration 2:\n- x = f(x) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) % 26653 = 26\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) % 26653 = 24212\n- GCD(|26 - 24212|, 26653) = GCD(24186, 26653) = 1 (Continue iterating)\n\nIteration 3:\n- x = f(x) = f(26) = (26^2 + 1) % 26653 = 677\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(24212)) = f(24186) = (24186^2 + 1) % 26653 = 14644\n- GCD(|677 - 14644|, 26653) = GCD(13967, 26653) = 97 (Found a non-trivial factor)\n\nThe smallest prime factor of 26653 using Pollard's rho algorithm is 97."
