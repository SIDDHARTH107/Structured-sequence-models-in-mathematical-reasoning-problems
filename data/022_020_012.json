    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using complex analysis, we will use the method of separation of variables and conformal mapping. Let's first rewrite the given Laplace equation in terms of a complex variable $z = x + iy$:\n\n$$u_{xx} + u_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = 0.$$\n\nNow, let's assume a solution of the form $u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into the Laplace equation, we get:\n\n$$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0.$$\n\nDividing both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$, we obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0.$$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $x$ and the right-hand side depends only on $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-\\lambda$. Then, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0,$$\n$$Y''(y) - \\lambda Y(y) = 0.$$\n\nNow, we need to solve these ODEs subject to the given boundary conditions. For the first ODE, we have:\n\n$$X(0) = 0,$$\n$$X(1) = \\sin(\\pi x).$$\n\nFor the second ODE, we have:\n\n$$Y(0) = 0,$$\n$$Y(1) = 1.$$\n\nLet's solve the ODEs. For the first ODE, we have the characteristic equation:\n\n$$r^2 + \\lambda = 0 \\Rightarrow r = \\pm \\sqrt{-\\lambda}.$$\n\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x).$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$$X(0) = A = 0,$$\n$$X(1) = B\\sin(\\sqrt{-\\lambda}) = \\sin(\\pi x).$$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$$X(x) = \\sin(\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x).$$\n\nFor the second ODE, we have the characteristic equation:\n\n$$r^2 - \\lambda = 0 \\Rightarrow r = \\pm \\sqrt{\\lambda}.$$\n\nThe general solution for $Y(y)$ is:\n\n$$Y(y) = C\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y) + D\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y).$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$$Y(0) = C = 0,$$\n$$Y(1) = D\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = 1.$$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$$Y(y) = \\frac{\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y)}{\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda})}.$$\n\nNow, we can write the solution for $u(x, y)$ as:\n\n$$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y) = \\sin(\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x)\\frac{\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y)}{\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda})}.$$\n\nTo find the exact solution, we would need to determine the value of $\\lambda$ that satisfies the boundary conditions. However, this is beyond the scope of complex analysis and would require solving a transcendental equation. Nonetheless, the solution above represents the general form of the solution in terms of complex variables."
