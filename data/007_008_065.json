    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 7^16 is divided by 17, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem. Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p.\n\nIn this case, p = 17 (which is a prime number) and a = 7. So, according to Fermat's Little Theorem, 7^17 ≡ 7 (mod 17). Now, we can rewrite 7^16 as (7^16) * (7^0), which is equal to (7^16) * 1. Since 7^17 ≡ 7 (mod 17), we can write 7^16 * 7 ≡ 7^17 (mod 17).\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 7:\n\n(7^16 * 7) / 7 ≡ 7^17 / 7 (mod 17)\n7^16 ≡ 7^16 (mod 17)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^16 is divided by 17 is 1."
