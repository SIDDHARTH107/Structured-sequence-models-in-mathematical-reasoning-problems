    "message_2": "There are 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32. These groups can be classified into the following structures:\n\n1. Cyclic group: C_32\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_16 × C_2\n3. Direct product of three cyclic groups: C_8 × C_2 × C_2\n4. Direct product of four cyclic groups: C_4 × C_4 × C_2 × C_2\n5. Direct product of five cyclic groups: C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2\n\n6-9. Four non-isomorphic groups of order 32 that are a semidirect product of C_16 and C_2.\n10-17. Eight non-isomorphic groups of order 32 that are a semidirect product of C_8 and C_4.\n18-29. Twelve non-isomorphic groups of order 32 that are a semidirect product of C_8 and C_2 × C_2.\n30-37. Eight non-isomorphic groups of order 32 that are a semidirect product of C_4 × C_4 and C_2.\n38-51. Fourteen non-isomorphic groups of order 32 that are a semidirect product of C_4 × C_2 × C_2 and C_2.\n\nThese 51 non-isomorphic groups can be further studied using their presentations, subgroup lattices, and other algebraic properties."
