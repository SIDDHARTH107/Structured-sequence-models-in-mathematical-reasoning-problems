    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k individuals affected by the disease\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n individuals taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the prevalence rate of the disease (0.05 in this case)\n- n is the total number of individuals (200 in this case)\n- k is the number of affected individuals\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 10 individuals being affected, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 10 to k = 200.\n\nP(X >= 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9))\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for k = 0 to k = 9 using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 10) = Σ [C(200, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(200-k)] for k = 0 to 9\n\nAfter calculating the sum, we subtract it from 1 to get the probability of at least 10 individuals being affected:\n\nP(X >= 10) = 1 - P(X < 10)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 10) ≈ 0.9826\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 out of 200 randomly selected individuals from the demographic group will be affected by the disease is approximately 98.26%."
