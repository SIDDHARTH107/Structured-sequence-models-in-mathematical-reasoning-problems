    "message_2": "The fundamental group of the unit circle S^1 is the group of integers, denoted as Z or â„¤. This is because loops on the unit circle can be classified by the number of times they wind around the circle, with positive integers representing counterclockwise winding and negative integers representing clockwise winding."
