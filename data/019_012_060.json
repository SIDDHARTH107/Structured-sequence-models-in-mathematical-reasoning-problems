    "message_1": "I apologize, but it is not possible to create a numerical problem for paraconsistent logic as it deals with the study of inconsistent systems. Paraconsistent logic is based on the idea that there may be situations in which contradictions coexist without leading to an explosion of consequences. Instead of a numerical problem, a question for the student to ponder could be \"Why is paraconsistent logic important in dealing with inconsistent or contradictory situations in real-world applications?\"",
    "message_2": "Paraconsistent logic is important in dealing with inconsistent or contradictory situations in real-world applications because it allows us to reason and make decisions even when faced with conflicting information. Traditional logic systems would lead to an explosion of consequences, rendering any conclusions drawn from the contradictory information useless. However, paraconsistent logic provides a framework to handle these inconsistencies and extract meaningful conclusions.\n\nFor example, in the field of artificial intelligence, paraconsistent logic can be used to handle contradictory data and make more informed decisions. In the medical field, it can help in diagnosing patients with conflicting symptoms or test results. In legal systems, it can be used to analyze and weigh conflicting evidence.\n\nOverall, paraconsistent logic is a valuable tool for managing and making sense of real-world situations where inconsistencies and contradictions are inevitable."
