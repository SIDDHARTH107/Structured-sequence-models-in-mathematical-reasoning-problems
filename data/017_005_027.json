    "message_2": "A group of order 125 (5^3) is a p-group, where p is a prime number (in this case, p = 5). According to the Sylow theorems, every group of order p^n (where p is prime and n is a positive integer) has a normal subgroup of order p^i for every i such that 0 ≤ i ≤ n. In this case, the group of order 125 has normal subgroups of orders 5^0 = 1, 5^1 = 5, 5^2 = 25, and 5^3 = 125.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of the group. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, every finite abelian group can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. Since 125 = 5^3, there are three possibilities for the structure of the group:\n\n1. A cyclic group of order 125: C_125\n2. A direct product of a cyclic group of order 25 and a cyclic group of order 5: C_25 × C_5\n3. A direct product of three cyclic groups of order 5: C_5 × C_5 × C_5\n\nNow, let's address the question of whether the group of order 125 can be represented as a direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25. If the group is isomorphic to C_25 × C_5, then it can be represented as a direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25. However, if the group is isomorphic to C_125 or C_5 × C_5 × C_5, it cannot be represented in this way.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 125 can have one of the three structures mentioned above. If it has the structure C_25 × C_5, then it can be represented as a direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25. However, if it has the structure C_125 or C_5 × C_5 × C_5, it cannot be represented in this way."
