    "message_2": "To determine the Cartan connection $\\omega$ associated with the smooth map $f: M \\rightarrow G$, we first need to define the Maurer-Cartan form on the Lie group $G$. The Maurer-Cartan form is a $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-form on $G$ defined by\n\n$$\\theta_g = L_g^* \\theta_e$$\n\nwhere $L_g$ is the left translation by $g \\in G$, and $\\theta_e$ is the identity element of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nNow, let's pull back the Maurer-Cartan form to the manifold $M$ via the smooth map $f: M \\rightarrow G$. This gives us a $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-form on $M$, which we denote by $\\omega = f^* \\theta_g$. The Cartan connection $\\omega$ is a connection on the principal $G$-bundle $P \\rightarrow M$ associated with the smooth map $f$.\n\nTo compute the Cartan connection $\\omega$, we need to express it in terms of the local coordinates on $M$. Let $(r, \\theta, z)$ be the local coordinates on $M$. Then, the tangent vectors at a point $p \\in M$ are given by\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$$\n\nWe can now compute the action of $\\omega$ on these tangent vectors:\n\n$$\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\right) = f^* \\theta_g \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\right)$$\n$$\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) = f^* \\theta_g \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)$$\n$$\\omega\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right) = f^* \\theta_g \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right)$$\n\nTo compute these expressions, we need to know the action of the Maurer-Cartan form $\\theta_g$ on the tangent vectors of $G$. This depends on the specific Lie group $G$ and its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. Once we have this information, we can compute the Cartan connection $\\omega$ in terms of the local coordinates on $M$."
