    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {3} = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products and symmetric differences for each question:\n\n1. (A △ B) x {2} = {1, 2, 4, 5} x {2} = {(1, 2), (2, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2)}\n\n2.

This does not prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to Cartesian product, as the statement given was incorrect."
