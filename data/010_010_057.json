    "message_2": "A torus is a surface of genus 1, and according to the Poincare-Hopf theorem, the sum of the indices of the critical points of a smooth function on a surface is equal to the Euler characteristic of the surface. The Euler characteristic of a torus is 0 (Ï‡ = 2 - 2g, where g is the genus).\n\nFor a smooth function on a torus, the minimum number of critical points is 2. This can be achieved by having one saddle point with index -1 and one local extremum (either a local maximum or a local minimum) with index +1. The sum of the indices in this case is 0, which is equal to the Euler characteristic of the torus.\n\nThere is no maximum number of critical points for a smooth function on a torus. You can always construct a smooth function with more critical points by adding more saddle points and local extrema, as long as the sum of the indices remains equal to the Euler characteristic of the torus (0 in this case). For example, you can have 2 local maxima, 2 local minima, and 4 saddle points, or 3 local maxima, 3 local minima, and 6 saddle points, and so on."
