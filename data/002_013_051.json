    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base length of 5 centimeters, a base width of 6 centimeters, and a height of 8 centimeters. What is the volume of this rectangular pyramid in cubic centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, you can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid can be found by multiplying the base length and base width:\n\nBase Area = 5 cm * 6 cm = 30 cm²\n\nNow, plug the base area and height into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 30 cm² * 8 cm = (1/3) * 240 cm³ = 80 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 80 cubic centimeters."
