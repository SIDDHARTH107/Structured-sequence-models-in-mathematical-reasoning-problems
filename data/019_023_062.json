    "message_2": "Yes, the student can determine the formula for finding the nth term in this sequence using inductive reasoning. Let's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n5 - 2 = 3\n10 - 5 = 5\n17 - 10 = 7\n26 - 17 = 9\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are increasing by 2 each time. This indicates that the sequence is likely based on a quadratic function of the form:\n\nan^2 + bn + c\n\nTo find the coefficients a, b, and c, we can use the first three terms of the sequence and set up a system of equations:\n\n1. a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 2\n2. a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 5\n3. a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 10\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\n1. a + b + c = 2\n2. 4a + 2b + c = 5\n3. 9a + 3b + c = 10\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2 and equation 3, we get:\n\n1. 3a + b = 3\n2. 8a + 2b = 8\n\nDividing equation 2 by 2, we get:\n\n1. 3a + b = 3\n2. 4a + b = 4\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we get:\n\na = 1\n\nNow we can find b:\n\n3a + b = 3\n3(1) + b = 3\nb = 0\n\nFinally, we can find c:\n\na + b + c = 2\n1 + 0 + c = 2\nc = 1\n\nSo the formula for the nth term is:\n\nan^2 + bn + c = n^2 + 1\n\nThus, the formula for the nth term of the sequence is:\n\nnth term = n^2 + 1"
