    "message_1": "What is the correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied and grades obtained in a math exam, given the following data?\n\nHours studied: 6, 9, 4, 8, 7, 5  \nGrades obtained: 75, 90, 60, 85, 80, 70 \n\nRound your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r), we will first need to calculate the mean of both the hours studied (X) and the grades obtained (Y). Then, we will find the standard deviation of both sets of data. Finally, we will calculate the covariance between the two sets of data and divide it by the product of their standard deviations.\n\n1. Calculate the mean of X and Y:\n\nMean of X (hours studied): (6 + 9 + 4 + 8 + 7 + 5) / 6 = 39 / 6 = 6.5\nMean of Y (grades obtained): (75 + 90 + 60 + 85 + 80 + 70) / 6 = 460 / 6 = 76.67\n\n2. Calculate the standard deviation of X and Y:\n\nFor X:\na. Find the squared difference between each value and the mean:\n(6 - 6.5)^2 = 0.25\n(9 - 6.5)^2 = 6.25\n(4 - 6.5)^2 = 6.25\n(8 - 6.5)^2 = 2.25\n(7 - 6.5)^2 = 0.25\n(5 - 6.5)^2 = 2.25\n\nb. Find the average of these squared differences:\n(0.25 + 6.25 + 6.25 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 2.25) / 6 = 17.5 / 6 = 2.917\n\nc. Take the square root of this average:\n√2.917 ≈ 1.71 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nFor Y:\na. Find the squared difference between each value and the mean:\n(75 - 76.67)^2 = 2.78\n(90 - 76.67)^2 = 178.45\n(60 - 76.67)^2 = 278.45\n(85 - 76.67)^2 = 69.45\n(80 - 76.67)^2 = 11.12\n(70 - 76.67)^2 = 44.45\n\nb. Find the average of these squared differences:\n(2.78 + 178.45 + 278.45 + 69.45 + 11.12 + 44.45) / 6 = 584.7 / 6 = 97.45\n\nc. Take the square root of this average:\n√97.45 ≈ 9.87 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n3. Calculate the covariance between X and Y:\n\na. Find the product of the differences between each value and their respective means:\n(6 - 6.5)(75 - 76.67) = 0.25 * (-1.67) = -0.42\n(9 - 6.5)(90 - 76.67) = 2.5 * 13.33 = 33.33\n(4 - 6.5)(60 - 76.67) = -2.5 * (-16.67) = 41.67\n(8 - 6.5)(85 - 76.67) = 1.5 * 8.33 = 12.5\n(7 - 6.5)(80 - 76.67) = 0.5 * 3.33 = 1.67\n(5 - 6.5)(70 - 76.67) = -1.5 * (-6.67) = 10\n\nb. Find the average of these products:\n(-0.42 + 33.33 + 41.67 + 12.5 + 1.67 + 10) / 6 = 98.75 / 6 = 16.46\n\n4. Calculate the correlation coefficient (r):\n\nr = Covariance(X, Y) / (Standard Deviation of X * Standard Deviation of Y)\nr = 16.46 / (1.71 * 9.87) ≈ 16.46 / 16.87 ≈ 0.976\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied and grades obtained in a math exam is approximately 0.98 (rounded to two decimal places)."
