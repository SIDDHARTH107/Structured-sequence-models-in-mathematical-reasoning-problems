    "message_2": "To find the number of zeroes of f(z) in the complex plane, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which states that a non-constant polynomial function has exactly as many zeroes as its degree, counting multiplicity. Since f(z) is a polynomial of degree 3, it has exactly 3 zeroes in the complex plane, counting multiplicity."
