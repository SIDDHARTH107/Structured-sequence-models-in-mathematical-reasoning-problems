    "message_1": "In a game of cheap talk, two players are playing by exchanging messages. The first player must choose between two actions: play strategy A or strategy B. The second player must choose between two actions: play strategy X or strategy Y. The payoffs for the game are as follows:\n\n- If player 1 plays A and player 2 plays X, player 1 gets 10 and player 2 gets 5\n- If player 1 plays A and player 2 plays Y, player 1 gets 0 and player 2 gets 7\n- If player 1 plays B and player 2 plays X, player 1 gets 8 and player 2 gets 2\n- If player 1 plays B and player 2 plays Y, player 1 gets 2 and player 2 gets 3\n\nAssuming that both players always tell the truth, what would be the best strategy for player 1 to adopt?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best strategy for player 1, we need to consider the possible outcomes based on the assumption that both players always tell the truth.\n\nIf player 1 chooses strategy A and communicates this to player 2, player 2 will know that they can get a higher payoff by choosing strategy Y (7 > 5). Therefore, if player 1 chooses A, player 2 will choose Y, and the payoffs will be (0, 7).\n\nIf player 1 chooses strategy B and communicates this to player 2, player 2 will know that they can get a higher payoff by choosing strategy Y (3 > 2). Therefore, if player 1 chooses B, player 2 will choose Y, and the payoffs will be (2, 3).\n\nComparing the payoffs for player 1 in both scenarios, we can see that player 1 gets a higher payoff by choosing strategy B (2 > 0). Therefore, the best strategy for player 1 to adopt, assuming both players always tell the truth, is strategy B."
