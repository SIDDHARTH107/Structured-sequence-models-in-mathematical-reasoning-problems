    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(4,4) is the smallest integer n such that any graph with n vertices will either contain a clique of size 4 (a complete subgraph with 4 vertices) or an independent set of size 4 (a subgraph with 4 vertices where no two vertices are connected by an edge). The Ramsey number R(4,4) is known to be 18."
