    "message_2": "The dimension of a simplicial complex is determined by the highest dimension of its simplices. In this case, K consists of 4 simplices, each of which is a set of 3 vertices. Since each simplex has 3 vertices, they are 2-dimensional (a triangle). Therefore, the dimension of K is 2."
