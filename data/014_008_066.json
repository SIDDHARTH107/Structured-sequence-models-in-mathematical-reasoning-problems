    "message_2": "The total number of possible keys for a block cipher depends on the key length. In this case, the key length is 128 bits. To find the total number of possible keys, you need to calculate 2 raised to the power of the key length (2^128).\n\nTotal number of possible keys = 2^128 = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456"
