    "message_2": "We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side of the triangle. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c and an angle C opposite side c, the following equation holds:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, we have a = 8, b = 12, and C = 120 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nC = 120 * (π / 180) = (2π / 3) radians\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines equation:\n\nc^2 = 8^2 + 12^2 - 2 * 8 * 12 * cos(2π / 3)\nc^2 = 64 + 144 - 192 * (-1/2)\nc^2 = 208 + 96\nc^2 = 304\n\nNow, we find the square root of 304 to get the length of the third side:\n\nc = √304 ≈ 17.44\n\nSo, the length of the third side of the triangle is approximately 17.44 units."
