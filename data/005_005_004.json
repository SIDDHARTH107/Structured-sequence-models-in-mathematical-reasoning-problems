    "message_2": "To calculate the mean and standard deviation of defective light bulbs in the sample of 1000, we can use the formulas for the mean and standard deviation of a binomial distribution.\n\nMean (μ) = n * p\nStandard Deviation (σ) = √(n * p * (1-p))\n\nWhere n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of light bulbs produced) and p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a light bulb being defective).\n\nMean (μ) = 1000 * 0.05 = 50\nStandard Deviation (σ) = √(1000 * 0.05 * (1-0.05)) = √(1000 * 0.05 * 0.95) = √(47.5) ≈ 6.89\n\nSo, the mean number of defective light bulbs in the sample of 1000 is 50, and the standard deviation is approximately 6.89."
