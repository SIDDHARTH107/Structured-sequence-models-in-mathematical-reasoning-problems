A set C is a superset of set A if every element of A is also an element of C. Similarly, a set C is a superset of set B if every element of B is also an element of C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of A:\n\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of A is also an element of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of B:\n\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of B is also an element of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, the union of sets A and B, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}, is a superset of both sets A and B."
