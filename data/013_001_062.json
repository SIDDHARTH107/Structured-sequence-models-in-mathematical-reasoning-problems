    "message_1": "Here is a math problem related to Prisoner's Dilemma:\n\nSuppose two suspects are arrested for theft and are placed in separate cells. The prosecutor offers both prisoners a deal:\n- If both accused confess, they will each receive 1 year of prison time.\n- If only one of them confesses, the one who confesses will be set free and the other will receive 3 years of prison time.\n- If neither of them confesses, both will receive 2 years of prison time.\n\nWhat is the best strategy for each prisoner to follow and what is the outcome of the game?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can create a payoff matrix to represent the possible outcomes for each prisoner based on their decisions. Let's denote the two prisoners as A and B, and their choices as C (confess) and N (not confess).\n\nThe payoff matrix would look like this:\n\n```\n           B\n         C     N\n       +-----+-----+\n    C  | 1,1 | 0,3 |\nA      +-----+-----+\n    N  | 3,0 | 2,2 |\n       +-----+-----+\n```\n\nNow, let's analyze the best strategy for each prisoner:\n\n1. If prisoner A thinks that prisoner B will confess (C), then A's best choice is also to confess (C), as 1 year of prison time is better than 3 years.\n2. If prisoner A thinks that prisoner B will not confess (N), then A's best choice is still to confess (C), as going free is better than 2 years of prison time.\n\nThe same logic applies to prisoner B. Therefore, the best strategy for both prisoners is to confess (C). The outcome of the game would be that both prisoners confess and each receives 1 year of prison time. This is known as the Nash equilibrium in game theory, where no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy."
