    "message_2": "To determine the treewidth of a graph, we need to find the smallest tree decomposition of the graph. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices of the graph, and the following conditions are met:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices of the graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there is a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the graph, the bags containing v form a connected subtree.\n\nThe treewidth of a graph is the size of the largest bag in its smallest tree decomposition minus one.\n\nIn general, finding the treewidth of a graph is an NP-hard problem. However, we can provide an upper bound for the treewidth using the maximum degree of the graph. The treewidth is at most the maximum degree of the graph.\n\nFor a graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges, the maximum degree is at most 9 (if one vertex is connected to all other vertices). Therefore, the treewidth of the graph is at most 9.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact treewidth."
