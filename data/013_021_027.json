    "message_1": "In a Centipede Game, players take turns either passing or taking one unit of currency. The game ends after n turns have been taken, and each playerâ€™s payoff is the sum of the units of currency they have accumulated over the game. \nFor a Centipede Game with n = 5, what is the equilibrium outcome (in terms of the number of currency units each player has) if both players use a tit-for-tat strategy?",
    "message_2": "In a tit-for-tat strategy, a player will replicate the previous action of their opponent. If the opponent passed in the previous turn, the player will pass; if the opponent took the currency in the previous turn, the player will take the currency.\n\nLet's analyze the Centipede Game with n = 5 turns and both players using a tit-for-tat strategy:\n\nTurn 1: Player 1 starts the game and has no previous action from Player 2 to replicate, so Player 1 passes.\nTurn 2: Player 2 replicates Player 1's previous action (pass) and also passes.\nTurn 3: Player 1 replicates Player 2's previous action (pass) and also passes.\nTurn 4: Player 2 replicates Player 1's previous action (pass) and also passes.\nTurn 5: Player 1 replicates Player 2's previous action (pass) and also passes.\n\nSince the game ends after 5 turns, no player has taken any currency. The equilibrium outcome for this Centipede Game with n = 5 and both players using a tit-for-tat strategy is 0 currency units for each player."
