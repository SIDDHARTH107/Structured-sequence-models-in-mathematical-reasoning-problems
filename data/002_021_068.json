    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle/360°) × π × (radius)^2\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 60° and the radius is 7 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (60°/360°) × π × (7 cm)^2\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 49 cm^2\nArea of sector = (49π/6) cm^2\n\nThe area of the sector is (49π/6) square centimeters."
