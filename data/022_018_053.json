    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE), we can use the method of characteristics. The PDE can be written as:\n\n∂u/∂x + 4i∂u/∂y = 2x + 3iy\n\nLet's introduce new variables ξ and η, such that:\n\nξ = x - 4iy\nη = y\n\nNow, we can rewrite the PDE in terms of ξ and η:\n\n∂u/∂ξ = 2ξ + 3iη\n\nWe can solve this ordinary differential equation (ODE) by integrating both sides with respect to ξ:\n\nu(ξ, η) = ∫(2ξ + 3iη) dξ + g(η)\nu(ξ, η) = ξ^2 + 3iξη + g(η)\n\nNow, we need to find the function g(η) using the initial condition u(x, 0) = e^(-3x) + i. Since η = y, when y = 0, we have ξ = x. Therefore, the initial condition can be written as:\n\nu(ξ, 0) = e^(-3ξ) + i\n\nComparing this with the general solution u(ξ, η) = ξ^2 + 3iξη + g(η), we can see that when η = 0:\n\nξ^2 + g(0) = e^(-3ξ) + i\n\nTo satisfy this equation for all ξ, we must have g(0) = i and g(η) = 0 for η ≠ 0. Therefore, g(η) = iδ(η), where δ(η) is the Dirac delta function. The solution to the PDE in terms of ξ and η is:\n\nu(ξ, η) = ξ^2 + 3iξη + iδ(η)\n\nFinally, we can transform back to the original variables x and y:\n\nu(x, y) = (x - 4iy)^2 + 3i(x - 4iy)y + iδ(y)\n\nThis is the solution to the given partial differential equation with the specified initial condition."
