    "message_2": "To find the estimated percentage of people who prefer coffee in a population of 10,000, we can use the proportion from the survey data.\n\nIn the survey, 600 out of 1000 people prefer coffee. To find the percentage, we can set up a proportion:\n\n600 / 1000 = x / 10,000\n\nWhere x is the number of people who prefer coffee in a population of 10,000.\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (600 * 10,000) / 1000\nx = 6,000,000 / 1000\nx = 6,000\n\nSo, in a population of 10,000, an estimated 6,000 people prefer coffee. To find the percentage, we can divide the number of coffee lovers by the total population and multiply by 100:\n\nPercentage = (6,000 / 10,000) * 100\nPercentage = 0.6 * 100\nPercentage = 60%\n\nTherefore, the estimated percentage of people who prefer coffee in a population of 10,000 is 60%."
