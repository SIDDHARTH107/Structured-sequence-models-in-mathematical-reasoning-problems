    "message_2": "First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same:\n\n(2) * (-2x + 3y) = (2) * 5\n-4x + 6y = 10\n\nNow we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n-4x + 6y = 10\n4x - 6y = -10\n\nNext, we can add the two equations together to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(-4x + 6y) + (4x - 6y) = 10 + (-10)\n0x + 0y = 0\n\nSince 0 = 0, this means that the two equations are dependent and represent the same line. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations. The solution can be represented as:\n\nx = x\ny = (5 + 2x) / 3"
