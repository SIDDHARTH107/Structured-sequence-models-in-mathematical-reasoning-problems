    "message_2": "The phase shift can be found by looking at the argument of the sine function, which is (2x - pi/4) in this case. To find the phase shift, we need to set the argument equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n2x - pi/4 = 0\n\nNow, add pi/4 to both sides:\n\n2x = pi/4\n\nNext, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = pi/8\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function y = 3sin(2x - pi/4) - 1 is pi/8 units to the right."
