    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of the term with degree 5 in the expansion of (x + y)^8, we can use Pascal's Triangle. In Pascal's Triangle, the nth row represents the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (x + y)^n. \n\nWe need to find the coefficients in the 8th row (since we are expanding (x + y)^8). Remember that the numbering of rows in Pascal's Triangle starts from 0, so the 8th row is actually the 9th row in the triangle. The 9th row of Pascal's Triangle is:\n\n1  8  28  56  70  56  28  8  1\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of the term with degree 5. In the expansion of (x + y)^8, the term with degree 5 is the term with x^5y^3. The general term in the binomial expansion is given by:\n\n(n choose k) * x^(n-k) * y^k\n\nIn our case, n = 8 and k = 3 (since we want the term with x^5y^3). So, the coefficient of the term with degree 5 is the 4th entry in the 9th row of Pascal's Triangle (since the numbering starts from 0):\n\nCoefficient = (8 choose 3) = 56\n\nTherefore, the value of the coefficient of the term with degree 5 in the expansion of (x + y)^8 using Pascal's Triangle is 56."
