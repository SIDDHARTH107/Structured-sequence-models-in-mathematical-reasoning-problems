    "message_1": "A store has a limited budget of $5000 to buy pencils and pens for their customers. The pencils cost $1.50 each and the pens cost $2.50 each. The store needs to buy at least 1500 pencils and 500 pens. How many pencils and pens should the store buy to spend exactly $5000 and satisfy their minimum requirements?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of pencils and y be the number of pens. We have the following constraints:\n\n1.5x + 2.5y = 5000 (The total cost should be $5000)\nx >= 1500 (At least 1500 pencils)\ny >= 500 (At least 500 pens)\n\nWe can rewrite the first equation as:\ny = (5000 - 1.5x) / 2.5\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy the constraints and the equation.\n\nSince x >= 1500, let's start with x = 1500 and find the corresponding value of y:\ny = (5000 - 1.5 * 1500) / 2.5\ny = (5000 - 2250) / 2.5\ny = 2750 / 2.5\ny = 1100\n\nSo, when x = 1500, y = 1100. This satisfies the constraint y >= 500.\n\nNow, let's check if we can increase the number of pencils (x) while still satisfying the constraints and the equation. If we increase x by 1, we need to decrease y by 1.5/2.5 = 0.6 to keep the total cost at $5000.\n\nHowever, decreasing y by 0.6 would result in a non-integer value for y, which is not possible since we cannot buy a fraction of a pen. Therefore, the store should buy 1500 pencils and 1100 pens to spend exactly $5000 and satisfy their minimum requirements."
