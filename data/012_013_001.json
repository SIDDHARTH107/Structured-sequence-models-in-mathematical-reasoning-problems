Calculate the chromatic polynomial of this graph.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the chromatic polynomial of a graph, we need to find the number of ways to color the graph using k colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Let P(G, k) denote the chromatic polynomial of graph G with k colors.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given graph. Since vertex 7 has degree 6, it must be connected to all other vertices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). Now, let's consider the remaining vertices and their degrees:\n\n1. Vertex 1 has degree 1, so it must be connected to vertex 7.\n2. Vertex 2 has degree 2, so it must be connected to vertex 7 and one other vertex.\n3. Vertex 3 has degree 3, so it must be connected to vertex 7 and two other vertices.\n4. Vertex 4 has degree 3, so it must be connected to vertex 7 and two other vertices.\n5. Vertex 5 has degree 4, so it must be connected to vertex 7 and three other vertices.\n6. Vertex 6 has degree 5, so it must be connected to vertex 7 and all other vertices (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).\n\nNow, let's find the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for this graph:\n\n1. Vertex 7 can be colored using k colors.\n2. Vertex 6 can be colored using (k-1) colors, as it cannot have the same color as vertex 7.\n3. Vertex 5 can be colored using (k-2) colors, as it cannot have the same color as vertices 6 and 7.\n4. Vertex 4 can be colored using (k-2) colors, as it cannot have the same color as vertices 5 and 7.\n5. Vertex 3 can be colored using (k-2) colors, as it cannot have the same color as vertices 4 and 7.\n6. Vertex 2 can be colored using (k-1) colors, as it cannot have the same color as vertex 7.\n7. Vertex 1 can be colored using (k-1) colors, as it cannot have the same color as vertex 7.\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for this graph is:\n\nP(G, k) = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-2) * (k-2) * (k-1) * (k-1)\n\nP(G, k) = k * (k-1)^3 * (k-2)^3"
