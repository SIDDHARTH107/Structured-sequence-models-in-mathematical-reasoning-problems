    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, denoted as φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nTo compute φ(15), we first find the prime factors of 15. The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5. Now, we use the formula for the Euler's totient function for a number with distinct prime factors:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor n = 15, we have:\n\nφ(15) = 15 * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/5)\nφ(15) = 15 * (2/3) * (4/5)\nφ(15) = 15 * (8/15)\nφ(15) = 8\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for the number 15 is 8."
