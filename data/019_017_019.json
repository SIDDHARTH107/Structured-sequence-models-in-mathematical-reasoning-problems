    "message_2": "1. Is R reflexive on this set?\n\nA relation R is reflexive if for every element x in the set, xRx holds true. In this case, x is a divisor of itself for all natural numbers x. Therefore, the relation R is reflexive on the set of all natural numbers.\n\n2. Is R symmetric on this set?\n\nA relation R is symmetric if for every pair of elements x and y in the set, if xRy holds true, then yRx also holds true. In this case, if x is a divisor of y, it does not necessarily mean that y is a divisor of x. For example, 2 is a divisor of 4 (2R4), but 4 is not a divisor of 2 (4R2 does not hold). Therefore, the relation R is not symmetric on the set of all natural numbers.\n\n3. Is R transitive on this set?\n\nA relation R is transitive if for every triplet of elements x, y, and z in the set, if xRy and yRz hold true, then xRz also holds true. In this case, if x is a divisor of y and y is a divisor of z, then x must also be a divisor of z. For example, if 2 is a divisor of 4 (2R4) and 4 is a divisor of 8 (4R8), then 2 is also a divisor of 8 (2R8). Therefore, the relation R is transitive on the set of all natural numbers."
