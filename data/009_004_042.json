    "message_2": "To determine the spring constant (k) and the angular frequency (ω) of the system, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Hooke's Law: F = -kx\n2. Angular frequency: ω = √(k/m)\n3. Frequency: f = ω / (2π)\n\nFirst, we need to find the spring constant (k). We can use the initial compression of the spring (5 cm) and the mass (0.5 kg) to find the force exerted by the spring when it's compressed.\n\nF = ma\na = F/m\n\nSince the spring is initially compressed by 5 cm (0.05 m), the force exerted by the spring when it's compressed is:\n\nF = -kx\nF = -k(0.05)\n\nNow, we can use the amplitude (10 cm or 0.1 m) and the frequency (5 Hz) to find the maximum acceleration (amax) of the mass during oscillation.\n\namax = (2πf)^2 * A\namax = (2π * 5)^2 * 0.1\namax = (10π)^2 * 0.1\namax = 100π^2 * 0.1\namax = 31.42 m/s^2\n\nNow we can find the force exerted by the spring at maximum compression:\n\nF = ma\nF = (0.5 kg)(31.42 m/s^2)\nF = 15.71 N\n\nNow we can find the spring constant (k) using the force exerted by the spring when it's compressed:\n\nF = -k(0.05)\n15.71 = k(0.05)\nk = 15.71 / 0.05\nk = 314.2 N/m\n\nNow we can find the angular frequency (ω) using the formula:\n\nω = √(k/m)\nω = √(314.2 N/m / 0.5 kg)\nω = √(628.4)\nω = 25.07 rad/s\n\nSo, the spring constant (k) is 314.2 N/m, and the angular frequency (ω) is 25.07 rad/s."
