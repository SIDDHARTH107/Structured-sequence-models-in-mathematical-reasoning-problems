    "message_2": "To compute the largest Lyapunov exponent of the Henon-Heiles system, we first need to define the system. The Henon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, given by the following Hamiltonian:\n\n$H(x, y, p_x, p_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(p_x^2 + p_y^2) + V(x, y)$\n\nwhere $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + ax^2y - \\frac{1}{3}by^3$ is the potential energy, and $a$ and $b$ are the parameters.\n\nThe equations of motion for this system are:\n\n$\\dot{x} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_x} = p_x$\n\n$\\dot{y} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_y} = p_y$\n\n$\\dot{p_x} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = -x - 2axy$\n\n$\\dot{p_y} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = -y - ax^2 + by^2$\n\nTo compute the largest Lyapunov exponent, we need to linearize the system around a trajectory and compute the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian matrix for this system is:\n\n$J = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 - 2ay & -2ax & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-2ax & -1 + 2by & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe largest Lyapunov exponent is given by the maximum real part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. Computing the eigenvalues of this matrix analytically is difficult, so we will use numerical methods to compute the largest Lyapunov exponent.\n\nFor the given parameters $a = 1.0$ and $b = 1.0$, the largest Lyapunov exponent of the Henon-Heiles system is approximately 0.0707."
