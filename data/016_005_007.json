    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set does not change after repeating the removal of the middle third portion n times, where n is a positive integer. The Hausdorff dimension remains constant and is given by the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor set, N = 2 (as it is divided into two equal parts after each iteration) and the scaling factor S = 3 (as each part is one-third the size of the previous interval).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Cantor set is:\n\nD = log(2) / log(3) â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nThis value remains constant regardless of the number of iterations (n) performed."
