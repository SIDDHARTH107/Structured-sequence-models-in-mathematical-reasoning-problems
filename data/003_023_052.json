    "message_1": "Suppose you have two vectors, vector A with magnitude 5 and vector B with magnitude 7, and the angle between them is 60°. Find the magnitude of their cross product.",
    "message_2": "The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors A and B can be found using the formula:\n\n|A x B| = |A| * |B| * sin(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, respectively, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nGiven the magnitudes of vectors A and B as 5 and 7, respectively, and the angle between them as 60°, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n|A x B| = 5 * 7 * sin(60°)\n\nTo find the sine of 60°, we can recall that sin(60°) = √3/2:\n\n|A x B| = 5 * 7 * (√3/2)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\n|A x B| = (35 * √3) / 2\n\nSo, the magnitude of the cross product of vectors A and B is (35√3) / 2."
