    "message_1": "Suppose a manufacturer wants to test the effects of four factors (A, B, C and D) on the performance of a product. The manufacturer decides to use an L18 (2^1 x 3^2) orthogonal array. If the units for each factor are as follows:\n\nA: +1, -1\nB: +1, 0, -1\nC: +1, 0, -1\nD: +1, -1\n\nDetermine the set of test runs that the manufacturer should perform to test the effects of these factors while minimizing the number of tests.",
    "message_2": "An L18 (2^1 x 3^2) orthogonal array is an experimental design that allows the manufacturer to test the effects of the four factors (A, B, C, and D) with 18 test runs. The array is designed to minimize the number of tests while still providing useful information about the effects of each factor.\n\nHere is the L18 orthogonal array for the given factors:\n\nTest Run | A  | B  | C  | D\n---------|----|----|----|---\n1        | +1 | +1 | +1 | +1\n2        | +1 | +1 | +1 | -1\n3        | +1 | +1 |  0 | +1\n4        | +1 | +1 |  0 | -1\n5        | +1 | +1 | -1 | +1\n6        | +1 | +1 | -1 | -1\n7        | +1 |  0 | +1 | +1\n8        | +1 |  0 | +1 | -1\n9        | +1 |  0 |  0 | +1\n10       | +1 |  0 |  0 | -1\n11       | +1 |  0 | -1 | +1\n12       | +1 |  0 | -1 | -1\n13       | -1 | +1 | +1 | +1\n14       | -1 | +1 | +1 | -1\n15       | -1 | +1 |  0 | +1\n16       | -1 | +1 |  0 | -1\n17       | -1 | +1 | -1 | +1\n18       | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1\n\nThe manufacturer should perform these 18 test runs to test the effects of factors A, B, C, and D while minimizing the number of tests."
