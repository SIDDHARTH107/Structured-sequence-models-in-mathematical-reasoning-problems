    "message_2": "To solve the equation (3x-1)/(x+2) = (2x+3)/(x-1), we will first eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying.\n\n(3x - 1)(x - 1) = (2x + 3)(x + 2)\n\nNow, we will expand both sides of the equation:\n\n3x^2 - 3x - x + 1 = 2x^2 + 4x + 3x + 6\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n3x^2 - 4x + 1 = 2x^2 + 7x + 6\n\nSubtract 2x^2, 7x, and 6 from both sides to set the equation to 0:\n\nx^2 - 11x - 5 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. To solve for x, we can either factor the equation or use the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring is not simple, so we will use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 1, b = -11, and c = -5. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nx = (11 ± √((-11)^2 - 4(1)(-5))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (11 ± √(121 + 20)) / 2\n\nx = (11 ± √141) / 2\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = (11 + √141) / 2 and x = (11 - √141) / 2"
