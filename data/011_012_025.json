    "message_2": "Let A be the set of players good at free throws, and B be the set of players good at three-pointers. We are given that |A| = 9, |B| = 7, and |A ∩ B| = 4. We want to find the number of players who are not good at either, which is the complement of the union of A and B, denoted as |(A ∪ B)^c|.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:\n\n|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B| = 9 + 7 - 4 = 12\n\nSince there are 15 players in total, the number of players not good at either free throws or three-pointers is:\n\n|(A ∪ B)^c| = Total number of players - |A ∪ B| = 15 - 12 = 3\n\nSo, there are 3 players in the team who are not good at either free throws or three-pointers."
