    "message_2": "A pair of twin primes are two prime numbers that differ by 2. To find the smallest pair of twin primes greater than 200, we can start by checking prime numbers just above 200.\n\nThe first prime number greater than 200 is 211. However, 211 + 2 = 213, which is not a prime number (213 = 3 × 71).\n\nThe next prime number is 223. In this case, 223 + 2 = 225, which is also not a prime number (225 = 3 × 3 × 5 × 5).\n\nContinuing this process, we find that the next prime number is 227. When we add 2 to 227, we get 229, which is also a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the smallest pair of twin primes greater than 200 is (227, 229)."
