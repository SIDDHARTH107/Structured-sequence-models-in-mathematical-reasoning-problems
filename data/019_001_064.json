    "message_1": "Suppose A represents the statement \"I brushed my teeth this morning\" and B represents the statement \"I ate breakfast this morning.\" Write the truth table for the logical expression \"A and B\", and determine whether the combined statement is true or false if A is true and B is false.",
    "message_2": "The truth table for the logical expression \"A and B\" is as follows:\n\nA | B | A and B\n---------------\nT | T |    T\nT | F |    F\nF | T |    F\nF | F |    F\n\nIn this table, T represents true and F represents false.\n\nNow, let's determine whether the combined statement is true or false if A is true and B is false. According to the truth table, when A is true (T) and B is false (F), the logical expression \"A and B\" is false (F). Therefore, the combined statement is false."
