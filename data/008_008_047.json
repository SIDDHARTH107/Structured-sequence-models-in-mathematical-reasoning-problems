    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. Profit per unit of A is $5 and per unit of B is $7. The company has 80 hours of labor and 120 units of raw material each day. Product A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 units of raw material, while product B requires 2 hours of labor and 4 units of raw material. Find the number of units of each product that the company should produce per day to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal combination of products A and B that the company should produce per day. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe profit function P(x, y) can be represented as:\nP(x, y) = 5x + 7y\n\nThe constraints for labor and raw material are:\n3x + 2y ≤ 80 (labor constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 120 (raw material constraint)\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will solve the system of inequalities to find the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll find the points where the constraints intersect:\n\n1. Intersection of labor constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n3x + 2(0) ≤ 80\nx ≤ 80/3 ≈ 26.67\n\n2. Intersection of labor constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n3(0) + 2y ≤ 80\ny ≤ 40\n\n3. Intersection of raw material constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n2x + 4(0) ≤ 120\nx ≤ 60\n\n4. Intersection of raw material constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n2(0) + 4y ≤ 120\ny ≤ 30\n\n5. Intersection of labor constraint and raw material constraint:\n3x + 2y ≤ 80\n2x + 4y ≤ 120\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n6x + 4y ≤ 160\n2x + 4y ≤ 120\n\nNow subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n4x ≤ 40\nx ≤ 10\n\nPlug x back into one of the equations to find y:\n\n2(10) + 4y ≤ 120\n20 + 4y ≤ 120\n4y ≤ 100\ny ≤ 25\n\nSo, the intersection point of the labor and raw material constraints is (10, 25).\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = 0\n2. P(26.67, 0) = 5(26.67) + 7(0) ≈ 133.35\n3. P(0, 40) = 5(0) + 7(40) = 280\n4. P(60, 0) = 5(60) + 7(0) = 300\n5. P(0, 30) = 5(0) + 7(30) = 210\n6. P(10, 25) = 5(10) + 7(25) = 50 + 175 = 225\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when producing 60 units of product A and 0 units of product B, resulting in a profit of $300 per day."
