    "message_2": "Pollard's Rho algorithm is an efficient method for finding non-trivial factors of a composite number. However, the number 8191 is a prime number, which means it cannot be factored into smaller integers other than 1 and itself. Therefore, the integer factorization of 8191 is simply 1 and 8191."
