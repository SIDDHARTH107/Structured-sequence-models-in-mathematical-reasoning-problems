    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of a population of 100,000 people, at least 500 people belonging to a specific demographic group will be affected by the disease? The data shows that this demographic group has a 5% higher chance of being affected by the disease compared to other groups.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need more information about the size of the specific demographic group in the population and the base probability of being affected by the disease for the general population. \n\nLet's assume the size of the specific demographic group is X and the base probability of being affected by the disease for the general population is P.\n\nThe probability of being affected by the disease for the specific demographic group is P + 5% (or P + 0.05).\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of at least 500 people from the specific demographic group being affected by the disease:\n\nP(at least 500) = 1 - P(0 to 499)\n\nP(k) = (X choose k) * (P + 0.05)^k * (1 - (P + 0.05))^(X - k)\n\nwhere k is the number of affected people, and \"X choose k\" is the number of combinations of choosing k affected people from the specific demographic group of size X.\n\nPlease provide the values for X and P to get the exact probability."
