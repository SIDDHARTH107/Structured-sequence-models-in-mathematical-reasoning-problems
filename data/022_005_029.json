    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 2) / (z^3 - 1) at z = 1, we first need to rewrite the function in a way that isolates the singularity at z = 1.\n\nThe denominator can be factored using the difference of cubes formula:\n\nz^3 - 1 = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 2) / [(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)]\n\nSince we are interested in the residue at z = 1, we want to find the coefficient of the term (z - 1)^(-1) in the Laurent series expansion of f(z) around z = 1.\n\nTo do this, we can perform a partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = A / (z - 1) + (Bz + C) / (z^2 + z + 1)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) to clear the denominators, we get:\n\nz^2 + 2 = A(z^2 + z + 1) + (Bz + C)(z - 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A, B, and C. Since we are only interested in the residue at z = 1, we can plug in z = 1 to find the value of A:\n\n1^2 + 2 = A(1^2 + 1 + 1) + (B + C)(1 - 1)\n\n3 = 3A\n\nA = 1\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 2) / (z^3 - 1) at z = 1 is 1."
