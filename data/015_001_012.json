    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to numerically integrate the Lorenz system of equations, which are given by:\n\ndx/dt = σ * (y - x)\ndy/dt = x * (r - z) - y\ndz/dt = x * y - b * z\n\nwhere σ, r, and b are the parameters of the system, and x, y, and z are the variables we want to find after 100 time units.\n\nWe can use a numerical integration method, such as the Runge-Kutta 4th order method, to approximate the values of x, y, and z after 100 time units. Here's a Python code to do that:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef lorenz_system(state, t, sigma, rho, beta):\n    x, y, z = state\n    dx_dt = sigma * (y - x)\n    dy_dt = x * (rho - z) - y\n    dz_dt = x * y - beta * z\n    return np.array([dx_dt, dy_dt, dz_dt])\n\ndef runge_kutta_4th_order(func, state, t, dt, sigma, rho, beta):\n    k1 = dt * func(state, t, sigma, rho, beta)\n    k2 = dt * func(state + 0.5 * k1, t + 0.5 * dt, sigma, rho, beta)\n    k3 = dt * func(state + 0.5 * k2, t + 0.5 * dt, sigma, rho, beta)\n    k4 = dt * func(state + k3, t + dt, sigma, rho, beta)\n    return state + (k1 + 2 * k2 + 2 * k3 + k4) / 6\n\n# Parameters\nsigma = 10\nrho = 28\nbeta = 8 / 3\ninitial_state = np.array([0, 1, 0])\nt = 0\ndt = 0.01\ntotal_time = 100\n\n# Numerical integration\nstate = initial_state\nfor _ in np.arange(0, total_time, dt):\n    state = runge_kutta_4th_order(lorenz_system, state, t, dt, sigma, rho, beta)\n    t += dt\n\nprint(\"x =\", state[0])\nprint(\"y =\", state[1])\nprint(\"z =\", state[2])\n```\n\nPlease note that the results may vary slightly depending on the numerical integration method, step size, and other factors. The above code should give you a good approximation of the x, y, and z values after 100 time units."
