    "message_2": "To calculate the ciphertext produced by the Rail Fence Cipher, we need the actual plaintext message. However, I can explain the process of encrypting a message using the Rail Fence Cipher with a key of 4.\n\n1. Write down the plaintext message in a zigzag pattern with 4 rows.\n2. Read the ciphertext from left to right, starting from the top row and moving down to the bottom row.\n\nFor example, let's consider the plaintext message \"THISISARAILFENCECIPHERWITHAKEYOFFOUR\":\n\n1. Write the message in a zigzag pattern with 4 rows:\n\nT     I     E     T     F\n H   S S   A L   N E   I H\n  I I   A I F   C P   R W\n   S     R C     E Y     O\n\n2. Read the ciphertext from left to right, starting from the top row and moving down to the bottom row:\n\nCiphertext: TIETFHSSALNEIHIIAIFCPRWSRCEYO\n\nSo, the ciphertext produced by the Rail Fence Cipher for the given plaintext message with a key of 4 is \"TIETFHSSALNEIHIIAIFCPRWSRCEYO\"."
