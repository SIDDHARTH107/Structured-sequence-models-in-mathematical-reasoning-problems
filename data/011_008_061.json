    "message_2": "The Stirling number of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represents the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. The formula for the Stirling number of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the value of S(5, 3) as follows:\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\n\nTo find S(4, 3) and S(4, 2), we can use the same formula:\n\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2)\nS(4, 2) = 2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1)\n\nNow, we need to find S(3, 3), S(3, 2), and S(3, 1):\n\nS(3, 3) = 3 * S(2, 3) + S(2, 2)\nS(3, 2) = 2 * S(2, 2) + S(2, 1)\nS(3, 1) = 1 * S(2, 1) + S(2, 0)\n\nFor n = 2, the values are:\n\nS(2, 3) = 0 (since k > n)\nS(2, 2) = 1\nS(2, 1) = 1\nS(2, 0) = 0 (since k = 0 and n > 0)\n\nNow we can substitute these values back into the equations:\n\nS(3, 3) = 3 * 0 + 1 = 1\nS(3, 2) = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3\nS(3, 1) = 1 * 1 + 0 = 1\n\nSubstitute these values back into the equations for S(4, 3) and S(4, 2):\n\nS(4, 3) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\nS(4, 2) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\n\nFinally, substitute these values back into the equation for S(5, 3):\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25\n\nSo, the Stirling number of the second kind for n = 5 and k = 3 is 25."
