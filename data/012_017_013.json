    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that each vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex, and no two edges share a vertex. In other words, it's a way to pair up the vertices so that each pair is connected by an edge.\n\nFor a graph to have a perfect matching, it must have an even number of vertices. Since the given graph has 7 vertices, which is an odd number, there are no perfect matchings in this graph."
