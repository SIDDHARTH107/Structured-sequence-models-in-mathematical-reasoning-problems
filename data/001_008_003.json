    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 6 > 9, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 6 from both sides of the inequality:\n   3x + 6 - 6 > 9 - 6\n   3x > 3\n\n2. Divide both sides by 3:\n   3x/3 > 3/3\n   x > 1\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x > 1. \n\nTo graph the solution on a number line:\n\n1. Draw a number line with numbers from -2 to 3 (or more if you prefer).\n2. Locate the number 1 on the number line.\n3. Since x > 1, we want all the numbers greater than 1. Make an open circle at 1 (to indicate that 1 is not included in the solution) and draw an arrow pointing to the right (towards the greater numbers).\n\nThe graph will look like this:\n\n```\n----(----)----)----)----)----)\n-2    -1    0    1    2    3\n```\n\nThe open circle at 1 and the arrow pointing to the right represent the solution x > 1."
