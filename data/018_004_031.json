    "message_2": "To find the complement of sets A and B, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Let's assume the universal set U contains the elements from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. \n\nNow, we can find the complement of sets A and B with respect to the universal set U.\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted by A', is the set of elements in U that are not in A. So, A' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nThe complement of set B, denoted by B', is the set of elements in U that are not in B. So, B' = {3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nTo prove that the complement of these two sets is unique, we need to show that for any other set C with the same elements as A or B, the complement of C will be the same as the complement of A or B.\n\nLet's assume there is another set C with the same elements as A or B. There are two cases:\n\n1. If C has the same elements as A, then C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The complement of C, denoted by C', is the set of elements in U that are not in C. So, C' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, which is the same as A'.\n\n2. If C has the same elements as B, then C = {1, 2, 6, 7}. The complement of C, denoted by C', is the set of elements in U that are not in C. So, C' = {3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10}, which is the same as B'.\n\nIn both cases, the complement of set C is the same as the complement of sets A and B. Therefore, the complement of these two sets is unique."
