Find the truth value of the propositions: \n\n1. $(p \\land \\lnot q)$\n2. $(p \\lor \\lnot q)$\n3. $(p \\land q) \\rightarrow p$\n4. $(q \\rightarrow p) \\lor (\\lnot p \\rightarrow q)$",
    "message_2": "Given that $p$ is true and $q$ is false, let's find the truth value of the given propositions:\n\n1. $(p \\land \\lnot q)$\n   Since $p$ is true and $q$ is false, $\\lnot q$ is true. Therefore, $(p \\land \\lnot q)$ is true because both $p$ and $\\lnot q$ are true.\n\n2. $(p \\lor \\lnot q)$\n   Since $p$ is true and $\\lnot q$ is true, $(p \\lor \\lnot q)$ is true because at least one of $p$ or $\\lnot q$ is true.\n\n3. $(p \\land q) \\rightarrow p$\n   Since $p$ is true and $q$ is false, $(p \\land q)$ is false. In a material implication, if the antecedent (the part before the arrow) is false, the implication is always true. Therefore, $(p \\land q) \\rightarrow p$ is true.\n\n4. $(q \\rightarrow p) \\lor (\\lnot p \\rightarrow q)$\n   Since $q$ is false and $p$ is true, $(q \\rightarrow p)$ is true (because the antecedent is false). Also, since $p$ is true, $\\lnot p$ is false, and thus $(\\lnot p \\rightarrow q)$ is true (because the antecedent is false). Therefore, $(q \\rightarrow p) \\lor (\\lnot p \\rightarrow q)$ is true because both parts of the disjunction are true.\n\nIn summary, the truth values of the propositions are:\n\n1. True\n2. True\n3. True\n4. True"
