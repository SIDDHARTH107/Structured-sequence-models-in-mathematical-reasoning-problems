Determine the dimension of the vector space $H^1(C,\\mathbb{Q})$, where $H^1(C,\\mathbb{Q})$ is the first cohomology group of $C$ with coefficients in the rational numbers.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the vector space $H^1(C, \\mathbb{Q})$, we can use the genus-degree formula for algebraic curves. The genus-degree formula relates the genus $g$ of a smooth projective curve to the degree $d$ of the curve in the projective plane:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$\n\nIn our case, the curve $C$ is given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 2$. This is a cubic curve, so $d = 3$. Plugging this into the genus-degree formula, we get:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$\n\nNow, for a smooth projective curve of genus $g$, the dimension of the first cohomology group $H^1(C, \\mathbb{Q})$ is equal to $2g$. In our case, since $g = 1$, we have:\n\n$\\dim H^1(C, \\mathbb{Q}) = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$\n\nSo the dimension of the vector space $H^1(C, \\mathbb{Q})$ is 2."
