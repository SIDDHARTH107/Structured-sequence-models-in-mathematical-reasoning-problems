    "message_1": "In a theater performance, there are 20 actors competing for 3 lead roles. If the director selects the lead roles randomly, what is the probability that a specific actor will be chosen for at least one of the lead roles?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability that a specific actor will be chosen for at least one of the lead roles, we can find the probability that the actor will not be chosen for any of the lead roles and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThere are 20 actors and 3 lead roles, so there are 20 - 3 = 17 non-lead roles.\n\nThe probability that the specific actor will not be chosen for the first lead role is 19/20 (since there are 19 other actors). If the actor is not chosen for the first lead role, there are 18 actors left for the second lead role. So, the probability that the actor will not be chosen for the second lead role, given that they were not chosen for the first lead role, is 18/19. Similarly, the probability that the actor will not be chosen for the third lead role, given that they were not chosen for the first two lead roles, is 17/18.\n\nThe probability that the actor will not be chosen for any of the lead roles is the product of these probabilities:\n\nP(not chosen for any lead role) = (19/20) * (18/19) * (17/18) = 17/20\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(chosen for at least one lead role) = 1 - P(not chosen for any lead role) = 1 - (17/20) = 3/20\n\nSo, the probability that a specific actor will be chosen for at least one of the lead roles is 3/20 or 0.15 (15%)."
