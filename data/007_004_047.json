    "message_2": "The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 120 and 90 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm or by listing the factors of each number and finding the largest common factor.\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n1. Divide 120 by 90, the remainder is 30.\n2. Divide 90 by 30, the remainder is 0.\n3. The last non-zero remainder is 30.\n\nSo, the GCD of 120 and 90 is 30."
