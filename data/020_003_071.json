    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The production of A requires 2 hours of labor and 4 units of resources, while the production of B requires 5 hours of labor and 6 units of resources. The company has 100 hours of labor and 120 units of resources available. The profit for each unit of A is $20 and for each unit of B is $30. How many units of A and B should the company produce to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal combination of units of A and B that the company should produce, given the constraints on labor and resources.\n\nLet x be the number of units of A and y be the number of units of B.\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n\nLabor constraint: 2x + 5y ≤ 100\nResource constraint: 4x + 6y ≤ 120\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 20x + 30y\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint equations for y:\n\nLabor constraint: y ≤ (100 - 2x) / 5\nResource constraint: y ≤ (120 - 4x) / 6\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by plotting these constraints on a graph:\n\n1. For the labor constraint, the line 2x + 5y = 100 intersects the x-axis at x = 50 (when y = 0) and the y-axis at y = 20 (when x = 0).\n\n2. For the resource constraint, the line 4x + 6y = 120 intersects the x-axis at x = 30 (when y = 0) and the y-axis at y = 20 (when x = 0).\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (50, 0), (30, 0), and (0, 20).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0): 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (50, 0): 20(50) + 30(0) = $1000\n3. Profit at (30, 0): 20(30) + 30(0) = $600\n4. Profit at (0, 20): 20(0) + 30(20) = $600\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (50, 0), with a profit of $1000. Therefore, the company should produce 50 units of A and 0 units of B to maximize the profit."
