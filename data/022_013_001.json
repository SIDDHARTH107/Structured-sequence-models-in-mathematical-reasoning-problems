    "message_2": "To find the zeros of $f(z)$ inside the circle $C$, we first find the zeros of $f(z)$ and then check if they are inside the circle.\n\nThe zeros of $f(z)$ can be found by setting $f(z) = 0$:\n\n$z^2 - 3z + 2 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n$(z - 1)(z - 2) = 0$\n\nSo the zeros of $f(z)$ are $z = 1$ and $z = 2$.\n\nNow we need to check if these zeros are inside the circle $C$. The circle $C$ has a center at $z = 1+i$ and a radius of 2. The distance between a point $z = a + bi$ and the center of the circle is given by:\n\n$|z - (1+i)| = |(a-1) + (b-1)i| = \\sqrt{(a-1)^2 + (b-1)^2}$\n\nFor $z = 1$, we have $a = 1$ and $b = 0$. The distance between $z = 1$ and the center of the circle is:\n\n$|1 - (1+i)| = \\sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (0-1)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 1} = 1$\n\nSince the distance is less than the radius of the circle (2), $z = 1$ is inside the circle $C$.\n\nFor $z = 2$, we have $a = 2$ and $b = 0$. The distance between $z = 2$ and the center of the circle is:\n\n$|2 - (1+i)| = \\sqrt{(2-1)^2 + (0-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}$\n\nSince the distance is also less than the radius of the circle (2), $z = 2$ is inside the circle $C$.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 2 zeros of $f(z)$ inside the circle $C$."
