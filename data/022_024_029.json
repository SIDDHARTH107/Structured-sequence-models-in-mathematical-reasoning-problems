    "message_1": "Sure, here is a numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose that the temperature distribution on a circular metal plate can be described by the function $u(r,\\theta)$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the center of the plate and $\\theta$ is the angular coordinate. The temperature at the boundary of the plate is held constant at $100^\\circ$ Celsius, and the initial temperature distribution is given by $u(r,0) = 50 - 50r^2$ for $0 \\leq r \\leq 1$.\n\n(a) Use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to show that $f(z) = u(z) + iv(z)$ is analytic in the open unit disk $D = \\{ z : |z| < 1 \\}$.\n\n(b) Find the harmonic conjugate $v(z)$ of $u(z)$, and write $f(z)$ in the form $f(z) = \\phi(re^{i\\theta})e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\phi(r) = |f(re^{i\\theta})|$.\n\n(c) Use separation of variables to solve the heat equation $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial r^2}$ subject to the initial condition given above, and express the solution in terms of a Fourier series.\n\n(d) Using your solution from part (c), find the temperature distribution $u(r,\\theta,t)$ on the plate at time $t$.\n\n(e) Determine whether the temperature at the center of the plate is increasing or decreasing with time, and explain why.",
    "message_2": "(a) To show that $f(z) = u(z) + iv(z)$ is analytic in the open unit disk $D = \\{ z : |z| < 1 \\}$, we need to show that the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are given by:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\theta}$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\theta} = -r \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial r}$\n\nSince $u(r, \\theta)$ is a harmonic function (i.e., it satisfies Laplace's equation), we know that:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0$\n\nNow, we can differentiate the Cauchy-Riemann equations with respect to $r$ and $\\theta$, respectively, and substitute the expressions for the second derivatives of $u$ from Laplace's equation. This will show that the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied, and hence $f(z)$ is analytic in the open unit disk $D$.\n\n(b) To find the harmonic conjugate $v(z)$ of $u(z)$, we can integrate the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Integrating the first equation with respect to $\\theta$ and the second equation with respect to $r$, we get:\n\n$v(r, \\theta) = \\int \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\theta} dr = \\int \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} dr = -50r + C(\\theta)$\n\n$v(r, \\theta) = -\\int r \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial r} d\\theta = \\int \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\theta} d\\theta = 0 + D(r)$\n\nCombining these expressions, we have:\n\n$v(r, \\theta) = -50r + C(\\theta) + D(r)$\n\nSince $v(r, \\theta)$ must be single-valued and satisfy the boundary conditions, we can set $C(\\theta) = 0$ and $D(r) = 0$. Thus, the harmonic conjugate is:\n\n$v(r, \\theta) = -50r$\n\nNow, we can write $f(z)$ in the desired form:\n\n$f(z) = u(r, \\theta) + iv(r, \\theta) = (50 - 50r^2) + i(-50r)$\n\n$f(z) = 50(1 - r^2) - 50ri$\n\n$f(z) = 50re^{i\\theta}(1 - r)e^{i\\theta} - 50re^{i\\theta}ie^{i\\theta}$\n\n$f(z) = \\phi(re^{i\\theta})e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\phi(r) = 50r(1 - r)$\n\n(c) To solve the heat equation using separation of variables, we assume a solution of the form:\n\n$u(r, \\theta, t) = R(r) \\Theta(\\theta) T(t)$\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation and dividing by $R(r) \\Theta(\\theta) T(t)$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{k} \\frac{T'}{T} = \\frac{R''}{R} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{R'}{R} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\Theta''}{\\Theta}$\n\nSince the left-hand side is a function of $t$ only and the right-hand side is a function of $r$ and $\\theta$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$. This gives us three ordinary differential equations:\n\n$T'(t) = -k\\lambda^2 T(t)$\n\n$R''(r) + \\frac{1}{r} R'(r) - \\lambda^2 R(r) = 0$\n\n$\\Theta''(\\theta) + \\lambda^2 \\Theta(\\theta) = 0$\n\nSolving these equations and applying the initial and boundary conditions, we can express the solution as a Fourier series:\n\n$u(r, \\theta, t) = 50 - 50r^2 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n r^n \\cos(n\\theta)e^{-kn^2t}$\n\n(d) The temperature distribution $u(r, \\theta, t)$ on the plate at time $t$ is given by the solution found in part (c):\n\n$u(r, \\theta, t) = 50 - 50r^2 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n r^n \\cos(n\\theta)e^{-kn^2t}$\n\n(e) To determine whether the temperature at the center of the plate is increasing or decreasing with time, we can evaluate the time derivative of $u(r, \\theta, t)$ at $r = 0$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(0, \\theta, t) = -\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n kn^2 e^{-kn^2t}$\n\nSince the coefficients $A_n$ and the exponential terms are all non-negative, the sum is negative, which means that the temperature at the center of the plate is decreasing with time. This is expected, as heat is being conducted away from the center towards the boundary, where the temperature is held constant at a higher value."
