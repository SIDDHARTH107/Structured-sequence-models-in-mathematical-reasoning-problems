    "message_1": "In a certain region, the probability of a hurricane occurring in a given year is 0.15. If there are 50 years in a given time period, what is the probability that a hurricane will occur at least once during that time period?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability concept. The complementary probability of an event occurring is the probability of the event not occurring. In this case, the complementary probability is the probability of a hurricane not occurring in a given year.\n\nThe probability of a hurricane not occurring in a given year is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of a hurricane not occurring in all 50 years. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities together:\n\n0.85^50 ≈ 0.00000224\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability of this event, which is the probability of a hurricane occurring at least once in the 50-year period:\n\n1 - 0.00000224 ≈ 0.99999776\n\nSo, the probability of a hurricane occurring at least once during the 50-year time period is approximately 0.99999776, or 99.999776%."
