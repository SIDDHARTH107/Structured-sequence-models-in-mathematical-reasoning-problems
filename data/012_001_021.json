    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 using Dijkstra's algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance to the starting node (node 1) to 0 and the distance to all other nodes to infinity.\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance that has not been visited yet (in this case, node 1).\n3. Update the distances to all neighboring nodes by adding the distance to the current node and the weight of the edge connecting them. If the new distance is smaller than the current distance, update the distance.\n4. Mark the current node as visited.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all nodes have been visited or the target node (node 5) has been visited.\n\nLet's go through the algorithm step by step:\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: ∞, 3: ∞, 4: ∞, 5: ∞}\n\n2. Select node 1 (smallest distance, 0).\n3. Update distances:\n   - Node 2: 0 + 8 = 8\n   - Node 3: 0 + 5 = 5\n   - Node 4: 0 + 12 = 12\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 8, 3: 5, 4: 12, 5: ∞}\n4. Mark node 1 as visited: {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n2. Select node 3 (smallest distance, 5).\n3. Update distances:\n   - Node 4: 5 + 2 = 7 (smaller than 12)\n   - Node 5: 5 + 3 = 8\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 8, 3: 5, 4: 7, 5: 8}\n4. Mark node 3 as visited: {2, 4, 5}\n\n2. Select node 4 (smallest distance, 7).\n3. Update distances:\n   - Node 2: 7 + 3 = 10 (larger than 8, no update)\n   - Node 5: 7 + 4 = 11 (larger than 8, no update)\n   Distances: {1: 0, 2: 8, 3: 5, 4: 7, 5: 8}\n4. Mark node 4 as visited: {2, 5}\n\n2. Select node 2 (smallest distance, 8).\n3. Update distances: (no neighbors to update)\n4. Mark node 2 as visited: {5}\n\n2. Select node 5 (smallest distance, 8).\n4. Mark node 5 as visited: {}\n\nThe algorithm is now complete, and the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 has a distance of 8. To find the path itself, we can backtrack from node 5:\n\n- Node 5 has a distance of 8, which was updated from node 3 (5 + 3 = 8).\n- Node 3 has a distance of 5, which was updated from node 1 (0 + 5 = 5).\n\nSo, the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is 1 → 3 → 5."
