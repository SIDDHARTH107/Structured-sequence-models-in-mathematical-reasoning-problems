    "message_2": "To encrypt the message M = 15 using the RSA algorithm with p = 7, q = 11, and e = 13, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n2. Compute the totient function φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\n3. Choose a public exponent e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1 (already given as e = 13)\n4. Encrypt the message M using the formula C = M^e mod n\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. n = p * q = 7 * 11 = 77\n2. φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = (7 - 1) * (11 - 1) = 6 * 10 = 60\n3. e = 13 (already given)\n4. C = M^e mod n = 15^13 mod 77\n\nNow we need to calculate 15^13 mod 77. We can use the fast exponentiation method (also known as \"exponentiation by squaring\"):\n\n15^1 mod 77 = 15\n15^2 mod 77 = (15^1 * 15^1) mod 77 = 225 mod 77 = 21\n15^4 mod 77 = (15^2 * 15^2) mod 77 = 21 * 21 mod 77 = 441 mod 77 = 49\n15^8 mod 77 = (15^4 * 15^4) mod 77 = 49 * 49 mod 77 = 2401 mod 77 = 1\n\nNow we can compute 15^13 mod 77:\n15^13 mod 77 = (15^8 * 15^4 * 15^1) mod 77 = (1 * 49 * 15) mod 77 = 735 mod 77 = 42\n\nSo, the ciphertext C is 42."
