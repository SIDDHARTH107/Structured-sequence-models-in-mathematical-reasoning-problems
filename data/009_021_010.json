    "message_1": "Consider the 2-dimensional heat equation defined as:\n\n∂u/∂t = k (∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nwhere u(x,y,t) is the temperature at a point (x,y) in a 2D space at time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity of the material. \n\nSuppose a rectangular metal sheet is initially at a temperature given by:\n\nu(x,y,0) = 100 - 50(x/L) - 20(y/W)\n\nwhere L and W denote the length and width of the sheet in meters, respectively. If the edges of the sheet are insulated and there is no heat flow through them, find the temperature u(x,y,t) at any point (x,y) of the sheet at time t = 30 seconds, assuming k = 0.05 m²/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution u(x, y, t) can be written as a product of functions of x, y, and t:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)dT(t)/dt = k(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y))T(t)\n\nNow, we divide both sides by kXYT:\n\n(1/k) * (dT/dt) / T = (X''/X + Y''/Y)\n\nSince the left side is a function of t only and the right side is a function of x and y only, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\n(1/k) * (dT/dt) / T = -λ\nX''/X + Y''/Y = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX'' - λX = 0\nY'' - λY = 0\n\nWe will solve these equations with the boundary conditions that the edges of the sheet are insulated, which means that the temperature gradient at the edges is zero:\n\n∂u/∂x(0, y, t) = ∂u/∂x(L, y, t) = 0\n∂u/∂y(x, 0, t) = ∂u/∂y(x, W, t) = 0\n\nSince u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t), the boundary conditions become:\n\nX'(0) = X'(L) = 0\nY'(0) = Y'(W) = 0\n\nThe general solutions for X(x) and Y(y) are:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(√λx) + B*sin(√λx)\nY(y) = C*cos(√λy) + D*sin(√λy)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nX'(0) = 0 => B = 0\nX'(L) = 0 => A*cos(√λL) = 0\n\nFor non-trivial solutions, A ≠ 0, so cos(√λL) = 0. This implies that √λL = (2n+1)π/2 for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nSimilarly, for Y(y):\n\nY'(0) = 0 => D = 0\nY'(W) = 0 => C*cos(√λW) = 0\n\nFor non-trivial solutions, C ≠ 0, so cos(√λW) = 0. This implies that √λW = (2m+1)π/2 for m = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nNow, we can write the separated solutions as:\n\nu_n_m(x, y, t) = X_n(x)Y_m(y)T_n_m(t) = cos((2n+1)πx/2L) * cos((2m+1)πy/2W) * T_n_m(t)\n\nWe need to find the coefficients T_n_m(t) and the initial condition:\n\nu(x, y, 0) = 100 - 50(x/L) - 20(y/W)\n\nWe can expand the initial condition in terms of the separated solutions using a double Fourier cosine series:\n\n100 - 50(x/L) - 20(y/W) = Σ Σ A_n_m * cos((2n+1)πx/2L) * cos((2m+1)πy/2W)\n\nWe can find the coefficients A_n_m by multiplying both sides by cos((2p+1)πx/2L) * cos((2q+1)πy/2W) and integrating over the domain:\n\nA_p_q = (4/LW) * ∫∫ (100 - 50(x/L) - 20(y/W)) * cos((2p+1)πx/2L) * cos((2q+1)πy/2W) dx dy\n\nNow, we need to solve the time-dependent part of the equation:\n\n(1/k) * (dT_n_m/dt) / T_n_m = -λ_n_m\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\nT_n_m(t) = T_n_m(0) * exp(-kλ_n_m*t)\n\nFinally, the solution u(x, y, t) is given by the sum of the separated solutions:\n\nu(x, y, t) = Σ Σ A_n_m * cos((2n+1)πx/2L) * cos((2m+1)πy/2W) * exp(-kλ_n_m*t)\n\nTo find the temperature at time t = 30 seconds, we can plug in the values of k, L, and W, and compute the sum up to a certain number of terms (e.g., 10 terms in each direction) to get an approximate solution."
