    "message_1": "A weather forecasting center predicts that the probability of rainfall on a particular day in a city is 0.6. What is the probability that it will not rain on that day?",
    "message_2": "The probability of an event not occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event occurring. In this case, the probability of rainfall is 0.6. Therefore, the probability of it not raining on that day is:\n\n1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n\nSo, the probability that it will not rain on that day is 0.4 or 40%."
