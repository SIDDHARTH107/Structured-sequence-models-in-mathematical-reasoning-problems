    "message_2": "To find the median of a dataset, first, arrange the numbers in ascending order, which is already done in this case. Then, find the middle value. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\nIn this dataset, there are 11 values, which is an odd number. The middle value is the 6th value, which is 15. Therefore, the median of this dataset is 15."
