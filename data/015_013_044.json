    "message_2": "To find the population at time n=10, we need to iterate the logistic equation 10 times with the given initial population and growth parameter.\n\nInitial population (x0) = 0.5\nGrowth parameter (r) = 3.2\n\nLet's calculate the population for each time step:\n\nx1 = r * x0 * (1 - x0) = 3.2 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.8\nx2 = r * x1 * (1 - x1) = 3.2 * 0.8 * (1 - 0.8) = 0.512\nx3 = r * x2 * (1 - x2) = 3.2 * 0.512 * (1 - 0.512) ≈ 0.7997\nx4 = r * x3 * (1 - x3) = 3.2 * 0.7997 * (1 - 0.7997) ≈ 0.5126\nx5 = r * x4 * (1 - x4) = 3.2 * 0.5126 * (1 - 0.5126) ≈ 0.7994\nx6 = r * x5 * (1 - x5) = 3.2 * 0.7994 * (1 - 0.7994) ≈ 0.5132\nx7 = r * x6 * (1 - x6) = 3.2 * 0.5132 * (1 - 0.5132) ≈ 0.7991\nx8 = r * x7 * (1 - x7) = 3.2 * 0.7991 * (1 - 0.7991) ≈ 0.5139\nx9 = r * x8 * (1 - x8) = 3.2 * 0.5139 * (1 - 0.5139) ≈ 0.7988\nx10 = r * x9 * (1 - x9) = 3.2 * 0.7988 * (1 - 0.7988) ≈ 0.5145\n\nSo, the population at time n=10 is approximately 0.5145."
