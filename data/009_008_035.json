    "message_2": "To find the general solution for the wave equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T''(t) = 16X''(x)T(t)$$\n\nDivide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 16\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$$\n\nSince the left side is a function of $t$ only and the right side is a function of $x$ only, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let this constant be $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n$$16\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$T''(t) + \\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$$\n$$X''(x) + \\frac{\\lambda^2}{16} X(x) = 0$$\n\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(\\frac{\\lambda}{4}x) + B\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda}{4}x)$$\n\nThe general solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$$T(t) = C\\cos(\\lambda t) + D\\sin(\\lambda t)$$\n\nThus, the general solution for $u(x, t)$ is:\n\n$$u(x, t) = (A\\cos(\\frac{\\lambda}{4}x) + B\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda}{4}x))(C\\cos(\\lambda t) + D\\sin(\\lambda t))$$\n\nNow we apply the initial conditions:\n\n1) $u(x, 0) = \\cos(\\pi x)$:\n\n$$u(x, 0) = (A\\cos(\\frac{\\lambda}{4}x) + B\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda}{4}x))C$$\n\nSince this must hold for all $x$, we can deduce that $\\frac{\\lambda}{4} = \\pi$, so $\\lambda = 4\\pi$. Also, $A = 1$, $B = 0$, and $C = 1$. Thus, the solution becomes:\n\n$$u(x, t) = \\cos(4\\pi x)(\\cos(4\\pi t) + D\\sin(4\\pi t))$$\n\n2) $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = 2\\sin(\\pi x)$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = -16\\pi^2\\cos(4\\pi x)D\\sin(4\\pi t)$$\n\nAt $t=0$, the sine term vanishes, so we cannot determine $D$ from this initial condition. However, we can still write the general solution as:\n\n$$u(x, t) = \\cos(4\\pi x)(\\cos(4\\pi t) + D\\sin(4\\pi t))$$\n\nNow we can plot this function for different values of $t$ using a software tool like Python with Matplotlib or Wolfram Alpha. Note that the value of $D$ will affect the shape of the plot, so you can experiment with different values of $D$ to see how it changes the wave function."
