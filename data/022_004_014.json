    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion for the complex function f(z) = (1+z)/(z^2 + 1) centered at z = i, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z - i). We can do this by factoring the denominator and using partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = (1+z)/((z-i)(z+i))\n\nNow we can rewrite the function as a sum of two simpler functions:\n\nA/(z-i) + B/(z+i)\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we clear the denominators:\n\n(1+z) = A(z+i) + B(z-i)\n\nNow we can solve for A and B by substituting z = i and z = -i:\n\nFor z = i:\n1 + i = A(2i) + B(0)\nA = (1+i)/2\n\nFor z = -i:\n1 - i = A(0) + B(-2i)\nB = (1-i)/2\n\nNow we have:\n\nf(z) = ((1+i)/2)/(z-i) + ((1-i)/2)/(z+i)\n\nNow we can find the Laurent series expansion for each term:\n\nFor the first term, ((1+i)/2)/(z-i), we can use the geometric series formula:\n\n((1+i)/2)/(z-i) = (1+i)/2 * 1/(1 - (z-i)/i)\n= (1+i)/2 * 1/(1 - (1/i)(z-i))\n= (1+i)/2 * ∑[((1/i)(z-i))^n] for |(z-i)/i| < 1\n\nFor the second term, ((1-i)/2)/(z+i), we can use the geometric series formula:\n\n((1-i)/2)/(z+i) = (1-i)/2 * 1/(1 - (z+i)/(-i))\n= (1-i)/2 * 1/(1 - (1/-i)(z+i))\n= (1-i)/2 * ∑[((1/-i)(z+i))^n] for |(z+i)/(-i)| < 1\n\nNow we can combine the two series:\n\nf(z) = (1+i)/2 * ∑[((1/i)(z-i))^n] + (1-i)/2 * ∑[((1/-i)(z+i))^n]\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion for f(z) centered at z = i.\n\nTo find the residue for the singular point at z = i, we need to find the coefficient of the (z-i)^(-1) term in the Laurent series expansion. In this case, the residue is simply the constant term A:\n\nResidue = (1+i)/2"
