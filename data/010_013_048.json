    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic (χ) of a topological space is a topological invariant that describes the shape or structure of the space. It is defined as the alternating sum of the number of cells in each dimension of the space's cell decomposition.\n\nThe Möbius band is a non-orientable surface with boundary, and it can be represented as a quotient space of a square with opposite edges identified with a twist. To find the Euler characteristic of the Möbius band, we can use the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nSince the Möbius band is a non-trivial line bundle over the circle, we can think of it as a \"twisted\" cylinder. The circle (base space) has one vertex and one edge, and the Möbius band (total space) has one face. Therefore, we have:\n\nV = 1 (the vertex of the circle)\nE = 1 (the edge of the circle)\nF = 1 (the face of the Möbius band)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nχ = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the Möbius band given as a non-trivial line bundle over the circle is 1."
