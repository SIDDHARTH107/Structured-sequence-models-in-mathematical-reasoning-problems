    "message_2": "1. To find the membership degree of (0.4, 0.6) in set A, we need to interpolate between the two closest points in set A. The two closest points are (0.2, 0.4) and (0.5, 0.8). Using linear interpolation, we can calculate the membership degree as follows:\n\nMembership degree = (0.6 - 0.4) / (0.5 - 0.2) * (0.4 - 0.2) + 0.4\nMembership degree = (0.2 / 0.3) * 0.2 + 0.4\nMembership degree = 0.5333\n\nSo, the membership degree of (0.4, 0.6) in set A is approximately 0.5333.\n\n2. To find the membership degree of (0.5, 0.6) in set B, we need to interpolate between the two closest points in set B. The two closest points are (0.3, 0.6) and (0.7, 1). Using linear interpolation, we can calculate the membership degree as follows:\n\nMembership degree = (1 - 0.6) / (0.7 - 0.3) * (0.5 - 0.3) + 0.6\nMembership degree = (0.4 / 0.4) * 0.2 + 0.6\nMembership degree = 1 * 0.2 + 0.6\nMembership degree = 0.8\n\nSo, the membership degree of (0.5, 0.6) in set B is 0.8.\n\n3. To find the membership degree of (0.3, 0.9) in the intersection of sets A and B, we first need to find the membership degree of (0.3, 0.9) in both sets A and B. \n\nFor set A, the two closest points are (0.2, 0.4) and (0.5, 0.8). Using linear interpolation:\n\nMembership degree in A = (0.9 - 0.4) / (0.5 - 0.2) * (0.3 - 0.2) + 0.4\nMembership degree in A = (0.5 / 0.3) * 0.1 + 0.4\nMembership degree in A = 0.4667\n\nFor set B, the membership degree of (0.3, 0.9) is 0.6, as it is one of the points in set B.\n\nNow, to find the intersection of sets A and B, we take the minimum of the membership degrees of (0.3, 0.9) in sets A and B:\n\nIntersection membership degree = min(0.4667, 0.6)\nIntersection membership degree = 0.4667\n\nSo, the membership degree of (0.3, 0.9) in the intersection of sets A and B is approximately 0.4667."
