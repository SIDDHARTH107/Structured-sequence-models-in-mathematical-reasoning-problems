    "message_2": "1. Determine the critical points of the function.\n\nTo find the critical points, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 + 3y^2 - 6x + 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 6xy - 6y$\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$3x^2 + 3y^2 - 6x + 2 = 0$\n\n$6xy - 6y = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we can factor out $6y$:\n\n$6y(x - 1) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possibilities: $y = 0$ or $x = 1$.\n\nCase 1: $y = 0$\n\nSubstitute $y = 0$ into the first equation:\n\n$3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve for $x$:\n\n$x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2}}{2 \\cdot 3}$\n\n$x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{6}$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for $x$ in this case.\n\nCase 2: $x = 1$\n\nSubstitute $x = 1$ into the first equation:\n\n$3 + 3y^2 - 6 + 2 = 0$\n\n$3y^2 - 1 = 0$\n\n$y^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n$y = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nSo, the critical points are $(1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$ and $(1, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$.\n\n2. Use the Morse theory to compute the number of critical points for the function.\n\nMorse theory is a tool used in differential topology to study differentiable functions on smooth manifolds. It relates the topology of the manifold to the critical points of the function. However, in this case, we have already found the critical points explicitly, so Morse theory is not necessary.\n\nThe number of critical points for the function $f(x,y)$ is 2, namely $(1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$ and $(1, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$."
