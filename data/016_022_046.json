    "message_1": "In constructing a Sierpinski pyramid, each of the four smaller pyramids is obtained by cutting an equal size pyramid from the corners of the original pyramid. If the original pyramid had a height of 8 cm and a base edge of 12 cm, what would be the height and base edge of the smallest of the four pyramids?",
    "message_2": "When constructing a Sierpinski pyramid, the four smaller pyramids are similar to the original pyramid, and their dimensions are half of the original pyramid's dimensions.\n\nSo, for the smallest of the four pyramids:\n\nHeight = (1/2) * 8 cm = 4 cm\nBase edge = (1/2) * 12 cm = 6 cm\n\nThe height of the smallest pyramid is 4 cm, and the base edge is 6 cm."
