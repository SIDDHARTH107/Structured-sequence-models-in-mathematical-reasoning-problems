    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces ball bearings and the probability of a certain type of defect occurring in a single ball bearing is 0.05. \nIf a customer purchases a pack of 100 ball bearings, what is the probability that at least 5 ball bearings will have this defect?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 5 ball bearings having the defect, we can use the complement rule. The complement of \"at least 5 ball bearings have the defect\" is \"4 or fewer ball bearings have the defect.\" We will find the probability of the complement and then subtract it from 1 to find the probability of at least 5 ball bearings having the defect.\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula for this problem:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of ball bearings), k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of defective ball bearings), p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a ball bearing being defective), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nFirst, we'll find the probability of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 defective ball bearings:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (1-0.05)^(100-0)\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (1-0.05)^(100-1)\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * (0.05)^2 * (1-0.05)^(100-2)\nP(X = 3) = C(100, 3) * (0.05)^3 * (1-0.05)^(100-3)\nP(X = 4) = C(100, 4) * (0.05)^4 * (1-0.05)^(100-4)\n\nNext, we'll add these probabilities together to find the probability of 4 or fewer defective ball bearings:\n\nP(X ≤ 4) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)\n\nFinally, we'll use the complement rule to find the probability of at least 5 defective ball bearings:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(X ≤ 4)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.00592\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.03116\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.08118\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.13982\nP(X = 4) ≈ 0.17814\n\nP(X ≤ 4) ≈ 0.00592 + 0.03116 + 0.08118 + 0.13982 + 0.17814 ≈ 0.43622\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(X ≤ 4) ≈ 1 - 0.43622 ≈ 0.56378\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 ball bearings will have the defect is approximately 0.56378 or 56.38%."
