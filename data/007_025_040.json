    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key in the Diffie-Hellman protocol, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes her public key (A) using the formula A = g^a mod p.\n2. Bob computes his public key (B) using the formula B = g^b mod p.\n3. Alice and Bob exchange their public keys.\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key (S) using the formula S = B^a mod p.\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key (S) using the formula S = A^b mod p.\n\nLet's calculate the shared secret key:\n\n1. Alice's public key (A):\nA = g^a mod p\nA = 3^7 mod 17\nA = 2187 mod 17\nA = 10\n\n2. Bob's public key (B):\nB = g^b mod p\nB = 3^5 mod 17\nB = 243 mod 17\nB = 12\n\n3. Alice and Bob exchange their public keys (A=10, B=12).\n\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key (S):\nS = B^a mod p\nS = 12^7 mod 17\nS = 35831808 mod 17\nS = 3\n\n5. Bob computes the shared secret key (S):\nS = A^b mod p\nS = 10^5 mod 17\nS = 100000 mod 17\nS = 3\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have calculated the same shared secret key, S = 3. This key can now be used to encrypt and decrypt messages between them."
