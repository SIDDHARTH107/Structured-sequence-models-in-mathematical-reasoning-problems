    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by -1 to eliminate x:\n\n2(x + 2y - 3z) = 2(4i)\n-1(2x + y + z) = -1(3 + 2i)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n2x + 4y - 6z = 8i\n-2x - y - z = -3 - 2i\n\nNow, let's add the two equations above:\n\n3y - 7z = 5i - 3\n\nNext, let's multiply the first equation by 3 and the third equation by -1 to eliminate x:\n\n3(x + 2y - 3z) = 3(4i)\n-1(3x - y + 2z) = -1(-5 - 6i)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n3x + 6y - 9z = 12i\n-3x + y - 2z = 5 + 6i\n\nNow, let's add the two equations above:\n\n7y - 11z = 18i + 5\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\n3y - 7z = 5i - 3\n7y - 11z = 18i + 5\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by -3 to eliminate y:\n\n7(3y - 7z) = 7(5i - 3)\n-3(7y - 11z) = -3(18i + 5)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n21y - 49z = 35i - 21\n-21y + 33z = -54i - 15\n\nNow, let's add the two equations above:\n\n-16z = -19i - 36\n\nNow, let's solve for z:\n\nz = (19i + 36) / 16\nz = 9/4 + (19/16)i\n\nNow that we have z, we can substitute it back into one of the equations with y:\n\n3y - 7z = 5i - 3\n3y - 7(9/4 + (19/16)i) = 5i - 3\n\nWhich results in:\n\n3y = 5i - 3 + 63/4 + (133/8)i\n3y = 45/4 + (141/8)i\n\nNow, let's solve for y:\n\ny = (45/12) + (141/24)i\ny = 15/4 + (47/8)i\n\nNow that we have y, we can substitute it back into one of the equations with x:\n\nx + 2y - 3z = 4i\nx + 2(15/4 + (47/8)i) - 3(9/4 + (19/16)i) = 4i\n\nWhich results in:\n\nx = 4i - 2(15/4 + (47/8)i) + 3(9/4 + (19/16)i)\nx = 4i - 15/2 - (47/4)i + 27/4 + (57/16)i\nx = -3/2 + (25/16)i\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = -3/2 + (25/16)i\ny = 15/4 + (47/8)i\nz = 9/4 + (19/16)i"
