The sales data is as follows: \n\nJan: 100 units\nFeb: 120 units\nMar: 110 units\nApr: 130 units\nMay: 140 units\nJun: 160 units\nJul: 170 units\nAug: 180 units\nSep: 200 units\nOct: 190 units\nNov: 210 units\nDec: 220 units\n\nAssuming that the pattern of sales tends to repeat itself each year, what is the forecast for sales in January of next year using a 3-month moving average model?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the forecast for sales in January of next year using a 3-month moving average model, we need to take the average of the sales data for the last three months of the current year (October, November, and December).\n\nThe 3-month moving average for January next year would be:\n\n(October sales + November sales + December sales) / 3\n\n(190 units + 210 units + 220 units) / 3\n\n620 units / 3\n\nThe forecast for sales in January of next year using a 3-month moving average model is approximately 206.67 units."
