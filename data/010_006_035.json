    "message_2": "To calculate the fundamental group of the space obtained by attaching a 2-dimensional disk to a circle via a continuous map that wraps the circle around the perimeter of the disk exactly twice, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem.\n\nLet X be the space obtained by attaching the disk to the circle. We can decompose X into two open sets U and V such that:\n\n1. U is the circle with a small open disk removed from its interior.\n2. V is the 2-dimensional disk with a small open annulus removed from its boundary.\n3. U ∩ V is an open annulus.\n\nNow, we can calculate the fundamental groups of U, V, and U ∩ V:\n\n1. The fundamental group of U, π1(U), is isomorphic to the fundamental group of a circle, which is the integers Z (generated by a loop going once around the circle).\n2. The fundamental group of V, π1(V), is trivial because V is contractible (it is homeomorphic to an open disk).\n3. The fundamental group of U ∩ V, π1(U ∩ V), is also isomorphic to the fundamental group of a circle, which is the integers Z (generated by a loop going once around the annulus).\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The theorem states that the fundamental group of X, π1(X), is the free product of π1(U) and π1(V) with the normal subgroup generated by the elements of π1(U ∩ V) identified in both π1(U) and π1(V).\n\nSince π1(V) is trivial, the free product is just π1(U), which is the integers Z. However, we need to identify the elements of π1(U ∩ V) in π1(U). The attaching map wraps the circle around the perimeter of the disk exactly twice, so the generator of π1(U ∩ V) corresponds to the loop in π1(U) that goes around the circle twice. Therefore, we need to identify the element 2 in π1(U) with the identity.\n\nThe result is the quotient group of the integers Z by the normal subgroup generated by 2, which is isomorphic to the integers modulo 2, Z/2Z.\n\nSo, the fundamental group of the space obtained by attaching a 2-dimensional disk to a circle via a continuous map that wraps the circle around the perimeter of the disk exactly twice is Z/2Z."
