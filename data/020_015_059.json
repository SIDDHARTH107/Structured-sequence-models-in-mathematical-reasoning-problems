    "message_2": "To find the dimensions that will give the maximum area for a rectangular garden with a given perimeter, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle and the concept of optimization.\n\nThe formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nGiven that the perimeter is 40 meters, we have:\n\n40 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we want to find the dimensions that maximize the area. The area of a rectangle is given by A = LW.\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can use the concept of optimization. For a rectangle with a fixed perimeter, the maximum area occurs when the rectangle is a square. This is because, for a given perimeter, a square has the largest area among all rectangles.\n\nSo, in this case, we have a square with a perimeter of 40 meters. Let's find the side length:\n\n40 = 4s (since a square has 4 equal sides)\n\ns = 10 meters\n\nTherefore, the dimensions that will give the maximum area for the garden are 10 meters by 10 meters."
