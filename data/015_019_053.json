    "message_2": "The Henon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, which is described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\n$H(x, y, p_x, p_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(p_x^2 + p_y^2) + V(x, y)$\n\nwhere $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + ax^2y - \\frac{b}{3}y^3$ is the potential energy, and $a$ and $b$ are parameters. The energy of the system is given by $E = H(x, y, p_x, p_y)$.\n\nTo find the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the Henon-Heiles system with given parameters $a = 1.4$, $b = 0.3$, and energy $E = 0.25$, we need to numerically integrate the equations of motion and calculate the Lyapunov exponent using the variational method or other numerical techniques.\n\nThe equations of motion for the Henon-Heiles system are given by Hamilton's equations:\n\n$\\dot{x} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_x} = p_x$\n\n$\\dot{y} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_y} = p_y$\n\n$\\dot{p_x} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = -x - 2axy$\n\n$\\dot{p_y} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = -y - ax^2 + by^2$\n\nSince the maximum Lyapunov exponent depends on the specific trajectory and initial conditions, it is not possible to provide an exact value without performing a numerical simulation. However, you can use numerical tools like Python's SciPy library or MATLAB to integrate these equations of motion and calculate the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the given parameters."
