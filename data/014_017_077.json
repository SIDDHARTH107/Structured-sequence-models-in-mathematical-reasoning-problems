    "message_1": "In a ciphertext, the letter \"E\" appears 13 times out of 100 letters. Assuming that the plaintext is in English where the letter \"E\" appears 12.7% of the time, calculate the expected frequency of the letter \"E\" in the plaintext and determine if the ciphertext was likely encrypted using a simple substitution cipher.",
    "message_2": "In the given ciphertext, the letter \"E\" appears 13 times out of 100 letters, which means its frequency in the ciphertext is 13/100 = 0.13 or 13%.\n\nIn English plaintext, the letter \"E\" appears with a frequency of 12.7% or 0.127.\n\nThe difference in frequency between the ciphertext and the expected plaintext frequency is:\n\n|13% - 12.7%| = |0.13 - 0.127| = 0.003 or 0.3%\n\nSince the difference in frequency is very small (only 0.3%), it is possible that the ciphertext was encrypted using a simple substitution cipher. However, to be more certain, one would need to analyze the frequency of other letters in the ciphertext and compare them to the expected frequencies in English plaintext. If the frequencies of other letters also closely match the expected frequencies, it would further support the hypothesis that a simple substitution cipher was used."
