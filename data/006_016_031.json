    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces 5000 units of a certain product daily. The probability of a unit being defective is 0.002. What is the probability that in a day's production, there will be exactly 10 defective units?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective units\n- n is the total number of units produced daily (5000)\n- k is the number of defective units we want to find the probability for (10)\n- p is the probability of a unit being defective (0.002)\n- 1-p is the probability of a unit not being defective (1 - 0.002 = 0.998)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of choosing k defective units from n total units, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 10) = (5000C10) * (0.002^10) * (0.998^(5000-10))\n\nFirst, let's calculate 5000C10:\n\n5000C10 = 5000! / (10!(5000-10)!)\n= 5000! / (10! * 4990!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 10) ≈ (5000C10) * (0.002^10) * (0.998^4990)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 10) ≈ 0.0213\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 10 defective units in a day's production is approximately 0.0213 or 2.13%."
