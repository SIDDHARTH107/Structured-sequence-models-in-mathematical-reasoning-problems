    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least 8 heads or at least 8 tails, we can first find the probability of each event occurring separately and then add them together. We will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X=k) is the probability of getting k successes (heads or tails) in n trials (coin flips), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (0.5 for a fair coin), and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of getting at least 8 heads:\n\nP(X ≥ 8) = P(X=8) + P(X=9) + P(X=10)\n\nP(X=8) = C(10, 8) * (0.5)^8 * (0.5)^(10-8) = 45 * (0.5)^10 = 45 * 0.0009765625 = 0.0439453125\nP(X=9) = C(10, 9) * (0.5)^9 * (0.5)^(10-9) = 10 * (0.5)^10 = 10 * 0.0009765625 = 0.009765625\nP(X=10) = C(10, 10) * (0.5)^10 * (0.5)^(10-10) = 1 * (0.5)^10 = 1 * 0.0009765625 = 0.0009765625\n\nP(X ≥ 8) = 0.0439453125 + 0.009765625 + 0.0009765625 = 0.0546875\n\nNow, let's find the probability of getting at least 8 tails. Since the coin is fair, the probability of getting at least 8 tails is the same as the probability of getting at least 8 heads.\n\nP(X ≥ 8 tails) = P(X ≥ 8 heads) = 0.0546875\n\nFinally, we add the probabilities of getting at least 8 heads and at least 8 tails:\n\nP(at least 8 heads or at least 8 tails) = P(at least 8 heads) + P(at least 8 tails) = 0.0546875 + 0.0546875 = 0.109375\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 8 heads or at least 8 tails when flipping a fair coin 10 times is 0.109375 or 10.9375%."
