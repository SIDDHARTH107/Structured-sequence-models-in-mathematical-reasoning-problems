    "message_2": "To compute the fourth Betti number of the intersection cohomology complex of X, we can use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem and the Poincaré duality.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for projective varieties:\n\nLet Y be a smooth projective variety of dimension n in P^(n+1), and let H be a hyperplane in P^(n+1). Then, for 0 ≤ k ≤ n-2, the restriction map H^k(Y) → H^k(Y ∩ H) is an isomorphism, and for k = n-1, it is injective.\n\nNow, let's consider our projective variety X of dimension 3 in P^5, defined as the intersection of two quadrics. Since X is the intersection of two quadrics, it is a complete intersection, and we can apply the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem.\n\nLet H be a hyperplane in P^5. Then, by the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, we have:\n\n1. H^0(X) → H^0(X ∩ H) is an isomorphism.\n2. H^1(X) → H^1(X ∩ H) is an isomorphism.\n3. H^2(X) → H^2(X ∩ H) is injective.\n\nNow, let's use Poincaré duality. For a smooth projective variety Y of dimension n, we have H^k(Y) ≅ H^(2n-k)(Y), for all k. In our case, X has dimension 3, so we have:\n\n1. H^0(X) ≅ H^6(X)\n2. H^1(X) ≅ H^5(X)\n3. H^2(X) ≅ H^4(X)\n\nUsing the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem and Poincaré duality, we can compute the Betti numbers of X:\n\n1. b_0(X) = b_6(X) = 1 (since H^0(X) and H^6(X) are isomorphic to the cohomology of a point)\n2. b_1(X) = b_5(X) = 0 (since X is a complete intersection, it has no odd cohomology)\n3. b_2(X) = b_4(X) (by Poincaré duality)\n\nNow, we need to compute b_4(X). Since H^2(X) → H^2(X ∩ H) is injective, we know that the rank of H^2(X) is at least the rank of H^2(X ∩ H). Let's consider the intersection X ∩ H. This is a projective variety of dimension 2 in P^4, defined as the intersection of three quadrics. This is a smooth surface, and we can compute its second Betti number using the Noether formula:\n\nb_2(X ∩ H) = 10 - K^2/2,\n\nwhere K is the canonical divisor of X ∩ H. Since X ∩ H is the intersection of three quadrics, its canonical divisor is given by K = -3H', where H' is the restriction of H to X ∩ H. Therefore, K^2 = 9H'^2. Now, we can compute b_2(X ∩ H):\n\nb_2(X ∩ H) = 10 - (9H'^2)/2.\n\nSince the rank of H^2(X) is at least the rank of H^2(X ∩ H), we have:\n\nb_4(X) = b_2(X) ≥ b_2(X ∩ H) = 10 - (9H'^2)/2.\n\nThus, the fourth Betti number of the intersection cohomology complex of X is:\n\nb_4(X) ≥ 10 - (9H'^2)/2."
