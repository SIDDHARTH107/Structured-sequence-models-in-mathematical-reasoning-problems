    "message_1": "A company produces 2 products, X and Y, using two machines, A and B. The time (in hours) to produce one unit of product X on machine A, machine B and the time (in hours) to produce one unit of product Y on machine A, machine B are given in the table below:\n\n| Machines\t| Product X\t| Product Y |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A | 2 | 1 |\n| B | 4 | 3 |\n\nThe company earns a profit of $10 for each unit of product X and $12 for each unit of product Y. The machines have to be allocated in such a way that the company maximizes its profit.\n\nDetermine how many units of product X and Y the company should produce on each machine to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to determine the profit per hour for each product on each machine. We can calculate this by dividing the profit per unit by the time it takes to produce one unit on each machine.\n\nProfit per hour for Product X on Machine A: $10 / 2 hours = $5/hour\nProfit per hour for Product X on Machine B: $10 / 4 hours = $2.50/hour\n\nProfit per hour for Product Y on Machine A: $12 / 1 hour = $12/hour\nProfit per hour for Product Y on Machine B: $12 / 3 hours = $4/hour\n\nNow, we can see that Machine A has a higher profit per hour for Product Y ($12/hour) and Machine B has a higher profit per hour for Product X ($2.50/hour). However, since the profit per hour for Product Y on Machine A is higher than the profit per hour for Product X on Machine B, it would be more profitable to produce Product Y on both machines.\n\nTo maximize the profit, the company should produce Product Y on both machines. The number of units produced will depend on the available hours for each machine."
