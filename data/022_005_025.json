    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) = z^3/[(z-2)^2 * (z+3)] at the pole z = 2, we need to find the coefficient of the (z-2)^(-1) term in the Laurent series expansion of f(z) around z = 2.\n\nSince the pole is of order 2, we can use the formula for the residue of a function with a pole of order m:\n\nRes(f, z = 2) = (1/(m-1)!) * (d^(m-1)/dz^(m-1))[(z-2)^m * f(z)] evaluated at z = 2\n\nIn our case, m = 2, so the formula becomes:\n\nRes(f, z = 2) = (1/(1)!) * (d/dz)[(z-2)^2 * f(z)] evaluated at z = 2\n\nNow, let's compute the derivative:\n\nf(z) = z^3/[(z-2)^2 * (z+3)]\n\n(z-2)^2 * f(z) = z^3/(z+3)\n\nNow, differentiate with respect to z:\n\nd/dz [(z-2)^2 * f(z)] = d/dz [z^3/(z+3)]\n\nUsing the quotient rule, we get:\n\nd/dz [z^3/(z+3)] = [(3z^2)*(z+3) - z^3]/(z+3)^2\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this derivative at z = 2:\n\n[(3(2)^2)*(2+3) - (2)^3]/(2+3)^2 = [(12*5) - 8]/(5)^2 = (52)/25\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) = z^3/[(z-2)^2 * (z+3)] at the pole z = 2 is 52/25."
