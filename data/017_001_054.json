    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will consider two cases: G has an element of order 4, or G does not have an element of order 4.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nLet a be an element of order 4 in G. Then, the subgroup generated by a, <a>, has the elements {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element. Since the order of <a> is 4 and the order of G is 4, we have G = <a>. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 4, and G is isomorphic to C4. The isomorphism φ: G → C4 can be defined as φ(a^k) = k, where k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nCase 2: G does not have an element of order 4.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let a and b be two distinct non-identity elements in G. Since their orders are 2, we have a^2 = e and b^2 = e. Now, consider the element ab. Since G has only 4 elements, and we already have e, a, and b, the element ab must be the fourth element in G. Note that (ab)^2 = abab. \n\nWe know that a^2 = e and b^2 = e, so a = a^(-1) and b = b^(-1). Therefore, (ab)^2 = abab = a(ab)^(-1)a = a(ba)a. Since G is a group, it is closed under the operation, so ba is also an element of G. We have already accounted for all 4 elements in G, so ba must be equal to one of the elements we already have: e, a, b, or ab. \n\nIf ba = e, then b = a^(-1), which contradicts our assumption that a and b are distinct non-identity elements. If ba = a, then b = e, which also contradicts our assumption. If ba = b, then a = e, which again contradicts our assumption. Therefore, ba = ab. \n\nNow we have shown that G = {e, a, b, ab} with a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2 = e and ab = ba. This is precisely the definition of the Klein four-group V4. Thus, G is isomorphic to V4. The isomorphism φ: G → V4 can be defined as φ(e) = e, φ(a) = a, φ(b) = b, and φ(ab) = ab.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 4, it is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4, depending on whether it has an element of order 4 or not. The specific isomorphisms between G and either C4 or V4 have been defined above."
