    "message_1": "A cable company wants to minimize the cost of running a cable line from a power station to a customer's house, which is located 800 meters downstream from the power station, across a river. The cable line can be laid in a straight line from the power station to a point on the opposite side of the river, say, (x, y), and then from that point in a straight line to the customer's house. The cost of laying cable underground is $500 per meter and the cost of running cable underwater is $1000 per meter. \nAssuming that the river's width is 500 meters, what is the minimum cost of laying the cable from the power station to the customer's house? Please assume that the cable company has decided to run the cable under the water and plans to use only one straight cable line from the power station to the customer's house via the mid-point (250,0) of the river.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost, we need to calculate the length of the cable under the water and the length of the cable underground.\n\nThe power station is at point A (0,0), the midpoint of the river is at point B (250,0), and the customer's house is at point C (800, 500).\n\nFirst, we find the length of the underwater cable from point A to point B. Since both points have a y-coordinate of 0, the horizontal distance between them is simply the difference in their x-coordinates:\n\nAB = 250 - 0 = 250 meters\n\nNext, we find the length of the underground cable from point B to point C. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between these two points:\n\nBC = sqrt((800 - 250)^2 + (500 - 0)^2)\nBC = sqrt(550^2 + 500^2)\nBC = sqrt(302500 + 250000)\nBC = sqrt(552500)\nBC â‰ˆ 743.22 meters\n\nNow we can calculate the cost of laying the cable. The underwater cable costs $1000 per meter, and the underground cable costs $500 per meter:\n\nCost = (AB * 1000) + (BC * 500)\nCost = (250 * 1000) + (743.22 * 500)\nCost = 250000 + 371610\nCost = $621,610\n\nSo the minimum cost of laying the cable from the power station to the customer's house via the midpoint of the river is $621,610."
