    "message_1": "A company produces three types of products A, B, and C with profits $10, $15, and $20, respectively. The production process of each product also requires certain amounts of three different resources: x, y and z. The resource requirements for each product are given in the table below:\n\n| Product | Resource x | Resource y | Resource z |\n| ------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |\n| A       | 2         | 1         | 0         |\n| B       | 1         | 2         | 1         |\n| C       | 1         | 0         | 2         |\n\nThe company has 20 units of resource x, 18 units of resource y, and 14 units of resource z available for production. What is the maximum profit the company can make if it wants to produce at least 2 units of product A, 1 unit of product B, and 2 units of product C?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the variables a, b, and c to represent the number of units of products A, B, and C produced, respectively. We are given that the company wants to produce at least 2 units of product A, 1 unit of product B, and 2 units of product C. So, we have the following constraints:\n\na ≥ 2\nb ≥ 1\nc ≥ 2\n\nNow, let's consider the resource constraints. The company has 20 units of resource x, 18 units of resource y, and 14 units of resource z available for production. The resource requirements for each product are given in the table. So, we have the following constraints:\n\n2a + 1b + 1c ≤ 20 (resource x constraint)\n1a + 2b + 0c ≤ 18 (resource y constraint)\n0a + 1b + 2c ≤ 14 (resource z constraint)\n\nThe company's profit is given by the equation:\n\nProfit = 10a + 15b + 20c\n\nOur goal is to maximize the profit subject to the constraints mentioned above. This is a linear programming problem. We can solve it graphically or by using the simplex method. In this case, we will solve it graphically.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the resource constraints as equalities:\n\n2a + 1b + 1c = 20\n1a + 2b + 0c = 18\n0a + 1b + 2c = 14\n\nNow, let's solve these equations for a, b, and c:\n\na = (20 - 1b - 1c) / 2\nb = (18 - 1a) / 2\nc = (14 - 1b) / 2\n\nNow, let's plot these equations on a 3D graph and find the feasible region:\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of the half-spaces defined by the inequalities and the minimum production constraints. The vertices of the feasible region are the points where the constraints intersect. We can find these vertices by solving the system of equations formed by the constraints.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\n\n(2, 1, 2)\n(2, 8, 2)\n(6, 1, 2)\n(8, 1, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nProfit(2, 1, 2) = 10(2) + 15(1) + 20(2) = 20 + 15 + 40 = 75\nProfit(2, 8, 2) = 10(2) + 15(8) + 20(2) = 20 + 120 + 40 = 180\nProfit(6, 1, 2) = 10(6) + 15(1) + 20(2) = 60 + 15 + 40 = 115\nProfit(8, 1, 0) = 10(8) + 15(1) + 20(0) = 80 + 15 + 0 = 95\n\nThe maximum profit is 180, which occurs when the company produces 2 units of product A, 8 units of product B, and 2 units of product C."
