    "message_2": "We can simplify the given expression using the Pythagorean identity for trigonometric functions: sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1. \n\nThe expression is:\n\nsin(x) * cos(x) / (1 - sin^2(x))\n\nWe can rewrite the denominator using the Pythagorean identity:\n\nsin(x) * cos(x) / cos^2(x)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression by canceling out one of the cos(x) terms:\n\nsin(x) / cos(x)\n\nThis expression is equal to the tangent function:\n\ntan(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x in the interval [0, 2π] for which tan(x) is defined. The tangent function has vertical asymptotes (undefined values) at odd multiples of π/2. In the given interval, the undefined values are at x = π/2 and x = 3π/2.\n\nSo, the simplified expression is tan(x), and it is defined for all x in the interval [0, 2π] except for x = π/2 and x = 3π/2."
