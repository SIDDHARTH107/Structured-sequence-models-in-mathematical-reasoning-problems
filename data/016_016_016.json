    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that increases in length with each iteration. The length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (initial length) * (multiplier)^(number of iterations)\n\nFor the Gosper curve, the multiplier is 7^(1/2), which is approximately 2.645751311.\n\nSo, after the fourth iteration, the length of the Gosper curve will be:\n\nLength = 1 * (2.645751311)^4\nLength â‰ˆ 48.66810377\n\nTherefore, the length of the Gosper curve after the fourth iteration, with an initial line segment length of 1, is approximately 48.66810377."
