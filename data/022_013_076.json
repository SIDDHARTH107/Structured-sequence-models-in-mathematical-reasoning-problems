    "message_2": "To determine if the function $f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2$ is analytic in the region enclosed by the circle $|z-1| = 1$, we need to check if the function is differentiable in that region.\n\nThe function $f(z)$ is a polynomial function, and polynomial functions are differentiable everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, $f(z)$ is differentiable in the region enclosed by the circle $|z-1| = 1$.\n\nHence, the function $f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2$ is analytic in the region enclosed by the circle $|z-1| = 1$."
