    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern is a fractal created using an iterated function system (IFS) with four affine transformations. The scaling factor for each transformation is as follows:\n\n1. Transformation 1: Scaling factor = 0.01\n2. Transformation 2: Scaling factor = 0.85\n3. Transformation 3: Scaling factor = 0.2\n4. Transformation 4: Scaling factor = 0.15\n\nIf the scale of the first iteration is 10 units, we can find the scaling factor for each transformation by multiplying the original scaling factors by the given scale (10 units).\n\n1. Transformation 1: Scaling factor = 0.01 * 10 = 0.1 units\n2. Transformation 2: Scaling factor = 0.85 * 10 = 8.5 units\n3. Transformation 3: Scaling factor = 0.2 * 10 = 2 units\n4. Transformation 4: Scaling factor = 0.15 * 10 = 1.5 units\n\nSo, the scaling factors for the Barnsley fern with a first iteration scale of 10 units are 0.1, 8.5, 2, and 1.5 units for the four transformations, respectively."
