    "message_2": "To determine the maximum possible value of the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and its generalization for graphs embedded on surfaces of higher genus.\n\nEuler's formula for planar graphs states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2,\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFor a graph embedded on a surface of genus g, the formula is generalized as:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g.\n\nWe are given a graph with 15 vertices (V = 15) and 25 edges (E = 25). We want to find the maximum possible genus (g) of the graph.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of faces (F) that the graph can have. Since the graph is connected, each face must be bounded by at least 3 edges. Therefore, the maximum number of faces can be obtained when each edge is shared by exactly two faces, which gives:\n\nF_max = 2E/3 = 2(25)/3 â‰ˆ 16.67.\n\nSince F must be an integer, we have F_max = 16.\n\nNow, we can use the generalized Euler's formula to find the maximum genus:\n\n15 - 25 + F = 2 - 2g\nF = 12 + 2g\n16 = 12 + 2g\n4 = 2g\ng = 2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value of the genus of the graph is 2."
