    "message_2": "To find the value of x in degrees using the inverse sine function, we can use the following formula:\n\nx = sin^(-1)(0.6)\n\nUsing a calculator with the inverse sine function, we get:\n\nx â‰ˆ 36.87 degrees\n\nSo, the value of x is approximately 36.87 degrees. Keep in mind that this is the principal value, and there are other solutions as well since the sine function is periodic. The general solution would be:\n\nx = 36.87 + 360n or x = 180 - 36.87 + 360n\n\nwhere n is an integer."
