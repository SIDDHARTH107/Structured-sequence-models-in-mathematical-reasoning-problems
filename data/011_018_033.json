    "message_2": "A 2-(v, k, λ) block design is an arrangement of v elements into blocks such that each block contains k elements, and every pair of elements occurs together in exactly λ blocks. In this case, we have v = 16, k = unknown, and λ = 6.\n\nWe can use the following formula to find the value of k:\n\nλ(v - 1) = k(k - 1)\n\nwhere v = 16 and λ = 6.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n6(16 - 1) = k(k - 1)\n6(15) = k(k - 1)\n90 = k(k - 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of k that satisfies this equation. We can try different values of k and see which one works:\n\nk = 5: 90 ≠ 5(4) = 20\nk = 6: 90 ≠ 6(5) = 30\nk = 7: 90 ≠ 7(6) = 42\nk = 8: 90 ≠ 8(7) = 56\nk = 9: 90 ≠ 9(8) = 72\nk = 10: 90 = 10(9) = 90\n\nSo, the value of k that satisfies the equation is k = 10. Therefore, the student needs to design a 2-(16, 10, 6) block design."
