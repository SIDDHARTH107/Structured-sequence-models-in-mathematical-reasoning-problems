The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nB = {2, 5, 8, 10}\n\nIntersection of A and B (A ∩ B) = {2, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the elements in either A or B but not in their intersection:\n\nA △ B = (A - (A ∩ B)) ∪ (B - (A ∩ B))\nA △ B = ({2, 4, 6, 8} - {2, 8}) ∪ ({2, 5, 8, 10} - {2, 8})\nA △ B = {4, 6} ∪ {5, 10}\nA △ B = {4, 6, 5, 10}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of (A △ B) and the given set {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}:\n\n(A △ B) ∩ {2, 4, 5, 6, 8} = {4, 6, 5, 10} ∩ {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}\n\nThe intersection contains the elements that are common in both sets:\n\n(A △ B) ∩ {2, 4, 5, 6, 8} = {4, 5, 6}\n\nSo, the final answer is {4, 5, 6}."
