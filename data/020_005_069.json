    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company produces two products, A and B. The production process for each requires time on two machines, Machine 1 and Machine 2. The company has 80 hours available on Machine 1 and 100 hours available on Machine 2 each week. Product A requires 2 hours on Machine 1 and 1 hour on Machine 2, while Product B requires 1 hour on Machine 1 and 3 hours on Machine 2. The profit for each unit of Product A is $5, and the profit for each unit of Product B is $7. The company wants to know how many units of each product to produce each week to maximize its profit. \n\nFormulate and solve the integer programming problem to maximize the company’s profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B produced each week. The objective is to maximize the profit, which can be represented as:\n\nObjective function: Maximize P = 5x + 7y\n\nSubject to the constraints of the available hours on each machine:\n\nConstraint 1 (Machine 1): 2x + y ≤ 80\nConstraint 2 (Machine 2): x + 3y ≤ 100\nConstraint 3: x ≥ 0\nConstraint 4: y ≥ 0\n\nNow we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and finding the vertices of the feasible region.\n\n1. 2x + y = 80 (y-intercept at (0, 80) and x-intercept at (40, 0))\n2. x + 3y = 100 (y-intercept at (0, 33.33) and x-intercept at (100, 0))\n\nPlot these lines on a graph and shade the feasible region. The feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 33), (20, 20), and (40, 0).\n\nNow we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 33) = 5(0) + 7(33) = $231\n3. P(20, 20) = 5(20) + 7(20) = $240\n4. P(40, 0) = 5(40) + 7(0) = $200\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (20, 20), with a profit of $240. Therefore, the company should produce 20 units of Product A and 20 units of Product B each week to maximize its profit."
