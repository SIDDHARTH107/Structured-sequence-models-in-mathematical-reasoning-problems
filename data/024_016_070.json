    "message_1": "Let $M$ be a 3-dimensional manifold with metric tensor $g_{ij}$ and let $T$ be a tensor field on $M$ with components $T^i_j$. Compute the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to a vector field $X$ on $M$, where $X$ is given by $X = a\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + b\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + c\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$, with $a$, $b$, and $c$ being constant coefficients.",
    "message_2": "To compute the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ with respect to the vector field $X$, we use the following formula for the covariant derivative of a tensor field:\n\n$(\\nabla_X T)^i_j = X(T^i_j) - \\Gamma^i_{km} T^k_j X^m + \\Gamma^k_{jm} T^i_k X^m$\n\nwhere $\\Gamma^i_{km}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, which can be computed from the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ as follows:\n\n$\\Gamma^i_{km} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{il} (\\frac{\\partial g_{lk}}{\\partial x^m} + \\frac{\\partial g_{lm}}{\\partial x^k} - \\frac{\\partial g_{km}}{\\partial x^l})$\n\nGiven that $X = a\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + b\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + c\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$, we can write $X^m = (a, b, c)$. Now, we can compute the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to $X$:\n\n$(\\nabla_X T)^i_j = a(\\frac{\\partial T^i_j}{\\partial x}) + b(\\frac{\\partial T^i_j}{\\partial y}) + c(\\frac{\\partial T^i_j}{\\partial z}) - \\Gamma^i_{km} T^k_j (a, b, c)^m + \\Gamma^k_{jm} T^i_k (a, b, c)^m$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$(\\nabla_X T)^i_j = a(\\frac{\\partial T^i_j}{\\partial x}) + b(\\frac{\\partial T^i_j}{\\partial y}) + c(\\frac{\\partial T^i_j}{\\partial z}) - a\\Gamma^i_{k1} T^k_j + b\\Gamma^i_{k2} T^k_j + c\\Gamma^i_{k3} T^k_j + a\\Gamma^k_{j1} T^i_k - b\\Gamma^k_{j2} T^i_k - c\\Gamma^k_{j3} T^i_k$\n\nThis expression gives the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ with respect to the vector field $X$ in terms of the partial derivatives of the components of $T$, the Christoffel symbols, and the constant coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$."
