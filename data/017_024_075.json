    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 96 = 2^5 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups using the partition function: P(5) = 7 and P(1) = 1. Therefore, there are 7 * 1 = 7 abelian groups of order 96.\n3. To find the number of non-abelian groups, we can use the formula derived by John D. Dixon: \n\n   G(n) = (1/n) * ∑(d|n) * μ(n/d) * p(d)\n\n   where G(n) is the number of non-isomorphic groups of order n, d are the divisors of n, μ is the Möbius function, and p(d) is the number of partitions of d.\n\n4. Apply the formula for n = 96:\n\n   G(96) = (1/96) * [μ(1) * p(96) + μ(2) * p(48) + μ(3) * p(32) + μ(4) * p(24) + μ(6) * p(16) + μ(8) * p(12) + μ(12) * p(8) + μ(16) * p(6) + μ(24) * p(4) + μ(32) * p(3) + μ(48) * p(2) + μ(96) * p(1)]\n\n   G(96) = (1/96) * [1 * 194 + (-1) * 28 + (-1) * 7 + 1 * 15 + 1 * 9 + (-1) * 14 + (-1) * 22 + 0 * 11 + 1 * 5 + 0 * 3 + 1 * 2 + 0 * 1]\n\n   G(96) = (1/96) * [194 - 28 - 7 + 15 + 9 - 14 - 22 + 5 + 2]\n\n   G(96) = (1/96) * [144]\n\n5. The total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96 is 144.\n\nSo, there are 144 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
