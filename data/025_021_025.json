    "message_1": "A math student studying mirror symmetry may be interested in solving the following numerical problem:\n\nLet X be a cubic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{C}P^3$. Consider a polynomial with a single variable $q$ given by\n$$\nF(q) = \\sum_{d = 0}^\\infty N_d q^d,\n$$\nwhere $N_d$ is the number of rational curves in X of degree d (i.e. the number of $\\mathbb{C}P^1$'s in X that can be mapped rationally onto $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ of degree d). Find the first 3 coefficients $N_0$, $N_1$, and $N_2$ of $F(q)$ assuming X has mirror symmetry.",
    "message_2": "To find the first three coefficients $N_0$, $N_1$, and $N_2$ of $F(q)$, we can use the mirror symmetry property of the cubic hypersurface X. Mirror symmetry relates the enumerative geometry of X to the periods of its mirror partner, which is a family of Calabi-Yau threefolds. In particular, the Gromov-Witten invariants of X, which count the number of rational curves of a given degree, can be computed from the periods of the mirror.\n\nFor a cubic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{C}P^3$, the mirror is given by the following family of Calabi-Yau threefolds:\n$$\nX^\\vee \\colon \\{x_0x_1x_2 + x_0x_3x_4 + x_1x_3x_5 + x_2x_4x_5 = \\psi x_3x_4x_5\\} \\subset \\mathbb{C}P^5,\n$$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a complex parameter.\n\nThe generating function $F(q)$ can be computed from the periods of the mirror $X^\\vee$ using the following formula:\n$$\nF(q) = \\frac{1}{6} \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - 864q} \\right).\n$$\nExpanding the logarithm in a power series, we get:\n$$\nF(q) = \\frac{1}{6} \\sum_{d = 1}^\\infty \\frac{864^d}{d} q^d.\n$$\nFrom this expansion, we can read off the first three coefficients $N_0$, $N_1$, and $N_2$:\n$$\nN_0 = 0, \\quad N_1 = 144, \\quad N_2 = 10368.\n$$\nSo, the first three coefficients of $F(q)$ are $N_0 = 0$, $N_1 = 144$, and $N_2 = 10368$."
