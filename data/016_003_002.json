    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a fractal, meaning it has an infinite number of smaller copies of itself within its boundary. However, the question asks for the smallest copy of the Mandelbrot set that appears in the given region.\n\nThe region specified is a square with side length 3 centered at the origin. The main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set, which is the largest connected component, is contained within a circle of radius 0.25 centered at (-0.5, 0). The smallest copy of the Mandelbrot set, known as a \"baby Mandelbrot,\" is located near the tip of the antenna of the main cardioid, which is at the point (-1, 0).\n\nThe baby Mandelbrot is approximately 1/240 times the size of the main Mandelbrot set. The area of the main Mandelbrot set is estimated to be around 1.50659177 square units. Therefore, the area of the smallest copy of the Mandelbrot set in the given region can be estimated as:\n\nArea ≈ (1/240) * 1.50659177 ≈ 0.006277882 square units.\n\nKeep in mind that this is an approximation, as the exact area of the Mandelbrot set and its copies is difficult to calculate due to their fractal nature."
