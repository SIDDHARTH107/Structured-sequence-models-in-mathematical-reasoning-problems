    "message_2": "To show that the system has no solution, we can demonstrate that the two equations are parallel and never intersect. We can do this by showing that they have the same slope but different y-intercepts.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equations in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n\nEquation 1: 2x + 3y = 10\nDivide both sides by 3:\ny = (-2/3)x + 10/3\n\nEquation 2: 4x + 6y = 20\nDivide both sides by 6:\ny = (-2/3)x + 20/6\n\nNow, let's simplify Equation 2:\ny = (-2/3)x + 10/3\n\nAs we can see, both equations have the same slope (-2/3) and the same y-intercept (10/3). This means that they are not parallel lines, but they are in fact the same line. In this case, the system has infinitely many solutions, not no solution. The two equations represent the same line, so any point on the line is a solution to the system."
