If a sample of 36 chocolate bars is selected at random from this factory, what is the probability that the mean weight of these chocolate bars is less than 98 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. According to the Central Limit Theorem, if we have a large enough sample size, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed with the same mean as the population (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 100 grams, the population standard deviation (σ) is 5 grams, and the sample size (n) is 36.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean, which is given by:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / sqrt(n)\nσ_sample_mean = 5 / sqrt(36)\nσ_sample_mean = 5 / 6\nσ_sample_mean = 0.8333 grams\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for a sample mean of 98 grams. The z-score is given by:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\nz = (98 - 100) / 0.8333\nz = -2 / 0.8333\nz ≈ -2.4\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean is less than 98 grams, which is the same as finding the area to the left of z = -2.4 in the standard normal distribution. You can use a z-table or a calculator to find this probability.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the area to the left of z = -2.4 is approximately 0.0082.\n\nSo, the probability that the mean weight of the 36 chocolate bars is less than 98 grams is approximately 0.0082 or 0.82%."
