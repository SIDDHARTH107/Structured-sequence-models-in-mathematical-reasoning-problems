    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into an upper triangular matrix, and then use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n|  2  1  1 |  5 |\n|  1 -3  2 | -1 |\n| -4  5 -1 |  9 |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top left corner:\n\n|  1 -3  2 | -1 |\n|  2  1  1 |  5 |\n| -4  5 -1 |  9 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the 2 and -4 in the first column below the 1:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1:\n|  1 -3  2 | -1 |\n|  0  7 -3 |  7 |\n| -4  5 -1 |  9 |\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 + 4 * Row 1:\n|  1 -3  2 | -1 |\n|  0  7 -3 |  7 |\n|  0 -7  7 |  5 |\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 7:\n\n|  1 -3  2 | -1 |\n|  0  1 -3/7 |  1 |\n|  0 -7  7 |  5 |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the -7 in the second column below the 1:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 + 7 * Row 2:\n|  1 -3  2 | -1 |\n|  0  1 -3/7 |  1 |\n|  0  0  4/7 | 12 |\n\nStep 5: Divide Row 3 by 4/7:\n\n|  1 -3  2 | -1 |\n|  0  1 -3/7 |  1 |\n|  0  0  1 | 21 |\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nz = 21\ny = 1 + 3/7 * z = 1 + 3/7 * 21 = 10\nx = -1 - 2 * z + 3 * y = -1 - 2 * 21 + 3 * 10 = 1\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 10, and z = 21."
