    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative of the given function, we need to find the partial derivatives with respect to each coordinate and then express the result as a differential form.\n\nLet's find the partial derivatives of f with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2xyz^3 + 2y^2z + yz^5$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = x^2z^3 + 4xyz + xz^5$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = 3x^2yz^2 + 2xy^2 + 5xyz^4$\n\nNow, let's express the exterior derivative as a differential form:\n\n$df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} dz$\n\n$df = (2xyz^3 + 2y^2z + yz^5) dx + (x^2z^3 + 4xyz + xz^5) dy + (3x^2yz^2 + 2xy^2 + 5xyz^4) dz$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of the given function is:\n\n$df = (2xyz^3 + 2y^2z + yz^5) dx + (x^2z^3 + 4xyz + xz^5) dy + (3x^2yz^2 + 2xy^2 + 5xyz^4) dz$"
