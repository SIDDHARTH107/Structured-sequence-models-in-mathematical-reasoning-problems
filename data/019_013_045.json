    "message_1": "Let X be a set that contains 5 elements. How many second-order properties does X have?",
    "message_2": "A second-order property is a property that applies to subsets of a given set. In this case, we are looking at the subsets of the set X, which contains 5 elements.\n\nThe number of subsets of a set with n elements is given by the formula 2^n. In this case, n = 5, so there are 2^5 = 32 subsets of X.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of second-order properties, not the number of subsets. A second-order property is a property that can be either true or false for each subset. Since there are 32 subsets, there are 2^32 possible combinations of true/false assignments for these properties.\n\nTherefore, there are 2^32 second-order properties for the set X with 5 elements."
