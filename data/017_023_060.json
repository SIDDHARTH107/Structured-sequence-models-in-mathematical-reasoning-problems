    "message_2": "To find the total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the formula for the number of groups of a given order n:\n\nG(n) = sum(GCD(n, k) * p(n/k)) for k = 1 to n, where p(n) is the number of partitions of n.\n\nFor n = 72, we have the prime factorization 72 = 2^3 * 3^2. We can use the formula for the number of abelian groups of order n:\n\nA(n) = product(p(m_i + 1)) for i = 1 to k, where m_i are the exponents of the prime factors in the prime factorization of n.\n\nFor n = 72, we have:\n\nA(72) = p(3 + 1) * p(2 + 1) = p(4) * p(3) = 5 * 3 = 15.\n\nSo there are 15 abelian groups of order 72.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order n:\n\nG(n) = sum(GCD(n, k) * p(n/k)) for k = 1 to n.\n\nFor n = 72, we have:\n\nG(72) = sum(GCD(72, k) * p(72/k)) for k = 1 to 72.\n\nCalculating the sum, we get:\n\nG(72) = 1 * p(72) + 2 * p(36) + 3 * p(24) + 4 * p(18) + 6 * p(12) + 8 * p(9) + 9 * p(8) + 12 * p(6) + 18 * p(4) + 24 * p(3) + 36 * p(2) + 72 * p(1) = 1 * 1958 + 2 * 107 + 3 * 35 + 4 * 17 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 5 + 9 * 4 + 12 * 3 + 18 * 2 + 24 * 1 + 36 * 1 + 72 * 1 = 1958 + 214 + 105 + 68 + 42 + 40 + 36 + 36 + 36 + 24 + 36 + 72 = 2567.\n\nSo there are 2567 non-isomorphic groups of order 72.\n\nOut of these 2567 non-isomorphic groups, 15 of them are abelian."
