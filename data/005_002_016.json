    "message_1": "A battery company claims that their batteries have an average lifespan of 120 hours. A sample of 25 batteries was taken and the sample mean was found to be 115 hours with a standard deviation of 10 hours. What is the 95% confidence interval for the average lifespan of the batteries if we assume the lifespan follows a normal distribution?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the average lifespan of the batteries, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% in this case), σ is the standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval. For a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96 (you can find this value in a standard Z-score table).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nx̄ = 115 hours (sample mean)\nσ = 10 hours (standard deviation)\nn = 25 (sample size)\n\nCI = 115 ± (1.96 * (10 / √25))\nCI = 115 ± (1.96 * (10 / 5))\nCI = 115 ± (1.96 * 2)\nCI = 115 ± 3.92\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the average lifespan of the batteries is (111.08 hours, 118.92 hours). This means that we can be 95% confident that the true average lifespan of the batteries lies between 111.08 hours and 118.92 hours."
