    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we first need to break down the square roots into their simplest form.\n\nFor $3\\sqrt{12}$, we can break down $\\sqrt{12}$ into $\\sqrt{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}$, which simplifies to $2\\sqrt{3}$. So, $3\\sqrt{12}$ becomes $3(2\\sqrt{3}) = 6\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFor $2\\sqrt{27}$, we can break down $\\sqrt{27}$ into $\\sqrt{9} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}$, which simplifies to $3\\sqrt{3}$. So, $2\\sqrt{27}$ becomes $2(3\\sqrt{3}) = 6\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\n$3\\sqrt{12} - 2\\sqrt{27} = 6\\sqrt{3} - 6\\sqrt{3} = 0$"
