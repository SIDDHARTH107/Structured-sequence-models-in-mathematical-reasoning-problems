    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12 and 18, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 12: 2^2 * 3^1\nPrime factorization of 18: 2^1 * 3^2\n\nNow, take the highest power of each prime factor present in the factorizations:\n\n2^2 and 3^2\n\nMultiply these together:\n\nLCM(12, 18) = 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 * 9 = 36\n\nSo, the LCM of 12 and 18 is 36."
