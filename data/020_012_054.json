The factory has a constraint of producing a maximum of 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B due to limited resources. What is the maximum profit that the factory can make?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum profit, we need to multiply the profit per unit by the maximum number of units that can be produced for each product, and then add the profits together.\n\nFor product A:\nMaximum units = 200\nProfit per unit = $10\nTotal profit for product A = 200 * $10 = $2000\n\nFor product B:\nMaximum units = 150\nProfit per unit = $15\nTotal profit for product B = 150 * $15 = $2250\n\nNow, we add the profits together to find the maximum profit the factory can make:\n\nMaximum profit = Total profit for product A + Total profit for product B\nMaximum profit = $2000 + $2250 = $4250\n\nThe maximum profit that the factory can make is $4250."
