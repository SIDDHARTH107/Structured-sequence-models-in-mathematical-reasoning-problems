    "message_2": "Let's use the Sylow theorems to determine the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Recall that the order of G is 24, which can be factored as 2^3 * 3^1. According to the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. There exists a Sylow p-subgroup for each prime factor p of the order of G.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups, denoted by n_p, divides the order of G.\n3. n_p is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nNow, let's focus on the Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Let n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. From the second Sylow theorem, we know that n_3 must divide the order of G, which is 24. The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. \n\nFrom the third Sylow theorem, we know that n_3 must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Among the divisors of 24, only 1 and 4 satisfy this condition. Therefore, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G, n_3, is either 1 or 4."
