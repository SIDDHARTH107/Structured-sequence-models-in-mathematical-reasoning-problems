    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the graph for the absolute value equation, we first need to solve the equation for x. \n\nGiven the equation: |3x + 5| - 2 = 1\n\nStep 1: Isolate the absolute value term.\nAdd 2 to both sides of the equation:\n|3x + 5| = 3\n\nStep 2: Split the equation into two separate equations, one for the positive case and one for the negative case.\n\nPositive case: 3x + 5 = 3\nNegative case: -(3x + 5) = 3\n\nStep 3: Solve each equation for x.\n\nPositive case:\n3x + 5 = 3\n3x = -2\nx = -2/3\n\nNegative case:\n-3x - 5 = 3\n-3x = 8\nx = -8/3\n\nThe x-intercepts of the graph for the absolute value equation are x = -2/3 and x = -8/3."
