    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a fractal, which means it exhibits self-similarity at different scales. However, there isn't a specific \"smallest zoom level\" at which self-similarity becomes visible, as the set is infinitely complex and self-similar patterns can be found at various scales.\n\nThe concept of zoom level is also subjective, as it depends on the resolution of the image and the size of the screen or medium on which it is being displayed. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific zoom level as an answer."
