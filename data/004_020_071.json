    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nA force of 20 N is applied to an object over a distance of 10 meters in the direction of the force. If the force is applied at an angle of 60 degrees to the horizontal, find the work done on the object using integration. Take the gravitational acceleration to be 9.8 m/s^2.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done on the object, we need to calculate the force component in the direction of the displacement and then integrate it over the distance. Since the force is applied at an angle of 60 degrees to the horizontal, we can find the horizontal component of the force using the cosine function:\n\nF_horizontal = F * cos(θ)\nF_horizontal = 20 N * cos(60°)\nF_horizontal = 20 N * 0.5\nF_horizontal = 10 N\n\nNow, we need to integrate the horizontal force component over the distance of 10 meters. Since the force is constant, the integration is straightforward:\n\nWork = ∫(F_horizontal) dx from 0 to 10\nWork = ∫(10 N) dx from 0 to 10\n\nIntegrating 10 N with respect to x, we get:\n\nWork = 10 N * x | from 0 to 10\nWork = 10 N * (10 - 0)\nWork = 10 N * 10\nWork = 100 J\n\nSo, the work done on the object is 100 Joules."
