    "message_1": "A company wants to determine if there is a relationship between the age of its employees and their salaries. They collect data on the age and salary of 10 employees. Using discriminant analysis with two groups, the company found that the between-group variance is 350 and the within-group variance is 125. What is the discriminant score for an employee who is 35 years old and earns a salary of $50,000?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the discriminant score, we first need to find the pooled within-group variance and the discriminant function coefficients. However, the information provided is not sufficient to calculate these values. We would need the means and standard deviations of the two groups, as well as the correlation between age and salary.\n\nIf you can provide the means and standard deviations of the two groups, as well as the correlation between age and salary, I can help you calculate the discriminant score for the employee."
