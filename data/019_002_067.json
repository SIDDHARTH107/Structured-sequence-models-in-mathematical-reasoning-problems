    "message_2": "To determine if the statement is true or false, we need to analyze the expression (n^2 + n + 1) for all natural numbers n.\n\nLet's consider two cases: when n is even and when n is odd.\n\nCase 1: n is even\nIf n is even, then n can be written as 2k, where k is an integer. Then, the expression becomes:\n\n(2k)^2 + 2k + 1 = 4k^2 + 2k + 1\n\nSince 4k^2 and 2k are both even numbers, their sum is also even. Adding 1 to an even number results in an odd number. So, in this case, the expression is odd.\n\nCase 2: n is odd\nIf n is odd, then n can be written as (2k + 1), where k is an integer. Then, the expression becomes:\n\n(2k + 1)^2 + (2k + 1) + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 2k + 1 + 1\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n4k^2 + 6k + 3 = 2(2k^2 + 3k + 1) + 1\n\nSince 2(2k^2 + 3k + 1) is an even number, adding 1 to it results in an odd number. So, in this case, the expression is also odd.\n\nSince the expression (n^2 + n + 1) is odd for both even and odd natural numbers n, the statement is true."
