    "message_2": "To divide a group of 6 people into 3 teams with at least one member in each team, we can consider the following cases:\n\n1. Case 1: 3-2-1 distribution\nOne team has 3 members, one team has 2 members, and the last team has 1 member.\n\nThere are 6 choose 3 ways to pick the members for the team with 3 members, which is C(6,3) = 20 ways. Then, there are 3 remaining people, and we need to choose 2 of them for the team with 2 members. This can be done in C(3,2) = 3 ways. The last person will be in the team with 1 member. So, there are 20 * 3 = 60 ways to arrange the teams in this case.\n\n2. Case 2: 2-2-2 distribution\nEach team has 2 members.\n\nThere are 6 choose 2 ways to pick the members for the first team, which is C(6,2) = 15 ways. Then, there are 4 remaining people, and we need to choose 2 of them for the second team. This can be done in C(4,2) = 6 ways. The last 2 people will be in the third team. However, since the order of the teams doesn't matter, we have overcounted the arrangements. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the 3 teams, so we need to divide by 6 to correct for this overcounting. So, there are (15 * 6) / 6 = 15 ways to arrange the teams in this case.\n\nAdding the ways from both cases, we get a total of 60 + 15 = 75 ways to divide the group of 6 people into 3 teams with at least one member in each team."
