    "message_2": "To find the probability of a ransomware cyber attack occurring on a particular network within the next year, we can use the Poisson distribution formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, ransomware attacks) occurring in a fixed interval of time (one year).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X=k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of k ransomware attacks occurring in the next year\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of ransomware attacks per year (in this case, 2)\n- k is the number of ransomware attacks we want to find the probability for (at least 1 attack)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nTo find the probability of at least one ransomware attack occurring within the next year, we can find the probability of zero attacks and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X≥1) = 1 - P(X=0)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Poisson distribution formula for k=0:\n\nP(X=0) = (e^(-2) * 2^0) / 0! = (0.13534 * 1) / 1 = 0.13534\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least one attack:\n\nP(X≥1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - 0.13534 = 0.86466\n\nSo, the probability of a ransomware cyber attack occurring on a particular network within the next year is approximately 86.47%."
