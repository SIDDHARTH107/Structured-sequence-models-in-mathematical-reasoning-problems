    "message_2": "To find the time-domain function s(t) from its Fourier transform S(f), we need to apply the inverse Fourier transform formula:\n\ns(t) = ∫[S(f) * e^(j2πft)] df from -∞ to +∞\n\nWe have three terms in S(f), so we can find the inverse Fourier transform for each term separately and then add them together.\n\n1. For the first term: 2/(1+j2πf)\n\nLet's use the substitution: u = 2πf, so du = 2πdf\n\ns1(t) = ∫[(2/(1+ju)) * e^(jut/2π)] (1/2π) du from -∞ to +∞\n\nThis integral represents the inverse Laplace transform of 2/(1+ju) with respect to u. The inverse Laplace transform of 1/(1+ju) is e^(-t)u(t), where u(t) is the unit step function.\n\nSo, s1(t) = 2e^(-t)u(t)\n\n2. For the second term: 3δ(f-6)\n\ns2(t) = ∫[3δ(f-6) * e^(j2πft)] df from -∞ to +∞\n\nUsing the property of the Dirac delta function, we get:\n\ns2(t) = 3e^(j2π6t)\n\n3. For the third term: -4jδ(f+8)\n\ns3(t) = ∫[-4jδ(f+8) * e^(j2πft)] df from -∞ to +∞\n\nUsing the property of the Dirac delta function, we get:\n\ns3(t) = -4je^(-j2π8t)\n\nNow, we can add all three terms together to get the time-domain function s(t):\n\ns(t) = s1(t) + s2(t) + s3(t) = 2e^(-t)u(t) + 3e^(j2π6t) - 4je^(-j2π8t)"
