Suppose that there exists a non-zero section $s:\\mathbb{R}^3\\rightarrow E$ and $s$ vanishes at a point $p\\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. Prove that $E$ is not a trivial bundle.\n\nGiven $E \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3$ is a rank 2 vector bundle over $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Here, $s: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\rightarrow E$ be a non-zero section such that $s(p)=0$. In this problem, we need to prove that $E$ is not a trivial bundle.",
    "message_2": "Assume for contradiction that $E$ is a trivial bundle. Then $E \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $s_1, s_2: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\rightarrow E$ be two linearly independent sections, which can be thought of as two linearly independent vector fields on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Since $E$ is trivial, we can find global sections $s_1$ and $s_2$ that form a basis for the fibers of $E$ at each point in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. \n\nNow, consider the non-zero section $s: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\rightarrow E$ with $s(p) = 0$. Since $s_1$ and $s_2$ form a basis for the fibers of $E$, we can write $s$ as a linear combination of $s_1$ and $s_2$:\n\n$$s = f_1s_1 + f_2s_2$$\n\nwhere $f_1, f_2: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ are scalar functions. Since $s(p) = 0$, we have\n\n$$0 = f_1(p)s_1(p) + f_2(p)s_2(p)$$\n\nSince $s_1(p)$ and $s_2(p)$ are linearly independent, this implies that $f_1(p) = f_2(p) = 0$. However, this contradicts the fact that $s$ is a non-zero section, as $s$ would be identically zero on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, our assumption that $E$ is a trivial bundle must be false, and $E$ is not a trivial bundle."
