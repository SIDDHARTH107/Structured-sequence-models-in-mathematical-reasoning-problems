    "message_1": "Suppose you have two prime numbers, p = 17 and q = 11. Use the RSA encryption method to encrypt the message \"HELLO\" (where A = 1, B = 2, etc). Convert each letter to its corresponding number and perform the encryption using the public key e = 7 and the modulus N = 187. Provide the encrypted message in numerical form.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to convert the message \"HELLO\" into its numerical form using the given letter-to-number correspondence (A=1, B=2, etc.):\n\nH = 8\nE = 5\nL = 12\nL = 12\nO = 15\n\nNow, we will use the RSA encryption method with the public key e = 7 and the modulus N = 187. To encrypt each letter, we raise its numerical value to the power of e and then take the remainder when divided by N. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nC ≡ M^e (mod N)\n\nwhere C is the encrypted letter, M is the original numerical value of the letter, e is the public key, and N is the modulus.\n\nApplying this formula to each letter in the message:\n\nC_H ≡ 8^7 (mod 187) ≡ 105\nC_E ≡ 5^7 (mod 187) ≡ 45\nC_L ≡ 12^7 (mod 187) ≡ 106\nC_L ≡ 12^7 (mod 187) ≡ 106\nC_O ≡ 15^7 (mod 187) ≡ 152\n\nSo, the encrypted message in numerical form is:\n\n105 45 106 106 152"
