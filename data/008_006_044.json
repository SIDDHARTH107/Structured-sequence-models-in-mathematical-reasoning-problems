We can choose the simplest one:\n\nv₁ = [2; 1]\n\nFor λ₂ = -1:\n\n(A - (-1)I)v = 0\n[4, 4; 2, 2] * [x; y] = [0; 0]\n\n4x + 4y = 0\n2x + 2y = 0\n\nThese equations are linearly dependent, so we can just use the first equation:\n\n4x + 4y = 0\ny = -x\n\nThe eigenvector corresponding to λ₂ = -1 can be any scalar multiple of the vector [1; -1]. We can choose the simplest one:\n\nv₂ = [1; -1]\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ₁ = 5 and λ₂ = -1, and their corresponding eigenvectors are v₁ = [2; 1] and v₂ = [1; -1]."
