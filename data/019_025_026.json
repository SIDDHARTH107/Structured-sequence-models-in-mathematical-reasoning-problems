    "message_2": "Using the old materials, the average failure rate is 10%. So, for 1000 buildings, the number of buildings expected to experience failure would be:\n\n1000 buildings * 10% failure rate = 100 buildings\n\nNow, the new materials claim to reduce the occurrence of structural failures by 80%. So, the new failure rate would be:\n\n10% * (1 - 80%) = 10% * 20% = 2%\n\nWith the new materials, the number of buildings expected to experience failure would be:\n\n1000 buildings * 2% failure rate = 20 buildings"
