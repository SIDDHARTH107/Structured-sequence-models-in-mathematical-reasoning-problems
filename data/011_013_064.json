    "message_1": "In how many ways can you color the faces of a regular tetrahedron using 5 different colors if two colorings are considered the same if you can make one by rotating the other?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Burnside's Lemma, which states that the number of distinct colorings is equal to the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry of the tetrahedron.\n\nA regular tetrahedron has 12 symmetries: the identity (no rotation), 8 rotations by 120 degrees around an axis through a vertex and the center of the opposite face, and 3 rotations by 180 degrees around an axis through the midpoints of two opposite edges.\n\n1. Identity: All 5 colors can be used for each of the 4 faces, so there are 5^4 = 625 colorings fixed by the identity.\n\n2. 120-degree rotations: There are 8 of these rotations, and they each fix a coloring if all 3 faces around the vertex have the same color. There are 5 choices for this color, so each of these rotations fixes 5 colorings. In total, there are 8 * 5 = 40 colorings fixed by 120-degree rotations.\n\n3. 180-degree rotations: There are 3 of these rotations, and they each fix a coloring if the two faces that are swapped have the same color. There are 5 choices for the color of each pair of faces, so each of these rotations fixes 5^2 = 25 colorings. In total, there are 3 * 25 = 75 colorings fixed by 180-degree rotations.\n\nNow, we can apply Burnside's Lemma:\n\n(Number of distinct colorings) = (Total number of colorings fixed by all symmetries) / (Number of symmetries)\n= (625 + 40 + 75) / 12\n= 740 / 12\n= 61.67\n\nSince the number of distinct colorings must be an integer, we round up to 62. Therefore, there are 62 distinct ways to color the faces of a regular tetrahedron using 5 different colors, considering rotations as the same coloring."
