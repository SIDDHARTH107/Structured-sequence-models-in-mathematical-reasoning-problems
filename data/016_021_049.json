    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is created by successively replacing the sides of an equilateral triangle with a zigzag pattern. Each iteration scales the length of the sides by a factor of 2.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of each side is 2 times the original length.\nAfter the second iteration, the length of each side is 2 * 2 = 4 times the original length.\nAfter the third iteration, the length of each side is 2 * 4 = 8 times the original length.\nAfter the fourth iteration, the length of each side is 2 * 8 = 16 times the original length.\n\nSo, the scaling ratio of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after the fourth iteration is 16:1."
