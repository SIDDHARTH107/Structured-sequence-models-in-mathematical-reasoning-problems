    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, component failures) out of n trials (components)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (failure in this case) for each trial (component)\n- n is the number of trials (components)\n- k is the number of successes (failures) we want to find the probability for\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 5 (5 components)\n- k = 2 (we want to find the probability of exactly 2 components failing)\n- p = 0.2 (probability of failure due to a technological issue)\n\nFirst, let's find C(5, 2):\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / (2 * 6)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 2) = 10\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(5, 2) * 0.2^2 * (1-0.2)^(5-2)\nP(X = 2) = 10 * 0.04 * 0.8^3\nP(X = 2) = 10 * 0.04 * 0.512\nP(X = 2) = 10 * 0.02048\nP(X = 2) â‰ˆ 0.2048\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 2 of the components fail due to the technological issue is approximately 0.2048 or 20.48%."
