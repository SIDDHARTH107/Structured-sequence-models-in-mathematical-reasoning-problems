    "message_1": "A factory produces light bulbs with a probability of 0.05 that a bulb is defective. What is the probability that out of 200 light bulbs produced in a day, at least 10 of them will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective bulbs\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of a bulb being defective (0.05)\n- n is the total number of bulbs produced (200)\n- k is the number of defective bulbs (we want at least 10)\n\nSince we want the probability of having at least 10 defective bulbs, we need to calculate the probability of having 10, 11, 12, ..., 200 defective bulbs and sum them up. However, calculating this directly can be time-consuming. Instead, we can calculate the probability of having 0 to 9 defective bulbs and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we want to find:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9)]\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each case:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(200, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (1-0.05)^(200-0)\nP(X = 1) = C(200, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (1-0.05)^(200-1)\n...\nP(X = 9) = C(200, 9) * (0.05)^9 * (1-0.05)^(200-9)\n\nAfter calculating these probabilities, we can sum them up and subtract the result from 1 to get the probability of having at least 10 defective bulbs:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9)]\n\nUsing a calculator or programming language to compute the probabilities and sum them up, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) ≈ 1 - 0.031 = 0.969\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 light bulbs will be defective out of 200 produced in a day is approximately 0.969 or 96.9%."
