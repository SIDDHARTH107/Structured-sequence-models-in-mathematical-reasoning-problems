They surveyed the advertising expenditure (in thousand dollars) and corresponding sales (in million dollars) of a particular product for 10 weeks. The data below shows the result of the survey:\n\nAdvertising expenditure: 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 22, 24, 28, 30, 32\nSales: 4.5, 4.9, 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, 5.8, 5.9, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5\n\nUsing regression analysis, find the equation of the regression line that represents the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales in million dollars.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the regression line, we need to calculate the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b) of the line. The equation of the regression line is given by:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nwhere y represents sales (in million dollars) and x represents advertising expenditure (in thousand dollars).\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean of x (advertising expenditure) and y (sales):\n\nMean of x (advertising expenditure) = (6 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20 + 22 + 24 + 28 + 30 + 32) / 10 = 198 / 10 = 19.8\nMean of y (sales) = (4.5 + 4.9 + 5.1 + 5.3 + 5.5 + 5.8 + 5.9 + 6.2 + 6.4 + 6.5) / 10 = 55.1 / 10 = 5.51\n\nNext, we need to find the slope (m) of the regression line:\n\nm = Σ[(x - mean_x) * (y - mean_y)] / Σ(x - mean_x)^2\n\nCalculating the numerator and denominator separately:\n\nNumerator = Σ[(x - mean_x) * (y - mean_y)] = (6-19.8)(4.5-5.51) + (8-19.8)(4.9-5.51) + ... + (32-19.8)(6.5-5.51) = 102.96\n\nDenominator = Σ(x - mean_x)^2 = (6-19.8)^2 + (8-19.8)^2 + ... + (32-19.8)^2 = 1232\n\nNow, we can find the slope (m):\n\nm = 102.96 / 1232 = 0.0836\n\nNext, we need to find the y-intercept (b):\n\nb = mean_y - m * mean_x = 5.51 - 0.0836 * 19.8 = 3.8468\n\nFinally, we can write the equation of the regression line:\n\ny = 0.0836x + 3.8468\n\nSo, the equation of the regression line that represents the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales in million dollars is:\n\nSales = 0.0836 * Advertising expenditure + 3.8468"
