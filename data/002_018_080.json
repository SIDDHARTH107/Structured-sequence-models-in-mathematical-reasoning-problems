    "message_2": "To find the volume of the largest sphere that can be inscribed in the cube, we first need to determine the diameter of the sphere. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, its diameter will be equal to the side length of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Side length of the cube = 6 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the sphere by dividing the diameter by 2:\n\nRadius of the sphere = Diameter / 2 = 6 cm / 2 = 3 cm\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nPlugging in the radius:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * (3 cm)^3\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * 27 cm^3\n\nVolume ≈ 36π cm^3\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, the volume of the largest sphere that can be inscribed in the cube is approximately 113.10 cm^3."
