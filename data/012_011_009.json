    "message_2": "To identify the number of cut vertices and bridges in the graph, we need to consider the possible configurations of the graph. Since there are 7 vertices and 8 edges, the graph is not a complete graph and not a tree. One possible configuration is a cycle with an additional edge.\n\nLet's consider the following graph with vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, and edges as follows:\n\n1. A - B\n2. B - C\n3. C - D\n4. D - E\n5. E - F\n6. F - G\n7. G - A\n8. A - D\n\nIn this graph, there are no cut vertices, as removing any single vertex will not disconnect the graph. However, there is one bridge: the edge A - D. Removing this edge increases the number of connected components from 1 to 2.\n\nSo, in this particular configuration, there are 0 cut vertices and 1 bridge. Note that other configurations may have different numbers of cut vertices and bridges, but this example demonstrates that it is possible to have a graph with 7 vertices, 8 edges, and a non-zero number of bridges."
