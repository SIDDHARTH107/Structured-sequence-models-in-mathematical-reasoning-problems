    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the graph G for an Eulerian path. An Eulerian path is a path that visits every edge exactly once. A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it has at most two vertices with an odd degree (number of edges connected to the vertex).\n\nLet's find the degree of each vertex:\nA: degree 3 (connected to B, C, D)\nB: degree 4 (connected to A, D, E, F)\nC: degree 3 (connected to A, G, D)\nD: degree 4 (connected to A, B, C, E)\nE: degree 3 (connected to B, D, G)\nF: degree 2 (connected to B, G)\nG: degree 3 (connected to C, E, F)\n\nThere are four vertices with an odd degree (A, C, E, and G), so there is no Eulerian path in the graph G.\n\nNow let's analyze the graph G for a Hamiltonian path. A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits every vertex exactly once.\n\nWe can find a Hamiltonian path in the graph G as follows:\nA -> B -> D -> C -> G -> E -> F\n\nSo, there is a Hamiltonian path in the graph G."
