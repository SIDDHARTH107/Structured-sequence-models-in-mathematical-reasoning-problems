    "message_2": "In Pascal's Triangle, the value in the nth row and kth column can be found using the formula:\n\nC(n-1, k-1) = (n-1)! / [(k-1)! * (n-k)!]\n\nHere, n = 5 (fifth row) and k = 3 (third column). So, we have:\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!)\n\nC(4, 2) = 24 / (2 * 2)\n\nC(4, 2) = 24 / 4\n\nC(4, 2) = 6\n\nSo, the value in the fifth row and third column of Pascal's Triangle is 6."
