    "message_2": "To find the length of the curve, we need to use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x):\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nwhere a and b are the limits of integration (0 and 4 in this case), f'(x) is the derivative of the function with respect to x, and L is the length of the curve.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function y = 2x^(3/2):\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^(3/2))/dx = 3x^(1/2)\n\nNow, let's find (f'(x))^2:\n\n(f'(x))^2 = (3x^(1/2))^2 = 9x\n\nNext, we need to find the square root of (1 + (f'(x))^2):\n\nsqrt(1 + (f'(x))^2) = sqrt(1 + 9x)\n\nNow, we can set up the integral to find the length of the curve:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + 9x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let u = 1 + 9x, then du = 9 dx. Also, when x = 0, u = 1, and when x = 4, u = 1 + 9(4) = 37. Now, the integral becomes:\n\nL = (1/9) ∫[1, 37] sqrt(u) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (1/9) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2)) | [1, 37]\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nL = (2/27) * (37^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))\n\nL ≈ (2/27) * (216.0375 - 1) ≈ 15.93\n\nSo, the length of the curve is approximately 15.93 units."
