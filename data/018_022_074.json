    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - { } = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B ∆ A. Since the symmetric difference is commutative, B ∆ A is equal to A ∆ B.\n\nB ∆ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {2, 4, 1, 3, 5} - { } = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow we will find the Cartesian product of (A ∆ B) and (B ∆ A), denoted as (A ∆ B) x (B ∆ A). The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A ∆ B) x (B ∆ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product of (B ∆ A) and (A ∆ B), denoted as (B ∆ A) x (A ∆ B).\n\n(B ∆ A) x (A ∆ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n\nAs we can see, (A ∆ B) x (B ∆ A) is equal to (B ∆ A) x (A ∆ B). Both Cartesian products have the same ordered pairs. Therefore, the statement that (A ∆ B) x (B ∆ A) is not equal to (B ∆ A) x (A ∆ B) is false. They are equal."
