    "message_2": "To determine the values of the Chern classes c1, c2, and c3 of X, we can use the Chern roots (also known as Chern numbers) given. The Chern roots are the eigenvalues of the curvature tensor of the manifold, and they can be used to compute the Chern classes using the Newton's identities.\n\nLet r1, r2, and r3 be the Chern roots 2, 3, and 5, respectively. Then, we can compute the Chern classes as follows:\n\nc1 = r1 + r2 + r3\nc2 = r1*r2 + r1*r3 + r2*r3\nc3 = r1*r2*r3\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of the Chern roots:\n\nc1 = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10\nc2 = (2*3) + (2*5) + (3*5) = 6 + 10 + 15 = 31\nc3 = 2*3*5 = 30\n\nSo, the Chern classes of the complex manifold X are c1 = 10, c2 = 31, and c3 = 30."
