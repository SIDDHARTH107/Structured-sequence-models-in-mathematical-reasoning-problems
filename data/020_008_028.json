    "message_1": "A telecommunication company wants to lay fiber optic cables in a city to connect 10 buildings to a central location. The cost of laying cable per unit length varies depending on the type of terrain. The distances between the buildings and the central location are:\n\nBuilding 1: 8 km\nBuilding 2: 5 km\nBuilding 3: 11 km\nBuilding 4: 9 km\nBuilding 5: 14 km\nBuilding 6: 7 km\nBuilding 7: 10 km\nBuilding 8: 12 km\nBuilding 9: 6 km\nBuilding 10: 3 km\n\nThe cost of laying cable per kilometer in each type of terrain are as follows:\n- In urban areas, the cost is $10,000 per kilometer.\n- In suburban areas, the cost is $15,000 per kilometer.\n- In rural areas, the cost is $20,000 per kilometer.\n\nThe company wants to minimize the total cost of laying the cables while ensuring that each building is connected to the central location. Determine the optimal cable route that will minimize the total cost of laying the cables.",
