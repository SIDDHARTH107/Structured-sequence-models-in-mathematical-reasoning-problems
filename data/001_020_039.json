    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = |2x - 4| - 3\n\nNow, we need to isolate the absolute value:\n\n3 = |2x - 4|\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\n1) The expression inside the absolute value is positive or zero:\n\n2x - 4 = 3\n2x = 7\nx = 7/2\n\n2) The expression inside the absolute value is negative:\n\n-(2x - 4) = 3\n-2x + 4 = 3\n-2x = -1\nx = 1/2\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = 1/2 and x = 7/2."
