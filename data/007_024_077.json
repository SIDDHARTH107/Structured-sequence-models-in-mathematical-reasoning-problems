    "message_2": "To solve the discrete logarithm problem 3^x ≡ 4 (mod 7), we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x such that 3^x % 7 = 4.\n\nWe can do this by testing different values of x:\n\nx = 0: 3^0 % 7 = 1\nx = 1: 3^1 % 7 = 3\nx = 2: 3^2 % 7 = 2\nx = 3: 3^3 % 7 = 6\nx = 4: 3^4 % 7 = 4\n\nSo, the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies the equation is x = 4."
