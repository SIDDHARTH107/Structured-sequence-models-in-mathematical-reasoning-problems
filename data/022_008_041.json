    "message_2": "To find all complex numbers $z$ such that the entire function $f(z) = e^z + \\cos(z)$ satisfies $|f(z)| > 1$ for all $|z| > M$ for a real number $M$, we will first analyze the behavior of $e^z$ and $\\cos(z)$ for large $|z|$.\n\nFor $e^z$, we know that $|e^z| = e^{\\operatorname{Re}(z)}$, where $\\operatorname{Re}(z)$ denotes the real part of $z$. As $|z| \\to \\infty$, $\\operatorname{Re}(z)$ can become arbitrarily large, so $|e^z|$ can become arbitrarily large as well.\n\nFor $\\cos(z)$, we can write it in terms of its exponential form: $\\cos(z) = \\frac{e^{iz} + e^{-iz}}{2}$. The magnitudes of $e^{iz}$ and $e^{-iz}$ are both $1$, so the magnitude of their sum is at most $2$. Therefore, $|\\cos(z)| \\leq 1$ for all $z$.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $f(z) = e^z + \\cos(z)$. For large $|z|$, the magnitude of $e^z$ dominates the magnitude of $\\cos(z)$. Therefore, there exists a real number $M$ such that for all $|z| > M$, we have $|f(z)| > 1$.\n\nTo find the complex numbers $z$ for which $|f(z)| \\leq 1$, we can analyze the function $g(z) = e^z - 1 - \\cos(z)$. If $|f(z)| \\leq 1$, then $|g(z)| = 0$. We can write $g(z)$ as:\n\n$$g(z) = e^z - 1 - \\cos(z) = e^z - \\frac{e^{iz} + e^{-iz}}{2} - 1 = \\frac{2e^z - e^{iz} - e^{-iz} - 2}{2}.$$\n\nLet $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. Then we have:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{2e^x - e^{i(x+iy)} - e^{-i(x-iy)} - 2}{2} = \\frac{2e^x - e^{ix}e^{-y} - e^{-ix}e^y - 2}{2}.$$\n\nFor $|g(z)| = 0$, we need both the real and imaginary parts of $g(z)$ to be zero. The real part of $g(z)$ is:\n\n$$\\operatorname{Re}(g(z)) = \\frac{2e^x - (e^{ix}e^{-y} + e^{-ix}e^y)}{2} = e^x - \\frac{e^{-y}(\\cos(x) + e^{2y}\\cos(x))}{2}.$$\n\nSetting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n$$e^x = \\frac{e^{-y}(\\cos(x) + e^{2y}\\cos(x))}{2}.$$\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part of $g(z)$ is:\n\n$$\\operatorname{Im}(g(z)) = \\frac{-e^{ix}e^{-y} + e^{-ix}e^y}{2i} = \\frac{e^{-y}\\sin(x) - e^y\\sin(x)}{2i}.$$\n\nSetting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n$$e^{-y}\\sin(x) = e^y\\sin(x).$$\n\nFrom the equations above, we can see that there are no general solutions for $x$ and $y$ that satisfy both equations simultaneously. Therefore, there are no complex numbers $z$ such that $|f(z)| \\leq 1$ for all $|z| > M$ for a real number $M$."
