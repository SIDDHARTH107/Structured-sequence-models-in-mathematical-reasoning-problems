    "message_2": "To show that there exists an element c ∈ ℝ such that a < c < b, we can use the properties of the real numbers and the arithmetic operations in the model M.\n\nLet's consider the average of a and b. We can define c as:\n\nc = (a + b) / 2\n\nNow, let's show that a < c < b.\n\nFirst, we'll show that a < c:\n\nSince a < b, we can subtract a from both sides of the inequality:\n\nb - a > 0\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 2:\n\n(b - a) / 2 > 0\n\nAdding a to both sides of the inequality, we get:\n\na + (b - a) / 2 > a\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nc > a\n\nSo, a < c.\n\nNext, we'll show that c < b:\n\nWe already know that b - a > 0. Dividing both sides of the inequality by 2, we get:\n\n(b - a) / 2 > 0\n\nAdding a to both sides of the inequality, we get:\n\na + (b - a) / 2 < b\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nc < b\n\nSo, we have shown that a < c < b, and therefore, there exists an element c ∈ ℝ such that a < c < b."
