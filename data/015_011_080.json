    "message_2": "To find the maximum angle amplitude of the upper pendulum of a double pendulum, we need to consider the conservation of energy. The total energy of the system is conserved, which means that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies remains constant throughout the motion.\n\nInitially, the double pendulum is released from rest, so the kinetic energy is zero. The potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of both pendulums. Let's denote the initial angle of the upper pendulum as θ1 and the initial angle of the lower pendulum as θ2. Since the lower pendulum is hanging vertically at the start, θ2 = 0°. The initial angle of the upper pendulum is given as 60°, so θ1 = 60°.\n\nThe potential energy of the upper pendulum is given by:\nPE1 = m1 * g * h1\nwhere m1 is the mass of the upper pendulum, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²), and h1 is the vertical displacement of the upper pendulum from its equilibrium position.\n\nThe potential energy of the lower pendulum is given by:\nPE2 = m2 * g * h2\nwhere m2 is the mass of the lower pendulum, and h2 is the vertical displacement of the lower pendulum from its equilibrium position.\n\nThe total potential energy is given by:\nPE_total = PE1 + PE2\n\nNow, let's find the vertical displacements h1 and h2. Since the rod lengths are given as 1 meter and 0.5 meters, we can use trigonometry to find the vertical displacements.\n\nFor the upper pendulum:\nh1 = L1 * (1 - cos(θ1))\nwhere L1 is the length of the upper pendulum (1 meter).\n\nFor the lower pendulum:\nh2 = L1 * (1 - cos(θ1)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2))\nwhere L2 is the length of the lower pendulum (0.5 meters).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and find the total potential energy:\nh1 = 1 * (1 - cos(60°)) = 1 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.5 meters\nh2 = 1 * (1 - cos(60°)) + 0.5 * (1 - cos(0°)) = 0.5 + 0 = 0.5 meters\n\nAssuming both pendulums have the same mass (m1 = m2 = m), the total potential energy is:\nPE_total = m * g * (h1 + h2) = m * g * (0.5 + 0.5) = m * g\n\nAt the maximum angle amplitude of the upper pendulum, the lower pendulum will be hanging vertically (θ2 = 0°). The total energy of the system is still conserved, so the sum of the kinetic and potential energies remains constant.\n\nAt this point, the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy is given by:\nPE1_max = m1 * g * h1_max\nPE2_max = m2 * g * h2_max\n\nSince the lower pendulum is hanging vertically, h2_max = 0. The total potential energy is now:\nPE_total_max = PE1_max + PE2_max = m1 * g * h1_max + m2 * g * h2_max = m * g * h1_max\n\nSince the total energy is conserved, we have:\nPE_total = PE_total_max\nm * g = m * g * h1_max\n\nSolving for h1_max, we get:\nh1_max = 1\n\nNow, we can use trigonometry to find the maximum angle amplitude of the upper pendulum:\ncos(θ1_max) = 1 - h1_max / L1\ncos(θ1_max) = 1 - 1 / 1 = 0\n\nθ1_max = arccos(0) = 90°\n\nSo, the maximum angle amplitude reached by the upper pendulum of the double pendulum is 90 degrees."
