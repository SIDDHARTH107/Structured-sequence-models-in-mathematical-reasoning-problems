    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity vector, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry. Since the boat is moving in a South-East direction, its velocity can be broken down into two components: Eastward (x-axis) and Southward (y-axis). \n\nLet Vx be the Eastward component and Vy be the Southward component of the velocity vector. Since the boat is moving at an equal speed in both directions (South-East), we can say:\n\nVx = Vy\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the velocity vector (V):\n\nV^2 = Vx^2 + Vy^2\n\nSince Vx = Vy, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nV^2 = 2 * Vx^2\n\nNow, we know the speed of the boat is 10 meters/second, so:\n\nV = 10\n\nSubstitute the value of V in the equation:\n\n10^2 = 2 * Vx^2\n\n100 = 2 * Vx^2\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n50 = Vx^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nVx = sqrt(50)\n\nVx = 5 * sqrt(2)\n\nSince Vx = Vy, we can say:\n\nVy = 5 * sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we have the Eastward and Southward components of the velocity vector. To find the direction with respect to the East, we can use the inverse tangent function (arctan):\n\ntan(θ) = Vy / Vx\n\nθ = arctan(Vy / Vx)\n\nSince Vy = Vx:\n\nθ = arctan(1)\n\nθ = 45 degrees\n\nSo, the magnitude of the boat's velocity vector is 10 meters/second, and the direction is 45 degrees South of East."
