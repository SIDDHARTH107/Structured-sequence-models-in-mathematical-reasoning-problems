Determine the maximum height above the ground that a rider will reach on the Ferris wheel, and at what times during the rotation this height is reached.",
    "message_2": "The maximum height a rider will reach on the Ferris wheel can be found by adding the radius of the wheel to the distance it is above the ground. Since the diameter of the wheel is 50 meters, the radius is half of that, which is 25 meters. The wheel is located 20 meters above the ground, so the maximum height a rider will reach is:\n\nMaximum height = Radius + Distance above ground\nMaximum height = 25 meters + 20 meters\nMaximum height = 45 meters\n\nNow, we need to determine at what times during the rotation this height is reached. Since the wheel completes one rotation in 4 minutes, the rider will be at the maximum height when they are at the top of the wheel. This occurs twice during one rotation: once when the rider starts at the top and once when they complete the rotation and return to the top.\n\nTo find the time it takes for the rider to reach the maximum height for the first time, we can simply divide the rotation time by 2:\n\nTime to reach maximum height (first time) = Rotation time / 2\nTime to reach maximum height (first time) = 4 minutes / 2\nTime to reach maximum height (first time) = 2 minutes\n\nThe rider will reach the maximum height for the second time when they complete the rotation and return to the top:\n\nTime to reach maximum height (second time) = Rotation time\nTime to reach maximum height (second time) = 4 minutes\n\nSo, a rider will reach the maximum height of 45 meters above the ground at 2 minutes and 4 minutes during the rotation."
