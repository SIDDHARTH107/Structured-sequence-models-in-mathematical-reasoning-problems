    "message_2": "Let's analyze each case:\n\n1. Isomorphism to the cyclic group C18:\nA group of order 18 is isomorphic to C18 if and only if it is cyclic. There is only one cyclic group of order 18 up to isomorphism, so there is only 1 possibility in this case.\n\n2. Isomorphism to the non-abelian group of order 18:\nA non-abelian group of order 18 has a unique structure up to isomorphism, which is the semidirect product of C9 and C2. This group has a presentation of the form ⟨a, b | a^9 = 1, b^2 = 1, bab^(-1) = a^k⟩, where k is an integer coprime to 9 (k can be 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8). However, these different values of k give isomorphic groups, so there is only 1 possibility in this case.\n\n3. Isomorphism to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6:\nA group of order 18 is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6 if and only if it is isomorphic to C3 × C6. There is only one such group up to isomorphism, so there is only 1 possibility in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 different isomorphisms possible for a group of order 18."
