    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, width of 6 cm, and height of 10 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism? Round your answer to one decimal place.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nIn this case, the length is 8 cm, the width is 6 cm, and the height is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiagonal length = √(8² + 6² + 10²) = √(64 + 36 + 100) = √200\n\nNow, we can approximate the square root of 200:\n\n√200 ≈ 14.1\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 14.1 cm."
