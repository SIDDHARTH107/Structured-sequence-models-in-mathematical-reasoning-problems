    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(3,4) is the smallest integer n such that any graph with n vertices will contain either a clique of size 3 (a triangle) or an independent set of size 4 (a set of four vertices with no edges between them). The value of R(3,4) is 9.\n\nTo prove this, we can use a combination of the Pigeonhole Principle and the Ramsey's Theorem.\n\nFirst, we will show that R(3,4) ≤ 9:\n\nConsider a graph G with 9 vertices. Pick a vertex v in G. There are 8 other vertices connected to v, and each of these connections can be either red or blue. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least ⌈8/2⌉ = 4 vertices connected to v with the same color, say red.\n\nNow, consider these 4 vertices. If any of them are connected by a red edge, then we have a red triangle, and we are done. If none of them are connected by a red edge, then all the edges between these 4 vertices must be blue, and we have a blue K₄ (a complete graph with 4 vertices). In either case, we have shown that a graph with 9 vertices must contain either a red triangle or a blue K₄, so R(3,4) ≤ 9.\n\nNext, we will show that R(3,4) > 8:\n\nConsider the following graph G with 8 vertices: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. Color the edges as follows:\n\n- Red edges: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD\n- Blue edges: AE, AF, AG, BE, BF, BG, CE, CF, CH, DE, DF, DH, EF, EG, EH, FG, FH, GH\n\nIn this graph, there are no red triangles and no blue K₄. To see this, note that the red edges form two disjoint red paths of length 3 (A-B-C-D and A-C-B-D). There are no red triangles since adding a red edge between any two vertices in the same path would create a red cycle of length 4, which is not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, there are no blue K₄ in this graph. To see this, note that each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices by blue edges. If there were a blue K₄, then one of the vertices in the K₄ would have to be connected to all 3 other vertices by blue edges, which is not possible since each vertex is connected to only 3 other vertices by blue edges.\n\nSince there is a graph with 8 vertices that does not contain a red triangle or a blue K₄, we have R(3,4) > 8.\n\nCombining these two results, we have R(3,4) = 9."
