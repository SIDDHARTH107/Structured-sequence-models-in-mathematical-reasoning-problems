The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = 2sin(3x)\ndy/dx = d(2sin(3x))/dx\n\nThe outer function is 2sin(u) and the inner function is u = 3x. \n\nFirst, find the derivative of the outer function with respect to u:\nd(2sin(u))/du = 2cos(u)\n\nNext, find the derivative of the inner function with respect to x:\nd(3x)/dx = 3\n\nNow, apply the chain rule:\ndy/dx = (d(2sin(u))/du) * (d(3x)/dx)\ndy/dx = 2cos(u) * 3\ndy/dx = 6cos(3x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = π/6:\ndy/dx = 6cos(3(π/6))\ndy/dx = 6cos(π/2)\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0, the derivative at x = π/6 is:\n\ndy/dx = 6 * 0 = 0"
