    "message_1": "A student is given the following problem: \n\n\"Suppose we have two algebraic curves in the plane given by the equations x^2 + y^2 = 4 and y = -x + 2. How many points of intersection do these curves have?\"\n\nThe student needs to apply the Bezout's theorem to solve this problem. According to the theorem, the total number of intersection points of two polynomial curves equals the product of their degrees. In this case, both curves have degree 2, so the product of their degrees is 4. Therefore, the two curves must intersect at exactly 4 points. The student should find the coordinates of these points as well to complete the solution.",
    "message_2": "To find the coordinates of the intersection points, we can substitute the equation of one curve into the other. Let's substitute y from the second equation into the first equation:\n\nx^2 + (-x + 2)^2 = 4\n\nNow, expand and simplify the equation:\n\nx^2 + (x^2 - 4x + 4) = 4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x^2 - 4x = 0\n\nFactor out a 2x:\n\n2x(x - 2) = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 0 or x = 2\n\nFor each value of x, we can find the corresponding value of y using the equation y = -x + 2:\n\nWhen x = 0, y = -0 + 2 = 2\nWhen x = 2, y = -2 + 2 = 0\n\nSo, the two intersection points are (0, 2) and (2, 0).\n\nHowever, we previously concluded that there should be 4 intersection points based on Bezout's theorem. This apparent discrepancy is because Bezout's theorem counts intersection points with multiplicity, and it also includes points at infinity for certain cases. In this particular problem, the two intersection points we found are the only \"real\" intersection points, and the other two points are complex or at infinity. Therefore, the student's final answer should be that there are 2 real intersection points, with coordinates (0, 2) and (2, 0)."
