    "message_1": "A company hires a CEO to make decisions on their behalf. The CEO's effort level directly affects the company's profits. The relationship between the CEO's effort level and the company's profits is given by the function, P(e) = 20e - e^2, where e is the effort level, and P(e) is the company's profits.\n\nHowever, the CEO's effort level is not directly observable by the company's owners, and the CEO may choose to shirk (i.e. put in less effort than optimal). The cost of shirking for the CEO is given by the function, C(e) = 2e^2, where C(e) is the cost to the CEO of putting in effort level e.\n\nWhat is the optimal effort level for the CEO, given that the owners want to maximize their profits and the CEO wants to minimize their costs?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal effort level for the CEO, we need to consider both the company's profits and the CEO's costs. We can create a combined function that represents the net benefit to the company and the CEO:\n\nNet Benefit (NB) = P(e) - C(e)\n\nSubstitute the given functions:\n\nNB(e) = (20e - e^2) - (2e^2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nNB(e) = 20e - e^2 - 2e^2\nNB(e) = 20e - 3e^2\n\nTo find the optimal effort level, we need to find the maximum point of the NB(e) function. We can do this by taking the first derivative of NB(e) with respect to e and setting it equal to 0:\n\nNB'(e) = d(20e - 3e^2)/de\nNB'(e) = 20 - 6e\n\nSet the first derivative equal to 0 and solve for e:\n\n20 - 6e = 0\n6e = 20\ne = 20/6\ne = 10/3 â‰ˆ 3.33\n\nThe optimal effort level for the CEO is approximately 3.33, given that the owners want to maximize their profits and the CEO wants to minimize their costs."
