    "message_2": "The Rössler system is a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations that describe a continuous-time dynamical system. It is defined as follows:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nTo find the value of the chaotic attractor for the given parameter values (a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7), we need to numerically integrate the system of equations and observe the long-term behavior of the system.\n\nHowever, as a text-based AI, I am unable to perform numerical simulations. I recommend using a numerical integration tool or software like MATLAB, Python, or Mathematica to simulate the Rössler system with the given parameter values and observe the chaotic attractor.\n\nKeep in mind that chaotic attractors are characterized by their complex and unpredictable behavior, so there isn't a single \"value\" for the attractor. Instead, you will observe a set of points in the phase space that the system visits over time, forming a characteristic shape."
