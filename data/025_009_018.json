    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the moduli space of smooth plane cubic curves passing through 8 distinct points in general position in the plane, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Determine the dimension of the space of all plane cubic curves.\n2. Determine the number of conditions imposed by the 8 distinct points.\n3. Subtract the number of conditions from the dimension of the space of all plane cubic curves.\n\n1. A general plane cubic curve can be represented by the equation:\n\n   Ax^3 + By^3 + Cx^2y + Dxy^2 + Ex^2 + Fy^2 + Gxy + Hx + Iy + J = 0\n\nThere are 10 coefficients (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J), so the space of all plane cubic curves is a 10-dimensional projective space, P^9.\n\n2. Each of the 8 distinct points in general position imposes one independent condition on the coefficients of the cubic curve. This is because the curve must pass through each of these points, which means that the equation of the curve must be satisfied for the coordinates of each point.\n\n3. Now, we subtract the number of conditions (8) from the dimension of the space of all plane cubic curves (10):\n\n   Dimension of moduli space = 10 - 8 = 2\n\nSo, the dimension of the moduli space of smooth plane cubic curves passing through 8 distinct points in general position in the plane is 2."
