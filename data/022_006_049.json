    "message_2": "To prove that the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ is attained on the boundary of the unit disc, we will use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that if a function is holomorphic (complex differentiable) in a bounded domain, then the maximum of its modulus is attained on the boundary of the domain.\n\nFirst, we need to show that $f(z)$ is holomorphic in the unit disc. Both $e^z$ and $\\cos(z)$ are holomorphic functions, and the difference of holomorphic functions is also holomorphic. Therefore, $f(z)$ is holomorphic in the unit disc.\n\nNow, we can apply the Maximum Modulus Principle. Since $f(z)$ is holomorphic in the unit disc, the maximum of $|f(z)|$ must be attained on the boundary of the disc.\n\nTo find the maximum value, we need to consider the boundary of the unit disc, which is given by $|z| = 1$. Let $z = e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. Then, we have:\n\n$$f(e^{i\\theta}) = e^{e^{i\\theta}} - \\cos(e^{i\\theta}) = e^{\\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)} - (\\cos(\\cos(\\theta)) - i\\sin(\\sin(\\theta)))$$\n\nNow, let's find the modulus of $f(e^{i\\theta})$:\n\n$$|f(e^{i\\theta})| = |e^{\\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)} - (\\cos(\\cos(\\theta)) - i\\sin(\\sin(\\theta)))|$$\n\nBy the triangle inequality, we have:\n\n$$|f(e^{i\\theta})| \\geq |e^{\\cos(\\theta)}| - |\\cos(\\cos(\\theta)) - i\\sin(\\sin(\\theta))|$$\n\nSince $e^{\\cos(\\theta)} \\geq 1$ and $|\\cos(\\cos(\\theta)) - i\\sin(\\sin(\\theta))| \\leq 1$, we have:\n\n$$|f(e^{i\\theta})| \\geq 1 - 1 = 0$$\n\nNow, let's find an upper bound for $|f(e^{i\\theta})|$:\n\n$$|f(e^{i\\theta})| \\leq |e^{\\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)}| + |\\cos(\\cos(\\theta)) - i\\sin(\\sin(\\theta))|$$\n\nSince $|e^{\\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)}| = e^{\\cos(\\theta)} \\leq e$ and $|\\cos(\\cos(\\theta)) - i\\sin(\\sin(\\theta))| \\leq 1$, we have:\n\n$$|f(e^{i\\theta})| \\leq e + 1$$\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on the unit disc is attained on the boundary of the disc, and the maximum value is between $0$ and $e + 1$. To find the exact maximum value, we can numerically search for the $\\theta$ that maximizes $|f(e^{i\\theta})|$."
