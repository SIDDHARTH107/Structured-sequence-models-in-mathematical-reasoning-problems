    "message_2": "The given figure is a square with four edges divided into two parts each. To find the fundamental group of the space obtained by gluing the edges, we first need to identify the gluing pattern.\n\nSince there is no specific gluing pattern provided, we will assume the simplest gluing pattern, which is to glue the opposite edges together. This results in a torus. The fundamental group of a torus is known to be the direct product of two infinite cyclic groups, which can be denoted as:\n\nπ1(Torus) = Z × Z\n\nHere, Z represents the integers, and the direct product Z × Z is the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) with the group operation being component-wise addition. So, the fundamental group of the space obtained from gluing the edges of the square together in this pattern is Z × Z."
