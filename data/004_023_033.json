    "message_2": "To find the area between the curves y = x² and y = x + 2 in the interval [0, 2], we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx² = x + 2\n\nRearrange the equation to find the roots:\n\nx² - x - 2 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -1, and c = -2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (1 ± √((-1)² - 4(1)(-2))) / 2(1)\nx = (1 ± √(1 + 8)) / 2\nx = (1 ± √9) / 2\nx = (1 ± 3) / 2\n\nThis gives us two roots: x = -1 and x = 2. However, since we are only interested in the interval [0, 2], we can ignore the root x = -1.\n\nNow, we need to integrate the difference between the two curves over the interval [0, 2]:\n\nArea = ∫(x + 2 - x²) dx from 0 to 2\n\nTo integrate, we find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n\n∫(x + 2 - x²) dx = (1/2)x² + 2x - (1/3)x³ + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of the interval:\n\nArea = [(1/2)(2)² + 2(2) - (1/3)(2)³] - [(1/2)(0)² + 2(0) - (1/3)(0)³]\nArea = [(1/2)(4) + 4 - (8/3)] - [0]\nArea = [2 + 4 - (8/3)]\nArea = (6 - 8/3)\n\nTo find a common denominator, we can multiply 6 by 3/3:\n\nArea = (18/3 - 8/3)\nArea = 10/3\n\nSo, the area between the curves y = x² and y = x + 2 in the interval [0, 2] is 10/3 square units."
