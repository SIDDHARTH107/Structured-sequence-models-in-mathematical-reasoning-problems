    "message_1": "A telecommunications company wants to lay a fiber optic cable network connecting 5 different cities. Each city is connected to at least two other cities with different distances and costs. The cost of laying cables between any two cities is proportional to the distance between them. The length and the cost of each cable for the 5 cities are given below:\n\n| City | Connected City | Distance (km) | Cost ($) |\n|------|----------------|--------------|----------|\n| A | B, C | 60, 80 | 10, 20 |\n| B | A, C, D | 60, 50, 40 | 10, 15, 25 |\n| C | A, B, D, E | 80, 50, 60, 70 | 20, 15, 30, 25 |\n| D | B, C, E | 40, 60, 50 | 25, 30, 20 |\n| E | C, D | 70, 50 | 25, 20 |\n\nThe company wants to minimize the total cost of laying cables connecting all 5 cities. Find the optimal network and the minimum cost of laying cables.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal network and the minimum cost of laying cables, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. This algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree for a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. In this case, the cities are the nodes, and the edges are the connections between cities with their respective costs.\n\nFirst, we list all the edges in ascending order of their costs:\n\n1. A-B (10)\n2. B-C (15)\n3. D-E (20)\n4. A-C (20)\n5. B-D (25)\n6. C-E (25)\n7. C-D (30)\n\nNext, we start adding edges to the minimum spanning tree, making sure not to create any cycles:\n\n1. Add A-B (10)\n2. Add B-C (15)\n3. Add D-E (20)\n4. A-C would create a cycle, so skip it.\n5. Add B-D (25)\n6. C-E would create a cycle, so skip it.\n7. C-D would create a cycle, so skip it.\n\nThe optimal network is A-B, B-C, D-E, and B-D, with a minimum cost of 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 = $70."
