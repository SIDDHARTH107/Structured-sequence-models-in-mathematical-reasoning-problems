    "message_2": "Yes, I can show that there are exactly three non-isomorphic groups of order 18 using Group Theory. Let's denote the order of a group as |G|. If |G| = 18, then the prime factorization of 18 is 2 * 3^2. We will use the Sylow Theorems to analyze the possible structures of groups of order 18.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By Sylow's First Theorem, there must be at least one subgroup of order 2. By Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 9 (3^2) and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, which means it is normal.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: By Sylow's First Theorem, there must be at least one subgroup of order 9. By Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possibilities are 1 or 2 Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nNow we consider the possibilities:\n\nCase 1: There is exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, both the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup are normal. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since both are normal, their product PQ is also a subgroup, and |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q|. Since P and Q have coprime orders, their intersection is just the identity element, so |PQ| = 18. Thus, PQ = G, and G is the direct product of P and Q. This gives us the Abelian group Z_2 x Z_9, which is isomorphic to Z_18.\n\nCase 2: There are exactly two Sylow 3-subgroups. Let Q1 and Q2 be these subgroups. Since there are only two, neither can be normal. Let P be the normal Sylow 2-subgroup. Consider the action of P on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation. This action is transitive, so there is an element p in P such that pQ1p^(-1) = Q2. Now consider the semi-direct product of P and Q1, denoted as Q1 ⋊ P. This is a group of order 18, and it is non-Abelian since the action of P on Q1 is non-trivial.\n\nWe have found three groups of order 18:\n\n1. Z_18: This is an Abelian group. The orders of its elements are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n2. Z_9 x Z_2: This is also an Abelian group. The orders of its elements are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n3. Q1 ⋊ P: This is a non-Abelian group. The orders of its elements can be more complicated, but they must divide the order of the group, so they can be 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, or 18.\n\nThese are the three non-isomorphic groups of order 18. Two of them (Z_18 and Z_9 x Z_2) are Abelian, and one (Q1 ⋊ P) is non-Abelian."
