    "message_2": "To calculate the Lyapunov exponent for this system, we first need to find the difference between the two initial conditions after n iterations. Let's denote the difference as Δx_n. Then, we can use the formula for the Lyapunov exponent:\n\nLyapunov exponent (λ) = (1/n) * ln(|Δx_n / Δx_0|)\n\nLet's first find the difference between the two initial conditions:\n\nΔx_0 = x0_2 - x0_1 = 0.1001 - 0.1 = 0.0001\n\nNow, let's iterate the map for both initial conditions:\n\nx1_1 = 4 * 0.1 * (1 - 0.1) = 0.36\nx1_2 = 4 * 0.1001 * (1 - 0.1001) ≈ 0.3604\n\nΔx_1 = x1_2 - x1_1 ≈ 0.3604 - 0.36 = 0.0004\n\nx2_1 = 4 * 0.36 * (1 - 0.36) = 0.9216\nx2_2 = 4 * 0.3604 * (1 - 0.3604) ≈ 0.9225\n\nΔx_2 = x2_2 - x2_1 ≈ 0.9225 - 0.9216 = 0.0009\n\nWe can continue this process for n iterations, but for the sake of simplicity, let's assume n = 2. Then, we can calculate the Lyapunov exponent:\n\nλ = (1/2) * ln(|Δx_2 / Δx_0|) = (1/2) * ln(|0.0009 / 0.0001|) ≈ 0.9163\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent for this system is approximately 0.9163. Note that this is just an approximation, and the exponent will change as we increase the number of iterations (n). A positive Lyapunov exponent indicates that the system is chaotic, which is consistent with the behavior of the logistic map for certain parameter values."
