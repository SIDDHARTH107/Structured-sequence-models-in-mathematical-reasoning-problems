    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nConsidering the optimization problem of finding the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 5cos(10x), where x can range from -4.5 to 4.5, use differential evolution algorithm to find the global minimum value of this function with a tolerance of 0.001. Choose the population size to be 20, the maximum number of generations to be 100, and the crossover and mutation rates to be 0.8 and 0.2, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the differential evolution algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population with 20 random individuals within the range of [-4.5, 4.5].\n2. For each generation, perform the following steps:\n   a. For each individual in the population, create a trial vector by applying mutation and crossover operations.\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the trial vector using the function f(x) = x^2 - 5cos(10x).\n   c. If the trial vector's fitness is better than the individual's fitness, replace the individual with the trial vector.\n3. Repeat steps 2a-2c for 100 generations or until the global minimum value is found within the tolerance of 0.001.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the differential evolution algorithm to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 - 5 * np.cos(10 * x)\n\ndef differential_evolution(pop_size, max_generations, crossover_rate, mutation_rate, tolerance):\n    population = np.random.uniform(-4.5, 4.5, pop_size)\n    fitness = f(population)\n\n    for generation in range(max_generations):\n        for i in range(pop_size):\n            a, b, c = np.random.choice(pop_size, 3, replace=False)\n            while a == i or b == i or c == i:\n                a, b, c = np.random.choice(pop_size, 3, replace=False)\n\n            trial_vector = population[a] + mutation_rate * (population[b] - population[c])\n\n            if np.random.rand() < crossover_rate:\n                trial_vector = population[i]\n\n            trial_fitness = f(trial_vector)\n\n            if trial_fitness < fitness[i]:\n                population[i] = trial_vector\n                fitness[i] = trial_fitness\n\n        best_fitness = np.min(fitness)\n        if best_fitness <= tolerance:\n            break\n\n    return best_fitness\n\nresult = differential_evolution(20, 100, 0.8, 0.2, 0.001)\nprint(\"Global minimum value: {:.4f}\".format(result))\n```\n\nThis code will output the global minimum value of the function f(x) within the given tolerance. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm."
