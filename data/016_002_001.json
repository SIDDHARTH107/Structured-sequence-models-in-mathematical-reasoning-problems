    "message_2": "A Koch snowflake is formed by adding a smaller equilateral triangle to each side of the original equilateral triangle, and then repeating this process for each new side created. After each iteration, the number of sides increases and the length of each side decreases.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the original equilateral triangle as s and the number of iterations as n. The perimeter of the Koch snowflake after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = s * (3 * (4/3)^n)\n\nIn this case, s = 2 cm and n = 4 iterations. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (3 * (4/3)^4)\nPerimeter = 2 * (3 * (256/81))\nPerimeter = 2 * (768/81)\n\nThe perimeter of the Koch snowflake after 4 iterations is (1536/81) cm, which is approximately 18.96 cm."
