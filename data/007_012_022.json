    "message_2": "Using Wilson's theorem, we know that for a prime number p, (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p), which can be written as (p-1)! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p). This means that (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that the given condition holds. Since we are looking for a positive integer greater than 1, we can start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\nFor p = 2, (2-1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is divisible by 2.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer n greater than 1 such that (n-1)! + 1 is divisible by n is n = 2."
