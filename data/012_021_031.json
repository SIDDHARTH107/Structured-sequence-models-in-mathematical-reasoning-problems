    "message_2": "The treewidth of the given graph is 2.\n\nTo see this, consider the following tree decomposition:\n\nBag 1: {1, 2, 3}\nBag 2: {2, 3, 4}\nBag 3: {2, 5, 6}\nBag 4: {4, 5, 6}\n\nEach bag has at most 3 vertices, and the graph formed by connecting the bags according to the adjacency in the original graph is a tree. This tree decomposition has width 2 (since the maximum number of vertices in a bag minus 1 is 3 - 1 = 2), which means the treewidth of the graph is 2."
