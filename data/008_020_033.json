    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of operations to transform the given system into an upper triangular matrix, and then solve for the variables using back substitution.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| 1 -3  2 |  4 |\n| 2  5 -1 | -1 |\n| 7 -4  2 |  5 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the x terms from the second and third rows:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2*Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 7*Row1\n\n| 1 -3  2 |  4  |\n| 0 11 -5 | -9  |\n| 0 17 -12 | -23 |\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the y term from the third row:\n\nRow3 = Row3 - (17/11)*Row2\n\n| 1 -3  2  |  4   |\n| 0 11 -5  | -9   |\n| 0  0  1  |  2   |\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix. We can use back substitution to solve for the variables.\n\nStep 4: Back substitution:\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\nz = 2\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n11y - 5z = -9\n11y - 5(2) = -9\n11y - 10 = -9\n11y = 1\ny = 1/11\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\nx - 3y + 2z = 4\nx - 3(1/11) + 2(2) = 4\nx - 3/11 + 4 = 4\nx = 4 + 3/11 - 4\nx = 3/11\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\nx = 3/11, y = 1/11, z = 2"
