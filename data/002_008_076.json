    "message_1": "A cone has a height of 10 cm and a radius of 4 cm. What is its volume in cubic centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the height (h) is 10 cm and the radius (r) is 4 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(4)²(10)\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(16)(10)\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(160)\n\nVolume ≈ (1/3)(3.14159)(160)\n\nVolume ≈ 167.5516 cm³\n\nThe volume of the cone is approximately 167.55 cubic centimeters."
