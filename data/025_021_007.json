    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to Mirror symmetry in Algebraic geometry:\n\nConsider two Calabi-Yau manifolds X and Y such that X has Hodge numbers h11 = 2 and h21 = 20, and Y has Hodge numbers h11 = 20 and h21 = 2. If the mirror map f: H2(X, Z) ⇝ H2(Y, Z) is given by f([ω]) = 2πi(∫ω_X - ∫ω_Y), where ω is a basis of H2(X, Z) and ω_X, ω_Y are the corresponding periods of X and Y, respectively, then what is the image of the element [ω] = [X] - 5[B], where B is the hyperplane class of X and [X], [B] are the corresponding cohomology classes?",
    "message_2": "To find the image of the element [ω] = [X] - 5[B] under the mirror map f, we first need to compute the periods of [ω] on both X and Y.\n\nLet ω_X = ∫[ω]_X and ω_Y = ∫[ω]_Y be the periods of [ω] on X and Y, respectively. Since [ω] = [X] - 5[B], we have:\n\nω_X = ∫([X] - 5[B])_X = ∫[X]_X - 5∫[B]_X\nω_Y = ∫([X] - 5[B])_Y = ∫[X]_Y - 5∫[B]_Y\n\nNow, we can apply the mirror map f to [ω]:\n\nf([ω]) = 2πi(ω_X - ω_Y) = 2πi(∫[X]_X - 5∫[B]_X - ∫[X]_Y + 5∫[B]_Y)\n\nTo compute the image of [ω] under the mirror map f, we need to know the values of the periods ∫[X]_X, ∫[B]_X, ∫[X]_Y, and ∫[B]_Y. These values depend on the specific Calabi-Yau manifolds X and Y and their geometric properties. Without more information about X and Y, we cannot provide a numerical answer for the image of [ω] under the mirror map f."
