    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = |x| in the interval (-π, π), we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ. Since f(x) is an even function (f(-x) = f(x)), all the bₙ coefficients will be zero. We only need to compute a₀ and aₙ.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series of a function f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = (a₀/2) + Σ[aₙcos(nx) + bₙsin(nx)]\n\nFor an even function, the Fourier series becomes:\n\nf(x) = (a₀/2) + Σ[aₙcos(nx)]\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients a₀ and aₙ.\n\na₀ = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)]dx from -π to π\n\na₀ = (1/π) * ∫[|x|]dx from -π to π\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [∫[-x]dx from -π to 0 + ∫[x]dx from 0 to π]\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [(-x^2/2)|(-π to 0) + (x^2/2)|(0 to π)]\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [(-0^2/2 - (-π^2/2)) + (π^2/2 - 0^2/2)]\n\na₀ = (1/π) * (π^2)\n\na₀ = π\n\nNow, let's compute aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)cos(nx)]dx from -π to π\n\naₙ = (1/π) * ∫[|x|cos(nx)]dx from -π to π\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [∫[-x*cos(nx)]dx from -π to 0 + ∫[x*cos(nx)]dx from 0 to π]\n\nTo compute the integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = cos(nx)dx\nThen, du = dx and v = (1/n)sin(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\nFor the first integral:\n∫[-x*cos(nx)]dx from -π to 0 = [(-x/n)sin(nx)]|(-π to 0) - ∫[(1/n)sin(nx)]dx from -π to 0\n= [(-x/n)sin(nx)]|(-π to 0) + (1/n^2)[cos(nx)]|(-π to 0)\n\nFor the second integral:\n∫[x*cos(nx)]dx from 0 to π = [(x/n)sin(nx)]|(0 to π) - ∫[(1/n)sin(nx)]dx from 0 to π\n= [(x/n)sin(nx)]|(0 to π) - (1/n^2)[cos(nx)]|(0 to π)\n\nNow, let's add both integrals:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * { [(-x/n)sin(nx)]|(-π to 0) + (1/n^2)[cos(nx)]|(-π to 0) + [(x/n)sin(nx)]|(0 to π) - (1/n^2)[cos(nx)]|(0 to π) }\n\naₙ = (1/π) * { (1/n^2)[cos(nπ) - cos(0)] - (1/n^2)[cos(nπ) - cos(0)] }\n\naₙ = (1/π) * { (2/n^2)[1 - cos(nπ)] }\n\naₙ = (2/πn^2)[1 - (-1)^n]\n\nNow, we have the Fourier coefficients a₀ and aₙ. The Fourier series of the function f(x) = |x| in the interval (-π, π) is:\n\nf(x) = (π/2) + Σ[ (2/πn^2)[1 - (-1)^n]cos(nx) ]"
