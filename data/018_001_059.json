    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set is a subset of A ∩ B, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element of A ∩ B.\n\nThe empty set, denoted by ∅, is a set that contains no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that we need to check for membership in A ∩ B.\n\nBy definition, a set C is a subset of another set D (written as C ⊆ D) if every element of C is also an element of D. Since there are no elements in the empty set to check, it is vacuously true that every element of the empty set is an element of A ∩ B.\n\nThus, the empty set is a subset of A ∩ B, or ∅ ⊆ A ∩ B."
