The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest clique in that graph.",
    "message_2": "To find the clique number of the graph G, we need to identify the largest subset of vertices where every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex in the subset.\n\nLet's analyze the connections between the vertices:\n\n1. Vertex A is connected to B and C.\n2. Vertex B is connected to A and C.\n3. Vertex C is connected to A, B, D, and E.\n4. Vertex D is connected to C.\n5. Vertex E is connected to C.\n\nFrom the connections, we can identify the cliques:\n\n1. {A, B, C} is a clique since A is connected to B and C, B is connected to A and C, and C is connected to A and B.\n2. {C, D} is a clique since C is connected to D, and D is connected to C.\n3. {C, E} is a clique since C is connected to E, and E is connected to C.\n\nThe largest clique in graph G is {A, B, C}, which has 3 vertices. Therefore, the clique number of the graph G is 3."
