    "message_1": "In a basketball game, the probability of player A making a free throw is 0.85. If he attempts 10 free throws, what is the probability that he will make all 10?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of player A making all 10 free throws, we simply multiply the probability of making each individual free throw together. Since the probability of making a free throw is 0.85, the calculation is:\n\n0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85\n\nOr, more simply:\n\n0.85^10\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\n0.1968744043407226\n\nSo the probability of player A making all 10 free throws is approximately 0.1969 or 19.69%."
