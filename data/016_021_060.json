    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal curve that is formed by replacing each straight segment in the previous order with a specific pattern. The pattern consists of three segments, so the length of the curve increases by a factor of 3 with each order.\n\nTo find the length of a Sierpinski arrowhead curve of order 4, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial length) * (Growth factor)^(Order)\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit (the length of a single straight segment), the growth factor is 3, and the order is 4.\n\nLength = 1 * 3^4\nLength = 1 * 81\nLength = 81 units\n\nSo, the length of a Sierpinski arrowhead curve of order 4 with a single straight segment length of 1 unit is 81 units."
