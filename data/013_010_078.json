    "message_1": "One precise numerical problem for a math student to solve on Cournot competition is as follows:\n\nTwo firms, A and B, operate in a market with a demand function given by Q = 160 - P, where Q is the market quantity demanded and P is the market price. The firms produce identical products at a constant marginal cost of $20/unit. Assuming that each firm believes that the other will produce 50 units, how much output should each firm produce to maximize their profits in a Cournot duopoly?\n\nPlease note that this is just one example of a question that can be formulated on Cournot competition. There are many other possibilities depending on the specific context and level of difficulty desired.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the reaction functions for both firms A and B. The reaction function shows the optimal output for each firm, given the output of the other firm. \n\nLet qA and qB be the output of firms A and B, respectively. The total market quantity demanded, Q, is the sum of the outputs of both firms: Q = qA + qB. We can rewrite the demand function in terms of qA and qB:\n\nQ = 160 - P\nqA + qB = 160 - P\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse demand function, which gives the market price as a function of the total quantity demanded:\n\nP = 160 - (qA + qB)\n\nThe revenue for each firm is the product of the market price and the quantity produced:\n\nRevenue_A = P * qA = (160 - (qA + qB)) * qA\nRevenue_B = P * qB = (160 - (qA + qB)) * qB\n\nThe cost for each firm is the product of the marginal cost and the quantity produced:\n\nCost_A = 20 * qA\nCost_B = 20 * qB\n\nNow, we can calculate the profit for each firm by subtracting the cost from the revenue:\n\nProfit_A = Revenue_A - Cost_A = (160 - (qA + qB)) * qA - 20 * qA\nProfit_B = Revenue_B - Cost_B = (160 - (qA + qB)) * qB - 20 * qB\n\nTo find the optimal output for each firm, we need to maximize their profits with respect to their own output. We do this by taking the first derivative of the profit function with respect to the firm's output and setting it equal to zero:\n\nd(Profit_A)/dqA = 0\nd(Profit_B)/dqB = 0\n\nTaking the derivatives and setting them equal to zero, we get:\n\n140 - 2qA - qB = 0 (1)\n140 - qA - 2qB = 0 (2)\n\nNow, we can solve this system of linear equations. From equation (1), we can express qB in terms of qA:\n\nqB = 140 - 2qA\n\nSubstitute this expression for qB into equation (2):\n\n140 - qA - 2(140 - 2qA) = 0\n\nSolving for qA, we get:\n\nqA = 40\n\nNow, substitute qA back into the expression for qB:\n\nqB = 140 - 2(40) = 60\n\nSo, the optimal output for firm A is 40 units, and the optimal output for firm B is 60 units. This is the Cournot equilibrium for this duopoly."
