    "message_2": "To find all possible subgroups of G, we will first find the divisors of the order of G, which is 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. For each divisor, we will find a subgroup of G with that order.\n\n1. Subgroup of order 1: {e}\n   The identity element e is the generator of this subgroup, and it is cyclic.\n\n2. Subgroup of order 2: {e, g^6}\n   The element g^6 has order 2 since (g^6)^2 = g^12 = e. Therefore, the subgroup generated by g^6 is {e, g^6}, and it is cyclic.\n\n3. Subgroup of order 3: {e, g^4, g^8}\n   The element g^4 has order 3 since (g^4)^3 = g^12 = e. Therefore, the subgroup generated by g^4 is {e, g^4, g^8}, and it is cyclic.\n\n4. Subgroup of order 4: {e, g^3, g^6, g^9}\n   The element g^3 has order 4 since (g^3)^4 = g^12 = e. Therefore, the subgroup generated by g^3 is {e, g^3, g^6, g^9}, and it is cyclic.\n\n5. Subgroup of order 6: {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8, g^10}\n   The element g^2 has order 6 since (g^2)^6 = g^12 = e. Therefore, the subgroup generated by g^2 is {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8, g^10}, and it is cyclic.\n\n6. Subgroup of order 12: {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6, g^7, g^8, g^9, g^10, g^11}\n   This is the entire group G, and it is cyclic with generator g.\n\nIn summary, the subgroups of G are:\n1. {e}\n2. {e, g^6}\n3. {e, g^4, g^8}\n4. {e, g^3, g^6, g^9}\n5. {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8, g^10}\n6. {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6, g^7, g^8, g^9, g^10, g^11}\n\nAll of these subgroups are cyclic with generators e, g^6, g^4, g^3, g^2, and g, respectively."
