    "message_2": "The minimum number of crossings required to form the trefoil knot is 3. The trefoil knot is the simplest nontrivial knot and has a crossing number of 3.\n\nFor the second part of the question, the maximum number of crossings required to form a non-alternating knot with 9 crossings in a closed loop is not well-defined. Non-alternating knots can have various complexities and can be formed with different numbers of crossings. However, it is known that there exists a non-alternating knot with 9 crossings, which is the 9_46 knot in the knot table."
