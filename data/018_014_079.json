    "message_2": "To determine whether the Cartesian product of the complement of A and B is equal to the complement of the Cartesian product of A and B, we need to first find the complements of A and B, and then find the Cartesian products.\n\nLet U be the universal set. We are not given the universal set, so we cannot find the exact complements of A and B. However, we can still reason about the problem in general terms.\n\nLet A' be the complement of A in U, and B' be the complement of B in U. Then, the Cartesian product of the complement of A and B is A' x B, and the complement of the Cartesian product of A and B is (A x B)'.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element (x, y) in A' x B. This means that x is in A' (i.e., x is not in A) and y is in B. Since x is not in A, the pair (x, y) cannot be in A x B. Therefore, (x, y) must be in the complement of A x B, which is (A x B)'.\n\nConversely, let's consider an arbitrary element (x, y) in (A x B)'. This means that (x, y) is not in A x B. If (x, y) is not in A x B, then either x is not in A or y is not in B (or both). Since y is in B, it must be the case that x is not in A. Therefore, x is in A' and (x, y) is in A' x B.\n\nWe have shown that any element in A' x B is also in (A x B)', and any element in (A x B)' is also in A' x B. Therefore, the Cartesian product of the complement of A and B is equal to the complement of the Cartesian product of A and B, which can be written as A' x B = (A x B)'."
