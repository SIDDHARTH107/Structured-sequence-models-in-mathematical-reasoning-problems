    "message_1": "A certain type of traffic accident occurs on a particular road with a probability of 0.2. If 500 cars travel on the road each day, what is the probability that at least one of the cars will be involved in this type of accident?",
    "message_2": "Let's find the probability that none of the cars will be involved in the accident, and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability that at least one car will be involved in the accident.\n\nThe probability that a single car will not be involved in the accident is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nSince there are 500 cars, the probability that none of them will be involved in the accident is (0.8)^500.\n\nNow, let's find the probability that at least one car will be involved in the accident:\n\nP(at least one accident) = 1 - P(no accidents)\nP(at least one accident) = 1 - (0.8)^500\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nP(at least one accident) ≈ 1 - 1.12535 × 10^(-22)\nP(at least one accident) ≈ 0.9999999999999999999887\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the cars will be involved in this type of accident is approximately 0.9999999999999999999887, or almost certain."
