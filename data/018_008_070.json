    "message_2": "The Cartesian product A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. Similarly, the Cartesian product B x A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is an element of B and a is an element of A.\n\nLet's find A x B:\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow let's find B x A:\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the elements of A x B and B x A are not the same. In A x B, the first element of each ordered pair comes from set A, while in B x A, the first element of each ordered pair comes from set B. Therefore, A x B â‰  B x A, and the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
