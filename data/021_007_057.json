    "message_2": "To apply the Newton-Raphson method, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. The function is f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1. \n\nThe derivative f'(x) is:\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 3\n\nNow, we will use the Newton-Raphson formula to find the root of the equation f(x) = 0:\n\nx_(n+1) = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nWe are given x0 = 2. Let's start iterating:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\nx1 = 2 - (2^3 - 3*2 + 1) / (3*2^2 - 3)\nx1 = 2 - (8 - 6 + 1) / (12 - 3)\nx1 = 2 - 3 / 9\nx1 = 2 - 1/3\nx1 = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667\n\nNow, let's find x2:\n\nx2 = x1 - f(x1) / f'(x1)\nx2 = 5/3 - ((5/3)^3 - 3*(5/3) + 1) / (3*(5/3)^2 - 3)\nx2 ≈ 1.6667 - (6.4815/27 - 5 + 1) / (8.3333 - 3)\nx2 ≈ 1.6667 - (-0.2404) / 5.3333\nx2 ≈ 1.6667 + 0.0451\nx2 ≈ 1.7118\n\nNow, let's find x3:\n\nx3 = x2 - f(x2) / f'(x2)\nx3 ≈ 1.7118 - (1.7118^3 - 3*1.7118 + 1) / (3*1.7118^2 - 3)\nx3 ≈ 1.7118 - (5.0177 - 5.1354 + 1) / (8.7823 - 3)\nx3 ≈ 1.7118 - 0.8823 / 5.7823\nx3 ≈ 1.7118 - 0.1525\nx3 ≈ 1.5593\n\nWe can continue this process until the difference between two consecutive iterations is less than 0.0001 (to get the answer correct to 4 decimal places). However, after comparing x2 and x3, we can see that the difference is already less than 0.0001:\n\n|1.7118 - 1.5593| = 0.1525 < 0.0001\n\nSo, we can stop here and conclude that the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1 = 0, using the Newton-Raphson method starting with x0 = 2, is approximately x ≈ 1.5593, correct to 4 decimal places."
