    "message_1": "A company is considering whether to invest in a new project that has a potential return of $200,000 with probability 0.6, and a potential return of $0 with probability 0.4. The company also has the option to conduct additional research at a cost of $50,000. If the research is conducted, the probability of a successful outcome (with $200,000 return) increases to 0.8, and the probability of a failed outcome (with $0 return) decreases to 0.2. Should the company conduct the additional research?",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the company should conduct the additional research, we need to compare the expected returns of the project with and without the research.\n\nWithout research:\nExpected return = (probability of success * return of success) + (probability of failure * return of failure)\nExpected return = (0.6 * $200,000) + (0.4 * $0)\nExpected return = $120,000\n\nWith research:\nExpected return (with research cost) = (probability of success * return of success) + (probability of failure * return of failure) - research cost\nExpected return (with research cost) = (0.8 * $200,000) + (0.2 * $0) - $50,000\nExpected return (with research cost) = $160,000 - $50,000\nExpected return (with research cost) = $110,000\n\nComparing the expected returns:\nWithout research: $120,000\nWith research: $110,000\n\nSince the expected return without research ($120,000) is higher than the expected return with research ($110,000), the company should not conduct the additional research."
