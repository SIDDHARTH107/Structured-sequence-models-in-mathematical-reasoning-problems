    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complement probability. The complement of the event \"a strong earthquake occurs within the next 10 years\" is \"no strong earthquake occurs within the next 10 years.\" \n\nLet P(A) be the probability of a strong earthquake occurring within the next 10 years, and P(A') be the probability of no strong earthquake occurring within the next 10 years. We know that P(A) + P(A') = 1.\n\nThe probability of no strong earthquake occurring in any given year is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97. Since the events in each year are assumed to be independent, the probability of no strong earthquake occurring in 10 consecutive years is:\n\nP(A') = (0.97)^10 ≈ 0.7374\n\nNow we can find the probability of a strong earthquake occurring within the next 10 years:\n\nP(A) = 1 - P(A') = 1 - 0.7374 ≈ 0.2626\n\nSo the probability of a strong earthquake with a magnitude of 7 or higher occurring in California within the next 10 years is approximately 26.26%."
