    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using a Caesar cipher with a key of 7, you would shift each letter in the message 7 positions forward in the alphabet. If a letter goes past \"Z\", it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.\n\nHere's the encryption process for each letter in \"HELLO\":\n\nH -> O (shift 7 positions forward)\nE -> L (shift 7 positions forward)\nL -> S (shift 7 positions forward)\nL -> S (shift 7 positions forward)\nO -> V (shift 7 positions forward)\n\nSo, the encrypted message would be \"OLSSV\"."
