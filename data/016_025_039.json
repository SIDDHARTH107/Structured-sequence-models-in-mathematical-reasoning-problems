    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that is formed by repeatedly removing triangles from an initial equilateral triangle. In each stage, the remaining triangles are divided into four smaller equilateral triangles, and the central triangle is removed.\n\nThe number of small triangles in the nth stage of the Sierpinski sieve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = 3^(n-1)\n\nSo, for the 6th stage:\n\nNumber of triangles = 3^(6-1) = 3^5 = 243\n\nThere are 243 small triangles in the 6th stage of constructing the Sierpinski sieve."
