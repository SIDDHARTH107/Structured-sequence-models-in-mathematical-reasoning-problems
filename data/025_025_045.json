    "message_1": "Consider the noncommutative polynomial ring $R=k\\langle x,y \\rangle/(xy-yx-1)$ where $k$ is a field. Let $I = (x,y^2)$ be an ideal in $R$. Find the dimension of the algebraic set $\\text{V}(I)$ in $\\mathbb{A}^2_k$.",
    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the algebraic set V(I) in A^2_k, we first need to find a basis for the quotient ring R/I. \n\nRecall that R = k⟨x,y⟩/(xy-yx-1). The ideal I is generated by x and y^2, so we have R/I = k⟨x,y⟩/(xy-yx-1, x, y^2).\n\nNow, we want to find a basis for R/I. Since x and y^2 are in the ideal I, we know that x ≡ 0 and y^2 ≡ 0 in R/I. Thus, we can rewrite the relation xy - yx - 1 ≡ 0 as yx ≡ 1 in R/I. \n\nA basis for R/I can be given by {1, y}. To see this, note that any element in R/I can be written as a linear combination of elements of the form y^i, where i is a non-negative integer. Since y^2 ≡ 0, we have that y^i ≡ 0 for all i ≥ 2. Thus, any element in R/I can be written as a linear combination of 1 and y.\n\nNow, we have that dim_k(R/I) = 2, since the basis {1, y} has two elements. The dimension of the algebraic set V(I) in A^2_k is equal to the Krull dimension of R/I. In this case, the Krull dimension of R/I is equal to the dimension of the vector space R/I over k, which is 2.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the algebraic set V(I) in A^2_k is 2."
