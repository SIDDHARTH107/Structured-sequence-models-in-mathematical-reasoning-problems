    "message_1": "Suppose we start with an equilateral triangle with sides of length 3 cm. At each step of the construction of the Sierpinski pyramid, we remove the middle third of each triangle to form four smaller triangles with sides of length 1 cm. How many triangles are formed after three iterations of this process?",
    "message_2": "At each iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid construction, the number of triangles increases by a factor of 4. Let's see how many triangles are formed after each iteration:\n\n1. After the first iteration, we have 4 triangles (3 smaller triangles around the removed middle triangle and 1 larger triangle formed by the 3 smaller triangles).\n2. After the second iteration, each of the 4 triangles from the previous iteration will be replaced by 4 smaller triangles, resulting in 4 * 4 = 16 triangles.\n3. After the third iteration, each of the 16 triangles from the previous iteration will be replaced by 4 smaller triangles, resulting in 16 * 4 = 64 triangles.\n\nSo, after three iterations of the Sierpinski pyramid construction, there are 64 triangles formed."
