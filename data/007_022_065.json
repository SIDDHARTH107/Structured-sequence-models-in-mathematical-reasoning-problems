    "message_2": "To find the order of the group of points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 5 over the field F_7, we need to count the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity.\n\nWe can do this by iterating through all possible x and y values in the field F_7 and checking if they satisfy the equation of the elliptic curve. If they do, we count them as a point on the curve.\n\nHere's a table of all the points on the curve:\n\nx | y\n------\n0 | 1\n0 | 6\n1 | 2\n1 | 5\n2 | 0\n3 | 2\n3 | 5\n4 | 1\n4 | 6\n5 | 3\n5 | 4\n6 | 1\n6 | 6\n\nThere are 13 points in the table, and we need to add the point at infinity, so the order of the group of points on the elliptic curve is 13 + 1 = 14."
