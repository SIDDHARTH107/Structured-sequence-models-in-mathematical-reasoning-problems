    "message_2": "Let C be a genus 2 curve, and let P be a point of order 5 on C. We want to find the value of the Riemann-Roch constant for this curve. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor D on C, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles only at the points of D, K is the canonical divisor, deg(D) is the degree of D, and g is the genus of the curve.\n\nIn our case, we have a point P of order 5, so we consider the divisor D = 5P. The degree of D is deg(5P) = 5. Since the genus of the curve is 2, we have:\n\nl(5P) - l(K - 5P) = 5 + 1 - 2 = 4.\n\nNow, we need to find l(5P) and l(K - 5P). Since P has order 5, the divisor 5P is equivalent to the zero divisor, so l(5P) = 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n1 - l(K - 5P) = 4.\n\nSolving for l(K - 5P), we get:\n\nl(K - 5P) = -3.\n\nHowever, l(K - 5P) must be a non-negative integer, so there is a contradiction. This means that the given problem is not well-posed, and there is no Riemann-Roch constant for a genus 2 curve with a point of order 5."
