Then, use mathematical induction to prove that the expression is equivalent to n^2.",
    "message_2": "To prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2, we will use mathematical induction.\n\nFirst, let's write an expression for the sum of the first n odd numbers. The nth odd number can be represented as 2n - 1. So, the sum of the first n odd numbers can be written as:\n\nS(n) = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1)\n\nNow, we will use mathematical induction to prove that S(n) = n^2 for any natural number n.\n\nBase case (n = 1):\nS(1) = 1, which is equal to 1^2. So, the statement holds true for n = 1.\n\nInductive step:\nAssume that the statement is true for n = k, i.e., S(k) = k^2.\nNow, we need to prove that the statement is true for n = k + 1, i.e., S(k + 1) = (k + 1)^2.\n\nS(k + 1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1)\nS(k + 1) = S(k) + 2(k + 1) - 1\n\nUsing the inductive hypothesis, we can substitute S(k) with k^2:\n\nS(k + 1) = k^2 + 2(k + 1) - 1\nS(k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 2 - 1\nS(k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1\n\nNow, we can see that S(k + 1) is equal to (k + 1)^2:\n\nS(k + 1) = (k + 1)^2\n\nThus, by mathematical induction, we have proven that the sum of the first n odd numbers is equal to n^2 for any natural number n."
