    "message_2": "To determine the number of different orderings of the axioms, we can use the concept of permutations. A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. In this case, we have 5 axioms (A, B, C, D, and E) and we want to find the number of ways to arrange them.\n\nThe number of permutations of a set of n objects is given by the formula n! (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nFor our set of 5 axioms, the number of permutations is:\n\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nSo there are 120 different orderings of the axioms that can be used in the proof of theorem T."
