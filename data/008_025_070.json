    "message_2": "To determine whether this system of linear equations has a solution or not, we can first check if the equations are multiples of each other.\n\nDivide the second equation by 2:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}(6x-4y) &= \\frac{1}{2}(14) \\\\\n3x-2y &= 7 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can see that the two equations are the same:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n3x-2y&=7 \\\\\n3x-2y&=7 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince both equations are the same, they represent the same line. Therefore, this system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line is a solution."
