    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation y'' + 4y = 0 with initial conditions y(0) = 3 and y'(0) = 2, we first find the general solution of the homogeneous equation.\n\nThe characteristic equation for this differential equation is:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = ±2i\n\nSince we have complex roots, the general solution of the homogeneous equation is:\n\ny(t) = C1 * cos(2t) + C2 * sin(2t)\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions to find the constants C1 and C2.\n\n1. y(0) = 3:\n\n3 = C1 * cos(0) + C2 * sin(0)\n3 = C1\nC1 = 3\n\n2. y'(0) = 2:\n\ny'(t) = -2 * C1 * sin(2t) + 2 * C2 * cos(2t)\n\n2 = -2 * 3 * sin(0) + 2 * C2 * cos(0)\n2 = 2 * C2\nC2 = 1\n\nSo, the particular solution satisfying the initial conditions is:\n\ny(t) = 3 * cos(2t) + sin(2t)\n\nThis is a periodic function with a period of π, as it is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions with the same frequency."
