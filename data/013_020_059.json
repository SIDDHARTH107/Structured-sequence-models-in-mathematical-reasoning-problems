The winner will be the player whose number is closest to, but not over, one-third of the average of all numbers submitted. What number should you submit to maximize the chance of winning?",
    "message_2": "In a Beauty Contest Game, players try to predict what others will submit and choose their own numbers accordingly. Let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1. If all players submit a number between 0 and 100 randomly, the average of all numbers would be around 50. One-third of this average would be around 16.67.\n\n2. However, players know that the winning number should be close to one-third of the average, so they might submit numbers around 16.67. If all players submit numbers around 16.67, the average would be around 16.67, and one-third of this average would be around 5.56.\n\n3. Following the same logic, players might submit numbers around 5.56, making the average around 5.56, and one-third of this average would be around 1.85.\n\n4. This process can be repeated, but as the numbers get smaller, the difference between iterations becomes less significant. It's important to note that this game involves predicting other players' behavior, so there isn't a single \"correct\" answer.\n\nHowever, to maximize your chance of winning, you should submit a number slightly below the expected one-third of the average based on your prediction of other players' submissions. In this case, submitting a number slightly below 5.56 (e.g., 5 or 5.5) might be a reasonable choice, as it takes into account the iterative thinking process of the players. Keep in mind that this is just one possible strategy, and the actual winning number will depend on the specific numbers submitted by all players."
