    "message_2": "To find the residue of f(z) at z = 1/2, we first need to express f(z) in its Laurent series expansion around z = 1/2. Since f(z) has a zero of order 2 at z = 0 and a pole of order 3 at z = 1/2, we can write f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = (z - 0)^2 * g(z) / (z - 1/2)^3\n\nwhere g(z) is a holomorphic function on D with g(1/2) ≠ 0.\n\nNow, let's find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) around z = 1/2. We can write:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 * g(z)) / ((z - 1/2)^3)\n\nLet h(z) = z^2 * g(z). Then h(z) is holomorphic on D, and h(1/2) ≠ 0. We can expand h(z) in its Taylor series around z = 1/2:\n\nh(z) = h(1/2) + h'(1/2) * (z - 1/2) + h''(1/2) * (z - 1/2)^2 / 2! + ...\n\nNow, we can write f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = h(z) / (z - 1/2)^3\n\nExpanding this expression using the Taylor series of h(z), we get the Laurent series of f(z):\n\nf(z) = (h(1/2) / (z - 1/2)^3) + (h'(1/2) / (z - 1/2)^2) + (h''(1/2) / 2! * (z - 1/2)) + ...\n\nThe residue of f(z) at z = 1/2 is the coefficient of the (z - 1/2)^{-1} term in the Laurent series expansion. In this case, the residue is:\n\nRes(f(z), 1/2) = h''(1/2) / 2!\n\nTo find h''(1/2), we need to compute the second derivative of h(z) = z^2 * g(z):\n\nh'(z) = 2z * g(z) + z^2 * g'(z)\nh''(z) = 2 * g(z) + 4z * g'(z) + z^2 * g''(z)\n\nNow, we can find h''(1/2):\n\nh''(1/2) = 2 * g(1/2) + 4(1/2) * g'(1/2) + (1/2)^2 * g''(1/2)\n\nFinally, we can compute the residue:\n\nRes(f(z), 1/2) = h''(1/2) / 2! = (2 * g(1/2) + 4(1/2) * g'(1/2) + (1/2)^2 * g''(1/2)) / 2"
