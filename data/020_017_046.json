    "message_2": "To find the minima and maxima of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 2x, we first need to find its critical points. We do this by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 2x\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 8x + 2\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n4x^3 - 8x + 2 = 0\n\nThis equation is a cubic equation, which can be difficult to solve analytically. However, we can try to find the real roots by factoring or using numerical methods. In this case, we can notice that x = 1 is a root of the equation:\n\n4(1)^3 - 8(1) + 2 = 0\n\nNow, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(4x^3 - 8x + 2) / (x - 1) = 4x^2 + 4x - 2\n\nNow, we have the factored form of the derivative:\n\nf'(x) = (x - 1)(4x^2 + 4x - 2)\n\nWe already know that x = 1 is a critical point. To find the other critical points, we need to solve the quadratic equation 4x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 4, b = 4, and c = -2:\n\nx = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4(4)(-2))) / (2(4))\nx = (-4 ± √(48)) / 8\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1, x = (-4 + √48) / 8, and x = (-4 - √48) / 8.\n\nNow, we need to determine if these critical points are minima or maxima. We can do this by analyzing the second derivative of the function:\n\nf''(x) = 12x^2 - 8\n\nWe can now evaluate the second derivative at each critical point:\n\nf''(1) = 12(1)^2 - 8 = 4 > 0, so x = 1 is a local minimum.\nf''((-4 + √48) / 8) < 0, so x = (-4 + √48) / 8 is a local maximum.\nf''((-4 - √48) / 8) < 0, so x = (-4 - √48) / 8 is a local maximum.\n\nSince the function is continuous and the domain is closed, we also need to check the endpoints of the domain, x = -2 and x = 2:\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^4 - 4(-2)^2 + 2(-2) = 16 - 16 - 4 = -4\nf(2) = (2)^4 - 4(2)^2 + 2(2) = 16 - 16 + 4 = 4\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical points and endpoints, we find:\n\nf(1) = 1 - 4 + 2 = -1\nf((-4 + √48) / 8) ≈ -4.1213\nf((-4 - √48) / 8) ≈ 1.1213\n\nSo, the minima of the function are at x = 1 with a value of -1 and at x = -2 with a value of -4. The maxima of the function are at x = (-4 + √48) / 8 with a value of approximately -4.1213 and at x = (-4 - √48) / 8 with a value of approximately 1.1213."
