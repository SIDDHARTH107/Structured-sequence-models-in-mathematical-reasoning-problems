    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a self-similar fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor (dilation factor).\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, there are N = 2 self-similar pieces, and the given dilation factor is s = 2.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nD = log(2) / log(2)\n\nD = 1\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve when the dilation factor is equal to 2 is 1."
