    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. In a complete graph K_n, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nAccording to Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G is either its maximum degree Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1. For a complete graph K_n, the maximum degree Δ(K_n) is n - 1, since each vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nIn the case of K_7, the maximum degree Δ(K_7) is 7 - 1 = 6. However, since K_7 has an odd number of vertices, its chromatic index is Δ(K_7) + 1. Therefore, the chromatic index of K_7 is 6 + 1 = 7."
