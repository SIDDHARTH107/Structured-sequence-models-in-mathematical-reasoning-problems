    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using separation of variables, we first separate the variables x and y:\n\ndy/dx = 3x^2\n\ndy = 3x^2 dx\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables:\n\n∫dy = ∫3x^2 dx\n\ny = x^3 + C\n\nThis is the general solution of the differential equation.\n\nNow, we need to find the particular solution using the initial condition y(0) = 2. Plug in x = 0 and y = 2 into the general solution:\n\n2 = (0)^3 + C\n\n2 = C\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\ny = x^3 + 2"
