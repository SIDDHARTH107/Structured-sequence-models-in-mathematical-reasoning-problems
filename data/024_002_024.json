    "message_2": "To find the geodesic curve on the surface z = x^2 + y^2 that joins the points (1,0,1) and (-1,0,1) with minimum length, we will use the calculus of variations and the Euler-Lagrange equation.\n\nFirst, let's parameterize the curve on the surface by a parameter t:\n\nx(t), y(t), z(t) = x(t), y(t), x(t)^2 + y(t)^2\n\nNow, we need to find the length functional of the curve. The length L of a curve is given by the integral:\n\nL = ∫√(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 dt\n\nSince z = x^2 + y^2, we have dz/dt = 2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt). Substituting this into the length functional, we get:\n\nL = ∫√(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt))^2 dt\n\nTo minimize L, we will use the Euler-Lagrange equation. Let's define the Lagrangian L as:\n\nL = √(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt))^2\n\nNow, we will apply the Euler-Lagrange equation for x(t) and y(t):\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dx/dt)) - ∂L/∂x = 0\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dy/dt)) - ∂L/∂y = 0\n\nComputing the partial derivatives and solving the Euler-Lagrange equations is quite involved. However, we can simplify the problem by noting that the surface z = x^2 + y^2 is rotationally symmetric about the z-axis. Therefore, the geodesic curve must lie in a plane that contains the z-axis.\n\nLet's assume that the geodesic curve lies in the xz-plane, which means y(t) = 0 for all t. This simplifies the length functional to:\n\nL = ∫√(dx/dt)^2 + (2x(dx/dt))^2 dt\n\nNow, we can apply the Euler-Lagrange equation for x(t) only:\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dx/dt)) - ∂L/∂x = 0\n\nSolving this equation, we find that the geodesic curve in the xz-plane is a straight line segment connecting the points (1,0,1) and (-1,0,1). The equation of this line is:\n\nx(t) = 1 - 2t\nz(t) = 1\n\nwhere t ∈ [0, 1].\n\nThus, the geodesic curve on the surface z = x^2 + y^2 that joins the points (1,0,1) and (-1,0,1) with minimum length is the straight line segment given by:\n\nx(t) = 1 - 2t\ny(t) = 0\nz(t) = 1\n\nfor t ∈ [0, 1]."
