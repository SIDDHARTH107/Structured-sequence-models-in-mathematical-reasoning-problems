    "message_2": "To find the analytical solution of the wave equation for a vibrating string fixed at both ends, we can use the method of separation of variables and Fourier series. The wave equation is given by:\n\n∂²u/∂t² = c² ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the displacement of the string at position x and time t, and c is the wave speed.\n\nSince the string is fixed at both ends, we have the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0\n\nThe initial conditions are given by:\n\nu(x,0) = f(x) = 2x(1-x)\n∂u/∂t(x,0) = 0\n\nWe assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation and dividing by u(x,t), we get:\n\n1/c² (T''/T) = X''/X\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². We now have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX'' + λ²X = 0\nT'' + c²λ²T = 0\n\nThe general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nX(0) = A = 0\nX(1) = B*sin(λ) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be zero (trivial solution), sin(λ) must be zero. Therefore, λ = nπ, where n is a positive integer. The solution for X(x) becomes:\n\nX_n(x) = B_n*sin(nπx)\n\nNow, we find the solution for T(t):\n\nT'' + c²(nπ)²T = 0\n\nThis is a simple harmonic oscillator equation, and its general solution is:\n\nT_n(t) = C_n*cos(c*nπ*t) + D_n*sin(c*nπ*t)\n\nSince the initial velocity is zero, ∂u/∂t(x,0) = 0, which implies D_n = 0. Thus, the solution for T(t) is:\n\nT_n(t) = C_n*cos(c*nπ*t)\n\nThe overall solution is a sum of the product of X_n(x) and T_n(t):\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [C_n*sin(nπx)*cos(c*nπ*t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients C_n, we use the initial condition u(x,0) = f(x):\n\nf(x) = 2x(1-x) = Σ [C_n*sin(nπx)]\n\nWe can find C_n using the orthogonality property of sine functions and the Fourier sine series:\n\nC_n = 2∫[0,1] f(x)*sin(nπx) dx\n\nC_n = 2∫[0,1] 2x(1-x)*sin(nπx) dx\n\nIntegrating by parts twice, we get:\n\nC_n = 4*(-1)^n/(nπ)^3\n\nFinally, the analytical solution for the vibrating string is:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [((-1)^n/(nπ)^3) * sin(nπx) * cos(c*nπ*t)]"
