    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (trips happening) in n trials (planned trips)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (trip happening) = 1 - probability of cancellation = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9\n- n is the number of trials (planned trips) = 20\n- k is the number of successes (trips happening)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 15 trips will happen, which means we need to find the probability for 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 successful trips and add them together.\n\nP(X ≥ 15) = P(X = 15) + P(X = 16) + P(X = 17) + P(X = 18) + P(X = 19) + P(X = 20)\n\nWe can calculate each probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 15) = C(20, 15) * 0.9^15 * 0.1^5\nP(X = 16) = C(20, 16) * 0.9^16 * 0.1^4\nP(X = 17) = C(20, 17) * 0.9^17 * 0.1^3\nP(X = 18) = C(20, 18) * 0.9^18 * 0.1^2\nP(X = 19) = C(20, 19) * 0.9^19 * 0.1^1\nP(X = 20) = C(20, 20) * 0.9^20 * 0.1^0\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 15) ≈ 0.0319\nP(X = 16) ≈ 0.0574\nP(X = 17) ≈ 0.0573\nP(X = 18) ≈ 0.0383\nP(X = 19) ≈ 0.0139\nP(X = 20) ≈ 0.0021\n\nFinally, we add the probabilities together:\n\nP(X ≥ 15) ≈ 0.0319 + 0.0574 + 0.0573 + 0.0383 + 0.0139 + 0.0021 ≈ 0.2009\n\nSo, the probability that at least 15 trips will happen is approximately 20.09%."
