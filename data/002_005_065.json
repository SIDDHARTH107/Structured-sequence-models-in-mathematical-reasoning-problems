    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem:\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nwhere d is the diagonal, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height of the rectangular prism.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: l = 5cm, w = 4cm, and h = 3cm.\n\nd = √((5cm)² + (4cm)² + (3cm)²)\nd = √(25cm² + 16cm² + 9cm²)\nd = √(50cm²)\n\nThe length of the diagonal is:\nd = √(50cm²) ≈ 7.07cm"
