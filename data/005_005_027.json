    "message_1": "A factory produces light bulbs with an average lifetime of 800 hours and a standard deviation of 50 hours. What is the probability that a randomly selected light bulb will last between 700 and 900 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-scores for 700 and 900 hours:\n\nz1 = (700 - 800) / 50 = -100 / 50 = -2\nz2 = (900 - 800) / 50 = 100 / 50 = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores using the standard normal distribution table. The table gives the probability that a value is less than the given z-score:\n\nP(z1) = P(Z < -2) ≈ 0.0228\nP(z2) = P(Z < 2) ≈ 0.9772\n\nTo find the probability that a light bulb will last between 700 and 900 hours, we need to find the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(700 < X < 900) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected light bulb will last between 700 and 900 hours is approximately 0.9544 or 95.44%."
