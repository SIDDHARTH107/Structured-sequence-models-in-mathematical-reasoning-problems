    "message_2": "A Nash equilibrium is a situation in which no player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the strategies of the other players. In this game, we can represent the payoffs in a 2x2 matrix:\n\n```\n          Player 2\n          C     D\n        +-----+-----+\n  P  C | 3,3 | 0,5 |\n  l     +-----+-----+\n  a  D | 5,0 | 1,1 |\n  y     +-----+-----+\n  e\n  r\n  1\n```\n\nLet's analyze the possible strategies for each player:\n\n1. If Player 1 cooperates (C) and Player 2 also cooperates (C), both players get a payoff of 3. However, if Player 2 decides to defect (D), their payoff increases to 5. So, Player 2 has an incentive to change their strategy from C to D.\n\n2. If Player 1 cooperates (C) and Player 2 defects (D), Player 1 gets a payoff of 0. If Player 1 decides to defect (D) as well, their payoff increases to 1. So, Player 1 has an incentive to change their strategy from C to D.\n\n3. If Player 1 defects (D) and Player 2 also defects (D), both players get a payoff of 1. If either player decides to cooperate (C), their payoff decreases to 0. So, neither player has an incentive to change their strategy from D to C.\n\n4. If Player 1 defects (D) and Player 2 cooperates (C), Player 2 gets a payoff of 0. If Player 2 decides to defect (D) as well, their payoff increases to 1. So, Player 2 has an incentive to change their strategy from C to D.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that the only situation in which neither player has an incentive to change their strategy is when both players defect (D). Therefore, the Nash equilibrium of this game is (D, D) with payoffs (1, 1)."
