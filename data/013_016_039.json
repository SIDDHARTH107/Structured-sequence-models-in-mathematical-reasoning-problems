    "message_1": "Here is a specific problem related to moral hazard in game theory:\n\nSuppose two players, A and B, are considering entering into a business partnership. There are two possible states of the world: success and failure. If the venture is successful, the players will earn a total profit of $100, which they will split equally. If the venture fails, they will each lose $20, so their net payoff will be $-20.\n\nBoth players can exert effort in making the venture successful, but the level of effort is unobservable. Player A is more productive and can exert high effort with a cost of $20, while player B can only exert low effort at a cost of $10. Assume that player A can observe his own effort level but cannot observe player B's effort level.\n\nIf player A exerts high effort, the probability of success is 0.8, while if he exerts low effort, the probability of success is 0.4. Player B's effort level does not affect the probability of success.\n\nAssuming both players are risk-neutral, what is the optimal level of effort for player A, and what is his expected payoff?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal level of effort for player A, we need to compare the expected payoffs for both high effort and low effort.\n\n1. High effort:\nProbability of success = 0.8\nPayoff if successful = (100/2) - 20 (cost of high effort) = 50 - 20 = $30\nPayoff if failed = -20 (loss) - 20 (cost of high effort) = -$40\nExpected payoff for high effort = (0.8 * 30) + (0.2 * -40) = 24 - 8 = $16\n\n2. Low effort:\nProbability of success = 0.4\nPayoff if successful = (100/2) - 0 (cost of low effort) = $50\nPayoff if failed = -$20 (loss) - 0 (cost of low effort) = -$20\nExpected payoff for low effort = (0.4 * 50) + (0.6 * -20) = 20 - 12 = $8\n\nSince the expected payoff for high effort ($16) is greater than the expected payoff for low effort ($8), the optimal level of effort for player A is high effort.\n\nPlayer A's expected payoff is $16."
