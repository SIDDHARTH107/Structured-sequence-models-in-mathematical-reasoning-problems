    "message_1": "A trapezium has a base of 6 cm, a top length of 10 cm, and a height of 4 cm. Find its perimeter.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. We can do this by using the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles. Let's call the shorter base \"a\" (6 cm), the longer base \"b\" (10 cm), the height \"h\" (4 cm), and the two unknown side lengths \"x\" and \"y\".\n\nSince the trapezium is symmetrical, we can divide it into two right triangles by drawing a line from the top vertex to the bottom base. The length of this line will be the height (h = 4 cm). The base of the left triangle will be half the difference between the longer and shorter bases, which is (b - a) / 2 = (10 - 6) / 2 = 2 cm. The base of the right triangle will be the same length.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the other two sides (x and y). In the left triangle:\n\nx^2 = h^2 + ((b - a) / 2)^2\nx^2 = 4^2 + 2^2\nx^2 = 16 + 4\nx^2 = 20\nx = √20\n\nSince the trapezium is symmetrical, the length of the other side (y) will be the same as x:\n\ny = √20\n\nNow we can find the perimeter by adding all the side lengths:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + x + y\nPerimeter = 6 + 10 + √20 + √20\nPerimeter = 16 + 2√20\n\nSo, the perimeter of the trapezium is 16 + 2√20 cm."
