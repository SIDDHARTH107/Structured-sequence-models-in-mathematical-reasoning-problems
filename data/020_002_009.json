    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the quadratic function f(x) = 5x^2 - 7x + 3, we first need to find the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula x = -b/(2a), where a and b are the coefficients of the x^2 and x terms, respectively.\n\nIn this case, a = 5 and b = -7, so:\n\nx = -(-7) / (2 * 5)\nx = 7 / 10\nx = 0.7\n\nNow, we need to find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate back into the function:\n\nf(0.7) = 5(0.7)^2 - 7(0.7) + 3\nf(0.7) = 5(0.49) - 4.9 + 3\nf(0.7) = 2.45 - 4.9 + 3\nf(0.7) = -0.45\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is at the point (0.7, -0.45). Since the parabola opens upwards (because the coefficient of the x^2 term, 5, is positive), the vertex represents the minimum value of the function.\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the given range, x = -1 and x = 2, to see if the minimum value occurs within the range:\n\nf(-1) = 5(-1)^2 - 7(-1) + 3\nf(-1) = 5 + 7 + 3\nf(-1) = 15\n\nf(2) = 5(2)^2 - 7(2) + 3\nf(2) = 20 - 14 + 3\nf(2) = 9\n\nSince the value of the function at the vertex (x = 0.7) is lower than the values at the endpoints of the range, the minimum value of f(x) for x in the range [-1, 2] is -0.45."
