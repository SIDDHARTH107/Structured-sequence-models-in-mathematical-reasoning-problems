    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex, and no two edges share a vertex. In other words, a perfect matching pairs up all the vertices in the graph.\n\nFor a graph to have a perfect matching, it must have an even number of vertices. In this case, we have 6 vertices, which is even, so it's possible to have a perfect matching.\n\nTo find the maximum number of perfect matchings, we need to consider how the 7 edges are distributed among the 6 vertices. Since there are 6 vertices, there are a total of (6 choose 2) = 15 possible edges. However, we only have 7 edges, so not all possible edges are present in the graph.\n\nLet's consider the best-case scenario, where the 7 edges are distributed in such a way that they maximize the number of perfect matchings. In this case, we can imagine the graph as two disjoint sets of 3 vertices each, with all possible edges within each set, and one additional edge connecting the two sets. This configuration would look like this:\n\n```\nSet 1: A -- B -- C\n       |___|___|\n\nSet 2: D -- E -- F\n       |___|___|\n```\n\nIn this configuration, we have the following perfect matchings:\n\n1. A-B, C-D, E-F\n2. A-C, B-D, E-F\n3. A-B, C-E, D-F\n4. A-C, B-E, D-F\n\nSo, the maximum number of perfect matchings possible in a graph with 6 vertices and 7 edges is 4."
