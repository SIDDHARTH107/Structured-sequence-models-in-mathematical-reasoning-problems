    "message_2": "When you apply the 2D Fourier Transform to a digital image of size MxN (in this case, 512x512 pixels), you obtain a frequency spectrum of the same size, MxN. Each element in the frequency spectrum represents a distinct frequency component. Therefore, for a 512x512 image, there are:\n\n512 x 512 = 262,144 distinct frequency components in the frequency spectrum."
