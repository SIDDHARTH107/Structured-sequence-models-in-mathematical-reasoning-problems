    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid is a fractal structure that is created by repeatedly applying a simple rule to an equilateral triangle. In each iteration, every filled triangle is replaced by three smaller filled triangles, forming a larger equilateral triangle. The number of filled triangles increases by a factor of 3 with each iteration.\n\nAfter the first iteration, there are 729 filled sub-triangles.\n\nTo find the total number of filled triangles after 5 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal filled triangles = Initial filled triangles * (3^(number of iterations - 1))\n\nTotal filled triangles = 729 * (3^(5-1))\nTotal filled triangles = 729 * (3^4)\nTotal filled triangles = 729 * 81\nTotal filled triangles = 59049\n\nSo, after 5 iterations, there are 59,049 filled triangles in the Sierpinski pyramid."
