    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x - 4, we first need to find the second derivative of the function.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx(2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x - 4)\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx(6x^2 - 18x + 12)\nf''(x) = 12x - 18\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to find the values of x for which f''(x) = 0:\n12x - 18 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n12x = 18\nx = 18/12\nx = 3/2\n\nSo, there is one inflection point at x = 3/2. To find the corresponding y-coordinate, plug this value of x back into the original function f(x):\n\nf(3/2) = 2(3/2)^3 - 9(3/2)^2 + 12(3/2) - 4\nf(3/2) = 2(27/8) - 9(9/4) + 18 - 4\nf(3/2) = 27/4 - 81/4 + 14\nf(3/2) = (-54 + 56)/4\nf(3/2) = 2/4\nf(3/2) = 1/2\n\nSo, the inflection point is at (3/2, 1/2)."
