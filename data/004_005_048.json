    "message_2": "To find the particular solution to the given first-order linear differential equation y' + 3y = 6, we first find the integrating factor and then the general solution. Finally, we use the initial condition y(0) = 2 to find the particular solution.\n\n1. Find the integrating factor:\nThe integrating factor is given by the exponential of the integral of the coefficient of y, which is 3 in this case.\n\nIntegrating factor = e^(∫3 dx) = e^(3x)\n\n2. Multiply the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(3x)(y' + 3y) = 6e^(3x)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(e^(3x)y)' = 6e^(3x)\n\n3. Integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(e^(3x)y)' dx = ∫6e^(3x) dx\n\nUsing integration by substitution, let u = 3x, then du = 3 dx:\n\n∫(e^(3x)y) dx = (1/3)∫e^u du\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\ne^(3x)y = (1/3)e^(3x) + C\n\n4. Solve for y:\n\ny = (1/3) + Ce^(-3x)\n\n5. Use the initial condition y(0) = 2:\n\n2 = (1/3) + Ce^(-3*0)\n\n2 = (1/3) + C\n\nC = 5/3\n\n6. Write the particular solution:\n\ny(x) = (1/3) + (5/3)e^(-3x)"
