    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using Fourier series, we first assume that the solution can be represented as a Fourier sine series, since the boundary conditions are homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. Thus, we assume that the solution has the form:\n\n$u(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n \\sin(nx)$\n\nNow, we substitute this assumed solution into the given differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\lambda u = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (-n^2 b_n \\sin(nx)) + \\lambda \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n \\sin(nx) = 0$\n\nSince this equation must hold for all $x \\in [0, \\pi]$, the coefficients of the sine functions must satisfy:\n\n$-n^2 b_n + \\lambda b_n = 0$\n\nThis equation has non-trivial solutions for $b_n$ if and only if:\n\n$\\lambda = n^2$\n\nThus, the eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$ are given by:\n\n$\\lambda_n = n^2$, for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are:\n\n$u_n(x) = \\sin(nx)$\n\nSo, the general solution of the boundary value problem is a linear combination of these eigenfunctions:\n\n$u(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n \\sin(nx)$\n\nwhere the coefficients $b_n$ depend on the specific problem or initial conditions."
