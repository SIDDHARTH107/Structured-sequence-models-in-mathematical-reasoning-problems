    "message_1": "In a community of 500 people, 40% are women and 60% are men. If you randomly select 4 people from the community, what is the probability that at least 2 of them are men?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 2 of the 4 randomly selected people are men, we can calculate the probabilities of the complementary events (0 or 1 man) and subtract them from 1.\n\nThere are a total of 500 people in the community, with 200 women (40%) and 300 men (60%). We can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (4 people selected), k is the number of successful trials (number of men), p is the probability of success (0.6), q is the probability of failure (0.4), and nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\n1. Probability of selecting 0 men (4 women):\nP(X = 0) = (4C0) * (0.6^0) * (0.4^4) = 1 * 1 * 0.0256 = 0.0256\n\n2. Probability of selecting 1 man (3 women):\nP(X = 1) = (4C1) * (0.6^1) * (0.4^3) = 4 * 0.6 * 0.064 = 0.1536\n\nNow, we can find the probability of selecting at least 2 men by subtracting the probabilities of the complementary events from 1:\n\nP(at least 2 men) = 1 - P(0 men) - P(1 man) = 1 - 0.0256 - 0.1536 = 0.8208\n\nSo, the probability of selecting at least 2 men from the 4 randomly chosen people is approximately 82.08%."
