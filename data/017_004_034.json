Then G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n\nIn our case, p = 5, so G must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nTo determine which case it is, we can use the fact that the number of elements of order p in a group of order p^2 is p^2 - p.\n\nIn our case, the number of elements of order 5 in G is 25 - 5 = 20. Since there are 20 elements of order 5, there must be at least one element of order 25 (the generator of the cyclic group). Let's call this element a.\n\nNow, G = ⟨a⟩, and |G| = |⟨a⟩| = 25. So, G is a cyclic group generated by the element a.\n\nIn conclusion, G is a cyclic group of order 25, and its generator is the element a."
