    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using the sparse matrix method, we first represent the given system as a matrix equation AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z, w), and B is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | -2  3 -1  4 |\n    |  1  1  1  2 |\n    |  2  6 -3 -7 |\n    | -3  4  2 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n    | w |\n\nB = |  6  |\n    |  8  |\n    | -17 |\n    | -3  |\n\nNow we will use Gaussian elimination to transform the matrix A into an upper triangular matrix U, and apply the same row operations to matrix B.\n\n1. Swap row 1 and row 2:\nU = |  1  1  1  2 |\n    | -2  3 -1  4 |\n    |  2  6 -3 -7 |\n    | -3  4  2 -5 |\n\nB = |  8  |\n    |  6  |\n    | -17 |\n    | -3  |\n\n2. Add 2 * row 1 to row 2, and subtract 2 * row 1 from row 3, and add 3 * row 1 to row 4:\nU = |  1  1  1  2  |\n    |  0  5  1  8  |\n    |  0  4 -5 -11 |\n    |  0  7  5  1  |\n\nB = |  8  |\n    |  2  |\n    | -33 |\n    |  21 |\n\n3. Divide row 2 by 5:\nU = |  1  1   1   2  |\n    |  0  1  1/5  8/5 |\n    |  0  4  -5 -11  |\n    |  0  7   5   1   |\n\nB = |  8  |\n    |  2/5|\n    | -33 |\n    |  21 |\n\n4. Subtract 4 * row 2 from row 3, and subtract 7 * row 2 from row 4:\nU = |  1  1    1    2   |\n    |  0  1   1/5  8/5  |\n    |  0  0 -13/5 -43/5 |\n    |  0  0  20/5 -31/5 |\n\nB = |  8   |\n    |  2/5 |\n    | -62/5|\n    | 106/5|\n\n5. Multiply row 3 by -5/13:\nU = |  1  1   1    2   |\n    |  0  1  1/5  8/5  |\n    |  0  0   1   43/13|\n    |  0  0  20/5 -31/5|\n\nB = |  8   |\n    |  2/5 |\n    | 62/13|\n    | 106/5|\n\n6. Subtract 20/5 * row 3 from row 4:\nU = |  1  1   1    2    |\n    |  0  1  1/5  8/5   |\n    |  0  0   1   43/13 |\n    |  0  0   0  -23/13 |\n\nB = |  8   |\n    |  2/5 |\n    | 62/13|\n    |-18/13|\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix U, and we can use back substitution to find the values of x, y, z, and w.\n\nw = (-18/13) / (-23/13) = 18/23\nz = (62/13 - 43/13 * w) = 1\ny = (2/5 - 8/5 * w - 1/5 * z) = 2\nx = (8 - 2 * w - z - 2 * y) = 3\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3, y = 2, z = 1, and w = 18/23."
