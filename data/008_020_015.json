    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix of the system.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into a triangular matrix (row-echelon form).\n3. Perform back-substitution to find the values of the variables.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix of the system.\n\nThe augmented matrix is:\n\n|  2  3  4 |  7  |\n|  1 -2  3 | -1  |\n|  3  1  1 | 8.5 |\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into a triangular matrix (row-echelon form).\n\nFirst, we want to get a 1 in the top-left corner. We can do this by swapping Row 1 and Row 2:\n\n|  1 -2  3 | -1  |\n|  2  3  4 |  7  |\n|  3  1  1 | 8.5 |\n\nNext, we want to get zeros below the 1 in the top-left corner. We can do this by replacing Row 2 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 2 and replacing Row 3 with (-3 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n\n|  1 -2  3 | -1  |\n|  0  7 -2 |  9  |\n|  0  7 -8 | 11  |\n\nNow, we want to get a 1 in the second row and second column. We can do this by dividing Row 2 by 7:\n\n|  1 -2  3 | -1  |\n|  0  1 -2/7 |  9/7  |\n|  0  7 -8 | 11  |\n\nNext, we want to get zeros below the 1 in the second row and second column. We can do this by replacing Row 3 with (-7 * Row 2) + Row 3:\n\n|  1 -2  3  | -1    |\n|  0  1 -2/7 |  9/7  |\n|  0  0 -46/7| 20/7  |\n\nFinally, we want to get a 1 in the third row and third column. We can do this by multiplying Row 3 by -7/46:\n\n|  1 -2  3  | -1    |\n|  0  1 -2/7 |  9/7  |\n|  0  0  1   | -10/23|\n\nStep 3: Perform back-substitution to find the values of the variables.\n\nNow that we have the matrix in row-echelon form, we can perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = -10/23\n\ny = (9/7) + (2/7) * (-10/23) = 13/23\n\nx = -1 - 3 * (-10/23) + 2 * (13/23) = 16/23\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 16/23\ny = 13/23\nz = -10/23"
