    "message_1": "Suppose a principal hires an agent to perform a task that will either result in a gain of $100,000 or $50,000, depending on whether the agent chooses a risky or safe approach. The principal believes that the agent is risk-averse and will choose the safe approach. However, the agent has some information that the principal does not have and knows that the risky approach has a 80% chance of succeeding compared to a 60% chance for the safe approach. The agent's payoffs will be either $20,000 or $15,000, depending on the outcome. Determine the optimal strategy for the agent and the expected utility of the principal.",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal strategy for the agent, we need to calculate the expected utility for both the risky and safe approaches. \n\nFor the risky approach:\nThe agent has an 80% chance of success, which means they will receive $20,000 with a probability of 0.8, and a 20% chance of failure, which means they will receive $15,000 with a probability of 0.2.\n\nExpected utility of risky approach = (0.8 * $20,000) + (0.2 * $15,000) = $16,000 + $3,000 = $19,000\n\nFor the safe approach:\nThe agent has a 60% chance of success, which means they will receive $20,000 with a probability of 0.6, and a 40% chance of failure, which means they will receive $15,000 with a probability of 0.4.\n\nExpected utility of safe approach = (0.6 * $20,000) + (0.4 * $15,000) = $12,000 + $6,000 = $18,000\n\nSince the expected utility of the risky approach ($19,000) is higher than the expected utility of the safe approach ($18,000), the optimal strategy for the agent is to choose the risky approach.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected utility for the principal.\n\nFor the risky approach:\nThe principal has an 80% chance of gaining $100,000 and a 20% chance of gaining $50,000.\n\nExpected utility of risky approach = (0.8 * $100,000) + (0.2 * $50,000) = $80,000 + $10,000 = $90,000\n\nFor the safe approach:\nThe principal has a 60% chance of gaining $100,000 and a 40% chance of gaining $50,000.\n\nExpected utility of safe approach = (0.6 * $100,000) + (0.4 * $50,000) = $60,000 + $20,000 = $80,000\n\nSince the agent will choose the risky approach, the expected utility for the principal is $90,000."
