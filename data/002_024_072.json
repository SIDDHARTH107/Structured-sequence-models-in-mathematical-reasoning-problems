    "message_1": "A trapezium has two parallel sides measuring 8 cm and 12 cm, respectively. The distance between these two parallel sides is 6 cm. Calculate the perimeter of the trapezium.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the two non-parallel sides a and b.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of a and b. Since the trapezium is not a rectangle, we can divide it into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the vertices of the shorter parallel side to the longer parallel side.\n\nLet's call the length of this perpendicular line h. Now, we have two right triangles. One with legs of length h and (12 - 8)/2 = 2 cm, and the other with legs of length h and 6 - h cm.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for the first right triangle:\n\na^2 = h^2 + 2^2\na^2 = h^2 + 4\n\nFor the second right triangle:\n\nb^2 = (6 - h)^2 + 2^2\nb^2 = (36 - 12h + h^2) + 4\nb^2 = h^2 - 12h + 40\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the distance between the parallel sides is 6 cm:\n\nh + (6 - h) = 6\nh = 6 - (6 - h)\nh = 3\n\nNow, we can find the lengths of a and b:\n\na^2 = 3^2 + 4\na^2 = 9 + 4\na^2 = 13\na = √13\n\nb^2 = 3^2 - 12(3) + 40\nb^2 = 9 - 36 + 40\nb^2 = 13\nb = √13\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter of the trapezium:\n\nPerimeter = 8 + 12 + √13 + √13\nPerimeter = 20 + 2√13 cm"
