    "message_2": "To perform elliptic curve multiplication, we will repeatedly apply the point addition operation. The point addition operation for elliptic curves is defined as follows:\n\n1. If P = O (the point at infinity), then P + Q = Q.\n2. If Q = O, then P + Q = P.\n3. If P = -Q (i.e., P and Q are inverses), then P + Q = O.\n4. If P = Q, then the slope of the tangent line at P is used to find the resulting point.\n5. If P ≠ Q, then the slope of the line connecting P and Q is used to find the resulting point.\n\nGiven the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 (mod 23) and the point P = (3, 4), we want to find 7P.\n\nFirst, let's find 2P. Since P = Q, we will use the tangent line at P. The slope of the tangent line is given by the derivative of the curve:\n\ns = (3 * x^2 + 5) / (2 * y) (mod 23)\n\nPlugging in the values for P:\n\ns = (3 * 3^2 + 5) / (2 * 4) (mod 23)\ns = (27 + 5) / 8 (mod 23)\ns = 32 / 8 (mod 23)\ns = 4 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we can find the resulting point R = P + Q:\n\nx_R = s^2 - x_P - x_Q (mod 23)\ny_R = s(x_P - x_R) - y_P (mod 23)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nx_R = 4^2 - 3 - 3 (mod 23)\nx_R = 16 - 6 (mod 23)\nx_R = 10 (mod 23)\n\ny_R = 4(3 - 10) - 4 (mod 23)\ny_R = -28 - 4 (mod 23)\ny_R = -32 (mod 23)\ny_R = 14 (mod 23)\n\nSo, 2P = (10, 14).\n\nNow, let's find 4P = 2(2P). We will use the same process as before:\n\ns = (3 * 10^2 + 5) / (2 * 14) (mod 23)\ns = (300 + 5) / 28 (mod 23)\ns = 305 / 28 (mod 23)\ns = 13 (mod 23)\n\nx_R = 13^2 - 10 - 10 (mod 23)\nx_R = 169 - 20 (mod 23)\nx_R = 149 (mod 23)\nx_R = 6 (mod 23)\n\ny_R = 13(10 - 6) - 14 (mod 23)\ny_R = 52 - 14 (mod 23)\ny_R = 38 (mod 23)\ny_R = 15 (mod 23)\n\nSo, 4P = (6, 15).\n\nFinally, let's find 7P = 4P + 3P. Since 3P = 2P + P, we can find 7P = 4P + 2P + P:\n\nFirst, let's find 6P = 4P + 2P:\n\ns = (15 - 14) / (6 - 10) (mod 23)\ns = 1 / (-4) (mod 23)\ns = 1 * 6 (mod 23) (since -4 * 6 ≡ 1 (mod 23))\ns = 6 (mod 23)\n\nx_R = 6^2 - 6 - 10 (mod 23)\nx_R = 36 - 16 (mod 23)\nx_R = 20 (mod 23)\n\ny_R = 6(6 - 20) - 15 (mod 23)\ny_R = -84 - 15 (mod 23)\ny_R = -99 (mod 23)\ny_R = 4 (mod 23)\n\nSo, 6P = (20, 4).\n\nNow, let's find 7P = 6P + P:\n\ns = (4 - 4) / (20 - 3) (mod 23)\ns = 0 / 17 (mod 23)\ns = 0 (mod 23)\n\nx_R = 0^2 - 20 - 3 (mod 23)\nx_R = -23 (mod 23)\nx_R = 0 (mod 23)\n\ny_R = 0(20 - 0) - 4 (mod 23)\ny_R = -4 (mod 23)\ny_R = 19 (mod 23)\n\nSo, 7P = (0, 19).\n\nTherefore, the result of the elliptic curve multiplication of the point (3, 4) with the scalar 7 on the given elliptic curve is (0, 19)."
