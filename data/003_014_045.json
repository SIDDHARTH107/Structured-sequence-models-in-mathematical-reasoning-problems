    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the function f(x) = 2sin(3x). Then, we will use this information to graph the function and find the x and y-intercepts, maximum and minimum points, and at least one full period.\n\n1. Amplitude: The amplitude of a sine function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine term. In this case, the amplitude is |2| = 2.\n\n2. Period: The period of a sine function is found by dividing 2π by the absolute value of the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, the period is 2π / |3| = 2π/3.\n\n3. Phase Shift: Since there is no horizontal shift in the function f(x) = 2sin(3x), the phase shift is 0.\n\nNow, let's graph the function and find the required points:\n\n1. x-intercepts: To find the x-intercepts, we set f(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n2sin(3x) = 0\nsin(3x) = 0\n3x = nπ, where n is an integer\nx = nπ/3\n\n2. y-intercepts: To find the y-intercepts, we set x = 0 and solve for f(x):\nf(0) = 2sin(3*0) = 2sin(0) = 0\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 0).\n\n3. Maximum and minimum points: The maximum and minimum points occur when the sine function reaches its maximum and minimum values, which are 1 and -1, respectively. Since the amplitude is 2, the maximum and minimum values of f(x) are 2 and -2.\n\nFor maximum points, we have:\n2sin(3x) = 2\nsin(3x) = 1\n3x = (2n + 1)π/2, where n is an integer\nx = (2n + 1)π/6\n\nFor minimum points, we have:\n2sin(3x) = -2\nsin(3x) = -1\n3x = (4n + 3)π/2, where n is an integer\nx = (4n + 3)π/6\n\nNow, let's graph the function for at least one full period. Since the period is 2π/3, we will graph the function from x = 0 to x = 2π/3. The graph will have the following key points:\n\n- x-intercepts: (0, 0), (π/3, 0), and (2π/3, 0)\n- y-intercept: (0, 0)\n- Maximum point: (π/6, 2)\n- Minimum point: (π/2, -2)\n\nIn summary, the function f(x) = 2sin(3x) has an amplitude of 2, a period of 2π/3, and a phase shift of 0. The graph includes x-intercepts at x = nπ/3, a y-intercept at (0, 0), maximum points at x = (2n + 1)π/6 with a value of 2, and minimum points at x = (4n + 3)π/6 with a value of -2."
