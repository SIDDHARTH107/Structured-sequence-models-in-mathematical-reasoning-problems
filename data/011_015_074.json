    "message_1": "A group of 6 people meet and shake hands with each other. What is the minimum number of handshakes that must take place so that either 3 of them shake hands with each other or 3 of them do not shake hands with each other?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of handshakes needed, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. We will divide the 6 people into 2 groups of 3 people each. Let's call these groups A and B.\n\nNow, let's consider the first person (Person 1). They can shake hands with a maximum of 5 other people. If Person 1 shakes hands with at least 3 people from either group A or group B, then we have 3 people who have shaken hands with each other (Person 1 and the 3 people from the group).\n\nIf Person 1 shakes hands with 2 people from group A and 2 people from group B, then there must be a group of 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other. This is because if there were 3 people who had shaken hands with each other in this scenario, Person 1 would have had to shake hands with at least 3 people from one of the groups, which contradicts our assumption.\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, Person 1 shakes hands with 2 people from group A and 2 people from group B. Now, let's consider the second person (Person 2). If Person 2 shakes hands with someone from the group that Person 1 did not shake hands with, then we have 3 people who have shaken hands with each other (Person 1, Person 2, and the person from the group). If Person 2 shakes hands with someone from the group that Person 1 shook hands with, then we have 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other (Person 1, Person 2, and the person from the group).\n\nThus, the minimum number of handshakes needed is when Person 1 shakes hands with 4 people (2 from each group) and Person 2 shakes hands with 1 person from one of the groups. In this case, there are a total of 4 + 1 = 5 handshakes."
