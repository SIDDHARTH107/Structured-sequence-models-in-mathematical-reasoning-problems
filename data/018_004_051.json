    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to know the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of set A, denoted by A', consists of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. Since the problem does not specify the universal set, we will assume that the universal set U is the set of all integers from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNow, we can find the complement of set A with respect to the universal set U. The complement of set A, A', consists of all elements in U that are not in A. \n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the complement of set A is unique using set theory. To do this, we will show that if there is another set B' that is also a complement of set A, then B' must be equal to A'.\n\nLet B' be another complement of set A, i.e., B' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}. Since both A' and B' are complements of set A, they both contain all elements in U that are not in A. Therefore, for any element x, x ∈ A' if and only if x ∈ B'. This means that A' and B' have the same elements, and thus A' = B'.\n\nIn conclusion, the complement of set A is unique, and in this case, it is A' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}."
