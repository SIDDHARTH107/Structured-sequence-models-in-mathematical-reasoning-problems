Use the Schwarz reflection principle to find the expression for $f(z)$ in $E=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}:z\\neq0\\text{ and }|z|>1\\}$.\n\nHint: Use the symmetry of $D$ with respect to the real axis and the fact that the reflection of $f$ across the real axis, $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$, is holomorphic in the mirror image of $D$ across the real line, which is a copy of $E$.",
    "message_2": "To find the expression for $f(z)$ in $E$, we first need to find the reflection of $f$ across the real axis. This is given by $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$, as mentioned in the hint. Let's compute this reflection:\n\n$$\\overline{f(\\bar{z})} = \\overline{\\frac{1}{1-\\bar{z}}}.$$\n\nNow, let's find a function $g(z)$ that is holomorphic in $E$ and coincides with $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ on the boundary of $D$, i.e., when $|z|=1$. To do this, we can use the fact that the reflection of $D$ across the real axis is a copy of $E$. \n\nLet $w = \\frac{1}{z}$, so $z = \\frac{1}{w}$. Then, we have:\n\n$$\\overline{f(\\bar{z})} = \\overline{\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{\\bar{w}}}} = \\overline{\\frac{\\bar{w}}{\\bar{w}-1}}.$$\n\nNow, we can define $g(w) = \\frac{w}{w-1}$, which is holomorphic in $E$. We can see that $g(w)$ coincides with $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ on the boundary of $D$:\n\n$$g(w) = \\frac{w}{w-1} = \\overline{\\frac{\\bar{w}}{\\bar{w}-1}} = \\overline{f(\\bar{z})}.$$\n\nThus, the expression for $f(z)$ in $E$ is given by $g(w)$, where $w = \\frac{1}{z}$. So, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = g\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{z}}{\\frac{1}{z}-1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{z}-1}.$$"
