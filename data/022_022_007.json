    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform F(k) of the function f(x) = e^(-x^2/2), we will use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nIn this case, f(x) = e^(-x^2/2), so we have:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-x^2/2) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, with the integral taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-x^2/2 - 2πikx)] dx, with the integral taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nTo solve this integral, we will complete the square in the exponent:\n\n-x^2/2 - 2πikx = -(x^2 + 4πikx)/2\n\nNow, we add and subtract (4πk)^2/4 inside the exponent to complete the square:\n\n-(x^2 + 4πikx + (4πk)^2/4 - (4πk)^2/4)/2 = -((x + 2πik)^2 - (4πk)^2)/2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nF(k) = e^(-(4πk)^2/4) * ∫[e^(-((x + 2πik)^2)/2)] dx, with the integral taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nNow, we make the substitution u = x + 2πik, so du = dx:\n\nF(k) = e^(-(4πk)^2/4) * ∫[e^(-u^2/2)] du, with the integral taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nThis integral is a Gaussian integral, which has a known value:\n\n∫[e^(-u^2/2)] du = √(2π), with the integral taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nF(k) = e^(-(4πk)^2/4) * √(2π)\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform F(k) of the function f(x) = e^(-x^2/2) is:\n\nF(k) = √(2π) * e^(-(4πk)^2/4)"
