    "message_1": "In a Trust Game, Player 1 is given $50 and must decide how much to give to Player 2. Whatever amount Player 1 gives will be tripled, and Player 2 will then decide how much (if any) to give back to Player 1. If Player 2 decides to give back $30, how much did Player 1 originally give to Player 2?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount Player 1 originally gave to Player 2. When this amount is tripled, it becomes 3x. Since Player 2 gives back $30 to Player 1, we can set up the following equation:\n\n3x - 30 = x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n3x - x = 30\n2x = 30\nx = 15\n\nSo, Player 1 originally gave $15 to Player 2."
