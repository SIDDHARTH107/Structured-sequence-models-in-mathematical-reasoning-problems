    "message_2": "To find the probability of no accidents in the next 5 working days, we need to find the probability of no accidents occurring on each individual day and then multiply those probabilities together.\n\nThe probability of no accident occurring in a day is 1 - 0.06 = 0.94.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the probability of no accidents occurring for each of the 5 working days:\n\n0.94 * 0.94 * 0.94 * 0.94 * 0.94 = 0.94^5 â‰ˆ 0.7339\n\nSo, the probability that there will be no accidents in the next 5 working days is approximately 0.7339 or 73.39%."
