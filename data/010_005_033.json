    "message_2": "Yes, there exists a path connecting $(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$ contained entirely in $A$. \n\nConsider the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$ for $1 \\leq x \\leq 2$. This function satisfies the condition $1 \\leq xy \\leq 2$ for all points $(x, y)$ on the curve $y = f(x)$. \n\nAt $x = 1$, we have $y = f(1) = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$, so the point $(1,1)$ is on the curve. Similarly, at $x = 2$, we have $y = f(2) = \\frac{1}{2}$, so the point $(2, \\frac{1}{2})$ is on the curve. \n\nNow, consider the function $g(x) = 2x - 1$ for $\\frac{1}{2} \\leq x \\leq 2$. This function satisfies the condition $1 \\leq xy \\leq 2$ for all points $(x, y)$ on the curve $y = g(x)$. \n\nAt $x = \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $y = g(\\frac{1}{2}) = 2(\\frac{1}{2}) - 1 = 0$, so the point $(\\frac{1}{2}, 0)$ is on the curve. Similarly, at $x = 2$, we have $y = g(2) = 2(2) - 1 = 3$, so the point $(2, 3)$ is on the curve. \n\nNow, we can construct a path connecting $(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$ as follows:\n\n1. Start at the point $(1,1)$ on the curve $y = f(x)$.\n2. Move along the curve $y = f(x)$ from $(1,1)$ to $(2, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n3. Move vertically from $(2, \\frac{1}{2})$ to $(2, 2)$.\n\nThis path is contained entirely in $A$, as it only moves along the curves $y = f(x)$ and $y = g(x)$, which both satisfy the condition $1 \\leq xy \\leq 2$."
