    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3^1. Thus, we need to consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor the Sylow 2-subgroups, there are three possibilities: a cyclic group of order 16, a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 and 2, or a direct product of four cyclic groups of order 2.\n\nFor the Sylow 3-subgroups, there is only one possibility: a cyclic group of order 3.\n\nNow, we can combine these possibilities to form different groups:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 48: C_48\n2. Direct product of C_16 and C_3: C_16 × C_3\n3. Direct product of C_4 × C_2 and C_3: (C_4 × C_2) × C_3\n4. Direct product of C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 and C_3: (C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2) × C_3\n\nThere are 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 48.\n\nOut of these 4 groups, the first one (C_48) is abelian, and the second one (C_16 × C_3) is also abelian since the direct product of two abelian groups is abelian. The other two groups, (C_4 × C_2) × C_3 and (C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2) × C_3, are non-abelian.\n\nSo, there are 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 48, and 2 of them are non-abelian."
