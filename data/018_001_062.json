    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set is a subset of set A, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element in set A. The empty set, denoted as ∅, contains no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A. \n\nBy definition, a subset B of a set A is a set such that every element of B is also an element of A. Since there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A, the empty set is a subset of set A.\n\nFormally, we can write it as:\n\n∅ ⊆ A, since ∀x (x ∈ ∅ → x ∈ A)\n\nThis statement holds true for any set A, including the given set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}."
