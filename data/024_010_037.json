    "message_2": "To find the Levi-Civita connection of the given metric, we first need to compute the Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols are given by the following formula:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})$$\n\nHere, $g^{kl}$ is the inverse of the metric tensor $g_{kl}$, and $\\partial_i$ denotes the partial derivative with respect to the $i$-th coordinate. For the given metric, we have:\n\n$$g_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 9 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe inverse of this matrix is:\n\n$$g^{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1/9 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the Christoffel symbols. Since the metric is diagonal and constant, many of the partial derivatives will be zero. We have:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij}) = 0$$\n\nfor all $i, j, k$. This is because the metric components are constants, and their partial derivatives are zero.\n\nThus, the Levi-Civita connection at the point $(1,1,1)$ is given by the Christoffel symbols, which are all zero in this case."
