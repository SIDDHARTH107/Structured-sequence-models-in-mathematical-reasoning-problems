If the system is initially displaced 5 cm from its equilibrium position and released from rest, what is the equation describing the motion of the mass? Also, find the maximum displacement, velocity and acceleration of the mass during its motion.",
    "message_2": "To describe the motion of the mass in a mass-spring system, we can use the equation for simple harmonic motion:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement of the mass at time t, A is the amplitude of the motion, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nIn this case, the mass (m) is 2 kg and the spring constant (k) is 50 N/m. The initial displacement is 5 cm (0.05 m), and the mass is released from rest, so its initial velocity is 0 m/s.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency (ω). We can use the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nω = sqrt(50/2) = sqrt(25) = 5 rad/s\n\nSince the mass is released from rest at its maximum displacement, the phase angle (φ) is 0. So the equation describing the motion of the mass is:\n\nx(t) = 0.05 * cos(5t)\n\nNow, let's find the maximum displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the mass during its motion.\n\n1. Maximum displacement: This is equal to the amplitude (A) of the motion, which is 0.05 m.\n\n2. Maximum velocity: We can find this using the formula:\n\nv_max = Aω\n\nv_max = 0.05 * 5 = 0.25 m/s\n\n3. Maximum acceleration: We can find this using the formula:\n\na_max = Aω^2\n\na_max = 0.05 * (5^2) = 0.05 * 25 = 1.25 m/s²\n\nSo, the equation describing the motion of the mass is x(t) = 0.05 * cos(5t), and the maximum displacement, velocity, and acceleration are 0.05 m, 0.25 m/s, and 1.25 m/s², respectively."
