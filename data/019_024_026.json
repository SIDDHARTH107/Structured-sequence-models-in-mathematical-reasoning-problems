    "message_2": "To find out how many trucks were sold, we need to subtract the number of SUVs and sedans from the total number of cars sold.\n\nTotal cars sold = 125\nSUVs sold = 45\nSedans sold = 60\n\nTrucks sold = Total cars sold - (SUVs sold + Sedans sold)\nTrucks sold = 125 - (45 + 60)\nTrucks sold = 125 - 105\nTrucks sold = 20\n\nSo, 20 trucks were sold last month."
