    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust when the initial segment is split into four equal parts, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn this case, the initial segment is split into four equal parts, but only two parts are kept (the first and the last), so N = 2. The scaling factor s is 4 since the initial segment is divided into four equal parts.\n\nHence, the Hausdorff dimension is:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(4) = log(2) / (2 * log(2)) = 1/2\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust when the initial segment is split into four equal parts instead of three is 1/2."
