The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nSo, A Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find (A Δ B) ∩ B:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ B = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4} = {4}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B Δ A:\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB ∩ A = {2, 3}\n\nSo, B Δ A = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find (B Δ A) ∩ A:\n\n(B Δ A) ∩ A = {1, 4} ∩ {1, 2, 3} = {1}\n\nWe can see that (A Δ B) ∩ B = {4} and (B Δ A) ∩ A = {1}. Since {4} ≠ {1}, the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
