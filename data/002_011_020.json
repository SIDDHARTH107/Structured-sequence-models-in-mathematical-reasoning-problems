    "message_1": "A right triangle has legs of 5cm and 12cm. What is the length of its hypotenuse?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, a = 5cm and b = 12cm.\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is: c² = a² + b²\n\nSubstitute the given values:\nc² = (5cm)² + (12cm)²\nc² = 25cm² + 144cm²\nc² = 169cm²\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse (c):\nc = √169cm²\nc = 13cm\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse is 13cm."
