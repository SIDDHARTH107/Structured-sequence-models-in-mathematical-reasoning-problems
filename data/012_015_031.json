    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected or not, we can use the following fact:\n\nA graph with n vertices is connected if it has at least (n-1) edges and there is a path between every pair of vertices.\n\nIn our case, we have 7 vertices, so the minimum number of edges required for the graph to be connected is (7-1) = 6 edges. Since our graph has 10 edges, it is possible that the graph is connected.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that the graph is connected just because it has more than 6 edges. We need to check if there is a path between every pair of vertices. Unfortunately, we do not have enough information about the specific connections between the vertices to determine if the graph is connected or not.\n\nIf the graph is not connected, we can calculate the number of components using the formula:\n\nNumber of components = (Number of vertices) - (Number of edges in the connected subgraph)\n\nSince we do not have enough information about the specific connections between the vertices, we cannot determine the exact number of components. However, we can find the minimum and maximum number of components.\n\nThe minimum number of components occurs when the graph is connected, which means there is only 1 component.\n\nThe maximum number of components occurs when there are as many isolated vertices as possible. In this case, we can have a connected subgraph with 4 vertices and 6 edges (forming a complete graph, K4), and the remaining 3 vertices are isolated. So, the maximum number of components is 4 (1 connected subgraph and 3 isolated vertices).\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the specific connections between the vertices, we cannot determine if the graph is connected or not, and the number of components can range from 1 to 4."
