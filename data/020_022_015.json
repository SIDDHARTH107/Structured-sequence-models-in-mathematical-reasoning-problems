    "message_1": "A company produces two products, Product A and Product B. The company has 1000 hours of machine time available each week. It takes 3 hours to produce one unit of Product A and 2 hours to produce one unit of Product B. The profit for each unit of Product A is $100 and the profit for each unit of Product B is $75. What is the optimal production plan for the company to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe total machine time constraint can be represented as:\n3x + 2y ≤ 1000\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit function:\nProfit = 100x + 75y\n\nTo find the optimal production plan, we can first find the feasible region by solving the inequality for y:\ny ≤ (1000 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow, we can find the critical points by setting the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and y equal to zero:\nd(Profit)/dx = 100\nd(Profit)/dy = 75\n\nSince the derivatives are constants, there are no critical points. Therefore, the optimal solution must lie on the boundary of the feasible region. We can check the endpoints and the intersection of the constraint with the axes:\n\n1. x = 0, y = 0 (origin)\nProfit = 100(0) + 75(0) = $0\n\n2. x = 0, y = 500 (intersection with y-axis)\nProfit = 100(0) + 75(500) = $37,500\n\n3. x = 333.33, y = 0 (intersection with x-axis)\nProfit = 100(333.33) + 75(0) = $33,333\n\n4. x = 200, y = 300 (intersection of 3x + 2y = 1000)\nProfit = 100(200) + 75(300) = $42,500\n\nComparing the profits at these points, the optimal production plan is to produce 200 units of Product A and 300 units of Product B, which will result in a maximum profit of $42,500."
