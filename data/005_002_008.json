    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of people who like ice cream in the population, we will use the formula for the confidence interval of a proportion:\n\nCI = p-hat ± Z * sqrt((p-hat * (1 - p-hat)) / n)\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, p-hat is the sample proportion, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (1.96 for a 95% confidence interval), and n is the sample size.\n\nFirst, we need to find the sample proportion (p-hat):\n\np-hat = number of people who like ice cream / total number of people surveyed\np-hat = 650 / 1000\np-hat = 0.65\n\nNext, we will calculate the standard error:\n\nSE = sqrt((p-hat * (1 - p-hat)) / n)\nSE = sqrt((0.65 * (1 - 0.65)) / 1000)\nSE = sqrt((0.65 * 0.35) / 1000)\nSE = sqrt(0.2275 / 1000)\nSE = sqrt(0.0002275)\nSE ≈ 0.0151\n\nNow, we will find the margin of error using the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval (1.96):\n\nMargin of Error = Z * SE\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 0.0151\nMargin of Error ≈ 0.0296\n\nFinally, we will calculate the confidence interval:\n\nCI = p-hat ± Margin of Error\nCI = 0.65 ± 0.0296\nCI = (0.65 - 0.0296, 0.65 + 0.0296)\nCI ≈ (0.6204, 0.6796)\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of people who like ice cream in the population is approximately (0.6204, 0.6796)."
