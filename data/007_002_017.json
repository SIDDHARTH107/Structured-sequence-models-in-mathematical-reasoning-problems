    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 3682 is divided by 9, we can use the divisibility rule for 9, which states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. \n\nFirst, let's find the sum of the digits of 3682:\n\n3 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 19\n\nSince 19 is not divisible by 9, 3682 is not divisible by 9. To find the remainder, we can divide 19 by 9:\n\n19 รท 9 = 2 with a remainder of 1\n\nSo, the remainder when 3682 is divided by 9 is 1."
