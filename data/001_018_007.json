    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we can use the property of logarithms that states logₐ(a^x) = x. \n\nlog₃(27) can be rewritten as log₃(3^3) which simplifies to 3.\n\nlog₅(125) can be rewritten as log₅(5^3) which simplifies to 3.\n\nlog₂(8) can be rewritten as log₂(2^3) which simplifies to 3.\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n3 + 3 - 3\n\nAdding and subtracting the numbers, we get:\n\n3 + 3 = 6\n6 - 3 = 3\n\nSo, the simplified expression is 3."
