    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance between the points (1,1,1) and (-2,-1,3) on the surface x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 = 9, we need to find the geodesic connecting these points. A geodesic is the shortest path between two points on a surface.\n\nFirst, let's verify that both points are on the surface:\n\nFor (1,1,1):\n1^2 + 2(1)^2 + 2(1)^2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 ≠ 9\n\nFor (-2,-1,3):\n(-2)^2 + 2(-1)^2 + 2(3)^2 = 4 + 2 + 18 = 24 ≠ 9\n\nIt turns out that neither of the points (1,1,1) and (-2,-1,3) are on the surface x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 = 9. Therefore, it is not possible to find the geodesic connecting these points on the given surface."
