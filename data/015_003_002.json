    "message_2": "To find the first three values of x after the initial value x0 = 0.5, we will iterate the logistic map function f(x) = rx(1-x) with r = 3.4.\n\n1. First iteration:\nx1 = f(x0) = 3.4 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) = 3.4 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.85\n\n2. Second iteration:\nx2 = f(x1) = 3.4 * 0.85 * (1 - 0.85) = 3.4 * 0.85 * 0.15 ≈ 0.4335\n\n3. Third iteration:\nx3 = f(x2) ≈ 3.4 * 0.4335 * (1 - 0.4335) ≈ 3.4 * 0.4335 * 0.5665 ≈ 0.8344\n\nNow, we have the first three values of x after the initial value x0 = 0.5: x1 = 0.85, x2 ≈ 0.4335, and x3 ≈ 0.8344.\n\nTo plot these values on the bifurcation diagram for the logistic map, we will represent r on the horizontal axis and x on the vertical axis. Since r is constant at 3.4, we will plot vertical lines at r = 3.4 for each of the x values we found.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the bifurcation diagram with the points plotted:\n\n```\nx\n|\n|                        x\n|                        |\n|                        x\n|                        |\n|                        x\n|                        |\n+------------------------+------------------------> r\n0                        3.4                       4\n```\n\nThe three points (3.4, 0.85), (3.4, 0.4335), and (3.4, 0.8344) are plotted on the bifurcation diagram for the logistic map."
