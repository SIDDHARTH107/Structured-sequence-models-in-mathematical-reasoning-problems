    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. Recall that the Fourier transform of a function $f(x)$ is defined as:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{f(x)\\}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i k x} dx$$\n\nand the inverse Fourier transform is defined as:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{F(k)\\}(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(k) e^{2\\pi i k x} dk$$\n\nNow, let's take the Fourier transform of both sides of the given differential equation:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+4y\\right\\}(k) = \\mathcal{F}\\{0\\}(k)$$\n\nUsing the properties of the Fourier transform, we know that the Fourier transform of the second derivative of a function is:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\\right\\}(k) = (2\\pi i k)^2 \\mathcal{F}\\{y\\}(k)$$\n\nSo, our transformed equation becomes:\n\n$$(2\\pi i k)^2 \\mathcal{F}\\{y\\}(k) + 4\\mathcal{F}\\{y\\}(k) = 0$$\n\nNow, let's solve for $\\mathcal{F}\\{y\\}(k)$:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{y\\}(k) = \\frac{0}{(2\\pi i k)^2 + 4}$$\n\nSince the right-hand side of the equation is zero, the Fourier transform of $y(x)$ is also zero:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{y\\}(k) = 0$$\n\nNow, we can take the inverse Fourier transform to find the solution $y(x)$:\n\n$$y(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{0\\}(x) = 0$$\n\nHowever, this solution does not satisfy the initial conditions $y(0) = 2$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx}(0) = 0$. The given differential equation is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients, which has the general solution:\n\n$$y(x) = C_1 \\cos(2x) + C_2 \\sin(2x)$$\n\nApplying the initial conditions, we get:\n\n$$y(0) = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) = 2 \\Rightarrow C_1 = 2$$\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx}(0) = -2C_1 \\sin(0) + 2C_2 \\cos(0) = 0 \\Rightarrow C_2 = 0$$\n\nThus, the solution to the given differential equation that satisfies the initial conditions is:\n\n$$y(x) = 2\\cos(2x)$$"
