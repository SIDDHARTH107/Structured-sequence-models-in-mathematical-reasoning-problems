    "message_2": "To find the distance between the sets A and B, we need to find the minimum distance between any point in A and any point in B. Since A = {x ∈ R: -1 < x < 1} and B = {x ∈ R: 2 < x < 3}, we can see that the sets do not overlap.\n\nThe minimum distance between any point in A and any point in B will occur when we take the largest value in A and the smallest value in B. The largest value in A is x = 1 (not included in the set, but we can approach it arbitrarily closely), and the smallest value in B is x = 2 (also not included in the set, but we can approach it arbitrarily closely).\n\nUsing the Euclidean metric d(x,y) = |x - y|, the distance between these two points is:\n\nd(1, 2) = |1 - 2| = |-1| = 1\n\nTherefore, the distance between the sets A and B is 1."
