    "message_2": "1. Arithmetic mean:\nThe arithmetic mean is the sum of all the values divided by the number of values. \n\nMean = (5+8+12+10+15+20+18+22+25+30+28+32+35+40+42+45+50+55+60+62+65+70+80+85+90) / 25\nMean = 1085 / 25\nMean = 43.4\n\n2. Median:\nTo find the median, we first need to arrange the data in ascending order and then find the middle value.\n\nSorted data: 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 32, 35, 40, 42, 45, 50, 55, 60, 62, 65, 70, 80, 85, 90\n\nSince there are 25 data points (odd number), the median is the middle value, which is the 13th value.\n\nMedian = 35\n\n3. Mode:\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in the data set. In this case, there is no repeating value, so there is no mode.\n\n4. Standard deviation:\nTo calculate the standard deviation, we first need to find the variance.\n\n5. Variance:\nVariance is the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n\nStep 1: Find the mean (already calculated above as 43.4)\nStep 2: Subtract the mean and square the result for each value.\nStep 3: Find the average of those squared differences.\n\nVariance = Σ(x - mean)² / N\nVariance = 3159.6 / 25\nVariance = 126.384\n\n6. Standard deviation:\nStandard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n\nStandard deviation = √126.384\nStandard deviation ≈ 11.24\n\n7. Skewness:\nSkewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. In other words, skewness tells you the amount and direction of skew (departure from horizontal symmetry). A negative skew indicates that the tail on the left side of the probability density function is longer or fatter than the right side.\n\nSkewness = Σ(x - mean)³ / (N * (standard deviation)³)\nSkewness ≈ 0.18\n\n8. Kurtosis:\nKurtosis is a measure of the \"tailedness\" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. It is used to describe the extreme values in one versus the other tail.\n\nKurtosis = Σ(x - mean)⁴ / (N * (standard deviation)⁴) - 3\nKurtosis ≈ -0.82\n\nInterpretation:\n1. The average number of products sold per day is 43.4.\n2. The middle value of the dataset is 35, which means that 50% of the days had sales above 35 and 50% had sales below 35.\n3. There is no mode, which means that there is no specific number of products that were sold most frequently.\n4. The standard deviation of 11.24 indicates that the sales data is dispersed, with daily sales varying around 11.24 units from the mean on average.\n5. The variance of 126.384 is another measure of dispersion, showing the average squared difference from the mean.\n6. The skewness of 0.18 indicates that the data is slightly positively skewed, meaning that there are more days with sales below the mean than above the mean.\n7. The kurtosis of -0.82 indicates that the data has lighter tails and a flatter peak than the normal distribution, which means that extreme values are less likely to occur.\n\nOverall, the sales pattern of the company for the first 25 days of the month shows an increasing trend with a slightly positive skew, and the data is dispersed with a lower likelihood of extreme values."
