    "message_1": "A finance analyst observes stock market prices over a 50-day period and records the closing prices every day. The analyst then wants to determine the cyclicality in the stock prices over this period using the Fourier transform. Write a calculation for the math student to perform which will determine the frequency of the highest cyclicality in the closing prices.",
    "message_2": "Let the closing prices be represented by the sequence {p_1, p_2, ..., p_50}. To determine the frequency of the highest cyclicality in the closing prices using the Fourier transform, the math student should perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the closing prices sequence. The DFT is defined as:\n\nX(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) * e^(-j * 2π * k * n / N)\n\nwhere X(k) is the k-th element of the DFT, x(n) is the n-th element of the closing prices sequence, N is the total number of data points (50 in this case), and j is the imaginary unit (sqrt(-1)).\n\n2. Calculate the magnitude of each element in the DFT:\n\n|X(k)| = sqrt(Re(X(k))^2 + Im(X(k))^2)\n\nwhere Re(X(k)) and Im(X(k)) are the real and imaginary parts of X(k), respectively.\n\n3. Find the index k_max corresponding to the maximum magnitude in the DFT, excluding the k=0 component (which represents the average of the data):\n\nk_max = argmax_{k=1,...,N/2} |X(k)|\n\n4. Calculate the frequency of the highest cyclicality:\n\nf_max = k_max / N\n\nThe frequency f_max represents the highest cyclicality in the closing prices over the 50-day period."
