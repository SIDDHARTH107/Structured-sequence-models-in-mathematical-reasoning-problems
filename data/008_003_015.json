    "message_2": "To find the rank of the matrix A, we will perform elementary row operations to transform it into its row-echelon form.\n\nMatrix A:\n\\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 8 & 9 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nStep 1: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row, and 7 times the first row from the third row.\n\n\\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -3 & -6 \\\\ 0 & -6 & -12 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -3.\n\n\\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & -6 & -12 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nStep 3: Add 6 times the second row to the third row.\n\n\\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nNow the matrix is in row-echelon form. The rank of a matrix is the number of non-zero rows in its row-echelon form. In this case, there are 2 non-zero rows.\n\nTherefore, the rank of matrix A is 2."
