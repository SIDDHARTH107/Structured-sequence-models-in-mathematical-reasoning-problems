    "message_1": "A salesman has to visit 10 cities, but he wants to minimize his total travel distance. If he starts and ends in the same city, how many possible routes can he take?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of possible routes the salesman can take, we need to calculate the permutations of the cities he can visit. Since he starts and ends in the same city, there are 9 cities left to visit in different orders.\n\nThe number of permutations for visiting 9 cities is 9! (9 factorial), which is calculated as follows:\n\n9! = 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 362,880\n\nSo, there are 362,880 possible routes the salesman can take to visit the 10 cities, starting and ending in the same city."
