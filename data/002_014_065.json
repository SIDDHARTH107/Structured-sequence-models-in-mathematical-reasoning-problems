    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm. What is the total surface area of the prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length × width.\n\nThere are three pairs of faces on a rectangular prism:\n\n1. Two faces with dimensions 6 cm (length) × 4 cm (width)\n2. Two faces with dimensions 6 cm (length) × 5 cm (height)\n3. Two faces with dimensions 4 cm (width) × 5 cm (height)\n\nNow, we find the area of each pair of faces:\n\n1. 6 cm × 4 cm = 24 cm² (area of one face)\n   24 cm² × 2 = 48 cm² (total area of two faces)\n\n2. 6 cm × 5 cm = 30 cm² (area of one face)\n   30 cm² × 2 = 60 cm² (total area of two faces)\n\n3. 4 cm × 5 cm = 20 cm² (area of one face)\n   20 cm² × 2 = 40 cm² (total area of two faces)\n\nFinally, we add the areas of all six faces together:\n\n48 cm² + 60 cm² + 40 cm² = 148 cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 148 cm²."
