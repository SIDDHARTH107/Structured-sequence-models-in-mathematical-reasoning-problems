    "message_2": "To determine the number of different batting orders, we need to find the number of permutations of the 12 players. A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order.\n\nIn this case, there are 12 players and 12 positions in the batting order. For the first position, there are 12 choices. Once the first player is chosen, there are 11 players left for the second position. After the second player is chosen, there are 10 players left for the third"
