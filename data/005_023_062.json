    "message_2": "First, we need to find the quartiles of the dataset. Let's arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n53, 68, 70, 72, 78, 79, 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 88, 91, 95, 96\n\nQ1 (the first quartile) is the median of the lower half of the data. Since there are 15 data points, the lower half consists of the first 7 numbers:\n\n53, 68, 70, 72, 78, 79, 82\n\nThe median of this lower half is 72, so Q1 = 72.\n\nQ3 (the third quartile) is the median of the upper half of the data. The upper half consists of the last 7 numbers:\n\n84, 85, 87, 88, 91, 95, 96\n\nThe median of this upper half is 88, so Q3 = 88.\n\nNow we can find the interquartile range (IQR):\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 88 - 72 = 16\n\nNext, we'll use the 1.5 x IQR rule to find the lower and upper bounds for potential outliers:\n\nLower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 72 - 1.5 * 16 = 72 - 24 = 48\nUpper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 88 + 1.5 * 16 = 88 + 24 = 112\n\nNow we can identify any outliers by checking if any data points fall outside these bounds:\n\n53, 68, 70, 72, 78, 79, 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 88, 91, 95, 96\n\nAll of these values fall within the range of 48 to 112, so there are no outliers in this dataset."
