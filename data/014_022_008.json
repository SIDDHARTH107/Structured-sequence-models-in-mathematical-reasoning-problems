    "message_1": "Suppose a message \"HELLO WORLD\" was encrypted using the Playfair Cipher with the key \"CAT\". Without knowing the key, what is the probability of correctly guessing any one letter in the ciphertext?",
    "message_2": "The Playfair Cipher is a digraph substitution cipher, which means that it encrypts pairs of letters instead of individual letters. In this cipher, the 26 letters of the alphabet are arranged in a 5x5 grid (omitting one letter, usually 'J', which is combined with 'I'). Therefore, there are 25 possible letters in the ciphertext.\n\nSince we are trying to guess one letter in the ciphertext without knowing the key, we can assume that each letter has an equal probability of being chosen. So, the probability of correctly guessing any one letter in the ciphertext is 1 out of the 25 possible letters.\n\nThe probability of correctly guessing any one letter in the ciphertext is 1/25 or 0.04 (4%)."
