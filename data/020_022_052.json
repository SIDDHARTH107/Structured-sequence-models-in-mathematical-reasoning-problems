    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B. The production of each product requires the following amount of resources: 1 hour of labor, 2 pounds of material, and 3 units of equipment. The company has 45 hours of labor, 60 pounds of material, and 90 units of equipment available each week. The profit per unit of A is $20 and for B is $30. The company wants to maximize its weekly profit. How many units of each product should the company produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The company's constraints can be represented by the following inequalities:\n\n1x + 1y ≤ 45 (labor constraint)\n2x + 2y ≤ 60 (material constraint)\n3x + 3y ≤ 90 (equipment constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the constraints:\n\nx + y ≤ 45\nx + y ≤ 30\nx + y ≤ 30\n\nSince the material and equipment constraints are the same, we can focus on the labor constraint and the material/equipment constraint:\n\nx + y ≤ 45\nx + y ≤ 30\n\nNow, we can find the corner points of the feasible region by solving the system of equations:\n\n1) x + y = 45\n2) x + y = 30\n\nFrom equation (2), we have y = 30 - x. Substituting this into equation (1), we get:\n\nx + (30 - x) = 45\n30 = 45\nx = 15\n\nSo, y = 30 - 15 = 15.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the profit function at this corner point:\n\nP(15, 15) = 20(15) + 30(15) = 300 + 450 = $750\n\nSince there are no other corner points to evaluate, the company should produce 15 units of product A and 15 units of product B to maximize its weekly profit of $750."
