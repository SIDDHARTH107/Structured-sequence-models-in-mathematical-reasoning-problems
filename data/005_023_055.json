    "message_1": "Suppose you are given a dataset of 20 numbers, where 19 of them fall in the range of 5 to 12, and one number is an outlier. Find the outlier using the 1.5 × IQR rule.",
    "message_2": "To find the outlier using the 1.5 × IQR rule, we first need to find the Interquartile Range (IQR) of the dataset. The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n\nStep 1: Arrange the dataset in ascending order.\n\nStep 2: Find Q1 and Q3.\n- Q1 is the median of the first half of the dataset (the value at the 25th percentile).\n- Q3 is the median of the second half of the dataset (the value at the 75th percentile).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the IQR.\nIQR = Q3 - Q1\n\nStep 4: Calculate the lower and upper bounds for outliers.\n- Lower bound = Q1 - 1.5 × IQR\n- Upper bound = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR\n\nStep 5: Identify the outlier(s).\nAny number in the dataset that falls below the lower bound or above the upper bound is considered an outlier.\n\nSince we don't have the actual dataset, we can't provide the exact outlier. However, if you follow these steps with your dataset, you should be able to identify the outlier using the 1.5 × IQR rule."
