    "message_1": "Suppose you have a product with a fixed cost of $100 and a variable cost of $5 per unit. If you can sell each unit at a price of $20, how many units do you need to sell to break even?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units needed to sell to break even. The break-even point is when the total cost equals the total revenue.\n\nTotal cost = Fixed cost + Variable cost * Number of units\nTotal revenue = Price per unit * Number of units\n\nBreak-even point: Total cost = Total revenue\n\n100 + 5x = 20x\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\n\n100 = 20x - 5x\n100 = 15x\nx = 100 / 15\nx â‰ˆ 6.67\n\nSince you cannot sell a fraction of a unit, you need to sell 7 units to break even."
