Use the finite element method with linear triangular elements to obtain an approximate solution $u_h(x,y)$ with a total of 121 nodes on a uniform mesh. Calculate the $L^2$ norm of the error ||u - u_h||, where $u(x,y) = \\sin(2\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi y)$ is the exact solution.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given Poisson equation using the finite element method with linear triangular elements, we first need to discretize the domain and set up the weak form of the problem. \n\n1. Discretize the domain: Since we have 121 nodes on a uniform mesh, we can create a 10x10 grid with a spacing of h=1/10=0.1. This will result in 100 squares, each divided into two triangles, for a total of 200 triangular elements.\n\n2. Weak form: Multiply the Poisson equation by a test function v(x,y) and integrate over the domain Î©. Using integration by parts, we get:\n\n$\\int_\\Omega \\nabla^2 u(x,y) v(x,y) dxdy = -\\int_\\Omega 4\\pi\\sin(2\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi y) v(x,y) dxdy$\n\n$\\int_\\Omega \\nabla u(x,y) \\cdot \\nabla v(x,y) dxdy = \\int_\\Omega 4\\pi\\sin(2\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi y) v(x,y) dxdy$\n\n3. Finite element approximation: Approximate the solution u(x,y) and test function v(x,y) using linear basis functions on the triangular elements.\n\n$u_h(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{121} U_i \\phi_i(x,y)$\n\n$v_h(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{121} V_i \\phi_i(x,y)$\n\n4. Assembly: Substitute the approximations into the weak form and assemble the global stiffness matrix K and load vector F.\n\n$K_{ij} = \\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\phi_i(x,y) \\cdot \\nabla \\phi_j(x,y) dxdy$\n\n$F_i = \\int_\\Omega 4\\pi\\sin(2\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi y) \\phi_i(x,y) dxdy$\n\n5. Apply boundary conditions: Since we have Dirichlet boundary conditions, we set the values of U_i to zero for nodes on the boundary.\n\n6. Solve the linear system: Solve the linear system KU=F for the unknown coefficients U.\n\n7. Calculate the error: Compute the $L^2$ norm of the error between the exact solution u(x,y) and the finite element approximation u_h(x,y).\n\n$||u - u_h||_{L^2} = \\sqrt{\\int_\\Omega (u(x,y) - u_h(x,y))^2 dxdy}$\n\nAfter performing these steps, we can obtain the finite element approximation u_h(x,y) and calculate the $L^2$ norm of the error. However, this requires numerical integration and solving a linear system, which is not feasible to do by hand. Instead, one would typically use a finite element software package or write a custom code to perform these calculations."
