    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal that increases its perimeter with each iteration. The perimeter of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial Perimeter * (5^(n-1))\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial perimeter is 12 units, and we want to find the perimeter of the sixth iteration (n=6).\n\nPerimeter = 12 * (5^(6-1))\nPerimeter = 12 * (5^5)\nPerimeter = 12 * 3125\nPerimeter = 37500 units\n\nSo, the length of the perimeter of the sixth iteration of the Vicsek fractal is 37,500 units."
