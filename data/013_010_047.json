    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot duopoly game between two firms, A and B, where the demand function is Q = 160 - P and the marginal cost for each firm is MC = 20.\n\nWhat will be the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm?\n\nHint: To find the equilibrium quantity, set the marginal revenue (MR) equal to the marginal cost (MC) and solve for Q.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the inverse demand function by solving for P in terms of Q:\n\nP = 160 - Q\n\nNow, let's find the total revenue (TR) for each firm:\n\nTRA = PA * QA = (160 - QA - QB) * QA\nTRB = PB * QB = (160 - QA - QB) * QB\n\nNext, we'll find the marginal revenue (MR) for each firm by taking the derivative of the total revenue with respect to the quantity produced:\n\nMRA = d(TRA)/d(QA) = 160 - 2QA - QB\nMRB = d(TRB)/d(QB) = 160 - QA - 2QB\n\nNow, we'll set the marginal revenue equal to the marginal cost for each firm:\n\nMRA = MC => 160 - 2QA - QB = 20\nMRB = MC => 160 - QA - 2QB = 20\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (QA and QB). We can solve for one of the variables in terms of the other:\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express QA in terms of QB:\n\nQA = 70 - 0.5QB\n\nNow, substitute this expression for QA into the second equation:\n\n160 - (70 - 0.5QB) - 2QB = 20\n\nSimplify and solve for QB:\n\n90 + 0.5QB - 2QB = 20\n-1.5QB = -70\nQB = 70/1.5 = 46.67 (approximately)\n\nNow, substitute the value of QB back into the expression for QA:\n\nQA = 70 - 0.5(46.67) = 46.67 (approximately)\n\nSo, in equilibrium, both firms A and B will produce approximately 46.67 units each."
