    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall. The angle formed between the ladder and the ground is 62 degrees, and the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall is 10 feet. What is the length of the ladder?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the ladder, we can use the trigonometric function tangent. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle is 62 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the length of the ladder (which we want to find), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall, which is 10 feet.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(62°) = (length of ladder) / 10\n\nNow, we can find the tangent of 62 degrees:\n\ntan(62°) ≈ 1.8807\n\nNext, we can solve for the length of the ladder:\n\n1.8807 = (length of ladder) / 10\n\nLength of ladder ≈ 1.8807 * 10\n\nLength of ladder ≈ 18.807 feet\n\nSo, the length of the ladder is approximately 18.807 feet."
