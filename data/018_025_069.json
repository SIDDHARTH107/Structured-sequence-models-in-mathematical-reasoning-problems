    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection: A Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nFirst, let's find A Δ B:\nA = {1, 3, 5}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {3}\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find B Δ A:\nB = {2, 3, 4}\nA = {1, 3, 5}\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB ∩ A = {3}\nB Δ A = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nFinally, let's find the intersection of (A Δ B) and (B Δ A):\n(A Δ B) ∩ (B Δ A) = {1, 2, 4, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nSo, (A Δ B) ∩ (B Δ A) = {1, 2, 4, 5}."
