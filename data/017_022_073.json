    "message_2": "To find all possible cyclic subgroups of a group of order 60, we first find all the divisors of 60. The divisors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60. For each divisor, there exists a cyclic subgroup of that order. So, the possible cyclic subgroups are of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.\n\nNow, we will use this information to determine whether the group is isomorphic to C60. A group is isomorphic to C60 if it is a cyclic group of order 60. Since there is a cyclic subgroup of order 60, it is possible that the group is isomorphic to C60. However, we cannot conclude this without further information about the group's structure.\n\nIf the group is not isomorphic to C60, we will determine whether it is isomorphic to A5 × C2 or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. A5 is the alternating group of degree 5, which has order 5!/2 = 60/2 = 30. C2 is the cyclic group of order 2. The direct product A5 × C2 has order 30 × 2 = 60.\n\nTo determine whether the group is isomorphic to A5 × C2, we need to check if it has a normal subgroup of order 30 and a subgroup of order 2. Since there are cyclic subgroups of orders 30 and 2, it is possible that the group is isomorphic to A5 × C2. However, we cannot conclude this without further information about the group's structure.\n\nIf the group is not isomorphic to C60 or A5 × C2, it must be one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. To determine which of these groups it is, we would need more information about the group's structure, such as its presentation or a list of its elements and their relations.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the group's structure, we cannot definitively determine whether it is isomorphic to C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. However, we have found all possible cyclic subgroups of the group, which are of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60."
