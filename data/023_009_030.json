    "message_2": "First, let's find the Fourier coefficients for the Fourier series of f(t) = 4t. The Fourier series of a function f(t) on the interval [-L, L] is given by:\n\nf(t) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπt/L) + b_n * sin(nπt/L)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and L = 1 in this case. The coefficients are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(t) dt\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(t) * cos(nπt/L) dt\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(t) * sin(nπt/L) dt\n\nSince f(t) is an odd function (f(-t) = -f(t)), all the a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients:\n\nb_n = (1/1) * ∫[-1, 1] 4t * sin(nπt) dt\n\nTo find the integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 4t, dv = sin(nπt) dt\ndu = 4 dt, v = -(1/nπ) * cos(nπt)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nb_n = [-4t * (1/nπ) * cos(nπt)] [-1, 1] - ∫[-1, 1] -(1/nπ) * cos(nπt) * 4 dt\n\nb_n = [4/nπ * cos(nπ) - 4/nπ * cos(-nπ)] + (4/nπ) * ∫[-1, 1] cos(nπt) dt\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and cos(-nπ) = (-1)^n:\n\nb_n = 0 + (4/nπ) * ∫[-1, 1] cos(nπt) dt\n\nNow, we integrate cos(nπt) with respect to t:\n\n∫[-1, 1] cos(nπt) dt = (1/nπ) * [sin(nπt)] [-1, 1]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n:\n\nb_n = 0\n\nThus, all the Fourier coefficients are zero, and the Fourier series of f(t) = 4t is identically zero on the interval [-1, 1].\n\nNow, let's solve the boundary value problem:\n\nf ''(t) + f(t) = 8t, with f(-1) = f(1) = 0\n\nSince the Fourier series of f(t) = 4t is identically zero, we can write:\n\nf ''(t) + 0 = 8t\n\nf ''(t) = 8t\n\nTo solve this second-order differential equation, we can integrate twice:\n\nf '(t) = 4t^2 + C1\nf(t) = (4/3)t^3 + C1*t + C2\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\nf(-1) = (4/3)(-1)^3 - C1 + C2 = 0\nf(1) = (4/3)(1)^3 + C1 + C2 = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we get C1 = 0 and C2 = -4/3. Thus, the solution to the boundary value problem is:\n\nf(t) = (4/3)t^3 - 4/3"
