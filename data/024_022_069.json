    "message_2": "To find the isometries of the given metric that fix the point (1,1), we first need to understand what an isometry is. An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points in the space. In this case, we are looking for transformations that preserve the metric $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + 2dxdy$ and fix the point (1,1).\n\nLet's consider a transformation $(x, y) \\to (x', y')$ such that the point (1,1) is fixed. This means that when $(x, y) = (1, 1)$, we have $(x', y') = (1, 1)$. Now, we need to find the transformations that preserve the given metric. To do this, we can write the metric in terms of the transformed coordinates:\n\n$ds^2 = (dx')^2 + (dy')^2 + 2dx'dy'$.\n\nNow, we can use the chain rule to express $dx'$ and $dy'$ in terms of $dx$ and $dy$. Let $x' = f(x, y)$ and $y' = g(x, y)$, then:\n\n$dx' = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy$,\n\n$dy' = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} dy$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the metric equation, we get:\n\n$ds^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 dx^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 dy^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\right)dxdy$.\n\nFor this equation to be equal to the original metric, we need the following conditions to hold:\n\n1. $\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 = 1$,\n2. $\\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 = 1$,\n3. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = 1$.\n\nFrom conditions 1 and 2, we know that $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\pm 1$ and $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = \\pm 1$. Now, we need to find the functions $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$ that satisfy these conditions and the third condition.\n\nLet's consider the case where both partial derivatives are positive:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 1$, $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = 1$.\n\nIntegrating these equations, we get:\n\n$f(x, y) = x + h(y)$, $g(x, y) = y + k(x)$,\n\nwhere $h(y)$ and $k(x)$ are functions of $y$ and $x$, respectively.\n\nNow, we need to find the functions $h(y)$ and $k(x)$ that satisfy the third condition:\n\n$1 + \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial x} = 1$.\n\nThis equation implies that $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial x} = 0$. Since both $h(y)$ and $k(x)$ cannot be constants (otherwise, the transformation would not fix the point (1,1)), we can conclude that either $h(y) = 0$ or $k(x) = 0$. Thus, we have two possible transformations:\n\n1. $f(x, y) = x$, $g(x, y) = y + k(x)$, with $k(1) = 0$,\n2. $f(x, y) = x + h(y)$, $g(x, y) = y$, with $h(1) = 0$.\n\nSimilarly, we can consider the case where both partial derivatives are negative:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -1$, $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = -1$.\n\nFollowing the same steps, we find two more possible transformations:\n\n3. $f(x, y) = -x$, $g(x, y) = y + k(x)$, with $k(-1) = 0$,\n4. $f(x, y) = x + h(y)$, $g(x, y) = -y$, with $h(-1) = 0$.\n\nIn conclusion, there are four possible isometries of the given metric that fix the point (1,1):\n\n1. $(x', y') = (x, y + k(x))$, with $k(1) = 0$,\n2. $(x', y') = (x + h(y), y)$, with $h(1) = 0$,\n3. $(x', y') = (-x, y + k(x))$, with $k(-1) = 0$,\n4. $(x', y') = (x + h(y), -y)$, with $h(-1) = 0$."
