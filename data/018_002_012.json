    "message_2": "To show that the intersection of A and B is a subset of both A and B, we first need to find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nIntersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, can be found by comparing the elements of A and B and identifying the common elements.\n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\nB = {2, 5, 7, 8, 11}\n\nComparing the elements of A and B, we find that the common elements are 2 and 8. Therefore, the intersection of A and B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 8}\n\nNow, we need to show that A ∩ B is a subset of both A and B. A set C is a subset of a set D (denoted as C ⊆ D) if every element of C is also an element of D.\n\nLet's check if A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 8}\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nBoth elements of A ∩ B (2 and 8) are also elements of A. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of A (A ∩ B ⊆ A).\n\nNow, let's check if A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 8}\nB = {2, 5, 7, 8, 11}\n\nBoth elements of A ∩ B (2 and 8) are also elements of B. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of B (A ∩ B ⊆ B).\n\nSince A ∩ B is a subset of both A and B, we have shown that the intersection of A and B is a subset of both A and B."
