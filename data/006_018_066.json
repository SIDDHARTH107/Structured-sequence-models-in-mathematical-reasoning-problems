    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a financial fraud occurring in the company, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the successful outcome is a financial fraud, and there have been 3 financial fraud cases out of a total of 10,000 transactions.\n\nProbability = (3) / (10,000) = 0.0003\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we can multiply the probability by 100:\n\n0.0003 * 100 = 0.03%\n\nSo, the probability of a financial fraud occurring in the company is 0.03%."
