    "message_2": "First, we will use Gaussian elimination to solve the system of linear equations. We will represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n|  2  3 -1 |  1 |\n|  1 -2  4 | -2 |\n|  3  2 -3 |  0 |\n\nStep 1: Swap row 1 and row 2 to have a 1 in the top left corner:\n\n|  1 -2  4 | -2 |\n|  2  3 -1 |  1 |\n|  3  2 -3 |  0 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the 2 and 3 below the 1 in the top left corner by subtracting multiples of row 1 from rows 2 and 3:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 3 * Row 1\n\n|  1 -2  4 | -2 |\n|  0  7 -9 |  5 |\n|  0  8 -15 |  6 |\n\nStep 3: Divide row 2 by 7 to get a 1 in the second row, second column:\n\n|  1 -2  4 | -2 |\n|  0  1 -9/7 | 5/7 |\n|  0  8 -15 |  6 |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the 8 below the 1 in the second row, second column by subtracting 8 times row 2 from row 3:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 8 * Row 2\n\n|  1 -2  4 | -2 |\n|  0  1 -9/7 | 5/7 |\n|  0  0  3 | -2 |\n\nStep 5: Divide row 3 by 3 to get a 1 in the third row, third column:\n\n|  1 -2  4 | -2 |\n|  0  1 -9/7 | 5/7 |\n|  0  0  1 | -2/3 |\n\nStep 6: Use back substitution to find the solution:\n\nz = -2/3\n\ny = 5/7 + (9/7) * (-2/3) = 5/7 - 6/7 = -1/7\n\nx = -2 + 2 * (-1/7) - 4 * (-2/3) = -2 + 4/7 + 8/3 = (9/21) + (12/21) + (56/21) = 77/21\n\nSo, the solution is x = 77/21, y = -1/7, and z = -2/3.\n\nNow, let's verify the solution by substituting the values of x, y, and z in the original equations:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 2(77/21) + 3(-1/7) - (-2/3) = 154/21 - 3/7 + 2/3 = (154 + 9 + 14)/21 = 177/21 = 1\n\nx - 2y + 4z = 77/21 - 2(-1/7) + 4(-2/3) = 77/21 + 2/7 - 8/3 = (77 + 6 - 56)/21 = 27/21 = -2\n\n3x + 2y - 3z = 3(77/21) + 2(-1/7) - 3(-2/3) = 231/21 - 2/7 + 6/3 = (231 - 6 + 42)/21 = 267/21 = 0\n\nThe solution is verified, and the final answer is x = 77/21, y = -1/7, and z = -2/3."
