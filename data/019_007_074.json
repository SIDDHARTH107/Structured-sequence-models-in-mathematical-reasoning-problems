    "message_1": "In a non-monotonic logic system, let p, q, and r be statements. If p implies q and q implies r, but it is unknown whether p is true or false, then what can be said about the truth value of r?",
    "message_2": "In a non-monotonic logic system, the truth value of a statement can change when new information is added. Given that p implies q and q implies r, we can say that if p is true, then q is true, and if q is true, then r is true. However, since we do not know the truth value of p, we cannot definitively determine the truth value of r in a non-monotonic logic system. The truth value of r remains uncertain until more information is provided."
