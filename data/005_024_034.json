    "message_2": "To calculate the z-score of a value in a dataset, we use the following formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere z is the z-score, X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, X = 21, μ = 15, and σ = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (21 - 15) / 3\nz = 6 / 3\nz = 2\n\nThe z-score of a value of 21 in this dataset is 2."
