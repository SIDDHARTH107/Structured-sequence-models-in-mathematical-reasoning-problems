    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & -3 & 4 \\\\\n2 & 4 & -6 & 8 \\\\\n3 & 6 & -9 & 10\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we will perform the elimination method with partial pivoting. The first step is to find the largest element in the first column, which is 3. We will swap the first and third rows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 6 & -9 & 10 \\\\\n2 & 4 & -6 & 8 \\\\\n1 & 2 & -3 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNext, we will eliminate the first element in the second and third rows. To do this, we will subtract $\\frac{2}{3}$ times the first row from the second row and subtract the first row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 6 & -9 & 10 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nAt this point, we can see that the second and third rows are all zeros, which means that the system of linear equations is dependent. There is no unique solution to this system. However, we can still find the general solution by expressing one variable in terms of the other variables.\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\n$$\n3x + 6y - 9z = 10\n$$\n\nDivide by 3:\n\n$$\nx + 2y - 3z = \\frac{10}{3}\n$$\n\nNow, let's express $x$ in terms of $y$ and $z$:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{10}{3} - 2y + 3z\n$$\n\nThis is the general solution to the system of linear equations, where $y$ and $z$ can be any real numbers."
