The circuit is connected to a 50V AC source. \n\nWrite the differential equation governing the current in the circuit as a function of time, and solve for the current as a function of time, assuming an initial current of 0 and no stored charge on the capacitor at t=0.",
    "message_2": "To write the differential equation governing the current in the RLC circuit, we'll use Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL), which states that the sum of the voltages around a closed loop in a circuit is equal to zero. For an RLC circuit connected to an AC source, the KVL equation is:\n\nV(t) = L * (di/dt) + R * i(t) + (1/C) * ∫i(t) dt\n\nwhere V(t) is the voltage across the AC source, L is the inductance, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, i(t) is the current as a function of time, and di/dt is the derivative of the current with respect to time.\n\nGiven the problem statement, we have:\n\nV(t) = 50 * sin(ωt)\nR = 10 ohms\nL = 0.1 H\nC = 0.00001 F\n\nWe need to find the angular frequency ω of the AC source. Since the problem doesn't provide this information, we'll leave it as a variable in the solution.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the KVL equation as:\n\n50 * sin(ωt) = 0.1 * (di/dt) + 10 * i(t) + (1/0.00001) * ∫i(t) dt\n\nDifferentiating both sides of the equation with respect to time, we get:\n\n50ω * cos(ωt) = 0.1 * (d²i/dt²) + 10 * (di/dt) + (1/0.00001) * i(t)\n\nNow, we have a second-order linear differential equation:\n\n(d²i/dt²) + 100 * (di/dt) + 100000 * i(t) = 500ω * cos(ωt)\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we'll first find the complementary solution by solving the homogeneous equation:\n\n(d²i/dt²) + 100 * (di/dt) + 100000 * i(t) = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is:\n\nr² + 100r + 100000 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get two complex roots:\n\nr1,2 = -50 ± j50√3\n\nThe complementary solution is:\n\ni_c(t) = e^(-50t) * (A * cos(50√3 * t) + B * sin(50√3 * t))\n\nNow, we need to find a particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation. We'll use the method of undetermined coefficients and assume a particular solution of the form:\n\ni_p(t) = C * cos(ωt) + D * sin(ωt)\n\nDifferentiating i_p(t) with respect to time, we get:\n\ndi_p/dt = -ωC * sin(ωt) + ωD * cos(ωt)\n\nDifferentiating again, we get:\n\nd²i_p/dt² = -ω²C * cos(ωt) - ω²D * sin(ωt)\n\nSubstituting i_p(t), di_p/dt, and d²i_p/dt² into the non-homogeneous equation, we get:\n\n-ω²C * cos(ωt) - ω²D * sin(ωt) + 100 * (-ωC * sin(ωt) + ωD * cos(ωt)) + 100000 * (C * cos(ωt) + D * sin(ωt)) = 500ω * cos(ωt)\n\nEquating the coefficients of cos(ωt) and sin(ωt), we get two equations:\n\n-ω²C + 100ωD + 100000C = 500ω\n-ω²D - 100ωC + 100000D = 0\n\nSolving this system of linear equations for C and D, we get:\n\nC = (500ω) / (ω² + 100000)\nD = 0\n\nNow, we have the particular solution:\n\ni_p(t) = (500ω) / (ω² + 100000) * cos(ωt)\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the complementary and particular solutions:\n\ni(t) = e^(-50t) * (A * cos(50√3 * t) + B * sin(50√3 * t)) + (500ω) / (ω² + 100000) * cos(ωt)\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we'll use the initial conditions:\n\ni(0) = 0\nThere is no initial charge on the capacitor, so the voltage across the capacitor is 0 at t=0, which means the voltage across the inductor is equal to the source voltage:\n\nL * (di/dt) = V(0) = 50V\n\nUsing the initial conditions, we get:\n\n0 = A + (500ω) / (ω² + 100000)\n0.1 * (di/dt) = 50\n\nDifferentiating i(t) with respect to time and evaluating at t=0, we get:\n\ndi/dt = -50 * e^(-50t) * (A * cos(50√3 * t) + B * sin(50√3 * t)) - 50√3 * e^(-50t) * (A * sin(50√3 * t) - B * cos(50√3 * t)) - (500ω²) / (ω² + 100000) * sin(ωt)\n\n(di/dt)(0) = -50A - 50√3B\n\nSubstituting the initial conditions, we get:\n\n-50A - 50√3B = 500\n\nNow, we have a system of linear equations:\n\nA + (500ω) / (ω² + 100000) = 0\n-50A - 50√3B = 500\n\nSolving this system for A and B, we get:\n\nA = -(500ω) / (ω² + 100000)\nB = (500 - 50A) / (50√3)\n\nSubstituting A and B back into the general solution, we get:\n\ni(t) = e^(-50t) * (-(500ω) / (ω² + 100000) * cos(50√3 * t) + ((500 - 50A) / (50√3)) * sin(50√3 * t)) + (500ω) / (ω² + 100000) * cos(ωt)\n\nThis is the current as a function of time in the RLC circuit, given the initial conditions and the provided component values."
