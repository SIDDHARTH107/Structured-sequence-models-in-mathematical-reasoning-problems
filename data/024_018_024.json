    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature at the point (1,1,1) in the direction of the vector v = 2i - j + k, we first need to find the tangent plane at the given point and then find the normal vector to the tangent plane. After that, we can find the sectional curvature using the formula.\n\n1. Find the tangent plane at the point (1,1,1):\n\nThe gradient of the surface S is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∇S = (∂z/∂x, ∂z/∂y) = (6x, -4y)\n\nAt the point (1,1,1), the gradient is:\n\n∇S(1,1,1) = (6, -4)\n\nThe tangent plane at the point (1,1,1) can be described by the equation:\n\nz - 1 = 6(x - 1) - 4(y - 1)\n\n2. Find the normal vector to the tangent plane:\n\nThe normal vector to the tangent plane is given by the gradient vector:\n\nN = (6, -4, -1)\n\n3. Project the vector v onto the tangent plane:\n\nv = (2, -1, 1)\n\nTo project v onto the tangent plane, we need to subtract the component of v in the direction of the normal vector N:\n\nproj_v = v - (v·N / ||N||^2) * N\n\nv·N = 2*6 + (-1)*(-4) + 1*(-1) = 12 + 4 - 1 = 15\n||N||^2 = 6^2 + (-4)^2 + (-1)^2 = 36 + 16 + 1 = 53\n\nproj_v = (2, -1, 1) - (15/53) * (6, -4, -1) = (2 - 90/53, -1 + 60/53, 1 + 15/53) = (16/53, 8/53, 68/53)\n\n4. Find the sectional curvature:\n\nThe sectional curvature K is given by the formula:\n\nK = (proj_v·∇^2S·proj_v) / ||proj_v||^4\n\nFirst, we need to find the Hessian matrix (∇^2S) of the surface S:\n\n∇^2S = | ∂^2z/∂x^2  ∂^2z/∂x∂y |\n           | ∂^2z/∂y∂x  ∂^2z/∂y^2 |\n\n∇^2S = | 6  0 |\n           | 0 -4 |\n\nNow, we can find the sectional curvature:\n\nproj_v·∇^2S·proj_v = (16/53, 8/53) * | 6  0 | * (16/53, 8/53)\n                                      | 0 -4 |\n\n= (16/53 * 6 * 16/53 + 8/53 * (-4) * 8/53, 16/53 * 6 * 8/53 + 8/53 * (-4) * 16/53)\n\n= (256/53^2, -512/53^2)\n\nK = (256 - 512) / (16^2 + 8^2)^2 = -256 / (256 + 64)^2 = -256 / 320^2\n\nThe sectional curvature at the point (1,1,1) in the direction of the vector v = 2i - j + k is -256 / 320^2."
