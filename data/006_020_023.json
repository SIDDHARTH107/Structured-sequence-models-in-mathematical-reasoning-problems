    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, owning a dog) in n trials (in this case, selecting 5 people)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (owning a dog) for each trial (person)\n- n is the number of trials (5 people selected)\n- k is the number of successes (3 people owning a dog)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 5 (5 people selected)\n- k = 3 (exactly 3 people owning a dog)\n- p = 0.8 (80% of the community owns a dog)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(n, k):\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n= 5! / (3! * 2!)\n= (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\n= 120 / (6 * 2)\n= 120 / 12\n= 10\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * 0.8^3 * (1-0.8)^(5-3)\n= 10 * 0.8^3 * 0.2^2\n= 10 * 0.512 * 0.04\n= 10 * 0.02048\n= 0.2048\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 3 out of the 5 randomly selected people own a dog is 0.2048 or 20.48%."
