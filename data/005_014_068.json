    "message_1": "In a factor analysis of test scores, a student finds that there are 4 underlying factors that explain the variance in the data. The factor loadings (correlations between observed variables and factors) for one of the factors are:\n\n- Math Test Score: 0.8 \n- Science Test Score: 0.6 \n- English Test Score: 0.4 \n- History Test Score: -0.2\n\nCalculate the factor score for a student who scored 80 on Math, 70 on Science, 90 on English, and 85 on History tests.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the factor score for the student, we need to multiply each test score by its respective factor loading and then sum the results.\n\nFactor score = (Math Test Score × Math Factor Loading) + (Science Test Score × Science Factor Loading) + (English Test Score × English Factor Loading) + (History Test Score × History Factor Loading)\n\nFactor score = (80 × 0.8) + (70 × 0.6) + (90 × 0.4) + (85 × -0.2)\n\nFactor score = 64 + 42 + 36 - 17\n\nFactor score = 125\n\nThe factor score for this student is 125."
