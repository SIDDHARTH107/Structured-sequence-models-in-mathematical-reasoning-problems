Given the construction of the Peano curve, which is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and repeating a pattern of transformations on each line segment of the shape. Find the length of the resulting curve after n iterations if the length of the initial triangle is 1.",
    "message_2": "The Peano curve you are referring to is likely the \"Peano-Gosper curve\" or \"Gosper curve,\" which is a space-filling curve that starts with an equilateral triangle and goes through a series of transformations.\n\nIn each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 7/3. This is because each line segment is replaced by a new sequence of 7 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nTo find the length of the resulting curve after n iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (7/3)^n\n\nSince the initial length of the triangle is 1, the formula becomes:\n\nLength = 1 * (7/3)^n\n\nSo, the length of the Peano-Gosper curve after n iterations is (7/3)^n."
