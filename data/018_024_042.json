    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4} be the two sets. Find the symmetric difference of A and B. Then, find the complement of A and B. Finally, prove that the symmetric difference of A and B is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In this case, the intersection of A and B is {2, 3}. So, the symmetric difference of A and B is {1, 4}.\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A and B. The complement of a set is the set of all elements that are not in the given set. However, to find the complement, we need to know the universal set, which is not provided in the problem. So, we cannot find the complement of A and B without more information.\n\nFinally, let's prove that the symmetric difference of A and B is not distributive over complement. The symmetric difference is distributive over complement if the following equation holds true:\n\n(A Δ B)' = A' Δ B'\n\nHowever, as we mentioned earlier, we cannot find the complement of A and B without knowing the universal set. Therefore, we cannot prove or disprove that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over complement without more information."
