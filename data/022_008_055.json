    "message_2": "To prove that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 2, we will use Liouville's theorem and Cauchy's integral formula.\n\nLiouville's theorem states that if a function g(z) is entire and bounded, then g(z) is constant.\n\nCauchy's integral formula states that for an entire function g(z) and a closed contour Γ in the complex plane, the nth derivative of g(z) at a point a is given by:\n\ng^(n)(a) = n!/(2πi) ∫(g(z)/(z-a)^(n+1)) dz, where the integral is taken over the contour Γ.\n\nNow, let's consider the function g(z) = f(z)/z^2. Since f(z) is entire, g(z) is also entire except for a removable singularity at z = 0. We can remove this singularity by defining g(0) = f''(0)/2, where f''(0) is the second derivative of f(z) at z = 0.\n\nNow, let's estimate the modulus of g(z) using the inequality given for f(z):\n\n|g(z)| = |f(z)/z^2| ≤ 5|z|^2/|z|^2 = 5.\n\nSince |g(z)| is bounded, by Liouville's theorem, g(z) must be a constant function. Let's denote this constant as C.\n\nNow, we have g(z) = C for all z in the complex plane. This means that f(z) = Cz^2 for all z. Since f(z) is entire, it must be a polynomial of degree at most 2.\n\nThus, we have proven that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 2."
