    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Polya's Enumeration Theorem, we first need to find the cycle index of the symmetry group of a regular pentagon. The symmetry group of a regular pentagon has 10 elements: 5 rotations and 5 reflections.\n\n1. Identity (no rotation): The cycle index is (a_1)^5, as there are 5 cycles of length 1.\n2. Rotation by 72째 or 144째: The cycle index is (a_5)^1, as there is 1 cycle of length 5. There are 2 such rotations.\n3. Rotation by 216째 or 288째: The cycle index is (a_5)^1, as there is 1 cycle of length 5. There are 2 such rotations.\n4. Reflections: The cycle index is (a_1)^1 * (a_2)^2, as there is 1 cycle of length 1 and 2 cycles of length 2. There are 5 such reflections.\n\nNow, we can compute the cycle index polynomial for the symmetry group of a regular pentagon:\n\nP(a_1, a_2, a_5) = (1/10) * [(a_1)^5 + 2(a_5)^1 + 2(a_5)^1 + 5(a_1)^1 * (a_2)^2]\nP(a_1, a_2, a_5) = (1/10) * [(a_1)^5 + 4(a_5)^1 + 5(a_1)^1 * (a_2)^2]\n\nNext, we substitute a_1 = x + y + z, a_2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2, and a_5 = x^5 + y^5 + z^5, where x, y, and z represent the 3 colors:\n\nP(x, y, z) = (1/10) * [(x + y + z)^5 + 4(x^5 + y^5 + z^5) + 5(x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2]\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of the terms with x^5y^1z^1, x^1y^5z^1, and x^1y^1z^5 in the expansion of P(x, y, z), as these terms represent the colorings with each color used at least once.\n\nExpanding P(x, y, z) and collecting the coefficients of the required terms, we get:\n\nCoefficient of x^5y^1z^1, x^1y^5z^1, and x^1y^1z^5 = 30 + 20 + 20 = 70\n\nTherefore, there are 70 ways to color the corners of a regular pentagon using 3 colors such that we use each color at least once."
