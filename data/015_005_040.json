    "message_2": "To obtain a chaotic attractor in the Rössler system, the parameters a, b, and c must be chosen such that the system exhibits chaotic behavior. One set of parameter values that is known to result in a chaotic attractor is:\n\na = 0.2\nb = 0.2\nc = 5.7\n\nThese values are not unique, and other combinations of a, b, and c can also lead to chaotic behavior in the Rössler system. However, this particular set of values is well-known and widely used in the study of chaotic dynamics."
