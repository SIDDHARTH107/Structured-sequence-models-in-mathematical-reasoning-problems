The position of the oscillator is given by y(t) with the initial condition being y(0) = 2 cm and the initial velocity v(0) = 0 cm/s. The values of m, k, and b are 0.5 kg, 15 N/m, and 0.1 Ns/m, respectively. \n\nFind an expression for the position of the oscillator y(t) as a function of time. What is the amplitude, frequency, and the period of the motion? What is the maximum speed of the oscillator? How long will it take for the oscillator to complete its 10th oscillation?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the angular frequency (ω) and the damping ratio (ζ) for the given system. The angular frequency is given by:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and m is the mass. Plugging in the given values:\n\nω = sqrt(15 N/m / 0.5 kg) = sqrt(30) rad/s ≈ 5.48 rad/s\n\nThe damping ratio is given by:\n\nζ = b / (2 * sqrt(m * k))\n\nwhere b is the damping coefficient. Plugging in the given values:\n\nζ = 0.1 Ns/m / (2 * sqrt(0.5 kg * 15 N/m)) ≈ 0.014\n\nSince ζ < 1, the system is underdamped, and the position of the oscillator y(t) can be expressed as:\n\ny(t) = A * e^(-ζωt) * cos(ω_d * t + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, ω_d is the damped angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle. The damped angular frequency is given by:\n\nω_d = ω * sqrt(1 - ζ^2) ≈ 5.48 rad/s\n\nNow, we need to find the amplitude A and the phase angle φ. We know that y(0) = 2 cm and v(0) = 0 cm/s. Using these initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = A * cos(φ) = 2 cm\nv(0) = -A * ζω * sin(φ) + A * ω_d * cos(φ) = 0 cm/s\n\nSince y(0) = 2 cm, we have:\n\nA * cos(φ) = 2 cm\n\nNow, we can use the second equation to find the phase angle φ:\n\n0 = -A * ζω * sin(φ) + A * ω_d * cos(φ)\n\nDividing both sides by A and rearranging:\n\ntan(φ) = ω_d / (ζω)\n\nφ = arctan(ω_d / (ζω)) ≈ arctan(5.48 / (0.014 * 5.48)) ≈ 0 rad\n\nNow, we can find the amplitude A using the first equation:\n\nA * cos(φ) = 2 cm\nA = 2 cm / cos(φ) ≈ 2 cm\n\nSo, the expression for the position of the oscillator y(t) is:\n\ny(t) = 2 * e^(-0.014 * 5.48 * t) * cos(5.48 * t) cm\n\nNow, let's find the frequency (f) and the period (T) of the motion:\n\nf = ω_d / (2 * π) ≈ 5.48 / (2 * π) ≈ 0.872 Hz\nT = 1 / f ≈ 1.147 s\n\nThe maximum speed of the oscillator can be found using the derivative of y(t) with respect to time:\n\nv(t) = dy/dt = -A * ζω * e^(-ζωt) * sin(ω_d * t) - A * ω_d * e^(-ζωt) * cos(ω_d * t)\n\nThe maximum speed occurs when the derivative of v(t) with respect to time is zero. This happens when the argument of the sine and cosine functions are equal to π/2 or 3π/2. Using the first case:\n\nω_d * t = π/2\nt = (π/2) / ω_d ≈ 0.287 s\n\nPlugging this value of t into the expression for v(t):\n\nv_max ≈ -2 * 0.014 * 5.48 * e^(-0.014 * 5.48 * 0.287) * sin(5.48 * 0.287) - 2 * 5.48 * e^(-0.014 * 5.48 * 0.287) * cos(5.48 * 0.287) ≈ 10.96 cm/s\n\nFinally, to find the time it takes for the oscillator to complete its 10th oscillation, we can simply multiply the period by 10:\n\nt_10 = 10 * T ≈ 10 * 1.147 ≈ 11.47 s\n\nIn summary:\n\n- The expression for the position of the oscillator y(t) is: y(t) = 2 * e^(-0.014 * 5.48 * t) * cos(5.48 * t) cm\n- The amplitude is 2 cm, the frequency is 0.872 Hz, and the period is 1.147 s.\n- The maximum speed of the oscillator is approximately 10.96 cm/s.\n- It will take approximately 11.47 seconds for the oscillator to complete its 10th oscillation."
