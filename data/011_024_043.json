There are three possible shipping routes that can be taken, each with a different cost and maximum capacity. The capacities and costs of each route are as follows:\n\nRoute 1: Maximum capacity of 2,000 units and a cost of $500 per unit.\nRoute 2: Maximum capacity of 4,000 units and a cost of $600 per unit.\nRoute 3: Maximum capacity of 6,000 units and a cost of $700 per unit.\n\nWhat is the minimum cost for the company to transport all 8,000 units of the product from city A to city B using these routes?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost, we should try to use the routes with the lowest cost per unit first. Since Route 1 has the lowest cost per unit, we will use its maximum capacity of 2,000 units. This leaves us with 6,000 units remaining to transport.\n\nNext, we will use Route 2, which has the next lowest cost per unit. Route 2 has a maximum capacity of 4,000 units, so we can transport all the remaining 6,000 units using Route 2 and Route 3. We will use the maximum capacity of Route 2, which is 4,000 units. This leaves us with 2,000 units remaining to transport.\n\nFinally, we will use Route 3 to transport the remaining 2,000 units.\n\nNow let's calculate the total cost:\n\nRoute 1: 2,000 units * $500/unit = $1,000,000\nRoute 2: 4,000 units * $600/unit = $2,400,000\nRoute 3: 2,000 units * $700/unit = $1,400,000\n\nTotal cost = $1,000,000 + $2,400,000 + $1,400,000 = $4,800,000\n\nThe minimum cost for the company to transport all 8,000 units of the product from city A to city B using these routes is $4,800,000."
