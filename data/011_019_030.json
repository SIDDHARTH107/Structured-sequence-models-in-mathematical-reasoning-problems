    "message_2": "To determine the most significant factors that affect the output of the process using orthogonal arrays, we first need to calculate the effect of each factor. The effect of a factor is the difference between the average output when the factor is at its high level (level 2) and the average output when the factor is at its low level (level 1).\n\nLet's calculate the average output for each factor at both levels:\n\nFactor 1:\n- Level 1: (8+5+10+15+11+14+9+6)/8 = 9.5\n- Level 2: (14+7+12+9+4+13+8+11)/8 = 9.75\n\nFactor 2:\n- Level 1: (8+5+10+15+14+7+12+9)/8 = 10\n- Level 2: (11+14+9+6+4+13+8+11)/8 = 9.25\n\nFactor 3:\n- Level 1: (8+5+11+14+14+7+4+13)/8 = 9.5\n- Level 2: (10+15+9+6+12+9+8+11)/8 = 10\n\nFactor 4:\n- Level 1: (8+10+11+9+14+12+4+8)/8 = 9.5\n- Level 2: (5+15+14+6+7+9+13+11)/8 = 10\n\nFactor 5:\n- Level 1: (8+15+14+11+12+9+4+11)/8 = 10.5\n- Level 2: (5+10+11+6+7+9+13+8)/8 = 8.75\n\nNow, let's calculate the effect of each factor:\n\nEffect of Factor 1: |9.75 - 9.5| = 0.25\nEffect of Factor 2: |10 - 9.25| = 0.75\nEffect of Factor 3: |10 - 9.5| = 0.5\nEffect of Factor 4: |10 - 9.5| = 0.5\nEffect of Factor 5: |10.5 - 8.75| = 1.75\n\nBased on the calculated effects, Factor 5 has the most significant effect on the output of the process, followed by Factor 2. Factors 1, 3, and 4 have relatively smaller effects on the output."
