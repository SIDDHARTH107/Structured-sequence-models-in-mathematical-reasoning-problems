    "message_1": "A company produces two products: product A and product B. The company has a maximum of 200 hours of machine time available per day. Product A requires three hours of machine time and product B requires two hours of machine time. The company wants to maximize its profit by determining the number of units of each product to produce. The profit per unit of Product A is $10 and the profit per unit of Product B is $8. However, due to demand, the company must produce at least 10 units of Product A per day. How many units of each product should the company produce per day to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 200 (machine time constraint)\n2. x ≥ 10 (minimum production of Product A)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\nP(x, y) = 10x + 8y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region that satisfies the constraints. To do this, we'll graph the inequalities:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 200\ny ≤ (200 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. x ≥ 10\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. Now, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region, which are the points where the inequalities intersect.\n\nThe feasible region is bounded by the following points:\nA. (10, 0) - Intersection of x = 10 and y-axis\nB. (10, 95) - Intersection of x = 10 and y = (200 - 3x) / 2\nC. (40, 80) - Intersection of x-axis and y = (200 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\nP(A) = P(10, 0) = 10(10) + 8(0) = 100\nP(B) = P(10, 95) = 10(10) + 8(95) = 100 + 760 = 860\nP(C) = P(40, 80) = 10(40) + 8(80) = 400 + 640 = 1040\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point C, with a profit of $1040. Therefore, the company should produce 40 units of Product A and 80 units of Product B per day to maximize profit."
