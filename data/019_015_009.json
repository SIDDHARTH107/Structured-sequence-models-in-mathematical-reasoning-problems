    "message_1": "Let's say that there are 3 types of animals in a zoo: lions, tigers and bears. Each lion has 5 cubs, each tiger has 2 cubs and each bear has 3 cubs. If there are 7 lions, 5 tigers and 10 bears in the zoo, how many animal cubs are there in total?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of animal cubs in the zoo, we need to multiply the number of each type of animal by the number of cubs they have and then add those products together.\n\nFor lions: 7 lions * 5 cubs per lion = 35 lion cubs\nFor tigers: 5 tigers * 2 cubs per tiger = 10 tiger cubs\nFor bears: 10 bears * 3 cubs per bear = 30 bear cubs\n\nNow, add the number of cubs for each type of animal together:\n\n35 lion cubs + 10 tiger cubs + 30 bear cubs = 75 animal cubs in total."
