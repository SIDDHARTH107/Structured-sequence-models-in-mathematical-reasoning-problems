    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, we have a car traveling 200 miles in 4 hours. We can represent the distance traveled by the car as a function of time, say f(t), where t is the time in hours. We are given that the car travels 200 miles in 4 hours, so we have:\n\nf(4) - f(0) = 200\n\nWe want to find the average speed of the car during this time interval. The average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the time taken, which is:\n\nAverage speed = (f(4) - f(0)) / (4 - 0)\n\nSince f(4) - f(0) = 200, we have:\n\nAverage speed = 200 / 4\n\nAverage speed = 50 miles per hour\n\nSo, the average speed of the car during this time interval is 50 miles per hour."
