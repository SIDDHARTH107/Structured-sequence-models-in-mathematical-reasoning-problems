    "message_1": "Suppose that the average weight of all students in a college is 155 pounds, with a standard deviation of 10 pounds. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of the students, if a random sample of 25 students has a mean weight of 150 pounds.",
    "message_2": "To construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of the students, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% in this case), σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval. For a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96 (which can be found using a Z-table or a calculator).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nx̄ = 150 (mean weight of the sample)\nσ = 10 (standard deviation of the population)\nn = 25 (sample size)\n\nCI = 150 ± (1.96 * (10 / √25))\n\nCI = 150 ± (1.96 * (10 / 5))\n\nCI = 150 ± (1.96 * 2)\n\nCI = 150 ± 3.92\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of the students is (146.08, 153.92) pounds."
