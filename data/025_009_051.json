    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the moduli space of smooth plane cubic curves passing through exactly 5 given points in general position in the plane, we can use the following approach:\n\nA general plane cubic curve can be represented by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 in two variables, say x and y. The coefficients of this polynomial form a 10-dimensional vector space (since there are 10 monomials of degree 3 in x and y). \n\nNow, we have 5 given points in general position in the plane. For a cubic curve to pass through these points, it must satisfy the polynomial equation for each of these points. This gives us a system of 5 linear equations in the 10 coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nSince the points are in general position, the rank of the system of equations is 5. Therefore, the dimension of the space of cubic curves passing through these 5 points is 10 - 5 = 5.\n\nHowever, we are interested in the moduli space of smooth plane cubic curves, which means we need to exclude singular curves (curves with singular points, such as nodes or cusps). The condition for a curve to be smooth is that its partial derivatives with respect to x and y do not have a common zero (other than the trivial zero at infinity in the projective plane). This condition is an open condition, meaning that it does not change the dimension of the space.\n\nThus, the dimension of the moduli space of smooth plane cubic curves passing through exactly 5 given points in general position in the plane is 5."
