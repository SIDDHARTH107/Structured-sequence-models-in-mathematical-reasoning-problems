    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular polygon, we need to know the side length and the number of sides. We are given that the polygon has 8 sides of equal length, but we don't know the side length yet. However, we can use the given interior angle to find the side length using trigonometry.\n\nFirst, let's find the measure of the central angle of the polygon. The formula for the central angle of a regular polygon with n sides is:\n\nCentral angle = 360° / n\n\nFor our polygon with 8 sides:\n\nCentral angle = 360° / 8 = 45°\n\nNow, let's divide the polygon into 8 congruent isosceles triangles by drawing lines from the center of the polygon to each vertex. Each of these triangles will have a central angle of 45° and two base angles of 135°/2 = 67.5°.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the polygon as s, and the length from the center of the polygon to a vertex as r (the radius of the circumscribed circle). We can use the Law of Sines to find the relationship between s, r, and the angles of the isosceles triangle:\n\ns / sin(45°) = 2r / sin(67.5°)\n\nWe still need more information to find the exact value of s or r. Unfortunately, we cannot find the perimeter of the polygon without knowing either the side length (s) or the radius (r)."
