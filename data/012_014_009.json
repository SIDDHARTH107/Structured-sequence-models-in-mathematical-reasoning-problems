    "message_2": "To determine if the two graphs are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices such that the adjacency between the vertices is preserved.\n\nLet's analyze the degree sequence of each graph:\n\nGraph 1:\n- Degree of A: 3\n- Degree of B: 3\n- Degree of C: 2\n- Degree of D: 2\n- Degree of E: 3\n- Degree of F: 3\n\nGraph 2:\n- Degree of 1: 3\n- Degree of 2: 3\n- Degree of 3: 2\n- Degree of 4: 2\n- Degree of 5: 3\n- Degree of 6: 3\n\nThe degree sequences of both graphs are the same, which is a necessary condition for isomorphism. Now, let's try to find a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices:\n\n- A ↔ 1\n- B ↔ 2\n- C ↔ 3\n- D ↔ 4\n- E ↔ 5\n- F ↔ 6\n\nNow, let's check if the adjacency between the vertices is preserved:\n\n- A is adjacent to B, C, and F. 1 is adjacent to 2, 3, and 6.\n- B is adjacent to A, D, and E. 2 is adjacent to 1, 4, and 5.\n- C is adjacent to A and D. 3 is adjacent to 1 and 4.\n- D is adjacent to B and C. 4 is adjacent to 2 and 3.\n- E is adjacent to B and F. 5 is adjacent to 2 and 6.\n- F is adjacent to A and E. 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5.\n\nThe adjacency between the vertices is preserved, so the two graphs are isomorphic."
