    "message_2": "Let G be a group of prime order 13. By definition, the order of G is the number of elements in G, which is 13. Since 13 is a prime number, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Thus, the possible orders of elements in G are 1 and 13.\n\nNow, let's consider an element g in G such that g ≠ e, where e is the identity element of G. Since g ≠ e, the order of g cannot be 1. Therefore, the order of g must be 13.\n\nRecall that the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e. Since the order of g is 13, we have g^13 = e. This means that the set {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^12} contains all 13 distinct elements of G, as raising g to the 13th power returns the identity element e, and no smaller power of g can return e.\n\nThus, the set {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^12} forms a cyclic subgroup of G, generated by the element g. Since this cyclic subgroup has the same order as G, it must be equal to G. Therefore, G is a cyclic group, and g is a generator of G."
