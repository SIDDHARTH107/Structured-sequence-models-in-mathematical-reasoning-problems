Each supplier has a different price per unit, and the factory needs to figure out how much to purchase from each supplier to keep the costs as low as possible.\n- Supplier 1 charges $10 per unit\n- Supplier 2 charges $12 per unit\n- Supplier 3 charges $15 per unit\n- Supplier 4 charges $20 per unit\n\nIf the factory needs to purchase 1000 units of raw materials, what is the optimal amount to purchase from each supplier to minimize costs?",
    "message_2": "To minimize costs, the factory should purchase as many units as possible from the supplier with the lowest price per unit. In this case, that is Supplier 1, who charges $10 per unit. \n\nSince there are no constraints on how much each supplier can provide, the factory should purchase all 1000 units from Supplier 1. This will result in the lowest cost for the factory.\n\nSo, the optimal amount to purchase from each supplier is:\n- Supplier 1: 1000 units\n- Supplier 2: 0 units\n- Supplier 3: 0 units\n- Supplier 4: 0 units"
