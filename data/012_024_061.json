    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the inequality for non-planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for a connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, we need to check if the graph is planar or not. We can use the inequality for non-planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case, V = 12 and E = 22. Let's check if the inequality holds:\n\n22 ≤ 3(12) - 6\n22 ≤ 36 - 6\n22 ≤ 30\n\nThe inequality holds, so the graph might be planar. Now, let's use Euler's formula to find the number of faces:\n\nF = E - V + 2\nF = 22 - 12 + 2\nF = 10 + 2\nF = 12\n\nNow we can use the inequality for planar graphs to check if the graph is indeed planar:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n22 ≤ 3(12) - 6\n22 ≤ 36 - 6\n22 ≤ 30\n\nSince the inequality holds and we have found the number of faces, the graph is planar. Therefore, the genus of the graph is 0."
