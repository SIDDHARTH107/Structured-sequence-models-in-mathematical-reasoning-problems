    "message_1": "Suppose that a company has determined that its daily profit function is given by $P(x)= -0.02x^2 + 500x - 5000$ where $x$ is the number of units sold. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can make per day?\n\nWhat is the minimum number of units the company needs to sell to break even (i.e. when profit is zero)?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum profit, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by the profit function. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic function.\n\nIn this case, $a = -0.02$ and $b = 500$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$x = -\\frac{500}{2(-0.02)} = -\\frac{500}{-0.04} = 12500$\n\nNow, we can find the maximum profit by plugging this value of $x$ back into the profit function:\n\n$P(12500) = -0.02(12500)^2 + 500(12500) - 5000$\n\n$P(12500) = -0.02(156250000) + 6250000 - 5000$\n\n$P(12500) = -3125000 + 6250000 - 5000$\n\n$P(12500) = 3120000$\n\nSo, the maximum profit the company can make per day is $3,120,000.\n\nTo find the minimum number of units the company needs to sell to break even, we need to find the value of $x$ when the profit function is equal to zero:\n\n$0 = -0.02x^2 + 500x - 5000$\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, $a = -0.02$, $b = 500$, and $c = -5000$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{-500 \\pm \\sqrt{500^2 - 4(-0.02)(-5000)}}{2(-0.02)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{-500 \\pm \\sqrt{250000 - 400}}{-0.04}$\n\n$x = \\frac{-500 \\pm \\sqrt{249600}}{-0.04}$\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for $x$:\n\n$x_1 = \\frac{-500 + \\sqrt{249600}}{-0.04}$\n\n$x_2 = \\frac{-500 - \\sqrt{249600}}{-0.04}$\n\nCalculating these values:\n\n$x_1 = \\frac{-500 + 500}{-0.04} = 0$\n\n$x_2 = \\frac{-500 - 500}{-0.04} = 100$\n\nSince the company cannot sell a negative number of units, we can ignore the first solution. Therefore, the minimum number of units the company needs to sell to break even is 100 units."
