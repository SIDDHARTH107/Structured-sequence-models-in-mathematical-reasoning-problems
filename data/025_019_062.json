    "message_2": "A Fano variety is a smooth projective variety with ample anticanonical bundle. For a smooth hypersurface of dimension $n$ and degree $d$ in projective space $\\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$, the anticanonical bundle is given by $\\mathcal{O}(d-(n+2))$. In order for the hypersurface to be a Fano variety, the anticanonical bundle must be ample, which means $d-(n+2) > 0$. \n\nIn the example given, we have a smooth cubic hypersurface $X \\subseteq \\mathbb{P}^4$, so the dimension is $n=3$ and the degree is $d=3$. We can check if it is a Fano variety by calculating the anticanonical bundle:\n\n$\\mathcal{O}(d-(n+2)) = \\mathcal{O}(3-(3+2)) = \\mathcal{O}(-2)$\n\nSince the anticanonical bundle is not ample (it has a negative degree), the smooth cubic hypersurface $X \\subseteq \\mathbb{P}^4$ is not a Fano variety.\n\nIn general, for a smooth hypersurface of dimension $n$ and degree $d$ in projective space $\\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$ to be a Fano variety, we need $d > n+2$."
