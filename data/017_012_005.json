    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C16, D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16, we will use the Sylow theorems and the properties of p-groups.\n\nStep 1: Sylow theorems\nSince the order of G is 16, which is 2^4, G is a 2-group. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G, denoted by n_2, satisfies:\n\n1. n_2 divides the order of G, which is 16.\n2. n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n\nFrom these conditions, we have that n_2 can be 1 or 2. If n_2 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal. If n_2 = 2, then G has two Sylow 2-subgroups, and their intersection must also be normal.\n\nStep 2: Center of G\nLet Z(G) be the center of G. Since G is a p-group, we know that Z(G) is non-trivial (i.e., it has more than just the identity element). We have the following possibilities for the order of Z(G):\n\n1. |Z(G)| = 2: In this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 8, which is isomorphic to either C8 or D4. If G/Z(G) is isomorphic to C8, then G is isomorphic to C16. If G/Z(G) is isomorphic to D4, then G is isomorphic to D8.\n\n2. |Z(G)| = 4: In this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 4, which is isomorphic to C4. Since G is a 2-group, it must have a non-trivial center, so G is not isomorphic to C16 or D8. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16.\n\n3. |Z(G)| = 8: In this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 2, which is isomorphic to C2. Since G is a 2-group, it must have a non-trivial center, so G is not isomorphic to C16 or D8. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16.\n\n4. |Z(G)| = 16: In this case, G is abelian, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, or C2 × C2 × C2 × C2. Since G is a 2-group, it must have a non-trivial center, so G is not isomorphic to D8. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to C16 or the non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that G is isomorphic to either C16, D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16."
