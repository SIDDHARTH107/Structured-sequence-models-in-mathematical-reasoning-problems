    "message_2": "To find the outlier in the dataset, we can use the interquartile range (IQR) method. First, we need to arrange the data in ascending order and find the median, Q1 (the median of the lower half), and Q3 (the median of the upper half).\n\nSorted dataset: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26\n\nThere are 22 data points, so the median is the average of the 11th and 12th values: (15 + 16) / 2 = 15.5\n\nLower half: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\nUpper half: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26\n\nQ1 (median of the lower half) = 10\nQ3 (median of the upper half) = 22\n\nNow, we calculate the IQR:\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 22 - 10 = 12\n\nNext, we find the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\nLower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 10 - 1.5 * 12 = -8\nUpper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 22 + 1.5 * 12 = 40\n\nSince all the values in the dataset fall within the range of -8 to 40, there is no outlier in this dataset."
