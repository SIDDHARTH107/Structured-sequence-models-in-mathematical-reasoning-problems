    "message_2": "To find the number of lines that can be drawn on the algebraic variety X, we will use the Cayley-Salmon theorem. The theorem states that a smooth cubic surface in P^3 over the complex numbers contains exactly 27 lines.\n\nFirst, we need to check if X is a smooth cubic surface. The equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0 is homogeneous of degree 3, so X is a cubic surface. Now, we need to check if it is smooth. To do this, we compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂F/∂x = 3x^2\n∂F/∂y = 3y^2\n∂F/∂z = 3z^2\n\nThe surface X is smooth if the gradient (∇F) is nonzero for all points (x, y, z) on X. In other words, we need to check if there is any point (x, y, z) on X such that all three partial derivatives are zero. If x, y, and z are all zero, then the gradient is zero, but this point is not on X since x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0^3 + 0^3 + 0^3 ≠ 0. If any of x, y, or z is nonzero, then at least one of the partial derivatives is nonzero. Therefore, X is a smooth cubic surface.\n\nBy the Cayley-Salmon theorem, there are exactly 27 lines that can be drawn on the smooth cubic surface X in P^3 over the complex numbers."
