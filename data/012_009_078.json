    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 10 vertices and degree sequence (3,3,3,2,2,1,1,1,0,0). Can you draw a graph that satisfies this degree sequence? If yes, draw the graph. If not, explain why it is not possible.",
    "message_2": "It is not possible to draw a graph with the given degree sequence (3,3,3,2,2,1,1,1,0,0). Here's why:\n\nThe sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph must be even, as each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices. However, the sum of the given degree sequence is 3+3+3+2+2+1+1+1+0+0 = 16, which is not even. Therefore, it is not possible to draw a graph with this degree sequence."
