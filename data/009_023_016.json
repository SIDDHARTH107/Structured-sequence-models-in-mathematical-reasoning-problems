    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the inverse scattering transform (IST) method, which is a powerful technique for solving nonlinear partial differential equations like the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS). The IST method involves transforming the NLS into a linear eigenvalue problem, solving the linear problem, and then transforming back to obtain the solution of the NLS.\n\nFirst, we note that the given initial condition is a soliton solution of the NLS. A soliton is a localized wave that maintains its shape while propagating at a constant speed. The initial condition is given by:\n\n$$\\psi(x,0) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\mathrm{sech}(x)$$\n\nThe general soliton solution of the NLS can be written as:\n\n$$\\psi(x,t) = A\\mathrm{sech}\\left(\\sqrt{A}(x - x_0 - 4At)\\right)e^{i\\left(\\frac{A}{2}(x - x_0) - At^2\\right)}$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude, $x_0$ is the initial position, and $t$ is the time. Comparing this general soliton solution with the given initial condition, we can see that:\n\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad x_0 = 0$$\n\nSo the soliton solution corresponding to the initial condition is:\n\n$$\\psi(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\mathrm{sech}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x - 2t)\\right)e^{i\\left(\\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{1}{2}t^2\\right)}$$\n\nNow, we want to find the time when the maximum absolute value of the amplitude $|\\psi(x,t)|$ is attained. The absolute value of the amplitude is given by:\n\n$$|\\psi(x,t)| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\mathrm{sech}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x - 2t)\\right)$$\n\nTo find the maximum of this function, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}|\\psi(x,t)| = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\mathrm{sech}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x - 2t)\\right)\\tanh\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x - 2t)\\right)\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = 0$$\n\nThis equation is satisfied when the $\\tanh$ term is zero, which occurs when its argument is zero:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x - 2t) = 0$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$x = 2t$$\n\nSince the maximum absolute value of the amplitude occurs at $x = 2t$, we can substitute this back into the expression for $|\\psi(x,t)|$:\n\n$$|\\psi(2t,t)| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\mathrm{sech}(t)$$\n\nNow, we want to find the time when this function is maximized. Taking the derivative with respect to $t$ and setting it to zero:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}|\\psi(2t,t)| = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\mathrm{sech}(t)\\tanh(t) = 0$$\n\nThis equation is satisfied when the $\\tanh$ term is zero, which occurs when $t = 0$. Therefore, the maximum absolute value of the amplitude $|\\psi(x,t)|$ is attained at $t = 0$."
