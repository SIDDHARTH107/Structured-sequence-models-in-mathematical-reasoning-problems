    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A.\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)}\n\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A × B) and A. Since A consists of single elements and (A × B) consists of ordered pairs, their intersection is empty. Therefore, the symmetric difference is just the union of the two sets:\n\n(A × B) △ A = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), 1, 2, 3}\n\nSimilarly, the symmetric difference of (B × A) and A is:\n\n(B × A) △ A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), 1, 2, 3}\n\nNow, let's check if the Cartesian product is associative with respect to symmetric difference. If it were associative, we would have:\n\n(A × B) △ A = (B × A) △ A\n\nHowever, as we can see from the results above, this is not the case:\n\n{(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), 1, 2, 3} ≠ {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), 1, 2, 3}\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
