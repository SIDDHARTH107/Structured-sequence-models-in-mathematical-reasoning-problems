    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. A maximum independent set is an independent set of the largest possible size.\n\nIn the given graph, we can find a maximum independent set by selecting the following vertices: {A, D, F}. No two vertices in this set are adjacent, and there are no larger independent sets in the graph.\n\nSo, the maximum independent set in this graph is {A, D, F}."
