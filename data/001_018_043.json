    "message_2": "To solve the equation $\\log_2(x+8) - \\log_2(x+2) = 3$, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the quotient rule, which states that $\\log_b a - \\log_b c = \\log_b \\frac{a}{c}$.\n\nApplying the quotient rule, we get:\n\n$\\log_2 \\frac{x+8}{x+2} = 3$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\n$2^3 = \\frac{x+8}{x+2}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$8 = \\frac{x+8}{x+2}$\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$ by multiplying both sides by $(x+2)$:\n\n$8(x+2) = x+8$\n\nExpanding, we get:\n\n$8x + 16 = x + 8$\n\nSubtracting $x$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$7x + 16 = 8$\n\nSubtracting 16 from both sides, we get:\n\n$7x = -8$\n\nFinally, dividing by 7, we get:\n\n$x = -\\frac{8}{7}$"
