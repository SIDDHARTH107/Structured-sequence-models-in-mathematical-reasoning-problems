    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that increases in length as its order increases. To find the total length of the curve, we can use the following formula:\n\nLength of Hilbert curve = side length of square × 2^(n-1)\n\nIn this case, the side length of the square is 1. So, the formula becomes:\n\nLength of Hilbert curve = 1 × 2^(n-1)\n\nThus, the total length of the Hilbert curve of order n is 2^(n-1)."
