    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm and the lengths of its parallel sides are 12 cm and 16 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we first need to determine the lengths of the non-parallel sides. Let's call the non-parallel sides a and b.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of a and b. Since the height is perpendicular to both parallel sides, we can create two right triangles by drawing the height from one vertex of the shorter parallel side (12 cm) to the longer parallel side (16 cm). Let's call the length of the segment on the longer parallel side that is part of the right triangle x.\n\nNow, we have two right triangles: one with legs of length 8 cm and x, and the other with legs of length 8 cm and (16 - x). The hypotenuses of these right triangles are a and b, respectively.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for the first right triangle:\na^2 = 8^2 + x^2\n\nFor the second right triangle:\nb^2 = 8^2 + (16 - x)^2\n\nWe also know that the sum of the segments on the longer parallel side is equal to the length of the shorter parallel side:\nx + (16 - x) = 12\nx = 8\n\nNow we can find the lengths of a and b:\na^2 = 8^2 + 8^2 = 128\na = √128 ≈ 11.31 cm\n\nb^2 = 8^2 + (16 - 8)^2 = 128\nb = √128 ≈ 11.31 cm\n\nFinally, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding the lengths of all four sides:\nPerimeter = 12 cm + 16 cm + 11.31 cm + 11.31 cm ≈ 50.62 cm"
