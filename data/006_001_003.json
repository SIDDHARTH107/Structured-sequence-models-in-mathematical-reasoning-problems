    "message_1": "Suppose you have an honest coin, meaning that it has an equal chance of landing on either heads or tails when flipped. What is the probability of getting at least 3 heads in a row if you flip the coin 10 times?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least 3 heads in a row in 10 flips, we can use complementary probability. We will first find the probability of not getting 3 heads in a row and then subtract it from 1.\n\nLet's define a successful event as getting at least 3 heads in a row. The complementary event is not getting 3 heads in a row.\n\nWe can break down the complementary event into cases:\n\n1. No consecutive heads (HH) in the sequence.\n2. One pair of consecutive heads (HH) in the sequence, but no 3 consecutive heads (HHH).\n3. Two non-overlapping pairs of consecutive heads (HH) in the sequence, but no 3 consecutive heads (HHH).\n\nCase 1: No consecutive heads (HH) in the sequence\nThe sequence will look like this: THTHTHTHTH\nThere is only 1 way to arrange this sequence, so the probability is (1/2)^10 = 1/1024.\n\nCase 2: One pair of consecutive heads (HH) in the sequence, but no 3 consecutive heads (HHH)\nThe sequence will look like this: THHTHTHTHT\nThere are 4 possible positions for the pair of consecutive heads: (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), or (7,8).\nThe probability of each sequence is (1/2)^10 = 1/1024. Since there are 4 possible sequences, the total probability for this case is 4 * (1/1024) = 4/1024.\n\nCase 3: Two non-overlapping pairs of consecutive heads (HH) in the sequence, but no 3 consecutive heads (HHH)\nThe sequence will look like this: THHTHHTHTT\nThere are 3 possible positions for the pairs of consecutive heads: (1,2 and 5,6), (1,2 and 7,8), or (3,4 and 7,8).\nThe probability of each sequence is (1/2)^10 = 1/1024. Since there are 3 possible sequences, the total probability for this case is 3 * (1/1024) = 3/1024.\n\nNow, we sum up the probabilities of the complementary cases:\nP(complementary event) = 1/1024 + 4/1024 + 3/1024 = 8/1024\n\nFinally, we subtract the complementary probability from 1 to get the probability of the successful event:\nP(at least 3 heads in a row) = 1 - P(complementary event) = 1 - 8/1024 = 1016/1024 = 127/128.\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 3 heads in a row when flipping the coin 10 times is 127/128."
