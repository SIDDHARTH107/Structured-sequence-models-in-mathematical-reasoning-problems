    "message_2": "There are 51 distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 32. Among these, 45 are non-abelian. We will list some of the non-abelian groups and prove that they are non-isomorphic to each other and also not isomorphic to the cyclic group C32 or the dihedral group D16.\n\n1. The dihedral group D32: This group is generated by a rotation and a reflection, and has a presentation ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^(-1)⟩. It is non-abelian since the generators do not commute.\n\n2. The quaternion group Q32: This group is generated by two elements, i and j, with relations i^16 = j^4 = 1 and j^(-1)ij = i^(-1). It is non-abelian since the generators do not commute.\n\n3. The semi-dihedral group SD32: This group is generated by two elements, a and b, with relations a^16 = b^2 = 1 and b^(-1)ab = a^15. It is non-abelian since the generators do not commute.\n\nNow, let's prove that these three groups are non-isomorphic to each other and also not isomorphic to C32 or D16.\n\n- D32 vs. C32: D32 is non-abelian, while C32 is abelian, so they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n- D32 vs. D16: D32 has an element of order 16 (the rotation), while the maximum order of an element in D16 is 8, so they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n- D32 vs. Q32: D32 has an element of order 16, while the maximum order of an element in Q32 is 8, so they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n- D32 vs. SD32: D32 has a cyclic subgroup of order 16, while SD32 does not (it has a subgroup of order 16, but it is not cyclic), so they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n- Q32 vs. C32: Q32 is non-abelian, while C32 is abelian, so they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n- Q32 vs. D16: Q32 has an element of order 8, while the maximum order of an element in D16 is 4, so they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n- Q32 vs. SD32: Q32 has a center of order 4, while the center of SD32 has order 2, so they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n- SD32 vs. C32: SD32 is non-abelian, while C32 is abelian, so they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n- SD32 vs. D16: SD32 has a subgroup of order 16 that is not cyclic, while all subgroups of order 16 in D16 are cyclic, so they cannot be isomorphic.\n\nThus, we have shown that the three non-abelian groups listed (D32, Q32, and SD32) are non-isomorphic to each other and also not isomorphic to the cyclic group C32 or the dihedral group D16. There are 42 other non-abelian groups of order 32, but listing and proving their non-isomorphism is beyond the scope of this answer."
