    "message_1": "A student is standing 20 meters away from the base of a building. The angle of elevation from the student's eye line to the top of the building is 40 degrees. What is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 40 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (which we want to find), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the student to the base of the building, which is 20 meters.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(40°) = (height of the building) / 20 meters\n\nNow, we can find the tangent of 40 degrees:\n\ntan(40°) ≈ 0.8391\n\nNext, we can solve for the height of the building:\n\n0.8391 = (height of the building) / 20 meters\n\n(height of the building) = 0.8391 * 20 meters\n\n(height of the building) ≈ 16.782 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 16.782 meters."
