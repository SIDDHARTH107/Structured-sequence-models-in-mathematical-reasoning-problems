    "message_2": "The Rössler system is a system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations, given by:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nTo find the equilibrium points, we need to set the right-hand side of each equation to zero and solve for x, y, and z:\n\n-y - z = 0\nx + ay = 0\nb + z(x - c) = 0\n\nGiven the parameter values a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7, we can substitute them into the equations:\n\n-y - z = 0\nx + 0.2y = 0\n0.2 + z(x - 5.7) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve the system of equations. From the first equation, we have y = -z. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\nx - 0.2z = 0 => x = 0.2z\n\nNow, substitute x and y into the third equation:\n\n0.2 + (-z)(0.2z - 5.7) = 0\n\nExpanding and rearranging the equation, we get:\n\n0.04z^2 - 1.14z + 0.2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in z. To find the number of equilibrium points, we need to find the number of real solutions for z. We can do this by calculating the discriminant (Δ):\n\nΔ = b^2 - 4ac = (-1.14)^2 - 4(0.04)(0.2) = 1.2996 - 0.032 = 1.2676\n\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real solutions for z. Therefore, the maximum number of equilibrium points for the given Rössler system with the specified parameter values is 2."
