    "message_2": "The Henon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, often used to model the motion of stars in a galaxy. The system is described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\n$H = \\frac{1}{2}(p_x^2 + p_y^2) + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + \\alpha x^2 y - \\frac{\\beta}{3} y^3$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are parameters, and $(x, y, p_x, p_y)$ are the coordinates and momenta of the system.\n\nThe maximum Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions and is used to characterize the chaotic behavior of the system. Computing the maximum Lyapunov exponent for a specific system requires numerical simulations and is not a straightforward analytical calculation.\n\nFor the Henon-Heiles system with parameters $\\alpha=1$ and $\\beta=1.4$, the maximum Lyapunov exponent would need to be computed using numerical methods, such as the algorithm proposed by Benettin et al. (1980) or the method of Wolf et al. (1985). The specific value of the maximum Lyapunov exponent will depend on the initial conditions chosen for the simulation.\n\nIn summary, to find the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Henon-Heiles system with the given parameters, you would need to perform numerical simulations and analyze the results."
