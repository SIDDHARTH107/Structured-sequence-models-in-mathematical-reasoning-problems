    "message_2": "To find the potential at a distance of 3 cm from the center of the disk, we can use the formula for the potential due to a uniformly charged disk:\n\nV(r) = (σ / (2 * ε₀)) * (R - sqrt(R^2 - r^2))\n\nwhere V(r) is the potential at a distance r from the center of the disk, σ is the charge density, ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity (approximately 8.85 x 10^-12 C²/N·m²), R is the radius of the disk, and r is the distance from the center of the disk.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\nσ = 2 x 10^-9 C/m²\nR = 5 cm = 0.05 m\nr = 3 cm = 0.03 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nV(0.03) = (2 x 10^-9 / (2 * 8.85 x 10^-12)) * (0.05 - sqrt(0.05^2 - 0.03^2))\n\nV(0.03) = (2 x 10^-9 / (2 * 8.85 x 10^-12)) * (0.05 - sqrt(0.0025 - 0.0009))\n\nV(0.03) = (2 x 10^-9 / (2 * 8.85 x 10^-12)) * (0.05 - sqrt(0.0016))\n\nV(0.03) = (2 x 10^-9 / (2 * 8.85 x 10^-12)) * (0.05 - 0.04)\n\nV(0.03) = (2 x 10^-9 / (2 * 8.85 x 10^-12)) * 0.01\n\nV(0.03) = (1 x 10^-9 / 8.85 x 10^-12) * 0.01\n\nV(0.03) ≈ 113.0 V\n\nSo, the potential at a distance of 3 cm from the center of the disk is approximately 113.0 V."
