    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of set A and set B is a subset of set A and set B individually, we need to show that every element in the intersection of A and B is also an element of A and an element of B.\n\nLet's first find the intersection of set A and set B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nBy comparing the elements in set A and set B, we can see that the common elements are 6 and 9. Therefore, the intersection of set A and set B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {6, 9}\n\nNow, we need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and an element of B.\n\n1. For set A:\n\nLet x be an element in A ∩ B. Then x is either 6 or 9. Since both 6 and 9 are elements of set A, we can conclude that x ∈ A. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of set A.\n\n2. For set B:\n\nSimilarly, let x be an element in A ∩ B. Then x is either 6 or 9. Since both 6 and 9 are elements of set B, we can conclude that x ∈ B. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of set B.\n\nIn conclusion, we have proven that the intersection of set A and set B, A ∩ B, is a subset of set A and set B individually."
