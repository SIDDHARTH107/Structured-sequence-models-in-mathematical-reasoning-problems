    "message_1": "Let U be a universal set with 100 elements, and let A be a subset of U with 40 elements. What is the cardinality of the union of A and its complement?",
    "message_2": "The complement of a set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. Since U has 100 elements and A has 40 elements, the complement of A (A') has 60 elements (100 - 40 = 60).\n\nThe union of A and its complement A' contains all the elements that are in either A or A' or both. Since A and A' are disjoint sets (they have no elements in common), the union of A and A' will contain all the elements in the universal set U.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the union of A and its complement A' is equal to the number of elements in the universal set U, which is 100."
