    "message_2": "To find the probability that at most one light bulb in a batch of 200 will fail before 1000 hours, we first need to find the average number of failures for a batch of 200 bulbs. Since the average number of failures is 2.5 per 1000 bulbs, we can find the average for 200 bulbs by:\n\n(2.5 failures / 1000 bulbs) * 200 bulbs = 0.5 failures\n\nNow, we can use the Poisson distribution formula to find the probability of 0 and 1 failure(s) in a batch of 200 bulbs:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nWhere λ is the average number of failures (0.5), x is the number of failures we are interested in (0 and 1), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nFor 0 failures:\n\nP(0) = (e^(-0.5) * 0.5^0) / 0! = (0.60653 * 1) / 1 = 0.60653\n\nFor 1 failure:\n\nP(1) = (e^(-0.5) * 0.5^1) / 1! = (0.60653 * 0.5) / 1 = 0.30327\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at most one failure by adding the probabilities of 0 and 1 failure(s):\n\nP(at most 1 failure) = P(0) + P(1) = 0.60653 + 0.30327 = 0.9098\n\nSo, the probability that at most one light bulb in a batch of 200 will fail before 1000 hours is approximately 0.9098 or 90.98%."
