    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products: Product A and Product B. The manufacturing process for both products involves using machines and labor. The total availability of machines is 18 hours and total availability of labor is 48 hours. Each unit of Product A requires 3 hours of machines and 6 hours of labor while each unit of Product B requires 6 hours of machines and 3 hours of labor. The profit per unit of Product A is $8 and the profit per unit of Product B is $10. Determine the number of units of each product the company has to manufacture to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the problem are:\n\n1. Machine hours: 3x + 6y ≤ 18\n2. Labor hours: 6x + 3y ≤ 48\n3. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function: P(x, y) = 8x + 10y\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\n1. y ≤ (18 - 3x) / 6\n2. y ≤ (48 - 6x) / 3\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of constraint 1 and x-axis (y = 0): 3x + 6(0) = 18 => x = 6\n   Point: (6, 0)\n\n2. Intersection of constraint 2 and x-axis (y = 0): 6x + 3(0) = 48 => x = 8\n   Point: (8, 0)\n\n3. Intersection of constraint 1 and constraint 2:\n   3x + 6y = 18\n   6x + 3y = 48\n   Multiply the first equation by 2: 6x + 12y = 36\n   Subtract the second equation from the first: 9y = -12 => y = -4/3 (not feasible since y ≥ 0)\n\n4. Intersection of constraint 2 and y-axis (x = 0): 6(0) + 3y = 48 => y = 16\n   Point: (0, 16)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of the corner points:\n\n1. P(6, 0) = 8(6) + 10(0) = 48\n2. P(8, 0) = 8(8) + 10(0) = 64\n3. P(0, 16) = 8(0) + 10(16) = 160\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at point (0, 16), which means the company should manufacture 0 units of Product A and 16 units of Product B to maximize their profit."
