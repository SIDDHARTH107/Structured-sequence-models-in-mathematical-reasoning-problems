    "message_2": "To solve the equation |2x + 1| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x + 1 is positive or zero.\nIn this case, we can simply remove the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n2x + 1 = 7\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n2x = 6\nDivide by 2:\nx = 3\n\nCase 2: 2x + 1 is negative.\nIn this case, we need to negate the expression inside the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n-(2x + 1) = 7\nDistribute the negative sign:\n-2x - 1 = 7\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n-2x = 8\nDivide by -2:\nx = -4\n\nSo, the two solutions for x are x = 3 and x = -4."
