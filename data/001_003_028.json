    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we want to make the coefficients of either x or y the same in both equations so that we can eliminate one of the variables. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2:\n\n(2x + 3y = 7) * 2\n\n4x + 6y = 14\n\nNow we have:\n\n4x + 6y = 14\n4x - y = 11\n\nNext, we will subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x - y) = 14 - 11\n\n4x + 6y - 4x + y = 3\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n6y + y = 3\n7y = 3\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 3/7\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for x. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n2x + 3(3/7) = 7\n\nMultiply 3 by 3/7:\n\n2x + 9/7 = 7\n\nTo get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 7:\n\n7(2x + 9/7) = 7 * 7\n\n14x + 9 = 49\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n14x = 49 - 9\n14x = 40\n\nx = 40/14\nx = 20/7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 20/7\ny = 3/7"
