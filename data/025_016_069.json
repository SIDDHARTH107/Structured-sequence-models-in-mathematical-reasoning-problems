    "message_2": "To determine if the given curve is birationally equivalent to a line, we will try to find a birational map between the curve and a line. Let the curve be C: x^3 + y^3 - 3x - 3y = 0. We will attempt to find a rational parametrization of the curve.\n\nLet x = at and y = bt for some constants a and b, and a non-zero parameter t. Substituting these into the equation of the curve, we get:\n\n(at)^3 + (bt)^3 - 3(at) - 3(bt) = 0\na^3t^3 + b^3t^3 - 3at - 3bt = 0\n\nNow, we want to eliminate t from the equation. We can do this by factoring:\n\nt^3(a^3 + b^3) - 3t(a + b) = 0\nt(t^2(a^3 + b^3) - 3(a + b)) = 0\n\nSince t is non-zero, we can divide both sides by t:\n\nt^2(a^3 + b^3) - 3(a + b) = 0\n\nNow, we want to find a and b such that this equation holds for all values of t. One way to do this is to set the coefficients of the powers of t equal to zero:\n\na^3 + b^3 = 0\na + b = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, we have b = -a. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\na^3 - a^3 = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied for all values of a. So, we can choose any non-zero value for a, and b will be its negative. For example, let a = 1, then b = -1. Thus, we have the rational parametrization:\n\nx = t\ny = -t\n\nThis parametrization establishes a birational map between the curve C and the line L: y = -x. Therefore, the curve x^3 + y^3 - 3x - 3y = 0 is birationally equivalent to a line."
