    "message_1": "A tree casts a shadow that is 20 feet long at the same time an 8-foot tall person standing next to the tree casts a shadow that is 4 feet long. How tall is the tree?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the concept of similar triangles. Since the tree and the person are both casting shadows at the same time, we can assume that the angles of elevation of the sun are the same for both. Therefore, we can set up a proportion:\n\n(tree height) / (tree shadow length) = (person height) / (person shadow length)\n\nLet x represent the height of the tree. Then the proportion becomes:\n\nx / 20 = 8 / 4\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n4x = 160\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\nx = 40\n\nSo, the tree is 40 feet tall."
