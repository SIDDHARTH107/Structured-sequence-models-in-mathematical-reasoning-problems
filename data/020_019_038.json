    "message_1": "Here's a problem for an optimal control student to solve:\n\nA rocket is launched from the ground, and its speed at any time is controlled by a propulsion system. The rocket must travel a distance of 2000 meters in the least amount of time possible. There is a limit to the amount of fuel that can be used, however, and the propulsion system must operate within the limits of 0 to 100 Newtons of force. Determine the control function that will minimize the time it takes for the rocket to travel the 2000 meter distance while respecting the fuel limit and the propulsive force of up to 100 Newtons.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. Let's denote the position of the rocket as x(t), its velocity as v(t), and the control force as u(t). The state variables are x(t) and v(t), and the control variable is u(t). The dynamics of the system can be described by the following equations:\n\ndx/dt = v(t)\ndv/dt = u(t)/m\n\nwhere m is the mass of the rocket.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the time T required to reach the target distance x(T) = 2000 meters. We will define the Hamiltonian H as:\n\nH(x, v, u, λ_x, λ_v) = 1 + λ_x*v + λ_v*(u/m)\n\nwhere λ_x and λ_v are the costate variables associated with x and v, respectively.\n\nAccording to Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the optimal control u*(t) minimizes the Hamiltonian:\n\n∂H/∂u = 0\n\nSolving for u*(t), we get:\n\nu*(t) = -m*λ_v\n\nSince the control force is limited to the range [0, 100] N, we have:\n\n0 ≤ u*(t) ≤ 100\n\nNow, we need to find the costate equations:\n\ndλ_x/dt = -∂H/∂x = 0\ndλ_v/dt = -∂H/∂v = -λ_x\n\nIntegrating the costate equations, we get:\n\nλ_x(t) = constant\nλ_v(t) = -λ_x*t + constant\n\nSubstituting λ_v(t) into the expression for u*(t):\n\nu*(t) = m*(λ_x*t - constant)\n\nSince u*(t) is limited to [0, 100] N, we can determine the switching times when the control force changes its value. The optimal control function u*(t) will be a bang-bang control, meaning that it will switch between the minimum and maximum force values.\n\nTo find the specific control function u*(t) and the minimum time T, we need to consider the boundary conditions:\n\nx(0) = 0\nv(0) = 0\nx(T) = 2000\n\nSolving these equations along with the dynamics and the optimal control function will provide the control function u*(t) that minimizes the time to reach the target distance of 2000 meters while respecting the fuel limit and the propulsive force of up to 100 Newtons."
