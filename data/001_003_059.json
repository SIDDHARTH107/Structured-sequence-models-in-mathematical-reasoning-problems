    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the elimination method, we need to eliminate one of the variables by adding or subtracting the equations. In this case, we can eliminate the variable y by multiplying the second equation by 2 and then adding the two equations.\n\nFirst, multiply the second equation by 2:\n\n(2x - y) * 2 = 4x - 2y = 10\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n3x + 2y + 4x - 2y = 14 + 10\n7x = 24\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 24 / 7\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of y. Let's use the second equation:\n\n2x - y = 5\n2(24/7) - y = 5\n48/7 - y = 5\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\n-y = 5 - 48/7\ny = 48/7 - 5\ny = (48 - 35) / 7\ny = 13/7\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is x = 24/7 and y = 13/7."
