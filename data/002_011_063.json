    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg with a length of 3 cm and the other leg with a length of 4 cm. Calculate the length of the hypotenuse.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In equation form, this is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nIn this problem, one leg (a) has a length of 3 cm and the other leg (b) has a length of 4 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nc² = 3² + 4²\nc² = 9 + 16\nc² = 25\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\nc = √25\nc = 5\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 5 cm."
