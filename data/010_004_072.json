Prove that there exists a continuous function F: X -> R which extends f, that is F(x) = f(x) for all x in A. Furthermore, show that if g: X -> R is any continuous function which agrees with f on A, then F = g.",
    "message_2": "To prove the existence of a continuous function F: X -> R that extends f, we will use the Tietze extension theorem. The Tietze extension theorem states that if X is a normal topological space (which includes compact metric spaces) and A is a closed subset of X, then for any continuous function f: A -> R, there exists a continuous function F: X -> R such that F(x) = f(x) for all x in A.\n\nSince X is a compact metric space, it is also a normal topological space. A is a closed subset of X, and f: A -> R is continuous. Therefore, by the Tietze extension theorem, there exists a continuous function F: X -> R such that F(x) = f(x) for all x in A.\n\nNow, let g: X -> R be any continuous function which agrees with f on A. We want to show that F = g. To prove this, we will show that F(x) = g(x) for all x in X.\n\nLet x be an arbitrary point in X. If x is in A, then by definition, F(x) = f(x) and g(x) = f(x) since g agrees with f on A. Therefore, F(x) = g(x) for all x in A.\n\nIf x is not in A, consider the set B = X \\ A, which is the complement of A in X. Since A is closed, B is open. Since F and g are continuous, F(B) and g(B) are open subsets of R. Since F and g agree on A, they must also agree on the boundary of B, which is A. Therefore, F and g must agree on the closure of B, which is X. Thus, F(x) = g(x) for all x in X.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that there exists a continuous function F: X -> R which extends f, and if g: X -> R is any continuous function which agrees with f on A, then F = g."
