    "message_1": "A player is given $10 to divide between himself/herself and another person in a Dictator Game. If the other person accepts the offer, both players keep the money. If the other person rejects the offer, neither player gets any money. What offer would maximize the probability that the other person accepts the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, the player making the offer should consider the other person's preferences and expectations to maximize the probability of acceptance. Since people generally prefer to receive more money, offering an equal or near-equal split would likely increase the chances of acceptance.\n\nTherefore, offering $5 to the other person and keeping $5 for oneself would be a fair split and likely maximize the probability that the other person accepts the offer. However, the exact amount may vary depending on the specific preferences and expectations of the other person involved in the game."
