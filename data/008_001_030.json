    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 2 -1  3 | 11 ]\n[ 2  5 -1 |  1 ]\n```\n\nNext, we will use Gaussian elimination to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row and the third row to eliminate the x-coefficient in the second and third rows:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0 -3  1 | -1 ]\n[ 0  3 -3 | -11 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Multiply the second row by -1/3 to make the y-coefficient in the second row equal to 1:\n\n```\n[ 1  1  1 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 | 1/3 ]\n[ 0  3 -3 | -11 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Subtract 3 times the second row from the third row to eliminate the y-coefficient in the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1   1  |  6  ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 | 1/3 ]\n[ 0  0  -8/3 | -10 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Multiply the third row by -3/8 to make the z-coefficient in the third row equal to 1:\n\n```\n[ 1  1   1  |  6  ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 | 1/3 ]\n[ 0  0   1  | 15/8 ]\n```\n\nNow we have the row-echelon form of the matrix, and we can use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nStep 5: Substitute the value of z from the third row into the second row and the first row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1   0  | 33/8 ]\n[ 0  1   0  | 17/8 ]\n[ 0  0   1  | 15/8 ]\n```\n\nStep 6: Substitute the value of y from the second row into the first row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0   0  | 16/8 ]\n[ 0  1   0  | 17/8 ]\n[ 0  0   1  | 15/8 ]\n```\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 16/8 = 2\ny = 17/8\nz = 15/8"
