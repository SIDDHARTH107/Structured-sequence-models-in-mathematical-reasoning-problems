    "message_2": "We will use the principle of mathematical induction to prove this statement.\n\nBase case (n = 1):\nWhen n = 1, n^2 + n = 1^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is even.\n\nInductive step:\nAssume that the statement is true for some natural number k, i.e., k^2 + k is even.\nWe need to prove that the statement is true for k + 1, i.e., (k + 1)^2 + (k + 1) is even.\n\nNow, let's expand (k + 1)^2 + (k + 1):\n(k + 1)^2 + (k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 + k + 1 = (k^2 + k) + 2(k + 1)\n\nBy the inductive hypothesis, we know that k^2 + k is even. Let's say k^2 + k = 2m, where m is an integer.\nThen, (k^2 + k) + 2(k + 1) = 2m + 2(k + 1) = 2(m + k + 1)\n\nSince m + k + 1 is an integer, we can conclude that (k^2 + k) + 2(k + 1) is even.\n\nThus, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n, i.e., n^2 + n is even."
