    "message_2": "To determine if $f(x)$ is a smooth function on $(-1, 1)$, we need to check if it is infinitely differentiable on this interval. Let's find the first few derivatives of $f(x)$ and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nFirst, we have $f(x) = \\frac{x^3}{1 - x^2}$. \n\nNow, let's find the first derivative, $f'(x)$, using the quotient rule: \n\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{(1 - x^2)(3x^2) - x^3(-2x)}{(1 - x^2)^2} = \\frac{3x^2 - 3x^4 + 2x^5}{(1 - x^2)^2}.$$\n\nNext, let's find the second derivative, $f''(x)$, using the quotient rule again:\n\n$$f''(x) = \\frac{(1 - x^2)^2(6x - 12x^3 + 10x^4) - (3x^2 - 3x^4 + 2x^5)(-4x(1 - x^2) + 4x^3)}{(1 - x^2)^4}.$$\n\nAt this point, it is clear that the derivatives are becoming more complicated and it is not easy to find a pattern. However, we can still analyze the smoothness of the function by considering the behavior of the function and its derivatives near the endpoints of the interval $(-1, 1)$.\n\nAs $x$ approaches $-1$ or $1$, the denominator of $f(x)$ approaches $0$. This means that $f(x)$ becomes unbounded (i.e., goes to infinity) near these points. However, this does not necessarily imply that the function is not smooth, as we need to consider the behavior of the derivatives as well.\n\nWhen we differentiate $f(x)$, the denominator of each derivative will have a factor of $(1 - x^2)^n$ for some positive integer $n$. As $x$ approaches $-1$ or $1$, the denominator of each derivative will also approach $0$, causing the derivatives to become unbounded as well. This means that the function and its derivatives are not continuous at the endpoints of the interval $(-1, 1)$.\n\nSince the function and its derivatives are not continuous at the endpoints of the interval $(-1, 1)$, we can conclude that $f(x)$ is not a smooth function on this interval."
