    "message_1": "A store sells two types of products: Product A and Product B. The sales of Product A on a given day can either be \"Good\" or \"Poor,\" while the sales of Product B can either be \"Good,\" \"Fair,\" or \"Poor.\" The following table shows the probability of each possible outcome for each product.\n\n|     | Good | Fair | Poor |\n| --- | ---  | ---  | ---  |\n| A   | 0.6  | 0.4  | 0    |\n| B   | 0.3  | 0.4  | 0.3  |\n\nSuppose that the sales on each day depend only on the sales made on the previous day. If the sales of Product A were \"Good\" on one day, what is the probability that the sales of Product B will be \"Fair\" on the next day?",
    "message_2": "The problem statement does not provide enough information to determine the probability of Product B's sales being \"Fair\" on the next day based on Product A's sales being \"Good\" on one day. We would need information about the relationship between the sales of Product A and Product B to answer this question."
