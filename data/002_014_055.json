    "message_1": "What is the surface area of a rectangular prism with a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 4 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to calculate the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: three pairs of opposite faces.\n\n1. The area of the two faces with dimensions length x width: 2 * (8 cm * 6 cm) = 2 * (48 cm²) = 96 cm²\n2. The area of the two faces with dimensions length x height: 2 * (8 cm * 4 cm) = 2 * (32 cm²) = 64 cm²\n3. The area of the two faces with dimensions width x height: 2 * (6 cm * 4 cm) = 2 * (24 cm²) = 48 cm²\n\nNow, add the areas of all the faces together:\n\n96 cm² + 64 cm² + 48 cm² = 208 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 208 cm²."
