    "message_2": "Let's first understand the action of $S^1$ on $S^2$. The circle $S^1$ acts on the sphere $S^2$ by rotating it around an axis passing through the north and south poles. This action is free and continuous. We can think of this action as identifying each pair of antipodal points on the equator of the sphere. \n\nNow, let's consider the quotient space $X = S^2/S^1$. Since the action of $S^1$ is free and continuous, we can apply the orbit space theorem, which states that the quotient space $X$ is a manifold and the projection map $\\pi: S^2 \\to X$ is a covering map. \n\nTo find the fundamental group of $X$, we can use the following fact: if $p: \\tilde{X} \\to X$ is a covering map and $\\tilde{X}$ is simply connected, then the fundamental group of $X$ is isomorphic to the group of deck transformations of the covering map. In our case, $\\tilde{X} = S^2$ is simply connected, and the group of deck transformations is isomorphic to the group $S^1$ acting on $S^2$. \n\nSince $S^1$ is homeomorphic to the circle group $\\mathbb{Z}$, we have that the fundamental group of the quotient space $X$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, the fundamental group of $X = S^2/S^1$ is $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
