    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the quotient rule, which states that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). Applying this rule to the given equation, we get:\n\nlog3((x+4)/(x-2)) = 2\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if log_b(c) = d, then b^d = c. In this case, we have:\n\n3^2 = (x+4)/(x-2)\n\n9 = (x+4)/(x-2)\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides by (x-2):\n\n9(x-2) = x+4\n\n9x - 18 = x + 4\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n8x - 18 = 4\n\nAdd 18 to both sides:\n\n8x = 22\n\nFinally, divide by 8:\n\nx = 22/8\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nx = 11/4\n\nSo the solution is x = 11/4."
