    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 4:\n\n4x + 3y + z = 10 (1)\n4x - 2y + 10z = -4 (2)\n-4x + 8y + 12z = 0 (3)\n\nNow, we will add equations (2) and (3) to eliminate x:\n\n(4x - 2y + 10z) + (-4x + 8y + 12z) = -4 + 0\n6y + 22z = -4 (4)\n\nNext, we will eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, we will add equations (1) and (3):\n\n(4x + 3y + z) + (-4x + 8y + 12z) = 10 + 0\n11y + 13z = 10 (5)\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables:\n\n6y + 22z = -4 (4)\n11y + 13z = 10 (5)\n\nWe will eliminate y from these two equations. To do this, we will multiply equation (4) by 11 and equation (5) by 6:\n\n66y + 242z = -44 (6)\n66y + 78z = 60 (7)\n\nNow, we will subtract equation (7) from equation (6) to eliminate y:\n\n(66y + 242z) - (66y + 78z) = -44 - 60\n164z = -104\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\nz = -104 / 164\nz = -2/3\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into equations (4) and (5) to find the value of y:\n\n6y + 22(-2/3) = -4\n6y - 44/3 = -4\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n18y - 44 = -12\n\nAdd 44 to both sides:\n\n18y = 32\n\nNow, divide by 18:\n\ny = 32 / 18\ny = 16/9\n\nNow that we have the values of y and z, we can substitute them back into equation (1) to find the value of x:\n\n4x + 3(16/9) - 2/3 = 10\n\nMultiply both sides by 9 to get rid of the fractions:\n\n36x + 48 - 6 = 90\n\nSubtract 48 and 6 from both sides:\n\n36x = 48\n\nNow, divide by 36:\n\nx = 48 / 36\nx = 4/3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 4/3, y = 16/9, z = -2/3"
