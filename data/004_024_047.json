    "message_2": "To find the value of dy/dx, we will first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, using the chain rule when necessary.\n\nThe chain rule states that if we have a composite function, say g(f(x)), then the derivative of this function with respect to x is given by:\n\nd(g(f(x)))/dx = g'(f(x)) * f'(x)\n\nNow, let's differentiate both sides of the given equation with respect to x:\n\nd/dx [(x^2 + y^2)^2] = d/dx [25x^2 + 25y^2]\n\nApplying the chain rule to the left side:\n\n2(x^2 + y^2) * d/dx [x^2 + y^2] = 50x + 50y * dy/dx\n\nNow, differentiate x^2 + y^2 with respect to x:\n\nd/dx [x^2 + y^2] = 2x + 2y * dy/dx\n\nSubstitute this back into the equation:\n\n2(x^2 + y^2) * (2x + 2y * dy/dx) = 50x + 50y * dy/dx\n\nNow, we need to find dy/dx at the point (3, 4). Substitute x = 3 and y = 4 into the equation:\n\n2(3^2 + 4^2) * (2(3) + 2(4) * dy/dx) = 50(3) + 50(4) * dy/dx\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(9 + 16) * (6 + 8 * dy/dx) = 150 + 200 * dy/dx\n\n50 * (6 + 8 * dy/dx) = 150 + 200 * dy/dx\n\nNow, solve for dy/dx:\n\n300 + 400 * dy/dx = 150 + 200 * dy/dx\n\n200 * dy/dx = -150\n\ndy/dx = -150 / 200\n\ndy/dx = -3/4\n\nSo, the value of dy/dx at the point (3, 4) is -3/4."
