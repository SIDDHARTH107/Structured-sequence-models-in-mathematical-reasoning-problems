    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of experiencing a drought in a certain region is 0.2 in any given year. What is the probability that the region will experience a drought at least once in a three-year period?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can first find the probability that the region will not experience a drought in the three-year period, and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability of experiencing a drought at least once.\n\nThe probability of not experiencing a drought in any given year is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nFor the region to not experience a drought in all three years, the probability is 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of experiencing a drought at least once in the three-year period:\n\n1 - 0.512 = 0.488.\n\nSo, the probability of experiencing a drought at least once in a three-year period is 0.488 or 48.8%."
