    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface S at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet the surface S be parametrized by the vector function r(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2). Then, we can find the first fundamental form by computing the partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = (1, 0, 2u) • (1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = (1, 0, 2u) • (0, 1, 2v) = 4uv\nG = r_v • r_v = (0, 1, 2v) • (0, 1, 2v) = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNext, we need to find the second fundamental form. To do this, we first compute the unit normal vector N:\n\nN = (r_u × r_v) / |r_u × r_v|\n\nr_u × r_v = (2u, -2v, 1)\n|r_u × r_v| = √((2u)^2 + (-2v)^2 + 1^2) = √(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nN = (2u, -2v, 1) / √(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = N • r_uu = (2u, -2v, 1) • (0, 0, 2) = 2\nM = N • r_uv = (2u, -2v, 1) • (0, 0, 0) = 0\nN = N • r_vv = (2u, -2v, 1) • (0, 0, 2) = 2\n\nFinally, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nL = 2\nM = 0\nN = 2\n\nK = (2 * 2 - 0^2) / (5 * 5 - 4^2) = 4 / 9\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface S at the point (1, 1, 2) is K = 4/9."
