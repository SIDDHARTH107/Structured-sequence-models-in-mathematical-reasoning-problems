    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all such automorphisms, along with the operation of composition.\n\nLet's label the vertices of the given graph as follows:\n\n```\n  A   B\n   \\ /\n    C\n   / \\\n  D   E\n```\n\nNow, let's find the automorphisms of this graph:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself: (A)(B)(C)(D)(E).\n2. The automorphism that swaps vertices A and B, and also swaps vertices D and E: (AB)(DE).\n3. The automorphism that swaps vertices A and E, and also swaps vertices B and D: (AE)(BD).\n4. The automorphism that swaps vertices A and D, and also swaps vertices B and E: (AD)(BE).\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms of the given graph, as any other permutation of vertices would not preserve adjacency. Therefore, the automorphism group of this graph is:\n\n{ (A)(B)(C)(D)(E), (AB)(DE), (AE)(BD), (AD)(BE) }\n\nThis group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, which has the structure V ≅ Z_2 × Z_2, where Z_2 is the cyclic group of order 2."
