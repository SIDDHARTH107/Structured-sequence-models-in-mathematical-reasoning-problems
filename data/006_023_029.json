    "message_1": "Suppose that in a certain market, 40% of the consumers prefer product A, 30% prefer product B and 30% prefer product C. If a random sample of 50 consumers is taken from this market, what is the probability that at least 20 consumers prefer product A?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a consumer preferring product A)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of consumers in the sample)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of consumers who prefer product A)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 20 consumers prefer product A, which means we need to find the sum of probabilities for 20, 21, 22, ..., 50 consumers preferring product A.\n\nSo, we need to calculate:\n\nP(X >= 20) = P(X = 20) + P(X = 21) + ... + P(X = 50)\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n- n = 50 (number of consumers in the sample)\n- p = 0.4 (probability of a consumer preferring product A)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k from 20 to 50 and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 20) = Σ [C(50, k) * (0.4)^k * (0.6)^(50-k)] for k = 20 to 50\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 20) ≈ 0.959\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 consumers prefer product A in a random sample of 50 consumers is approximately 0.959 or 95.9%."
