    "message_2": "To determine the genus of a graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the inequality for non-planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, since we are trying to find the genus of the graph, we need to consider the inequality for non-planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 12\n\nwhere g is the genus of the graph.\n\nGiven that G has 15 vertices (V = 15) and 24 edges (E = 24), we can plug these values into the inequality:\n\n24 ≤ 3(15) + 6g - 12\n\nSolving for g, we get:\n\n24 ≤ 45 + 6g - 12\n12 ≤ 6g\n2 ≤ g\n\nSince the genus must be an integer, the minimum value for g is 2. Therefore, the genus of the graph G is 2."
