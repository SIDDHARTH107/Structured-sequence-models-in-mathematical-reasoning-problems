    "message_2": "To prove that the closure of A, denoted by $\\bar A$, is equal to the intersection of all closed sets containing A, we will show that $\\bar A$ is a closed set containing A and that it is a subset of every closed set containing A.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of the closure of a set A in a metric space (X, d):\n\n$\\bar A = A \\cup A'$, where A' is the set of all limit points of A.\n\nNow, let's show that $\\bar A$ is a closed set. To do this, we need to show that the complement of $\\bar A$ in X is open. Let $x \\in X \\setminus \\bar A$. Then, $x \\notin A$ and $x \\notin A'$. Since $x \\notin A'$, there exists a positive real number $\\epsilon > 0$ such that the open ball $B(x, \\epsilon)$ contains no points of A. Therefore, $B(x, \\epsilon) \\subseteq X \\setminus \\bar A$. This shows that $X \\setminus \\bar A$ is open, and hence, $\\bar A$ is closed.\n\nNext, we show that $\\bar A$ contains A. By definition, $\\bar A = A \\cup A'$, so A is a subset of $\\bar A$.\n\nNow, we need to show that $\\bar A$ is a subset of every closed set containing A. Let F be a closed set containing A. Since F is closed, it contains all its limit points. Therefore, F contains A'. Thus, F contains both A and A', so F contains $\\bar A$. This shows that $\\bar A$ is a subset of every closed set containing A.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $\\bar A$ is a closed set containing A and that it is a subset of every closed set containing A. Hence, the closure of A, $\\bar A$, is equal to the intersection of all closed sets containing A.\n\nNow, let's find the closure of A in the metric space (Z, ρ) with A being the set of all z in Z such that ρ(z, 0) < 1.\n\nThe closure of A, $\\bar A$, is the union of A and the set of all limit points of A. Since A is the set of all z in Z such that ρ(z, 0) < 1, the limit points of A are the points z in Z such that ρ(z, 0) = 1. This is because for any point z with ρ(z, 0) = 1, we can find a sequence of points in A that converges to z.\n\nTherefore, the closure of A, $\\bar A$, is the set of all z in Z such that ρ(z, 0) ≤ 1."
