The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nThe intersection of A and B is A ∩ B = {2, 3}. Now, let's find the elements that are in either A or B but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = {1, 4} (since 1 is in A but not in B, and 4 is in B but not in A)\n\nNow, we need to find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) and {2, 3}:\n\n(A △ B) = {1, 4}\n{2, 3}\n\nThe intersection of (A △ B) and {2, 3} is (A △ B) ∩ {2, 3} = {}. Now, let's find the elements that are in either (A △ B) or {2, 3} but not in their intersection.\n\n(A △ B) △ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4} (since 1 and 4 are in (A △ B) but not in {2, 3}, and 2 and 3 are in {2, 3} but not in (A △ B))\n\nSo, the symmetric difference (A △ B) △ {2, 3} is {1, 2, 3, 4}."
