    "message_1": "Suppose we start with a Sierpinski arrowhead curve whose total perimeter is 100 units. If we continue the self-similarity process by removing the central triangle from each of the remaining triangles, what is the total perimeter of the resulting figure after five iterations?",
    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is formed by repeatedly applying a specific transformation rule. With each iteration, the total perimeter of the curve increases by a factor of 3/2.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the total perimeter is 100 * (3/2) = 150 units.\nAfter the second iteration, the total perimeter is 150 * (3/2) = 225 units.\nAfter the third iteration, the total perimeter is 225 * (3/2) = 337.5 units.\nAfter the fourth iteration, the total perimeter is 337.5 * (3/2) = 506.25 units.\nAfter the fifth iteration, the total perimeter is 506.25 * (3/2) = 759.375 units.\n\nSo, after five iterations, the total perimeter of the resulting figure is 759.375 units."
