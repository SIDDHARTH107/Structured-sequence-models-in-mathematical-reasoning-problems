    "message_2": "To solve the equation |x - 3| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: x - 3 â‰¥ 0\nIn this case, |x - 3| = x - 3. So, the equation becomes:\nx - 3 = 7\nx = 7 + 3\nx = 10\n\nCase 2: x - 3 < 0\nIn this case, |x - 3| = -(x - 3). So, the equation becomes:\n-(x - 3) = 7\n-1 * (x - 3) = 7\n-x + 3 = 7\n-x = 7 - 3\n-x = 4\nx = -4\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 10 and -4."
