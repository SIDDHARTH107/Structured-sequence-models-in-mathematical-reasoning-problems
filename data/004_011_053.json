    "message_1": "A 15-foot ladder is leaning against a wall. The bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second. At what rate is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 9 feet away from the wall? (Hint: This is a related rates problem that can be solved using calculus.)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall, and y be the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. We are given that dx/dt = 2 ft/s (the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall) and we want to find dy/dt (the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall) when x = 9 ft.\n\nSince the ladder is always 15 ft long, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate x and y:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 15^2\n\nNow, we can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\nd/dt(x^2 + y^2) = d/dt(225)\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe are given that dx/dt = 2 ft/s, and we want to find dy/dt when x = 9 ft. To do this, we first need to find the value of y when x = 9 ft:\n\n9^2 + y^2 = 15^2\n81 + y^2 = 225\ny^2 = 144\ny = 12\n\nNow we can plug in the values of x, y, and dx/dt into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(9)(2) + 2(12)(dy/dt) = 0\n36 + 24(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, solve for dy/dt:\n\n24(dy/dt) = -36\ndy/dt = -36/24\ndy/dt = -3/2\n\nSo, when the bottom of the ladder is 9 feet away from the wall, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of -3/2 ft/s (negative sign indicates that it's sliding downwards)."
