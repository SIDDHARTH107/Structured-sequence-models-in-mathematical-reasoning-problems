    "message_2": "a) To show that $C$ is a non-singular curve, we need to check that the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to $x$ and $y$ do not vanish simultaneously at any point on the curve.\n\nThe equation of the curve is given by $F(x, y) = y^3 - 3x^2y - 3y = 0$. Let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -6xy$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 - 3x^2 - 3$\n\nNow, we need to check if there exists a point $(x, y)$ on the curve such that both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -6xy = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 - 3x^2 - 3 = 0$\n\nFrom the first equation, we have two cases:\n\n1) $x = 0$: In this case, the second equation becomes $3y^2 - 3 = 0$, which gives $y = \\pm 1$. But neither of these points satisfy the curve equation $F(x, y) = 0$.\n\n2) $y = 0$: In this case, the curve equation becomes $-3y = 0$, which is satisfied. The second equation becomes $-3x^2 - 3 = 0$, which gives $x^2 = -1$. This has no real solutions.\n\nTherefore, there are no points on the curve where both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously. Hence, $C$ is a non-singular curve.\n\nb) Let's find the birational transformation that takes the point $(1 : 0 : 1)$ on the curve $C$ to the point $(0 : 1 : 0)$ on the line $y = z = 0$. We can use the projective transformation given by:\n\n$(x : y : z) \\mapsto (xz : yz : xy)$\n\nApplying this transformation to the point $(1 : 0 : 1)$, we get:\n\n$(1 : 0 : 1) \\mapsto (1 \\cdot 1 : 0 \\cdot 1 : 1 \\cdot 0) = (1 : 0 : 0)$\n\nNow, we need to find the transformation that takes $(1 : 0 : 0)$ to $(0 : 1 : 0)$. We can use the projective transformation given by:\n\n$(x : y : z) \\mapsto (y : x : z)$\n\nApplying this transformation to the point $(1 : 0 : 0)$, we get:\n\n$(1 : 0 : 0) \\mapsto (0 : 1 : 0)$\n\nSo, the birational transformation that takes $(1 : 0 : 1)$ to $(0 : 1 : 0)$ is the composition of these two transformations:\n\n$(x : y : z) \\mapsto (xz : yz : xy) \\mapsto (y : x : z)$\n\nc) To find the equation of a line through $(1 : 0 : 1)$ that is tangent to the curve $C$, we can use the transformation from part (b) to map the curve to a simpler curve, find the tangent line there, and then map the tangent line back to the original curve.\n\nApplying the transformation from part (b) to the curve $C$, we get:\n\n$F(xz, yz) = (yz)^3 - 3(xz)^2(yz) - 3(yz) = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$y^3z^3 - 3x^2y^3z - 3y^2z^2 = 0$\n\nNow, we can set $z = 1$ to get a simpler curve:\n\n$y^3 - 3x^2y - 3y^2 = 0$\n\nThe point $(1 : 0 : 1)$ is mapped to $(0 : 1 : 1)$ under the transformation. To find the tangent line at this point, we can compute the partial derivatives of the simplified curve equation with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -6xy$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 - 3x^2 - 6y$\n\nEvaluating these partial derivatives at the point $(0, 1)$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 3 - 6 = -3$\n\nSo, the tangent line at this point has the equation:\n\n$-3(y - 1) = 0$\n\nNow, we need to map this line back to the original curve using the inverse of the transformation from part (b). The inverse transformation is given by:\n\n$(x : y : z) \\mapsto (yz : xz : xy)$\n\nApplying this transformation to the line equation, we get:\n\n$-3((yz) - 1) = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$3yz - 3 = 0$\n\nSo, the equation of the line through $(1 : 0 : 1)$ that is tangent to the curve $C$ is:\n\n$3yz - 3 = 0$"
