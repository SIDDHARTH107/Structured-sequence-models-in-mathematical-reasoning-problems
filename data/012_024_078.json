    "message_2": "To determine the genus of a graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and its generalization for graphs embedded on surfaces of higher genus. The Euler's formula for planar graphs states that:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFor a graph embedded on a surface of genus g, the formula is modified as:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nIn this case, we have V = 12 and E = 18. We want to find the smallest non-negative integer g such that the equation holds true for some non-negative integer F.\n\nLet's rearrange the formula to solve for F:\n\nF = 2g - 2 + E - V = 2g - 2 + 18 - 12 = 2g + 4\n\nNow, we can try different values of g and see if we get a non-negative integer for F:\n\ng = 0: F = 2(0) + 4 = 4\ng = 1: F = 2(1) + 4 = 6\ng = 2: F = 2(2) + 4 = 8\n...\n\nFor g = 0, we have F = 4. This means that the graph could be embedded on a surface of genus 0, which is a sphere (i.e., the graph is planar). However, we need to check if this is possible by verifying if the graph satisfies the necessary conditions for planarity.\n\nA graph is planar if it satisfies Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K_{3,3} (complete bipartite graph on two sets of 3 vertices).\n\nWe can use the inequality derived from Euler's formula to check if the graph could potentially be planar:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case:\n\n18 ≤ 3(12) - 6\n18 ≤ 30\n\nSince the inequality holds, the graph could potentially be planar. However, this is not a guarantee, as we still need to check for the presence of K_5 or K_{3,3} subgraphs.\n\nIf we find that the graph does not contain any K_5 or K_{3,3} subgraphs, then the graph is indeed planar, and its genus is 0. If the graph does contain such subgraphs, we would need to consider higher genus surfaces (g = 1, 2, ...) and check the conditions for embedding the graph on those surfaces.\n\nWithout more information about the specific graph G, we cannot definitively determine its genus. However, we have shown that it could potentially be planar (genus 0) if it does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} subgraphs."
