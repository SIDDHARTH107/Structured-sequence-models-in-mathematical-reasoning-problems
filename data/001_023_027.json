    "message_2": "First, we need to isolate sin(x) in the equation:\n\n2sin(x) + 1 = 0\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n2sin(x) = -1\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nsin(x) = -1/2\n\nNow we need to find the values of x in the interval [0, 2π] that satisfy this equation. Recall that the sine function has a period of 2π, and it is negative in the third and fourth quadrants.\n\nThe reference angle for sin(x) = 1/2 is π/6 (or 30°). So, we need to find the angles in the third and fourth quadrants that have the same reference angle.\n\nFor the third quadrant, we add π to the reference angle:\n\nx = π/6 + π = 7π/6\n\nFor the fourth quadrant, we subtract the reference angle from 2π:\n\nx = 2π - π/6 = 11π/6\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the interval [0, 2π] are:\n\nx = 7π/6, 11π/6"
