    "message_2": "To find the probability of winning the game with one ticket, we need to determine the total number of possible outcomes and the number of successful outcomes.\n\nThere are 10 numbers to choose from, and we are drawing 3 numbers without replacement. So, the total number of possible outcomes can be calculated using combinations:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and r = 3:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!7!)\nC(10, 3) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7!)/(3 × 2 × 1 × 7!)\nC(10, 3) = (10 × 9 × 8)/(3 × 2 × 1)\nC(10, 3) = 720 / 6\nC(10, 3) = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 possible outcomes when drawing 3 numbers from 1 to 10 without replacement.\n\nSince you are purchasing only one ticket, there is only one successful outcome (matching all three numbers). Therefore, the probability of winning the game with one ticket is:\n\nP(winning) = (number of successful outcomes) / (total number of possible outcomes)\nP(winning) = 1 / 120\n\nThe probability of winning the game with one ticket is 1/120 or approximately 0.0083 (0.83%)."
