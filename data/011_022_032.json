    "message_1": "A student is packing for a camping trip and has a backpack with a maximum capacity of 20 kg. She has 5 items she wants to bring, each with a different weight: 3 kg, 5 kg, 8 kg, 10 kg, and 12 kg. What combination of these items can she pack in her backpack to maximize the total weight she carries? Use the 0/1 Knapsack problem to solve this.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the 0/1 Knapsack algorithm, we will create a table with 5 rows (one for each item) and 20 columns (one for each possible weight from 1 to 20 kg). We will fill in the table by comparing the value of including or excluding each item for each possible weight.\n\nThe table will look like this:\n\n|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |  3 |  3 |  3 |  3 |  3 |  3 |  3 |  3 |  3 |  3 |  3 |\n| 5 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 8 | 8 | 8 |  8 |  8 |  8 |  8 |  8 |  8 |  8 |  8 |  8 |  8 |  8 |\n| 8 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 8 | 8 |11 | 11 | 13 | 13 | 13 | 13 | 13 | 13 | 13 | 13 | 13 | 13 |\n|10 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 8 | 8 |11 | 11 | 13 | 13 | 15 | 15 | 18 | 18 | 18 | 18 | 18 | 18 |\n|12 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 8 | 8 |11 | 11 | 13 | 13 | 15 | 15 | 18 | 18 | 20 | 20 | 21 | 21 |\n\nNow, we will read the solution from the table. The maximum weight she can carry is in the bottom-right cell, which is 21 kg. However, this exceeds the backpack's capacity, so we need to find the combination of items that gives us the maximum weight without exceeding the capacity.\n\nStarting from the bottom-right cell, we move up the column until we find a different value, which is 18 kg in the row corresponding to the 10 kg item. This means the 10 kg item is included in the optimal solution. We then move left to the column with a weight of 10 kg (20 - 10 = 10) and repeat the process.\n\nIn the 10 kg column, we move up until we find a different value, which is 8 kg in the row corresponding to the 5 kg item. This means the 5 kg item is included in the optimal solution. We then move left to the column with a weight of 5 kg (10 - 5 = 5) and repeat the process.\n\nIn the 5 kg column, we move up until we find a different value, which is 3 kg in the row corresponding to the 3 kg item. This means the 3 kg item is included in the optimal solution.\n\nSo, the combination of items that the student should pack to maximize the total weight she carries without exceeding the backpack's capacity is the 3 kg, 5 kg, and 10 kg items, for a total weight of 18 kg."
