    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of a regular surface defined by the equation z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2), we need to compute the Gaussian curvature K at this point.\n\nFirst, we need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 4uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we compute the second derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 2)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNext, we find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\ne = N • r_uu = 2\nf = N • r_uv = 2\ng = N • r_vv = 2\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface. We can find it by taking the cross product of r_u and r_v:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (-2u, -2v, 1)\n\nNow, we normalize N:\n\n|N| = sqrt((-2u)^2 + (-2v)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nN = (-2u, -2v, 1) / sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (eg - f^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\n\ne = 2\nf = 2\ng = 2\n\nNow, we plug these values into the formula:\n\nK = (2 * 2 - 2^2) / (5 * 5 - 4^2) = (4 - 4) / (25 - 16) = 0 / 9 = 0\n\nThe sectional curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,2) is 0."
