    "message_2": "To compute the 2nd de Rham cohomology group $H_{dR}^2(M)$ of $M$, we first need to understand the topology of the torus. A torus can be constructed by identifying the opposite sides of a square. Let's denote the sides of the square by $a$ and $b$. Then, the fundamental group of the torus is given by $\\pi_1(M) = \\langle a, b \\rangle$.\n\nNow, we can use the de Rham theorem, which states that the de Rham cohomology groups are isomorphic to the singular cohomology groups with real coefficients: $H_{dR}^k(M) \\cong H^k(M; \\mathbb{R})$. The singular cohomology groups can be computed using the universal coefficient theorem, which states that $H^k(M; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H_k(M; \\mathbb{R}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}(H_{k-1}(M; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nThe homology groups of the torus are well-known: $H_0(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^2$, $H_2(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H_k(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $k > 2$. Since $\\mathbb{R}$ is a field, the Ext term vanishes, and we have $H^k(M; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H_k(M; \\mathbb{R})$ for all $k$. Thus, we have $H_{dR}^2(M) \\cong H^2(M; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H_2(M; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the given closed 2-form $\\omega$ on $M$. Since $\\int_M \\omega = 4\\pi$, this implies that $\\omega$ is not exact, and thus represents a non-trivial element in $H_{dR}^2(M)$. Since $H_{dR}^2(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, we can conclude that $H_{dR}^2(M) = \\mathbb{R}$."
