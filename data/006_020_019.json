    "message_1": "In a community of 1000 people, 400 are women and 600 are men. If the probability of a woman attending a social event is 0.6 and the probability of a man attending the social event is 0.4, what is the probability that a person attending the social event is a woman?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a person attending the social event is a woman, we can use the Law of Total Probability. \n\nLet W be the event that a person is a woman, M be the event that a person is a man, and A be the event that a person attends the social event. We are asked to find the probability P(W|A).\n\nAccording to the Law of Total Probability, we have:\n\nP(A) = P(A|W) * P(W) + P(A|M) * P(M)\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(W) = 400/1000 = 0.4 (probability of a person being a woman)\nP(M) = 600/1000 = 0.6 (probability of a person being a man)\nP(A|W) = 0.6 (probability of a woman attending the social event)\nP(A|M) = 0.4 (probability of a man attending the social event)\n\nNow, we can find P(A):\n\nP(A) = P(A|W) * P(W) + P(A|M) * P(M)\nP(A) = 0.6 * 0.4 + 0.4 * 0.6\nP(A) = 0.24 + 0.24\nP(A) = 0.48\n\nNow, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(W|A):\n\nP(W|A) = P(A|W) * P(W) / P(A)\nP(W|A) = (0.6 * 0.4) / 0.48\nP(W|A) = 0.24 / 0.48\nP(W|A) = 0.5\n\nSo, the probability that a person attending the social event is a woman is 0.5 or 50%."
