    "message_2": "To determine the cut vertices and bridges in a graph G with 6 vertices and 6 edges, we first need to understand the structure of the graph. Since there are 6 vertices and 6 edges, the graph must be a tree or a tree with one additional edge, as a tree has n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices.\n\nA cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nCase 1: G is a tree\nIn this case, there are no cycles in the graph. All non-leaf vertices are cut vertices, as their removal will disconnect the graph. All edges are bridges, as their removal will also disconnect the graph.\n\nCase 2: G is a tree with one additional edge\nIn this case, there is exactly one cycle in the graph. To find the cut vertices and bridges, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cycle in the graph.\n2. Any vertex that is part of the cycle and has a subtree connected to it (i.e., a vertex with a degree greater than 2) is a cut vertex.\n3. Any edge that is not part of the cycle is a bridge.\n\nWithout knowing the exact structure of the graph, we cannot provide specific cut vertices and bridges. However, you can apply the above steps to find them once you have the graph."
