    "message_2": "To determine the maximum size of a complete subgraph (clique) in G, we can use the Turán's theorem. Turán's theorem gives an upper bound on the number of edges in an undirected graph that does not contain a complete subgraph of a given order.\n\nLet n be the number of vertices in the graph, and let r be the size of the largest complete subgraph that is not allowed in the graph. According to Turán's theorem, the maximum number of edges in such a graph is given by:\n\nE ≤ (1 - 1/r) * (n^2)/2\n\nIn our case, n = 7 and E = 10. We want to find the largest r such that the inequality holds.\n\nLet's start by testing r = 2 (i.e., no complete subgraph of size 3 is allowed):\n\nE ≤ (1 - 1/2) * (7^2)/2\nE ≤ (1/2) * 49/2\nE ≤ 24.5\n\nSince 10 ≤ 24.5, a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges can avoid having a complete subgraph of size 3. Now let's test r = 3 (i.e., no complete subgraph of size 4 is allowed):\n\nE ≤ (1 - 1/3) * (7^2)/2\nE ≤ (2/3) * 49/2\nE ≤ 49/3 ≈ 16.33\n\nSince 10 ≤ 16.33, a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges can avoid having a complete subgraph of size 4. Now let's test r = 4 (i.e., no complete subgraph of size 5 is allowed):\n\nE ≤ (1 - 1/4) * (7^2)/2\nE ≤ (3/4) * 49/2\nE ≤ 73/4 ≈ 18.25\n\nSince 10 is not greater than or equal to 18.25, a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges cannot avoid having a complete subgraph of size 5.\n\nTherefore, the maximum size of a complete subgraph (clique) in G is 4."
