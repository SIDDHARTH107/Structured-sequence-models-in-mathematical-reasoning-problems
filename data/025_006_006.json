    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of $H^3(X, \\mathbb{Q})$, we can use the Poincaré duality, which states that for a compact, oriented, smooth manifold (or projective variety) $X$ of dimension $n$, there is an isomorphism $H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^{2n-i}(X, \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nSince $X$ is a projective variety over the complex numbers, it is a complex manifold, and its dimension as a real manifold is $2n$, where $n$ is the complex dimension of $X$. We are given the dimensions of $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ and $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$, so we can use Poincaré duality to find the dimensions of $H^{2n-1}(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ and $H^{2n-2}(X, \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nFirst, let's find the complex dimension $n$ of $X$. Since $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}^4$, we know that the real dimension of $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is $4$. Similarly, the real dimension of $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is $6$. By Poincaré duality, we have:\n\n$H^{2n-1}(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^1(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}^4$\n\n$H^{2n-2}(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}^6$\n\nSince the real dimension of $H^{2n-1}(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is $4$, we have $2n - 1 = 4$, which implies $n = \\frac{5}{2}$. However, the complex dimension must be an integer, so there is a contradiction. This means that the given information about the dimensions of $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ and $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is not consistent with the properties of a projective variety over the complex numbers.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to determine the dimension of $H^3(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ based on the given information."
