    "message_2": "Yes, this is a valid topology on X. \n\nA topology T on a set X must satisfy the following three conditions:\n\n1. The empty set (∅) and the set X itself are both elements of T.\n2. The intersection of any finite number of elements in T is also an element of T.\n3. The union of any collection of elements in T is also an element of T.\n\nLet's check if the given topology T = {∅, X, {1}, {2,3}} satisfies these conditions:\n\n1. The empty set (∅) and the set X itself ({1, 2, 3}) are both elements of T.\n2. There are only a few possible intersections to consider:\n   - ∅ ∩ {1} = ∅, which is in T\n   - ∅ ∩ {2,3} = ∅, which is in T\n   - {1} ∩ {2,3} = ∅, which is in T\n   - {1} ∩ {1} = {1}, which is in T\n   - {2,3} ∩ {2,3} = {2,3}, which is in T\n   All intersections are in T.\n3. There are only a few possible unions to consider:\n   - ∅ ∪ {1} = {1}, which is in T\n   - ∅ ∪ {2,3} = {2,3}, which is in T\n   - {1} ∪ {2,3} = {1, 2, 3}, which is in T\n   All unions are in T.\n\nSince all three conditions are satisfied, T is a valid topology on X."
