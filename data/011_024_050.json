Each road has a maximum capacity of goods it can carry per day. What is the maximum number of goods that can be transported from the warehouse to the stores per day?\n\n[Network Flow Diagram]\n\nWarehouse -- 100 units/day --> Store A -- 60 units/day --> Store B\n |\n50 units/day\n |\nv\nStore C -- 120 units/day --> Store D -- 80 units/day --> Store E\n\nNote: The numbers next to each line indicate the maximum number of units of good that can be transported through that line in one day.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of goods that can be transported from the warehouse to the stores per day, we need to analyze the flow of goods through the network.\n\n1. From the warehouse, 100 units can be transported to Store A, and 50 units can be transported to Store C. This is a total of 150 units leaving the warehouse.\n\n2. From Store A, 60 units can be transported to Store B. Since Store A receives 100 units from the warehouse, it can send all 60 units to Store B, leaving 40 units at Store A.\n\n3. From Store C, 120 units can be transported to Store D. However, Store C only receives 50 units from the warehouse, so it can only send 50 units to Store D.\n\n4. From Store D, 80 units can be transported to Store E. Since Store D receives 50 units from Store C, it can send all 50 units to Store E.\n\n5. In total, the goods transported to the stores are:\n- Store A: 40 units\n- Store B: 60 units\n- Store C: 0 units (all goods are sent to Store D)\n- Store D: 0 units (all goods are sent to Store E)\n- Store E: 50 units\n\nThe maximum number of goods that can be transported from the warehouse to the stores per day is 40 + 60 + 50 = 150 units."
