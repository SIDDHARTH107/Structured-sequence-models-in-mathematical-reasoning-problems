    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, width of 8 cm and height of 6 cm. Determine the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nIn this case, the length is 10 cm, the width is 8 cm, and the height is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiagonal = √(10² + 8² + 6²)\nDiagonal = √(100 + 64 + 36)\nDiagonal = √(200)\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √(200) cm, which is approximately 14.14 cm."
