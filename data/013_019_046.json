Here's an example question:\n\nIn a Cheap Talk game with two players, Player 1 has two messages, \"high\" or \"low\", and Player 2 has two possible actions, \"buy\" or \"not buy\". If Player 1 sends the \"high\" message, Player 2's payoff is 5 if they buy and 0 if they don't buy. If Player 1 sends the \"low\" message, Player 2's payoff is 3 if they buy and 2 if they don't buy. If Player 2 doesn't trust Player 1's messages, what is the probability that Player 2 will buy when Player 1 sends the \"low\" message?",
    "message_2": "If Player 2 doesn't trust Player 1's messages, they will ignore the message and make their decision based on the expected payoffs of their actions. To find the probability that Player 2 will buy when Player 1 sends the \"low\" message, we need to calculate the expected payoffs for both actions.\n\nLet p be the probability that Player 1 sends the \"high\" message, and (1-p) be the probability that Player 1 sends the \"low\" message.\n\nExpected payoff for buying:\nE(buy) = p * 5 + (1-p) * 3\n\nExpected payoff for not buying:\nE(not buy) = p * 0 + (1-p) * 2\n\nPlayer 2 will buy when E(buy) > E(not buy). Let's find the condition for this inequality to hold:\n\np * 5 + (1-p) * 3 > p * 0 + (1-p) * 2\n5p + 3 - 3p > 2 - 2p\n2p > -1\np > -1/2\n\nSince probabilities must be between 0 and 1, the condition p > -1/2 always holds. Therefore, Player 2 will always buy when they don't trust Player 1's messages, regardless of the message sent. So, the probability that Player 2 will buy when Player 1 sends the \"low\" message is 1, or 100%."
