    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nHowever, we need to find the angle between the base and the height. To do this, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse and then use inverse trigonometric functions to find the angle.\n\nLet's call the base a, the height b, and the hypotenuse c. We have:\n\na = 10 cm\nb = 12 cm\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\nc^2 = (10)^2 + (12)^2\nc^2 = 100 + 144\nc^2 = 244\nc = √244 ≈ 15.62 cm\n\nNow, we can use the inverse tangent function to find the angle between the base and the height:\n\nangle = arctan(opposite/adjacent)\nangle = arctan(b/a)\nangle = arctan(12/10)\nangle ≈ 50.19°\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the area formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\nArea = (1/2) * 10 * 12 * sin(50.19°)\nArea ≈ 60 * 0.766\nArea ≈ 45.96 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 45.96 cm²."
