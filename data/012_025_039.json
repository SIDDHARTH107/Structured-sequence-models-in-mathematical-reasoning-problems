    "message_1": "Suppose you have a graph with 5 vertices and the following edges: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,1), (1,3), (2,4), and (3,5). Can you find a Hamiltonian cycle in this graph? If yes, provide the sequence of vertices in the cycle. If no, explain why it is not possible.",
    "message_2": "Yes, there is a Hamiltonian cycle in this graph. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. The sequence of vertices in the Hamiltonian cycle is:\n\n1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 4 → 1\n\nThis cycle visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex, satisfying the conditions of a Hamiltonian cycle."
