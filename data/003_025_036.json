    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the plane's resulting velocity, we can use vector addition. We will break down the plane's velocity and the wind's velocity into their respective components and then add them together to find the resulting velocity.\n\nLet Vp be the plane's velocity vector and Vw be the wind's velocity vector. We can represent these vectors in terms of their components as follows:\n\nVp = (Vpx, Vpy)\nVw = (Vwx, Vwy)\n\nThe plane is flying southward at a speed of 500 km/hr, so its components are:\n\nVpx = 0 (since it's not moving east or west)\nVpy = -500 km/hr (southward direction is negative)\n\nThe wind is blowing in a direction 30 degrees east of the north at a speed of 100 km/hr. We can find its components using trigonometry:\n\nVwx = 100 * sin(30) = 50 km/hr (eastward direction is positive)\nVwy = 100 * cos(30) = 86.6 km/hr (northward direction is positive)\n\nNow, we can find the resulting velocity vector Vr by adding the components of Vp and Vw:\n\nVr = (Vpx + Vwx, Vpy + Vwy)\nVr = (0 + 50, -500 + 86.6)\nVr = (50, -413.4)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the resulting velocity vector Vr using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n|Vr| = sqrt((50)^2 + (-413.4)^2)\n|Vr| ≈ 416.9 km/hr\n\nTo find the direction of the resulting velocity vector, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(Vry / Vrx)\nθ = arctan(-413.4 / 50)\nθ ≈ -82.9 degrees\n\nSince the angle is negative, it means the direction is south of the east direction. So, the direction of the plane's resulting velocity is approximately 82.9 degrees south of east.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnitude of the plane's resulting velocity is approximately 416.9 km/hr, and its direction is approximately 82.9 degrees south of east."
