Here, I'll provide a Python code to calculate the hash value:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\nmessage = \"mathematics is fun\"\nhash_object = hashlib.sha256(message.encode())\nhash_value = hash_object.hexdigest()\n\nprint(hash_value)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you will get the following hash value:\n\n`c5a7f7eae8eaae8e5d5a9f1c1a8a5d8e5d5a9f1c1a8a5d8e5d5a9f1c1a8a5d8e`\n\nPlease note that the hash value provided here is incorrect and only serves as an example. To get the correct hash value, you need to run the code or use an online tool."
