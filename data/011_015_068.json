    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of friendships needed for this to be true, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's consider one person in the group, say person A. There are 5 other people in the group, so person A can have at most 5 friendships.\n\nNow, let's divide these 5 people into two categories: friends of person A and strangers to person A. If person A has at least 3 friends, then either these 3 friends are friends with each other (forming a group of 3 friends), or at least two of them are strangers to each other (forming a group of 3 strangers, including person A).\n\nIf person A has at least 3 strangers, then either these 3 strangers are friends with each other (forming a group of 3 friends), or at least two of them are strangers to each other (forming a group of 3 strangers, including person A).\n\nIn either case, we need a minimum of 3 friendships for this condition to be true."
