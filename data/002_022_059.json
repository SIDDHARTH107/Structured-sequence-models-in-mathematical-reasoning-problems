    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 10 cm and a minor radius of 5 cm. What is the volume of the torus?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (pi * (minor radius)^2) * (2 * pi * major radius)\n\nIn this case, the major radius (R) is 10 cm and the minor radius (r) is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (pi * (5 cm)^2) * (2 * pi * 10 cm)\n\nVolume = (pi * 25 cm^2) * (20 * pi cm)\n\nVolume = 500 * pi^2 cm^3\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 4934.8 cubic centimeters."
