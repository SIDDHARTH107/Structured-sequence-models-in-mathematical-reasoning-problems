    "message_2": "To factorize the quadratic polynomial x² - 7x + 10, we need to find two binomials whose product equals the given polynomial. We can do this by finding two numbers that multiply to the constant term (10) and add up to the coefficient of the linear term (-7).\n\nThe two numbers that meet these conditions are -5 and -2, since (-5) × (-2) = 10 and (-5) + (-2) = -7.\n\nSo, the factorization of the polynomial x² - 7x + 10 is:\n\n(x - 5)(x - 2)"
