    "message_1": "Consider a signaling game with two players, Sender and Receiver. Sender has two messages to choose from, M1 and M2, and Receiver has two actions to choose from, A1 and A2. The payoffs are given in the following table:\n\n|          | A1   | A2   |\n|----------|------|------|\n| **M1** | 3, 0 | 0, 1 |\n| **M2** | 1, 0 | 0, 3 |\n\nSuppose that Sender wants Receiver to choose A1. What message should the Sender choose to maximize their expected payoff and what is the expected payoff when using this message?",
    "message_2": "Since the Sender wants the Receiver to choose A1, they should choose the message that has the highest payoff for them when the Receiver chooses A1. Comparing the payoffs in the table:\n\nFor M1 and A1, the payoff is (3, 0).\nFor M2 and A1, the payoff is (1, 0).\n\nThe Sender's payoff is higher when they choose message M1 and the Receiver chooses A1. Therefore, the Sender should choose message M1 to maximize their expected payoff. The expected payoff for the Sender when using message M1 and the Receiver chooses A1 is 3."
