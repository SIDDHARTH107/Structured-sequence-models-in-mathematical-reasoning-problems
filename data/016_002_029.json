    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then successively adding smaller equilateral triangles to its sides. Each iteration increases the number of sides by a factor of 4 and the length of each side is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of each side is 1/3, and there are 3 * 4 = 12 sides.\nAfter the second iteration, the length of each side is (1/3)^2, and there are 12 * 4 = 48 sides.\nAfter the third iteration, the length of each side is (1/3)^3, and there are 48 * 4 = 192 sides.\nAfter the fourth iteration, the length of each side is (1/3)^4, and there are 192 * 4 = 768 sides.\n\nTo find the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after four iterations, we multiply the number of sides by the length of each side:\n\nPerimeter = 768 * (1/3)^4\nPerimeter = 768 * (1/81)\nPerimeter = 768/81 â‰ˆ 9.4815\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve after four iterations is approximately 9.4815, given that the initial length of the line segment is 1."
