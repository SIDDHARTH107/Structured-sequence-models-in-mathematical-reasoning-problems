    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 4x - 5 > 11, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Add 5 to both sides of the inequality.\n4x - 5 + 5 > 11 + 5\n4x > 16\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 4.\n4x/4 > 16/4\nx > 4\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x > 4.\n\nTo graph the solution set on a number line:\n\n1. Draw a number line with the numbers 0 to 8, for example.\n2. Locate the number 4 on the number line.\n3. Since x > 4, we want all the values greater than 4. To represent this, draw an open circle at 4 (because 4 is not included in the solution set) and draw an arrow pointing to the right from the open circle, indicating that all the numbers greater than 4 are part of the solution set."
