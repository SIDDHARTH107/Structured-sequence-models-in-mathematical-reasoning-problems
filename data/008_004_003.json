If so, find the solution by writing the system in matrix form and solving for the variables.",
    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\n```\nA * X = 0\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and 0 is the zero vector.\n\nA = |  3  -4   2 |\n    |  6  -8   4 |\n    |  9 -12   6 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\n0 = | 0 |\n    | 0 |\n    | 0 |\n```\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination on matrix A to find its row echelon form:\n\n1. Divide the first row by 3:\n\n```\nA = |  1  -4/3  2/3 |\n    |  6  -8    4  |\n    |  9 -12    6  |\n```\n\n2. Subtract 6 times the first row from the second row:\n\n```\nA = |  1  -4/3  2/3 |\n    |  0   0    0  |\n    |  9 -12    6  |\n```\n\n3. Subtract 9 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\nA = |  1  -4/3  2/3 |\n    |  0   0    0  |\n    |  0   0    0  |\n```\n\nThe row echelon form of matrix A has two rows of zeros, which means that the system of linear equations is dependent and has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express the variables in terms of a free variable. Let's choose z as the free variable:\n\n```\nx - (4/3)y + (2/3)z = 0\n```\n\nExpress x in terms of y and z:\n\n```\nx = (4/3)y - (2/3)z\n```\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as:\n\n```\nX = | x |   | (4/3)y - (2/3)z |\n    | y | = |       y         |\n    | z |   |       z         |\n```\n\nSo, there is a non-trivial solution to this system of homogeneous linear equations, and the general solution is given by:\n\n```\nx = (4/3)y - (2/3)z\ny = y\nz = z\n```"
