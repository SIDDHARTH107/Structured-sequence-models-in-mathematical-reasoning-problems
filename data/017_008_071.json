    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 8. By the Sylow theorems, there must be a subgroup of order 2^3 = 8. There are three possibilities for the structure of G:\n\n1. G is a cyclic group of order 8, denoted as C8.\n2. G is a quaternion group of order 8, denoted as Q8.\n3. G is a dihedral group of order 8, denoted as D4.\n\nWe will now find the elements, subgroups, and their isomorphism classes for each of these groups.\n\n1. Cyclic group C8:\nElements: {1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7}, where a has order 8.\nSubgroups: \n- Trivial subgroup {1}\n- Subgroup of order 2: {1, a^4}\n- Subgroup of order 4: {1, a^2, a^4, a^6}\n- The whole group C8 itself: {1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7}\n\n2. Quaternion group Q8:\nElements: {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k}\nSubgroups:\n- Trivial subgroup {1}\n- Subgroup of order 2: {1, -1}\n- Subgroup of order 4: {1, -1, i, -i}, {1, -1, j, -j}, {1, -1, k, -k}\n- The whole group Q8 itself: {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k}\n\n3. Dihedral group D4:\nElements: {1, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}, where r has order 4 and s has order 2.\nSubgroups:\n- Trivial subgroup {1}\n- Subgroup of order 2: {1, r^2}, {1, s}, {1, sr}, {1, sr^2}, {1, sr^3}\n- Subgroup of order 4: {1, r, r^2, r^3}\n- The whole group D4 itself: {1, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}\n\nNow, we determine if the group G is isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4. Since G has order 8, it can be isomorphic to any of these three groups. To determine which one, we need to look at the properties of the group G.\n\n- If G is cyclic, it is isomorphic to C8.\n- If G has a unique subgroup of order 4 and every element has order 2 or 4, it is isomorphic to Q8.\n- If G has more than one subgroup of order 4 and has elements of order 2, it is isomorphic to D4.\n\nWithout more information about the properties of G, we cannot determine which of these three groups it is isomorphic to."
