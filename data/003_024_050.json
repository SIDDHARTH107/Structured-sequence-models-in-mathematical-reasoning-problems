    "message_1": "A student wants to find the projection of vector A(4,2) onto vector B(-1,3). Using trigonometry, what is the scalar projection of vector A onto vector B? Round the answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "To find the scalar projection of vector A onto vector B, we can use the formula:\n\nscalar_projection = (A · B) / ||B||\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B, and ||B|| is the magnitude of vector B.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of A and B:\n\nA · B = (4 * -1) + (2 * 3) = -4 + 6 = 2\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of vector B:\n\n||B|| = sqrt((-1)^2 + (3)^2) = sqrt(1 + 9) = sqrt(10)\n\nNow, we can find the scalar projection:\n\nscalar_projection = (A · B) / ||B|| = 2 / sqrt(10) ≈ 0.63\n\nSo, the scalar projection of vector A onto vector B is approximately 0.63."
