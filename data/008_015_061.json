    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the system of linear equations in matrix form Ax = b:\n\nA = | 4  3  1 |      x = | x |      b = |  8  |\n    | 3  9  2 |          | y |          | 32  |\n    | 0  2  7 |          | z |          | 41  |\n\nNow, we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. We want to find a lower triangular matrix L such that A = L * L^T.\n\nL = | l11  0   0  |      L^T = | l11  l21  0  |\n    | l21  l22  0  |            |  0   l22  l32 |\n    |  0   l32  l33|            |  0    0   l33 |\n\nUsing the Cholesky decomposition algorithm, we can find the elements of L:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(4) = 2\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 3 / 2\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(9 - (3/2)^2) = 3\nl32 = a32 / l22 = 2 / 3\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l32^2) = sqrt(7 - (2/3)^2) = sqrt(41/3)\n\nSo, L = |  2   0       0    |\n          | 3/2  3       0    |\n          |  0   2/3  sqrt(41/3)|\n\nNow, we will solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n2y1 = 8 => y1 = 4\n(3/2)y1 + 3y2 = 32 => y2 = 6\n(2/3)y3 + sqrt(41/3)y3 = 41 => y3 = 3\n\nSo, y = | 4 |\n          | 6 |\n          | 3 |\n\nFinally, we will solve the system L^Tx = y for x:\n\n2x1 = 4 => x1 = 2\n3x1 + 3x2 = 6 => x2 = 0\n(2/3)x3 + sqrt(41/3)x3 = 3 => x3 = 1\n\nSo, x = | 2 |\n          | 0 |\n          | 1 |\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 0, and z = 1."
