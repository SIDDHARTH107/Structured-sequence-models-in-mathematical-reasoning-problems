The data collected had a mean of 32 years and standard deviation of 3 years. Using bootstrapping, estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean age of first-time homebuyers in the city.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean age of first-time homebuyers using bootstrapping, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples (e.g., 1000) from the original sample of 50 adults with replacement.\n2. Calculate the mean age for each bootstrap sample.\n3. Arrange the calculated means in ascending order.\n4. Determine the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the bootstrap means.\n\nLet's assume we have done the bootstrapping and calculated the means for each of the 1000 samples. Now, we will find the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.\n\nTo find the 2.5th percentile, we multiply 0.025 by the total number of bootstrap samples (1000) and round up to the nearest whole number. \n\n0.025 * 1000 = 25\n\nSo, the 2.5th percentile is the 25th value in the sorted list of bootstrap means.\n\nTo find the 97.5th percentile, we multiply 0.975 by the total number of bootstrap samples (1000) and round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n0.975 * 1000 = 975\n\nSo, the 97.5th percentile is the 975th value in the sorted list of bootstrap means.\n\nLet's assume the 25th value (2.5th percentile) is 30.5 years and the 975th value (97.5th percentile) is 33.5 years. Then, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean age of first-time homebuyers in the city is (30.5, 33.5) years."
