    "message_2": "There are 3 numbers on a six-sided die that are greater than or equal to 4: 4, 5, and 6. Since there are 6 possible outcomes when rolling the die, the probability of rolling a number greater than or equal to 4 is:\n\n3 (favorable outcomes) / 6 (total possible outcomes) = 1/2 or 50%."
