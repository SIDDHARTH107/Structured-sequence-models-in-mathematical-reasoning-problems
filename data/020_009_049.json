    "message_1": "The student needs to solve the following stochastic optimization problem: \n\nA company has a production line that can manufacture two types of products, A and B. Each product requires raw materials and labor, and each type of product has a different profit margin. The availability of raw materials and labor in the production process is uncertain and can be modeled as random variables. Product A requires 2 units of raw material and 3 hours of labor, and has a profit margin of $10 per unit. Product B requires 3 units of raw material and 2 hours of labor, and has a profit margin of $8 per unit. The company has 10 units of raw material and 12 hours of labor available. How many units of each product should the company produce in order to maximize the expected profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We need to maximize the expected profit, which can be represented as:\n\nExpected Profit = 10x + 8y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + 3y <= 10 (raw material constraint)\n3x + 2y <= 12 (labor constraint)\nx, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nWe can solve this problem using linear programming. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Raw material constraint: 2x + 3y <= 10\n   y <= (10 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. Labor constraint: 3x + 2y <= 12\n   y <= (12 - 3x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both constraints are satisfied. We can find the corner points of the feasible region by solving the system of equations:\n\n1. Intersection of raw material constraint and labor constraint:\n   2x + 3y = 10\n   3x + 2y = 12\n\n   Solving this system, we get x = 2 and y = 2.\n\n2. Intersection of raw material constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n   2x + 3(0) = 10\n   x = 5\n\n3. Intersection of labor constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n   3(0) + 2y = 12\n   y = 6\n\nNow we have three corner points: (0, 6), (5, 0), and (2, 2). We can calculate the expected profit for each of these points:\n\n1. Expected Profit at (0, 6): 10(0) + 8(6) = $48\n2. Expected Profit at (5, 0): 10(5) + 8(0) = $50\n3. Expected Profit at (2, 2): 10(2) + 8(2) = $36\n\nThe maximum expected profit is $50, which occurs when the company produces 5 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
