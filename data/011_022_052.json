    "message_1": "A knapsack can hold up to 20 pounds of weight. There are 5 items with weights and values as follows: \n\nItem 1: 5 pounds, $10 value\nItem 2: 2 pounds, $7 value\nItem 3: 8 pounds, $15 value\nItem 4: 4 pounds, $8 value\nItem 5: 9 pounds, $20 value\n\nWhat combination of items should the student select to maximize the value of the knapsack, given that the total weight of items cannot exceed 20 pounds?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the value of the knapsack, we need to find the combination of items with the highest value-to-weight ratio without exceeding the 20-pound weight limit. We can calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item:\n\nItem 1: $10 / 5 lbs = $2/lb\nItem 2: $7 / 2 lbs = $3.50/lb\nItem 3: $15 / 8 lbs = $1.875/lb\nItem 4: $8 / 4 lbs = $2/lb\nItem 5: $20 / 9 lbs = $2.22/lb\n\nNow, we can start adding items to the knapsack in order of the highest value-to-weight ratio:\n\n1. Item 2: 2 lbs, $7 value (total weight: 2 lbs, total value: $7)\n2. Item 5: 9 lbs, $20 value (total weight: 11 lbs, total value: $27)\n3. Item 1: 5 lbs, $10 value (total weight: 16 lbs, total value: $37)\n4. Item 4: 4 lbs, $8 value (total weight: 20 lbs, total value: $45)\n\nAt this point, we have reached the 20-pound weight limit. Adding Item 3 would exceed the weight limit, so we cannot include it.\n\nTherefore, the combination of items that maximizes the value of the knapsack is Item 1, Item 2, Item 4, and Item 5, with a total weight of 20 pounds and a total value of $45."
