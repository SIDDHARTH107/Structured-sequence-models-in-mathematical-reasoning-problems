    "message_2": "The logistic map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the equation:\n\nx(n+1) = r * x(n) * (1 - x(n))\n\nwhere x(n) is the population at time step n, and r is a parameter that controls the growth rate.\n\nPeriod-doubling bifurcation occurs when the system transitions from one stable periodic behavior to another with twice the period. In the logistic map, period-doubling bifurcations occur at specific values of the parameter r.\n\nWhen r = 4, the logistic map exhibits chaotic behavior. However, the period-doubling bifurcation value refers to the value of r at which the system transitions from one stable periodic behavior to another. The first period-doubling bifurcation occurs at r ≈ 3.0, where the system transitions from a stable fixed point to a stable 2-cycle. The second period-doubling bifurcation occurs at r ≈ 3.44949, where the system transitions from a stable 2-cycle to a stable 4-cycle.\n\nSo, when r = 4, the logistic map is in a chaotic regime, and it is not at a period-doubling bifurcation value."
