    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of a quadratic equation, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x. So, we have:\n\n0 = x^2 + 4x - 21\n\nNow, we can try to factor the equation or use the quadratic formula. In this case, the equation can be factored as:\n\n0 = (x + 7)(x - 3)\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we get:\n\nx + 7 = 0 => x = -7\nx - 3 = 0 => x = 3\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation y = x^2 + 4x - 21 are x = -7 and x = 3."
