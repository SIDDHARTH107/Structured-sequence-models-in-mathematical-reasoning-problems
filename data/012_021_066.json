In simpler terms, it is the smallest integer value such that the original graph can be split into subtrees where each subtree has a maximum size of k+1 and the subtrees overlap by k vertices.",
    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph, we first need to find a tree decomposition of the graph. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices from the original graph, and the tree satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices of the original graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the original graph, there exists a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the original graph, the set of bags containing v forms a connected subtree.\n\nNow, let's find a tree decomposition for the given graph:\n\n```\n       {1,2,3}\n       /     \\\n  {1,2,4}   {2,3,6}\n    |         |\n  {1,4,5}   {3,6,8}\n    |         |\n  {4,5,7}   {6,8,7}\n```\n\nIn this tree decomposition, the largest bag size is 3. Therefore, the treewidth of the graph is 3 - 1 = 2."
