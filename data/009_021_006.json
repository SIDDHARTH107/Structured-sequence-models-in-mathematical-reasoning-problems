    "message_2": "To solve this partial differential equation (PDE) with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Substituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\nXTY' = 3X''YT + 2XY''T\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3XYT to separate the variables:\n\nT'/(3T) = X''/X + 2Y''/(3Y)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ:\n\nT'/(3T) = -λ\nX''/X = -λ - 2Y''/(3Y)\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve:\n\n1) T' + 3λT = 0\n2) X'' + λX = 0\n3) Y'' + (3/2)(λ + 2Y'') = 0\n\nSolving the first ODE, we get:\n\nT(t) = A * e^(-3λt)\n\nNow, let's solve the second ODE. The characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 + λ = 0\n\nThe solutions to this equation are r = ±√(-λ). Since λ is positive, the general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = B * sin(√λx) + C * cos(√λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions u(0, y) = u(π, y) = 0, we get:\n\nX(0) = C = 0\nX(π) = B * sin(√λπ) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise, the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(√λπ) = 0. This implies that √λ = n, where n is an integer. Therefore, λ = n^2, and the solution for X(x) becomes:\n\nX(x) = B_n * sin(nx)\n\nNow, let's solve the third ODE:\n\nY'' + (3/2)(n^2 + 2Y'') = 0\n\nThis is a linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 + (3/2)n^2 = 0\n\nThe solutions to this equation are r = ±√(-(3/2)n^2) = ±(n√(3/2))i. The general solution for Y(y) is:\n\nY(y) = D_n * sin(n√(3/2)y) + E_n * cos(n√(3/2)y)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions u(x, 0) = u(x, π/2) = 0, we get:\n\nY(0) = E_n = 0\nY(π/2) = D_n * sin(n√(3/2)(π/2)) = 0\n\nSince D_n cannot be zero, we must have sin(n√(3/2)(π/2)) = 0. This implies that n√(3/2) = m, where m is an integer. Therefore, n = (2/3)m^2, and the solution for Y(y) becomes:\n\nY(y) = D_m * sin((2/3)m^2y)\n\nNow, the general solution for u(x, y, t) is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑[A_n * e^(-3n^2t) * sin(nx) * sin((2/3)n^2y)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = sin(x) + 2y:\n\nsin(x) + 2y = ∑[A_n * sin(nx) * sin((2/3)n^2y)]\n\nUsing Fourier series, we can find the coefficients A_n:\n\nA_n = (2/π) * ∫[sin(x) * sin(nx) * sin((2/3)n^2y) dx] dy from 0 to π/2\n\nSince the initial condition does not depend on y, we can separate the y part:\n\nA_n = (2/π) * ∫[sin(x) * sin(nx) dx] * ∫[sin((2/3)n^2y) dy] from 0 to π/2\n\nThe first integral can be solved using integration by parts or using the orthogonality property of sine functions. The second integral is zero for all n except when n = 1. Therefore, the only non-zero coefficient is A_1:\n\nA_1 = (2/π) * ∫[sin(x) * sin(x) dx] from 0 to π\n\nA_1 = (2/π) * [π/2] = 1\n\nThus, the temperature distribution u(x, y, t) at time t = 1 is:\n\nu(x, y, 1) = e^(-3) * sin(x) * sin((2/3)y)"
