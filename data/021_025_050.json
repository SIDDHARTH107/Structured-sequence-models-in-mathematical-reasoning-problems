    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to optimize its production process to minimize costs. The cost function is given by C = 2000 + 100x + 20y, where x represents the number of machine hours and y represents the number of labor hours. The company has a total of 500 machine hours and 300 labor hours available per day. Using the Whale Optimization Algorithm, what is the minimum cost the company can achieve by allocating its resources to machine and labor hours?",
    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of humpback whales. It is used to solve complex optimization problems. However, the problem presented here can be solved using linear programming, which is more appropriate for this type of problem.\n\nLet's formulate the problem as a linear programming problem:\n\nObjective function: Minimize C = 2000 + 100x + 20y\n\nConstraints:\n1. x <= 500 (machine hours constraint)\n2. y <= 300 (labor hours constraint)\n3. x >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n4. y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we can solve the linear programming problem using the graphical method or any linear programming solver.\n\nThe feasible region is a rectangle with vertices (0,0), (500,0), (0,300), and (500,300). We need to evaluate the objective function at each of these vertices to find the minimum cost.\n\n1. C(0,0) = 2000 + 100(0) + 20(0) = 2000\n2. C(500,0) = 2000 + 100(500) + 20(0) = 52,000\n3. C(0,300) = 2000 + 100(0) + 20(300) = 8,000\n4. C(500,300) = 2000 + 100(500) + 20(300) = 58,000\n\nThe minimum cost is achieved at the vertex (0,300), with a cost of $8,000. Therefore, the company should allocate all its resources to labor hours to minimize the cost."
