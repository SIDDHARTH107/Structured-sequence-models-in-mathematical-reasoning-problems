    "message_2": "To find the second Chern class $c_2$ in terms of $a$ and $b$, we can use the Chern polynomial. For a complex manifold, the total Chern class is given by:\n\n$$\nc(T) = 1 + c_1 + c_2 + \\cdots\n$$\n\nThe Chern polynomial is given by:\n\n$$\nc(T) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (1 + x_i)\n$$\n\nwhere $x_i$ are the Chern roots of the manifold. For a complex manifold of complex dimension $n$, we have:\n\n$$\nc_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_2 = \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n} x_i x_j\n$$\n\nGiven that $c_1 = 4a + 2b$, we can write:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 4a + 2b\n$$\n\nHowever, without more information about the manifold, such as its complex dimension or the specific form of the cohomology classes $a$ and $b$, we cannot determine the exact expression for $c_2$ in terms of $a$ and $b$. The second Chern class $c_2$ depends on the specific structure of the manifold and its Chern roots."
