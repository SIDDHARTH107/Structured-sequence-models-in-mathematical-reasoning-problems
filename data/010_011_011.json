    "message_2": "To determine the number of connected components in the space of smooth functions from M to ℝ, we will use the concept of homotopy.\n\nTwo smooth functions f, g: M → ℝ are homotopic if there exists a continuous function H: M × [0, 1] → ℝ such that H(x, 0) = f(x) and H(x, 1) = g(x) for all x in M. If two functions are homotopic, they belong to the same connected component.\n\nNow, let f, g: M → ℝ be any two smooth functions. Define the homotopy H: M × [0, 1] → ℝ by H(x, t) = (1 - t)f(x) + tg(x) for all x in M and t in [0, 1]. This function is continuous in both x and t, and satisfies H(x, 0) = f(x) and H(x, 1) = g(x) for all x in M.\n\nThus, any two smooth functions from M to ℝ are homotopic, and therefore belong to the same connected component. This implies that the space of smooth functions from M to ℝ has only one connected component."
