    "message_2": "Mori theory is not the appropriate method to find the equation of a line passing through two points in the projective plane. Instead, we can use the standard method for finding the equation of a line in the projective plane.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given points to homogeneous coordinates. Let's denote the homogeneous coordinates as (X:Y:Z). For the given points (2, -1) and (4, 3), we can choose Z = 1. So, the homogeneous coordinates are (2:-1:1) and (4:3:1).\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the line passing through these two points in the projective plane. The equation of a line in the projective plane can be represented as aX + bY + cZ = 0. To find the coefficients a, b, and c, we can use the cross product of the homogeneous coordinates of the two points:\n\n(2:-1:1) Ã— (4:3:1) = (a:b:c)\n\nComputing the cross product, we get:\n\na = (-1 - 3) = -4\nb = (2 - 4) = -2\nc = (6 - 4) = 2\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (2, -1) and (4, 3) in the projective plane is:\n\n-4X - 2Y + 2Z = 0"
