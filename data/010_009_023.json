    "message_2": "To maximize the number of non-overlapping triangles inside the regular n-gon, we can use the process of triangulation. Triangulation involves connecting non-adjacent vertices with non-intersecting line segments to divide the polygon into triangles.\n\nFor an n-gon, we can form a triangle by selecting any three non-adjacent vertices. After forming the first triangle, we are left with an (n-1)-gon. We can continue this process until we are left with a triangle.\n\nIn general, an n-gon can be divided into (n-2) non-overlapping triangles. This can be seen by considering that each time we form a triangle, we reduce the number of sides of the polygon by 1. We can continue this process until we are left with a triangle (3-gon), which requires (n-2) steps.\n\nSo, the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed inside a regular n-gon using triangulation is (n-2)."
