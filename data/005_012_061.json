They take a random sample of 30 bars and weigh them, obtaining a mean weight of 2.5 ounces with a standard deviation of 0.2 ounces. Find a 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the chocolate bars.",
    "message_2": "To find a 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the chocolate bars, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, t is the t-score associated with the desired confidence level (95% in this case), s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score for a 95% confidence interval with 29 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29). Using a t-table or calculator, we find that the t-score is approximately 2.045.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 2.5 ± (2.045 * (0.2 / √30))\n\nCI = 2.5 ± (2.045 * (0.2 / 5.477))\n\nCI = 2.5 ± (2.045 * 0.0365)\n\nCI = 2.5 ± 0.0746\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the chocolate bars is approximately (2.4254, 2.5746) ounces."
