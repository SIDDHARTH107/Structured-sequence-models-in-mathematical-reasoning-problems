    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is connected or not, we can use the fact that a graph with n vertices is connected if it has at least (n-1) edges and the edges form a connected structure.\n\nIn this case, G has 7 vertices, so it needs at least (7-1) = 6 edges to be connected. Since G has 9 edges, which is more than the minimum required, it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, we cannot definitively say that the graph is connected without knowing the specific arrangement of the edges.\n\nIn conclusion, the graph G with 7 vertices and 9 edges could be connected, but we cannot determine this for certain without more information about the arrangement of the edges."
