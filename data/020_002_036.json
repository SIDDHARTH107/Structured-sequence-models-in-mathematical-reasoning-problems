    "message_1": "An agricultural company needs to maximize their profit by determining the optimal amount of corn and soybeans to plant on a 20-acre farm. The company earns a profit of $300 per acre of corn and $200 per acre of soybeans. The company has a total budget of $12,000 for planting and maintenance, and the farm can produce a maximum of 10 acres of corn and 14 acres of soybeans due to soil and weather conditions. \n\nWhat is the optimal number of acres of corn and soybeans that the company should plant to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of corn and y be the number of acres of soybeans. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 300x + 200y, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 20 (total acreage constraint)\n2. x ≤ 10 (maximum corn acreage constraint)\n3. y ≤ 14 (maximum soybean acreage constraint)\n4. x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nWe can use the method of linear programming to solve this problem. First, let's graph the feasible region defined by the constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 20 is the equation of a line with slope -1 and y-intercept 20. The inequality x + y ≤ 20 represents the area below this line.\n2. x = 10 is a vertical line, and x ≤ 10 represents the area to the left of this line.\n3. y = 14 is a horizontal line, and y ≤ 14 represents the area below this line.\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 14), (10, 10), and (10, 0). We will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 300(0) + 200(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 14) = 300(0) + 200(14) = $2,800\n3. P(10, 10) = 300(10) + 200(10) = $5,000\n4. P(10, 0) = 300(10) + 200(0) = $3,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (10, 10), with a profit of $5,000. Therefore, the company should plant 10 acres of corn and 10 acres of soybeans to maximize their profit."
