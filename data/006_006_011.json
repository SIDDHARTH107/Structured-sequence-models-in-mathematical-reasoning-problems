    "message_1": "In a basketball game, a player has a free throw shooting percentage of 80%. If they are given two free throws, what is the probability that they will make both shots?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of making both free throws, we multiply the probability of making each shot. Since the player has an 80% free throw shooting percentage, the probability of making each shot is 0.8.\n\nProbability of making both shots = (Probability of making first shot) * (Probability of making second shot)\n= 0.8 * 0.8\n= 0.64\n\nSo, the probability of making both free throws is 0.64 or 64%."
