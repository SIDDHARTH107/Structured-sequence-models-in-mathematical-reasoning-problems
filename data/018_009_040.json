    "message_2": "To show that (A × B) × C = A × (B × C), we will first find the Cartesian products for each side of the equation and then compare the resulting sets.\n\nFirst, let's find (A × B) × C:\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A × B) with C:\n(A × B) × C = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 5), 6), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 5), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 5), 6)}\n\nNext, let's find A × (B × C):\nB × C = {(4, 6), (5, 6)}\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A with (B × C):\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (5, 6)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (5, 6))}\n\nNow, let's compare the resulting sets:\n(A × B) × C = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 5), 6), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 5), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 5), 6)}\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (5, 6)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (5, 6))}\n\nWe can see that both sets have the same number of elements and each element in one set has a corresponding element in the other set with the same components. Therefore, we can conclude that (A × B) × C = A × (B × C)."
