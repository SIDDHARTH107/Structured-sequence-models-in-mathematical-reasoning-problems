If the local trivialization of $E$ is given by $U_1=(-\\epsilon,\\epsilon)\\times \\mathbb{S}^1$ and $U_2=(-\\epsilon,\\epsilon)\\times \\mathbb{S}^1$ with the transition function $g: U_1\\cap U_2\\rightarrow GL(1,\\mathbb{R})$ given by $g(t,\\theta)=-[\\begin{matrix} 1 & 0  \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{matrix}]$ for $t>0$, then what is the first Stiefel-Whitney class of $E$?",
    "message_2": "The first Stiefel-Whitney class, denoted by $w_1(E)$, is an element of the first cohomology group $H^1(\\mathbb{S}^1; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$. It is defined using the transition functions of the vector bundle.\n\nIn this case, the transition function $g(t, \\theta)$ is given by the matrix $-[\\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{matrix}]$. Since the determinant of this matrix is 1, it is an element of $GL(1, \\mathbb{R})$. However, the first Stiefel-Whitney class is defined using the mod 2 reduction of the transition functions, so we need to consider the mod 2 reduction of the determinant.\n\nThe determinant of the matrix is 1, and its mod 2 reduction is 1. Therefore, the first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_1(E)$ is nontrivial and equal to the generator of $H^1(\\mathbb{S}^1; \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$."
