    "message_1": "A school wants to divide 20 students into four groups of five students each for a class activity. How many different ways can the school create these four groups? (Hint: This problem involves combinatorial calculations using the concept of block designs.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of combinations. A combination is a selection of items from a larger set, such that the order of the items does not matter.\n\nFirst, we will find the number of ways to select the first group of 5 students from the 20 students. This can be done using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to be selected, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120).\n\nFor the first group, n = 20 and k = 5:\n\nC(20, 5) = 20! / (5!(20-5)!) = 20! / (5!15!) = 15,504\n\nNow, we have 15 students left. We will find the number of ways to select the second group of 5 students from the remaining 15 students:\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5!(15-5)!) = 15! / (5!10!) = 3,003\n\nNext, we have 10 students left. We will find the number of ways to select the third group of 5 students from the remaining 10 students:\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!) = 10! / (5!5!) = 252\n\nFinally, we have 5 students left, and they will form the last group. There is only 1 way to select the last group of 5 students from the remaining 5 students:\n\nC(5, 5) = 5! / (5!(5-5)!) = 5! / (5!0!) = 1\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to select each group together. However, since the order of the groups does not matter, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 4 groups, which is 4!:\n\nTotal ways = (15,504 × 3,003 × 252 × 1) / 4! = (15,504 × 3,003 × 252) / 24 = 12,690,960 / 24 = 529,207\n\nSo, there are 529,207 different ways to create the four groups of 5 students each."
