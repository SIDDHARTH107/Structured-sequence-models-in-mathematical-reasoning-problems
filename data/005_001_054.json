    "message_1": "A student wants to know whether the mean IQ score of students at a school is significantly different from the national average of 100. The student collects a sample of 36 students from the school and finds their average IQ score to be 108.2 with a standard deviation of 12.5. Can the student conclude at 5% significance level that the school's average IQ score is significantly different from the national average? Perform a hypothesis test and state your conclusion.",
    "message_2": "To perform a hypothesis test, we will use a two-tailed t-test since we are looking for a significant difference in either direction (higher or lower) from the national average.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): The school's average IQ score is equal to the national average (µ = 100).\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The school's average IQ score is significantly different from the national average (µ ≠ 100).\n\nStep 2: Determine the level of significance.\nThe significance level is given as 5% (α = 0.05).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic.\nWe will use the t-test formula: t = (x̄ - µ) / (s / √n)\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, µ is the population mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nt = (108.2 - 100) / (12.5 / √36)\nt = 8.2 / (12.5 / 6)\nt = 8.2 / 2.083\nt ≈ 3.935\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value.\nSince we are using a two-tailed test with α = 0.05 and 36 - 1 = 35 degrees of freedom, we can look up the critical value in a t-distribution table or use a calculator. The critical value for a two-tailed test with 35 degrees of freedom and α = 0.05 is approximately 2.030.\n\nStep 5: Compare the test statistic to the critical value and make a decision.\nOur test statistic (t ≈ 3.935) is greater than the critical value (2.030), so we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nAt a 5% significance level, we can conclude that the school's average IQ score is significantly different from the national average."
