    "message_1": "Suppose vector A has components (3, -1, 7) and vector B has components (-2, 4, 1). Find the cross product of vectors A and B using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = (AyBz - AzBy, AzBx - AxBz, AxBy - AyBx)\n\nwhere A = (Ax, Ay, Az) and B = (Bx, By, Bz).\n\nGiven A = (3, -1, 7) and B = (-2, 4, 1), we can find the cross product as follows:\n\nA x B = ((-1)(1) - (7)(4), (7)(-2) - (3)(1), (3)(4) - (-1)(-2))\nA x B = (-1 - 28, -14 - 3, 12 - 2)\nA x B = (-29, -17, 10)\n\nSo, the cross product of vectors A and B is (-29, -17, 10). Note that we didn't use trigonometry to solve this problem, as the cross product can be found directly using the given components of the vectors."
