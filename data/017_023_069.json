    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 72: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2.\n2. Determine the possible divisors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n3. Use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups.\n\nFor p = 2 (Sylow 2-subgroups):\n- The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2).\n  The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9.\n\nFor p = 3 (Sylow 3-subgroups):\n- The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^3 = 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\n  The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1:\n   There is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup, which implies that the group is cyclic and isomorphic to Z_72.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4:\n   There is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, which implies that the group is a semidirect product of the form (Z_8 ⋊ Z_9). There are two non-isomorphic groups in this case: one is the direct product Z_8 × Z_9 (which is isomorphic to Z_72), and the other is a non-abelian group.\n\n3. n_2 = 9, n_3 = 1:\n   There is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, which implies that the group is a semidirect product of the form (Z_2^3 ⋊ Z_9). There are three non-isomorphic groups in this case: one is the direct product Z_2^3 × Z_9 (which is isomorphic to Z_8 × Z_9), and the other two are non-abelian groups.\n\n4. n_2 = 9, n_3 = 4:\n   Both Sylow subgroups have more than one conjugate, so we cannot determine the group structure directly. However, we can use the fact that there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, which means there are at least 1 + 9 + 4 = 14 distinct subgroups. Since a group of order 72 can have at most 72/2 = 36 subgroups, there must be at least one more non-isomorphic group in this case.\n\nIn total, we have found 1 (cyclic) + 1 (n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4) + 2 (n_2 = 9, n_3 = 1) + 1 (n_2 = 9, n_3 = 4) = 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
