    "message_2": "To evaluate the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 4x + 3)/(x - 3) as x approaches 3, we first try to simplify the function.\n\nWe can factor the numerator:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the function can be rewritten as:\n\nf(x) = ((x - 1)(x - 3))/(x - 3)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the (x - 3) terms in the numerator and denominator:\n\nf(x) = x - 1\n\nNow that the function is simplified, we can find the limit as x approaches 3:\n\nlim (x -> 3) (x - 1) = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) as x approaches 3 is 2."
