    "message_1": "A sound wave is represented by the equation y = 3cos(2x - pi/3). What is the phase shift of the wave?",
    "message_2": "The general equation for a cosine function is y = A*cos(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn the given equation, y = 3cos(2x - pi/3), we can see that A = 3, B = 2, and C = pi/3. There is no vertical shift, so D = 0.\n\nThe phase shift of the wave is C, which is pi/3."
