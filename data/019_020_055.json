    "message_2": "The Davis-Putnam algorithm, also known as the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm, is a backtracking-based search algorithm for solving the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). The running time of the DPLL algorithm depends on the structure of the input formula and the heuristics used in the algorithm.\n\nIn the worst case, the DPLL algorithm has to explore all possible assignments of the n variables, which results in a running time of O(2^n). However, in practice, the algorithm can often solve SAT instances much faster due to the pruning of the search space and the use of heuristics.\n\nThe parameter c, which represents the maximum number of clauses that share the same literal, can also have an impact on the running time of the algorithm. If c is large, it means that many clauses share the same literal, which can lead to more efficient unit propagation and more effective pruning of the search space. In this case, the running time of the algorithm can be significantly reduced.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to provide a precise running time of the DPLL algorithm in terms of n, m, and c, as it depends on the specific structure of the input formula and the heuristics used in the algorithm. In general, the running time can be bounded by O(2^n), but it can be much faster in practice, especially for instances with a large c value."
