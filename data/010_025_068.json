    "message_1": "Consider the topological quantum field theory known as Chern-Simons theory, defined on a closed oriented 3-manifold. Let  $G$ be a compact Lie group and $\\mathfrak{g}$ its Lie algebra. Suppose the Chern-Simons level $k$ is a positive integer. \n\nWrite down the formula for the Chern-Simons partition function for this theory on a three-torus with the gauge group $G=SU(N)$ and level $k=5$. Calculate the partition function for $N=2$.",
    "message_2": "The Chern-Simons partition function for a three-torus with gauge group $G=SU(N)$ and level $k$ is given by the following formula:\n\n$$Z_{SU(N)}(T^3, k) = \\frac{1}{(N!)^2} \\sum_{R} \\frac{\\dim_q(R)^2}{\\dim_q(0)}$$\n\nHere, the sum is over all irreducible representations $R$ of the gauge group $SU(N)$, $\\dim_q(R)$ is the quantum dimension of the representation $R$, and $\\dim_q(0)$ is the quantum dimension of the trivial representation.\n\nFor $G=SU(2)$ and $k=5$, the irreducible representations are labeled by non-negative integers $j = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The quantum dimension of the representation with spin $j$ is given by:\n\n$$\\dim_q(j) = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi(2j+1)/(k+2))}{\\sin(\\pi/(k+2))}$$\n\nFor the trivial representation, $j=0$, we have $\\dim_q(0) = 1$. Therefore, the Chern-Simons partition function for $SU(2)$ and $k=5$ is:\n\n$$Z_{SU(2)}(T^3, 5) = \\frac{1}{(2!)^2} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\dim_q(j)^2}{\\dim_q(0)}$$\n\nHowever, since the level $k=5$, we only need to consider representations with $j \\leq k/2 = 2.5$. Thus, the sum is over $j = 0, 1, 2$:\n\n$$Z_{SU(2)}(T^3, 5) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{\\dim_q(0)^2}{\\dim_q(0)} + \\frac{\\dim_q(1)^2}{\\dim_q(0)} + \\frac{\\dim_q(2)^2}{\\dim_q(0)} \\right)$$\n\nNow, we can compute the quantum dimensions for $j=1$ and $j=2$:\n\n$$\\dim_q(1) = \\frac{\\sin(3\\pi/7)}{\\sin(\\pi/7)}$$\n$$\\dim_q(2) = \\frac{\\sin(5\\pi/7)}{\\sin(\\pi/7)}$$\n\nPlugging these values into the partition function formula, we get:\n\n$$Z_{SU(2)}(T^3, 5) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 1 + \\left(\\frac{\\sin(3\\pi/7)}{\\sin(\\pi/7)}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sin(5\\pi/7)}{\\sin(\\pi/7)}\\right)^2 \\right)$$\n\nEvaluating the trigonometric functions, we find:\n\n$$Z_{SU(2)}(T^3, 5) \\approx \\frac{1}{4} (1 + 3.73205^2 + 3.73205^2) \\approx 13.931$$\n\nThus, the Chern-Simons partition function for $SU(2)$ and $k=5$ on a three-torus is approximately $13.931$."
