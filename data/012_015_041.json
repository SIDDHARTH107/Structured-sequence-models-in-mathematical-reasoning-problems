    "message_1": "Consider an undirected graph G with 10 vertices and 20 edges. Determine the number of connected components in G.",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of connected components in G, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices has at least n-1 edges. Since G has 10 vertices, a connected graph with all 10 vertices would have at least 9 edges. However, G has 20 edges, which is more than the minimum required for a connected graph with 10 vertices.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of having two connected components in G. If there are two connected components, one of them must have at least 2 vertices, and the other must have at least 8 vertices. The connected component with 2 vertices would have at least 1 edge, and the connected component with 8 vertices would have at least 7 edges. This would give us a total of 1 + 7 = 8 edges, which is less than the 20 edges we have in G.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that G has one connected component, which includes all 10 vertices and 20 edges."
