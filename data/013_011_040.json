    "message_1": "Two companies, A and B, compete to sell a product that costs $100. The companies have identical costs of production, which are $50 per unit. They use different pricing strategies:\n\n- Company A charges a price equal to its costs plus a markup of k percent.\n- Company B charges a lower price, equal to its costs plus a markup of k/2 percent.\n\nWhat value of k would make both companies earn equal profits?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the price charged by Company A as P_A and the price charged by Company B as P_B. We are given that:\n\nP_A = 50 + 0.01 * k * 50\nP_B = 50 + 0.01 * (k/2) * 50\n\nLet's denote the quantity sold by Company A as Q_A and the quantity sold by Company B as Q_B. Since both companies sell the same product, we can assume that the total quantity sold in the market is fixed, say Q. Then, we have:\n\nQ_A + Q_B = Q\n\nNow, let's denote the profit earned by Company A as π_A and the profit earned by Company B as π_B. We have:\n\nπ_A = (P_A - 50) * Q_A\nπ_B = (P_B - 50) * Q_B\n\nWe are asked to find the value of k that makes both companies earn equal profits, i.e., π_A = π_B. Substituting the expressions for P_A, P_B, and Q_B, we get:\n\n(50 + 0.01 * k * 50 - 50) * Q_A = (50 + 0.01 * (k/2) * 50 - 50) * (Q - Q_A)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n0.01 * k * 50 * Q_A = 0.01 * (k/2) * 50 * (Q - Q_A)\n\nDividing both sides by 0.01 * 50, we get:\n\nk * Q_A = (k/2) * (Q - Q_A)\n\nNow, we can solve for k:\n\nk * Q_A = (k/2) * Q - (k/2) * Q_A\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n2 * k * Q_A = k * Q - k * Q_A\n\nAdding k * Q_A to both sides, we get:\n\n3 * k * Q_A = k * Q\n\nDividing both sides by k * Q_A, we get:\n\n3 = Q / Q_A\n\nSince Q_A and Q are both positive, we can conclude that Q_A = Q / 3. This means that Company A sells one-third of the total quantity in the market, while Company B sells the remaining two-thirds.\n\nNow, we can find the value of k that makes both companies earn equal profits. We know that:\n\nπ_A = π_B\n(P_A - 50) * Q_A = (P_B - 50) * Q_B\n\nSubstituting the expressions for P_A, P_B, Q_A, and Q_B, we get:\n\n(0.01 * k * 50) * (Q / 3) = (0.01 * (k/2) * 50) * (2 * Q / 3)\n\nDividing both sides by 0.01 * 50 * Q, we get:\n\nk / 3 = k / 6\n\nMultiplying both sides by 6, we get:\n\n2 * k = k\n\nThis implies that k = 0. However, this would mean that both companies are selling the product at their cost price, which is not a markup. Therefore, there is no value of k that would make both companies earn equal profits while maintaining their respective pricing strategies."
