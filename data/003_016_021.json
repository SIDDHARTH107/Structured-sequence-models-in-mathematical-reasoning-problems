    "message_2": "We are given the function h(t) = A sin(ωt + φ) and we need to find the phase shift, which is related to the constant φ. Let's use the data points given to determine the values of A, ω, and φ.\n\nFrom the data points, we can see that the height is maximum at t = 0.50 s, which is 1.0 m. So, the amplitude A = 1.0 m.\n\nNow, let's use the data points (0, 0) and (0.25, 0.5) to find ω and φ.\n\n1. For t = 0 and h(t) = 0:\n0 = A sin(ω * 0 + φ)\n0 = 1.0 sin(φ)\n\nSince sin(φ) = 0, φ can be 0 or π.\n\n2. For t = 0.25 and h(t) = 0.5:\n0.5 = A sin(ω * 0.25 + φ)\n0.5 = 1.0 sin(0.25ω + φ)\n\nNow, let's consider the two cases for φ:\n\nCase 1: φ = 0\n0.5 = sin(0.25ω)\nω = 4 * arcsin(0.5)\nω = 4 * (π/6)\nω = 2π/3\n\nCase 2: φ = π\n0.5 = sin(0.25ω + π)\nω = 4 * (arcsin(0.5) - π)\nω = 4 * (-π/6)\nω = -2π/3\n\nSince ω must be positive (angular frequency), we discard Case 2. So, we have ω = 2π/3 and φ = 0.\n\nThe phase shift is given by the formula: phase shift = -φ/ω\n\nphase shift = -0 / (2π/3) = 0\n\nThe phase shift of the function is 0 seconds."
