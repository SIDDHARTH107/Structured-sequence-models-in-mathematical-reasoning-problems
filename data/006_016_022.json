    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a product having a certain type of defect is 0.05. If the company wants a batch of 2000 products to have no more than 100 defective items, what is the probability of meeting this goal?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of products in the batch, which is 2000)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of defective items, which we want to be no more than 100)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a product having a defect, which is 0.05)\n- (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nWe want to find the probability of having 0 to 100 defective items in the batch of 2000 products. To do this, we can sum the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 100:\n\nP(X ≤ 100) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 100\n\nCalculating this sum:\n\nP(X ≤ 100) = Σ (2000 choose k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(2000-k) for k = 0 to 100\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute this sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≤ 100) ≈ 0.0288\n\nSo, the probability of having no more than 100 defective items in a batch of 2000 products is approximately 2.88%."
