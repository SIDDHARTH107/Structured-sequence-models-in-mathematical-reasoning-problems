    "message_1": "A vibrating system's displacement is given by the function x(t) = 5cos(2πt) + 3sin(8πt). Determine the frequency and amplitude of each component using the Fourier transform, and hence determine whether the system is stable or not.",
    "message_2": "The given function x(t) is already in the form of a sum of sinusoidal functions, so we don't need to apply the Fourier transform to find the frequency and amplitude of each component. We can directly read the amplitude and frequency from the given function.\n\nThe function x(t) = 5cos(2πt) + 3sin(8πt) has two components:\n\n1. Component 1: 5cos(2πt)\n   Amplitude: 5\n   Frequency: 2π (in radians) or 1 Hz (in Hertz)\n\n2. Component 2: 3sin(8πt)\n   Amplitude: 3\n   Frequency: 8π (in radians) or 4 Hz (in Hertz)\n\nNow, let's determine the stability of the system. A system is considered stable if its displacement remains bounded as time progresses. In this case, both components are sinusoidal functions, which are bounded functions. Therefore, the sum of these two components will also be a bounded function.\n\nHence, the system is stable."
