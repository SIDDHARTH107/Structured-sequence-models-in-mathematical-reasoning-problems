    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin²(x) - 3cos(x) = 0, we can use the identity sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1. \n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation in terms of sin(x) or cos(x). We can express sin²(x) as 1 - cos²(x) using the identity:\n\n2(1 - cos²(x)) - 3cos(x) = 0\n\nNow, distribute the 2:\n\n2 - 2cos²(x) - 3cos(x) = 0\n\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation in terms of cos(x):\n\n2cos²(x) + 3cos(x) - 2 = 0\n\nNow, we can try to factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(2cos(x) - 1)(cos(x) + 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible cases:\n\n1) 2cos(x) - 1 = 0\n   2cos(x) = 1\n   cos(x) = 1/2\n\n2) cos(x) + 2 = 0\n   cos(x) = -2\n\nFor case 1, we can find the values of x:\n\ncos(x) = 1/2\nx = arccos(1/2)\nx = π/3, 5π/3 (since x is between 0 and 2π radians)\n\nFor case 2, there is no solution because the cosine function has a range of -1 to 1, and -2 is outside of this range.\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = π/3, 5π/3"
