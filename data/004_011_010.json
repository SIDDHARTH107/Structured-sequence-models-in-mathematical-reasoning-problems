    "message_2": "Let x be the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall, and y be the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. We are given that the ladder is 10 meters long, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate x and y:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n\nWe are also given that the base of the ladder is being pulled away from the wall at a rate of 2 meters per second, so dx/dt = 2 m/s. We want to find dy/dt, the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall, when x = 6 meters.\n\nTo find dy/dt, we can differentiate the equation x^2 + y^2 = 10^2 with respect to time t:\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = d(10^2)/dt\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow we can plug in the given values and solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(6)(2) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWhen x = 6 meters, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the value of y:\n\n6^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n36 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 64\ny = 8\n\nNow we can plug in the value of y and solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(6)(2) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0\n24 + 16(dy/dt) = 0\n16(dy/dt) = -24\ndy/dt = -24/16\ndy/dt = -3/2\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of -3/2 meters per second, or 1.5 meters per second downward, when the base is 6 meters from the wall."
