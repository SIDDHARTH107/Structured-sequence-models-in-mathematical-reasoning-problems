    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using a transposition cipher where the columns are reversed, we first need to write the message in a grid format. Since the message has 11 characters, we can use a grid with 3 rows and 4 columns, filling in the extra space with a placeholder character (e.g., X):\n\nH E L L\nO W O R\nL D X X\n\nNow, we reverse the columns:\n\nL L E H\nR O W O\nX X D L\n\nFinally, we read the encrypted message row by row:\n\nLLEHROWOXDX\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"LLEHROWOXDX\"."
