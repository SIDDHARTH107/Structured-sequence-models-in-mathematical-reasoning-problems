Alice chooses Bob's public key to be y = 37. Alice wants to encrypt the message m = 20. \n\na) Find Alice's public key (A = α^d mod p).\nb) Use Bob's public key and the ElGamal encryption algorithm to encrypt m and obtain the ciphertext (c1, c2).\nc) Use Alice's private key and the ElGamal decryption algorithm to decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the original message m.",
    "message_2": "a) To find Alice's public key A, we need to compute A = α^d mod p. In this case, α = 5, d = 10, and p = 47.\n\nA = 5^10 mod 47\nA = 9765625 mod 47\nA = 32\n\nSo, Alice's public key A is 32.\n\nb) To encrypt the message m = 20 using Bob's public key y = 37, Alice needs to choose a random number k (let's say k = 3) and compute the ciphertext (c1, c2) as follows:\n\nc1 = α^k mod p = 5^3 mod 47 = 125 mod 47 = 31\nc2 = (m * y^k) mod p = (20 * 37^3) mod 47 = (20 * 50653) mod 47 = 1013060 mod 47 = 38\n\nSo, the ciphertext (c1, c2) is (31, 38).\n\nc) To decrypt the ciphertext (c1, c2) and obtain the original message m, Alice needs to use her private key d = 10 and the ElGamal decryption algorithm:\n\nm = (c2 * (c1^d)^(-1)) mod p\nm = (38 * (31^10)^(-1)) mod 47\n\nFirst, let's compute the inverse of 31^10 mod 47:\n31^10 mod 47 = 819628286980801 mod 47 = 15\nNow, we need to find the inverse of 15 mod 47. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the inverse:\n\n15 * x ≡ 1 (mod 47)\n15 * 19 ≡ 1 (mod 47)\n\nSo, the inverse of 15 mod 47 is 19.\n\nNow, we can compute the original message m:\nm = (38 * 19) mod 47 = 722 mod 47 = 20\n\nThe decrypted message m is 20, which is the original message Alice wanted to send to Bob."
