    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a right circular cone, we need to find the area of the base and the area of the lateral surface, and then add them together.\n\nThe base of the cone is a circle with a radius of 6 cm. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius. So, the area of the base is:\n\nA_base = π(6 cm)² = 36π cm²\n\nThe lateral surface of the cone is a sector of a circle with a radius equal to the slant height (10 cm) and an arc length equal to the circumference of the base. The circumference of the base is given by the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. So, the circumference of the base is:\n\nC_base = 2π(6 cm) = 12π cm\n\nNow, we can find the area of the sector that forms the lateral surface. The area of a sector is given by the formula A_sector = (1/2) * r * l, where A_sector is the area of the sector, r is the radius (slant height), and l is the arc length (circumference of the base). So, the area of the lateral surface is:\n\nA_lateral = (1/2) * (10 cm) * (12π cm) = 60π cm²\n\nFinally, we can find the total surface area of the cone by adding the area of the base and the area of the lateral surface:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral = 36π cm² + 60π cm² = 96π cm²\n\nTo get the surface area rounded to two decimal places, we can multiply 96π by the value of π (approximately 3.14):\n\nA_total ≈ 96 * 3.14 cm² ≈ 301.44 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 301.44 cm², rounded to two decimal places."
