    "message_2": "Let's use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In other words:\n\nΣ(deg(v)) = 2 * |E|\n\nwhere deg(v) is the degree of vertex v, and |E| is the number of edges.\n\nIn this problem, we have 10 vertices, and each vertex has a degree of at least 3. So, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is at least 10 * 3 = 30.\n\nNow, let's use the Handshaking Lemma:\n\nΣ(deg(v)) ≥ 30 = 2 * |E|\n\nThis implies that:\n\n|E| ≥ 30 / 2 = 15\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges such a graph must have is 15."
