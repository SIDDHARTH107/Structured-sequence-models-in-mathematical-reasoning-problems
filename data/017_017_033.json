    "message_2": "The dihedral group D15 has order 2 * 15 = 30, which matches the given order of the group. The dihedral group Dn consists of symmetries of a regular n-sided polygon, including n rotations and n reflections.\n\nIn the dihedral group D15, the center of the group consists of the identity element (the rotation by 0 degrees) and the 180-degree rotation. This is because these are the only two elements that commute with all other elements in the group.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements in the center of a group of order 30 that is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15 is 2."
