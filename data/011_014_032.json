    "message_2": "Let's consider each person and their connections. Since each person is connected to exactly 4 other people, there are 4 connections per person. With 10 people in the network, there would initially appear to be 10 * 4 = 40 connections.\n\nHowever, we need to keep in mind that each connection is shared between two people. Therefore, we have counted each connection twice. To get the actual number of connections, we need to divide the result by 2.\n\nSo, the total number of connections in the network is 40 / 2 = 20 connections."
