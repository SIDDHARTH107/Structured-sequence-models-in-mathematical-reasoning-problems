    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 inches, a width of 4 inches, and a height of 3 inches. What is the length of the longest possible diagonal of the rectangular prism in inches?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the longest possible diagonal of the rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nPlugging in the given dimensions:\n\nDiagonal length = √(6² + 4² + 3²)\nDiagonal length = √(36 + 16 + 9)\nDiagonal length = √61\n\nThe length of the longest possible diagonal of the rectangular prism is √61 inches, which is approximately 7.81 inches."
