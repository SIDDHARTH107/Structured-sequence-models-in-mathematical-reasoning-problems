    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least 4 heads in 6 coin flips, we need to consider the cases where we get 4, 5, or 6 heads.\n\n1. Probability of getting exactly 4 heads:\nThere are 6 choose 4 (6C4) ways to get 4 heads, which is 15. The probability of each combination is (1/2)^6, since there are 6 coin flips, and each flip has a 1/2 chance of being heads or tails. So, the probability of getting exactly 4 heads is 15 * (1/2)^6 = 15/64.\n\n2. Probability of getting exactly 5 heads:\nThere are 6 choose 5 (6C5) ways to get 5 heads, which is 6. The probability of each combination is (1/2)^6. So, the probability of getting exactly 5 heads is 6 * (1/2)^6 = 6/64.\n\n3. Probability of getting exactly 6 heads:\nThere is only 1 way to get 6 heads (all flips are heads). The probability of this happening is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of these three cases to find the probability of getting at least 4 heads:\n\nP(at least 4 heads) = P(4 heads) + P(5 heads) + P(6 heads) = 15/64 + 6/64 + 1/64 = 22/64.\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nP(at least 4 heads) = 11/32.\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 4 heads in 6 coin flips is 11/32."
