    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n\nThis means that the two equations are actually the same, and they represent the same line. In this case, there are infinitely many solutions, and the system is dependent. We can express the solution in terms of one variable. Let's solve for y in terms of x:\n\n3y = 8 - 2x\ny = (8 - 2x)/3\n\nSo, the solution can be expressed as an ordered pair (x, (8 - 2x)/3) for any value of x."
