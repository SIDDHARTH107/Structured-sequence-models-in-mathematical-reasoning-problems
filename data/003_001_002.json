    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 10cm and one of its angles measures 30 degrees. What are the lengths of the other two sides (in cm)?",
    "message_2": "Let's call the side opposite the 30-degree angle \"a\" and the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle \"b\". We can use the sine and cosine functions to find the lengths of these sides.\n\nsin(30) = a / 10\ncos(30) = b / 10\n\nsin(30) = 1/2, so:\n\n1/2 = a / 10\na = 10 * 1/2\na = 5 cm\n\ncos(30) = √3/2, so:\n\n√3/2 = b / 10\nb = 10 * √3/2\nb = 5√3 cm\n\nSo, the lengths of the other two sides are 5 cm and 5√3 cm."
