    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can help you understand the process of AES encryption, but I cannot perform the actual encryption myself. AES encryption is a complex process that requires specialized software or programming libraries to execute. However, I can guide you through the steps involved in the encryption process.\n\n1. Key Expansion: Expand the 128-bit key into an array of key schedule words.\n\n2. Initial Round:\n   a. AddRoundKey: XOR the plaintext with the first round key.\n\n3. Main Rounds (9 rounds for 128-bit key):\n   a. SubBytes: Substitute each byte of the state with a corresponding byte from the S-box.\n   b. ShiftRows: Shift the rows of the state array.\n   c. MixColumns: Mix the columns of the state array.\n   d. AddRoundKey: XOR the state with the round key.\n\n4. Final Round (no MixColumns):\n   a. SubBytes\n   b. ShiftRows\n   c. AddRoundKey\n\n5. CBC Mode: XOR the output of the AES encryption with the IV (11110000) for the first block, and with the previous ciphertext block for the subsequent blocks.\n\nTo perform the actual encryption, you can use a programming language like Python with a library such as PyCryptodome, or an online AES encryption tool. Make sure to input the plaintext, key, and IV in the correct format (binary or hexadecimal) as required by the tool or library you use. The output ciphertext will be in hexadecimal format."
