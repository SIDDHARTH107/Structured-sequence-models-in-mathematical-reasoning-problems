    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of the sets A and B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the Cartesian products.\n\n(A x B) ∩ (B x A) = {(2, 2)}\n(B x A) ∩ (A x B) = {(2, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the intersection of the Cartesian products (A x B) ∩ (B x A) and (B x A) ∩ (A x B) are equal, both resulting in the set {(2, 2)}. However, this does not demonstrate the associativity of the Cartesian product with respect to intersection, as associativity is a property of operations involving three or more sets.\n\nAssociativity means that for three sets A, B, and C, the following holds:\n\n(A x B) x C = A x (B x C)\n\nIn this problem, we only have two sets, A and B, and we are finding the intersection of their Cartesian products, not the Cartesian product of three sets. Therefore, this problem does not demonstrate the associativity or non-associativity of the Cartesian product with respect to intersection."
