    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circular garden, we use the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 7 meters. So, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = 2 * 3.14159 * 7\n\nC ≈ 43.98226\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the garden is approximately 43.98 meters."
