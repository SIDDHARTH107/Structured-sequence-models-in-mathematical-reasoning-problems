    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into the given partial differential equation, we get:\n\n$$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$$\n\nNow, we will divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$$\n\nSince the left side is a function of $x$ and the right side is a function of $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-k^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2, \\quad \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = k^2$$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0$$\n$$Y''(y) - k^2Y(y) = 0$$\n\nThe general solutions for these ODEs are:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$$\n$$Y(y) = C\\cosh(ky) + D\\sinh(ky)$$\n\nNow, we will apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1) $u(x, 0) = X(x)Y(0) = \\cos x$\n\n$$A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx) = \\cos x$$\n\nSince this equation must hold for all $x$, we have $A = 1$, $B = 0$, and $k = 1$. Thus, $X(x) = \\cos x$.\n\n2) $u(x, \\infty) = X(x)Y(\\infty) = 0$\n\nSince $Y(\\infty)$ must be zero and $\\cosh(ky)$ is always positive, we must have $C = 0$. Thus, $Y(y) = D\\sinh(y)$.\n\nNow, we have the solution:\n\n$$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y) = (\\cos x)(D\\sinh y)$$\n\nSince the problem states that $u$ must be bounded as $y \\rightarrow \\infty$, we have $D = 0$. Therefore, the solution to the boundary value problem is:\n\n$$u(x, y) = 0$$"
