    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to t.\n\nx'(t) = -3sin(t)\ny'(t) = 2cos(t)\nz'(t) = 4\n\nx''(t) = -3cos(t)\ny''(t) = -2sin(t)\nz''(t) = 0\n\nNow, let's evaluate these derivatives at t = π/4:\n\nx'(π/4) = -3sin(π/4) = -3√2/2\ny'(π/4) = 2cos(π/4) = 2√2/2 = √2\nz'(π/4) = 4\n\nx''(π/4) = -3cos(π/4) = -3√2/2\ny''(π/4) = -2sin(π/4) = -2√2/2 = -√2\nz''(π/4) = 0\n\nNow, let's find the curvature (k) using the formula:\n\nk = ||T'(s)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nwhere T(s) is the unit tangent vector and r'(t) is the first derivative of the position vector.\n\nFirst, we need to find the magnitude of r'(t):\n\n||r'(t)|| = √((-3√2/2)^2 + (√2)^2 + 4^2) = √(18 + 2 + 16) = √36 = 6\n\nNow, let's find the cross product of r'(t) and r''(t):\n\n(r'(t) x r''(t)) = (-3√2/2, √2, 4) x (-3√2/2, -√2, 0)\n= (0, 0, 9)\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of the cross product:\n\n||(r'(t) x r''(t))|| = √(0^2 + 0^2 + 9^2) = 9\n\nNow, we can find the curvature:\n\nk = ||T'(s)|| / ||r'(t)||^3 = 9 / 6^3 = 9 / 216 = 1/24\n\nNow, let's find the torsion (τ) using the formula:\n\nτ = (r'(t) • (r'(t) x r''(t))) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nwhere • denotes the dot product.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of r'(t) and (r'(t) x r''(t)):\n\n(-3√2/2, √2, 4) • (0, 0, 9) = 0 + 0 + 36 = 36\n\nNow, let's find the torsion:\n\nτ = (r'(t) • (r'(t) x r''(t))) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2 = 36 / 9^2 = 36 / 81 = 4/9\n\nSo, the curvature at t = π/4 is k = 1/24, and the torsion at t = π/4 is τ = 4/9."
