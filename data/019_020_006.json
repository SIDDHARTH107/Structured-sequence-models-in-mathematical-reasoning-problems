    "message_2": "The worst-case time complexity of the most basic algorithm that checks whether a given number 'n' is a prime number or not is O(n). This is because, in the worst case, the algorithm checks all numbers from 2 to n-1 to see if any of them divide 'n' without a remainder.\n\nHowever, there are more efficient algorithms for primality testing, such as the AKS primality test, which has a time complexity of O(log(n)^7.5) for the worst-case scenario."
