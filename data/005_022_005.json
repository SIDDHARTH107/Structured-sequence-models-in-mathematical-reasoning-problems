    "message_1": "For a statistics exam, a professor grades each student's exam on a scale of 0 to 100. Out of 30 graded exams, the professor suspects that two of the exams have outlier scores. The following ten scores were recorded: \n\n65, 78, 84, 87, 90, 92, 95, 98, 99, 99\n\nAssuming that there are two outliers in the data, calculate the median score for the remaining 28 exams.",
    "message_2": "To find the median, we first need to identify the two outliers. Outliers are typically the highest and/or lowest values in a dataset that are significantly different from the rest of the values. In this case, we can consider the lowest value (65) and the highest value (99) as the outliers.\n\nNow, we need to remove these two outliers from the dataset:\n\n78, 84, 87, 90, 92, 95, 98, 99\n\nThere are 8 remaining values. To find the median, we need to find the middle value(s). Since there are an even number of values, the median will be the average of the two middle values.\n\nThe two middle values are 87 and 90. To find the average, we add them together and divide by 2:\n\n(87 + 90) / 2 = 177 / 2 = 88.5\n\nSo, the median score for the remaining 28 exams is 88.5."
