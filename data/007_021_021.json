    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 96 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 96\n2. Choose two initial values x = 2 and y = 2\n3. Iterate the function for x and y, and find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difference between x and y and the number 96.\n\nIteration 1:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod 96 = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod 96 = 26\nGCD(|5 - 26|, 96) = GCD(21, 96) = 3\n\nThe smallest prime factor of 96 is 3."
