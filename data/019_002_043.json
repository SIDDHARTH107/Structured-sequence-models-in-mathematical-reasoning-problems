    "message_2": "First, let's write the statement \"All prime numbers are odd\" using predicate logic. We can use the predicates P(x) to represent \"x is a prime number\" and O(x) to represent \"x is odd.\" The statement can be written as:\n\n∀x(P(x) → O(x))\n\nNow, let's analyze the given predicate logic statement:\n\n∀x(P(x) ∧ ¬O(x))\n\nThis statement says \"For all x, x is a prime number and x is not odd.\"\n\nThe student should identify this statement as false. A counterexample to support their answer is the prime number 2. 2 is a prime number (P(2) is true), but it is not odd (¬O(2) is true). Therefore, there exists an x (in this case, x=2) for which the statement P(x) ∧ ¬O(x) is true, which contradicts the given statement that all prime numbers are odd."
