The times (in minutes) are given in the matrix below. What is the minimum total time it would take to complete all 8 jobs if each job can only be assigned to one worker and each worker can only work on one job?\n\n| Workers | Job 1 | Job 2 | Job 3 | Job 4 | Job 5 | Job 6 | Job 7 | Job 8 |\n|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Worker 1 | 17    | 13    | 21    | 15    | 19    | 12    | 18    | 16    |\n| Worker 2 | 18    | 19    | 16    | 15    | 14    | 11    | 20    | 17    |\n| Worker 3 | 11    | 13    | 13    | 12    | 16    | 15    | 14    | 19    |\n| Worker 4 | 16    | 11    | 10    | 15    | 20    | 13    | 18    | 21    |\n| Worker 5 | 10    | 14    | 17    | 11    | 11    | 18    | 19    | 20    |\n| Worker 6 | 11    | 20    | 18    | 19    | 21    | 14    | 13    | 10    |\n| Worker 7 | 20    | 15    | 13    | 19    | 12    | 11    | 10    | 18    |\n| Worker 8 | 14    | 10    | 19    | 20    | 18    | 19    | 17    | 12    |",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum total time, we need to assign each worker to a job in such a way that the sum of the times is minimized. This is an example of the assignment problem, which can be solved using the Hungarian algorithm. However, for this specific problem, we can try to find an optimal solution by inspection.\n\nLet's start by assigning the jobs with the most significant difference between the minimum and maximum times:\n\n1. Job 5: Worker 5 (11 minutes)\n2. Job 6: Worker 2 (11 minutes)\n3. Job 7: Worker 7 (10 minutes)\n4. Job 8: Worker 6 (10 minutes)\n\nNow, we have the following jobs and workers left:\n\n| Workers | Job 1 | Job 2 | Job 3 | Job 4 |\n|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Worker 1 | 17    | 13    | 21    | 15    |\n| Worker 3 | 11    | 13    | 13    | 12    |\n| Worker 4 | 16    | 11    | 10    | 15    |\n| Worker 8 | 14    | 10    | 19    | 20    |\n\nLet's continue assigning the remaining jobs:\n\n5. Job 1: Worker 3 (11 minutes)\n6. Job 2: Worker 4 (11 minutes)\n7. Job 3: Worker 8 (19 minutes)\n8. Job 4: Worker 1 (15 minutes)\n\nNow, we have assigned all jobs to the workers:\n\n- Worker 1: Job 4 (15 minutes)\n- Worker 2: Job 6 (11 minutes)\n- Worker 3: Job 1 (11 minutes)\n- Worker 4: Job 2 (11 minutes)\n- Worker 5: Job 5 (11 minutes)\n- Worker 6: Job 8 (10 minutes)\n- Worker 7: Job 7 (10 minutes)\n- Worker 8: Job 3 (19 minutes)\n\nThe minimum total time is 15 + 11 + 11 + 11 + 11 + 10 + 10 + 19 = 98 minutes."
