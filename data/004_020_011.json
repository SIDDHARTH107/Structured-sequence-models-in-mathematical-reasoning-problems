    "message_1": "A crate weighing 500 N is pulled up a ramp that is 6 m long and inclined at an angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal on one end. If the force required to pull the crate up the ramp is constant at 200 N, find the work done by the force. Use integration to solve.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we need to calculate the integral of the force with respect to the distance along the ramp. The force is constant at 200 N, so the integral will be straightforward.\n\nLet F(x) be the force function, which is constant at 200 N. We want to find the work done by the force as the crate moves from the bottom of the ramp (x = 0) to the top of the ramp (x = 6 m). The work done by the force is given by the integral:\n\nW = ∫(F(x) dx) from 0 to 6\n\nSince F(x) = 200 N, the integral becomes:\n\nW = ∫(200 dx) from 0 to 6\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nW = 200x | from 0 to 6\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nW = 200(6) - 200(0)\n\nW = 1200 - 0\n\nW = 1200 J\n\nSo, the work done by the force to pull the crate up the ramp is 1200 Joules."
