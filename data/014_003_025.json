    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob using ElGamal encryption with a public key (p=23, g=5, y=10) where p is a prime number, g is a primitive root modulo p, and y=g^x mod p. Alice wants to encrypt the message m=12 to send it to Bob. She chooses a random number k=3 to generate the ciphertext. Calculate the ciphertext (a,b) and send it to Bob.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the ciphertext (a, b) using ElGamal encryption, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate a = g^k mod p\n2. Calculate b = m * (y^k) mod p\n\nGiven the public key (p=23, g=5, y=10), the message m=12, and the random number k=3, we can calculate the ciphertext as follows:\n\n1. a = g^k mod p = 5^3 mod 23 = 125 mod 23 = 3\n2. b = m * (y^k) mod p = 12 * (10^3) mod 23 = 12 * 1000 mod 23 = 12 * 10 mod 23 = 120 mod 23 = 4\n\nSo, the ciphertext (a, b) is (3, 4). Alice can now send this ciphertext to Bob."
