    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the best responses for each player given the other player's strategy. A Nash equilibrium occurs when both players are playing their best response.\n\n1. If Player 2 chooses L, Player 1's best response is to choose U (1 > -1).\n2. If Player 2 chooses R, Player 1's best response is to choose D (2 > -1).\n\nNow, let's consider Player 2's best responses:\n\n1. If Player 1 chooses U, Player 2's best response is to choose L (0 > -1).\n2. If Player 1 chooses D, Player 2's best response is to choose R (1 > -1).\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when both players are playing their best responses. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when Player 1 chooses U and Player 2 chooses L. The corresponding payoff is (1, 0)."
