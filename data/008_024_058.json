    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2. Therefore, these two equations are dependent and represent the same line in 3D space. We can eliminate the second equation and work with the remaining two equations:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 5\n-2x - 3y + z = -5\n\nNow, we can add the two equations to eliminate x and y:\n\n(2x + 3y - z) + (-2x - 3y + z) = 5 + (-5)\n0 = 0\n\nSince the result is 0 = 0, this means that the two equations represent the same line in 3D space. There is no unique solution, as the system of equations has infinitely many solutions along the line represented by the equation 2x + 3y - z = 5."
