    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - x^2 in the interval [0, 2], we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 2x - x^2\n\n2x^2 = 2x\n\nx^2 = x\n\nx(x - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two points of intersection: x = 0 and x = 1. Since we are only interested in the interval [0, 2], we will consider these two points.\n\nNow we will find the area enclosed between the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval [0, 1]:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - x^2 - x^2) dx from 0 to 1\n\nArea = ∫(2x - 2x^2) dx from 0 to 1\n\nNow we will find the antiderivative of the function:\n\nAntiderivative = x^2 - (2/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow we will evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of the interval and subtract the lower bound value from the upper bound value:\n\nArea = (1^2 - (2/3)(1)^3) - (0^2 - (2/3)(0)^3)\n\nArea = (1 - (2/3)(1)) - (0)\n\nArea = (1 - 2/3)\n\nArea = 1/3\n\nSo the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - x^2 in the interval [0, 2] is 1/3 square units."
