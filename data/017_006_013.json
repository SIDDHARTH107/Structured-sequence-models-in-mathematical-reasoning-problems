    "message_1": "Sally wants to study groups with order 35. Is it possible for her to find a group with this order? Explain why or why not using the result that every group of order pq, where p and q are distinct primes, is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders p and q.",
    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible for Sally to find a group with order 35. \n\nTo see why, let's first note that 35 can be factored into two distinct prime numbers: 35 = 5 * 7, where p = 5 and q = 7. According to the result mentioned, every group of order pq, where p and q are distinct primes, is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders p and q.\n\nIn this case, since 5 and 7 are distinct primes, there exists a group of order 35 that is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7. \n\nOne example of such a group is the cyclic group of order 35, denoted as C_35, which is generated by a single element of order 35. Another example is the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, denoted as C_5 Ã— C_7. Both of these groups have order 35, and Sally can study either of them."
