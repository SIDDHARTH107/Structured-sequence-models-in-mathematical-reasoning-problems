    "message_2": "An orthogonal array is a systematic way of designing experiments that allows for efficient testing of multiple factors at different levels. In this case, the company is testing 9 input variables with 3 levels each.\n\nTo determine the number of different test combinations using an orthogonal array, we need to find the smallest possible orthogonal array that can accommodate these factors and levels. The notation for an orthogonal array is OA(N, k, v, t), where:\n\n- N is the number of test combinations (rows)\n- k is the number of factors (input variables)\n- v is the number of levels for each factor\n- t is the strength of the array (the number of factors that can be simultaneously tested for interactions)\n\nFor this problem, we have k = 9 input variables and v = 3 levels each. We want to find the smallest N that can accommodate these parameters in an orthogonal array.\n\nThe most commonly used orthogonal arrays are the ones based on prime power levels. In this case, since we have 3 levels, we can use a 3^m array, where m is a positive integer. The smallest 3^m array that can accommodate 9 factors is a 3^2 array, which is an OA(9, 9, 3, 2).\n\nHowever, the OA(9, 9, 3, 2) array does not exist. The next smallest 3^m array that can accommodate 9 factors is a 3^3 array, which is an OA(27, 9, 3, 3).\n\nTherefore, the company can create 27 different test combinations using an orthogonal array for their 9 input variables with 3 levels each."
