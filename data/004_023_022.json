    "message_2": "To find the area between the curves, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting y = x^2 - 4x and y = -x^2 + 5x equal to each other and solving for x:\n\nx^2 - 4x = -x^2 + 5x\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n2x^2 - 9x = 0\n\nFactor out the common factor x:\n\nx(2x - 9) = 0\n\nThis gives us two solutions for x:\n\nx = 0 and x = 9/2\n\nSince we are only considering the interval [0, 3], we can ignore the x = 9/2 solution.\n\nNow, we need to find the area between the curves over the interval [0, 3]. We can do this by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval:\n\nArea = ∫(y2 - y1) dx from 0 to 3\n\nwhere y1 = x^2 - 4x and y2 = -x^2 + 5x.\n\nArea = ∫((-x^2 + 5x) - (x^2 - 4x)) dx from 0 to 3\n\nCombine the terms:\n\nArea = ∫(-2x^2 + 9x) dx from 0 to 3\n\nNow, integrate the function with respect to x:\n\nArea = [-2/3 * x^3 + 9/2 * x^2] evaluated from 0 to 3\n\nPlug in the limits of integration:\n\nArea = (-2/3 * 3^3 + 9/2 * 3^2) - (-2/3 * 0^3 + 9/2 * 0^2)\n\nArea = (-2/3 * 27 + 9/2 * 9) - (0)\n\nArea = (-18 + 40.5)\n\nArea = 22.5\n\nSo, the area between the curves y = x^2 - 4x and y = -x^2 + 5x over the interval [0, 3] is 22.5 square units."
