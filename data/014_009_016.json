    "message_1": "Suppose we have a Feistel cipher structure with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits. If we apply 10 rounds of encryption, how many subkeys of what size are needed for the encryption process?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, each round requires a unique subkey. Since we have 10 rounds of encryption, we need 10 subkeys. The size of each subkey depends on the Feistel function used in the cipher. However, in most Feistel ciphers, the subkey size is equal to the block size divided by 2.\n\nIn this case, the block size is 64 bits, so the subkey size would be 64/2 = 32 bits.\n\nTherefore, we need 10 subkeys, each of size 32 bits, for the encryption process."
