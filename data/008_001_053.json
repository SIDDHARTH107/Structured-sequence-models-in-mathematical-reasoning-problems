    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we'll first write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n|  2  1 -1 |  8  |\n|  1 -3  2 | -11 |\n|  4  2 -3 |  20 |\n```\n\nNow, we'll perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2 (to have a leading 1 in the first row):\n\n```\n|  1 -3  2 | -11 |\n|  2  1 -1 |  8  |\n|  4  2 -3 |  20 |\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 2 and Row 3 with (-4 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n\n```\n|  1 -3  2 | -11 |\n|  0  7 -5 |  30 |\n|  0 14 -11|  64 |\n```\n\n3. Divide Row 2 by 7:\n\n```\n|  1 -3  2 | -11 |\n|  0  1 -5/7 | 30/7 |\n|  0 14 -11|  64 |\n```\n\n4. Replace Row 3 with (-14 * Row 2) + Row 3:\n\n```\n|  1 -3  2  | -11    |\n|  0  1 -5/7 | 30/7  |\n|  0  0  3/7 | 18/7  |\n```\n\n5. Divide Row 3 by (3/7):\n\n```\n|  1 -3  2  | -11  |\n|  0  1 -5/7 | 30/7 |\n|  0  0  1   |  6   |\n```\n\nNow that we have the matrix in row-echelon form, we can use back-substitution to solve for x, y, and z:\n\nFrom Row 3: z = 6\n\nFrom Row 2: y - (5/7)z = 30/7 => y = (30/7) + (5/7)(6) => y = 5\n\nFrom Row 1: x - 3y + 2z = -11 => x = -11 + 3(5) - 2(6) => x = 2\n\nSo the solution is x = 2, y = 5, and z = 6."
