    "message_2": "There are two non-abelian groups of order 40. One example of such a group is the semi-direct product of Z_5 and Z_8, denoted as Z_5 ⋊ Z_8.\n\nTo understand why there are two non-abelian groups of order 40, we can use the Sylow theorems. The order of a group is the number of its elements. Since 40 = 2^3 * 5, there are Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 and Sylow 5-subgroups of order 5.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is that there is one Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal. Let's denote this subgroup as P (isomorphic to Z_5).\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is that there is one Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal. Let's denote this subgroup as Q (isomorphic to Z_8 or Z_2 × Z_4).\n\nSince P and Q are both normal and their intersection is trivial (only the identity element), the group G of order 40 can be expressed as a semi-direct product of P and Q: G = P ⋊ Q.\n\nThere are two possible semi-direct products, depending on the action of Q on P. If the action is trivial, then the semi-direct product is a direct product, and the group is abelian (Z_5 × Z_8). If the action is non-trivial, then the semi-direct product is non-abelian. In this case, there are two non-abelian groups of order 40: one isomorphic to Z_5 ⋊ Z_8 and the other isomorphic to Z_5 ⋊ (Z_2 × Z_4)."
