    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the other leg (the height) of the right-angled triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem or trigonometry to find the height. In this case, we'll use trigonometry.\n\nLet's use the sine function to find the height (opposite side) of the triangle. We know the base (adjacent side) and the hypotenuse.\n\nsin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse\n\nWe can find the angle θ using the base and hypotenuse:\n\ncos(θ) = adjacent/hypotenuse\ncos(θ) = 8/10\ncos(θ) = 0.8\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ = cos^(-1)(0.8)\nθ ≈ 36.87°\n\nNow that we have the angle θ, we can find the height (opposite side) using the sine function:\n\nsin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse\nsin(36.87°) = opposite/10\n\nopposite = 10 * sin(36.87°)\nopposite ≈ 6\n\nNow we have the base, height, and hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle:\n\nbase = 8 cm\nheight ≈ 6 cm\nhypotenuse = 10 cm\n\nTo find the perimeter, we add up the lengths of all three sides:\n\nperimeter = base + height + hypotenuse\nperimeter = 8 + 6 + 10\nperimeter = 24 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is approximately 24 cm."
