    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of |f(z)| on C, we will first find the roots of the function f(z) = z^3 - 6z^2 + 11z - 6.\n\nBy inspection or using synthetic division, we can find that z = 1 is a root of the polynomial. Then, we can factor out (z - 1) from the polynomial:\n\nf(z) = (z - 1)(z^2 - 5z + 6)\n\nNow, we can find the remaining roots by solving the quadratic equation z^2 - 5z + 6 = 0. Using the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (5 ± √(5^2 - 4 * 6)) / 2\nz = (5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 2\nz = (5 ± √1) / 2\nz = 3, 2\n\nSo, the three roots of f(z) are z = 1, 2, and 3.\n\nNow, let's use the maximum modulus principle. According to this principle, the maximum value of |f(z)| on a simple closed contour C that encloses all the roots of f(z) will occur at the points on C that are furthest from the roots.\n\nLet's consider the contour C as a circle with center O and radius R. Since the roots are 1, 2, and 3, we can place the center of the circle at the average of these roots, which is:\n\nO = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the radius R of the circle. The distance from the center O to each root is:\n\nd(1) = |1 - 2| = 1\nd(2) = |2 - 2| = 0\nd(3) = |3 - 2| = 1\n\nSince we want the contour C to enclose all the roots, we need to choose the maximum distance as the radius:\n\nR = max{d(1), d(2), d(3)} = 1\n\nNow, we can find the maximum value of |f(z)| on C by evaluating the function at the points on C that are furthest from the roots. These points are z = 1 + R = 3 and z = 3 + R = 5. Let's evaluate |f(z)| at these points:\n\n|f(3)| = |(3 - 1)(3^2 - 5 * 3 + 6)| = |2 * (9 - 15 + 6)| = 2 * 0 = 0\n|f(5)| = |(5 - 1)(5^2 - 5 * 5 + 6)| = |4 * (25 - 25 + 6)| = 4 * 6 = 24\n\nThus, the maximum value of |f(z)| on C is 24."
