    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 4\n\n4x + 6y - 2z = 8\n\n6x + 9y - 3z = 12\n\nDetermine whether the system has a unique solution, infinitely many solutions or no solutions.",
    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are not independent and actually represent the same line.\n\nSince all three equations represent the same line, the system has infinitely many solutions."
