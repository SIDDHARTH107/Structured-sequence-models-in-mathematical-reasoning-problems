    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to epistemic logic:\n\nSuppose there are three people in a room - Alice, Bob, and Carol. Alice knows the answer to a math question, but Bob and Carol do not. The question is either 2 + 2 = 4 or 2 + 2 = 5. Alice says \"I know the answer, but I'm not going to tell you.\" What can be concluded about what each person knows?\n\nHint: Use epistemic logic to analyze what each person knows or does not know.",
    "message_2": "Using epistemic logic, we can analyze the knowledge of each person in the room.\n\n1. Alice knows the answer to the math question. Since the question is either 2 + 2 = 4 or 2 + 2 = 5, and Alice knows the answer, she must know that 2 + 2 = 4 (as that is the correct answer).\n\n2. Bob and Carol do not know the answer to the math question initially. They only know that the question is either 2 + 2 = 4 or 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n3. When Alice says \"I know the answer, but I'm not going to tell you,\" Bob and Carol learn that Alice knows the answer. However, this statement does not provide any new information about the answer itself, so Bob and Carol still do not know whether the answer is 2 + 2 = 4 or 2 + 2 = 5.\n\nIn conclusion, Alice knows that 2 + 2 = 4, while Bob and Carol know that Alice knows the answer, but they still do not know the answer themselves."
