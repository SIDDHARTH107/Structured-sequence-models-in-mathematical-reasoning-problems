    "message_2": "To find the probability of a theft occurring in the neighborhood, we can divide the average number of thefts per year by the population of the neighborhood.\n\nProbability = (Average number of thefts per year) / (Population)\n\nProbability = 15 / 10,000\n\nProbability = 0.0015\n\nRounded to four decimal places, the probability of a theft occurring in the neighborhood is 0.0015."
