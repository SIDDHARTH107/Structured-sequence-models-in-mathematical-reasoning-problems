    "message_2": "To find the maximum amplitude of the forced van der Pol oscillator, we can use the formula for the steady-state amplitude of a forced oscillator:\n\nA = F0 / sqrt((k - mω^2)^2 + (cω)^2)\n\nwhere:\nA is the maximum amplitude,\nF0 is the forcing amplitude,\nk is the spring constant,\nm is the mass of the oscillator,\nω is the angular frequency of the forcing function (ω = 2πf, where f is the forcing frequency),\nc is the damping coefficient.\n\nFirst, we need to find the spring constant (k) and mass (m) of the oscillator using the given natural frequency (fn) and damping coefficient (c):\n\nfn = sqrt(k/m)\nk = m(2πfn)^2\n\nSince we know the damping coefficient (c) and natural frequency (fn):\n\nc = 2 * sqrt(km)\nc^2 = 4km\n\nNow, we can solve for k and m:\n\nk = c^2 / (4fn^2)\nm = k / (4π^2fn^2)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nc = 0.1\nfn = 2 Hz\n\nk = (0.1)^2 / (4 * (2)^2) = 0.0025 N/m\nm = 0.0025 / (4 * π^2 * (2)^2) ≈ 6.333e-6 kg\n\nNow, we can find the angular frequency of the forcing function:\n\nω = 2πf\nω = 2π(3 Hz) = 6π rad/s\n\nFinally, we can find the maximum amplitude (A) using the formula:\n\nA = F0 / sqrt((k - mω^2)^2 + (cω)^2)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nF0 = 1.5 units\nk = 0.0025 N/m\nm = 6.333e-6 kg\nω = 6π rad/s\nc = 0.1\n\nA = 1.5 / sqrt(((0.0025 - 6.333e-6 * (6π)^2)^2 + (0.1 * 6π)^2))\nA ≈ 0.240 units\n\nThe maximum amplitude of the forced van der Pol oscillator is approximately 0.240 units."
