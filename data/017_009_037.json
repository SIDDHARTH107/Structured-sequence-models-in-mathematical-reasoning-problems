    "message_2": "First, let's note that the order of a group is the number of its elements. Since the order of $G$ is $9$, we know that $|G| = 9$. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of $G$ must divide the order of $G$. Thus, the possible orders of subgroups of $G$ are $1, 3,$ and $9$.\n\nNow, let's consider the two cases:\n\nCase 1: There exists an element $x \\in G$ such that $x^3 \\neq e$.\n\nIn this case, we know that the order of $x$ is not $3$. Since the order of $x$ must divide $9$, the only other possibility is that the order of $x$ is $9$. This means that $x$ generates a cyclic subgroup of order $9$, which is the entire group $G$. Thus, $G$ is a cyclic group of order $9$, and is isomorphic to $C_9$.\n\nCase 2: There is no element $x \\in G$ such that $x^3 \\neq e$.\n\nIn this case, every non-identity element of $G$ has order $3$. Let $x, y \\in G$ be two distinct non-identity elements. Since their orders are both $3$, we have the following cyclic subgroups: $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{e, x, x^2\\}$ and $\\langle y \\rangle = \\{e, y, y^2\\}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of these two elements: $xy$. Since $x^3 = y^3 = e$, we have $(xy)^3 = x^3y^3 = ee = e$. This means that the order of $xy$ is also $3$. Since $x$ and $y$ are distinct non-identity elements, $xy$ cannot be equal to $x$ or $y$. Therefore, $xy$ must be equal to $x^2$ or $y^2$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $xy = x^2$. Then, $y = x^{-1}(xy) = x^{-1}x^2 = x$. This is a contradiction, as we assumed $x$ and $y$ to be distinct non-identity elements.\n\nThus, there cannot be a group of order $9$ in which every non-identity element has order $3$. Therefore, if there exists an element $x \\in G$ such that $x^3 \\neq e$, $G$ must be isomorphic to the cyclic group $C_9$."
