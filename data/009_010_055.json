    "message_1": "Suppose a stock priced at $100 today follows a Geometric Brownian Motion with a volatility of 0.2 and a continuously compounded risk-free interest rate of 5%. What is the price of a European call option with a strike price of $110 and a remaining maturity of 1 year, assuming that there are no dividends paid? Solve using the Black-Scholes equation.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to calculate the values of d1 and d2, which are given by the following formulas:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + σ^2/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nwhere:\nS = current stock price = $100\nK = strike price = $110\nr = continuously compounded risk-free interest rate = 0.05\nσ = volatility = 0.2\nT = time to maturity = 1 year\n\nFirst, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.05 + 0.2^2/2) * 1) / (0.2 * sqrt(1))\nd1 = (ln(0.9091) + (0.05 + 0.02) * 1) / (0.2)\nd1 = (-0.0953 + 0.07) / 0.2\nd1 = -0.0253 / 0.2\nd1 = -0.1265\n\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nd2 = -0.1265 - 0.2 * sqrt(1)\nd2 = -0.1265 - 0.2\nd2 = -0.3265\n\nNow, we can use the Black-Scholes equation to find the price of the European call option:\n\nCall price = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-r * T) * N(d2)\n\nwhere N(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n\nN(d1) = N(-0.1265) = 0.4495\nN(d2) = N(-0.3265) = 0.3720\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Black-Scholes equation:\n\nCall price = 100 * 0.4495 - 110 * e^(-0.05 * 1) * 0.3720\nCall price = 44.95 - 110 * e^(-0.05) * 0.3720\nCall price = 44.95 - 110 * 0.9512 * 0.3720\nCall price = 44.95 - 38.8724\nCall price = $6.0776\n\nSo, the price of the European call option with a strike price of $110 and a remaining maturity of 1 year is approximately $6.08."
