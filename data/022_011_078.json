    "message_2": "To find the order and type of the zero of the complex function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)(z - i)^2 at z = 1, we first need to determine if z = 1 is a zero of the function.\n\nLet's substitute z = 1 into the function:\n\nf(1) = (1^3 - 1)(1 - i)^2 = (0)(1 - i)^2 = 0\n\nSince f(1) = 0, z = 1 is a zero of the function.\n\nNow, let's find the order of the zero. The order of a zero is the multiplicity of the zero in the function. In our case, we have two factors: (z^3 - 1) and (z - i)^2.\n\nFor the first factor (z^3 - 1), we can use the factor theorem to find that it has a zero at z = 1:\n\n(z^3 - 1) = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)\n\nSo, the zero at z = 1 has a multiplicity of 1 in the first factor.\n\nFor the second factor (z - i)^2, z = 1 is not a zero, so it doesn't contribute to the multiplicity of the zero at z = 1.\n\nTherefore, the order of the zero at z = 1 is 1.\n\nAs for the type of the zero, since the order is 1, it is a simple zero."
