    "message_2": "To find the integral of cos^2(2x) dx, we can use the power reduction formula for cosine:\n\ncos^2(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2\n\nApplying this formula to our integral, we get:\n\n∫cos^2(2x) dx = ∫(1 + cos(4x))/2 dx\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\n∫(1 + cos(4x))/2 dx = (1/2)∫1 dx + (1/2)∫cos(4x) dx\n\nThe integral of 1 with respect to x is x, and the integral of cos(4x) with respect to x is (1/4)sin(4x). So we have:\n\n(1/2)(x) + (1/2)(1/4)sin(4x) + C\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(1/2)x + (1/8)sin(4x) + C\n\nSo the integral of cos^2(2x) dx is (1/2)x + (1/8)sin(4x) + C, where C is the constant of integration."
