    "message_2": "Let A be a set with 5 elements, i.e., |A| = 5. The power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself.\n\nThe size of the power set of A, |P(A)|, can be found using the formula |P(A)| = 2^|A|, where |A| is the cardinality (number of elements) of set A.\n\nIn this case, |A| = 5, so |P(A)| = 2^5 = 32.\n\nNow, let's compare the size of the power set of A, |P(A)|, to the size of set A itself, |A|:\n\n|P(A)| = 32\n|A| = 5\n\nSince 32 > 5, the size of the power set of A is larger than the size of set A itself.\n\nThis example demonstrates that the power set of a set is always larger than the set itself. In general, for any set A with |A| = n, |P(A)| = 2^n, which is always greater than n for any non-negative integer n."
