    "message_2": "In a 3-dimensional space, the minimum number of crossings required for a knot with 10 edges is 3. This is known as the Dowker notation for the knot, which is a method of describing knots by their crossings. The 10_3 knot, also known as the \"Perko pair,\" is the simplest knot with 10 edges and 3 crossings."
