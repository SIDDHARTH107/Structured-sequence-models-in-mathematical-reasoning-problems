    "message_1": "A school has 120 students taking a math course. There are 60 males and 60 females. If the probability of a male student passing the course is 0.8, and the probability of a female student passing the course is 0.6, what is the probability that exactly 45 male students and 30 female students will pass the course?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes in n trials, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nFirst, we will find the probability of exactly 45 male students passing the course:\n\nn = 60 (number of male students)\nx = 45 (number of male students passing)\np = 0.8 (probability of a male student passing)\n\nC(60, 45) = 60! / (45! * (60-45)!)\nP(45 males pass) = C(60, 45) * 0.8^45 * 0.2^15\n\nNext, we will find the probability of exactly 30 female students passing the course:\n\nn = 60 (number of female students)\nx = 30 (number of female students passing)\np = 0.6 (probability of a female student passing)\n\nC(60, 30) = 60! / (30! * (60-30)!)\nP(30 females pass) = C(60, 30) * 0.6^30 * 0.4^30\n\nFinally, we will multiply the probabilities of these two independent events to find the probability of both events occurring:\n\nP(45 males pass and 30 females pass) = P(45 males pass) * P(30 females pass)\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nC(60, 45) = 5,461,512,070\nP(45 males pass) = 5,461,512,070 * 0.8^45 * 0.2^15 ≈ 0.0013\n\nC(60, 30) = 1,182,052,560\nP(30 females pass) = 1,182,052,560 * 0.6^30 * 0.4^30 ≈ 0.0215\n\nP(45 males pass and 30 females pass) = 0.0013 * 0.0215 ≈ 0.00002795\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 45 male students and 30 female students will pass the course is approximately 0.002795 or 0.2795%."
