    "message_2": "Let's first analyze the given equation of the curve $C$. It represents a circle with center $(1, 0)$ and radius $1$. Now, let's consider the needle of length $2$ touching the curve at a single point $P$. Since the length of the needle is equal to the diameter of the circle, the endpoints of the needle will be on the circle.\n\nLet $A$ and $B$ be the endpoints of the needle, and let $O$ be the center of the circle. Then, $\\triangle OAP$ and $\\triangle OBP$ are right triangles, with $OA = OP = OB = 1$. Let $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be the angles between the $x$-axis and segments $OA$ and $OB$, respectively. Then, the angle between the needle and the $x$-axis is $\\theta = \\beta - \\alpha$.\n\nWe want to maximize $\\theta$. To do this, we can use the fact that the sine of an angle is maximized when the angle is $90^\\circ$. Let's express $\\sin \\theta$ in terms of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ using the sine of the difference formula:\n\n$$\\sin \\theta = \\sin (\\beta - \\alpha) = \\sin \\beta \\cos \\alpha - \\cos \\beta \\sin \\alpha.$$\n\nNow, let's express $\\sin \\alpha$, $\\cos \\alpha$, $\\sin \\beta$, and $\\cos \\beta$ in terms of the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. We have:\n\n$$A = (1 + \\cos \\alpha, \\sin \\alpha), \\quad B = (1 + \\cos \\beta, \\sin \\beta).$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\\sin \\theta = (\\sin \\beta)(1 + \\cos \\alpha) - (\\cos \\beta)(\\sin \\alpha).$$\n\nWe want to maximize $\\sin \\theta$. Since the sine function is maximized when its argument is $90^\\circ$, we want to find $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ such that $\\theta = 90^\\circ$. This means that $\\sin \\theta = 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the geometric situation. When $\\theta = 90^\\circ$, the needle is tangent to the circle at point $P$. In this case, the angle between the $x$-axis and the needle is the same as the angle between the $x$-axis and the radius $OP$. Thus, the maximum angle that the needle can make with the $x$-axis is equal to the maximum angle that the radius $OP$ can make with the $x$-axis.\n\nThe maximum angle occurs when the point $P$ is at the highest point of the circle, which is $(1, 1)$. In this case, the angle between the $x$-axis and the radius $OP$ is $45^\\circ$. Therefore, the maximum angle that the needle can make with the $x$-axis is $\\boxed{45^\\circ}$."
