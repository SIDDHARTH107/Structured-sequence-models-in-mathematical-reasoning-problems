    "message_1": "Suppose we have 7 balls, each of a different color. In how many ways can we choose 3 of these balls if we want balls of every color to be represented in the choice?",
    "message_2": "Since there are 7 balls of different colors, and we want to choose 3 balls with all different colors, we can simply use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 7.\n\nThe combination formula is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items we want to choose, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nIn this case, n = 7 (total number of balls) and k = 3 (number of balls we want to choose).\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!)\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!4!)\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 × 6 × 5) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(7, 3) = 210\n\nSo there are 210 ways to choose 3 balls of different colors from a set of 7 balls."
