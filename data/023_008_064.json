    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients for the non-periodic function f(x) = x for -5 < x < 5, we first need to make it periodic. We can do this by extending the function to be periodic with period 10 (i.e., f(x + 10) = f(x) for all x). Now, we can find the Fourier coefficients for this periodic function.\n\nThe Fourier series for a periodic function with period L is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(2πnx/L) + b_n * sin(2πnx/L)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is taken from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor our function, L = 10. We can find the coefficients using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x)] dx from -L/2 to L/2\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(2πnx/L)] dx from -L/2 to L/2\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(2πnx/L)] dx from -L/2 to L/2\n\nFor f(x) = x:\n\na_0 = (1/10) * ∫[x] dx from -5 to 5 = 0\n\na_n = (2/10) * ∫[x * cos(2πnx/10)] dx from -5 to 5\n     = (1/5) * [(-5/πn) * sin(2πnx/10)] from -5 to 5\n     = 0\n\nb_n = (2/10) * ∫[x * sin(2πnx/10)] dx from -5 to 5\n     = (1/5) * [(5/πn) * cos(2πnx/10) + (1/(πn)^2) * sin(2πnx/10)] from -5 to 5\n     = (10/πn) * cos(πn)\n\nSo, the Fourier series for f(x) = x for -5 < x < 5 is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(10/πn) * sin(πn) * sin(2πnx/10)]\n\n2. To find the value of f(x) at x = 2.5, we can use the Fourier series:\n\nf(2.5) = Σ [(10/πn) * sin(πn) * sin(2πn(2.5)/10)]\n       ≈ (10/π) * sin(π) * sin(π/2) + (10/(2π)) * sin(2π) * sin(π) + ... (truncated for simplicity)\n\nSince sin(πn) = 0 for all integer values of n, all terms in the series are zero except for the first term. Therefore, f(2.5) ≈ 2.5.\n\n3. To plot the function f(x) and its Fourier series approximation with n=5 on the same graph, we can use the following formula for the Fourier series approximation:\n\nf(x) ≈ (10/π) * sin(π) * sin(πx/5) + (10/(2π)) * sin(2π) * sin(2πx/5) + ... + (10/(5π)) * sin(5π) * sin(5πx/5)\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, sin(πn) = 0 for all integer values of n, so the Fourier series approximation will not be accurate for this function. The graph of f(x) = x will be a straight line, while the Fourier series approximation will be a sum of sine functions, which will not match the original function well."
