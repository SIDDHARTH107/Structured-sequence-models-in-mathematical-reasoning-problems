    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for a math student studying Fluid flow and Navier-Stokes equations in Differential Equations:\n\nA fluid with viscosity coefficient $\\mu = 0.01$ kg/(m s) is flowing through a cylindrical pipe of radius $r = 0.1$ m with a velocity profile $v(r) = 5 - r^2$. Determine the average velocity of the fluid within the pipe, as well as the flow rate of the fluid.",
    "message_2": "To find the average velocity of the fluid within the pipe, we need to integrate the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the pipe and then divide by the total area. The cross-sectional area of the pipe is given by $A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (0.1)^2 = 0.01\\pi$ m².\n\nThe average velocity $\\bar{v}$ can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\\bar{v} = \\frac{1}{A} \\int_{0}^{r} v(r) 2\\pi r dr$$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n$$\\bar{v} = \\frac{1}{0.01\\pi} \\int_{0}^{0.1} (5 - r^2) 2\\pi r dr$$\n\nNow, integrate with respect to r:\n\n$$\\bar{v} = \\frac{1}{0.01\\pi} \\left[ 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{0.1} 5r dr - 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{0.1} r^3 dr \\right]$$\n\n$$\\bar{v} = \\frac{1}{0.01\\pi} \\left[ 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{5r^2}{2}\\Big|_{0}^{0.1}\\right) - 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{r^4}{4}\\Big|_{0}^{0.1}\\right) \\right]$$\n\nEvaluate the integrals:\n\n$$\\bar{v} = \\frac{1}{0.01\\pi} \\left[ 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{5(0.1)^2}{2}\\right) - 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{(0.1)^4}{4}\\right) \\right]$$\n\n$$\\bar{v} = \\frac{1}{0.01\\pi} \\left[ 2\\pi \\left(0.025\\right) - 2\\pi \\left(0.000025\\right) \\right]$$\n\n$$\\bar{v} = \\frac{1}{0.01\\pi} \\left[ 0.05\\pi - 0.00005\\pi \\right]$$\n\n$$\\bar{v} = 5 - 0.005 = 4.995 \\text{ m/s}$$\n\nNow, to find the flow rate $Q$, we multiply the average velocity by the cross-sectional area:\n\n$$Q = \\bar{v} \\cdot A = 4.995 \\cdot 0.01\\pi = 0.04995\\pi \\approx 0.1568 \\text{ m³/s}$$\n\nSo, the average velocity of the fluid within the pipe is approximately $4.995$ m/s, and the flow rate is approximately $0.1568$ m³/s."
