    "message_2": "a) To find the equilibrium solutions, we set dy/dt = 0 and solve for y:\n\n0 = y^2 - 3y\n0 = y(y - 3)\n\nThe equilibrium solutions are y = 0 and y = 3.\n\nb) To draw the direction field, we can analyze the behavior of the differential equation in different regions:\n\n- For y < 0, dy/dt > 0, so the solutions will increase.\n- For 0 < y < 3, dy/dt < 0, so the solutions will decrease.\n- For y > 3, dy/dt > 0, so the solutions will increase.\n\nWe can sketch the direction field and solution curves accordingly. The equilibrium solutions at y = 0 and y = 3 act as horizontal asymptotes for the solution curves.\n\nc) To find the solution to the initial value problem y(0) = 2, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndy/(y^2 - 3y) = dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n∫(1/(y(y - 3))) dy = ∫ dt\n\nTo solve the integral on the left side, we can use partial fraction decomposition:\n\n1/(y(y - 3)) = A/y + B/(y - 3)\n\n1 = A(y - 3) + B(y)\n\nComparing coefficients, we get:\n\nA + B = 0\n-3A = 1\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find A = -1/3 and B = 1/3. So,\n\n∫(1/(y(y - 3))) dy = ∫((-1/3)/y + (1/3)/(y - 3)) dy\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\n(-1/3)ln|y| + (1/3)ln|y - 3| = t + C\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition y(0) = 2:\n\n(-1/3)ln|2| + (1/3)ln|2 - 3| = C\n\nC = ln|2| - ln|1| = ln(2)\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n(-1/3)ln|y| + (1/3)ln|y - 3| = t + ln(2)\n\nThis is the implicit solution to the initial value problem y(0) = 2."
