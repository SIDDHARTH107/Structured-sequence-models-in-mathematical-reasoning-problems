    "message_2": "To determine the shared secret key in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes $A = g^a \\pmod{p}$ and sends it to Bob.\n2. Bob computes $B = g^b \\pmod{p}$ and sends it to Alice.\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as $K_A = B^a \\pmod{p}$.\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as $K_B = A^b \\pmod{p}$.\n\nIf the protocol works correctly, $K_A$ and $K_B$ should be equal.\n\nGiven $p = 11$, $g = 2$, $a = 3$, and $b = 4$:\n\n1. Alice computes $A = 2^3 \\pmod{11} = 8$ and sends it to Bob.\n2. Bob computes $B = 2^4 \\pmod{11} = 5$ and sends it to Alice.\n3. Alice computes $K_A = 5^3 \\pmod{11} = 125 \\pmod{11} = 3$.\n4. Bob computes $K_B = 8^4 \\pmod{11} = 4096 \\pmod{11} = 3$.\n\nSince $K_A = K_B = 3$, the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for their encrypted communication is 3."
