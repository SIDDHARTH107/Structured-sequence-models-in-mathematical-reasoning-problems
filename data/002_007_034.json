    "message_1": "A trapezoidal garden bed has a top length of 10 meters, a base length of 8 meters, and a height of 6 meters. Find the area of the garden bed in square meters.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (top length + base length) * height\n\nIn this case, the top length is 10 meters, the base length is 8 meters, and the height is 6 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (10 + 8) * 6\nArea = (1/2) * 18 * 6\nArea = 9 * 6\nArea = 54 square meters\n\nSo, the area of the garden bed is 54 square meters."
