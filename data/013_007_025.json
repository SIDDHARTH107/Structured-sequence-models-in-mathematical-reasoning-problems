    "message_2": "If each fisherman can catch up to 5 fish per day, and there are 10 fishermen, then they can catch a total of 5 fish/day * 10 fishermen = 50 fish per day.\n\nAfter 10 days, they would have caught 50 fish/day * 10 days = 500 fish in total. However, there are only 100 fish in the lake. Therefore, the fishermen will catch all the fish in the lake, and there will be 0 fish left after 10 days."
