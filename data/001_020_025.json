    "message_2": "To graph the equation y = |2x + 1|, we need to consider two cases: when the expression inside the absolute value is positive or zero, and when it is negative.\n\nCase 1: 2x + 1 â‰¥ 0\nIn this case, the equation becomes y = 2x + 1. This is a straight line with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 1. The x-intercept occurs when y = 0, so we have:\n\n0 = 2x + 1\n-1 = 2x\nx = -1/2\n\nSo, the x-intercept is at the point (-1/2, 0).\n\nCase 2: 2x + 1 < 0\nIn this case, the equation becomes y = -(2x + 1), which is a straight line with a slope of -2 and a y-intercept of 1. The x-intercept occurs when y = 0, but we already found it in Case 1.\n\nNow, let's find the vertex. The vertex occurs at the point where the two cases meet, which is when 2x + 1 = 0:\n\n2x + 1 = 0\n2x = -1\nx = -1/2\n\nPlugging this x-value into either case (since they are equal at the vertex), we get:\n\ny = |2(-1/2) + 1|\ny = |1|\ny = 1\n\nSo, the vertex is at the point (-1/2, 1).\n\nIn summary:\n- The graph is a V-shaped graph with two straight lines, one with a slope of 2 and the other with a slope of -2.\n- The vertex is at the point (-1/2, 1).\n- The x-intercept is at the point (-1/2, 0).\n- The y-intercept is at the point (0, 1)."
