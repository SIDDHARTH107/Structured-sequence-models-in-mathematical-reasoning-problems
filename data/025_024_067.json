    "message_2": "To find the number of fixed points under the action of PGL(3, C), we need to find the points on the curve X that are invariant under the action of any element in PGL(3, C).\n\nRecall that PGL(3, C) is the group of 3x3 invertible matrices with complex entries, modulo scalar multiples of the identity matrix. The action of PGL(3, C) on the projective plane P^2 is given by matrix multiplication on homogeneous coordinates.\n\nLet [x:y:z] be a point on the curve X, and let A be an element in PGL(3, C). Then the action of A on [x:y:z] is given by A[x:y:z] = [x':y':z'], where [x':y':z'] is another point in P^2. We want to find the points [x:y:z] such that A[x:y:z] = [x:y:z] for all A in PGL(3, C).\n\nSuppose [x:y:z] is a fixed point. Then for any A in PGL(3, C), we have A[x:y:z] = [x:y:z]. In particular, this means that the equation 3x^3 + 4y^3 + 5z^3 = 0 is invariant under the action of A. In other words, we must have 3(x')^3 + 4(y')^3 + 5(z')^3 = 0 for any A in PGL(3, C).\n\nHowever, this is not possible for a non-constant curve like X. The only curves that are invariant under the action of the entire PGL(3, C) are the so-called \"absolutely invariant\" curves, which are either a point or the entire projective plane. Since X is neither a point nor the entire projective plane, there can be no points on X that are fixed by the action of PGL(3, C).\n\nTherefore, the number of fixed points under the action of PGL(3, C) is 0."
