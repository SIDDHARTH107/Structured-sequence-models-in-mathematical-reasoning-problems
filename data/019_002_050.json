    "message_1": "Let P(x) be the statement \"x is a prime number\" and Q(x) be the statement \"x is an odd number\". \n\nWrite a predicate logic statement to represent the following: \"Some odd numbers are prime numbers.\"\n\nThen, using this statement, determine whether the following statement is true or false:\n\"There exists an odd number that is not a prime number.\"",
    "message_2": "To represent the statement \"Some odd numbers are prime numbers\" in predicate logic, we can write:\n\n∃x (Q(x) ∧ P(x))\n\nNow, to determine whether the statement \"There exists an odd number that is not a prime number\" is true or false, we can consider the statement:\n\n∃x (Q(x) ∧ ¬P(x))\n\nThis statement is true. For example, consider the odd number 9. It is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself (3 × 3 = 9). So, there exists an odd number that is not a prime number."
