    "message_2": "The Weierstrass normal form of an elliptic curve is given by the equation:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$\n\nThe discriminant of the curve, $\\Delta$, is related to the coefficients $A$ and $B$ by the formula:\n\n$\\Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$\n\nGiven that the discriminant $\\Delta = 1728$, we can solve for the relationship between $A$ and $B$:\n\n$1728 = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$\n\nDivide both sides by -16:\n\n$-108 = 4A^3 + 27B^2$\n\nSince the point $P = (0, 0)$ is a point of order 2 on the curve, it must satisfy the curve equation:\n\n$0^2 = 0^3 + A(0) + B$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$0 = B$\n\nNow we know that $B = 0$, and we can substitute this into the equation we derived from the discriminant:\n\n$-108 = 4A^3$\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n$-27 = A^3$\n\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\n$A = -3$\n\nNow we have the values for $A$ and $B$, so we can write the equation of the Weierstrass normal form of the elliptic curve:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 - 3x$"
