    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 77 = 7 * 11, where 7 and 11 are distinct primes.\n\nBy the first Sylow theorem, there exist Sylow 7-subgroups and Sylow 11-subgroups of G. Let P be a Sylow 7-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 11-subgroup. Then, |P| = 7 and |Q| = 11.\n\nBy the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, denoted by n_7, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. Thus, n_7 divides 11 and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7). The only possibility is n_7 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 11-subgroups, denoted by n_11, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 11. Thus, n_11 divides 7 and n_11 ≡ 1 (mod 11). The only possibility is n_11 = 1.\n\nSince n_7 = n_11 = 1, there is only one Sylow 7-subgroup and one Sylow 11-subgroup in G. Let P and Q be these unique subgroups. By the second Sylow theorem, P and Q are normal subgroups of G.\n\nNow, consider the product of elements from P and Q. Let p ∈ P and q ∈ Q. Since P and Q are normal subgroups, we have:\n\npq = qp\n\nThus, the elements of P and Q commute with each other. We can now consider the set:\n\nR = {pq | p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}\n\nWe will show that R is a subgroup of G. Let r_1 = p_1q_1 and r_2 = p_2q_2 be elements of R. Then:\n\nr_1r_2 = (p_1q_1)(p_2q_2) = p_1(q_1p_2)q_2 = p_1p_3q_3q_2\n\nwhere p_3 = q_1p_2q_1^(-1) ∈ P and q_3 = q_1^(-1)q_2 ∈ Q, since P and Q are normal subgroups. Thus, r_1r_2 ∈ R, and R is closed under the group operation.\n\nThe identity element e ∈ P and e ∈ Q, so e = ee ∈ R. For any r = pq ∈ R, its inverse is given by r^(-1) = q^(-1)p^(-1) ∈ R, since q^(-1) ∈ Q and p^(-1) ∈ P. Therefore, R is a subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we will show that R = G. Since |P| = 7 and |Q| = 11, and P and Q are disjoint except for the identity element, we have:\n\n|R| = |P| * |Q| = 7 * 11 = 77\n\nSince |R| = |G|, we have R = G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic (if P and Q are not distinct) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11 (if P and Q are distinct)."
