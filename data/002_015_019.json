    "message_2": "The perimeter (or circumference) of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nGiven that the radius (r) is 7 cm, we can calculate the circumference (C) as follows:\n\nC = 2π(7 cm)\nC ≈ 2 × 3.14159 × 7 cm\nC ≈ 43.9823 cm\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 43.98 cm."
