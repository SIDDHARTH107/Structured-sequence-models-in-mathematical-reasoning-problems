    "message_1": "A candy company is developing a new flavor of gummies. They want to test three different concentrations of the flavoring: low, medium, and high. They plan to make two batches of gummies at each concentration level. They want to randomize the order in which the batches are made and the order in which the different concentrations are tested. How many different experimental designs are possible?",
    "message_2": "There are three concentration levels (low, medium, and high), and two batches of gummies for each concentration level. This means there are a total of 3 * 2 = 6 batches of gummies.\n\nTo find the number of different experimental designs, we need to find the number of ways to arrange these 6 batches. This is a permutation problem, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nn! / (n - r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (6 batches) and r is the number of items to be arranged (also 6 batches in this case).\n\nSo, the number of different experimental designs is:\n\n6! / (6 - 6)!\n\n6! / 0!\n\n6! / 1 (since 0! = 1)\n\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n\nTherefore, there are 720 different experimental designs possible."
