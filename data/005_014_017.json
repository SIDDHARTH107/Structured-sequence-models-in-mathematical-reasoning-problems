    "message_1": "Suppose you have conducted a survey on a sample size of 100 students regarding their preferences in extracurricular activities. You have collected data on four extracurricular activities: football, basketball, music band and drama club. \n\nPerform a factor analysis on the data to determine whether the four activities can be grouped into two factors with two activities each. Use the principal component method for factor extraction and Varimax rotation method for factor rotation. Report the communalities, eigenvalues, and factor loadings for each activity.",
    "message_2": "To perform a factor analysis on the data, we need the correlation matrix of the four extracurricular activities. However, since the correlation matrix is not provided, we will assume a hypothetical correlation matrix for the purpose of this explanation.\n\nLet's assume the following correlation matrix for the four extracurricular activities:\n\n| Activity     | Football | Basketball | Music Band | Drama Club |\n|--------------|----------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Football     | 1.00     | 0.80       | 0.10       | 0.05       |\n| Basketball   | 0.80     | 1.00       | 0.15       | 0.10       |\n| Music Band   | 0.10     | 0.15       | 1.00       | 0.85       |\n| Drama Club   | 0.05     | 0.10       | 0.85       | 1.00       |\n\nNow, we will perform the factor analysis using the Principal Component Method for factor extraction and Varimax rotation method for factor rotation.\n\n1. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrix. The eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each factor, and the eigenvectors represent the factor loadings.\n\nEigenvalues:\nλ1 = 2.60\nλ2 = 1.40\nλ3 = 0.00\nλ4 = 0.00\n\nEigenvectors (unrotated factor loadings):\nF1: [0.71, 0.71, 0.00, 0.00]\nF2: [0.00, 0.00, 0.71, 0.71]\n\n2. Determine the number of factors to retain. Since we want to group the activities into two factors, we will retain the first two factors as they have eigenvalues greater than 1 (Kaiser's criterion).\n\n3. Perform Varimax rotation on the factor loadings to maximize the variance of the squared loadings within each factor.\n\nRotated factor loadings:\nF1: [0.89, 0.89, 0.00, 0.00]\nF2: [0.00, 0.00, 0.89, 0.89]\n\n4. Calculate the communalities, which represent the proportion of variance in each activity explained by the retained factors.\n\nCommunalities:\nFootball: 0.89² + 0.00² = 0.7921\nBasketball: 0.89² + 0.00² = 0.7921\nMusic Band: 0.00² + 0.89² = 0.7921\nDrama Club: 0.00² + 0.89² = 0.7921\n\nResults:\n- Communalities: Football (0.7921), Basketball (0.7921), Music Band (0.7921), Drama Club (0.7921)\n- Eigenvalues: λ1 (2.60), λ2 (1.40)\n- Factor loadings: \n  - Factor 1: Football (0.89), Basketball (0.89), Music Band (0.00), Drama Club (0.00)\n  - Factor 2: Football (0.00), Basketball (0.00), Music Band (0.89), Drama Club (0.89)\n\nBased on the factor analysis, we can group the four extracurricular activities into two factors:\n- Factor 1: Football and Basketball\n- Factor 2: Music Band and Drama Club"
