    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x and y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4  5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 11 |\n    | 19 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (denoted as A^(-1)). To do this, we first find the determinant of A (denoted as |A|).\n\n|A| = (2 * 5) - (3 * 4) = 10 - 12 = -2\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we can find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/|A|) * adj(A)\n\nwhere adj(A) is the adjugate of matrix A. The adjugate of a 2x2 matrix is obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the signs of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nadj(A) = |  5  -3 |\n         | -4   2 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-2) * |  5  -3 |\n                 | -4   2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | -5/2  3/2 |\n         |  2    -1  |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = | -5/2  3/2 | * | 11 |\n    |  2    -1  |   | 19 |\n\nX = | (-5/2)*11 + (3/2)*19 |\n    |  2*11 - 1*19         |\n\nX = | -55/2 + 57/2 |\n    |  22 - 19     |\n\nX = | 2 |\n    | 3 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2 and y = 3."
