Suppose further that there exists a divisor D on X such that the morphism f is an isomorphism between X\\D and Y\\D. Then, show that X and Y are birational.",
    "message_2": "To show that X and Y are birational, we need to find a rational map between them. Since f is an isomorphism between X\\D and Y\\D, we can restrict f to X\\D and obtain a rational map g: X\\D --> Y. \n\nNow, let's consider the fibers of f. Since all fibers are rational curves, they are all birational to the projective line P^1. Let F_x be the fiber of f over a point x in Y. Then, we have a rational map h_x: F_x --> P^1. \n\nWe can now define a rational map h: X --> P^1 x Y by sending a point x in X to the point (h_x(f(x)), f(x)) in P^1 x Y. Notice that h is well-defined since h_x is a rational map for each x in X.\n\nNow, consider the projection map p: P^1 x Y --> Y. We can compose p with h to obtain a rational map p ∘ h: X --> Y. Since f is an isomorphism between X\\D and Y\\D, the map p ∘ h restricted to X\\D is the same as the map g: X\\D --> Y. Thus, p ∘ h is a rational map between X and Y that agrees with the isomorphism f on the open subset X\\D.\n\nFinally, we can show that X and Y are birational by constructing an inverse rational map for p ∘ h. Since f is an isomorphism between X\\D and Y\\D, we can take the inverse isomorphism f^(-1): Y\\D --> X\\D. Then, we can extend f^(-1) to a rational map g': Y --> X by sending a point y in Y to f^(-1)(y) if y is in Y\\D and to an arbitrary point in the fiber F_y otherwise.\n\nNow, we have the rational maps p ∘ h: X --> Y and g': Y --> X, which are inverse to each other on the open subsets X\\D and Y\\D. Therefore, X and Y are birational."
