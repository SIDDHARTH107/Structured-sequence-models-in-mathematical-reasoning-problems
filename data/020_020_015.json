    "message_1": "A company is designing a rectangular billboard that will be displayed on a busy road. The length of the billboard must be 5 meters more than its height, and the perimeter must be no more than 50 meters. What should be the dimensions of the billboard to maximize its area?",
    "message_2": "Let the height of the billboard be h meters and the length be l meters. According to the problem, the length is 5 meters more than the height, so we can write l = h + 5.\n\nThe perimeter of the billboard is given by P = 2l + 2h. Since the perimeter must be no more than 50 meters, we have:\n\n2l + 2h ≤ 50\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for l from the first equation into the inequality:\n\n2(h + 5) + 2h ≤ 50\n2h + 10 + 2h ≤ 50\n4h ≤ 40\nh ≤ 10\n\nSo, the height of the billboard must be no more than 10 meters. Now, we want to maximize the area of the billboard, which is given by A = lh. Substituting the expression for l again, we get:\n\nA = (h + 5)h\nA = h^2 + 5h\n\nTo maximize the area, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of A with respect to h and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dh = 2h + 5\n\nSetting dA/dh = 0, we get:\n\n2h + 5 = 0\n2h = -5\nh = -2.5\n\nHowever, since the height cannot be negative, this critical point is not valid. Therefore, the maximum area must occur at one of the endpoints of the allowed range for h, which are h = 0 and h = 10. \n\nWhen h = 0, the area A = 0. When h = 10, the length l = 10 + 5 = 15, and the area A = 10 * 15 = 150 square meters.\n\nThus, to maximize the area of the billboard, the dimensions should be 10 meters in height and 15 meters in length."
