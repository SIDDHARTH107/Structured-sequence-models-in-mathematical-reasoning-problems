    "message_2": "First, let's recall some basic facts about groups and their subgroups:\n\n1. The order of a subgroup divides the order of the group (Lagrange's theorem).\n2. A group of order p, where p is a prime number, is cyclic and isomorphic to Z_p (the additive group of integers modulo p).\n3. If a group G has a normal subgroup H and a subgroup K such that G = HK and H ∩ K = {e}, then G is isomorphic to the direct product H x K (the internal direct product theorem).\n\nNow, let's prove that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20:\n\nSince G has order 20 and H has order 4, the index of H in G is [G:H] = 20/4 = 5. By the second fact above, G has a subgroup K of order 5, which is isomorphic to Z_5. Since the order of K is 5, which is prime, K is cyclic and thus normal in G.\n\nNow, we have two normal subgroups H and K in G. We want to show that G is isomorphic to the direct product H x K. To do this, we need to show that G = HK and H ∩ K = {e}.\n\nSince H and K are normal in G, the product HK is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, the order of HK is |H||K|/|H ∩ K|. Since |H| = 4 and |K| = 5, we have |H||K| = 20, which is the order of G. Thus, if we can show that H ∩ K = {e}, then we will have G = HK and G will be isomorphic to the direct product H x K.\n\nTo show that H ∩ K = {e}, we can use the fact that the orders of H and K are relatively prime (4 and 5 are coprime). If there is an element x in H ∩ K, then the order of x must divide both |H| and |K|. The only divisor of both 4 and 5 is 1, so the order of x must be 1. Thus, x = e, and H ∩ K = {e}.\n\nNow we have shown that G = HK and H ∩ K = {e}, so by the internal direct product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product H x K. Since H is a group of order 4 and K is a group of order 5, G is isomorphic to a group of order 20. \n\nFinally, we need to show that G is non-abelian. Since H has order 4, it can be either isomorphic to Z_4 or to the Klein four-group V_4. If H is isomorphic to Z_4, then G would be isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_5, which is abelian. However, we are given that H is normal in G, and in this case, H would not be normal in G. Therefore, H must be isomorphic to V_4. Thus, G is isomorphic to V_4 x Z_5, which is a non-abelian group of order 20."
