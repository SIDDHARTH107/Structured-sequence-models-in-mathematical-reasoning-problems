    "message_2": "There are three distinct groups of order 10: the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5, and the non-abelian group of order 10.\n\n1. Cyclic group C10:\nThe cyclic group of order 10 is generated by a single element, say a, such that a^10 = 1 and a^n ≠ 1 for 0 < n < 10. This group is abelian, and its elements are {1, a, a^2, ..., a^9}. The group operation is multiplication modulo 10.\n\n2. Dihedral group D5:\nThe dihedral group of order 10, denoted as D5, is the group of symmetries of a regular pentagon. It consists of 5 rotations and 5 reflections. We can represent the elements of D5 as {r^n, sr^n | n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, where r is the rotation by 72 degrees (1/5 of a full rotation) and s is a reflection. The group operation is composition of symmetries, and the group has the following relations: r^5 = 1, s^2 = 1, and sr = r^4s.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 10:\nLet G be a non-abelian group of order 10. By the Sylow theorems, G must have a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, of order 5. Since the order of H is prime, H must be cyclic, so H ≅ C5. Let K be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G, which has order 2. Since G is non-abelian, K cannot be a normal subgroup of G. The group G can be expressed as a semi-direct product of H and K: G = H ⋊ K.\n\nNow, we will show that all groups of order 10 are isomorphic to one of these three groups:\n\n1. If a group of order 10 is abelian, it must be isomorphic to C10. This is because the only abelian groups of order 10 are C10 and C2 × C5, but C2 × C5 is isomorphic to C10.\n\n2. If a group of order 10 is non-abelian and has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be isomorphic to D5. This is because the semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a cyclic group of order 2 with the non-trivial action is isomorphic to D5.\n\n3. If a group of order 10 is non-abelian and has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10 described above. This is because the semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a cyclic group of order 2 with the trivial action is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10.\n\nThus, all groups of order 10 are isomorphic to either C10, D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10."
