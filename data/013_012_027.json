    "message_1": "Consider two firms, A and B, who are competing in a Stackelberg competition. Firm A is the leader and sets the quantity first, while Firm B is the follower and adjusts its quantity based on Firm A's output. \n\nSuppose that the demand curve is given by p = 100 - Q, where p is the price and Q is the total quantity produced by both firms. Firm A has a constant marginal cost of $20 per unit, while Firm B has a constant marginal cost of $30 per unit. \n\nAssuming that Firm A acts rationally as the leader, what quantity will Firm A produce and what quantity will Firm B produce? What will be the price of the product in this case?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the reaction function for Firm B, which is the quantity it will produce given the quantity produced by Firm A. Then, we will find the profit-maximizing quantity for Firm A, taking into account Firm B's reaction function. Finally, we will find the equilibrium quantities for both firms and the resulting market price.\n\nStep 1: Find Firm B's reaction function\nFirm B's profit function is given by:\nπ_B = (p - MC_B) * q_B = (100 - Q - MC_B) * q_B = (100 - q_A - q_B - 30) * q_B = (70 - q_A - q_B) * q_B\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm B will choose q_B such that its marginal profit is zero:\ndπ_B / dq_B = 70 - q_A - 2q_B = 0\n\nFirm B's reaction function is:\nq_B = (70 - q_A) / 2\n\nStep 2: Find Firm A's profit-maximizing quantity\nFirm A's profit function is given by:\nπ_A = (p - MC_A) * q_A = (100 - Q - MC_A) * q_A = (100 - q_A - q_B - 20) * q_A = (80 - q_A - q_B) * q_A\n\nSubstitute Firm B's reaction function into Firm A's profit function:\nπ_A = (80 - q_A - (70 - q_A) / 2) * q_A = (90 - 1.5q_A) * q_A\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm A will choose q_A such that its marginal profit is zero:\ndπ_A / dq_A = 90 - 3q_A = 0\n\nSolving for q_A, we get:\nq_A = 30\n\nStep 3: Find Firm B's equilibrium quantity\nUsing Firm B's reaction function, we can find its equilibrium quantity:\nq_B = (70 - q_A) / 2 = (70 - 30) / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20\n\nStep 4: Find the market price\nThe demand curve is given by p = 100 - Q. Substituting the equilibrium quantities for both firms, we get:\np = 100 - (q_A + q_B) = 100 - (30 + 20) = 100 - 50 = 50\n\nIn this Stackelberg competition, Firm A will produce 30 units, Firm B will produce 20 units, and the market price will be $50 per unit."
