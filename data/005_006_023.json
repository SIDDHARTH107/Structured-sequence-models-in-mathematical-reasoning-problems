    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected student is taller than 68 inches, we will use the central limit theorem and the z-score formula. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for (68 inches), μ is the mean (65 inches), and σ is the standard deviation (3.5 inches).\n\nFirst, calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (68 - 65) / 3.5\nz = 3 / 3.5\nz ≈ 0.857\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that corresponds to this z-score. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find the probability. The probability for a z-score of 0.857 is approximately 0.804. However, this is the probability that a student is shorter than 68 inches. To find the probability that a student is taller than 68 inches, we need to subtract this value from 1:\n\nProbability (taller than 68 inches) = 1 - 0.804\nProbability (taller than 68 inches) ≈ 0.196\n\nSo, according to the central limit theorem, the probability that a randomly selected student from this sample is taller than 68 inches is approximately 19.6%."
