    "message_2": "To find the degree of the intersection of the two curves $X$ and $Y$, we first need to find the degrees of the individual curves.\n\nFor curve $X$, we have the equation $y^2z = x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z)$. The degree of this curve is the maximum total degree of its monomials. In this case, the highest degree term is $x^3$, so the degree of curve $X$ is 3.\n\nFor curve $Y$, we have the equation $x(x-\\mu z) + y^2z = 0$. The highest degree term is $x^2z$, so the degree of curve $Y$ is 2.\n\nNow, we use the BÃ©zout's theorem, which states that the degree of the intersection of two algebraic curves in the projective plane is the product of the degrees of the two curves, unless they have a common component. In this case, there is no common component between the two curves, so the degree of the intersection is:\n\n$deg(X \\cap Y) = deg(X) \\cdot deg(Y) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6$\n\nTherefore, the degree of the intersection of the two curves $X$ and $Y$ is 6."
