    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the vector of variables, and b is the vector of constants.\n\nA = |  2  3  4 |\n    | -2  5  3 |\n    |  4 -1 -2 |\n\nb = | 11 |\n    |  3 |\n    |  7 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we decompose A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we find the orthonormal basis for the column space of A:\n\nu1 = (2, -2, 4)\ne1 = u1 / ||u1|| = (1/3, -1/3, 2/3)\n\nu2 = (3, 5, -1) - ((3, 5, -1) • e1) * e1\nu2 = (3, 5, -1) - (3) * (1/3, -1/3, 2/3)\nu2 = (0, 6, -3)\ne2 = u2 / ||u2|| = (0, 1, -1/2)\n\nu3 = (4, 3, -2) - ((4, 3, -2) • e1) * e1 - ((4, 3, -2) • e2) * e2\nu3 = (4, 3, -2) - (4) * (1/3, -1/3, 2/3) - (3) * (0, 1, -1/2)\nu3 = (0, 0, 1)\ne3 = u3 / ||u3|| = (0, 0, 1)\n\nNow we form the orthogonal matrix Q and the upper triangular matrix R:\n\nQ = |  1/3  0  0 |\n    | -1/3  1 -0 |\n    |  2/3 -1/2 1 |\n\nR = | 6  6  4 |\n    | 0  6 -3 |\n    | 0  0  1 |\n\nNow we have A = QR. To solve for x, we can use the fact that Q is orthogonal, which means Q^T = Q^(-1). So, we have:\n\nQ^T * Ax = Q^T * b\nRx = Q^T * b\n\nNow we can solve for x using back-substitution:\n\nQ^T * b = |  1/3  -1/3  2/3 | * | 11 |\n          |    0    1  -1/2 |   |  3 |\n          |    0    0    1  |   |  7 |\n\nQ^T * b = | 3 |\n          | 5 |\n          | 7 |\n\nNow we solve the system Rx = Q^T * b using back-substitution:\n\n| 6  6  4 | | x |   | 3 |\n| 0  6 -3 | | y | = | 5 |\n| 0  0  1  | | z |   | 7 |\n\nFrom the last row, we have z = 7.\n\nNow, we can substitute z into the second row to find y:\n\n6y - 3(7) = 5\n6y = 26\ny = 13/3\n\nFinally, we substitute y and z into the first row to find x:\n\n6x + 6(13/3) + 4(7) = 3\n6x = -33\nx = -11/2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -11/2\ny = 13/3\nz = 7"
