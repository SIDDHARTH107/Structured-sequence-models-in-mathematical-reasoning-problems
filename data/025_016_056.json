    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth projective curve of genus 2 defined over the field of rational numbers. Consider the rational map f: X --> P^1 obtained by projecting from a point p on X. Suppose that the preimage of every point in P^1 consists of exactly two points. How many such rational maps f are there?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given information. We have a smooth projective curve X of genus 2, and a rational map f: X --> P^1. The preimage of every point in P^1 consists of exactly two points. This means that the degree of the map f is 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, which relates the genus of the source curve (X), the genus of the target curve (P^1), the degree of the map (f), and the ramification points:\n\n2g(X) - 2 = d(2g(P^1) - 2) + Σ(e_i - 1),\n\nwhere g(X) and g(P^1) are the genera of X and P^1, respectively, d is the degree of the map f, and e_i are the ramification indices of the ramification points.\n\nIn our case, g(X) = 2, g(P^1) = 0, and d = 2. Plugging these values into the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, we get:\n\n2(2) - 2 = 2(2(0) - 2) + Σ(e_i - 1).\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n2 = Σ(e_i - 1).\n\nSince the ramification indices e_i are positive integers, the only possible values for the e_i are e_1 = 2 and e_2 = 2. This means that there are exactly two ramification points on X.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible locations of the point p on X. If p is not one of the ramification points, then the map f will not have the desired property of having exactly two points in the preimage of every point in P^1. Therefore, the point p must be one of the ramification points.\n\nSince there are exactly two ramification points on X, there are two possible choices for the point p. Thus, there are two distinct rational maps f: X --> P^1 with the given properties."
