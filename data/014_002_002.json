    "message_1": "Suppose Alice chooses a prime number p = 443 and a primitive root g = 3. She wants to communicate securely with Bob using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. Alice chooses a secret number a = 7 and calculates A = g^a mod p. If Bob's secret number is b = 13 and his corresponding public value is B = g^b mod p. What is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for encryption and decryption?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate Alice's public value A and Bob's public value B.\n\nA = g^a mod p\nA = 3^7 mod 443\nA = 2187 mod 443\nA = 49\n\nB = g^b mod p\nB = 3^13 mod 443\nB = 1594323 mod 443\nB = 431\n\nNow, Alice and Bob can compute the shared secret key using each other's public values and their own secret numbers.\n\nShared secret key for Alice (s_A) = B^a mod p\ns_A = 431^7 mod 443\ns_A = 64198915931 mod 443\ns_A = 99\n\nShared secret key for Bob (s_B) = A^b mod p\ns_B = 49^13 mod 443\ns_B = 49533875149 mod 443\ns_B = 99\n\nAs we can see, the shared secret key for both Alice and Bob is the same, which is 99. They can now use this shared secret key for encryption and decryption."
