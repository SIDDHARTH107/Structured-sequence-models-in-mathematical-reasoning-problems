    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to design a support bracket with a rectangular cross-section to hold a load of 5000 Newtons. The bracket must be made of aluminum and the total volume of the bracket should not exceed 4 cubic meters. The cost of aluminum is $2.00 per cubic meter. Find the dimensions of the rectangular cross-section that will minimize the cost of the bracket.",
    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the rectangular cross-section be x, y, and z, where x and y are the width and height of the cross-section, and z is the length of the bracket. The volume of the bracket is given by V = xyz, and the cost of the bracket is given by C = 2V.\n\nWe are given that the total volume of the bracket should not exceed 4 cubic meters, so we have the constraint:\n\nxyz ≤ 4\n\nWe also know that the bracket must hold a load of 5000 Newtons. The strength of the bracket is proportional to the product of its width and the square of its height (x * y^2). Therefore, we have:\n\nx * y^2 ≥ 5000\n\nOur goal is to minimize the cost of the bracket, C = 2V = 2xyz, subject to the constraints above.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce two multipliers, λ and μ, and form the Lagrangian function:\n\nL(x, y, z, λ, μ) = 2xyz + λ(4 - xyz) - μ(5000 - x * y^2)\n\nNow we take the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, z, λ, and μ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x = 2yz - λyz + μy^2 = 0\n∂L/∂y = 2xz - λxz - 2μxy = 0\n∂L/∂z = 2xy - λxy = 0\n∂L/∂λ = 4 - xyz = 0\n∂L/∂μ = 5000 - x * y^2 = 0\n\nFrom ∂L/∂z, we have 2xy - λxy = 0, which implies that either xy = 0 or λ = 2. Since xy = 0 would mean that the bracket has no volume, we must have λ = 2.\n\nNow we can substitute λ = 2 into the equations for ∂L/∂x and ∂L/∂y:\n\n2yz - 2yz + μy^2 = 0 => μy^2 = 0\n2xz - 2xz - 2μxy = 0 => -2μxy = 0\n\nSince y and x cannot be zero (otherwise the bracket would have no volume), we must have μ = 0.\n\nNow we can substitute λ = 2 and μ = 0 back into the constraint equations:\n\n4 - xyz = 0 => xyz = 4\n5000 - x * y^2 = 0 => x * y^2 = 5000\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the dimensions x and y:\n\nDivide the second equation by the first equation:\n\n(y^2) / z = 5000 / 4 => y^2 = 1250z\n\nNow substitute z = 4 / (xy) from the first equation into the equation above:\n\ny^2 = 1250 * (4 / (xy)) => y^3 = 5000x\n\nNow substitute x = 5000 / y^2 from the second equation into the equation above:\n\ny^3 = 5000 * (5000 / y^2) => y^5 = 25,000,000\n\nTaking the fifth root of both sides, we get:\n\ny = (25,000,000)^(1/5) ≈ 7.96\n\nNow we can find x:\n\nx = 5000 / y^2 ≈ 5000 / (7.96^2) ≈ 7.96\n\nFinally, we can find z:\n\nz = 4 / (xy) ≈ 4 / (7.96 * 7.96) ≈ 7.96\n\nSo the dimensions of the rectangular cross-section that will minimize the cost of the bracket are approximately x = 7.96, y = 7.96, and z = 7.96 meters."
