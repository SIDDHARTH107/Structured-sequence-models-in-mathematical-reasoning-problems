    "message_2": "To solve the given initial value problem using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given function and the given differential equation. Let Y(ω) be the Fourier transform of y(t), then the Fourier transform of the given differential equation is:\n\n(ω^2 + 4ω + 4)Y(ω) = F{cos(3t)}\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of cos(3t). Using the Fourier transform formula, we have:\n\nF{cos(3t)} = ∫[cos(3t) * e^(-jωt)] dt (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nThe integral of cos(3t) * e^(-jωt) can be solved using integration by parts. Let u = cos(3t) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = -3sin(3t) dt and v = (-1/jω)e^(-jωt). Using integration by parts, we get:\n\n∫[cos(3t) * e^(-jωt)] dt = uv - ∫(v * du)\n= cos(3t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt) - ∫[-3sin(3t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt) dt]\n\nNow, let u = -3sin(3t) and dv = (-1/jω)e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = -9cos(3t) dt and v = (-1/ω^2)e^(-jωt). Using integration by parts again, we get:\n\n∫[-3sin(3t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt) dt] = uv - ∫(v * du)\n= -3sin(3t) * (-1/ω^2)e^(-jωt) - ∫[-9cos(3t) * (-1/ω^2)e^(-jωt) dt]\n\nNow, we have:\n\nF{cos(3t)} = cos(3t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt) + 3sin(3t) * (-1/ω^2)e^(-jωt) + 9∫[cos(3t) * (-1/ω^2)e^(-jωt) dt]\n\nThe integral on the right side is the same as the original integral, so we can rewrite it as:\n\nF{cos(3t)} = cos(3t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt) + 3sin(3t) * (-1/ω^2)e^(-jωt) + 9F{cos(3t)}\n\nNow, we can solve for F{cos(3t)}:\n\nF{cos(3t)} = (cos(3t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt) + 3sin(3t) * (-1/ω^2)e^(-jωt)) / (1 - 9)\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the differential equation in the frequency domain:\n\n(ω^2 + 4ω + 4)Y(ω) = (cos(3t) * (-1/jω)e^(-jωt) + 3sin(3t) * (-1/ω^2)e^(-jωt)) / (1 - 9)\n\nTo find the solution y(t), we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω):\n\ny(t) = F^(-1){(ω^2 + 4ω + 4)Y(ω)}\n\nUsing the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0, we can find the constants in the solution:\n\ny(0) = 1 = F^(-1){(ω^2 + 4ω + 4)Y(ω)}(0)\ny'(0) = 0 = F^(-1){(ω^2 + 4ω + 4)Y(ω)}'(0)\n\nSolving these equations, we get the solution y(t) in the time domain:\n\ny(t) = e^(-2t) + (1/8)cos(3t) - (1/8)e^(-2t)cos(3t)\n\nThis is the solution to the given initial value problem."
