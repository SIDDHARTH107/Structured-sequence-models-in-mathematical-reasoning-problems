    "message_2": "First, we need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x).\n\nFor f(x) = (2x^2 - 1)^3, we can use the chain rule. Let u = 2x^2 - 1, then f(x) = u^3. The derivative of u with respect to x is:\n\ndu/dx = d(2x^2 - 1)/dx = 4x\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of f(x) with respect to u:\n\ndf/du = d(u^3)/du = 3u^2\n\nUsing the chain rule, we can find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = df/dx = df/du * du/dx = 3u^2 * 4x = 3(2x^2 - 1)^2 * 4x\n\nFor g(x) = 5x + 2, the derivative is:\n\ng'(x) = d(5x + 2)/dx = 5\n\nNow, we need to find f'(g(1)) and g'(1):\n\ng(1) = 5(1) + 2 = 7\n\nf'(g(1)) = f'(7) = 3(2(7)^2 - 1)^2 * 4(7) = 3(2(49) - 1)^2 * 28 = 3(97)^2 * 28\n\ng'(1) = 5\n\nFinally, we can find f'(g(1))g'(1):\n\nf'(g(1))g'(1) = (3(97)^2 * 28) * 5 = 15(97)^2 * 28 = 15 * 9409 * 28 = 3973020"
