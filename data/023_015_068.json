    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written in the form:\n\n$u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$\n\nSubstituting this into the given partial differential equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) - c^2 X''(x)T(t) = 0$\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = c^2 \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on position, they must be equal to a constant, which we'll call $-\\lambda$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = c^2 \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$T''(t) + \\lambda T(t) = 0$\n\n$X''(x) + \\frac{\\lambda}{c^2} X(x) = 0$\n\nWe are given the initial conditions:\n\n$u(x, 0) = X(x)T(0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$\n\n$u_t(x, 0) = X(x)T'(0) = 0$\n\nFrom the first initial condition, we know that $T(0) = 1$. The second initial condition implies that $T'(0) = 0$. \n\nNow, we can solve the spatial equation:\n\n$X''(x) + \\frac{\\lambda}{c^2} X(x) = 0$\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem. For simplicity, let's assume that the domain of x is $[0, 1]$. The general solution of the spatial equation is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{c^2}}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{c^2}}x)$\n\nApplying the initial condition $u(x, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$, we get:\n\n$X(x) = B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{c^2}}x)$\n\nSince $u(x, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$, we can conclude that $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{c^2}} = \\pi$ and $B = 1$. Therefore, $X(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n\nNow, we can solve the temporal equation:\n\n$T''(t) + \\lambda T(t) = 0$\n\n$T''(t) + \\pi^2 c^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nThe general solution of the temporal equation is:\n\n$T(t) = C\\cos(\\pi ct) + D\\sin(\\pi ct)$\n\nApplying the initial conditions $T(0) = 1$ and $T'(0) = 0$, we get:\n\n$T(t) = \\cos(\\pi ct)$\n\nFinally, the solution of the wave equation is:\n\n$u(x, t) = X(x)T(t) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi ct)$"
