    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector representing the first 15 minutes on the clock, we need to find the arc length of the sector and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angle of the sector. Since a clock has 60 minutes in total and a full circle is 360 degrees, each minute represents 360/60 = 6 degrees. Therefore, the first 15 minutes represent an angle of 15 * 6 = 90 degrees.\n\nNow, we can find the arc length of the sector. The formula for the arc length is:\n\nArc length = (θ/360) * 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is approximately 3.14159.\n\nArc length = (90/360) * 2 * 3.14159 * 6\nArc length = (1/4) * 2 * 3.14159 * 6\nArc length = 0.5 * 3.14159 * 6\nArc length ≈ 9.42477 cm\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the sector by adding the arc length to the two radii:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2 * Radius\nPerimeter ≈ 9.42477 + 2 * 6\nPerimeter ≈ 9.42477 + 12\nPerimeter ≈ 21.42477 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector representing the first 15 minutes on the clock is approximately 21.42 cm."
