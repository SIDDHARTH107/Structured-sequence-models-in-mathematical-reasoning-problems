    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of H¹(X,L), we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a smooth curve X and a divisor D on X, we have:\n\nh^0(X, L(D)) - h^1(X, L(D)) = deg(D) + 1 - g(X),\n\nwhere h^0(X, L(D)) and h^1(X, L(D)) are the dimensions of the global sections and the first cohomology group of the line bundle L(D), respectively, deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D, and g(X) is the genus of the curve X.\n\nIn our case, we are given that the degree of the line bundle L is 5, so deg(D) = 5. To find the genus g(X) of the smooth plane curve X of degree 5, we can use the formula:\n\ng(X) = (d-1)(d-2)/2,\n\nwhere d is the degree of the curve. In our case, d = 5, so:\n\ng(X) = (5-1)(5-2)/2 = 4*3/2 = 6.\n\nNow we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = deg(D) + 1 - g(X) = 5 + 1 - 6 = 0.\n\nSince h^0(X, L) is the dimension of the global sections of L, it is always non-negative. In this case, h^0(X, L) = 0, which implies that there are no global sections of L. Therefore, we have:\n\nh^1(X, L) = 0.\n\nSo the dimension of the vector space H¹(X,L) is 0."
