    "message_1": "Suppose you are organizing a tennis tournament and you have 12 players. Each player will play against every other player exactly once. How many matches will be played in total?",
    "message_2": "To determine the total number of matches, we can use the formula for combinations, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of players and k is the size of the combination (in this case, 2 players per match).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12-2)!)\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2! * 10!)\nC(12, 2) = (12 * 11 * 10!)/(2! * 10!)\nC(12, 2) = (12 * 11)/(2 * 1)\nC(12, 2) = 66\n\nTherefore, there will be a total of 66 matches played in the tournament."
