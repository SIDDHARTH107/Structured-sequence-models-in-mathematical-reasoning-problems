    "message_2": "Using Ramsey theory, we can solve this problem by finding the minimum number of handshakes required to guarantee that at least 3 people have shaken hands with each other. \n\nLet's denote the people at the party as A, B, C, D, E, and F. We will use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. \n\nConsider person A. They can shake hands with 5 other people (B, C, D, E, and F). If A shakes hands with at least 3 of them, say B, C, and D, then either B, C, and D have all shaken hands with each other (forming a group of 3 people who have all shaken hands), or at least one of them has not shaken hands with the others. \n\nIf at least one of B, C, and D has not shaken hands with the others, then there must be another person (E or F) that they have shaken hands with. In this case, we can form a group of 3 people who have all shaken hands with each other by including the person who has not shaken hands with B, C, or D and the person they have shaken hands with (E or F).\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, A shakes hands with 3 people (B, C, and D), and at least one of them has not shaken hands with the others. This requires a minimum of 3 handshakes.\n\nNow, let's consider the handshakes among B, C, and D. If any of them shake hands with each other, we have a group of 3 people who have all shaken hands. So, in the worst-case scenario, none of them shake hands with each other, and they each shake hands with the remaining 2 people (E and F). This requires a minimum of 3 additional handshakes.\n\nThus, the minimum number of handshakes required to guarantee that at least 3 people have shaken hands with each other is 3 (A with B, C, and D) + 3 (B, C, and D with E and F) = 6 handshakes."
