    "message_1": "A group of 5 friends want to ride on a roller-coaster that has 9 seats. The roller-coaster has 3 identical sections, each with 3 seats. In how many ways can the group of friends choose their seats such that no two friends are sitting together in the same section?",
    "message_2": "Let's consider the problem step by step. First, we need to distribute the 5 friends among the 3 sections. We can do this using the stars and bars method. We have 5 friends (stars) and 2 dividers (bars) to separate the 3 sections. So, we have a total of 7 positions to place the stars and bars.\n\nWe can choose 2 positions for the bars out of 7 in C(7,2) ways, which is equal to 21 ways. Now, let's consider the seating arrangements within each section.\n\nCase 1: Distribution (3,1,1)\nIn this case, one section has 3 friends, and the other two sections have 1 friend each. There are 3! ways to arrange the friends in the section with 3 friends. Since there are 3 sections, there are 3 ways to choose which section has the 3 friends. So, the total number of arrangements for this case is 3! * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18.\n\nCase 2: Distribution (2,2,1)\nIn this case, two sections have 2 friends each, and the remaining section has 1 friend. There are 2! ways to arrange the friends in each of the sections with 2 friends. Since there are 3 sections, there are 3 ways to choose which section has only 1 friend. So, the total number of arrangements for this case is (2! * 2!) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to distribute the friends among the sections (21) by the sum of the number of arrangements within each case (18 + 12).\n\nTotal number of ways = 21 * (18 + 12) = 21 * 30 = 630.\n\nSo, there are 630 ways for the group of friends to choose their seats such that no two friends are sitting together in the same section."
