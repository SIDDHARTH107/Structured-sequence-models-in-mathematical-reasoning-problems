    "message_1": "Sure, here is a problem:\n\nSuppose you intercept a ciphertext that was encrypted using a transposition cipher. The ciphertext has 80 letters and the transposition matrix used was a 10x8 matrix. Determine how many rows were used in the original plaintext matrix before it was transposed.",
    "message_2": "In a transposition cipher, the plaintext is written into a matrix and then read out in a different order to create the ciphertext. In this case, the ciphertext has 80 letters and the transposition matrix used was a 10x8 matrix.\n\nSince the transposition matrix has 10 columns and 8 rows, it can hold a total of 10 * 8 = 80 letters. This means that the original plaintext matrix also had to hold 80 letters.\n\nTo find the number of rows in the original plaintext matrix, we need to consider that the matrix was transposed. When a matrix is transposed, its rows become columns and its columns become rows. Therefore, the original plaintext matrix had the same number of rows as the transposition matrix had columns.\n\nSo, the original plaintext matrix had 10 rows before it was transposed."
