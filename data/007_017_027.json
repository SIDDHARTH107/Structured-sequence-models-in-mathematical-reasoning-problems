    "message_2": "A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number. To find the smallest twin prime greater than 100, we can start by checking prime numbers greater than 100 and see if either the number itself or the number 2 less than it is also prime.\n\n101 is prime, but 99 is not prime (3 * 33).\n103 is prime, and 101 is prime.\n\nSo, the smallest twin prime greater than 100 is 101 and its twin is 103."
