    "message_1": "A thin wire of length 10 cm is fixed at both ends. When the wire is plucked, it vibrates in a way that is described by the following partial differential equation: \n\n$\\frac{\\partial^{2}y}{\\partial t^{2}} = c^{2}\\frac{\\partial^{2}y}{\\partial x^{2}}$\n\nwhere $y(x,t)$ represents the position of a point on the wire at time $t$, $c$ is a constant that depends on the tension and density of the wire, and $x$ is the distance along the wire.\n\nIf the initial position of the wire is given by $y(x,0) = 10\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{5}x)$ and the initial velocity is given by $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$, find the solution $y(x,t)$ for $x\\in[0,10]$ and $t\\geq 0$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written in the form:\n\n$y(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$\n\nSubstituting this into the partial differential equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) = c^2 X''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = c^2 \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = -k^2 = c^2 \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$T''(t) + k^2 T(t) = 0$\n\n$X''(x) + \\frac{k^2}{c^2} X(x) = 0$\n\nThe boundary conditions for $X(x)$ are $X(0) = X(10) = 0$. The general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{10}x) + B\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi}{10}x)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get $B = 0$ and $A\\sin(n\\pi) = 0$. Since $A$ cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have $n\\pi = m\\pi$ for some integer $m$. Thus, $n = m$ and:\n\n$X(x) = A\\sin(\\frac{m\\pi}{10}x)$\n\nNow, we solve the equation for $T(t)$:\n\n$T''(t) + k^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nThis is a simple harmonic oscillator equation with the general solution:\n\n$T(t) = C\\cos(kt) + D\\sin(kt)$\n\nSince the initial velocity is zero, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t}(x,0) = X(x)T'(0) = 0$\n\nThis implies $D = 0$, so:\n\n$T(t) = C\\cos(kt)$\n\nNow, we have the general solution:\n\n$y(x,t) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} A_m \\sin(\\frac{m\\pi}{10}x) \\cos(k_mt)$\n\nwhere $k_m = \\frac{mc\\pi}{10}$.\n\nThe initial position is given by:\n\n$y(x,0) = 10\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{5}x)$\n\nComparing this with the general solution, we can see that $A_1 = 10$ and all other coefficients $A_m$ are zero. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n$y(x,t) = 10\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{5}x)\\cos(\\frac{\\pi ct}{10})$"
