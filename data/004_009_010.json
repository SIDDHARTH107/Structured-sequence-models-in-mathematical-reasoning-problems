    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * cos(x) + 3x^3 * sin(x), we will use the product rule and the chain rule.\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. Mathematically, if we have functions u(x) and v(x), then the derivative of their product is:\n\n(uv)' = u'v + uv'\n\nNow, let's apply the product rule to our function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = (x^2 * cos(x) + 3x^3 * sin(x))'\n\nWe will treat x^2 * cos(x) as the first product and 3x^3 * sin(x) as the second product:\n\nf'(x) = (x^2 * cos(x))' + (3x^3 * sin(x))'\n\nFor the first product, let u1 = x^2 and v1 = cos(x):\n\n(u1v1)' = (x^2)' * cos(x) + x^2 * (cos(x))'\n\nThe derivative of x^2 is 2x, and the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x):\n\n(u1v1)' = 2x * cos(x) + x^2 * (-sin(x))\n\nFor the second product, let u2 = 3x^3 and v2 = sin(x):\n\n(u2v2)' = (3x^3)' * sin(x) + 3x^3 * (sin(x))'\n\nThe derivative of 3x^3 is 9x^2, and the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x):\n\n(u2v2)' = 9x^2 * sin(x) + 3x^3 * cos(x)\n\nNow, we can combine the derivatives of the two products:\n\nf'(x) = 2x * cos(x) - x^2 * sin(x) + 9x^2 * sin(x) + 3x^3 * cos(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at the point x = pi/4:\n\nf'(pi/4) = 2(pi/4) * cos(pi/4) - (pi/4)^2 * sin(pi/4) + 9(pi/4)^2 * sin(pi/4) + 3(pi/4)^3 * cos(pi/4)\n\nWe know that cos(pi/4) = sin(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2:\n\nf'(pi/4) = 2(pi/4) * (sqrt(2)/2) - (pi/4)^2 * (sqrt(2)/2) + 9(pi/4)^2 * (sqrt(2)/2) + 3(pi/4)^3 * (sqrt(2)/2)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nf'(pi/4) = (pi * sqrt(2))/2 - (pi^2 * sqrt(2))/8 + (9 * pi^2 * sqrt(2))/8 + (3 * pi^3 * sqrt(2))/32\n\nCombining the terms:\n\nf'(pi/4) = (pi * sqrt(2))/2 + (8 * pi^2 * sqrt(2))/8 + (3 * pi^3 * sqrt(2))/32\n\nf'(pi/4) = (pi * sqrt(2))/2 + pi^2 * sqrt(2) + (3 * pi^3 * sqrt(2))/32\n\nThis is the derivative of f(x) at the point x = pi/4."
