    "message_1": "A certain type of technology has a failure probability of 0.02 per hour. What is the probability that there will be at least one failure in a system that operates continuously for 100 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability of at least one failure is the probability of no failures occurring during the 100 hours of operation.\n\nThe probability of no failure in a single hour is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nFor 100 hours of continuous operation, the probability of no failures is (0.98)^100.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one failure by subtracting the probability of no failures from 1:\n\nProbability of at least one failure = 1 - (0.98)^100 â‰ˆ 0.867.\n\nSo, there is approximately an 86.7% chance that there will be at least one failure in a system that operates continuously for 100 hours."
