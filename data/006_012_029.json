    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one theft happening in a specific neighborhood within a month, we can use the complementary probability of no thefts happening in that month.\n\nLet's assume there are 30 days in a month. The probability of no theft happening on a single day is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nThe probability of no thefts happening for the entire month (30 days) is 0.9^30 ≈ 0.042.\n\nNow, we find the complementary probability, which is the probability of at least one theft happening within the month:\n\n1 - 0.042 ≈ 0.958.\n\nSo, the probability of a theft happening in the specific neighborhood within a month is approximately 0.958 or 95.8%."
