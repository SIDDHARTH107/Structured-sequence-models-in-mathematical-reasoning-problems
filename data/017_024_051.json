    "message_1": "What is the number of non-abelian groups of order 96 that are isomorphic to neither cyclic group C96 nor alternating group A4 × C4 × C2?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96 that are not isomorphic to C96 or A4 × C4 × C2, we first need to find the total number of groups of order 96 and then subtract the number of abelian groups and the specific non-abelian group A4 × C4 × C2.\n\nThe prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3. Using the formula for the number of groups of a given order (p^n * q^m), we have:\n\nNumber of groups of order 96 = (2^5 * 3) = 2^(5+1) * 3^(1+1) - 1 = 64 * 9 - 1 = 575\n\nNow we need to find the number of abelian groups of order 96. The number of abelian groups of order p^n * q^m is given by the product of the partition numbers of the exponents. The partitions of 5 are (5), (4,1), (3,2), (3,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,1,1,1), (1,1,1,1,1). So there are 7 partitions for 5, and there is only one partition for 3, which is (3). Therefore, there are 7 * 1 = 7 abelian groups of order 96.\n\nNow we need to subtract the number of abelian groups and the specific non-abelian group A4 × C4 × C2 from the total number of groups:\n\nNumber of non-abelian groups not isomorphic to C96 or A4 × C4 × C2 = 575 - 7 - 1 = 567\n\nSo there are 567 non-abelian groups of order 96 that are not isomorphic to C96 or A4 × C4 × C2."
