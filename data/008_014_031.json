    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nThe given system can be represented as:\n\nA = |  2  3 -1 |\n    |  3 -2  3 |\n    | -1  1  2 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 6 |\n    | 1 |\n    | 2 |\n\nNow, we need to perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a process where matrix A is decomposed into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process or any other QR decomposition algorithm, we find:\n\nQ = |  0.534522  0.617213 -0.57735 |\n    |  0.801784 -0.154303  0.57735 |\n    | -0.267261  0.771517  0.57735 |\n\nR = |  3.741657 -0.267261  2.84605  |\n    |  0        3.162278 -0.790569 |\n    |  0        0        1.732051  |\n\nNow, we have A = QR, so Ax = QRx = b. We can rewrite this as Q^TQRx = Q^Tb, and since Q^TQ = I (identity matrix), we get Rx = Q^Tb.\n\nLet's calculate Q^Tb:\n\nQ^T = |  0.534522  0.801784 -0.267261 |\n      |  0.617213 -0.154303  0.771517 |\n      | -0.57735   0.57735   0.57735  |\n\nQ^Tb = |  0.534522  0.801784 -0.267261 |   | 6 |\n       |  0.617213 -0.154303  0.771517 |   | 1 |\n       | -0.57735   0.57735   0.57735  |   | 2 |\n\nQ^Tb = | 4.934802 |\n       | 1.850324 |\n       | 1.732051 |\n\nNow, we have the system Rx = Q^Tb:\n\n|  3.741657 -0.267261  2.84605  | | x |   | 4.934802 |\n|  0        3.162278 -0.790569 | | y | = | 1.850324 |\n|  0        0        1.732051  | | z |   | 1.732051 |\n\nWe can solve this system using back-substitution:\n\nz = 1.732051 / 1.732051 = 1\n\ny = (1.850324 + 0.790569 * z) / 3.162278 = (1.850324 + 0.790569 * 1) / 3.162278 = 2\n\nx = (4.934802 + 0.267261 * y - 2.84605 * z) / 3.741657 = (4.934802 + 0.267261 * 2 - 2.84605 * 1) / 3.741657 = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 1."
