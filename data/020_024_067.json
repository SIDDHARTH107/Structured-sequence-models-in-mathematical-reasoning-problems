    "message_2": "To find the optimal price per unit that maximizes the company's revenue, we first need to find the revenue function. Revenue is given by the product of price (p) and quantity demanded (q). Using the demand function, we can express revenue (R) as a function of price:\n\nR(p) = p * q = p * (2000 - 100p)\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum of this revenue function. To do this, we can take the derivative of the revenue function with respect to price and set it equal to zero:\n\ndR(p)/dp = 2000 - 200p\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for p:\n\n0 = 2000 - 200p\n200p = 2000\np = 10\n\nSo, the optimal price per unit that maximizes the company's revenue is $10."
