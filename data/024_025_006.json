    "message_2": "To compute the second Chern class c2(X) of the line bundle X, we can use the Chern-Weil theory and the curvature form of the line bundle. However, since X is a line bundle, its second Chern class c2(X) is always zero.\n\nTo see this, recall that for a line bundle X, its total Chern class is given by:\n\nc(X) = 1 + c1(X)\n\nwhere c1(X) is the first Chern class of X.\n\nNow, the second Chern class c2(X) is the second coefficient in the expansion of the total Chern class:\n\nc(X) = 1 + c1(X) + c2(X) + ...\n\nSince X is a line bundle, its total Chern class is just:\n\nc(X) = 1 + c1(X)\n\nThis means that all higher Chern classes, including c2(X), are zero:\n\nc2(X) = 0"
