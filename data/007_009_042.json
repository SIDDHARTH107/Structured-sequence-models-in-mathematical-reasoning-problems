    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, denoted as φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. In other words, it counts the number of integers that have a greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1 with n.\n\nTo find the value of Euler's totient function for 42, we first need to find the prime factors of 42. The prime factorization of 42 is 2 × 3 × 7.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for Euler's totient function:\n\nφ(n) = n × (1 - 1/p1) × (1 - 1/p2) × ... × (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nIn the case of 42, we have:\n\nφ(42) = 42 × (1 - 1/2) × (1 - 1/3) × (1 - 1/7)\nφ(42) = 42 × (1/2) × (2/3) × (6/7)\nφ(42) = 42 × (1/3) × (6/7)\nφ(42) = 42 × (2/7)\nφ(42) = 12\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for 42 is 12."
