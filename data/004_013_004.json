    "message_2": "The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nIn this case, the radius r is 5 meters and the height h is 10 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = π(5^2)(10)\nV = π(25)(10)\nV = 250π\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible volume of the tank is 250π cubic meters."
