    "message_2": "To disconnect a connected undirected graph, we need to remove enough edges such that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we need to create at least two separate connected components.\n\nA connected graph with n vertices has a minimum of n-1 edges. Therefore, in order to create two connected components, we need to have at least (n1-1) + (n2-1) edges, where n1 and n2 are the number of vertices in the two components, and n1 + n2 = 10.\n\nTo minimize the number of edges that need to be removed, we want to maximize the number of edges in the two connected components. This can be achieved by splitting the vertices into two groups of equal or almost equal size. In this case, we can have one group with 5 vertices and another group with 5 vertices.\n\nFor the first group with 5 vertices, the minimum number of edges required to keep it connected is 5-1 = 4 edges. Similarly, for the second group with 5 vertices, the minimum number of edges required is 5-1 = 4 edges.\n\nSo, the minimum total number of edges required for the two connected components is 4 + 4 = 8 edges.\n\nSince the original graph has 15 edges, the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect it is 15 - 8 = 7 edges."
