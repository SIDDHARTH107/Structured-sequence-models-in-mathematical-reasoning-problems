    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^(10) - 2x^(5) + 3, we will apply the power rule. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nSo, for each term in the function, we will multiply the coefficient by the exponent and then decrease the exponent by 1.\n\nFor the first term, 5x^(10), the derivative is 10 * 5x^(10-1) = 50x^9.\n\nFor the second term, -2x^(5), the derivative is 5 * (-2)x^(5-1) = -10x^4.\n\nThe third term, 3, is a constant, and the derivative of a constant is 0.\n\nNow, we will combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 50x^9 - 10x^4 + 0 = 50x^9 - 10x^4."
