    "message_2": "To find the frequency components of the signal f(t) = 2sin(10πt) + 3cos(20πt) + 5sin(30πt), we can use the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier transform of f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1).\n\nSince f(t) is composed of three separate functions, we can find the Fourier transform of each function individually and then add them together.\n\n1. Fourier transform of 2sin(10πt):\n\nUsing the property that the Fourier transform of sin(at) is (j/2)[δ(ω-a) - δ(ω+a)], where δ is the Dirac delta function:\n\nFT[2sin(10πt)] = j[δ(ω-10π) - δ(ω+10π)]\n\n2. Fourier transform of 3cos(20πt):\n\nUsing the property that the Fourier transform of cos(at) is (1/2)[δ(ω-a) + δ(ω+a)]:\n\nFT[3cos(20πt)] = (3/2)[δ(ω-20π) + δ(ω+20π)]\n\n3. Fourier transform of 5sin(30πt):\n\nUsing the property that the Fourier transform of sin(at) is (j/2)[δ(ω-a) - δ(ω+a)]:\n\nFT[5sin(30πt)] = (5j/2)[δ(ω-30π) - δ(ω+30π)]\n\nNow, we can add the Fourier transforms of each function to find the total Fourier transform of f(t):\n\nF(ω) = j[δ(ω-10π) - δ(ω+10π)] + (3/2)[δ(ω-20π) + δ(ω+20π)] + (5j/2)[δ(ω-30π) - δ(ω+30π)]\n\nThis result shows the frequency components of the signal f(t) at ω = ±10π, ±20π, and ±30π."
