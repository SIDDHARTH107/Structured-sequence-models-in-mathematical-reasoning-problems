    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 7.5 cm. To find the circumference, plug the radius into the formula:\n\nC = 2π(7.5 cm)\nC ≈ 2(3.14159)(7.5 cm)\nC ≈ 47.12385 cm\n\nThe circumference of the circle is approximately 47.12 cm."
