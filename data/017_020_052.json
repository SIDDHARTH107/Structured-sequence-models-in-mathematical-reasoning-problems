    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 40 = 2^3 * 5\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups: For a group of order 40, there are two possible abelian groups, which are Z_40 and Z_8 x Z_5.\n3. Determine the number of possible non-abelian groups: To do this, we can use the formula for the number of groups of order p^a * q^b, where p and q are distinct primes, and a and b are positive integers. The formula is:\n\n   (p^(a-1) * (p-1)) * (q^(b-1) * (q-1))\n\n   In our case, p = 2, a = 3, q = 5, and b = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n   (2^(3-1) * (2-1)) * (5^(1-1) * (5-1)) = (4 * 1) * (1 * 4) = 16\n\n   However, this result includes the two abelian groups we already counted, so we need to subtract those to get the number of non-abelian groups:\n\n   16 - 2 = 14\n\nSo, there are 14 non-abelian groups of order 40.\n\nIn total, there are 2 abelian groups + 14 non-abelian groups = 16 non-isomorphic groups of order 40."
