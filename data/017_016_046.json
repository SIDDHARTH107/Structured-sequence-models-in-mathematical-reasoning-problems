    "message_2": "To show that H = <a> is normal in G, we need to show that for any g in G, gHg^(-1) = H.\n\nSince the order of G is 27, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G must divide 27 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibilities are 1 and 27. If there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, then it must be normal in G (by the Sylow theorems), and since H is a 3-Sylow subgroup, H is normal in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where there are 27 3-Sylow subgroups. In this case, each 3-Sylow subgroup has order 3, and since there are 27 of them, there are a total of 27 * 2 = 54 elements of order 3 in G. However, this is not possible, since |G| = 27, and there cannot be more elements of order 3 than the total number of elements in G. Therefore, there must be only one 3-Sylow subgroup, and H is normal in G.\n\nNow, we will show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or to the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\n\nIf G is abelian, then G is a finite abelian group of order 27, which is a power of a prime (3^3). By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C27, C9 x C3, or C3 x C3 x C3. Since H is a subgroup of order 3, G cannot be isomorphic to C9 x C3 or C3 x C3 x C3, as neither of these groups have an element of order 3 that generates a subgroup of order 3. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to C27.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian.\n\nIf G is non-abelian, then we know that there exists an element b in G such that b is not in H and bab^(-1) is not equal to a. Since H is normal in G, we have bab^(-1) = a^k for some k, where 1 < k < 3 (since a^0 = e and a^1 = a). The only possible value for k is 2, so bab^(-1) = a^2.\n\nNow, consider the element c = b^3. Since the order of a is 3, we have (bab^(-1))^3 = a^(2*3) = e. Thus, b^3ab^(-3) = e, which implies b^3a = ab^3. This means that a and b^3 commute. Since b^3 is in the center of G, G is a non-abelian group of order 27 with a normal subgroup H of order 3 and an element b such that bab^(-1) = a^2.\n\nThus, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or to the non-abelian group of order 27."
