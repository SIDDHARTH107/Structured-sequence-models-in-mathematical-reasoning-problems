Suppose $D$ is a unit disk with initial condition $u(x,y,0) = x^2-y^2$. Also, suppose the boundary of the disk $D$ is kept at a constant temperature of $0$. Find the solution $u(x,y,t)$ for $t>0$ using complex analysis techniques such as separation of variables and the method of Fourier series.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation in the given 2-dimensional region $D$, we first need to find the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplace operator in polar coordinates. In polar coordinates, the Laplace operator is given by:\n\n$\\nabla^2 u = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\theta^2}$.\n\nWe will use separation of variables, so we assume that the solution $u(r,\\theta,t)$ can be written as a product of functions of individual variables: $u(r,\\theta,t) = R(r)\\Theta(\\theta)T(t)$. Substituting this into the Laplace operator and dividing by $u(r,\\theta,t)$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{R}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{dR}{dr}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\Theta}\\frac{d^2\\Theta}{d\\theta^2} = 0$.\n\nNow, we separate the variables by setting:\n\n$\\frac{1}{R}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{dR}{dr}\\right) = -\\lambda$ and $\\frac{1}{\\Theta}\\frac{d^2\\Theta}{d\\theta^2} = \\lambda$.\n\nSolving the second equation, we get:\n\n$\\Theta''(\\theta) + \\lambda\\Theta(\\theta) = 0$.\n\nSince the temperature is periodic in $\\theta$, we have $\\Theta(\\theta) = \\Theta(\\theta + 2\\pi)$. The solutions to this equation are given by:\n\n$\\Theta(\\theta) = e^{im\\theta}$, where $m$ is an integer and $\\lambda = m^2$.\n\nNow, we solve the radial equation:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{dR}{dr}\\right) + \\lambda r R = 0$.\n\nThis is a Bessel's equation of order $m$. The solutions are given by Bessel functions of the first kind, $J_m(\\mu_{mn}r)$, where $\\mu_{mn}$ is the $n$-th positive root of the Bessel function $J_m$. The eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator are then given by:\n\n$u_{mn}(r,\\theta) = J_m(\\mu_{mn}r)e^{im\\theta}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients for the Fourier series expansion of the initial condition:\n\n$u(x,y,0) = x^2 - y^2 = (r\\cos\\theta)^2 - (r\\sin\\theta)^2 = r^2\\cos(2\\theta)$.\n\nWe can expand this function in terms of the eigenfunctions:\n\n$u(x,y,0) = \\sum_{m,n} a_{mn}u_{mn}(r,\\theta)$.\n\nSince the boundary of the disk is kept at a constant temperature of $0$, we only need to consider the terms with $m = 2$. Thus, we have:\n\n$u(x,y,0) = \\sum_{n} a_{2n}J_2(\\mu_{2n}r)e^{i2\\theta}$.\n\nTo find the coefficients $a_{2n}$, we use the orthogonality property of the Bessel functions:\n\n$a_{2n} = \\frac{\\int_0^1 \\int_0^{2\\pi} u(x,y,0) J_2(\\mu_{2n}r)e^{-i2\\theta} r dr d\\theta}{\\int_0^1 \\int_0^{2\\pi} |J_2(\\mu_{2n}r)|^2 r dr d\\theta}$.\n\nAfter calculating the coefficients $a_{2n}$, we can write the solution to the heat equation as:\n\n$u(x,y,t) = \\sum_{n} a_{2n}J_2(\\mu_{2n}r)e^{i2\\theta}e^{-\\alpha\\mu_{2n}^2t}$.\n\nThis is the solution to the heat equation in the 2-dimensional region $D$ for $t > 0$ using complex analysis techniques such as separation of variables and the method of Fourier series."
