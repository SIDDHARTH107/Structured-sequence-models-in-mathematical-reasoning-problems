    "message_1": "Suppose Alice and Bob want to establish a shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and they agree to use a prime number p = 17 and a base number g = 3. Alice chooses a secret number a = 7 and calculates g^a (mod p) while Bob chooses a secret number b = 11 and calculates g^b (mod p). What is the value of the shared secret key that they can use for secure communication?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the values that Alice and Bob will exchange:\n\nAlice calculates A = g^a (mod p) = 3^7 (mod 17)\nBob calculates B = g^b (mod p) = 3^11 (mod 17)\n\nUsing the modulo exponentiation property, we can calculate these values:\n\nA = 3^7 (mod 17) = 187 (mod 17) = 6\nB = 3^11 (mod 17) = 177147 (mod 17) = 12\n\nNow, Alice and Bob exchange these values (A and B) and calculate the shared secret key using their own secret numbers (a and b):\n\nAlice calculates the shared secret key: K_A = B^a (mod p) = 12^7 (mod 17)\nBob calculates the shared secret key: K_B = A^b (mod p) = 6^11 (mod 17)\n\nAgain, using the modulo exponentiation property, we can calculate these values:\n\nK_A = 12^7 (mod 17) = 35831808 (mod 17) = 10\nK_B = 6^11 (mod 17) = 362797056 (mod 17) = 10\n\nSince K_A = K_B, the shared secret key is 10. Alice and Bob can now use this shared secret key for secure communication."
