    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to get rid of the square root. We can do this by squaring both sides of the equation:\n\n$(\\sqrt{x+5})^2 = 7^2$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$x+5 = 49$\n\nNow, we just need to isolate x by subtracting 5 from both sides:\n\n$x = 49 - 5$\n\nSo, x equals:\n\n$x = 44$"
