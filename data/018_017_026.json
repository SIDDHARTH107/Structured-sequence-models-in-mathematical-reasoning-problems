The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3} - {2} = {1, 3}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian products (A △ B) × {1} and {1} × (A △ B):\n\n(A △ B) × {1} = {1, 3} × {1} = {(1, 1), (3, 1)}\n\n{1} × (A △ B) = {1} × {1, 3} = {(1, 1), (1, 3)}\n\nNow, let's show that the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to symmetric difference. To do this, we need to show that (A × B) △ (A × {1}) ≠ A × (B △ {1}). \n\nFirst, let's find A × B, A × {1}, and B △ {1}:\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nA × {1} = {(1, 1), (2, 1)}\n\nB △ {1} = {1, 2, 3} - {2} = {1, 3}\n\nNow let's find (A × B) △ (A × {1}) and A × (B △ {1}):\n\n(A × B) △ (A × {1}) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)} △ {(1, 1), (2, 1)} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nA × (B △ {1}) = {1, 2} × {1, 3} = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) △ (A × {1}) ≠ A × (B △ {1}).
