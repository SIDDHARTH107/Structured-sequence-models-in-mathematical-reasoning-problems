    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the curve, we need to find the points where both the partial derivatives with respect to x and y are zero, and the determinant of the Hessian matrix is also zero.\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 6y\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 6x\n\nNow, we need to find the points where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 - 6y = 0\n3y^2 - 6x = 0\n\nWe can simplify these equations:\n\nx^2 = 2y\ny^2 = 2x\n\nNow, let's solve these equations simultaneously. We can substitute x^2 from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n(2y)^2 = 2x\n4y^2 = 2x\nx = 2y^2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x back into the first equation:\n\n(2y^2)^2 = 2y\n4y^4 = 2y\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 2y (assuming y ≠ 0):\n\n2y^3 = 1\ny^3 = 1/2\ny = (1/2)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding x value:\n\nx = 2((1/2)^(1/3))^2\nx = 2(1/2)^(2/3)\nx = (1/2)^(1/3)\n\nSo, the point (x, y) = ((1/2)^(1/3), (1/2)^(1/3)) is a singular point of the curve.\n\nNow, let's check the case when y = 0:\n\n4y^4 = 2y\n0 = 0\n\nThis equation is true, so we need to find the corresponding x value when y = 0:\n\nx^2 = 2(0)\nx^2 = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo, the point (x, y) = (0, 0) is also a singular point of the curve.\n\nThus, the singular points of the curve are (0, 0) and ((1/2)^(1/3), (1/2)^(1/3))."
