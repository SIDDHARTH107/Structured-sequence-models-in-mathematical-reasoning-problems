    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element in G can be written as a power of g.\n\nSince the order of G is 11, which is a prime number, we can use Lagrange's theorem. Lagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup H of a finite group G divides the order of G. In our case, the order of G is 11, so the order of any subgroup H must divide 11. Since 11 is prime, the only divisors of 11 are 1 and 11 itself.\n\nNow, let's consider an element g in G, where g is not the identity element. The subgroup generated by g, denoted by <g>, consists of all the powers of g: {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^(n-1)}, where n is the order of g. Since g is not the identity element, the order of g (and thus the order of <g>) cannot be 1. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of <g> must divide 11, so the only possibility left is that the order of <g> is 11.\n\nIf the order of <g> is 11, then <g> contains 11 elements, which are all distinct since the powers of g are distinct. Since G has 11 elements as well, we can conclude that <g> = G. This means that every element in G can be written as a power of g, and therefore G is cyclic.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 11, then G is cyclic."
