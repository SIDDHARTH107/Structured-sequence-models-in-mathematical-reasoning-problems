    "message_2": "To determine if the given graph has a perfect matching, we need to know the specific edges connecting the vertices. However, we can discuss the general conditions for a perfect matching in a graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges.\n\nA perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all vertices such that each vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex in the matching. In other words, a perfect matching for a graph with 6 vertices would consist of 3 disjoint edges, each connecting a pair of vertices.\n\nFor a graph to have a perfect matching, it must satisfy the Tutte-Berge formula:\n\n`min(|X| + o(G - X) - |V(G)|, |V(G)| - |X|) <= |M| <= max(0, |V(G)| - 2|X|)`\n\nwhere `G` is the graph, `V(G)` is the set of vertices, `X` is a subset of vertices, `o(G - X)` is the number of odd components in the graph after removing the vertices in `X`, and `|M|` is the cardinality of the matching.\n\nSince we don't have the specific edges of the graph, we can't directly apply the Tutte-Berge formula. However, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In our case, with 9 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 18.\n\nFor a perfect matching to exist, each vertex must have an even degree. If any vertex has an odd degree, it would not be possible to form a perfect matching. Therefore, we need to ensure that all vertices have an even degree.\n\nIf the graph has a perfect matching, it would consist of 3 disjoint edges, and each vertex would have a degree of 2. However, since we don't have the specific edges, we cannot guarantee that a perfect matching exists or find one without more information."
