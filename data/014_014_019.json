    "message_2": "To encrypt the word \"CIPHER\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 matrix using the key and the remaining unused letters of the alphabet (omitting \"J\" since it is combined with \"I\" in the Playfair cipher).\n\n   M A T H S\n   B C D E F\n   G I K L N\n   O P Q R U\n   V W X Y Z\n\n2. Break the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an \"X\" between them and continue.\n\n   CI PH ER\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the following rules:\n\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrapping around to the beginning of the row if necessary).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrapping around to the top of the column if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\n4. Encrypt the digraphs:\n\n   CI -> DM\n   PH -> IU\n   ER -> FS\n\n5. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the encrypted message:\n\n   DM IU FS\n\nSo, the encrypted message for \"CIPHER\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\" is \"DMIUFS\"."
