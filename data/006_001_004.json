    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 4 heads and 3 tails in 7 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of flips (7 in this case)\n- k is the number of successful outcomes (4 heads)\n- p is the probability of a successful outcome (0.5 for heads)\n- q is the probability of a failure outcome (0.5 for tails)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 4) = (7C4) * (0.5^4) * (0.5^3)\n\nFirst, we calculate 7C4:\n\n7! / (4!(7-4)!) = 7! / (4!3!) = (7*6*5) / (4*3*2) = 35\n\nNow, we calculate the probabilities:\n\n(0.5^4) = 0.0625\n(0.5^3) = 0.125\n\nFinally, we put it all together:\n\nP(X = 4) = 35 * 0.0625 * 0.125 = 0.2734375\n\nSo, the probability of flipping the coin seven times and getting exactly four heads and three tails is approximately 0.2734 or 27.34%."
