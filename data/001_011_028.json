    "message_2": "To solve the given rational equation, we will follow the hint and cross multiply:\n\n(3x + 1) / (x - 2) = 5/2\n\nCross multiply:\n\n2(3x + 1) = 5(x - 2)\n\nNow, distribute the numbers on both sides:\n\n6x + 2 = 5x - 10\n\nNext, move all the terms to one side to get a quadratic equation:\n\n6x - 5x + 2 + 10 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nx + 12 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = -12\n\nSo, the solution for the given rational equation is x = -12."
