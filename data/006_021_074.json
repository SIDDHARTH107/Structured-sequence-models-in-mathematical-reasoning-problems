    "message_1": "A certain region has been experiencing heavy rainfall on 30% of the days in a year. What is the probability that it will rain on exactly 90 days in this particular year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in a year)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (also written as C(n, x) or \"n choose x\")\n- p is the probability of success (rainy day) on a single trial (30% or 0.3)\n- q is the probability of failure (non-rainy day) on a single trial (70% or 0.7)\n- n is the total number of trials (days in a year, which is 365)\n- x is the number of successes (rainy days, which is 90)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(90) = C(365, 90) * (0.3^90) * (0.7^(365-90))\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(365, 90), which is the number of ways to choose 90 rainy days out of 365 days:\n\nC(365, 90) = 365! / (90! * (365-90)!)\nC(365, 90) = 365! / (90! * 275!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(90) = C(365, 90) * (0.3^90) * (0.7^275)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values, we get:\n\nP(90) â‰ˆ 0.0694\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain on exactly 90 days in this particular year is approximately 6.94%."
