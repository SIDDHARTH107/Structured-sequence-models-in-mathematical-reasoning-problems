    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean. The formula for the standard error is:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, σ = 100 hours and n = 50 light bulbs. So, the standard error is:\n\nSE = 100 / √50 ≈ 14.14 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the sample mean (2450 and 2550 hours, respectively). The formula for the z-score is:\n\nz = (x - μ) / SE\n\nwhere x is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, and SE is the standard error.\n\nFor the lower bound (2450 hours):\n\nz_lower = (2450 - 2500) / 14.14 ≈ -3.53\n\nFor the upper bound (2550 hours):\n\nz_upper = (2550 - 2500) / 14.14 ≈ 3.53\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score falls between -3.53 and 3.53. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find the area under the curve between these two z-scores.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find:\n\nP(-3.53 < z < 3.53) ≈ 0.9994\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean lifespan of the light bulbs is between 2450 and 2550 hours is approximately 99.94%."
