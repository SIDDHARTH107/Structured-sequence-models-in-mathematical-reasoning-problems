    "message_1": "A company has determined that the probability of a flood occurring in a certain region during the next year is 0.15. If the company insures against the flood and the cost of the insurance is $5000, what should they charge as the insurance premium to make a profit of $1000?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the insurance premium as P. The company wants to make a profit of $1000. The expected payout for the company in case of a flood is 0.15 * $5000 = $750. To make a profit of $1000, the company needs to charge an insurance premium that covers both the expected payout and the desired profit.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\nP - $750 = $1000\n\nNow, we can solve for P:\n\nP = $1000 + $750\nP = $1750\n\nTherefore, the company should charge an insurance premium of $1750 to make a profit of $1000."
