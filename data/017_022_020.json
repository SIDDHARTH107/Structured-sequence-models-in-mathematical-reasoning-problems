    "message_1": "In how many ways can a group of order 60 be isomorphic to the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60 according to the given subtopic in group theory?",
    "message_2": "A group of order 60 can be isomorphic to the following groups:\n\n1. Cyclic group C60: There is only one cyclic group of order 60, which is generated by an element of order 60. So, there is only 1 way for a group of order 60 to be isomorphic to C60.\n\n2. Alternating group A5 × C2: The direct product of A5 and C2 has order 60. A5 is the alternating group of degree 5, which has order 5!/2 = 60, and C2 is the cyclic group of order 2. The direct product A5 × C2 is a non-abelian group of order 60. There is only 1 way for a group of order 60 to be isomorphic to A5 × C2.\n\n3. Non-abelian groups of order 60: According to the classification of finite simple groups, there are 5 isomorphism classes of non-abelian simple groups of order 60, which are the projective special linear groups PSL(2,4) and PSL(2,5), the Mathieu group M11, the Janko group J1, and the Higman-Sims group HS. However, these are not the only non-abelian groups of order 60. In total, there are 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, including the 5 simple groups mentioned above.\n\nSo, there are 1 (C60) + 1 (A5 × C2) + 32 (non-abelian groups) = 34 ways for a group of order 60 to be isomorphic to one of these groups."
