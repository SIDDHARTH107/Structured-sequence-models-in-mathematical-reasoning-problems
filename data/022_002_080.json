    "message_1": "Suppose that the complex function $f(z) = z^2 + iz + 1$ maps a unit circle centered at the origin in the $w$-plane to a region $R$ in the $z$-plane. Find the image of $-1$ under this mapping.",
    "message_2": "To find the image of $-1$ under the mapping $f(z) = z^2 + iz + 1$, we simply need to substitute $z = -1$ into the function:\n\n$f(-1) = (-1)^2 + i(-1) + 1 = 1 - i + 1 = 2 - i$\n\nSo the image of $-1$ under this mapping is $2 - i$."
