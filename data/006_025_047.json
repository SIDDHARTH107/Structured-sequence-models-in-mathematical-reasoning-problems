    "message_1": "A magician has 10 cards and one of them is a jack of hearts. The magician shuffles the cards and asks you to pick one card randomly. What is the probability that you select the jack of hearts?",
    "message_2": "There is 1 jack of hearts and a total of 10 cards. The probability of selecting the jack of hearts is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (selecting the jack of hearts) to the total number of possible outcomes (selecting any of the 10 cards).\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nProbability = 1 (jack of hearts) / 10 (total cards)\n\nProbability = 1/10 or 0.1\n\nSo, the probability of selecting the jack of hearts is 1/10 or 0.1, which can also be expressed as 10%."
