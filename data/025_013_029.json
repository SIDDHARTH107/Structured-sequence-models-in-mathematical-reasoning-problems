    "message_2": "To compute the genus of the curve C, we first need to determine its degree. The given equation is y^2 = x^3 - 3x + 1, which is a cubic curve (degree 3) in the projective plane. For a non-singular projective curve of degree d, the genus g can be calculated using the formula:\n\ng = (d-1)(d-2)/2\n\nIn our case, d = 3, so the genus is:\n\ng = (3-1)(3-2)/2 = (2)(1)/2 = 1\n\nThus, the genus of the curve C is 1.\n\nNow, let's find the Jacobian variety of the curve. The Jacobian variety of a curve C of genus g is an abelian variety of dimension g. In our case, since the genus is 1, the Jacobian variety is an abelian variety of dimension 1, which is an elliptic curve.\n\nThe curve C itself is already an elliptic curve, as it is a non-singular cubic curve in the projective plane. Therefore, the Jacobian variety of the curve C is the curve C itself, given by the equation:\n\ny^2 = x^3 - 3x + 1"
