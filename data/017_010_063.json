So, we only need to compare the given multiplication table with the tables for C10 and D5.\n\nThe cyclic group C10 has the following composition table:\n\n|  *  |  e  |  a  |  b  |  c  |  d  |  f  |  g  |  h  |  i  |  j  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  e  |  e  |  a  |  b  |  c  |  d  |  f  |  g  |  h  |  i  |  j  |\n|  a  |  a  |  b  |  c  |  d  |  e  |  f  |  g  |  h  |  i  |  j  |\n|  b  |  b  |  c  |  d  |  e  |  f  |  g  |  h  |  i  |  j  |  a  |\n|  c  |  c  |  d  |  e  |  f  |  g  |  h  |  i  |  j  |  a  |  b  |\n|  d  |  d  |  e  |  f  |  g  |  h  |  i  |  j  |  a  |  b  |  c  |\n|  f  |  f  |  g  |  h  |  i  |  j  |  a  |  b  |  c  |  d  |  e  |\n|  g  |  g  |  h  |  i  |  j  |  a  |  b  |  c  |  d  |  e  |  f  |\n|  h  |  h  |  i  |  j  |  a  |  b  |  c  |  d  |  e  |  f  |  g  |\n|  i  |  i  |  j  |  a  |  b  |  c  |  d  |  e  |  f  |  g  |  h  |\n|  j  |  j  |  a  |  b  |  c  |  d  |  e  |  f  |  g  |  h  |  i  |\n\nComparing the given table with the C10 table, we can see that they are not the same.

Therefore, the group G is not isomorphic to D5.\n\nSince the group G is not isomorphic to either C10 or D5, and there is no other non-abelian group of order 10, we can conclude that the given group G is not isomorphic to any of these groups."
