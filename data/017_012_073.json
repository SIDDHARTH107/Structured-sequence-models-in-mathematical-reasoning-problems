And if G does not contain an element of order 16 or 8 but contains an element of order 4, prove that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16.",
    "message_2": "Case 1: G contains an element of order 16.\nLet a be an element of order 16 in G. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by a, denoted by ⟨a⟩, has order 16. Since the order of ⟨a⟩ is equal to the order of G, we have G = ⟨a⟩. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 16, and it is isomorphic to C16.\n\nCase 2: G does not contain an element of order 16 but contains an element of order 8.\nLet b be an element of order 8 in G. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by b, denoted by ⟨b⟩, has order 8. Since G has order 16, there must be another element c in G that is not in ⟨b⟩. Let d = bc. We claim that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8.\n\nConsider the mapping φ: D8 → G, where φ(r) = b and φ(s) = d, where r and s are the standard generators of D8 (r has order 8 and s has order 2). We need to show that φ is a homomorphism and is bijective.\n\nFirst, we show that φ is a homomorphism. We have φ(rs) = φ(r)φ(s) = bd, and φ(sr) = φ(s)φ(r^7) = d(b^7) since s has order 2 and sr = r^7s in D8. Now, d(b^7) = (bc)(b^7) = b(cb^7) = b(b^7c) = b(b^6(bc)) = b(b^6d) = bd, so φ(sr) = φ(rs). Thus, φ is a homomorphism.\n\nNext, we show that φ is bijective. Since D8 has order 16 and G has order 16, it suffices to show that φ is injective. Suppose φ(x) = φ(y) for some x, y in D8. Then, x and y can be written as x = r^is^j and y = r^ks^l, where 0 ≤ i, k < 8 and j, l ∈ {0, 1}. We have b^id^j = b^kd^l. If j ≠ l, then one of d^j and d^l is equal to d, and the other is equal to the identity. But d is not in ⟨b⟩, so this is a contradiction. Thus, j = l. If j = 0, then b^i = b^k, so i = k. If j = 1, then b^id = b^kd, so b^i = b^k, and again i = k. Thus, x = y, and φ is injective.\n\nSince φ is a homomorphism and is bijective, G is isomorphic to D8.\n\nCase 3: G does not contain an element of order 16 or 8 but contains an element of order 4.\nLet e be an element of order 4 in G. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by e, denoted by ⟨e⟩, has order 4. Since G has order 16, there must be another element f in G that is not in ⟨e⟩. Let g = ef. We claim that G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nConsider the mapping ψ: Q → G, where Q is the quaternion group of order 16, and ψ(i) = e and ψ(j) = g, where i and j are the standard generators of Q (i has order 4, j has order 4, and (ij)^2 = i^2j^2). We need to show that ψ is a homomorphism and is bijective.\n\nFirst, we show that ψ is a homomorphism. We have ψ(i^2) = e^2, ψ(j^2) = g^2, and ψ(ij) = eg. Since e and g have order 4, we have e^4 = g^4 = 1. Also, (eg)^2 = e^2g^2, so ψ((ij)^2) = ψ(i^2j^2). Thus, ψ is a homomorphism.\n\nNext, we show that ψ is bijective. Since Q has order 16 and G has order 16, it suffices to show that ψ is injective. Suppose ψ(x) = ψ(y) for some x, y in Q. Then, x and y can be written as x = i^aj^b and y = i^cj^d, where 0 ≤ a, c < 4 and 0 ≤ b, d < 4. We have e^ag^b = e^cg^d. If b ≠ d, then one of g^b and g^d is equal to g, and the other is equal to the identity. But g is not in ⟨e⟩, so this is a contradiction. Thus, b = d. If b = 0, then e^a = e^c, so a = c. If b ≠ 0, then e^ag = e^cg, so e^a = e^c, and again a = c. Thus, x = y, and ψ is injective.\n\nSince ψ is a homomorphism and is bijective, G is isomorphic to Q, which is a non-abelian group of order 16."
