    "message_2": "To find the smallest number of people you need to invite to a party so that there are either three mutual friends or three mutual strangers, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle and Ramsey Theory. The number we are looking for is called the Ramsey number R(3,3).\n\nConsider a group of 6 people. When a new person joins the group, they can either be a friend or a stranger to each of the existing members. If the new person has at least 3 friends or 3 strangers among the existing members, we have our condition satisfied. So, let's assume the new person has exactly 2 friends and 3 strangers in the group.\n\nNow, consider the two friends of the new person. If these two friends are friends with each other, then we have a group of three mutual friends (the new person and their two friends). If these two friends are strangers to each other, then we have a group of three mutual strangers (the two friends and the new person).\n\nThus, in either case, we have a group of three mutual friends or three mutual strangers. Therefore, the smallest number of people you need to invite to a party to guarantee this condition is 6."
