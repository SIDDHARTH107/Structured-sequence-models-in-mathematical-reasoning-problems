However, I will provide the Fourier coefficients for this function assuming it is periodic with period 2L.\n\nFor a periodic function with period 2L, the Fourier series representation is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere the Fourier coefficients are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) dx\n\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx\n\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nFor f(x) = e^(-x), we have:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] e^(-x) dx\n\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] e^(-x) * cos(nπx/L) dx\n\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] e^(-x) * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nTo find the Fourier coefficients, we need to compute these integrals. However, since f(x) is not an even function and not periodic on the given interval, the Fourier series representation and coefficients may not accurately represent the function."
