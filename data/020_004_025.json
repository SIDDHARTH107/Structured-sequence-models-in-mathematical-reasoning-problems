    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, product A and product B. Each unit of product A requires 3 hours of labor and 4 hours of machine time, while each unit of product B requires 4 hours of labor and 5 hours of machine time. The company has 180 hours of labor and 240 hours of machine time available per week. The profit per unit of product A is $10, and the profit per unit of product B is $15. Determine the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce in order to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time can be written as:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 180 (labor constraint)\n4x + 5y ≤ 240 (machine constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 180\ny ≤ (180 - 3x) / 4\n\n4x + 5y ≤ 240\ny ≤ (240 - 4x) / 5\n\nThe feasible region is determined by the intersection of these inequalities, which is a polygon with vertices at (0,0), (0,45), (60,0), and (30,30).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0,45) = 10(0) + 15(45) = $675\n3. P(60,0) = 10(60) + 15(0) = $600\n4. P(30,30) = 10(30) + 15(30) = $750\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (30,30), which means the company should produce 30 units of product A and 30 units of product B to maximize their profit at $750 per week."
