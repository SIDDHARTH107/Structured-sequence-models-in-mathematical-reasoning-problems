    "message_2": "A 128-bit block cipher has an encryption key that is 128 bits long. Each bit can be either a 0 or a 1, so there are 2 possible values for each bit. To find the total number of possible encryption keys, you need to calculate the number of combinations for all 128 bits. This can be done using the formula:\n\n2^n, where n is the number of bits.\n\nSo, for a 128-bit block cipher, there are 2^128 possible encryption keys."
