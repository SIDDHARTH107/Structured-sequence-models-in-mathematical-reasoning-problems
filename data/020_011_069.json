    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. The production of Product A requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time, while the production of Product B requires 1 hour of labor and 3 hours of machine time. The production capacity for labor is 60 hours and for machine time is 80 hours per week. The profit per unit of Product A is $100 and for Product B is $150. Find the optimal production schedule to maximize the total profit of the company.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced and y be the number of units of Product B produced.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are as follows:\n\nLabor: 2x + y ≤ 60\nMachine time: x + 3y ≤ 80\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total profit is:\n\nProfit = 100x + 150y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 60\ny ≤ -2x + 60\n\n2. x + 3y ≤ 80\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 80/3\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. Now we need to find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of the two lines:\n2x + y = 60\nx + 3y = 80\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nx = 20\ny = 20\n\n2. Intersection of the line 2x + y = 60 with the x-axis (y = 0):\n2x = 60\nx = 30\n\n3. Intersection of the line x + 3y = 80 with the y-axis (x = 0):\n3y = 80\ny = 80/3 ≈ 26.67\n\nNow we need to evaluate the objective function at each of these corner points:\n\n1. (20, 20):\nProfit = 100(20) + 150(20) = 2000 + 3000 = 5000\n\n2. (30, 0):\nProfit = 100(30) + 150(0) = 3000\n\n3. (0, 26.67):\nProfit = 100(0) + 150(26.67) ≈ 4000\n\nThe maximum profit is $5000, which occurs when the company produces 20 units of Product A and 20 units of Product B."
