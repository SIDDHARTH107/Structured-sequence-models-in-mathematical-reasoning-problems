    "message_1": "A research institute found that an average of 5 patients move from hospital A to hospital B per day. If this trend has been observed for the past 6 months, what is the probability that exactly 3 patients will move from hospital A to hospital B tomorrow? Assume that the number of patients moving from hospital A to hospital B each day follows a Markov chain.",
    "message_2": "If the number of patients moving from hospital A to hospital B each day follows a Markov chain, then the process is memoryless, and the probability of a certain number of patients moving tomorrow is independent of the past observations. However, the given information is not sufficient to determine the transition probabilities of the Markov chain. \n\nInstead, we can assume that the number of patients moving each day follows a Poisson distribution, which is a common assumption for modeling the number of events (in this case, patients moving) in a fixed interval of time. The Poisson distribution has a single parameter, 位, which represents the average number of events in the given time interval.\n\nGiven that an average of 5 patients move from hospital A to hospital B per day, we have 位 = 5. The probability mass function of a Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-位) * 位^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of patients moving, k is the specific number of patients we are interested in (in this case, 3), e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 3) = (e^(-5) * 5^3) / 3!\nP(X = 3) = (0.0067 * 125) / 6\nP(X = 3) = 0.1404\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 3 patients will move from hospital A to hospital B tomorrow is approximately 14.04%."
