    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to write the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = |  2  1  1 |\n    |  3  1  2 |\n    | 16  5  1 |\n\nb = |  6  |\n    |  11 |\n    |  19 |\n\nNow, we need to find the Cholesky decomposition of A, which is a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T such that A = LL^T.\n\nL = |  l11  0    0  |\n    |  l21  l22  0  |\n    |  l31  l32  l33|\n\nL^T = |  l11  l21  l31 |\n      |  0    l22  l32 |\n      |  0    0    l33 |\n\nUsing the Cholesky decomposition method, we can find the values of l11, l21, l22, l31, l32, and l33.\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(2) = 1.4142\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 3 / 1.4142 = 2.1213\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(1 - 2.1213^2) = 1.4142\nl31 = a31 / l11 = 16 / 1.4142 = 11.3137\nl32 = (a32 - l21 * l31) / l22 = (5 - 2.1213 * 11.3137) / 1.4142 = -2.1213\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(1 - 11.3137^2 - (-2.1213)^2) = 1.4142\n\nNow, we have the lower triangular matrix L:\n\nL = |  1.4142  0       0      |\n    |  2.1213  1.4142  0      |\n    | 11.3137 -2.1213  1.4142 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n1.4142 * y1 = 6\ny1 = 6 / 1.4142 = 4.2426\n\n2.1213 * y2 + 1.4142 * y3 = 11\ny2 = (11 - 1.4142 * y3) / 2.1213\n\n11.3137 * y1 - 2.1213 * y2 + 1.4142 * y3 = 19\ny3 = (19 - 11.3137 * 4.2426 + 2.1213 * y2) / 1.4142 = -1.4142\n\nNow, we can substitute y3 back into the equation for y2:\n\ny2 = (11 - 1.4142 * (-1.4142)) / 2.1213 = 2.1213\n\nNow, we have the column vector y:\n\ny = |  4.2426 |\n    |  2.1213 |\n    | -1.4142 |\n\nFinally, we need to solve the system L^T * x = y for x:\n\n1.4142 * x1 + 2.1213 * x2 + 11.3137 * x3 = 4.2426\nx1 = (4.2426 - 2.1213 * x2 - 11.3137 * x3) / 1.4142\n\n1.4142 * x2 - 2.1213 * x3 = 2.1213\nx2 = (2.1213 + 2.1213 * x3) / 1.4142 = 1\n\n1.4142 * x3 = -1.4142\nx3 = -1\n\nNow, we have the column vector x:\n\nx = |  1 |\n    |  1 |\n    | -1 |\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 1, and z = -1."
