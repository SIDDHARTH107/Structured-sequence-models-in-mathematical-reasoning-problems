    "message_2": "Twin primes are pairs of primes that differ by 2. Let's denote the smaller prime in the pair as p, and the larger prime as p+2. We are looking for the smallest pair of twin primes such that p + (p+2) = 100.\n\n2p + 2 = 100\n2p = 98\np = 49\n\nHowever, 49 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 7. So, we need to look for the next smallest pair of twin primes.\n\nLet's try the next smallest odd number, p = 47. In this case, p+2 = 49, which is not prime. Moving on to the next odd number, p = 45, but it is not prime either since it is divisible by 3 and 5.\n\nNow, let's try p = 43. In this case, p+2 = 45, which is not prime. Continuing with the next odd number, p = 41, we find that p+2 = 43, which is prime.\n\nSo, the smallest pair of twin primes that add up to 100 are 41 and 43."
