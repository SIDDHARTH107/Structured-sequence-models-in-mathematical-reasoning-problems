    "message_1": "Suppose that we have a compact, orientable Riemannian manifold $M$ of dimension $n$ with a smooth, closed $2$-form $\\omega$ such that the integral of $\\omega$ over $M$ is non-zero. Let $\\alpha$ be a smooth $1$-form on $M$ such that $d\\alpha = \\omega.$ Prove that $\\alpha$ has at least one zero. How many zeros can $\\alpha$ have, at most?",
    "message_2": "To prove that $\\alpha$ has at least one zero, we will use the Poincaré-Hopf theorem.\n\nFirst, note that since $d\\alpha = \\omega$, the 2-form $\\omega$ is exact. Now, let $Z(\\alpha)$ be the set of zeros of $\\alpha$. We want to show that $Z(\\alpha)$ is non-empty. Suppose, for contradiction, that $Z(\\alpha) = \\emptyset$. Then $\\alpha$ is nowhere vanishing, and we can define a unit vector field $X$ on $M$ by $X = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\|\\alpha\\|}$. \n\nNow, consider the Euler characteristic of $M$, denoted by $\\chi(M)$. By the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, we have\n\n$$\\chi(M) = \\sum_{p \\in Z(X)} \\text{index}_p(X).$$\n\nSince $Z(X) = Z(\\alpha) = \\emptyset$, the sum is empty and thus $\\chi(M) = 0$. However, this contradicts the fact that $M$ is compact and orientable, which implies that $\\chi(M) \\neq 0$. Therefore, our assumption that $Z(\\alpha) = \\emptyset$ must be false, and $\\alpha$ has at least one zero.\n\nNow, let's find an upper bound for the number of zeros of $\\alpha$. Since $d\\alpha = \\omega$, we have that $\\omega$ is exact, and thus its cohomology class $[\\omega] = 0$ in $H^2(M)$. However, we are given that the integral of $\\omega$ over $M$ is non-zero, which means that $\\omega$ is not homotopic to the zero map. This implies that the second Betti number $b_2(M) > 0$.\n\nBy the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, we have\n\n$$\\chi(M) = \\sum_{p \\in Z(\\alpha)} \\text{index}_p(\\alpha).$$\n\nSince $\\chi(M) \\neq 0$, there must be at least one non-zero term in the sum. Moreover, the index of a non-degenerate zero of a 1-form is either $+1$ or $-1$. Therefore, the number of zeros of $\\alpha$ is at least $|\\chi(M)|$.\n\nNow, let $N$ be the number of zeros of $\\alpha$. Since each zero contributes either $+1$ or $-1$ to the sum, we have\n\n$$|\\chi(M)| \\leq N \\leq |\\chi(M)| + 2b_2(M),$$\n\nwhere the lower bound comes from the fact that there must be at least $|\\chi(M)|$ zeros, and the upper bound comes from the fact that we can add at most $2b_2(M)$ zeros without changing the sum (by adding pairs of zeros with indices $+1$ and $-1$).\n\nIn conclusion, $\\alpha$ has at least one zero, and the number of zeros of $\\alpha$ is bounded by $|\\chi(M)| + 2b_2(M)$."
