    "message_2": "To find a conformal map that transforms the unit disk $D(0,1)$ onto the upper half plane $\\mathbb{H}$, we can use the Möbius transformation. The Möbius transformation is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $ad - bc \\neq 0$. \n\nWe want to map the unit disk $D(0,1)$ onto the upper half plane $\\mathbb{H}$. We can choose $a = 1, b = 0, c = -1, d = 1$ to get the transformation:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z}{1 - z}$$\n\nNow, we have mapped the unit disk onto the upper half plane. Next, we need to map the upper half plane onto the domain bounded by the real axis and the curve $y = |x|^{\\frac{3}{2}}$. To do this, we can use the transformation:\n\n$$g(w) = w^{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n\nThis transformation will map the upper half plane onto the desired domain. Now, we can find the conformal map that transforms the unit disk onto the desired domain by composing the two transformations:\n\n$$h(z) = g(f(z)) = \\left(\\frac{z}{1 - z}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n\nSo, the conformal map that transforms the unit disk $D(0,1)$ onto the domain bounded by the real axis and the curve $y = |x|^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ in the complex plane is:\n\n$$h(z) = \\left(\\frac{z}{1 - z}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}}$$"
