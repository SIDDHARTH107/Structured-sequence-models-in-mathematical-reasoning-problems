    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P, we first need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.\n\nThe characteristic equation of matrix A is given by the determinant of (A - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix:\n\n|A - λI| = | 1-λ  2    0  |\n                  |  2    -λ  2  |\n                  |  3    2  1-λ |\n\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n\n(1-λ)((-λ)(1-λ) - 4) - 2(2(1-λ) - 6) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get the characteristic polynomial:\n\nλ^3 - 2λ^2 - 5λ + 6 = 0\n\nFactoring the polynomial, we find the eigenvalues:\n\n(λ - 1)(λ - 2)(λ + 3) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 1, λ2 = 2, and λ3 = -3.\n\nNow, we find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue:\n\nFor λ1 = 1:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n\n| 0  2  0 | |x1|   |0|\n| 2 -1  2 | |x2| = |0|\n| 3  2  0 | |x3|   |0|\n\nSolving the system of linear equations, we get the eigenvector v1 = (2, 2, 3).\n\nFor λ2 = 2:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n\n| -1  2  0 | |x1|   |0|\n|  2 -2  2 | |x2| = |0|\n|  3  2 -1 | |x3|   |0|\n\nSolving the system of linear equations, we get the eigenvector v2 = (2, 1, 2).\n\nFor λ3 = -3:\n\n(A - λ3I)v3 = 0\n\n|  4  2  0 | |x1|   |0|\n|  2  3  2 | |x2| = |0|\n|  3  2  4 | |x3|   |0|\n\nSolving the system of linear equations, we get the eigenvector v3 = (1, -1, 1).\n\nNow, we can construct the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P:\n\nD = | 1  0  0 |\n       | 0  2  0 |\n       | 0  0 -3 |\n\nP = | 2  2  1 |\n       | 2  1 -1 |\n       | 3  2  1 |\n\nTo verify that A = PDP^(-1), we can compute the inverse of P:\n\nP^(-1) = 1/(-2) | -1  1  1 |\n                        |  3  1 -1 |\n                        | -4 -2  2 |\n\nNow, compute the product PDP^(-1):\n\nPDP^(-1) = | 2  2  1 | | 1  0  0 | | -1/2  1/2  1/2 |\n                  | 2  1 -1 | | 0  2  0 | |  3/2  1/2 -1/2 |\n                  | 3  2  1 | | 0  0 -3 | | -2   -1    1   |\n\nAfter the matrix multiplication, we get:\n\nPDP^(-1) = | 1  2  0 |\n                  | 2  0  2 |\n                  | 3  2  1 |\n\nThis is equal to matrix A, so we have found the correct diagonal matrix D and invertible matrix P such that A = PDP^(-1)."
