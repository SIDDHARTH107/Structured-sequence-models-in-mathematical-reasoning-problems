The company wants to produce 500 units of product A, 700 units of product B, and 900 units of product C. To minimize the cost of production, what is the optimal production plan? \n\nThe table below shows the production costs of each product at each factory:\n\n| Product | Factory 1 | Factory 2 |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| A       | 10        | 14        |\n| B       | 12        | 8         |\n| C       | 16        | 18        |\n\nAssume that the total production capacity of Factory 1 is 1000 units, and that of Factory 2 is 1200 units. Also, assume that the production of each product can only be done at one factory.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of production, we should produce each product at the factory with the lowest cost for that product. \n\nFor product A, Factory 1 has a lower cost (10) than Factory 2 (14). So, we should produce all 500 units of product A at Factory 1.\n\nFor product B, Factory 2 has a lower cost (8) than Factory 1 (12). So, we should produce all 700 units of product B at Factory 2.\n\nFor product C, Factory 1 has a lower cost (16) than Factory 2 (18). So, we should produce all 900 units of product C at Factory 1.\n\nNow, let's check if the production capacities of the factories are not exceeded:\n\nFactory 1: 500 units of product A + 900 units of product C = 1400 units (exceeds the capacity of 1000 units)\n\nFactory 2: 700 units of product B = 700 units (within the capacity of 1200 units)\n\nSince the production capacity of Factory 1 is exceeded, we need to adjust the production plan. We can move some of the production of product C to Factory 2. Factory 1 can produce 1000 - 500 = 500 units of product C, and Factory 2 can produce the remaining 900 - 500 = 400 units of product C.\n\nSo, the optimal production plan is:\n\n- Factory 1: 500 units of product A and 500 units of product C\n- Factory 2: 700 units of product B and 400 units of product C"
