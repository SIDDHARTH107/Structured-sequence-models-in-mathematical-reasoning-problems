    "message_2": "Let the length of the garden be x and the width be y. Since there are three sides to the garden, we can write the equation for the perimeter as:\n\nx + 2y = 100\n\nWe want to maximize the area of the garden, which is given by the equation:\n\nArea = x * y\n\nFirst, we need to express y in terms of x using the perimeter equation:\n\ny = (100 - x) / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the area equation:\n\nArea = x * ((100 - x) / 2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nArea = (100x - x^2) / 2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area equation with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Area)/dx = (100 - 2x) / 2 = 0\n\nSolve for x:\n\n100 - 2x = 0\n2x = 100\nx = 50\n\nNow, substitute the value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (100 - 50) / 2\ny = 50 / 2\ny = 25\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden with the maximum possible area are 50 feet by 25 feet."
