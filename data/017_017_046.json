    "message_2": "To find all possible Cayley tables for groups of order 30, we first need to consider the possible structures of these groups. A group of order 30 has a prime factorization of 2 * 3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, there are three possible structures for groups of order 30:\n\n1. C30: The cyclic group of order 30.\n2. D15: The dihedral group of order 30 (2 * 15).\n3. A non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nNow, let's determine the Cayley tables for each of these groups and check for isomorphisms.\n\n1. C30: The cyclic group of order 30 has elements {0, 1, 2, ..., 29}, with the operation being addition modulo 30. The Cayley table for this group is a 30x30 table where the entry in row i and column j is (i + j) mod 30. This group is abelian, and it is isomorphic to itself.\n\n2. D15: The dihedral group of order 30 has elements {r^i * s^j | 0 <= i < 15, 0 <= j < 2}, where r is a rotation and s is a reflection. The operation in this group is composition of symmetries. The Cayley table for this group is a 30x30 table where the entry in row i and column j is the result of composing the symmetries corresponding to i and j. This group is non-abelian, and it is isomorphic to itself.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 30: There is only one non-abelian group of order 30, up to isomorphism. This group can be represented as a semidirect product of C5 and C6, where C5 is the cyclic group of order 5 and C6 is the cyclic group of order 6. The Cayley table for this group is a 30x30 table where the entry in row i and column j is the result of the semidirect product operation. This group is non-abelian, and it is isomorphic to itself.\n\nIn conclusion, there are three possible Cayley tables for groups of order 30, corresponding to the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, and the non-abelian group of order 30. Each of these groups is isomorphic to itself, and they are not isomorphic to each other."
