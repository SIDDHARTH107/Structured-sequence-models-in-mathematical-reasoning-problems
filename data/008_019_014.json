    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution, elimination, or matrices. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by -2 and add it to the second equation, and multiply the first equation by -1 and add it to the third equation.\n\n-2*(x + 3y - 2z) = -2*5\n-2x - 6y + 4z = -10\n\nNow, add this to the second equation:\n(2x - 5y + 6z) + (-2x - 6y + 4z) = -1 + (-10)\n-11y + 10z = -11\n\n-1*(x + 3y - 2z) = -1*5\n-x - 3y + 2z = -5\n\nNow, add this to the third equation:\n(x + 2y + 3z) + (-x - 3y + 2z) = 7/2 + (-5)\n-y + 5z = -1/2\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n-11y + 10z = -11\n-y + 5z = -1/2\n\nWe can eliminate y by multiplying the second equation by 11 and adding it to the first equation:\n\n11*(-y + 5z) = 11*(-1/2)\n-11y + 55z = -11/2\n\nNow, add this to the first equation:\n(-11y + 10z) + (-11y + 55z) = -11 + (-11/2)\n-22y + 65z = -33/2\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n65z = 33/2 + 22y\nz = (33/2 + 22y) / 65\n\nNow, substitute this expression for z back into the second equation:\n-y + 5((33/2 + 22y) / 65) = -1/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 65 to eliminate the fraction:\n-65y + 5(33/2 + 22y) = -65/2\n\nDistribute the 5:\n-65y + 165/2 + 110y = -65/2\n\nCombine like terms:\n45y = -165/2 + 65/2\n45y = -100/2\ny = -100/90\ny = -10/9\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the expression for z:\nz = (33/2 + 22(-10/9)) / 65\n\nMultiply both sides by 18 to eliminate the fractions:\n18z = 9(33/2) - 20(22)\n18z = 297 - 440\n18z = -143\nz = -143/18\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z back into the first equation to find x:\nx + 3(-10/9) - 2(-143/18) = 5\n\nMultiply both sides by 18 to eliminate the fractions:\n18x - 60 + 286 = 90\n18x = 90 - 286 + 60\n18x = -136\nx = -136/18\nx = -17/2\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\nx = -17/2\ny = -10/9\nz = -143/18"
