    "message_2": "The probability of it not raining on any given day in that city is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n\nTo find the probability of it not raining on the next three consecutive days, we multiply the individual probabilities together:\n\n0.7 (day 1) * 0.7 (day 2) * 0.7 (day 3) = 0.7^3 = 0.343.\n\nSo, the probability of it not raining on the next three consecutive days in that city is 0.343 or 34.3%."
