    "message_2": "A degree sequence is a list of the degrees of the vertices in a graph, usually written in non-increasing order. Since the graph is simple, there are no loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n\nOne possible degree sequence for a simple graph with 8 vertices is (7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0). This sequence represents a graph where one vertex is connected to all other vertices (degree 7), another vertex is connected to 6 other vertices, and so on, until the last vertex has no connections (degree 0)."
