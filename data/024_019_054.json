    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a compact surface S with a Riemannian metric, the total curvature K integrated over the surface is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic χ(S):\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ(S)\n\nThe Euler characteristic χ(S) can be related to the total angular defect Δ by the formula:\n\nΔ = 2π(2 - χ(S))\n\nGiven that the total angular defect Δ is 3π, we can solve for the Euler characteristic:\n\n3π = 2π(2 - χ(S))\nχ(S) = 1\n\nNow, we are given that the surface S has a constant positive curvature of 2. Therefore, K = 2 everywhere on the surface. We can now use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to find the area of S:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ(S)\n∫∫_S 2 dA = 2π(1)\n\nLet A be the area of S. Then,\n\n2A = 2π\nA = π\n\nSo, the area of the surface S is π."
