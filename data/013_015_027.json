    "message_1": "A company hires an agent to perform a task on their behalf. The agent's effort level affects the probability of success of the task. The company values success at $500,000 and offers the agent two different incentive schemes:\n\nScheme 1: The agent is paid a salary of $100,000 regardless of the outcome of the task.\nScheme 2: The agent is paid a bonus of $400,000 if the task is successful, but receives nothing if it is not.\n\nAssuming that the agent's effort level is denoted by \"e\" and is a number between 0 and 1, and that the probability of success of the task is given by 2e, what effort level should the agent choose to maximize their expected payoff under each incentive scheme?",
    "message_2": "To find the effort level that maximizes the agent's expected payoff under each incentive scheme, we need to calculate the expected payoff for each scheme and then compare them.\n\nScheme 1: The agent is paid a salary of $100,000 regardless of the outcome of the task.\n\nIn this case, the agent's expected payoff does not depend on the effort level, as they will receive $100,000 no matter what. Therefore, the agent will choose the lowest possible effort level, e = 0, to maximize their expected payoff under Scheme 1.\n\nScheme 2: The agent is paid a bonus of $400,000 if the task is successful, but receives nothing if it is not.\n\nIn this case, the agent's expected payoff depends on the probability of success, which is given by 2e. The expected payoff under Scheme 2 can be calculated as follows:\n\nExpected Payoff = (Probability of Success) * (Bonus) = (2e) * ($400,000)\n\nTo maximize the expected payoff, we need to find the effort level that maximizes the above equation. Since the equation is linear with respect to e, the agent should choose the highest possible effort level, e = 1, to maximize their expected payoff under Scheme 2.\n\nIn conclusion, the agent should choose an effort level of e = 0 under Scheme 1 and an effort level of e = 1 under Scheme 2 to maximize their expected payoff."
