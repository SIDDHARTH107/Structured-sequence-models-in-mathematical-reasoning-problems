    "message_2": "The given function is y(x) = 0.1 sin(πx/L). This is a sinusoidal function, which represents a wave. The general form of a sinusoidal function is y(x) = A sin(Bx + C), where A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our case, A = 0.1 and B = π/L. We can use the relationship between angular frequency (B) and wavelength (λ) to find the wavelength:\n\nB = 2π/λ\n\nNow, we can set B = π/L and solve for λ:\n\nπ/L = 2π/λ\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\nλ = 2L\n\nNow, we can find the frequency (f) of the wave using the wave speed (v) formula:\n\nv = fλ\n\nWe are given the wave speed (v) as 50 m/s. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n50 = f(2L)\n\nSince we don't have the value of L, we cannot find the exact value of the frequency. However, we can express the frequency in terms of L:\n\nf = 25/L\n\nSo, the wavelength of the wave is λ = 2L, and the frequency is f = 25/L."
