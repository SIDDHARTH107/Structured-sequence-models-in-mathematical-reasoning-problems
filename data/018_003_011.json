    "message_2": "To show that the union of sets A and B is a superset of both sets A and B, we first need to find the union of sets A and B. The union of two sets is the set containing all elements from both sets, without any duplicates.\n\nA ∪ B = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nNow, we need to show that A ∪ B is a superset of both A and B. A set C is a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of A:\n\n- 3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 5 ∈ A and 5 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 7 ∈ A and 7 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 9 ∈ A and 9 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of A are also elements of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of B:\n\n- 2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n- 8 ∈ B and 8 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of B are also elements of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B) is a superset of both sets A and B."
