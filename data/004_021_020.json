    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 12x + 8, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x), which will be the second derivative, f''(x).\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 12x + 8)\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 24x^2 + 12x - 12\n\nNow, we find the second derivative:\nf''(x) = d/dx(12x^3 - 24x^2 + 12x - 12)\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x + 12\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) is f''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x + 12."
