    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x + 2, we will integrate each term separately with respect to x.\n\nThe antiderivative of x^n with respect to x is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), where n is a constant.\n\nSo, for the first term, 3x^2, the antiderivative is (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = 3x^3/3 = x^3.\n\nFor the second term, 4x, the antiderivative is (4x^(1+1))/(1+1) = 4x^2/2 = 2x^2.\n\nFor the third term, 2, the antiderivative is 2x^(0+1)/(0+1) = 2x.\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add a constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + C"
