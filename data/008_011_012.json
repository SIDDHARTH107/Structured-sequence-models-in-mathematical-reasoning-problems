    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinants. Let's denote the coefficients matrix as A:\n\nA = | 2  1 |\n    | 1 -3 |\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of A (denoted as |A|):\n\n|A| = (2 * -3) - (1 * 1) = -6 - 1 = -7\n\nNow, we need to find the determinants for the matrices with the columns replaced by the constants (5 and -2). Let's denote these matrices as Ax and Ay:\n\nAx = | 5  1 |\n     | -2 -3 |\n\nAy = | 2  5 |\n     | 1 -2 |\n\nNow, let's find the determinants of Ax and Ay (denoted as |Ax| and |Ay|):\n\n|Ax| = (5 * -3) - (1 * -2) = -15 + 2 = -13\n\n|Ay| = (2 * -2) - (1 * 5) = -4 - 5 = -9\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y using Cramer's rule:\n\nx = |Ax| / |A| = -13 / -7 = 13/7\n\ny = |Ay| / |A| = -9 / -7 = 9/7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 13/7\ny = 9/7"
