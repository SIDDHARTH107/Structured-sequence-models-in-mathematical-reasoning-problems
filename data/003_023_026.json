    "message_2": "To find the cross product of vector A and vector B, we can use the following formula:\n\nA x B = (A_y * B_z - A_z * B_y, A_z * B_x - A_x * B_z, A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x)\n\nGiven vector A = (2, 4, 1) and vector B = (-3, 5, 2), we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nA x B = (4 * 2 - 1 * 5, 1 * (-3) - 2 * 2, 2 * 5 - 4 * (-3))\n\nA x B = (3, -7, 22)\n\nSo, the cross product of vector A and vector B is (3, -7, 22)."
