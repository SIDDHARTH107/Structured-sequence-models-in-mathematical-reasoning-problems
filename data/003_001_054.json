    "message_2": "We can use the right triangle trigonometry to solve this problem. Let's denote the angle of elevation as θ. In this right triangle, the foot of the ladder is the adjacent side (5 meters), and the ladder itself is the hypotenuse (12 meters).\n\nWe can use the cosine function to find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse\ncos(θ) = 5 / 12\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse cosine (also called arccos or cos^(-1)) to find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(5/12)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nθ ≈ 65.38°\n\nSo, the angle of elevation the ladder makes with the ground is approximately 65.38°."
