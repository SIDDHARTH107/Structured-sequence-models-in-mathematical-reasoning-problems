    "message_1": "A building stands on level ground. From a point P on the ground, the angle of elevation of the top of the building is 37°. Moving 16 meters closer to the building, the angle of elevation is now 56°. How tall is the building?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the building as h, and the initial distance from point P to the building as x. We can use the tangent function to set up two equations based on the angle of elevation and the distance from the building.\n\nFrom the initial position:\ntan(37°) = h/x\n\nFrom the position 16 meters closer:\ntan(56°) = h/(x-16)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables (h and x). We can solve for one of the variables and then substitute it into the other equation to find the other variable.\n\nFirst, let's solve for h in terms of x from the first equation:\nh = x * tan(37°)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the second equation:\ntan(56°) = (x * tan(37°))/(x-16)\n\nNow we can solve for x:\nx * tan(37°) = (x-16) * tan(56°)\n\nDivide both sides by tan(37°):\nx = (x-16) * (tan(56°)/tan(37°))\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\nx * tan(37°) = x * tan(56°) - 16 * tan(56°)\n\nx * (tan(37°) - tan(56°)) = -16 * tan(56°)\n\nx = (-16 * tan(56°)) / (tan(37°) - tan(56°))\n\nUsing a calculator to find the tangent values and perform the calculations:\nx ≈ 39.97 meters\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the height of the building by substituting x back into the equation for h:\nh = x * tan(37°)\nh = 39.97 * tan(37°)\nh ≈ 29.97 meters\n\nTherefore, the height of the building is approximately 29.97 meters."
