    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Stackelberg Competition in Game Theory:\n\nSuppose there are two firms in a market (Firm 1 and Firm 2) that sell a homogenous good. Firm 1 is the leader and sets its quantity first. Firm 2 observes Firm 1's quantity and sets its quantity afterward. The inverse demand function is given by P = 10 - Q, where Q = q1 + q2 is the total quantity produced by the two firms. Both firms have the same constant marginal cost of 2. Find the quantity produced by Firm 1, the quantity produced by Firm 2, and the corresponding prices when both firms are in equilibrium.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll first find the reaction function for Firm 2, then use this to find the best response for Firm 1, and finally find the equilibrium quantities and price.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction function for Firm 2\nFirm 2's profit function is given by:\nπ2 = (P - MC) * q2 = (10 - Q - 2) * q2 = (8 - q1 - q2) * q2\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm 2 will choose q2 such that its first-order condition (FOC) is satisfied:\nd(π2)/dq2 = 8 - q1 - 2q2 = 0\n\nSolving for q2, we get Firm 2's reaction function:\nq2 = (8 - q1) / 2\n\nStep 2: Find the best response for Firm 1\nFirm 1's profit function is given by:\nπ1 = (P - MC) * q1 = (10 - Q - 2) * q1 = (8 - q1 - q2) * q1\n\nSubstitute Firm 2's reaction function into Firm 1's profit function:\nπ1 = (8 - q1 - (8 - q1) / 2) * q1 = (4 - q1/2) * q1\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm 1 will choose q1 such that its FOC is satisfied:\nd(π1)/dq1 = 4 - 2q1/2 = 0\n\nSolving for q1, we get Firm 1's best response:\nq1 = 4\n\nStep 3: Find the equilibrium quantities and price\nSubstitute q1 into Firm 2's reaction function to find q2:\nq2 = (8 - 4) / 2 = 2\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium price using the inverse demand function:\nP = 10 - Q = 10 - (q1 + q2) = 10 - (4 + 2) = 4\n\nSo, in equilibrium, Firm 1 produces a quantity of 4, Firm 2 produces a quantity of 2, and the market price is 4."
