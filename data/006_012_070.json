    "message_1": "What is the probability of theft occurring in a particular neighborhood if historical data shows that in the past year, out of 5000 households, theft occurred in 250 households?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of theft occurring in a particular neighborhood, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the successful outcome is a theft occurring, and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of households.\n\nProbability of theft = (Number of thefts) / (Total number of households)\nProbability of theft = 250 / 5000\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction:\n\nProbability of theft = 1 / 20\n\nSo, the probability of theft occurring in a particular neighborhood is 1/20 or 0.05, which is equivalent to 5% when expressed as a percentage."
