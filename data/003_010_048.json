    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use trigonometry. Let's denote the height of the flagpole as h, the distance from the person to the flagpole as d, and the angle of elevation as α. We are given the following information:\n\n1. The ground makes an angle of 35 degrees with the horizontal line.\n2. The person is standing at a distance of 20 meters from the flagpole.\n3. The angle of elevation of the top of the flagpole is 60 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to find the actual horizontal distance (x) between the person and the flagpole, since the given distance (20 meters) is along the inclined ground. We can use the cosine of the angle between the ground and the horizontal line (35 degrees) to find this distance:\n\nx = d * cos(35°)\nx = 20 * cos(35°)\nx ≈ 16.38 meters\n\nNow, we can use the tangent of the angle of elevation (60 degrees) to find the height of the flagpole:\n\ntan(α) = h / x\ntan(60°) = h / 16.38\nh = 16.38 * tan(60°)\nh ≈ 16.38 * 1.732\nh ≈ 28.35 meters\n\nTherefore, the height of the flagpole is approximately 28.35 meters."
