    "message_1": "If a double pendulum system has a mass of 0.5kg attached to the end of each arm that are 1 meter long, and it is released from an initial angle of 30 degrees with respect to the vertical, what is the maximum angle made by the second mass with respect to the vertical during its motion, and at what time does it occur if the system experiences chaotic behavior after a certain period of time?",
    "message_2": "The double pendulum system is a highly complex and non-linear system, which makes it difficult to predict its behavior analytically. The chaotic behavior of the system depends on the initial conditions and small changes in these conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an exact maximum angle and the time at which it occurs without resorting to numerical simulations.\n\nHowever, we can provide a general approach to solving this problem using the equations of motion for the double pendulum system and numerical integration techniques.\n\n1. Write down the Lagrangian for the double pendulum system, which is the difference between the kinetic and potential energies of the system.\n\n2. Use the Euler-Lagrange equations to derive the equations of motion for the system. These will be a set of four coupled second-order differential equations for the angles and angular velocities of the two pendulum masses.\n\n3. Convert the second-order differential equations into a set of first-order differential equations by introducing new variables for the angular velocities.\n\n4. Implement a numerical integration method, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to solve the set of first-order differential equations. This will give you the time evolution of the angles and angular velocities of the two pendulum masses.\n\n5. Analyze the numerical results to find the maximum angle made by the second mass with respect to the vertical and the time at which it occurs.\n\nNote that the chaotic behavior of the double pendulum system makes it highly sensitive to the initial conditions and numerical integration method used. Therefore, the maximum angle and the time at which it occurs may vary depending on the specific implementation of the numerical integration and the accuracy of the initial conditions."
