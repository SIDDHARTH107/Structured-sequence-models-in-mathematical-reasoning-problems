S_3 × Z_4 × Z_3: The direct product of the symmetric group S_3, the cyclic group of order 4, and the cyclic group of order 3.\n2. S_3 × Z_12: The direct product of the symmetric group S_3 and the cyclic group of order 12.\n3. S_3 × (Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_3): The direct product of the symmetric group S_3 and the direct product of the cyclic groups of order 2, 2, and 3.\n4. S_3 × D_12: The direct product of the symmetric group S_3 and the dihedral group of order 12.\n5. (Z_3 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_8: The semidirect product of the direct product of the cyclic groups of order 3 and 3 with the cyclic group of order 8.\n6. (Z_3 × Z_3) ⋊ Z_4: The semidirect product of the direct product of the cyclic groups of order 3 and 3 with the cyclic group of order 4.\n7. Z_9 ⋊ Z_8: The semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 9 with the cyclic group of order 8.\n8. Z_9 ⋊ Z_4: The semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 9 with the cyclic group of order 4.\n9. Z_3 ⋊ Q_8: The semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 3 with the quaternion group of order 8."
