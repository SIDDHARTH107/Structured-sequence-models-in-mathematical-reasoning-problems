    "message_2": "Let x be the number you are thinking of. We are given that x is odd and when multiplied by 5 and added to 24, the result is 89. We can write this as an equation:\n\n5x + 24 = 89\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n5x = 89 - 24\n5x = 65\nx = 65 / 5\nx = 13\n\nSo, the number you are thinking of is 13, which is an odd number."
