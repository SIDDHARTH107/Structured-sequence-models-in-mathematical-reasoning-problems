    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nTo find the cut vertices and bridges, we can use the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm and keep track of the discovery time and the lowest discovery time reachable from each vertex.\n\nAfter applying the DFS algorithm, we get the following information:\n\n```\nVertex | Discovery Time | Lowest Time\n   1   |       1        |      1\n   2   |       2        |      2\n   3   |       7        |      1\n   4   |       3        |      1\n   5   |       4        |      2\n   6   |       6        |      6\n   7   |       5        |      5\n```\n\nNow, we can identify the cut vertices and bridges:\n\nCut vertices:\n- Vertex 2: Removing vertex 2 will disconnect vertices 1, 3, and 4 from vertices 5, 6, and 7.\n- Vertex 4: Removing vertex 4 will disconnect vertex 3 from vertices 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7.\n- Vertex 5: Removing vertex 5 will disconnect vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 from vertex 6.\n\nBridges:\n- Edge (2, 5): Removing this edge will disconnect vertices 1, 3, and 4 from vertices 5, 6, and 7.\n- Edge (5, 6): Removing this edge will disconnect vertex 6 from vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nSo, the cut vertices are {2, 4, 5} and the bridges are {(2, 5), (5, 6)}."
