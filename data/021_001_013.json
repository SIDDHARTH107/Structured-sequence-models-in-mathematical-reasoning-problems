    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n|  2  3 -1 | 1 |\n|  3 -1  2 | 5 |\n| -1  2  4 | 0 |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 3 to have a non-zero element in the top-left corner:\n\n| -1  2  4 | 0 |\n|  3 -1  2 | 5 |\n|  2  3 -1 | 1 |\n\nStep 2: Add 3 times Row 1 to Row 2 and 2 times Row 1 to Row 3 to eliminate the first element in Row 2 and Row 3:\n\n| -1  2  4 |  0  |\n|  0  5 14 |  5  |\n|  0  7  7 |  1  |\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 5 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n| -1  2  4 |  0  |\n|  0  1 14/5 |  1  |\n|  0  7  7 |  1  |\n\nStep 4: Subtract 7 times Row 2 from Row 3 to eliminate the second element in Row 3:\n\n| -1  2  4 |  0  |\n|  0  1 14/5 |  1  |\n|  0  0 -21/5 | -6  |\n\nStep 5: Divide Row 3 by -21/5 to get a leading 1 in the third row:\n\n| -1  2  4 |  0  |\n|  0  1 14/5 |  1  |\n|  0  0  1 | 10/3 |\n\nNow, we have the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix. Let's perform back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 10/3.\n\nSubstitute the value of z into the second row equation:\n\ny + (14/5)(10/3) = 1\ny = 1 - (28/3)\ny = -1/3\n\nSubstitute the values of y and z into the first row equation:\n\n-x + 2(-1/3) + 4(10/3) = 0\nx = 8/3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 8/3, y = -1/3, z = 10/3"
