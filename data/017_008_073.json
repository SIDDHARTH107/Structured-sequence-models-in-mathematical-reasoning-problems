    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4, we will use the Sylow theorems. Since the order of G is 8, which is a power of a prime number (2^3), G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which we will denote as P. This means that P is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible orders of elements in G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G, which is 8. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 4, and 8.\n\n1. If G has an element of order 8, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C8.\n\n2. If G does not have an element of order 8 but has an element of order 4, let's denote this element as x. Since P is a normal subgroup of G, we can form the quotient group G/P. The order of G/P is 8/4 = 2, which means G/P is isomorphic to the cyclic group C2. Let y be an element in G that is not in P, so the coset yP has order 2 in G/P. Then, we can write G as the internal direct product of the subgroups generated by x and y, i.e., G = <x> Ã— <y>. Since the order of x is 4 and the order of y is 2, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4.\n\n3. If G does not have elements of order 8 or 4, then all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. In this case, G is a vector space over the field with two elements (Z_2), and its elements can be represented as 2x2 matrices with entries in Z_2. The group operation is matrix addition modulo 2. It can be shown that G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8 in this case.\n\nNow, if G has elements of order 4, as stated in the problem, we can eliminate the possibility of G being isomorphic to Q8, since Q8 does not have elements of order 4. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to either C8 or D4. If G is generated by a single element of order 8, then G is isomorphic to C8. Otherwise, G is isomorphic to D4."
