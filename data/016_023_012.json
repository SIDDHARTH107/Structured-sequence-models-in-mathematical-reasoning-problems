    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = $\\frac{\\log(N)}{\\log(s)}$\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, N is always 5, as it consists of 5 smaller copies of itself. When the number of sides of the initial square is increased to $6^8$, the scaling factor (s) is equal to the number of sides of the smaller squares, which is 6.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) can be calculated as:\n\nD = $\\frac{\\log(5)}{\\log(6)}$\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nD â‰ˆ 0.898\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal when the number of sides of the initial square is increased to $6^8$ is approximately 0.898."
