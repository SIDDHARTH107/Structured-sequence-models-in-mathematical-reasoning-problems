    "message_2": "First, let's find the curve C given by |h(z)| = 4. Since h(z) = 2z + 3, we have:\n\n|2z + 3| = 4\n\nNow, let's consider the transformation w = f(z) / g(z). We have:\n\nw = (z + 1) / (z² - 1)\n\nWe want to find the image of the curve C under this transformation. To do this, we can substitute z = x + iy into the transformation equation and separate the real and imaginary parts of w. Let w = u + iv, where u and v are real-valued functions of x and y. Then:\n\nu + iv = (x + 1 + iy) / (x² - 1 + 2ixy)\n\nTo separate the real and imaginary parts, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\nu + iv = ((x + 1 + iy)(x² - 1 - 2ixy)) / ((x² - 1)² + (2xy)²)\n\nExpanding the numerator and collecting real and imaginary terms, we get:\n\nu + iv = ((x + 1)(x² - 1) - y(2xy) + i((x + 1)(2xy) + y(x² - 1))) / ((x² - 1)² + (2xy)²)\n\nNow, we can write down the equations for u and v:\n\nu(x, y) = ((x + 1)(x² - 1) - y(2xy)) / ((x² - 1)² + (2xy)²)\nv(x, y) = ((x + 1)(2xy) + y(x² - 1)) / ((x² - 1)² + (2xy)²)\n\nNow, we need to find the image of the curve C under this transformation. We know that on the curve C, |2z + 3| = 4, so we can write:\n\n4 = |2(x + iy) + 3| = |2x + 2iy + 3|\n\nSquaring both sides and separating the real and imaginary parts, we get:\n\n16 = (2x + 3)² + (2y)²\n\nNow, we can substitute this equation into the expressions for u(x, y) and v(x, y) to find the image of the curve C under the transformation w = f(z) / g(z). This will give us the equation of the ellipse E in the uv-plane.\n\nFinally, to find a conformal map that sends the unit circle |z| = 1 onto the ellipse E, we can use the inverse transformation:\n\nz = g(w) / (1 - f(w))\n\nBy substituting the expressions for u(x, y) and v(x, y) into this inverse transformation, we can find a conformal map that sends the unit circle onto the ellipse E."
