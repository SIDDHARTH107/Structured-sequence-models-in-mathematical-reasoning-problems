    "message_2": "To find a formula for the nth term of the sequence, we first need to determine the pattern of the sequence. Let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n2 - 1 = 1\n4 - 2 = 2\n7 - 4 = 3\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are increasing by 1 each time. This suggests that the sequence is based on a quadratic function. Let's denote the nth term of the sequence as T(n).\n\nNow, let's assume that the quadratic function is in the form of T(n) = an^2 + bn + c. We can use the first 4 terms of the sequence to create a system of equations to solve for a, b, and c:\n\n1. T(1) = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 1\n2. T(2) = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 2\n3. T(3) = a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 4\n4. T(4) = a(4)^2 + b(4) + c = 7\n\nNow we can solve this system of equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 1\n2. 4a + 2b + c = 2\n3. 9a + 3b + c = 4\n4. 16a + 4b + c = 7\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2, equation 2 from equation 3, and equation 3 from equation 4:\n\n1. 3a + b = 1\n2. 5a + b = 2\n3. 7a + b = 3\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2 and equation 2 from equation 3:\n\n1. 2a = 1\n2. 2a = 1\n\nFrom equation 1, we can find the value of a:\n\na = 1/2\n\nNow we can find the value of b:\n\n3(1/2) + b = 1\nb = 1 - 3/2\nb = -1/2\n\nFinally, we can find the value of c:\n\n(1/2) - (1/2) + c = 1\nc = 1\n\nSo the formula for the nth term of the sequence is:\n\nT(n) = (1/2)n^2 - (1/2)n + 1"
