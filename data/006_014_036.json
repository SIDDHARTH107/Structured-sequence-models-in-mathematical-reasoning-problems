    "message_1": "A system consists of 6 identical components that operate independently of each other. The probability of each component failing is 0.05. What is the probability that at least one component fails?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can first find the probability that none of the components fail and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability that at least one component fails.\n\nThe probability of a single component not failing is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the components operate independently, the probability of all 6 components not failing is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(all components not failing) = 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.95^6 ≈ 0.7351\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one component fails:\n\nP(at least one component fails) = 1 - P(all components not failing) = 1 - 0.7351 ≈ 0.2649\n\nSo, the probability that at least one component fails is approximately 0.2649 or 26.49%."
