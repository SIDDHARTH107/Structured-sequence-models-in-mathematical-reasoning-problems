    "message_1": "A tree stands 15 meters tall. A person is standing 25 meters away from the base of the tree. What is the distance between the top of the tree and the person's eyes? (Assume the person's eyes are at a height of 1.7 meters from the ground)",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Pythagorean theorem. We have a right triangle with one leg being the horizontal distance between the person and the tree (25 meters), and the other leg being the vertical distance between the person's eyes and the top of the tree (15 - 1.7 = 13.3 meters).\n\nLet d be the distance between the top of the tree and the person's eyes. Then, we have:\n\nd^2 = 25^2 + 13.3^2\nd^2 = 625 + 176.89\nd^2 = 801.89\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find d:\n\nd = √801.89\nd ≈ 28.32 meters\n\nSo, the distance between the top of the tree and the person's eyes is approximately 28.32 meters."
