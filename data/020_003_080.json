    "message_2": "To find the global minimum value of the convex function $f(x) = x^2 - 4x - 5$, we can find the critical points by taking the first derivative and setting it to zero.\n\nThe first derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n\n$f'(x) = 2x - 4$\n\nSetting the first derivative to zero, we get:\n\n$2x - 4 = 0$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$x = 2$\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum. We can do this by analyzing the second derivative of $f(x)$. The second derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n\n$f''(x) = 2$\n\nSince the second derivative is positive for all values of $x$, the function is convex, and the critical point we found is indeed a global minimum.\n\nNow, we can find the global minimum value by plugging the value of $x$ back into the original function:\n\n$f(2) = (2)^2 - 4(2) - 5 = 4 - 8 - 5 = -9$\n\nThus, the global minimum value of $f(x) = x^2 - 4x - 5$ is $-9$."
