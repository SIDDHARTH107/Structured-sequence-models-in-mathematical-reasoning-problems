    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the car, we need to find the derivative of the velocity function with respect to time, which will give us the acceleration function a(t).\n\nThe velocity function is v(t) = 2t^2 - 6t + 5.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative:\n\na(t) = dv(t)/dt = d(2t^2 - 6t + 5)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\na(t) = 4t - 6\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration after 3 seconds. Plug t = 3 into the acceleration function:\n\na(3) = 4(3) - 6\na(3) = 12 - 6\na(3) = 6\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car after 3 seconds is 6 meters per second squared."
