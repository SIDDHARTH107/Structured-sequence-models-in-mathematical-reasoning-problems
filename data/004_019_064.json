    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car, we need to find the first derivative of the position function with respect to time, which represents the velocity function:\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(3t^2 + 4t + 5)$\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\n$v(t) = 6t + 4$\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at $t=4$ seconds by plugging in the value of $t$:\n\n$v(4) = 6(4) + 4 = 24 + 4 = 28$\n\nSo, the velocity of the car at $t=4$ seconds is $28$ meters per second.\n\nNext, to find the acceleration of the car, we need to find the second derivative of the position function with respect to time, which represents the acceleration function:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(3t^2 + 4t + 5)$\n\nWe already found the first derivative, which is the velocity function $v(t) = 6t + 4$. Now, we need to find the derivative of the velocity function:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(6t + 4)$\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\n$a(t) = 6$\n\nThe acceleration function is a constant, which means the acceleration of the car is always $6$ meters per second squared, regardless of the time. Therefore, the acceleration of the car at $t=4$ seconds is also $6$ meters per second squared.\n\nIn conclusion, the velocity of the car at $t=4$ seconds is $28$ meters per second, and the acceleration is $6$ meters per second squared."
