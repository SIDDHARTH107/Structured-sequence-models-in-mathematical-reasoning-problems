    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 27\n\nThe possible values of n_3 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. However, since n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3), the only possible values for n_3 are 1 and 27. \n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let P be this 3-Sylow subgroup. Since |P| = 27, we have that P = G. Since P is a p-group (p = 3), it follows that G is a cyclic group of order 27.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 27\nIn this case, there are 27 3-Sylow subgroups. Let P be one of these subgroups. Since |P| = 9, P is a group of order 9. By the Sylow Theorems, P must be normal in G. \n\nNow, let x be an element in G that is not in P. Since P is normal in G, the set {xp : p ∈ P} is also a 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Since there are 27 3-Sylow subgroups, there must be an element y in G such that y is not in P and y is not in {xp : p ∈ P}. \n\nLet Q = {y^3 : y ∈ G}. We claim that Q is a 3-Sylow subgroup of G. To see this, note that |Q| = 3 since y has order 3^2 = 9. Furthermore, Q is normal in G since it is the only 3-Sylow subgroup containing y^3. \n\nNow, consider the set P × Q = {(p, q) : p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. We claim that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q. To see this, define a map φ: G → P × Q by φ(g) = (g, g^3) for all g ∈ G. We will show that φ is an isomorphism.\n\n1. φ is a homomorphism: Let g, h ∈ G. Then φ(gh) = (gh, (gh)^3) = (gh, g^3h^3) = (g, g^3)(h, h^3) = φ(g)φ(h).\n\n2. φ is injective: Suppose φ(g) = φ(h) for some g, h ∈ G. Then (g, g^3) = (h, h^3), which implies g = h and g^3 = h^3. Thus, φ is injective.\n\n3. φ is surjective: Let (p, q) ∈ P × Q. Since P and Q are normal in G, there exists an element g ∈ G such that gP = p and g^3Q = q. Then φ(g) = (g, g^3) = (p, q), so φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a homomorphism, injective, and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of order 9 and 3, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 27 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
