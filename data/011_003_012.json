    "message_1": "Suppose you need to choose 5 books from a shelf containing 15 different books. In how many ways can you choose the books if the order in which you choose them doesn't matter? Use Pascal's Triangle to find the answer.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Pascal's Triangle, we need to find the combination formula which is given by:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 15 books), r is the number of items to choose (5 books), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nNow, let's find the corresponding entry in Pascal's Triangle. Pascal's Triangle is constructed by adding the two numbers diagonally above a number to get the number below it. The first few rows look like this:\n\n```\n       1\n      1 1\n     1 2 1\n    1 3 3 1\n   1 4 6 4 1\n  1 5 10 10 5 1\n 1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1\n```\n\nThe row number in Pascal's Triangle corresponds to the value of n, and the position of the number in that row corresponds to the value of r. For example, the number 6 in the 4th row and 2nd position corresponds to the combination C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6.\n\nIn our problem, we want to find C(15, 5). We need to look at the 15th row (remember that the first row is row 0) and the 5th position (again, the first position is position 0). The 15th row of Pascal's Triangle looks like this:\n\n1 15 105 455 1365 3003 5005 6435 6435 5005 3003 1365 455 105 15 1\n\nThe number in the 5th position is 3003. So, there are 3003 ways to choose 5 books from a shelf containing 15 different books if the order in which you choose them doesn't matter."
