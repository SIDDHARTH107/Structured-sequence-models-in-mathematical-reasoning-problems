    "message_2": "To apply the Differential Evolution (DE) optimization algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population.\n2. Mutate and crossover to create a trial vector.\n3. Perform selection.\n4. Check for convergence.\n\nLet's start by initializing the population with 20 random vectors within the domain [-5, 5].\n\n1. Initialize the population:\n\nWe will generate 20 random vectors (x1, x2, ..., x20) within the domain [-5, 5]. Let's assume we have generated these vectors.\n\n2. Mutate and crossover:\n\nFor each vector xi in the population, we will perform mutation and crossover as follows:\n\na. Select three distinct random vectors from the population, say xr1, xr2, and xr3.\nb. Compute the mutant vector vi = xr1 + 0.8 * (xr2 - xr3), where 0.8 is the scaling factor.\nc. Perform binomial crossover between xi and vi to create a trial vector ui. For each element j in the vectors, if a random number between 0 and 1 is less than 0.9 (crossover probability), then set uij = vij, otherwise set uij = xij.\n\n3. Perform selection:\n\nFor each vector xi in the population, compare the function value f(xi) with f(ui). If f(ui) is smaller, replace xi with ui in the population.\n\n4. Check for convergence:\n\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or a minimum change in the function value.\n\nAfter performing these steps, the global minimum of the function f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 6 within the domain [-5, 5] will be found in the population. Note that the actual implementation of the DE algorithm would require programming and numerical computations."
