    "message_2": "The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven a radius of 5 cm, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3)π(5)³\nV = (4/3) * 3.14159 * 125\nV = 1.33333 * 3.14159 * 125\nV ≈ 523.59833 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 523.6 cubic centimeters."
