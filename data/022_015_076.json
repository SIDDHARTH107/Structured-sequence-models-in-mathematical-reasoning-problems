    "message_2": "Let $z = x + iy$ with $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $x > 0$. We can write $f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$, where $u(x, y)$ and $v(x, y)$ are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of $f(z)$, respectively. From the symmetry condition, we have:\n\n$$f(\\overline{z}) = f(x - iy) = u(x, -y) - iv(x, -y) = \\overline{f(z)} = u(x, y) - iv(x, y).$$\n\nComparing the real and imaginary parts, we get:\n\n$$u(x, -y) = u(x, y) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v(x, -y) = -v(x, y).$$\n\nNow, let's consider the Cauchy-Riemann equations for $f(z)$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}.$$\n\nUsing the symmetry relations for $u$ and $v$, we can rewrite these equations as:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial (-y)} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}.$$\n\nTaking the partial derivative of the second equation with respect to $y$, we get:\n\n$$-\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial y}.$$\n\nAdding this equation to the partial derivative of the first equation with respect to $x$, we obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial y}.$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is holomorphic, it satisfies the Laplace equation:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = 0.$$\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0.$$\n\nNow, let $h(z) = f(z) - g(z)$. Since $g(z) = f(z)$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $h(z) = 0$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Moreover, $h(z)$ is holomorphic in $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus (-\\infty, 0]$ and satisfies the symmetry condition $h(\\overline{z}) = \\overline{h(z)}$. From the previous analysis, we have $\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0$. Integrating this equation with respect to $y$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = k(x),$$\n\nwhere $k(x)$ is a function of $x$ only. Integrating again with respect to $x$, we obtain:\n\n$$h(z) = K(x) + g(z),$$\n\nwhere $K(x)$ is an antiderivative of $k(x)$. Since $h(z) = 0$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $K(x) = -g(x)$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$f(z) = g(z) + K(x) = g(z) - g(x).$$\n\nThis is the explicit formula for $f(z)$ in terms of its restriction $g(z)$. To show that $f(z)$ extends to a holomorphic function in $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, we need to show that $f(z)$ is continuous and differentiable in $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Since $g(z)$ is continuous and differentiable in $\\mathbb{R}$ and $K(x)$ is continuous and differentiable in $\\mathbb{R}$, their difference $f(z) = g(z) - g(x)$ is continuous and differentiable in $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Therefore, $f(z)$ extends to a holomorphic function in $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$."
