    "message_2": "First, let's clarify that the given problem is about a circle in the x-y plane, so there is no z-component involved. Therefore, the tangent to the circle will be a line, not a plane. We will find the equation of the tangent line to the circle at the point (1, 2).\n\nThe equation of the circle with radius 3 centered at the origin is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 3^2\nx^2 + y^2 = 9\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at the point (1, 2). To do this, we can use the concept of implicit differentiation. Differentiating both sides of the circle equation with respect to x, we get:\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for dy/dx (the slope of the tangent line) by plugging in the point (1, 2):\n\n2(1) + 2(2)(dy/dx) = 0\n2 + 4(dy/dx) = 0\n\nSolving for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = -1/2\n\nNow that we have the slope of the tangent line, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nPlugging in the point (1, 2) and the slope -1/2:\n\ny - 2 = -1/2(x - 1)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\ny - 2 = -1/2x + 1/2\ny = -1/2x + 1/2 + 2\ny = -1/2x + 5/2\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the circle at the point (1, 2) is:\n\ny = -1/2x + 5/2"
