    "message_2": "Cuckoo Search (CS) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. In this algorithm, each egg in a nest represents a solution, and a cuckoo egg represents a new solution. The goal is to use the cuckoo search to find the best solution (nest) that minimizes the given function f(x).\n\nTo apply the cuckoo search algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of nests (solutions) randomly within the given interval.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each nest (solution) using the function f(x).\n3. Choose a random cuckoo egg (new solution) and evaluate its fitness.\n4. Replace the worst nest with the cuckoo egg if the cuckoo egg has better fitness.\n5. Update the nests using local search and evaluate their fitness.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum number of iterations).\n\nLet's apply the cuckoo search algorithm to find the minimum value of f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 in the interval [-2, 2].\n\n1. Initialize the population of nests:\n   Let's assume we have 5 nests: x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5, initialized randomly within the interval [-2, 2].\n\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each nest:\n   Calculate f(x) for each nest: f(x1), f(x2), f(x3), f(x4), and f(x5).\n\n3. Choose a random cuckoo egg:\n   Generate a random cuckoo egg (new solution) within the interval [-2, 2] and evaluate its fitness f(cuckoo).\n\n4. Replace the worst nest with the cuckoo egg:\n   If f(cuckoo) is better (lower) than the worst nest's fitness, replace the worst nest with the cuckoo egg.\n\n5. Update the nests using local search:\n   For each nest, generate a new solution within the neighborhood of the nest (e.g., using Levy flights) and evaluate its fitness. If the new solution has better fitness, replace the nest with the new solution.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the stopping criterion is met:\n   Continue iterating through the algorithm until the maximum number of iterations is reached or the fitness improvement is below a certain threshold.\n\nAfter completing the algorithm, the best nest (solution) will represent the minimum value of f(x) in the interval [-2, 2]. Note that the cuckoo search algorithm is a heuristic method, and the solution may not be the exact global minimum but an approximation. In this specific case, the exact minimum value of f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 can be found using calculus, and it occurs at x = 1 with f(1) = 0."
