    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function y = 3sin(4x) + 2, we need to identify the key components of the sine function.\n\nThe general form of a sine function is y = A*sin(Bx + C) + D, where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn our given function, y = 3sin(4x) + 2, we can see that:\n\nAmplitude (A) = 3\nB = 4\n\nNow, let's find the period. The period of a sine function is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |B|\n\nIn our case, B = 4, so the period is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / 4 = π/2\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function y = 3sin(4x) + 2 is 3, and the period is π/2."
