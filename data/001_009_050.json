    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. The like terms in this expression are the terms with the same variables raised to the same power.\n\nThe expression is: 2x² + 4xy + 2xy + 3y² - 5xy\n\nCombining the like terms (4xy, 2xy, and -5xy) gives us:\n\n2x² + (4xy + 2xy - 5xy) + 3y²\n\nNow, we add the coefficients of the like terms:\n\n2x² + (1xy) + 3y²\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n2x² + xy + 3y²"
