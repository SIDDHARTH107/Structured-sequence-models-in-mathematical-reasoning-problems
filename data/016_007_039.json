    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In this case, we are asked to find the volume and surface area of a Menger sponge of depth 3.\n\nFor a Menger sponge of depth n, the volume V_n and surface area A_n can be calculated using the following formulas:\n\nV_n = V_0 * (20/27)^n\nA_n = A_0 * (8/3)^n\n\nwhere V_0 and A_0 are the volume and surface area of the original cube, respectively. In this case, the original cube has sides of length 1 unit, so V_0 = 1^3 = 1 and A_0 = 6 * 1^2 = 6.\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume and surface area of a Menger sponge of depth 3:\n\nV_3 = V_0 * (20/27)^3\nV_3 = 1 * (20/27)^3\nV_3 ≈ 0.18047\n\nA_3 = A_0 * (8/3)^3\nA_3 = 6 * (8/3)^3\nA_3 ≈ 22.656\n\nSo, the volume of a Menger sponge of depth 3 is approximately 0.18047 cubic units, and the surface area is approximately 22.656 square units."
