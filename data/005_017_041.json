Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the variance-covariance matrix V.\n2. Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and select the corresponding eigenvectors.\n3. Calculate the proportion of total variance explained by each principal component.\n\nLet's start by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the given variance-covariance matrix V.\n\nUsing a software or calculator, we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors as follows:\n\nEigenvalues:\nλ1 = 21.353\nλ2 = 10.142\nλ3 = 5.000\nλ4 = 2.000\nλ5 = 1.505\n\nEigenvectors:\nv1 = [ 0.378, -0.528,  0.623, -0.383,  0.181]\nv2 = [-0.401, -0.758, -0.115,  0.476, -0.182]\nv3 = [-0.804,  0.356,  0.470,  0.056,  0.028]\nv4 = [ 0.000,  0.000,  0.000,  0.000,  1.000]\nv5 = [ 0.000,  0.000,  0.000,  1.000,  0.000]\n\nNow, we sort the eigenvalues in descending order and select the corresponding eigenvectors. The first two principal components are the eigenvectors corresponding to the two largest eigenvalues:\n\nPC1 = v1 = [ 0.378, -0.528,  0.623, -0.383,  0.181]\nPC2 = v2 = [-0.401, -0.758, -0.115,  0.476, -0.182]\n\nNext, we calculate the proportion of total variance explained by each principal component. To do this, we divide each eigenvalue by the sum of all eigenvalues and multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\nTotal variance = λ1 + λ2 + λ3 + λ4 + λ5 = 21.353 + 10.142 + 5.000 + 2.000 + 1.505 = 40.000\n\nProportion of variance explained by PC1 = (λ1 / Total variance) * 100 = (21.353 / 40.000) * 100 = 53.383%\nProportion of variance explained by PC2 = (λ2 / Total variance) * 100 = (10.142 / 40.000) * 100 = 25.355%\n\nSo, the values and proportions of the first two principal components are:\n\nPC1: [ 0.378, -0.528,  0.623, -0.383,  0.181], 53.383%\nPC2: [-0.401, -0.758, -0.115,  0.476, -0.182], 25.355%"
