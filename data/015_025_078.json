    "message_2": "To find the solution of the forced van der Pol oscillator with the given initial conditions, we can use numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method. Analytical solutions for this nonlinear differential equation are generally not available. Here, we will outline the steps to solve the problem numerically.\n\n1. Rewrite the second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\nLet $y_1 = x$ and $y_2 = \\frac{dx}{dt}$. Then, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dy_1}{dt} = y_2\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\frac{dy_2}{dt} = \\mu(1 - y_1^2)y_2 - y_1 + A\\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\n\n2. Define the initial conditions for the system of first-order differential equations:\n\nWe are given $x(0) = 1$ and $\\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = 0$. Therefore, we have $y_1(0) = 1$ and $y_2(0) = 0$.\n\n3. Implement a numerical method, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to solve the system of first-order differential equations:\n\nUsing a numerical method, we can obtain the values of $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ for different time points. The solution $x(t)$ we are looking for is given by $y_1(t)$.\n\n4. Obtain the numerical solution for $x(t)$:\n\nBy solving the system of first-order differential equations using the Runge-Kutta method or another numerical method, we can obtain the numerical solution for $x(t)$ that satisfies the given initial conditions.\n\nNote that the solution will depend on the specific numerical method used and the chosen time step. The forced van der Pol oscillator is a nonlinear system, and its behavior can be complex. However, the numerical solution will provide a good approximation of the system's behavior for the given initial conditions and parameter values."
