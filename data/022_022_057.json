Here's a numerical problem for Complex Analysis of Fourier Transforms:\n\nFind the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-x) u(x), where u(x) is the unit step function, i.e. u(x) = 0 for x < 0 and u(x) = 1 for x ≥ 0. \n\n(Note: The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is defined by the integral ∫[from -∞ to +∞] f(x) e^(-iωx) dx, where i is the imaginary unit and ω is a real parameter.)",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-x) u(x), we will use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[from -∞ to +∞] f(x) e^(-iωx) dx\n\nSince u(x) = 0 for x < 0 and u(x) = 1 for x ≥ 0, the integral becomes:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[from 0 to +∞] e^(-x) e^(-iωx) dx\n\nNow, combine the exponentials:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[from 0 to +∞] e^(-x(1 + iω)) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by substitution. Let t = x(1 + iω), so x = t / (1 + iω). Then, dx = dt / (1 + iω). The integral becomes:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[from 0 to +∞] e^(-t) (dt / (1 + iω))\n\nNow, integrate with respect to t:\n\nF(ω) = (1 / (1 + iω)) ∫[from 0 to +∞] e^(-t) dt\n\nThe integral of e^(-t) from 0 to +∞ is 1, so:\n\nF(ω) = (1 / (1 + iω))\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-x) u(x)."
