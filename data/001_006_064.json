    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic function f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 5, we can use the vertex formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic and linear terms, respectively. In this case, a = 2 and b = 3.\n\nx = -(3) / (2 * 2)\nx = -3 / 4\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging this x-value back into the function:\n\nf(-3/4) = 2(-3/4)^2 + 3(-3/4) - 5\n\nf(-3/4) = 2(9/16) - 9/4 - 5\nf(-3/4) = 9/8 - 9/4 - 5\nf(-3/4) = 9/8 - 18/8 - 40/8\nf(-3/4) = -49/8\n\nSo, the vertex coordinates are (-3/4, -49/8).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is:\n\nx = -3/4"
