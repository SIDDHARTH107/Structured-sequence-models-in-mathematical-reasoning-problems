    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in relation to Cournot competition in Game theory:\n\nConsider two firms, A and B, producing identical goods. The total cost of producing q units of the good for each firm is given by C(q) = 10q. The inverse demand function for the good is given by P = 100 - Q, where Q = qA + qB represents the total output of both firms. Assuming that each firm believes that the other will not change its output, find the Nash equilibrium output and profit for each firm in this Cournot model.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium output and profit for each firm, we first need to find the reaction functions for both firms A and B. The reaction function shows the best response of one firm to the output of the other firm.\n\nLet's start with firm A. The profit function for firm A is given by:\n\nπA = P * qA - C(qA)\nπA = (100 - Q) * qA - 10qA\nπA = (100 - (qA + qB)) * qA - 10qA\n\nNow, we need to find the first-order condition (FOC) for profit maximization by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to qA and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndπA/dqA = (100 - 2qA - qB) - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for qA, we get the reaction function for firm A:\n\nqA = (90 - qB) / 2\n\nNow, we do the same for firm B. The profit function for firm B is given by:\n\nπB = P * qB - C(qB)\nπB = (100 - Q) * qB - 10qB\nπB = (100 - (qA + qB)) * qB - 10qB\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to qB and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndπB/dqB = (100 - qA - 2qB) - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for qB, we get the reaction function for firm B:\n\nqB = (90 - qA) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the Nash equilibrium by solving the two reaction functions simultaneously:\n\nqA = (90 - qB) / 2\nqB = (90 - qA) / 2\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation:\n\nqB = (90 - ((90 - qB) / 2)) / 2\n\nSolving for qB:\n\nqB = 30\n\nNow, substituting qB back into the first equation:\n\nqA = (90 - 30) / 2\nqA = 30\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium output for both firms A and B is 30 units each.\n\nNow, we need to find the profit for each firm at the Nash equilibrium. We can use the profit function for each firm and plug in the equilibrium output:\n\nπA = (100 - (30 + 30)) * 30 - 10 * 30\nπA = 40 * 30 - 10 * 30\nπA = 1200\n\nπB = (100 - (30 + 30)) * 30 - 10 * 30\nπB = 40 * 30 - 10 * 30\nπB = 1200\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium profit for both firms A and B is 1200 each."
