    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = 2x + 3 between the x-values of 0 and 5, we need to integrate the function with respect to x from 0 to 5.\n\nâˆ«(2x + 3)dx from 0 to 5\n\nFirst, find the antiderivative of the function:\n\nAntiderivative of 2x is x^2, and antiderivative of 3 is 3x. So, the antiderivative is:\n\nx^2 + 3x\n\nNow, evaluate the antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\n(x^2 + 3x)| from 0 to 5\n\n= (5^2 + 3*5) - (0^2 + 3*0)\n= (25 + 15) - (0 + 0)\n= 40\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = 2x + 3 between the x-values of 0 and 5 is 40 square units."
