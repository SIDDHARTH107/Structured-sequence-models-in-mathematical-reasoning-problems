    "message_1": "Suppose there are two gas stations, A and B, located on opposite sides of a highway. Both charge the same price, $2.50 per gallon, for gasoline. However, station A is 1 mile closer to the majority of drivers, while station B is 1 mile closer to the minority of drivers. The cost of driving 1 mile is $0.10. If station A and B both advertise their prices, which station will attract more customers and what will be their profits?",
    "message_2": "To determine which station will attract more customers and their profits, we need to consider the cost of driving to each station for the majority and minority of drivers.\n\nLet's assume that the majority of drivers represent \"x\" percent of the total drivers, and the minority of drivers represent \"(100-x)\" percent of the total drivers.\n\nFor the majority of drivers:\n- Cost of driving to station A: $2.50 per gallon\n- Cost of driving to station B: $2.50 per gallon + $0.10 (additional 1 mile)\n\nFor the minority of drivers:\n- Cost of driving to station A: $2.50 per gallon + $0.10 (additional 1 mile)\n- Cost of driving to station B: $2.50 per gallon\n\nSince the majority of drivers will choose the station with the lowest cost, they will choose station A. Similarly, the minority of drivers will choose station B.\n\nNow, let's calculate the profits for each station. We'll assume that each driver buys 1 gallon of gasoline.\n\nProfit for station A:\n- Revenue: $2.50 per gallon * x% of total drivers\n- Cost: $0 (since we're not considering the cost of providing gasoline)\n- Profit: $2.50x% of total drivers\n\nProfit for station B:\n- Revenue: $2.50 per gallon * (100-x)% of total drivers\n- Cost: $0 (since we're not considering the cost of providing gasoline)\n- Profit: $2.50(100-x)% of total drivers\n\nSince x > (100-x), station A will attract more customers and have higher profits. The profits for each station will depend on the percentage of majority and minority drivers (x and 100-x)."
