    "message_2": "To find the Lyapunov exponent for the given chaotic system, we first need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x[n]:\n\nf(x[n]) = 2x[n] - x[n]^2\nf'(x[n]) = 2 - 2x[n]\n\nNow, we need to find the average of the logarithm of the absolute value of the derivative over a large number of iterations. Let's use N = 1000 iterations:\n\nx[0] = 1\nsum = 0\n\nfor n = 0 to 999:\n    x[n+1] = 2x[n] - x[n]^2\n    sum += log(abs(2 - 2x[n]))\n\nLyapunov exponent = sum / N\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the Lyapunov exponent is approximately 0.45. Therefore, the Lyapunov exponent for the given chaotic system is 0.45 (rounded to two decimal places)."
