    "message_2": "First, we need to create the 5x5 matrix using the keyword \"CRYPTO\". We will remove any duplicate letters from the keyword and then fill in the remaining spaces in the matrix with the rest of the alphabet (excluding \"J\" since it's a 5x5 matrix).\n\nThe matrix will look like this:\n\nC R Y P T\nO A B D E\nF G H I K\nL M N S U\nV W X Z Q\n\nNow, we will encrypt the plaintext \"MATHSTUDENT\". We need to divide the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, we insert an \"X\" between them. In this case, we don't need to do that.\n\nDigraphs: MA TH ST UD EN T\n\nNow, we will find each pair of letters in the matrix and apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n1. If both letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their right (wrap around if needed).\n2. If both letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters below them (wrap around if needed).\n3. If the letters form a rectangle, replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other corners of the rectangle.\n\nMA -> OD\nTH -> YI\nST -> CR\nUD -> KU\nEN -> ZA\nT -> TX (We need to add an extra letter to the last pair)\n\nEncrypted digraphs: OD YI CR KU ZA TX\n\nThe encrypted text is: ODYICRKUZATX"
