    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = 3x^2 + 2y^2 at the point (1,1,5), we first need to find the first and second partial derivatives of z with respect to x and y.\n\n1. First partial derivatives:\n∂z/∂x = 6x\n∂z/∂y = 4y\n\n2. Second partial derivatives:\n∂²z/∂x² = 6\n∂²z/∂y² = 4\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0 (since there's no mixed term xy in the equation)\n\nNow, we need to compute the E, F, and G coefficients, which are given by the following formulas:\nE = 1 + (∂z/∂x)^2\nF = ∂z/∂x * ∂z/∂y\nG = 1 + (∂z/∂y)^2\n\nAt the point (1,1,5), we have:\n∂z/∂x = 6(1) = 6\n∂z/∂y = 4(1) = 4\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\nE = 1 + 6^2 = 37\nF = 6 * 4 = 24\nG = 1 + 4^2 = 17\n\nNext, we need to compute the L, M, and N coefficients, which are given by the following formulas:\nL = ∂²z/∂x² / sqrt(E * G - F^2)\nM = ∂²z/∂x∂y / sqrt(E * G - F^2)\nN = ∂²z/∂y² / sqrt(E * G - F^2)\n\nUsing the second partial derivatives we found earlier, we have:\nL = 6 / sqrt(37 * 17 - 24^2)\nM = 0 / sqrt(37 * 17 - 24^2)\nN = 4 / sqrt(37 * 17 - 24^2)\n\nFinally, the mean curvature H is given by the formula:\nH = (L * N - M^2) / 2\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nH = (6 * 4 - 0^2) / (2 * sqrt(37 * 17 - 24^2))\nH = 12 / sqrt(629 - 576)\nH = 12 / sqrt(53)\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface z = 3x^2 + 2y^2 at the point (1,1,5) is H = 12 / sqrt(53)."
