    "message_2": "To find the critical points of g, we need to compute its differential dg and find the points x ∈ M where dg(x) = 0.\n\nFirst, let's compute dg. Since g(x) = f(x) - 1, we have:\n\ndg = df - d(1) = df,\n\nwhere we used the fact that the differential of a constant function is zero.\n\nNow, we are given that df has no critical points, which means that df(x) ≠ 0 for all x ∈ M. Since dg = df, it follows that dg(x) ≠ 0 for all x ∈ M as well.\n\nTherefore, the function g has no critical points on the symplectic manifold (M,ω)."
