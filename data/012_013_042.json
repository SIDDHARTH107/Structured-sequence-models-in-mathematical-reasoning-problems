    "message_2": "The chromatic polynomial of a graph G, denoted as P(G, k), is a polynomial that counts the number of proper k-colorings of the graph G. A proper k-coloring is an assignment of k colors to the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nFor a complete graph with n vertices, denoted as K_n, the chromatic polynomial can be determined using the following formula:\n\nP(K_n, k) = k(k-1)^{n-1}\n\nIn this case, we have a complete graph with 7 vertices, so n = 7. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\nP(K_7, k) = k(k-1)^{7-1}\nP(K_7, k) = k(k-1)^6\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of a complete graph with 7 vertices is P(K_7, k) = k(k-1)^6."
