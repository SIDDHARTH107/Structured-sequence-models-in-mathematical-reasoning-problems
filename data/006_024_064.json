    "message_2": "The probability of a flight not being delayed is the complement of the probability of it being delayed. Since the probability of a flight being delayed is 20%, the probability of it not being delayed is 100% - 20% = 80%.\n\nThe family of 5 books tickets for the same flight, so the probability of their flight not being delayed is still 80%."
