    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we'll use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we'll multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same:\n\n1. Multiply the first equation by 2:\n   6x + 4y = 36\n\n2. Multiply the second equation by 1 (no change needed as the coefficient of y is already 4):\n   -5x + 4y = 2\n\nNow, we can eliminate the y variable by adding the two equations:\n\n(6x + 4y) + (-5x + 4y) = 36 + 2\n(6x - 5x) + (4y - 4y) = 38\nx = 38\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to find the value of y. We'll use the first equation:\n\n3x + 2y = 18\n3(38) + 2y = 18\n114 + 2y = 18\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\n2y = 18 - 114\n2y = -96\ny = -48\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 38 and y = -48."
