    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve of order n is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The length of a Hilbert curve can be determined by the number of segments it has. In each order, the number of segments increases by a factor of 4.\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 1, there are 4 segments.\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 2, there are 4^2 = 16 segments.\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 3, there are 4^3 = 64 segments.\n\nSince each segment has a length of 1 unit, the length of a Hilbert curve of order 3 is 64 units."
