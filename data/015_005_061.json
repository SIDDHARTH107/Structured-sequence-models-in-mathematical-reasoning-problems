    "message_1": "What is the minimum value of the Rössler system's parameter \"a\" such that the system exhibits chaotic behavior?\n\nHint: The Rössler system is defined by the following set of differential equations: \n\ndx/dt = - y - z \n\ndy/dt = x + ay \n\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c) \n\nwhere a, b, and c are system parameters. The Rössler system exhibits chaotic behavior when a is greater than a certain critical value.",
    "message_2": "The minimum value of the Rössler system's parameter \"a\" for which the system exhibits chaotic behavior depends on the values of parameters \"b\" and \"c\". However, for a commonly studied case where b = 0.2 and c = 5.7, the critical value of \"a\" is approximately a ≈ 0.1. When a > 0.1, the Rössler system exhibits chaotic behavior for these specific values of b and c. Keep in mind that this critical value may change for different values of b and c."
