    "message_1": "A charity organization is trying to raise funds from three potential donors, A, B, and C. Each donor has a different valuation for the charity's cause, and the organization wants to design a mechanism (i.e., an auction) that maximizes its revenue. The valuations of donors A, B, and C are $50, $75, and $100, respectively. What is the optimal mechanism (i.e., auction) that the charity organization should use to maximize its revenue?",
    "message_2": "The charity organization should use a sealed-bid, second-price auction (also known as a Vickrey auction) to maximize its revenue.\n\nIn a sealed-bid, second-price auction, each donor submits a sealed bid representing the amount they are willing to donate. The highest bidder wins the auction, but they only pay the amount of the second-highest bid.\n\nHere's why this auction mechanism is optimal for the charity organization:\n\n1. It encourages truthful bidding: Since the winner pays the second-highest bid, there is no incentive for donors to underbid or overbid their true valuation. They can simply bid their true valuation without worrying about overpaying or losing the auction.\n\n2. It maximizes revenue: By encouraging truthful bidding, the charity organization can be sure that it is receiving the highest possible amount from the donors.\n\nIn this case, the donors' valuations are $50, $75, and $100. If they all bid their true valuations, donor C would win the auction with a bid of $100, but they would only pay the second-highest bid, which is $75. This maximizes the revenue for the charity organization."
