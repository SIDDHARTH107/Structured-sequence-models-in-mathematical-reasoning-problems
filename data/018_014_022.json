    "message_2": "First, let's find the complements of sets A and B. Since no universal set is given, we will assume the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B. So, U = {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nA' = U - A = {4}\nB' = U - B = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n1. A x (A' U B'):\n\nA' U B' = {1, 4}\n\nA x (A' U B') = A x {1, 4} = {(1,1), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (3,4)}\n\n2. (A x A') U (A x B'):\n\nA x A' = {(1,4), (2,4), (3,4)}\n\nA x B' = {(1,1), (2,1), (3,1)}\n\n(A x A') U (A x B') = {(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)}\n\nComparing the results:\n\nA x (A' U B') = {(1,1), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (3,4)}\n\n(A x A') U (A x B') = {(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)}\n\nWe can see that A x (A' U B') = (A x A') U (A x B'), which means the distributive law involving complement holds for Cartesian product in this particular case. However, this does not prove that the distributive law holds for all cases. To show that the distributive law involving complement does not hold for Cartesian product in general, we need to find a counterexample.\n\nLet's consider the following sets:\n\nA = {1}\nB = {2}\n\nThe universal set U will be {1, 2}, so:\n\nA' = {2}\nB' = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n1. A x (A' U B'):\n\nA' U B' = {1, 2}\n\nA x (A' U B') = A x {1, 2} = {(1,1), (1,2)}\n\n2. (A x A') U (A x B'):\n\nA x A' = {(1,2)}\n\nA x B' = {(1,1)}\n\n(A x A') U (A x B') = {(1,2), (1,1)}\n\nComparing the results:\n\nA x (A' U B') = {(1,1), (1,2)}\n\n(A x A') U (A x B') = {(1,2), (1,1)}\n\nIn this case, A x (A' U B') = (A x A') U (A x B'), which means the distributive law involving complement holds for Cartesian product. However, this does not prove that the distributive law holds for all cases. To show that the distributive law involving complement does not hold for Cartesian product in general, we need to find a counterexample.\n\nLet's consider the following sets:\n\nA = {1}\nB = {2}\nC = {3}\n\nThe universal set U will be {1, 2, 3}, so:\n\nA' = {2, 3}\nB' = {1, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n1. A x (A' U B'):\n\nA' U B' = {1, 2, 3}\n\nA x (A' U B') = A x {1, 2, 3} = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)}\n\n2. (A x A') U (A x B'):\n\nA x A' = {(1,2), (1,3)}\n\nA x B' = {(1,1), (1,3)}\n\n(A x A') U (A x B') = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,1), (1,3)}\n\nComparing the results:\n\nA x (A' U B') = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)}\n\n(A x A') U (A x B') = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,1), (1,3)}\n\nWe can see that A x (A' U B') â‰  (A x A') U (A x B'), which means the distributive law involving complement does not hold for Cartesian product in this particular case.
