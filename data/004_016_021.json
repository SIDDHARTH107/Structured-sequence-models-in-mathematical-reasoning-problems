    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, the function we're considering is the position function of the car, which we can denote as s(t), where s is the distance traveled and t is the time. Since the car is traveling at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour, the derivative of the position function, s'(t), is equal to the constant speed, 50 mph. This means that the function is differentiable on the open interval (0, 3) and continuous on the closed interval [0, 3].\n\nNow, we want to find the distance the car travels during a 3 hour period. To do this, we can use the Mean Value Theorem. The average rate of change of the position function over the interval [0, 3] is given by:\n\n(s(3) - s(0)) / (3 - 0)\n\nSince the car is traveling at a constant speed of 50 mph, we know that there exists a point c in the interval (0, 3) such that s'(c) = 50 mph. Since s'(t) is constant, s'(c) = s'(t) for all t in the interval (0, 3). Therefore, the average rate of change of the position function over the interval [0, 3] is also 50 mph.\n\nNow we can set up the equation:\n\n(s(3) - s(0)) / (3 - 0) = 50\n\nSolving for s(3) - s(0), which represents the distance traveled during the 3 hour period:\n\n(s(3) - s(0)) = 50 * (3 - 0)\n(s(3) - s(0)) = 50 * 3\n(s(3) - s(0)) = 150\n\nSo, the car travels a distance of 150 miles during the 3 hour period."
