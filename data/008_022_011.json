    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n|  2  3  |  7  |\n| 10 15.001 | 35 |\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  1.5  |  3.5  |\n| 10 15.001 | 35 |\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with the second row minus 10 times the first row:\n\n|  1  1.5  |  3.5  |\n|  0 -0.499 | -0.5 |\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -0.499 to get a leading 1:\n\n|  1  1.5  |  3.5  |\n|  0  1  |  1.002004  |\n\nStep 4: Replace the first row with the first row minus 1.5 times the second row:\n\n|  1  0  |  1.497006  |\n|  0  1  |  1.002004  |\n\nThe resulting matrix represents the system of equations:\n\nx = 1.497006\ny = 1.002004\n\nSo, the values of x and y that satisfy the given system of equations are approximately x = 1.497 and y = 1.002.\n\nNow, let's discuss the conditioning of the matrix. The condition number of a matrix is a measure of how sensitive the solution is to small changes in the input. A matrix is considered ill-conditioned if its condition number is large, which means that small changes in the input can lead to large changes in the solution.\n\nIn this case, the original matrix is:\n\n|  2  3  |\n| 10 15.001 |\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is (2 * 15.001) - (3 * 10) = 0.002, which is very close to zero. This indicates that the matrix is nearly singular, and thus, it is ill-conditioned. This means that the solution we found may be sensitive to small changes in the input, and the system of equations is not well-suited for numerical computations."
