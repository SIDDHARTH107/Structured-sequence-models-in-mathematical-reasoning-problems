    "message_2": "The question you're asking is related to the concept of computable numbers and Turing machines. A computable number is a real number that can be computed to within any desired precision by a finite, terminating algorithm, such as a halting Turing machine.\n\nHowever, the question you're asking is not well-defined, as there is no smallest natural number that cannot be obtained as the output of a halting Turing machine that takes a natural number as input. This is because Turing machines can compute any computable function, and there is no limit to the natural numbers that can be computed by a Turing machine. For any natural number you can think of, there exists a Turing machine that can compute it."
