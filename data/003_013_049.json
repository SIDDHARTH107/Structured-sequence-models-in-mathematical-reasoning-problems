Assume that the height of a passenger on the wheel varies sinusoidally as the wheel rotates, with the lowest point being at ground level. \nFind the maximum and minimum height of the passenger, as well as the height of the passenger at the halfway point of a rotation.",
    "message_2": "The diameter of the Ferris wheel is 40 meters, so the radius is half of that, which is 20 meters. Since the height varies sinusoidally, we can model the height of a passenger as a function of time with a sine function.\n\nLet h(t) be the height of the passenger at time t (in minutes). Since the lowest point is at ground level, the function will have the form:\n\nh(t) = A * sin(B * (t - C)) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nThe amplitude A is equal to the radius of the wheel, which is 20 meters. The period of the function is the time it takes for the wheel to make one complete revolution, which is 2 minutes. The frequency B is the reciprocal of the period, so B = 1/2. Since the height starts at the minimum, there is no phase shift, so C = 0. The vertical shift D is the average height of the passenger, which is equal to the radius, so D = 20 meters.\n\nSo the function is:\n\nh(t) = 20 * sin((1/2) * t) + 20\n\nNow we can find the maximum and minimum height of the passenger. The maximum height occurs when the sine function is at its maximum value, which is 1:\n\nh_max = 20 * 1 + 20 = 40 meters\n\nThe minimum height occurs when the sine function is at its minimum value, which is 0:\n\nh_min = 20 * 0 + 20 = 20 meters\n\nTo find the height of the passenger at the halfway point of a rotation, we need to find the height at t = 1 minute (half of the 2-minute period):\n\nh(1) = 20 * sin((1/2) * 1) + 20 = 20 * sin(1/2) + 20 ≈ 20 * 0.4794 + 20 ≈ 9.588 + 20 ≈ 29.588 meters\n\nSo the maximum height is 40 meters, the minimum height is 20 meters, and the height at the halfway point of a rotation is approximately 29.588 meters."
