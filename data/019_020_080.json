    "message_2": "To find the number of pairings for a set of 10 numbers, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of elements in the set (in this case, 10) and k is the number of elements we want to choose (in this case, 2 for a pair).\n\nSo, the number of pairings for a set of 10 numbers is:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n          = 10! / (2! * 8!)\n          = (10 * 9 * 8!)/(2 * 8!)\n          = (10 * 9) / 2\n          = 45\n\nThere are 45 possible pairings of the 10 numbers."
