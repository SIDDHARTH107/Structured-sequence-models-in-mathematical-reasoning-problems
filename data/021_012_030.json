    "message_2": "To find the dimensions of the box with the smallest surface area, we can use the quasi-Newton method to minimize the surface area function with the constraint of the given volume. Let the dimensions of the box be x, y, and z. The volume and surface area of the box are given by:\n\nVolume: V = xyz = 50\nSurface Area: S = 2(xy + xz + yz)\n\nWe need to minimize the surface area S subject to the constraint V = 50. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the Lagrangian function L(x, y, z, λ) as follows:\n\nL(x, y, z, λ) = 2(xy + xz + yz) + λ(50 - xyz)\n\nNow we need to find the critical points of L by taking the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and λ, and setting them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x = 2(y + z) - λyz = 0\n∂L/∂y = 2(x + z) - λxz = 0\n∂L/∂z = 2(x + y) - λxy = 0\n∂L/∂λ = 50 - xyz = 0\n\nWe can rewrite the first three equations as:\n\nyz = 2(y + z) / λ\nxz = 2(x + z) / λ\nxy = 2(x + y) / λ\n\nNow, divide the first equation by the second equation:\n\n(yz) / (xz) = (2(y + z) / λ) / (2(x + z) / λ)\ny / x = (y + z) / (x + z)\n\nSimilarly, divide the second equation by the third equation:\n\n(xz) / (xy) = (2(x + z) / λ) / (2(x + y) / λ)\nz / y = (x + z) / (x + y)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables (x and y):\n\ny / x = (y + z) / (x + z)\nz / y = (x + z) / (x + y)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the relationship between x, y, and z. From the first equation, we can express z in terms of x and y:\n\nz = x(y - x) / (y - x)\n\nSubstitute this expression for z into the second equation:\n\nx(y - x) / (y^2 - xy) = (x + x(y - x) / (y - x)) / (x + y)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nx(y - x) = y(x + x(y - x) / (y - x))\nx(y - x)(y - x) = y(x + x(y - x))\nx(y - x)^2 = yx^2\n\nNow, we can solve for the ratio x/y:\n\nx / y = (y - x) / x\n1 / (x / y) = (y - x) / x\ny / x = x / (y - x)\n\nSince both x/y and y/x are equal to the same expression, we can conclude that x = y. Now, substitute x = y into the expression for z:\n\nz = x(y - x) / (y - x)\nz = x\n\nSo, x = y = z. Now we can use the volume constraint to find the dimensions:\n\nV = xyz = 50\nx^3 = 50\nx = y = z = (50)^(1/3) ≈ 3.684\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that will result in the smallest surface area are approximately 3.684 meters x 3.684 meters x 3.684 meters."
