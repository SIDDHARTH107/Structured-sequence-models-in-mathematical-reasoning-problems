The constants alpha, u_xx and u_yy are the thermal diffusivity, the second derivative of u with respect to x and the second derivative of u with respect to y, respectively.\n\nAssuming a rectangular image of size 512 x 512 and initial temperature distribution of u(x,y,0) = sin(pi*x/512)*sin(pi*y/512), write a MATLAB code to solve the partial differential equation using finite difference method for any given value of alpha and time t.
