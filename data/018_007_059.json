    "message_2": "Let X be a set with 3 elements, i.e., X = {a, b, c}. The power set of X, denoted as P(X), is the set of all possible subsets of X, including the empty set and X itself.\n\nP(X) = {âˆ…, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}\n\nWe can see that there are 8 elements in P(X). Now, let's compare this with the number of elements in X itself, which is 3.\n\nSince the number of elements in P(X) (8 elements) is greater than the number of elements in X (3 elements), we can conclude that the power set of X is always larger than X itself.\n\nTo generalize this, for any set X with n elements, the power set of X will have 2^n elements. This is because each element in X can either be included or not included in a subset, resulting in 2 possibilities for each element. Therefore, there are 2^n possible subsets in the power set of X. Since 2^n is always greater than n for any positive integer n, the power set of X will always be larger than X itself."
