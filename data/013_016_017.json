    "message_1": "Suppose a company hires a worker for a salary of $50,000 per year, but there is a chance the worker will shirk on the job, reducing the company's profit by $20,000. The worker's effort level is unobservable to the employer. If the worker is caught shirking, they will be fired and receive no salary for the year. If the worker works diligently, they will receive a bonus of $10,000. \n\nAssuming the worker is risk-neutral, what is their optimal effort level to maximize their expected utility? Assume that diligent effort reduces the probability of being caught shirking by half.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the probability of being caught shirking as p. If the worker shirks, their expected utility is:\n\nEU_shirk = (1 - p) * $50,000 + p * $0\n\nIf the worker works diligently, they will receive a bonus of $10,000 and reduce the probability of being caught shirking by half. So, their expected utility when working diligently is:\n\nEU_diligent = (1 - p/2) * ($50,000 + $10,000) + (p/2) * $0\n\nTo find the optimal effort level, we need to compare the expected utilities of shirking and working diligently. The worker will choose to work diligently if:\n\nEU_diligent > EU_shirk\n\n(1 - p/2) * $60,000 > (1 - p) * $50,000\n\nNow, let's solve for p:\n\n$60,000 - $30,000p > $50,000 - $50,000p\n\n$10,000 > $20,000p\n\np < 0.5\n\nSo, the worker will choose to work diligently if the probability of being caught shirking is greater than 0.5. If the probability is less than or equal to 0.5, the worker will choose to shirk. Therefore, the optimal effort level for the worker to maximize their expected utility depends on the probability of being caught shirking. If p > 0.5, the worker should work diligently, and if p â‰¤ 0.5, the worker should shirk."
