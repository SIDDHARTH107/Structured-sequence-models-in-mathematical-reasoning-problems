    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player 1 has been given $100 to split between themselves and Player 2. Player 1 can choose to keep any portion of the $100 for themselves and give the rest to Player 2. However, whatever amount Player 1 decides to keep, Player 2 will receive the remaining amount. If Player 2 receives less than $20, they will reject the offer and both players will receive $0. What is the minimum amount Player 1 can keep for themselves without risking the rejection of the offer?",
    "message_2": "To ensure that Player 2 does not reject the offer, Player 1 must give them at least $20. Therefore, the minimum amount Player 1 can keep for themselves without risking the rejection of the offer is:\n\n$100 - $20 = $80"
