    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Edge length of the cube = 6 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the sphere:\n\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 6 cm / 2 = 3 cm\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\nVolume (V) = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (3 cm)^3\nV = (4/3) * π * 27 cm^3\nV = 36π cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is 36π cubic centimeters."
