Divide the larger number (24) by the smaller number (16) and find the remainder.\n   24 รท 16 = 1 with a remainder of 8.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (24) with the smaller number (16) and the smaller number with the remainder (8).\n   Now we need to find the GCD of 16 and 8.\n\n3. Divide the new larger number (16) by the new smaller number (8) and find the remainder.\n   16 รท 8 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD of 16 and 24 is the last non-zero remainder, which is 8."
