    "message_2": "To find u(0, 1), we can use the Poisson integral formula for the unit disk. The Poisson integral formula states that for a harmonic function u(x, y) defined on the unit disk D, we have:\n\nu(x, y) = (1/π) ∫_(0)^(2π) u(r*cos(θ), r*sin(θ)) * P(r, θ, x, y) dθ,\n\nwhere r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2), and P(r, θ, x, y) is the Poisson kernel given by:\n\nP(r, θ, x, y) = (1 - r^2) / (1 - 2*r*cos(θ) + r^2).\n\nIn our case, we have u(x, 0) = x^2 - 1, and we want to find u(0, 1). So, we have x = 0 and y = 1, which gives r = 1. The Poisson integral formula becomes:\n\nu(0, 1) = (1/π) ∫_(0)^(2π) u(cos(θ), sin(θ)) * P(1, θ, 0, 1) dθ.\n\nSince u(x, 0) = x^2 - 1, we have u(cos(θ), 0) = cos^2(θ) - 1. Also, P(1, θ, 0, 1) = (1 - 1^2) / (1 - 2*1*cos(θ) + 1^2) = -cos(θ). Thus, the integral becomes:\n\nu(0, 1) = (1/π) ∫_(0)^(2π) (cos^2(θ) - 1) * (-cos(θ)) dθ.\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use the trigonometric identity cos^2(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Then, the integral becomes:\n\nu(0, 1) = (1/π) ∫_(0)^(2π) ((1 + cos(2θ))/2 - 1) * (-cos(θ)) dθ\n         = (1/π) ∫_(0)^(2π) (cos(2θ)/2 - 1/2) * (-cos(θ)) dθ.\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nu(0, 1) = (1/π) [∫_(0)^(2π) (cos(2θ)/2) * (-cos(θ)) dθ - ∫_(0)^(2π) (1/2) * (-cos(θ)) dθ].\n\nThe first integral can be evaluated using integration by parts, and the second integral can be evaluated directly:\n\n∫_(0)^(2π) (cos(2θ)/2) * (-cos(θ)) dθ = 0 (since it's an odd function integrated over a symmetric interval)\n\n∫_(0)^(2π) (1/2) * (-cos(θ)) dθ = [-1/2 * sin(θ)]_(0)^(2π) = 0.\n\nTherefore, u(0, 1) = 0."
