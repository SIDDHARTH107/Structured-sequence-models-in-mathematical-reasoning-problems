    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on a 25-meter tall building. From a point on the ground 40 meters away from the building, the angle of elevation of the top of the flagpole is 53 degrees. What is the height of the flagpole?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the flagpole as h meters. We can use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle. In this case, the opposite side is the total height of the building and the flagpole (25 + h), and the adjacent side is the distance from the point on the ground to the building, which is 40 meters.\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(angle) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\n\nWe are given the angle of elevation, which is 53 degrees. So, we can plug in the values:\n\ntan(53) = (25 + h) / 40\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\ntan(53) ≈ 1.33 = (25 + h) / 40\n\nMultiply both sides by 40:\n\n40 * 1.33 ≈ 25 + h\n\n53.2 ≈ 25 + h\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\n53.2 - 25 = h\n\nh ≈ 28.2\n\nThe height of the flagpole is approximately 28.2 meters."
