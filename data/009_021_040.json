    "message_1": "Sure! Here's an example of a problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA square image has a width and height of 256 pixels. We want to apply a 2D Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of 2 pixels to the image using partial differential equations. Write the partial differential equation for the Gaussian filter and solve it numerically using an explicit method. Assume that the boundary conditions are periodic. Finally, compare the resulting filtered image to the original image and discuss the effects of the filter.",
    "message_2": "To apply a 2D Gaussian filter to the image, we first need to define the Gaussian function. The 2D Gaussian function is given by:\n\nG(x, y) = (1 / (2 * π * σ^2)) * exp(-(x^2 + y^2) / (2 * σ^2))\n\nwhere σ is the standard deviation (2 pixels in this case).\n\nNow, we need to write the partial differential equation (PDE) for the Gaussian filter. The PDE for the Gaussian filter is the heat equation:\n\n∂u(x, y, t) / ∂t = D * (∂^2u(x, y, t) / ∂x^2 + ∂^2u(x, y, t) / ∂y^2)\n\nwhere u(x, y, t) is the image intensity at position (x, y) and time t, and D is the diffusion coefficient. In this case, D = σ^2 / 2.\n\nTo solve this PDE numerically using an explicit method, we can use the Forward Euler method. The discretized version of the PDE is:\n\nu(x, y, t + Δt) = u(x, y, t) + Δt * D * (u(x + Δx, y, t) - 2 * u(x, y, t) + u(x - Δx, y, t) + u(x, y + Δy, t) - 2 * u(x, y, t) + u(x, y - Δy, t)) / (Δx * Δy)\n\nWe can now apply this equation iteratively to the image, taking care to handle the periodic boundary conditions. To do this, when updating the pixel values at the edges of the image, we can wrap around to the opposite edge.\n\nAfter applying the filter for a sufficient number of iterations, we can compare the filtered image to the original image. The Gaussian filter will have the effect of smoothing the image, reducing high-frequency noise and preserving the low-frequency features. This can be useful for preprocessing images for further analysis or for reducing the impact of noise on subsequent processing steps."
