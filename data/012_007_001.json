    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow in this network, we will use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will iteratively find augmenting paths from the source $S$ to the sink $T$ and update the flow along these paths until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Initialize the flow in each edge to 0.\n\n2. Find an augmenting path from $S$ to $T$:\n\n   Path 1: $S \\to A \\to C \\to T$\n\n   The bottleneck capacity of this path is the minimum capacity of its edges, which is 10. Update the flow along this path by adding the bottleneck capacity to the flow in each edge.\n\n3. Find another augmenting path from $S$ to $T$:\n\n   Path 2: $S \\to A \\to B \\to D \\to T$\n\n   The bottleneck capacity of this path is 5. Update the flow along this path by adding the bottleneck capacity to the flow in each edge.\n\n4. Find another augmenting path from $S$ to $T$:\n\n   Path 3: $S \\to A \\to C \\to D \\to T$\n\n   The bottleneck capacity of this path is 5. Update the flow along this path by adding the bottleneck capacity to the flow in each edge.\n\n5. No more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nThe maximum flow is the sum of the flow in the edges leaving the source $S$, which is 20. Therefore, the maximum flow that can be sent from source vertex $S$ to sink vertex $T$ is 20 units."
