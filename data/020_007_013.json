    "message_1": "A company needs to transport 500 units of a product to a distant location using trucks of different capacities. The available trucks can carry 50, 75, and 100 units at a time. What is the minimum number of truckloads required to transport all the products and in what proportions should each truck be used to minimize the cost? Assume the cost of using each truck is proportional to the number of truckloads needed.",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z be the number of truckloads for trucks with capacities of 50, 75, and 100 units, respectively. We want to minimize the total number of truckloads (x + y + z) while satisfying the constraint that the total capacity is at least 500 units:\n\n50x + 75y + 100z >= 500\n\nWe can start by trying to find the minimum number of 100-unit trucks needed. If we use 5 of them, we can transport all 500 units. However, we should check if using smaller trucks can reduce the total number of truckloads.\n\nIf we use 1 truck with a capacity of 100 units, we still need to transport 400 units. We can use 75-unit trucks to transport 375 units with 5 truckloads (5 * 75 = 375). This leaves us with 25 units, which can be transported by a 50-unit truck. So, we have a total of 1 (100-unit) + 5 (75-unit) + 1 (50-unit) = 7 truckloads.\n\nNow, let's see if we can reduce the number of truckloads further by not using any 100-unit trucks. We can use 6 trucks with a capacity of 75 units to transport 450 units (6 * 75 = 450). This leaves us with 50 units, which can be transported by a 50-unit truck. So, we have a total of 6 (75-unit) + 1 (50-unit) = 7 truckloads.\n\nThus, the minimum number of truckloads required is 7. There are two possible ways to achieve this:\n\n1. Use 1 truck with a capacity of 100 units, 5 trucks with a capacity of 75 units, and 1 truck with a capacity of 50 units.\n2. Use 6 trucks with a capacity of 75 units and 1 truck with a capacity of 50 units.\n\nSince the cost is proportional to the number of truckloads, both options will have the same cost."
