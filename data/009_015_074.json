    "message_1": "A substance has a half-life of 10 days. If you start with 100 grams of the substance, how much will remain after 30 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the half-life formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 100 grams, the time elapsed is 30 days, and the half-life is 10 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 100 * (1/2)^(30/10)\nFinal amount = 100 * (1/2)^3\nFinal amount = 100 * (1/8)\nFinal amount = 12.5 grams\n\nSo, after 30 days, 12.5 grams of the substance will remain."
