    "message_1": "A company sells three different types of cars, and their sales follow a Markov chain. They sell 30% of type A, 40% of type B, and 30% of type C. If they sell 50 cars today, how many of each type can we expect them to sell tomorrow?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the expected number of each type of car sold tomorrow. We can do this by multiplying the probability of selling each type of car by the total number of cars sold today.\n\nExpected number of type A cars sold tomorrow = 0.3 * 50 = 15\nExpected number of type B cars sold tomorrow = 0.4 * 50 = 20\nExpected number of type C cars sold tomorrow = 0.3 * 50 = 15\n\nSo, we can expect the company to sell 15 type A cars, 20 type B cars, and 15 type C cars tomorrow."
