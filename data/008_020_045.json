    "message_2": "I will use the Gaussian elimination method to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nFirst, I will write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n| 2  3  4 | 5\n| 3  5 -2 | 7\n| 4 -1  2 | 1\n\nNext, I will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 3:\n\n| 4 -1  2 | 1\n| 3  5 -2 | 7\n| 2  3  4 | 5\n\n2. Multiply Row 1 by 1/4:\n\n| 1 -1/4  1/2 | 1/4\n| 3  5   -2   | 7\n| 2  3    4   | 5\n\n3. Replace Row 2 with Row 2 - 3*Row 1 and Row 3 with Row 3 - 2*Row 1:\n\n|  1  -1/4  1/2  |  1/4\n|  0  19/4 -7/2  | 25/4\n|  0  11/2  3    |  9/2\n\n4. Multiply Row 2 by 4/19:\n\n|  1  -1/4  1/2  |  1/4\n|  0   1   -14/19| 10/19\n|  0  11/2  3    |  9/2\n\n5. Replace Row 1 with Row 1 + 1/4*Row 2 and Row 3 with Row 3 - 11/2*Row 2:\n\n|  1   0   3/4  |  3/4\n|  0   1  -14/19| 10/19\n|  0   0   97/19|  7/19\n\n6. Multiply Row 3 by 19/97:\n\n|  1   0   3/4  |  3/4\n|  0   1  -14/19| 10/19\n|  0   0    1   |  7/97\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form, and we can perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = 7/97\n\ny = 10/19 + 14/19 * z = 10/19 + 14/19 * (7/97) = 10/19 + 98/97 = (210 + 98) / 97 = 308/97\n\nx = 3/4 - 3/4 * z - 1/4 * y = 3/4 - 3/4 * (7/97) - 1/4 * (308/97) = (72 - 21 - 77) / 97 = -26/97\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -26/97\ny = 308/97\nz = 7/97"
