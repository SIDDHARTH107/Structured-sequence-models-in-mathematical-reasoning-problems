    "message_2": "To find the number of customers likely to book a flight and hotel package, we can multiply the total number of customers by the percentage that book the package.\n\n400 customers * 70% = 400 * 0.7 = 280 customers\n\nSo, 280 customers are likely to book a flight and hotel package for their trip."
