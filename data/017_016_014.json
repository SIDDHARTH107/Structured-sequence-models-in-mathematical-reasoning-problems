    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince 27 = 3^3, we know that G is a p-group with p = 3. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, satisfies:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides the order of G, which is 27.\n\nThe only possibility for n_3 is 1, which means that there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G, and this subgroup must be normal.\n\nLet P be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since P is normal and has order 27, it must be equal to G itself. Now, we know that G is a group of order 27 and has a normal subgroup of order 27.\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C27 (cyclic group of order 27)\n2. C9 × C3 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 9 and 3)\n3. C3 × C3 × C3 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3, 3, and 3)\n\nWe can rule out the third possibility because the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 3 would have three elements of order 3, but G has only one element of order 3 (since it is a 3-group).\n\nNow, let's consider the second possibility. If G is isomorphic to C9 × C3, then G would have an element of order 9 and an element of order 3. However, since G is a 3-group, all its non-identity elements must have orders that are powers of 3. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to C9 × C3.\n\nThus, the only remaining possibility is that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27. This means that G has one element of order 27, which generates the entire group, and the other elements have orders that are divisors of 27 (i.e., 1, 3, and 9)."
