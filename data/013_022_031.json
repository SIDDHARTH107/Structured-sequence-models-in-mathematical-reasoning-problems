    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player 1 is given a pot of $100 and must decide how much to keep and how much to give to Player 2. If Player 1 keeps $70 and gives $30 to Player 2, what is the minimum amount of money Player 2 would need to receive to make the game a fair split, according to the Nash bargaining solution?",
    "message_2": "The Nash bargaining solution aims to find a fair split between two players in a bargaining situation. In this case, the fair split would be when both players receive an equal amount of money from the pot of $100.\n\nTo make the game a fair split according to the Nash bargaining solution, Player 2 would need to receive $50, and Player 1 would also keep $50. This way, both players receive an equal share of the pot, and the game is considered a fair split."
