    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct groups of order 30 that are isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30, we need to consider the possible structures of groups of order 30.\n\nA group of order 30 has the form G = p_1^e_1 * p_2^e_2, where p_1 and p_2 are distinct prime factors of 30, and e_1 and e_2 are their respective exponents. In this case, we have 30 = 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1.\n\n1. Cyclic group C30:\nThere is only one cyclic group of order 30, which is generated by an element of order 30. This group is isomorphic to C30.\n\n2. Dihedral group D15:\nThe dihedral group D15 has order 2 * 15 = 30. It is the group of symmetries of a regular 15-gon, including rotations and reflections. There is only one dihedral group of order 30, and it is isomorphic to D15.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 30:\nThere is only one non-abelian group of order 30, which is the semidirect product of C5 and C6. This group is not isomorphic to C30 or D15, as it is non-abelian, while both C30 and D15 are abelian.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 2 distinct groups of order 30 that are isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30 or the dihedral group D15."
