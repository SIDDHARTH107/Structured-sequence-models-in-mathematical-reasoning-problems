    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of handshakes needed for at least 3 people to shake hands with each other, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. \n\nLet's first consider the worst-case scenario, where no 3 people shake hands with each other. In this case, each person can shake hands with at most 2 other people. So, we can have the following handshakes:\n\n1-2, 1-3, 2-3, 4-5, 4-6, and 5-6.\n\nNow, if we add one more handshake, it's guaranteed that at least 3 people will shake hands with each other. For example, if person 1 shakes hands with person 4, then persons 1, 2, and 3 all shake hands with each other.\n\nSo, the minimum number of handshakes needed is 7."
