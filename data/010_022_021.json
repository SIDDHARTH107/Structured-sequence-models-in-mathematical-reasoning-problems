A cylindrical hole with a radius of 3 cm is drilled straight through the center of the cube along one of its diagonals. What is the shortest distance between two opposite corners of the block after the hole is drilled?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the length of the diagonal of the cube. We can use the Pythagorean theorem in 3D, which states that the length of the diagonal (D) can be found using the formula:\n\nD = √(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the cube. Since all sides are equal in length (10 cm), we have:\n\nD = √(10^2 + 10^2 + 10^2) = √(100 + 100 + 100) = √300 ≈ 17.32 cm\n\nNow, let's find the length of the cylinder that is drilled through the cube. Since the cylinder is drilled along the diagonal, its length will be equal to the length of the diagonal, which is 17.32 cm.\n\nNext, we need to find the shortest distance between two opposite corners of the block after the hole is drilled. To do this, we can imagine a straight line connecting the two opposite corners of the cube, passing through the center of the cylindrical hole. This line will be tangent to the cylinder, and the shortest distance will be the length of this line minus the diameter of the cylinder.\n\nThe diameter of the cylinder is twice the radius, so it is 2 * 3 cm = 6 cm.\n\nFinally, we can find the shortest distance between the two opposite corners by subtracting the diameter of the cylinder from the length of the diagonal:\n\nShortest distance = D - diameter = 17.32 cm - 6 cm = 11.32 cm\n\nSo, the shortest distance between two opposite corners of the block after the hole is drilled is 11.32 cm."
