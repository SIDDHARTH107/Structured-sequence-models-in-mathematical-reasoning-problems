    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the LU decomposition method, we first need to decompose the given matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. The system of equations can be represented as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B is the matrix of constants.\n\nMatrix A:\n| 2  3 -1 |\n| 3  4  2 |\n| 1  2 -1 |\n\nMatrix B:\n| 1 |\n| 5 |\n| 0 |\n\nStep 1: LU Decomposition\nWe will use Doolittle's method for LU decomposition, which states that the diagonal elements of L are 1.\n\n1. First row of U is the same as the first row of A:\nU = | 2  3 -1 |\n    | 0  0  0 |\n    | 0  0  0 |\n\n2. First column of L (excluding the diagonal) is the first column of A divided by the pivot (2):\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 3/2 0  0 |\n    | 1/2 0  0 |\n\n3. To find the second row of U and the second column of L, we perform the following operations:\n- Subtract (3/2) times the first row of U from the second row of A to get the second row of U:\n  (3  4  2) - (3/2) * (2  3 -1) = (0 1/2 7/2)\n- Divide the second element of the second row of A by the pivot (1/2) to get the second element of the second column of L:\n  4 / (1/2) = 8\n\nSo now we have:\nU = | 2  3 -1 |\n    | 0 1/2 7/2 |\n    | 0  0  0 |\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 3/2 8  0 |\n    | 1/2 0  0 |\n\n4. Finally, subtract (1/2) times the first row of U from the third row of A to get the third row of U:\n  (1  2 -1) - (1/2) * (2  3 -1) = (0 1/2 0)\n\nAnd divide the second element of the third row of A by the pivot (1/2) to get the third element of the second column of L:\n  2 / (1/2) = 4\n\nNow we have:\nU = | 2  3 -1 |\n    | 0 1/2 7/2 |\n    | 0 1/2  0 |\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 3/2 8  0 |\n    | 1/2 4  0 |\n\nStep 2: Solve the system L * Y = B for Y\n| 1  0  0 | | y1 |   | 1 |\n| 3/2 8  0 | | y2 | = | 5 |\n| 1/2 4  0 | | y3 |   | 0 |\n\n1. y1 = 1\n2. y2 = (5 - 3/2 * y1) / 8 = (5 - 3/2) / 8 = 1/2\n3. y3 = (0 - 1/2 * y1 - 4 * y2) / 0 = Undefined\n\nSince the last equation results in an undefined value, the given system of linear equations has no unique solution using the LU decomposition method."
