    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 126 and 84 using the Euclidean algorithm, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (126) by the smaller number (84) and find the remainder.\n   126 รท 84 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 42.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (126) with the smaller number (84) and the smaller number with the remainder (42) from the previous step, and repeat the process.\n   84 รท 42 = 2 (quotient) with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we have reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 42. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of 126 and 84 is 42."
