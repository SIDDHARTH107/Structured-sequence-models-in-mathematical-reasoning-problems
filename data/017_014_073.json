    "message_2": "Let's first find the Sylow subgroups of G. Since the order of G is 20 = 2^2 * 5, by the Sylow theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 4 and a Sylow 5-subgroup Q of order 5.\n\nWe are given that G has exactly 4 subgroups of order 5. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is that there are 4 Sylow 5-subgroups. Since each of these subgroups has 4 non-identity elements, and they must all be distinct (otherwise, the subgroups would not be distinct), we have a total of 4 * 4 = 16 non-identity elements of order 5 in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is that there is 1 Sylow 2-subgroup, which means that it is normal in G. Let P be this normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4.\n\nSince P is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of P and any of the Sylow 5-subgroups Q. Let φ: Q → Aut(P) be a homomorphism. Since the order of Q is 5, which is prime, Q is isomorphic to the cyclic group C5. The automorphism group Aut(P) is isomorphic to the symmetric group S3, as P is isomorphic to either C4 or C2 × C2.\n\nThere are three possibilities for φ:\n\n1. φ is the trivial homomorphism, in which case the semidirect product is the direct product, and G is isomorphic to the abelian group C4 × C5, which is isomorphic to C20.\n\n2. φ is an injective homomorphism, in which case the semidirect product is the dihedral group D10.\n\n3. φ is a nontrivial, non-injective homomorphism. In this case, the semidirect product is a non-abelian group of order 20 that is not isomorphic to D10.\n\nThus, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C20, D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20."
