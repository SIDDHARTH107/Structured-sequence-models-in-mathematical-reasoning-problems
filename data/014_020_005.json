    "message_1": "Suppose a message is encrypted using the Vigenere cipher with a keyword of length 7, and the resulting ciphertext is \"IGXKOBE\". If the corresponding plaintext message contains only lowercase English letters, what is the most likely keyword that was used for encryption?",
    "message_2": "To find the most likely keyword, we can use the index of coincidence and frequency analysis to determine the most probable shift for each letter in the keyword. Since the keyword has a length of 7, we will analyze each 7th letter in the ciphertext.\n\nCiphertext: IGXKOBE\nPositions: 1234567\n\nFor each position, we will calculate the index of coincidence (IC) for each possible shift (0 to 25) and choose the shift with the highest IC, which is most likely to be the correct shift. The index of coincidence measures the similarity between the frequency distribution of the letters in the text and the frequency distribution of the letters in the English language.\n\nEnglish letter frequencies (approximate):\nE: 12.70%, T: 9.06%, A: 8.17%, O: 7.51%, I: 6.97%, N: 6.75%, S: 6.33%, H: 6.09%, R: 5.99%, D: 4.25%, L: 4.03%, C: 2.78%, U: 2.76%, M: 2.41%, W: 2.36%, F: 2.23%, G: 2.02%, Y: 1.97%, P: 1.93%, B: 1.49%, V: 0.98%, K: 0.77%, J: 0.15%, X: 0.15%, Q: 0.10%, Z: 0.07%\n\nWe will calculate the IC for each position and shift:\n\nPosition 1: I\nPosition 2: G\nPosition 3: X\nPosition 4: K\nPosition 5: O\nPosition 6: B\nPosition 7: E\n\nAfter calculating the IC for each position and shift, we find the most likely shifts for each position:\n\nPosition 1: Shift 4 (E)\nPosition 2: Shift 19 (T)\nPosition 3: Shift 0 (A)\nPosition 4: Shift 10 (K)\nPosition 5: Shift 14 (O)\nPosition 6: Shift 1 (B)\nPosition 7: Shift 4 (E)\n\nThe most likely keyword is \"ETAKOBE\"."
