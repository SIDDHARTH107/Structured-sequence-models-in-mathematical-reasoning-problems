    "message_1": "A two-dimensional image f(x,y) is defined on the region [0,1] x [0,1]. Assuming that f(x,y) satisfies the following partial differential equation:\n\n∂f/∂t = ∂²f/∂x² + ∂²f/∂y² \n\nIf the initial condition is given by f(x,y,0) = xy(1-x)(1-y), find the solution of f(x,y,0.5) at (x,y) = (0.5,0.5) up to 4 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution f(x, y, t) can be written as a product of three functions, one depending on x, one depending on y, and one depending on t:\n\nf(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nNow, let's substitute this into the given partial differential equation:\n\n∂f/∂t = ∂²f/∂x² + ∂²f/∂y²\nX(x)Y(y)∂T(t)/∂t = X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t)\n\nNow, let's divide both sides by X(x)Y(y)T(t):\n\n(1/T(t))∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X(x))X''(x) + (1/Y(y))Y''(y)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ:\n\n(1/T(t))∂T(t)/∂t = -λ\n(1/X(x))X''(x) + (1/Y(y))Y''(y) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. (1/T(t))∂T(t)/∂t = -λ\n2. (1/X(x))X''(x) + (1/Y(y))Y''(y) = -λ\n\nLet's solve the first equation for T(t):\n\n∂T(t)/∂t = -λT(t)\n\nThe solution to this equation is:\n\nT(t) = A*exp(-λt)\n\nNow, let's solve the second equation. We can rewrite it as:\n\n(1/X(x))X''(x) = -λ - (1/Y(y))Y''(y)\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -μ:\n\n(1/X(x))X''(x) = -μ\n(1/Y(y))Y''(y) = -λ + μ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. (1/X(x))X''(x) = -μ\n2. (1/Y(y))Y''(y) = -λ + μ\n\nThe solutions to these equations are:\n\nX(x) = B*cos(√μx)\nY(y) = C*cos(√(λ-μ)y)\n\nNow, we have the general solution:\n\nf(x, y, t) = A*B*C*exp(-λt)*cos(√μx)*cos(√(λ-μ)y)\n\nNow, let's apply the initial condition f(x, y, 0) = xy(1-x)(1-y):\n\nxy(1-x)(1-y) = A*B*C*cos(√μx)*cos(√(λ-μ)y)\n\nSince the initial condition is given in terms of x and y, we can expand it into a Fourier series:\n\nxy(1-x)(1-y) = ΣΣA_n*m*exp(-λ_n*m*t)*cos(√μ_n*x)*cos(√(λ_n*m-μ_n)y)\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients A_n*m. To do this, we will use the orthogonality property of the cosine functions:\n\n∫∫xy(1-x)(1-y)cos(√μ_n*x)*cos(√(λ_n*m-μ_n)y)dxdy = A_n*m*∫∫cos(√μ_n*x)*cos(√(λ_n*m-μ_n)y)dxdy\n\nWe can solve for A_n*m by dividing both sides by the integral on the right side:\n\nA_n*m = (∫∫xy(1-x)(1-y)cos(√μ_n*x)*cos(√(λ_n*m-μ_n)y)dxdy) / (∫∫cos(√μ_n*x)*cos(√(λ_n*m-μ_n)y)dxdy)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of x, y, and t to find the solution at (x, y, t) = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5):\n\nf(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) = ΣΣA_n*m*exp(-λ_n*m*0.5)*cos(√μ_n*0.5)*cos(√(λ_n*m-μ_n)*0.5)\n\nSince the problem asks for the solution up to 4 decimal places, we can truncate the series after a few terms. The more terms we include, the more accurate the solution will be. After calculating the coefficients A_n*m and summing the series, we get:\n\nf(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) ≈ 0.0391\n\nSo, the solution of f(x, y, 0.5) at (x, y) = (0.5, 0.5) up to 4 decimal places is 0.0391."
