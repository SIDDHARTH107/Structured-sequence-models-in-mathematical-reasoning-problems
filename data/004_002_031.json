    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function as x approaches 2, we first try to simplify the function. We can factor the numerator:\n\nx^2 + x - 6 = (x - 2)(x + 3)\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\nf(x) = ((x - 2)(x + 3))/(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the (x - 2) terms:\n\nf(x) = x + 3\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 2:\n\nlim (x -> 2) (x + 3) = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the limit of the function as x approaches 2 is 5."
