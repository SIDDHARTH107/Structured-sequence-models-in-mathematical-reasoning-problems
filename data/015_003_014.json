    "message_2": "The logistic map is defined by the following recursive formula:\n\nx(n+1) = r * x(n) * (1 - x(n))\n\nwhere x(n) is the value at the nth iteration, r is the parameter, and x0 is the initial value.\n\nGiven r = 3.5 and x0 = 0.2, we can calculate the value at the 5th iteration as follows:\n\nx(1) = 3.5 * 0.2 * (1 - 0.2) = 0.56\nx(2) = 3.5 * 0.56 * (1 - 0.56) ≈ 1.0784\nx(3) = 3.5 * 1.0784 * (1 - 1.0784) ≈ -0.3892\nx(4) = 3.5 * (-0.3892) * (1 - (-0.3892)) ≈ -0.8391\nx(5) = 3.5 * (-0.8391) * (1 - (-0.8391)) ≈ 2.4585\n\nThe value of the logistic map at the 5th iteration when r = 3.5 and x0 = 0.2 is approximately 2.4585."
