    "message_2": "The probability that a point randomly started inside the unit square is also inside the Barnsley fern cannot be directly calculated using the given information. The Barnsley fern is a fractal created by iteratively applying the given transformations to an initial point. The probabilities associated with each transformation determine the likelihood of that transformation being applied at each step.\n\nTo estimate the probability that a point inside the unit square is also inside the Barnsley fern, one would need to generate the fern using a large number of iterations and then calculate the proportion of points that fall within the unit square. This would give an approximation of the probability, but it would not be an exact value."
