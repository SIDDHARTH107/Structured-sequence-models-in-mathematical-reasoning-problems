    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the lateral surface area and the base area, and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the lateral surface area of a cone is:\nLateral Surface Area = π * r * l\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nThe formula for the base area of a cone is:\nBase Area = π * r^2\n\nPlugging in the given values, we have:\n\nLateral Surface Area = π * 5 cm * 10 cm = 50π cm²\nBase Area = π * (5 cm)^2 = 25π cm²\n\nNow, we add the lateral surface area and the base area to find the total surface area:\n\nTotal Surface Area = Lateral Surface Area + Base Area\nTotal Surface Area = 50π cm² + 25π cm² = 75π cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cone is 75π cm²."
