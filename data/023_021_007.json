    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a square wave can be represented as a sum of its odd harmonics. For a square wave with a frequency of f_0 = 2 Hz and an amplitude of A = 5 V, the Fourier series representation is given by:\n\nx(t) = (4A/π) * (sin(2πf_0t) / 1 + sin(2π(3f_0)t) / 3 + sin(2π(5f_0)t) / 5 + ...)\n\nIn this case, f_0 = 2 Hz and A = 5 V, so the Fourier series representation is:\n\nx(t) = (20/π) * (sin(4πt) + sin(12πt) / 3 + sin(20πt) / 5 + ...)\n\nThe Fourier transform of this time-domain signal is a series of impulses in the frequency domain, located at the odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency (2 Hz) and scaled by the coefficients in the Fourier series:\n\nX(f) = (20/π) * (δ(f - 2) + (1/3)δ(f - 6) + (1/5)δ(f - 10) + ...)\n\nHere, δ(f) represents the Dirac delta function, which is an impulse at the specified frequency. The Fourier transform of the given square wave is a series of impulses at the odd harmonics (2 Hz, 6 Hz, 10 Hz, ...) with amplitudes scaled by the coefficients (20/π, 20/(3π), 20/(5π), ...)."
