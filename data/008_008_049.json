Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time, while each unit of product B requires 1 hour of labor and 2 hours of machine time. The company has 480 hours of labor available and 600 hours of machine time available. If the profit on each unit of A is $5 and each unit of B is $3, how many units of each product should be produced to maximize profit?\n\nWrite the problem in the form of a linear programming problem, using the matrix method to solve it. Then find the maximum profit for the company.",
    "message_2": "To write this problem as a linear programming problem, let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 3y, subject to the constraints:\n\n2x + y ≤ 480 (labor constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 600 (machine time constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints in matrix form as:\n\n| 2  1 | | x | ≤ | 480 |\n| 3  2 | | y | ≤ | 600 |\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region defined by the constraints. We can do this by finding the points where the constraints intersect:\n\n1. Intersection of labor constraint and x-axis (y = 0): 2x = 480 => x = 240\n2. Intersection of labor constraint and y-axis (x = 0): y = 480\n3. Intersection of machine time constraint and x-axis (y = 0): 3x = 600 => x = 200\n4. Intersection of machine time constraint and y-axis (x = 0): 2y = 600 => y = 300\n5. Intersection of labor and machine time constraints: 2x + y = 480 and 3x + 2y = 600\n\nSolving the system of equations:\n\ny = 480 - 2x\n3x + 2(480 - 2x) = 600\n3x + 960 - 4x = 600\nx = 360\n\ny = 480 - 2(360) = -240 (not feasible since y ≥ 0)\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (240, 0), (200, 0), (0, 300), and (0, 480). We can now evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 5(0) + 3(0) = 0\nP(240, 0) = 5(240) + 3(0) = 1200\nP(200, 0) = 5(200) + 3(0) = 1000\nP(0, 300) = 5(0) + 3(300) = 900\nP(0, 480) = 5(0) + 3(480) = 1440\n\nThe maximum profit is $1440, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 480 units of product B."
