    "message_2": "There are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 48. Their structures are as follows:\n\n1. Cyclic group: C_48\nThis group has one element of order 48 and is generated by a single element. It is the simplest group of order 48.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_24 x C_2\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 24 and a cyclic group of order 2. It has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\n3. Direct product of three cyclic groups: C_8 x C_3 x C_2\nThis group is formed by taking the direct product of a cyclic group of order 8, a cyclic group of order 3, and a cyclic group of order 2. It has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8.\n\n4. Semidirect product of C_16 and C_3: C_16 ⋊ C_3\nThis group is formed by taking the semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 16 and a cyclic group of order 3. It has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 16.\n\n5. Semidirect product of C_8 x C_2 and C_3: (C_8 x C_2) ⋊ C_3\nThis group is formed by taking the semidirect product of the direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2 with a cyclic group of order 3. It has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8.\n\nThese are the 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 48 and their structures."
