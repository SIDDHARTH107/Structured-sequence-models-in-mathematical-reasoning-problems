    "message_2": "The Menger sponge is a fractal that is created by iteratively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the entire larger cube are removed. This process is repeated for the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nThe total area of each face in the Menger sponge can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = 6 * (20/27)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations and 6 represents the six faces of the initial cube.\n\nFor the 5th iteration, we have:\n\nArea = 6 * (20/27)^5\nArea ≈ 6 * 0.080383\nArea ≈ 0.482298\n\nSo, the total area of each face in the 5th iteration of the Menger sponge is approximately 0.482298 square units."
