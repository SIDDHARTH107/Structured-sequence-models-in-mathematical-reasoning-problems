    "message_2": "To determine whether a graph is connected or not, we can use the following fact:\n\nA graph with n vertices is connected if it has at least (n-1) edges and it is possible to travel from any vertex to any other vertex through a sequence of edges.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges. Since 10 > (7-1) = 6, the graph has enough edges to potentially be connected. However, we cannot definitively say that the graph is connected without knowing the specific arrangement of the edges.\n\nFor example, consider two cases:\n\nCase 1:\nThe graph has 6 edges forming a connected component with 6 vertices, and the 7th vertex is connected to the component with the remaining 4 edges. In this case, the graph is connected.\n\nCase 2:\nThe graph has 6 edges forming a connected component with 6 vertices, and the 7th vertex is connected to itself with the remaining 4 edges (forming loops). In this case, the graph is not connected, as there is no path from the 7th vertex to any other vertex.\n\nSo, without more information about the specific arrangement of the edges, we cannot determine whether the graph is connected or not."
