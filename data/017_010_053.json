    "message_2": "Let's consider a group G of order 10. We know that there are three possibilities for the structure of G: it can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10. \n\nFirst, let's write down the multiplication table for the cyclic group C10. The elements of C10 are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, and the operation is addition modulo 10. The multiplication table for C10 is:\n\n```\n+  | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n---+-------------------\n0  | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n1  | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0\n2  | 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n3  | 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2\n4  | 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3\n5  | 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4\n6  | 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5\n7  | 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n8  | 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n9  | 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n```\n\nNow let's consider the dihedral group D5. The elements of D5 are {r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, s0, s1, s2, s3, s4}, where r represents a rotation and s represents a reflection. The multiplication table for D5 is:\n\n```\n*  | r0 r1 r2 r3 r4 s0 s1 s2 s3 s4\n---+-------------------------------\nr0 | r0 r1 r2 r3 r4 s0 s1 s2 s3 s4\nr1 | r1 r2 r3 r4 r0 s1 s2 s3 s4 s0\nr2 | r2 r3 r4 r0 r1 s2 s3 s4 s0 s1\nr3 | r3 r4 r0 r1 r2 s3 s4 s0 s1 s2\nr4 | r4 r0 r1 r2 r3 s4 s0 s1 s2 s3\ns0 | s0 s1 s2 s3 s4 r0 r1 r2 r3 r4\ns1 | s1 s2 s3 s4 s0 r1 r2 r3 r4 r0\ns2 | s2 s3 s4 s0 s1 r2 r3 r4 r0 r1\ns3 | s3 s4 s0 s1 s2 r3 r4 r0 r1 r2\ns4 | s4 s0 s1 s2 s3 r4 r0 r1 r2 r3\n```\n\nFinally, let's consider the non-abelian group of order 10. This group can be represented as the semidirect product of Z5 and Z2, with elements {(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)}. The operation is defined as (a,b)*(c,d) = (a+(-1)^b*c mod 5, b+d mod 2). The multiplication table for this group is:\n\n```\n*  | (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1)\n---+---------------------------------------------------------\n(0,0)| (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1)\n(1,0)| (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (0,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (0,1)\n(2,0)| (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (0,0) (1,0) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (0,1) (1,1)\n(3,0)| (3,0) (4,0) (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,1) (4,1) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1)\n(4,0)| (4,0) (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,1) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1)\n(0,1)| (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0)\n(1,1)| (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (0,1) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (0,0)\n(2,1)| (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (0,1) (1,1) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (0,0) (1,0)\n(3,1)| (3,1) (4,1) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,0) (4,0) (0,0) (1,0) (2,0)\n(4,1)| (4,1) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,0) (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0)\n```\n\nNow we need to determine which of these groups is isomorphic to G. To do this, we can look at the properties of each group:\n\n1. C10 is abelian, meaning that the operation is commutative (a*b = b*a for all a, b in G).\n2. D5 is non-abelian and has a subgroup of order 5 (the rotations) and a subgroup of order 2 (the reflections).\n3. The non-abelian group of order 10 is also non-abelian, but it does not have a subgroup of order 2.\n\nIf G is abelian, then it must be isomorphic to C10. If G is non-abelian and has a subgroup of order 5 and a subgroup of order 2, then it must be isomorphic to D5. If G is non-abelian and does not have a subgroup of order 2, then it must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10.\n\nWithout more information about the properties of G, we cannot determine which of these groups it is isomorphic to."
