    "message_2": "To prove that a group of order 7 is cyclic, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of prime order is always cyclic.\n2. A group is cyclic if and only if it has a single generator.\n\nLet G be a group of order 7. Since 7 is a prime number, by fact 1, G is cyclic. Therefore, there exists an element g in G such that G = ⟨g⟩, where ⟨g⟩ denotes the subgroup generated by g.\n\nNow, let's show that G has a single generator. Suppose there exists another element h in G such that G = ⟨h⟩. Since G has order 7, both g and h must have order 7 (because the order of an element divides the order of the group, and the only divisors of 7 are 1 and 7, but the identity element has order 1).\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. Since the order of G is 7, the only possible orders for subgroups of G are 1 and 7. The only subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element. Since both g and h have order 7, their generated subgroups ⟨g⟩ and ⟨h⟩ must have order 7 as well.\n\nSince there is only one subgroup of order 7 (up to isomorphism), it must be the case that ⟨g⟩ = ⟨h⟩ = G. Therefore, G has a single generator, and by fact 2, G is cyclic.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 7 is cyclic."
