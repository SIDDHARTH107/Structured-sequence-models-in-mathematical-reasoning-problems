    "message_1": "I apologize, but Deontic logic is concerned with ethical matters rather than numerical problems. It is not a subtopic of mathematics, but rather a branch of philosophy. Therefore, I cannot provide you with a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to deontic logic.",
    "message_2": "That's completely understandable. If you have any mathematical problems or questions, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help you with those."
