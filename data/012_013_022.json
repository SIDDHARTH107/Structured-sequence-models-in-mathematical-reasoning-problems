Contract the edge BE: The graph becomes:\n\n```\n    A---B=C\n    | \\ | /\n    |  \\|/\n    D----E\n```\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of this graph is P(G/e)(k) = k(k-1)^3 - k(k-1)^2.\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial of the original graph using the formula P(G)(k) = P(G-e)(k) - P(G/e)(k):\n\nP(G)(k) = [k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)^3] - [k(k-1)^3 - k(k-1)^2]\nP(G)(k) = k(k-1)^4 - 2k(k-1)^3 + k(k-1)^2\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph is P(G)(k) = k(k-1)^2(k^2 - 3k + 2)."
