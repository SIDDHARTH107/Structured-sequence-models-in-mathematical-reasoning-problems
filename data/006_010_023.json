    "message_1": "What is the probability that at least 3 out of a group of 20 people, where 8 are male and 12 are female, will be affected by a certain disease known to affect 25% of males and 15% of females?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. First, we need to find the probability of each possible combination of affected people (e.g., 3 males and 0 females, 2 males and 1 female, etc.) and then sum up these probabilities.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of x successes in n trials, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nFirst, let's find the probabilities for each combination of affected males and females:\n\n1. 3 males affected, 0 females affected:\nP(3M, 0F) = C(8, 3) * (0.25)^3 * (0.75)^5 * C(12, 0) * (0.15)^0 * (0.85)^12\n\n2. 2 males affected, 1 female affected:\nP(2M, 1F) = C(8, 2) * (0.25)^2 * (0.75)^6 * C(12, 1) * (0.15)^1 * (0.85)^11\n\n3. 1 male affected, 2 females affected:\nP(1M, 2F) = C(8, 1) * (0.25)^1 * (0.75)^7 * C(12, 2) * (0.15)^2 * (0.85)^10\n\n4. 0 males affected, 3 females affected:\nP(0M, 3F) = C(8, 0) * (0.25)^0 * (0.75)^8 * C(12, 3) * (0.15)^3 * (0.85)^9\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each combination:\n\n1. P(3M, 0F) = 56 * 0.015625 * 0.133483 * 1 * 1 * 0.263597 = 0.031294\n2. P(2M, 1F) = 28 * 0.0625 * 0.178506 * 12 * 0.15 * 0.224771 = 0.107243\n3. P(1M, 2F) = 8 * 0.25 * 0.133483 * 66 * 0.0225 * 0.193710 = 0.128868\n4. P(0M, 3F) = 1 * 1 * 0.100113 * 220 * 0.003375 * 0.166373 = 0.012261\n\nFinally, we sum up these probabilities to find the probability of at least 3 people being affected:\n\nP(at least 3 affected) = P(3M, 0F) + P(2M, 1F) + P(1M, 2F) + P(0M, 3F) = 0.031294 + 0.107243 + 0.128868 + 0.012261 = 0.279666\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 out of the group of 20 people will be affected by the disease is approximately 27.97%."
