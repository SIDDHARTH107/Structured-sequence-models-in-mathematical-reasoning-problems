    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix, which consists of the partial derivatives of the functions with respect to x and y. Let F(x, y) = (f1(x, y), f2(x, y)) be the vector function representing the system of equations, where:\n\nf1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 4\nf2(x, y) = x - y - 1\n\nThe Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f1/∂x = 2x\n∂f1/∂y = 2y\n∂f2/∂x = 1\n∂f2/∂y = -1\n\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x   2y |\n          |  1   -1 |\n\nNow we can apply Newton's method. The iterative formula for Newton's method for systems of equations is:\n\n(x, y)_(k+1) = (x, y)_k - J(x, y)_k^(-1) * F(x, y)_k\n\nWe start with the initial guess (x0, y0) = (-2, 1). We will iterate until the solution converges to three decimal places.\n\nIteration 1:\nJ(-2, 1) = | -4  2 |\n           |  1 -1 |\n\nF(-2, 1) = (1, -2)\n\nTo find the inverse of the Jacobian matrix, we use the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix:\n\nJ^(-1) = (1/det(J)) * |  d  -b |\n                       | -c   a |\n\nwhere det(J) = ad - bc.\n\ndet(J(-2, 1)) = -4 - (-2) = -2\n\nJ^(-1)(-2, 1) = (-1/2) * | -1 -2 |\n                         | -1  -4 |\n\nNow we can compute the next approximation:\n\n(-2, 1) - J^(-1)(-2, 1) * F(-2, 1) = (-2, 1) - (-1/2) * (2, 2) = (-2 + 1, 1 + 1) = (-1, 2)\n\nIteration 2:\nJ(-1, 2) = | -2  4 |\n           |  1 -1 |\n\nF(-1, 2) = (1, 0)\n\nJ^(-1)(-1, 2) = (-1/(-2)) * | -1 -4 |\n                             | -1 -2 |\n\n(-1, 2) - J^(-1)(-1, 2) * F(-1, 2) = (-1, 2) - (1/2) * (0, 0) = (-1, 2)\n\nSince the solution did not change after the second iteration, we have converged to the solution (x*, y*) = (-1, 2) to three decimal places."
