    "message_2": "In classical logic, the truth value of q would be false since p OR q is false and p is true. However, in intuitionistic logic, we cannot simply conclude that q is false. Intuitionistic logic does not allow for the law of excluded middle, which states that a proposition is either true or false. Instead, intuitionistic logic requires a constructive proof for a statement to be considered true.\n\nIn this case, we do not have enough information to constructively prove that q is false. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of q in intuitionistic logic based on the given information."
