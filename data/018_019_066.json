The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 5, 7}\nB = {1, 2, 3}\nIntersection of A and B = {1}\n\nNow, we find the elements that are in either A or B but not in their intersection:\n\nA △ B = {2, 3, 5, 7}\n\nNext, we find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) and C:\n\n(A △ B) = {2, 3, 5, 7}\nC = {2, 3, 7, 8}\nIntersection of (A △ B) and C = {2, 3, 7}\n\nNow, we find the elements that are in either (A △ B) or C but not in their intersection:\n\n(A △ B) △ C = {5, 8}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference (A △ B) △ C is {5, 8}."
