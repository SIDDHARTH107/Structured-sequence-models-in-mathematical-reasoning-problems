    "message_2": "To find the Euler characteristic of X, we need to compute the alternating sum of the dimensions of its homology groups. Since f and g are Morse functions on X, we can use the Morse inequalities to relate the dimensions of the Morse complexes C_*(f) and C_*(g) to the dimensions of the homology groups of X.\n\nThe Morse inequalities state that for each index i, the dimension of the i-th homology group H_i(X) is less than or equal to the number of critical points of index i in the Morse function. Since f and g have no critical points of the same index, we can compute the Euler characteristic of X using the dimensions of C_*(f) and C_*(g).\n\nLet's denote the dimensions of the homology groups of X as a_i = dim H_i(X). Then the Euler characteristic of X is given by:\n\nχ(X) = Σ(-1)^i * a_i\n\nNow, let's denote the number of critical points of index i in the Morse functions f and g as b_i(f) and b_i(g), respectively. Then the dimensions of the Morse complexes C_*(f) and C_*(g) are given by:\n\ndim C_*(f) = Σ b_i(f) = 5\ndim C_*(g) = Σ b_i(g) = 7\n\nSince f and g have no critical points of the same index, we know that for each i, either b_i(f) = 0 or b_i(g) = 0. Therefore, we can write the Euler characteristic of X as:\n\nχ(X) = Σ(-1)^i * (b_i(f) + b_i(g))\n\nNow, we can use the dimensions of C_*(f) and C_*(g) to compute the Euler characteristic:\n\nχ(X) = Σ(-1)^i * (b_i(f) + b_i(g))\n     = Σ(-1)^i * b_i(f) + Σ(-1)^i * b_i(g)\n     = (Σ(-1)^i * b_i(f)) + (Σ(-1)^i * b_i(g))\n     = dim C_*(f) + dim C_*(g)\n     = 5 + 7\n     = 12\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of X is 12."
