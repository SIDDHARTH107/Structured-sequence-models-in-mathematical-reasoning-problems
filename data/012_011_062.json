    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph, the cut vertices are:\n- Vertex 2: Removing it disconnects vertices 1, 4, and 5 from vertex 3.\n- Vertex 5: Removing it disconnects vertices 4, 7, and 8 from vertices 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nThe bridges in the graph are:\n- Edge (1, 2): Removing it disconnects vertex 1 from the rest of the graph.\n- Edge (3, 6): Removing it disconnects vertex 6 from the rest of the graph.\n\nSo, the cut vertices are {2, 5} and the bridges are {(1, 2), (3, 6)}."
