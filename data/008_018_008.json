    "message_2": "To write the system of linear equations in block matrix form, we can represent it as AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 4 & 6 \\\\\n3 & 6 & 9 \\\\\n4 & 8 & 12 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nX = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nB = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n10 \\\\\n15 \\\\\n20 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we have the block matrix equation:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 4 & 6 \\\\\n3 & 6 & 9 \\\\\n4 & 8 & 12 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n10 \\\\\n15 \\\\\n20 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nBefore solving the system, we can check if the matrix A is singular (non-invertible) by calculating its determinant. If the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular, and the system may have no unique solution.\n\nThe determinant of A can be calculated using the following formula for a 3x3 matrix:\n\ndet(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n\nwhere a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, and i are the elements of the matrix A:\n\na = 2, b = 4, c = 6\nd = 3, e = 6, f = 9\ng = 4, h = 8, i = 12\n\ndet(A) = 2(6 * 12 - 9 * 8) - 4(3 * 12 - 9 * 4) + 6(3 * 8 - 6 * 4)\ndet(A) = 2(72 - 72) - 4(36 - 36) + 6(24 - 24)\ndet(A) = 0\n\nSince the determinant of A is zero, the matrix A is singular, and the system of linear equations does not have a unique solution. It could have either no solution or infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo determine if the system has no solution or infinitely many solutions, we can check if the augmented matrix [A | B] has any inconsistent rows (rows of the form [0 0 0 | k], where k â‰  0). If there are any inconsistent rows, the system has no solution; otherwise, it has infinitely many solutions.\n\nThe augmented matrix [A | B] is:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 4 & 6 & | & 10 \\\\\n3 & 6 & 9 & | & 15 \\\\\n4 & 8 & 12 & | & 20 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nWe can perform row operations to put the augmented matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Subtract 1.5 times the first row from the second row:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 4 & 6 & | & 10 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & | & 0 \\\\\n4 & 8 & 12 & | & 20 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n2. Subtract 2 times the first row from the third row:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 4 & 6 & | & 10 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & | & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & | & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nSince there are no inconsistent rows in the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix, the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. We cannot find a unique solution using block matrix operations."
