    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to write the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the vector of variables, and b is the vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |\n    | 2  8 14 |\n    | 3 14 30 |\n\nb = |  6  |\n    | 28  |\n    | 51  |\n\nNow, we need to decompose matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T, i.e., A = LL^T.\n\nL = | l11  0   0  |\n    | l21 l22  0  |\n    | l31 l32 l33 |\n\nL^T = | l11 l21 l31 |\n      |  0  l22 l32 |\n      |  0   0  l33 |\n\nUsing Cholesky decomposition, we find the elements of L:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(1) = 1\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 2 / 1 = 2\nl31 = a31 / l11 = 3 / 1 = 3\n\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(8 - 2^2) = sqrt(4) = 2\nl32 = (a32 - l21*l31) / l22 = (14 - 2*3) / 2 = 4\n\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(30 - 3^2 - 4^2) = sqrt(9) = 3\n\nSo, L = | 1  0  0 |\n        | 2  2  0 |\n        | 3  4  3 |\n\nNow, we solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n| 1  0  0 | | y1 |   |  6  |\n| 2  2  0 | | y2 | = | 28  |\n| 3  4  3 | | y3 |   | 51  |\n\ny1 = 6 / 1 = 6\ny2 = (28 - 2*y1) / 2 = (28 - 2*6) / 2 = 8\ny3 = (51 - 3*y1 - 4*y2) / 3 = (51 - 3*6 - 4*8) / 3 = 1\n\ny = |  6  |\n    |  8  |\n    |  1  |\n\nFinally, we solve the system L^Tx = y for x:\n\n| 1  2  3 | | x1 |   |  6  |\n| 0  2  4 | | x2 | = |  8  |\n| 0  0  3 | | x3 |   |  1  |\n\nx3 = 1 / 3 = 1/3\nx2 = (8 - 4*x3) / 2 = (8 - 4*(1/3)) / 2 = 2\nx1 = (6 - 2*x2 - 3*x3) / 1 = (6 - 2*2 - 3*(1/3)) = 1\n\nx = |  1  |\n    |  2  |\n    | 1/3 |\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 1/3."
