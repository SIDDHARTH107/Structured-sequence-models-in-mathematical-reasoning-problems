    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. Let's label the edges as follows:\n\n```\n   A --1-- B\n  /2      |3\n C --4-- D\n |5      |6\n E --7-- F\n```\n\nNow, let's apply the deletion-contraction algorithm on edge 1:\n\n- Deleting edge 1: The graph becomes a cycle of length 5 (A-C-D-F-E-A). The chromatic polynomial of a cycle of length 5 is P_5(k) = k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)(k-2).\n- Contracting edge 1: The graph becomes a cycle of length 4 (A-C-D-F-A). The chromatic polynomial of a cycle of length 4 is P_4(k) = k(k-1)^3 - k(k-1)(k-2).\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of G is the difference between the chromatic polynomials of the two graphs obtained after deleting and contracting edge 1:\n\nP(G, k) = P_5(k) - P_4(k) = k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)(k-2) - [k(k-1)^3 - k(k-1)(k-2)]\n        = k(k-1)^3[(k-1) - 1]\n        = k(k-1)^3(k-2)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of G is P(G, k) = k(k-1)^3(k-2)."
