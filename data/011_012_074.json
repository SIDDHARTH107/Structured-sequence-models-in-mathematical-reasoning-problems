    "message_2": "To find the number of students taking at least one of these subjects, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\nThe total number of students taking algebra or geometry is the sum of the number of students taking each subject minus the number of students taking both subjects (to avoid double-counting those students).\n\nSo, the number of students taking at least one of these subjects is:\n\n25 (algebra) + 20 (geometry) - 15 (both) = 30 students."
