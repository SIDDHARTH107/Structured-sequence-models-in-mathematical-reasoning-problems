    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it consists of elements that are unique to each set.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union (A ∪ B) and intersection (A ∩ B) of sets A and B.\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8} - {2, 4} = {1, 3, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's verify that the symmetric difference is a commutative operation. This means that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince union and intersection are commutative operations, we have:\n\nB ∪ A = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}\nB ∩ A = A ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nSo, B Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8} - {2, 4} = {1, 3, 6, 8}\n\nSince A Δ B = B Δ A, the symmetric difference is a commutative operation."
