In other words, a number x is a quadratic residue modulo 9 if there exists an integer y such that x ≡ y^2 (mod 9).\n\nWe will find all quadratic residues modulo 9 by checking the squares of the integers from 0 to 8 (inclusive) modulo 9.\n\n0^2 ≡ 0 (mod 9)\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 9)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 9)\n3^2 ≡ 0 (mod 9)\n4^2 ≡ 7 (mod 9)\n5^2 ≡ 7 (mod 9)\n6^2 ≡ 0 (mod 9)\n7^2 ≡ 4 (mod 9)\n8^2 ≡ 1 (mod 9)\n\nFrom the above calculations, we can see that the quadratic residues modulo 9 are {0, 1, 4, 7}."
