    "message_2": "To calculate the plane's northward and eastward velocity, we can use the trigonometric functions sine and cosine. The northward velocity (N) can be calculated using the sine function, and the eastward velocity (E) can be calculated using the cosine function. Here's the formula:\n\nN = speed × sin(bearing)\nE = speed × cos(bearing)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the bearing from degrees to radians, as trigonometric functions in most programming languages and calculators use radians. To convert from degrees to radians, we can use the formula:\n\nradians = (degrees × π) / 180\n\nSo, let's convert the bearing of 320° to radians:\n\nradians = (320 × π) / 180 ≈ 5.585\n\nNow, we can calculate the northward and eastward velocities:\n\nN = 400 × sin(5.585) ≈ 400 × (-0.6428) ≈ -257.12 km/h\nE = 400 × cos(5.585) ≈ 400 × 0.7660 ≈ 306.4 km/h\n\nSo, the plane's northward velocity is approximately -257.12 km/h (meaning it's actually going southward), and its eastward velocity is approximately 306.4 km/h."
