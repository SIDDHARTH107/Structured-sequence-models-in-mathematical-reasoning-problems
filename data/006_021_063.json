Historical data shows that hurricanes occur in that region 20% of the time in August. If an event is selected at random from the region, what is the chance that the event is a hurricane in the month of August?",
    "message_2": "The probability of a hurricane occurring in the particular region during the month of August is given as 20%. Therefore, if an event is selected at random from the region, the chance that the event is a hurricane in the month of August is also 20% or 0.20."
