    "message_1": "A company manufactures smartphones and the probability of a defective battery in any given phone is 0.03. If they produce 10,000 smartphones, what is the probability that exactly 300 of them will have a defective battery?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (defective batteries) in n trials (smartphones)\n- n is the number of trials (smartphones produced)\n- x is the number of successes (defective batteries)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (also written as C(n, x) or \"n choose x\")\n- p is the probability of success (defective battery)\n- q is the probability of failure (non-defective battery), which is 1 - p\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 10,000\n- x = 300\n- p = 0.03\n- q = 1 - p = 0.97\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(300) = C(10,000, 300) * (0.03^300) * (0.97^9700)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(10,000, 300), which is the number of combinations of 10,000 items taken 300 at a time. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, x) = n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nwhere \"!\" denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nC(10,000, 300) = 10,000! / (300! * 9700!)\n\nCalculating factorials for such large numbers can be difficult, so we can use an approximation like Stirling's formula or software tools to find the value. Using a calculator or software, we get:\n\nC(10,000, 300) ≈ 2.531 * 10^218\n\nNow we can plug this value back into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(300) ≈ (2.531 * 10^218) * (0.03^300) * (0.97^9700)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the probabilities, we get:\n\nP(300) ≈ 0.0237\n\nSo the probability that exactly 300 of the 10,000 smartphones will have a defective battery is approximately 0.0237 or 2.37%."
