    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we'll first simplify each term separately.\n\n1. log(base2) 16:\nSince 2^4 = 16, the logarithm base 2 of 16 is 4. So, log(base2) 16 = 4.\n\n2. 3 log(base2) 2:\nSince 2^1 = 2, the logarithm base 2 of 2 is 1. So, log(base2) 2 = 1.\nNow, we multiply this by 3: 3 * 1 = 3.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the original expression using the simplified terms:\n\n4 - 3\n\nSubtracting 3 from 4, we get:\n\n1\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is 1."
