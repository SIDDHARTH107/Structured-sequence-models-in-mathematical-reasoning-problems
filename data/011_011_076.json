    "message_2": "To partition the number 7 into non-negative integers using at most three parts, we can consider the following cases:\n\n1. Using one part: There is only one way to do this, which is 7 itself (7 = 7).\n\n2. Using two parts: We can have the following combinations:\n   - 6 + 1 = 7\n   - 5 + 2 = 7\n   - 4 + 3 = 7\n   There are 3 ways in this case.\n\n3. Using three parts: We can have the following combinations:\n   - 5 + 1 + 1 = 7\n   - 4 + 2 + 1 = 7\n   - 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 (order matters in this case)\n   - 3 + 3 + 1 = 7\n   - 3 + 2 + 2 = 7\n   - 3 + 1 + 3 = 7 (order matters in this case)\n   - 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 (order matters in this case)\n   There are 7 ways in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 1 (one-part) + 3 (two-parts) + 7 (three-parts) = 11 ways to partition the number 7 into non-negative integers using at most three parts."
