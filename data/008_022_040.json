    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n| 2  3  1 | 5 |\n| 1  2  1 | 6 |\n| 1  1  5 | 17|\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to find the solution:\n\nStep 1: Swap row 1 and row 2 to have a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n| 1  2  1 | 6 |\n| 2  3  1 | 5 |\n| 1  1  5 | 17|\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the 2 in the second row, first column, and the 1 in the third row, first column:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 2 * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - Row 1\n\n| 1  2  1 |  6 |\n| 0 -1 -1 | -7 |\n| 0 -1  4 | 11|\n\nStep 3: Swap row 2 and row 3 to have a non-zero value in the second row, second column:\n\n| 1  2  1 |  6 |\n| 0 -1  4 | 11|\n| 0 -1 -1 | -7|\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the -1 in the third row, second column:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - Row 2\n\n| 1  2  1 |  6 |\n| 0 -1  4 | 11|\n| 0  0  3 |  4|\n\nStep 5: Back-substitute to find the solution:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 / 3\nz = 4/3\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 * -1 + 4 * Row 3\ny = 3\n\nRow 1 = Row 1 - 2 * Row 2 - Row 3\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 3, and z = 4/3.\n\nNow, let's find the condition number of the coefficient matrix:\n\nThe condition number is the product of the matrix's norm and its inverse's norm. We'll use the infinity norm (maximum row sum) for this calculation.\n\nA = | 2  3  1 |\n    | 1  2  1 |\n    | 1  1  5 |\n\n||A||∞ = max(2+3+1, 1+2+1, 1+1+5) = max(6, 4, 7) = 7\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of A:\n\nA_inv = |  7 -3 -1 |\n        | -1  1  0 |\n        | -1  0  1 |\n\n||A_inv||∞ = max(7+3+1, 1+1+0, 1+0+1) = max(11, 2, 2) = 11\n\nFinally, the condition number is:\n\ncond(A) = ||A||∞ * ||A_inv||∞ = 7 * 11 = 77\n\nThe condition number of the coefficient matrix is 77. A condition number close to 1 indicates a well-conditioned matrix, while a large condition number indicates an ill-conditioned matrix. In this case, the condition number is not too large, so the matrix is considered to be moderately well-conditioned."
