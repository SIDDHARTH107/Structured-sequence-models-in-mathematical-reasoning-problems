The production process involves using two machines, and the daily production capacity of each machine is 500 and 400 hours respectively. The processing time for each unit of A, B, and C is 2, 3, and 1 hour respectively on machine 1, and 1, 1, and 2 hour respectively on machine 2. The company wants to determine the optimal daily production quantity of each product to maximize the total profit.\n\nWhat is the optimal daily production quantity of each product, and what is the maximum profit the company can earn per day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x, y, and z represent the daily production quantity of products A, B, and C, respectively. We want to maximize the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nP = 5x + 4y + 3z\n\nSubject to the constraints of the processing time on both machines:\n\n2x + 3y + z <= 500 (Machine 1)\nx + y + 2z <= 400 (Machine 2)\nx, y, z >= 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using the simplex method or graphical method. In this case, we'll use the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. 2x + 3y + z = 500\n2. x + y + 2z = 400\n\nWe can rewrite these equations in terms of x, y, and z:\n\n1. z = 500 - 2x - 3y\n2. z = 400 - x - y\n\nNow, we'll find the intersection points of these planes:\n\n1. Intersection of (1) and (2):\n500 - 2x - 3y = 400 - x - y\nx = 100 - 2y\n\nSubstitute x back into (2):\nz = 400 - (100 - 2y) - y\nz = 300 - y\n\nSo, the intersection point of (1) and (2) is (100 - 2y, y, 300 - y).\n\n2. Intersection of (1) with z = 0:\n500 - 2x - 3y = 0\n2x + 3y = 500\n\n3. Intersection of (2) with z = 0:\n400 - x - y = 0\nx + y = 400\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by considering the non-negativity constraint:\n\nx >= 0, y >= 0, z >= 0\n\nThe feasible region is a polyhedron with vertices at (0,0,0), (0,166.67,0), (200,0,0), (100,0,300), and (0,100,200).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0,0) = 5(0) + 4(0) + 3(0) = 0\n2. P(0,166.67,0) = 5(0) + 4(166.67) + 3(0) = 666.68\n3. P(200,0,0) = 5(200) + 4(0) + 3(0) = 1000\n4. P(100,0,300) = 5(100) + 4(0) + 3(300) = 1900\n5. P(0,100,200) = 5(0) + 4(100) + 3(200) = 1000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (100, 0, 300), with a profit of $1900 per day. Therefore, the optimal daily production quantity is 100 units of product A, 0 units of product B, and 300 units of product C, and the maximum profit the company can earn per day is $1900."
