    "message_2": "The volume form of a metric is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times the standard volume form. In this case, the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ is a diagonal matrix with elements $g_{11} = 1$, $g_{22} = 1$, and $g_{33} = 1$. The determinant of this matrix is simply the product of its diagonal elements:\n\n$\\det(g_{ij}) = g_{11}g_{22}g_{33} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n\nSince the determinant is 1, the square root of the determinant is also 1. The standard volume form in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is given by $dV = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$. Therefore, the volume form of the metric $g = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$ on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is:\n\n$\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dV = 1 \\cdot (dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz) = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$"
