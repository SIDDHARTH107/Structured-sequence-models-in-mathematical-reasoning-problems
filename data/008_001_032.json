    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[  2  -1   3 |  4 ]\n[  4   6  -2 |  2 ]\n[ -1   4  -7 | -6 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 3:\n```\n[ -1   4  -7 | -6 ]\n[  4   6  -2 |  2 ]\n[  2  -1   3 |  4 ]\n```\n\n2. Multiply Row 1 by -4 and add it to Row 2 to eliminate the x term in Row 2:\n```\n[ -1   4  -7 | -6 ]\n[  0  22 -26 | 26 ]\n[  2  -1   3 |  4 ]\n```\n\n3. Multiply Row 1 by 2 and add it to Row 3 to eliminate the x term in Row 3:\n```\n[ -1   4  -7 | -6 ]\n[  0  22 -26 | 26 ]\n[  0   7  -11 |  2 ]\n```\n\n4. Divide Row 2 by 22 to get a leading 1 in the y term:\n```\n[ -1   4  -7 | -6 ]\n[  0   1  -13/11 | 13/11 ]\n[  0   7  -11 |  2 ]\n```\n\n5. Multiply Row 2 by -7 and add it to Row 3 to eliminate the y term in Row 3:\n```\n[ -1   4  -7 | -6 ]\n[  0   1  -13/11 | 13/11 ]\n[  0   0  20/11 | -5/11 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. We can now perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. Divide Row 3 by 20/11 to get a leading 1 in the z term:\n```\n[ -1   4  -7 | -6 ]\n[  0   1  -13/11 | 13/11 ]\n[  0   0   1 | -1/4 ]\n```\n\n2. Multiply Row 3 by 13/11 and add it to Row 2 to eliminate the z term in Row 2:\n```\n[ -1   4  -7 | -6 ]\n[  0   1   0 | 3/4 ]\n[  0   0   1 | -1/4 ]\n```\n\n3. Multiply Row 3 by 7 and add it to Row 1 to eliminate the z term in Row 1:\n```\n[ -1   4   0 | -13/4 ]\n[  0   1   0 | 3/4 ]\n[  0   0   1 | -1/4 ]\n```\n\n4. Multiply Row 2 by -4 and add it to Row 1 to eliminate the y term in Row 1:\n```\n[ -1   0   0 | -4 ]\n[  0   1   0 | 3/4 ]\n[  0   0   1 | -1/4 ]\n```\n\n5. Multiply Row 1 by -1 to get a leading 1 in the x term:\n```\n[  1   0   0 | 4 ]\n[  0   1   0 | 3/4 ]\n[  0   0   1 | -1/4 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in reduced row-echelon form, and we can read the solution directly from the matrix:\n\nx = 4\ny = 3/4\nz = -1/4"
