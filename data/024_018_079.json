    "message_1": "Consider the surface given by the equation z = x^2 + y^2. Find the sectional curvature at the point (1,1,2) in the direction of the vector v = 3i + 4j + 2k.",
    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature, we first need to find the tangent plane to the surface at the given point (1,1,2). The gradient of the surface is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∇f(x,y) = (2x, 2y)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), the gradient is:\n\n∇f(1,1) = (2, 2)\n\nThe normal vector to the tangent plane is given by the gradient:\n\nn = (2, 2, -1)\n\nNow, we need to project the given vector v = (3, 4, 2) onto the tangent plane. To do this, we first find the component of v along the normal vector n:\n\nv_n = (v · n) / ||n||^2 * n = ((3, 4, 2) · (2, 2, -1)) / (2^2 + 2^2 + (-1)^2) * (2, 2, -1) = (6 + 8 - 2) / 9 * (2, 2, -1) = 12/9 * (2, 2, -1) = (8/3, 8/3, -4/3)\n\nNext, we subtract this component from v to get the projection of v onto the tangent plane:\n\nv_t = v - v_n = (3, 4, 2) - (8/3, 8/3, -4/3) = (-1/3, 4/3, 10/3)\n\nNow, we need to find the second fundamental form of the surface. The second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nII = (L M)\n     (M N)\n\nwhere L = ∇²f(x,y) · (1,0), M = ∇²f(x,y) · (0,1), and N = ∇²f(x,y) · (-1,-1). The Hessian matrix of the surface is given by the second partial derivatives:\n\n∇²f(x,y) = (2  0)\n           (0  2)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), the Hessian matrix is:\n\n∇²f(1,1) = (2  0)\n           (0  2)\n\nNow, we can find L, M, and N:\n\nL = (2  0) · (1,0) = 2\nM = (2  0) · (0,1) = 0\nN = (2  0) · (-1,-1) = 2\n\nSo, the second fundamental form is:\n\nII = (2 0)\n     (0 2)\n\nFinally, we can find the sectional curvature K by evaluating the second fundamental form on the projected vector v_t:\n\nK = (v_t · II · v_t) / ||v_t||^4 = ((-1/3, 4/3, 10/3) · (2 0) · (-1/3, 4/3, 10/3)) / ((-1/3)^2 + (4/3)^2 + (10/3)^2)^2 = (2*(-1/3)^2 + 2*(4/3)^2) / (1/9 + 16/9 + 100/9)^2 = (2/9 + 32/9) / (117/9)^2 = 34/117 / (117/9)^2 = 34/117 / (1296/81) = 34/117 * 81/1296 = 2/36\n\nThe sectional curvature at the point (1,1,2) in the direction of the vector v = 3i + 4j + 2k is K = 2/36 or 1/18."
