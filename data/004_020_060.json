    "message_1": "A 10 kg block is pushed along a horizontal plane by a constant force of 30 N for a distance of 5 meters. Find the work done by the force using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force using integration, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = ∫F(x)dx from x = 0 to x = 5\n\nSince the force is constant (30 N), the force function F(x) = 30 N. Now we can integrate this function over the given distance:\n\nWork = ∫(30)dx from x = 0 to x = 5\n\nWork = [30x] from x = 0 to x = 5\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nWork = (30 * 5) - (30 * 0)\n\nWork = 150 - 0\n\nWork = 150 J (Joules)\n\nSo, the work done by the force is 150 Joules."
