    "message_2": "To find the length of the curve given by y = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4, we need to use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2) * x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we need to find the square of the derivative and add 1:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = (3/2)^2 * x\n1 + (dy/dx)^2 = 1 + (9/4) * x\n\nNext, we need to find the square root of the expression:\n\n√(1 + (dy/dx)^2) = √(1 + (9/4) * x)\n\nNow, we can plug this expression into the arc length formula and evaluate the integral from x = 1 to x = 4:\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] √(1 + (9/4) * x) dx\n\nThis integral is not solvable using elementary functions. However, we can use numerical methods to approximate the value of the integral. Using a numerical integration method, such as Simpson's rule or a numerical integration calculator, we get:\n\nL ≈ 6.998\n\nTherefore, the length of the curve given by y = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4 is approximately 6.998."
