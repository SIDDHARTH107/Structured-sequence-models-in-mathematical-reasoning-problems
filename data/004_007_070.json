    "message_2": "First, we need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x). \n\nFor f(x) = sin(3x^2), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a composite function h(x) = f(g(x)), then the derivative h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nLet's find f'(x):\nf(x) = sin(3x^2)\nf'(x) = cos(3x^2) * d(3x^2)/dx (by the chain rule)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of the inner function, 3x^2:\nd(3x^2)/dx = 6x\n\nSo, f'(x) = cos(3x^2) * 6x\n\nNow, let's find g'(x):\ng(x) = 4x\ng'(x) = 4\n\nNow, we need to find (f(g(x)))'. Using the chain rule, we have:\n(f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nWe know that f'(x) = cos(3x^2) * 6x and g'(x) = 4. We need to find f'(g(x)):\nf'(g(x)) = cos(3(g(x))^2) * 6(g(x))\n\nNow, substitute g(x) = 4x:\nf'(g(x)) = cos(3(4x)^2) * 6(4x)\n\nNow, we can find (f(g(x)))':\n(f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n(f(g(x)))' = (cos(3(4x)^2) * 6(4x)) * 4\n\nFinally, we need to evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n(f(g(2)))' = cos(3(4*2)^2) * 6(4*2) * 4\n\nSimplify the expression:\n(f(g(2)))' = cos(3*256) * 48 * 4\n(f(g(2)))' = cos(768) * 192\n\nSo, the derivative (f(g(2)))' = cos(768) * 192."
