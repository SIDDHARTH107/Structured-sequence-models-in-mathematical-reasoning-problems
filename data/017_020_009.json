    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order of the group: 40 = 2^3 * 5^1\n2. Determine the possible group structures based on the prime factorization.\n\nFor the 2^3 part, there are three possible structures: C_8, C_4 x C_2, and C_2 x C_2 x C_2.\n\nFor the 5^1 part, there is only one possible structure: C_5.\n\n3. Combine the structures using the direct product.\n\nWe can combine the structures in the following ways:\n\n- C_8 x C_5\n- (C_4 x C_2) x C_5\n- (C_2 x C_2 x C_2) x C_5\n\n4. Check for isomorphisms.\n\nIn this case, all three groups are non-isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 40."
