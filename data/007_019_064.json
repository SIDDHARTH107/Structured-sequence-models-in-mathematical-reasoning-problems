    "message_2": "The Miller-Rabin primality test is a probabilistic test to determine if a number is a prime or not. It is based on the observation that if n is an odd prime, then for any integer a, 1 < a < n, either a^(n-1) is congruent to 1 (mod n) or there exists an integer j such that 0 ≤ j ≤ log2(n-1) and a^(2^j * (n-1)/2) is congruent to -1 (mod n).\n\nTo perform the Miller-Rabin primality test, we need to choose a set of random bases a. The more bases we choose, the higher the probability of the test being accurate. For this example, let's choose three random bases: a = 2, a = 3, and a = 7.\n\nNow, let's perform the test for each base:\n\n1. For a = 2:\n   n = 683, n-1 = 682, and log2(682) = 9.087\n   We can write 682 as 2^1 * 341.\n   Now, we compute 2^341 (mod 683) and 2^(2^0 * 341) (mod 683):\n   2^341 (mod 683) = 1\n   Since 2^341 is congruent to 1 (mod 683), we move on to the next base.\n\n2. For a = 3:\n   n = 683, n-1 = 682, and log2(682) = 9.087\n   We can write 682 as 2^1 * 341.\n   Now, we compute 3^341 (mod 683) and 3^(2^0 * 341) (mod 683):\n   3^341 (mod 683) = 1\n   Since 3^341 is congruent to 1 (mod 683), we move on to the next base.\n\n3. For a = 7:\n   n = 683, n-1 = 682, and log2(682) = 9.087\n   We can write 682 as 2^1 * 341.\n   Now, we compute 7^341 (mod 683) and 7^(2^0 * 341) (mod 683):\n   7^341 (mod 683) = 1\n   Since 7^341 is congruent to 1 (mod 683), we have checked all the bases.\n\nSince all the bases passed the test, we can say with high probability that 683 is a prime number. However, it's important to note that the Miller-Rabin primality test is a probabilistic test, and there's always a small chance of a false positive. In this case, though, 683 is indeed a prime number."
