    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and successively adding smaller equilateral triangles to its sides. After each iteration, the length of each side of the snowflake is multiplied by 4/3.\n\nLet's find the length of a side after the 4th iteration:\n\nInitial side length: 3 units\nAfter 1st iteration: 3 * (4/3) = 4 units\nAfter 2nd iteration: 4 * (4/3) = 16/3 units\nAfter 3rd iteration: (16/3) * (4/3) = 64/9 units\nAfter 4th iteration: (64/9) * (4/3) = 256/27 units\n\nNow, the Koch snowflake has 3 sides, so the perimeter after the 4th iteration is:\n\nPerimeter = 3 * (256/27) = 768/27 units"
