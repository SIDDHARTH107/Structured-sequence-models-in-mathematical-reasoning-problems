    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles. A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, each having a side length equal to the side length of the hexagon.\n\nThe side length of each equilateral triangle is 8 cm. To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (side² * √3) / 4\n\nArea of one equilateral triangle = (8² * √3) / 4 = (64 * √3) / 4 = 16√3 square centimeters\n\nSince there are 6 equilateral triangles in the hexagon, the total area of the hexagon is:\n\nArea of hexagon = 6 * (Area of one equilateral triangle) = 6 * (16√3) = 96√3 square centimeters"
