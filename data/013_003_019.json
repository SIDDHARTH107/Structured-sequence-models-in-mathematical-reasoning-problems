    "message_1": "Suppose two players play the ultimatum game with one player being the proposer and the other being the responder. The proposer is given a sum of $100 and proposes to split the sum with the responder in any way they choose. If the responder accepts the proposal, the sum is divided accordingly, but if they reject it, both players receive nothing. What is the optimal strategy for the proposer if the responder's minimum acceptable offer is $30?",
    "message_2": "If the responder's minimum acceptable offer is $30, the optimal strategy for the proposer would be to offer the responder exactly $30. This way, the proposer maximizes their own share of the sum ($70) while still ensuring that the responder accepts the offer, as it meets their minimum requirement. Offering any less than $30 would result in the responder rejecting the offer, and both players would receive nothing. Offering more than $30 would be unnecessary, as the responder would still accept the offer, but the proposer would receive a smaller share of the sum."
