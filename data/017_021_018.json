    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 48, we can use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible structures of these groups. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3^1. \n\nFirst, let's find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of the groups:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, the group is a direct product of these subgroups and is abelian, so we can disregard this case.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. The group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since there are two possible actions of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the Sylow 3-subgroup, there are two non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. The group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 2-subgroup. There are three possible actions of the Sylow 3-subgroup on the Sylow 2-subgroup, but one of them results in an abelian group. Thus, there are two non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, both Sylow subgroups have more than one possible conjugate. In this case, we can't determine the structure of the group directly, but we can use the fact that the total number of groups of order 48 is 10 (including abelian and non-abelian). Since we have already found 4 groups in the previous cases (1 abelian and 3 non-abelian), there must be 6 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 2 + 2 + 6 = 10 non-abelian groups of order 48. They differ in their structure based on the number of Sylow subgroups and the actions of these subgroups on each other, resulting in different semi-direct products and group structures."
