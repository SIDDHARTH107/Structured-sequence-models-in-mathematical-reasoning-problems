    "message_2": "To calculate the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to find the surface area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. In this case, the radius of the circular bases is 5 cm.\n\nArea of one circular base = π(5^2) = 25π square centimeters\n\nSince there are two circular bases, we multiply the area of one base by 2:\n\nTotal area of both circular bases = 2 * 25π = 50π square centimeters\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height. In this case, the radius is 5 cm and the height is 10 cm.\n\nLateral surface area = 2π(5)(10) = 100π square centimeters\n\nNow, we add the total area of both circular bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area of the cylinder:\n\nTotal surface area = 50π + 100π = 150π square centimeters\n\nSince π is approximately equal to 3.14159, we can multiply 150 by π to get the numerical value:\n\nTotal surface area ≈ 150 * 3.14159 ≈ 471.24 square centimeters\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cylinder is approximately 471.24 square centimeters."
