    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nThe given system can be written as:\n\n[3  2] [x]   [ 7]\n[4 -5] [y]   [-3]\n\nHere, A = [3  2]\n             [4 -5]\n\nB = [ 7]\n      [-3]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix is given by:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * [d  -b]\n                                      [-c   a]\n\nwhere det(A) = ad - bc\n\nIn our case, a = 3, b = 2, c = 4, and d = -5.\n\ndet(A) = (3 * -5) - (2 * 4) = -15 - 8 = -23\n\nNow, let's find the inverse of matrix A:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-23) * [-5  -2]\n                              [-4   3]\n\nA^(-1) = [ 5/23  2/23]\n               [ 4/23 -3/23]\n\nNow, we can find the solution by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = [ 5/23  2/23] [ 7]\n       [ 4/23 -3/23] [-3]\n\nMultiplying the matrices, we get:\n\nx = (5/23 * 7) + (2/23 * -3) = 35/23 - 6/23 = 29/23\ny = (4/23 * 7) + (-3/23 * -3) = 28/23 + 9/23 = 37/23\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 29/23\ny = 37/23"
