    "message_2": "The minimum possible order of a Latin square that contains 16 distinct symbols while ensuring that these symbols occur exactly once in each row and column of the square is 16. This is because a Latin square of order n contains n distinct symbols, and each symbol must appear exactly once in each row and column. Therefore, to have 16 distinct symbols, the Latin square must be of order 16."
