    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 12x^2 + 36x + 4 on the interval [0, 5], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 24x + 36\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 24x + 36 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 3:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 12 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 6)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 2 and x = 6. However, x = 6 is not in the interval [0, 5], so we only need to consider x = 2.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the function at the critical point and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 12(0)^2 + 36(0) + 4 = 4\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 12(2)^2 + 36(2) + 4 = 8 - 48 + 72 + 4 = 36\nf(5) = (5)^3 - 12(5)^2 + 36(5) + 4 = 125 - 300 + 180 + 4 = 9\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function on the interval [0, 5] is 36 at x = 2, and the minimum value is 4 at x = 0."
