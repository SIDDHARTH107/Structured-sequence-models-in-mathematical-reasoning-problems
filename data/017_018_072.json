    "message_2": "To prove that a group of order 32 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32, we will use the Sylow Theorems and the properties of p-groups.\n\nLet G be a group of order 32. Since 32 = 2^5, G is a 2-group. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G is equal to 1 mod 2 and divides 32. Thus, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let P be this Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nNow, we consider the possible structures of G based on the properties of P.\n\n1. Cyclic group C32:\nIf P is cyclic, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C32. This is because a group with a single normal cyclic subgroup of order equal to the group order must be cyclic itself. An example of this group is the additive group of integers modulo 32, denoted as Z32.\n\n2. Dihedral group D16:\nIf P is not cyclic but has a unique subgroup of order 16, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D16. This is because the dihedral group D16 has a unique normal subgroup of order 16, which is the cyclic group C16. An example of this group is the group of symmetries of a regular 16-gon.\n\n3. Six non-abelian groups of order 32:\nIf P has more than one subgroup of order 16, then G is isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32. These groups can be described using semidirect products and are denoted as Q32, Q32*, Q32**, Q32***, Q32****, and Q32*****. They can be constructed using different presentations, but one example is the following:\n\nQ32 = ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^9⟩\nQ32* = ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^5⟩\nQ32** = ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^3⟩\nQ32*** = ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^4 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^9⟩\nQ32**** = ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^4 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^5⟩\nQ32***** = ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^4 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^3⟩\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 32 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32. We have provided examples of each type of group."
