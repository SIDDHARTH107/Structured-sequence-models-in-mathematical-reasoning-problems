    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 10 cm, a base of 8 cm and a top length of 5 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height\n\nIn this case, base1 is the top length (5 cm), base2 is the bottom length (8 cm), and the height is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (5 + 8) * 10\nArea = (1/2) * (13) * 10\nArea = 6.5 * 10\nArea = 65 cmÂ²\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 65 square centimeters."
