    "message_2": "The two graphs are isomorphic. To show this, we can provide an isomorphism between the two graphs. An isomorphism is a bijection (one-to-one and onto) function that preserves adjacency between vertices.\n\nWe can define the isomorphism function f as follows:\n\nf(A) = W\nf(B) = X\nf(C) = Y\nf(D) = Z\n\nNow, let's check if this function preserves adjacency:\n\n1. f(A) = W and f(B) = X, so (A, B) maps to (W, X), which is an edge in Graph 2.\n2. f(B) = X and f(C) = Y, so (B, C) maps to (X, Y), which is an edge in Graph 2.\n3. f(C) = Y and f(D) = Z, so (C, D) maps to (Y, Z), which is an edge in Graph 2.\n4. f(A) = W and f(D) = Z, so (A, D) maps to (W, Z), which is an edge in Graph 2.\n\nSince all edges in Graph 1 map to edges in Graph 2, the function f is an isomorphism, and the two graphs are isomorphic."
