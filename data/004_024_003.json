    "message_2": "We are given two equations:\n\n1) x^2 + y^2 = 25\n2) y = x^2\n\nWe need to find the value of dy/dx when x = 3.\n\nFirst, we will differentiate both sides of equation (1) with respect to x using the chain rule.\n\nd(x^2)/dx + d(y^2)/dx = d(25)/dx\n\n2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 3. We can use equation (2) for this:\n\ny = x^2\ny = (3)^2\ny = 9\n\nNow, we can plug the values of x and y into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(3) + 2(9)(dy/dx) = 0\n\n6 + 18(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for dy/dx:\n\n18(dy/dx) = -6\n\n(dy/dx) = -6/18\n\n(dy/dx) = -1/3\n\nSo, the value of dy/dx when x = 3 is -1/3."
