    "message_1": "A ladder is placed against a wall with its base 4 meters away from the wall. The ladder is 7 meters long and reaches a height of 5 meters on the wall. What is the angle made by the ladder with the ground?",
    "message_2": "We can use the cosine rule to find the angle made by the ladder with the ground. The cosine rule states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and the angle C opposite side c:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\n\nIn this case, we have a right-angled triangle with the ladder as the hypotenuse (c = 7 meters), the distance from the wall as one side (a = 4 meters), and the height on the wall as the other side (b = 5 meters). We want to find the angle between the ladder and the ground, which is the angle C opposite the ladder.\n\ncos(C) = (4^2 + 5^2 - 7^2) / (2 * 4 * 5)\ncos(C) = (16 + 25 - 49) / 40\ncos(C) = (-8) / 40\ncos(C) = -0.2\n\nNow we need to find the angle C whose cosine is -0.2. We can use the inverse cosine function (also called arccos or cos^-1) to find this angle:\n\nC = arccos(-0.2)\nC â‰ˆ 101.54 degrees\n\nSo, the angle made by the ladder with the ground is approximately 101.54 degrees."
