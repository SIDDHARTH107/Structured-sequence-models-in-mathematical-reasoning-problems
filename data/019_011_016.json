    "message_2": "First, let's find the set A ⋃ B, which is the union of sets A and B. This means we combine all the elements from both sets, without repeating any elements.\n\nA ⋃ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the relation R on the set A ⋃ B. We'll list the pairs (x, y) where x and y have a common factor greater than 1.\n\nR = {(2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 8), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 8), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6)}\n\nNow we need to find the transitive closure of R. The transitive closure of a relation R is the smallest relation that contains R and is transitive. A relation is transitive if whenever (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R, then (a, c) ∈ R.\n\nIn our case, R is already transitive. To see this, notice that all elements in A ⋃ B that are related have 2 as a common factor. So, if (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R, then both a and c have 2 as a common factor, and thus (a, c) ∈ R.\n\nTherefore, the transitive closure of R is R itself:\n\nTransitive closure of R = {(2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 8), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 8), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6)}"
