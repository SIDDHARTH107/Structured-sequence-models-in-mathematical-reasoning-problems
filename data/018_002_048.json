    "message_2": "To prove that A ∩ B is a subset of A and B respectively, we need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and B.\n\nRecall that the intersection of two sets, A ∩ B, is the set of elements that are common to both A and B.\n\nLet's find A ∩ B:\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7}\nB = {3, 7, 9}\n\nComparing the elements of A and B, we see that the common elements are 3 and 7. Therefore,\nA ∩ B = {3, 7}\n\nNow, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of A and B.\n\n1. A ∩ B is a subset of A:\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element of A.\nA ∩ B = {3, 7}\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n\nBoth 3 and 7 are elements of A. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\n2. A ∩ B is a subset of B:\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element of B.\nA ∩ B = {3, 7}\nB = {3, 7, 9}\n\nBoth 3 and 7 are elements of B. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nIn conclusion, we have proved that A ∩ B is a subset of A and B respectively."
