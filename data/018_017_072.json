    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n1. (A x B) x A:\nA x B = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\nNow, (A x B) x A = {((1,3),1), ((1,3),2), ((1,4),1), ((1,4),2), ((2,3),1), ((2,3),2), ((2,4),1), ((2,4),2)}\n\n2. A x (B x A):\nB x A = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\nNow, A x (B x A) = {(1,(3,1)), (1,(3,2)), (1,(4,1)), (1,(4,2)), (2,(3,1)), (2,(3,2)), (2,(4,1)), (2,(4,2))}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A x B) x A and A x (B x A). The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nSymmetric difference = ( (A x B) x A ∪ A x (B x A) ) - ( (A x B) x A ∩ A x (B x A) )\n\nSince there is no common element in (A x B) x A and A x (B x A), their intersection is an empty set.\n\nTherefore, the symmetric difference is the union of the two sets:\n\nSymmetric difference = {((1,3),1), ((1,3),2), ((1,4),1), ((1,4),2), ((2,3),1), ((2,3),2), ((2,4),1), ((2,4),2)} ∪ {(1,(3,1)), (1,(3,2)), (1,(4,1)), (1,(4,2)), (2,(3,1)), (2,(3,2)), (2,(4,1)), (2,(4,2))}\n\nSince the symmetric difference is not an empty set, it shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
