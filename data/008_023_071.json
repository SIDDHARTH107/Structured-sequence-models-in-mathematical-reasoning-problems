    "message_2": "To find the solution of the system of linear equations, we can use the matrix method. First, we'll write the given system of equations in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2 -3 |\n    | 3 -4  1 |\n    | 2  1  1 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 5.3 |\n    | -2.4|\n    | 4.7 |\n\nNow, we'll find the inverse of matrix A (A_inv) and then multiply it with matrix B to get the matrix X, which contains the values of x, y, and z.\n\nA_inv = |  0.103 -0.154  0.462 |\n        | -0.154  0.077  0.308 |\n        | -0.462  0.308  0.846 |\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nX = |  0.103 -0.154  0.462 |  | 5.3  |\n    | -0.154  0.077  0.308 |  | -2.4 |\n    | -0.462  0.308  0.846 |  | 4.7  |\n\nX = | 1.0 |\n    | 2.0 |\n    | 1.0 |\n\nSo, the solution of the system of linear equations is x = 1.0, y = 2.0, and z = 1.0.\n\nHowever, since there is a measurement error in the coefficients (± 0.2) and the right-hand sides (± 0.1), the exact values of x, y, and z may vary within a certain range. To account for this error, we can calculate the ranges for x, y, and z by considering the worst-case scenarios for the coefficients and right-hand sides.\n\nFor example, if the coefficients are at their maximum error and the right-hand sides are at their minimum error, we can calculate the new values of x, y, and z. Similarly, we can calculate the new values for other worst-case scenarios. By comparing these values, we can determine the range for x, y, and z within which the solution may lie.\n\nHowever, calculating these ranges is a complex task and may require advanced numerical methods or optimization techniques. It is beyond the scope of a simple text-based response."
