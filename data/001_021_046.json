    "message_2": "To find the solutions of the quadratic equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (5 ± √((-5)² - 4(1)(6))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 2\n\nx = (5 ± √1) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\n1) x = (5 + 1) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n2) x = (5 - 1) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the solutions of the quadratic equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0 are x = 2 and x = 3."
