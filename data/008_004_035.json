    "message_2": "To solve the homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we can notice that all three equations are multiples of each other:\n\n1st equation: 2x - 4y + 6z = 0\n2nd equation: 4(2x - 4y + 6z) = 4(0) => 8x - 16y + 24z = 0\n3rd equation: -1.5(2x - 4y + 6z) = -1.5(0) => -3x + 6y - 9z = 0\n\nSince all three equations are linearly dependent, they represent the same plane in the 3D space. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of equations. To find the general solution, we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two. Let's express x in terms of y and z using the first equation:\n\n2x - 4y + 6z = 0 => x = 2y - 3z\n\nThe general solution to this system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 2y - 3z\ny = y\nz = z\n\nwhere y and z can be any real numbers."
