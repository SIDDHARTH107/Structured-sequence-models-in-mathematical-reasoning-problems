    "message_1": "A company produces two types of machine parts, A and B. The production of each part requires a specific sequence of operations with a certain cost. Part A has a profit of $50 and requires 2 operations, while part B has a profit of $60 and requires 3 operations. The company has a maximum budget of $400 for operations and can produce a total of 10 parts. How many parts of each type should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of part A produced and y be the number of part B produced.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n\n1. The total number of parts produced should not exceed 10:\nx + y ≤ 10\n\n2. The total cost of operations should not exceed $400:\n2x + 3y ≤ 400\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 50x + 60y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\nx + y ≤ 10\ny ≤ 10 - x\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 400\n3y ≤ 400 - 2x\ny ≤ (400 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0:\n(0, 0)\n\n2. Intersection of x = 0 and y = (400 - 2x) / 3:\n(0, 400/3)\n\n3. Intersection of y = 10 - x and y = (400 - 2x) / 3:\n10 - x = (400 - 2x) / 3\n30 - 3x = 400 - 2x\nx = 70\n\ny = 10 - 70 = -60 (not feasible)\n\n4. Intersection of x = 10 and y = 0:\n(10, 0)\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nP(0, 0) = 50(0) + 60(0) = $0\nP(0, 400/3) = 50(0) + 60(400/3) = $8000\nP(10, 0) = 50(10) + 60(0) = $500\n\nThe maximum profit is $8000 when the company produces 0 parts of type A and 400/3 ≈ 133.33 parts of type B. However, since the company can only produce a total of 10 parts, producing 133.33 parts of type B is not feasible.\n\nTo maximize the profit within the given constraints, the company should produce as many parts of type B as possible, which is 10 - x. Since x must be a whole number, the company should produce 9 parts of type A and 1 part of type B. This will result in a profit of:\n\nP(9, 1) = 50(9) + 60(1) = $510\n\nSo, the company should produce 9 parts of type A and 1 part of type B to maximize their profit of $510."
