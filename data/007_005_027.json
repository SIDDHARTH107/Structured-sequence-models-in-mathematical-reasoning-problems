    "message_2": "The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 36 and 48 is the smallest number that both numbers can divide into evenly. To find the LCM, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 36: 2^2 * 3^2 (2 * 2 * 3 * 3)\nPrime factorization of 48: 2^4 * 3^1 (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3)\n\nNow, we take the highest powers of each prime factor and multiply them together:\n\nLCM = 2^4 * 3^2 = (2 * 2 * 2 * 2) * (3 * 3) = 144\n\nSo, the LCM of 36 and 48 is 144."
