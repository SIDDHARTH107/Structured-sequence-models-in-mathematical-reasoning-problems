    "message_1": "A duopoly operates in the energy sector with a market demand function given by P = 180 - Q, where P is the price of energy and Q is the total quantity of energy sold. The total cost function of each firm is given by C(Q) = 60Q, where C is the total cost and Q is the quantity produced. Calculate the Cournot equilibrium quantity produced by each firm and the market price.",
    "message_2": "To find the Cournot equilibrium, we first need to find the reaction functions for each firm. Let's denote the quantity produced by firm 1 as q1 and the quantity produced by firm 2 as q2. The total quantity produced in the market, Q, is the sum of the quantities produced by both firms: Q = q1 + q2.\n\nThe revenue for each firm is given by the product of the price and the quantity produced: R = P * q. For firm 1, the revenue is R1 = (180 - Q) * q1 = (180 - (q1 + q2)) * q1. The profit for firm 1 is the difference between the revenue and the total cost: π1 = R1 - C(q1) = (180 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 - 60q1.\n\nTo find the reaction function for firm 1, we need to maximize its profit with respect to its quantity produced, q1. To do this, we take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to q1 and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(π1)/dq1 = (180 - (q1 + q2)) - 2q1 - 60 = 0\n\nSolving for q1, we get the reaction function for firm 1:\n\nq1 = (120 - q2)/2\n\nSimilarly, we can find the reaction function for firm 2:\n\nq2 = (120 - q1)/2\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:\n\nq1 = (120 - q2)/2\nq2 = (120 - q1)/2\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find the Cournot equilibrium quantities for each firm:\n\nq1 = 40\nq2 = 40\n\nNow that we have the equilibrium quantities, we can find the total quantity produced in the market, Q:\n\nQ = q1 + q2 = 40 + 40 = 80\n\nFinally, we can find the market price using the demand function:\n\nP = 180 - Q = 180 - 80 = 100\n\nSo, in the Cournot equilibrium, each firm produces 40 units of energy, the total quantity produced is 80 units, and the market price is 100."
