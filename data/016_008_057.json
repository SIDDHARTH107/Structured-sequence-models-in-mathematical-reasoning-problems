    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, at each iteration, each line segment is divided into four segments, each 1/3 the length of the original. So, N = 4 and s = 1/3.\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.26186\n\nThe exact Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is approximately 1.26186."
