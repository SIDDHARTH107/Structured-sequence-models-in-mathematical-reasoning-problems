    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to find its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed inside the cube, its diameter is equal to the edge length of the cube. \n\nDiameter of the sphere = Edge length of the cube = 4 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2:\n\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 4 cm / 2 = 2 cm\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\nVolume (V) = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (2 cm)^3\n\nV = (4/3) * π * 8 cm^3\n\nV = (32/3) * π cm^3\n\nV ≈ 33.51 cm^3 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 33.51 cubic centimeters."
