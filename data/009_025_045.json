    "message_1": "Consider an asset with the current price of $100. The annualized risk-free interest rate is 2%, and the asset's volatility is 30%. Assume that the asset does not pay any dividends. A European call option with a strike price of $110, expiring in six months, is valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation. Calculate the price of the call option, assuming that the volatility of the asset is a stochastic process that follows the Heston model.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the price of the European call option using the Heston model, we need to know the parameters of the Heston model. The Heston model is defined by the following stochastic differential equations:\n\ndS(t) = r * S(t) * dt + √(V(t)) * S(t) * dW1(t)\ndV(t) = κ * (θ - V(t)) * dt + σ * √(V(t)) * dW2(t)\n\nWhere:\nS(t) is the asset price at time t\nV(t) is the variance of the asset price at time t\nr is the risk-free interest rate (0.02)\nκ is the mean reversion rate of the volatility\nθ is the long-term average volatility\nσ is the volatility of the volatility\ndW1(t) and dW2(t) are two correlated Wiener processes with correlation ρ\n\nUnfortunately, without the values of κ, θ, σ, and ρ, we cannot calculate the price of the call option using the Heston model. If you provide these values, we can proceed with the calculation."
