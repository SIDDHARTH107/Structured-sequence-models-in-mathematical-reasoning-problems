    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by the following integral:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nFor the given function f(t) = e^(-2t)u(t), we have:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-2t)u(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nSince u(t) is the unit step function, it is equal to 1 for t ≥ 0 and 0 for t < 0. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-2t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, with the integration limits from 0 to infinity.\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-2t - jωt)] dt, from 0 to infinity.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by substitution. Let x = -2t - jωt, so dx = (-2 - jω)dt. Then, the integral becomes:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^x * (-1/(2 + jω))] dx, from 0 to infinity.\n\nNow, we can solve the integral:\n\nF(ω) = [(-1/(2 + jω)) * e^x] from 0 to infinity.\n\nEvaluating the limits, we get:\n\nF(ω) = (-1/(2 + jω)) * (e^0 - e^(-∞)) = (-1/(2 + jω)) * (1 - 0) = -1/(2 + jω).\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of f(t) = e^(-2t)u(t) is F(ω) = -1/(2 + jω).\n\nNow, let's discuss the stability of the system described by f(t). A system is considered stable if its impulse response (in this case, f(t)) is absolutely integrable, meaning that the integral of the absolute value of f(t) converges. In other words, we need to check if the following integral converges:\n\n∫|e^(-2t)u(t)| dt, from 0 to infinity.\n\nSince u(t) is 1 for t ≥ 0, the integral becomes:\n\n∫|e^(-2t)| dt, from 0 to infinity.\n\nThis integral converges because the exponential function e^(-2t) decays to 0 as t goes to infinity. Therefore, the system described by f(t) = e^(-2t)u(t) is stable."
