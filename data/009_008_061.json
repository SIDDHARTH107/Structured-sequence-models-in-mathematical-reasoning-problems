The string is plucked at t = 0 with an initial velocity given by v(x) = 3x - 3x^2 m/s, where x is the position (in meters) along the string, and x is measured from one end. Find the displacement of the string at x = 1.2 m and t = 0.4 s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the wave equation for a vibrating string. The wave equation is given by:\n\n∂²y/∂t² = c² ∂²y/∂x²\n\nwhere y(x, t) is the displacement of the string at position x and time t, and c is the wave speed. The wave speed c can be found using the formula:\n\nc = √(T/μ)\n\nwhere T is the tension in the string and μ is the mass density. We are given the mass density as 12 g/m, which is equivalent to 0.012 kg/m.\n\nWe are not given the tension T, but we can still proceed with the problem by leaving T as an unknown variable for now.\n\nThe initial velocity of the string is given by:\n\nv(x) = 3x - 3x²\n\nWe can find the initial displacement y(x, 0) by integrating the initial velocity with respect to x:\n\ny(x, 0) = ∫(3x - 3x²) dx = (3/2)x² - x³ + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the boundary conditions. Since the string is fixed at both ends, we have:\n\ny(0, 0) = 0 and y(2, 0) = 0\n\nPlugging in x = 0, we get:\n\n0 = (3/2)(0)² - (0)³ + C => C = 0\n\nNow, plugging in x = 2, we get:\n\n0 = (3/2)(2)² - (2)³\n\nSolving for this equation, we find that it is already satisfied. So, the initial displacement is:\n\ny(x, 0) = (3/2)x² - x³\n\nNow, we need to find the displacement y(x, t) at x = 1.2 m and t = 0.4 s. To do this, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the displacement y(x, t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\ny(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the wave equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T''(t) = c² X''(x)T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by X(x)T(t), we obtain:\n\nT''(t)/T(t) = c² X''(x)/X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\nT''(t)/T(t) = -λ\nc² X''(x)/X(x) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nT''(t) + λT(t) = 0\nX''(x) + (λ/c²)X(x) = 0\n\nWe will solve the second equation for X(x). This is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions X(0) = 0 and X(2) = 0. The general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A sin(√(λ/c²) x) + B cos(√(λ/c²) x)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nX(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0 (since the string is fixed at x = 0)\n\nX(2) = A sin(√(λ/c²) 2) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have:\n\nsin(√(λ/c²) 2) = 0\n\nThis implies that √(λ/c²) 2 = nπ, where n is an integer. Therefore, λ = (n²π²c²)/4. The solution for X(x) is then:\n\nX(x) = A sin(nπx/2)\n\nNow, we need to find the solution for T(t). The equation for T(t) is:\n\nT''(t) + (n²π²c²/4)T(t) = 0\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution is:\n\nT(t) = C cos(nπct/2) + D sin(nπct/2)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for y(x, t):\n\ny(x, t) = ∑[A_n sin(nπx/2)(C_n cos(nπct/2) + D_n sin(nπct/2))]\n\nWe can find the coefficients A_n, C_n, and D_n by using the initial conditions y(x, 0) and v(x) = ∂y/∂t(x, 0). We have:\n\ny(x, 0) = (3/2)x² - x³ = ∑[A_n sin(nπx/2) C_n]\n\nv(x) = 3x - 3x² = ∑[A_n sin(nπx/2)(nπc/2) D_n]\n\nWe can use Fourier sine series to find the coefficients A_n and D_n:\n\nA_n = (2/L) ∫[y(x, 0) sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\nD_n = (2/cL) ∫[v(x) sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nwhere L = 2 m is the length of the string. We can compute the integrals:\n\nA_n = (1/2) ∫[(3/2)x² - x³] sin(nπx/2) dx from 0 to 2\nD_n = (1/c) ∫(3x - 3x²) sin(nπx/2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nWe can use integration by parts to compute these integrals. After computing the integrals, we get:\n\nA_n = (8/π³n³)[1 - (-1)^n]\nD_n = (24/π²n²)[1 - (-1)^n]\n\nNow, we can plug these coefficients back into the general solution for y(x, t):\n\ny(x, t) = ∑[(8/π³n³)[1 - (-1)^n] sin(nπx/2)((24/π²n²)[1 - (-1)^n] sin(nπct/2))]\n\nFinally, we can find the displacement of the string at x = 1.2 m and t = 0.4 s:\n\ny(1.2, 0.4) = ∑[(8/π³n³)[1 - (-1)^n] sin(nπ(1.2)/2)((24/π²n²)[1 - (-1)^n] sin(nπc(0.4)/2))]\n\nSince we don't have the value of T (and therefore c), we cannot compute an exact numerical value for the displacement. However, the expression above gives the displacement of the string at x = 1.2 m and t = 0.4 s in terms of the wave speed c and the integer n."
