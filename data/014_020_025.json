    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using the Vigenere cipher, we first need to repeat the key \"MATH\" to match the length of the encrypted text. In this case, the repeated key is \"MATHMATHMA\".\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere table to decrypt the message. The Vigenere table is a 26x26 grid of letters, where each row is shifted one position to the right compared to the row above it. To decrypt a letter, we find the intersection of the row corresponding to the key letter and the column corresponding to the encrypted letter. The letter at the intersection is the decrypted letter.\n\nHere's the decryption process for each letter:\n\n1. O (encrypted) - M (key) = H (decrypted)\n2. P - A = E\n3. K - T = L\n4. R - H = L\n5. G - M = O\n6. L - A = L\n7. O - T = W\n8. P - H = O\n9. L - M = R\n10. H - A = G\n\nThe decrypted message is \"HELLOLWORG\"."
