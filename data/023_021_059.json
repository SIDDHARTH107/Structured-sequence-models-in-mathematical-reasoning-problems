    "message_2": "To find the frequency spectrum of the rectangular pulse signal using the Fourier transform technique, we first need to express the signal as a Fourier series. The Fourier series of a periodic function f(t) with period T is given by:\n\nf(t) = a0 + Σ[an * cos(2πnft) + bn * sin(2πnft)]\n\nwhere a0, an, and bn are the Fourier coefficients, f is the frequency (f = 1/T), and n is the harmonic number.\n\nFor a rectangular pulse signal with amplitude A, width τ, and period T, the Fourier coefficients are given by:\n\na0 = (1/T) * ∫[A * dt] from -τ/2 to τ/2 = (A * τ) / T\n\nan = (2/T) * ∫[A * cos(2πnft) * dt] from -τ/2 to τ/2\nbn = (2/T) * ∫[A * sin(2πnft) * dt] from -τ/2 to τ/2\n\nSince the rectangular pulse is an odd function, all an coefficients will be zero. We only need to calculate the bn coefficients:\n\nbn = (2/T) * ∫[A * sin(2πnft) * dt] from -τ/2 to τ/2\nbn = (2/T) * [(-A/(2πnf)) * cos(2πnft)] from -τ/2 to τ/2\nbn = (2A/(πnT)) * [cos(πnfτ) - cos(0)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values: A = 5 V, τ = 4 ms, and T = 20 ms.\n\na0 = (5 * 4) / 20 = 1 V\n\nbn = (10/(πn * 20)) * [cos(πn * 4/20) - cos(0)]\nbn = (1/(2πn)) * [cos(πn/5) - 1]\n\nThe frequency spectrum of the rectangular pulse signal is given by the Fourier series:\n\nf(t) = 1 + Σ[(1/(2πn)) * [cos(πn/5) - 1] * sin(2πnft)]\n\nwhere f = 1/T = 1/20 ms = 50 Hz, and the summation is over all integer values of n."
