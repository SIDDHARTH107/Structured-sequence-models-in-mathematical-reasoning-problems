    "message_1": "A magician is planning a performance where he will randomly choose a card from a standard deck of 52 cards. If the magician selects a spade, he will perform a dangerous trick involving a sword. However, if he selects any other card, he will perform a simpler trick with a dove. What is the probability that the magician performs the dangerous trick?",
    "message_2": "In a standard deck of 52 cards, there are 13 spades. The probability of the magician selecting a spade is the ratio of the number of spades to the total number of cards in the deck. Therefore, the probability of the magician performing the dangerous trick is:\n\n13 spades / 52 total cards = 1/4 or 0.25 (25% chance)"
