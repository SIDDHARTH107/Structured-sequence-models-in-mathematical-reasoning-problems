    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,4), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. \n\nGiven the surface equation z = 2(x^2 + y^2), we can define the position vector r(x, y) as:\n\nr(x, y) = xi + yj + 2(x^2 + y^2)k\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives of r with respect to x and y:\n\nr_x = ∂r/∂x = i + 4xk\nr_y = ∂r/∂y = j + 4yk\n\nNext, we compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_x • r_x = 1 + 16x^2\nF = r_x • r_y = 0\nG = r_y • r_y = 1 + 16y^2\n\nNow, we find the second derivatives of r:\n\nr_xx = ∂²r/∂x² = 4k\nr_xy = ∂²r/∂x∂y = 0\nr_yy = ∂²r/∂y² = 4k\n\nNext, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\ne = r_xx • N = 4N_z\nf = r_xy • N = 0\ng = r_yy • N = 4N_z\n\nwhere N is the unit normal vector to the surface. To find N, we first find the normal vector n = r_x × r_y:\n\nn = i × j + 4xk × j + i × 4yk = -4xi + 4yj + k\n\nNow, we find the magnitude of n:\n\n|n| = √((-4x)^2 + (4y)^2 + 1^2) = √(16x^2 + 16y^2 + 1)\n\nThe unit normal vector N is then:\n\nN = n/|n| = (-4x/√(16x^2 + 16y^2 + 1))i + (4y/√(16x^2 + 16y^2 + 1))j + (1/√(16x^2 + 16y^2 + 1))k\n\nAt the point (1,1,4), the unit normal vector N is:\n\nN = (-4/√33)i + (4/√33)j + (1/√33)k\n\nNow, we can find N_z at the point (1,1,4):\n\nN_z = 1/√33\n\nNow we can find the second fundamental form coefficients at the point (1,1,4):\n\ne = 4N_z = 4/√33\nf = 0\ng = 4N_z = 4/√33\n\nFinally, we can compute the sectional curvature K at the point (1,1,4) using the first and second fundamental forms:\n\nK = (eg - f^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1,4), E = 17, F = 0, G = 17:\n\nK = ((4/√33)(4/√33) - 0^2) / (17 * 17 - 0^2)\nK = (16/33) / 289\nK = 16 / (33 * 289)\nK ≈ 0.0017\n\nSo, the sectional curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,4) is approximately 0.0017."
