The cost of advertising product A is $100 per unit, and the cost of advertising product B is $150 per unit. If the manufacturer wants to maximize the total number of units sold, where product A sells for $5 per unit and product B sells for $10 per unit, how many units of each product should be advertised?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A advertised and y be the number of units of product B advertised. We are given the following information:\n\n1. The total cost of advertising is $10,000.\n2. The cost of advertising product A is $100 per unit.\n3. The cost of advertising product B is $150 per unit.\n\nFrom this information, we can create the following equation representing the total cost of advertising:\n\n100x + 150y = 10,000\n\nWe want to maximize the total number of units sold, so we need to find the maximum value of x + y under the constraint of the advertising budget.\n\nFirst, let's solve the equation for y:\n\n150y = 10,000 - 100x\ny = (10,000 - 100x) / 150\n\nNow, we want to maximize x + y, which can be rewritten as:\n\nx + (10,000 - 100x) / 150\n\nTo find the maximum value, we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to x and set it to zero:\n\nd(x + (10,000 - 100x) / 150) / dx = 0\n\nUsing the quotient rule, we get:\n\nd(x)/dx - d(10000 - 100x)/dx * 1/150 = 0\n1 - (-100) / 150 = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n1 + 100 / 150 = 0\nx = 50\n\nNow, we can plug this value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (10,000 - 100 * 50) / 150\ny = (10,000 - 5,000) / 150\ny = 5,000 / 150\ny = 100 / 3 â‰ˆ 33.33\n\nSince we cannot advertise a fraction of a unit, we can either advertise 33 or 34 units of product B. To determine which option maximizes the total number of units sold, we can compare the total number of units for each option:\n\nOption 1: 50 units of A and 33 units of B\nTotal units: 50 + 33 = 83\n\nOption 2: 50 units of A and 34 units of B\nTotal units: 50 + 34 = 84\n\nTherefore, the manufacturer should advertise 50 units of product A and 34 units of product B to maximize the total number of units sold."
