    "message_2": "A Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that can be generated by iteratively applying a set of rules. In the case of the Vicsek fractal, the pattern is formed by dividing each square into a 3x3 grid and placing a smaller square in the center and at each corner.\n\nTo find the total perimeter of a Vicsek fractal of order 3, we can use the following formula:\n\nPerimeter = P₀ * (N^(n-1))\n\nwhere P₀ is the initial perimeter, N is the scaling factor, and n is the order of the fractal.\n\nFor a Vicsek fractal, the initial perimeter P₀ is 4 (since it starts as a square with 4 sides), and the scaling factor N is 3 (since each side is divided into 3 segments).\n\nSo, for a Vicsek fractal of order 3, the formula becomes:\n\nPerimeter = 4 * (3^(3-1))\n\nPerimeter = 4 * (3^2)\n\nPerimeter = 4 * 9\n\nPerimeter = 36\n\nTherefore, the total perimeter of a Vicsek fractal of order 3 with each line segment having a length of 1 unit is 36 units."
