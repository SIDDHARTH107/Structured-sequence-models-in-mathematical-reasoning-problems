    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces light bulbs, and the average lifespan of light bulbs is assumed to be 800 hours with a standard deviation of 50 hours. A sample of 36 light bulbs was taken, and the average lifespan was found to be 790 hours. Test the hypothesis that the true average lifespan is not 800 hours at 5% significance level. What is the p-value of the test?",
    "message_2": "To test the hypothesis that the true average lifespan is not 800 hours at a 5% significance level, we will perform a two-tailed t-test. \n\nFirst, let's state the null and alternative hypotheses:\n\nH0: μ = 800 (The true average lifespan is 800 hours)\nH1: μ ≠ 800 (The true average lifespan is not 800 hours)\n\nNext, we will calculate the test statistic. Since we know the standard deviation, we can use the z-test. The formula for the z-test is:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nz = (790 - 800) / (50 / √36)\nz = -10 / (50 / 6)\nz = -10 / 8.333\nz ≈ -1.20\n\nNow, we will find the p-value for the two-tailed test. Using a z-table or calculator, we find the probability for z = -1.20:\n\nP(z ≤ -1.20) ≈ 0.1151\n\nSince this is a two-tailed test, we need to consider both tails of the distribution. Therefore, we double the probability:\n\np-value = 2 * 0.1151 ≈ 0.2302\n\nThe p-value is approximately 0.2302. Since the p-value is greater than the significance level (0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to conclude that the true average lifespan of the light bulbs is different from 800 hours."
