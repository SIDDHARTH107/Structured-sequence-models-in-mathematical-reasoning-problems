    "message_2": "Using the power rule of differentiation, which states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1), we can find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^5 - 2x^3 + 7x - 9.\n\nThe derivative of each term is as follows:\n\n- The derivative of 3x^5 is 5 * 3x^(5-1) = 15x^4.\n- The derivative of -2x^3 is 3 * (-2)x^(3-1) = -6x^2.\n- The derivative of 7x is 7 * 1x^(1-1) = 7.\n- The derivative of a constant, -9, is 0.\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 15x^4 - 6x^2 + 7"
