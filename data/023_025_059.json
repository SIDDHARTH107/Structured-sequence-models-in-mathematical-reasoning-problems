    "message_1": "A rectangular piece of metal has the dimensions 6 cm x 8 cm. The temperature on the two opposite edges is held constant, one at 100°C and the other at 50°C, while the other two edges are insulated. Use the Fourier transform to find the temperature distribution in the metal piece at time t = 0.5.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution in the rectangular metal piece, we can use the 2D heat equation with Fourier transform. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x, y, t) / ∂t = α (∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂x² + ∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂y²)\n\nwhere T(x, y, t) is the temperature distribution, α is the thermal diffusivity of the metal, and x and y are the spatial coordinates.\n\nSince the temperature is held constant on the two opposite edges, we can assume that the initial temperature distribution is given by:\n\nT(x, y, 0) = 100 - (50/8) * x\n\nNow, we can use the Fourier transform to solve the heat equation. The Fourier transform of the heat equation is:\n\n∂T(kx, ky, t) / ∂t = -α (kx² + ky²) T(kx, ky, t)\n\nwhere T(kx, ky, t) is the Fourier transform of T(x, y, t), and kx and ky are the wave numbers in the x and y directions.\n\nThe solution to this equation is given by:\n\nT(kx, ky, t) = T(kx, ky, 0) * exp(-α (kx² + ky²) * t)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of T(kx, ky, t) to obtain the temperature distribution T(x, y, t):\n\nT(x, y, t) = F^(-1) {T(kx, ky, t)}\n\nSince we are interested in the temperature distribution at time t = 0.5, we can plug in the values:\n\nT(x, y, 0.5) = F^(-1) {T(kx, ky, 0) * exp(-α (kx² + ky²) * 0.5)}\n\nTo find the actual temperature distribution, we would need to know the thermal diffusivity (α) of the metal and perform the inverse Fourier transform. However, this is a complex mathematical operation that requires numerical methods and is beyond the scope of a simple text response.\n\nIn summary, the temperature distribution in the rectangular metal piece at time t = 0.5 can be found using the Fourier transform of the heat equation. The actual temperature distribution would require knowledge of the metal's thermal diffusivity and the use of numerical methods to perform the inverse Fourier transform."
