    "message_2": "The Cantor dust generated by removing the middle 1/3 interval from the unit interval [0,1] is also known as the Cantor set. To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(1/r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Cantor set, at each step, the interval is divided into 2 self-similar pieces (the left and right thirds), and the scaling factor is 3 (since we remove the middle third).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(3) â‰ˆ 0.6309"
