    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 20. The prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups (n_5) divides 4 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups (n_2) divides 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. The possibilities for n_2 are 1 or 5.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIf there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup, then it is normal in G. Let P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup and Q be the unique 2-Sylow subgroup. Since P and Q are both normal in G, their product PQ is also normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}. Therefore, by the internal direct product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is C5 × C4. This group is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 5\nIf there are five 2-Sylow subgroups, then none of them are normal in G. Let P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup, which is normal in G. Since P is normal and has index 4 in G, there exists a homomorphism φ: G → S_4. The kernel of φ is a normal subgroup of G contained in P. If the kernel is trivial, then φ is injective, and G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_4. However, this is not possible since the order of G is 20, which does not divide the order of S_4 (24). Therefore, the kernel of φ must be equal to P, and G/P is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_4. The only subgroup of S_4 with order 4 is the Klein four-group V_4. Thus, G/P is isomorphic to V_4, and G is a semidirect product of P and a 2-Sylow subgroup Q. This group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20 or the dihedral group D10, depending on the number of 2-Sylow subgroups. There is no non-abelian group of order 20 other than D10, so G cannot be isomorphic to any other non-abelian group of order 20."
