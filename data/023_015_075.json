    "message_2": "To find the fundamental frequency of the string vibration, we can use the formula for the fundamental frequency of a vibrating string, which is given by:\n\nf = (1/2L) * sqrt(T/μ)\n\nwhere:\nf is the fundamental frequency,\nL is the length of the string,\nT is the tension in the string, and\nμ is the linear mass density of the string.\n\nFirst, we need to find the linear mass density (μ) of the string. Linear mass density is the mass per unit length of the string. We are given the mass (m) of the string as 4 g, which we need to convert to kg:\n\nm = 4 g = 0.004 kg\n\nNow, we can find the linear mass density (μ) using the formula:\n\nμ = m/L\n\nwhere L is the length of the string, which is given as 80 cm. We need to convert this to meters:\n\nL = 80 cm = 0.8 m\n\nNow, we can find the linear mass density:\n\nμ = 0.004 kg / 0.8 m = 0.005 kg/m\n\nNow that we have the linear mass density, we can find the fundamental frequency using the formula:\n\nf = (1/2L) * sqrt(T/μ)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf = (1/(2 * 0.8 m)) * sqrt(100 N / 0.005 kg/m)\n\nf = (1/1.6 m) * sqrt(20000 m²/s²)\n\nf = 0.625 Hz * sqrt(20000 m²/s²)\n\nf ≈ 0.625 Hz * 141.42 s⁻¹\n\nf ≈ 88.39 Hz\n\nSo, the fundamental frequency of the string vibration is approximately 88.39 Hz."
