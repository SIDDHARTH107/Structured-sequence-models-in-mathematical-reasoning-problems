    "message_1": "A hospital wants to determine the survival rate for patients who undergo a particular surgery. A group of 100 patients who underwent the surgery were monitored for 5 years. At the end of the study period, 60 patients were still alive and 40 had died. What is the survival rate for these patients?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the survival rate, we need to divide the number of patients who survived by the total number of patients in the study.\n\nSurvival rate = (Number of patients who survived) / (Total number of patients)\n\nIn this case, 60 patients survived out of 100 patients.\n\nSurvival rate = 60 / 100\n\nTo express the survival rate as a percentage, we multiply the result by 100.\n\nSurvival rate = (60 / 100) * 100 = 60%\n\nThe survival rate for these patients is 60%."
