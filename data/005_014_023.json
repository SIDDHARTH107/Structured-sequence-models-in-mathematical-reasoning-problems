    "message_1": "A researcher measures the scores of 100 students on two different tests, test A and test B. The correlation coefficient between the two tests is found to be 0.6. Using factor analysis, the researcher wants to determine if there is one underlying factor that explains the variability in both tests. Find the eigenvalue and the proportion of variance explained by the first common factor for the dataset.",
    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalue and the proportion of variance explained by the first common factor, we first need to create a correlation matrix for the two tests. Since we only have two tests, the correlation matrix will be a 2x2 matrix. The diagonal elements of the matrix will be 1, as the correlation of a variable with itself is always 1. The off-diagonal elements will be the correlation coefficient between the two tests, which is 0.6.\n\nThe correlation matrix will look like this:\n\n| 1   0.6 |\n| 0.6  1  |\n\nNext, we need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues (λ) can be found by solving the characteristic equation:\n\n| 1-λ  0.6  |\n| 0.6  1-λ  |\n\nDeterminant of the matrix = (1-λ)^2 - (0.6)^2\n=> λ^2 - 2λ + 1 - 0.36 = 0\n=> λ^2 - 2λ + 0.64 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation for λ using the quadratic formula:\n\nλ = ( -b ± √(b^2 - 4ac) ) / 2a\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = 0.64.\n\nλ = ( 2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(0.64)) ) / 2(1)\nλ = ( 2 ± √(4 - 2.56) ) / 2\nλ = ( 2 ± √1.44 ) / 2\n\nThe two eigenvalues are:\nλ1 = ( 2 + 1.2 ) / 2 = 1.6\nλ2 = ( 2 - 1.2 ) / 2 = 0.4\n\nSince we are interested in the first common factor, we will use the larger eigenvalue, λ1 = 1.6.\n\nNow, we can calculate the proportion of variance explained by the first common factor. The total variance in the dataset is equal to the sum of the eigenvalues. In this case, the total variance is λ1 + λ2 = 1.6 + 0.4 = 2.\n\nThe proportion of variance explained by the first common factor is the ratio of the first eigenvalue to the total variance:\n\nProportion of variance = λ1 / (λ1 + λ2) = 1.6 / 2 = 0.8\n\nSo, the eigenvalue for the first common factor is 1.6, and the proportion of variance explained by the first common factor is 0.8 or 80%."
