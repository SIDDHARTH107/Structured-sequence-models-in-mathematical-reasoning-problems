    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the complex function f(z) in terms of x and y, where z = x + iy.\n\nf(z) = 3(x + iy)^3 - 2i(x + iy)^2 + 5(x + iy) + 7\n\nNow, let's expand and simplify the function:\n\nf(z) = 3(x^3 + 3ix^2y - 3xy^2 - iy^3) - 2i(x^2 - 2ixy - y^2) + 5x + 5iy + 7\n\nSeparate the real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 3x^3 - 3xy^2 + 5x + 7\nImaginary part: 3ix^2y - iy^3 - 2ix^2 + 2ixy^2 + 5iy\n\nNow, we want to find the harmonic function u(x, y) such that the real part of f(z) is equal to u(x, y) for all z:\n\nu(x, y) = 3x^3 - 3xy^2 + 5x + 7\n\nA harmonic function satisfies Laplace's equation, which means that the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to x and y is equal to zero:\n\n∇²u(x, y) = ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0\n\nLet's compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂²u/∂x² = ∂/∂x(9x^2 - 3y^2 + 5) = 18x\n∂²u/∂y² = ∂/∂y(-6xy) = -6x\n\nNow, let's check if the sum of the second partial derivatives is equal to zero:\n\n∇²u(x, y) = 18x - 6x = 12x\n\nSince the sum of the second partial derivatives is not equal to zero, the function u(x, y) = 3x^3 - 3xy^2 + 5x + 7 is not harmonic. Therefore, there are no harmonic functions u(x, y) such that the real part of f(z) is equal to u(x, y) for all z."
