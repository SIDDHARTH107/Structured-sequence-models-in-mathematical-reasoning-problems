    "message_1": "A teacher plans to assign six projects to a class of nine students. Each project must be completed by exactly three students, and each student must work on exactly one project. How many different ways can the teacher assign the projects to the students?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. A combination is a selection of items from a larger set, where the order of the items does not matter.\n\nFirst, we need to divide the nine students into three groups of three students each. We can use the combination formula to calculate the number of ways to do this:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nFor the first group of three students, we have:\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!(9-3)!) = 9! / (3!6!) = 84 ways\n\nNow, we have six students left to divide into two more groups of three. For the second group, we have:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3!3!) = 20 ways\n\nFinally, for the last group, there are only three students left, so there is only 1 way to form the group.\n\nNow, we need to assign the projects to the groups. Since there are six projects and three groups, we can use the combination formula again to determine the number of ways to assign the projects:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3!3!) = 20 ways\n\nTo find the total number of ways to assign the projects to the students, we multiply the number of ways to form the groups by the number of ways to assign the projects:\n\n84 (ways to form groups) × 20 (ways to assign projects) = 1680\n\nSo, there are 1680 different ways the teacher can assign the projects to the students."
