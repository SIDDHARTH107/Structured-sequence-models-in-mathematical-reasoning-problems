    "message_1": "Suppose there are two firms in a Bertrand Competition selling identical products with marginal costs of $5. Firm A announces a price of $10, and Firm B must decide whether to match the price or undercut it. If Firm B chooses to undercut, they will win 60% of the market share, and if they match, they will split the market share equally. If both firms set the same price, they will also split the market share equally. What price should Firm B choose to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal price for Firm B, we need to calculate the profit for each possible scenario: matching the price or undercutting it. \n\nLet's denote the quantity sold by Firm B as Q_B, the price set by Firm B as P_B, and the market share as MS_B. The profit for Firm B can be calculated as:\n\nProfit_B = (P_B - MC) * Q_B\n\nwhere MC is the marginal cost, which is $5.\n\nScenario 1: Firm B matches the price of $10\nIn this case, P_B = $10, and since the market share is split equally, MS_B = 50%. Let's assume the total market demand is Q, so Q_B = 0.5 * Q. The profit for Firm B in this scenario is:\n\nProfit_B = ($10 - $5) * (0.5 * Q) = $5 * (0.5 * Q) = 2.5Q\n\nScenario 2: Firm B undercuts the price\nIn this case, P_B < $10, and MS_B = 60%. Let's denote the undercut price as P_U. The quantity sold by Firm B in this scenario is Q_B = 0.6 * Q. The profit for Firm B in this scenario is:\n\nProfit_B = (P_U - $5) * (0.6 * Q) = (P_U - $5) * 0.6Q\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm B should choose the scenario with the highest profit. Comparing the two scenarios:\n\n2.5Q > (P_U - $5) * 0.6Q\n\nDivide both sides by Q:\n\n2.5 > (P_U - $5) * 0.6\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.6:\n\n2.5 / 0.6 > P_U - $5\n\n4.1667 > P_U - $5\n\nAdd $5 to both sides:\n\n$9.1667 > P_U\n\nSo, the undercut price P_U should be less than $9.1667 to maximize Firm B's profit. However, we need to consider that Firm B cannot set a price lower than its marginal cost of $5. Therefore, the optimal price for Firm B to maximize its profit is any price between $5 and $9.1667, exclusive."
