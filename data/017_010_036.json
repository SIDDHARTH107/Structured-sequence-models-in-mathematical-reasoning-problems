    "message_2": "To determine the isomorphism class of the group with the given presentation, we will first try to simplify the presentation and then compare it with known groups.\n\nGiven group presentation: $\\langle a, b \\mid a^5 = b^2 = e, ab = ba^2\\rangle$\n\nWe can rewrite the relation $ab = ba^2$ as $b = a^{-1}ab$. Now, let's find the order of $b$ in terms of $a$. We have:\n\n$b^2 = (a^{-1}ab)^2 = a^{-1}a^2ba^{-1}ab = a^{-1}a^2a^{-1}a^2b^2 = a^{-1}a^2a^{-1}a^4 = a^{-1}a^6 = a^{-1}a = e$\n\nSo, the order of $b$ is 2, which we already knew from the presentation. Now, let's find the order of $ab$:\n\n$(ab)^2 = aba^{-1}ab = ba^2ba^{-1}ab = ba^3b^{-1}ab = ba^3a^{-1}a^2b = ba^4 = a^{-1}ab^2 = a^{-1}a = e$\n\nSo, the order of $ab$ is also 2. Now, let's find the order of $a^2$:\n\n$(a^2)^5 = a^{10} = a^5a^5 = ee = e$\n\nSo, the order of $a^2$ is 5. We can now rewrite the group presentation as:\n\n$\\langle a, b \\mid a^5 = b^2 = (ab)^2 = e, b = a^{-1}ab\\rangle$\n\nNow, let's compare this presentation with the known groups:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 10, $C_{10} = \\langle x \\mid x^{10} = e\\rangle$\n2. Dihedral group of order 10, $D_{10} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^5 = y^2 = (xy)^2 = e\\rangle$\n\nComparing the given group presentation with $D_{10}$, we can see that they have the same relations. Let's define a map $\\phi: \\langle a, b \\rangle \\to D_{10}$ such that $\\phi(a) = x$ and $\\phi(b) = y$. We can check that this map preserves the relations:\n\n1. $\\phi(a^5) = \\phi(e) = e$, and $x^5 = e$ in $D_{10}$.\n2. $\\phi(b^2) = \\phi(e) = e$, and $y^2 = e$ in $D_{10}$.\n3. $\\phi(ab) = \\phi(a)\\phi(b) = xy$, and $(xy)^2 = e$ in $D_{10}$.\n4. $\\phi(b) = \\phi(a^{-1}ab) = x^{-1}xy = y$, which is the same as the relation in $D_{10}$.\n\nSince the map $\\phi$ preserves the relations, it is a homomorphism. Moreover, it is surjective, as every element of $D_{10}$ can be obtained from the images of $a$ and $b$. Finally, it is injective, as the orders of $a$ and $b$ in the given group match the orders of $x$ and $y$ in $D_{10}$, and there are no additional relations that would cause the kernel of $\\phi$ to be nontrivial.\n\nTherefore, the map $\\phi$ is an isomorphism, and the group with the given presentation is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 10, $D_{10}$."
