    "message_1": "In the Dictator Game, player A is given $100 and decides how much money to give to player B. If player A gives nothing, player B receives $0. If player A gives some amount x, then player B receives $(100-x). If player B receives $50 or more, he accepts, otherwise, he rejects the allocation. What is the optimal amount that player A should give to player B to maximize his own benefit, if player A is risk-averse and values a dollar less than a dollar benefitted by player B?",
    "message_2": "Since player A is risk-averse and values a dollar less than a dollar benefitted by player B, the optimal amount that player A should give to player B is $50. This is because giving exactly $50 ensures that player B will accept the allocation, and player A will keep the other $50. \n\nIf player A gives less than $50, player B will reject the allocation, and player A will end up with nothing. If player A gives more than $50, player B will still accept the allocation, but player A will have less money for themselves. Therefore, giving exactly $50 is the optimal amount for player A to maximize their own benefit while ensuring that player B accepts the allocation."
