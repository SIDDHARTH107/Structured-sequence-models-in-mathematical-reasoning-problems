Let $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$. Determine the Lie derivative of $f$ with respect to $X$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of $f$ with respect to $X$, we need to apply the vector field $X$ to the function $f$. In other words, we need to compute the directional derivative of $f$ in the direction of $X$. This is given by the following formula:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X f = X(f) = x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$$\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$$\n\nSubstituting these into the formula for the Lie derivative, we get:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X f = x(2x) + y(2y) = 2x^2 + 2y^2$$\n\nSo, the Lie derivative of $f$ with respect to $X$ is:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X f = 2x^2 + 2y^2$$"
