    "message_1": "Jane wants to distribute 6 identical donuts to her 4 friends, such that each of her friends receives at least 1 donut. In how many ways can Jane distribute the donuts?",
    "message_2": "Since each of Jane's 4 friends must receive at least 1 donut, we can start by giving 1 donut to each friend. This leaves us with 2 donuts to distribute among the 4 friends.\n\nWe can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. We have 2 donuts (stars) and 3 dividers (bars) to separate the donuts among the 4 friends. We need to arrange these 5 elements (2 stars and 3 bars).\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these elements is the number of combinations of choosing 2 positions for the stars out of the 5 available positions (the remaining positions will be occupied by the bars). This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 5 and k = 2:\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / (2! * 3!)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / (2 * 6)\nC(5, 2) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 2) = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 ways for Jane to distribute the remaining 2 donuts among her 4 friends, given that each friend already has 1 donut."
