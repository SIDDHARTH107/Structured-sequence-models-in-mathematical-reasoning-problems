    "message_2": "Cholesky decomposition is not the appropriate method to solve this system of linear equations, as it is used for symmetric positive definite matrices. Instead, we can use Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nLet's solve this system using Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 5 \\\\\n2 & 8 & -1 & 11 \\\\\n2 & 5 & -1 & 3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n2. Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows:\n\nSubtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 4 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 5 & -1 & 3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nSubtract 2 times the first row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 4 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & -7\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n3. Eliminate the second element in the third row:\n\nSubtract 1/4 times the second row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 4 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & -8\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n4. Back-substitute to find the solution:\n\nFrom the third row, we have $z = -8$.\n\nFrom the second row, we have $4y + 1(-8) = 1 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{9}{4}$.\n\nFrom the first row, we have $x + 2(\\frac{9}{4}) - (-8) = 5 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSo, the solution is $x = \\frac{1}{4}$, $y = \\frac{9}{4}$, and $z = -8$."
