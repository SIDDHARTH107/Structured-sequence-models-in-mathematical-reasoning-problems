Using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, determine if there is a significant difference between the scores of male and female students.\n\nMale scores: 75, 80, 85, 88, 92, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100\nFemale scores: 70, 72, 76, 78, 80, 83, 87, 88, 89, 92\n\nPerform the test at a 5% level of significance.",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank sum test, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Combine the two groups of scores and rank them in ascending order.\n2. Calculate the sum of the ranks for each group.\n3. Calculate the test statistic W.\n4. Determine the critical value for the given level of significance.\n5. Compare the test statistic to the critical value to determine if there is a significant difference between the groups.\n\nStep 1: Combine and rank the scores\n\n70, 72, 75, 76, 78, 80, 80, 83, 85, 87, 88, 88, 89, 92, 92, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100\n\nRanks:\nFemale: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.5, 10, 11.5, 13, 15 (ties are given the average rank)\nMale: 3, 7.5, 9, 11.5, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20\n\nStep 2: Calculate the sum of the ranks for each group\n\nSum of female ranks: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7.5 + 10 + 11.5 + 13 + 15 = 75\nSum of male ranks: 3 + 7.5 + 9 + 11.5 + 14 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 20 = 135\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic W\n\nW = min(Sum of female ranks, Sum of male ranks) = min(75, 135) = 75\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value for the given level of significance\n\nFor a sample size of 10 in each group and a 5% level of significance, the critical value for a two-tailed test is 40 (you can find this value in a Wilcoxon rank sum test table or use statistical software).\n\nStep 5: Compare the test statistic to the critical value\n\nSince W (75) is greater than the critical value (40), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is no significant difference between the scores of male and female students at a 5% level of significance."
