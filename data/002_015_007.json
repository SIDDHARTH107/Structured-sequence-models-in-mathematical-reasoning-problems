    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circular field, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference = π * diameter\n\nGiven that the diameter of the field is 14 meters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nCircumference = π * 14\n\nCircumference ≈ 3.14159 * 14\n\nCircumference ≈ 43.9823 meters\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the field is approximately 43.98 meters."
