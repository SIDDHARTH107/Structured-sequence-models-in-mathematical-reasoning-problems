    "message_1": "A sample of a radioactive substance has a half-life of 3 days. If the initial amount of the substance was 200 grams, find out the amount remaining after 9 days. Use the radioactive decay equation: A = A0(1/2)^(t/h) where A0 is the initial amount, A is the amount remaining after time t, h is the half-life, and t is any given time.",
    "message_2": "Given the radioactive decay equation: A = A0(1/2)^(t/h)\n\nWe have the initial amount A0 = 200 grams, the half-life h = 3 days, and we want to find the amount remaining after t = 9 days.\n\nPlugging in the values into the equation:\n\nA = 200 * (1/2)^(9/3)\n\nA = 200 * (1/2)^3\n\nA = 200 * (1/8)\n\nA = 25 grams\n\nSo, after 9 days, there will be 25 grams of the radioactive substance remaining."
