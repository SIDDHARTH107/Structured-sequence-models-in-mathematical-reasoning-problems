    "message_2": "Based on the given non-monotonic logical system, we can make the following conclusions about the birds:\n\n1. A bald eagle: Bald eagles have wings and are not listed among the exceptions (ostrich, penguin, kiwi, dodo). Therefore, according to the first rule, a bald eagle can fly.\n\n2. A chicken: Chickens have wings but are not listed among the exceptions. However, the first rule states that if a bird has wings, it can fly, but not necessarily vice versa. This means that having wings does not guarantee the ability to fly. In reality, chickens can fly short distances, but based on the given logical system, we cannot definitively conclude whether a chicken can fly or not.\n\n3. A pigeon: Pigeons have wings and are not listed among the exceptions. Therefore, according to the first rule, a pigeon can fly.\n\n4. A cassowary: Cassowaries have wings but are not listed among the exceptions. Similar to the case of the chicken, we cannot definitively conclude whether a cassowary can fly or not based on the given logical system. In reality, cassowaries are flightless birds.\n\n5. An emu: Emus are similar to ostriches, and both are flightless birds. However, since emus are not explicitly listed among the exceptions in the given logical system, we cannot definitively conclude that they cannot fly based on the system. In reality, emus cannot fly."
