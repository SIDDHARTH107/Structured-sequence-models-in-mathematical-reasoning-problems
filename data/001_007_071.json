    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x - 5 < 7, we'll follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Add 5 to both sides of the inequality.\n2x - 5 + 5 < 7 + 5\n2x < 12\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 2.\n2x/2 < 12/2\nx < 6\n\nSo the solution to the inequality is x < 6. This means that any real number less than 6 will satisfy the inequality."
