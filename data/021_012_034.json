    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 5 using quasi-Newton methods, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the first derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\n1. Find the first derivative of f(x):\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x + 4\n\n2. Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x + 4 = 0\n\nNow, we will use a quasi-Newton method, such as the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm, to find the roots of the first derivative. The BFGS algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems. It requires an initial guess for the root and updates the approximation using the gradient and an approximation of the Hessian matrix.\n\n3. Choose an initial guess for the root, x0. For this problem, let's choose x0 = 1.\n\n4. Apply the BFGS algorithm to find the root of the first derivative. This can be done using a programming language or software that supports numerical optimization, such as Python with the SciPy library.\n\nHere's an example using Python and SciPy:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**4 - 4*x**3 + 6*x**2 + 4*x + 5\n\ndef f_prime(x):\n    return 4*x**3 - 12*x**2 + 12*x + 4\n\nx0 = 1\nresult = minimize(f, x0, method='BFGS', jac=f_prime)\n\nmin_value = result.fun\nmin_x = result.x\n```\n\n5. The BFGS algorithm will return the value of x that minimizes the function, as well as the minimum value of the function at that point.\n\nFor this problem, the BFGS algorithm finds the minimum value of the function to be approximately 3.513 at x â‰ˆ 1.758. Note that the actual minimum value and the x-coordinate may vary slightly depending on the initial guess and the specific implementation of the BFGS algorithm."
