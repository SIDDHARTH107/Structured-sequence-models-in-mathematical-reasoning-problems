The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {2, 3} (intersection of A and B)\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of the symmetric difference (A △ B) and set B.\n\n(A △ B) ∩ B = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4} = {4}\n\nSo, the set (A △ B) ∩ B is {4}."
