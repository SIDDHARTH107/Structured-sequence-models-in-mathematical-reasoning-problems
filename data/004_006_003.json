    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2, we first need to find its derivative, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points.\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first try to factor it:\n\n3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0\n\n3(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nNow, we can see that the equation equals zero when x = 1 and x = 3. Therefore, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 are x = 1 and x = 3."
