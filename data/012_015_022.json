    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is connected or disconnected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 6, so a connected graph must have at least 5 edges.\n\nSince G has 8 edges, which is more than the minimum required for a connected graph, it is possible that G is connected. However, we need to check if there is any possibility of G being disconnected.\n\nA disconnected graph can be formed by having two or more connected components. Let's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. Two connected components: One possibility is having two connected components with sizes 5 and 1. The component with 5 vertices would require at least 4 edges to be connected, and the component with 1 vertex would require 0 edges. However, this would only account for 4 edges, which is less than the 8 edges in G. Therefore, this possibility is not valid.\n\n2. Three connected components: One possibility is having three connected components with sizes 4, 1, and 1. The component with 4 vertices would require at least 3 edges to be connected, and the components with 1 vertex would require 0 edges each. However, this would only account for 3 edges, which is less than the 8 edges in G. Therefore, this possibility is not valid.\n\nSince there are no valid possibilities for G to be disconnected, we can conclude that G is connected."
