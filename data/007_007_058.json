    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 7x + 11y = 125, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the general solution for x and y.\n\nFirst, we find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 7 and 11 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n11 = 1 * 7 + 4\n7 = 1 * 4 + 3\n4 = 1 * 3 + 1\n3 = 3 * 1\n\nSo, gcd(7, 11) = 1.\n\nNow, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers x and y such that:\n\n7x + 11y = gcd(7, 11) = 1\n\nWorking backwards from the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1 = 4 - 1 * 3\n1 = 4 - 1 * (7 - 1 * 4)\n1 = 2 * 4 - 1 * 7\n1 = 2 * (11 - 1 * 7) - 1 * 7\n1 = 2 * 11 - 3 * 7\n\nSo, we have found integers x and y such that:\n\n7(-3) + 11(2) = 1\n\nNow, we want to find the solution for 7x + 11y = 125. Since we have found a solution for 7x + 11y = 1, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 125:\n\n7(-3 * 125) + 11(2 * 125) = 125\n\n7(-375) + 11(250) = 125\n\nNow, we have a particular solution for the Diophantine equation:\n\nx = -375\ny = 250\n\nHowever, we want positive integer solutions. To find the general solution, we can use the following formula:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the particular solution we found, a = 7, b = 11, d = gcd(7, 11) = 1, and n is an integer.\n\nx = -375 + 11n\ny = 250 - 7n\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest positive integer n such that both x and y are positive:\n\n-375 + 11n > 0\nn > 375/11\nn > 34.09\n\nSo, the smallest integer n is 35.\n\nx = -375 + 11(35) = 10\ny = 250 - 7(35) = 5\n\nThus, the positive integer solution for the Diophantine equation 7x + 11y = 125 is x = 10 and y = 5."
