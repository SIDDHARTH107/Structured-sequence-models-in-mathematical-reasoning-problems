    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A △ B, is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection: A △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nLet's find the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n1. Find the union of A and B (A ∪ B):\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n2. Find the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B):\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\n3. Subtract the intersection from the union:\nA △ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of B and A (B △ A) and verify if it is commutative:\n\n1. Find the union of B and A (B ∪ A):\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n2. Find the intersection of B and A (B ∩ A):\nB ∩ A = {3, 4}\n\n3. Subtract the intersection from the union:\nB △ A = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nSince A △ B = {1, 2, 5, 6} and B △ A = {1, 2, 5, 6}, the symmetric difference is commutative: A △ B = B △ A."
