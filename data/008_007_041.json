    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P, we first need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the given matrix A.\n\nMatrix A:\n[2 3]\n[3 2]\n\nStep 1: Find the eigenvalues.\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI:\n[2-λ  3  ]\n[ 3  2-λ]\n\nNow, we compute the determinant:\n\n(2-λ)(2-λ) - (3)(3) = λ^2 - 4λ - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula to find the eigenvalues:\n\nλ = (4 ± √(4^2 - 4(-1)))/2 = (4 ± √20)/2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are:\n\nλ1 = (4 + √20)/2\nλ2 = (4 - √20)/2\n\nStep 2: Find the eigenvectors.\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFor λ1:\n\n[2 - (4 + √20)/2   3] [x1]   [0]\n[         3         2 - (4 + √20)/2] [x2] = [0]\n\nSimplifying the matrix:\n\n[(-√20)/2   3] [x1]   [0]\n[   3    (√20)/2] [x2] = [0]\n\nWe can solve this system of linear equations to find the eigenvector:\n\nx1 = (3/((-√20)/2))x2\nx1 = (√20)x2\n\nLet x2 = 1, then x1 = √20. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 is:\n\nv1 = [√20]\n         [  1  ]\n\nFor λ2:\n\n[2 - (4 - √20)/2   3] [x1]   [0]\n[         3         2 - (4 - √20)/2] [x2] = [0]\n\nSimplifying the matrix:\n\n[(√20)/2   3] [x1]   [0]\n[   3    (-√20)/2] [x2] = [0]\n\nWe can solve this system of linear equations to find the eigenvector:\n\nx1 = (3/((√20)/2))x2\nx1 = -√20x2\n\nLet x2 = 1, then x1 = -√20. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 is:\n\nv2 = [-√20]\n         [  1  ]\n\nStep 3: Form the matrices D and P.\nNow that we have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can form the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P.\n\nMatrix D is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues on the diagonal:\n\nD = [λ1    0 ]\n      [  0   λ2]\n\nD = [(4 + √20)/2    0 ]\n      [       0      (4 - √20)/2]\n\nMatrix P is formed by placing the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = [ √20  -√20]\n       [  1      1  ]\n\nNow, we have the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P such that P^(-1)AP = D."
