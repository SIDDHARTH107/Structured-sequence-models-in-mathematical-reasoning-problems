    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 270 and 192 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (270) by the smaller number (192) and find the remainder.\n   270 รท 192 = 1 with a remainder of 78.\n\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (192) and the smaller number with the remainder (78) from the previous step.\n   Now we need to find the GCD of 192 and 78.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (192) by the smaller number (78) and find the remainder.\n   192 รท 78 = 2 with a remainder of 36.\n\n4. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (78) and the smaller number with the remainder (36) from the previous step.\n   Now we need to find the GCD of 78 and 36.\n\n5. Divide the larger number (78) by the smaller number (36) and find the remainder.\n   78 รท 36 = 2 with a remainder of 6.\n\n6. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (36) and the smaller number with the remainder (6) from the previous step.\n   Now we need to find the GCD of 36 and 6.\n\n7. Divide the larger number (36) by the smaller number (6) and find the remainder.\n   36 รท 6 = 6 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we have reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 6. Therefore, the GCD of 270 and 192 is 6."
