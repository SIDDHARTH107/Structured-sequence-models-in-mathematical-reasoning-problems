    "message_1": "In intuitionistic logic, there is a connective called implication that is denoted by $\\rightarrow$. Let $a$ and $b$ be any two propositions. If $a \\rightarrow b$ is true, then we can infer that $b$ is also true whenever $a$ is true. \n\nFor example, let $a$ represent the proposition \"It is raining outside\" and let $b$ represent the proposition \"I will bring an umbrella\". If we know that $a \\rightarrow b$ is true, then we can infer that if it is raining outside ($a$ is true), then I will bring an umbrella ($b$) to avoid getting wet.\n\nNow, suppose that we have the following propositions:\n\n$p \\rightarrow q$\n$p$\n$r \\rightarrow s$\n\nUsing intuitionistic logic, determine whether or not we can infer that $q \\rightarrow s$ is true.",
    "message_2": "Given the propositions:\n\n1. $p \\rightarrow q$\n2. $p$\n3. $r \\rightarrow s$\n\nWe can use the Modus Ponens rule, which states that if we have $a \\rightarrow b$ and $a$, then we can infer $b$. Applying Modus Ponens to propositions 1 and 2:\n\n1. $p \\rightarrow q$\n2. $p$\n-------\n4. $q$ (from 1 and 2 using Modus Ponens)\n\nHowever, we cannot infer anything about the relationship between $q$ and $s$ based on the given propositions. We only have information about the relationship between $p$ and $q$, and between $r$ and $s$. There is no information given about any connection between $q$ and $s$ or between $p$ and $r$. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that $q \\rightarrow s$ is true based on the given propositions."
