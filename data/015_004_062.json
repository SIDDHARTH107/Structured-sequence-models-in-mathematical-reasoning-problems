    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a complex fractal shape defined by the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set is a fractal, and its area cannot be calculated using traditional geometry.\n\nHowever, it is known that the Mandelbrot set is contained within a circle with a radius of 2 centered at the origin. This is because if the magnitude of a complex number z is greater than 2, the sequence generated by iterating f(z) will diverge. Therefore, the area of the Mandelbrot set is less than or equal to the area of this circle.\n\nThe area of a circle with a radius of 2 is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius. In this case, r = 2, so the area of the circle is A = π(2)^2 = 4π ≈ 12.566 square units.\n\nThe actual area of the Mandelbrot set is estimated to be around 1.50659177 square units. This value is obtained through numerical methods and computer simulations, as there is no known closed-form expression for the area of the Mandelbrot set."
