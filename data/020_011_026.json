    "message_1": "A farmer has a field with a fixed perimeter of 100 meters. The farmer wants to maximize the area of the field by dividing it into two sections and using different crops in each section. The first type of crop yields 10 units of profit per square meter, and the second type of crop yields 20 units of profit per square meter. What is the maximum profit the farmer can obtain?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the dimensions of the first section as x and y, and the dimensions of the second section as x and (50-x). The perimeter of the field is fixed at 100 meters, so we have:\n\n2x + 2y = 100\nx + y = 50\ny = 50 - x\n\nThe area of the first section is A1 = x * y and the area of the second section is A2 = x * (50 - x). The total profit is given by:\n\nProfit = 10 * A1 + 20 * A2\n= 10 * x * y + 20 * x * (50 - x)\n\nNow, we need to maximize the profit function. To do this, we can take the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Profit)/dx = 10 * y - 20 * (50 - 2x) = 0\n\nSubstitute y = 50 - x:\n\n10 * (50 - x) - 20 * (50 - 2x) = 0\n500 - 10x - 1000 + 40x = 0\n30x = 500\nx = 500 / 30\nx ≈ 16.67\n\nNow, we can find y:\n\ny = 50 - x ≈ 50 - 16.67 ≈ 33.33\n\nThe dimensions of the first section are approximately 16.67 meters by 33.33 meters, and the dimensions of the second section are approximately 16.67 meters by (50 - 16.67) ≈ 33.33 meters.\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum profit:\n\nProfit = 10 * A1 + 20 * A2\n= 10 * (16.67 * 33.33) + 20 * (16.67 * 33.33)\n= 5556.11 + 11112.22\n= 16668.33\n\nThe maximum profit the farmer can obtain is approximately 16668.33 units."
