    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of X, we will use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. Let A and B be the interiors of the two solid tori, and let C be the boundary circle where they are glued together. Then, X = A ∪ B, and A ∩ B = C.\n\nThe fundamental group of A and B is the fundamental group of a solid torus, which is isomorphic to the fundamental group of a circle, denoted by ℤ (the integers). This is because we can retract the solid torus onto its central circle. Mathematically, this is written as:\n\nπ₁(A) ≅ π₁(B) ≅ ℤ\n\nThe intersection A ∩ B is homeomorphic to a circle, so its fundamental group is also ℤ:\n\nπ₁(A ∩ B) ≅ ℤ\n\nNow, we apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which states that the fundamental group of the union X = A ∪ B is given by the free product of the fundamental groups of A and B, quotiented by the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form i(a)i'(a)^{-1}, where i and i' are the inclusion maps of A ∩ B into A and B, respectively, and a is an element of π₁(A ∩ B).\n\nLet's denote the generators of π₁(A) and π₁(B) by a and b, respectively, and the generator of π₁(A ∩ B) by c. Then, the inclusion maps are given by:\n\ni(c) = a\ni'(c) = b\n\nThe Seifert-van Kampen theorem then gives us:\n\nπ₁(X) = (π₁(A) * π₁(B)) / ⟨i(c)i'(c)^{-1}⟩ = (ℤ * ℤ) / ⟨ab^{-1}⟩\n\nSince the relation ab^{-1} generates a normal subgroup, we can rewrite the fundamental group as:\n\nπ₁(X) = ℤ * ℤ / ⟨ab^{-1}⟩ = ℤ × ℤ\n\nThus, the fundamental group of X is isomorphic to the direct product of two copies of the integers, ℤ × ℤ."
