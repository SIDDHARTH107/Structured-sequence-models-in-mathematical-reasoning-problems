    "message_1": "At a comedy show, there are 20 people in the audience. The probability of any single person laughing during the show is 0.75. What is the probability that at least 17 people in the audience will laugh during the show?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 17 people will laugh during the show, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k successes (in this case, people laughing) out of n trials (the number of people in the audience)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, a person laughing)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of people in the audience)\n- k is the number of successes we are interested in\n\nSince we want to find the probability that at least 17 people will laugh, we need to calculate the probabilities for 17, 18, 19, and 20 people laughing and then sum these probabilities.\n\nLet's calculate these probabilities:\n\nP(X = 17) = C(20, 17) * (0.75)^17 * (0.25)^3\nP(X = 18) = C(20, 18) * (0.75)^18 * (0.25)^2\nP(X = 19) = C(20, 19) * (0.75)^19 * (0.25)^1\nP(X = 20) = C(20, 20) * (0.75)^20 * (0.25)^0\n\nNow, let's calculate the combinations:\n\nC(20, 17) = 20! / (17! * 3!) = 1140\nC(20, 18) = 20! / (18! * 2!) = 190\nC(20, 19) = 20! / (19! * 1!) = 20\nC(20, 20) = 20! / (20! * 0!) = 1\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the probability formula:\n\nP(X = 17) = 1140 * (0.75)^17 * (0.25)^3 ≈ 0.1505\nP(X = 18) = 190 * (0.75)^18 * (0.25)^2 ≈ 0.0753\nP(X = 19) = 20 * (0.75)^19 * (0.25)^1 ≈ 0.0176\nP(X = 20) = 1 * (0.75)^20 * (0.25)^0 ≈ 0.0003\n\nFinally, let's sum these probabilities to find the probability that at least 17 people will laugh:\n\nP(X ≥ 17) = P(X = 17) + P(X = 18) + P(X = 19) + P(X = 20) ≈ 0.1505 + 0.0753 + 0.0176 + 0.0003 ≈ 0.2437\n\nSo, the probability that at least 17 people in the audience will laugh during the show is approximately 0.2437 or 24.37%."
