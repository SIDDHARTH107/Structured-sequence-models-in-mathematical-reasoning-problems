    "message_1": "In the Chicken Game, two players drive cars towards each other on a narrow road. Each player can either swerve to avoid the collision or continue driving straight. If both players swerve, they both receive a reward of 1 point. If neither player swerves, then they both receive a punishment of -100 points (a huge loss). However, if one player swerves and the other does not, the player who continues driving straight receives a reward of 5 points, while the player who swerves receives a punishment of -10 points.\n\nSuppose you are playing the Chicken Game with an opponent. You have a strategy of always swerving, regardless of your opponent's action. If your opponent also has the same strategy, what will be the outcome in terms of points earned or lost?",
    "message_2": "If both you and your opponent have the same strategy of always swerving, then both of you will swerve every time. In this case, both players will receive a reward of 1 point each."
