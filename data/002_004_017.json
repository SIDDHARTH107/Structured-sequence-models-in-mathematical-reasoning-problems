    "message_1": "A rectangle has a length of 14 meters and a width of 8 meters. What is the perimeter of the rectangle in meters?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).\n\nIn this case, the length is 14 meters and the width is 8 meters. So, we have:\n\nPerimeter = 2(14 + 8)\nPerimeter = 2(22)\nPerimeter = 44 meters\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 44 meters."
