    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of 12 centimeters and a height of 8 centimeters. What is the area of the triangle in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (base × height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 12 centimeters and the height is 8 centimeters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (12 × 8) / 2\n\nArea = 96 / 2\n\nArea = 48 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 48 square centimeters."
