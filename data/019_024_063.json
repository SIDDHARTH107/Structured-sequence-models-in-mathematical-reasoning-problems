    "message_1": "Consider the following problem in abductive logic: \nJohn is three times as old as his sister. If John is 24 years old, how old is his sister?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote John's age as J and his sister's age as S. We are given that John is three times as old as his sister, which can be represented as:\n\nJ = 3S\n\nWe are also given that John is 24 years old:\n\nJ = 24\n\nNow we can substitute the value of J into the first equation:\n\n24 = 3S\n\nTo find the age of John's sister, we can now solve for S:\n\nS = 24 / 3\nS = 8\n\nSo, John's sister is 8 years old."
