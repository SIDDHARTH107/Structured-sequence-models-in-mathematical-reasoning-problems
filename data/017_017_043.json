    "message_2": "To prove that there exists no group of order 30 which is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8, we will first look at the properties of the quaternion group Q8 and then show that no group of order 30 can have these properties.\n\nThe quaternion group Q8 is a non-abelian group of order 8 with the following elements: {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k}, where i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. The group operation is quaternion multiplication.\n\nNow, let's assume there exists a group G of order 30 that is isomorphic to Q8. Let φ: Q8 → G be an isomorphism. Since Q8 has order 8, G must also have order 8, but this contradicts our assumption that G has order 30. Therefore, there cannot exist a group of order 30 that is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8."
