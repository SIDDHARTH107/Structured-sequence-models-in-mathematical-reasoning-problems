    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Peano-Gosper curve or the flowsnake, is a space-filling curve with a fractal dimension that remains constant regardless of the number of iterations or segments. To find the fractal dimension, we can use the formula:\n\nFractal dimension (D) = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Gosper curve, at each iteration, it is replaced by 7 copies of itself, so N = 7. The scaling factor S is 3, as each segment in the curve is scaled down by a factor of 3.\n\nSo, the fractal dimension of the Gosper curve is:\n\nD = log(7) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.77124\n\nThus, the fractal dimension of the Gosper curve when it is iterated to create a line with 10,000 segments is approximately 1.77124."
