    "message_2": "To solve the equation |5x - 9| = 12, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 5x - 9 â‰¥ 0\nIn this case, we can remove the absolute value sign and solve the equation as is:\n5x - 9 = 12\n5x = 21\nx = 21/5\nx = 4.2\n\nCase 2: 5x - 9 < 0\nIn this case, we need to negate the expression inside the absolute value sign before solving the equation:\n-(5x - 9) = 12\n-5x + 9 = 12\n-5x = 3\nx = -3/5\nx = -0.6\n\nSo, the two solutions for x are x = 4.2 and x = -0.6."
