    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nFor a given number n, if n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak, where p1, p2, ..., pk are distinct prime factors of n and a1, a2, ..., ak are their respective exponents, then the value of Euler's totient function can be calculated using the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nNow, let's find the value of Euler's totient function for n = 25.\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of 25. Since 25 is a perfect square, we have:\n\n25 = 5^2\n\nNow, we can apply the formula for Euler's totient function:\n\nφ(25) = 25 * (1 - 1/5)\nφ(25) = 25 * (4/5)\nφ(25) = 20\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for 25 is 20."
