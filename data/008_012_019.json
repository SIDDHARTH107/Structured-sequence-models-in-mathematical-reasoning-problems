    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the inverse matrix method, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |      X = | x |      B = | 10 |\n    | 5  6  7 |          | y |          | 20 |\n    | 8  9 10 |          | z |          | 30 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). If A^(-1) exists, we can multiply both sides of the equation AX = B by A^(-1) to get X = A^(-1)B.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = 2(6*10 - 7*9) - 3(5*10 - 7*8) + 4(5*9 - 6*8)\n       = 2(60 - 63) - 3(50 - 56) + 4(45 - 48)\n       = 2(-3) - 3(-6) + 4(-3)\n       = -6 + 18 - 12\n       = 0\n\nSince the determinant of A is 0, the inverse of matrix A does not exist. Therefore, we cannot use the inverse matrix method to solve this system of linear equations."
