    "message_2": "The set A has 3 elements: {1, 2, 3}. The size of the set A is 3.\n\nThe power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and the set A itself. In this case, P(A) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}. The size of the power set of A is 8.\n\nNow, let's prove that the power set of A is always larger than the set A itself.\n\nProof:\n\nLet A be a set with n elements. The power set of A, P(A), consists of all possible subsets of A. For each element in A, there are two possibilities: either it is in a subset or it is not. Therefore, there are 2^n possible subsets of A, which is the size of the power set of A.\n\nSince 2^n > n for all n ≥ 0, the size of the power set of A is always larger than the size of the set A itself."
