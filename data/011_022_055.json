    "message_2": "To find the maximum value that can be obtained, we need to consider the possible combinations of items that can fit in the knapsack and their corresponding values. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. One item with weight 10 and one item with weight 20 (total weight 30)\n   Value: 50 + 100 = 150\n\n2. Two items with weight 15 each (total weight 30)\n   Value: 75 + 75 = 150\n\n3. One item with weight 10 and one item with weight 15 (total weight 25, not using the full capacity)\n   Value: 50 + 75 = 125\n\nThe maximum value that can be obtained is 150, which can be achieved by either taking one item with weight 10 and one item with weight 20, or by taking two items with weight 15 each."
