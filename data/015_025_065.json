    "message_1": "Consider the forced van der Pol oscillator given by the following system of differential equation:\nx' = y\ny' = 0.1(1-x^2)y - x + 2.5cos(t)\n\nSuppose the initial conditions are x(0) = 1 and y(0) = 0. \n\n1. Find the period of the system under the influence of the forcing term (i.e., the period of the system's limit cycle).\n2. Determine the amplitude of the limit cycle.",
    "message_2": "1. To find the period of the system under the influence of the forcing term, we need to look at the forcing term itself, which is 2.5cos(t). The period of a cosine function is given by the formula T = 2π/ω, where ω is the angular frequency. In this case, ω = 1 (since the coefficient of t in the cosine function is 1). Therefore, the period of the system's limit cycle is T = 2π/1 = 2π.\n\n2. To determine the amplitude of the limit cycle, we need to perform a numerical simulation of the system, as the amplitude cannot be found analytically for the forced van der Pol oscillator. This can be done using various numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to solve the system of differential equations. By analyzing the resulting trajectory in the phase space, we can estimate the amplitude of the limit cycle. However, this is beyond the scope of a simple text-based response. You can use software like MATLAB or Python to perform the numerical simulation and estimate the amplitude of the limit cycle."
