    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth complex projective curve of genus g. Consider the space A of smooth (p,q)-forms on X. Here p+q=k. Let Hp,q be the space of harmonic forms in A, i.e., the space of forms in A that are closed and co-closed, where co-closure is taken with respect to the KÃ¤hler form on X. Suppose that X has a nonzero holomorphic p-form. Determine dim Hp,q for any p,q with p+2q = k, and show that Hp,q = 0 if p and q are not both non-negative integers. \n\nFind dim H5,5 for this curve.",
    "message_2": "Since X is a complex projective curve, it is a one-dimensional complex manifold. Therefore, the only non-trivial forms are (0,0)-, (1,0)-, and (0,1)-forms. In particular, for any (p,q)-form with p + q > 1, the space of such forms is trivial, i.e., Hp,q = 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the case p + 2q = k. Since p and q are non-negative integers, the only possible cases are (p,q) = (k,0) or (p,q) = (k-2,1). In the first case, we have (k,0)-forms, which are holomorphic k-forms. Since X has a nonzero holomorphic p-form, we know that dim Hk,0 = 1 if k = p and dim Hk,0 = 0 otherwise.\n\nIn the second case, we have (k-2,1)-forms. However, since p + q = k > 1, we have Hp,q = 0 for any (p,q) with p + q > 1. Thus, dim H(k-2),1 = 0.\n\nNow, let's find dim H5,5 for this curve. Since p + q = 10 > 1, we have H5,5 = 0, and therefore dim H5,5 = 0."
