    "message_2": "A closed, connected, and orientable surface with genus 2 is a 2-dimensional manifold. In this case, we can use the Morse inequalities to find a lower bound for the number of critical points of a Morse function on this surface.\n\nThe Morse inequalities relate the number of critical points of a Morse function on a manifold to the Betti numbers of the manifold. The Betti numbers are topological invariants that count the number of independent cycles in each dimension. For a surface of genus 2, the Betti numbers are b_0 = 1, b_1 = 4, and b_2 = 1.\n\nThe Morse inequalities are given by:\n\nF_k ≥ b_k\n\nwhere F_k is the number of critical points of index k and b_k is the k-th Betti number.\n\nFor our surface of genus 2, we have:\n\nF_0 ≥ b_0 = 1\nF_1 ≥ b_1 = 4\nF_2 ≥ b_2 = 1\n\nNow, we can find a lower bound for the total number of critical points F:\n\nF = F_0 + F_1 + F_2\n\nUsing the inequalities above, we get:\n\nF ≥ 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nSo, the lower bound for the number of critical points of a Morse function on a closed, connected, and orientable surface with genus 2 is 6."
