    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to recall the properties of the Fourier transform. Let F{f(x)} = F(k) denote the Fourier transform of f(x), then we have:\n\n1. F{f'(x)} = ikF(k)\n2. F{f''(x)} = -(k^2)F(k)\n\nNow, let's apply the Fourier transform to the given differential equation:\n\ny''(x) + 4y(x) = 0\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides, we get:\n\nF{y''(x)} + 4F{y(x)} = 0\n\nUsing the properties mentioned above, we have:\n\n-(k^2)Y(k) + 4Y(k) = 0\n\nWhere Y(k) = F{y(x)}. Now, let's solve for Y(k):\n\nY(k) (4 - k^2) = 0\n\nY(k) = 0 if (4 - k^2) ≠ 0\n\nTo find the nontrivial solution, we need to consider the case when (4 - k^2) = 0:\n\nk^2 = 4\nk = ±2\n\nNow, let's find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(k) to get y(x):\n\ny(x) = F^{-1}{Y(k)}\n\nSince Y(k) is nonzero only for k = ±2, we can write the inverse Fourier transform as a sum of delta functions:\n\nY(k) = Aδ(k - 2) + Bδ(k + 2)\n\nWhere A and B are constants. Taking the inverse Fourier transform, we get:\n\ny(x) = F^{-1}{Aδ(k - 2) + Bδ(k + 2)}\n\nUsing the linearity property of the Fourier transform, we have:\n\ny(x) = AF^{-1}{δ(k - 2)} + BF^{-1}{δ(k + 2)}\n\nRecall that F^{-1}{δ(k - a)} = (1/2π) e^(iax). Therefore,\n\ny(x) = (A/2π) e^(2ix) + (B/2π) e^(-2ix)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants A and B using the given initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 1 => (A/2π) + (B/2π) = 1\ny'(0) = 0 => (2iA/2π) - (2iB/2π) = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nA = π\nB = π\n\nThus, the solution to the given differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = (π/2) (e^(2ix) + e^(-2ix))\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can rewrite the solution in terms of cosine:\n\ny(x) = π cos(2x)"
