    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 1 between x = 1 and x = 4, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate the definite integral between the given limits.\n\nFirst, let's find the indefinite integral of f(x):\n\n∫(2x^2 + 3x - 1) dx\n\nTo integrate, we apply the power rule, which states that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), where n is a constant:\n\n∫(2x^2) dx = (2/3)x^3\n∫(3x) dx = (3/2)x^2\n∫(-1) dx = -x\n\nNow, let's add the results together and include the constant of integration, C:\n\nF(x) = (2/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 - x + C\n\nNow, we need to find the definite integral between x = 1 and x = 4:\n\n∫(2x^2 + 3x - 1) dx from 1 to 4 = F(4) - F(1)\n\nLet's evaluate F(x) at x = 4 and x = 1:\n\nF(4) = (2/3)(4^3) + (3/2)(4^2) - (4) = (2/3)(64) + (3/2)(16) - 4 = 42.67\nF(1) = (2/3)(1^3) + (3/2)(1^2) - (1) = (2/3) + (3/2) - 1 = 0.83\n\nNow, subtract F(1) from F(4):\n\nArea = F(4) - F(1) = 42.67 - 0.83 = 41.84\n\nSo, the area under the curve of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 1 between x = 1 and x = 4 is approximately 41.84 square units."
