    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x, y, z), we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient of a function is a vector of its partial derivatives with respect to each variable. In this case, we have:\n\n∇f(x, y, z) = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, ∂f/∂z)\n\nLet's find the partial derivatives of f(x, y, z) with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x - 4\n∂f/∂y = 2y - 8\n∂f/∂z = 2z - 6\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y, z) where all these partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n2x - 4 = 0 => x = 2\n2y - 8 = 0 => y = 4\n2z - 6 = 0 => z = 3\n\nSo, there is only one critical point for the function f(x, y, z), and that point is (2, 4, 3)."
