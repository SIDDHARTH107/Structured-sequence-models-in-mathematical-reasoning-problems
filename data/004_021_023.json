    "message_2": "To find the second derivative, we first need to find the first derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2.\n\nUsing the power rule, the first derivative is:\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2) = 12x^3 - 12x^2 - 24x\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative by taking the derivative of the first derivative:\nf''(x) = d/dx (12x^3 - 12x^2 - 24x) = 36x^2 - 24x - 24\n\nNow, we can find the second derivative at x = 2:\nf''(2) = 36(2)^2 - 24(2) - 24 = 36(4) - 48 - 24 = 144 - 48 - 24 = 72\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2 at x = 2 is 72."
