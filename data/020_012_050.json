    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. It costs $4 to produce one unit of A and $6 to produce one unit of B. The selling price of A is $10 and the selling price of B is $12. The company has a production capacity of 100 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce in order to maximize the total profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe profit for product A is $10 - $4 = $6 per unit, and the profit for product B is $12 - $6 = $6 per unit.\n\nThe total profit can be represented as P = 6x + 6y.\n\nThe company has a production capacity of 100 units per day, so x + y â‰¤ 100.\n\nTo maximize the total profit, we need to find the optimal values of x and y.\n\nSince the profit per unit is the same for both products ($6), the company can choose to produce any combination of product A and product B as long as the total number of units produced is 100.\n\nFor example, the company can produce 100 units of product A (x=100, y=0), or 100 units of product B (x=0, y=100), or any combination in between, such as 50 units of product A and 50 units of product B (x=50, y=50).\n\nIn all cases, the total profit will be the same: P = 6x + 6y = 6(100) = $600.\n\nSo, the company can produce any combination of product A and product B as long as the total number of units produced is 100, and the total profit will be maximized at $600."
