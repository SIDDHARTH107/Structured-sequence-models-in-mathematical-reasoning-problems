    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nIn this graph, we can see that it is composed of two 4-cycles (1-2-3-4 and 5-6-7-8) and 4 bridges connecting the two 4-cycles (1-5, 2-6, 3-7, 4-8). \n\nFor each 4-cycle, we need at least 3 colors to color the edges, as any two edges in a 4-cycle are adjacent. We can color the edges of the first 4-cycle as follows:\n\n(1,2) - color 1\n(2,3) - color 2\n(3,4) - color 3\n(4,1) - color 1\n\nSimilarly, we can color the edges of the second 4-cycle:\n\n(5,6) - color 2\n(6,7) - color 3\n(7,8) - color 1\n(8,5) - color 2\n\nNow, we need to color the bridges. Since the bridges connect vertices with different colors, we can use the colors that are not used in the adjacent edges:\n\n(1,5) - color 3\n(2,6) - color 1\n(3,7) - color 2\n(4,8) - color 3\n\nThus, we have used 3 colors to color all the edges of the graph, and no two adjacent edges share the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index of this graph is 3."
