    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = ({1, 2} ∪ {2, 3}) - {2} = {1, 3}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian products (A △ B) × A and B × (A △ B).\n\n(A △ B) × A = {1, 3} × {1, 2} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nB × (A △ B) = {2, 3} × {1, 3} = {(2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference of two sets is associative with respect to Cartesian product. For this, we need to show that (A △ B) × A ≠ B × (A △ B).\n\nComparing the two Cartesian products, we can see that they are not equal:\n\n(A △ B) × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nB × (A △ B) = {(2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)}\n\nSince (A △ B) × A ≠ B × (A △ B), we can conclude that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to Cartesian product."
