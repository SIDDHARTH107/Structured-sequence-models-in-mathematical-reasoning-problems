    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection. We need to show that for any sets A, B, and C:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) Δ (B ∩ C)\n\nLet's break down the left side of the equation:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ C = ((A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)) ∩ C\n\nNow, let's break down the right side of the equation:\n\n(A ∩ C) Δ (B ∩ C) = ((A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C)) - ((A ∩ C) ∩ (B ∩ C))\n\nTo prove that the two sides are equal, we can use the distributive property of sets:\n\n((A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)) ∩ C = ((A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C)) - ((A ∩ C) ∩ (B ∩ C))\n\nUsing the distributive property, we can rewrite the left side as:\n\n(A ∪ B) ∩ C - (A ∩ B) ∩ C\n\nNow, we can rewrite the right side as:\n\n(A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C) - (A ∩ C) ∩ (B ∩ C)\n\nNow, we can distribute the intersection on the left side:\n\n(A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C) - (A ∩ C) ∩ (B ∩ C)\n\nWe can see that both sides of the equation are equal, which proves that the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection."
