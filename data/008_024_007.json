    "message_2": "The question is precise enough. Let's solve the system of linear equations for x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are linearly dependent and represent the same plane in 3D space. Therefore, there will be infinitely many solutions for this system.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two. Let's express y in terms of x and z using the first equation:\n\n3y = 4z - 2x + 1\ny = (4z - 2x + 1)/3\n\nNow we have a parametric representation of the solution set:\n\nx = x\ny = (4z - 2x + 1)/3\nz = z\n\nThis means that for any values of x and z, we can find a corresponding value of y that satisfies the system of equations."
