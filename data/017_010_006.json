    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of an element divides the order of the group (Lagrange's theorem).\n2. A group of prime order is cyclic.\n3. If a group has a unique subgroup of a certain order, then it is normal.\n\nLet G be a group of order 10. Since 10 = 2 * 5, where 2 and 5 are prime numbers, by Cauchy's theorem, G has elements of order 2 and 5. Let a ∈ G be an element of order 2 and b ∈ G be an element of order 5.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by b, i.e., H = ⟨b⟩. Since b has order 5, H is a cyclic group of order 5, and thus H ≅ C5. Since the index of H in G is 2 (|G:H| = |G|/|H| = 10/5 = 2), H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we have three cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\nIn this case, G is a direct product of its subgroups ⟨a⟩ and H, i.e., G = ⟨a⟩ × H. Since ⟨a⟩ ≅ C2 and H ≅ C5, we have G ≅ C2 × C5 ≅ C10, which is the cyclic group of order 10.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian, and ab = ba^(-1).\nIn this case, we can define a new operation * on G by x * y = xyx^(-1). Then, G becomes a group under this operation, and we can show that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5.\n\nDefine a map φ: G → D5 such that φ(a) = r and φ(b) = s, where r and s are the standard generators of D5 (r has order 5, s has order 2, and sr = r^(-1)s). We need to show that φ is a homomorphism and is bijective.\n\nFirst, we show that φ is a homomorphism:\nφ(ab) = φ(a)φ(b) = rs = sr^(-1) = φ(ba^(-1)).\n\nNow, we show that φ is bijective:\nSince G has 10 elements, and D5 also has 10 elements, it is enough to show that φ is either injective or surjective.\n\nInjectivity: Suppose φ(x) = φ(y) for some x, y ∈ G. Then, x * y^(-1) = φ(x)φ(y^(-1)) = φ(y)φ(y^(-1)) = e, where e is the identity element. Thus, x = y, and φ is injective.\n\nSurjectivity: Since φ(a) = r and φ(b) = s, and r and s generate D5, φ is surjective.\n\nTherefore, G is isomorphic to D5.\n\nCase 3: G is non-abelian, and ab ≠ ba^(-1).\nIn this case, we can show that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10.\n\nLet c = ab. Then, c has order 10 (as a and b have relatively prime orders). We can show that G is generated by a and c, and thus G ≅ ⟨a, c⟩.\n\nNow, we can define a map ψ: G → ⟨a, c⟩ such that ψ(a) = a and ψ(b) = c. We need to show that ψ is a homomorphism and is bijective.\n\nFirst, we show that ψ is a homomorphism:\nψ(ab) = ψ(a)ψ(b) = ac = ab = ψ(ba^(-1)).\n\nNow, we show that ψ is bijective:\nSince G has 10 elements, and ⟨a, c⟩ also has 10 elements, it is enough to show that ψ is either injective or surjective.\n\nInjectivity: Suppose ψ(x) = ψ(y) for some x, y ∈ G. Then, x * y^(-1) = ψ(x)ψ(y^(-1)) = ψ(y)ψ(y^(-1)) = e, where e is the identity element. Thus, x = y, and ψ is injective.\n\nSurjectivity: Since ψ(a) = a and ψ(b) = c, and a and c generate ⟨a, c⟩, ψ is surjective.\n\nTherefore, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10.\n\nIn conclusion, any group of order 10 is isomorphic to one of the following three groups: the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10."
