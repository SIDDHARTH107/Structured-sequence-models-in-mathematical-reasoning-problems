Show that:\n\n(a) There exists an element a in G other than e such that a^2 = e.\n\n(b) There exists an element b in G such that b^3 = e.\n\n(c) If a and b are elements of G satisfying the conditions (a) and (b) above, then G is isomorphic to either C6 or D3.\n\nProvide a complete proof of the above statements, including the constructions of C6 and D3 as needed.",
    "message_2": "Proof:\n\n(a) Since G has order 6, by Cauchy's theorem, there must exist an element of order 2 in G. Let a be such an element. Then, by definition of the order of an element, a^2 = e, and a â‰  e.\n\n(b) Similarly, by Cauchy's theorem, there must exist an element of order 3 in G. Let b be such an element. Then, by definition of the order of an element, b^3 = e.\n\n(c) Let's consider the elements a and b found in parts (a) and (b). Since the order of a is 2 and the order of b is 3, and 2 and 3 are coprime, the order of the product ab must be 6 (by a well-known property of group orders). Therefore, G has an element of order 6. \n\nNow, let's consider the cyclic group C6 of order 6, generated by an element c with c^6 = e. Since the order of c is 6, it has elements of order 2 and 3 (c^3 and c^2, respectively). Thus, C6 has the same properties as G, so G could be isomorphic to C6.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the dihedral group D3 of order 6, which is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle. D3 can be generated by two elements r and s, where r is a rotation of 120 degrees, s is a reflection, r^3 = e, s^2 = e, and rs = sr^2. In this case, we can see that D3 also has elements of order 2 and 3, and G could be isomorphic to D3.\n\nSince G has elements of order 2 and 3, and we have shown that both C6 and D3 have these properties, G must be isomorphic to either C6 or D3."
