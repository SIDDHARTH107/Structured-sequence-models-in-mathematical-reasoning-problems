    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve of f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2 between x = 0 and x = 3, we will integrate the function with respect to x from 0 to 3.\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of f(x):\n\nâˆ«(x^2 + 3x + 2) dx = (1/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 + 2x + C\n\nNow, we will evaluate the antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\n[(1/3)(3)^3 + (3/2)(3)^2 + 2(3)] - [(1/3)(0)^3 + (3/2)(0)^2 + 2(0)]\n\n= [(1/3)(27) + (3/2)(9) + 6] - [0]\n\n= [9 + 13.5 + 6]\n\n= 28.5\n\nSo, the area under the curve of f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2 between x = 0 and x = 3 is 28.5 square units."
