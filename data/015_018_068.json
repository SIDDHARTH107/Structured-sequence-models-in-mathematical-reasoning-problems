    "message_1": "What is the maximum amplitude of the Duffing oscillator with initial conditions x(0) = 0.5 and v(0) = 0.1, given that the parameters of the oscillator are as follows: m = 1, b = 0.3, a = 1, and ω = 2?",
    "message_2": "The Duffing oscillator is a nonlinear oscillator described by the following differential equation:\n\nm * d²x/dt² + b * dx/dt + a * x + x³ = F₀ * cos(ω * t)\n\nwhere m is the mass, b is the damping coefficient, a is the linear stiffness, x is the displacement, t is the time, F₀ is the amplitude of the external force, and ω is the angular frequency of the external force.\n\nGiven the initial conditions x(0) = 0.5 and v(0) = 0.1, and the parameters m = 1, b = 0.3, a = 1, and ω = 2, we can find the maximum amplitude of the Duffing oscillator.\n\nHowever, the equation provided does not include the amplitude of the external force (F₀). To find the maximum amplitude, we need the value of F₀. Please provide the value of F₀ to proceed with the calculation."
