    "message_2": "To find the dot product of vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(2^2 + 5^2) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n|B| = √(3^2 + (-4)^2) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B, which can be found using the formula:\n\nA · B = (A_x * B_x) + (A_y * B_y)\n\nA · B = (2 * 3) + (5 * -4) = 6 - 20 = -14\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (-14) / (√29 * 5)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value:\n\nθ = arccos((-14) / (√29 * 5))\n\nNow that we have the angle θ, we can find the dot product of vectors A and B using the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nA · B = (√29)(5)(cos(θ))\n\nHowever, we already found the dot product of A and B using the formula A · B = (A_x * B_x) + (A_y * B_y), which is -14. So, the dot product of vectors A and B is -14."
