    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group is congruent to 1 mod p and divides the order of the group.\n\nThe prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3. Therefore, we need to find the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. One Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32 (2^5).\n2. Three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16 (2^4).\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, we have only one possibility:\n\n1. One Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3.\n\nNow, we can use the direct product of these Sylow subgroups to construct groups of order 96. We have the following cases:\n\n1. One group of order 2^5 * 3: C_32 × C_3 (cyclic)\n2. Three groups of order 2^4 * 3: C_16 × C_3, C_16 × C_6, and C_16 × (C_2 × C_3) (non-abelian)\n\nNow, let's determine which of these groups are isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2.\n\nA4 × C4 × C2 has order 2^4 * 3, so it can only be isomorphic to one of the groups in case 2. A4 has order 12 and is non-abelian, so the only possibility is the group C_16 × (C_2 × C_3), which is isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2.\n\nIn summary, there are 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 96:\n\n1. C_32 × C_3 (cyclic)\n2. C_16 × C_3 (non-abelian)\n3. C_16 × C_6 (non-abelian)\n4. C_16 × (C_2 × C_3) (non-abelian, isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2)"
