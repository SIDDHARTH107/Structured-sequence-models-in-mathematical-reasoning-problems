    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a product defect occurring on any given unit is 0.05. If a batch of 200 units is produced, what is the probability that exactly 10 units will have a product defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (defective units) in n trials (total units produced)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (defect) on a single trial (0.05)\n- n is the total number of trials (200)\n- k is the number of successes (defective units) we want to find the probability for (10)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 10) = (200C10) * (0.05^10) * (0.95^190)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 200C10:\n\n200C10 = 200! / (10!(200-10)!)\n= 200! / (10!190!)\n= 125,656,712,800 / (3,628,800 * 2,432,902,008,176,640,000)\n= 0.027\n\nNow, let's calculate (0.05^10) and (0.95^190):\n\n0.05^10 = 9.765625e-14\n0.95^190 = 0.3584859224\n\nFinally, multiply all the values together:\n\nP(X = 10) = 0.027 * 9.765625e-14 * 0.3584859224\nP(X = 10) â‰ˆ 0.000948\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 10 defective units in a batch of 200 is approximately 0.000948 or 0.0948%."
