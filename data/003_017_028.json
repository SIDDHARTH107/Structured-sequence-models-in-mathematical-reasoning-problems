    "message_1": "A student is measuring the oscillations of a pendulum and records the following displacement values in meters: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1. If the displacement can be modeled by the equation d(t) = 0.4sin(t) where t is in seconds, what is the average displacement of the pendulum over the first 10 seconds?",
    "message_2": "To find the average displacement of the pendulum over the first 10 seconds, we need to integrate the displacement function d(t) = 0.4sin(t) over the interval [0, 10] and then divide by the length of the interval (10 seconds).\n\nThe integral of 0.4sin(t) with respect to t is -0.4cos(t) + C, where C is the constant of integration. We don't need to worry about C in this case since we are finding a definite integral.\n\nNow we need to evaluate the integral at the bounds 0 and 10:\n\n-0.4cos(10) - (-0.4cos(0)) = -0.4cos(10) + 0.4cos(0) = -0.4cos(10) + 0.4\n\nNow we divide by the length of the interval (10 seconds) to find the average displacement:\n\n(-0.4cos(10) + 0.4) / 10 â‰ˆ 0.039\n\nSo the average displacement of the pendulum over the first 10 seconds is approximately 0.039 meters."
