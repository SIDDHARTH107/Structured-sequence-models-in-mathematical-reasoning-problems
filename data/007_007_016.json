    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions of the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$, we can start by listing all possible values of $x$ and $y$ that are integers and whose squares sum up to 25.\n\n1. If $x = 0$, then $y^2 = 25$, which gives us $y = 5$ or $y = -5$. So, we have two solutions: $(0, 5)$ and $(0, -5)$.\n2. If $x = 1$, then $y^2 = 24$, which gives us $y = \\sqrt{24}$ or $y = -\\sqrt{24}$. However, $\\sqrt{24}$ is not an integer, so there are no solutions for $x = 1$.\n3. If $x = 2$, then $y^2 = 21$, which gives us $y = \\sqrt{21}$ or $y = -\\sqrt{21}$. Again, $\\sqrt{21}$ is not an integer, so there are no solutions for $x = 2$.\n4. If $x = 3$, then $y^2 = 16$, which gives us $y = 4$ or $y = -4$. So, we have two solutions: $(3, 4)$ and $(3, -4)$.\n5. If $x = 4$, then $y^2 = 9$, which gives us $y = 3$ or $y = -3$. So, we have two solutions: $(4, 3)$ and $(4, -3)$.\n6. If $x = 5$, then $y^2 = 0$, which gives us $y = 0$. So, we have one solution: $(5, 0)$.\n\nSince the equation is symmetric with respect to $x$ and $y$, we can also find the solutions for negative values of $x$ by swapping the coordinates of the solutions we found for positive values of $x$. This gives us the solutions $(-5, 0)$, $(-4, 3)$, $(-4, -3)$, $(-3, 4)$, and $(-3, -4)$.\n\nIn summary, the integer solutions of the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ are:\n\n$(0, 5)$, $(0, -5)$, $(3, 4)$, $(3, -4)$, $(4, 3)$, $(4, -3)$, $(5, 0)$, $(-5, 0)$, $(-4, 3)$, $(-4, -3)$, $(-3, 4)$, and $(-3, -4)$."
