    "message_1": "A circle has a radius of 10 cm. What is the perimeter of a sector with a central angle of 60 degrees?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector with a central angle of 60 degrees, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc (s) is:\n\ns = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, θ = 60 degrees and r = 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (60/360) × 2 × 3.14159 × 10\ns = (1/6) × 62.8318\ns ≈ 10.47198 cm\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii to the length of the arc to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = s + 2r\nPerimeter = 10.47198 + 2 × 10\nPerimeter ≈ 30.47198 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector with a central angle of 60 degrees and a radius of 10 cm is approximately 30.47 cm."
