    "message_2": "To find the boat's velocity relative to the ground, we need to add the velocity of the boat relative to the water and the velocity of the current.\n\nLet Vb represent the velocity of the boat relative to the water, Vc represent the velocity of the current, and Vg represent the velocity of the boat relative to the ground.\n\nVb = 12 km/h due east\nVc = 4 km/h at 60° north of east\n\nWe can break down the velocity of the current into its eastward and northward components using trigonometry.\n\nVc_east = Vc * cos(60°) = 4 km/h * (1/2) = 2 km/h\nVc_north = Vc * sin(60°) = 4 km/h * (√3/2) = 2√3 km/h\n\nNow, we can add the eastward and northward components of the boat's velocity and the current's velocity to find the boat's velocity relative to the ground.\n\nVg_east = Vb_east + Vc_east = 12 km/h + 2 km/h = 14 km/h\nVg_north = Vb_north + Vc_north = 0 km/h + 2√3 km/h = 2√3 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the boat's velocity relative to the ground using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nVg_magnitude = √(Vg_east^2 + Vg_north^2) = √((14 km/h)^2 + (2√3 km/h)^2) = √(196 + 12) = √208 ≈ 14.42 km/h\n\nTo find the direction of the boat's velocity relative to the ground, we can use the arctangent function.\n\nVg_direction = arctan(Vg_north / Vg_east) = arctan(2√3 / 14) ≈ 16.26° north of east\n\nSo, the boat's velocity relative to the ground has a magnitude of approximately 14.42 km/h and a direction of approximately 16.26° north of east."
