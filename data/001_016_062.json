    "message_2": "First, we need to simplify the exponential expression:\n\n2^3 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8\n3^2 = 3 × 3 = 9\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the expression:\n\n8 × 9 ÷ 6\n\nNext, we can perform the multiplication:\n\n72 ÷ 6\n\nFinally, we can perform the division:\n\n72 ÷ 6 = 12\n\nSo, the answer is 12."
