    "message_1": "A statistics professor wants to estimate the average score of her students on an exam. She randomly selects a sample of 25 students and finds that the average score of the sample is 82, with a standard deviation of 7. Assuming a normal distribution, what is the 98% confidence interval for the true mean score of all the students?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 98% confidence interval for the true mean score of all the students, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Z-score * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nHere, the sample mean is 82, the standard deviation is 7, and the sample size is 25. For a 98% confidence interval, the Z-score is approximately 2.33 (you can find this value in a Z-score table or using a calculator).\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\n\nConfidence Interval = 82 ± (2.33 * (7 / √25))\nConfidence Interval = 82 ± (2.33 * (7 / 5))\nConfidence Interval = 82 ± (2.33 * 1.4)\nConfidence Interval = 82 ± 3.262\n\nSo, the 98% confidence interval for the true mean score of all the students is approximately (78.738, 85.262). This means that we can be 98% confident that the true mean score of all the students lies between 78.738 and 85.262."
