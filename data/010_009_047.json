    "message_2": "A triangulation of a cube means dividing the cube into non-overlapping tetrahedra (a polyhedron with four triangular faces) using only the vertices of the cube. \n\nA cube has 8 vertices and 12 edges. To find the minimum number of edges required for a triangulation, we need to determine the minimum number of tetrahedra needed to fill the cube.\n\nWe can fill the cube with 5 tetrahedra, and this is the minimum number of tetrahedra needed. To see this, consider the following process:\n\n1. Divide the cube into two equal halves by cutting it along a plane parallel to two opposite faces. Each half is a triangular prism with 6 vertices, 9 edges, and 5 faces.\n2. Each triangular prism can be divided into 3 tetrahedra by connecting one of the vertices of the triangular base to the other two vertices of the opposite triangular face.\n\nSo, we have 5 tetrahedra in total. Now, let's count the number of edges required for this triangulation.\n\nEach tetrahedron has 6 edges. Since we have 5 tetrahedra, we might think that we need 5 * 6 = 30 edges. However, some of the edges are shared between adjacent tetrahedra. In our construction, each of the 9 edges of the triangular prisms is shared by 2 tetrahedra, so we need to subtract these shared edges to avoid counting them twice.\n\nThus, the minimum number of edges required for a triangulation of a cube is:\n\n(5 * 6) - (2 * 9) = 30 - 18 = 12 edges."
