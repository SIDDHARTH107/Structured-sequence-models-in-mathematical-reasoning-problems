    "message_1": "A metal rod has a length of 10 cm and a cross-sectional area of 1 cm². The rod is insulated on all sides except the ends. If one end is maintained at a temperature of 100 °C and the other end at 0 °C, what is the steady state temperature distribution along the rod? Use the Fourier transform to solve this heat transfer problem, assuming the rod has a thermal conductivity of 50 W/mK and a specific heat of 0.5 J/gK.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state temperature distribution along the rod, we can use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂x = -q/(k*A)\n\nwhere T is the temperature, x is the position along the rod, q is the heat flux, k is the thermal conductivity, and A is the cross-sectional area.\n\nSince the rod is insulated on all sides except the ends, the heat flux q is constant along the rod. The boundary conditions are T(0) = 100 °C and T(10) = 0 °C. We can integrate the heat conduction equation to find the temperature distribution:\n\n∫(∂T/∂x) dx = -∫(q/(k*A)) dx\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\nT(x) = -q/(k*A) * x + C\n\nNow we can apply the boundary conditions to find the constants q and C:\n\nT(0) = 100 °C => 100 = -q/(50*1) * 0 + C => C = 100\nT(10) = 0 °C => 0 = -q/(50*1) * 10 + 100\n\nSolving for q, we get:\n\nq = 50 * 1 * 10\n\nSo the temperature distribution along the rod is:\n\nT(x) = -50 * 1 * 10 / (50 * 1) * x + 100\nT(x) = -10x + 100\n\nThis equation gives the steady-state temperature distribution along the rod. For any position x (in cm) between 0 and 10, you can find the temperature T(x) at that position."
