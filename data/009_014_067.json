    "message_2": "The logistic growth model is given by the equation:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) * e^(-r*t) / P0)\n\nwhere:\nP(t) is the population size at time t\nK is the carrying capacity (50,000 birds in this case)\nP0 is the initial population size (10,000 birds in this case)\nr is the growth rate (0.3 in this case)\nt is the time in years (5 years in this case)\ne is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nWe want to find P(5), the population size after 5 years. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\nP(5) = 50,000 / (1 + (50,000 - 10,000) * e^(-0.3 * 5) / 10,000)\n\nP(5) = 50,000 / (1 + 40,000 * e^(-1.5) / 10,000)\n\nP(5) = 50,000 / (1 + 4 * e^(-1.5))\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of e^(-1.5):\n\ne^(-1.5) ≈ 0.22313\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nP(5) = 50,000 / (1 + 4 * 0.22313)\n\nP(5) = 50,000 / (1 + 0.89252)\n\nP(5) = 50,000 / 1.89252\n\nP(5) ≈ 26,410.67\n\nAfter 5 years, the population size is approximately 26,411 birds."
