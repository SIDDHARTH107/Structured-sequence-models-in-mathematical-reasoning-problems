    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$, we need to apply the exterior derivative to each term of the given differential form $\\omega$. Recall that the exterior derivative of a differential form is a linear operation, and it satisfies the following properties:\n\n1. $d(\\alpha + \\beta) = d\\alpha + d\\beta$ for any differential forms $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n2. $d(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = d\\alpha \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^p \\alpha \\wedge d\\beta$ for any $p$-form $\\alpha$ and any differential form $\\beta$.\n\nNow, let's compute the exterior derivative of each term in $\\omega$:\n\n1. For the first term, $x^2 dy \\wedge dz$:\n$$\nd(x^2 dy \\wedge dz) = d(x^2) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = (2x dx) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n\n2. For the second term, $-yz dx \\wedge dy$:\n$$\nd(-yz dx \\wedge dy) = d(-yz) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy = (-y dz - z dy) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n\n3. For the third term, $xyz dy \\wedge dz$:\n$$\nd(xyz dy \\wedge dz) = d(xyz) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = (xz dy + yz dx) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$ by summing up the exterior derivatives of each term:\n\n$$\nd\\omega = (2x dx) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + (-y dz - z dy) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy + (xz dy + yz dx) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression by rearranging the terms:\n\n$$\nd\\omega = 2x dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz - y dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy - z dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dy + xz dy \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + yz dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n\nNotice that the term $xz dy \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$ is zero since $dy \\wedge dy = 0$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$\nd\\omega = 2x dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz - y dz \\wedge dx \\wedge dy - z dy \\wedge dx \\wedge dy + yz dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n\nThis is the exterior derivative of the given differential form $\\omega$."
