    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of a graph G, we use the formula:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_G-e(x, y) + T_G/e(x, y) if e is a bridge in G,\nT_G(x, y) = xT_G-e(x, y) + yT_G/e(x, y) if e is a loop in G,\nT_G(x, y) = (x-1)T_G-e(x, y) + (y-1)T_G/e(x, y) if e is neither a bridge nor a loop in G.\n\nHere, G-e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n\nHowever, the Tutte polynomial is not unique for a graph with a given number of vertices and edges. The Tutte polynomial depends on the specific structure of the graph, such as the number of connected components, cycles, and bridges.\n\nFor example, consider two different graphs with 5 vertices and 7 edges:\n\n1. A complete graph K_5 with an additional edge (a loop) at one vertex. In this case, the Tutte polynomial is T(x, y) = x^4y^3 + x^3y^4.\n\n2. A graph with a cycle of length 4 and a pendant vertex connected to one of the vertices in the cycle, with two additional edges (loops) at two vertices. In this case, the Tutte polynomial is T(x, y) = x^3y^4 + x^2y^5.\n\nTherefore, without knowing the specific structure of the graph, it is impossible to determine its Tutte polynomial."
