    "message_1": "What is the mathematical formula to calculate the maximum angle reached by the second pendulum of a double pendulum system with arm lengths of 1 meter and masses of 1 kg each, when released from a horizontal position with an initial angular displacement of 30 degrees? Note that the gravitational acceleration constant is 9.81 m/s².",
    "message_2": "The double pendulum system is a complex and chaotic system, and there is no simple closed-form solution to calculate the maximum angle reached by the second pendulum. However, we can write down the equations of motion for the double pendulum system and then solve them numerically to find the maximum angle.\n\nLet θ1 and θ2 be the angles of the first and second pendulums, respectively, with respect to the vertical. The equations of motion for the double pendulum system can be derived using the Lagrangian method and are given by:\n\n(1) (m1 + m2) * L1² * θ1'' + m2 * L1 * L2 * θ2'' * cos(θ1 - θ2) + m2 * L1 * L2 * (θ2')² * sin(θ1 - θ2) + (m1 + m2) * g * L1 * sin(θ1) = 0\n\n(2) L2 * θ2'' + L1 * θ1'' * cos(θ1 - θ2) - L1 * (θ1')² * sin(θ1 - θ2) + g * sin(θ2) = 0\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the pendulums, L1 and L2 are the lengths of the pendulums, g is the gravitational acceleration constant (9.81 m/s²), and θ1'' and θ2'' are the second derivatives of θ1 and θ2 with respect to time (angular accelerations).\n\nGiven the initial conditions (θ1 = 30 degrees, θ2 = 0, θ1' = 0, θ2' = 0), you can solve these equations numerically using a suitable numerical method, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to find the time evolution of θ1 and θ2. Then, you can find the maximum angle reached by the second pendulum (θ2) during the motion."
