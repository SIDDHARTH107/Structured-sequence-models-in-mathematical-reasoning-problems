    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is generated by repeatedly applying a specific set of rules to an initial equilateral triangle. With each iteration, the perimeter of the curve increases.\n\nFor the first iteration, the perimeter is multiplied by 3/2. For each subsequent iteration, the perimeter is multiplied by 4/3. Therefore, after seven iterations, the perimeter can be calculated as follows:\n\nInitial perimeter: 12 units\n1st iteration: 12 * (3/2) = 18 units\n2nd iteration: 18 * (4/3) = 24 units\n3rd iteration: 24 * (4/3) = 32 units\n4th iteration: 32 * (4/3) = 42.6667 units\n5th iteration: 42.6667 * (4/3) = 56.8889 units\n6th iteration: 56.8889 * (4/3) = 75.8519 units\n7th iteration: 75.8519 * (4/3) = 101.1359 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after seven iterations is approximately 101.1359 units."
