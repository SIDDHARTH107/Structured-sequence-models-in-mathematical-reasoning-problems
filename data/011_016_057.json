    "message_2": "In a round-robin tournament, each player plays against every other player exactly once. We can use the combination formula to find the total number of games played. The combination formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of players, k is the number of players in each game (which is 2 for a soccer match), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nIn this case, we have 10 players (n = 10) and 2 players in each game (k = 2). Plugging these values into the combination formula, we get:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n= 10! / (2!8!)\n= (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1)(8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n= (10 × 9) / (2 × 1)\n= 45\n\nSo, a total of 45 games will be played in the round-robin tournament."
