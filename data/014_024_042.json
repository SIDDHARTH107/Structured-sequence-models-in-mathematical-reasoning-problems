    "message_1": "In a Caesar cipher, the letter \"A\" is encrypted as \"D\", \"B\" as \"E\", and so on. If a message in Caesar cipher reads \"Lw fdqw Zduudub\", what is the original message?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to shift the letters back by the same number of positions used for encryption. In this case, the shift is 3 positions back.\n\nL -> I\nw -> t\n(space)\nf -> c\nd -> a\nq -> n\nw -> t\n(space)\nZ -> W\nd -> a\nr -> o\nr -> o\nn -> k\na -> x\nb -> y\n\nSo, the original message is \"It cant Wookxy\". However, it seems there might be a mistake in the encrypted message, as \"Wookxy\" doesn't form a coherent word. If the encrypted message was \"Lw fdqw Zrunqlq\", the decrypted message would be \"It cant Working\", which makes more sense."
