    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of length 6 cm and a hypotenuse of length 10 cm. What is the length of the perpendicular side using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the base a, the perpendicular side b, and the hypotenuse c. We are given:\n\na = 6 cm\nc = 10 cm\n\nWe need to find the length of b. According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n(6 cm)^2 + b^2 = (10 cm)^2\n\n36 cm^2 + b^2 = 100 cm^2\n\nNow, subtract 36 cm^2 from both sides of the equation:\n\nb^2 = 64 cm^2\n\nTo find the length of b, take the square root of both sides:\n\nb = âˆš(64 cm^2)\n\nb = 8 cm\n\nSo, the length of the perpendicular side is 8 cm."
