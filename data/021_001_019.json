    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Write down the augmented matrix of the system.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n3. Perform back substitution to find the values of the variables.\n\nLet's start with step 1: Write down the augmented matrix of the system.\n\nThe augmented matrix is:\n\n|  2   1  -1 |  8 |\n| -3  -2   4 | -2 |\n| -1  0.5 -1 |  0 |\n\nNow, let's move to step 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n\nFirst, we'll eliminate the -3 in the second row and the -1 in the third row by adding multiples of the first row to the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 + (3/2)R1\nR3 = R3 + (1/2)R1\n\nThe new matrix is:\n\n|  2    1   -1 |  8  |\n|  0   -0.5  2 |  10 |\n|  0    1   -1.5|  4  |\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the 1 in the third row by adding a multiple of the second row to the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - 2R2\n\nThe new matrix is:\n\n|  2    1   -1 |  8  |\n|  0   -0.5  2 |  10 |\n|  0    0    3 |  24 |\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n\nFinally, let's move to step 3: Perform back substitution to find the values of the variables.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n\n3z = 24\nz = 8\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n\n-0.5y + 2z = 10\n-0.5y + 2(8) = 10\n-0.5y + 16 = 10\n-0.5y = -6\ny = 12\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\n2x + y - z = 8\n2x + 12 - 8 = 8\n2x + 4 = 8\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nSo, the values of the variables are:\n\nx = 2\ny = 12\nz = 8"
