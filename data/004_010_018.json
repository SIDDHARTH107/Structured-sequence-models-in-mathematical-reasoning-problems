    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives. The power rule states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately:\n\n1. Antiderivative of 3x^2:\nUsing the power rule, n = 2, so the antiderivative is (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3.\n\n2. Antiderivative of -4x:\nUsing the power rule, n = 1, so the antiderivative is (-4x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (-4x^2)/2 = -2x^2.\n\n3. Antiderivative of 5:\nSince 5 is a constant, its antiderivative is 5x (as the derivative of 5x with respect to x is 5).\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration (C):\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x + C."
