    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = |x| on the interval -π < x < π, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since f(x) is an even function, all b_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the a_n coefficients.\n\nThe formula for the a_n coefficients is given by:\n\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * π * x / L)] dx, from -L to L\n\nIn our case, L = π. So, the formula becomes:\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[|x| * cos(n * x)] dx, from -π to π\n\nNow, we need to solve this integral. Since |x| is an even function, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\na_n = (4/π) * ∫[x * cos(n * x)] dx, from 0 to π\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x, dv = cos(n * x) dx\nThen, du = dx, v = (1/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫[u * dv] = u * v - ∫[v * du]\n\na_n = (4/π) * [x * (1/n) * sin(n * x) - ∫[(1/n) * sin(n * x) dx]], from 0 to π\n\nNow, integrate (1/n) * sin(n * x) with respect to x:\n\n∫[(1/n) * sin(n * x) dx] = (-1/n^2) * cos(n * x)\n\nSo, the expression for a_n becomes:\n\na_n = (4/π) * [x * (1/n) * sin(n * x) + (1/n^2) * cos(n * x)], from 0 to π\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this expression at the limits 0 and π:\n\na_n = (4/π) * [(π * (1/n) * sin(n * π) + (1/n^2) * cos(n * π)) - (0 * (1/n) * sin(0) + (1/n^2) * cos(0))]\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, the first term becomes 0:\n\na_n = (4/π) * [(1/n^2) * (cos(n * π) - 1)]\n\nNow, we have the expression for the a_n coefficients. The Fourier series for f(x) = |x| is given by:\n\nf(x) = (a_0 / 2) + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x)], from n = 1 to infinity\n\nSubstituting the expression for a_n:\n\nf(x) = (4/π) * [(1/2) + Σ[((1/n^2) * (cos(n * π) - 1)) * cos(n * x)]], from n = 1 to infinity\n\nNow, let's determine whether the series converges pointwise or uniformly. Since f(x) = |x| is continuous and piecewise differentiable on the interval -π < x < π, its Fourier series converges pointwise to f(x) on this interval.\n\nHowever, f(x) = |x| is not continuously differentiable on the entire interval -π < x < π, as it has a sharp corner at x = 0. Therefore, the Fourier series does not converge uniformly on the interval -π < x < π.\n\nIn conclusion, the Fourier series of f(x) = |x| on the interval -π < x < π is given by:\n\nf(x) = (4/π) * [(1/2) + Σ[((1/n^2) * (cos(n * π) - 1)) * cos(n * x)]], from n = 1 to infinity\n\nAnd the series converges pointwise but not uniformly on the interval -π < x < π."
