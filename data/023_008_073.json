    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n, we first need to compute the Fourier series for the given function f(x) = x^2 over the interval -π ≤ x ≤ π. The Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nωx) + b_n * sin(nωx)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π/L, and L is the length of the interval (in this case, L = π - (-π) = 2π). The coefficients a_n and b_n can be computed using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x)dx] from -L/2 to L/2\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nωx) dx] from -L/2 to L/2\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nωx) dx] from -L/2 to L/2\n\nFirst, let's compute a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/2π) * ∫[x^2 dx] from -π to π\na_0 = (1/2π) * [(1/3)x^3] from -π to π\na_0 = (1/2π) * [(1/3)π^3 - (1/3)(-π)^3] = (1/2π) * (2/3)π^3 = π^2/3\n\nNow, let's compute a_n for n = 1, 2:\n\na_n = (2/2π) * ∫[x^2 * cos(nωx) dx] from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[x^2 * cos(nx) dx] from -π to π\n\nUsing integration by parts twice, we find that:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(2/n^2) * (π^2 * cos(nπ) - π * sin(nπ) + n^2 * sin(nπ))] from -π to π\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(2/n^2) * (π^2 * (-1)^n)] for n = 1, 2\na_1 = (1/π) * [(2/1^2) * (π^2 * (-1)^1)] = -2π\na_2 = (1/π) * [(2/2^2) * (π^2 * (-1)^2)] = π/2\n\nFinally, let's compute b_n for n = 1, 2:\n\nb_n = (2/2π) * ∫[x^2 * sin(nωx) dx] from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[x^2 * sin(nx) dx] from -π to π\n\nUsing integration by parts twice, we find that:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(2/n^3) * (2π^2 * sin(nπ) - 4π * cos(nπ) + 4n^2 * cos(nπ))] from -π to π\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 and cos(nπ) = (-1)^n for all integer values of n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(2/n^3) * (4n^2 * (-1)^n)] for n = 1, 2\nb_1 = (1/π) * [(2/1^3) * (4 * (-1)^1)] = -8/π\nb_2 = (1/π) * [(2/2^3) * (4 * 2^2 * (-1)^2)] = 4/π\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients are:\n\na_0 = π^2/3\na_1 = -2π\na_2 = π/2\nb_1 = -8/π\nb_2 = 4/π"
