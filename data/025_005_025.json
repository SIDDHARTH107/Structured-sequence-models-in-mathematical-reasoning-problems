    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety V, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to x, y, and z, and then find the points where all three partial derivatives vanish simultaneously.\n\nThe defining equation of V is:\nF(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n∂F/∂x = 3x^2\n∂F/∂y = 3y^2\n∂F/∂z = 3z^2\n\nA point (x, y, z) is singular if all three partial derivatives vanish simultaneously, i.e., ∂F/∂x = ∂F/∂y = ∂F/∂z = 0. From the partial derivatives, we have:\n\n3x^2 = 0 => x = 0\n3y^2 = 0 => y = 0\n3z^2 = 0 => z = 0\n\nThe only point that satisfies all three conditions is the origin (0, 0, 0). Now, we need to check if this point lies on the variety V. Plugging x = y = z = 0 into the defining equation, we get:\n\nF(0, 0, 0) = 0^3 + 0^3 + 0^3 = 0\n\nSince F(0, 0, 0) = 0, the origin (0, 0, 0) lies on the variety V. Therefore, the origin is a singular point of the algebraic variety V.\n\nTo prove that the origin is a singular point, we need to show that the rank of the Jacobian matrix of F at the origin is less than the dimension of the variety. The Jacobian matrix J(F) is given by:\n\nJ(F) = | ∂F/∂x  ∂F/∂y  ∂F/∂z |\n\nAt the origin (0, 0, 0), the Jacobian matrix becomes:\n\nJ(F)|_(0,0,0) = | 0  0  0 |\n\nThe rank of this matrix is 0, which is less than the dimension of the variety V (which is 2, since V is a surface in 3-dimensional space). Therefore, the origin (0, 0, 0) is a singular point of the algebraic variety V."
