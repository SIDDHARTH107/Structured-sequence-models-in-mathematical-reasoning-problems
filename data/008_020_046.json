    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation, and multiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting it from the third equation.\n\n$$\\begin{cases} 2x-3y+z=1 \\\\ (4x-5y+2z)-(2(2x-3y+z))=2-2(1) \\\\ (6x-7y+4z)-(3(2x-3y+z))=4-3(1) \\end{cases}$$\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\n$$\\begin{cases} 2x-3y+z=1 \\\\ -y=-1 \\\\ -y=-1 \\end{cases}$$\n\nNow we can see that the second and third equations are the same, which means the system of equations has infinitely many solutions. To find the general solution, we can substitute the value of y from the second equation into the first equation:\n\n$$2x - 3(-1) + z = 1$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$2x + 3 + z = 1$$\n\nNow, we can express x in terms of z:\n\n$$2x = -2 - z$$\n$$x = -1 - \\frac{1}{2}z$$\n\nThe general solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\n$$\\begin{cases} x = -1 - \\frac{1}{2}z \\\\ y = 1 \\\\ z = z \\end{cases}$$\n\nWhere z can be any real number."
