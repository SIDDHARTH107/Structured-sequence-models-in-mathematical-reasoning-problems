    "message_1": "Let (M, ω) be a symplectic manifold, where M is a compact smooth manifold of dimension n and ω is a non-degenerate closed two-form on M. Suppose that φ is a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of (M, ω) with Hamiltonian function H such that H has exactly k non-degenerate critical points on M. \n\nIf k = n - 3, what is the maximum possible dimension of the image of M under φ?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given information and use the properties of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and symplectic manifolds to find the maximum possible dimension of the image of M under φ.\n\nFirst, recall that a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism is a diffeomorphism that preserves the symplectic form ω, i.e., φ*ω = ω, where φ* denotes the pullback of φ. Also, the Hamiltonian function H generates the Hamiltonian vector field X_H, which is defined by the equation ω(X_H, Y) = dH(Y) for any vector field Y on M.\n\nNow, since H has exactly k = n - 3 non-degenerate critical points, we know that the Morse index of H, which is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of H at a critical point, varies between 0 and n - 3. In particular, there exists at least one critical point with Morse index 0, which corresponds to a local minimum of H, and at least one critical point with Morse index n - 3, which corresponds to a local maximum of H.\n\nConsider the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field X_H, which is generated by the Hamiltonian function H. The flow lines of X_H connect the critical points of H, and the flow preserves the symplectic form ω. In particular, the flow takes the local minimum of H to the local maximum of H along a flow line.\n\nNow, let's analyze the image of M under the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism φ. Since φ preserves the symplectic form ω, it also preserves the volume form associated with ω, which is given by the top exterior power of ω, i.e., ω^(n/2), where n is the dimension of M. This implies that the image of M under φ has the same volume as M itself.\n\nFurthermore, since the flow of X_H takes the local minimum of H to the local maximum of H along a flow line, the image of M under φ must contain the flow line connecting these two critical points. In particular, the image of M under φ must have dimension at least 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum possible dimension of the image of M under φ. Since φ is a diffeomorphism, it is a smooth bijection between M and its image. Therefore, the dimension of the image of M under φ cannot be greater than the dimension of M itself, which is n.\n\nThus, the maximum possible dimension of the image of M under φ is n."
