    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. To find the smallest Sophie Germain prime greater than 50, we can start by checking prime numbers greater than 50 and see if 2p + 1 is also prime.\n\nThe first prime number greater than 50 is 53. Let's check if 2(53) + 1 is prime:\n\n2(53) + 1 = 106 + 1 = 107\n\n107 is a prime number. Therefore, the smallest Sophie Germain prime greater than 50 is 53."
