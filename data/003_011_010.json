Using trigonometry, find the distance from the top of the tree to the top of the building assuming that the angle of elevation from the ground to the top of the tree is 35 degrees and the angle of elevation from the ground to the top of the building is 60 degrees.",
    "message_2": "To find the distance from the top of the tree to the top of the building, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the distance from the ground to the top of the building.\n2. Find the distance from the ground to the top of the tree.\n3. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between the top of the tree and the top of the building.\n\nStep 1: Find the distance from the ground to the top of the building.\nWe can use the tangent function to find the height of the building.\ntan(angle) = opposite/adjacent\n\nLet's denote the height of the building as Hb.\ntan(60) = Hb/30\n√3 = Hb/30\nHb = 30√3\n\nStep 2: Find the distance from the ground to the top of the tree.\nWe already know the height of the tree, which is 15 meters.\n\nStep 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between the top of the tree and the top of the building.\nLet's denote the distance between the top of the tree and the top of the building as D.\nD^2 = (30^2) + (Hb - 15)^2\nD^2 = (30^2) + (30√3 - 15)^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of D^2:\nD^2 = (30^2) + (30√3 - 15)^2\nD^2 = 900 + (90 - 15)^2\nD^2 = 900 + (75)^2\nD^2 = 900 + 5625\n\nD^2 = 6525\n\nNow, we can find the value of D by taking the square root of D^2:\nD = √6525\nD ≈ 80.77\n\nSo, the distance from the top of the tree to the top of the building is approximately 80.77 meters."
