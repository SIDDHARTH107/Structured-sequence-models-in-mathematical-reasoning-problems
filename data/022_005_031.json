    "message_1": "A math student is asked to find the residue of the function f(z) = e^(2z)/(z^3 − 1) at z = 1. \n\nWhat is the value of the residue using the formula: \nRes(f(z);1) = 1/(2!)(d^2/dz^2)[(z − 1)^2 f(z)]|z=1.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the second derivative of (z - 1)^2 * f(z) with respect to z.\n\nf(z) = e^(2z) / (z^3 - 1)\n\nNow, let's multiply f(z) by (z - 1)^2:\n\ng(z) = (z - 1)^2 * f(z) = (z - 1)^2 * e^(2z) / (z^3 - 1)\n\nNow we need to find the second derivative of g(z) with respect to z:\n\ng'(z) = d/dz [(z - 1)^2 * e^(2z) / (z^3 - 1)]\n\nTo find g'(z), we can use the quotient rule and chain rule:\n\ng'(z) = [(z^3 - 1) * d/dz((z - 1)^2 * e^(2z)) - (z - 1)^2 * e^(2z) * d/dz(z^3 - 1)] / (z^3 - 1)^2\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of (z - 1)^2 * e^(2z):\n\nd/dz((z - 1)^2 * e^(2z)) = 2(z - 1) * e^(2z) + (z - 1)^2 * 2 * e^(2z)\n\nAnd the derivative of (z^3 - 1):\n\nd/dz(z^3 - 1) = 3z^2\n\nNow, substitute these derivatives back into g'(z):\n\ng'(z) = [(z^3 - 1) * (2(z - 1) * e^(2z) + (z - 1)^2 * 2 * e^(2z)) - (z - 1)^2 * e^(2z) * 3z^2] / (z^3 - 1)^2\n\nNow we need to find the second derivative g''(z):\n\ng''(z) = d/dz [g'(z)]\n\nThis derivative is quite complex, but we can simplify it by evaluating it at z = 1, as that's what we need for the residue formula:\n\ng''(1) = d/dz [g'(z)]|z=1\n\nAt z = 1, (z - 1) = 0, which makes the terms containing (z - 1) in g'(z) equal to 0:\n\ng''(1) = d/dz [0]|z=1 = 0\n\nNow, we can find the residue using the formula:\n\nRes(f(z);1) = 1/(2!)(d^2/dz^2)[(z − 1)^2 f(z)]|z=1\n\nRes(f(z);1) = 1/2 * g''(1) = 1/2 * 0 = 0\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) at z = 1 is 0."
