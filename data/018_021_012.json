    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection of A and B, which is denoted by A ∩ B. The intersection consists of the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nSince the intersection of two sets is commutative, meaning A ∩ B = B ∩ A, we can see that:\n\nB ∩ A = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∩ B) and (B ∩ A). The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\n(A ∩ B) Δ (B ∩ A) = {}\n\nThe symmetric difference is an empty set because both (A ∩ B) and (B ∩ A) have the same elements.\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of A and B (A ∪ B), which is the set of all elements in either A or B:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, subtract the intersection (A ∩ B) from the union (A ∪ B):\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nThe symmetric difference of A and B is {1, 4}.\n\nNow, let's verify if the symmetric difference of (A ∩ B) and (B ∩ A) is equal to the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\n(A ∩ B) Δ (B ∩ A) = {} ≠ {1, 4} = A Δ B\n\nThe symmetric difference of (A ∩ B) and (B ∩ A) is not equal to the symmetric difference of A and B."
