    "message_2": "A degree 4 plane curve can be represented by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4 in two variables, say $x$ and $y$. The number of monomials in this polynomial is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4+2}{4} = \\binom{6}{4} = 15$. Therefore, the dimension of the space of degree 4 plane curves is 15. However, we need to subtract 1 for the projective equivalence, so the dimension of the moduli space $M_4$ is 14.\n\nNow, let's consider a general element of $M_4$, which is a degree 4 plane curve. A singular point on the curve is a point where both the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ vanish. Let $F(x, y)$ be the polynomial representing the curve. Then, the partial derivatives are given by:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\n\nSince $F(x, y)$ is a degree 4 polynomial, its partial derivatives are degree 3 polynomials. The system of equations formed by the partial derivatives is a system of two equations in two variables. By Bezout's theorem, the number of intersection points of two curves of degree $m$ and $n$ is $mn$, provided that the curves have no common components. In this case, the degrees of the partial derivatives are both 3, so the number of singular points is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nHowever, this count includes points at infinity, which we need to subtract. A point at infinity on a degree 4 curve is a singular point if and only if the curve has a double point at infinity. Since a general element of $M_4$ does not have a double point at infinity, we need to subtract 1 from the count. Therefore, the number of singular points contained in a general element of $M_4$ is $9 - 1 = 8$."
