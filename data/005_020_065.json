    "message_1": "Suppose a manufacturing company produces light bulbs with an average lifespan of 2000 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours. Using Monte Carlo simulation, what is the probability that a sample of 100 light bulbs will have an average lifespan of at least 1950 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Monte Carlo simulation, we will generate a large number of random samples of 100 light bulbs each, compute the average lifespan of each sample, and then calculate the proportion of samples with an average lifespan of at least 1950 hours. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Set up the simulation parameters: mean lifespan = 2000 hours, standard deviation = 100 hours, sample size = 100 light bulbs, number of simulations = 100,000 (the more simulations, the more accurate the result).\n\n2. Generate 100,000 random samples of 100 light bulbs each, with lifespans normally distributed with a mean of 2000 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours.\n\n3. For each sample, compute the average lifespan of the 100 light bulbs.\n\n4. Count the number of samples with an average lifespan of at least 1950 hours.\n\n5. Divide the count from step 4 by the total number of simulations (100,000) to get the probability.\n\nHere's a Python code to perform the Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nmean_lifespan = 2000\nstd_dev = 100\nsample_size = 100\nnum_simulations = 100000\nthreshold = 1950\n\n# Generate random samples\nsamples = np.random.normal(mean_lifespan, std_dev, (num_simulations, sample_size))\n\n# Compute the average lifespan for each sample\naverage_lifespans = np.mean(samples, axis=1)\n\n# Count the number of samples with an average lifespan of at least 1950 hours\ncount = np.sum(average_lifespans >= threshold)\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability = count / num_simulations\n\nprint(\"Probability:\", probability)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the probability that a sample of 100 light bulbs will have an average lifespan of at least 1950 hours. The result will be close to 0.977, which means there is approximately a 97.7% chance that a sample of 100 light bulbs will have an average lifespan of at least 1950 hours."
