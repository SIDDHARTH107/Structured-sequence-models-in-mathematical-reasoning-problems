    "message_2": "To find the global maximum and minimum of the function f(x) = -x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x + 5 within the interval [-3, 3], we need to first find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative of the function and setting it to zero.\n\nf'(x) = -4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x - 3\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0. This is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be challenging. However, we can try to find integer roots using the Rational Root Theorem. \n\nBy trying integer factors of the constant term (-3), we find that x = 1 is a root:\n\nf'(1) = -4(1)^3 + 6(1)^2 + 4(1) - 3 = -4 + 6 + 4 - 3 = 0\n\nNow, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n       ______________________\n  1  |  -4     6     4    -3\n         + -4    2     0\n       ______________________\n          0     2     6    -3\n\nSo, the factored form of the derivative is:\n\nf'(x) = (x - 1)(-4x^2 + 2x + 6)\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the quadratic factor:\n\n-4x^2 + 2x + 6 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (-2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(-4)(6))) / (2(-4))\n\nx = (-2 ± √(100)) / (-8)\n\nx = (-2 ± 10) / (-8)\n\nThe two roots are:\n\nx1 = (-2 + 10) / (-8) = 8 / (-8) = -1\nx2 = (-2 - 10) / (-8) = 12 / (-8) = -1.5\n\nNow, we have three critical points: x = 1, x = -1, and x = -1.5. We also need to evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval, x = -3 and x = 3.\n\nf(-3) = -(-3)^4 + 2(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 - 3(-3) + 5 = -81 + 54 + 18 + 9 + 5 = 5\nf(-1.5) = -(-1.5)^4 + 2(-1.5)^3 + 2(-1.5)^2 - 3(-1.5) + 5 ≈ 7.34375\nf(-1) = -(-1)^4 + 2(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 - 3(-1) + 5 = 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 12\nf(1) = -(1)^4 + 2(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 - 3(1) + 5 = -1 + 2 + 2 - 3 + 5 = 5\nf(3) = -(3)^4 + 2(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 - 3(3) + 5 = -81 + 54 + 18 - 9 + 5 = -3\n\nNow, we can compare the values of the function at these points:\n\nf(-3) = 5\nf(-1.5) ≈ 7.34375\nf(-1) = 12\nf(1) = 5\nf(3) = -3\n\nThe global maximum is f(-1) = 12, and the global minimum is f(3) = -3."
