    "message_1": "Here is a question for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose there are three boxes, one of which contains a prize. Two of the boxes are empty and one contains the prize. You are told by a reliable source that the prize is not in the first box. Using epistemic logic, what is the probability that the prize is in the second box?",
    "message_2": "Since we know for certain that the prize is not in the first box, we can eliminate that option. Now, we are left with two boxes: the second box and the third box. Since there is only one prize and it must be in one of these two remaining boxes, the probability of the prize being in the second box is 1/2 or 50%."
