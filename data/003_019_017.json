    "message_2": "To find the definite integral of cos^2(x) from x=0 to x=π/4, we can use the power-reduction formula:\n\ncos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\n∫(cos^2(x) dx) from x=0 to x=π/4 = ∫((1 + cos(2x))/2 dx) from x=0 to x=π/4\n\nLet's integrate the two terms separately:\n\n∫(1/2 dx) from x=0 to x=π/4 + ∫(cos(2x)/2 dx) from x=0 to x=π/4\n\nThe integral of 1/2 with respect to x is (1/2)x, and the integral of cos(2x)/2 with respect to x is (1/4)sin(2x). Now, we can evaluate these at the limits of integration:\n\n[(1/2)(π/4) + (1/4)sin(2(π/4))] - [(1/2)(0) + (1/4)sin(2(0))]\n\n= (π/8) + (1/4)sin(π/2) - 0\n\n= (π/8) + (1/4)(1)\n\n= (π/8) + (1/4)\n\nSo, the definite integral of cos^2(x) from x=0 to x=π/4 is (π/8) + (1/4)."
