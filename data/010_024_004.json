    "message_2": "To calculate the Euler characteristic of the surface, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which states that the total curvature of a surface is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic (χ).\n\nIn this case, we have a hyperbolic surface with a total curvature of -1/2 and a conical singularity of angle 3π/4. The conical singularity contributes an additional curvature of (2π - 3π/4) to the total curvature. So, the total curvature K is:\n\nK = -1/2 + (2π - 3π/4)\n\nNow, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to find the Euler characteristic:\n\nK = 2πχ\n\n-1/2 + (2π - 3π/4) = 2πχ\n\nSolving for χ:\n\nχ = (-1/2 + (2π - 3π/4)) / (2π)\n\nχ = (-1/2 + (5π/4)) / (2π)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nχ = (5π/4 - 1/2) / (2π)\n\nχ = (5π - 2) / (8π)\n\nThis is the Euler characteristic of the surface."
