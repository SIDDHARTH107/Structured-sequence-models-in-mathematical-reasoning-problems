    "message_1": "Suppose G is a group of order 48. Determine if G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C48, the alternating group A4 × C4, or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48. If G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 48, state which group it is and give a brief explanation of the isomorphism mapping.",
    "message_2": "To determine if G is isomorphic to any of the given groups, we can analyze its structure using the Sylow theorems. The order of G is 48, which can be factored as 2^4 * 3. Therefore, G has Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16 and a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1, 4, or 16.\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C48.\nIf G is isomorphic to C48, then it must have a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup (since a cyclic group has a unique subgroup of each order dividing the group order). This means n_2 = n_3 = 1. This is a possibility, so G could be isomorphic to C48.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4.\nThe group A4 × C4 has order 48, and its Sylow 2-subgroups are isomorphic to C4 × C4, while its Sylow 3-subgroups are isomorphic to A4. In this case, n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4. This is also a possibility, so G could be isomorphic to A4 × C4.\n\nCase 3: G is isomorphic to one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.\nIf G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 48, it cannot have a unique Sylow 2-subgroup or a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, as that would imply G is abelian. Thus, n_2 must be 3 and n_3 must be either 4 or 16. There are 14 non-abelian groups of order 48, and without more information about G, we cannot determine which specific group it is isomorphic to or provide a specific isomorphism mapping.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the group G, we cannot definitively determine if it is isomorphic to C48, A4 × C4, or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48. However, we have shown that it is possible for G to be isomorphic to any of these groups based on the Sylow theorems."
