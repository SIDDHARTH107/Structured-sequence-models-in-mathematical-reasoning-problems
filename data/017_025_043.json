    "message_2": "First, let's note that the order of G is 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there are unique Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups in G. Let P be a Sylow 3-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 5-subgroup. Since G has an element of order 3, P is non-trivial. Also, the orders of P and Q are 3 and 5, respectively, which are both prime numbers. Thus, P and Q are cyclic and are isomorphic to C3 and C5, respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of the orders of P and Q, which is |P||Q| = 3 * 5 = 15. Since P and Q are both normal in G (as they are unique Sylow subgroups), their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since P and Q have relatively prime orders, PQ is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q, which is isomorphic to C3 × C5 = C15.\n\nNow, we consider the possibilities for G:\n\n1. If G is a cyclic group, then G is isomorphic to C120.\n\n2. If G is not cyclic, then G has a non-trivial Sylow 2-subgroup R. Let's consider the semidirect product of PQ and R, denoted by (PQ) ⋊ R. Since |PQ| = 15 and |R| = 2^3 = 8, we have |(PQ) ⋊ R| = 120, which is the same as the order of G. Thus, G is isomorphic to (PQ) ⋊ R.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n2a. If R is normal in G, then G is isomorphic to the direct product PQ × R. Since PQ is isomorphic to C15 and R is isomorphic to one of the five groups of order 8 (C8, C4 × C2, D4, Q8, or C2 × C2 × C2), G is isomorphic to one of the 5 possible direct products of C15 and a group of order 8. Among these, only A5 × C2 × C2 is a possible isomorphism, as it has an element of order 3.\n\n2b. If R is not normal in G, then G is isomorphic to one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120, as classified by the GAP software.\n\nIn conclusion, if G contains an element of order 3, then G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, or one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120."
