    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, people affected by the disease) in n trials (the sample size)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the prevalence of the disease)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the sample size)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of people affected by the disease)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 500 (sample size)\n- k = 35 (number of people affected by the disease)\n- p = 0.08 (prevalence of the disease)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(n, k), which is the number of combinations of 500 items taken 35 at a time:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\nC(500, 35) = 500! / (35!(500-35)!)\n\nNext, let's calculate p^k and (1-p)^(n-k):\n\np^k = 0.08^35\n(1-p)^(n-k) = (1-0.08)^(500-35) = 0.92^465\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 35) = C(500, 35) * 0.08^35 * 0.92^465\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values:\n\nP(X = 35) â‰ˆ 0.0464\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 35 people out of a sample of 500 from the demographic group will be affected by the specific disease is approximately 0.0464 or 4.64%."
