    "message_1": "A group of 8 friends is planning a road trip to a nearby city. The probability that at least one of them will get car sick during the trip is 0.4. What is the probability that none of them will get car sick during the trip?",
    "message_2": "The probability that at least one of them will get car sick is 0.4. Therefore, the probability that none of them will get car sick is the complement of this probability. \n\nThe complement of a probability is calculated as 1 minus the probability. So, the probability that none of them will get car sick is:\n\n1 - 0.4 = 0.6\n\nThe probability that none of the friends will get car sick during the trip is 0.6 or 60%."
