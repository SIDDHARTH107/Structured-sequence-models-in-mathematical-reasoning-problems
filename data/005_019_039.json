It is known that on any given night, 60% of the tourists who stay at Hotel A will return to Hotel A on their next visit, while 40% will switch to Hotel B. Similarly, 70% of tourists who stay at Hotel B will return to Hotel B on their next visit, while 30% will switch to Hotel A. \n\nIf there are currently 100 tourists staying at Hotel A and 200 tourists staying at Hotel B, what is the probability that on the next night there will be exactly 150 tourists staying at Hotel A and 150 staying at Hotel B?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of x successes in n trials, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability that exactly 50 tourists from Hotel A switch to Hotel B and exactly 100 tourists from Hotel B switch to Hotel A.\n\nFor Hotel A:\nn = 100 (number of tourists)\nx = 50 (number of tourists switching to Hotel B)\np = 0.4 (probability of switching to Hotel B)\n\nFor Hotel B:\nn = 200 (number of tourists)\nx = 100 (number of tourists switching to Hotel A)\np = 0.3 (probability of switching to Hotel A)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each hotel separately:\n\nP(50 tourists from Hotel A switch to Hotel B) = C(100, 50) * 0.4^50 * 0.6^50\nP(100 tourists from Hotel B switch to Hotel A) = C(200, 100) * 0.3^100 * 0.7^100\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening simultaneously, we multiply the two probabilities:\n\nP(150 tourists in Hotel A and 150 tourists in Hotel B) = P(50 tourists from Hotel A switch to Hotel B) * P(100 tourists from Hotel B switch to Hotel A)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the binomial coefficients and probabilities, we get:\n\nP(150 tourists in Hotel A and 150 tourists in Hotel B) â‰ˆ 0.0461\n\nSo, the probability that on the next night there will be exactly 150 tourists staying at Hotel A and 150 staying at Hotel B is approximately 4.61%."
