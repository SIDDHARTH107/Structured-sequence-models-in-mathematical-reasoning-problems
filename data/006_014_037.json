    "message_1": "A company's database system has three servers that are used for redundancy. The probability of any one server failing is 0.05. What is the probability that at least one server will fail within a year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one server will fail within a year, we can use the complementary probability rule. This rule states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability that none of the servers fail within a year. The probability of a server not failing is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the servers are independent, the probability of all three servers not failing is the product of their individual probabilities of not failing:\n\nP(all servers not failing) = 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.857375\n\nNow, we can use the complementary probability rule to find the probability that at least one server will fail:\n\nP(at least one server failing) = 1 - P(all servers not failing) = 1 - 0.857375 = 0.142625\n\nSo, the probability that at least one server will fail within a year is approximately 0.142625 or 14.26%."
