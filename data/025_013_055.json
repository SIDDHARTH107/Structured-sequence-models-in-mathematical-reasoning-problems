    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian of the curve C at the point (0,1), we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. Let F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + 3x - 1. Then, we have:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 + 3\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we can evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (0,1):\n\n∂F/∂x(0,1) = -3(0)^2 + 3 = 3\n∂F/∂y(0,1) = 2(1) = 2\n\nFinally, the Jacobian matrix of C at the point (0,1) is given by:\n\nJacobian = | ∂F/∂x  ∂F/∂y |\n                  | 3          2    |\n\nSo, the Jacobian of C at the point (0,1) is:\n\n| 3  2 |"
