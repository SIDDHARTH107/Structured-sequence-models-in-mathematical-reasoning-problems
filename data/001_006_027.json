    "message_2": "To graph the quadratic equation y = 2x² + 3x - 1, we need to find the vertex, the x-intercepts, the y-intercept, and the axis of symmetry.\n\n1. Vertex:\nThe vertex of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax² + bx + c is given by the formula:\n\nVertex (h, k) = (-b/2a, f(-b/2a))\n\nIn our case, a = 2, b = 3, and c = -1. So,\n\nh = -b/2a = -3/(2*2) = -3/4\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y (k) when x = h:\n\nk = 2(-3/4)² + 3(-3/4) - 1\nk = 2(9/16) - 9/4 - 1\nk = 9/8 - 9/4 - 1\nk = 9/8 - 18/8 - 8/8\nk = -17/8\n\nSo, the vertex of the equation is (-3/4, -17/8).\n\n2. X-intercepts:\nTo find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x² + 3x - 1\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (-3 ± √(3² - 4*2*(-1))) / (2*2)\nx = (-3 ± √(9 + 8)) / 4\nx = (-3 ± √17) / 4\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are (-3 + √17) / 4 and (-3 - √17) / 4.\n\n3. Y-intercept:\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 2(0)² + 3(0) - 1\ny = -1\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, -1).\n\n4. Axis of symmetry:\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex of the parabola. Its equation is given by:\n\nx = h\n\nIn our case, h = -3/4. So, the axis of symmetry is x = -3/4.\n\nNow, we have all the information needed to graph the quadratic equation y = 2x² + 3x - 1:\n\n- Vertex: (-3/4, -17/8)\n- X-intercepts: (-3 + √17) / 4 and (-3 - √17) / 4\n- Y-intercept: (0, -1)\n- Axis of symmetry: x = -3/4"
