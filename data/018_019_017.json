    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}. \n\nFind the symmetric difference of A and B, then find the symmetric difference of the resulting set and B again. Is the answer the same as finding the symmetric difference of A with the symmetric difference of B and A? Prove your answer.",
    "message_2": "To find the symmetric difference of A and B, we need to find the elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nSymmetric difference of A and B (A Δ B) = {1, 2, 6}\n\nNow, we find the symmetric difference of the resulting set {1, 2, 6} and B again.\n\nSymmetric difference of {1, 2, 6} and B ({1, 2, 6} Δ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A (B Δ A) = {1, 2, 6}\n\nNow, we find the symmetric difference of A with the symmetric difference of B and A (A Δ (B Δ A)).\n\nSymmetric difference of A and {1, 2, 6} (A Δ {1, 2, 6}) = {3, 4, 5}\n\nAs we can see, the answer is the same in both cases: {3, 4, 5}. This is not a coincidence, and we can prove it using the properties of symmetric difference.\n\nProof:\n\nLet's use the property that the symmetric difference is associative: (A Δ B) Δ C = A Δ (B Δ C).\n\nIn our case, we want to show that (A Δ B) Δ B = A Δ (B Δ A).\n\nUsing the associative property, we can rewrite the left side of the equation as A Δ (B Δ B).\n\nNow, we use the property that the symmetric difference of a set with itself is the empty set: B Δ B = ∅.\n\nSo, we have A Δ ∅. The symmetric difference of a set with the empty set is the set itself: A Δ ∅ = A.\n\nNow, let's look at the right side of the equation: A Δ (B Δ A).\n\nUsing the associative property, we can rewrite it as (A Δ A) Δ B.\n\nUsing the property that the symmetric difference of a set with itself is the empty set, we have ∅ Δ B.\n\nThe symmetric difference of a set with the empty set is the set itself, so we have ∅ Δ B = B.\n\nSo, we have shown that (A Δ B) Δ B = A Δ (B Δ A) = A = B, which proves that the answer is the same in both cases."
