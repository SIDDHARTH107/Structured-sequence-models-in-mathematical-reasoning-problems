The cost function is given by: \n\nC(x,y) = 450x + 600y - 25x^2 - 30y^2 - 20xy\n\nwhere x and y represent the proportions of raw materials A and B respectively, and C represents the total cost of production. Using the particle swarm optimization method, find the optimal combination of raw materials to minimize the cost of production.",
    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. In this case, we want to minimize the cost function C(x, y). To apply PSO, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a swarm of particles with random positions and velocities in the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each particle (in this case, the cost function C(x, y)).\n3. Update the personal best position of each particle if the current position is better.\n4. Update the global best position if the current position is better.\n5. Update the velocity and position of each particle according to the personal best and global best positions.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a minimum cost threshold).\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the PSO algorithm to find the optimal combination of raw materials A and B:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef cost_function(x, y):\n    return 450 * x + 600 * y - 25 * x**2 - 30 * y**2 - 20 * x * y\n\ndef pso(cost_function, n_particles, n_iterations, search_space_limits, w=0.7, c1=2, c2=2):\n    n_dimensions = 2\n    particles = np.random.uniform(search_space_limits[0], search_space_limits[1], (n_particles, n_dimensions))\n    velocities = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, (n_particles, n_dimensions))\n    personal_best_positions = particles.copy()\n    personal_best_costs = np.apply_along_axis(cost_function, 1, particles[:, 0], particles[:, 1])\n    global_best_position = particles[np.argmin(personal_best_costs)]\n    global_best_cost = np.min(personal_best_costs)\n\n    for _ in range(n_iterations):\n        r1, r2 = np.random.rand(), np.random.rand()\n        velocities = w * velocities + c1 * r1 * (personal_best_positions - particles) + c2 * r2 * (global_best_position - particles)\n        particles += velocities\n        costs = np.apply_along_axis(cost_function, 1, particles[:, 0], particles[:, 1])\n        better_costs = costs < personal_best_costs\n        personal_best_positions[better_costs] = particles[better_costs]\n        personal_best_costs[better_costs] = costs[better_costs]\n        current_global_best_cost = np.min(personal_best_costs)\n        if current_global_best_cost < global_best_cost:\n            global_best_position = personal_best_positions[np.argmin(personal_best_costs)]\n            global_best_cost = current_global_best_cost\n\n    return global_best_position, global_best_cost\n\nn_particles = 50\nn_iterations = 1000\nsearch_space_limits = (0, 20)\noptimal_combination, min_cost = pso(cost_function, n_particles, n_iterations, search_space_limits)\n\nprint(f\"Optimal combination of raw materials A and B: {optimal_combination}\")\nprint(f\"Minimum cost of production: {min_cost}\")\n```\n\nThis code defines the cost function and the PSO algorithm, then runs the algorithm with 50 particles and 1000 iterations. The search space limits for x and y are set to (0, 20). The optimal combination of raw materials A and B and the minimum cost of production will be printed as the output. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the PSO algorithm."
