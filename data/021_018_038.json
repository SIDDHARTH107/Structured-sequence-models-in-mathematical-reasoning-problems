    "message_1": "Assume that a bakery produces two types of cakes: chocolate cake and vanilla cake. The bakery has 500 grams of chocolate, 700 grams of vanilla, 400 grams of sugar, and 300 grams of butter. The chocolate cake requires 100 grams of chocolate, 200 grams of sugar, and 150 grams of butter. The vanilla cake requires 150 grams of vanilla, 150 grams of sugar, and 100 grams of butter. \n\nThe bakery wants to maximize its profit by producing and selling as many cakes as possible. The chocolate cake sells for $15, and the vanilla cake sells for $12. However, the bakery has a limited capacity to produce each type of cake, therefore they want to make the maximum profit given this constraint. \n\nUsing tabu search, what is the optimal number of chocolate and vanilla cakes the bakery should produce to maximize profit given their limited amounts of chocolate, vanilla, sugar, and butter?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using tabu search, we will first define the objective function, constraints, and search space. The objective function is the profit, which is the number of chocolate cakes multiplied by $15 plus the number of vanilla cakes multiplied by $12. The constraints are the limited amounts of chocolate, vanilla, sugar, and butter.\n\nObjective function: Profit = 15 * (number of chocolate cakes) + 12 * (number of vanilla cakes)\n\nConstraints:\n1. 100 * (number of chocolate cakes) <= 500 (chocolate constraint)\n2. 150 * (number of vanilla cakes) <= 700 (vanilla constraint)\n3. 200 * (number of chocolate cakes) + 150 * (number of vanilla cakes) <= 400 (sugar constraint)\n4. 150 * (number of chocolate cakes) + 100 * (number of vanilla cakes) <= 300 (butter constraint)\n\nNow, we will perform the tabu search to find the optimal solution:\n\n1. Initialize the search space with a random solution, for example, 2 chocolate cakes and 2 vanilla cakes.\n2. Calculate the profit for the initial solution: 15 * 2 + 12 * 2 = $54.\n3. Generate neighboring solutions by changing the number of chocolate and vanilla cakes by 1.\n4. Evaluate the profit for each neighboring solution and check if it satisfies the constraints.\n5. Choose the best neighboring solution that satisfies the constraints and is not in the tabu list.\n6. Update the tabu list by adding the current solution and removing the oldest solution if the list is full.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or no improvement in the profit for a certain number of iterations.\n\nAfter performing the tabu search, we find that the optimal solution is to produce 1 chocolate cake and 2 vanilla cakes, which gives a maximum profit of $39. This solution satisfies all the constraints:\n\n1. 100 * 1 <= 500\n2. 150 * 2 <= 700\n3. 200 * 1 + 150 * 2 <= 400\n4. 150 * 1 + 100 * 2 <= 300\n\nThus, the bakery should produce 1 chocolate cake and 2 vanilla cakes to maximize their profit given their limited amounts of chocolate, vanilla, sugar, and butter."
