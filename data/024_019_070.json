    "message_2": "To find the total angle defect of $S$ around $\\gamma$, we will apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for surfaces with boundary. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a compact, connected, and orientable surface $S$ with boundary $\\gamma$, the following equation holds:\n\n$\\int_S K dA + \\int_\\gamma \\kappa_g ds = 2\\pi \\chi(S)$,\n\nwhere $K$ is the Gaussian curvature, $\\kappa_g$ is the geodesic curvature, $dA$ and $ds$ are the area and arc length elements, and $\\chi(S)$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nIn our case, we have $K = -1$ and $\\kappa_g = 1$. Since $S$ is a smooth regular surface with constant Gaussian curvature $K = -1$, it is locally isometric to the hyperbolic plane. Thus, the Euler characteristic $\\chi(S) = 1$ (as it is topologically equivalent to a disk).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\n$\\int_S (-1) dA + \\int_\\gamma 1 ds = 2\\pi \\cdot 1$.\n\nLet $A$ be the area of $S$ and $L$ be the length of the boundary curve $\\gamma$. Then, we have:\n\n$-A + L = 2\\pi$.\n\nThe total angle defect of $S$ around $\\gamma$ is given by the difference between the integral of the geodesic curvature along the boundary and the expected $2\\pi$ for a flat surface:\n\n$\\text{Angle defect} = \\int_\\gamma \\kappa_g ds - 2\\pi = L - 2\\pi$.\n\nFrom the previous equation, we have $L - A = 2\\pi$, so $L = 2\\pi + A$. Therefore, the total angle defect of $S$ around $\\gamma$ is:\n\n$\\text{Angle defect} = (2\\pi + A) - 2\\pi = A$.\n\nSo, the total angle defect of $S$ around $\\gamma$ is equal to the area of the surface $S$."
