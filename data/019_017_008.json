    "message_2": "We know that $G$ is an infinite model of the theory $T$ of non-cyclic groups of order 3. Since $G$ is a model of $T$, it must satisfy all the axioms of a group and the additional axioms that make it non-cyclic of order 3. \n\nRecall the axioms of a group:\n\n1. Associativity: $(a \\ast b) \\ast c = a \\ast (b \\ast c)$ for all $a, b, c \\in G$.\n2. Identity: There exists an element $e \\in G$ such that $a \\ast e = e \\ast a = a$ for all $a \\in G$.\n3. Inverses: For every $a \\in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1} \\in G$ such that $a \\ast a^{-1} = a^{-1} \\ast a = e$.\n\nNow, let's consider the additional axioms for non-cyclic groups of order 3:\n\n4. There exist at least two distinct elements $a, b \\in G$ such that $a \\neq b$ and $a \\neq e$ and $b \\neq e$.\n5. For any element $a \\in G$, the subgroup generated by $a$ has at most 3 elements, i.e., $\\{e, a, a \\ast a\\}$.\n\nNow, let's prove that there exists an element $a \\in G$ such that $a \\ast a \\neq e$.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that for all $a \\in G$, we have $a \\ast a = e$. Then, for any $a \\in G$, the subgroup generated by $a$ would have at most 2 elements, namely $\\{e, a\\}$. This contradicts the fact that $G$ is a model of the theory of non-cyclic groups of order 3, which requires the existence of subgroups with 3 elements.\n\nTherefore, our assumption is false, and there must exist an element $a \\in G$ such that $a \\ast a \\neq e$."
