    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the function f(z) = √(z-1) along the straight line segment joining the points z=1 and z=4, we first parameterize the line segment. Let z(t) be a parameterization of the line segment, where t is a real parameter that varies from 0 to 1:\n\nz(t) = (1-t) * 1 + t * 4 = 1 + 3t\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function f(z) in terms of the parameter t:\n\nf(z(t)) = √(z(t) - 1) = √(1 + 3t - 1) = √(3t)\n\nThe function f(z(t)) = √(3t) is analytic on the interval 0 < t < 1, since the square root function is analytic for positive arguments. However, we need to consider the endpoints t=0 and t=1.\n\nAt t=0, z(t) = 1, and f(z(t)) = √(3*0) = 0. Since the square root function is analytic at 0, the analytic continuation of f(z) at z=1 is well-defined.\n\nAt t=1, z(t) = 4, and f(z(t)) = √(3*1) = √3. The square root function is also analytic at √3, so the analytic continuation of f(z) at z=4 is well-defined.\n\nTherefore, the analytic continuation of the function f(z) = √(z-1) along the straight line segment joining the points z=1 and z=4 is given by:\n\nf(z(t)) = √(3t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1"
