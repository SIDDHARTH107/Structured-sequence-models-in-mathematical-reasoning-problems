    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 - 3x + 2 and y = 3x - x^2, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 = 3x - x^2\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n2x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the x-values of the intersection points:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -3, and c = 1:\n\nx = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4(1)(1))) / 2(1)\nx = (3 ± √(9 - 4)) / 2\nx = (3 ± √5) / 2\n\nSo, the points of intersection are x = (3 + √5) / 2 and x = (3 - √5) / 2.\n\nNow, we can set up the integral to find the area between the curves. Since the curves intersect, we'll need to integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval between the intersection points:\n\nArea = ∫[(3x - x^2) - (x^2 - 3x + 2)] dx from (3 - √5) / 2 to (3 + √5) / 2\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\nArea = ∫[2(3x - x^2) - 2] dx from (3 - √5) / 2 to (3 + √5) / 2\n\nNow, integrate:\n\nArea = [2x^3/3 - 3x^2 + 2x - x] from (3 - √5) / 2 to (3 + √5) / 2\n\nEvaluate the integral at the bounds:\n\nArea = [(2(3 + √5)^3/3 - 3(3 + √5)^2 + 2(3 + √5) - (3 + √5)) - (2(3 - √5)^3/3 - 3(3 - √5)^2 + 2(3 - √5) - (3 - √5))]\n\nArea ≈ 6.7082\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 - 3x + 2 and y = 3x - x^2 is approximately 6.7082 square units."
