    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n(1) 2(x + 2y + 3z) = 2(4 + 2i)\n(2) 1(2x - y + 4z) = 1(-1 - 3i)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n(1) 2x + 4y + 6z = 8 + 4i\n(2) 2x - y + 4z = -1 - 3i\n\nSubtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n(1) - (2): (2x + 4y + 6z) - (2x - y + 4z) = (8 + 4i) - (-1 - 3i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n5y + 2z = 9 + 7i\n\nNow, let's multiply the first equation by 3 and the third equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n(1) 3(x + 2y + 3z) = 3(4 + 2i)\n(3) 1(3x + y + 2z) = 1(2 + 4i)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n(1) 3x + 6y + 9z = 12 + 6i\n(3) 3x + y + 2z = 2 + 4i\n\nSubtract equation (3) from equation (1):\n\n(1) - (3): (3x + 6y + 9z) - (3x + y + 2z) = (12 + 6i) - (2 + 4i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n5y + 7z = 10 + 2i\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables, y and z:\n\n5y + 2z = 9 + 7i\n5y + 7z = 10 + 2i\n\nWe can eliminate y by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(5y + 7z) - (5y + 2z) = (10 + 2i) - (9 + 7i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n5z = 1 - 5i\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\nz = (1 - 5i) / 5\nz = 1/5 - i\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into one of the equations with y. Let's use the first equation:\n\n5y + 2z = 9 + 7i\n\nSubstitute the value of z:\n\n5y + 2(1/5 - i) = 9 + 7i\n\nSimplify:\n\n5y + 2/5 - 2i = 9 + 7i\n\nSubtract 2/5 from both sides:\n\n5y = 44/5 + 9i\n\nDivide by 5:\n\ny = 44/25 + 9/5i\n\nNow that we have the values of y and z, we can substitute them back into one of the original equations to find the value of x. Let's use the first equation:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 4 + 2i\n\nSubstitute the values of y and z:\n\nx + 2(44/25 + 9/5i) + 3(1/5 - i) = 4 + 2i\n\nSimplify:\n\nx + 88/25 + 18/5i + 3/5 - 3i = 4 + 2i\n\nSubtract 88/25 and 3/5 from both sides:\n\nx = 4 - 88/25 - 3/5 + 2i - 18/5i + 3i\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = 12/25 + 5/5i\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z that satisfy this system of equations are:\n\nx = 12/25 + i\ny = 44/25 + 9/5i\nz = 1/5 - i"
