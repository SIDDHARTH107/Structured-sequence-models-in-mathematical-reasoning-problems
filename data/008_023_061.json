    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will first write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 10\n| 3  5  2 | 18\n| 2  3  5 | 17\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to obtain an upper triangular matrix:\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the 3 in the second row, first column:\nSubtract 3 times the first row from the second row:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 10\n| 0  -1 -7 | -12\n| 2  3  5 | 17\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the 2 in the third row, first column:\nSubtract 2 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 10\n| 0  -1 -7 | -12\n| 0  -1 -1 | -3\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the -1 in the third row, second column:\nSubtract the second row from the third row:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 10\n| 0  -1 -7 | -12\n| 0  0  6 | 9\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix. We can use back substitution to find the solution:\n\nStep 4: Solve for z:\n6z = 9\nz = 1.5\n\nStep 5: Solve for y:\n-y - 7(1.5) = -12\n-y - 10.5 = -12\ny = 1.5\n\nStep 6: Solve for x:\nx + 2(1.5) + 3(1.5) = 10\nx + 3 + 4.5 = 10\nx = 2.5\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2.5, y = 1.5, and z = 1.5.\n\nHowever, since there is up to a 5% error in each entry, the actual solution may vary slightly. To account for this error, you could use techniques such as interval arithmetic or Monte Carlo methods to estimate the range of possible solutions."
