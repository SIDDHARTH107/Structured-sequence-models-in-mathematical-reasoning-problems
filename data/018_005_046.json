    "message_2": "First, let's define the sets A and B:\n\nSet A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\nSet B = {5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of set A, denoted as A'. Since set A consists of even numbers between 1 and 10, its complement will consist of all odd numbers between 1 and 10.\n\nSet A' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of set A and its complement A', denoted as A ∩ A'. The intersection of two sets consists of elements that are common to both sets. \n\nLooking at the elements of set A and set A', we can see that there are no common elements between the two sets. Therefore, the intersection of set A and its complement A' is an empty set.\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nHence, we have proved that the intersection of set A and its complement is an empty set."
