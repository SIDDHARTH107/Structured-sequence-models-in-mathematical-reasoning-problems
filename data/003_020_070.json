    "message_1": "A hot air balloon rises to a height of 400 meters. At the same time, a person located 600 meters away from the balloon measures the angle of elevation to the top of the balloon as 30 degrees. What is the height of the hot air balloon above the ground?",
    "message_2": "We can use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (height of the balloon) and the adjacent side (distance from the person to the balloon).\n\nLet h be the height of the hot air balloon above the ground. We are given that the angle of elevation is 30 degrees and the distance from the person to the balloon is 600 meters.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(30) = h / 600\n\nWe know that tan(30) = 1 / sqrt(3). So,\n\n1 / sqrt(3) = h / 600\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh = 600 / sqrt(3)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):\n\nh = (600 * sqrt(3)) / 3\n\nh â‰ˆ 346.41 meters\n\nSo, the height of the hot air balloon above the ground is approximately 346.41 meters."
