Determine the Lie derivative of $V$ with respect to the vector field $W=2x\\partial_x+2y\\partial_y-2z\\partial_z$ evaluated at the point $(1,0,0)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of $V$ with respect to $W$, we first need to find the Lie bracket of the two vector fields, which is given by the commutator $[W, V] = WV - VW$. \n\nRecall that the action of a vector field on a function is given by the directional derivative in the direction of the vector field. Let $f$ be a smooth function on the manifold $M$. Then, we have:\n\n$WV(f) = W(x\\partial_y - y\\partial_x + 2z\\partial_z)(f) = W(x\\partial_y(f) - y\\partial_x(f) + 2z\\partial_z(f))$\n\n$VW(f) = V(2x\\partial_x + 2y\\partial_y - 2z\\partial_z)(f) = V(2x\\partial_x(f) + 2y\\partial_y(f) - 2z\\partial_z(f))$\n\nNow, we compute the action of $W$ and $V$ on the partial derivatives:\n\n$W(x\\partial_y(f)) = 2x\\partial_x(x\\partial_y(f)) + 2y\\partial_y(x\\partial_y(f)) - 2z\\partial_z(x\\partial_y(f))$\n\n$W(y\\partial_x(f)) = 2x\\partial_x(y\\partial_x(f)) + 2y\\partial_y(y\\partial_x(f)) - 2z\\partial_z(y\\partial_x(f))$\n\n$W(2z\\partial_z(f)) = 2x\\partial_x(2z\\partial_z(f)) + 2y\\partial_y(2z\\partial_z(f)) - 2z\\partial_z(2z\\partial_z(f))$\n\n$V(2x\\partial_x(f)) = x\\partial_y(2x\\partial_x(f)) - y\\partial_x(2x\\partial_x(f)) + 2z\\partial_z(2x\\partial_x(f))$\n\n$V(2y\\partial_y(f)) = x\\partial_y(2y\\partial_y(f)) - y\\partial_x(2y\\partial_y(f)) + 2z\\partial_z(2y\\partial_y(f))$\n\n$V(-2z\\partial_z(f)) = x\\partial_y(-2z\\partial_z(f)) - y\\partial_x(-2z\\partial_z(f)) + 2z\\partial_z(-2z\\partial_z(f))$\n\nNow, we can compute the Lie bracket:\n\n$[W, V](f) = (WV - VW)(f) = W(x\\partial_y(f) - y\\partial_x(f) + 2z\\partial_z(f)) - V(2x\\partial_x(f) + 2y\\partial_y(f) - 2z\\partial_z(f))$\n\n$[W, V] = (2x^2\\partial_x\\partial_y - 2xy\\partial_x\\partial_x + 4xz\\partial_x\\partial_z - 2xy\\partial_y\\partial_y + 2y^2\\partial_y\\partial_x - 4yz\\partial_y\\partial_z - 4xz\\partial_z\\partial_x + 4yz\\partial_z\\partial_y + 4z^2\\partial_z\\partial_z)$\n\nNow, we evaluate the Lie bracket at the point $(1, 0, 0)$:\n\n$[W, V](1, 0, 0) = (2\\partial_x\\partial_y - 4\\partial_z\\partial_x)|_{(1, 0, 0)}$\n\nSince the Lie derivative is a linear operator, we have:\n\n$L_W V = [W, V] = (2\\partial_x\\partial_y - 4\\partial_z\\partial_x)|_{(1, 0, 0)}$\n\nThus, the Lie derivative of $V$ with respect to the vector field $W$ evaluated at the point $(1, 0, 0)$ is $(2\\partial_x\\partial_y - 4\\partial_z\\partial_x)|_{(1, 0, 0)}$."
