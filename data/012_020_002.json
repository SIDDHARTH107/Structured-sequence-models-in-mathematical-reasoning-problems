    "message_2": "To determine the automorphism group of graph G, we need to find all the permutations of the vertices that preserve the edges of G. In other words, we need to find all the ways to relabel the vertices such that the adjacency relationships between the vertices remain the same.\n\nLet's first label the vertices of the graph as follows:\n\n```\n  A--B\n  |\\ |\n  | \\|\n  D--C\n```\n\nNow, let's find all the possible automorphisms:\n\n1. Identity automorphism: No change in the labeling.\n```\n  A--B\n  |\\ |\n  | \\|\n  D--C\n```\n\n2. Swap A and B, and swap C and D:\n```\n  B--A\n  |\\ |\n  | \\|\n  C--D\n```\n\n3. Swap A and D, and swap B and C:\n```\n  D--C\n  |\\ |\n  | \\|\n  A--B\n```\n\n4. Swap B and C, and swap A and D:\n```\n  C--D\n  |\\ |\n  | \\|\n  B--A\n```\n\n5. Swap A and C, and swap B and D:\n```\n  C--B\n  |\\ |\n  | \\|\n  D--A\n```\n\n6. Swap A and B, and swap D and C:\n```\n  D--A\n  |\\ |\n  | \\|\n  C--B\n```\n\n7. Swap A and D, and swap C and B:\n```\n  B--C\n  |\\ |\n  | \\|\n  A--D\n```\n\n8. Swap B and D, and swap A and C:\n```\n  A--C\n  |\\ |\n  | \\|\n  B--D\n```\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms of graph G. Therefore, the automorphism group of graph G is:\n\n{Identity, (AB)(CD), (AD)(BC), (AC)(BD), (AC)(DB), (AB)(DC), (AD)(CB), (BC)(DA)}"
