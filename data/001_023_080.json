    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(x) + cos(x) = 1, we can use the Pythagorean identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1.\n\nFirst, let's square both sides of the equation:\n\n(sin(x) + cos(x))^2 = 1^2\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\nsin^2(x) + 2sin(x)cos(x) + cos^2(x) = 1\n\nNow, we can substitute the Pythagorean identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 into the equation:\n\n1 + 2sin(x)cos(x) = 1\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) = 0\n\nSince x is in quadrant 1, both sin(x) and cos(x) are positive. Therefore, the only way for their product to be zero is if one of them is zero. However, in quadrant 1, neither sin(x) nor cos(x) can be zero. Thus, there is no solution for x in quadrant 1."
