    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 3x^2 - 15x\nFactor out the common term, 3x:\n3x(x - 5)\n\nDenominator: 6x^3 - 30x^2\nFactor out the common term, 6x^2:\n6x^2(x - 5)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(3x(x - 5)) / (6x^2(x - 5))\n\nNext, we can cancel out the common terms (x - 5) in both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n(3x) / (6x^2)\n\nFinally, we can simplify the expression further by canceling out the common term x and dividing 3 by 6:\n\n(3x) / (6x^2) = (3/6)(x/x^2) = (1/2)(1/x)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n1 / (2x)"
