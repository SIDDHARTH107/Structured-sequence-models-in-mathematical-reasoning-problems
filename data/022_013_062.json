    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(z) = z^2 + 2z, we'll first differentiate it with respect to z:\n\nf'(z) = d/dz (z^2 + 2z) = 2z + 2\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the derivative at the given point z = 2i + 3:\n\nf'(2i + 3) = 2(2i + 3) + 2 = 4i + 6 + 2 = 4i + 8\n\nSo, the derivative of f(z) at z = 2i + 3 is f'(2i + 3) = 4i + 8."
