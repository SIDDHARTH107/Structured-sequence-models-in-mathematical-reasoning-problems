    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the function f(x) = 5 cos(3x - π/4), we need to analyze the function and identify its key features.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a cosine function is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the cosine term. In this case, the amplitude is |5| = 5.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a cosine function is determined by the coefficient inside the cosine term, which affects the frequency of the function. The general formula for the period of a cosine function is (2π) / |B|, where B is the coefficient of the x term inside the cosine function.\n\nIn this case, B = 3. So, the period of the function is (2π) / |3| = (2π) / 3.\n\nThus, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 5 cos(3x - π/4) is 5, and the period is (2π) / 3."
