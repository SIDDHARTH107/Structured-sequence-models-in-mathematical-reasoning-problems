    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)$$\n\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $m$ is the mass of the particle, $V(x)$ is the potential energy function, and $E$ is the total energy of the particle.\n\nGiven the potential energy function $V(x) = 2x^2$ J and the mass of the particle $m = 0.5$ kg, we can plug these values into the Schrödinger equation:\n\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2(0.5)}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + 2x^2\\psi(x) = 10\\psi(x)$$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$$-\\hbar^2\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + 4x^2\\psi(x) = 20\\psi(x)$$\n\nNow, we need to solve this second-order differential equation for the wave function $\\psi(x)$. This equation is a type of Sturm-Liouville problem, which is not easily solvable analytically. However, we can provide a general solution in terms of special functions called Hermite functions.\n\nThe general solution to this type of equation is given by:\n\n$$\\psi(x) = N e^{-\\alpha x^2} H_n(\\sqrt{2\\alpha}x)$$\n\nwhere $N$ is a normalization constant, $\\alpha$ is a constant related to the potential and energy, $H_n(x)$ are the Hermite polynomials, and $n$ is a non-negative integer representing the energy level of the system.\n\nTo find the specific solution for this problem, we need to determine the values of $\\alpha$ and $n$. This would typically involve solving a transcendental equation, which is beyond the scope of this answer. However, we can provide the general form of the solution as shown above.\n\nIn summary, the wave function $\\psi(x)$ that satisfies the time-independent Schrödinger equation for the given potential and energy is:\n\n$$\\psi(x) = N e^{-\\alpha x^2} H_n(\\sqrt{2\\alpha}x)$$"
