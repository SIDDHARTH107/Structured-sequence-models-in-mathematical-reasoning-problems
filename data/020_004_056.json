    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the quadratic function f(x) = 2x^2 + 16x + 20 within the given constraints, we first need to find the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of a quadratic function in the form of f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c is given by the formula:\n\nx_vertex = -b / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2 and b = 16, so:\n\nx_vertex = -16 / (2 * 2) = -16 / 4 = -4\n\nNow, we need to check if the vertex is within the given constraints, x <= 5 and x >= -3. Since -4 is not within the constraints, we need to evaluate the function at the boundary points of the constraints, x = 5 and x = -3.\n\nf(5) = 2(5)^2 + 16(5) + 20 = 2(25) + 80 + 20 = 50 + 80 + 20 = 150\nf(-3) = 2(-3)^2 + 16(-3) + 20 = 2(9) - 48 + 20 = 18 - 48 + 20 = -10\n\nSince f(5) = 150 is greater than f(-3) = -10, the maximum value of the quadratic function f(x) = 2x^2 + 16x + 20 subject to the constraints x <= 5 and x >= -3 is 150."
