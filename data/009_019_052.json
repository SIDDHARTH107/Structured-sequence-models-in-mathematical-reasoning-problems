If the current stock price is $S_0=100$, $\\mu=0.05$, $\\sigma=0.2$, and the time horizon is $T=1$ year, what is the probability that the stock price will be greater than $150$ at the end of the year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the stock price will be greater than $150$ at the end of the year, we first need to find the distribution of the stock price at time $T=1$. The given stochastic differential equation is a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), which has a log-normal distribution. The solution to the GBM is given by:\n\n$$S(T) = S_0 e^{(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T + \\sigma B(T)}$$\n\nwhere $B(T)$ is a standard Brownian motion at time $T$. The random variable $X = \\ln(S(T)/S_0)$ follows a normal distribution with mean $(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T$ and variance $\\sigma^2 T$. \n\nNow, we want to find the probability $P(S(T) > 150)$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\n$$P(\\ln(S(T)) > \\ln(150/S_0))$$\n\nLet $Y = \\ln(S(T)/S_0)$. Then, $Y$ follows a normal distribution with mean $(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T$ and variance $\\sigma^2 T$. We can standardize $Y$ by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation:\n\n$$Z = \\frac{Y - (\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}$$\n\n$Z$ follows a standard normal distribution. Now, we can rewrite the probability as:\n\n$$P(Z > \\frac{\\ln(150/S_0) - (\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}})$$\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\n$$P(Z > \\frac{\\ln(150/100) - (0.05 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.2)^2)(1)}{0.2\\sqrt{1}})$$\n\n$$P(Z > \\frac{\\ln(1.5) - 0.03}{0.2})$$\n\n$$P(Z > 1.496)$$\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability:\n\n$$P(Z > 1.496) \\approx 0.067$$\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will be greater than $150$ at the end of the year is approximately $6.7\\%$."
