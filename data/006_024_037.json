    "message_1": "A student is planning to take a bus from City A to City B. The probability of the bus arriving on time is 0.85. If the bus is on time, there is a 0.6 probability that the student will arrive at City B for an appointment on time. What is the probability that the student arrives on time for the appointment in City B?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the student arrives on time for the appointment in City B, we need to multiply the probability of the bus arriving on time by the probability of the student arriving on time given that the bus is on time.\n\nProbability (Student arrives on time) = Probability (Bus arrives on time) * Probability (Student arrives on time | Bus arrives on time)\n\nProbability (Student arrives on time) = 0.85 * 0.6\n\nProbability (Student arrives on time) = 0.51\n\nSo, the probability that the student arrives on time for the appointment in City B is 0.51 or 51%."
