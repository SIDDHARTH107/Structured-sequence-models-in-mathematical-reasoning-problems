    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) = sin(x) + 2cos(x) in the interval [0, 2π], we first need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of f(x) and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = cos(x) - 2sin(x)\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0:\n\ncos(x) - 2sin(x) = 0\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin(x) = cos(π/2 - x)\n\nSubstitute sin(x) with cos(π/2 - x):\n\ncos(x) - 2cos(π/2 - x) = 0\n\nNow, let y = π/2 - x:\n\ncos(π/2 - y) - 2cos(y) = 0\n\nUsing the identity cos(π/2 - y) = sin(y):\n\nsin(y) - 2cos(y) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by cos(y):\n\ntan(y) = 2\n\ny = arctan(2)\n\nNow, we need to find the x values in the interval [0, 2π]:\n\nx = π/2 - y = π/2 - arctan(2)\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative to determine if this is a maximum or minimum:\n\nf''(x) = -sin(x) - 2cos(x)\n\nEvaluate f''(x) at x = π/2 - arctan(2):\n\nf''(π/2 - arctan(2)) = -sin(π/2 - arctan(2)) - 2cos(π/2 - arctan(2))\n\nSince arctan(2) is positive, π/2 - arctan(2) is in the first quadrant, where both sin and cos are positive. Therefore, f''(π/2 - arctan(2)) < 0, which means that x = π/2 - arctan(2) is a maximum.\n\nNow, we find the maximum and minimum values of f(x):\n\nf(π/2 - arctan(2)) = sin(π/2 - arctan(2)) + 2cos(π/2 - arctan(2))\n\nUsing the identity sin(π/2 - y) = cos(y) and cos(π/2 - y) = sin(y):\n\nf(π/2 - arctan(2)) = cos(arctan(2)) + 2sin(arctan(2))\n\nUsing the Pythagorean identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1:\n\ncos(arctan(2)) = √(1 - sin^2(arctan(2))) = √(1 - (2/√5)^2) = 1/√5\n\nsin(arctan(2)) = 2/√5\n\nf(π/2 - arctan(2)) = (1/√5) + 2(2/√5) = 5/√5 = √5\n\nThe maximum value of f(x) is √5.\n\nSince f(x) is periodic with a period of 2π, the minimum value occurs at x = 3π/2 - arctan(2):\n\nf(3π/2 - arctan(2)) = sin(3π/2 - arctan(2)) + 2cos(3π/2 - arctan(2))\n\nf(3π/2 - arctan(2)) = -cos(arctan(2)) + 2(-sin(arctan(2))) = -(1/√5) - 4/√5 = -5/√5 = -√5\n\nThe minimum value of f(x) is -√5.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum value of f(x) is √5 at x = π/2 - arctan(2), and the minimum value of f(x) is -√5 at x = 3π/2 - arctan(2)."
