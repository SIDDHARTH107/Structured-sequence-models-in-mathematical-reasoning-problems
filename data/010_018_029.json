    "message_2": "To compute the homology groups of this Morse-Smale complex, we will use the Morse inequalities. First, let's count the number of critical points of each index:\n\n- Index 0: 1 critical point\n- Index 1: 2 critical points\n- Index 2: 2 critical points\n\nNow, let's denote the Betti numbers of the Morse-Smale complex by b_i. The Morse inequalities state that:\n\n- b_0 ≤ 1 (number of index 0 critical points)\n- b_1 ≤ 2 (number of index 1 critical points)\n- b_2 ≤ 2 (number of index 2 critical points)\n\nSince the ascending and descending manifolds are all disks, the Morse-Smale complex is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex with one 0-cell, two 1-cells, and two 2-cells. This implies that the Euler characteristic of the Morse-Smale complex is:\n\nχ = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1\n\nThe Euler characteristic is also equal to the alternating sum of the Betti numbers:\n\nχ = b_0 - b_1 + b_2\n\nUsing the Morse inequalities and the Euler characteristic, we can deduce the Betti numbers:\n\n- b_0 = 1 (since b_0 ≤ 1 and χ = 1)\n- b_1 = 1 (since b_1 ≤ 2 and χ = 1)\n- b_2 = 1 (since b_2 ≤ 2 and χ = 1)\n\nTherefore, the homology groups of this Morse-Smale complex are:\n\n- H_0 = Z (since b_0 = 1)\n- H_1 = Z (since b_1 = 1)\n- H_2 = Z (since b_2 = 1)\n\nSo, the homology groups are H_0 = Z, H_1 = Z, and H_2 = Z."
