    "message_2": "A combinatorial design with parameters v, k, and 位 is called a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD). The number of blocks in a BIBD can be found using the following formula:\n\nb = (v * (v - 1) * 位) / (k * (k - 1))\n\nWhere b is the number of blocks, v is the number of points, k is the size of each block, and 位 is the index of replication.\n\nGiven the parameters v = 7, k = 3, and 位 = 1, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nb = (7 * (7 - 1) * 1) / (3 * (3 - 1))\nb = (7 * 6 * 1) / (3 * 2)\nb = 42 / 6\nb = 7\n\nSo, there are 7 blocks in this combinatorial design."
