    "message_2": "To solve the non-homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first two equations:\n\n1) x + 2y - z = 7\n2) 2x - y + z = 3\n\nAdd equations 1 and 2:\n\n3x + y = 10 (call this equation 4)\n\nNow, let's eliminate z from the second and third equations:\n\n2) 2x - y + z = 3\n3) 3x + y + 2z = 13\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 2:\n\n4x - 2y + 2z = 6\n\nAdd equations 3 and the modified equation 2:\n\n7x = 19\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 19/7\n\nNow, substitute x back into equation 4:\n\n3(19/7) + y = 10\n\nSolve for y:\n\ny = 10 - 3(19/7)\ny = (70 - 57) / 7\ny = 13/7\n\nNow, substitute x and y back into equation 1:\n\n(19/7) + 2(13/7) - z = 7\n\nSolve for z:\n\nz = (19 + 26) / 7 - 7\nz = 45/7 - 49/7\nz = -4/7\n\nSo, the solution to the non-homogeneous system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 19/7, y = 13/7, and z = -4/7."
