    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. The general formula for the Fourier series of a periodic function f(x) with period T is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(2πnx/T) + b_n * sin(2πnx/T)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor the given function, the period T = 2. We can find the Fourier coefficients using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/T) * ∫[f(x) * 1]dx over one period\na_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * cos(2πnx/T)]dx over one period\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * sin(2πnx/T)]dx over one period\n\nLet's find the coefficients:\n\n1. a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/2) * [∫(x^2 dx) from -1 to 1 + ∫(3 dx) from 1 to 2]\na_0 = (1/2) * [(1/3)x^3 | from -1 to 1 + 3x | from 1 to 2]\na_0 = (1/2) * [(1/3 - (-1/3)) + (6 - 3)]\na_0 = (1/2) * (2/3 + 3)\na_0 = (1/2) * (11/3)\na_0 = 11/6\n\n2. a_n:\n\na_n = (1/1) * [∫(x^2 * cos(2πnx) dx) from -1 to 1 + ∫(3 * cos(2πnx) dx) from 1 to 2]\na_n = [∫(x^2 * cos(2πnx) dx) from -1 to 1 + (3/2πn) * sin(2πnx) | from 1 to 2]\n\nThe first integral is an odd function, so its integral over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\n3. b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/1) * [∫(x^2 * sin(2πnx) dx) from -1 to 1 + ∫(3 * sin(2πnx) dx) from 1 to 2]\nb_n = [∫(x^2 * sin(2πnx) dx) from -1 to 1 + (-3/2πn) * cos(2πnx) | from 1 to 2]\n\nThe first integral is an even function, so its integral over a symmetric interval is twice the integral over half the interval:\n\nb_n = 2 * [∫(x^2 * sin(2πnx) dx) from 0 to 1] - (3/πn) * [cos(4πn) - cos(2πn)]\n\nTo solve the first integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x^2, dv = sin(2πnx) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = (-1/2πn) * cos(2πnx)\n\n∫(x^2 * sin(2πnx) dx) = uv - ∫(v * du)\n= (-x^2/2πn) * cos(2πnx) - ∫((-x/πn) * cos(2πnx) * 2x dx) from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts again:\n\nu = -x, dv = x * cos(2πnx) dx\ndu = -dx, v = (1/4π^2n^2) * sin(2πnx)\n\n∫((-x/πn) * cos(2πnx) * 2x dx) = uv - ∫(v * du)\n= (-x^2/4π^2n^2) * sin(2πnx) - ∫((-1/4π^2n^2) * sin(2πnx) dx) from 0 to 1\n\nNow, integrate the remaining integral:\n\n= (-x^2/4π^2n^2) * sin(2πnx) + (1/8π^3n^3) * cos(2πnx) | from 0 to 1\n\nNow, plug this back into the expression for b_n:\n\nb_n = 2 * [(-1/2πn) * cos(2πn) + (1/8π^3n^3) * cos(2πn) - (1/8π^3n^3)] - (3/πn) * [cos(4πn) - cos(2πn)]\n\nNow, we have the Fourier coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n. The Fourier series for the given function is:\n\nf(x) = 11/6 + Σ[0 * cos(2πnx) + b_n * sin(2πnx/T)]\n\nf(x) = 11/6 + Σ[b_n * sin(πnx)] for n = 1 to infinity\n\nwhere b_n is given by the expression above."
