    "message_1": "Consider the elliptic curve given by  $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2$ over the field $\\mathbb{Z}_7$. Calculate the number of points on this elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_7$.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_7$, we will plug in each value of $x$ from $0$ to $6$ (since we are working in the field $\\mathbb{Z}_7$) and check if there is a corresponding value of $y$ that satisfies the equation.\n\nFor each value of $x$, we will calculate the right-hand side of the equation and check if it is a quadratic residue in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$. If it is, then there are two possible values of $y$ (one positive and one negative) that satisfy the equation. If it is not a quadratic residue, then there are no points on the curve for that value of $x$.\n\n1. For $x = 0$: $y^2 = 0^3 + 2\\cdot0 + 2 = 2$. The quadratic residues in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$ are $\\{0, 1, 2, 4\\}$, so there are two points for $x = 0$.\n\n2. For $x = 1$: $y^2 = 1^3 + 2\\cdot1 + 2 = 5$. The quadratic non-residues in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$ are $\\{3, 5, 6\\}$, so there are no points for $x = 1$.\n\n3. For $x = 2$: $y^2 = 2^3 + 2\\cdot2 + 2 = 14 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. There are two points for $x = 2$.\n\n4. For $x = 3$: $y^2 = 3^3 + 2\\cdot3 + 2 = 35 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. There are two points for $x = 3$.\n\n5. For $x = 4$: $y^2 = 4^3 + 2\\cdot4 + 2 = 74 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$. There are two points for $x = 4$.\n\n6. For $x = 5$: $y^2 = 5^3 + 2\\cdot5 + 2 = 137 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$. There are no points for $x = 5$.\n\n7. For $x = 6$: $y^2 = 6^3 + 2\\cdot6 + 2 = 230 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. There are two points for $x = 6$.\n\nSo, there are a total of $2 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 10$ points on the elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_7$. However, we must also include the point at infinity, which is always a part of an elliptic curve. Therefore, there are a total of $10 + 1 = \\boxed{11}$ points on the elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_7$."
