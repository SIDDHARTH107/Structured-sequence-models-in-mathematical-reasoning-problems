The capacity of each route is 2000, 3000, and 4000 units per day respectively. Find the minimum number of days it will take for the factory to transport all the goods from source A to destination B if they can only use one route per day.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of days it will take for the factory to transport all the goods from source A to destination B, we should choose the route with the highest capacity. In this case, the route with the highest capacity is the one with 4000 units per day.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many days it will take to transport 6000 units using this route. We can do this by dividing the total number of units (6000) by the capacity of the chosen route (4000).\n\n6000 / 4000 = 1.5\n\nSince the factory can only use one route per day, they cannot transport goods for half a day. Therefore, they will need 2 days to transport all the goods from source A to destination B using the route with the highest capacity (4000 units per day)."
