    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the surface area of the top and bottom circles and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nThe top and bottom circles have the same radius (6 cm), so their areas are equal.\n\nArea of top circle = Area of bottom circle = π(6^2) = 36π cm^2\n\nNow, we need to find the lateral surface area. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nLateral surface area = 2π(6)(10) = 120π cm^2\n\nFinally, we add the areas of the top and bottom circles and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area.\n\nTotal surface area = 36π + 36π + 120π = 192π cm^2"
