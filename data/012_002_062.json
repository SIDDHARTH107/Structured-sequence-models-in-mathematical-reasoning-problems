    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of G, we first need to find the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph (Δ(G)). The chromatic number χ(G) is at most Δ(G) + 1, according to Brooks' theorem.\n\nSince G is a simple graph with 7 vertices and 11 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges, i.e., 2 * 11 = 22. The average degree of a vertex in G is therefore 22 / 7 ≈ 3.14.\n\nSince the average degree is greater than 3, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 4 or higher. Let's assume the maximum degree Δ(G) is 4. In this case, the chromatic number χ(G) is at most Δ(G) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nHowever, we can further refine our estimate by checking if G contains a subgraph that is a complete graph (i.e., a clique) with Δ(G) + 1 vertices. If G contains such a subgraph, then the chromatic number χ(G) must be equal to Δ(G) + 1.\n\nA complete graph with 5 vertices (K5) has (5 * (5 - 1)) / 2 = 10 edges. Since G has 11 edges, it is possible that G contains a K5 subgraph. However, if G contains a K5 subgraph, the remaining two vertices must be connected to at least one vertex in the K5 subgraph, which would require at least 12 edges in total (10 edges for K5 and 2 additional edges for the connections). This contradicts the fact that G has only 11 edges.\n\nTherefore, G does not contain a K5 subgraph, and the chromatic number χ(G) must be less than or equal to Δ(G) = 4.\n\nIn conclusion, the chromatic number of G is 4."
