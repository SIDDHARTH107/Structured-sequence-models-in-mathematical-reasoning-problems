The cost function is given by:\nC(x,y) = 10000 + 150x + 200y + 2xy - 0.005x^2 - 0.0025y^2\n\nwhere x is the amount of labor used (in hours) and y is the amount of material used (in kg). Using the whale optimization algorithm, determine the values of x and y that will minimize the cost of producing the new product.",
    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I am unable to run the Whale Optimization Algorithm directly. However, I can guide you on how to implement the algorithm to solve the given problem.\n\nThe Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to find the global minimum or maximum of a function. In this case, we want to minimize the cost function C(x, y).\n\nHere are the general steps to implement the WOA:\n\n1. Initialize the population of whales (solutions) randomly within the search space.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each whale in the population.\n3. Determine the best solution (whale) found so far.\n4. Update the position of each whale according to the WOA equations.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum number of iterations).\n\nTo apply the WOA to the given cost function, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the cost function C(x, y) in your programming language of choice.\n2. Set the search space limits for x and y based on the problem's constraints.\n3. Implement the WOA algorithm using the cost function and search space limits.\n4. Run the WOA algorithm and obtain the optimal values of x and y that minimize the cost function.\n\nAfter running the WOA, you will get the optimal values of x and y that minimize the cost of producing the new product. Note that the WOA is a heuristic algorithm, and the results may vary slightly between runs. You may need to run the algorithm multiple times and choose the best solution found across all runs."
