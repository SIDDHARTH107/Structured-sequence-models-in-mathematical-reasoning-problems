    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3)(4x - 7) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions that are being multiplied together:\n\nu(x) = x^2 + 3\nv(x) = 4x - 7\n\nNext, we find the derivatives of these functions:\n\nu'(x) = 2x\nv'(x) = 4\n\nNow, we apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nSubstitute the functions and their derivatives:\n\nf'(x) = (2x)(4x - 7) + (x^2 + 3)(4)\n\nNow, we simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 8x^2 - 14x + 4x^2 + 12\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 14x + 12\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3)(4x - 7) is:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 14x + 12"
