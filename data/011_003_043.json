    "message_1": "How many different ways are there to choose a committee of 5 members from a group of 10 people? Use Pascal's triangle to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Pascal's triangle, we need to find the binomial coefficient C(n, k), where n is the total number of people (10) and k is the number of people we want to choose (5). The binomial coefficient can be found in Pascal's triangle by looking at the (k+1)-th entry in the (n+1)-th row.\n\nPascal's triangle starts with the first row as 1, and each subsequent row is generated by adding the two numbers above it, with 1's on the sides:\n\n```\n       1\n      1 1\n     1 2 1\n    1 3 3 1\n   1 4 6 4 1\n  1 5 10 10 5 1\n 1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1\n```\n\nWe need to find the 6th entry (k+1 = 5+1 = 6) in the 11th row (n+1 = 10+1 = 11). We can continue building Pascal's triangle until we reach the 11th row:\n\n```\n  1  8  28  56  70  56  28  8  1\n 1  9  36  84 126 126  84  36  9  1\n1 10  45 120 210 252 210 120 45 10 1\n```\n\nThe 6th entry in the 11th row is 252. Therefore, there are 252 different ways to choose a committee of 5 members from a group of 10 people."
