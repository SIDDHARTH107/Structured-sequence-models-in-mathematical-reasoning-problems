    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal formed by recursively removing the central pyramid from each face of the original pyramid. In each iteration, the number of pyramids increases by a factor of 4.\n\nAfter the first iteration, there will be 4 pyramids.\nAfter the second iteration, there will be 4 * 4 = 16 pyramids.\nAfter the third iteration, there will be 4 * 16 = 64 pyramids.\n\nSo, after the third iteration, there will be 64 pyramids left."
