    "message_1": "A Sierpinski carpet is created by starting with a square and dividing it into nine congruent squares. The middle square is then removed, and the process is repeated with each remaining square. If a Sierpinski carpet has a total area of 81 square units, what is the area of the removed squares in the first three stages of the construction process?",
    "message_2": "In the first stage, the square is divided into 9 congruent squares, and the middle square is removed. The area of the removed square is 1/9 of the total area, which is 81/9 = 9 square units.\n\nIn the second stage, the process is repeated for each of the remaining 8 squares. Each of these squares has an area of 9 square units, so the area of the removed square in each of them is 1/9 of 9, which is 1 square unit. Since there are 8 such squares, the total area removed in the second stage is 8 * 1 = 8 square units.\n\nIn the third stage, the process is repeated for each of the remaining 8 * 8 = 64 squares. Each of these squares has an area of 1 square unit, so the area of the removed square in each of them is 1/9 of 1, which is 1/9 square units. Since there are 64 such squares, the total area removed in the third stage is 64 * 1/9 = 64/9 square units.\n\nThe total area of the removed squares in the first three stages is the sum of the areas removed in each stage: 9 + 8 + 64/9 = 17 + 64/9 = (153 + 64)/9 = 217/9 square units."
