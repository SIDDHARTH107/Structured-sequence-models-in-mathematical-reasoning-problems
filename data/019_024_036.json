    "message_1": "If a group of 7 people flip a coin and it comes up heads 5 times in a row, what is the probability that the next flip will also land on heads according to abductive logic?",
    "message_2": "Abductive logic is a form of reasoning that involves making the best possible explanation or inference based on the available evidence. In this case, the evidence is that the coin has landed on heads 5 times in a row. However, abductive logic does not change the inherent probability of a fair coin landing on heads or tails.\n\nAssuming the coin is fair, the probability of it landing on heads or tails is always 50%, regardless of the previous outcomes. So, the probability that the next flip will also land on heads is 1/2 or 50%."
