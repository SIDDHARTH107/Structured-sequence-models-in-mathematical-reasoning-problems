    "message_2": "To determine the parallel transport of the vector V = <2, 1, 4> along the curve C from t = 0 to t = 2π, we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve C. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the position vector with respect to t:\n\nT(t) = <dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt> = <-sin(t), cos(t), 2>\n\nNow, we need to ensure that the transported vector V(t) remains parallel to the curve at each point. This means that the derivative of V(t) with respect to t should be proportional to the tangent vector T(t). So, we have:\n\ndV(t)/dt = k(t) * T(t)\n\nwhere k(t) is a scalar function of t.\n\nLet V(t) = <a(t), b(t), c(t)>. Then, we have:\n\nda(t)/dt = -k(t) * sin(t)\ndb(t)/dt = k(t) * cos(t)\ndc(t)/dt = 2 * k(t)\n\nNow, we need to solve these differential equations with the initial condition V(0) = <2, 1, 4>. \n\nIntegrating the first equation, we get:\n\na(t) = -∫k(t) * sin(t) dt + A\na(0) = -A = 2\n=> A = -2\n=> a(t) = -∫k(t) * sin(t) dt - 2\n\nSimilarly, integrating the second equation, we get:\n\nb(t) = ∫k(t) * cos(t) dt + B\nb(0) = B = 1\n=> b(t) = ∫k(t) * cos(t) dt + 1\n\nIntegrating the third equation, we get:\n\nc(t) = 2 * ∫k(t) dt + C\nc(0) = C = 4\n=> c(t) = 2 * ∫k(t) dt + 4\n\nNow, we need to find the scalar function k(t) such that the transported vector V(t) = <a(t), b(t), c(t)> remains parallel to the curve at each point. Since we are considering parallel transport along a closed curve (from t = 0 to t = 2π), the transported vector should return to its initial value after one complete revolution. Therefore, we have:\n\nV(2π) = V(0) = <2, 1, 4>\n\nThis implies:\n\na(2π) = -∫[k(t) * sin(t)] dt - 2 = 2\nb(2π) = ∫[k(t) * cos(t)] dt + 1 = 1\nc(2π) = 2 * ∫k(t) dt + 4 = 4\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n\n∫[k(t) * cos(t)] dt = 0\n\nSince the integral of k(t) * cos(t) over a complete period is zero, we can conclude that the transported vector V(t) remains unchanged in the y-component:\n\nb(t) = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the functions a(t) and c(t) such that V(t) remains parallel to the curve at each point. Since the curve C is a helix, the parallel transport of V(t) along the curve will result in a rotation of the vector in the xz-plane. Therefore, we can write:\n\na(t) = 2 * cos(θ(t))\nc(t) = 4 + 2 * sin(θ(t))\n\nwhere θ(t) is the angle of rotation of the vector V(t) in the xz-plane.\n\nTo find θ(t), we can use the fact that the transported vector V(t) should return to its initial value after one complete revolution:\n\na(2π) = 2 * cos(θ(2π)) = 2\nc(2π) = 4 + 2 * sin(θ(2π)) = 4\n\nThis implies:\n\ncos(θ(2π)) = 1\nsin(θ(2π)) = 0\n\nSince θ(0) = 0, we can conclude that θ(t) = 0 for all t. Therefore, the transported vector V(t) remains unchanged:\n\nV(t) = <2, 1, 4>\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the vector V = <2, 1, 4> along the curve C from t = 0 to t = 2π is V(t) = <2, 1, 4>."
