    "message_1": "An appliance store wants to maximize its profit by selling refrigerators and washing machines. Each refrigerator costs $500 and sells for $800, while each washing machine costs $700 and sells for $1000. However, the store only has $50,000 to invest and room to store a maximum of 80 appliances. How many refrigerators and washing machines should the store purchase to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of refrigerators and y be the number of washing machines.\n\nWe have two constraints:\n\n1. The total cost of appliances should not exceed $50,000:\n500x + 700y ≤ 50,000\n\n2. The store can store a maximum of 80 appliances:\nx + y ≤ 80\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 300x + 300y, where 300 is the profit per refrigerator (800 - 500) and 300 is the profit per washing machine (1000 - 700).\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraint inequalities and finding the feasible region. Then, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the profit function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the constraint inequalities in slope-intercept form:\n\n1. 500x + 700y ≤ 50,000\ny ≤ (50,000 - 500x) / 700\n\n2. x + y ≤ 80\ny ≤ 80 - x\n\nNow, let's find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of y = (50,000 - 500x) / 700 and y = 80 - x:\n(50,000 - 500x) / 700 = 80 - x\n500x + 700x = 50,000 - 700 * 80\n1200x = 6,000\nx = 5\n\nSo, y = 80 - 5 = 75\n\n2. Intersection of y = (50,000 - 500x) / 700 and x = 0:\ny = (50,000 - 500 * 0) / 700\ny = 50,000 / 700\ny = 71.43 (rounded down to 71 since we can't have a fraction of an appliance)\n\nSo, x = 0 and y = 71\n\n3. Intersection of y = 80 - x and x = 0:\ny = 80 - 0\ny = 80\n\nSo, x = 0 and y = 80\n\nNow, let's evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 300x + 300y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(5, 75) = 300 * 5 + 300 * 75 = 1,500 + 22,500 = $24,000\n2. P(0, 71) = 300 * 0 + 300 * 71 = $21,300\n3. P(0, 80) = 300 * 0 + 300 * 80 = $24,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $24,000, which can be achieved by purchasing 5 refrigerators and 75 washing machines or by purchasing 80 washing machines."
