    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x - 2 < 7x + 6, we will first isolate the variable x.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 3x from both sides of the inequality:\n-2 < 4x + 6\n\nStep 2: Subtract 6 from both sides of the inequality:\n-8 < 4x\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides by 4:\n-2 < x\n\nSo the solution set for the inequality is x > -2. In interval notation, this is represented as (-2, âˆž)."
