    "message_1": "Consider a system that can be in one of two states: ON or OFF. The system always starts in the OFF state. You can change the state of the system by pressing a button, but it takes exactly four seconds for the system to respond to the button press. Suppose the button is pressed at time t=0, and at every integer time t, the state of the system is observed. Using temporal logic, write a formula that is satisfied if and only if the system is ON at some moment between t=5 and t=9.",
    "message_2": "Let P(t) represent the state of the system at time t, where P(t) is true if the system is ON and false if the system is OFF. Using temporal logic, we can write a formula that is satisfied if and only if the system is ON at some moment between t=5 and t=9:\n\nF(5 ≤ t ≤ 9 ∧ P(t))\n\nThis formula states that there exists a future time t such that t is between 5 and 9 (inclusive) and the system is ON at that time."
