    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function $f(x) = \\frac{x}{1+4x^2}$ as $x$ approaches 1, we can simply substitute the value of $x$ into the function:\n\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x}{1+4x^2} = \\frac{1}{1+4(1)^2} = \\frac{1}{1+4} = \\frac{1}{5}$$\n\nSo, the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches 1 is $\\frac{1}{5}$."
