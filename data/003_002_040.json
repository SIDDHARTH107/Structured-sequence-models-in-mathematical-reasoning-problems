    "message_2": "To find the length of the adjacent and opposite sides of the triangle, we can use the sine and cosine functions for the 60-degree angle.\n\nThe sine of a 60-degree angle is √3/2, and the cosine of a 60-degree angle is 1/2.\n\nLet's denote the adjacent side as 'a' and the opposite side as 'o'.\n\nUsing the sine function:\nsin(60) = o/10\no = 10 * sin(60) = 10 * (√3/2) = 5√3 cm\n\nUsing the cosine function:\ncos(60) = a/10\na = 10 * cos(60) = 10 * (1/2) = 5 cm\n\nSo, the adjacent side (a) is 5 cm, and the opposite side (o) is 5√3 cm.\n\nNow, let's find the values of sine, cosine, and tangent of the 60-degree angle.\n\nsin(60) = o/hypotenuse = (5√3)/10 = √3/2\ncos(60) = a/hypotenuse = 5/10 = 1/2\ntan(60) = o/a = (5√3)/5 = √3\n\nTherefore, the values of sine, cosine, and tangent of the 60-degree angle are sin(60) = √3/2, cos(60) = 1/2, and tan(60) = √3."
