    "message_1": "A magician has 12 red cards and 8 black cards in a deck of cards for an upcoming performance. If the magician randomly selects 4 cards to perform a trick, what is the probability that all 4 cards will be red?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that all 4 cards will be red, we can use the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of cards and k is the number of cards we want to choose.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of ways to choose 4 cards from the deck of 20 cards (12 red and 8 black):\n\nC(20, 4) = 20! / (4!(20-4)!) = 20! / (4!16!) = 4845\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to choose 4 red cards from the 12 red cards:\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12-4)!) = 12! / (4!8!) = 495\n\nNow, we can find the probability of choosing 4 red cards by dividing the number of ways to choose 4 red cards by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards:\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to choose 4 red cards) / (Total number of ways to choose 4 cards)\nProbability = 495 / 4845\n\nProbability = 0.1022\n\nSo, the probability that all 4 cards will be red is approximately 0.1022 or 10.22%."
