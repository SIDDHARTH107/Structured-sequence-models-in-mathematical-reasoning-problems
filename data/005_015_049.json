They recorded the amount spent by each customer in the past 6 months, in thousands of dollars:\n\nCustomer 1: 5, 3, 4, 6, 2, 5\nCustomer 2: 7, 5, 6, 8, 4, 5\nCustomer 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nCustomer 4: 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5\nCustomer 5: 6, 8, 7, 9, 6, 10\n\nUsing K-means clustering with 3 clusters, perform the algorithm until convergence and state which customers belong to each of the 3 resulting clusters.",

We can use the first three customers' spending habits as the initial centroids:\n\nCentroid 1: 5, 3, 4, 6, 2, 5 (Customer 1)\nCentroid 2: 7, 5, 6, 8, 4, 5 (Customer 2)\nCentroid 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (Customer 3)\n\nNow, we calculate the Euclidean distance between each customer and the centroids, and assign each customer to the nearest centroid:\n\nCustomer 1: C1 (0), C2 (4.69), C3 (6.16) -> Cluster 1\nCustomer 2: C1 (4.69), C2 (0), C3 (9.22) -> Cluster 2\nCustomer 3: C1 (6.16), C2 (9.22), C3 (0) -> Cluster 3\nCustomer 4: C1 (3.74), C2 (7.68), C3 (3.16) -> Cluster 3\nCustomer 5: C1 (8.49), C2 (5.57), C3 (11.18) -> Cluster 2\n\nNow, we update the centroids by calculating the mean of each cluster:\n\nCentroid 1: (5, 3, 4, 6, 2, 5) -> (5, 3, 4, 6, 2, 5)\nCentroid 2: (7, 5, 6, 8, 4, 5), (6, 8, 7, 9, 6, 10) -> (6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 8.5, 5, 7.5)\nCentroid 3: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), (2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5) -> (1.5, 3, 2, 3.5, 3.5, 5.5)\n\nWe repeat the process of assigning customers to the nearest centroid:\n\nCustomer 1: C1 (0), C2 (5.31), C3 (5.74) -> Cluster 1\nCustomer 2: C1 (4.69), C2 (2.5), C3 (8.12) -> Cluster 2\nCustomer 3: C1 (6.16), C2 (8.12), C3 (2.5) -> Cluster 3\nCustomer 4: C1 (3.74), C2 (6.5), C3 (1.87) -> Cluster 3\nCustomer 5: C1 (8.49), C2 (3.54), C3 (10.56) -> Cluster 2\n\nThe cluster assignments have not changed, so the algorithm has converged.\n\nThe final clusters are:\n\nCluster 1: Customer 1\nCluster 2: Customer 2, Customer 5\nCluster 3: Customer 3, Customer 4"
