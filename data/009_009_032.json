    "message_2": "For a particle confined in a one-dimensional box of length L, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is given by:\n\n(-ħ² / 2m) (d²ψ(x) / dx²) + V(x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, ψ(x) is the wave function, V(x) is the potential energy, and E is the energy of the particle.\n\nIn this case, the potential energy V(x) is zero inside the box (0 < x < L) and infinite outside the box. Therefore, the Schrödinger equation inside the box becomes:\n\n(-ħ² / 2m) (d²ψ(x) / dx²) = Eψ(x)\n\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\nψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = sqrt(2mE / ħ²).\n\nSince the wave function must be zero at the boundaries of the box (x = 0 and x = L), we get:\n\nψ(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0\nψ(L) = A sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the wave function would be trivial), we must have sin(kL) = 0. This implies that kL = nπ, where n is a positive integer. Therefore, the quantized wave number k_n and energy E_n are given by:\n\nk_n = nπ / L\nE_n = (ħ² k_n²) / (2m) = (n²π²ħ²) / (2mL²)\n\nThe lowest energy state corresponds to n = 1:\n\nE_1 = (π²ħ²) / (2mL²)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for L, m (mass of an electron), and ħ:\n\nL = 2 nm = 2 × 10^(-9) m\nm = 9.109 × 10^(-31) kg (mass of an electron)\nħ = 1.055 × 10^(-34) Js (reduced Planck constant)\n\nE_1 = (π² × (1.055 × 10^(-34) Js)²) / (2 × 9.109 × 10^(-31) kg × (2 × 10^(-9) m)²)\n\nE_1 ≈ 9.39 × 10^(-20) J\n\nTo convert the energy to electron volts (eV), we divide by the elementary charge:\n\n1 eV = 1.602 × 10^(-19) C\n\nE_1 ≈ (9.39 × 10^(-20) J) / (1.602 × 10^(-19) C) ≈ 0.586 eV\n\nSo, the energy of the particle in the lowest energy state is approximately 0.586 eV."
