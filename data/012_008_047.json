    "message_2": "To determine if a graph G is planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have v = 7 and e = 10. We can also use the inequality for planar graphs, which states that for a simple, connected, planar graph with at least three vertices (v ≥ 3):\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nLet's check if the inequality holds for our graph:\n\n10 ≤ 3 * 7 - 6\n10 ≤ 21 - 6\n10 ≤ 15\n\nThe inequality holds, so the graph might be planar. However, this is not a guarantee, so we need to check further.\n\nNow let's try to find the number of faces (f) using Euler's formula:\n\n7 - 10 + f = 2\nf = 5\n\nSince we have found a valid value for f, it is possible that the graph is planar. However, to be completely sure, we would need to either find a planar drawing of the graph or prove that no such drawing exists. Without more information about the specific connections between vertices in the graph, we cannot definitively conclude whether the graph is planar or not."
