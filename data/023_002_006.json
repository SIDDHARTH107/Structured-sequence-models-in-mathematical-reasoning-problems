    "message_2": "To determine if the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] converges at x = 0, we first need to find the Fourier series representation of f(x). The Fourier series of a function f(x) on the interval [-π, π] is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, given by:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nFor f(x) = x, we can calculate the coefficients as follows:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x dx = 0 (since the integral of x over a symmetric interval around 0 is 0)\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(nx) dx = 0 (since the integral of an odd function times an even function over a symmetric interval around 0 is 0)\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx\nTo calculate b_n, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(nx) - ∫ (-1/n) * cos(nx) dx] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(nx) + (1/n^2) * sin(nx)] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/n^2) * sin(nπ) - (1/n^2) * sin(-nπ)] (since cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and cos(-nπ) = (-1)^n)\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, we have:\n\nb_n = 0\n\nThus, the Fourier series of f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = 0\n\nNow, we can check if the Fourier series converges at x = 0:\n\nf(0) = 0\n\nSince the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x is identically zero, it converges at x = 0, and its sum is 0."
