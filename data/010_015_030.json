Suppose $H_{\\text{dR}}^k(M)$ denotes the $k$th de Rham cohomology group of $M$. Show that the cup product $\\omega \\smile \\cdot : H_{\\text{dR}}^{i}(M) \\to H_{\\text{dR}}^{i+k}(M)$ is injective and find its image dimension.",
    "message_2": "To show that the cup product $\\omega \\smile \\cdot : H_{\\text{dR}}^{i}(M) \\to H_{\\text{dR}}^{i+k}(M)$ is injective, we need to show that if $\\alpha \\in H_{\\text{dR}}^{i}(M)$ and $\\omega \\smile \\alpha = 0$, then $\\alpha = 0$. \n\nRecall that the cup product is defined as $\\omega \\smile \\alpha = \\omega \\wedge \\alpha$. So, we have $\\omega \\wedge \\alpha = 0$. Since $\\omega$ is a closed $k$-form, we have $d\\omega = 0$. Also, since $\\alpha \\in H_{\\text{dR}}^{i}(M)$, it represents a cohomology class, and there exists a closed $i$-form $\\alpha'$ such that $\\alpha = [\\alpha']$. Thus, $d\\alpha' = 0$. \n\nNow, we have $\\omega \\wedge \\alpha' = 0$. Taking the exterior derivative of both sides, we get $d(\\omega \\wedge \\alpha') = 0$. Using the product rule for exterior derivatives, we have $(d\\omega) \\wedge \\alpha' + (-1)^k \\omega \\wedge (d\\alpha') = 0$. Since $d\\omega = 0$ and $d\\alpha' = 0$, this equation simplifies to $0 = 0$, which doesn't give us any new information.\n\nTo proceed, we will use the fact that $M$ is a compact manifold. By the Poincar√© lemma, there exists a $(k-1)$-form $\\beta$ such that $\\omega = d\\beta$. Now, we have $d\\beta \\wedge \\alpha' = 0$. Since $d(\\beta \\wedge \\alpha') = (d\\beta) \\wedge \\alpha' + (-1)^{k-1} \\beta \\wedge (d\\alpha')$, we get $d(\\beta \\wedge \\alpha') = 0$. \n\nNow, consider the $(i+k-1)$-form $\\beta \\wedge \\alpha'$. Since $d(\\beta \\wedge \\alpha') = 0$, it is a closed form. Moreover, we have $\\omega \\wedge \\alpha' = d\\beta \\wedge \\alpha' = d(\\beta \\wedge \\alpha')$. Thus, $\\omega \\smile \\alpha = [\\omega \\wedge \\alpha'] = [d(\\beta \\wedge \\alpha')] = 0$ in $H_{\\text{dR}}^{i+k}(M)$. \n\nSince $\\omega \\smile \\alpha = 0$, we have $\\alpha = [\\alpha'] = 0$ in $H_{\\text{dR}}^{i}(M)$. This shows that the cup product $\\omega \\smile \\cdot : H_{\\text{dR}}^{i}(M) \\to H_{\\text{dR}}^{i+k}(M)$ is injective.\n\nNow, let's find the image dimension of the cup product. Since the cup product is injective, the image dimension is equal to the dimension of the domain, which is the dimension of $H_{\\text{dR}}^{i}(M)$. So, the image dimension of the cup product is $\\dim H_{\\text{dR}}^{i}(M)$."
