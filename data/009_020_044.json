    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, let's rewrite the system of differential equations with the control function u(t):\n\ndx/dt = x + y^2 + u(t)\ndy/dt = x - y\n\nNow, let's define the Hamiltonian function H(x, y, p_x, p_y, u) as follows:\n\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y, u) = p_x(x + y^2 + u) + p_y(x - y) + x^2 + y^2 + u^2\n\nwhere p_x and p_y are the costate variables. According to the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, we need to find the control function u(t) that minimizes the Hamiltonian function. To do this, we will take the partial derivative of H with respect to u and set it equal to zero:\n\n∂H/∂u = 2u + p_x = 0\n\nSolving for u, we get:\n\nu(t) = -1/2 * p_x(t)\n\nNow, we need to find the costate equations. These are given by the negative partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian function with respect to x and y:\n\ndp_x/dt = -∂H/∂x = -p_x - p_y + 2x\ndp_y/dt = -∂H/∂y = -2yp_x + p_y + 2y\n\nNow, we have a new system of four differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = x + y^2 - 1/2 * p_x\ndy/dt = x - y\ndp_x/dt = -p_x - p_y + 2x\ndp_y/dt = -2yp_x + p_y + 2y\n\nwith the initial conditions x(0) = 1, y(0) = 0 and the final conditions x(1) = 0, y(1) = 1.\n\nTo solve this system of differential equations, we can use numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method or the shooting method. Once we have the solutions for x(t), y(t), p_x(t), and p_y(t), we can find the optimal control function u(t) using the expression:\n\nu(t) = -1/2 * p_x(t)\n\nThis will give us the optimal control function u(t) that minimizes the cost functional J[u] subject to the given initial and final conditions."
