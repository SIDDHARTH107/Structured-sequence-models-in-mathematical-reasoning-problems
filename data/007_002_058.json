    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 3^201 is divided by 5, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. We want to find 3^201 mod 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the pattern of remainders when powers of 3 are divided by 5:\n\n3^1 mod 5 = 3\n3^2 mod 5 = 9 mod 5 = 4\n3^3 mod 5 = 27 mod 5 = 2\n3^4 mod 5 = 81 mod 5 = 1\n3^5 mod 5 = 243 mod 5 = 3\n...\n\nWe can see that the remainders repeat in a cycle of 4: 3, 4, 2, 1. \n\nNow, we can find which remainder corresponds to 3^201:\n\n201 mod 4 = 1\n\nThis means that 3^201 has the same remainder as 3^1 when divided by 5. Therefore, the remainder when 3^201 is divided by 5 is 3."
