    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Stirling numbers of the second kind. Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted by S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets.\n\nIn this case, we have 10 distinct items and want to divide them into 3 non-empty subsets. So, we need to find S(10, 3).\n\nUsing the Stirling numbers of the second kind formula:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe can calculate S(10, 3) as follows:\n\nS(10, 3) = 3 * S(9, 3) + S(9, 2)\n\nNow, we need to find S(9, 3) and S(9, 2).\n\nS(9, 3) = 3 * S(8, 3) + S(8, 2)\nS(9, 2) = 2 * S(8, 2) + S(8, 1)\n\nContinuing this process, we can find the values for S(8, 3), S(8, 2), and S(8, 1):\n\nS(8, 3) = 3 * S(7, 3) + S(7, 2)\nS(8, 2) = 2 * S(7, 2) + S(7, 1)\nS(8, 1) = 1 (since there's only one way to put all 8 elements into a single subset)\n\nNow, we need to find S(7, 3) and S(7, 2):\n\nS(7, 3) = 3 * S(6, 3) + S(6, 2)\nS(7, 2) = 2 * S(6, 2) + S(6, 1)\n\nContinuing this process, we can find the values for S(6, 3), S(6, 2), and S(6, 1):\n\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)\nS(6, 2) = 2 * S(5, 2) + S(5, 1)\nS(6, 1) = 1 (since there's only one way to put all 6 elements into a single subset)\n\nNow, we need to find S(5, 3) and S(5, 2):\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\nS(5, 2) = 2 * S(4, 2) + S(4, 1)\n\nFinally, we can find the values for S(4, 3), S(4, 2), and S(4, 1):\n\nS(4, 3) = 6\nS(4, 2) = 7\nS(4, 1) = 1 (since there's only one way to put all 4 elements into a single subset)\n\nNow we can work our way back up:\n\nS(5, 3) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\nS(5, 2) = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15\n\nS(6, 3) = 3 * 25 + 15 = 90\nS(6, 2) = 2 * 15 + 1 = 31\n\nS(7, 3) = 3 * 90 + 31 = 301\nS(7, 2) = 2 * 31 + 1 = 63\n\nS(8, 3) = 3 * 301 + 63 = 966\nS(8, 2) = 2 * 63 + 1 = 127\n\nS(9, 3) = 3 * 966 + 127 = 3025\nS(9, 2) = 2 * 127 + 1 = 255\n\nFinally, we get the answer:\n\nS(10, 3) = 3 * 3025 + 255 = 9300\n\nSo, there are 9,300 ways to divide a set of 10 distinct items into 3 non-empty subsets with each subset having at least 2 items."
