    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(3,4) is the smallest integer n such that any complete graph K_n with its edges colored either red or blue will contain either a red K_3 (a triangle with all edges red) or a blue K_4 (a complete graph with 4 vertices and all edges blue).\n\nTo find R(3,4), we can use the inequality R(m,n) ≤ R(m-1,n) + R(m,n-1) for m, n ≥ 2. \n\nUsing this inequality, we get:\n\nR(3,4) ≤ R(2,4) + R(3,3)\n\nWe know that R(2,4) = 4 (since we need at least 4 vertices to guarantee a blue K_4) and R(3,3) = 6 (since we need at least 6 vertices to guarantee a red K_3 or a blue K_3).\n\nSo, R(3,4) ≤ 4 + 6 = 10.\n\nNow, we need to show that there exists a graph with 9 vertices that does not contain a red K_3 or a blue K_4. We can do this by constructing a graph with 9 vertices, where each vertex is connected to 3 other vertices with red edges and 5 other vertices with blue edges. This graph does not contain a red K_3 or a blue K_4.\n\nTherefore, the Ramsey number R(3,4) is 10."
