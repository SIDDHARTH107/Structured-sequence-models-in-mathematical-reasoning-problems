    "message_1": "Here is an example problem for a math student to solve on the subtopic of solving systems of linear equations with singular matrices:\n\nSolve the following system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination:\n```\n2x + 3y - z = 4\n4x + 6y - 2z = 8\n2x + 3y - z = 7\n```\nNote: This system has a singular matrix, which means it has infinitely many solutions or no solution at all. Determine which case applies in this example.",
    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n```\n| 2  3 -1 | 4\n| 4  6 -2 | 8\n| 2  3 -1 | 7\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the matrix.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n| 1  3/2 -1/2 | 2\n| 4  6  -2   | 8\n| 2  3  -1   | 7\n```\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with the second row minus 4 times the first row, and replace the third row with the third row minus 2 times the first row:\n\n```\n| 1  3/2 -1/2 |  2\n| 0  0    0   |  0\n| 0  0    0   |  3\n```\n\nNow, we have the row echelon form of the matrix. We can see that the third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 3, which is a contradiction. This means that the given system of linear equations has no solution. In this case, the system is inconsistent, and the singular matrix indicates that there is no unique solution."
