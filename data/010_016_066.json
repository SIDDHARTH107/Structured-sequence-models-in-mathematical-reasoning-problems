    "message_2": "Let M and N be two closed, connected, orientable, non-intersecting, embedded 2-dimensional manifolds in X. Since X is a compact, connected, orientable, topological manifold of dimension 3, we can apply Poincaré duality.\n\nPoincaré duality states that the homology groups of X are isomorphic to the cohomology groups of X with complementary dimensions. In particular, we have:\n\nH_1(X) ≅ H^2(X) and H_2(X) ≅ H^1(X)\n\nSince H_1(X) and H_2(X) are both isomorphic to Z, we have:\n\nH^1(X) ≅ H^2(X) ≅ Z\n\nNow, let [M] and [N] be the homology classes represented by M and N in H_2(X), respectively. We want to compute the intersection number of M and N, which is given by the cup product of their dual cohomology classes in H^1(X):\n\n<[M] ∪ [N], [X]> = <[M]^∗ ∪ [N]^∗, [X]>\n\nwhere [M]^∗ and [N]^∗ are the Poincaré duals of [M] and [N] in H^1(X), and [X] is the fundamental class of X in H_3(X).\n\nSince H^1(X) ≅ H^2(X) ≅ Z, we can represent [M]^∗ and [N]^∗ as integer multiples of a generator of H^1(X). Let's say [M]^∗ = m·g^1 and [N]^∗ = n·g^1, where m and n are integers, and g^1 is a generator of H^1(X).\n\nThen, the cup product [M]^∗ ∪ [N]^∗ is given by:\n\n[M]^∗ ∪ [N]^∗ = (m·g^1) ∪ (n·g^1) = mn·(g^1 ∪ g^1)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the pairing <mn·(g^1 ∪ g^1), [X]>. Since g^1 ∪ g^1 is a generator of H^2(X) and [X] is the fundamental class of X in H_3(X), their pairing evaluates to the intersection number of M and N:\n\n<[M] ∪ [N], [X]> = mn\n\nThus, the intersection number of M and N is given by the product of the coefficients m and n, which are integers."
