    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups of G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 27\n\nThe possible values for n_3 are 1 and 27. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, which must be normal. Let P be this normal 3-Sylow subgroup. Since P is of order 27 and is normal, it follows that G is cyclic, as G ≅ Z_27.\n\nNow, suppose n_3 = 27. In this case, there are 27 3-Sylow subgroups of G, each of order 9. Let P be one of these 3-Sylow subgroups. Since the index of P in G is 3, which is the smallest prime divisor of |G|, by the Normalizer-Centralizer Theorem, P is normal in G. \n\nLet Q be another 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P and Q are both of order 9, they must have non-trivial intersection, i.e., |P ∩ Q| ≥ 3. Let x be an element in P ∩ Q with order 3. Then, the centralizer of x in G, denoted by C_G(x), contains both P and Q, as x is in both P and Q. Since P and Q are normal in G, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since P and Q are both of order 9 and their intersection has order 3, we have |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 9 * 9 / 3 = 27. Thus, PQ = G.\n\nNow, let H = ⟨x⟩ be the subgroup generated by x. Since x is in the center of both P and Q, it follows that H is in the center of G. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and a group of order 9, i.e., G ≅ Z_3 × K, where K is a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic (G ≅ Z_27) or isomorphic to the direct product of Z_3 and a group of order 9 (G ≅ Z_3 × K)."
