    "message_1": "Let's say there are two loops A and B on a torus surface, represented by closed curves. Loop A can be continuously deformed into loop B without leaving the surface of the torus. What is the homotopy class of these loops, and what is the value of the corresponding homotopy group?",
    "message_2": "Since loop A can be continuously deformed into loop B without leaving the surface of the torus, they belong to the same homotopy class. The torus can be represented as a square with opposite sides identified, and the fundamental group of the torus is given by the free product of two copies of the integers, denoted as Z × Z.\n\nThe homotopy class of these loops can be represented by an ordered pair of integers (m, n), where m and n are the winding numbers around the two non-contractible cycles of the torus. The homotopy group corresponding to this homotopy class is the fundamental group of the torus, which is Z × Z."
