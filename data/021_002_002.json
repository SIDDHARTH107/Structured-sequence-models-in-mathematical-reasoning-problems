    "message_2": "The power iteration method is an iterative algorithm used to find the dominant eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of a matrix. The method is as follows:\n\n1. Choose an initial guess for the eigenvector, x0.\n2. Multiply the matrix A by the current eigenvector guess, x.\n3. Normalize the resulting vector.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\n\nLet's perform the power iteration method for the given matrix A and initial guess x0:\n\nMatrix A:\n[[3, 7],\n [1, 5]]\n\nInitial guess x0:\n[1, 1]\n\nIteration 1:\n1. Ax0 = [[3, 7], [1, 5]] * [1, 1] = [10, 6]\n2. Normalize the resulting vector: [10/11.66, 6/11.66] = [0.86, 0.51]\n\nIteration 2:\n1. Ax1 = [[3, 7], [1, 5]] * [0.86, 0.51] = [5.49, 3.43]\n2. Normalize the resulting vector: [5.49/6.35, 3.43/6.35] = [0.86, 0.54]\n\nIteration 3:\n1. Ax2 = [[3, 7], [1, 5]] * [0.86, 0.54] = [5.52, 3.46]\n2. Normalize the resulting vector: [5.52/6.38, 3.46/6.38] = [0.86, 0.54]\n\nThe eigenvector has converged to [0.86, 0.54]. Now, let's find the dominant eigenvalue using the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nEigenvalue = (Ax ⋅ x) / (x ⋅ x)\nEigenvalue = ([5.52, 3.46] ⋅ [0.86, 0.54]) / ([0.86, 0.54] ⋅ [0.86, 0.54])\nEigenvalue = (4.74 + 1.86) / (0.74 + 0.29)\nEigenvalue = 6.60 / 1.03\nEigenvalue ≈ 6.408\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue is approximately 6.408, and the corresponding eigenvector is [0.86, 0.54]."
