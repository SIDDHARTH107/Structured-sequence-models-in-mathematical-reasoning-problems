    "message_2": "First, let's find the Fourier sine series of f(x) = 3x on the interval [-π, π], since the boundary conditions are homogeneous Dirichlet conditions (u(-π) = u(π) = 0). The Fourier sine series of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = Σ[(2/L) * ∫(from 0 to L) f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] * sin(nπx/L)\n\nwhere L = π in this case. We need to find the coefficients B_n:\n\nB_n = (2/π) * ∫(from 0 to π) 3x * sin(nπx/π) dx\n\nTo find the integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 3x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = 3 dx, v = -(1/n)cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nB_n = (2/π) * [(-3x(1/n)cos(nx))|_0^π + (3/n) * ∫(from 0 to π) cos(nx) dx]\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of cos(nx) from 0 to π:\n\n∫(from 0 to π) cos(nx) dx = (1/n) * [sin(nx)]|_0^π = 0 (since sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n)\n\nSo, B_n = (2/π) * [(-3x(1/n)cos(nx))|_0^π] = (6/n) * [(-1)^n - 1]\n\nNow, we have the Fourier sine series for f(x) = 3x:\n\nf(x) = Σ[(6/n) * [(-1)^n - 1] * sin(nx)]\n\nNow, let's solve the boundary value problem:\n\nu''(x) + 9u(x) = 3x, with u(-π) = u(π) = 0\n\nSince we have the Fourier sine series for 3x, we can find the Fourier sine series for u(x) by solving the ODE for each term in the series:\n\nv''(x) + 9v(x) = sin(nx), where v(x) is the nth term of the Fourier sine series for u(x)\n\nThe general solution of the homogeneous equation v''(x) + 9v(x) = 0 is:\n\nv(x) = A * cos(3x) + B * sin(3x)\n\nThe particular solution of the non-homogeneous equation can be found using the method of undetermined coefficients. We guess a particular solution of the form:\n\nv_p(x) = Cx * sin(nx)\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives:\n\nv_p'(x) = C * [sin(nx) + nx * cos(nx)]\nv_p''(x) = C * [2n * cos(nx) - n^2 * x * sin(nx)]\n\nSubstituting v_p''(x) and v_p(x) into the non-homogeneous equation:\n\nC * [2n * cos(nx) - n^2 * x * sin(nx)] + 9C * x * sin(nx) = sin(nx)\n\nComparing the coefficients of sin(nx) and cos(nx), we get:\n\n9C = 1, C = 1/9\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\nv_p(x) = (1/9) * x * sin(nx)\n\nThe general solution of the non-homogeneous equation is:\n\nv(x) = A * cos(3x) + B * sin(3x) + (1/9) * x * sin(nx)\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions:\n\nu(-π) = u(π) = 0\n\nv(-π) = A * cos(3(-π)) + B * sin(3(-π)) + (1/9) * (-π) * sin(n(-π)) = 0\nv(π) = A * cos(3π) + B * sin(3π) + (1/9) * π * sin(nπ) = 0\n\nSince sin(3π) = 0 and sin(nπ) = 0, we get:\n\nA = 0\n\nSo, the solution u(x) is the sum of the general solutions v(x) for each term in the Fourier sine series:\n\nu(x) = Σ[(1/9) * x * sin(nx) + B_n * sin(3x)]\n\nSince B_n = (6/n) * [(-1)^n - 1], the final solution is:\n\nu(x) = Σ[(1/9) * x * sin(nx) + (6/n) * [(-1)^n - 1] * sin(3x)]"
