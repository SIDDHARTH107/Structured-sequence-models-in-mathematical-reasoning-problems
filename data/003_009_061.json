    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides of lengths 6 and 8, and an included angle of 120 degrees. What is the perimeter of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to determine the length of the third side. We can use the Law of Cosines to do this. The Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and C is the included angle between sides a and b.\n\nIn this case, a = 6, b = 8, and C = 120 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (120 * π) / 180 = (2 * π) / 3\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of side c:\n\nc² = 6² + 8² - 2 * 6 * 8 * cos((2 * π) / 3)\nc² = 36 + 64 - 96 * (-0.5)\nc² = 100 + 48\nc² = 148\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √148 ≈ 12.17\n\nNow that we have the length of all three sides, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c = 6 + 8 + 12.17 ≈ 26.17"
