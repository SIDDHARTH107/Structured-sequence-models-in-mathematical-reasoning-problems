    "message_2": "We will prove that L is not a decidable language by showing that it is not context-free. We will use the Pumping Lemma for context-free languages to do this.\n\nThe Pumping Lemma for context-free languages states that for any context-free language L, there exists a constant p (the pumping length) such that for any string s in L with length at least p, we can write s = uvwxy with the following conditions:\n\n1. |vwx| ≤ p\n2. |vx| ≥ 1\n3. For all i ≥ 0, u(v^i)w(x^i)y is in L\n\nNow, let's assume that L is context-free. Then, there exists a constant p for L according to the Pumping Lemma. Let's choose the string s = 0^p1^p2^p, which is in L and has length 3p (greater than p). According to the Pumping Lemma, we can write s = uvwxy with the conditions mentioned above.\n\nNow, we will show that for any possible partition of s into uvwxy, at least one of the conditions will be violated, leading to a contradiction.\n\nCase 1: v or x contains more than one type of symbol (e.g., 0 and 1, or 1 and 2). In this case, when we pump v or x (i.e., i ≠ 1), the order of the symbols in the string will be disrupted, and the resulting string will not be in L. This violates condition 3.\n\nCase 2: v or x contains only one type of symbol. Without loss of generality, let's assume v contains only 0s and x contains only 1s. When we pump v and x (i.e., i ≠ 1), the number of 0s and 1s in the string will change, but the number of 2s will remain the same. This will result in a string that is not in L, violating condition 3.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that condition 3 is violated, which contradicts the Pumping Lemma. Therefore, our assumption that L is context-free is incorrect, and L is not a context-free language.\n\nSince every decidable language is also context-free, and we have shown that L is not context-free, it follows that L is not a decidable language."
