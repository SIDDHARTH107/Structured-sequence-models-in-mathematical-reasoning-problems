    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that increases in complexity with each order. The perimeter of a Hilbert curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 4^(order) * length of each segment\n\nIn this case, the order is 5, and the length of each segment is 1 unit. So the perimeter of a Hilbert curve of order 5 is:\n\nPerimeter = 4^5 * 1 = 1024 units"
