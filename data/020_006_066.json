    "message_1": "A factory produces two products: Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 3 hours of processing time and 2 hours of packaging time, while each unit of Product B requires 2 hours of processing time and 1 hour of packaging time. The factory has 50 hours of processing time and 30 hours of packaging time available each week. The profit for each unit of Product A is $10 and for each unit of Product B is $8. The factory wants to maximize the weekly profit. Determine the number of units of each product the factory should produce using Mixed-Integer Programming.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit):\nP = 10x + 8y\n\nConstraints (processing and packaging time):\n3x + 2y ≤ 50 (processing time)\n2x + y ≤ 30 (packaging time)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negative units)\n\nWe can solve this problem using the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll rewrite the constraints in terms of y:\n\ny ≤ (50 - 3x) / 2\ny ≤ 30 - 2x\n\nNow, we'll plot these constraints along with the non-negative constraints:\n\n1. y ≤ (50 - 3x) / 2\n2. y ≤ 30 - 2x\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is the quadrilateral with vertices (0, 0), (0, 15), (10, 10), and (16.67, 0).\n\nNow, we'll find the profit at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 15) = 10(0) + 8(15) = $120\n3. P(10, 10) = 10(10) + 8(10) = $180\n4. P(16.67, 0) = 10(16.67) + 8(0) ≈ $166.70\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when producing 10 units of Product A and 10 units of Product B, resulting in a weekly profit of $180."
