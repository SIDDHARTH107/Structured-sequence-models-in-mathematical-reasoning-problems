A set X is a subset of another set Y if every element of X is also an element of Y.\n\nFor set A:\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ A and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ A and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of A are also in A ∪ B, A is a subset of A ∪ B.\n\nFor set B:\n1 ∈ B and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ B and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ B and 5 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of B are also in A ∪ B, B is a subset of A ∪ B.\n\nThus, we have shown that both A and B are subsets of A ∪ B."
