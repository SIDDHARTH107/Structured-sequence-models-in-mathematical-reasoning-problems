    "message_2": "To find the area of a hyperbolic triangle with sides of length a, b, and c in hyperbolic geometry, we can use the hyperbolic version of the Law of Cosines and the Lobachevsky formula.\n\nThe hyperbolic Law of Cosines states that:\n\ncosh(c) = cosh(a) * cosh(b) - sinh(a) * sinh(b) * cos(C)\n\nwhere C is the angle opposite side c.\n\nGiven the sides a = 3, b = 4, and c = 5, we can solve for angle C:\n\ncosh(5) = cosh(3) * cosh(4) - sinh(3) * sinh(4) * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = (cosh(5) - cosh(3) * cosh(4)) / (sinh(3) * sinh(4))\n\nNow, we can use the Lobachevsky formula to find the area of the hyperbolic triangle:\n\nArea = π - (A + B + C)\n\nwhere A and B are the other two angles of the triangle. To find angles A and B, we can use the hyperbolic Law of Cosines again:\n\ncos(A) = (cosh(3) - cosh(4) * cosh(5)) / (sinh(4) * sinh(5))\ncos(B) = (cosh(4) - cosh(3) * cosh(5)) / (sinh(3) * sinh(5))\n\nNow, we can find the angles A, B, and C by taking the inverse cosine of their respective cos values:\n\nA = arccos(cos(A))\nB = arccos(cos(B))\nC = arccos(cos(C))\n\nFinally, we can plug these angles into the Lobachevsky formula to find the area of the hyperbolic triangle:\n\nArea = π - (A + B + C)\n\nNote that the area of a hyperbolic triangle depends on the curvature of the hyperbolic plane, which is not specified in the problem. The formula above assumes a curvature of -1."
