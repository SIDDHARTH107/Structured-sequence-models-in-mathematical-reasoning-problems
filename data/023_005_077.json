    "message_2": "First, let's find the Fourier transform of the given function. We have f(t) = 4 for 0 ≤ t < 2 and f(t) = 0 for t ≥ 2. The function we want to find the Fourier transform of is g(t) = f(t) * e^(-at) * u(t), where u(t) is the Heaviside function and a = 4.\n\nThe Fourier transform of g(t) is given by:\n\nG(ω) = ∫(g(t) * e^(-jωt) dt) from -∞ to ∞\n\nSince f(t) = 0 for t ≥ 2, we only need to consider the integral from 0 to 2:\n\nG(ω) = ∫(4 * e^(-4t) * e^(-jωt) dt) from 0 to 2\n\nNow, combine the exponentials:\n\nG(ω) = 4 * ∫(e^((-4 - jω)t) dt) from 0 to 2\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by substitution:\n\nLet u = -4 - jω, then du = -jω dt\n\nG(ω) = 4 * ∫(e^(ut) * (1/(-jω)) du) from 0 to 2\n\nG(ω) = (4/(-jω)) * ∫(e^(ut) du) from 0 to 2\n\nNow, integrate:\n\nG(ω) = (4/(-jω)) * [e^(ut) / u] from 0 to 2\n\nG(ω) = (4/(-jω)) * [(e^(2u) - e^(0)) / u]\n\nG(ω) = (4/(-jω)) * (1 - e^(2(-4 - jω))) / (-4 - jω)\n\nNow, we can apply the Fourier transform to solve the given differential equation:\n\ny''(t) + 16y(t) = f(t)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides:\n\n(jω)^2 Y(ω) + 16 Y(ω) = G(ω)\n\nNow, solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = G(ω) / ((jω)^2 + 16)\n\nY(ω) = (4/(-jω)) * (1 - e^(2(-4 - jω))) / (-4 - jω) / ((jω)^2 + 16)\n\nTo find the solution y(t), we need to take the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω). However, this inverse Fourier transform is quite complicated and may not have a simple closed-form expression. The inverse Fourier transform can be computed numerically for specific values of t if needed."
