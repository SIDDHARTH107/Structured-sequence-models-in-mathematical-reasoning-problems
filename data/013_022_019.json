    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player A is given $100 to split with Player B. Player A can choose to keep any amount of money for themselves and give the rest to Player B. If Player B accepts the offer, both players keep their respective amounts. If Player B rejects the offer, both players receive nothing. What is the expected outcome for Player A if they choose to keep $70 and offer $30 to Player B?",
    "message_2": "In a Dictator Game, the expected outcome depends on Player B's decision to accept or reject the offer. Since we don't have information about Player B's preferences or likelihood of accepting or rejecting the offer, we cannot determine the exact expected outcome for Player A.\n\nHowever, if Player B accepts the offer, Player A will keep $70, and Player B will receive $30. If Player B rejects the offer, both players will receive nothing."
