    "message_2": "Since f(x) = x^2 is an even function, it cannot be an odd function with a singularity at x=0. However, we can find the Fourier series of f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π] without considering it as an odd function.\n\nThe Fourier series of a function f(x) on the interval [-π, π] is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and n is an integer.\n\nFor an even function, the b_n coefficients are zero. Therefore, we only need to find the a_0 and a_n coefficients.\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nSince f(x) = x^2, we have:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * cos(n * x) dx\n\nNow, we can compute the integrals:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/3) * x^3](-π, π) = (1/π) * [(1/3) * π^3 - (1/3) * (-π)^3] = (2/3) * π^2\n\na_n = (1/π) * [((x^2 * sin(n * x))/n) - (2 * x * cos(n * x))/(n^2) + (2 * sin(n * x))/(n^3)](-π, π)\na_n = (1/π) * [(2 * π * cos(n * π))/(n^2) - (2 * sin(n * π))/(n^3) - (2 * (-π) * cos(n * (-π))/(n^2) + (2 * sin(n * (-π)))/(n^3))]\na_n = (4 * π)/(n^2) * (-1)^n\n\nThus, the Fourier series of f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = (2/3) * π^2 + Σ [(4 * π)/(n^2) * (-1)^n * cos(n * x)]"
