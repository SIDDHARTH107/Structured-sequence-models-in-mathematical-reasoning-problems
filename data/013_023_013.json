    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player A is given 5 tokens and can choose to send any amount (0-5) to Player B. The amount sent is tripled, so if Player A sends 3 tokens, Player B receives 9 tokens. Player B then decides how many tokens (if any) to return to Player A. Whatever amount is returned is doubled, so if Player B returns 2 tokens, Player A receives 4 tokens. If Player A sends 0 tokens, the game ends and both players receive nothing. \n\nIf Player A sends 4 tokens and Player B returns 3 tokens, how many tokens does Player A end up with?",
    "message_2": "If Player A sends 4 tokens, Player B receives 4 * 3 = 12 tokens. If Player B returns 3 tokens, Player A receives 3 * 2 = 6 tokens. Since Player A initially had 5 tokens and sent 4, they have 5 - 4 = 1 token left. Adding the 6 tokens received from Player B, Player A ends up with 1 + 6 = 7 tokens."
