    "message_1": "Consider a factory that produces two types of products: product A and product B. To produce one unit of product A, the factory needs 2 hours of labor and 3 units of raw material. To produce one unit of product B, the factory needs 4 hours of labor and 1 unit of raw material. The factory has 40 hours of labor and 20 units of raw material available. Both products have a profit margin of $10 per unit. How many units of product A and product B should the factory produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and raw materials can be written as:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 40 (labor constraint)\n3x + y ≤ 20 (raw material constraint)\n\nSince the factory cannot produce a negative number of products, we also have:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe profit function to be maximized is:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 10y\n\nTo find the optimal production levels, we will first find the feasible region defined by the constraints and then evaluate the profit function at the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we will find the intersection points of the constraint equations:\n\n1) Intersection of labor and raw material constraints:\n\n2x + 4y = 40\n3x + y = 20\n\nSolve the system of equations:\n\ny = 20 - 3x\n2x + 4(20 - 3x) = 40\n2x + 80 - 12x = 40\n-10x = -40\nx = 4\n\ny = 20 - 3(4) = 8\n\nSo, the intersection point is (4, 8).\n\n2) Intersection of labor constraint with x-axis (y = 0):\n\n2x + 4(0) = 40\nx = 20\n\nSo, the intersection point is (20, 0).\n\n3) Intersection of raw material constraint with y-axis (x = 0):\n\n3(0) + y = 20\ny = 20\n\nSo, the intersection point is (0, 20).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nP(4, 8) = 10(4) + 10(8) = 40 + 80 = $120\nP(20, 0) = 10(20) + 10(0) = 200 + 0 = $200\nP(0, 20) = 10(0) + 10(20) = 0 + 200 = $200\n\nThe maximum profit is $200, which can be achieved by producing either 20 units of product A and 0 units of product B or 0 units of product A and 20 units of product B."
