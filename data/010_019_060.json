    "message_2": "To compute the Morse homology of the level set $f^{-1}(c)$ for $c=1$, we first need to find the critical points of the function $f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2$. The critical points occur when the gradient of the function is zero, i.e., $\\nabla f(x,y) = 0$. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla f(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = (2x, -2y)$.\n\nSetting the gradient to zero, we get the system of equations:\n\n$2x = 0$ and $-2y = 0$.\n\nSolving this system, we find that the only critical point is $(0,0)$. Now we need to find the index of this critical point. The Hessian matrix of $f$ is given by:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -2\n\\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe Hessian matrix has two eigenvalues, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since there is one positive eigenvalue and one negative eigenvalue, the index of the critical point $(0,0)$ is 1.\n\nNow we can compute the Morse homology of the level set $f^{-1}(1)$. Since there is only one critical point with index 1, the Morse homology is given by:\n\n$H_0 = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1 = \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H_k = 0$ for $k \\geq 2$.\n\nThus, the Morse homology of the level set $f^{-1}(1)$ is $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$."
