    "message_2": "First, let's prove that the Morse-Smale complex has exactly $b$ critical cells. Recall that the Morse-Smale complex is a cell complex that is built from the descending manifolds of the critical points of the Morse function $f$. The descending manifold of a critical point $p$ is the set of all points $x \\in M$ such that the negative gradient flow of $f$ starting at $x$ converges to $p$. The Morse-Smale condition states that the descending manifolds of distinct critical points intersect transversely.\n\nNow, let $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_b$ be the critical points of $f$. Since $M$ is compact, there exists a neighborhood $U_i$ of each critical point $p_i$ such that the descending manifold of $p_i$ is a cell of dimension equal to the index of $p_i$ in $U_i$. Moreover, since the descending manifolds intersect transversely, we can choose the neighborhoods $U_i$ to be pairwise disjoint. Then, the Morse-Smale complex is obtained by attaching the descending manifolds of the critical points to the descending manifolds of the other critical points in a way that respects the partial order given by the indices of the critical points.\n\nSince there are $b$ critical points and each descending manifold is a cell, there are exactly $b$ critical cells in the Morse-Smale complex.\n\nNow, let's construct the Morse-Smale complex for the given Morse function $f:M\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with the specified critical points and indices. We have:\n\n- 1 non-degenerate minimum with index 0: This contributes a 0-dimensional cell.\n- 2 non-degenerate saddles with indices 1 and 2: These contribute a 1-dimensional cell and a 2-dimensional cell, respectively.\n- 1 non-degenerate maximum with index 3: This contributes a 3-dimensional cell.\n- 1 degenerate index 1 critical point that is a minimum: This contributes a 1-dimensional cell.\n- 1 degenerate index 2 critical point that is a saddle: This contributes a 2-dimensional cell.\n\nThus, the Morse-Smale complex has a total of 5 critical cells, which is equal to the number of critical points."
