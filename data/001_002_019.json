Write the equation of the line that represents John's distance traveled based on the time spent riding his bike, and use that equation to determine how far he would have traveled if he rode for 60 minutes.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the time spent riding the bike as t (in minutes) and the distance traveled as d (in kilometers). We are given that when t = 30 minutes, d = 10 kilometers.\n\nWe can use the formula for a linear equation: d = mt + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slope (m). Since we know that John traveled 10 kilometers in 30 minutes, we can find the rate at which he traveled:\n\nm = (change in distance) / (change in time) = (10 km - 0 km) / (30 min - 0 min) = 10/30 = 1/3 km/min\n\nNow we can find the y-intercept (b). Since John started at 0 kilometers, the y-intercept is also 0. So, the equation of the line representing John's distance traveled based on the time spent riding his bike is:\n\nd = (1/3)t\n\nNow, we can use this equation to determine how far John would have traveled if he rode for 60 minutes:\n\nd = (1/3)(60) = 20 kilometers\n\nSo, if John rode his bike for 60 minutes, he would have traveled 20 kilometers."
