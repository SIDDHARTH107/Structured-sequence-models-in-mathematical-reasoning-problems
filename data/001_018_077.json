    "message_2": "To simplify the given expression, we will use the logarithmic properties:\n\n1. log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b)\n2. log(a) - log(b) = log(a / b)\n3. n * log(a) = log(a^n)\n\nNow, let's apply these properties to the given expression:\n\nlog(base 2) 16 + log(base 2) 64 - 3 log(base 2) 4\n\nFirst, apply property 3 to the last term:\nlog(base 2) 16 + log(base 2) 64 - log(base 2) 4^3\n\nNow, simplify the exponent:\nlog(base 2) 16 + log(base 2) 64 - log(base 2) 64\n\nNext, apply property 1 to the first two terms:\nlog(base 2) (16 * 64) - log(base 2) 64\n\nNow, simplify the multiplication:\nlog(base 2) 1024 - log(base 2) 64\n\nFinally, apply property 2 to the expression:\nlog(base 2) (1024 / 64)\n\nNow, simplify the division:\nlog(base 2) 16\n\nSo, the simplified expression is log(base 2) 16."
