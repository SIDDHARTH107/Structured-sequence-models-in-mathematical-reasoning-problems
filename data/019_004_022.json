    "message_2": "Using temporal logic, we can represent the given statement using the \"Eventually\" operator (◊) and a time constraint. The formula can be written as:\n\n◊[0,5] (Action completed)\n\nHere, ◊[0,5] denotes that the event inside the parentheses will eventually occur within the time interval [0, 5] seconds. \"Action completed\" represents the completion of the action."
