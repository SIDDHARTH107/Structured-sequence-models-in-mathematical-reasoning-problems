    "message_1": "A mass-spring system is described by the differential equation:\n\nm*y''(t) + b*y'(t) + k*y(t) = F*cos(w*t)\n\nwhere m = 1 kg, b = 0.1 Ns/m, k = 4 N/m, F = 1 N, and w = 2*pi*10 rad/s. The initial displacement is y(0) = 0 and the initial velocity is y'(0) = 0. \n\nUsing the Fourier transform, find the solution to this differential equation for time t between 0 and 5 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. The Fourier transform of a function y(t) is given by:\n\nY(ω) = ∫[y(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit. Taking the Fourier transform of both sides of the given differential equation, we get:\n\nm * Y''(ω) - jωm * Y'(ω) + (k - bωj) * Y(ω) = F * (δ(ω - w) + δ(ω + w))/2\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function. Now, we can solve this equation for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = F * (δ(ω - w) + δ(ω + w)) / (mω^2 - jωb + k)\n\nNow, we can take the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to find the solution y(t) for time t between 0 and 5 seconds:\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[Y(ω) * e^(jωt)] dω\n\ny(t) = (F / 2π) * ∫[((δ(ω - w) + δ(ω + w)) / (mω^2 - jωb + k)) * e^(jωt)] dω\n\nUsing the properties of the Dirac delta function, we can simplify the integral:\n\ny(t) = (F / 2π) * [e^(jwt) / (mw^2 - jwb + k) + e^(-jwt) / (m(-w)^2 + j(-w)b + k)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for m, b, k, F, and w:\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) * [e^(j(2π*10)t) / (1*(2π*10)^2 - j(0.1)(2π*10) + 4) + e^(-j(2π*10)t) / (1*(-2π*10)^2 + j(0.1)(-2π*10) + 4)]\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) * [e^(j(20πt)) / (100π^2 - j(2π) + 4) + e^(-j(20πt)) / (100π^2 + j(2π) + 4)]\n\nThis is the solution to the given differential equation for time t between 0 and 5 seconds."
