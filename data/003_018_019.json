    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 4sin(3x) - cos(2x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. \n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, we have two terms, so we'll find the derivative of each term separately and then combine them.\n\n1) For the first term, 4sin(3x), the outer function is 4sin(u) and the inner function is u = 3x. \n\nThe derivative of the outer function with respect to u is:\nd(4sin(u))/du = 4cos(u)\n\nThe derivative of the inner function with respect to x is:\nd(3x)/dx = 3\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\nd(4sin(3x))/dx = (4cos(u))(3) = 12cos(3x)\n\n2) For the second term, -cos(2x), the outer function is -cos(v) and the inner function is v = 2x.\n\nThe derivative of the outer function with respect to v is:\nd(-cos(v))/dv = sin(v)\n\nThe derivative of the inner function with respect to x is:\nd(2x)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\nd(-cos(2x))/dx = (sin(v))(2) = 2sin(2x)\n\nNow, we can combine the derivatives of both terms:\ndy/dx = 12cos(3x) + 2sin(2x)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the derivative at x = π/4:\ndy/dx(π/4) = 12cos(3(π/4)) + 2sin(2(π/4))\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = 12cos(3π/4) + 2sin(π/2)\n\nUsing the trigonometric values for cos(3π/4) and sin(π/2):\ndy/dx(π/4) = 12(-√2/2) + 2(1)\n\ndy/dx(π/4) = -6√2 + 2\n\nSo, the derivative of y = 4sin(3x) - cos(2x) at x = π/4 is -6√2 + 2."
