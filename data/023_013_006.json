The thermal diffusivity of the material is 0.2 cm²/s. Calculate the temperature at a distance of 4 cm from the hot end after 5 minutes. Use Fourier transform to solve the heat transfer problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Fourier transform, we need to use the heat equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x is the distance along the rod.\n\nWe are given the initial temperature distribution as:\n\nT(x,0) = 100°C for x = 0 cm (hot end)\nT(x,0) = 50°C for x = 10 cm (cold end)\n\nWe want to find the temperature T(4 cm, 5 minutes) using Fourier transform. First, we need to find the Fourier transform of the initial temperature distribution. Let's denote the Fourier transform of T(x,0) as T_hat(k,0), where k is the wavenumber. We can write the initial temperature distribution as a linear function:\n\nT(x,0) = 100 - 5x\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of T(x,0):\n\nT_hat(k,0) = ∫[T(x,0) * e^(-ikx)] dx from 0 to 10\n\nT_hat(k,0) = ∫[(100 - 5x) * e^(-ikx)] dx from 0 to 10\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 100 - 5x, dv = e^(-ikx) dx\ndu = -5 dx, v = (-1/ik) * e^(-ikx)\n\nNow, we can find the integral:\n\nT_hat(k,0) = uv|₀¹⁰ - ∫(-1/ik) * e^(-ikx) * -5 dx from 0 to 10\nT_hat(k,0) = [(100 - 5x) * (-1/ik) * e^(-ikx)]|₀¹⁰ + (5/ik) * ∫e^(-ikx) dx from 0 to 10\n\nNow, we can integrate the remaining term:\n\n(5/ik) * ∫e^(-ikx) dx = (5/ik) * (-1/ik) * e^(-ikx) |₀¹⁰\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the expression for T_hat(k,0):\n\nT_hat(k,0) = [(100 - 5x) * (-1/ik) * e^(-ikx)]|₀¹⁰ + (5/ik²) * [e^(-ikx)]|₀¹⁰\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of T_hat(k,0) to find the temperature distribution T(x,t):\n\nT(x,t) = (1/2π) * ∫[T_hat(k,0) * e^(ikx) * e^(-αk²t)] dk from -∞ to ∞\n\nT(x,t) = (1/2π) * ∫[((100 - 5x) * (-1/ik) * e^(-ikx) + (5/ik²) * [e^(-ikx)]) * e^(ikx) * e^(-αk²t)] dk from -∞ to ∞\n\nWe are interested in finding the temperature at x = 4 cm and t = 5 minutes = 300 seconds:\n\nT(4,300) = (1/2π) * ∫[((100 - 5(4)) * (-1/ik) * e^(-ik(4)) + (5/ik²) * [e^(-ik(4))]) * e^(ik(4)) * e^(-0.2k²(300))] dk from -∞ to ∞\n\nT(4,300) = (1/2π) * ∫[((80) * (-1/ik) + (5/ik²)) * e^(-60k²)] dk from -∞ to ∞\n\nThis integral is quite complex and cannot be solved analytically. However, we can use numerical methods (e.g., Simpson's rule or Gaussian quadrature) to approximate the value of the integral and find the temperature at x = 4 cm and t = 300 seconds."
