    "message_2": "A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. According to Euler's formula for planar graphs, we have:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (including the outer face).\n\nIn this case, we have V = 6 vertices. To find the maximum number of edges (E) in a planar graph with 6 vertices, we can use the fact that each face (except the outer face) must be bounded by at least 3 edges. So, for F faces, there must be at least 3F/2 edges. Combining this with Euler's formula, we get:\n\n6 - E + F = 2\nE ≤ 3F/2\n\nNow, we can solve for F in terms of E:\n\nF = E - 4\n\nSubstituting this back into the inequality, we get:\n\nE ≤ 3(E - 4)/2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n2E ≤ 3E - 12\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nE ≤ 12\n\nSo, the maximum number of edges a planar graph with 6 vertices can have is 12."
