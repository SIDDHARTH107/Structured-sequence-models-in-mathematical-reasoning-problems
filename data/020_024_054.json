Determine the optimal price to sell each unit of the product if the demand function is given by p(x) = 100 - 0.5x dollars and the maximum demand in the market is 80 units. What is the maximum profit that can be earned?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price to sell each unit of the product and the maximum profit that can be earned, we need to find the revenue function R(x) and the profit function P(x).\n\nThe revenue function is given by R(x) = x * p(x), where x is the number of units sold and p(x) is the price per unit.\n\nR(x) = x * (100 - 0.5x)\n\nThe profit function is given by P(x) = R(x) - C(x), where C(x) is the cost function.\n\nP(x) = (x * (100 - 0.5x)) - (500 + 20x + 0.5x^2)\n\nP(x) = 100x - 0.5x^2 - 500 - 20x - 0.5x^2\n\nP(x) = -x^2 + 80x - 500\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. We do this by taking the first derivative of P(x) and setting it equal to 0.\n\nP'(x) = -2x + 80\n\nSetting P'(x) = 0:\n\n-2x + 80 = 0\n\nx = 40\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point corresponds to a maximum or minimum value by taking the second derivative of P(x).\n\nP''(x) = -2\n\nSince P''(x) is negative, the critical point x = 40 corresponds to a maximum value.\n\nNow, we can find the optimal price to sell each unit by plugging x = 40 into the demand function p(x):\n\np(40) = 100 - 0.5(40) = 100 - 20 = 80 dollars\n\nThe optimal price to sell each unit is 80 dollars.\n\nTo find the maximum profit, plug x = 40 into the profit function P(x):\n\nP(40) = -(40)^2 + 80(40) - 500 = -1600 + 3200 - 500 = 1100 dollars\n\nThe maximum profit that can be earned is 1100 dollars."
