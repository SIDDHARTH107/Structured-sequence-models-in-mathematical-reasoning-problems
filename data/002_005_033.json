    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, width of 8 cm, and a height of 6 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism, to the nearest tenth of a centimeter?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal (D) can be found using the formula:\n\nD = √(L² + W² + H²)\n\nwhere L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height of the rectangular prism.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: L = 10 cm, W = 8 cm, and H = 6 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = √(10² + 8² + 6²)\nD = √(100 + 64 + 36)\nD = √200\n\nTo find the length of the diagonal to the nearest tenth of a centimeter, we can approximate the square root of 200:\n\nD ≈ 14.1 cm"
