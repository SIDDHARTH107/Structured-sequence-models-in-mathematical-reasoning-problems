    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula A = 4πr², where A is the surface area and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the radius r = 6 cm. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nA = 4π(6 cm)²\nA = 4π(36 cm²)\nA = 144π cm²\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nA ≈ 144 * 3.14 cm²\nA ≈ 452.16 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere with a radius of 6 cm is approximately 452.16 cm², rounded to two decimal places."
