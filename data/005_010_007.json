    "message_1": "A company produces smartphones, and quality control reports that 5% of phones are defective. A sample of 100 phones is selected for testing. What is the probability that at least 3 phones will be defective, according to Bayesian statistics?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of having exactly k defective phones\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of a phone being defective (0.05)\n- n is the number of phones in the sample (100)\n- k is the number of defective phones\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 3 defective phones, which means we need to find the probability of having 3, 4, 5, ..., 100 defective phones and sum these probabilities. However, it's easier to find the probability of having 0, 1, or 2 defective phones and subtract this from 1.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for 0, 1, and 2 defective phones:\n\nP(X=0) = C(100, 0) * 0.05^0 * (1-0.05)^(100-0) = 1 * 1 * 0.95^100 ≈ 0.006\nP(X=1) = C(100, 1) * 0.05^1 * (1-0.05)^(100-1) = 100 * 0.05 * 0.95^99 ≈ 0.031\nP(X=2) = C(100, 2) * 0.05^2 * (1-0.05)^(100-2) = 4950 * 0.0025 * 0.95^98 ≈ 0.081\n\nNow, let's sum these probabilities and subtract from 1:\n\nP(X≥3) = 1 - (P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2)) = 1 - (0.006 + 0.031 + 0.081) = 1 - 0.118 = 0.882\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 3 defective phones in the sample of 100 is approximately 0.882 or 88.2%."
