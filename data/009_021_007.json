    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution u(x, y, t) can be written as a product of three functions, one depending on x, one depending on y, and one depending on t:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nNow, substitute this into the given PDE:\n\n∂u/∂t = 2∂²u/∂x² + 3∂²u/∂y²\nX(x)Y(y)dT(t)/dt = 2X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + 3X(x)Y''(y)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t):\n\n(1/T(t))dT(t)/dt = 2(1/X(x))X''(x) + 3(1/Y(y))Y''(y)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ:\n\n(1/T(t))dT(t)/dt = -λ\n2(1/X(x))X''(x) + 3(1/Y(y))Y''(y) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve:\n\n1) (1/T(t))dT(t)/dt = -λ\n2) 2(1/X(x))X''(x) + 3(1/Y(y))Y''(y) = -λ\n\nSolving the first ODE:\n\ndT(t)/dt = -λT(t)\nT(t) = A * exp(-λt)\n\nNow, let's rewrite the second ODE as two separate ODEs:\n\n2(1/X(x))X''(x) = λ - 3(1/Y(y))Y''(y)\n\nLet's call the constant on the right side μ:\n\n2(1/X(x))X''(x) = μ\n3(1/Y(y))Y''(y) = λ - μ\n\nNow, we have two more ODEs to solve:\n\n3) X''(x) = (μ/2)X(x)\n4) Y''(y) = ((λ - μ)/3)Y(y)\n\nSolving the third ODE using the boundary conditions u(0,y) = u(π,y) = 0:\n\nX''(x) = (μ/2)X(x)\nX(0) = X(π) = 0\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem with the solution:\n\nX(x) = B * sin(√(2μ)n * x)\nμ = n²π²/2, n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSolving the fourth ODE using the boundary conditions u(x,0) = u(x,π) = 0:\n\nY''(y) = ((λ - μ)/3)Y(y)\nY(0) = Y(π) = 0\n\nThis is another eigenvalue problem with the solution:\n\nY(y) = C * sin(√(3(λ - μ))m * y)\nλ - μ = m²π²/3, m = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as a double sum:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑∑ Aₙₘ * exp(-λₙₘt) * sin(√(2μₙ)n * x) * sin(√(3(λₙₘ - μₙ))m * y)\n\nTo find the coefficients Aₙₘ, we use the initial condition u(x, 0) = sin(x):\n\nsin(x) = ∑∑ Aₙₘ * sin(√(2μₙ)n * x) * sin(√(3(λₙₘ - μₙ))m * y)\n\nSince the initial condition does not depend on y, we can set m = 1 and λ₁ₙ = μₙ + π²/3. Then, we have:\n\nsin(x) = ∑ Aₙ₁ * sin(√(2μₙ)n * x)\n\nTo find the coefficients Aₙ₁, we can use the Fourier sine series:\n\nAₙ₁ = (2/π) ∫₀^π sin(x) * sin(√(2μₙ)n * x) dx\n\nFor n = 1, we have:\n\nA₁₁ = (2/π) ∫₀^π sin(x) * sin(√(2μ₁) * x) dx = 2/π\n\nFor n > 1, we have:\n\nAₙ₁ = 0\n\nSo, the solution to the given PDE with the initial and boundary conditions is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = (2/π) * exp(-(π²/3)t) * sin(x) * sin(√(π²/3) * y)"
