    "message_2": "To determine if S and T are connected subsets of R^2, we need to check if there exists a continuous path between any point in S and any point in T.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the sets S and T. Both sets represent the interior and boundary of circles in the plane R^2. Set S is centered at the origin (0,0) with a radius of 1/2, and set T is centered at the point (1/2, 0) with a radius of 1/2.\n\nNow, let's find the distance between the centers of the two circles. The distance between the points (0,0) and (1/2, 0) is 1/2, which is equal to the sum of the radii of the two circles. This means that the circles are tangent to each other, and they have exactly one point in common.\n\nSince there is a point in common between S and T, we can find a continuous path between any point in S and any point in T by going through this common point. Therefore, S and T are connected subsets of R^2."
