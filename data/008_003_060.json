    "message_2": "To determine the rank of the given matrix, we will perform elementary row operations to bring it to its row-echelon form.\n\nGiven matrix:\n\n```\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n```\n\nStep 1: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row:\n\n```\n1  2  3\n0 -3 -6\n7  8  9\n```\n\nStep 2: Subtract 7 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n1  2  3\n0 -3 -6\n0 -6 -12\n```\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -3:\n\n```\n1  2  3\n0  1  2\n0 -6 -12\n```\n\nStep 4: Add 6 times the second row to the third row:\n\n```\n1  2  3\n0  1  2\n0  0  0\n```\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form:\n\n```\n1  2  3\n0  1  2\n0  0  0\n```\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of non-zero rows in its row-echelon form. In this case, there are 2 non-zero rows, so the rank of the given matrix is 2."
