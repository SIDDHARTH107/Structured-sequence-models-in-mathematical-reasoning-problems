    "message_1": "A jewelry store was robbed and there were 4 suspects: Alex, Ben, Casey, and Dylan. The store owner gave the following statements to the police:\n\n- Alex did not commit the robbery alone.\n- Ben and Dylan know each other very well and are good friends.\n- Either Casey or Dylan committed the robbery.\n\nUsing abductive logic, what is the minimum number of suspects that could have committed the robbery?",
    "message_2": "Using abductive logic, the minimum number of suspects that could have committed the robbery is 2. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Alex did not commit the robbery alone, so if he was involved, at least one other person must have been involved as well.\n2. Either Casey or Dylan committed the robbery, so one of them must be involved.\n3. If Dylan was involved, it's possible that his good friend Ben was involved as well, making it a group of two (Dylan and Ben).\n4. If Casey was involved, since we know Alex couldn't have done it alone, the minimum group would be Casey and Alex, which is also a group of two.\n\nSo, the minimum number of suspects that could have committed the robbery is 2."
