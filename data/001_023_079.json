    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation 2sin(x) + 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2π], follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate sin(x):\n2sin(x) + 1 = 0\n2sin(x) = -1\nsin(x) = -1/2\n\n2. Find the angles x in the interval [0, 2π] that have a sine of -1/2:\nSince the sine function is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, we need to find the reference angle in those quadrants.\n\nThe reference angle for sin(x) = 1/2 is x = π/6 (30°). So, the angles in the third and fourth quadrants with the same reference angle are:\n\nx = π + π/6 = 7π/6\nx = 2π - π/6 = 11π/6\n\n3. Check if the solutions are in the given interval [0, 2π]:\nBoth 7π/6 and 11π/6 are in the interval [0, 2π].\n\nSo, the solutions to the trigonometric equation 2sin(x) + 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2π] are x = 7π/6 and x = 11π/6."
