    "message_1": "A company produces two products, let's say product A and product B, with a profit margin of $5 and $4 per unit respectively. The company has limited resources and the production of each product requires a certain amount of raw materials. The company has 100 units of raw material A and 80 units of raw material B available. Each unit of product A requires 2 units of raw material A and 3 units of raw material B, while each unit of product B requires 4 units of raw material A and 1 unit of raw material B. The company wants to determine the optimal number of units of each product to produce in order to maximize their profit margin, while ensuring that they do not exceed the available raw material. What is the optimal number of units of each product to produce to maximize the profit margin of the company?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 4y, subject to the constraints:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 100 (raw material A constraint)\n3x + y ≤ 80 (raw material B constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 4y ≤ 100 => y ≤ 25 - 0.5x\n2. 3x + y ≤ 80 => y ≤ 80 - 3x\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 25), (20, 20), and (26.67, 0). We will evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 4(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 25) = 5(0) + 4(25) = $100\n3. P(20, 20) = 5(20) + 4(20) = $180\n4. P(26.67, 0) = 5(26.67) + 4(0) ≈ $133.35\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (20, 20), with a profit of $180. Therefore, the company should produce 20 units of product A and 20 units of product B to maximize their profit margin."
