    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 5 over the interval [-2, 5], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2 - 12x + 5)/dx = 6x - 12\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting f'(x) equal to zero:\n\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nSo, there is one critical point at x = 2. Now, we need to check the endpoints of the interval, which are x = -2 and x = 5.\n\nLet's evaluate f(x) at these three points:\n\nf(-2) = 3(-2)^2 - 12(-2) + 5 = 12 + 24 + 5 = 41\nf(2) = 3(2)^2 - 12(2) + 5 = 12 - 24 + 5 = -7\nf(5) = 3(5)^2 - 12(5) + 5 = 75 - 60 + 5 = 20\n\nSo, the maximum value of f(x) over the interval [-2, 5] is 41, which occurs at x = -2, and the minimum value is -7, which occurs at x = 2."
