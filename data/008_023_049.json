    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n|  2   1  -3  |  9.5  |\n|  1  -4   1  | -7.2  |\n|  5   7 -2.5 | 24.3  |\n\nStep 1: Find the pivot in the first column. The pivot is the element with the largest absolute value. In this case, it's 5 (in the third row). So, we swap the first and third rows:\n\n|  5   7  -2.5 | 24.3  |\n|  1  -4   1  | -7.2  |\n|  2   1  -3  |  9.5  |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first column below the pivot. To do this, we perform the following row operations:\n\nR2 = R2 - (1/5)R1\nR3 = R3 - (2/5)R1\n\nThe new augmented matrix becomes:\n\n|  5    7   -2.5 |  24.3  |\n|  0  -5.4  1.5  | -11.86 |\n|  0   -2.4 -2.1 |  -3.86 |\n\nStep 3: Find the pivot in the second column. The pivot is the element with the largest absolute value in the second column below the first row. In this case, it's -5.4 (in the second row). So, we don't need to swap any rows.\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second column below the pivot. To do this, we perform the following row operation:\n\nR3 = R3 - (-2.4/-5.4)R2\n\nThe new augmented matrix becomes:\n\n|  5    7   -2.5 |  24.3   |\n|  0  -5.4  1.5  | -11.86  |\n|  0    0  -0.8  |  -1.6   |\n\nStep 5: Now we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nFrom the third row, we have -0.8z = -1.6, so z = 2.\n\nFrom the second row, we have -5.4y + 1.5(2) = -11.86, so y = 1.\n\nFrom the first row, we have 5x + 7(1) - 2.5(2) = 24.3, so x = 2.\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 2, y = 1, and z = 2."
