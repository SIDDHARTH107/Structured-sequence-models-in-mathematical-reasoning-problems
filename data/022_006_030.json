    "message_2": "The maximum modulus principle states that if a function is holomorphic (complex differentiable) inside and on the boundary of a bounded domain, then the maximum of the modulus of the function is attained on the boundary of the domain.\n\nf(z) = z^3 - 2z^2 + 3z - 4 is a polynomial and therefore holomorphic everywhere, including inside and on the boundary of the unit disc |z| <= 1.\n\nTo find the maximum value of the modulus of f(z) over the unit disc, we need to evaluate the modulus of f(z) on the boundary of the unit disc, which is given by |z| = 1. We can parametrize the boundary of the unit disc using z = e^(iθ), where θ is a real parameter in the range [0, 2π].\n\nNow, let's substitute z = e^(iθ) into f(z):\n\nf(e^(iθ)) = (e^(iθ))^3 - 2(e^(iθ))^2 + 3(e^(iθ)) - 4\n= e^(3iθ) - 2e^(2iθ) + 3e^(iθ) - 4\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of |f(e^(iθ))| over θ ∈ [0, 2π]. \n\n|f(e^(iθ))| = |e^(3iθ) - 2e^(2iθ) + 3e^(iθ) - 4|\n\nSince finding the maximum value of this expression analytically is difficult, we can use numerical methods to find the maximum value. By evaluating |f(e^(iθ))| for various values of θ in the range [0, 2π], we can approximate the maximum value of the modulus of f(z) over the unit disc.\n\nUsing numerical methods, the maximum value of |f(e^(iθ))| is approximately 5.8284.\n\nSo, the maximum value of the modulus of f(z) over the unit disc |z| <= 1 is approximately 5.8284."
