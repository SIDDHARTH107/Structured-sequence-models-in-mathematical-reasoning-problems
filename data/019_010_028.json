    "message_2": "Let's use the following notation:\n\nA = cost of an apple\nO = cost of an orange\n\nWe can set up two linear equations based on the given information:\n\n5A + 10O = $20 (Equation 1)\n2A + 5O = $7 (Equation 2)\n\nTo solve these equations simultaneously, we can multiply Equation 2 by 2 to make the coefficients of A the same in both equations:\n\n4A + 10O = $14 (Equation 2 multiplied by 2)\n\nNow, subtract the new Equation 2 from Equation 1:\n\n(5A + 10O) - (4A + 10O) = $20 - $14\nA = $6\n\nNow that we have the cost of an apple, we can substitute it back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find the cost of an orange. Let's use Equation 2:\n\n2A + 5O = $7\n2($6) + 5O = $7\n$12 + 5O = $7\n5O = $7 - $12\n5O = -$5\nO = -$1\n\nHowever, the cost of an orange cannot be negative. This indicates that there might be an error in the given information or the problem is not based on linear logic. Please double-check the information provided."
