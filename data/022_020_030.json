Find the harmonic conjugate u(x,y) of f(z) and verify that the function g(z) = f(z) + iu(z) satisfies the Laplace equation in the upper half-plane. (Hint: Recall that a complex function is analytic iff it is differentiable, and that the Cauchy-Riemann equations give a necessary and sufficient condition for differentiability.)",
    "message_2": "Let f(z) = z^2 + 1, where z = x + iy (with x and y being real numbers). Then f(z) = (x + iy)^2 + 1 = (x^2 - y^2 + 1) + i(2xy). Let u(x, y) be the harmonic conjugate of f(z). Then the function g(z) = f(z) + iu(z) is analytic in the upper half-plane.\n\nNow, let v(x, y) = 2xy be the imaginary part of f(z). We want to find u(x, y) such that g(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is analytic. To do this, we use the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which are necessary and sufficient conditions for differentiability:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y and ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives of v(x, y):\n\n∂v/∂x = 2y and ∂v/∂y = 2x.\n\nNow we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to find the partial derivatives of u(x, y):\n\n∂u/∂x = 2y and ∂u/∂y = -2x.\n\nNow we need to find u(x, y) by integrating these partial derivatives:\n\n1) Integrate ∂u/∂x = 2y with respect to x:\n\nu(x, y) = 2xy + h(y), where h(y) is an arbitrary function of y.\n\n2) Differentiate u(x, y) = 2xy + h(y) with respect to y:\n\n∂u/∂y = 2x + h'(y).\n\nNow we compare this with the second Cauchy-Riemann equation, ∂u/∂y = -2x:\n\n2x + h'(y) = -2x.\n\nThis implies that h'(y) = -4x. However, this is a contradiction since h'(y) should be a function of y only, not x. The correct approach is to notice that the second Cauchy-Riemann equation is already satisfied by the given u(x, y) = 2xy + h(y):\n\n∂u/∂y = 2x + h'(y) = -2x.\n\nThis implies that h'(y) = -4x, which is a function of x only. Therefore, h(y) must be a constant, say C. So, the harmonic conjugate is:\n\nu(x, y) = 2xy + C.\n\nNow let's verify that g(z) = f(z) + iu(z) satisfies the Laplace equation in the upper half-plane. The Laplace equation states that:\n\n∇²g = ∂²g/∂x² + ∂²g/∂y² = 0.\n\nWe have g(z) = (x^2 - y^2 + 1) + i(2xy + C). Let's compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂²g/∂x² = 2 and ∂²g/∂y² = -2.\n\nThus, ∇²g = 2 - 2 = 0, which means that g(z) satisfies the Laplace equation in the upper half-plane."
