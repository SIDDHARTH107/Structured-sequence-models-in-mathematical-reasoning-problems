    "message_1": "In a certain region, the probability of a tornado occurring in a year is 0.05. What is the probability that at least two tornadoes will occur in the next 5 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability of at least two tornadoes occurring, we will find the probability of either zero or one tornado occurring in the next 5 years, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet P(x) be the probability of x tornadoes occurring in the next 5 years. We will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere n is the number of years (5), x is the number of tornadoes, p is the probability of a tornado occurring in a year (0.05), and C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of zero tornadoes occurring:\n\nP(0) = C(5, 0) * 0.05^0 * (1-0.05)^(5-0)\nP(0) = 1 * 1 * 0.95^5\nP(0) ≈ 0.7738\n\nNext, let's find the probability of one tornado occurring:\n\nP(1) = C(5, 1) * 0.05^1 * (1-0.05)^(5-1)\nP(1) = 5 * 0.05 * 0.95^4\nP(1) ≈ 0.2045\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least 2 tornadoes) = 1 - P(0) - P(1)\nP(at least 2 tornadoes) = 1 - 0.7738 - 0.2045\nP(at least 2 tornadoes) ≈ 0.0217\n\nSo, the probability that at least two tornadoes will occur in the next 5 years is approximately 0.0217 or 2.17%."
