    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. The first few Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, and 127, corresponding to n = 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nTo find the fifth Mersenne prime, we need to find the next prime number for n and calculate 2^n - 1. The next prime number after 7 is 13. So, we have:\n\nM_13 = 2^13 - 1 = 8192 - 1 = 8191\n\nThus, the fifth Mersenne prime number is 8191."
