The temperature is known to be 100°C on the left side of the plate, 50°C on the right side, and 75°C along the top and bottom of the plate.\n\nUsing the finite element method, determine the temperature distribution throughout the plate with dimensions 1 m x 1 m, assuming that the plate is homogeneous and has a thermal conductivity of 50 W/mK. Use a mesh of 10 x 10 for the element grid.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the finite element method, we will first discretize the domain into a 10x10 mesh, with each element having dimensions of 0.1 m x 0.1 m. We will then approximate the temperature distribution within each element using linear basis functions.\n\nLet's denote the temperature at each node as T_i, where i is the node index. The temperature distribution within an element can be approximated as:\n\nT(x, y) = N_1(x, y) * T_1 + N_2(x, y) * T_2 + N_3(x, y) * T_3 + N_4(x, y) * T_4\n\nwhere N_i(x, y) are the linear basis functions for each node.\n\nNow, we will apply the boundary conditions:\n\n- Left side: T(x=0, y) = 100°C\n- Right side: T(x=1, y) = 50°C\n- Top side: T(x, y=1) = 75°C\n- Bottom side: T(x, y=0) = 75°C\n\nNext, we will assemble the global stiffness matrix K and the global force vector F. The stiffness matrix K is obtained by integrating the product of the gradients of the basis functions over the domain. The force vector F is obtained by integrating the product of the basis functions and the heat source over the domain. Since there is no heat source in this problem, the force vector F will be zero.\n\nAfter assembling the global stiffness matrix K and the global force vector F, we can solve the linear system of equations:\n\nK * T = F\n\nwhere T is the vector of nodal temperatures.\n\nFinally, we can obtain the temperature distribution throughout the plate by interpolating the nodal temperatures using the basis functions.\n\nNote that solving this problem requires numerical integration and linear algebra techniques, which are beyond the scope of this text-based platform. However, you can use finite element software like ANSYS, COMSOL, or open-source libraries like FEniCS to solve this problem and obtain the temperature distribution throughout the plate."
