    "message_2": "To find the dimensions of the garden, we need to set up an equation using the given information. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = width Ã— length\n\nIn this case, the width is (x + 3) feet and the length is (x + 5) feet, and the total area is 120 square feet. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n120 = (x + 3)(x + 5)\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n120 = x^2 + 5x + 3x + 15\n120 = x^2 + 8x + 15\n\nTo solve for x, we can set the equation to 0:\n\nx^2 + 8x + 15 - 120 = 0\nx^2 + 8x - 105 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 7)(x + 15) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx - 7 = 0 => x = 7\nx + 15 = 0 => x = -15\n\nSince the dimensions of the garden cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution and use x = 7. Now, we can find the width and length of the garden:\n\nWidth = x + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10 feet\nLength = x + 5 = 7 + 5 = 12 feet\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden are 10 feet by 12 feet."
