    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input signal, we first need to find the frequency response of the system. The frequency response is the transfer function H(s) evaluated at s = jω, where ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the sinusoidal input signal with amplitude 10, frequency 3 Hz, and initial phase angle of 30 degrees, we can represent it as:\n\nx(t) = 10 * sin(2π * 3 * t + 30°)\n\nThe angular frequency ω is:\n\nω = 2π * f = 2π * 3 = 6π rad/s\n\nNow, we evaluate the transfer function H(s) at s = jω:\n\nH(jω) = (5(jω) + 20) / ((jω)^2 + 8(jω) + 15)\n\nH(j6π) = (5(j6π) + 20) / ((j6π)^2 + 8(j6π) + 15)\n\nH(j6π) = (30jπ + 20) / (-36π^2 + 48jπ + 15)\n\nNow, we find the magnitude and phase of H(j6π):\n\n|H(j6π)| = sqrt((Re(H(j6π)))^2 + (Im(H(j6π)))^2) = sqrt(20^2 + (30π)^2)\n\n∠H(j6π) = arctan(Im(H(j6π)) / Re(H(j6π))) = arctan(30π / 20)\n\nThe steady-state response of the system to the sinusoidal input signal is given by:\n\ny(t) = |H(j6π)| * 10 * sin(6π * t + 30° + ∠H(j6π))\n\ny(t) = (10 * sqrt(20^2 + (30π)^2)) * sin(6π * t + 30° + arctan(30π / 20))\n\nThis is the steady-state response of the system to the given sinusoidal input signal."
