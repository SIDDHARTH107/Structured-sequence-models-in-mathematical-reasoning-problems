    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem related to Relevance logic:\n\nIf p = 1 and q = 0, what is the truth value of the formula (p ∧ q) → q in Relevance logic?",
    "message_2": "In Relevance logic, the truth value of a formula depends on the relevance of its components. The formula (p ∧ q) → q can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. p = 1 (True)\n2. q = 0 (False)\n3. p ∧ q (p and q) = 0 (False) since both p and q need to be true for this to be true.\n\nNow, we evaluate the formula (p ∧ q) → q, which is a conditional (if-then) statement. In Relevance logic, a conditional is true if and only if the antecedent (p ∧ q) is relevant to the consequent (q).\n\nIn this case, the antecedent (p ∧ q) is false, and the consequent (q) is also false. Since the antecedent is false, it is not relevant to the consequent. Therefore, the truth value of the formula (p ∧ q) → q in Relevance logic is 0 (False)."
