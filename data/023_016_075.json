Since the function is odd, we only need to consider odd values of n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(2 - 0) / n + (0 + 2) / n] for odd n\n\nb_n = (4/π) * (1/n) for odd n\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of the given function is:\n\nf(x) = Σ[(4/π) * (1/n) * sin(n * x)] for odd n\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity, with n taking only odd values."
