By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, must divide 4 (the index of 5 in the order of G) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility for n_5 is 1, which means there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup, P_5, of order 5. Since P_5 is unique, it is normal in G.\n\nSimilarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 5 (the index of 2 in the order of G) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities for n_2 are 1 and 5. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup, P_2, of order 4. Since P_2 is unique, it is normal in G.\n\nIf both P_2 and P_5 are normal in G, then their product P_2 * P_5 is also normal in G. Since the orders of P_2 and P_5 are relatively prime, the order of their product is 4 * 5 = 20, which is the order of G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_5, which is C4 × C5. Since C4 × C5 is isomorphic to C20, we have found one group of order 20 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group C20.\n\nIf n_2 = 5, there are 5 2-Sylow subgroups of order 4. Let P_2 be one of these subgroups. Since P_5 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of P_2 and P_5. The action of P_2 on P_5 is determined by an automorphism of P_5. Since P_5 is isomorphic to C5, its automorphism group is isomorphic to C4. There are two possibilities for the action of P_2 on P_5: the trivial action and the nontrivial action.\n\nIf the action is trivial, the semidirect product is just the direct product, which we have already considered (C20). If the action is nontrivial, we obtain a non-abelian group of order 20. This group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10, which has order 20 and is non-abelian.\n\nIn summary, there are three groups of order 20 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. The cyclic group C20.\n2. The dihedral group D10.\n3. The non-abelian group of order 20, which is also isomorphic to D10."
