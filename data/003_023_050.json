    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nu x v = ||u|| ||v|| sin(θ) n\n\nwhere ||u|| and ||v|| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, θ is the angle between the vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both u and v.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of u and v:\n\n||u|| = √(3² + 4² + 2²) = √(9 + 16 + 4) = √29\n||v|| = √((-2)² + 1² + 5²) = √(4 + 1 + 25) = √30\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the vectors. To do this, we can use the dot product formula:\n\nu • v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(θ)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for θ:\n\nθ = arccos((u • v) / (||u|| ||v||))\n\nCalculating the dot product of u and v:\n\nu • v = (3)(-2) + (4)(1) + (2)(5) = -6 + 4 + 10 = 8\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(8 / (√29 * √30)) ≈ 0.9784 radians\n\nNow, we need to find the unit vector n perpendicular to both u and v. We can use the cross product formula:\n\nn = (u2v3 - u3v2, u3v1 - u1v3, u1v2 - u2v1)\n\nn = (4 * 5 - 2 * 1, 2 * (-2) - 3 * 5, 3 * 1 - 4 * (-2)) = (18, -19, 11)\n\nNow, we can find the cross product of u and v:\n\nu x v = ||u|| ||v|| sin(θ) n = (√29 * √30 * sin(0.9784)) (18, -19, 11)\n\nu x v ≈ (18, -19, 11)\n\nSo, the cross product of the vectors u and v is approximately (18, -19, 11)."
