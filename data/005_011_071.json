The manufacturer's technician selects 6 different laundry stains and applies a stain to each of 10 identical pieces of fabric. The technician then randomly divides the 60 pieces of fabric into 6 groups of 10 pieces each. The fabric in each group is treated with the new detergent, and the resulting level of stain removal is measured for each piece of fabric. Here are the results:\n\nGroup 1: 85% 80% 90% 75% 85% 80% 90% 75% 85% 80%\n\nGroup 2: 70% 80% 80% 75% 80% 80% 80% 75% 75% 80%\n\nGroup 3: 90% 95% 85% 90% 95% 85% 85% 80% 80% 90%\n\nGroup 4: 95% 90% 95% 80% 90% 90% 80% 85% 95% 85%\n\nGroup 5: 85% 90% 95% 90% 90% 90% 95% 85% 90% 90%\n\nGroup 6: 80% 75% 85% 70% 75% 75% 70% 80% 70% 75%\n\nWhat is the mean stain removal percentage for all 60 pieces of fabric tested?
