    "message_1": "In a classroom, there are 18 students. Each student is allowed to choose up to 4 classmates as their study group partners. What is the maximum number of study groups that can be formed within the classroom if each study group contains exactly 3 students and no student can be in two different study groups?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the number of study groups, we want to divide the students as evenly as possible into groups of 3. \n\nThere are 18 students in the classroom, so we can divide them into groups of 3 as follows:\n\n18 students / 3 students per group = 6 study groups\n\nSo, the maximum number of study groups that can be formed within the classroom is 6."
