    "message_2": "To find the cardinality of set C, we first need to find the union of sets A and B. The union of two sets is the set containing all elements from both sets, without repetition.\n\nSet A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\nSet B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nSet C (union of A and B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nThe cardinality (size) of set C is 10, as there are 10 unique elements in the set."
