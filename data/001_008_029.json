Draw a number line with an open circle at 6 (since x > 6, not x â‰¥ 6).\n2. Shade the region to the right of 6, indicating that all values greater than 6 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph will look like this:\n\n<---(----6----)---->\n\nwhere the open circle represents 6 and the shaded region to the right represents all values greater than 6."
