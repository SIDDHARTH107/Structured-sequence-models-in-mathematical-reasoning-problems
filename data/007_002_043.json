    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 479,321 is divided by 9, we can use the divisibility rule for 9, which states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n\nSo, let's find the sum of the digits of 479,321:\n\n4 + 7 + 9 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 26\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 26 is divided by 9:\n\n26 รท 9 = 2 with a remainder of 8.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 479,321 is divided by 9 is 8."
