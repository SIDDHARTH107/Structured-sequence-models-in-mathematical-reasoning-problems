    "message_1": "An isosceles triangle has a base of 8 cm and two equal sides each measuring 10 cm. What is the length of the altitude drawn from the apex to the base of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the altitude, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. Let's denote the altitude as h, and the base of the triangle as b. Since the triangle is isosceles, the altitude will bisect the base, creating two right triangles with legs of length h and b/2.\n\nIn this case, the base b = 8 cm, and the two equal sides are 10 cm each. So, we have a right triangle with legs of length h and 4 cm (since 8/2 = 4).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n(leg1)^2 + (leg2)^2 = (hypotenuse)^2\n(h)^2 + (4)^2 = (10)^2\n\nSolving for h:\n\nh^2 + 16 = 100\nh^2 = 84\nh = √84\n\nSo, the length of the altitude is √84 cm, which is approximately 9.17 cm."
