    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products of the given sets:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n{1} × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4)}\n{1} × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the Cartesian products:\n\n(A × B) ∪ ({1} × B) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} ∪ {(1, 3), (1, 4)} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\n({1} × A) ∪ (A × B) = {(1, 1), (1, 2)} ∪ {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, the two results are different:\n\n(A × B) ∪ ({1} × B) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n({1} × A) ∪ (A × B) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nSince the results are not the same, this demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union."
