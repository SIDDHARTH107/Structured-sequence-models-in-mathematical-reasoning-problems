    "message_2": "The scaling factor of the Barnsley fern can be found by considering the reduction factors for each recursive iteration. Since the base size of the stem is 1, we can multiply the reduction factors for each iteration to find the overall scaling factor.\n\nScaling factor = Stem × Leaflet 1 × Leaflet 2 × Leaflet 3 × Leaflet 4\nScaling factor = 1 × 0.85 × 0.85 × 0.85 × 0.7 × 0.3\n\nScaling factor ≈ 0.1047\n\nThe scaling factor of the Barnsley fern is approximately 0.1047."
