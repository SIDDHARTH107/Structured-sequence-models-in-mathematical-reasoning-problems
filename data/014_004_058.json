    "message_2": "To find the order of the point P(3,6) on the elliptic curve y² = x³ + 7 over the field F₁₅, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that nP = O, where O is the point at infinity (the identity element for the group law on the elliptic curve).\n\nWe will use the point addition and point doubling formulas for elliptic curves. Let P = (x₁, y₁) and Q = (x₂, y₂) be two points on the elliptic curve. Then:\n\n1. Point doubling (2P = R):\n   x₃ = (3x₁² + a) * (2y₁)⁻¹ mod p\n   y₃ = (2y₁x₁³ - x₁²) * (2y₁)⁻¹ mod p\n\n2. Point addition (P + Q = R):\n   x₃ = (y₂ - y₁) * (x₂ - x₁)⁻¹ mod p\n   y₃ = (y₁(x₂ - x₁) - x₁(y₂ - y₁)) * (x₂ - x₁)⁻¹ mod p\n\nIn our case, the curve equation is y² = x³ + 7 (mod 15), so a = 0 and p = 15.\n\nNow, we will compute multiples of P(3,6) until we reach the point at infinity:\n\n1. 2P:\n   x₃ = (3 * 3²) * (2 * 6)⁻¹ mod 15 = 27 * 12⁻¹ mod 15 = 27 * 13 mod 15 = 6\n   y₃ = (2 * 6 * 3³ - 3²) * (2 * 6)⁻¹ mod 15 = (162 - 9) * 12⁻¹ mod 15 = 153 * 13 mod 15 = 9\n   2P = (6, 9)\n\n2. 3P = P + 2P:\n   x₃ = (9 - 6) * (6 - 3)⁻¹ mod 15 = 3 * 3⁻¹ mod 15 = 3 * 10 mod 15 = 0\n   y₃ = (6 * (6 - 3) - 3 * (9 - 6)) * (6 - 3)⁻¹ mod 15 = (18 - 9) * 3⁻¹ mod 15 = 9 * 10 mod 15 = 0\n   3P = (0, 0)\n\n3. 4P = P + 3P:\n   x₃ = (0 - 6) * (3 - 0)⁻¹ mod 15 = 9 * 3⁻¹ mod 15 = 9 * 10 mod 15 = 6\n   y₃ = (6 * (3 - 0) - 3 * (0 - 6)) * (3 - 0)⁻¹ mod 15 = (18 - 18) * 3⁻¹ mod 15 = 0 * 10 mod 15 = 0\n   4P = (6, 0)\n\n4. 5P = P + 4P:\n   x₃ = (0 - 6) * (6 - 3)⁻¹ mod 15 = 9 * 3⁻¹ mod 15 = 9 * 10 mod 15 = 6\n   y₃ = (6 * (6 - 3) - 3 * (0 - 6)) * (6 - 3)⁻¹ mod 15 = (18 - 18) * 3⁻¹ mod 15 = 0 * 10 mod 15 = 0\n   5P = (6, 0)\n\nWe can see that 5P = 4P, which means that we have reached a cycle in the sequence of multiples of P. Since 3P = (0, 0), the order of the point P(3, 6) on the elliptic curve y² = x³ + 7 over the field F₁₅ is 3."
