    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |      x = | x |      b = | 20 |\n    | 5  4  3 |          | y |          | 17 |\n    | 3  6  2 |          | z |          | 11 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we factor A into the product of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R.\n\nUsing a QR decomposition calculator or software (e.g., MATLAB, Python, etc.), we find:\n\nQ = | -0.2673  0.8729 -0.4082 |\n    | -0.6682 -0.2182 -0.7105 |\n    | -0.4009 -0.4364  0.8046 |\n\nR = | -7.4833 -6.4029 -3.8728 |\n    |  0      -3.8728 -2.9369 |\n    |  0       0       1.6320 |\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Q^T * b, where Q^T is the transpose of matrix Q.\n\nQ^T * b = | -0.2673 -0.6682 -0.4009 | | 20 |\n          |  0.8729 -0.2182 -0.4364 | | 17 |\n          | -0.4082 -0.7105  0.8046 | | 11 |\n\nQ^T * b = | -13.6010 |\n          |   7.8728 |\n          |   5.4082 |\n\nNow, we can solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^T * b using back-substitution:\n\n| -7.4833 -6.4029 -3.8728 | | x |   | -13.6010 |\n|  0      -3.8728 -2.9369 | | y | = |   7.8728 |\n|  0       0       1.6320 | | z |   |   5.4082 |\n\nFrom the last row: 1.6320 * z = 5.4082 => z = 5.4082 / 1.6320 ≈ 3.3125\n\nFrom the second row: -3.8728 * y - 2.9369 * 3.3125 ≈ 7.8728 => y ≈ 1.0000\n\nFrom the first row: -7.4833 * x - 6.4029 * 1.0000 - 3.8728 * 3.3125 ≈ -13.6010 => x ≈ 1.0000\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately x ≈ 1, y ≈ 1, and z ≈ 3.3125."
