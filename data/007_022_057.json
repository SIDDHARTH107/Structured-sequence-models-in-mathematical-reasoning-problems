    "message_2": "To compute the number of points on the curve E(F7), we need to find all the pairs (x, y) in F7 x F7 that satisfy the equation y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 2. We also need to include the point at infinity, which is always on an elliptic curve.\n\nF7 has 7 elements: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. We will test each x value and see if there is a corresponding y value that satisfies the equation.\n\n1. x = 0:\ny^2 = 0^3 + 3*0 + 2 = 2\nThere is no y in F7 such that y^2 = 2.\n\n2. x = 1:\ny^2 = 1^3 + 3*1 + 2 = 6\nThere are two y values in F7 such that y^2 = 6: y = 3 and y = 4.\n\n3. x = 2:\ny^2 = 2^3 + 3*2 + 2 = 16 = 2 (mod 7)\nThere is no y in F7 such that y^2 = 2.\n\n4. x = 3:\ny^2 = 3^3 + 3*3 + 2 = 38 = 3 (mod 7)\nThere is no y in F7 such that y^2 = 3.\n\n5. x = 4:\ny^2 = 4^3 + 3*4 + 2 = 74 = 4 (mod 7)\nThere is no y in F7 such that y^2 = 4.\n\n6. x = 5:\ny^2 = 5^3 + 3*5 + 2 = 140 = 1 (mod 7)\nThere are two y values in F7 such that y^2 = 1: y = 1 and y = 6.\n\n7. x = 6:\ny^2 = 6^3 + 3*6 + 2 = 230 = 0 (mod 7)\nThere are two y values in F7 such that y^2 = 0: y = 0.\n\nSo, we have found 6 points on the curve: (1, 3), (1, 4), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), and the point at infinity.\n\nTherefore, the number of points on the curve E(F7) is 7."
