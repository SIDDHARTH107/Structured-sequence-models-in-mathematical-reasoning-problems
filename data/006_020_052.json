    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on a single trial (day)\n- n is the number of trials (days)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days) we want\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 6 (next 6 days)\n- k = 3 (we want exactly 3 rainy days)\n- p = 0.25 (probability of rain on any given day)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(6, 3), which is the number of ways to choose 3 rainy days out of 6 days:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!)\n         = 6! / (3! * 3!)\n         = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1))\n         = (6 * 5 * 4) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n         = 20\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=3) = C(6, 3) * p^3 * (1-p)^(6-3)\n       = 20 * (0.25)^3 * (1-0.25)^(6-3)\n       = 20 * (0.25)^3 * (0.75)^3\n       = 20 * 0.015625 * 0.421875\n       = 0.1318359375\n\nSo, the probability that it rains on exactly 3 out of the next 6 days is approximately 0.1318 or 13.18%."
