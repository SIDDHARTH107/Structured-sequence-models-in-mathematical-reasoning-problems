Using regression analysis, the student wants to find the equation of the line of best fit for the data. The following data was collected:\n\nHours Studied (x)    Score (y)\n3                                   70\n5                                   62\n7                                   75\n9                                   82\n10                                 93\n15                                 88\n18                                97\n20                                94\n21                                98\n25                                92\n\nWhat is the equation of the line of best fit for this data?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line of best fit, we will use the least squares method. First, we need to find the mean of the x values (hours studied) and the mean of the y values (scores).\n\nMean of x values (x̄) = (3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 15 + 18 + 20 + 21 + 25) / 10 = 133 / 10 = 13.3\nMean of y values (ȳ) = (70 + 62 + 75 + 82 + 93 + 88 + 97 + 94 + 98 + 92) / 10 = 851 / 10 = 85.1\n\nNext, we need to find the slope (m) of the line of best fit using the formula:\n\nm = Σ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] / Σ(x - x̄)^2\n\nCalculating the numerator and denominator:\n\nΣ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] = (3-13.3)(70-85.1) + (5-13.3)(62-85.1) + ... + (25-13.3)(92-85.1) = 506.9\n\nΣ(x - x̄)^2 = (3-13.3)^2 + (5-13.3)^2 + ... + (25-13.3)^2 = 716.1\n\nNow, we can find the slope:\n\nm = 506.9 / 716.1 ≈ 0.708\n\nFinally, we need to find the y-intercept (b) using the formula:\n\nb = ȳ - m * x̄\n\nb = 85.1 - 0.708 * 13.3 ≈ 75.4\n\nSo, the equation of the line of best fit is:\n\ny = 0.708x + 75.4"
