    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we'll use the product rule. The product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. In this case, our two functions are u(x) = sin(3x) and v(x) = cos(5x).\n\nFirst, we'll find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x) with respect to x:\n\nu'(x) = d(sin(3x))/dx = 3cos(3x) (using the chain rule)\nv'(x) = d(cos(5x))/dx = -5sin(5x) (using the chain rule)\n\nNow, we'll apply the product rule:\n\ny'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\ny'(x) = (3cos(3x))(cos(5x)) + (sin(3x))(-5sin(5x))\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x is:\n\ny'(x) = 3cos(3x)cos(5x) - 5sin(3x)sin(5x)"
