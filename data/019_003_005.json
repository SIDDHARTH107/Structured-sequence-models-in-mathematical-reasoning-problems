    "message_2": "If the modal operator □ (necessarily) holds for a proposition p in a model M, then p is true in all accessible worlds from the current world in M. We can prove this by using the definition of the modal operator □ and the semantics of modal logic.\n\nProof:\n\nLet M = (W, R, V) be a model of modal logic, where W is a set of possible worlds, R is an accessibility relation on W, and V is a valuation function that assigns truth values to propositions in each world.\n\nLet w be a world in W, and let p be a proposition such that M, w ⊨ □p (i.e., □p is true in world w in model M).\n\nBy the definition of the modal operator □, M, w ⊨ □p if and only if for all worlds w' in W, if wRw' (i.e., w' is accessible from w), then M, w' ⊨ p (i.e., p is true in world w').\n\nNow, we want to show that p is true in all accessible worlds from w.\n\nLet w' be an arbitrary world in W such that wRw' (i.e., w' is accessible from w).\n\nBy the definition of □, since M, w ⊨ □p, we know that M, w' ⊨ p (i.e., p is true in world w').\n\nSince w' was an arbitrary accessible world from w, we can conclude that p is true in all accessible worlds from w in model M.\n\nHence, if the modal operator □ (necessarily) holds for a proposition p in a model M, then p is true in all accessible worlds from the current world in M."
