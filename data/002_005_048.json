    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 7 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the length (l), width (w), and height (h) of the prism:\n\nd^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we have:\n\nd^2 = (7 cm)^2 + (4 cm)^2 + (3 cm)^2\nd^2 = 49 cm^2 + 16 cm^2 + 9 cm^2\nd^2 = 74 cm^2\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the diagonal:\n\nd = √(74 cm^2)\nd ≈ 8.6 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 8.6 cm."
