    "message_2": "To disconnect an undirected graph, we need to ensure that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we need to create at least two separate connected components.\n\nA tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and it has exactly n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. In our case, with 7 vertices, a tree would have 6 edges. To create a disconnected graph, we can aim to create two separate trees.\n\nLet's consider the smallest tree with 2 vertices and 1 edge. The remaining 5 vertices can form another tree with 4 edges (5-1=4). In this case, we have a total of 1+4=5 edges.\n\nNow, our original graph has 8 edges. To reach the minimum number of edges for our disconnected graph (5 edges), we need to remove 8-5=3 edges.\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph is 3."
