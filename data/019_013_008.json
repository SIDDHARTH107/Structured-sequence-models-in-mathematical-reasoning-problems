    "message_1": "Let S be a set such that the number of elements in S is odd. Suppose that there exists a function f:S→S such that f(f(x))=x for all x∈S. Prove that there must exist an element x∈S such that f(x)=x. \n\nFor example, if S has 11 elements, prove that such an x must exist for any possible function f.",
    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use proof by contradiction. Let's assume that there is no element x in S such that f(x) = x.\n\nNow, let's consider the pairs (x, f(x)) for all x in S. Since f(f(x)) = x, we know that f(x) is the unique inverse of x under the function f. If f(x) = x for some x, then we would have a fixed point, which contradicts our assumption. So, for every x in S, f(x) ≠ x.\n\nNow, let's count the number of pairs (x, f(x)). Since f(x) ≠ x for all x in S, and f(f(x)) = x, each pair (x, f(x)) corresponds to a unique pair (f(x), x). This means that the pairs can be grouped into sets of two, where each set contains a pair (x, f(x)) and its corresponding pair (f(x), x).\n\nSince the number of elements in S is odd, the total number of pairs (x, f(x)) is also odd. However, we just showed that these pairs can be grouped into sets of two, which implies that the total number of pairs should be even. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that there is no element x in S such that f(x) = x must be false. So, there must exist an element x in S such that f(x) = x."
