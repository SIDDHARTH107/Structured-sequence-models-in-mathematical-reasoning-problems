    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 7, we will first find the derivative with respect to x, and then evaluate it at the point x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2 + 4x - 7)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule and sum rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 4\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at the point x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) + 4\nf'(2) = 12 + 4\nf'(2) = 16\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 7 at the point x = 2 is 16."
