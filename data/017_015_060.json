    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the possibilities for the group G of order 24.\n\n1. Cyclic group C24: If G is isomorphic to C24, then it has a single element of order 24, and it is an abelian group.\n\n2. Alternating group A5: A5 has order 5! / 2 = 60, so G cannot be isomorphic to A5.\n\n3. Non-abelian groups of order 24: There are five non-abelian groups of order 24, which are S4 (symmetric group on 4 elements), D12 (dihedral group of order 12), and three other groups that can be represented as a semidirect product of Z4 and Z6, Z2 and Z12, or Z3 and Z8.\n\nNow, let's use Sylow's Theorems to analyze the possibilities for G:\n\nSince |G| = 24 = 2^3 * 3, by Sylow's First Theorem, G has Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 and Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3.\n\nBy Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. If G is isomorphic to C24, then n_2 = n_3 = 1, which means there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, G is abelian.\n\n2. If G is one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24, then G is not abelian. We can eliminate the possibility of G being isomorphic to A5 since its order is not 24. For the other four non-abelian groups, we can analyze their Sylow subgroups:\n\n- S4 has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups.\n- D12 has three Sylow 2-subgroups and two Sylow 3-subgroups.\n- The semidirect product of Z4 and Z6 has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups.\n- The semidirect product of Z2 and Z12 has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups.\n- The semidirect product of Z3 and Z8 has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nIn conclusion, without further information about the group G, we cannot determine if it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C24 or one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24. However, we can conclude that G is not isomorphic to the alternating group A5."
