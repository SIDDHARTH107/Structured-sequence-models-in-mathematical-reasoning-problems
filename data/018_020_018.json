The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {2, 3} (intersection of A and B)\n\nNow, subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, we need to find the union of the symmetric difference and the set {3, 4}:\n\n(A △ B) ∪ {3, 4} = {1, 4} ∪ {3, 4} = {1, 3, 4}\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n(A △ B) ∪ {3, 4} = {1, 3, 4}."
