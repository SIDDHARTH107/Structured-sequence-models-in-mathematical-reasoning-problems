    "message_2": "To show that the square with sides of length 2 units can be subdivided into four smaller squares, each with sides of length 1 unit, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a square with sides of length 2 units.\n2. Divide the square into four equal parts by drawing two lines: one vertical line and one horizontal line. The vertical line should pass through the midpoint of the top and bottom sides, and the horizontal line should pass through the midpoint of the left and right sides.\n3. Observe the resulting four smaller squares. Each of these squares has sides of length 1 unit, as they are half the length of the original square's sides (2 units / 2 = 1 unit).\n\nBy following these steps, we have shown that the square with sides of length 2 units can indeed be subdivided into four smaller squares, each with sides of length 1 unit."
