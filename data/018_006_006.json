    "message_1": "Let A be a set with 25 elements out of a universal set U containing 35 elements. Find the number of elements in the union of A and its complement.",
    "message_2": "The complement of set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. Since there are 35 elements in the universal set U and 25 elements in set A, there must be 35 - 25 = 10 elements in the complement of A (A').\n\nThe union of A and its complement A' (denoted as A âˆª A') contains all the elements in A and all the elements in A'. Since A and A' are complementary sets, their union covers the entire universal set U.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements in the union of A and its complement A' is equal to the number of elements in the universal set U, which is 35 elements."
