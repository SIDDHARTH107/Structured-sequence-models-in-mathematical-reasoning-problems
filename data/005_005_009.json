    "message_2": "To find the probability of a passenger waiting less than 9 minutes, we first need to find the probability density function (pdf) of the uniform distribution. Since the waiting time is uniformly distributed from 5 to 15 minutes, the pdf is given by:\n\nf(x) = 1 / (b - a) for a ≤ x ≤ b\n\nwhere a = 5 and b = 15.\n\nf(x) = 1 / (15 - 5) = 1 / 10\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of waiting less than 9 minutes, which means we need to find the area under the pdf curve from 5 to 9:\n\nP(X < 9) = ∫(1/10) dx from 5 to 9\n\nTo find the integral, we can use the antiderivative of the pdf:\n\n∫(1/10) dx = (1/10)x + C\n\nNow, we can find the area under the curve by evaluating the antiderivative at the limits:\n\nP(X < 9) = [(1/10)(9) - (1/10)(5)]\n\nP(X < 9) = [9/10 - 5/10]\n\nP(X < 9) = 4/10\n\nP(X < 9) = 2/5\n\nSo, the probability of a passenger waiting less than 9 minutes is 2/5 or 0.4."
