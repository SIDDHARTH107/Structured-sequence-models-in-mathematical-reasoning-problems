    "message_2": "A pole of a meromorphic function is a point where the function becomes infinite. To find the poles of f(z), we need to find the zeros of the denominator, since the function will be infinite when the denominator is equal to zero.\n\nThe denominator of f(z) is z^2 + 2z + 1. To find its zeros, we can try to factor it or use the quadratic formula. In this case, we can factor it as (z + 1)^2. So, the zeros of the denominator are:\n\nz + 1 = 0\nz = -1\n\nSince there is only one distinct zero, there is only one pole at z = -1.\n\nNow, we need to find the order of the pole. The order of a pole is the number of times the zero appears in the denominator. In this case, the zero z = -1 appears twice in the denominator (since the denominator is (z + 1)^2), so the order of the pole is 2.\n\nThus, f(z) has a pole of order 2 at z = -1 in the finite complex plane."
