    "message_2": "We will use Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum weight spanning tree of the given graph. First, we list all the edges in the graph in ascending order of their weights:\n\n1. (C, F) with weight 1\n2. (A, C) with weight 2\n3. (A, B) with weight 3\n4. (D, F) with weight 4\n5. (B, D) with weight 5\n6. (D, E) with weight 7\n\nNow, we will add the edges to the minimum weight spanning tree one by one, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle.\n\n1. Add edge (C, F) with weight 1.\n2. Add edge (A, C) with weight 2.\n3. Add edge (A, B) with weight 3.\n4. Add edge (D, F) with weight 4. Adding this edge does not form a cycle.\n5. Skip edge (B, D) with weight 5, as adding this edge would form a cycle (A-B-D-F-A).\n6. Add edge (D, E) with weight 7.\n\nThe minimum weight spanning tree is now complete, and its edges are:\n\n1. (C, F) with weight 1\n2. (A, C) with weight 2\n3. (A, B) with weight 3\n4. (D, F) with weight 4\n5. (D, E) with weight 7\n\nThe total weight of the minimum weight spanning tree is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 17."
