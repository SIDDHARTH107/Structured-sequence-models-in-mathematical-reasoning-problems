    "message_2": "To find the shortest path on the curve from point $(2, 4)$ to point $(-2, 4)$, we can use the arc length formula. The arc length of a curve given by the equation $y = f(x)$ between two points $x = a$ and $x = b$ is given by:\n\n$$L = \\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{1 + (f'(x))^2} dx$$\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function $f(x) = x^2$. Using the power rule, we get:\n\n$$f'(x) = 2x$$\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\n$$L = \\int_{-2}^{2} \\sqrt{1 + (2x)^2} dx$$\n\n$$L = \\int_{-2}^{2} \\sqrt{1 + 4x^2} dx$$\n\nThis integral is not elementary, meaning it cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. However, we can find its numerical value using a calculator or computer software. Using a numerical integration method, we get:\n\n$$L \\approx 7.416$$\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path on the curve from the point $(2, 4)$ to the point $(-2, 4)$ is approximately $7.416$."
