    "message_2": "The proposition ∀x(P(x) → ¬(x is divisible by 5)) states that for all x, if x is an odd number greater than 5, then x is not divisible by 5.\n\nLet's analyze this proposition. If x is an odd number greater than 5, it means that x cannot be divisible by 2 (since it's odd) and it must be greater than 5. Now, let's consider the divisibility by 5. If x is odd, it cannot be divisible by 5 because the product of any odd number and 5 would be an odd number, and all multiples of 5 are either odd or even (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.).\n\nTherefore, if x is an odd number greater than 5, it cannot be divisible by 5. So, the proposition ∀x(P(x) → ¬(x is divisible by 5)) is true."
