    "message_2": "To show that the point (0,0,0) is a singular point of X, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the polynomials generating the ideal I with respect to the variables x, y, and z, and then evaluate them at the point (0,0,0). If all the partial derivatives are zero at this point, then (0,0,0) is a singular point of X.\n\nLet $f_1(x,y,z) = x^2 - y^3$, $f_2(x,y,z) = xy - z^2$, and $f_3(x,y,z) = x^3 - y^2z$. We compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} = 2x$, $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} = -3y^2$, $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial z} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} = y$, $\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} = x$, $\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial z} = -2z$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x} = 3x^2$, $\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial y} = -2yz$, $\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial z} = y^2 - x^3$\n\nNow we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (0,0,0):\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x}(0,0,0) = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y}(0,0,0) = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial z}(0,0,0) = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x}(0,0,0) = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y}(0,0,0) = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial z}(0,0,0) = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x}(0,0,0) = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial y}(0,0,0) = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial z}(0,0,0) = 0$\n\nSince all the partial derivatives are zero at the point (0,0,0), this point is a singular point of the algebraic variety X."
