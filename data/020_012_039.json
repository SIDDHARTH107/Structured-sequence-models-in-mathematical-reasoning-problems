    "message_1": "A factory produces two products A and B. Each unit of product A requires 3 hours of processing time and 4 hours of assembly time. Each unit of product B requires 4 hours of processing time and 5 hours of assembly time. The factory has 400 hours of processing time and 500 hours of assembly time available each week. If the profit of each unit of product A is $30 and the profit of each unit of product B is $40, how many units of each product should the factory produce each week to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for the processing and assembly times are as follows:\n\nProcessing time: 3x + 4y ≤ 400\nAssembly time: 4x + 5y ≤ 500\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 30x + 40y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and then find the vertices of the feasible region. Finally, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\n1. Solve the constraints for y:\n\nProcessing time: y ≤ (400 - 3x) / 4\nAssembly time: y ≤ (500 - 4x) / 5\n\n2. Graph the constraints and find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. The vertices are (0, 0), (0, 100), (100, 0), and (40, 80).\n\n3. Evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nProfit at (0, 0) = 30(0) + 40(0) = $0\nProfit at (0, 100) = 30(0) + 40(100) = $4000\nProfit at (100, 0) = 30(100) + 40(0) = $3000\nProfit at (40, 80) = 30(40) + 40(80) = $4400\n\nThe maximum profit of $4400 is achieved when the factory produces 40 units of product A and 80 units of product B each week."
