    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n| 1  1  1 |  6 |\n| 2 -1  3 | 10 |\n| 3 -2  4 | 14 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\nR2 = R2 - 2*R1\nR3 = R3 - 3*R1\n\n| 1  1   1 |  6  |\n| 0 -3   1 | -2  |\n| 0 -5   1 | -4  |\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -3 to make the leading coefficient of y equal to 1.\nR2 = R2 / -3\n\n| 1  1   1 |  6  |\n| 0  1  -1/3 |  2/3 |\n| 0 -5   1 | -4  |\n\nStep 3: Eliminate y from the third row.\nR3 = R3 + 5*R2\n\n| 1  1   1  |  6   |\n| 0  1  -1/3 |  2/3 |\n| 0  0   1/3 |  2/3 |\n\nStep 4: Back-substitute to find the values of x, y, and z.\nz = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2\ny = 2/3 + (1/3)*z = 2/3 + 2/3 = 4/3 + 4/3 = 2\nx = 6 - y - z = 6 - 2 - 2 = 2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 2, and z = 2."
