    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1 over the interval [-2, 3], we need to find the critical points and endpoints of the function.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0:\n\n3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can either factor it or use the quadratic formula. In this case, we can factor it:\n\n3(x^2 - 2x) + 2 = 0\n3(x - 1)(x - 2/3) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 2/3.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^3 - 3(-2)^2 + 2(-2) + 1 = -8 - 12 - 4 + 1 = -23\nf(2/3) = (2/3)^3 - 3(2/3)^2 + 2(2/3) + 1 â‰ˆ -0.037\nf(1) = 1^3 - 3(1)^2 + 2(1) + 1 = 1 - 3 + 2 + 1 = 1\nf(3) = 3^3 - 3(3)^2 + 2(3) + 1 = 27 - 27 + 6 + 1 = 7\n\nComparing the values of the function at these points, we find that the maximum value is 7 at x = 3, and the minimum value is -23 at x = -2."
