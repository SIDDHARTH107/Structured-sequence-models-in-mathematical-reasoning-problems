    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one system will fail, we can first find the probability that none of the systems fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a single system not failing is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the systems are independent, the probability that all 20 systems do not fail is (0.95)^20 ≈ 0.3585.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one system fails by subtracting the probability that none of them fail from 1:\n\n1 - 0.3585 ≈ 0.6415.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one system will fail is approximately 0.6415 or 64.15%."
