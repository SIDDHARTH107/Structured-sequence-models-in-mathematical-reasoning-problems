The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order n is congruent to 1 mod p and divides n.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of 40: 40 = 2^3 * 5^1.\n\nNow, we consider the Sylow subgroups for each prime factor:\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups (order 8), we have the following possibilities:\n1. There is one 2-Sylow subgroup, which must be normal.\n2. There are five 2-Sylow subgroups.\n\nFor the 5-Sylow subgroups (order 5), there is only one possibility:\n1. There is one 5-Sylow subgroup, which must be normal.\n\nNow, we analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\nCase 1: One 2-Sylow subgroup and one 5-Sylow subgroup (both normal)\nIn this case, the group is a direct product of the Sylow subgroups, so G ≅ C_8 × C_5. Since C_8 has two possible structures (C_8 and C_4 × C_2), we have two possible groups in this case: C_8 × C_5 and (C_4 × C_2) × C_5.\n\nCase 2: Five 2-Sylow subgroups and one 5-Sylow subgroup (5-Sylow is normal)\nIn this case, the group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow subgroups. Since the 5-Sylow subgroup is normal, we have G ≅ (C_8 ⋊ C_5) or (C_4 × C_2 ⋊ C_5). However, there is only one non-trivial homomorphism from C_5 to Aut(C_8) (which has order 4), so we have only one group in this case: C_8 ⋊ C_5.\n\nIn total, we have found 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 40: C_8 × C_5, (C_4 × C_2) × C_5, and C_8 ⋊ C_5."
