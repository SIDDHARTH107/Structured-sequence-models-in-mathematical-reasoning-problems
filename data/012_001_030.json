Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance to the starting node (A) as 0 and the distance to all other nodes as infinity.\n\n   Unvisited nodes: {A, B, C, D}\n   Distance: A = 0, B = ∞, C = ∞, D = ∞\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (A) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (B and D).\n\n   Visited nodes: {A}\n   Unvisited nodes: {B, C, D}\n   Distance: A = 0, B = 4, C = ∞, D = 12\n\n3. Select the node with the smallest distance among the unvisited nodes (B) and mark it as visited.

Select the node with the smallest distance among the unvisited nodes (C) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (D).\n\n   Visited nodes: {A, B, C}\n   Unvisited nodes: {D}\n   Distance: A = 0, B = 4, C = 11, D = 12 (no update, since 11 + 9 > 12)\n\n5.
