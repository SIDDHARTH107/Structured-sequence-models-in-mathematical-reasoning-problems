    "message_1": "Consider the wave equation: \n\n∂²u/∂t² - c²∂²u/∂x² = 0\n\nwhere u(x,t) represents the displacement of a wave, c represents the speed of the wave and x and t are spatial and temporal variables, respectively. \n\nSuppose you have a wave described by the function u(x,t) = 2cos(5x)sin(2t) with speed c = 2. \n\nDetermine the wavelength, frequency and period of this wave.",
    "message_2": "To determine the wavelength, frequency, and period of the wave, we first need to identify the wave number (k) and angular frequency (ω) from the given wave function u(x,t) = 2cos(5x)sin(2t).\n\nThe general form of a wave function is:\n\nu(x,t) = A*cos(kx - ωt) or u(x,t) = A*cos(kx + ωt)\n\nComparing this with the given wave function, we can identify the wave number and angular frequency as:\n\nk = 5\nω = 2\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength (λ), frequency (f), and period (T) using the following relationships:\n\nWavelength (λ) = 2π/k\nFrequency (f) = ω/2π\nPeriod (T) = 1/f\n\nCalculating these values:\n\nWavelength (λ) = 2π/5 ≈ 1.2566 units\nFrequency (f) = 2/2π ≈ 0.3183 Hz\nPeriod (T) = 1/f ≈ 3.1416 seconds\n\nSo, the wavelength of the wave is approximately 1.2566 units, the frequency is approximately 0.3183 Hz, and the period is approximately 3.1416 seconds."
