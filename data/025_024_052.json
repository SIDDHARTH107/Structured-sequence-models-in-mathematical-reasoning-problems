    "message_1": "Suppose that you have a set of points in a two-dimensional space given by {(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 10)}. Consider the action of the group G = {id, σ, τ, στ}, where id is the identity, σ is the reflection along the x-axis, τ is the reflection along the y-axis, and στ is the 180-degree rotation around the origin. Determine the invariant polynomials under the action of G for this set of points.",
    "message_2": "To find the invariant polynomials under the action of G, we need to find polynomials that remain unchanged when the group elements are applied to the set of points. Let's first find the action of each group element on the set of points:\n\n1. id (identity): The points remain unchanged.\n   {(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 10)}\n\n2. σ (reflection along the x-axis): The y-coordinates change sign.\n   {(1, -2), (3, -4), (5, -6), (7, -8), (9, -10)}\n\n3. τ (reflection along the y-axis): The x-coordinates change sign.\n   {(-1, 2), (-3, 4), (-5, 6), (-7, 8), (-9, 10)}\n\n4. στ (180-degree rotation around the origin): Both x and y coordinates change sign.\n   {(-1, -2), (-3, -4), (-5, -6), (-7, -8), (-9, -10)}\n\nNow, let's find the invariant polynomials. We are looking for a polynomial P(x, y) such that P(x, y) = P(σ(x, y)) = P(τ(x, y)) = P(στ(x, y)) for all points (x, y) in the set.\n\nOne such invariant polynomial is the sum of squares of the coordinates:\n\nP(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\n\nLet's check if this polynomial is invariant under the action of G:\n\n1. id: P(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\n2. σ: P(x, -y) = x^2 + (-y)^2 = x^2 + y^2\n3. τ: P(-x, y) = (-x)^2 + y^2 = x^2 + y^2\n4. στ: P(-x, -y) = (-x)^2 + (-y)^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nSince P(x, y) remains unchanged under the action of all group elements, it is an invariant polynomial under the action of G.\n\nIn conclusion, the invariant polynomial under the action of G for the given set of points is P(x, y) = x^2 + y^2."
