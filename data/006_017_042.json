    "message_1": "A city has 20,000 cars that travel on a specific road during peak traffic hours. Based on past data, it is known that the probability of a car accident occurring on this road during peak traffic hours is 0.5%. Find the expected number of accidents that would occur during peak traffic hours on this road.",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of accidents during peak traffic hours, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected number of accidents = Total number of cars * Probability of an accident\n\nIn this case, there are 20,000 cars and the probability of an accident is 0.5% (or 0.005 as a decimal).\n\nExpected number of accidents = 20,000 * 0.005 = 100\n\nSo, we can expect 100 accidents to occur during peak traffic hours on this road."
