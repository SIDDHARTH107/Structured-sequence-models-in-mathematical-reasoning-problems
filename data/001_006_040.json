    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of a quadratic equation, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x. So, we have:\n\n0 = x^2 + 6x - 27\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = 6, and c = -27. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nx = (-6 ± √(6^2 - 4 * 1 * -27)) / 2 * 1\nx = (-6 ± √(36 + 108)) / 2\nx = (-6 ± √144) / 2\nx = (-6 ± 12) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (-6 + 12) / 2\nx = 6 / 2\nx = 3\n\nand\n\nx = (-6 - 12) / 2\nx = -18 / 2\nx = -9\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation y = x^2 + 6x - 27 are x = 3 and x = -9."
