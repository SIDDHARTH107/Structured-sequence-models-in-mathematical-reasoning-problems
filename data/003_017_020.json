    "message_2": "Yes, I can help. To find the average value of the sine function between 0 and π, we need to integrate the sine function over the given interval and then divide by the length of the interval.\n\nThe average value formula is:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[f(x) dx] from a to b\n\nIn this case, a = 0, b = π, and f(x) = sin(x).\n\nAverage value = (1/(π-0)) * ∫[sin(x) dx] from 0 to π\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of sin(x) from 0 to π:\n\n∫[sin(x) dx] = -cos(x) + C\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n[-cos(π) + C] - [-cos(0) + C] = -cos(π) + cos(0) = -(-1) + 1 = 2\n\nNow, we'll plug this back into the average value formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/π) * 2 = 2/π\n\nSo, the average value of the sine function between 0 and π is 2/π."
