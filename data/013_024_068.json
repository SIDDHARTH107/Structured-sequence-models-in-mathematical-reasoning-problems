    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to Volunteer's Dilemma in Game Theory for a math student to solve:\n\nIn a group of 5 volunteers, each person has the option to either \"volunteer\" or \"not volunteer\" for a community service project. If at least 3 volunteers sign up, the project will move forward and everyone will receive a reward of 30 points. However, if less than 3 people volunteer, nobody gets any points. Each person has a 50% chance of volunteering, and their decisions are kept private until everyone has made their choice. What is the probability that the project will move forward and all volunteers will receive their reward?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of having exactly x volunteers, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of choosing x volunteers from n people, p is the probability of an individual volunteering, and n is the total number of people in the group.\n\nIn this case, n = 5, p = 0.5, and we want to find the probability of having at least 3 volunteers, which means x = 3, 4, or 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of having exactly 3 volunteers:\n\nP(3) = C(5, 3) * (0.5)^3 * (1-0.5)^(5-3)\nP(3) = 10 * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^2\nP(3) = 10 * 0.125 * 0.25\nP(3) = 0.3125\n\nNow, let's find the probability of having exactly 4 volunteers:\n\nP(4) = C(5, 4) * (0.5)^4 * (1-0.5)^(5-4)\nP(4) = 5 * (0.5)^4 * (0.5)^1\nP(4) = 5 * 0.0625 * 0.5\nP(4) = 0.15625\n\nFinally, let's find the probability of having all 5 volunteers:\n\nP(5) = C(5, 5) * (0.5)^5 * (1-0.5)^(5-5)\nP(5) = 1 * (0.5)^5 * (0.5)^0\nP(5) = 1 * 0.03125 * 1\nP(5) = 0.03125\n\nNow, we can add these probabilities together to find the probability of having at least 3 volunteers:\n\nP(at least 3) = P(3) + P(4) + P(5)\nP(at least 3) = 0.3125 + 0.15625 + 0.03125\nP(at least 3) = 0.5\n\nSo, the probability that the project will move forward and all volunteers will receive their reward is 0.5 or 50%."
