    "message_1": "A company conducted a survey of the salaries of its employees. The salaries ranged from $25,000 to $175,000. The company observed that there was one salary that was significantly different from the rest. The mean salary of the employees was calculated as $75,000 with a standard deviation of $20,000. \n\nWhat is the z-score for the outlier salary and is it considered an outlier for the dataset?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the z-score for the outlier salary, we first need to identify the salary value. Since the range is from $25,000 to $175,000, we can assume that the outlier salary is $175,000, as it is significantly different from the rest.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the data point (outlier salary), μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, X = $175,000, μ = $75,000, and σ = $20,000.\n\nz = ($175,000 - $75,000) / $20,000\nz = $100,000 / $20,000\nz = 5\n\nThe z-score for the outlier salary is 5.\n\nA z-score above 2 or below -2 is generally considered an outlier. Since the z-score for the outlier salary is 5, it is considered an outlier for the dataset."
