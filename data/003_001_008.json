    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, we have:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nwhere c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides. We are given that the hypotenuse (c) is 10 cm and one leg (a) is 6 cm. We need to find the length of the other leg (b). Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\n10² = 6² + b²\n100 = 36 + b²\n\nNow, we can solve for b²:\n\nb² = 100 - 36\nb² = 64\n\nFinally, we find the length of the other leg (b) by taking the square root of 64:\n\nb = √64\nb = 8\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 8 cm."
