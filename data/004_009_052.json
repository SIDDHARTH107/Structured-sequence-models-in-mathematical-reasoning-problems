    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 sin(x) + 3x^3 cos(x) using the product rule, we need to apply the product rule to each term separately and then add the results.\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. Mathematically, this is written as:\n\n(d/dx)[u(x)v(x)] = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nLet's apply the product rule to each term in the function:\n\n1) For the first term, x^2 sin(x), let u(x) = x^2 and v(x) = sin(x). Then, u'(x) = 2x and v'(x) = cos(x).\n\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n\n(d/dx)[x^2 sin(x)] = (2x)(sin(x)) + (x^2)(cos(x)) = 2x sin(x) + x^2 cos(x)\n\n2) For the second term, 3x^3 cos(x), let u(x) = 3x^3 and v(x) = cos(x). Then, u'(x) = 9x^2 and v'(x) = -sin(x).\n\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n\n(d/dx)[3x^3 cos(x)] = (9x^2)(cos(x)) + (3x^3)(-sin(x)) = 9x^2 cos(x) - 3x^3 sin(x)\n\nNow, we add the derivatives of both terms:\n\nf'(x) = (2x sin(x) + x^2 cos(x)) + (9x^2 cos(x) - 3x^3 sin(x))\n\nf'(x) = 2x sin(x) + x^2 cos(x) + 9x^2 cos(x) - 3x^3 sin(x)\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 sin(x) + 3x^3 cos(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 2x sin(x) + x^2 cos(x) + 9x^2 cos(x) - 3x^3 sin(x)"
