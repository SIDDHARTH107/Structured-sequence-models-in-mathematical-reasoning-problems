    "message_1": "What is the surface area of a cylinder with a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm? Round your answer to the nearest square centimeter.",
    "message_2": "The surface area of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr(h + r)\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nIn this case, r = 5 cm and h = 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(5)(10 + 5)\nSurface Area = 2π(5)(15)\nSurface Area = 2π(75)\nSurface Area ≈ 2(3.14)(75)\nSurface Area ≈ 6.28(75)\nSurface Area ≈ 471\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately 471 square centimeters, rounded to the nearest square centimeter."
