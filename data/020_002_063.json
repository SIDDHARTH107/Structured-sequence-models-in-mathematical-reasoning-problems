    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve about Nonlinear Programming:\n\nA company manufactures two products, Product A and Product B. The profits for each product are $3 and $5, respectively. The maximum number of units that can be made is 12, and the number of units of Product A cannot exceed 8. The manufacturing process for these products requires two types of resources, Resource X and Resource Y. The total resources available are 24 units of Resource X and 16 units of Resource Y. The resources required for each product are:\n\n- Product A requires 2 units of Resource X and 1 unit of Resource Y.\n- Product B requires 3 units of Resource X and 2 units of Resource Y.\n\nWrite the objective function and constraint equations for this problem, and determine the optimal production plan that maximizes profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to formulate the objective function and constraint equations. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nObjective function (to maximize profit):\nP = 3x + 5y\n\nConstraints:\n1. The maximum number of units that can be made is 12.\nx + y ≤ 12\n\n2. The number of units of Product A cannot exceed 8.\nx ≤ 8\n\n3. The total resources available are 24 units of Resource X and 16 units of Resource Y.\n2x + 3y ≤ 24 (Resource X constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 16 (Resource Y constraint)\n\n4. Non-negativity constraints:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow we need to find the optimal production plan that maximizes profit. To do this, we will graph the constraint equations and find the feasible region. Then, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex of the feasible region to find the maximum profit.\n\nThe feasible region is determined by the following inequalities:\nx + y ≤ 12\nx ≤ 8\n2x + 3y ≤ 24\nx + 2y ≤ 16\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\nA: (0, 0)\nB: (0, 8)\nC: (4, 6)\nD: (8, 4)\nE: (8, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 3x + 5y at each vertex:\n\nA: P(0, 0) = 3(0) + 5(0) = 0\nB: P(0, 8) = 3(0) + 5(8) = 40\nC: P(4, 6) = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42\nD: P(8, 4) = 3(8) + 5(4) = 24 + 20 = 44\nE: P(8, 0) = 3(8) + 5(0) = 24\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at vertex D with a profit of $44. The optimal production plan is to produce 8 units of Product A and 4 units of Product B."
