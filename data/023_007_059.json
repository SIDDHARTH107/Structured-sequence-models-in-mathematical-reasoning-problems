    "message_1": "A signal has a frequency content of 5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 15 Hz. Using the Fourier transform, find the amplitude and phase angle of each frequency component.",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and phase angle of each frequency component using the Fourier transform, we need to know the time-domain representation of the signal. The Fourier transform is a mathematical tool that allows us to decompose a time-domain signal into its frequency components. However, without the time-domain signal or its equation, we cannot perform the Fourier transform.\n\nPlease provide the time-domain representation or the equation of the signal, and then we can proceed to find the amplitude and phase angle of each frequency component using the Fourier transform."
