    "message_2": "G is a group of order 15, which means that the number of elements in G is 15. Since 15 = 3 * 5, where 3 and 5 are prime numbers, we can apply the Sylow theorems to analyze the structure of G.\n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup P of order 3 and a Sylow 5-subgroup Q of order 5 in G. Let's denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups as n_3 and the number of Sylow 5-subgroups as n_5.\n\nBy Sylow's third theorem, n_3 must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility for n_3 is 1. Similarly, n_5 must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 5, which also gives us only one possibility: n_5 = 1.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup and one Sylow 5-subgroup, both P and Q are normal subgroups of G. Now, we can consider the product of these two subgroups, PQ. Since P and Q are normal subgroups, the product PQ is also a subgroup of G.\n\nThe order of PQ is given by the formula |PQ| = (|P| * |Q|) / |P ∩ Q|. Since P and Q have prime orders, their intersection is either the identity element or the entire group. However, since their orders are different, their intersection can only be the identity element. Thus, |P ∩ Q| = 1.\n\nTherefore, |PQ| = (3 * 5) / 1 = 15, which is the order of G. Since PQ is a subgroup of G with the same order as G, PQ = G.\n\nNow, we can conclude that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are both cyclic groups of orders 3 and 5, respectively. So, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 3 and 5."
