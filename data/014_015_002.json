    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using the rail fence cipher with three rails, we write the message in a zigzag pattern along the rails and then read the message along the rows. Here's how the message would look like on the rails:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, we read the message along the rows:\n\nHORELWLDLO\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"HORELWLDLO\"."
