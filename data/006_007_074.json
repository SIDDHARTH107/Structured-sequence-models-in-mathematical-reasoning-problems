    "message_1": "Suppose that a stock has a 60% chance of increasing in price tomorrow and a 40% chance of decreasing in price. If the stock increases, it is expected to increase by 5 dollars, and if it decreases, it is expected to decrease by 4 dollars. What is the probability that the stock price will increase by at least 3 dollars tomorrow?",
    "message_2": "Since the stock has a 60% chance of increasing in price and the increase is expected to be 5 dollars, the probability of the stock price increasing by at least 3 dollars tomorrow is the same as the probability of the stock price increasing, which is 60%."
