    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Peano-Gosper curve or the flowsnake, is a space-filling curve that grows with each iteration. The area of the Gosper curve can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nArea = (side_length^2 * n * (7^iteration - 1)) / (6 * (7^iteration - 6))\n\nwhere side_length is the initial side length of the curve, n is the number of initial sides (which is 1 for the Gosper curve), and iteration is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the fourth iteration of the Gosper curve with an initial side length of 10 cm:\n\nArea = (10^2 * 1 * (7^4 - 1)) / (6 * (7^4 - 6))\nArea = (100 * (2401 - 1)) / (6 * (2401 - 6))\nArea = (100 * 2400) / (6 * 2395)\nArea = 240000 / 14370\nArea â‰ˆ 16,705.22 cm^2\n\nThe area of the fourth iteration of the Gosper curve with an initial side length of 10 cm is approximately 16,705.22 cm^2."
