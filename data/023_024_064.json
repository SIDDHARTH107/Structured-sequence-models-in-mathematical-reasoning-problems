    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the given function, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is odd, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe general form of the Fourier series for an odd function is:\n\nf(x) = ∑ (b_n * sin(nωx))\n\nwhere ω = 2π / T, and T is the period of the function (T = 2 in this case).\n\nTo find the b_n coefficients, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nωx)] dx, integrated over one period.\n\nSince the function is defined differently for x < 0 and x > 0, we need to split the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (2/2) * [∫[1 * sin(nωx)] dx from -1 to 0 + ∫[0 * sin(nωx)] dx from 0 to 1]\n\nThe second integral is zero, so we only need to compute the first integral:\n\nb_n = ∫[sin(nωx)] dx from -1 to 0\n\nb_n = [-cos(nωx) / (nω)] from -1 to 0\n\nb_n = [-cos(nω(0)) / (nω) + cos(nω(-1)) / (nω)]\n\nSince ω = 2π, we have:\n\nb_n = [-cos(0) / (n * 2π) + cos(-2πn) / (n * 2π)]\n\nb_n = [-1 / (n * 2π) + 1 / (n * 2π)] = 0\n\nSo, all b_n coefficients are zero. This means that the Fourier series for the given function is a constant, which is equal to the average value of the function over one period:\n\nf(x) = 1/2\n\nThe Fourier series for the given function is:\n\nf(x) = 1/2"
