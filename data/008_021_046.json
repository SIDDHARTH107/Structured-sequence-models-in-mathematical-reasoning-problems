    "message_2": "Since the coefficient matrix is singular, it means that the given system of linear equations is either inconsistent (no solution) or dependent (infinitely many solutions). Let's analyze the given system:\n\n$\\begin{cases} 3x - 2y = 1 \\\\ 6x - 4y = 2\\end{cases}$\n\nWe can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n$\\begin{cases} 3x - 2y = 1 \\\\ 3x - 2y = 1\\end{cases}$\n\nNow we can see that both equations are the same, which means they represent the same line. In this case, the system of linear equations is dependent and has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo express the solutions, we can solve one of the equations for either variable. Let's solve the first equation for y:\n\n$2y = 3x - 1$\n\n$y = \\frac{3}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, the solutions to the system of linear equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the line $y = \\frac{3}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2}$."
