    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted by A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. In this case:\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) - ({2, 3}) = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A and B. The complement of a set is the set of elements not in the given set. We need to define a universal set U that contains all the elements under consideration. Let's assume U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} for this problem.\n\nA' = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 2, 3} = {4, 5}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4} = {1, 5}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of A' and B', denoted by A' △ B':\n\nA' △ B' = (A' ∪ B') - (A' ∩ B') = ({4, 5} ∪ {1, 5}) - ({5}) = {1, 4}\n\nNow let's find the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted by (A △ B)':\n\n(A △ B)' = U - (A △ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 4} = {2, 3, 5}\n\nNow we can compare (A' △ B') and (A △ B)':\n\n(A' △ B') = {1, 4}\n(A △ B)' = {2, 3, 5}\n\nSince (A' △ B') ≠ (A △ B)', we have verified that the symmetric difference of A' and B' is not equal to the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B."
