    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, the implication `p → q` is true if either `p` is false or `q` is true. In this case, `p` is true and `q` is false, so `p → q` is false.\n\nNow, we have `¬(p → q) → p`. Since `p → q` is false, `¬(p → q)` is true. Therefore, the whole formula `¬(p → q) → p` is true when `p` is true and `q` is false. So, the resulting truth value of the formula is true."
