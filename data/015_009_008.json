    "message_2": "To find the Lyapunov exponent of a nonlinear system described by a differential equation, we first need to linearize the system around its fixed points. The fixed points are the points where dx/dt = 0. In this case, we have:\n\nx^2 - 1 = 0\nx^2 = 1\nx = ±1\n\nSo, we have two fixed points: x = 1 and x = -1. Now, we linearize the system around these fixed points by finding the derivative of the function with respect to x:\n\nd(dx/dt)/dx = 2x\n\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the fixed points:\n\nFor x = 1: 2(1) = 2\nFor x = -1: 2(-1) = -2\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent is given by the real part of the eigenvalues of the linearized system. In this case, the eigenvalues are simply the values of the derivative at the fixed points. Since the initial condition is x(0) = 1.5, which is closer to the fixed point x = 1, we will consider the Lyapunov exponent for this fixed point.\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent for this system is λ = 2."
