    "message_2": "To find the number of fixed points of the action of G on X, we can use the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The formula relates the genus of a curve X, the genus of its quotient curve Y = X/G, and the ramification points of the covering map X → Y.\n\nThe Riemann-Hurwitz formula is given by:\n\n2g(X) - 2 = |G|(2g(Y) - 2) + Σ(e_i - 1),\n\nwhere g(X) is the genus of X, g(Y) is the genus of Y, e_i are the ramification indices of the covering map, and the sum is taken over all ramification points.\n\nIn our case, we have g(X) = 3 and |G| = 5. We want to find the number of fixed points, which are the ramification points of the covering map. Since the action of G on X is fixed-point-free, we have e_i = 5 for all ramification points.\n\nLet n be the number of fixed points. Then the Riemann-Hurwitz formula becomes:\n\n2(3) - 2 = 5(2g(Y) - 2) + n(5 - 1).\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n4 = 10g(Y) - 10 + 4n.\n\nNow, we need to find g(Y). Since Y = X/G, the genus of Y must be less than or equal to the genus of X. The only possibilities for g(Y) are 0, 1, or 2.\n\nIf g(Y) = 0, then 4 = 10(0) - 10 + 4n, which gives n = 3/2. This is not an integer, so g(Y) ≠ 0.\n\nIf g(Y) = 1, then 4 = 10(1) - 10 + 4n, which gives n = 1. This is an integer, so g(Y) = 1 is a possibility.\n\nIf g(Y) = 2, then 4 = 10(2) - 10 + 4n, which gives n = -1/2. This is not an integer, so g(Y) ≠ 2.\n\nTherefore, g(Y) = 1, and the number of fixed points of the action of G on X is n = 1."
