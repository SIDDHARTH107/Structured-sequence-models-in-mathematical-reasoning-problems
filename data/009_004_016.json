    "message_1": "Consider a mass-spring-damper system, where the mass is 2 kg, the spring constant is 10 N/m, and the damping constant is 4 Ns/m. If the system is initially at rest and the external force acting on it is given by F(t) = 4cos(2t), determine the equation of motion for this system and find the amplitude, frequency, and phase angle of its steady-state response.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion for the mass-spring-damper system, we can use the following formula:\n\nm * x''(t) + c * x'(t) + k * x(t) = F(t)\n\nwhere m is the mass, c is the damping constant, k is the spring constant, x(t) is the displacement of the mass at time t, and F(t) is the external force acting on the system.\n\nGiven the values for m, c, k, and F(t), we can plug them into the equation:\n\n2 * x''(t) + 4 * x'(t) + 10 * x(t) = 4cos(2t)\n\nNow, we need to find the steady-state response of the system. To do this, we assume a solution of the form:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, ω is the frequency, and φ is the phase angle. Taking the first and second derivatives of x(t) with respect to time t, we get:\n\nx'(t) = -A * ω * sin(ωt + φ)\nx''(t) = -A * ω^2 * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the equation of motion:\n\n2 * (-A * ω^2 * cos(ωt + φ)) + 4 * (-A * ω * sin(ωt + φ)) + 10 * (A * cos(ωt + φ)) = 4cos(2t)\n\nSince the external force has a frequency of 2 rad/s, we can set ω = 2:\n\n2 * (-A * 4 * cos(2t + φ)) + 4 * (-A * 2 * sin(2t + φ)) + 10 * (A * cos(2t + φ)) = 4cos(2t)\n\nNow, we can equate the coefficients of the cosine and sine terms:\n\n-8A + 10A = 4  (cosine terms)\n-8A * sin(φ) = 0  (sine terms)\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\nA = 4/2 = 2\nsin(φ) = 0\n\nSince sin(φ) = 0, φ can be 0 or π. In this case, we choose φ = 0 as it represents the simplest solution.\n\nSo, the steady-state response of the system is:\n\nx(t) = 2 * cos(2t)\n\nThe amplitude is A = 2, the frequency is ω = 2 rad/s, and the phase angle is φ = 0."
