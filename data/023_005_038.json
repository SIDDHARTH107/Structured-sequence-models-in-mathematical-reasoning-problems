    "message_1": "A tank of water is initially at rest. At time t=0, the water is thrown into a state of motion by an oscillating plate. The height of the water's wave above its equilibrium level is given by the function: h(x,0) = 0.2x^2, where x is measured in meters. The tank is 2m long, and the plate creates waves at a frequency of 4 Hz. Using the Fourier transform, determine the equation that describes the position of the water's waves at any given time.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation that describes the position of the water's waves at any given time, we will use the Fourier series representation of the initial height function h(x,0) = 0.2x^2. Since the tank is 2 meters long, we will consider the interval [0, 2] and extend the function h(x,0) to be an even function on the interval [-2, 2]. This means that we only need to compute the cosine terms of the Fourier series.\n\nThe Fourier series representation of an even function is given by:\n\nh(x,t) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L) * cos(ω_n*t)]\n\nwhere L is half the length of the interval (in this case, L = 1), ω_n = 2πnν (angular frequency), and ν is the frequency (4 Hz). The coefficients a_n are given by:\n\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[h(x,0) * cos(nπx/L)] dx, from 0 to L\n\nFirst, we find a_0:\n\na_0 = (2/1) * ∫[0.2x^2] dx, from 0 to 1\na_0 = 2 * [0.2x^3/3] evaluated from 0 to 1\na_0 = 2 * (0.2/3) = 4/15\n\nNow, we find a_n:\n\na_n = 2 * ∫[0.2x^2 * cos(nπx)] dx, from 0 to 1\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = 0.2x^2, dv = cos(nπx) dx\ndu = 0.4x dx, v = (1/nπ) * sin(nπx)\n\nNow, we compute the integral:\n\na_n = 2 * [(0.2x^2 * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx)) - ∫(0.4x * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx) dx)], from 0 to 1\n\nWe need to use integration by parts again:\n\nu = 0.4x, dv = sin(nπx) dx\ndu = 0.4 dx, v = -(1/nπ) * cos(nπx)\n\nNow, we compute the integral:\n\na_n = 2 * [(0.2x^2 * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx)) + (0.4x * (1/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx)) + (0.4 * (1/n^2π^2) * ∫cos(nπx) dx)], from 0 to 1\n\na_n = 2 * [(0.2x^2 * (1/nπ) * sin(nπx)) + (0.4x * (1/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx)) + (0.4 * (1/n^3π^3) * sin(nπx))], from 0 to 1\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 and cos(nπ) = (-1)^n for integer values of n, we get:\n\na_n = 2 * [(-1)^n * (0.4/n^2π^2) - (0.4/n^3π^3)]\n\nNow, we can write the equation for the position of the water's waves at any given time:\n\nh(x,t) = (4/15)/2 + Σ[(-1)^n * (0.4/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx) * cos(2πn*4*t) - (0.4/n^3π^3) * cos(nπx) * cos(2πn*4*t)]\n\nh(x,t) = 2/15 + Σ[(-1)^n * (0.4/n^2π^2 - 0.4/n^3π^3) * cos(nπx) * cos(8πn*t)]\n\nThis equation describes the position of the water's waves at any given time t and position x in the tank."
