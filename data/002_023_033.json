    "message_1": "What is the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 5 cm?",
    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula A = 4πr², where A is the surface area and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven a sphere with a radius of 5 cm, we can plug the value into the formula:\n\nA = 4π(5)²\nA = 4π(25)\nA = 100π\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is 100π square centimeters. If you want a numerical approximation, you can use the value of π ≈ 3.14159:\n\nA ≈ 100 * 3.14159\nA ≈ 314.159 square centimeters."
