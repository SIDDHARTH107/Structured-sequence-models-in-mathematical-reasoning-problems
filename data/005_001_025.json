    "message_1": "A car company claims that their new electric car model has an average mileage of 250 miles per full charge. A sample of 50 cars is taken and their average mileage is found to be 245 miles with a standard deviation of 20 miles. \n\nCan you determine whether there is sufficient evidence to reject the company's claim at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To determine whether there is sufficient evidence to reject the company's claim at a significance level of 0.05, we will perform a one-sample t-test.\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The average mileage is 250 miles per full charge (µ = 250).\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The average mileage is not 250 miles per full charge (µ ≠ 250).\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 245 miles\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 20 miles\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is large (n > 30), we can use the z-test. First, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n = 20 / √50 ≈ 2.83\n\nNext, we calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (x̄ - µ) / SE = (245 - 250) / 2.83 ≈ -1.77\n\nNow, we need to find the critical z-value for a two-tailed test at a 0.05 significance level:\n\nz_critical = ±1.96\n\nSince the calculated z-score (-1.77) falls within the range of the critical z-values (-1.96 to 1.96), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to reject the company's claim that the average mileage is 250 miles per full charge at a significance level of 0.05."
