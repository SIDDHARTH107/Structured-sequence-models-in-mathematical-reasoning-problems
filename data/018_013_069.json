    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products and the union involved in the expressions.\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}\nB ∪ C = {3, 4}\nA × (B ∪ C) = A × {3, 4} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) ∪ C:\n\n(A × B) ∪ C = {(1, 3), (2, 3)} ∪ {4}\n\nSince C is a set with a single element, and the elements of A × B are ordered pairs, we cannot directly take the union of these two sets. To make the union operation valid, we need to represent the element in C as an ordered pair. We can do this by introducing a \"dummy\" element, say D = {0}, and taking the Cartesian product of C and D:\n\nC × D = {4} × {0} = {(4, 0)}\n\nNow we can take the union of (A × B) and (C × D):\n\n(A × B) ∪ (C × D) = {(1, 3), (2, 3)} ∪ {(4, 0)} = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (4, 0)}\n\nNow let's compare the two expressions:\n\n(A × B) ∪ C = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (4, 0)}\nA × (B ∪ C) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, the two expressions are not equal:\n\n(A × B) ∪ C ≠ A × (B ∪ C)\n\nThis shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union."
