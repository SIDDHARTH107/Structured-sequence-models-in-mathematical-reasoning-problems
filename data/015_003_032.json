    "message_2": "To find the value of the bifurcation parameter \"r\" at which the logistic map exhibits a period-3 behavior, we need to find the value of r for which there exists a point x such that the logistic map iterated three times returns to x.\n\nLet's denote the logistic map function as f(x) = r * x * (1 - x). We want to find r such that there exists x with f(f(f(x))) = x.\n\nFirst, let's find the fixed points of the logistic map, i.e., the points x for which f(x) = x:\n\nx = r * x * (1 - x)\nx - r * x^2 + r * x^3 = 0\nx(1 - r * x + r * x^2) = 0\n\nThere are two fixed points: x = 0 and x = 1 - 1/r.\n\nNow, we want to find the value of r for which there exists a point x with period 3. This means that f(f(f(x))) = x, but f(f(x)) ≠ x and f(x) ≠ x. Let's denote f(f(x)) as g(x) and f(f(f(x))) as h(x). Then, we have:\n\nh(x) = f(g(x)) = r * g(x) * (1 - g(x))\n\nSince h(x) = x, we can write:\n\nx = r * g(x) * (1 - g(x))\n\nNow, we need to find the value of r for which there exists a point x with period 3. To do this, we can use the fact that the period-doubling bifurcation occurs when the fixed point x = 1 - 1/r loses its stability. This happens when the absolute value of the derivative of h(x) with respect to x is equal to 1:\n\n|dh/dx| = 1\n\nTo find the derivative of h(x), we first need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x):\n\ndf/dx = r - 2 * r * x\ndg/dx = df/dx * df(g(x))/dx\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of h(x):\n\ndh/dx = df(g(x))/dx * df(g(g(x)))/dx\n\nWe want to find the value of r for which |dh/dx| = 1 at the fixed point x = 1 - 1/r. Plugging this value of x into the equation for dh/dx, we get:\n\n|dh/dx| = |(r - 2 * r * (1 - 1/r)) * (r - 2 * r * g(1 - 1/r))|\n\nSetting |dh/dx| = 1 and solving for r, we get:\n\n|(r - 2 * r * (1 - 1/r)) * (r - 2 * r * g(1 - 1/r))| = 1\n\nThis equation is transcendental and cannot be solved analytically. However, we can find the value of r numerically using a computer or calculator. The value of r at which the logistic map exhibits a period-3 behavior is approximately:\n\nr ≈ 3.82843"
