    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH\" using the Hill Cipher with a 2x2 encryption matrix, we first need to choose an encryption matrix. The matrix should be invertible (i.e., have a non-zero determinant) and its elements should be integers modulo 26 (since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet).\n\nLet's choose the following encryption matrix:\n\n```\n| 3  2 |\n| 5  7 |\n```\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is (3 * 7) - (2 * 5) = 21 - 10 = 11, which is non-zero, so this matrix is invertible.\n\nNow, we need to convert the message \"MATH\" into numerical values using the alphabetical index (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25):\n\nM = 12\nA = 0\nT = 19\nH = 7\n\nWe will split the message into 2-letter blocks and represent them as column vectors:\n\n```\n| 12 |   | 19 |\n|  0 |,  |  7 |\n```\n\nNow, we multiply each of these vectors by the encryption matrix:\n\n```\n| 3  2 |   | 12 |   | 36  |\n| 5  7 | * |  0 | = |  0  |\n\n| 3  2 |   | 19 |   | 76  |\n| 5  7 | * |  7 | = | 154 |\n```\n\nNow, we need to take the results modulo 26:\n\n```\n| 36  |   | 10 |\n|  0  | ≡ |  0 |\n\n| 76  |   |  0 |\n| 154 | ≡ |  4 |\n```\n\nNow, we convert the numerical values back to letters:\n\n10 -> K\n0 -> A\n0 -> A\n4 -> E\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"KAAE\"."
