    "message_2": "First, let's find the number of non-abelian groups of order 72. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. Using the formula for the number of groups of a given order, we have:\n\nn(72) = n(2^3) * n(3^2) = (3 + 1)(2 + 1) = 12\n\nOut of these 12 groups, we know that there are 3 abelian groups: C72 (cyclic group of order 72), C36 × C2, and C18 × C4. Therefore, there are 12 - 3 = 9 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nNow, let's prove that every group of order 72 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C72, the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2, or one of those non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nLet G be a group of order 72. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n3) divides 8 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n3 can be 1 or 4. If n3 = 1, then G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, and G is a semi-direct product of its Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, G is isomorphic to either C72 or one of the non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nIf n3 = 4, then G has 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P3 be one of these subgroups. Since the index of P3 in G is 4, which is the smallest prime dividing the order of G, P3 is a normal subgroup of its normalizer NG(P3). By the Frattini argument, G = NG(P3)P2, where P2 is a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since P2 has order 8, it is isomorphic to either C8, C4 × C2, or D8 (dihedral group of order 8). In each of these cases, G is isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 72, except when P2 is isomorphic to C4 × C2 and G is isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2.\n\nThus, every group of order 72 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C72, the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2, or one of the 9 non-abelian groups of order 72."
