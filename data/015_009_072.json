    "message_2": "To calculate the Lyapunov exponent for this system, we need to analyze the sensitivity of the system to small perturbations in the initial conditions. The Lyapunov exponent is defined as the average exponential rate of divergence of nearby trajectories in the phase space.\n\nLet's denote the perturbation in the initial conditions as δxₙ. Then, we can write the perturbed system as:\n\nxₙ' = sin( π × xₙ₋₁' ) + xₙ₋₂'\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the perturbed and the original system:\n\nΔxₙ = xₙ' - xₙ = sin( π × (xₙ₋₁ + δxₙ₋₁) ) + xₙ₋₂ + δxₙ₋₂ - sin( π × xₙ₋₁ ) - xₙ₋₂\n\nUsing the first-order Taylor expansion for the sine function, we get:\n\nΔxₙ ≈ π × cos( π × xₙ₋₁ ) × δxₙ₋₁ + δxₙ₋₂\n\nNow, we can calculate the Lyapunov exponent (λ) by finding the average exponential rate of divergence:\n\nλ = lim (n → ∞) [ (1/n) × ln( |Δxₙ/δx₀| ) ]\n\nHowever, calculating the Lyapunov exponent analytically for this system is quite challenging. Instead, we can use a numerical approach to estimate the Lyapunov exponent by iterating the system for a large number of steps and calculating the average exponential rate of divergence.\n\nHere's a simple algorithm to estimate the Lyapunov exponent:\n\n1. Set initial conditions x₁ = 1.2, x₂ = 0.8, and a small perturbation δx₀.\n2. Iterate the system for a large number of steps (e.g., 10,000) using the given equations.\n3. Calculate the average exponential rate of divergence using the formula for λ.\n\nKeep in mind that this will only provide an estimation of the Lyapunov exponent, and the accuracy of the result will depend on the number of iterations and the size of the perturbation."
