    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference (A ∆ B) and the union (B ∪ A).\n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1, 3, 5} ∪ {2, 4, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and (B ∪ A).\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ (B ∪ A) = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}) ∪ ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} - {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}) = {7} ∪ {} = {7}\n\nNow, let's check if it follows the property of distributivity. Distributive property states that A ∆ (B ∪ C) = (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C). In this case, we don't have a third set C, so we cannot verify the distributive property directly.\n\nHowever, we can check if the symmetric difference operation is associative, which is a related property. Associative property states that (A ∆ B) ∆ C = A ∆ (B ∆ C). If the symmetric difference operation is associative, then it implies that the distributive property holds as well.\n\nLet's use set C = {3, 5, 7, 9} and check if the symmetric difference operation is associative:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ C = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ∆ {3, 5, 7, 9}) = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}\nA ∆ (B ∆ C) = {1, 3, 5, 7} ∆ ({2, 4, 6, 7, 9}) = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}\n\nSince (A ∆ B) ∆ C = A ∆ (B ∆ C), the symmetric difference operation is associative. However, as mentioned earlier, we cannot directly verify the distributive property with the given sets A and B."
