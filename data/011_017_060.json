    "message_1": "Suppose you have a 4x4 grid and you want to fill it with numbers 1 to 4 so that no number is repeated in a row or a column. How many possible ways can you fill the grid?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using combinatorics. We can think of this as a permutation problem, where we want to arrange the numbers 1 to 4 in each row and column without repetition.\n\nFor the first row, we have 4 choices for the first number, 3 choices for the second number, 2 choices for the third number, and 1 choice for the last number. So, there are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange the numbers in the first row.\n\nFor the second row, we have 3 choices for the first number (since it cannot be the same as the number above it), 2 choices for the second number, and then 2 choices for the third number (since it cannot be the same as the number above it). The last number is determined by the previous choices. So, there are 3 * 2 * 2 ways to arrange the numbers in the second row.\n\nFor the third row, there are 2 choices for the first number, 2 choices for the second number, and 1 choice for the third number. The last number is determined by the previous choices. So, there are 2 * 2 ways to arrange the numbers in the third row.\n\nFor the last row, the arrangement is determined by the previous choices, so there is only 1 way to arrange the numbers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to fill the 4x4 grid is:\n\n4! * (3 * 2 * 2) * (2 * 2) * 1 = 24 * 12 * 4 * 1 = 1152 ways."
