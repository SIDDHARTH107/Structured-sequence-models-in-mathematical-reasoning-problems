    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the two curves y = x^2 and y = 4x - x^2, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 4x - x^2\n\n2x^2 = 4x\n\nx^2 = 2x\n\nx(x - 2) = 0\n\nThe points of intersection are x = 0 and x = 2. Now we can set up the integral to find the area between the curves. The area will be the integral of the difference between the two functions from x = 0 to x = 2:\n\nArea = ∫(4x - x^2 - x^2)dx from 0 to 2\n\nArea = ∫(4x - 2x^2)dx from 0 to 2\n\nNow we can integrate the function:\n\nArea = [2x^2 - (2/3)x^3] evaluated from 0 to 2\n\nArea = (2(2)^2 - (2/3)(2)^3) - (2(0)^2 - (2/3)(0)^3)\n\nArea = (8 - 16) = -8\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nArea = 8 square units\n\nSo, the area enclosed between the two curves y = x^2 and y = 4x - x^2 is 8 square units."
