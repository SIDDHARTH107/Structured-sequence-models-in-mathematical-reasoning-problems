    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nv · w = ||v|| ||w|| cos(θ)\n\nwhere ||v|| and ||w|| are the magnitudes of the vectors v and w, respectively, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors v and w:\n\n||v|| = √((-3)^2 + (4)^2) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n||w|| = √((5)^2 + (2)^2) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the vectors. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (v · w) / (||v|| ||w||)\n\nwhere v · w is the dot product of v and w. We can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nv · w = (-3)(5) + (4)(2) = -15 + 8 = -7\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (-7) / (5 * √29)\n\nSince we want to find the dot product using trigonometry, we can plug cos(θ), ||v||, and ||w|| back into the formula:\n\nv · w = ||v|| ||w|| cos(θ) = 5 * √29 * (-7) / (5 * √29)\n\nThe 5 and √29 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nv · w = -7\n\nSo, the dot product of the two vectors v and w is -7."
