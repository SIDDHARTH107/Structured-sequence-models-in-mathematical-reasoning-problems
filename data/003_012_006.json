    "message_1": "A person standing at a distance of 20 meters from the base of a tower observes the angle of elevation of the top of the tower as 60 degrees. What is the height of the tower?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tower, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the distance from the person to the base of the tower (adjacent side) is 20 meters, and we want to find the height of the tower (opposite side).\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\ntan(60°) = height of the tower / 20 meters\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3 (approximately 1.732).\n\n1.732 = height of the tower / 20 meters\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the tower:\n\nheight of the tower = 1.732 * 20 meters\nheight of the tower ≈ 34.64 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tower is approximately 34.64 meters."
