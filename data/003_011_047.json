    "message_1": "A plane is flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet. The pilot spots a landmark on the ground and measures the angle of depression as 15°. Find the horizontal distance between the plane and the landmark. (Round the answer to the nearest foot.)",
    "message_2": "To find the horizontal distance between the plane and the landmark, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The angle of depression is 15°, which means the angle between the horizontal line from the plane to the ground and the line connecting the plane and the landmark is also 15°.\n\nLet x be the horizontal distance between the plane and the landmark. We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(15°) = (10,000 feet) / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (10,000 feet) / tan(15°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nx ≈ 37,878.5 feet\n\nRounding to the nearest foot, the horizontal distance between the plane and the landmark is approximately 37,879 feet."
