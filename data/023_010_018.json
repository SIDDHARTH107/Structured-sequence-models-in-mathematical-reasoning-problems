    "message_2": "To find the spatial frequency of the given 10 x 10 pixel grayscale image, we will first compute the 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the image. The DFT is given by the formula:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ(Σ(f(x, y) * e^(-j2π(ux/M + vy/N))), x=0 to M-1), y=0 to N-1\n\nwhere F(u, v) is the Fourier transform of the image, f(x, y) is the intensity value of the image at position (x, y), M and N are the dimensions of the image (in this case, both are 10), and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nAfter computing the DFT, we can find the magnitude of the Fourier transform, which represents the spatial frequency content of the image. The magnitude is given by:\n\n|F(u, v)| = sqrt(Re(F(u, v))^2 + Im(F(u, v))^2)\n\nwhere Re(F(u, v)) and Im(F(u, v)) are the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform, respectively.\n\nComputing the 2D DFT for the given image, we get the following Fourier transform:\n\nF(u, v) = [[1275, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nThe magnitude of the Fourier transform is:\n\n|F(u, v)| = [[1275, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nThe spatial frequency content of the image is concentrated at the (0, 0) position, which corresponds to the DC component or the average intensity of the image. The other spatial frequencies have zero magnitude, indicating that the image has no significant high-frequency content."
