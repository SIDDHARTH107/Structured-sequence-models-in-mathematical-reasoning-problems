    "message_1": "A rocket is launched from the surface of the Earth with initial velocity 100 m/s. The rocket is subject to gravity and air resistance, which acts in the opposite direction of its motion and is proportional to the rocket's velocity. The rocket's engine can provide a constant force of 2000 N. Assume that the mass decreases at a constant rate due to fuel consumption. Find the optimal control on the engine thrust that maximizes the altitude of the rocket after 200 seconds assuming that the rocket's initial mass is 4,500 kg and the remaining fuel has a mass of 1,000 kg.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the calculus of variations and Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Let's denote the following variables:\n\n- t: time (s)\n- x(t): altitude of the rocket (m)\n- v(t): velocity of the rocket (m/s)\n- m(t): mass of the rocket (kg)\n- u(t): control on the engine thrust (dimensionless, 0 ≤ u(t) ≤ 1)\n- F: constant force provided by the engine (2000 N)\n- g: gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²)\n- k: air resistance coefficient (kg/s)\n- T: total time (200 s)\n- M0: initial mass of the rocket (4500 kg)\n- Mf: final mass of the rocket (3500 kg)\n\nThe dynamics of the rocket can be described by the following system of differential equations:\n\n1. dx/dt = v\n2. dv/dt = (uF - k*v - m*g)/m\n3. dm/dt = -u*(M0 - Mf)/T\n\nNow, we will use Pontryagin's Maximum Principle to find the optimal control u(t) that maximizes the altitude x(T) after 200 seconds. We introduce the Hamiltonian function H:\n\nH(x, v, m, u, p_x, p_v, p_m) = p_x*v + p_v*((uF - k*v - m*g)/m) - p_m*(-u*(M0 - Mf)/T)\n\nwhere p_x(t), p_v(t), and p_m(t) are the costate variables.\n\nThe necessary conditions for optimality are:\n\n1. dH/du = 0\n2. dx/dt = ∂H/∂p_x\n3. dv/dt = ∂H/∂p_v\n4. dm/dt = ∂H/∂p_m\n5. dp_x/dt = -∂H/∂x\n6. dp_v/dt = -∂H/∂v\n7. dp_m/dt = -∂H/∂m\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n1. dH/du = p_v*(F/m) + p_m*((M0 - Mf)/T) = 0\n2. dx/dt = v\n3. dv/dt = (uF - k*v - m*g)/m\n4. dm/dt = -u*(M0 - Mf)/T\n5. dp_x/dt = 0\n6. dp_v/dt = -p_v*(-k/m)\n7. dp_m/dt = -p_v*(-g/m)\n\nFrom equation 1, we can find the optimal control u(t):\n\nu(t) = (p_v(t)*m(t))/(F*p_m(t) + p_v(t)*(M0 - Mf))\n\nNow, we need to solve the system of differential equations (2-7) with the initial conditions:\n\nx(0) = 0, v(0) = 100 m/s, m(0) = 4500 kg, p_x(0) = 0, p_v(0) = 0, p_m(0) = 0\n\nThis is a challenging task that requires numerical methods, such as the shooting method or collocation methods, to find the optimal trajectory and control. Once the optimal control u(t) is found, we can integrate the equations of motion to find the maximum altitude x(T) after 200 seconds."
