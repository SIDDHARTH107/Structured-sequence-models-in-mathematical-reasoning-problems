    "message_2": "The Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction is a complex oscillatory chemical reaction that exhibits a wide range of dynamical behaviors, including limit cycles. The number of limit cycles in the BZ reaction depends on the specific model used to describe the reaction and the parameter values.\n\nOne of the most commonly used models for the BZ reaction is the Oregonator model, which is a system of three ordinary differential equations with five parameters (F, k, ε, q, and ϕ). The parameters A, B, C, and D mentioned in the question do not directly correspond to the parameters in the Oregonator model.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of limit cycles for the given parameter values, we would need to know the specific model being used and how the parameters A, B, C, and D relate to the model parameters. Additionally, the analysis of limit cycles in such complex systems often requires advanced mathematical techniques, such as bifurcation analysis or numerical simulations.\n\nWithout more information about the model and the relationship between the given parameters and the model parameters, it is not possible to determine the maximum number of limit cycles in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction for the given parameter values."
