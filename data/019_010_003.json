    "message_2": "In linear logic, each proposition can be used exactly once. This is because linear logic is resource-sensitive, meaning that it keeps track of the number of times each proposition is used. \n\nIn the formula (A + B) × C, the propositions A, B, and C are each used once. The additive conjunction (+) allows for either A or B to be true, but not both. The multiplicative conjunction (×) requires both of its arguments to be true. So, in this formula, either A or B must be true, and C must also be true. Since each proposition is used once, the usage count for each proposition is as follows:\n\n- A: 1 time\n- B: 1 time\n- C: 1 time"
