    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nFind the Fourier series of the function f(x) defined as:\n\nf(x) = 1, –π ≤ x < 0\nf(x) = -1, 0 ≤ x ≤ π\n\nand then use it to evaluate the following integral:\n\n∫₀^π f(x) dx",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x), we need to determine the coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ. The function is an odd function, so the coefficients aₙ will be zero. The Fourier series for an odd function is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑[bₙ * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere bₙ = (2/π) * ∫₀^π f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nLet's find bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [∫₀^π (-1) * sin(n * x) dx]\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [-∫₀^π sin(n * x) dx]\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [-(-cos(n * x) / n) |₀^π]\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [(cos(n * π) - 1) / n]\n\nSince cos(n * π) is 1 for even n and -1 for odd n, we can rewrite bₙ as:\n\nbₙ = { (4/n * π) for odd n, 0 for even n }\n\nNow, we have the Fourier series:\n\nf(x) = ∑[(4/n * π) * sin(n * x)] for odd n\n\nNow, let's evaluate the integral ∫₀^π f(x) dx:\n\n∫₀^π f(x) dx = ∫₀^π ∑[(4/n * π) * sin(n * x)] dx for odd n\n\nWe can switch the order of summation and integration:\n\n∫₀^π f(x) dx = ∑[∫₀^π (4/n * π) * sin(n * x) dx] for odd n\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\n∫₀^π f(x) dx = ∑[-(4/n * π) * (cos(n * x) / n) |₀^π] for odd n\n\n∫₀^π f(x) dx = ∑[-(4/n² * π) * (cos(n * π) - 1)] for odd n\n\nSince cos(n * π) is 1 for even n and -1 for odd n, the terms with even n will be zero. Thus, we only need to consider the terms with odd n:\n\n∫₀^π f(x) dx = ∑[-(4/n² * π) * (-2)] for odd n\n\n∫₀^π f(x) dx = ∑[(8/n² * π)] for odd n\n\nThis is an alternating series, and it converges. However, the exact value of the integral depends on how many terms we want to consider in the series. The more terms we include, the more accurate the result will be."
