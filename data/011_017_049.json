    "message_1": "Suppose we have a Latin square of order 3, where each row and column contains the digits 1, 2, and 3 exactly once. How many distinct Latin squares of order 3 can be formed?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct Latin squares of order 3, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. The first row can be any permutation of the digits 1, 2, and 3. There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange these digits, which is equal to 6.\n\n2. For the second row, there are only 2 possible arrangements that will satisfy the Latin square property. For example, if the first row is 1-2-3, the second row can be either 2-3-1 or 3-1-2.\n\n3. Once the first two rows are determined, the third row is fixed, as each digit must appear exactly once in each column.\n\nSo, there are 6 possible arrangements for the first row and 2 possible arrangements for the second row, giving us a total of 6 * 2 = 12 possible Latin squares of order 3.\n\nHowever, we must account for the fact that some of these squares are just rotations or reflections of each other. There are 4 distinct Latin squares of order 3 when considering these symmetries:\n\n1.\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n3 1 2\n\n2.\n1 2 3\n3 1 2\n2 3 1\n\n3.\n1 3 2\n2 1 3\n3 2 1\n\n4.\n1 3 2\n3 2 1\n2 1 3\n\nSo, there are 4 distinct Latin squares of order 3."
