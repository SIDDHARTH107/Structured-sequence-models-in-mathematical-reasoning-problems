    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll first perform frequency analysis on the given ciphertext. In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. We'll compare the frequency of letters in the ciphertext to these common letters to determine the most likely shift value.\n\nCiphertext: Ymj vznhp gzyvozq tnzxxa f zmzqk\n\nFrequency analysis of the ciphertext:\nY: 2, M: 3, J: 1, V: 2, Z: 5, N: 2, H: 1, P: 1, G: 1, X: 2, A: 1, F: 1, K: 1, Q: 2, T: 1\n\nThe most frequent letter in the ciphertext is 'Z' with a frequency of 5. We'll assume that 'Z' corresponds to the most common letter in English, which is 'E'. To find the shift value, we'll calculate the difference between the positions of 'Z' and 'E' in the alphabet.\n\nShift value = (position of 'Z') - (position of 'E') = (26) - (5) = 21\n\nNow that we have the most likely shift value, we can decrypt the ciphertext using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 21.\n\nDecrypted plaintext: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the dog\"\n\nSo, the most likely shift value is 21, and the decrypted plaintext is \"The quick brown fox jumps over the dog\"."
