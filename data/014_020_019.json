    "message_1": "Suppose that a Vigenere cipher uses a keyword of length 5. The first letter of the plaintext message is 'K' which gets encrypted as 'N'. The third letter of the plaintext message is 'R' which gets encrypted as 'T'. What is the keyword used in this encryption?",
    "message_2": "To find the keyword used in this Vigenere cipher, we need to reverse the encryption process for the given letters.\n\nThe Vigenere cipher works by adding the plaintext letter and the keyword letter (mod 26) to get the encrypted letter. To reverse this process, we need to subtract the plaintext letter from the encrypted letter (mod 26).\n\nFor the first letter:\nEncrypted letter: N (position 14)\nPlaintext letter: K (position 11)\nKeyword letter: (14 - 11) mod 26 = 3\nThe first letter of the keyword is at position 3, which is 'D'.\n\nFor the third letter:\nEncrypted letter: T (position 20)\nPlaintext letter: R (position 18)\nKeyword letter: (20 - 18) mod 26 = 2\nThe third letter of the keyword is at position 2, which is 'C'.\n\nSo, the keyword is of the form \"D_C__\" (with underscores representing unknown letters). Since we don't have enough information to determine the other letters of the keyword, we cannot find the complete keyword."
