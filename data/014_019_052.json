If the message \"EXAMPLE MESSAGE\" was encrypted using a transposition cipher that rearranged the letters based on the position of their occurrence in the English alphabet, what is the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "First, let's assign a number to each letter based on its position in the English alphabet:\n\nE(5) X(24) A(1) M(13) P(16) L(12) E(5)  M(13) E(5) S(19) S(19) A(1) G(7) E(5)\n\nNow, let's rearrange the letters in ascending order based on their assigned numbers:\n\nA(1) A(1) E(5) E(5) E(5) E(5) G(7) L(12) M(13) M(13) P(16) S(19) S(19) X(24)\n\nThe encrypted message is \"AAEEEEEGLMMPSSSX\"."
