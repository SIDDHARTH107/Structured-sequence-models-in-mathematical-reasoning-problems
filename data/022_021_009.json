    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of the given function f(t) = e^(-2t)cos(3t), we will use the formula for the Laplace transform of a product of two functions:\n\nL{e^(at)f(t)} = F(s-a)\n\nwhere L denotes the Laplace transform, F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t), and a is a constant.\n\nIn our case, a = -2 and f(t) = cos(3t). First, we need to find the Laplace transform of cos(3t):\n\nL{cos(3t)} = ∫(e^(-st)cos(3t)dt) from 0 to ∞\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use integration by parts. Let u = e^(-st) and dv = cos(3t)dt. Then, du = -se^(-st)dt and v = (1/3)sin(3t).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\n∫(e^(-st)cos(3t)dt) = (1/3)e^(-st)sin(3t) - (1/3)∫(-se^(-st)sin(3t)dt)\n\nNow, we need to solve the second integral. Let w = -se^(-st) and dx = sin(3t)dt. Then, dw = -s^2e^(-st)dt and x = (-1/3)cos(3t).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula again:\n\n∫wdx = wx - ∫xdw\n\n∫(-se^(-st)sin(3t)dt) = (-s/3)e^(-st)cos(3t) - (-s^2/9)∫e^(-st)cos(3t)dt\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into our original integral:\n\nL{cos(3t)} = (1/3)e^(-st)sin(3t) + (s/9)e^(-st)cos(3t) + (s^2/9)∫e^(-st)cos(3t)dt\n\nRearranging the terms:\n\n(1 - s^2/9)L{cos(3t)} = (1/3)e^(-st)sin(3t) + (s/9)e^(-st)cos(3t)\n\nDivide both sides by (1 - s^2/9):\n\nL{cos(3t)} = [(1/3)e^(-st)sin(3t) + (s/9)e^(-st)cos(3t)] / (1 - s^2/9)\n\nNow, we can find the Laplace transform of e^(-2t)cos(3t) using the formula L{e^(at)f(t)} = F(s-a):\n\nL{e^(-2t)cos(3t)} = L{cos(3t)} evaluated at s = s + 2\n\nL{e^(-2t)cos(3t)} = [(1/3)e^(-(s+2)t)sin(3t) + ((s+2)/9)e^(-(s+2)t)cos(3t)] / (1 - (s+2)^2/9)\n\nL{e^(-2t)cos(3t)} = [(1/3)e^(-st)sin(3t) + (s/9)e^(-st)cos(3t)] / (1 - (s+2)^2/9)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of f(t) = e^(-2t)cos(3t) is:\n\nF(s) = [(1/3)e^(-st)sin(3t) + (s/9)e^(-st)cos(3t)] / (1 - (s+2)^2/9)"
