    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3. \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide the order of the group (48) and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup, and if n_3 = 4, there are four Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide the order of the group (48) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, and 15. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup, and if n_2 = 3 or 15, there are multiple Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nUsing this information, we can classify the non-isomorphic groups of order 48 as follows:\n\n1. If both n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, the group is the direct product of these subgroups, which gives us the group C_16 × C_3 (cyclic group of order 16 and cyclic group of order 3).\n\n2. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, the group is a semidirect product of the form C_16 ⋊ C_3. There are two non-isomorphic groups of this form, which are the dihedral group D_48 and the generalized quaternion group Q_48.\n\n3. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, there is a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup and three Sylow 2-subgroups. In this case, the group is a semidirect product of the form (C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2) ⋊ C_3. There is one non-isomorphic group of this form, which is the direct product C_2 × (C_2 × C_2 × C_2) ⋊ C_3.\n\n4. If n_2 = 15 and n_3 = 1, there is a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup and fifteen Sylow 2-subgroups. In this case, the group is a semidirect product of the form (C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2) ⋊ C_3. There is one non-isomorphic group of this form, which is the direct product C_2 × (C_2 × C_2 × C_2) ⋊ C_3.\n\nIn total, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 48:\n\n1. C_16 × C_3\n2. D_48 (dihedral group)\n3. Q_48 (generalized quaternion group)\n4. C_2 × (C_2 × C_2 × C_2) ⋊ C_3 (case 3)\n5. C_2 × (C_2 × C_2 × C_2) ⋊ C_3 (case 4)"
