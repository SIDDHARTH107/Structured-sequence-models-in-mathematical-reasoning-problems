    "message_1": "A company wants to minimize the cost of producing a certain product. The cost function is given by C(x,y) = 3x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2 + 4x + 5y + 6, where x and y are the two input variables. Find the values of x and y that minimize the cost of production using whale optimization algorithm.",
    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is a metaheuristic algorithm used to find the optimal solution for complex optimization problems. However, as an AI language model, I cannot execute the WOA directly. Instead, I will provide you with a general outline of how to implement the WOA to solve the given problem.\n\n1. Initialize the parameters: Define the population size (number of whales), maximum number of iterations, and search space boundaries for x and y.\n\n2. Generate the initial population: Randomly generate a set of solutions (whales) within the search space boundaries. Each whale is represented by a position vector (x, y).\n\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each whale: Calculate the cost function C(x, y) for each whale in the population and determine their fitness values.\n\n4. Main loop: Repeat the following steps until the maximum number of iterations is reached:\n\n  a. Update the position of the best whale (the one with the lowest cost function value) and the global best position.\n\n  b. Update the position of each whale in the population using the WOA equations, which involve the best whale's position, a random whale's position, and a random number. This step simulates the hunting behavior of humpback whales.\n\n  c. Check if the new positions of the whales are within the search space boundaries. If not, adjust them accordingly.\n\n  d. Evaluate the fitness of each whale with their new positions and update the best whale and global best position if necessary.\n\n5. Output the global best position (x, y) as the optimal solution for minimizing the cost function.\n\nPlease note that the WOA is a stochastic algorithm, and the results may vary between different runs. To increase the reliability of the solution, you can run the algorithm multiple times and choose the best result. Additionally, you can use other optimization algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) or Genetic Algorithm (GA) to compare and validate the results."
