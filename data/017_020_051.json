The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5. \n\nLet G be a group of order 40. By Sylow's theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, must divide 2^3 = 8 and satisfy n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 8. Similarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 5 and satisfy n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 5.\n\nNow, we can consider the possible structures of the Sylow subgroups and their corresponding isomorphism classes:\n\n1. n_5 = 1 and n_2 = 1: In this case, G has a unique 5-Sylow subgroup P_5 of order 5 and a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 8. Since both subgroups are unique, they are normal in G. The group G is the direct product of P_5 and P_2, so G ≅ C_5 × C_8, where C_n denotes the cyclic group of order n.\n\n2. n_5 = 1 and n_2 = 5: In this case, G has a unique 5-Sylow subgroup P_5 of order 5 and five 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8. Since P_5 is unique, it is normal in G. Let P_2 be one of the 2-Sylow subgroups. Then G has a semidirect product structure G ≅ P_5 ⋊ P_2. Since P_2 has order 8, it is either isomorphic to C_8 or D_4 (the dihedral group of order 8). If P_2 ≅ C_8, then G ≅ C_5 ⋊ C_8. If P_2 ≅ D_4, then G ≅ C_5 ⋊ D_4.\n\n3. n_5 = 8 and n_2 = 1: In this case, G has eight 5-Sylow subgroups of order 5 and a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 8. Since P_2 is unique, it is normal in G. Let P_5 be one of the 5-Sylow subgroups. Then G has a semidirect product structure G ≅ P_2 ⋊ P_5. Since P_2 has order 8, it is either isomorphic to C_8 or D_4. If P_2 ≅ C_8, then G ≅ C_8 ⋊ C_5. If P_2 ≅ D_4, then G ≅ D_4 ⋊ C_5.\n\nIn summary, there are five possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 40:\n\n1. G ≅ C_5 × C_8\n2. G ≅ C_5 ⋊ C_8\n3. G ≅ C_5 ⋊ D_4\n4. G ≅ C_8 ⋊ C_5\n5. G ≅ D_4 ⋊ C_5"
