    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform F(k) of the complex-valued function f(z) = e^(z/2), we need to use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(z) * e^(-2πikz)] dz\n\nHere, f(z) = e^(z/2), so we have:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(z/2) * e^(-2πikz)] dz\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(z/2 - 2πikz)] dz\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use the method of contour integration. We will consider a rectangular contour in the complex plane with vertices at the points A = -R, B = R, C = R + iR, and D = -R + iR, where R is a large positive real number. We will then take the limit as R approaches infinity.\n\nThe integral of the function e^(z/2 - 2πikz) along the contour ABCDA can be split into four integrals along the segments AB, BC, CD, and DA:\n\nF(k) = lim(R→∞) [∫(AB) + ∫(BC) + ∫(CD) + ∫(DA)]\n\nAs R approaches infinity, the integrals along the segments BC and DA vanish, and we are left with the integrals along the segments AB and CD:\n\nF(k) = lim(R→∞) [∫(AB) + ∫(CD)]\n\nNow, we can parametrize the segments AB and CD:\n\nFor AB, let z = x, where -R ≤ x ≤ R. Then dz = dx.\nFor CD, let z = R + iy, where 0 ≤ y ≤ R. Then dz = i dy.\n\nSubstituting these parametrizations into the integrals, we get:\n\nF(k) = lim(R→∞) [∫[-R, R] e^(x/2 - 2πikx) dx + i ∫[0, R] e^((R + iy)/2 - 2πik(R + iy)) dy]\n\nNow, we can evaluate these integrals:\n\n∫[-R, R] e^(x/2 - 2πikx) dx = (1/(1 - 4πik)) * (e^(R(1/2 - 2πik)) - e^(-R(1/2 + 2πik)))\n\n∫[0, R] e^((R + iy)/2 - 2πik(R + iy)) dy = (1/(1 - 4πik)) * (e^(R(1/2 - 2πik)) - 1)\n\nTaking the limit as R approaches infinity, we find that the first integral goes to zero, and the second integral goes to:\n\nF(k) = (1/(1 - 4πik)) * (0 - 1) = -1/(1 - 4πik)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the complex-valued function f(z) = e^(z/2) over the whole complex plane is:\n\nF(k) = -1/(1 - 4πik)"
