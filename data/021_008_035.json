    "message_1": "Consider the system of two nonlinear equations:\n        \n        x^2 + y^2 = 25\n        \n        x^2 - y^2 = 3\n        \nFind an approximate solution of this system using Newton's method.",
    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the given functions with respect to x and y. Let's denote the given functions as:\n\nF(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 25\nG(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 - 3\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n∂G/∂x = 2x\n∂G/∂y = -2y\n\nThe iteration formula for Newton's method for a system of two nonlinear equations is:\n\nx_(n+1) = x_n - (F(x_n, y_n) * ∂G/∂y - G(x_n, y_n) * ∂F/∂y) / ( ∂F/∂x * ∂G/∂y - ∂F/∂y * ∂G/∂x )\ny_(n+1) = y_n - (G(x_n, y_n) * ∂F/∂x - F(x_n, y_n) * ∂G/∂x) / ( ∂F/∂x * ∂G/∂y - ∂F/∂y * ∂G/∂x )\n\nNow, we need an initial guess (x_0, y_0). Since the first equation is a circle with radius 5, we can start with a point on the circle, say (3, 4).\n\nx_0 = 3\ny_0 = 4\n\nNow, we'll apply the iteration formula:\n\nx_1 = x_0 - (F(x_0, y_0) * ∂G/∂y - G(x_0, y_0) * ∂F/∂y) / ( ∂F/∂x * ∂G/∂y - ∂F/∂y * ∂G/∂x )\ny_1 = y_0 - (G(x_0, y_0) * ∂F/∂x - F(x_0, y_0) * ∂G/∂x) / ( ∂F/∂x * ∂G/∂y - ∂F/∂y * ∂G/∂x )\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nF(3, 4) = 3^2 + 4^2 - 25 = 0\nG(3, 4) = 3^2 - 4^2 - 3 = -16\n\n∂F/∂x = 2 * 3 = 6\n∂F/∂y = 2 * 4 = 8\n∂G/∂x = 2 * 3 = 6\n∂G/∂y = -2 * 4 = -8\n\nx_1 = 3 - (0 * -8 - (-16) * 8) / (6 * -8 - 8 * 6) = 3 - (-128) / (-96) = 3 + 4/3 ≈ 4.333\ny_1 = 4 - (-16 * 6 - 0 * 6) / (6 * -8 - 8 * 6) = 4 - (-96) / (-96) = 4 - 1 = 3\n\nSo, our first iteration gives us the approximate solution (x_1, y_1) ≈ (4.333, 3). We can continue iterating to get a more accurate solution, but this should be a reasonable approximation."
