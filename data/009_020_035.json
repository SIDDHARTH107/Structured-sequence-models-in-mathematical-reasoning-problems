    "message_2": "To design a proportional controller $K_p$ for the given system, we first need to find the desired closed-loop pole locations that satisfy the given overshoot and settling time requirements.\n\n1. Settling time ($T_s$) requirement:\nThe settling time is given as 2 seconds. For a second-order system, the settling time can be approximated as:\n\n$$T_s \\approx \\frac{4}{\\zeta \\omega_n}$$\n\nwhere $\\zeta$ is the damping ratio and $\\omega_n$ is the natural frequency of the system.\n\n2. Percentage overshoot ($\\%OS$) requirement:\nThe percentage overshoot is given as 10%. The relationship between overshoot and damping ratio is:\n\n$$\\%OS = 100 \\times e^{\\frac{-\\pi \\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $\\zeta$ and $\\omega_n$ that satisfy these requirements.\n\nFrom the overshoot equation, we can find the damping ratio:\n\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{-\\ln(\\frac{\\%OS}{100})}{\\sqrt{\\pi^2 + \\ln^2(\\frac{\\%OS}{100})}} \\approx 0.591$$\n\nNow, we can find the natural frequency using the settling time equation:\n\n$$\\omega_n = \\frac{4}{\\zeta T_s} \\approx 3.39 \\ rad/s$$\n\nNow that we have the desired closed-loop pole locations, we can use the root locus method to find the value of $K_p$.\n\nThe characteristic equation for the closed-loop system is:\n\n$$1 + K_p G(s) = 0$$\n\n$$1 + K_p \\frac{10}{s(s+1)} = 0$$\n\nThe root locus plot will have branches that start at the open-loop poles (s = 0 and s = -1) and end at the open-loop zeros (none in this case). The angle of departure from the poles can be found using the angle criterion:\n\n$$\\angle G(s) = (2k+1)180^\\circ$$\n\nFor the pole at s = 0, the angle of departure is 180 degrees, and for the pole at s = -1, the angle of departure is 0 degrees. The root locus plot will be a straight line between these two poles.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $K_p$ for which the closed-loop poles lie on the desired locations. The desired closed-loop pole locations are given by:\n\n$$s = -\\zeta \\omega_n \\pm j\\omega_n\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$$\n\n$$s \\approx -1.99 \\pm j2.81$$\n\nUsing the magnitude criterion, we can find the value of $K_p$:\n\n$$|K_p G(s)| = 1$$\n\n$$K_p = \\frac{1}{|G(s)|}$$\n\nSubstitute the desired pole location into the transfer function:\n\n$$K_p = \\frac{1}{|G(-1.99 + j2.81)|} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{10}{(-1.99+j2.81)(-0.99+j2.81)}}$$\n\n$$K_p \\approx 2.15$$\n\nSo, the proportional controller gain $K_p$ that satisfies the given requirements is approximately 2.15. The root locus plot is a straight line between the open-loop poles, and the closed-loop pole locations for this $K_p$ are approximately $s = -1.99 \\pm j2.81$."
