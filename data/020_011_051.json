    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has two production lines, line A and line B. The production rate of line A is 200 units per hour and the production rate of line B is 250 units per hour. The cost of production on line A is $20 per hour and the cost of production on line B is $25 per hour. The company wants to produce at least 3600 units each day while minimizing the total cost of production. How many hours should the company operate each production line to meet the demand while minimizing the total production cost?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of hours line A operates and y be the number of hours line B operates. We have two equations:\n\n1) 200x + 250y >= 3600 (to meet the production demand)\n2) Minimize the cost function C = 20x + 25y\n\nFirst, we need to find the relationship between x and y from equation 1:\n\n200x + 250y >= 3600\ny >= (3600 - 200x) / 250\n\nNow we need to minimize the cost function C = 20x + 25y. Since we want to minimize the cost, we'll look for the smallest integer values of x and y that satisfy the inequality.\n\nWe can start by testing different values of x and finding the corresponding values of y:\n\nx = 0: y >= (3600 - 200*0) / 250 => y >= 14.4\nx = 1: y >= (3600 - 200*1) / 250 => y >= 12\nx = 2: y >= (3600 - 200*2) / 250 => y >= 9.6\nx = 3: y >= (3600 - 200*3) / 250 => y >= 7.2\nx = 4: y >= (3600 - 200*4) / 250 => y >= 4.8\nx = 5: y >= (3600 - 200*5) / 250 => y >= 2.4\nx = 6: y >= (3600 - 200*6) / 250 => y >= 0\n\nFrom the above calculations, we can see that the smallest integer values that satisfy the inequality are x = 6 and y = 0. This means that the company should operate line A for 6 hours and line B for 0 hours to minimize the total production cost.\n\nThe total cost will be C = 20x + 25y = 20*6 + 25*0 = $120."
