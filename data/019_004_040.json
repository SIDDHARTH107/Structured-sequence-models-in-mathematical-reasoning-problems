    "message_1": "A train leaves station A at 8:00 AM and travels to station B at an average speed of 60 km/h. At station B, it waits for 10 minutes and then departs for station C which is 240 km away. The train arrives at station C at 11:00 AM. What was the average speed of the train from station B to station C?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the distance between station A and station B.\n\nThe train traveled from 8:00 AM to the time it reached station B. Since it arrived at station C at 11:00 AM and waited for 10 minutes at station B, it must have reached station B at 10:50 AM. So, the travel time from station A to station B is 2 hours and 50 minutes, or 2.83 hours (2 + 50/60).\n\nNow, we can find the distance between station A and station B using the formula distance = speed × time:\nDistance_AB = 60 km/h × 2.83 h = 169.8 km\n\nNow, let's find the time it took to travel from station B to station C. The train left station B at 11:00 AM - 10 minutes = 10:50 AM and arrived at station C at 11:00 AM. So, the travel time from station B to station C is 10 minutes, or 1/6 hour (10/60).\n\nWe know the distance between station B and station C is 240 km. Now we can find the average speed from station B to station C using the formula speed = distance/time:\nSpeed_BC = 240 km / (1/6 h) = 240 km × 6 = 1440 km/h\n\nSo, the average speed of the train from station B to station C was 1440 km/h."
