    "message_2": "By definition, the complement of a set A, denoted as B, contains all the elements that are not in A. Therefore, there are no elements that are both in A and B simultaneously. The intersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, is the set of all elements that are common to both A and B. Since there are no common elements between A and B, the intersection of A and B is an empty set, denoted as ∅."
