    "message_2": "To find the amplitudes and phases of the sinusoidal components of the given function f(x) = 2sin(3x) + 3cos(6x), we will use the Fourier series representation of the function. Since the function is periodic over the interval [-π, π], we can represent it as a sum of sine and cosine functions with different frequencies.\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and n is an integer representing the frequency of the sinusoidal components.\n\nTo find the Fourier coefficients, we use the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * 1] dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx)] dx from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx)] dx from -π to π\n\nIn our case, f(x) = 2sin(3x) + 3cos(6x). We can see that the function already has the form of a Fourier series with a_0 = 0, a_3 = 0, a_6 = 3, b_3 = 2, and all other coefficients equal to zero.\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = 2sin(3x) + 3cos(6x)\n\nThe amplitudes and phases of the sinusoidal components can be found using the following formulas:\n\nAmplitude_n = sqrt(a_n^2 + b_n^2)\nPhase_n = arctan(-b_n / a_n)\n\nFor n = 3, we have a_3 = 0 and b_3 = 2:\n\nAmplitude_3 = sqrt(0^2 + 2^2) = 2\nPhase_3 = arctan(-2 / 0) = -π/2\n\nFor n = 6, we have a_6 = 3 and b_6 = 0:\n\nAmplitude_6 = sqrt(3^2 + 0^2) = 3\nPhase_6 = arctan(-0 / 3) = 0\n\nSo, the amplitudes and phases of the sinusoidal components of the electromagnetic field are:\n\nAmplitude_3 = 2, Phase_3 = -π/2\nAmplitude_6 = 3, Phase_6 = 0"
