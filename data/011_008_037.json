    "message_2": "Since the balls are identical, we only need to consider the number of balls in each box. We want to distribute 6 identical balls into 3 distinct boxes, with each box containing exactly 2 balls.\n\nThe problem can be represented as:\n\nBox 1: 2 balls\nBox 2: 2 balls\nBox 3: 2 balls\n\nSince the balls are identical and the boxes are distinct, there is only 1 way to arrange the 6 identical balls into the 3 distinct boxes, with each box containing exactly 2 balls."
