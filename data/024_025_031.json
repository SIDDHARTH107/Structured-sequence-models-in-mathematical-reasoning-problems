    "message_1": "Consider a complex manifold $M$ of complex dimension $2$ with a holomorphic line bundle $L$ on it. Let $c_1(L)$ be the first Chern class of $L$. If $c_1(L) = 5a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are some integers, and $5a-b=7$, then find the values of $a$ and $b$.",

Let's denote $k = (c_1(L) + 7) / 10$, where $k$ is an integer. Then:\n\n$a = k$\n$c_1(L) = 10k - 7$\n\nNow, substitute the expression for $a$ into the equation for $b$:\n\n$b = 5k - 7$\n\nWe have found the expressions for $a$ and $b$ in terms of $k$:\n\n$a = k$\n$b = 5k - 7$\n\nTo find the specific values of $a$ and $b$, we need more information about $c_1(L)$. However, we have found a general solution for any given value of $c_1(L)$."
