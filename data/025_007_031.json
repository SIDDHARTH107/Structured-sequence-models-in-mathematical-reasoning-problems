Suppose that $H^0(X, L) \\neq \\{0\\}$ and for all $x \\in X$, $H^i(X, L(-x)) = 0$ for $i > 0$  where $L(-x)$ is the line bundle $L$ twisted by the point $x$. Then prove that $L$ is very ample, i.e., the map $X \\to \\mathbb{P}(H^0(X, L)^*)$ induced by the sections of $L$ is an embedding. \n\nCompute $\\dim H^0(X, L)$.",
    "message_2": "To prove that $L$ is very ample, we need to show that the map $\\phi_L: X \\to \\mathbb{P}(H^0(X, L)^*)$ induced by the sections of $L$ is an embedding. We will show that $\\phi_L$ is both injective and an immersion.\n\nInjectivity: Suppose that $\\phi_L(x) = \\phi_L(y)$ for some $x, y \\in X$. Then, there exists a non-zero section $s \\in H^0(X, L)$ such that $s(x) = s(y) = 0$. But this implies that $s \\in H^0(X, L(-x) \\otimes L(-y))$, which contradicts the assumption that $H^i(X, L(-x)) = 0$ for $i > 0$. Therefore, $\\phi_L$ is injective.\n\nImmersion: Let $x \\in X$. We need to show that the differential $d\\phi_L(x)$ is injective. Consider the exact sequence of sheaves on $X$:\n\n$$0 \\to \\mathcal{I}_x \\to \\mathcal{O}_X \\to \\mathcal{O}_x \\to 0$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{I}_x$ is the ideal sheaf of $x$. Tensoring this sequence with $L$, we get:\n\n$$0 \\to L(-x) \\to L \\to L|_x \\to 0$$\n\nTaking cohomology, we get the long exact sequence:\n\n$$0 \\to H^0(X, L(-x)) \\to H^0(X, L) \\to H^0(x, L|_x) \\to H^1(X, L(-x)) \\to \\cdots$$\n\nBy assumption, $H^0(X, L(-x)) = H^1(X, L(-x)) = 0$. Thus, the map $H^0(X, L) \\to H^0(x, L|_x)$ is an isomorphism. This implies that the differential $d\\phi_L(x)$ is injective, and hence $\\phi_L$ is an immersion.\n\nSince $\\phi_L$ is both injective and an immersion, it is an embedding. Therefore, $L$ is very ample.\n\nNow, let's compute $\\dim H^0(X, L)$. Since $L$ is very ample, we have an embedding $X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{P}(H^0(X, L)^*)$. Let $n = \\dim X$. By the theorem of BÃ©zout, the degree of the image of $X$ in $\\mathbb{P}(H^0(X, L)^*)$ is equal to the degree of the dual variety, which is the number of hyperplane sections of $X$ in general position. This number is given by the intersection number $L^n$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$\\dim H^0(X, L) = \\deg \\phi_L(X) + 1 = L^n + 1$$"
