    "message_2": "To find the expected number of accidents, we can multiply the probability of an accident by the number of cars passing on the road. \n\nExpected number of accidents = Probability of an accident × Number of cars\nExpected number of accidents = 0.25 × 200\nExpected number of accidents = 50\n\nSo, the expected number of accidents that will occur during rush hour on that road is 50."
