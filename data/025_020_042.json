    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the Calabi-Yau variety given by the equation $y^2z + yz^2 + x^3 = 0$, we first compute the partial derivatives with respect to each variable:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = 3x^2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} = 2yz + z^2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = y^2 + 2yz.\n$$\n\nA singular point occurs when all partial derivatives are simultaneously zero. Thus, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$$\n3x^2 = 0, \\quad 2yz + z^2 = 0, \\quad y^2 + 2yz = 0.\n$$\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $x = 0$. Substituting this into the other two equations, we get:\n\n$$\n2yz + z^2 = 0, \\quad y^2 + 2yz = 0.\n$$\n\nNow, we can factor out a $z$ from the first equation to get $z(2y + z) = 0$. This gives us two cases:\n\n1. $z = 0$: In this case, the second equation becomes $y^2 = 0$, which implies $y = 0$. Thus, we have the singular point $(0, 0, 0)$.\n\n2. $2y + z = 0$: In this case, the second equation becomes $y^2 + 2y(-y) = 0$, which simplifies to $y^2 - 2y^2 = -y^2 = 0$. This implies $y = 0$, and from the equation $2y + z = 0$, we get $z = 0$. However, this leads us back to the point $(0, 0, 0)$, which we already found.\n\nTherefore, the only singular point of the Calabi-Yau variety is $(0, 0, 0)$.\n\nTo determine the type of the singular point, we compute the Hessian matrix of the second derivatives:\n\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial z} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y \\partial z} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z \\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n6x & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2z & 2y + 2z \\\\\n0 & 2y + 2z & 2y\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nEvaluating the Hessian matrix at the singular point $(0, 0, 0)$, we get:\n\n$$\nH(0, 0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nSince the Hessian matrix is identically zero at the singular point, we cannot determine the type of the singular point using the Hessian. However, we can still analyze the equation of the Calabi-Yau variety near the singular point. The equation $y^2z + yz^2 + x^3 = 0$ can be rewritten as $x^3 = -y^2z - yz^2$. Near the singular point, the term $x^3$ dominates, so the variety behaves like a cone with a singularity at the vertex. Thus, the singular point $(0, 0, 0)$ is a conical singularity."
