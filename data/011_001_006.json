    "message_2": "To form a committee of 3 people from a group of 7 people, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (7 in this case), k is the number of people to choose (3 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nUsing the combination formula, we can calculate the number of ways to form the committee:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!)\n= 7! / (3!4!)\n= (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n= (7 × 6 × 5) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n= 210 / 6\n= 35\n\nSo there are 35 ways to form a committee of 3 people from a group of 7 people."
