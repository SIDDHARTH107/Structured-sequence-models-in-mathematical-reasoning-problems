    "message_1": "A clothing store owner wants to predict the probability of a customer who enters their store purchasing a pair of shoes. In the past month, 120 customers have entered the store and 60 of them have purchased shoes. What is the probability of a customer who enters the store purchasing a pair of shoes? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a customer purchasing a pair of shoes, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the successful outcome is a customer purchasing a pair of shoes, and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of customers who entered the store.\n\nProbability = (Number of customers who purchased shoes) / (Total number of customers)\n\nProbability = 60 / 120\n\nProbability = 0.5\n\nTo express the probability as a percentage and round to two decimal places, we can multiply by 100:\n\nProbability = 0.5 * 100 = 50.00%\n\nSo, the probability of a customer who enters the store purchasing a pair of shoes is 50.00%."
