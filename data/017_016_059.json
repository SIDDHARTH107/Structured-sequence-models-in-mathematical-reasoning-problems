    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 27, we can use the fact that 27 = 3^3. According to the Sylow theorems and the classification of finite abelian groups, the number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer, is equal to the number of partitions of n.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 3, and the partitions of 3 are:\n\n1. 3\n2. 2 + 1\n3. 1 + 1 + 1\n\nThese partitions correspond to the following non-isomorphic groups of order 27:\n\n1. C_27 (cyclic group of order 27)\n2. C_9 × C_3 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 3)\n3. C_3 × C_3 × C_3 (direct product of three cyclic groups of order 3)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 27."
