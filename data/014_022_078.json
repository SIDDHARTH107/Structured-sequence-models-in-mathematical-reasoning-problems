    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext message \"ATTACK AT DAWN\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid using the key and the English alphabet (excluding 'J' since it's combined with 'I' in the Playfair cipher).\n   Key: CRYPTOGRAPHY\n   Remove duplicate letters: CRYPTOAGH\n   Fill the grid:\n      C R Y P T\n      O A G H B\n      D E F I K\n      L M N S U\n      V W X Z Q\n\n2. Split the plaintext message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them and continue splitting.\n   Plaintext: ATTACK AT DAWN\n   Digraphs: AT TX AC KA TD AW NX\n\n3. Encrypt each digraph using the Playfair grid:\n   - AT: (1,0)(1,1) -> (1,1)(1,0) -> RO\n   - TX: (0,4)(2,3) -> (0,3)(2,4) -> PI\n   - AC: (0,1)(2,0) -> (0,0)(2,1) -> CR\n   - KA: (1,4)(1,1) -> (1,1)(1,4) -> OY\n   - TD: (0,3)(3,2) -> (0,2)(3,3) -> FN\n   - AW: (1,2)(4,0) -> (1,0)(4,2) -> TV\n   - NX: (3,4)(4,4) -> (3,3)(4,3) -> SU\n\n4. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the ciphertext:\n   Ciphertext: ROPICROYFNTVSU\n\nSo, the Playfair cipher equivalent of the plaintext message \"ATTACK AT DAWN\" using the key \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\" is \"ROPICROYFNTVSU\"."
