If $u(x,y) = \\cos(x)\\sinh(y)$ satisfies the above equation, find the general solution of the partial differential equation in terms of $u(x,y)$.",
    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given partial differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into the given PDE, we get:\n\n$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$\n\nSince the left-hand side is a function of $x$ and the right-hand side is a function of $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2 - \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0$\n\n2) $Y''(y) - k^2Y(y) = 0$\n\nThe general solutions for these ODEs are:\n\n1) $X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$\n\n2) $Y(y) = C\\cosh(ky) + D\\sinh(ky)$\n\nNow, the general solution for the PDE is the product of these two solutions:\n\n$u(x, y) = (A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx))(C\\cosh(ky) + D\\sinh(ky))$\n\nSince the given solution $u(x, y) = \\cos(x)\\sinh(y)$ satisfies the PDE, we can choose $A = 1$, $B = 0$, $C = 0$, $D = 1$, and $k = 1$. However, the general solution includes all possible values of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $k$."
