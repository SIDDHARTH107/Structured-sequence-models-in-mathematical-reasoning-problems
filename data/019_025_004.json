    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem related to Causal logic:\n\nSuppose a research study found that students who study for longer hours tend to score better grades on tests. If John studied for 10 hours and scored 85%, and Mark studied for 8 hours, what would be his expected score if we assume that the relationship between study hours and test scores is causal?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between study hours and test scores. Since we don't have enough data to determine the exact relationship, we can only make an estimation based on the information provided.\n\nLet's assume that the relationship between study hours and test scores is linear. We can use John's data as a reference point to estimate the relationship.\n\nJohn studied for 10 hours and scored 85%. Let's assume that every additional hour of study increases the test score by a constant percentage, which we will call 'x'. \n\nSo, for Mark who studied for 8 hours, we need to find the expected score by subtracting the effect of 2 hours (10 hours - 8 hours) from John's score.\n\nLet's set up an equation:\n\n85% - 2 * x = Mark's expected score\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have enough information to find the exact value of 'x'. However, we can provide a general formula for Mark's expected score based on the unknown 'x':\n\nMark's expected score = 85% - 2 * x\n\nWithout more data points or information about the relationship between study hours and test scores, we cannot provide a specific expected score for Mark."
