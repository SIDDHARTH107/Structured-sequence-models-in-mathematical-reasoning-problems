    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to exactly one of the following groups: C8, Q8, or D4, we will use the Sylow theorems and the properties of groups of order 8.\n\nFirst, note that 8 = 2^3, so by the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_2, must divide the order of G and satisfy n_2 â‰¡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIf there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let P be this normal 2-Sylow subgroup. Since the order of P is 8, P is isomorphic to C8, the cyclic group of order 8. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C8.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 4\nIf there are four 2-Sylow subgroups, each of them has order 4. Let P be one of these 2-Sylow subgroups. Since the order of P is 4, P is either isomorphic to C4 (the cyclic group of order 4) or V4 (the Klein four-group).\n\nCase 2.1: P is isomorphic to C4\nLet a be a generator of P, so P = {1, a, a^2, a^3}. Since G has order 8, there must be an element b in G that is not in P. Consider the subgroup H generated by a^2 and b. The order of H is at least 4 since it contains P as a subgroup. Moreover, the order of H divides the order of G, which is 8. Thus, the order of H is either 4 or 8. If the order of H is 8, then G = H, which implies that G is cyclic, contradicting the assumption that n_2 = 4. Therefore, the order of H must be 4.\n\nNow, consider the element ab. Since ab is not in P or H, it must generate a new 2-Sylow subgroup. Moreover, since a and b have order 4 and 2, respectively, (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = a^2. Thus, the order of ab is 4. Therefore, G is generated by a and ab, and G is isomorphic to D4, the dihedral group of order 8.\n\nCase 2.2: P is isomorphic to V4\nLet P = {1, a, b, c}, where a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = 1 and ab = c. Since G has order 8, there must be an element d in G that is not in P. Consider the element ad. Since a and d have order 2, (ad)^2 = a^2d^2 = 1. Thus, the order of ad is 2. Moreover, since ad is not in P, it must generate a new 2-Sylow subgroup. However, this contradicts the assumption that there are only four 2-Sylow subgroups in G. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to exactly one of the following groups: C8, Q8, or D4."
