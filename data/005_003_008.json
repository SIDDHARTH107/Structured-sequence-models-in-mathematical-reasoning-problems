    "message_1": "A real estate agent wants to predict the selling price of houses based on their size (in square feet). She collected data on the size and selling price of 10 different houses, and ran a simple linear regression analysis. The results of the analysis were:\n\n- The regression equation is: Y = 32000 + 95X\n- The sample size is n = 10\n- The coefficient of determination is r^2 = 0.90\n\nBased on this information, what is the estimated selling price for a house that is 1500 square feet in size?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the selling price for a house that is 1500 square feet in size, we can use the regression equation provided:\n\nY = 32000 + 95X\n\nHere, X represents the size of the house in square feet. We are given that the house is 1500 square feet, so we can plug this value into the equation:\n\nY = 32000 + 95(1500)\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of Y, which represents the estimated selling price:\n\nY = 32000 + 142500\n\nY = 174500\n\nSo, the estimated selling price for a house that is 1500 square feet in size is $174,500."
