    "message_2": "The next even perfect number after 28 is 496.\n\nA perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). For even perfect numbers, they can be represented by the formula 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1), where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers. This formula is derived from the work of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid.\n\nFor the perfect number 28, the formula is 2^(2-1) * (2^2 - 1) = 4 * 7.\n\nTo find the next even perfect number, we need to find the next pair of prime numbers (p, 2^p - 1) that satisfy the formula. The next prime number after 2 is 3. Plugging it into the formula, we get 2^(3-1) * (2^3 - 1) = 4 * 7, which is still 28.\n\nThe next prime number is 5. Plugging it into the formula, we get 2^(5-1) * (2^5 - 1) = 16 * 31 = 496. Therefore, the next even perfect number after 28 is 496."
