    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos(2x + 30°) = 0.5, we first need to find the angle whose cosine is 0.5. \n\nRecall that cos(60°) = 0.5 and cos(300°) = 0.5. Since the cosine function has a period of 360°, we can write the general solution for the angles as:\n\nθ = 60° + 360°n and θ = 300° + 360°n, where n is an integer.\n\nNow, we have the equation cos(2x + 30°) = 0.5. We can set 2x + 30° equal to each of the general solutions we found above:\n\n2x + 30° = 60° + 360°n\n2x + 30° = 300° + 360°n\n\nNow, we solve each equation for x:\n\nFor the first equation:\n2x = 30° + 360°n\nx = 15° + 180°n\n\nFor the second equation:\n2x = 270° + 360°n\nx = 135° + 180°n\n\nSo, the general solutions for x are:\n\nx = 15° + 180°n and x = 135° + 180°n, where n is an integer."
