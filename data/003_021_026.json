    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors A and B, we can use the formula for the dot product:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nWe are given the magnitudes |A| = 10 and |B| = 8, and the dot product A · B = 40. We can plug these values into the formula and solve for the angle θ:\n\n40 = 10 * 8 * cos(θ)\n\nNow, we can simplify and solve for cos(θ):\n\n40 = 80 * cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = 40 / 80\n\ncos(θ) = 1/2\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 1/2:\n\nθ = arccos(1/2)\n\nθ ≈ 60°\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors A and B is approximately 60 degrees."
