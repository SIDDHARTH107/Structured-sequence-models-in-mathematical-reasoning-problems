    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 1, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 1, we have:\n\nAntiderivative of 3x^2: (3/3)x^(2+1) = x^3\nAntiderivative of 4x: (4/2)x^(1+1) = 2x^2\nAntiderivative of -1: -1x^(0+1) = -1x\n\nSo, the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 1 is:\n\nF(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - x + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration."
