    "message_1": "A city has an initial population of 5000 and its population grows at a rate of 3% per year. Create a differential equation to model the population growth and use it to find the population after 10 years.",
    "message_2": "To create a differential equation to model the population growth, we can use the formula:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere dP/dt is the rate of change of the population with respect to time, k is the growth rate, and P is the population at a given time.\n\nIn this case, the growth rate k is 3% per year, which can be written as 0.03.\n\nSo, the differential equation is:\n\ndP/dt = 0.03P\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\ndP/P = 0.03 dt\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides of the equation:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫0.03 dt\n\nThe integral of 1/P with respect to P is ln|P|, and the integral of 0.03 with respect to t is 0.03t. So, we have:\n\nln|P| = 0.03t + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. To find the value of C, we can use the initial condition that the population is 5000 when t = 0:\n\nln|5000| = 0.03(0) + C\nln|5000| = C\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in terms of P:\n\nP(t) = e^(0.03t + ln|5000|)\n\nUsing the property of exponents, we can simplify the equation to:\n\nP(t) = e^(0.03t) * e^(ln|5000|)\nP(t) = 5000 * e^(0.03t)\n\nNow, we can find the population after 10 years by plugging t = 10 into the equation:\n\nP(10) = 5000 * e^(0.03 * 10)\nP(10) ≈ 5000 * e^0.3\nP(10) ≈ 5000 * 1.34986\nP(10) ≈ 6749.3\n\nSo, the population after 10 years is approximately 6749."
