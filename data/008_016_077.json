    "message_2": "The Jacobi iterative method is an iterative technique used to solve systems of linear equations. It works by updating each variable's value based on the previous iteration's values. The method can be represented as follows:\n\nx = (1/a_11) * (b_1 - a_12*y - a_13*z)\ny = (1/a_22) * (b_2 - a_21*x - a_23*z)\nz = (1/a_33) * (b_3 - a_31*x - a_32*y)\n\nGiven the system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y + z = 7\nx + 4y - z = -6\n3x - y + 6z = 26\n\nWe can rewrite the equations in the form required for the Jacobi iterative method:\n\nx = (1/2) * (7 - 3y - z)\ny = (1/4) * (-6 - x + z)\nz = (1/6) * (26 - 3x + y)\n\nNow, we will perform 3 iterations using the initial estimates (x0, y0, z0) = (0, 0, 0).\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = (1/2) * (7 - 3*0 - 0) = 3.5\ny1 = (1/4) * (-6 - 0 + 0) = -1.5\nz1 = (1/6) * (26 - 3*0 + 0) = 4.3333\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = (1/2) * (7 - 3*(-1.5) - 4.3333) = 1.5833\ny2 = (1/4) * (-6 - 3.5 + 4.3333) = -0.5417\nz2 = (1/6) * (26 - 3*1.5833 + (-1.5)) = 3.75\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = (1/2) * (7 - 3*(-0.5417) - 3.75) = 2.1458\ny3 = (1/4) * (-6 - 1.5833 + 3.75) = -0.9583\nz3 = (1/6) * (26 - 3*2.1458 + (-0.5417)) = 3.9236\n\nAfter 3 iterations, the approximate solution is (x, y, z) = (2.1458, -0.9583, 3.9236). Note that the Jacobi iterative method may require more iterations to converge to the exact solution, and the convergence depends on the properties of the given system of linear equations."
