So, AxB = {(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3), (6,1), (6,3)}.\n\nAxC is the set of all ordered pairs (a, c) where a is in A and c is in C. So, AxC = {(2,5), (4,5), (6,5)}.\n\nNow, we find the union of these two sets, which is the set of all elements that are in either AxB or AxC. \n\n(AxB) ∪ (AxC) = {(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3), (6,1), (6,3), (2,5), (4,5), (6,5)}."
