    "message_2": "Suppose there exists a group G of order 18 that is isomorphic to a direct product of a cyclic group of order 6 and a cyclic group of order 3. Let's denote these cyclic groups as C_6 and C_3, respectively. Then, G is isomorphic to C_6 × C_3.\n\nThe order of G is 18, which is the product of the orders of C_6 and C_3 (6 and 3, respectively). According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G can be expressed as a direct product of its Sylow subgroups.\n\nLet P be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G and Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then, the orders of P and Q are 3 and 9, respectively, since 18 = 2 * 9 = 3 * 6. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G is 1 (mod 3) and divides 6, so it can be either 1 or 6. Similarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G is 1 (mod 2) and divides 9, so it can be either 1 or 9.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of G. Since G is isomorphic to C_6 × C_3, it has an element of order 6 and an element of order 3. The element of order 6 generates a cyclic subgroup of order 6, which contains an element of order 2 and an element of order 3. Therefore, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup (generated by the element of order 3) and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup (generated by the element of order 2).\n\nHowever, this contradicts the possible number of Sylow subgroups we found earlier. If G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, then the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must be 1, but we found that it could also be 6. Similarly, if G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, then the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must be 1, but we found that it could also be 9.\n\nThis contradiction implies that there cannot exist a group G of order 18 that is isomorphic to a direct product of a cyclic group of order 6 and a cyclic group of order 3."
