    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1, we need to find the second derivative of the function and then solve for x when the second derivative is equal to 0.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9)\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we need to find the x-values when f''(x) = 0:\n6x - 12 = 0\n\nAdd 12 to both sides:\n6x = 12\n\nDivide by 6:\nx = 2\n\nSo, there is an inflection point at x = 2."
