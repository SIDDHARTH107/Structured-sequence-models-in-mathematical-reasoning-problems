    "message_2": "First, we need to create a 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key \"CRYPTOLOGY\". Remove duplicate letters from the key and fill in the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding \"J\", which is usually combined with \"I\" in the Playfair cipher).\n\nThe matrix will look like this:\n\nC R Y P T\nO L G A B\nD E F H I\nK M N Q S\nU V W X Z\n\nNow, we will encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n1. If both letters are the same, add an \"X\" between them (or a \"Q\" if the repeated letter is \"X\").\n2. If the letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrapping around to the beginning of the row if necessary).\n3. If the letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrapping around to the top of the column if necessary).\n4. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\nThe message \"MATHEMATICS\" is broken into pairs: MA TH EM AT IC SX (we added an \"X\" at the end since we need an even number of letters).\n\nNow, we apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n\nMA -> OD\nTH -> YD\nEM -> RF\nAT -> YO\nIC -> KS\nSX -> ZB\n\nThe encrypted message is: ODYDRFYOKSZB"
