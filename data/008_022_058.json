    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  3  1 | 10 ]\n[ 4  2  3 | 15 ]\n[ 6  7  5 | 23 ]\n```\n\nNext, we perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Divide the first row by 2:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5  0.5 |  5 ]\n[ 4  2    3  | 15 ]\n[ 6  7    5  | 23 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace the second row with (-4 * first row + second row) and the third row with (-6 * first row + third row):\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5  0.5 |  5 ]\n[ 0 -4   1   | -5 ]\n[ 0  2   2   | -7 ]\n```\n\n3. Divide the second row by -4:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5  0.5 |  5 ]\n[ 0  1  -0.25 |  1.25 ]\n[ 0  2   2   | -7 ]\n```\n\n4. Replace the first row with (-1.5 * second row + first row) and the third row with (-2 * second row + third row):\n\n```\n[ 1  0  0.875 |  3.125 ]\n[ 0  1 -0.25  |  1.25 ]\n[ 0  0  2.5   | -10 ]\n```\n\n5. Divide the third row by 2.5:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  0.875 |  3.125 ]\n[ 0  1 -0.25  |  1.25 ]\n[ 0  0  1     | -4 ]\n```\n\n6. Replace the first row with (-0.875 * third row + first row) and the second row with (0.25 * third row + second row):\n\n```\n[ 1  0  0 |  6.5 ]\n[ 0  1  0 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | -4 ]\n```\n\nThe system of linear equations is now in row-echelon form, and we can read the solution directly: x = 6.5, y = 2, and z = -4.\n\nNow, let's determine whether the matrix is well-conditioned or ill-conditioned. To do this, we calculate the condition number of the matrix. The condition number is the product of the matrix's norm and its inverse's norm. A matrix with a condition number close to 1 is considered well-conditioned, while a matrix with a large condition number is considered ill-conditioned.\n\nFirst, let's find the inverse of the matrix:\n\nA = \n```\n[ 2  3  1 ]\n[ 4  2  3 ]\n[ 6  7  5 ]\n```\n\nUsing a matrix calculator or software, we find the inverse of A:\n\nA^(-1) = \n```\n[  0.5   0.5  -0.5 ]\n[ -1.5   1.5   0.5 ]\n[  2    -1    -0.5 ]\n```\n\nNow, let's calculate the norms of A and A^(-1). We will use the infinity norm, which is the maximum absolute row sum of a matrix:\n\n||A||∞ = max(2 + 3 + 1, 4 + 2 + 3, 6 + 7 + 5) = max(6, 9, 18) = 18\n\n||A^(-1)||∞ = max(0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5, 1.5 + 1.5 + 0.5, 2 + 1 + 0.5) = max(1.5, 3.5, 3.5) = 3.5\n\nFinally, we calculate the condition number:\n\ncond(A) = ||A||∞ * ||A^(-1)||∞ = 18 * 3.5 = 63\n\nSince the condition number is not close to 1, the matrix is considered ill-conditioned. This means that the system of linear equations is sensitive to small changes in the input data, and the solution may not be very accurate. However, in this case, we were still able to find a unique solution for the system."
