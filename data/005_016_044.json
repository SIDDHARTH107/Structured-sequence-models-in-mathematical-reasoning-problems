A group of math students were asked to evaluate each brand based on different criteria such as processing speed, battery life, graphics quality, and storage capacity. Using discriminant analysis, determine which brand of laptop is preferred by the majority of math students based on the following scores:\n\n| Brand | Processing Speed | Battery Life | Graphics Quality | Storage Capacity |\n|-------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|\n| A     | 8               | 10            | 4                | 6                |\n| B     | 6               | 9             | 6                | 8                |\n| C     | 4               | 6             | 10               | 4                |\n| D     | 10              | 8             | 2                | 10               | \n\nWhat brand of laptop is preferred by the majority of math students?",
    "message_2": "To determine the preferred brand of laptop using discriminant analysis, we first need to standardize the scores for each criterion. We can do this by calculating the mean and standard deviation for each criterion and then converting the scores to z-scores.\n\nProcessing Speed:\nMean = (8 + 6 + 4 + 10) / 4 = 7\nStandard Deviation = √[((8-7)^2 + (6-7)^2 + (4-7)^2 + (10-7)^2) / 4] = √6\n\nBattery Life:\nMean = (10 + 9 + 6 + 8) / 4 = 8.25\nStandard Deviation = √[((10-8.25)^2 + (9-8.25)^2 + (6-8.25)^2 + (8-8.25)^2) / 4] = 1.5\n\nGraphics Quality:\nMean = (4 + 6 + 10 + 2) / 4 = 5.5\nStandard Deviation = √[((4-5.5)^2 + (6-5.5)^2 + (10-5.5)^2 + (2-5.5)^2) / 4] = 2.5\n\nStorage Capacity:\nMean = (6 + 8 + 4 + 10) / 4 = 7\nStandard Deviation = √[((6-7)^2 + (8-7)^2 + (4-7)^2 + (10-7)^2) / 4] = 2\n\nNow, we can calculate the z-scores for each brand:\n\n| Brand | Processing Speed | Battery Life | Graphics Quality | Storage Capacity |\n|-------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|\n| A     | (8-7)/√6         | (10-8.25)/1.5 | (4-5.5)/2.5       | (6-7)/2          |\n| B     | (6-7)/√6         | (9-8.25)/1.5  | (6-5.5)/2.5       | (8-7)/2          |\n| C     | (4-7)/√6         | (6-8.25)/1.5  | (10-5.5)/2.5      | (4-7)/2          |\n| D     | (10-7)/√6        | (8-8.25)/1.5  | (2-5.5)/2.5       | (10-7)/2         |\n\n| Brand | Processing Speed | Battery Life | Graphics Quality | Storage Capacity |\n|-------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|\n| A     | 0.408           | 1.167        | -0.6             | -0.5             |\n| B     | -0.408          | 0.5          | 0.2              | 0.5              |\n| C     | -1.225          | -1.5         | 1.8              | -1.5             |\n| D     | 1.225           | -0.167       | -1.4             | 1.5              |\n\nNow, we can calculate the discriminant score for each brand by summing the z-scores:\n\n| Brand | Discriminant Score |\n|-------|--------------------|\n| A     | 0.475              |\n| B     | 0.792              |\n| C     | -1.425             |\n| D     | 1.158              |\n\nBased on the discriminant scores, the majority of math students prefer Brand B, as it has the highest discriminant score."
