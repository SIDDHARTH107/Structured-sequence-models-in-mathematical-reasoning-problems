    "message_1": "Consider the equilateral triangle with sides of length 6. Divide the triangle into 4 congruent smaller triangles by drawing one line from the midpoint of each side to the opposite vertex. How many total edges are in the resulting triangulation?",
    "message_2": "In the resulting triangulation, we have the 3 original edges of the equilateral triangle, and we have added 3 new edges by drawing lines from the midpoint of each side to the opposite vertex. So, there are a total of 3 + 3 = 6 edges."
