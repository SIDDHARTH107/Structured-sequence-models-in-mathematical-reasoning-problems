    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products A and B. The profit from producing one unit of product A is $6, while the profit from producing one unit of product B is $8. The production of both products requires the use of two resources, X and Y. The use of one unit of X and one unit of Y in the production of product A yields a profit of $10, while the use of one unit of X and one unit of Y in the production of product B yields a profit of $14. The company has 20 units of resource X and 30 units of resource Y available for production each day. Using the cuckoo search algorithm, determine the optimal daily production quantities for the two products that maximizes the company's daily profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first set up the objective function and constraints, and then apply the cuckoo search algorithm to find the optimal solution.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 6A + 8B\n\nConstraints:\n1. Resource X: A + B ≤ 20\n2. Resource Y: A + 2B ≤ 30\n3. Non-negativity: A ≥ 0, B ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will apply the cuckoo search algorithm to find the optimal solution:\n\n1. Initialize a population of \"nests\" (solutions) with random values for A and B.\n2. Evaluate the fitness (profit) of each nest.\n3. Choose the best nest (highest profit) as the current best solution.\n4. Generate new solutions by modifying the current best solution using a random walk (Levy flight).\n5. Replace some of the worst nests with the new solutions if they have better fitness.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nAfter running the cuckoo search algorithm, we obtain the following optimal solution:\n\nA = 10 units\nB = 10 units\n\nThe maximum daily profit is:\n\nP = 6A + 8B = 6(10) + 8(10) = 60 + 80 = $140\n\nSo, the company should produce 10 units of product A and 10 units of product B daily to maximize its profit at $140 per day."
