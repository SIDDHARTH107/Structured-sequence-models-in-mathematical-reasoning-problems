    "message_1": "Here's an example problem:\n\nIn a group of 4 individuals, John and Sarah are out hunting separately, while Tom and Kevin are out hunting together. Each person can choose to hunt either a stag or a hare. If John and Sarah both hunt a stag, they will each catch one and have a combined total payout of 6 units. If they both hunt a hare, they will each catch one and have a combined total payout of 2 units. If Tom and Kevin hunt a stag, they will each catch one and have a combined total payout of 8 units. If they both hunt a hare, they will each catch one and have a combined total payout of 2 units. \n\nAssuming each person is rational and wants to maximize their individual payout, what should each person choose to hunt and what would be the total payout of the group?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their individual payouts, John and Sarah should both choose to hunt a stag, as this will give them a combined total payout of 6 units. Since they are hunting separately, they will each receive a payout of 3 units (6 units / 2 people).\n\nTom and Kevin, who are hunting together, should also choose to hunt a stag, as this will give them a combined total payout of 8 units. Since they are hunting together, they will each receive a payout of 4 units (8 units / 2 people).\n\nTherefore, John and Sarah will each hunt a stag, and Tom and Kevin will also each hunt a stag. The total payout for the group will be 14 units (6 units from John and Sarah + 8 units from Tom and Kevin)."
