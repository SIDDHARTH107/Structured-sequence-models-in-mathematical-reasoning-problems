    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the system of linear equations:\n\n    | 1  1  1 | 6\n    | 2  3  4 | 16\n    | 4  5  6 | 22.5\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 4 times the first row from the third row:\n\n    | 1  1   1  |  6\n    | 0  1   2  |  4\n    | 0  1   2  |  3\n\nStep 2: Subtract the second row from the third row:\n\n    | 1  1   1  |  6\n    | 0  1   2  |  4\n    | 0  0   0  | -1\n\nAt this point, we have a contradiction in the third row (0 = -1), which means the system of linear equations has no solution.\n\nTo determine if the matrix is ill-conditioned, we can calculate the condition number. The condition number is the product of the matrix's norm and its inverse's norm. If the condition number is large, the matrix is considered ill-conditioned.\n\nHowever, since the matrix is singular (i.e., it does not have an inverse), we cannot calculate the condition number. In this case, we can say that the matrix is ill-conditioned because it does not have a unique solution."
