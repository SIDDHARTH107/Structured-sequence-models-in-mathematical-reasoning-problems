    "message_2": "The y-intercept of a line is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. At this point, the x-coordinate is 0. To find the y-intercept, substitute x = 0 into the equation of the line:\n\ny = 3(0) + 4\ny = 0 + 4\ny = 4\n\nSo, the y-intercept of the line is 4, or the point (0, 4)."
