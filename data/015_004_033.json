    "message_2": "The area of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set can be found using the formula:\n\nArea = (π/4) * (2 - √2)\n\nCalculating the area:\n\nArea ≈ (3.14159/4) * (2 - 1.41421)\nArea ≈ 0.785398 * 0.58579\nArea ≈ 0.459697\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the area of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is approximately 0.46."
