    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors using the trigonometric method, we first need to find the magnitudes of the vectors and the angle between them.\n\nThe magnitude of a vector a = 2i + 3j - 4k is given by:\n\n|a| = √(2^2 + 3^2 + (-4)^2) = √(4 + 9 + 16) = √29\n\nThe magnitude of a vector b = 5i - 2j + 6k is given by:\n\n|b| = √(5^2 + (-2)^2 + 6^2) = √(25 + 4 + 36) = √65\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the dot product formula:\n\na · b = |a| * |b| * cos(θ)\n\nThe dot product of a and b is:\n\na · b = (2 * 5) + (3 * -2) + (-4 * 6) = 10 - 6 - 24 = -20\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (a · b) / (|a| * |b|)\ncos(θ) = -20 / (√29 * √65)\n\nθ = arccos(-20 / (√29 * √65))\n\nNow, we can find the cross product of a and b using the trigonometric method:\n\na x b = |a| * |b| * sin(θ) * n\n\nwhere n is the unit vector perpendicular to both a and b.\n\nFirst, we need to find sin(θ):\n\nsin(θ) = √(1 - cos^2(θ))\nsin(θ) = √(1 - (-20 / (√29 * √65))^2)\n\nNext, we need to find the unit vector n. We can use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of n. The cross product a x b will be perpendicular to both a and b, and its direction can be found using the right-hand rule:\n\nn = (3 * 6 - (-4) * (-2))i - (2 * 6 - 5 * (-4))j + (2 * (-2) - 5 * 3)k\nn = (18 - 8)i - (12 + 20)j + (-4 - 15)k\nn = 10i - 32j - 19k\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of n:\n\n|n| = √(10^2 + (-32)^2 + (-19)^2) = √(100 + 1024 + 361) = √1485\n\nThe unit vector n is:\n\nn_unit = (10/√1485)i - (32/√1485)j - (19/√1485)k\n\nFinally, we can find the cross product a x b:\n\na x b = |a| * |b| * sin(θ) * n_unit\na x b = (√29 * √65 * sin(θ)) * (10/√1485)i - (32/√1485)j - (19/√1485)k\n\nNow, you can plug in the value of sin(θ) that we found earlier and compute the cross product a x b."
