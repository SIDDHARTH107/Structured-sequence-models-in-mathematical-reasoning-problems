    "message_2": "To calculate the dimension of $H$, we first need to find the dimension of the space of all degree $4$ curves in the complex projective plane, and then subtract the dimension of the space of singular curves.\n\nA degree $4$ curve in the complex projective plane can be represented by a homogeneous polynomial of degree $4$ in three variables, say $x, y, z$. The number of monomials of degree $4$ in these three variables is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{6}{2} = 15$. So, the space of all degree $4$ curves is a complex projective space $\\mathbb{P}^{14}$, which has dimension $14$.\n\nNow, we need to find the dimension of the space of singular curves. A curve is singular if and only if its partial derivatives with respect to $x, y, z$ have a common zero (other than the trivial zero). Let $F(x, y, z)$ be the homogeneous polynomial representing the curve. Then, the curve is singular if and only if there exists a non-zero point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ such that:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(x_0, y_0, z_0) = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(x_0, y_0, z_0) = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z}(x_0, y_0, z_0) = 0$$\n\nThis condition defines a projective variety in $\\mathbb{P}^{14}$. The codimension of this variety can be computed using the method of resultants. In this case, the codimension turns out to be $3$. Therefore, the dimension of the space of singular curves is $14 - 3 = 11$.\n\nFinally, the dimension of the space of smooth curves, which is the complement of the space of singular curves in the space of all degree $4$ curves, is given by:\n\n$$\\dim H = \\dim \\mathcal{M}_3 - \\dim \\text{ Singular Curves} = 14 - 11 = 3$$\n\nSo, the dimension of $H$ is $3$."
