    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) - ({2, 3})\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B ∆ A. \n\nB ∆ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = ({2, 3, 4} ∪ {1, 2, 3}) - ({2, 3})\nB ∆ A = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNotice that A ∆ B = B ∆ A, which means the symmetric difference is commutative.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A ∆ B) with B, denoted as (A ∆ B) ∩ B.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4} = {4}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of (B ∆ A) with A, denoted as (B ∆ A) ∩ A.\n\n(B ∆ A) ∩ A = {1, 4} ∩ {1, 2, 3} = {1}\n\nWe can see that (A ∆ B) ∩ B = {4} and (B ∆ A) ∩ A = {1}. Since these two sets are not equal, this demonstrates that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
