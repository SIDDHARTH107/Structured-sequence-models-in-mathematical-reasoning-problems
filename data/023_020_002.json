    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of the given function f(x) = x / (1 - x^2) for -1 < x < 1, we need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n.\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = (a_0 / 2) + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the period of the function, a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor the given function, the period is 2, so L = 1.\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n.\n\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L)] dx from -L to L\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)] dx from -L to L\n\nFor the given function f(x) = x / (1 - x^2), we have:\n\na_n = ∫[x * cos(nπx) / (1 - x^2)] dx from -1 to 1\nb_n = ∫[x * sin(nπx) / (1 - x^2)] dx from -1 to 1\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function, its cosine terms will be zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = ∫[x * sin(nπx) / (1 - x^2)] dx from -1 to 1\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = sin(nπx) / (1 - x^2) dx\nThen du = dx and v = ∫sin(nπx) / (1 - x^2) dx\n\nTo find v, we can use the substitution method:\n\nLet y = x^2, then dy = 2x dx\nSo, v = (1/2) * ∫sin(nπ(√y)) / (1 - y) dy\n\nNow, we can use the sine integral formula:\n\n∫sin(ax) dx = (1/a) * (cos(ax) - ∫cos(ax) dx)\n\nApplying this formula to our integral:\n\nv = (1/2) * [(1/nπ) * (cos(nπ(√y)) - ∫cos(nπ(√y)) dy]\n\nNow, substitute back y = x^2:\n\nv = (1/2) * [(1/nπ) * (cos(nπx) - ∫cos(nπx^2) * 2x dx)]\n\nNow, we can find b_n:\n\nb_n = ∫[x * sin(nπx) / (1 - x^2)] dx from -1 to 1\nb_n = ∫[u * dv] from -1 to 1\nb_n = [u * v] from -1 to 1 - ∫[v * du] from -1 to 1\n\nPlugging in the expressions for u, v, and du:\n\nb_n = [(x * (1/2) * [(1/nπ) * (cos(nπx) - ∫cos(nπx^2) * 2x dx)])] from -1 to 1 - ∫[((1/2) * [(1/nπ) * (cos(nπx) - ∫cos(nπx^2) * 2x dx)]) * dx] from -1 to 1\n\nSince the function is odd, the integral from -1 to 1 is zero:\n\nb_n = 0\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of the given function is:\n\nf(x) = 0\n\nHowever, this result is not correct for the given function f(x) = x / (1 - x^2). The reason is that the function f(x) has singularities at x = -1 and x = 1, which makes the Fourier series representation not convergent at these points. Therefore, the Fourier series representation does not exist for the given function f(x) = x / (1 - x^2) for -1 < x < 1."
