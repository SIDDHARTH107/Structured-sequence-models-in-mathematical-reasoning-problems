    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [3 - λ, 1; 2, 2 - λ]\n\nNow, we compute the determinant:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (3 - λ)(2 - λ) - (1)(2) = λ^2 - 5λ + 4\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we set the determinant equal to zero and solve for λ:\n\nλ^2 - 5λ + 4 = 0\n\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as (λ - 4)(λ - 1) = 0. Thus, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 4 and λ2 = 1.\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 4:\n\n(A - 4I)v1 = 0\n[(-1) 1; 2 (-2)]v1 = 0\n\nThe system of equations is:\n-1x + y = 0\n2x - 2y = 0\n\nWe can simplify the second equation to x - y = 0. Both equations are the same, so we only need to solve one of them:\n\nx = y\n\nWe can choose y = 1, so x = 1. Thus, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 4 is v1 = [1; 1].\n\nFor λ2 = 1:\n\n(A - 1I)v2 = 0\n[2 1; 2 1]v2 = 0\n\nThe system of equations is:\n2x + y = 0\n2x + y = 0\n\nAgain, both equations are the same, so we only need to solve one of them:\n\n2x + y = 0\n\nWe can choose x = 1, so y = -2. Thus, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = 1 is v2 = [1; -2].\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 4 and λ2 = 1, and their corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = [1; 1] and v2 = [1; -2]."
