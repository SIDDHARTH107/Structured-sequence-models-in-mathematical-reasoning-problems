    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  3  1 | 10 ]\n[ 4  5  2 | 20 ]\n[ 6  7  4 | 30 ]\n```\n\nNext, we will use Gaussian elimination to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5  0.5 |  5  ]\n[ 4  5    2  | 20  ]\n[ 6  7    4  | 30  ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row and 6 times the first row from the third row to eliminate the leading coefficients in the second and third rows:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5  0.5 |  5  ]\n[ 0 -1   -0  | -0  ]\n[ 0 -2   1.0 |  0  ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Multiply the second row by -1 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5  0.5 |  5  ]\n[ 0  1    0  |  0  ]\n[ 0 -2   1.0 |  0  ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Add 2 times the second row to the third row to eliminate the leading coefficient in the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5  0.5 |  5  ]\n[ 0  1    0  |  0  ]\n[ 0  0    1.0 |  0  ]\n```\n\nNow that we have the row-echelon form of the matrix, we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 0.\n\nFrom the second row, we have y = 0.\n\nFrom the first row, we have x + 1.5y + 0.5z = 5. Substituting the values of y and z, we get x = 5.\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 5, y = 0, and z = 0."
