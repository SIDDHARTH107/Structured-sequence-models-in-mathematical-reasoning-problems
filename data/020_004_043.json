    "message_1": "A company produces two products X and Y. The production of X requires 2 units of labor, 3 units of raw material, and 1 unit of machinery, while the production of Y requires 1 unit of labor, 4 units of raw material, and 1 unit of machinery. The company has 200 units of labor, 300 units of raw material, and 100 units of machinery. The profit per unit of X and Y is $5 and $7 respectively. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 7y, subject to the constraints:\n\n2x + y <= 200 (labor constraint)\n3x + 4y <= 300 (raw material constraint)\nx + y <= 100 (machinery constraint)\nx >= 0, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: y <= -2x + 200\n2. Raw material constraint: y <= (-3/4)x + 75\n3. Machinery constraint: y <= -x + 100\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these inequalities. The vertices of the feasible region are:\n\nA: (0, 0)\nB: (0, 75)\nC: (40, 60)\nD: (100, 0)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 5(0) + 7(0) = $0\nP(B) = 5(0) + 7(75) = $525\nP(C) = 5(40) + 7(60) = $620\nP(D) = 5(100) + 7(0) = $500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point C, where the company produces 40 units of product X and 60 units of product Y. The maximum profit is $620."
