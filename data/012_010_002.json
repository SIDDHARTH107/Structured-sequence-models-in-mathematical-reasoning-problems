    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum size of a vertex cover is the smallest number of vertices needed to cover all the edges.\n\nFor the given graph, one possible minimum vertex cover is {1, 4, 5}. This set of vertices covers all the edges:\n\n- Vertex 1 covers edges (1, 2) and (1, 3)\n- Vertex 4 covers edge (2, 4)\n- Vertex 5 covers edge (2, 5)\n\nNo smaller set of vertices can cover all the edges. Therefore, the minimum size of a vertex cover for this graph is 3."
