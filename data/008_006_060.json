    "message_2": "1) To find the eigenvalues of A, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[3 - λ, -2], [4, -1 - λ]]\n\nNow, we compute the determinant:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (3 - λ)((-1) - λ) - (-2)(4) = (λ^2 - 2λ - 7) + 8 = λ^2 - 2λ + 1\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can factor it as:\n\n(λ - 1)^2 = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalue λ is 1 with multiplicity 2.\n\n2) Now, we will find the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 1. We need to solve the equation (A - λI)x = 0, where x is the eigenvector.\n\n(A - λI)x = [[3 - 1, -2], [4, -1 - 1]]x = [[2, -2], [4, -2]]x = 0\n\nWe can simplify the system of equations as:\n\n2x - 2y = 0\n4x - 2y = 0\n\nThe second equation is just a multiple of the first equation, so we only need to consider one of them:\n\n2x - 2y = 0\nx = y\n\nThe eigenspace corresponding to λ = 1 is the set of all vectors of the form x = [y, y] or x = y[1, 1]. Thus, a basis for the eigenspace is {[1, 1]}."
