    "message_2": "To find the expression for f(z) in terms of z = x + iy, we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which are given by:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y and ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nGiven u(x,y) = x^2 - y^2 and v(x,y) = 2xy, we can compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂u/∂x = 2x, ∂u/∂y = -2y, ∂v/∂x = 2y, and ∂v/∂y = 2x\n\nWe can see that the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied:\n\n∂u/∂x = 2x = ∂v/∂y and ∂u/∂y = -2y = -∂v/∂x\n\nSince u and v satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, f(z) is analytic in the domain D. Now, we can find the expression for f(z) in terms of z = x + iy by integrating the partial derivatives:\n\n∫(∂u/∂x) dx = ∫(2x) dx = x^2 + C(y)\n\n∫(∂v/∂y) dy = ∫(2x) dy = 2xy + C(x)\n\nSince f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y), we can write:\n\nf(z) = (x^2 - y^2) + i(2xy)\n\nNow, we can express f(z) in terms of z = x + iy:\n\nf(z) = (x + iy)^2 = (x^2 - y^2) + i(2xy)\n\nSo, the expression for f(z) in terms of z is:\n\nf(z) = z^2"
