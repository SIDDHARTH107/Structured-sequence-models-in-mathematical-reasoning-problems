    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of experiencing x droughts in n years, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of experiencing a drought in any given year (0.25), and (1-p) is the probability of not experiencing a drought in any given year (0.75).\n\nWe want to find the probability of experiencing a drought in at least 2 of the next 5 years, which means we need to find the probability of experiencing 2, 3, 4, or 5 droughts in the next 5 years and then sum those probabilities.\n\nP(at least 2 droughts) = P(2 droughts) + P(3 droughts) + P(4 droughts) + P(5 droughts)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of combinations for each case:\n\nC(5, 2) = 10\nC(5, 3) = 10\nC(5, 4) = 5\nC(5, 5) = 1\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each case:\n\nP(2 droughts) = 10 * (0.25)^2 * (0.75)^3 ≈ 0.2637\nP(3 droughts) = 10 * (0.25)^3 * (0.75)^2 ≈ 0.0879\nP(4 droughts) = 5 * (0.25)^4 * (0.75)^1 ≈ 0.0146\nP(5 droughts) = 1 * (0.25)^5 * (0.75)^0 ≈ 0.00098\n\nFinally, we can sum the probabilities:\n\nP(at least 2 droughts) ≈ 0.2637 + 0.0879 + 0.0146 + 0.00098 ≈ 0.3672\n\nSo, the probability of experiencing a drought in at least 2 of the next 5 years is approximately 0.3672 or 36.72%."
