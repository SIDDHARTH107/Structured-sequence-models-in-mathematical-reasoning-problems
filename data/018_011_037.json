    "message_2": "First, let's find B ∩ {a, b}. The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets. In this case, B ∩ {a, b} = {a, b} since both a and b are common to B and the set {a, b}.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product A x (B ∩ {a, b}). The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. So, A x (B ∩ {a, b}) = A x {a, b} = {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)}.\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product A x B. A x B = {(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c)}.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product A x {a, b, c}. A x {a, b, c} = {(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c)}.\n\nFinally, let's find the intersection (A x B) ∩ (A x {a, b, c}). This is the set of all ordered pairs that are common to both A x B and A x {a, b, c}. In this case, (A x B) ∩ (A x {a, b, c}) = {(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c)} since all the ordered pairs are common to both sets.\n\nSo, the Cartesian product of A x (B ∩ {a, b}) and (A x B) ∩ (A x {a, b, c}) are:\n\nA x (B ∩ {a, b}) = {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)}\n\n(A x B) ∩ (A x {a, b, c}) = {(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c)}"
