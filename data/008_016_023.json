Perform 4 iterations and round your answer to 3 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "The Jacobi method is an iterative method used to solve systems of linear equations. To apply the Jacobi method, we first rewrite the given system of equations in the form x = Dx + b, where D is a diagonal matrix, x is the vector of variables, and b is a constant vector. In this case, we have:\n\nx = (1/2)(5 - 3y + z)\ny = (1/3)(-5 + 2x + z)\nz = (1/4)(7 + x - 2y)\n\nNow, we will perform 4 iterations using the initial guesses x(0) = 0, y(0) = 0, and z(0) = 0.\n\nIteration 1:\nx(1) = (1/2)(5 - 3*0 + 0) = 2.5\ny(1) = (1/3)(-5 + 2*0 + 0) = -1.667\nz(1) = (1/4)(7 + 0 - 2*0) = 1.75\n\nIteration 2:\nx(2) = (1/2)(5 - 3*(-1.667) + 1.75) = 3.917\ny(2) = (1/3)(-5 + 2*2.5 + 1.75) = 0.583\nz(2) = (1/4)(7 + 2.5 - 2*(-1.667)) = 2.542\n\nIteration 3:\nx(3) = (1/2)(5 - 3*0.583 + 2.542) = 3.104\ny(3) = (1/3)(-5 + 2*3.917 + 2.542) = 1.151\nz(3) = (1/4)(7 + 3.104 - 2*0.583) = 2.130\n\nIteration 4:\nx(4) = (1/2)(5 - 3*1.151 + 2.130) = 2.914\ny(4) = (1/3)(-5 + 2*3.104 + 2.130) = 1.046\nz(4) = (1/4)(7 + 2.914 - 2*1.151) = 1.881\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the approximate solutions are:\nx ≈ 2.914\ny ≈ 1.046\nz ≈ 1.881\n\nThese values are rounded to three decimal places."
