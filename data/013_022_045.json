    "message_1": "Consider a Dictator Game in which the dictator is given $100 to split between themselves and the receiver. The dictator proposes a split of $x to themselves and $(100-x) to the receiver. However, the receiver can reject the offer, causing both parties to receive $0. What is the maximum amount the dictator should propose to keep the receiver from rejecting the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, the dictator has the power to decide the split, and the receiver can either accept or reject the offer. If the receiver rejects the offer, both parties receive $0. The receiver would prefer to accept any offer that gives them a positive amount, as it is better than receiving nothing.\n\nHowever, the receiver might have a threshold of fairness, below which they would reject the offer even if it means getting nothing. This threshold varies from person to person and can be influenced by factors such as culture, social norms, and individual preferences.\n\nAssuming the receiver is rational and prefers to maximize their own payoff, the dictator should propose a split that gives the receiver at least $1 (or a very small positive amount), as this would be better than receiving $0 if they reject the offer. In this case, the dictator could propose to keep $99 (or $100 - ε, where ε is a very small positive amount) for themselves and give $1 (or ε) to the receiver. This would be the maximum amount the dictator should propose to keep the receiver from rejecting the offer, assuming the receiver is rational and wants to maximize their own payoff."
