Let M be the structure consisting of the set of real numbers R and \"<\" interpreted as the usual less-than relation. Determine whether the following statements are true or false in M:\n1. There exists an element x in M such that x < y for all y in M.\n2. There exists an element x in M such that y < x for all y in M. \n\nAre both statements true, false, or is one true and the other false? Justify your answer.",
    "message_2": "Both statements are false in M. \n\nTo justify this, let's consider each statement separately:\n\n1. There exists an element x in M such that x < y for all y in M.\n\nThis statement is false because there is no smallest real number. For any real number x, we can always find a smaller real number y (for example, y = x - 1). Therefore, there is no element x in M such that x < y for all y in M.\n\n2. There exists an element x in M such that y < x for all y in M.\n\nThis statement is also false because there is no largest real number. For any real number x, we can always find a larger real number y (for example, y = x + 1). Therefore, there is no element x in M such that y < x for all y in M.\n\nIn conclusion, both statements are false in the structure M."
