Let f be a Morse function on this surface with two critical points: one maximum of index 2 and one minimum of index 0. If we assume that the Morse function is non-degenerate, what is the Euler characteristic of the surface?",
    "message_2": "To find the Euler characteristic of the surface, we can use the Morse inequalities. The Morse inequalities state that the Euler characteristic χ can be computed as the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index:\n\nχ = Σ (-1)^i * c_i\n\nwhere c_i is the number of critical points of index i.\n\nIn this problem, we have a Morse function with two critical points: one maximum of index 2 (c_2 = 1) and one minimum of index 0 (c_0 = 1). There are no critical points of index 1 (c_1 = 0).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Morse inequalities formula:\n\nχ = (-1)^0 * c_0 + (-1)^1 * c_1 + (-1)^2 * c_2\nχ = (-1)^0 * 1 + (-1)^1 * 0 + (-1)^2 * 1\nχ = 1 + 0 + 1\nχ = 2\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the surface is 2. This indicates that the surface is a sphere (since a torus has an Euler characteristic of 0)."
