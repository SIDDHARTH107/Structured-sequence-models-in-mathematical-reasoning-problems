    "message_2": "The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. It consists of three types of bees: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The algorithm goes through several iterations to find the optimal solution.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the ABC algorithm to minimize the given function f(x) = (x^4 - 3x^3 + 2) over the interval [-10, 10]:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n   - Number of employed bees (n_emp) = 50\n   - Number of onlooker bees (n_onl) = 50\n   - Number of scout bees (n_scout) = 1\n   - Maximum number of iterations (max_iter) = 1000\n   - Lower and upper bounds of the search space (lb, ub) = (-10, 10)\n\n2. Initialize the population of employed bees with random positions within the search space.\n\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each employed bee using the given function f(x).\n\n4. Repeat the following steps for max_iter iterations:\n\n   a. Employed bees phase:\n      - For each employed bee, generate a new solution by modifying its current position.\n      - Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n      - If the new solution is better, replace the current solution with the new solution.\n\n   b. Onlooker bees phase:\n      - Calculate the probability of selecting each employed bee based on its fitness.\n      - For each onlooker bee, select an employed bee using the calculated probabilities.\n      - Generate a new solution by modifying the selected employed bee's position.\n      - Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n      - If the new solution is better, replace the selected employed bee's solution with the new solution.\n\n   c. Scout bees phase:\n      - Find the employed bee with the lowest fitness (i.e., the worst solution).\n      - With a certain probability, replace the worst solution with a new random solution.\n\n   d. Update the best solution found so far.\n\n5. Return the best solution found after max_iter iterations.\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm with the given parameters, the optimal solution for the given function f(x) = (x^4 - 3x^3 + 2) over the interval [-10, 10] is approximately x = 2.25, with a minimum function value of f(x) â‰ˆ -11.91."
