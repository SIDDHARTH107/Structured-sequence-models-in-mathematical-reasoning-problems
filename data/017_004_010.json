    "message_2": "To prove that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, we will use the Sylow Theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 25 = 5^2, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_5 divides the index of the 5-Sylow subgroup, which is 25/5 = 5.\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 5. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup, which must be normal. Let P be this unique 5-Sylow subgroup. Since the order of P is 5, which is prime, P is cyclic. Thus, G has a normal cyclic subgroup of order 5.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/P. Since the order of G is 25 and the order of P is 5, the order of G/P is 25/5 = 5. Since 5 is prime, G/P is cyclic. By the Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem, G is isomorphic to a direct product of P and G/P, both of which are cyclic groups of order 5. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIf n_5 = 5, then there are 5 distinct 5-Sylow subgroups in G. Let P and Q be two distinct 5-Sylow subgroups. Since the order of P and Q is 5, which is prime, both P and Q are cyclic. The intersection of P and Q is trivial, as their only common element is the identity element. \n\nNow, consider the set PQ = {pq | p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. The order of PQ is |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 5 * 5 / 1 = 25. Since the order of PQ is equal to the order of G, we have that G = PQ. Moreover, since P and Q are both normal in G, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, both of which are cyclic groups of order 5. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
