    "message_1": "Consider a two-player Stackelberg competition in which firm A is the leader with a fixed production level of 10 units, and firm B is the follower with a production function of Qb = 20 - 0.5Qa, where Qb is the quantity of units produced by firm B, and Qa is the quantity of units produced by firm A. Each unit sells at a price of $50. Calculate the profit earned by each firm, and determine the total profit earned in the market.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the profit earned by each firm, we first need to find the quantity produced by firm B given the fixed production level of firm A.\n\nSince firm A produces 10 units, we can plug this value into the production function for firm B:\n\nQb = 20 - 0.5 * 10\nQb = 20 - 5\nQb = 15\n\nNow that we have the quantity produced by each firm, we can calculate their respective revenues. The price per unit is $50, so:\n\nRevenue_A = Price * Quantity_A\nRevenue_A = $50 * 10\nRevenue_A = $500\n\nRevenue_B = Price * Quantity_B\nRevenue_B = $50 * 15\nRevenue_B = $750\n\nAssuming there are no costs associated with production, the profit for each firm is equal to their respective revenues:\n\nProfit_A = Revenue_A\nProfit_A = $500\n\nProfit_B = Revenue_B\nProfit_B = $750\n\nFinally, to find the total profit earned in the market, we simply add the profits of both firms:\n\nTotal_Profit = Profit_A + Profit_B\nTotal_Profit = $500 + $750\nTotal_Profit = $1,250\n\nSo, the profit earned by firm A is $500, the profit earned by firm B is $750, and the total profit earned in the market is $1,250."
