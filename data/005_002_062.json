A random sample of 50 bulbs was taken and their average lifespan was found to be 7950 hours. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true average lifespan of the bulbs.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true average lifespan of the bulbs, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere:\nSample Mean = 7950 hours (given)\nSample Size (n) = 50 (given)\nPopulation Standard Deviation (σ) = 200 hours (given)\nCritical Value (z) = 1.96 (for a 95% confidence interval)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Standard Error (SE):\n\nStandard Error (SE) = σ / √n\nSE = 200 / √50\nSE ≈ 28.28 hours\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = Critical Value * Standard Error\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 28.28\nMargin of Error ≈ 55.43 hours\n\nFinally, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± Margin of Error\nConfidence Interval = 7950 ± 55.43\nConfidence Interval = (7894.57, 8005.43)\n\nSo, we can be 95% confident that the true average lifespan of the bulbs is between 7894.57 hours and 8005.43 hours."
