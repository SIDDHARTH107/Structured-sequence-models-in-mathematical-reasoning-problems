    "message_2": "The Hopf map, denoted by $h: S^3 \\to S^2$, is a continuous map from the 3-dimensional sphere to the 2-dimensional sphere. To define the Hopf map, we first represent points in $S^3$ using quaternions. A quaternion is a number of the form $q = a + bi + cj + dk$, where $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $i, j, k$ are imaginary units with the property that $i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$. \n\nFor a point $p \\in S^3$, we can represent it as a unit quaternion $p = a + bi + cj + dk$, where $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1$. The Hopf map is then defined as follows:\n\n$$h(p) = h(a + bi + cj + dk) = (2(a^2 + b^2) - 1, 2(2ac + bd), 2(2ad - bc))$$\n\nThe resulting point $q = (x, y, z) \\in S^2$ is on the 2-dimensional sphere of radius $r' = 1$, as it satisfies the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$. This formula maps each point $p \\in S^3$ to a point $q \\in S^2$."
