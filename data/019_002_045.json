    "message_2": "To find the truth value of the given predicate logical statement, we need to check if the statement holds true for all values of 'a' and some value of 'b' such that a + b = x + y, where x = 5 and y = 3.\n\nLet's rewrite the statement with the given values of x and y:\n\n∀a∃b(a + b = 5 + 3)\n\nNow, we need to check if there exists a 'b' for every 'a' such that a + b = 8.\n\nFor any value of 'a', we can find a value of 'b' such that a + b = 8 by setting b = 8 - a. For example:\n\n- If a = 1, then b = 7 (1 + 7 = 8)\n- If a = 2, then b = 6 (2 + 6 = 8)\n- If a = 3, then b = 5 (3 + 5 = 8)\n\nThis pattern holds true for any value of 'a'. Therefore, the given predicate logical statement is true when x = 5 and y = 3."
