    "message_2": "To solve the given nonlinear differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. The equation is:\n\ndy/dt = 2y(1-y)\n\nRearrange the equation to separate variables:\n\ndy/(y(1-y)) = 2 dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/(y(1-y))) dy = ∫2 dt\n\nTo solve the integral on the left side, we can use partial fraction decomposition:\n\n1/(y(1-y)) = A/y + B/(1-y)\n\n1 = A(1-y) + B(y)\n\nComparing the coefficients, we get the following system of equations:\n\nA + B = 0\n-B = 1\n\nSolving this system, we find that A = 1 and B = -1. So, the integral becomes:\n\n∫(1/y - 1/(1-y)) dy = ∫2 dt\n\nNow, integrate:\n\nln|y| - ln|1-y| = 2t + C\n\nCombine the logarithms:\n\nln|y/(1-y)| = 2t + C\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides:\n\ny/(1-y) = e^(2t + C) = e^(2t)e^C\n\nLet k = e^C, then:\n\ny/(1-y) = ke^(2t)\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\ny = ke^(2t) - ke^(2t)y\n\ny(1 + ke^(2t)) = ke^(2t)\n\ny = ke^(2t) / (1 + ke^(2t))\n\nNow, we need to find the constant k using the initial condition y(0) = 0.5:\n\n0.5 = k / (1 + k)\n\nk = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = e^(2t) / (1 + e^(2t))\n\nNow, let's analyze the stability of the solution. The equilibrium points are the solutions of the equation:\n\n0 = 2y(1-y)\n\nThis equation has two solutions: y = 0 and y = 1.\n\nTo determine the stability of these equilibrium points, we can analyze the behavior of the function y(t) as t approaches infinity:\n\n- If t → ∞, y(t) = e^(2t) / (1 + e^(2t)) → 1\n- If t → -∞, y(t) = e^(2t) / (1 + e^(2t)) → 0\n\nThus, the equilibrium point y = 1 is stable, and the equilibrium point y = 0 is unstable. Since the initial condition y(0) = 0.5 is closer to y = 1, the stable solution closest to the initial condition is y = 1."
