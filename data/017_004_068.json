    "message_2": "There are two isomorphism classes of groups of order 49. They are:\n\n1. The cyclic group of order 49, denoted as C_49 or Z_49. This group has one generator, and its elements can be written as {0, 1, 2, ..., 48}, with the group operation being addition modulo 49.\n\n2. A non-abelian group of order 49, which is a semidirect product of two cyclic groups of order 7, denoted as C_7 â‹Š C_7. This group has a more complicated structure, but it can be represented by 7x7 matrices with entries in the finite field of order 7 (GF(7)).\n\nThese two groups exhaust all possibilities for groups of order 49, as 49 is a prime power (7^2), and the number of isomorphism classes of groups of order p^n (where p is a prime and n is a positive integer) is determined by the number of distinct abelian p-groups of order p^n. In this case, there are two such groups: the cyclic group of order 49 and the non-abelian group of order 49."
