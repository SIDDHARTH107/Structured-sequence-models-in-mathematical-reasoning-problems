If yes, provide a proof. If no, explain why not.",
    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible to prove the statement ¬S1 using only the rules of intuitionistic logic. Here's the proof:\n\n1. S1 → S2 (Given)\n2. S2 → S3 (Given)\n3. ¬S3 (Given)\n\nNow, we want to prove ¬S1. We will use the proof by contradiction method. Assume S1 is true:\n\n4. S1 (Assumption)\n\nFrom (1) and (4), we can apply the Modus Ponens rule:\n\n5. S2 (From 1 and 4, Modus Ponens)\n\nNow, from (2) and (5), we can again apply the Modus Ponens rule:\n\n6. S3 (From 2 and 5, Modus Ponens)\n\nHowever, this contradicts our given statement (3) ¬S3. Therefore, our assumption that S1 is true must be false. Thus, we can conclude:\n\n7. ¬S1 (From the contradiction between 3 and 6)\n\nSo, using the rules of intuitionistic logic, we have proved that ¬S1 is true."
