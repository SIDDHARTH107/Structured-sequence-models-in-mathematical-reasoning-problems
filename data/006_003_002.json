    "message_2": "There is only 1 Ace of Hearts in a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing an Ace of Hearts is 1 out of 52, which can be represented as a fraction:\n\n1/52\n\nAs a decimal, this is approximately:\n\n0.01923\n\nSo, the probability of drawing an Ace of Hearts from a standard deck of 52 playing cards is about 1.923%."
