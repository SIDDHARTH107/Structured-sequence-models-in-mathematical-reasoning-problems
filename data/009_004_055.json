    "message_2": "To find the position equation x(t) of the oscillator as a function of time, we first need to determine the angular frequency (ω) of the oscillator. The angular frequency is related to the mass (m) and the spring constant (k) by the following equation:\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nGiven the mass m = 0.5 kg and the spring constant k = 10 N/m, we can calculate the angular frequency:\n\nω = √(10/0.5) = √20\n\nNow, we can write the position equation x(t) for the simple harmonic oscillator. Since the oscillator is released with zero velocity, the position equation will be in the form:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the oscillation, ω is the angular frequency, t is the time, and φ is the phase angle. In this case, the amplitude A is equal to the initial displacement, which is 0.2 m. The phase angle φ is 0, as the oscillator starts at its maximum displacement.\n\nSo, the position equation x(t) is:\n\nx(t) = 0.2 * cos(√20 * t)"
