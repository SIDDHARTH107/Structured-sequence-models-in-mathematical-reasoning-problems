    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 5 > 7x - 8, we'll first move all the terms with x to one side of the inequality and the constants to the other side.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 3x from both sides of the inequality:\n3x + 5 - 3x > 7x - 8 - 3x\n5 > 4x - 8\n\nStep 2: Add 8 to both sides of the inequality:\n5 + 8 > 4x - 8 + 8\n13 > 4x\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the inequality by 4:\n13/4 > x\n\nSo the solution to the inequality is x < 13/4."
