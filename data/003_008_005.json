    "message_2": "To solve this problem using trigonometry, we can first find one of the angles of the triangle and then use the sine formula for the area of a triangle.\n\nLet's call the base of the triangle b, the height h, and the hypotenuse c. We are given that b = 12 cm and h = 8 cm. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nc^2 = b^2 + h^2\nc^2 = 12^2 + 8^2\nc^2 = 144 + 64\nc^2 = 208\nc = √208 ≈ 14.42 cm\n\nNow, let's find the angle θ between the base and the hypotenuse. We can use the cosine formula:\n\ncos(θ) = b/c\ncos(θ) = 12/14.42\nθ = cos^(-1)(12/14.42) ≈ 33.69°\n\nNow we can use the sine formula for the area of a triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * b * c * sin(θ)\nArea = (1/2) * 12 * 14.42 * sin(33.69°)\nArea ≈ 48 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 48 cm²."
