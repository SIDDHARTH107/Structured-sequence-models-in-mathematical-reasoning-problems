    "message_2": "To compute the intersection of the projective variety $V$ with the line $l$, we need to find the points that satisfy both the equation of $V$ and the equation of $l$. \n\nThe equation of $V$ is given by $y(x-z)=0$, and the equation of $l$ is given by $x=0$. \n\nFirst, let's consider the equation of $l$, $x=0$. In the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^2$, this means that the points on the line $l$ have coordinates of the form $(0:y:z)$, where $y$ and $z$ are homogeneous coordinates.\n\nNow, let's plug the coordinates of the points on the line $l$ into the equation of $V$, $y(x-z)=0$:\n\n$$y(0-z) = y(-z) = 0$$\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\n1) $y = 0$: In this case, the point is of the form $(0:0:z)$. However, in projective space, we cannot have all coordinates equal to zero. So, we must have $z \\neq 0$. Thus, the point is $(0:0:1)$, which is a valid point in $\\mathbb{P}^2$.\n\n2) $z = 0$: In this case, the point is of the form $(0:y:0)$. Since we are in projective space, we cannot have all coordinates equal to zero, so we must have $y \\neq 0$. Thus, the point is $(0:1:0)$, which is also a valid point in $\\mathbb{P}^2$.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of the projective variety $V$ with the line $l$ consists of the points $(0:0:1)$ and $(0:1:0)$."
