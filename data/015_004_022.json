    "message_2": "Given the formula for the area of a cardioid A = 3πr^2/8 – πr^2/2 + πr^2/2√2, and the radius of the disc r = 2, we can find the area of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set.\n\nA = 3π(2^2)/8 - π(2^2)/2 + π(2^2)/2√2\nA = 3π(4)/8 - π(4)/2 + π(4)/2√2\nA = 12π/8 - 4π/2 + 4π/2√2\nA = 3π/2 - 2π + 2π/√2\n\nNow, we can find a common denominator to combine the terms:\n\nA = (3π - 4π + 4π√2)/2\nA = (4π√2 - π)/2\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set with a radius of 2 is (4π√2 - π)/2."
