    "message_2": "1. p → r\n\nTo prove p → r, we will assume p and try to derive r using the given propositions A.\n\nAssume p.\n\nFrom A, we have p → q. Since we assumed p, we can derive q using the Modus Ponens rule.\n\nFrom A, we also have ¬p ∨ r. Now, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: ¬p\nBut we assumed p, so this case leads to a contradiction.\n\nCase 2: r\nIn this case, we have derived r.\n\nSince case 1 leads to a contradiction, we are left with case 2, which means we have derived r. Therefore, p → r is provable under intuitionistic logic.\n\nProof: (p → q), (¬p ∨ r), ¬r ⊢ p → r\n\n2. p ∧ ¬q\n\nTo prove p ∧ ¬q, we need to derive both p and ¬q. However, from A, we have p → q, which means if p is true, then q must be true. This contradicts the requirement that ¬q must be true. Therefore, p ∧ ¬q is not provable under intuitionistic logic.\n\nCounterexample: Let p = True and q = True. Then, p → q is true, ¬p ∨ r is true (since ¬p is false and r can be either true or false), and ¬r is true if r is false. However, p ∧ ¬q is false in this case.\n\n3. ¬p ∨ ¬q\n\nTo prove ¬p ∨ ¬q, we will use the given propositions A.\n\nFrom A, we have p → q. This can be rewritten as ¬p ∨ q using the Implication rule.\n\nNow, we have ¬p ∨ q and ¬p ∨ r from A. We can use the Disjunction Elimination rule to derive ¬p ∨ ¬q:\n\nCase 1: ¬p\nIn this case, ¬p ∨ ¬q is true.\n\nCase 2: q\nFrom A, we have ¬r. Since we have ¬p ∨ r, we can use the Disjunction Elimination rule again:\n\nSubcase 2.1: ¬p\nIn this case, ¬p ∨ ¬q is true.\n\nSubcase 2.2: r\nThis case leads to a contradiction since we have ¬r from A.\n\nSince subcase 2.2 leads to a contradiction, we are left with subcase 2.1, which means ¬p ∨ ¬q is true.\n\nTherefore, ¬p ∨ ¬q is provable under intuitionistic logic.\n\nProof: (p → q), (¬p ∨ r), ¬r ⊢ ¬p ∨ ¬q"
