    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y)$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient of a function is given by the partial derivatives with respect to each variable. Let's compute the partial derivatives of $f(x, y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x - 4$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y + 2$$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y)$ where both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n$$2x - 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 2$$\n$$2y + 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = -1$$\n\nThus, there is only one critical point, $(2, -1)$. Now, we need to classify this critical point using the second partial derivative test. We need to compute the second partial derivatives of $f(x, y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 0$$\n\nNow, we compute the Hessian determinant:\n\n$$D = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{vmatrix} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{vmatrix} = (2)(2) - (0)(0) = 4$$\n\nSince the Hessian determinant $D > 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} > 0$, the critical point $(2, -1)$ is a local minimum.\n\nIn conclusion, the function $f(x, y)$ has one critical point, which is a local minimum at $(2, -1)$."
