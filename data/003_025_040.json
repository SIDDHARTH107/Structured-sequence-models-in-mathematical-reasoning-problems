    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the ship's resultant displacement, we can use the Pythagorean theorem since the ship's movement forms a right triangle. Let R be the magnitude of the resultant displacement.\n\nR^2 = (10 km)^2 + (16 km)^2\nR^2 = 100 km^2 + 256 km^2\nR^2 = 356 km^2\nR = √356 km\nR ≈ 18.87 km\n\nNow, to find the direction of the ship's resultant displacement, we can use the tangent function. Let θ be the angle between the east direction and the resultant displacement.\n\ntan(θ) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(θ) = (16 km) / (10 km)\ntan(θ) = 1.6\n\nθ = arctan(1.6)\nθ ≈ 58.0°\n\nSo, the magnitude of the ship's resultant displacement is approximately 18.87 km, and the direction is approximately 58.0° north of east."
