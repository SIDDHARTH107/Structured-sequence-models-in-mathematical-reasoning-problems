    "message_1": "If there are 6 different balls and 3 identical boxes, how many ways can the 6 balls be distributed among the 3 boxes?",
    "message_2": "Since the boxes are identical, we can use the \"stars and bars\" method to solve this problem. We have 6 balls (stars) and we want to divide them into 3 groups (boxes). To do this, we need 2 dividers (bars).\n\nImagine the balls as stars (*) and the dividers as bars (|). For example, a distribution like this: **|***|* represents 2 balls in the first box, 3 balls in the second box, and 1 ball in the last box.\n\nNow we have a sequence of 6 stars and 2 bars, which is a total of 8 positions. We need to choose 2 positions for the bars out of the 8 positions. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn our case, n = 8 (total positions) and k = 2 (positions for the bars):\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!)\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!6!)\nC(8, 2) = (8 × 7 × 6!)/(2 × 6!)\nC(8, 2) = (8 × 7)/2\nC(8, 2) = 28\n\nSo there are 28 ways to distribute the 6 different balls among the 3 identical boxes."
