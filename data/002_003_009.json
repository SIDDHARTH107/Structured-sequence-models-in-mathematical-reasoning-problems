    "message_1": "A cube has a side length of 7 cm. What is the total surface area of the cube?",
    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the total surface area of the cube, we need to find the area of one face and then multiply it by 6.\n\nThe area of a square is found by multiplying the side length by itself. In this case, the side length is 7 cm.\n\nArea of one face = side length × side length = 7 cm × 7 cm = 49 square centimeters\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one face by the number of faces (6) to find the total surface area of the cube.\n\nTotal surface area = area of one face × number of faces = 49 square centimeters × 6 = 294 square centimeters\n\nThe total surface area of the cube is 294 square centimeters."
