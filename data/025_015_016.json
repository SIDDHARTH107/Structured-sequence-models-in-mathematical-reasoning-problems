    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane that passes through the intersection of the given surfaces, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's consider the function:\n\n$F(x, y, z, \\lambda) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - \\lambda(x + y + z)$\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of F and set it equal to the zero vector:\n\n$\\nabla F(x, y, z, \\lambda) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2x - \\lambda \\\\ 2y - \\lambda \\\\ 2z - \\lambda \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\n$2x - \\lambda = 0 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}$\n\n$2y - \\lambda = 0 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}$\n\n$2z - \\lambda = 0 \\Rightarrow z = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}$\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions for x, y, and z back into the constraint equation $x + y + z = 0$:\n\n$\\frac{\\lambda}{2} + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} = 0 \\Rightarrow \\lambda = 0$\n\nHowever, this would lead to x = y = z = 0, which doesn't satisfy the equation of the sphere. Therefore, we need to find another approach.\n\nLet's substitute the equation of the plane $x + y + z = 0$ into the equation of the sphere $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$:\n\n$(x + y)^2 + z^2 = 1$\n\nNow, let's express z in terms of x and y:\n\n$z = -(x + y)$\n\nSubstitute this expression for z back into the equation:\n\n$(x + y)^2 + (-x - y)^2 = 1$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2xy = 1$\n\nNow, let's find the gradient of the function G(x, y) = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2xy - 1:\n\n$\\nabla G(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix} 4x + 2y \\\\ 4y + 2x \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSince the gradient of G is orthogonal to the plane, we can use it as the normal vector of the plane. Thus, the equation of the plane can be written as:\n\n$(4x + 2y)(x - x_0) + (4y + 2x)(y - y_0) + (-x - y)(z - z_0) = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find a point (x_0, y_0, z_0) that lies on the intersection of the given surfaces. One such point is (1, -1, 0):\n\n$(4x + 2y)(x - 1) + (4y + 2x)(y + 1) + (-x - y)(z - 0) = 0$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$6x^2 + 6y^2 + 6xy - 2x - 2y - z = 0$\n\nThis is the equation of the plane that passes through the intersection of the given surfaces."
