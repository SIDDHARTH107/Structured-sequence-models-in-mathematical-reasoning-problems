    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the surface area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nThe formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of one circular base:\nA = πr²\nA = π(4cm)²\nA = 16π cm²\n\nSince there are two bases, we need to multiply this area by 2:\n2 * 16π cm² = 32π cm²\n\nNow, let's find the lateral surface area:\nA = 2πrh\nA = 2π(4cm)(10cm)\nA = 80π cm²\n\nFinally, let's add the areas of the two bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\nTotal Surface Area = 32π cm² + 80π cm² = 112π cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cylinder is 112π cm²."
