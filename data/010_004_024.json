    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the fact that a continuous function on a compact set is uniformly continuous and that the image of a compact set under a continuous function is also compact.\n\nSince f is continuous on the compact set X, it is uniformly continuous. Now, we will show that the image of X under f, denoted as f(X), is compact. Since X is compact, for any open cover of f(X), there exists a finite subcover. Let {V_i} be an open cover of f(X). Then, for each V_i, there exists an open set U_i in M such that f(U_i) ⊆ V_i. Since f is continuous, the preimage of each V_i under f is an open set in X. Thus, {U_i} is an open cover of X. Since X is compact, there exists a finite subcover {U_1, U_2, ..., U_n} of X. Then, {V_1, V_2, ..., V_n} is a finite subcover of f(X), which implies that f(X) is compact.\n\nNow, since f(X) is a compact subset of R, it is closed and bounded. Therefore, f(X) has a maximum and a minimum value. Let M = sup f(X) and m = inf f(X). Since f(X) is closed, M and m are in f(X). Thus, there exist x_M, x_m ∈ X such that f(x_M) = M and f(x_m) = m.\n\nNow, we will show that f(x_m) ≤ f(x) ≤ f(x_M) for all x ∈ X. Let x ∈ X. Since f(x) ∈ f(X), we have m ≤ f(x) ≤ M by definition of infimum and supremum. Therefore, f(x_m) ≤ f(x) ≤ f(x_M) for all x ∈ X.\n\nIn conclusion, if f : X → R is continuous and X is a compact set in a metric space (M,d), then f achieves a maximum and a minimum on X, i.e., there exist x_m, x_M ∈ X such that f(x_m) ≤ f(x) ≤ f(x_M) for all x ∈ X."
