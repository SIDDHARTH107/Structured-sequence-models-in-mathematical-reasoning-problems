    "message_2": "To form a committee of 5 members from 10 people, we need to choose a chairperson, a vice-chairperson, and 3 other members. We can use Stirling numbers to solve this problem, but it's not the most straightforward method. Instead, we can use the permutation formula for this problem.\n\nFirst, we choose the chairperson. There are 10 choices for the chairperson since any of the 10 people can be the chairperson. After choosing the chairperson, there are 9 remaining people to choose from for the vice-chairperson. So, there are 10 * 9 = 90 ways to choose the chairperson and vice-chairperson.\n\nNow, we need to choose the remaining 3 members of the committee from the remaining 8 people (since the chairperson and vice-chairperson have already been chosen). We can use the combination formula for this:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 56\n\nSo, there are 56 ways to choose the remaining 3 members of the committee.\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to choose the chairperson and vice-chairperson (90) by the number of ways to choose the remaining 3 members (56):\n\n90 * 56 = 5040\n\nTherefore, there are 5040 ways to form a committee of 5 members from 10 people, with one chairperson and one vice-chairperson."
