We can classify them based on their element orders and the structure of their subgroups.\n\n1. Cyclic group: C_32\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_16 × C_2\n3. Direct product of three cyclic groups: C_8 × C_4\n4. Direct product of four cyclic groups: C_4 × C_4 × C_2\n5. Direct product of five cyclic groups: C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2\n\n6-10.
