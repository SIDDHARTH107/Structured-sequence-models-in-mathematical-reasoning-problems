    "message_1": "A message is encrypted using a substitution cipher and the letter \"A\" is replaced by \"C\", the letter \"B\" is replaced by \"E\", the letter \"C\" is replaced by \"G\", the letter \"D\" is replaced by \"H\" and so on until \"Z\" is replaced by \"X\". Decrypt the message \"DXCYF\" using the given substitution cipher.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message \"DXCYF\", we need to reverse the substitution cipher. Since \"A\" is replaced by \"C\", we know that \"C\" should be replaced by \"A\". Similarly, \"B\" is replaced by \"E\", so \"E\" should be replaced by \"B\", and so on. Using this reverse substitution, we can decrypt the message:\n\nD -> B\nX -> V\nC -> A\nY -> W\nF -> D\n\nSo, the decrypted message is \"BAVWD\"."
