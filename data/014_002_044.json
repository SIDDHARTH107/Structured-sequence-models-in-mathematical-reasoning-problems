    "message_1": "Bob and Alice want to communicate securely using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. They have agreed upon using a prime modulus p=23 and base g=5. Bob's secret integer is a=12 and Alice's secret integer is b=9. What is the shared secret key that they can use to encrypt their messages?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Bob computes A = g^a mod p\n2. Alice computes B = g^b mod p\n3. Bob computes the shared secret key as K1 = B^a mod p\n4. Alice computes the shared secret key as K2 = A^b mod p\n\nIf the protocol works correctly, K1 and K2 should be the same.\n\nLet's compute the values:\n\n1. A = 5^12 mod 23 = 8\n2. B = 5^9 mod 23 = 6\n3. K1 = 6^12 mod 23 = 2\n4. K2 = 8^9 mod 23 = 2\n\nSince K1 and K2 are the same, the shared secret key is 2. Bob and Alice can use this key to encrypt their messages."
