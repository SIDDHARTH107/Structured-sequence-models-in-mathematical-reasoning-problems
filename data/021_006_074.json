    "message_2": "To solve the 2D heat equation using the finite element method, we will first discretize the spatial domain using a uniform mesh and then discretize the time domain using a time-stepping method. We will use the Crank-Nicolson method for time discretization.\n\n1. Spatial discretization:\n\nLet's create a uniform mesh with N nodes in each direction (x and y). The mesh size will be h = 1/(N-1).\n\n2. Time discretization:\n\nWe will use the Crank-Nicolson method, which is an implicit time-stepping method. Let's discretize the time domain with time step size $\\Delta t$ and denote the numerical solution at time step n as $u^n(x,y)$. The Crank-Nicolson method can be written as:\n\n$\\frac{u^{n+1} - u^n}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla^2 u^{n+1} + \\nabla^2 u^n)$\n\n3. Finite element method:\n\nWe will use the standard Galerkin finite element method to discretize the spatial derivatives. Let $\\phi_i(x,y)$ be the basis functions, then the numerical solution can be approximated as:\n\n$u^n(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N^2} U_i^n \\phi_i(x,y)$\n\nSubstitute the approximation into the Crank-Nicolson method and apply the Galerkin method, we can obtain a linear system:\n\n$[M + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}K]U^{n+1} = [M - \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}K]U^n$\n\nwhere M is the mass matrix, K is the stiffness matrix, and U is the vector of nodal values.\n\n4. Implementation:\n\nWe will implement the finite element method using a standard linear finite element library (e.g., FEniCS, deal.II, or FreeFEM) and solve the linear system using a sparse linear solver (e.g., PETSc or Eigen).\n\n5. Comparison with the exact solution:\n\nThe exact solution is given by $u(x,y,0.5)=e^{-5\\pi^2t}\\sin(2\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)$. We will compute the numerical solution at time t=0.5 using the finite element method with 10, 20, and 40 nodes in each direction, and compare the numerical solution with the exact solution using the L2 norm of the error:\n\n$error = \\sqrt{\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}(u_{exact}(x,y,0.5) - u_{numerical}(x,y,0.5))^2 dx dy}$\n\nWe expect the error to decrease as the mesh is refined, demonstrating the convergence of the finite element method."
