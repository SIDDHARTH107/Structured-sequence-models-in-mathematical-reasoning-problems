    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the curve $C$, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to $x$ and $y$, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are zero.\n\nLet $F(x, y) = x^3 - 3x^2y + 3xy^2 - y^3$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 6xy + 3y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = -3x^2 + 6xy - 3y^2$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y)$ where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 0 \\Rightarrow 3x^2 - 6xy + 3y^2 = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 0 \\Rightarrow -3x^2 + 6xy - 3y^2 = 0$\n\nNotice that the second equation is just the negative of the first equation. Therefore, we only need to solve one of them. Let's solve the first equation:\n\n$3x^2 - 6xy + 3y^2 = 0$\n\nDivide by 3:\n\n$x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 0$\n\nFactor:\n\n$(x - y)^2 = 0$\n\nThus, $x = y$. The singular points are on the line $x = y$. Now, we need to find the points on this line that also satisfy the equation of the curve $C$:\n\n$x^3 - 3x^2x + 3xx^2 - x^3 = 0$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$-2x^3 + 3x^3 = 0$\n\n$x^3 = 0$\n\nSo, $x = 0$, and since $x = y$, $y = 0$ as well. Therefore, the only singular point is $(0, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether this singular point is a node, cusp, or tacnode. To do this, we will compute the second partial derivatives of $F(x, y)$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x^2} = 6x - 6y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -6 + 6$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial y^2} = 6x - 6y$\n\nNow, we need to compute the discriminant $\\Delta$ at the singular point $(0, 0)$:\n\n$\\Delta = \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x^2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial y^2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\right)^2$\n\nAt $(0, 0)$, we have:\n\n$\\Delta = (0)(0) - (0)^2 = 0$\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, the singular point $(0, 0)$ is a tacnode."
