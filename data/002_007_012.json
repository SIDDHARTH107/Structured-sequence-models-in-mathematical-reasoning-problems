    "message_1": "What is the area of a trapezoid with height 8 cm and bases of lengths 6 cm and 12 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (sum of the bases) × height\n\nIn this case, the height is 8 cm, and the bases are 6 cm and 12 cm. So, the sum of the bases is 6 + 12 = 18 cm.\n\nNow, plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × 18 × 8\n\nArea = 9 × 8\n\nArea = 72 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 72 square centimeters."
