    "message_2": "The function $f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} z^n$ is a geometric series. For $|z| < 1$, the series converges and we can find its sum using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - z}$ for $|z| < 1$.\n\nNow, we want to find the analytic continuation of this function to the entire complex plane. The function $\\frac{1}{1 - z}$ is already analytic everywhere except at the point $z = 1$. Therefore, the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the entire complex plane is simply the function:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - z}$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ with $z \\neq 1$.\n\nNote that the function is not defined at $z = 1$, as it has a simple pole at this point."
