    "message_2": "In a topological space, a path-connected component is always connected, but a connected component is not necessarily path-connected. Since X has 3 connected components and 5 path-connected components, there must be some overlap between the connected components and the path-connected components.\n\nLet's denote the connected components as A, C, and D, and the path-connected components as B, E, F, G, and H. We know that B is one of the path-connected components and is also connected. Therefore, B must be one of the connected components, say A. So, A = B.\n\nNow, we have 2 connected components left (C and D) and 4 path-connected components left (E, F, G, and H). Since path-connected components are connected, each of the remaining path-connected components must be a subset of the remaining connected components. \n\nLet's assume that E is a subset of C and F is a subset of D. Then, we have 2 connected components (C and D) and 2 path-connected components (G and H) left. Since G and H are also connected, they must be subsets of either C or D. \n\nIf G and H are both subsets of C, then D would have no path-connected components, which is not possible. Similarly, if G and H are both subsets of D, then C would have no path-connected components, which is also not possible. Therefore, one of G and H must be a subset of C, and the other must be a subset of D.\n\nIn this case, each of the connected components C and D contains exactly two path-connected components. This means that both C and D are connected but not path-connected.\n\nSo, there are 2 components in X that are connected but not path-connected."
