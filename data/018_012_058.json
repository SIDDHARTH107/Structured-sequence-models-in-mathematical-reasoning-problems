    "message_1": "Consider the following sets: \n\nA = {1, 2} \n\nB = {2, 3} \n\nC = {3, 4} \n\nFind the Cartesian products of A and (B ∩ C) and (A × B) ∩ (A × C). Show that these two sets are not equal and therefore, prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection of sets B and C:\n\nB ∩ C = {3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and (B ∩ C):\n\nA × (B ∩ C) = A × {3} = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and A × C:\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\nA × C = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A × B) and (A × C):\n\n(A × B) ∩ (A × C) = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nComparing the two sets we found:\n\nA × (B ∩ C) = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}\n(A × B) ∩ (A × C) = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nBoth sets are equal:\n\nA × (B ∩ C) = (A × B) ∩ (A × C)\n\nThis shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is associative with respect to intersection for this specific example. However, this does not prove that it holds true for all possible sets. To prove that the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to intersection in general, we would need to find a counterexample where the equality does not hold."
