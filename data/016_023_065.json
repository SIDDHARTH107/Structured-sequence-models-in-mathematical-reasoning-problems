    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are 5 self-similar pieces (N = 5) and the scaling factor is 3 (s = 3) since each square is divided into 9 smaller squares, and 5 of them are filled.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension does not change with the number of iterations or the step size, so it remains the same (approximately 1.465) even when the step size is 1 and it has been iterated 6 times."
