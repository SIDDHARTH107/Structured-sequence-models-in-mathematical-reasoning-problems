    "message_2": "To estimate the value of x(100) using a numerical method, we can use the Euler's method. The Euler's method is a first-order numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. It is an iterative method that uses the equation:\n\nx(t + h) = x(t) + h * f(t, x(t))\n\nwhere h is the step size, and f(t, x(t)) is the derivative of x with respect to t.\n\nGiven the Mackey-Glass equation:\n\ndx/dt = (a * x(t-d) / (1 + x(t-d)^b)) - c * x(t)\n\nLet's define f(t, x(t)):\n\nf(t, x(t)) = (a * x(t-d) / (1 + x(t-d)^b)) - c * x(t)\n\nNow, we can use Euler's method to estimate the value of x(100) with a step size of h = 0.1:\n\n1. Initialize the variables:\n   t = 0\n   x = 1\n   h = 0.1\n   d = 10\n   a = 0.2\n   b = 10\n   c = 0.1\n\n2. Create a function to store past values of x(t) for t-d calculation:\n\n   def past_x_values(t, x):\n       # Store past values of x(t) in a dictionary\n       past_values = {}\n       past_values[t] = x\n       return past_values\n\n3. Implement the Euler's method:\n\n   past_values = past_x_values(t, x)\n\n   while t < 100:\n       # Calculate x(t-d) using past values\n       if t - d in past_values:\n           x_t_minus_d = past_values[t - d]\n       else:\n           x_t_minus_d = 1  # Initial value of x(t)\n\n       # Calculate f(t, x(t))\n       f_t_x_t = (a * x_t_minus_d / (1 + x_t_minus_d**b)) - c * x\n\n       # Update x(t + h) using Euler's method\n       x = x + h * f_t_x_t\n\n       # Update t\n       t = t + h\n\n       # Store the new value of x(t)\n       past_values[t] = x\n\n4. The estimated value of x(100) is:\n\n   x(100) â‰ˆ x\n\nPlease note that this is a rough estimation using the Euler's method with a step size of h = 0.1. More accurate results can be obtained using more advanced numerical methods or smaller step sizes."
