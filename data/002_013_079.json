    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 9 cm. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * length * width * height\n\nIn this case, the length is 6 cm, the width is 4 cm, and the height is 9 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 6 * 4 * 9\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 24 * 9\n\nVolume = 8 * 9\n\nVolume = 72 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 72 cubic centimeters."
