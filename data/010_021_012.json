Show that the subset {f ∈ C^∞(M)| d(fω^n)≠0} is dense in C^∞(M), where n is the dimension of M.\"\n\nThe student needs to prove this statement using their knowledge of symplectic geometry and also needs to use the fact that the symplectic form ω is a non-degenerate two-form on the manifold M.",
    "message_2": "To prove that the subset {f ∈ C^∞(M)| d(fω^n)≠0} is dense in C^∞(M), we will show that for any g ∈ C^∞(M) and any neighborhood U of g, there exists an f ∈ {f ∈ C^∞(M)| d(fω^n)≠0} such that f ∈ U. This will imply that the subset is dense in C^∞(M).\n\nLet g ∈ C^∞(M) and let U be an open neighborhood of g in C^∞(M). Since U is open, there exists a smooth function ε: M → ℝ with ε > 0 such that the ε-neighborhood of g is contained in U. Define a new function h: M → ℝ by h(x) = g(x) + ε(x).\n\nNow, consider the differential form hω^n. Since ω is a non-degenerate two-form and h is a smooth function, hω^n is a non-degenerate 2n-form. Moreover, since ω is closed, dω = 0, and thus dhω^n = d(hω^n) ≠ 0.\n\nNow, we have found a function h ∈ {f ∈ C^∞(M)| d(fω^n)≠0} such that h is in the ε-neighborhood of g. Since the ε-neighborhood of g is contained in U, we have h ∈ U. This shows that for any g ∈ C^∞(M) and any neighborhood U of g, there exists an f ∈ {f ∈ C^∞(M)| d(fω^n)≠0} such that f ∈ U.\n\nTherefore, the subset {f ∈ C^∞(M)| d(fω^n)≠0} is dense in C^∞(M)."
