    "message_1": "What is the singular point of the algebraic curve defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0?\n\nHint: To find the singular point of an algebraic curve, we need to differentiate the equation of the curve with respect to both variables x and y, and then solve the resulting system of equations simultaneously. After finding the values of x, y, and z that satisfy this system of equations, we can plug them back into the original equation of the curve to confirm that we have found the singular point.",
