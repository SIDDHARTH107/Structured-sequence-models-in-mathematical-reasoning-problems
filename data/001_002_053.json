    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (-3, 4), we can use the slope-point form of a linear equation, which is given by:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is a point on the line and m is the slope of the line.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope (m) using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points (2, 5) and (-3, 4), we have:\n\nm = (4 - 5) / (-3 - 2) = (-1) / (-5) = 1/5\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use either point to find the equation of the line. Let's use the point (2, 5):\n\ny - 5 = (1/5)(x - 2)\n\nTo get the equation in the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), we can simplify the equation:\n\ny - 5 = (1/5)x - 2/5\n\ny = (1/5)x - 2/5 + 5\n\ny = (1/5)x - 2/5 + 25/5\n\ny = (1/5)x + 23/5\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 5) and (-3, 4) is:\n\ny = (1/5)x + 23/5"
