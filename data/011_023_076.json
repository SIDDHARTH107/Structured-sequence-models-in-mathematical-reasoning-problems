    "message_1": "Suppose there are 7 classrooms in a school and each classroom is available for 1 hour during lunch. There are 4 groups of students, and each group wants to have lunch together in a classroom. However, no two groups can be in the same classroom at the same time. What is the minimum number of different lunch hours required to accommodate all the groups?",
    "message_2": "Since there are 7 classrooms available and 4 groups of students, it is possible to accommodate all the groups in a single lunch hour. Each group can have lunch in a separate classroom, and there will still be 3 classrooms left unused. Therefore, the minimum number of different lunch hours required to accommodate all the groups is 1."
