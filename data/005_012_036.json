    "message_2": "To estimate the true proportion of all college students who regularly exercise with a 95% confidence level, we will use the formula for the confidence interval of a proportion:\n\nConfidence Interval = p-hat ± Z * sqrt((p-hat * (1 - p-hat)) / n)\n\nwhere p-hat is the sample proportion, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, p-hat = 0.70 (70% of the 500 college students regularly exercise), n = 500, and the Z-score for a 95% confidence level is approximately 1.96.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 0.70 ± 1.96 * sqrt((0.70 * (1 - 0.70)) / 500)\n\nConfidence Interval = 0.70 ± 1.96 * sqrt((0.70 * 0.30) / 500)\n\nConfidence Interval = 0.70 ± 1.96 * sqrt(0.21 / 500)\n\nConfidence Interval = 0.70 ± 1.96 * sqrt(0.00042)\n\nConfidence Interval = 0.70 ± 1.96 * 0.02049\n\nConfidence Interval = 0.70 ± 0.04016\n\nConfidence Interval = (0.65984, 0.74016)\n\nTherefore, we can estimate with 95% confidence that the true proportion of all college students who regularly exercise is between 65.98% and 74.02%."
