    "message_2": "To find out how long it will take to fill the tank, we first need to determine the volume of the tank. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 4 feet, and the height (h) is 8 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = π(4²)(8)\nV = π(16)(8)\nV = 128π cubic feet\n\nNow that we know the volume of the tank, we can determine how long it will take to fill it at a rate of 3 cubic feet per minute. To do this, we simply divide the volume by the rate:\n\nTime = Volume / Rate\nTime = (128π) / 3\n\nTime ≈ 134.041286 minutes\n\nIt will take approximately 134.04 minutes to fill the tank."
