    "message_2": "To find the value of sin(45 degrees) and cos(30 degrees), we can use the special angles in trigonometry.\n\nFor a 45-degree angle, sin(45) = cos(45) = √2/2 or 1/√2. So, sin(45 degrees) = √2/2 or 1/√2.\n\nFor a 30-degree angle, sin(30) = 1/2 and cos(30) = √3/2. So, cos(30 degrees) = √3/2.\n\nTherefore, sin(45 degrees) = √2/2 or 1/√2, and cos(30 degrees) = √3/2."
