    "message_1": "Let M be a model consisting of the set of natural numbers with the usual ordering, and let A be the subset {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}. Determine if A is definable in M using a first-order formula.",
    "message_2": "Yes, A is definable in M using a first-order formula.\n\nTo define A, which is the set of even natural numbers, we can use the following first-order formula:\n\n∀x (A(x) ↔ ∃y (x = 2 * y))\n\nHere, A(x) is a predicate that holds if x is an element of A. The formula states that for every natural number x, x is an element of A if and only if there exists another natural number y such that x is equal to 2 times y. This captures the property of being an even number, as every even number can be expressed as the product of 2 and another natural number."
