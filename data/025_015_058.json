    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane, we first need to find the normal vector to the plane. Since the plane intersects the sphere, the normal vector at the point of intersection will be the same as the gradient of the sphere's equation at that point.\n\nThe gradient of the sphere's equation is given by the vector of partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\nâˆ‡(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\nAt the point (3, -4, 0), the gradient is:\n\n(2 * 3, 2 * (-4), 2 * 0) = (6, -8, 0)\n\nSo the normal vector to the plane is (6, -8, 0).\n\nNow we can use the point-normal form of the plane equation, which is given by:\n\na(x - x0) + b(y - y0) + c(z - z0) = 0\n\nwhere (a, b, c) is the normal vector, and (x0, y0, z0) is the point through which the plane passes.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n6(x - 3) - 8(y + 4) + 0(z - 0) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n6x - 8y - 18 = 0\n\nSo the equation of the plane that intersects the sphere and passes through the point (3, -4, 0) is:\n\n6x - 8y - 18 = 0"
