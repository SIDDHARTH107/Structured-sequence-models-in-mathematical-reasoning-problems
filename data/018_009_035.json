    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A x B:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find (A x B) x C:\n\n(A x B) x C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B x C:\n\nB x C = {(3, 5), (4, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find A x (B x C):\n\nA x (B x C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nNow, let's rewrite the elements of (A x B) x C and A x (B x C) as ordered triples:\n\n(A x B) x C = {(1, 3, 5), (1, 4, 5), (2, 3, 5), (2, 4, 5)}\n\nA x (B x C) = {(1, 3, 5), (1, 4, 5), (2, 3, 5), (2, 4, 5)}\n\nAs we can see, (A x B) x C and A x (B x C) have the same elements, which means they are equal. This demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is associative."
