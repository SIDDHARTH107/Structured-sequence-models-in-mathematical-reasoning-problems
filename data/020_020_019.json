    "message_1": "A company is designing a cylindrical container to hold 5000 ml of liquid. The material cost of the top and bottom of the container is $0.03 per square cm and the material cost of the side of the container is $0.01 per square cm. What are the dimensions (i.e. radius and height) of the container that will minimize the cost of materials?",
    "message_2": "Let r be the radius and h be the height of the cylindrical container. The volume of the container is given by V = πr^2h. Since the container needs to hold 5000 ml (which is equal to 5000 cm^3), we have:\n\nπr^2h = 5000\n\nThe cost of the top and bottom of the container is $0.03 per square cm, and the area of the top and bottom is given by 2πr^2. The cost of the side of the container is $0.01 per square cm, and the area of the side is given by 2πrh. Therefore, the total cost of the container is given by:\n\nC = 0.03(2πr^2) + 0.01(2πrh)\n\nWe want to minimize this cost function. To do this, we can first eliminate one of the variables by solving the volume equation for h:\n\nh = 5000 / (πr^2)\n\nNow substitute this expression for h into the cost function:\n\nC = 0.03(2πr^2) + 0.01(2πr * (5000 / (πr^2)))\n\nSimplify the cost function:\n\nC = 0.06πr^2 + 10000/r\n\nNow we can find the minimum cost by taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndC/dr = 0.12πr - 10000/r^2 = 0\n\nTo solve for r, multiply both sides by r^2:\n\n0.12πr^3 - 10000 = 0\n\nNow divide by 0.12π:\n\nr^3 = 10000 / (0.12π)\n\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\nr = (10000 / (0.12π))^(1/3)\n\nr ≈ 6.83 cm\n\nNow we can find the height by substituting the value of r back into the equation for h:\n\nh = 5000 / (π(6.83)^2)\n\nh ≈ 10.66 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions of the container that will minimize the cost of materials are approximately r = 6.83 cm and h = 10.66 cm."
