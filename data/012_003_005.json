    "message_2": "An independent set of vertices in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between them). To find the maximum independent set, we want to find the largest set of vertices that satisfy this condition.\n\nWe can use the fact that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, we have:\n\nsum(degrees) = 2 * 14 = 28\n\nSince there are 9 vertices, the average degree of a vertex in the graph is:\n\naverage_degree = 28 / 9 ≈ 3.11\n\nNow, let's consider the complementary graph, which has the same vertices but the edges are reversed (i.e., if there is an edge between two vertices in the original graph, there is no edge between them in the complementary graph, and vice versa). The complementary graph will have:\n\ntotal_edges_complementary = (9 * (9 - 1) / 2) - 14 = 36 - 14 = 22 edges\n\nThe average degree of a vertex in the complementary graph is:\n\naverage_degree_complementary = 2 * 22 / 9 ≈ 4.89\n\nA clique in the complementary graph is a set of vertices that are all connected to each other. The size of the maximum clique in the complementary graph is equal to the size of the maximum independent set in the original graph. This is because if there is a clique of size k in the complementary graph, it means that there is a set of k vertices in the original graph that are not connected to each other.\n\nTo find the maximum clique size, we can use the Turán's theorem, which states that a graph with n vertices and no clique of size k+1 has at most (k-1)n^2 / (2k) edges. In our case, we want to find the smallest k such that:\n\n22 <= (k-1) * 9^2 / (2k)\n\nRearranging the inequality, we get:\n\n44k <= (k-1) * 81\n\nNow, we can test different values of k to find the smallest one that satisfies the inequality:\n\nFor k = 2: 88 <= 0 (False)\nFor k = 3: 132 <= 162 (True)\n\nSo, the smallest value of k that satisfies the inequality is 3. This means that the maximum clique size in the complementary graph is 3, and therefore, the maximum independent set size in the original graph is also 3."
