    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 105035041 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) that maps integers to integers. A common choice is f(x) = x^2 + 1.\n2. Choose a random starting point x_0.\n3. Iterate the function to generate a sequence of numbers: x_1 = f(x_0), x_2 = f(x_1), and so on.\n4. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difference between two numbers in the sequence and the given number (105035041). If the GCD is not 1 or the given number, it is a non-trivial factor.\n\nLet's start with x_0 = 2 and f(x) = x^2 + 1.\n\n1. x_1 = f(x_0) = 2^2 + 1 = 5\n2. x_2 = f(x_1) = 5^2 + 1 = 26\n3. GCD(x_2 - x_1, 105035041) = GCD(26 - 5, 105035041) = GCD(21, 105035041)\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:\n\n105035041 = 21 * 5001669 + 0\n\nSo, GCD(21, 105035041) = 21.\n\nSince 21 is not 1 or the given number (105035041), it is a non-trivial factor of 105035041. Now we need to check if 21 is a prime number. Since 21 = 3 * 7, it is not prime. The smallest prime factor of 21 is 3.\n\nTherefore, the smallest prime factor of 105035041 is 3."
