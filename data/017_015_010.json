    "message_2": "Since every group of order 24 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C24, the alternating group A5, or one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24, we can list all the possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 24 as follows:\n\n1. C24: The cyclic group of order 24.\n\n2. A5: The alternating group of degree 5 is not of order 24, so it is not a possible isomorphism class for groups of order 24.\n\nNow, we consider the five non-abelian groups of order 24:\n\n3. C6 x S2: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 6 and the symmetric group of degree 2.\n\n4. C3 x S3: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 3 and the symmetric group of degree 3.\n\n5. C2 x S4: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 2 and the symmetric group of degree 4.\n\n6. C4 x D3: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 4 and the dihedral group of order 6.\n\n7. C2 x Q12: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 2 and the quaternion group of order 12.\n\nSo, there are a total of 6 possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 24: C24, C6 x S2, C3 x S3, C2 x S4, C4 x D3, and C2 x Q12."
