    "message_1": "A manufacturer of light bulbs claims that their bulbs last at least 800 hours, but a consumer group suspects that the true average lifetime is less. A sample of 50 bulbs is selected and their average lifetime is found to be 780 hours with a standard deviation of 40 hours. Is there enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true average lifetime of the bulbs is at least 800 hours, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true average lifetime is less than 800 hours.\n\nH0: μ ≥ 800\nH1: μ < 800\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 780 hours\nSample standard deviation (s) = 40 hours\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (780 - 800) / (40 / √50)\nt = -20 / (40 / √50)\nt = -20 / (40 / 7.071)\nt = -20 / 5.657\nt = -3.54\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1) and a significance level of 0.05. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.68.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-3.54) is less than the critical t-value (-1.68), we reject the null hypothesis. There is enough evidence at a 0.05 significance level to reject the manufacturer's claim that their bulbs last at least 800 hours."
