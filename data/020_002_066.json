    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B, and has limited resources of $200 for labor and 750 for materials. Each unit of product A requires 4 hours of labor and $50 of materials, while each unit of product B requires 5 hours of labor and $75 of materials. The company earns a profit of $100 for each unit of product A sold and $150 for each unit of product B sold. What are the optimal production quantities of products A and B to maximize the company's profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The constraints for labor and materials can be represented as:\n\n4x + 5y ≤ 200 (labor constraint)\n50x + 75y ≤ 750 (materials constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 100x + 150y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n1. Labor constraint:\n\n4x + 5y ≤ 200\ny ≤ (200 - 4x) / 5\n\n2. Materials constraint:\n\n50x + 75y ≤ 750\ny ≤ (750 - 50x) / 75\n\nNow we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations:\n\n1. Intersection of labor constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n\n4x + 5(0) = 200\nx = 50\n\nVertex: (50, 0)\n\n2. Intersection of labor constraint and materials constraint:\n\n4x + 5y = 200\n50x + 75y = 750\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nx = 30\ny = 8\n\nVertex: (30, 8)\n\n3. Intersection of materials constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n\n50(0) + 75y = 750\ny = 10\n\nVertex: (0, 10)\n\nNow we will evaluate the objective function P = 100x + 150y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(50, 0) = 100(50) + 150(0) = 5000\n2. P(30, 8) = 100(30) + 150(8) = 3000 + 1200 = 4200\n3. P(0, 10) = 100(0) + 150(10) = 1500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex (50, 0), with a profit of $5000. Therefore, the optimal production quantities are 50 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
