    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nWe have the base (8 units) and the height (10 units), but we need to find the angle between them. To do this, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse and then use the inverse trigonometric functions to find the angle.\n\nLet's call the angle between the base and the height \"θ\". We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse (c):\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n8^2 + 10^2 = c^2\n64 + 100 = c^2\n164 = c^2\nc = √164 ≈ 12.81\n\nNow that we have the length of the hypotenuse, we can use the inverse trigonometric functions to find the angle θ. We can use the sine function:\n\nsin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse\nsin(θ) = 10/12.81\nθ = arcsin(10/12.81) ≈ 53.13°\n\nNow that we have the angle, we can use the formula to find the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\nArea = (1/2) * 8 * 10 * sin(53.13°)\nArea = 4 * 10 * 0.8\nArea = 40 * 0.8\nArea = 32 square units\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 32 square units."
