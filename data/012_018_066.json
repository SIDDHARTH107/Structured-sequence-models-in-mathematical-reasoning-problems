    "message_2": "To disconnect a simple undirected graph G with seven vertices, we need to remove enough edges such that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices.\n\nA complete graph with seven vertices (K7) has 21 edges. Since our graph G has only 10 edges, it is not a complete graph. Let's consider the minimum number of edges needed to keep the graph connected. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and for a tree with n vertices, there are n-1 edges. In our case, with seven vertices, a tree would have 6 edges.\n\nNow, let's consider the additional edges in our graph G. We have 10 - 6 = 4 extra edges. These extra edges can create cycles in the graph. To disconnect the graph, we need to break these cycles.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, each of the 4 extra edges creates a separate cycle. In this case, we would need to remove all 4 extra edges to disconnect the graph. Therefore, the minimum number of edges whose removal from G will disconnect G is 4."
