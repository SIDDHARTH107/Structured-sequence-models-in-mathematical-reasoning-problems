    "message_1": "What is the probability that the stock price of company XYZ will increase by at least 10% in the next 3 months based on historical data?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot provide you with a specific probability without access to the historical data of company XYZ's stock price. However, I can guide you on how to calculate the probability based on the data you have.\n\n1. Collect historical data: Gather the stock price data of company XYZ for a significant period, preferably several years. You can obtain this data from financial websites or databases.\n\n2. Determine the time intervals: Since you are interested in the next 3 months, divide the historical data into 3-month intervals.\n\n3. Calculate the returns: For each 3-month interval, calculate the percentage change in the stock price. This can be done using the formula:\n\nReturn = (Ending Price - Starting Price) / Starting Price * 100\n\n4. Count the intervals with at least a 10% increase: Count the number of 3-month intervals where the stock price increased by at least 10%.\n\n5. Calculate the probability: Divide the number of intervals with at least a 10% increase by the total number of intervals. This will give you the probability of the stock price increasing by at least 10% in the next 3 months based on historical data.\n\nProbability = (Number of intervals with at least a 10% increase) / (Total number of intervals)\n\nKeep in mind that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and other factors may influence the stock price. This calculation only provides an estimate based on historical data."
