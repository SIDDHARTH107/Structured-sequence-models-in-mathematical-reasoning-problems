    "message_1": "In a Traveler's Dilemma game, two travelers must independently choose how much to declare for the worth of a lost piece of luggage, with the goal of minimizing the difference between their declared values and the true value. The payoff for each traveler depends on the lowest declared value.\n\nSuppose the true value of the lost luggage is $1000. If traveler A declares a value of $800, what is the optimal amount that traveler B should declare to maximize their payoff?",
    "message_2": "In the Traveler's Dilemma game, the payoff for each traveler depends on the lowest declared value. If traveler A declares a value of $800, traveler B should declare a value of $801. This way, traveler B's declared value is higher than traveler A's, but still close to the true value of the lost luggage. By declaring $801, traveler B will maximize their payoff while minimizing the difference between their declared value and the true value of the lost luggage."
