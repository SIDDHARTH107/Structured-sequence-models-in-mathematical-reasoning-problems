    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items, n! is the factorial of n (the product of all positive integers up to n), and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nIn this case, we want to choose a committee of 3 people (k = 3) from a group of 8 people (n = 8). So, we will plug these values into the formula:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!5!)\n\nNow, we will calculate the factorials:\n\n8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nNow, we will plug these values back into the formula:\n\nC(8, 3) = 40,320 / (6 × 120)\n\nC(8, 3) = 40,320 / 720\n\nC(8, 3) = 56\n\nSo, there are 56 ways to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 8 if the order in which they are chosen does not matter."
