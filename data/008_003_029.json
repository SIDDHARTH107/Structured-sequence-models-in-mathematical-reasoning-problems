    "message_2": "To determine the rank of the matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to bring the matrix to its row echelon form. Let's perform the following row operations:\n\n1. Add 2 times Row 1 to Row 2 to eliminate the -2 in the second row.\n2. Subtract 3 times Row 1 from Row 3 to eliminate the 3 in the third row.\n3. Subtract 4 times Row 1 from Row 4 to eliminate the 4 in the fourth row.\n\nAfter performing these operations, we get:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    1  & 3  & -4 \\\\\n    0  & 2  & -2 \\\\\n    0  & -2 & 5 \\\\\n    0  & -2 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, let's perform the following row operations:\n\n1. Multiply Row 2 by 1/2 to get a leading 1 in the second row.\n2. Add Row 2 to Row 3 to eliminate the -2 in the third row.\n3. Add Row 2 to Row 4 to eliminate the -2 in the fourth row.\n\nAfter performing these operations, we get:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    1  & 3  & -4 \\\\\n    0  & 1  & -1 \\\\\n    0  & 0  & 4 \\\\\n    0  & 0  & 5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nFinally, let's perform the following row operations:\n\n1. Subtract 3 times Row 2 from Row 1 to eliminate the 3 in the first row.\n2. Add 1/4 times Row 3 to Row 2 to eliminate the -1 in the second row.\n3. Subtract 5/4 times Row 3 from Row 4 to eliminate the 5 in the fourth row.\n\nAfter performing these operations, we get:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    1  & 0  & 1 \\\\\n    0  & 1  & 0 \\\\\n    0  & 0  & 1 \\\\\n    0  & 0  & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we can see that the matrix is in row echelon form. The rank of a matrix is the number of non-zero rows in its row echelon form. In this case, there are 3 non-zero rows, so the rank of matrix A is 3."
