    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 187. Since 187 = 11 * 17, where 11 and 17 are distinct prime numbers, we can apply the Sylow theorems to analyze the structure of G.\n\nFirst, let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G. By Sylow's third theorem, we know that n_p divides the order of G and n_p is congruent to 1 modulo p. \n\nFor p = 11, we have n_11 | 17, and n_11 ≡ 1 (mod 11). The only divisors of 17 are 1 and 17, and since 17 ≢ 1 (mod 11), we must have n_11 = 1. This means there is a unique Sylow 11-subgroup of G, which we will denote by P.\n\nSimilarly, for p = 17, we have n_17 | 11, and n_17 ≡ 1 (mod 17). The only divisors of 11 are 1 and 11, and since 11 ≢ 1 (mod 17), we must have n_17 = 1. This means there is a unique Sylow 17-subgroup of G, which we will denote by Q.\n\nSince P and Q are the unique Sylow subgroups of their respective orders, they must be normal in G. Now, we can consider the product PQ, which is a subgroup of G. By the product formula for the orders of subgroups, we have:\n\n|PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q|\n\nSince P and Q are groups of prime order, their intersection can only be the identity element. Thus, |P ∩ Q| = 1, and |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 11 * 17 = 187.\n\nSince |PQ| = |G|, we have that PQ = G. Furthermore, since P and Q are both normal in G, we can conclude that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q:\n\nG ≅ P × Q\n\nSince P and Q are cyclic groups of orders 11 and 17, respectively (as they are groups of prime order), we have shown that G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 11 and 17."
