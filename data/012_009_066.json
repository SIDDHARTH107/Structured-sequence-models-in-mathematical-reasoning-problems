    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible to draw a simple graph with the given degree sequence {2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3}. Here's one way to draw the graph:\n\n1. Label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n2. Connect vertex A to vertices D and E (A has degree 2).\n3. Connect vertex B to vertices D and F (B has degree 2).\n4. Connect vertex C to vertices E and F (C has degree 2).\n5. Connect vertex D to vertex F (D has degree 3).\n6. Connect vertex E to vertex B (E has degree 3).\n7. Connect vertex F to vertex A (F has degree 3).\n\nThe resulting graph has the desired degree sequence and is a simple graph."
