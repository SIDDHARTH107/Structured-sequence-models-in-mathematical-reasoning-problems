Find the rate of heat transfer through the plate if the surfaces are maintained at constant temperatures of 300 K and 200 K. Use Fourier transform to solve.",
    "message_2": "To find the rate of heat transfer through the plate, we need to determine the heat flux (q) at the surfaces of the plate. According to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the heat flux is given by:\n\nq = -k * (dT/dx)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity (50 W/mK) and dT/dx is the temperature gradient with respect to the x-coordinate.\n\nFirst, we need to find the temperature gradient dT/dx:\n\nT(x) = 250 sin(10πx)\ndT/dx = 250 * 10π * cos(10πx)\n\nNow, we need to find the heat flux at the surfaces of the plate. The plate has a thickness of 2 cm (0.02 m), so we need to evaluate the heat flux at x = 0 and x = 0.02.\n\nAt x = 0:\ndT/dx = 250 * 10π * cos(10π * 0) = 250 * 10π\nq = -k * (dT/dx) = -50 * (250 * 10π) = -12500π W/m²\n\nAt x = 0.02:\ndT/dx = 250 * 10π * cos(10π * 0.02) = 250 * 10π * cos(0.2π) = 250 * 10π * (-1)\nq = -k * (dT/dx) = -50 * (250 * 10π * (-1)) = 12500π W/m²\n\nSince the surfaces are maintained at constant temperatures of 300 K and 200 K, the heat transfer through the plate is steady. Therefore, the rate of heat transfer through the plate is the same at both surfaces:\n\nRate of heat transfer = q = 12500π W/m²"
