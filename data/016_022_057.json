    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. After each iteration, the number of black triangles (or \"holes\") increases.\n\nAfter the first iteration, there is 1 black triangle.\nAfter the second iteration, there are 4 black triangles.\nAfter the third iteration, there are 16 black triangles.\nAfter the fourth iteration, there are 64 black triangles.\n\nTo find the total number of black triangles after the 5th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of black triangles = 4^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nSo, after the 5th iteration:\n\nNumber of black triangles = 4^5 = 1024\n\nThere are 1024 black triangles in a Sierpinski pyramid after its 5th iteration."
