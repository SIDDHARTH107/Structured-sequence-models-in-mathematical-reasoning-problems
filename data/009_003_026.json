    "message_1": "Given a metal plate of thickness 2 cm with thermal diffusivity of 0.01 m^2/s, the initial temperature of the plate is 100°C and it is suddenly cooled on one side to a constant temperature of 20°C. Find the temperature distribution in the metal plate after 30 seconds. Assume that the plate is thermally insulated on all sides except the cooled side. Solve the problem using heat transfer and diffusion equations.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, also known as the diffusion equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x is the distance from the cooled side of the plate.\n\nSince the plate is thermally insulated on all sides except the cooled side, we can apply the following boundary conditions:\n\n1. T(x, 0) = 100°C (initial temperature)\n2. T(0, t) = 20°C (cooled side temperature)\n3. ∂T/∂x (2 cm, t) = 0 (insulated side)\n\nTo solve the diffusion equation with these boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x) * Θ(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the diffusion equation, we get:\n\nX(x) * dΘ(t)/dt = α * Θ(t) * d²X(x)/dx²\n\nDividing both sides by α * X(x) * Θ(t), we obtain:\n\n(dΘ(t)/dt) / (α * Θ(t)) = (d²X(x)/dx²) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on the position, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nd²X(x)/dx² = -λ² * X(x)\ndΘ(t)/dt = -α * λ² * Θ(t)\n\nSolving the first equation, we get the general solution:\n\nX(x) = A * cos(λx) + B * sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary condition T(0, t) = 20°C, we get:\n\n20 = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0)\nA = 20\n\nNow, applying the boundary condition ∂T/∂x (2 cm, t) = 0, we get:\n\n0 = -20 * λ * sin(λ * 2 cm) + B * λ * cos(λ * 2 cm)\n\nSince B * λ ≠ 0, we must have:\n\nsin(λ * 2 cm) = 0\n\nThis implies that λ * 2 cm = n * π, where n is an integer. Thus, λ = n * π / 2 cm.\n\nNow, we can write the solution for X(x) as:\n\nX(x) = 20 * cos(n * π * x / 2 cm)\n\nSolving the second ordinary differential equation, we get the general solution:\n\nΘ(t) = C * e^(-α * λ² * t)\n\nSubstituting λ = n * π / 2 cm, we get:\n\nΘ(t) = C * e^(-α * (n * π / 2 cm)² * t)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for T(x, t) as:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ [C_n * e^(-α * (n * π / 2 cm)² * t) * cos(n * π * x / 2 cm)]\n\nTo find the coefficients C_n, we use the initial condition T(x, 0) = 100°C:\n\n100 = Σ [C_n * cos(n * π * x / 2 cm)]\n\nThis is a Fourier cosine series, and we can find the coefficients C_n using the following formula:\n\nC_n = (2 / 2 cm) * ∫[100 * cos(n * π * x / 2 cm)] dx, from 0 to 2 cm\n\nCalculating the coefficients C_n and substituting them into the general solution, we can find the temperature distribution T(x, t) in the metal plate after 30 seconds. Note that in practice, you would truncate the series after a certain number of terms to get an approximate solution."
