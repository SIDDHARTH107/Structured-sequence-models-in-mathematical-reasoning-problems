    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. Then, we will use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n| 2  3  1 | 10\n| 4  5  2 | 20\n| 6  7  8 | 30\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\nR3 = R3 - 3 * R1\n\n|  2  3  1 | 10\n|  0 -1  0 |  0\n|  0 -2  5 |  0\n\nStep 2: Swap R2 and R3 to have a non-zero element in the second row, second column.\n\n|  2  3  1 | 10\n|  0 -2  5 |  0\n|  0 -1  0 |  0\n\nStep 3: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - 1/2 * R2\n\n|  2  3  1 | 10\n|  0 -2  5 |  0\n|  0  0 -5 |  0\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 4: Solve for z.\n\n-5z = 0\nz = 0\n\nStep 5: Solve for y.\n\n-2y + 5z = 0\n-2y = 0\ny = 0\n\nStep 6: Solve for x.\n\n2x + 3y + z = 10\n2x = 10\nx = 5\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 5, y = 0, and z = 0."
