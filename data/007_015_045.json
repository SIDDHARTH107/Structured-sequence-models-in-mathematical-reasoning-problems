    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime number is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. To find the smallest Mersenne prime, we can start by testing the smallest prime numbers for p.\n\n1. If p = 2 (the smallest prime number), then the Mersenne number is 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3. Since 3 is a prime number, the smallest Mersenne prime number is 3.\n\nSo, the smallest Mersenne prime number is 3, which can be written as 2^2 - 1."
