    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In a level one Menger sponge, we remove the central cube from each face and the central cube from the interior, leaving 20 smaller cubes.\n\nTo construct a level two Menger sponge, we apply the same process to each of the 20 smaller cubes from the level one sponge. This means we have 20 * 20 = 400 smaller cubes.\n\nFinally, to construct a level three Menger sponge, we apply the same process to each of the 400 smaller cubes from the level two sponge. This means we have 20 * 400 = 8,000 smaller cubes in a level three Menger sponge."
