    "message_1": "I apologize, but it's not possible to create a precise numerical problem based on the subtopic Paraconsistent logic. Paraconsistent logic is a non-classical logic that can allow for contradictions to exist within a system without leading to triviality. It's not typically used to solve numerical problems or equations. If you have any other mathematical topics you would like a question on, I would be happy to help.",
