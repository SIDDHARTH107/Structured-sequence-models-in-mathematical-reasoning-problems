    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, meaning it covers every point in a square. It is constructed by iteratively dividing each line segment into thirds and turning at right angles. The length of the Peano curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (3^n) * (Initial Length) / 2^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, we are asked to find the length of the Peano curve after 7 iterations, and each line segment is divided into thirds and turned at right angles. Let's assume the initial length of the curve is 1 unit.\n\nLength = (3^7) * (1) / 2^7\nLength = (2187) / 128\nLength = 17.0859375 units\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve after 7 iterations is approximately 17.0859375 units."
