    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curve y = x^2 and the x-axis from x = 2 to x = 5, we need to integrate the function y = x^2 with respect to x from 2 to 5.\n\nThe integral of x^2 with respect to x is (1/3)x^3 + C, where C is the constant of integration. However, since we are finding a definite integral, we don't need to worry about the constant.\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the bounds:\n\n(1/3)(5^3) - (1/3)(2^3) = (1/3)(125 - 8) = (1/3)(117) = 39.\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curve y = x^2 and the x-axis from x = 2 to x = 5 is 39 square units."
