    "message_2": "To find the resultant velocity and direction of the plane using the dot product of two vectors, we first need to represent the velocities of the plane and the wind as vectors. Let's denote the velocity of the plane as vector P and the velocity of the wind as vector W.\n\nVector P = <200, 0> (since the plane is flying towards the east)\nVector W = <0, 50> (since the wind is blowing towards the north)\n\nNow, we need to find the resultant velocity vector R, which is the sum of the two vectors P and W.\n\nVector R = Vector P + Vector W = <200, 0> + <0, 50> = <200, 50>\n\nNow, we need to find the magnitude of the resultant vector R, which represents the resultant velocity.\n\nMagnitude of R = √(200^2 + 50^2) = √(40000 + 2500) = √42500 ≈ 206.16 km/h\n\nNow, let's find the direction of the resultant vector R. We can use the arctangent function to find the angle θ between the resultant vector and the eastward direction (x-axis).\n\nθ = arctan(opposite/adjacent) = arctan(50/200) = arctan(0.25) ≈ 14.04°\n\nSo, the resultant velocity of the plane is approximately 206.16 km/h, and its direction is approximately 14.04° north of east.\n\nNote: The dot product of two vectors is not used in this problem, as it is used to find the angle between two vectors or the projection of one vector onto another. In this problem, we are finding the resultant velocity and direction, which requires vector addition and trigonometry."
