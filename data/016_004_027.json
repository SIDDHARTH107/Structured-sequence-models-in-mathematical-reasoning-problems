    "message_2": "The largest number of iterations required to determine whether a given complex number belongs to the Mandelbrot set, with an escape radius of 2 and a maximum iteration count of 1000, would be 1000 iterations. \n\nIf a complex number does not escape the radius of 2 within 1000 iterations, it is considered to be part of the Mandelbrot set. However, if it escapes before reaching 1000 iterations, you can conclude that it does not belong to the set. In the worst-case scenario, you would need to perform all 1000 iterations to determine if the complex number is part of the Mandelbrot set."
