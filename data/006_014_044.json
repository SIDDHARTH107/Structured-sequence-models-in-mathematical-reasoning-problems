    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (failures in this case) in n trials (components)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (failure) for each trial (component)\n- n is the number of trials (components)\n- k is the number of successes (failures) we want to find the probability for\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 5 (5 components)\n- k = 2 (we want to find the probability of exactly 2 components failing)\n- p = 0.02 (probability of failure for each component)\n\nFirst, let's find C(n, k) = C(5, 2):\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!)\n         = 5! / (2! * 3!)\n         = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1))\n         = 120 / (2 * 6)\n         = 120 / 12\n         = 10\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(5, 2) * 0.02^2 * (1-0.02)^(5-2)\n         = 10 * 0.02^2 * 0.98^3\n         = 10 * 0.0004 * 0.941192\n         â‰ˆ 0.003764\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 2 components fail in this system is approximately 0.003764 or 0.3764%."
