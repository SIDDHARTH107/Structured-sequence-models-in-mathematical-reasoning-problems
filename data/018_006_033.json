    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', can be found by comparing the elements of U and A:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements of both sets. In this case, we need to show that A ∪ A' = U.\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nComparing the elements of A ∪ A' and U, we can see that they are the same:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = U"
