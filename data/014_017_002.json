    "message_1": "Using frequency analysis, decrypt the following encrypted message: \n\nXOCXDJQTSQTSYAKXAQTSYEQONCBF\n\nAssuming that the letter E is the most commonly used letter in the English alphabet, what letter would you guess represents E in this encryption? How did you arrive at your guess?",
    "message_2": "To perform frequency analysis, we will first count the occurrences of each letter in the encrypted message:\n\nX: 3, O: 3, C: 2, D: 1, J: 1, Q: 4, T: 4, S: 4, Y: 2, A: 3, K: 1, E: 1, N: 1, B: 1, F: 1\n\nNow, we will find the most frequent letter in the encrypted message. In this case, we have three letters with the highest frequency: Q, T, and S, each occurring 4 times.\n\nSince E is the most commonly used letter in the English alphabet, we can guess that one of these three letters (Q, T, or S) represents E in the encryption. To make an educated guess, we can look at the context of the message and try to find common patterns or words. However, without any additional information, it's difficult to determine which of these three letters represents E with certainty."
