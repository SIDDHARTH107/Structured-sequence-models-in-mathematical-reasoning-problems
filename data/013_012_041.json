    "message_1": "Consider a Stackelberg competition where there are two firms, Firm A and Firm B. The demand function for their product is Q = 100 - 2P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price. \n\nFirm A is the leader and Firm B is the follower. Firm A selects its output first, and Firm B selects its output second. The cost function for both firms is C(Q) = 10Q.\n\nWhat quantity will each firm produce and what price will each firm charge, given that Firm A wants to maximize its profits and Firm B wants to maximize its market share?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the inverse demand function by solving for P in terms of Q:\n\nQ = 100 - 2P\n2P = 100 - Q\nP = (100 - Q) / 2\n\nNow, let's denote the quantity produced by Firm A as qA and the quantity produced by Firm B as qB. The total quantity in the market is Q = qA + qB.\n\nThe revenue for Firm A is given by:\n\nR_A = P * qA = ((100 - (qA + qB)) / 2) * qA\n\nThe cost for Firm A is given by:\n\nC_A = 10 * qA\n\nThe profit for Firm A is given by:\n\nπ_A = R_A - C_A = ((100 - (qA + qB)) / 2) * qA - 10 * qA\n\nNow, let's find the reaction function for Firm B, which shows the optimal output for Firm B given Firm A's output. Firm B wants to maximize its market share, so it will produce as much as possible given the demand and Firm A's output. The reaction function for Firm B is:\n\nqB = (100 - qA) / 2\n\nNow, we will substitute this reaction function into Firm A's profit function:\n\nπ_A = ((100 - (qA + (100 - qA) / 2)) / 2) * qA - 10 * qA\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nπ_A = ((100 - qA / 2) / 2) * qA - 10 * qA\n\nNow, we will find the optimal output for Firm A by taking the first derivative of the profit function with respect to qA and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(π_A) / dqA = (100 - 3qA / 2) / 2 - 10 = 0\n\nSolve for qA:\n\n3qA / 2 = 80\nqA = 160 / 3 ≈ 53.33\n\nNow, we will find the optimal output for Firm B using the reaction function:\n\nqB = (100 - qA) / 2 = (100 - 160 / 3) / 2 ≈ 23.33\n\nNow, we will find the price that each firm will charge using the inverse demand function:\n\nP = (100 - Q) / 2 = (100 - (qA + qB)) / 2 = (100 - (53.33 + 23.33)) / 2 ≈ 11.67\n\nSo, Firm A will produce approximately 53.33 units, Firm B will produce approximately 23.33 units, and both firms will charge a price of approximately $11.67."
