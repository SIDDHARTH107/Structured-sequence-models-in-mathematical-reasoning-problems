    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of a tornado occurring in a specific region, we can use the historical data provided. \n\nIn the last 10 years, a tornado has occurred 3 times. Therefore, the probability of a tornado occurring in a given year can be calculated as:\n\n(Number of tornado occurrences) / (Total number of years) = 3 / 10 = 0.3\n\nSo, the probability of a tornado occurring in that specific region in a given year is approximately 0.3 or 30%. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate based on historical data and may not accurately predict future occurrences."
