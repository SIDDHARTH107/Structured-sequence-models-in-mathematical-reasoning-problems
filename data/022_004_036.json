    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z - 2)/(z^3 - 3z^2 + 2z), we first need to find the points where the denominator is equal to zero. Let's factor the denominator:\n\nz^3 - 3z^2 + 2z = z(z^2 - 3z + 2)\n\nNow, let's factor the quadratic term:\n\nz^2 - 3z + 2 = (z - 1)(z - 2)\n\nSo, the denominator can be factored as:\n\nz(z - 1)(z - 2)\n\nThe singularities occur when the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz(z - 1)(z - 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us three singularities: z = 0, z = 1, and z = 2.\n\nNow, let's classify each singularity. We can do this by examining the behavior of the function near each singularity.\n\n1. Singularity at z = 0:\n\nThe function can be simplified as:\n\nf(z) = (z - 2)/[z(z - 1)(z - 2)] = 1/[(z - 1)(z - 2)]\n\nAs z approaches 0, the function f(z) approaches a finite value. Therefore, the singularity at z = 0 is a removable singularity.\n\n2. Singularity at z = 1:\n\nThe function can be simplified as:\n\nf(z) = (z - 2)/[z(z - 1)(z - 2)] = z/[(z - 2)z]\n\nAs z approaches 1, the function f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the singularity at z = 1 is a pole of order 1, or a simple pole.\n\n3. Singularity at z = 2:\n\nThe function can be simplified as:\n\nf(z) = (z - 2)/[z(z - 1)(z - 2)] = 1/[z(z - 1)]\n\nAs z approaches 2, the function f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the singularity at z = 2 is a pole of order 1, or a simple pole.\n\nIn summary, the function f(z) has three singularities: a removable singularity at z = 0, and simple poles at z = 1 and z = 2."
