    "message_2": "To determine the number of tetrahedral faces in the simplicial complex, we can use the Euler characteristic formula for a simplicial complex:\n\nχ = V - E + F - T,\n\nwhere χ is the Euler characteristic, V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of triangular faces, and T is the number of tetrahedral faces.\n\nFor a simplicial complex, the Euler characteristic is always equal to 1. In this case, we have:\n\n1 = 5 - 8 + 4 - T.\n\nSolving for T, we get:\n\nT = 5 - 8 + 4 - 1 = 0.\n\nSo, there are 0 tetrahedral faces in this simplicial complex."
