    "message_1": "A student is pulling a sled at an angle of 30° above the ground with a force of 50 N. If the sled weighs 100 N, what is the projection of the force on the sled?",
    "message_2": "To find the projection of the force on the sled, we need to find the horizontal component of the force that the student is applying. We can use the cosine function to find the horizontal component of the force.\n\nThe formula to find the horizontal component of the force is:\n\nHorizontal force = Applied force × cos(angle)\n\nwhere\nApplied force = 50 N\nangle = 30°\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nangle (in radians) = (angle in degrees) × (π/180)\nangle (in radians) = 30 × (π/180) = π/6\n\nNow, we can find the horizontal component of the force:\n\nHorizontal force = 50 × cos(π/6)\nHorizontal force ≈ 50 × 0.866\nHorizontal force ≈ 43.3 N\n\nSo, the projection of the force on the sled is approximately 43.3 N."
