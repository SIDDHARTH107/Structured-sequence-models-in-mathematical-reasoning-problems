    "message_1": "Consider an auction with two bidders, bidder 1 and bidder 2. Both bidders have a valuation for the auctioned item, and their valuations are independently and uniformly distributed over the interval [0, 100]. The auction is first-price sealed-bid, meaning that each bidder submits a single bid, and the highest bidder wins the item at a price equal to their bid. If both bidders submit the same highest bid, the winner is chosen randomly.\n\nFind the optimal bidding strategy for bidder 1 in terms of expected payout, assuming bidder 2 employs the strategy to always bid their true valuation. What is the expected payout for bidder 1?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal bidding strategy for bidder 1, we need to maximize their expected payout. Let v1 be the valuation of bidder 1 and b1 be their bid. Let v2 be the valuation of bidder 2. Since bidder 2 always bids their true valuation, their bid is equal to v2.\n\nThe expected payout for bidder 1 is given by the product of the probability of winning the auction and the difference between their valuation and their bid (v1 - b1). Bidder 1 wins the auction if b1 > v2. Since v2 is uniformly distributed over [0, 100], the probability of winning the auction is given by the ratio of the length of the interval where b1 > v2 to the length of the entire interval [0, 100]. This probability is equal to b1/100.\n\nNow, we need to maximize the expected payout for bidder 1, which is given by the product of the probability of winning and the difference between their valuation and their bid:\n\nExpected payout = (b1/100) * (v1 - b1)\n\nTo maximize this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to b1 and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Expected payout)/db1 = (1/100) * (v1 - 2b1) = 0\n\nSolving for b1, we get:\n\nb1 = v1/2\n\nSo, the optimal bidding strategy for bidder 1 is to bid half of their valuation. Now, let's calculate the expected payout for bidder 1 using this strategy.\n\nExpected payout = (b1/100) * (v1 - b1) = ((v1/2)/100) * (v1 - v1/2) = (v1^2/400) - (v1^3/800)\n\nSince v1 is uniformly distributed over [0, 100], we need to take the average value of the expected payout over this interval:\n\nExpected payout = (1/100) * ∫[(v1^2/400) - (v1^3/800)]dv1 from 0 to 100\n\n= (1/100) * [ (v1^3/1200) - (v1^4/3200) ] from 0 to 100\n\n= (1/100) * [(100^3/1200) - (100^4/3200)]\n\n= (1/100) * (833333.33 - 3125000)\n\n= (1/100) * (-2291666.67)\n\n= -22916.67\n\nHowever, the expected payout cannot be negative. This is because we made an error in calculating the expected payout. The correct formula for the expected payout should be:\n\nExpected payout = (b1/100) * (v1 - b1) = ((v1/2)/100) * (v1/2) = (v1^2/400)\n\nNow, let's calculate the average value of the expected payout over the interval [0, 100]:\n\nExpected payout = (1/100) * ∫(v1^2/400)dv1 from 0 to 100\n\n= (1/100) * (v1^3/1200) from 0 to 100\n\n= (1/100) * (100^3/1200)\n\n= (1/100) * 833333.33\n\n= 8333.33\n\nSo, the expected payout for bidder 1 using the optimal bidding strategy is 8333.33."
