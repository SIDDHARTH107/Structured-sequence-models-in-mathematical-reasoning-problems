    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x/(1-x^2) over the interval [-1, 1], we first need to determine if the function is even, odd, or neither. Since f(-x) = -x/(1-(-x)^2) = -f(x), the function is odd. Therefore, we only need to find the sine coefficients in the Fourier series.\n\nThe Fourier series of an odd function is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑[b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the length of the interval, which in this case is 1. So, L = 1.\n\nTo find the coefficients b_n, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from -L to L\n\nFor our function, this becomes:\n\nb_n = 2 * ∫[x/(1-x^2) * sin(nπx) dx] from -1 to 1\n\nNow, we need to solve this integral. We can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x/(1-x^2) and dv = sin(nπx) dx\nThen, du = (1 + x^2) / (1 - x^2)^2 dx and v = -1/(nπ) * cos(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫[u * dv] = u * v - ∫[v * du]\n\nSo, b_n = 2 * {[-x/(1-x^2) * (-1/(nπ) * cos(nπx))]|(-1)^1 - ∫[-1/(nπ) * cos(nπx) * (1 + x^2) / (1 - x^2)^2 dx] from -1 to 1}\n\nNow, we evaluate the first term:\n\n-x/(1-x^2) * (-1/(nπ) * cos(nπx)) at x = 1: 0\n-x/(1-x^2) * (-1/(nπ) * cos(nπx)) at x = -1: 0\n\nSo, the first term is 0.\n\nNow, we need to solve the remaining integral:\n\nb_n = 2 * ∫[1/(nπ) * cos(nπx) * (1 + x^2) / (1 - x^2)^2 dx] from -1 to 1\n\nUnfortunately, this integral does not have a simple closed-form solution. However, we can still express the Fourier series of the function using the integral form of the coefficients:\n\nf(x) = ∑[2 * ∫[1/(nπ) * cos(nπx) * (1 + x^2) / (1 - x^2)^2 dx] from -1 to 1 * sin(nπx)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = x/(1-x^2) over the interval [-1, 1]."
