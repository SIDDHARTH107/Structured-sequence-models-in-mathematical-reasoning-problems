    "message_2": "To determine the probability of survival for this group after 2 years, we can use the exponential survival function, which assumes a constant hazard rate. The exponential survival function is given by:\n\nS(t) = e^(-λt)\n\nwhere S(t) is the survival probability at time t, λ is the hazard rate, and t is the time (in years, in this case).\n\nFirst, we need to find the hazard rate (λ). We know that after 1 year, 60 out of 100 people are still alive. So, the survival probability after 1 year is:\n\nS(1) = 60/100 = 0.6\n\nNow, we can use the survival function to find the hazard rate:\n\n0.6 = e^(-λ * 1)\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.6) = -λ\n\nλ = -ln(0.6) ≈ 0.5108\n\nNow that we have the hazard rate, we can find the survival probability after 2 years:\n\nS(2) = e^(-0.5108 * 2) ≈ e^(-1.0216) ≈ 0.36\n\nSo, the probability of survival for this group after 2 years, assuming a constant hazard rate, is approximately 0.36 or 36%."
