    "message_2": "First, let's estimate the derivative of f(x) = x^2 at x = 1.5 using the forward difference method with step size h = 0.1.\n\nThe forward difference method is given by the formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nFor x = 1.5 and h = 0.1, we have:\n\nf'(1.5) ≈ (f(1.5 + 0.1) - f(1.5)) / 0.1\nf'(1.5) ≈ (f(1.6) - f(1.5)) / 0.1\nf'(1.5) ≈ ((1.6)^2 - (1.5)^2) / 0.1\nf'(1.5) ≈ (2.56 - 2.25) / 0.1\nf'(1.5) ≈ 0.31 / 0.1\nf'(1.5) ≈ 3.1\n\nNow, let's approximate the integral of f(x) = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 1 using the trapezoidal rule with step size h = 0.1.\n\nThe trapezoidal rule is given by the formula:\n\n∫f(x)dx ≈ h * (0.5 * (f(x_0) + f(x_n)) + Σf(x_i))\n\nwhere x_0 = 0, x_n = 1, and x_i are the intermediate points with step size h = 0.1.\n\nWe have 10 intervals, so we need to calculate the function values at these points:\n\nx_0 = 0, x_1 = 0.1, x_2 = 0.2, ..., x_10 = 1\n\nNow, let's apply the trapezoidal rule:\n\n∫f(x)dx ≈ 0.1 * (0.5 * (f(0) + f(1)) + (f(0.1) + f(0.2) + ... + f(0.9)))\n∫f(x)dx ≈ 0.1 * (0.5 * (0 + 1) + (0.01 + 0.04 + 0.09 + 0.16 + 0.25 + 0.36 + 0.49 + 0.64 + 0.81))\n∫f(x)dx ≈ 0.1 * (0.5 + 2.55)\n∫f(x)dx ≈ 0.1 * 3.05\n∫f(x)dx ≈ 0.305\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = x^2 at x = 1.5 using the forward difference method is approximately 3.1, and the integral of f(x) = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 1 using the trapezoidal rule is approximately 0.305."
