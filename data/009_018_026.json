    "message_2": "a) To find the equilibrium points, we need to find the values of y for which dy/dx = 0. So, we set the right-hand side of the equation to zero:\n\nx(1-y) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied when either x = 0 or y = 1. However, since we are looking for equilibrium points in terms of y, we only consider the case when y = 1. So, there is one equilibrium point: y = 1.\n\nb) To determine the stability of the equilibrium point, we need to analyze the sign of dy/dx near the equilibrium point. If dy/dx is positive, then the solutions will move away from the equilibrium point, making it unstable. If dy/dx is negative, then the solutions will move towards the equilibrium point, making it stable.\n\nLet's analyze the sign of dy/dx near y = 1:\n\ndy/dx = x(1-y)\n\nWhen y < 1, we have 1-y > 0. In this case, the sign of dy/dx depends on the sign of x. If x > 0, then dy/dx > 0, and if x < 0, then dy/dx < 0.\n\nWhen y > 1, we have 1-y < 0. In this case, the sign of dy/dx is opposite to the sign of x. If x > 0, then dy/dx < 0, and if x < 0, then dy/dx > 0.\n\nSo, the stability of the equilibrium point y = 1 depends on the value of x. It is not possible to determine the stability of the equilibrium point without more information about the behavior of x.\n\nc) To draw the phase line, we need to analyze the behavior of the solutions of the differential equation. We have already analyzed the sign of dy/dx in part (b). We can summarize the behavior as follows:\n\n- When y < 1 and x > 0, dy/dx > 0, so the solutions move away from y = 1.\n- When y < 1 and x < 0, dy/dx < 0, so the solutions move towards y = 1.\n- When y > 1 and x > 0, dy/dx < 0, so the solutions move towards y = 1.\n- When y > 1 and x < 0, dy/dx > 0, so the solutions move away from y = 1.\n\nThe phase line can be drawn as follows:\n\n- For y < 1, draw an arrow pointing to the right when x > 0 and an arrow pointing to the left when x < 0.\n- For y > 1, draw an arrow pointing to the left when x > 0 and an arrow pointing to the right when x < 0.\n\nThe phase line shows that the behavior of the solutions depends on the values of both x and y. The equilibrium point y = 1 has different stability properties depending on the value of x."
