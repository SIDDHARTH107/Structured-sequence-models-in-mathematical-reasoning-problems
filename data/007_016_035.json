    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. The first four Sophie Germain primes are:\n\n1. p = 2, since 2 is prime and 2(2) + 1 = 5 is also prime.\n2. p = 3, since 3 is prime and 2(3) + 1 = 7 is also prime.\n3. p = 5, since 5 is prime and 2(5) + 1 = 11 is also prime.\n4. p = 11, since 11 is prime and 2(11) + 1 = 23 is also prime.\n\nSo, the first four Sophie Germain primes are 2, 3, 5, and 11."
