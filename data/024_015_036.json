    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative of the given differential form ω = 2x^2y dx ∧ dy, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the coefficients with respect to the variables x, y, and z.\n\nThe exterior derivative dω is given by the following formula:\n\ndω = (∂(2x^2y) / ∂x) dx ∧ dx ∧ dy + (∂(2x^2y) / ∂y) dy ∧ dx ∧ dy + (∂(2x^2y) / ∂z) dz ∧ dx ∧ dy\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂(2x^2y) / ∂x = 4xy\n∂(2x^2y) / ∂y = 2x^2\n∂(2x^2y) / ∂z = 0 (since there is no z term in the expression)\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula:\n\ndω = (4xy) dx ∧ dx ∧ dy + (2x^2) dy ∧ dx ∧ dy + (0) dz ∧ dx ∧ dy\n\nSince the wedge product of a form with itself is always zero (dx ∧ dx = dy ∧ dy = 0), we get:\n\ndω = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of ω on the manifold M given by the plane z = 2x + y is 0."
