    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student studying geometric invariant theory:\n\nSuppose we have a group action of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{C}^*$ on the affine plane $\\mathbb{A}^2$ given by $(t,(x,y)) \\mapsto (tx, t^{-1}y)$. Consider the ring of polynomial invariants of this action, denoted by $\\mathbb{C}[x,y]^{\\mathbb{C}^*}$. Find a homogenous polynomial of degree 3 in $\\mathbb{C}[x,y]^{\\mathbb{C}^*}$ that vanishes on the locus $x^2-y^3$.",
    "message_2": "To find a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 in $\\mathbb{C}[x,y]^{\\mathbb{C}^*}$ that vanishes on the locus $x^2 - y^3$, we first need to find the invariants of the given group action. \n\nRecall that a polynomial $f(x, y)$ is invariant under the group action if $f(tx, t^{-1}y) = f(x, y)$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{C}^*$. \n\nLet's consider monomials of the form $x^ay^b$. We have:\n\n$(tx)^a(t^{-1}y)^b = t^{a-b}x^ay^b$\n\nFor this expression to be invariant, we need $a - b = 0$, which means $a = b$. Thus, the invariant monomials are of the form $x^ay^a$.\n\nNow, we want to find a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3. The only invariant monomial of degree 3 is $x^3y^3$. However, this polynomial does not vanish on the locus $x^2 - y^3$. \n\nTo find a polynomial that vanishes on the given locus, we can consider the polynomial $f(x, y) = (x^2 - y^3)(x^3y^3)$. This polynomial is homogeneous of degree 6, but we can divide it by the invariant monomial $x^3y^3$ to obtain a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3:\n\n$g(x, y) = \\frac{f(x, y)}{x^3y^3} = \\frac{(x^2 - y^3)(x^3y^3)}{x^3y^3} = x^2 - y^3$\n\nThus, the polynomial $g(x, y) = x^2 - y^3$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 in $\\mathbb{C}[x,y]^{\\mathbb{C}^*}$ that vanishes on the locus $x^2 - y^3$."
