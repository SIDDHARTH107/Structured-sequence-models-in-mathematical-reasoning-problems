    "message_1": "Suppose a company experiences a particular type of financial fraud with a probability of 0.02 in any given year. If an investor decides to invest in that company for exactly three years, what is the probability that the company will experience this particular type of financial fraud at least once during that period?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can first find the probability that the company does not experience the financial fraud in any of the three years, and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability that the company experiences the fraud at least once.\n\nThe probability that the company does not experience the financial fraud in a given year is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nFor three consecutive years, the probability that the company does not experience the financial fraud in any of those years is 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.941192.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that the company experiences the financial fraud at least once during the three-year period:\n\n1 - 0.941192 = 0.058808.\n\nSo, the probability that the company will experience this particular type of financial fraud at least once during the three-year period is approximately 0.0588 or 5.88%."
