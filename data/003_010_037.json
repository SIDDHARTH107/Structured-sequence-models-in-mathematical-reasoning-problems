    "message_1": "A student stands 20 meters away from a building and observes that the angle of elevation from the ground to the top of the building is 40 degrees. Using trigonometry, find the height of the building.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this problem, we have a right triangle formed by the ground, the building, and the line of sight from the student to the top of the building. The angle of elevation is 40 degrees, the distance from the student to the building (adjacent side) is 20 meters, and we need to find the height of the building (opposite side).\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\ntan(40 degrees) = height of the building / 20 meters\n\nTo solve for the height of the building, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 20 meters:\n\nheight of the building = 20 meters * tan(40 degrees)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\ntan(40 degrees) ≈ 0.8391\n\nSo,\n\nheight of the building ≈ 20 meters * 0.8391 ≈ 16.782 meters\n\nThe height of the building is approximately 16.782 meters."
