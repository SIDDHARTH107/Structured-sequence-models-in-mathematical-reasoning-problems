    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, width of 4 cm and height of 5 cm. What is the surface area of the prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to calculate the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the surface area (SA) of a rectangular prism is:\n\nSA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: l = 8 cm, w = 4 cm, and h = 5 cm.\n\nSA = 2(8)(4) + 2(8)(5) + 2(4)(5)\nSA = 2(32) + 2(40) + 2(20)\nSA = 64 + 80 + 40\nSA = 184 cmÂ²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 184 square centimeters."
