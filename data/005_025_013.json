    "message_1": "Let's say a supermarket chain claims that their average customer spends $50 per visit with a standard deviation of $10. A sample of 100 customers is selected, and the average spending is found to be $55. Is this enough evidence to reject the supermarket chain's claim at a 5% level of significance?",
    "message_2": "To test the supermarket chain's claim, we will perform a hypothesis test using the given information. \n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The average spending per customer is $50 (μ = 50).\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The average spending per customer is not $50 (μ ≠ 50).\n\nWe are given:\n- Sample mean (x̄) = $55\n- Population standard deviation (σ) = $10\n- Sample size (n) = 100\n- Level of significance (α) = 5% = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is large (n > 30), we can use the z-test for this problem.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean:\nSE = σ / √n = 10 / √100 = 10 / 10 = 1\n\nNext, we calculate the z-score:\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE = (55 - 50) / 1 = 5\n\nNow, we need to find the critical z-value for a two-tailed test at a 5% level of significance. We can look this up in a z-table or use a calculator:\nz_critical = ±1.96\n\nSince the calculated z-score (5) is greater than the critical z-value (1.96), we reject the null hypothesis (H0). There is enough evidence at a 5% level of significance to reject the supermarket chain's claim that the average customer spends $50 per visit. The sample data suggests that the average spending per customer is significantly different from $50."
