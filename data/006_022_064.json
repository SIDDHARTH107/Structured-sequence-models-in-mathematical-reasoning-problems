    "message_1": "A school has 200 students who are taking a final exam in Probability. If the probability of a student passing the exam is 0.8, what is the probability that at least 180 students will pass the exam?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 180 students will pass the exam, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, students passing the exam)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of students, which is 200)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of students passing the exam)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a student passing the exam, which is 0.8)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nSince we want to find the probability that at least 180 students will pass the exam, we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 180, 181, ..., 200. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nP(X >= 180) = P(X = 180) + P(X = 181) + ... + P(X = 200)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 180) = Σ [C(200, k) * 0.8^k * (1-0.8)^(200-k)] for k = 180 to 200\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 180) ≈ 0.0574\n\nSo, the probability that at least 180 students will pass the exam is approximately 0.0574 or 5.74%."
