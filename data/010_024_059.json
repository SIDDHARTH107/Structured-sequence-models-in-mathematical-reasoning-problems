    "message_1": "A hyperbolic triangle has angles measuring 60 degrees, 70 degrees and x degrees. If the hyperbolic area of this triangle is 2 square units, what is the measure of the third angle?",
    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the sum of the angles of a hyperbolic triangle is less than 180 degrees. The area of a hyperbolic triangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nwhere α, β, and γ are the angles of the triangle.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nArea = 2 square units\nα = 60 degrees\nβ = 70 degrees\n\nWe need to find the measure of the third angle, γ.\n\nUsing the formula, we have:\n\n2 = π - (60 + 70 + γ)\n\nNow, we need to convert the angles from degrees to radians:\n\n60 degrees = (60 * π) / 180 = π/3 radians\n70 degrees = (70 * π) / 180 = 7π/18 radians\n\nSubstitute the values back into the equation:\n\n2 = π - (π/3 + 7π/18 + γ)\n\nNow, we can solve for γ:\n\n2 = π - (6π/18 + 7π/18 + γ)\n2 = π - (13π/18 + γ)\n\nAdd 13π/18 to both sides:\n\n2 + 13π/18 = π - γ\n\nNow, subtract 2 from both sides:\n\n13π/18 - 2 = π - γ - 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n13π/18 - 36/18 = π - γ - 6π/3\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(13π - 36)/18 = (π - 6π)/3 - γ\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-23π + 36)/18 = -5π/3 - γ\n\nNow, add 5π/3 to both sides:\n\n(-23π + 36)/18 + 5π/3 = - γ\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-23π + 36 + 30π)/18 = - γ\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(7π + 36)/18 = - γ\n\nNow, multiply both sides by -1:\n\n(-7π - 36)/18 = γ\n\nFinally, we have the measure of the third angle in radians:\n\nγ = (-7π - 36)/18\n\nTo convert back to degrees, multiply by 180/π:\n\nγ = ((-7π - 36)/18) * (180/π)\n\nSimplify:\n\nγ = (-7 * 180 - 36 * 180) / 18\n\nγ = (-1260 - 6480) / 18\n\nγ = -7740 / 18\n\nγ ≈ -430 degrees\n\nHowever, this result is not possible for a hyperbolic triangle, as the angle should be less than 180 degrees.
