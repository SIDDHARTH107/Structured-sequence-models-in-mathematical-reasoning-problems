    "message_2": "To divide a set of 6 items into non-empty subsets, we can use the Bell number. The Bell number B(n) counts the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets. \n\nFor n = 6, the Bell number B(6) = 203.\n\nSo, there are 203 ways to divide a set of 6 items into non-empty subsets if their order within the subsets does not matter."
