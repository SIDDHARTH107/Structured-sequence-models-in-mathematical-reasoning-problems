What type of singularity does f(z) have at each of these points? Determine the residue of the function at each singularity.",
    "message_2": "To determine the type of singularity at z = 3i and z = -3i, we first need to factor the denominator:\n\nf(z) = (1 - e^z)/((z - 3i)(z + 3i))\n\nNow, let's analyze the singularities:\n\n1. Singularity at z = 3i:\n\nWe can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = g(z) / (z - 3i)\n\nwhere g(z) = (1 - e^z) / (z + 3i)\n\nNow, we need to check if g(z) is analytic at z = 3i. If it is, then the singularity is a simple pole.\n\ng(3i) = (1 - e^(3i)) / (3i + 3i) = (1 - e^(3i)) / 6i\n\nSince e^(3i) is well-defined, g(z) is analytic at z = 3i. Therefore, the singularity at z = 3i is a simple pole.\n\nTo find the residue at z = 3i, we can use the formula:\n\nRes[f(z), 3i] = g(3i) = (1 - e^(3i)) / 6i\n\n2. Singularity at z = -3i:\n\nSimilarly, we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = h(z) / (z + 3i)\n\nwhere h(z) = (1 - e^z) / (z - 3i)\n\nNow, we need to check if h(z) is analytic at z = -3i. If it is, then the singularity is a simple pole.\n\nh(-3i) = (1 - e^(-3i)) / (-3i - 3i) = (1 - e^(-3i)) / -6i\n\nSince e^(-3i) is well-defined, h(z) is analytic at z = -3i. Therefore, the singularity at z = -3i is a simple pole.\n\nTo find the residue at z = -3i, we can use the formula:\n\nRes[f(z), -3i] = h(-3i) = (1 - e^(-3i)) / -6i\n\nIn conclusion, both singularities at z = 3i and z = -3i are simple poles. The residues at these singularities are:\n\nRes[f(z), 3i] = (1 - e^(3i)) / 6i\nRes[f(z), -3i] = (1 - e^(-3i)) / -6i"
