    "message_1": "In a transportation network, the maximum flow between two vertices is given by the smallest capacity on any path between them. Consider the network below. What is the maximum flow from A to D?\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/m3udSpo.png)\n\nNote: The numbers on the edges represent the capacity of that edge.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from A to D, we will use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will iteratively find augmenting paths from A to D and update the capacities of the edges in the path until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Path: A -> B -> D\n   Residual capacities: A-B: 10-10=0, B-D: 20-10=10\n   Updated network:\n   A --10--> B --10--> D\n   |         ^\n   10        |\n   v         10\n   C --20--> E\n\n2. Path: A -> C -> E -> B -> D\n   Residual capacities: A-C: 10-10=0, C-E: 20-10=10, E-B: 10-10=0, B-D: 10-10=0\n   Updated network:\n   A --0--> B --0--> D\n   |        ^\n   0        |\n   v        0\n   C --10--> E\n\nNow, there are no more augmenting paths from A to D. The maximum flow is the sum of the flows along the paths we found, which is 10 + 10 = 20. So, the maximum flow from A to D is 20."
