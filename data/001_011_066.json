    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first eliminate the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD), which is x(x-2):\n\nx(x-2)[(3/x) + (1/(x-2))] = x(x-2)[(4/(x^2-2x))]\n\nNow, distribute the LCD to each term:\n\n3(x-2) + x = 4\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n3x - 6 + x = 4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4x - 6 = 4\n\nAdd 6 to both sides:\n\n4x = 10\n\nNow, divide by 4:\n\nx = 10/4\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nx = 5/2\n\nSo, the solution is x = 5/2."
