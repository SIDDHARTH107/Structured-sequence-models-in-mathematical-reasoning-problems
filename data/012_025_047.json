    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a closed loop on a graph where every node (vertex) is visited exactly once. Let's try to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the given graph. We can label the nodes as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I for easier reference.\n\nOne possible Hamiltonian cycle in this graph is:\n\nA → B → C → D → E → F → G → H → I → A\n\nSo, the graph does have a Hamiltonian cycle."
