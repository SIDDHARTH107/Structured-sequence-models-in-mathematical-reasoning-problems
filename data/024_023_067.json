    "message_2": "The symmetries of a sphere in 3-dimensional Euclidean space can be described by the group of orthogonal transformations that preserve the sphere. These transformations can be rotations and reflections. In the case of a sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin, the symmetries are as follows:\n\n1. Identity transformation: This is the transformation that leaves every point on the sphere unchanged.\n\n2. Rotations: A sphere has rotational symmetry about any axis passing through its center. In this case, the sphere can be rotated by any angle about any axis passing through the origin, and the sphere will remain unchanged. These rotations can be described by 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1.\n\n3. Reflections: A sphere also has reflection symmetry with respect to any plane passing through its center. In this case, the sphere can be reflected across any such plane, and the sphere will remain unchanged. These reflections can be described by 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant -1.\n\n4. Rotoreflections: These are combined operations of rotation followed by reflection. They can also be described by 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant -1.\n\nIn summary, the symmetries of a sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin in 3-dimensional Euclidean space are given by the orthogonal transformations (rotations, reflections, and rotoreflections) that preserve the sphere. These transformations form the orthogonal group O(3), which is the group of all 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1 or -1."
