The survival times (in days) for each patient are recorded and summarized in the table below.\n \n| Days survived | Number of patients |\n|---------------|--------------------|\n| 0-99          | 15                 |\n| 100-199       | 27                 |\n| 200-299       | 32                 |\n| 300-399       | 16                 |\n| 400-499       | 6                  |\n| 500-599       | 4                  |\n\nCalculate the survival probability for each patient, i.e., the probability that a patient will survive for a given number of days or more.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the survival probability for each patient, we can use the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function from lifetime data. It is defined as:\n\nS(t) = P(T > t) = ∏(1 - di/ni)\n\nwhere S(t) is the probability of survival at time t, di is the number of events (deaths) at time ti, and ni is the number of subjects at risk of the event at time ti.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of events (deaths) and the number of subjects at risk for each time interval:\n\n| Days survived | Number of patients | Events (deaths) | Subjects at risk |\n|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| 0-99          | 15                 | 15              | 100              |\n| 100-199       | 27                 | 27              | 85               |\n| 200-299       | 32                 | 32              | 58               |\n| 300-399       | 16                 | 16              | 26               |\n| 400-499       | 6                  | 6               | 10               |\n| 500-599       | 4                  | 4               | 4                |\n\nNow, we can calculate the survival probabilities for each time interval using the Kaplan-Meier estimator:\n\nS(99) = P(T > 99) = (1 - 15/100) = 0.85\nS(199) = P(T > 199) = 0.85 * (1 - 27/85) ≈ 0.85 * 0.6824 ≈ 0.580\nS(299) = P(T > 299) = 0.580 * (1 - 32/58) ≈ 0.580 * 0.4483 ≈ 0.260\nS(399) = P(T > 399) = 0.260 * (1 - 16/26) ≈ 0.260 * 0.3846 ≈ 0.100\nS(499) = P(T > 499) = 0.100 * (1 - 6/10) = 0.100 * 0.4 = 0.040\nS(599) = P(T > 599) = 0.040 * (1 - 4/4) = 0.040 * 0 = 0\n\nSo, the survival probabilities for each patient are:\n\n- 85% chance of surviving more than 99 days\n- 58% chance of surviving more than 199 days\n- 26% chance of surviving more than 299 days\n- 10% chance of surviving more than 399 days\n- 4% chance of surviving more than 499 days\n- 0% chance of surviving more than 599 days"
