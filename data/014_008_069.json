    "message_1": "Consider a block cipher based on the Advanced Encryption Standard, with a block size of 128 bits and a key size of 256 bits. If we encrypt a plaintext block with this cipher, how many possible different ciphertexts can we obtain?",
    "message_2": "Since the block size of the cipher is 128 bits, there are 2^128 possible different plaintext blocks that can be encrypted. When you encrypt a plaintext block, it will map to one of these 2^128 possible ciphertext blocks. Therefore, for a given plaintext block, there are 2^128 possible different ciphertexts that can be obtained."
