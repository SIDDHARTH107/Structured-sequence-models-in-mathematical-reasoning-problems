    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the intersection cohomology group IH^3(Y) with coefficients in the field with two elements, we will use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem.\n\nThe Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem states that if X is a smooth projective variety of dimension n and Y is a hyperplane section of X, then the restriction map H^k(X) → H^k(Y) is an isomorphism for k < n and an injection for k = n.\n\nIn our case, X is a smooth projective cubic curve, which has dimension 1. Y is a line, which is a hyperplane section of X, and has dimension 0. Since we are interested in the intersection cohomology group IH^3(Y), we have k = 3, which is greater than the dimension of X (n = 1).\n\nSince k > n, the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem does not give us any information about the map H^3(X) → H^3(Y). However, we can still compute the cohomology groups of Y directly.\n\nY is a line, which is isomorphic to the projective line P^1. The cohomology groups of P^1 with coefficients in the field with two elements are given by:\n\nH^0(P^1) = Z/2Z\nH^1(P^1) = 0\nH^2(P^1) = Z/2Z\n\nSince Y is a line, its cohomology groups are the same as those of P^1. In particular, H^3(Y) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the intersection cohomology group IH^3(Y) with coefficients in the field with two elements is 0."
