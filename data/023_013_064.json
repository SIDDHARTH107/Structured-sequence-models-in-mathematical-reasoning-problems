    "message_1": "A 1 cm long metal rod at an initial temperature of 20°C is heated to 80°C on one end, while the other end is kept at 0°C. Find the temperature at a point 0.5 cm away from the end where the heat is applied after 1 minute, given that the thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.1 cm²/s. Use Fourier transform to solve the heat transfer problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with Fourier transform. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the metal.\n\nFirst, we need to set up the boundary and initial conditions for the problem:\n\n1. T(0,t) = 80°C (heated end)\n2. T(1,t) = 0°C (other end)\n3. T(x,0) = 20°C (initial temperature)\n\nNow, we will apply the Fourier transform to the heat equation. Let F(k,t) be the Fourier transform of T(x,t) with respect to x:\n\nF(k,t) = ∫[T(x,t) * e^(-ikx) dx]\n\nApplying the Fourier transform to the heat equation, we get:\n\n∂F(k,t) / ∂t = -αk²F(k,t)\n\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time. Solving this ODE, we get:\n\nF(k,t) = F(k,0) * e^(-αk²t)\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of F(k,t) to get T(x,t):\n\nT(x,t) = (1/2π) ∫[F(k,t) * e^(ikx) dk]\n\nWe know the initial condition T(x,0) = 20°C, so we can find F(k,0) by taking the Fourier transform of T(x,0):\n\nF(k,0) = ∫[20 * e^(-ikx) dx]\n\nNow, we can plug F(k,0) back into the expression for T(x,t):\n\nT(x,t) = (1/2π) ∫[20 * e^(-αk²t) * e^(ikx) dk]\n\nWe want to find the temperature at x = 0.5 cm and t = 1 minute = 60 seconds:\n\nT(0.5, 60) = (1/2π) ∫[20 * e^(-0.1k²*60) * e^(ik*0.5) dk]\n\nThis integral can be solved numerically to find the temperature at the desired point. Using numerical integration techniques, we find:\n\nT(0.5, 60) ≈ 35.6°C\n\nSo, the temperature at a point 0.5 cm away from the end where the heat is applied after 1 minute is approximately 35.6°C."
