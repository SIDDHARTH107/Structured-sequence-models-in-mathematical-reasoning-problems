    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of f(x) = e^(-2x)u(x), we can use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(s) = ∫[f(x)e^(-2πisx)]dx\n\nSince u(x) is the unit step function, it is equal to 1 for x ≥ 0 and 0 for x < 0. Therefore, we only need to consider the integral for x ≥ 0:\n\nF(s) = ∫[e^(-2x)e^(-2πisx)]dx, where the integral is taken from 0 to ∞.\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(s) = ∫[e^(-2x - 2πisx)]dx, from 0 to ∞.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let's use the substitution method:\n\nLet t = -2x - 2πisx, then dt = (-2 - 2πis)dx.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of t:\n\nF(s) = (-1/2 - 1/2πis) ∫[e^t]dt, from 0 to ∞.\n\nNow, we can integrate e^t with respect to t:\n\nF(s) = (-1/2 - 1/2πis) [e^t], from 0 to ∞.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nF(s) = (-1/2 - 1/2πis) [e^(-∞) - e^0]\n\nF(s) = (-1/2 - 1/2πis) [0 - 1]\n\nF(s) = 1/2 + 1/2πis\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of f(x) = e^(-2x)u(x) is:\n\nF(s) = 1/2 + 1/2πis"
