    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve $C$ at point $P=[1:-1:0]$, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$. Then, we will use these partial derivatives to find the direction vector of the tangent line.\n\nLet $F(x,y,z) = y^2z - x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z)$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 + 2(1+\\lambda)z x - (1+\\lambda)(1-\\lambda)z^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = y^2 - x^2 + 2(1-\\lambda)zx - \\lambda x^2$\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point $P=[1:-1:0]$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(1,-1,0) = -3(1)^2 + 2(1+\\lambda)(0)(1) - (1+\\lambda)(1-\\lambda)(0)^2 = -3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(1,-1,0) = 2(-1)(0) = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z}(1,-1,0) = (-1)^2 - (1)^2 + 2(1-\\lambda)(1)(0) - \\lambda (1)^2 = 0$\n\nThus, the direction vector of the tangent line at point $P$ is $[-3, 0, 0]$. Since the point $P$ is in the form $[x:y:z] = [1:-1:0]$, we can write the equation of the tangent line in the projective plane as:\n\n$-3(x-1) = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 1$\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the curve $C$ at point $P=[1:-1:0]$ is $x = 1$."
