    "message_1": "A company claims that their new product has a mean lifetime of at least 500 hours. To verify the claim, a sample of 20 products is taken and their lifetimes are recorded. The sample has a mean lifetime of 480 hours and a standard deviation of 30 hours. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifetime of the new product.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifetime of the new product, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (t-score * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score for a 95% confidence interval with 19 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1 = 20 - 1 = 19). Using a t-table or calculator, we find that the t-score is approximately 2.093.\n\nNext, we will plug in the values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 480 ± (2.093 * (30 / √20))\n\nConfidence Interval = 480 ± (2.093 * (30 / 4.472))\n\nConfidence Interval = 480 ± (2.093 * 6.708)\n\nConfidence Interval = 480 ± 14.045\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifetime of the new product is approximately (465.955, 494.045) hours."
