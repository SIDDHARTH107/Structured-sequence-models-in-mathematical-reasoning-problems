    "message_2": "There are two distinct groups of order 10: the cyclic group C10 and the dihedral group D5.\n\n1. Cyclic group C10: This group is generated by a single element of order 10, and it is isomorphic to the integers modulo 10 under addition, denoted as Z10 or C10. It is an abelian group.\n\n2. Dihedral group D5: This group represents the symmetries of a regular pentagon, including rotations and reflections. It has 10 elements and is non-abelian. It can be generated by two elements, r and s, with the relations r^5 = s^2 = 1 and sr = r^4s.\n\nThe non-abelian group of order 10 is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5. So, among the two distinct groups of order 10, C10 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10, and D5 is isomorphic to both the dihedral group D5 and the non-abelian group of order 10."
