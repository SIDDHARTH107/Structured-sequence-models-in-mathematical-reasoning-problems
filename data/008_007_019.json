    "message_2": "To find the matrix P that diagonalizes A, we first need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. \n\n1. Find the eigenvalues:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = \n[5-λ 1   1]\n[1   5-λ 1]\n[1   1   5-λ]\n\nThe determinant of (A - λI) is:\n\n(5-λ)[(5-λ)^2 - 1] - 1[1(1) - (5-λ)] + 1[1 - (5-λ)] = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n\n(λ^3 - 15λ^2 + 69λ - 108) = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ1 = 3, λ2 = 6, and λ3 = 6.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors:\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFor λ1 = 3:\n(A - 3I)v = 0\n[2 1 1]\n[1 2 1]\n[1 1 2]\n\nRow reducing the augmented matrix, we get:\n[1 1 0]\n[0 1 1]\n[0 0 0]\n\nThe eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 3 is v1 = [1, -1, 1].\n\nFor λ2 = 6:\n(A - 6I)v = 0\n[-1 1 1]\n[1 -1 1]\n[1 1 -1]\n\nRow reducing the augmented matrix, we get:\n[1 -1 1]\n[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]\n\nThe eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = 6 is v2 = [1, 1, 0].\n\nSince λ3 = 6 is a repeated eigenvalue, we need to find another eigenvector that is linearly independent from v2. We can use the Gram-Schmidt process to find an orthogonal vector to v2.\n\nLet's choose a random vector w = [1, 0, 1]. We will project w onto v2 and subtract the projection from w to get an orthogonal vector.\n\nProjection of w onto v2 = (w·v2 / ||v2||^2) * v2 = (1 / 2) * [1, 1, 0] = [1/2, 1/2, 0]\n\nOrthogonal vector to v2 = w - projection = [1, 0, 1] - [1/2, 1/2, 0] = [1/2, -1/2, 1]\n\nSo, the eigenvector corresponding to λ3 = 6 is v3 = [1/2, -1/2, 1].\n\n3. Form the matrix P and the diagonal matrix D:\nNow, we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns and the diagonal matrix D with the eigenvalues on the diagonal.\n\nP = [ 1   1   1/2]\n      [-1   1  -1/2]\n      [ 1   0   1 ]\n\nD = [3 0 0]\n      [0 6 0]\n      [0 0 6]\n\nSo, the matrix P that diagonalizes A is:\n\nP = [ 1   1   1/2]\n      [-1   1  -1/2]\n      [ 1   0   1 ]\n\nAnd the diagonal matrix D is:\n\nD = [3 0 0]\n      [0 6 0]\n      [0 0 6]"
