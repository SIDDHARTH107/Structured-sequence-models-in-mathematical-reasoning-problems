    "message_2": "To find the median score, we first need to arrange the test scores in ascending order:\n\n40, 76, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 85, 86, 90\n\nSince there are 10 scores (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle scores. The two middle scores are 80 and 82. \n\nThe median score is (80 + 82) / 2 = 162 / 2 = 81."
