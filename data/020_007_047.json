    "message_2": "To determine the shortest number of planes needed to serve all 10 cities, we can use a simple strategy where each plane serves a certain number of cities. Since there are 6 planes and 10 cities, we can divide the cities among the planes.\n\nLet's assume that each plane can serve at least one city. We can distribute the remaining cities (10 - 6 = 4) among the 6 planes. We can assign one additional city to 4 of the planes, resulting in the following distribution:\n\n- Plane 1: 2 cities\n- Plane 2: 2 cities\n- Plane 3: 2 cities\n- Plane 4: 2 cities\n- Plane 5: 1 city\n- Plane 6: 1 city\n\nThis distribution ensures that all 10 cities are served by the 6 planes. Therefore, the shortest number of planes needed to serve all 10 cities is 6."
