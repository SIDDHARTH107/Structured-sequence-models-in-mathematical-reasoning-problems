    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 125. Since 125 = 5^3 and 5 is a prime number, we can apply the Sylow Theorems.\n\nBy the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_5 â‰¡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides 125\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. \n\nCase 1: n_5 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let P be this Sylow 5-subgroup. Since the order of P is 5^2 = 25, P is a group of order 25. By the Sylow Theorems applied to P, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup in P, which must be normal in P. Let Q be this Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. Since Q is normal in P and P is normal in G, Q is normal in G. \n\nNow, consider the product of P and Q, denoted by PQ. Since P and Q are both normal in G, PQ is a subgroup of G. Moreover, the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, so |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 25 * 5 = 125. Thus, PQ = G. \n\nSince Q is normal in G, we can form the quotient group G/Q. This quotient group has order |G|/|Q| = 125/5 = 25. Since 25 = 5^2, G/Q is a group of order 25. By the Sylow Theorems applied to G/Q, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup in G/Q, which must be normal in G/Q. Let R be this Sylow 5-subgroup. Then, R is isomorphic to P, as they are both Sylow 5-subgroups of order 25.\n\nNow, we have G = PQ, where P and Q are normal subgroups of G, and G/Q is isomorphic to P. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of order 25 and 5, respectively. Therefore, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25.\n\nCase 2: n_5 = 25\nIf there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups, then G cannot be cyclic, as a cyclic group of order 125 has only one subgroup of order 25. However, this case does not provide enough information to prove that G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that if G is a group of order 125, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
