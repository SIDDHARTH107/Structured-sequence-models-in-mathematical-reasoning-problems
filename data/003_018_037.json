    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 3sin(2x) + cos(5x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule.\n\nThe chain rule states that if y = f(g(x)), then the derivative of y with respect to x is dy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nLet's find the derivative of each term separately:\n\n1) For the term 3sin(2x), let f(u) = 3sin(u) and g(x) = 2x. Then, f'(u) = 3cos(u) and g'(x) = 2. Using the chain rule, we get:\n\nd(3sin(2x))/dx = 3cos(2x) * 2 = 6cos(2x)\n\n2) For the term cos(5x), let f(u) = cos(u) and g(x) = 5x. Then, f'(u) = -sin(u) and g'(x) = 5. Using the chain rule, we get:\n\nd(cos(5x))/dx = -sin(5x) * 5 = -5sin(5x)\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of the entire function:\n\ndy/dx = d(3sin(2x))/dx + d(cos(5x))/dx = 6cos(2x) - 5sin(5x)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the derivative at x = π/6:\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 6cos(2(π/6)) - 5sin(5(π/6)) = 6cos(π/3) - 5sin(5π/6)\n\ncos(π/3) = 1/2 and sin(5π/6) = 1/2, so:\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 6(1/2) - 5(1/2) = 3 - 2.5 = 0.5\n\nSo, the derivative of y = 3sin(2x) + cos(5x) at x = π/6 is 0.5."
