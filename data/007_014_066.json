    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128. Perfect numbers can be generated using the formula 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1), where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers.\n\nThe first five (p, 2^p - 1) pairs are:\n(2, 3) - 6\n(3, 7) - 28\n(5, 31) - 496\n(7, 127) - 8128\n(13, 8191) - 33,550,336\n\nTo find the 6th perfect number, we need to find the next prime number p such that 2^p - 1 is also prime. The next such pair is (17, 131071). Using the formula:\n\n2^(17-1) * (2^17 - 1) = 2^16 * 131071 = 65,536 * 131071 = 8,589,869,056\n\nSo, the 6th perfect number is 8,589,869,056."
