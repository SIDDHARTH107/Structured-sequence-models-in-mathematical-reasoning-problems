    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of $X$ with respect to the covering map $p$, we will first compute the fundamental group of $X$ and then determine the subgroup corresponding to the covering map.\n\nSince $X$ is a circle with radius 3, it is homeomorphic to the unit circle $S^1$. The fundamental group of $S^1$ is well-known to be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, with the generator corresponding to a loop that goes around the circle once in the counterclockwise direction.\n\nNow, let's consider the covering map $p: \\mathbb{C} - \\{0\\} \\rightarrow X$ defined by $p(z) = z^6$. We want to find the subgroup of $\\pi_1(X)$ corresponding to this covering map. To do this, we will lift a loop in $X$ to a path in the covering space $\\mathbb{C} - \\{0\\}$.\n\nLet $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\rightarrow X$ be a loop in $X$ based at the point $x_0 = 3$ (i.e., $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma(1) = x_0$). We can lift this loop to a path $\\tilde{\\gamma}: [0, 1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C} - \\{0\\}$ such that $p(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = \\gamma(t)$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$. Since $p(z) = z^6$, we have $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = \\sqrt[6]{\\gamma(t)}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the loop $\\gamma_n$ in $X$ that goes around the circle $n$ times in the counterclockwise direction, where $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The lifted path $\\tilde{\\gamma}_n$ in the covering space will go around the origin $6n$ times, since each time $\\gamma_n$ goes around the circle once, the lifted path $\\tilde{\\gamma}_n$ goes around the origin six times due to the covering map $p(z) = z^6$.\n\nTherefore, the subgroup of $\\pi_1(X)$ corresponding to the covering map $p$ is generated by the loop that goes around the circle $6$ times in the counterclockwise direction. This subgroup is isomorphic to $6\\mathbb{Z}$, which is a subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nIn conclusion, the fundamental group of $X$ with respect to the covering map $p$ is isomorphic to $6\\mathbb{Z}$."
