    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. A safe prime is a prime number of the form 2p + 1, where p is also prime.\n\nLet's find the smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a safe prime:\n\n1. Start with the smallest prime number, 2. However, 2 is not a Sophie Germain prime because 2(2) + 1 = 5, but 2 itself is not of the form 2p + 1.\n\n2. Move to the next smallest prime number, 3. 2(3) + 1 = 7, which is prime. So, 3 is a Sophie Germain prime. Now, check if 3 is also a safe prime. Since 3 = 2(1) + 1 and 1 is not prime, 3 is not a safe prime.\n\n3. Move to the next smallest prime number, 5. 2(5) + 1 = 11, which is prime. So, 5 is a Sophie Germain prime. Now, check if 5 is also a safe prime. Since 5 = 2(2) + 1 and 2 is prime, 5 is a safe prime.\n\nTherefore, the smallest Sophie Germain prime that is also a safe prime is 5."
