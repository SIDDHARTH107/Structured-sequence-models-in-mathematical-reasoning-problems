    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed by the curves y = 2x and y = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 2, we need to find the integral of the difference between the two functions over the given interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the points of intersection between the two curves:\n\n2x = x^2\nx^2 - 2x = 0\nx(x - 2) = 0\n\nThe points of intersection are x = 0 and x = 2.\n\nNow, we can set up the integral:\n\nArea = âˆ«(2x - x^2)dx from x = 0 to x = 2\n\nTo solve the integral, we need to find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n\nAntiderivative of 2x is x^2, and the antiderivative of x^2 is (1/3)x^3.\n\nSo, the antiderivative of (2x - x^2) is (x^2 - (1/3)x^3).\n\nNow, we can apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find the area:\n\nArea = [(x^2 - (1/3)x^3)] from x = 0 to x = 2\nArea = [(2^2 - (1/3)(2^3)) - (0^2 - (1/3)(0^3))]\nArea = [(4 - (8/3)) - (0 - 0)]\nArea = [4 - (8/3)]\n\nTo make it easier to calculate, let's find a common denominator:\n\nArea = (12 - 8)/3\nArea = 4/3\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the curves y = 2x and y = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 2 is 4/3 square units."
