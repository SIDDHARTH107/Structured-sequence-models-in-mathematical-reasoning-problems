    "message_2": "To determine the optimal shape of the cross-section of the beam and its minimum weight, we will use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the required moment of inertia (I) for the beam.\n2. Determine the optimal shape of the cross-section based on the required moment of inertia.\n3. Calculate the minimum weight of the beam.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the required moment of inertia (I)\n\nThe maximum bending moment (M) for a simply supported beam with a uniformly distributed load (w) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nM = wL^2 / 8\n\nwhere L is the length of the beam. In this case, the total load (W) is 10,000 N, and the length (L) is 2 meters. Therefore, the uniformly distributed load (w) is:\n\nw = W / L = 10,000 N / 2 m = 5,000 N/m\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum bending moment (M):\n\nM = (5,000 N/m)(2 m)^2 / 8 = 2,500 Nm\n\nNext, we will use the maximum stress (σ) formula for a beam:\n\nσ = M * c / I\n\nwhere σ is the maximum stress (100 MPa), M is the maximum bending moment (2,500 Nm), c is the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme fiber, and I is the moment of inertia. We need to rearrange the formula to solve for I:\n\nI = M * c / σ\n\nStep 2: Determine the optimal shape of the cross-section\n\nFor a rectangular cross-section, the moment of inertia (I) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nI = (b * h^3) / 12\n\nwhere b is the base width and h is the height of the rectangle. The distance from the neutral axis to the extreme fiber (c) is:\n\nc = h / 2\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for I and c into the formula for the required moment of inertia:\n\nI = M * (h / 2) / σ = (b * h^3) / 12\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for b:\n\nb = (12 * M * 2) / (σ * h^3)\n\nSince we want to minimize the weight of the beam, we need to minimize the cross-sectional area (A) of the beam, which is:\n\nA = b * h\n\nSubstituting the expression for b:\n\nA = ((12 * M * 2) / (σ * h^3)) * h = (24 * M) / (σ * h^2)\n\nTo minimize the area, we need to maximize the height (h). However, we also need to consider the constraint that the maximum stress should not exceed 100 MPa. Therefore, we need to find the optimal height (h) that satisfies this constraint.\n\nLet's assume an optimal height (h) of 0.1 meters (100 mm). This is an arbitrary value, and you can choose a different value based on your specific requirements. Using this value, we can calculate the base width (b):\n\nb = (12 * 2,500 Nm * 2) / (100 MPa * (0.1 m)^3) = 0.006 m (6 mm)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the minimum weight of the beam\n\nNow that we have the optimal cross-sectional dimensions (b = 6 mm and h = 100 mm), we can calculate the minimum weight of the beam. First, we need to calculate the cross-sectional area (A):\n\nA = b * h = 0.006 m * 0.1 m = 0.0006 m^2\n\nNext, we need to find the volume (V) of the beam:\n\nV = A * L = 0.0006 m^2 * 2 m = 0.0012 m^3\n\nAssuming the density (ρ) of steel is 7,850 kg/m^3, we can calculate the minimum weight (W_min) of the beam:\n\nW_min = ρ * V = 7,850 kg/m^3 * 0.0012 m^3 = 9.42 kg\n\nTherefore, the optimal shape of the cross-section of the beam is a rectangle with a base width of 6 mm and a height of 100 mm, and its minimum weight is 9.42 kg."
