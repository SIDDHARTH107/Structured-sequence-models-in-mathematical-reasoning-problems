    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem regarding the Cryptanalysis of Vigenere cipher for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose you intercept an encrypted message which uses Vigenere cipher with a key length of 7. You also know that the frequency of occurrence of the letter \"E\" in the English language is 12.7%. After analyzing the encrypted message, you observe that the most frequent letter in the cipher text to be \"K\". What is the key letter associated with the first letter of the original message?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the shift used in the Vigenère cipher for the first letter of the key. We know that the most frequent letter in the ciphertext is \"K\" and the most frequent letter in the English language is \"E\" with a frequency of 12.7%. \n\nThe Vigenère cipher uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. In this case, we can use the Caesar cipher to find the shift between \"K\" and \"E\". The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nThe positions of the letters \"E\" and \"K\" in the alphabet are:\n\nE: 5\nK: 11\n\nNow, we need to find the shift between these two letters. We can do this by subtracting the position of \"E\" from the position of \"K\":\n\nShift = 11 - 5 = 6\n\nSo, the first letter of the key is shifted 6 positions from \"E\". To find the key letter, we can add the shift to the position of \"E\":\n\nKey letter position = 5 + 6 = 11\n\nThe 11th letter in the alphabet is \"K\". Therefore, the key letter associated with the first letter of the original message is \"K\"."
