    "message_2": "To determine if a function is analytic at a point, we need to check if it is differentiable at that point and if its derivative is continuous in a neighborhood around that point.\n\nThe function f(z) = z^3 + 2z is a polynomial function, and polynomial functions are differentiable everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is differentiable at z = 2i.\n\nNow let's find the derivative of f(z):\n\nf'(z) = d/dz (z^3 + 2z) = 3z^2 + 2\n\nSince f'(z) is also a polynomial function, it is continuous everywhere in the complex plane, including at z = 2i.\n\nThus, the function f(z) = z^3 + 2z is analytic at z = 2i."
