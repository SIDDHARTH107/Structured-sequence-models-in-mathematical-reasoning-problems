    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using a transposition cipher with the keys 5, 2, 1, 4, 3, we first need to arrange the message into a table with 5 columns (based on the number of keys) and then read the message column-wise according to the order of the keys.\n\n1. Arrange the message into a table with 5 columns:\n\nH E L L O\nW O R L D\n\n2. Read the message column-wise according to the order of the keys (5, 2, 1, 4, 3):\n\nColumn 5: O\nColumn 2: E L\nColumn 1: H W\nColumn 4: L R\nColumn 3: L O D\n\n3. Combine the columns to get the encrypted message:\n\nOELHWLRLOD\n\nSo, the encrypted message using the transposition cipher with the keys 5, 2, 1, 4, 3 is \"OELHWLRLOD\"."
