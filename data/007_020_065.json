    "message_1": "Suppose you have to send a confidential message to your friend and you want to use RSA encryption. Your friend's public key is (e=5, n=77). If you want to send the message \"23\", what is the encrypted message that you will send?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using RSA encryption, we use the formula:\n\nC = M^e mod n\n\nwhere C is the encrypted message, M is the original message (23 in this case), e is the public exponent (5), and n is the modulus (77).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC = 23^5 mod 77\n\nFirst, calculate 23^5:\n\n23^5 = 6436343\n\nNow, find the remainder when dividing 6436343 by 77:\n\nC = 6436343 mod 77 = 60\n\nSo, the encrypted message that you will send is 60."
