    "message_1": "What is the probability of a ransomware cyber-attack occurring on a network of 50 computers in a month, given that the historical data suggests that such an attack occurs on average twice a year on a network of 100 computers?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, ransomware cyber-attacks) in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nFirst, let's find the average number of attacks per computer per year. Since there are 2 attacks per year on a network of 100 computers, the average number of attacks per computer per year is:\n\n2 attacks / 100 computers = 0.02 attacks/computer/year\n\nNow, let's find the average number of attacks per computer per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can divide the yearly rate by 12:\n\n0.02 attacks/computer/year * (1 year / 12 months) = 0.00167 attacks/computer/month\n\nNow, we can find the average number of attacks on a network of 50 computers in a month:\n\n0.00167 attacks/computer/month * 50 computers = 0.0835 attacks/month\n\nNow, we can use the Poisson distribution formula to find the probability of at least one attack occurring in a month:\n\nP(X >= 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\n\nThe Poisson distribution formula for P(X = 0) is:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-λ) * λ^X) / X!\n\nwhere λ is the average number of attacks per month (0.0835), X is the number of attacks we want to find the probability for (0), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.0835) * 0.0835^0) / 0! = (0.9198 * 1) / 1 = 0.9198\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one attack occurring in a month:\n\nP(X >= 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - 0.9198 = 0.0802\n\nSo, the probability of a ransomware cyber-attack occurring on a network of 50 computers in a month is approximately 8.02%."
