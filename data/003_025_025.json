    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's displacement vector, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry.\n\nLet's represent the boat's displacement vector as R. The boat moves 50 meters south (let's call this A) and then 70 meters east (let's call this B). We can form a right triangle with A, B, and R as its sides.\n\n1. Find the magnitude of the displacement vector (R):\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nR^2 = A^2 + B^2\nR^2 = (50)^2 + (70)^2\nR^2 = 2500 + 4900\nR^2 = 7400\nR = √7400\nR ≈ 86.02 meters\n\nSo, the magnitude of the boat's displacement vector is approximately 86.02 meters.\n\n2. Find the direction of the displacement vector:\n\nWe can use the tangent function to find the angle (θ) between the displacement vector (R) and the southward movement (A).\n\ntan(θ) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(θ) = B / A\ntan(θ) = 70 / 50\ntan(θ) ≈ 1.4\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse tangent (arctan) of 1.4:\n\nθ = arctan(1.4)\nθ ≈ 54.46 degrees\n\nSince the boat moved south and then east, the angle is measured counterclockwise from the south direction. Therefore, the direction of the boat's displacement vector is approximately 54.46 degrees east of south.\n\nIn summary, the boat's displacement vector has a magnitude of approximately 86.02 meters and a direction of approximately 54.46 degrees east of south."
