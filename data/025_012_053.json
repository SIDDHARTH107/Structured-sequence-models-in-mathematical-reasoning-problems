    "message_2": "To compute the coordinates of the point $2P$, we need to find the tangent line to the curve $E$ at point $P$ and then find the intersection of this tangent line with the curve. Finally, we reflect the intersection point over the x-axis to get the point $2P$.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope of the tangent line at point $P$. We can do this by taking the derivative of the curve equation with respect to $x$ and evaluating it at $P$:\n\n$E: y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 2$\n\nImplicitly differentiate both sides with respect to $x$:\n\n$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - 2$\n\nNow, we plug in the coordinates of point $P$:\n\n$2(1) \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3(0)^2 - 2$\n\nSolving for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = -1$\n\nNow we have the slope of the tangent line at point $P$. The equation of the tangent line is:\n\n$y - 1 = -1(x - 0)$\n\n$y = -x + 1$\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of this tangent line with the curve $E$. We substitute the equation of the tangent line into the curve equation:\n\n$(-x + 1)^2 = x^3 - 2x + 2$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$x^3 - 2x^2 + x = 0$\n\nFactoring out an $x$, we get:\n\n$x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\n\nThe solutions are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. Since $x = 0$ corresponds to the point $P$, we are interested in the other solution, $x = 1$. Plugging this value into the tangent line equation, we get:\n\n$y = -1 + 1 = 0$\n\nSo, the intersection point is $(1, 0)$. Now, we reflect this point over the x-axis to get the point $2P$:\n\n$2P = (1, -0) = (1, 0)$\n\nThus, the coordinates of the point $2P$ are $(1, 0)$."
