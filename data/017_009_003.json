    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 9, we know that |G| = 9. We also know that 9 = 3^2, so G is a p-group, where p is a prime number (in this case, p = 3). According to the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, every finite abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of elements of order 3 in G. By Cauchy's theorem, there must be at least one element of order 3 in G. Let's denote this element as x, so x^3 = e (where e is the identity element in G). Since G is a group of order 9, there are 8 non-identity elements in G. We know that x and x^2 are both elements of order 3, so there are at least 2 elements of order 3 in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of elements of order 9 in G. If there is at least one element of order 9 in G, then G must be cyclic, as it would be generated by that element. In this case, G would be isomorphic to C9, the cyclic group of order 9.\n\nIf there is no element of order 9 in G, then all non-identity elements in G must be of order 3. In this case, G would be a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3, i.e., G ≅ C3 × C3. However, C3 × C3 is an abelian group, and there is no non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nTherefore, G must have an element of order 9, which means G is a cyclic group of order 9 and is isomorphic to C9."
