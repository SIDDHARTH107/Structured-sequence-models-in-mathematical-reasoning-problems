A sample of 36 bulbs is selected at random. What is the probability that the mean lifespan of this sample would be more than 510 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nGiven:\nPopulation mean (μ) = 500 hours\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 20 hours\nSample size (n) = 36 bulbs\n\nWe want to find the probability that the sample mean (x̄) is more than 510 hours.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nStandard deviation of sample mean (σx̄) = σ / √n\n\nσx̄ = 20 / √36\nσx̄ = 20 / 6\nσx̄ = 3.333 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score, which is the number of standard deviations away from the population mean:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / σx̄\n\nz = (510 - 500) / 3.333\nz = 10 / 3.333\nz ≈ 3\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is more than 3. We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the area to the right of z = 3. The area to the left of z = 3 is approximately 0.9987. Therefore, the area to the right of z = 3 is:\n\nP(z > 3) = 1 - P(z < 3)\nP(z > 3) = 1 - 0.9987\nP(z > 3) ≈ 0.0013\n\nSo, the probability that the mean lifespan of the sample of 36 bulbs is more than 510 hours is approximately 0.0013 or 0.13%."
