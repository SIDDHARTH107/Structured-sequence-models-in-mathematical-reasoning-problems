    "message_2": "Goldbach's Conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. To find the smallest even number that can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers in at least six different ways, we can start by testing even numbers and finding their prime pairs.\n\nLet's start with the smallest even number greater than 2:\n\n4 = 2 + 2 (1 way)\n\n6 = 3 + 3 (1 way)\n\n8 = 3 + 5 (1 way)\n\n10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5 (2 ways)\n\n12 = 7 + 5 (1 way)\n\n14 = 3 + 11 = 7 + 7 (2 ways)\n\n16 = 3 + 13 = 5 + 11 (2 ways)\n\n18 = 5 + 13 = 7 + 11 (2 ways)\n\n20 = 3 + 17 = 7 + 13 (2 ways)\n\n22 = 3 + 19 = 5 + 17 = 11 + 11 (3 ways)\n\n24 = 5 + 19 = 7 + 17 = 11 + 13 (3 ways)\n\n26 = 3 + 23 = 7 + 19 = 13 + 13 (3 ways)\n\n28 = 5 + 23 = 11 + 17 (2 ways)\n\n30 = 7 + 23 = 11 + 19 = 13 + 17 (3 ways)\n\n32 = 3 + 29 = 13 + 19 (2 ways)\n\n34 = 3 + 31 = 5 + 29 = 11 + 23 = 17 + 17 (4 ways)\n\n36 = 5 + 31 = 7 + 29 = 13 + 23 = 17 + 19 (4 ways)\n\n38 = 7 + 31 = 11 + 27 = 13 + 25 = 19 + 19 (4 ways)\n\n40 = 3 + 37 = 11 + 29 = 17 + 23 (3 ways)\n\n42 = 5 + 37 = 7 + 35 = 13 + 29 = 19 + 23 (4 ways)\n\n44 = 3 + 41 = 11 + 33 = 17 + 27 = 23 + 21 (4 ways)\n\n46 = 5 + 41 = 7 + 39 = 13 + 33 = 19 + 27 = 23 + 23 = 29 + 17 (6 ways)\n\nThe smallest even number that can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers in at least six different ways is 46. The six different ways are:\n\n46 = 5 + 41\n46 = 7 + 39\n46 = 13 + 33\n46 = 19 + 27\n46 = 23 + 23\n46 = 29 + 17"
