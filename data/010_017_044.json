    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, which relates the sum of the indices of the critical points of a smooth function on a closed surface to the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a closed surface with genus $g$ is given by the formula:\n\n$\\chi = 2 - 2g$\n\nFor a genus 2 surface, the Euler characteristic is:\n\n$\\chi = 2 - 2(2) = -2$\n\nNow, let's consider the indices of the critical points of the smooth function $f$. A local maximum has an index of +1, a local minimum has an index of +1, and a saddle has an index of -1.\n\nLet $m$ be the number of local minima. Since there are 10 critical points in total, and 7 of them are saddles and the rest are local maxima, there are 3 local maxima. According to the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, the sum of the indices of the critical points is equal to the Euler characteristic:\n\n$3(1) + m(1) + 7(-1) = -2$\n\nSolving for $m$, we get:\n\n$3 + m - 7 = -2$\n\n$m = -2 - 3 + 7$\n\n$m = 2$\n\nSo, the maximum number of local minima that $f$ can have on the genus 2 surface is 2."
