    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of graph G, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of proper k-colorings of G, where k is the number of colors.\n\n1. Choose an edge e = (u, v) in G. We can choose the edge (1,2).\n2. Compute P(G-e, k), which is the chromatic polynomial of the graph obtained by deleting edge e. In this case, G-e has edges {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (4,6)}.\n3. Compute P(G/e, k), which is the chromatic polynomial of the graph obtained by contracting edge e. In this case, G/e has vertices {1,2,3,4,5,6} and edges {(1,3), (1,4), (3,4), (4,5), (4,6)}. Note that vertex 2 is merged with vertex 1.\n4. The chromatic polynomial of G is given by P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k).\n\nNow, we need to find the chromatic polynomials of G-e and G/e.\n\nFor G-e, we can observe that it is a tree with 6 vertices. The chromatic polynomial of a tree with n vertices is k(k-1)^(n-1). Therefore, P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)^5.\n\nFor G/e, we can observe that it is a tree with 5 vertices. Therefore, P(G/e, k) = k(k-1)^4.\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial of G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k) = k(k-1)^5 - k(k-1)^4 = k(k-1)^4[(k-1) - 1] = k(k-1)^4(k-2).\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of graph G is P(G, k) = k(k-1)^4(k-2)."
