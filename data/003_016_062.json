    "message_1": "A sinusoidal function has an amplitude of 2, a period of 6, and a phase shift of π/3. Write the equation for the function and find its phase angle in degrees.",
    "message_2": "To write the equation for the sinusoidal function, we need to determine the values of A, B, C, and D in the general equation:\n\ny = A * sin(B(x - C)) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift. In this case, we have:\n\nAmplitude (A) = 2\nPeriod = 6\nPhase shift (C) = π/3\nVertical shift (D) = 0 (since it's not mentioned)\n\nTo find the frequency (B), we use the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / B\n\nPlugging in the given period:\n\n6 = 2π / B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = 2π / 6 = π / 3\n\nNow we can write the equation for the sinusoidal function:\n\ny = 2 * sin((π/3)(x - π/3))\n\nTo find the phase angle in degrees, we convert the phase shift from radians to degrees:\n\nPhase angle = (π/3) * (180/π) = 60°\n\nSo, the phase angle is 60°."
