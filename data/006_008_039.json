    "message_2": "The probability of an event not happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event happening. In this case, the probability of no thunderstorm is:\n\n1 - P(thunderstorm) = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65\n\nSo, the probability that there will be no thunderstorm in the city is 0.65 or 65%."
