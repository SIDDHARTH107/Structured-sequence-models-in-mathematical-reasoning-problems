    "message_1": "Let $C$ be a smooth, projective, algebraic curve of genus $g$ over the field of complex numbers, and let $D$ be an effective divisor on $C$ with degree $d$. Then, the Riemann-Roch theorem states that the dimension of the space of global sections of $O_C(D)$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{dim}(H^0(C,O_C(D))) = d-g+1+\\mathrm{dim}(H^1(C,O_C(D)))\n$$\n\nSuppose $C$ is an elliptic curve (i.e. $g=1$). Let $D$ be the divisor $P-Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are distinct points on $C$. Find the dimension of the space of global sections of $O_C(D)$.",
    "message_2": "Since $C$ is an elliptic curve, we have $g = 1$. The divisor $D$ has degree $d = \\mathrm{deg}(P - Q) = \\mathrm{deg}(P) - \\mathrm{deg}(Q) = 1 - 1 = 0$. Now we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{dim}(H^0(C,O_C(D))) = d - g + 1 + \\mathrm{dim}(H^1(C,O_C(D))) = 0 - 1 + 1 + \\mathrm{dim}(H^1(C,O_C(D))) = \\mathrm{dim}(H^1(C,O_C(D)))\n$$\n\nSince $D$ has degree $0$, we know that $O_C(D)$ is a line bundle of degree $0$. For an elliptic curve, the degree $0$ line bundles are precisely the ones with a non-vanishing global section, so we have:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{dim}(H^0(C,O_C(D))) = 1\n$$\n\nThus, the dimension of the space of global sections of $O_C(D)$ is $1$."
