    "message_2": "To determine the minimum possible genus of a graph G with 10 vertices and 20 edges, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the inequality for the genus of a graph.\n\nEuler's formula for planar graphs states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, we are given a graph G with 10 vertices (V = 10) and 20 edges (E = 20), and we want to find the minimum possible genus (g) of G. To do this, we can use the inequality for the genus of a graph:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for V and E:\n\n20 ≤ 3(10) + 6g - 6\n\nSolving for g:\n\n20 ≤ 30 + 6g - 6\n6 ≤ 6g\n1 ≤ g\n\nSince the genus must be a non-negative integer, the minimum possible genus of the graph G is 1."
