    "message_2": "The Hopf map, denoted as h: S³ → S², is a continuous map from the 3-sphere S³ to the 2-sphere S². It is defined using quaternions, which are a generalization of complex numbers. A quaternion can be represented as q = a + bi + cj + dk, where a, b, c, and d are real numbers, and i, j, and k are imaginary units with the properties i² = j² = k² = ijk = -1.\n\nThe unit 3-sphere S³ can be represented as the set of unit quaternions, i.e., quaternions q with norm ||q|| = 1. The Hopf map h: S³ → S² is defined as follows:\n\nh(q) = q * (0, 1, 0) * q⁻¹,\n\nwhere q is a unit quaternion, q⁻¹ is its conjugate, and * denotes quaternion multiplication.\n\nTo compute the Hopf map, we first need to find the quaternion product q * (0, 1, 0) * q⁻¹. Let q = a + bi + cj + dk, then q⁻¹ = a - bi - cj - dk, since ||q|| = 1. Now, we compute the products:\n\nq * (0, 1, 0) = (a + bi + cj + dk) * (0 + i) = ai + b - ci - dj.\n\nNext, we compute the product with q⁻¹:\n\n(ai + b - ci - dj) * (a - bi - cj - dk) = (a² + b² + c² + d²) - 2abi - 2acj - 2adk + (bc - ad)i + (bd + ac)j + (ab - bc)k.\n\nSince q is a unit quaternion, a² + b² + c² + d² = 1. Thus, the Hopf map h(q) is given by:\n\nh(q) = (1 - 2ab)i + (1 - 2ac)j + (1 - 2ad)k.\n\nThis map projects the points on the unit 3-sphere S³ to points on the 2-sphere S² with radius 1, centered at the origin."
