    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree of the graph, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we sort the edges by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. B-E = 1\n2. B-C = 2\n3. A-C = 3\n4. C-E = 5\n5. A-B = 6\n6. C-D = 7\n7. D-E = 8\n8. A-D = 9\n\nNow, we add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure not to create any cycles:\n\n1. Add B-E (weight 1)\n2. Add B-C (weight 2)\n3. Add A-C (weight 3) - At this point, adding C-E would create a cycle, so we skip it.\n4. Add C-D (weight 7) - A-B and D-E would both create cycles, so we skip them.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree now includes the edges B-E, B-C, A-C, and C-D with a total weight of 1 + 2 + 3 + 7 = 13."
