    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 24 is isomorphic to one of the mentioned groups, we will use the Sylow Theorems. The order of G is 24 = 2^3 * 3. According to the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have the following possibilities:\n\n- n_2 ∈ {1, 3} and n_3 ∈ {1, 4}\n\nNow, we will analyze each case and determine the possible isomorphisms.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup, they are both normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. Since P and Q are both normal, their product PQ is a subgroup of G with order 24. By the counting formula, |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q|. Since P and Q have relatively prime orders, their intersection is trivial, so |PQ| = 24. Thus, G = PQ, and G is the direct product of P and Q. This means G is isomorphic to C8 x C3, which is the cyclic group C24.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it is normal in G. Let Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. Since Q is normal, G acts on Q by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism from G to Aut(Q). Since Q is isomorphic to C3, Aut(Q) is isomorphic to C2. The kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup K of G with index 2, so |K| = 12. By the Schreier's Theorem, K must have a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, say P. Now, K = PQ, and K is the direct product of P and Q. Thus, K is isomorphic to C4 x C3, which is the cyclic group C12. Since K is normal in G and has index 2, G is a semidirect product of K and a subgroup of order 2. This gives us two non-abelian groups of order 24: the dihedral group D12 and the dicyclic group Q24.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8. Since P is normal, G acts on P by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism from G to Aut(P). Since P is isomorphic to C8 or C4 x C2, Aut(P) is isomorphic to C4 x C2 or C2 x C2. The kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup K of G with order 3. By the Schreier's Theorem, K must have a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, say Q. Now, G = PQ, and G is the direct product of P and Q. Thus, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C8 x C3, C4 x C2 x C3. The first case has already been considered in Case 1, and the second case gives us the non-abelian group C4 x S3.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. The action of G on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation induces a homomorphism from G to S4. The kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup K of G with order 6. By the Schreier's Theorem, K must have a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, say Q. Now, G = PQ, and G is the direct product of P and Q. Thus, G is isomorphic to the alternating group A5.\n\nIn conclusion, a group G of order 24 is isomorphic to one of the following groups: the cyclic group C24, the alternating group A5, or one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24 (D12, Q24, C4 x S3)."
