    "message_2": "To find the median of a set of data, we first need to arrange the data in ascending order, which is already done in this case. The median is the middle value of the dataset when it is ordered from least to greatest. If there is an odd number of data points, the median is the middle value. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\nIn this case, there are 11 data points, which is an odd number. To find the middle value, we can use the formula (n+1)/2, where n is the number of data points. \n\n(11+1)/2 = 12/2 = 6\n\nThe median is the 6th value in the dataset, which is 11. Using the concept of robust statistics, the median is a measure of central tendency that is less sensitive to extreme values or outliers in the dataset. In this case, the median of 11 accurately represents the center of the dataset without being influenced by any potential outliers."
