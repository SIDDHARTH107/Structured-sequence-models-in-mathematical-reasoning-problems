    "message_1": "Given a relevance logic formula p → p, determine whether it is valid or not.",
    "message_2": "In relevance logic, a formula is considered valid if it is true in every possible situation where the premises are relevant to the conclusion. The formula p → p is an example of a tautology, which means it is always true regardless of the truth value of p.\n\nIn this case, the premise and the conclusion are the same (p), so they are clearly relevant to each other. Therefore, the formula p → p is valid in relevance logic."
