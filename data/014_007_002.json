    "message_1": "If a stream cipher generates a keystream of length 256 bits, and the plaintext to be encrypted is 128 bits long, what should be the length of the secret key used by the cipher?",
    "message_2": "The length of the secret key used by the cipher does not directly depend on the length of the keystream or the plaintext. The key length is determined by the specific stream cipher algorithm being used and its security requirements.\n\nFor example, if the stream cipher is using a symmetric key algorithm like AES, the key length could be 128, 192, or 256 bits, depending on the desired security level. However, this information is not provided in the problem statement, so we cannot determine the exact length of the secret key used by the cipher."
