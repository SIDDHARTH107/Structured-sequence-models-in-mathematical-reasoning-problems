    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate z from the first two equations. To do this, we can add the first and second equations together:\n\n(2x - 3y + z) + (4x + 2y - z) = 8 + 2\n6x - y = 10\n\nNow, we will eliminate z from the second and third equations. To do this, we can add two times the third equation to the second equation:\n\n(4x + 2y - z) + 2(3x - y + 2z) = 2 + 2(1)\n4x + 2y - z + 6x - 2y + 4z = 4\n10x + 3z = 4\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (x and z):\n\n6x - y = 10\n10x + 3z = 4\n\nNext, we will eliminate x from these two equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 5 and subtract the second equation multiplied by 3:\n\n5(6x - y) - 3(10x + 3z) = 5(10) - 3(4)\n30x - 5y - 30x - 9z = 50 - 12\n-5y - 9z = 38\n\nNow, we will substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for y:\n\n6x - y = 10\ny = 6x - 10\n\nSubstitute this into the equation with y and z:\n\n-5(6x - 10) - 9z = 38\n-30x + 50 - 9z = 38\n-9z = -30x + 88\n\nNow, we will substitute the first equation into the equation with x and z:\n\n10x + 3z = 4\n10x = -3z + 4\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (x and z):\n\n-9z = -30x + 88\n10x = -3z + 4\n\nNext, we will eliminate x from these two equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 10 and add the second equation multiplied by 30:\n\n10(-9z) + 30(10x) = 10(-30x + 88) + 30(-3z + 4)\n-90z + 300x = -900x + 880 + 90z\n390x = 880\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 880 / 390\nx = 2\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the values of y and z. We will substitute the value of x into the equations we found earlier:\n\ny = 6x - 10\ny = 6(2) - 10\ny = 12 - 10\ny = 2\n\n10x = -3z + 4\n10(2) = -3z + 4\n20 = -3z + 4\n16 = -3z\nz = -16/3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 2, y = 2, and z = -16/3."
