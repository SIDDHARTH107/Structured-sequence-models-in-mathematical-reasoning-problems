    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 8 ≤ 20, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 8 from both sides of the inequality.\n3x + 8 - 8 ≤ 20 - 8\n3x ≤ 12\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the inequality by 3.\n3x/3 ≤ 12/3\nx ≤ 4\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is x ≤ 4. This means that any real number less than or equal to 4 will satisfy the inequality."
