The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nB = {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}\n\nIntersection of A and B (A ∩ B) = {4, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the elements that are in either A or B, but not in their intersection:\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}\n\nNow, we need to find the symmetric difference between (A △ B) and the given set {4, 7, 9, 10}:\n\n(A △ B) = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}\nC = {4, 7, 9, 10}\n\nIntersection of (A △ B) and C ((A △ B) ∩ C) = {7}\n\nNow, let's find the elements that are in either (A △ B) or C, but not in their intersection:\n\n(A △ B) △ C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference (A △ B) △ {4, 7, 9, 10} is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10}."
