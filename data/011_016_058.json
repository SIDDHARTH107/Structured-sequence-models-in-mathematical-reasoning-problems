    "message_1": "For a project, a student needs to write a research paper that references six different sources. If the student has a list of ten possible sources, how many different ways can they choose six of them to use in their paper?",
    "message_2": "The student needs to choose 6 sources out of 10. This is a combination problem, as the order of the sources does not matter. We can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of sources (10) and k is the number of sources to choose (6).\n\nC(10, 6) = 10! / (6!(10-6)!)\n\nC(10, 6) = 10! / (6!4!)\n\nC(10, 6) = (10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((6*5*4*3*2*1)*(4*3*2*1))\n\nC(10, 6) = (10*9*8*7) / (4*3*2*1)\n\nC(10, 6) = 5040 / 24\n\nC(10, 6) = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 different ways the student can choose 6 sources out of 10."
