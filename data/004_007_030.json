    "message_2": "To find the derivative of (f ∘ g)(x) using the chain rule, we first need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x).\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2)/dx = 4x\ng'(x) = d(√(x+1))/dx = 1/(2√(x+1))\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule to find the derivative of (f ∘ g)(x):\n\n(f ∘ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nSubstitute the derivatives and functions we found earlier:\n\n(f ∘ g)'(x) = (4 * g(x)) * (1/(2√(x+1)))\n\nNow, substitute g(x) back into the equation:\n\n(f ∘ g)'(x) = (4 * √(x+1)) * (1/(2√(x+1)))\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n(f ∘ g)'(x) = 2 * (x+1)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the derivative at x = 3:\n\n(f ∘ g)'(3) = 2 * (3+1) = 2 * 4 = 8\n\nSo, the derivative of (f ∘ g)(x) evaluated at x = 3 is 8."
