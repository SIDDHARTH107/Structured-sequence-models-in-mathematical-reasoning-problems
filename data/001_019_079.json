    "message_2": "To solve the equation |4x + 7| = 15, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 4x + 7 = 15\nSubtract 7 from both sides:\n4x = 8\nDivide by 4:\nx = 2\n\nCase 2: 4x + 7 = -15\nSubtract 7 from both sides:\n4x = -22\nDivide by 4:\nx = -5.5\n\nSo, the solutions for x are x = 2 and x = -5.5."
