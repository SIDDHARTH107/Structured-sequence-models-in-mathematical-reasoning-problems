    "message_2": "To find the number of roots of f(z) = 1 in the annulus 1 < |z| < 2, we first rewrite the equation as:\n\nf(z) - 1 = 0\n2z^4 - 4z^2 + 5 = 0\n\nLet g(z) = 2z^4 - 4z^2 + 5. We want to find the number of roots of g(z) = 0 in the annulus 1 < |z| < 2.\n\nWe will use the argument principle, which states that the number of zeros minus the number of poles of a function within a closed contour is equal to the change in the argument of the function along the contour divided by 2π.\n\nFirst, we find the change in the argument of g(z) along the contour |z| = 1. We parameterize z as z = e^(iθ), where 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π. Then, g(z) becomes:\n\ng(e^(iθ)) = 2e^(4iθ) - 4e^(2iθ) + 5\n\nNow, we find the change in the argument of g(z) along the contour |z| = 2. We parameterize z as z = 2e^(iθ), where 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π. Then, g(z) becomes:\n\ng(2e^(iθ)) = 2(2^4)e^(4iθ) - 4(2^2)e^(2iθ) + 5\n\nNext, we compute the change in the argument of g(z) along both contours and subtract the results to find the net change in the argument of g(z) in the annulus 1 < |z| < 2.\n\nFor |z| = 1, the change in the argument of g(z) is 2π, and for |z| = 2, the change in the argument of g(z) is 0. Therefore, the net change in the argument of g(z) in the annulus is 2π - 0 = 2π.\n\nFinally, we divide the net change in the argument by 2π to find the number of roots of g(z) = 0 in the annulus 1 < |z| < 2:\n\nNumber of roots = (2π) / (2π) = 1\n\nThus, there is 1 root of f(z) = 1 in the annulus 1 < |z| < 2."
