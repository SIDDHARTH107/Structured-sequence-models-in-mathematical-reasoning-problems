    "message_2": "Let J represent the number of apples John has, and let A represent the number of apples Jane has. We are given the following information:\n\nJ = 3\nA = 5\n\nWe want to represent J in terms of A. Since John has 3 apples and Jane has 5 apples, we can write the relationship between J and A as:\n\nJ = A - 2\n\nThis equation represents the number of apples John has (J) in terms of the number of apples Jane has (A)."
