    "message_2": "To partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets, we can use the Bell number. The Bell number B(n) is the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets.\n\nFor a set with 10 elements, we need to find the Bell number B(10). The Bell numbers can be computed using the following recurrence relation:\n\nB(n) = Î£[k=0 to n-1] C(n-1, k) * B(k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nUsing this recurrence relation, we can compute the Bell numbers for n = 1 to 10:\n\nB(0) = 1\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\nB(5) = 52\nB(6) = 203\nB(7) = 877\nB(8) = 4140\nB(9) = 21147\nB(10) = 115975\n\nSo, there are 115975 ways to partition a set of 10 elements into non-empty subsets."
