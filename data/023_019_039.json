    "message_2": "To determine if the system is stable or unstable, we will first take the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. Recall that the Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of the given differential equation, we get:\n\nY''(ω) + 2jωY'(ω) - ω^2Y(ω) = X(ω)\n\nwhere Y(ω) and X(ω) are the Fourier transforms of y(t) and x(t), respectively.\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of the input x(t) = sin(2t). Using the properties of the Fourier transform, we have:\n\nX(ω) = ∫[sin(2t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts or the Euler's formula to express sin(2t) as:\n\nsin(2t) = (1/2j) * (e^(2jt) - e^(-2jt))\n\nNow, the Fourier transform of x(t) becomes:\n\nX(ω) = (1/2j) * [∫(e^(2jt) * e^(-jωt) dt) - ∫(e^(-2jt) * e^(-jωt) dt)]\n\nX(ω) = (1/2j) * [∫(e^(-j(ω-2)t) dt) - ∫(e^(-j(ω+2)t) dt)]\n\nNow, we can integrate each term:\n\nX(ω) = (1/2j) * [(-1/j(ω-2)) * e^(-j(ω-2)t) |(from -∞ to ∞) - (-1/j(ω+2)) * e^(-j(ω+2)t) |(from -∞ to ∞)]\n\nX(ω) = (1/2j) * [(1/(ω-2)) - (1/(ω+2))]\n\nNow, we can substitute X(ω) into the transformed differential equation:\n\nY''(ω) + 2jωY'(ω) - ω^2Y(ω) = (1/2j) * [(1/(ω-2)) - (1/(ω+2))]\n\nTo find Y(ω), we can rearrange the equation and solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = (1/(-ω^2)) * [Y''(ω) + 2jωY'(ω) - (1/2j) * [(1/(ω-2)) - (1/(ω+2))]]\n\nNow, we need to check if the system is stable or unstable. A system is stable if the impulse response h(t) (inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω)) is absolutely integrable, i.e.,\n\n∫|h(t)| dt < ∞\n\nSince we have Y(ω) in terms of X(ω), we can find the impulse response h(t) by taking the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω). However, finding the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) analytically is quite complex.\n\nInstead, we can analyze the poles of Y(ω) to determine the stability of the system. The poles of Y(ω) are the values of ω for which Y(ω) goes to infinity. From the equation for Y(ω), we can see that there are poles at ω = ±2. Since these poles are on the imaginary axis (i.e., they have zero real parts), the system is marginally stable.\n\nIn conclusion, for the input x(t) = sin(2t), the system described by the given differential equation is marginally stable."
