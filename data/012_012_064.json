    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To find the girth of a graph G with 10 vertices and 15 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. First, we need to find the minimum degree of the graph. The minimum degree is the smallest number of edges connected to any vertex in the graph. Since there are 10 vertices and 15 edges, the average degree of the graph is (2 * 15) / 10 = 3. Therefore, the minimum degree of the graph must be at least 3.\n\n2. Now, let's consider the shortest cycle in the graph. If the girth is 3, then there must be a triangle in the graph. A triangle consists of 3 vertices, each connected to the other two vertices. Since the minimum degree is at least 3, it is possible that there is a triangle in the graph.\n\n3. If the girth is 4, then the shortest cycle is a quadrilateral. In this case, there must be a vertex connected to at least 4 other vertices. However, since the minimum degree is 3, it is not possible for the girth to be 4.\n\n4. If the girth is 5, then the shortest cycle is a pentagon. In this case, there must be a vertex connected to at least 5 other vertices. Since the minimum degree is 3, it is possible that there is a pentagon in the graph.\n\nTherefore, the girth of the graph G with 10 vertices and 15 edges could be either 3 or 5. To determine the exact girth, we would need more information about the specific connections between the vertices in the graph."
