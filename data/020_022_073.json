    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 3 units of resource X and 2 units of resource Y. Each unit of Product B requires 2 units of resource X and 4 units of resource Y. The company has 150 units of resource X and 100 units of resource Y available. If the profit per unit of Product A is $10 and the profit per unit of Product B is $15, what is the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let's use linear programming to solve this problem. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y, subject to the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 150 (resource X constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 100 (resource Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 150\n   y ≤ (150 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. 2x + 4y ≤ 100\n   y ≤ (100 - 2x) / 4\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 25), (20, 20), and (50, 0). We'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 25) = 10(0) + 15(25) = $375\n3. P(20, 20) = 10(20) + 15(20) = $500\n4. P(50, 0) = 10(50) + 15(0) = $500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertices (20, 20) and (50, 0), both with a profit of $500. However, producing 20 units of both Product A and Product B utilizes all available resources, while producing 50 units of Product A leaves some resources unused. Therefore, the optimal solution is to produce 20 units of Product A and 20 units of Product B to maximize the profit at $500."
