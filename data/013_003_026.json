    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player 1 has  \\$100 and must propose a division of the money to Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the proposal, the money is divided according to the proposal. If Player 2 rejects the proposal, both players receive nothing. What is the minimum percentage of the money that Player 1 should offer to Player 2 to ensure that Player 2 accepts the proposal? Assume that Player 2 is a rational player who would rather receive some money than no money.",
    "message_2": "Since Player 2 is a rational player and would prefer to receive some money rather than no money, Player 1 should offer the smallest amount possible that is still greater than zero. In this case, the minimum percentage of the money that Player 1 should offer to Player 2 is 1% of the $100, which is $1. This way, Player 2 will accept the proposal because they will receive some money ($1) instead of nothing."
