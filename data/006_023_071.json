    "message_1": "A study shows that out of 500 online shoppers, 80% of them tend to abandon their carts before completing their purchase. What is the probability that in a sample of 50 random online shoppers, at least 30 of them abandon their carts before completing their purchase?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, abandoning carts) in n trials (the sample size)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of abandoning a cart, which is 80% or 0.8)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the sample size of 50 online shoppers)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of shoppers who abandon their carts)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 30 out of 50 shoppers abandon their carts, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 30, 31, ..., 50.\n\nP(X >= 30) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 30 to 50\n\nCalculating this sum:\n\nP(X >= 30) = P(X = 30) + P(X = 31) + ... + P(X = 50)\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula for each term and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X >= 30) ≈ 0.999\n\nSo, the probability that at least 30 out of 50 random online shoppers abandon their carts before completing their purchase is approximately 99.9%."
