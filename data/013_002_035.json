    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the best responses for both players. A Nash equilibrium occurs when both players are playing their best response to the other player's strategy.\n\nFirst, let's find the best response for the row player (Player 1):\n\n- For column L: The maximum value is 2, which occurs in row T.\n- For column M: The maximum value is 3, which occurs in row M.\n- For column R: The maximum value is 2, which occurs in row T.\n\nNow, let's find the best response for the column player (Player 2):\n\n- For row T: The minimum value is 1, which occurs in column M.\n- For row M: The minimum value is -1, which occurs in column L.\n- For row B: The minimum value is -2, which occurs in column M.\n\nNow, we look for the cell(s) where both players are playing their best response. In this case, the Nash equilibrium occurs at the cell (M, M) with a payoff of 3 for Player 1 and -3 for Player 2."
