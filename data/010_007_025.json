Find the fundamental group of each space, and determine whether or not there is a covering map from $Y$ to $X$.",
    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of each space, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. Let's first consider the space $X$.\n\nFor $X$, we can divide the square into two rectangles $U$ and $V$ such that $U \\cap V$ is a strip in the middle of the square. Both $U$ and $V$ are contractible spaces, so their fundamental groups are trivial. The intersection $U \\cap V$ is homotopy equivalent to a circle, so its fundamental group is $\\mathbb{Z}$. By the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, the fundamental group of $X$ is the free product of the fundamental groups of $U$ and $V$ with amalgamation over the fundamental group of $U \\cap V$. Since the fundamental groups of $U$ and $V$ are trivial, the fundamental group of $X$ is $\\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nNow let's consider the space $Y$. We can divide the hexagon into three parallelograms $A$, $B$, and $C$ such that $A \\cap B$, $B \\cap C$, and $A \\cap C$ are strips in the middle of the hexagon. All three spaces $A$, $B$, and $C$ are contractible, so their fundamental groups are trivial. The intersections $A \\cap B$, $B \\cap C$, and $A \\cap C$ are homotopy equivalent to circles, so their fundamental groups are $\\mathbb{Z}$. By the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, the fundamental group of $Y$ is the free product of the fundamental groups of $A$, $B$, and $C$ with amalgamation over the fundamental groups of $A \\cap B$, $B \\cap C$, and $A \\cap C$. Since the fundamental groups of $A$, $B$, and $C$ are trivial, the fundamental group of $Y$ is $\\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3$.\n\nNow we need to determine whether or not there is a covering map from $Y$ to $X$. A necessary condition for a covering map to exist is that the fundamental group of the covering space (in this case, $Y$) must be a subgroup of the fundamental group of the base space (in this case, $X$). However, $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ is not a subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, so there cannot be a covering map from $Y$ to $X$."
