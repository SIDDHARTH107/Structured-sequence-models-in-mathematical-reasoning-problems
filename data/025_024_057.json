    "message_1": "A group of seven people want to sit at a circular table. How many unique seating arrangements are possible if two arrangements are considered identical when one can be obtained from the other by rotation? And, how many unique seating arrangements are possible if two arrangements are considered identical only when one can be obtained from the other by rotation or reflection about a diameter of the circle? Use geometric invariant theory to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using geometric invariant theory, we will consider the action of the symmetry group on the set of seating arrangements.\n\n1. Unique seating arrangements considering only rotations:\n\nThe symmetry group for a circular table with 7 seats is the cyclic group C_7, which has 7 elements (rotations by multiples of 2π/7). The number of unique seating arrangements can be found using Burnside's Lemma, which states that the number of orbits (unique seating arrangements) is equal to the average number of fixed points of the group elements.\n\nFor the identity element (rotation by 0), all 7! seating arrangements are fixed points. For the other 6 rotations, there are no fixed points, as rotating any arrangement by a non-zero multiple of 2π/7 will result in a different arrangement.\n\nUsing Burnside's Lemma, the number of unique seating arrangements considering only rotations is:\n\n(1/7) * (7! + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) = 6! = 720\n\n2. Unique seating arrangements considering rotations and reflections:\n\nNow we consider the dihedral group D_7, which has 14 elements (7 rotations and 7 reflections). We already know the fixed points for the rotations, so we only need to find the fixed points for the reflections.\n\nFor each reflection, we have a line of symmetry that passes through one seat and the midpoint of the opposite side. Since there are 7 seats, there are 7 lines of symmetry. A seating arrangement is fixed by a reflection if it is symmetric with respect to the line of symmetry. This means that the 3 people on each side of the line must be the same, so there are 3! ways to arrange them, and the person on the line of symmetry can be any of the remaining 4 people. Therefore, there are 4 * 3! fixed points for each reflection.\n\nUsing Burnside's Lemma, the number of unique seating arrangements considering rotations and reflections is:\n\n(1/14) * (7! + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 7 * (4 * 3!)) = (1/14) * (7! + 7 * (4 * 3!)) = 360\n\nSo, there are 720 unique seating arrangements considering only rotations, and 360 unique seating arrangements considering both rotations and reflections."
