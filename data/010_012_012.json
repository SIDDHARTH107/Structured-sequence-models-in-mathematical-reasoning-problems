    "message_2": "1. To show that f(x) is a smooth function, we need to prove that its derivatives exist and are continuous for all x. \n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of f(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - x^2) = 3x^2 - 2x\n\nNow let's find the second derivative of f(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 2x) = 6x - 2\n\nBoth the first and second derivatives are polynomials, which are continuous for all x. Therefore, f(x) is a smooth function.\n\n2. To find the critical points of f(x), we need to find the points where the first derivative is zero or undefined. Since f'(x) is a polynomial, it is never undefined. So, we set f'(x) to zero and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 2x = 0\nx(3x - 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two critical points: x = 0 and x = 2/3.\n\nNow, we use the second derivative test to classify these critical points. We evaluate the second derivative at each critical point:\n\nf''(0) = 6(0) - 2 = -2\nf''(2/3) = 6(2/3) - 2 = 2\n\nSince f''(0) < 0, the critical point x = 0 is a local maximum. Since f''(2/3) > 0, the critical point x = 2/3 is a local minimum. There are no saddle points in this case, as the second derivative test only applies to local minima and maxima."
