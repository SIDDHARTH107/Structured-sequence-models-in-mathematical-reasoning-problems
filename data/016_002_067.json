    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that starts with an equilateral triangle and adds a smaller equilateral triangle to each side at each iteration. The perimeter of the Koch snowflake after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (initial side length) * (number of sides) * (4/3)^n\n\nIn this case, the initial side length is 3 cm, and the curve has gone through 4 iterations. So, n = 4.\n\nPerimeter = 3 * 3 * (4/3)^4\nPerimeter = 9 * (256/81)\nPerimeter ≈ 9 * 3.1605\nPerimeter ≈ 28.4445 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve after 4 iterations is approximately 28.4445 cm."
