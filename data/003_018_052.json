    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we will use the chain rule and the sum rule. The sum rule states that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives, and the chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nSo, let's find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = sin(2x) + 3cos(4x)\n\nFirst, we'll find the derivative of sin(2x) with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx (sin(2x)) = cos(2x) * d(2x)/dx = cos(2x) * 2\n\nNow, we'll find the derivative of 3cos(4x) with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx (3cos(4x)) = -3sin(4x) * d(4x)/dx = -3sin(4x) * 4\n\nNow, we can use the sum rule to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx (y) = dy/dx (sin(2x) + 3cos(4x)) = 2cos(2x) - 12sin(4x)\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = 2cos(2x) - 12sin(4x)"
