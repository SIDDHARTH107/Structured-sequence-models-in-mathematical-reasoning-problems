    "message_2": "Let's denote the space obtained by removing a point from the unit circle X as Y. We want to find the fundamental group of Y, denoted as π₁(Y).\n\nSince X is a unit circle, it is homeomorphic to the circle S¹. Let's denote the removed point as p. Then, Y is homeomorphic to S¹ - {p}. We can use the deformation retraction to find a space that is homotopy equivalent to Y.\n\nConsider the punctured plane ℝ² - {0}, which is the plane with the origin removed. We can define a deformation retraction from ℝ² - {0} to S¹ - {p} as follows:\n\nF(x, t) = (1 - t)x + t(x/|x|)\n\nwhere x ∈ ℝ² - {0}, t ∈ [0, 1], and |x| is the Euclidean norm of x. This deformation retraction maps each point x in the punctured plane to a point on the circle S¹ - {p} as t goes from 0 to 1.\n\nSince ℝ² - {0} and S¹ - {p} are homotopy equivalent, their fundamental groups are isomorphic. The fundamental group of the punctured plane is known to be the integers, i.e., π₁(ℝ² - {0}) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the fundamental group of Y, which is homeomorphic to S¹ - {p}, is also isomorphic to the integers:\n\nπ₁(Y) ≅ π₁(S¹ - {p}) ≅ ℤ."
