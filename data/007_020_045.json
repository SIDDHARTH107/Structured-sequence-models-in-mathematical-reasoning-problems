    "message_2": "To find the private key d in RSA encryption, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n2. Compute the totient function φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\n3. Find the modular inverse of e mod φ(n), which is the private key d\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n1. n = p * q = 11 * 17 = 187\n2. φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (11-1) * (17-1) = 10 * 16 = 160\n3. Find d such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1, i.e., (d * 7) % 160 = 1\n\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse:\n\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\n    if a == 0:\n        return b, 0, 1\n    else:\n        g, x, y = extended_gcd(b % a, a)\n        return g, y - (b // a) * x, x\n\ndef mod_inverse(e, phi_n):\n    g, x, _ = extended_gcd(e, phi_n)\n    if g != 1:\n        raise Exception(\"Modular inverse does not exist\")\n    else:\n        return x % phi_n\n\nd = mod_inverse(7, 160) = 23\n\nSo, the private key d is 23."
