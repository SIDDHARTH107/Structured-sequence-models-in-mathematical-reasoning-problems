    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. In this problem, we have a graph with 6 vertices, and each vertex is connected to exactly 2 other vertices. This means that the graph must be a cycle graph or a disjoint union of cycle graphs.\n\nSince there are 6 vertices, there are two possible cases:\n\n1. The graph is a single cycle with 6 vertices (C6).\n2. The graph is a disjoint union of two cycles, one with 4 vertices (C4) and the other with 2 vertices (C2).\n\nCase 1: C6\nIn this case, there is a single cycle with 6 vertices. There are (6-1)!/2 = 5!/2 = 60 ways to arrange the vertices in a cycle. However, since the graph is undirected, we need to divide by 2 to account for the reverse orderings, which are the same cycle. So, there are 60/2 = 30 Hamiltonian cycles in this case.\n\nCase 2: C4 and C2\nIn this case, there are no Hamiltonian cycles, as it is impossible to visit all 6 vertices in a single cycle when the graph is a disjoint union of two cycles.\n\nTherefore, the total number of Hamiltonian cycles in this graph is 30."
