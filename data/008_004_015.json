    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The given system of linear equations can be written as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  0 ]\n[ 2  5 -3 |  0 ]\n[ 3  6 -4 |  0 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  0 ]\n[ 0  1 -1 |  0 ]\n[ 0  0  1 |  0 ]\n```\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can start the back-substitution process to find the solution.\n\nStep 2: Add the third row to the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  0 ]\n[ 0  1  0 |  0 ]\n[ 0  0  1 |  0 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Add the third row to the first row, and subtract 2 times the second row from the first row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  0 |  0 ]\n[ 0  1  0 |  0 ]\n[ 0  0  1 |  0 ]\n```\n\nThe resulting matrix represents the system of equations:\n\n```\nx = 0\ny = 0\nz = 0\n```\n\nSo, the solution for the given homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
