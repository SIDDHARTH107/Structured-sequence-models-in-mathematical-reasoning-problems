    "message_2": "To decrypt the Rail Fence Cipher with 4 rails, we need to arrange the ciphertext back into the original pattern and then read the plaintext along the rails. The pattern for 4 rails looks like this:\n\n```\n1       7       13\n 2     6 8     12 14\n  3   5   9   11   15\n   4       10      16\n```\n\nNow, we fill in the ciphertext into this pattern:\n\n```\nC       R       A\n R     A P     T O\n  G   P H I   Y R S\n   F N Y U O\n```\n\nReading along the rails, we get the plaintext: \"CRYPTOGRAPHYISFUN\"."
