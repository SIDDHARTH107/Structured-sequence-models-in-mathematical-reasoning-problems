    "message_2": "In a topological space with two connected components, A and B, there cannot be any continuous paths between points in A and points in B. This is because connected components are defined as the maximal connected subsets of a topological space, meaning that there are no continuous paths between points in different connected components.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of continuous paths that can be drawn from any point in A to any point in B is 0."
