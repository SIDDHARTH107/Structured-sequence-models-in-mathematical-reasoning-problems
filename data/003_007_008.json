    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle in the triangle, we'll use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c and angles A, B, and C opposite those sides, respectively:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, we have sides a = 7, b = 10, and c = 13. We want to find the smallest angle, which will be the angle opposite the shortest side (a = 7). So, we want to find angle A.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines:\n\n13² = 7² + 10² - 2(7)(10) * cos(A)\n\n169 = 49 + 100 - 140 * cos(A)\n\n20 = -140 * cos(A)\n\ncos(A) = -20/140 = -1/7\n\nNow, we'll find the angle A by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of -1/7:\n\nA = arccos(-1/7)\n\nA ≈ 97.41°\n\nThe smallest angle of the triangle is approximately 97.41°."
