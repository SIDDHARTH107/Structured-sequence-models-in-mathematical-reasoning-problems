For a closed orientable surface of genus g, the Euler characteristic is given by 2-2g.",
    "message_2": "Using the formula for the Euler characteristic of a closed orientable surface of genus g, which is χ = 2 - 2g, we can compute the Euler characteristic for a genus 2 surface.\n\nχ = 2 - 2(2) = 2 - 4 = -2\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a genus 2 surface is -2."
