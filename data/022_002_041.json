    "message_2": "To find the conformal map, we will perform a series of transformations to map the given domain onto the upper half plane.\n\n1. First, we map the domain enclosed by the circle $|z|=1$ and the line $x=1$ to the unit disk $|w|<1$ by using the transformation $w_1 = z - 1$. This maps the point $z=0$ to $w_1=-1$ and the line $x=1$ to the circle $|w_1|=1$.\n\n2. Next, we map the unit disk $|w_1|<1$ to the right half plane $\\text{Re}(w_2)>0$ using the Joukowski transformation $w_2 = w_1 + \\frac{1}{w_1}$. This maps the point $w_1=-1$ to $w_2=0$.\n\n3. Now, we map the right half plane $\\text{Re}(w_2)>0$ to the upper half plane $\\text{Im}(w_3)>0$ using the transformation $w_3 = w_2^2$. This maps the point $w_2=0$ to $w_3=0$.\n\n4. Finally, we map the upper half plane $\\text{Im}(w_3)>0$ to itself, such that the point $w_3=0$ is mapped to $w=i$. We can achieve this by using the transformation $w = w_3 + i$.\n\nNow, we can combine these transformations to obtain the conformal map:\n\n$$w = \\left(z - 1 + \\frac{1}{z - 1}\\right)^2 + i$$"
