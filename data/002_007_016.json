    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 6 cm and the lengths of its parallel sides are 8 cm and 12 cm. What is the area of this trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (sum of parallel sides) × height\n\nIn this case, the parallel sides are 8 cm and 12 cm, and the height is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (8 + 12) × 6\n\nArea = (1/2) × 20 × 6\n\nArea = 10 × 6\n\nArea = 60 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 60 square centimeters."
