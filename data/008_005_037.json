    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate y from the first and second equations. To do this, we will add the first and second equations:\n\nx + y + z = 5\n2x - y - z = -1\n-------------------\n3x = 4\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 4/3\n\nNext, let's eliminate y from the first and third equations. To do this, we will subtract the first equation from the third equation:\n\n3x + y + 2z = 11\n-(x + y + z = 5)\n-------------------\n2x + z = 6\n\nNow, substitute the value of x (4/3) into this equation:\n\n2(4/3) + z = 6\n8/3 + z = 6\n\nNow, solve for z:\n\nz = 6 - 8/3\nz = 18/3 - 8/3\nz = 10/3\n\nFinally, substitute the values of x and z into the first equation to find y:\n\n(4/3) + y + (10/3) = 5\n14/3 + y = 5\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\ny = 5 - 14/3\ny = 15/3 - 14/3\ny = 1/3\n\nSo, the solution for the system of equations is x = 4/3, y = 1/3, and z = 10/3."
