    "message_2": "To find the geodesic between points P and Q on the surface S, we need to find the shortest path between these two points that lies entirely on the surface S. We can parameterize the surface S using spherical coordinates:\n\nx = 3sin(θ)cos(φ)\ny = 3sin(θ)sin(φ)\nz = 3cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ ∈ [0, π] and φ ∈ [0, 2π].\n\nNow, we need to find the geodesic curve on the surface S. We can use the Euler-Lagrange equations to find the geodesic. First, we need to find the arc length of the curve on the surface S. The arc length L is given by:\n\nL = ∫(√(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2) dt\n\nWe can find the derivatives of x, y, and z with respect to t:\n\ndx/dt = ∂x/∂θ * dθ/dt + ∂x/∂φ * dφ/dt\ndy/dt = ∂y/∂θ * dθ/dt + ∂y/∂φ * dφ/dt\ndz/dt = ∂z/∂θ * dθ/dt + ∂z/∂φ * dφ/dt\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for x, y, and z in terms of θ and φ:\n\ndx/dt = (3cos(θ)cos(φ)) * dθ/dt - (3sin(θ)sin(φ)) * dφ/dt\ndy/dt = (3cos(θ)sin(φ)) * dθ/dt + (3sin(θ)cos(φ)) * dφ/dt\ndz/dt = (-3sin(θ)) * dθ/dt\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the arc length L:\n\nL = ∫(√((3cos(θ)cos(φ) * dθ/dt - 3sin(θ)sin(φ) * dφ/dt)^2 + (3cos(θ)sin(φ) * dθ/dt + 3sin(θ)cos(φ) * dφ/dt)^2 + (-3sin(θ) * dθ/dt)^2)) dt\n\nTo find the geodesic, we need to minimize the arc length L. We can use the Euler-Lagrange equations to find the geodesic. The Euler-Lagrange equations are given by:\n\n∂L/∂θ - d(∂L/∂(dθ/dt))/dt = 0\n∂L/∂φ - d(∂L/∂(dφ/dt))/dt = 0\n\nSolving these equations is quite involved and requires advanced techniques in differential geometry. However, once the equations are solved, we will obtain the geodesic curve on the surface S in terms of θ and φ.\n\nFinally, we need to find the values of θ and φ that correspond to the points P and Q. We can do this by solving the following equations:\n\n1 = 3sin(θ_P)cos(φ_P)\n-2 = 3sin(θ_P)sin(φ_P)\n2 = 3cos(θ_P)\n\nand\n\n2 = 3sin(θ_Q)cos(φ_Q)\n1 = 3sin(θ_Q)sin(φ_Q)\n-2 = 3cos(θ_Q)\n\nSolving these equations, we can find the values of θ_P, φ_P, θ_Q, and φ_Q. Then, we can substitute these values into the geodesic curve to find the geodesic between points P and Q on the surface S."
