    "message_2": "Let's call the height of the smaller cone h and the radius of its base r. Since the horizontal plane passes through the midpoint of the larger cone, the height of the smaller cone will be half of the height of the larger cone. So, h = 10/2 = 5 cm.\n\nNow, we need to find the radius r of the smaller cone. We can use similar triangles to do this. The ratio of the heights of the two cones is equal to the ratio of their radii:\n\nh / 10 = r / 4\n\nSubstitute h = 5:\n\n5 / 10 = r / 4\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/2 = r / 4\n\nNow, solve for r:\n\nr = 4 * 1/2 = 2 cm\n\nNow that we have the height and radius of the smaller cone, we can find its volume using the formula for the volume of a cone:\n\nV = (1/3)πr²h\n\nSubstitute r = 2 and h = 5:\n\nV = (1/3)π(2²)(5)\n\nV = (1/3)π(4)(5)\n\nV = (1/3)π(20)\n\nV ≈ (1/3)(3.14)(20)\n\nV ≈ 20.93 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the smaller cone is approximately 20.93 cm³, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
