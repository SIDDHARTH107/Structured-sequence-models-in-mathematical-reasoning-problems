    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nFirst, let's find the intersection of A and B:\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the elements that are in A or B, but not in their intersection:\nA Δ B = (A - (A ∩ B)) ∪ (B - (A ∩ B))\n\nThe elements in A but not in the intersection are:\nA - (A ∩ B) = {1}\n\nThe elements in B but not in the intersection are:\nB - (A ∩ B) = {4}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two sets:\nA Δ B = {1} ∪ {4} = {1, 4}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of A and B is {1, 4}.\n\nNow, let's exchange the positions of A and B and find the symmetric difference B Δ A:\n\nB Δ A = (B - (B ∩ A)) ∪ (A - (B ∩ A))\n\nSince the intersection of A and B is the same as the intersection of B and A, we can use the same intersection set {2, 3}:\n\nThe elements in B but not in the intersection are:\nB - (B ∩ A) = {4}\n\nThe elements in A but not in the intersection are:\nA - (B ∩ A) = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two sets:\nB Δ A = {4} ∪ {1} = {1, 4}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of B and A is {1, 4}.\n\nAs we can see, the symmetric difference of A and B is the same as the symmetric difference of B and A: {1, 4}. This demonstrates that the symmetric difference operation is commutative, meaning that the order of the sets does not affect the result."
