    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the system of linear equations:\n\n| 2  3  4 | 11 |\n| 5  6  7 | 16 |\n| 8  9 10 | 21 |\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to obtain an upper triangular matrix.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  1.5  2 |  5.5 |\n| 5  6    7 | 16   |\n| 8  9   10 | 21   |\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with (-5 * first row + second row) and the third row with (-8 * first row + third row):\n\n| 1  1.5    2 |  5.5  |\n| 0 -1.5   -3 | -11.5 |\n| 0 -3     -6 | -23   |\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -1.5 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n| 1  1.5  2 |  5.5 |\n| 0  1    2 |  7.67|\n| 0 -3   -6 | -23  |\n\nStep 4: Replace the first row with (-1.5 * second row + first row) and the third row with (3 * second row + third row):\n\n| 1  0  -1 | -6.5 |\n| 0  1   2 |  7.67|\n| 0  0   0 |  0   |\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix. However, the last row indicates that there is no unique solution for this system of linear equations, as the last row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 0, which is always true and doesn't provide any information about the variables.\n\nTo determine if the matrix of coefficients is ill-conditioned, we can calculate its determinant. If the determinant is close to zero, the matrix is considered ill-conditioned.\n\nThe matrix of coefficients is:\n\n| 2  3  4 |\n| 5  6  7 |\n| 8  9 10 |\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\ndet(A) = 2((6*10)-(7*9)) - 3((5*10)-(7*8)) + 4((5*9)-(6*8))\n       = 2(60-63) - 3(50-56) + 4(45-48)\n       = 2(-3) - 3(-6) + 4(-3)\n       = -6 + 18 - 12\n       = 0\n\nSince the determinant is exactly 0, the matrix of coefficients is singular and ill-conditioned. This confirms that the system of linear equations does not have a unique solution."
