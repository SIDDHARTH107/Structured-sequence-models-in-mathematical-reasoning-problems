    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, we will iteratively find augmenting paths from the source (node A) to the sink (node D) and update the flow along these paths until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, let's find an augmenting path from A to D. One possible path is A -> B -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is 4 (the capacity of the edge from A to B). We update the flow along this path and the residual capacities:\n\n   - Flow from A to B: 4 (Residual capacity: 0)\n   - Flow from A to C: 0 (Residual capacity: 3)\n   - Flow from B to D: 4 (Residual capacity: 1)\n   - Flow from C to D: 0 (Residual capacity: 6)\n   - Flow from B to C: 0 (Residual capacity: 2)\n\n2. Next, let's find another augmenting path. One possible path is A -> C -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is 3 (the capacity of the edge from A to C). We update the flow along this path and the residual capacities:\n\n   - Flow from A to B: 4 (Residual capacity: 0)\n   - Flow from A to C: 3 (Residual capacity: 0)\n   - Flow from B to D: 4 (Residual capacity: 1)\n   - Flow from C to D: 3 (Residual capacity: 3)\n   - Flow from B to C: 0 (Residual capacity: 2)\n\n3. Now, let's find another augmenting path. One possible path is A -> B -> C -> D. The minimum capacity along this path is 1 (the residual capacity of the edge from B to D). We update the flow along this path and the residual capacities:\n\n   - Flow from A to B: 3 (Residual capacity: 1)\n   - Flow from A to C: 3 (Residual capacity: 0)\n   - Flow from B to D: 5 (Residual capacity: 0)\n   - Flow from C to D: 4 (Residual capacity: 2)\n   - Flow from B to C: 1 (Residual capacity: 1)\n\nAt this point, there are no more augmenting paths from A to D. The maximum flow from A to D is the sum of the flows along the edges leaving A, which is 3 (A to B) + 3 (A to C) = 6."
