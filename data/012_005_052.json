    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. In other words, it is the greatest distance between any pair of vertices in the graph.\n\nTo find the diameter of a graph with 12 vertices and 22 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Find the minimum number of edges in a connected graph with 12 vertices. This can be calculated as 12 - 1 = 11 edges (a tree with 12 vertices has 11 edges).\n\n2. Find the maximum number of edges in a connected graph with 12 vertices and diameter 2. This can be calculated as a complete bipartite graph K_{6,6} with 6 vertices in each partition, which has 6 * 6 = 36 edges.\n\nSince our graph has 22 edges, which is between the minimum (11) and maximum (36) number of edges for a connected graph with 12 vertices and diameter 2, we can conclude that the diameter of this graph is at most 2.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact diameter. It could be 1 (if the graph is complete) or 2."
