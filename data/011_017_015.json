    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n Ã— n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we have a 3x3 Latin square with the numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n\nSince the top row is fixed, we only need to consider the possible arrangements of the remaining two rows. Let's denote the top row as (1, 2, 3).\n\nThere are two possible arrangements for the second row:\n\n1. (2, 3, 1)\n2. (3, 1, 2)\n\nFor each of these arrangements, there is only one possible arrangement for the third row that satisfies the Latin square condition:\n\n1. For the second row (2, 3, 1), the third row must be (3, 1, 2).\n2. For the second row (3, 1, 2), the third row must be (2, 3, 1).\n\nSo, there are 2 distinct 3x3 Latin squares that can be formed with the top row consisting of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in the given order."
