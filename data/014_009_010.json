    "message_1": "A Feistel cipher structure uses a round function that involves a substitution box (S-box) and a key, along with other operations. Suppose you are given a Feistel cipher that uses 4 rounds, an S-box with a 4-bit input and a 4-bit output, and a 16-bit key. If the plaintext is 8 bits long, what is the size of the corresponding ciphertext, and how many unique keys are possible for this cipher?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, the size of the plaintext and ciphertext remains the same. Since the plaintext is 8 bits long, the corresponding ciphertext will also be 8 bits long.\n\nFor the unique keys, since the key is 16 bits long, there are 2^16 possible unique keys. Therefore, there are 65,536 unique keys possible for this cipher."
