    "message_2": "To show that the number of critical points of $f$ on $\\mathbb{X}$ is bounded below by $\\sum_{i=0}^{n} b_i(\\mathbb{X};\\mathbb{Z})$, we will use the Morse inequalities. The Morse inequalities relate the number of critical points of a smooth function to the Betti numbers of its level sets. Specifically, they state that for any smooth function $f$ and any integer $k \\geq 0$, we have:\n\n$$M_k(f) \\geq b_k(\\mathbb{X};\\mathbb{Z})$$\n\nwhere $M_k(f)$ is the number of critical points of index $k$ of $f$. The index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of $f$ at that point. The Morse inequalities also state that:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{n} M_k(f) \\geq \\sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k(\\mathbb{X};\\mathbb{Z})$$\n\nNow, let's consider the specific case of a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ whose level set $\\mathbb{X}$ is homeomorphic to a 2-sphere and has Betti numbers $b_0 = b_3 = 1$ and $b_1 = b_2 = 0$. We want to find the lower bound on the number of critical points of $f$ on $\\mathbb{X}$.\n\nUsing the Morse inequalities, we have:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{3} M_k(f) \\geq \\sum_{k=0}^{3} b_k(\\mathbb{X};\\mathbb{Z})$$\n\nSubstituting the given Betti numbers, we get:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{3} M_k(f) \\geq 1 + 0 + 0 + 1$$\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{3} M_k(f) \\geq 2$$\n\nSo, the number of critical points of the function $f$ on the level set $\\mathbb{X}$ is bounded below by 2."
