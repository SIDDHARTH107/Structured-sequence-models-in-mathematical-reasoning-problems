    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to rewrite the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 4  2 |\n    | 2  8 |\n\nb = | 14 |\n    | 32 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a technique where matrix A is decomposed into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R, such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal basis for the column space of A:\n\nu1 = (4, 2)\nu2 = (2, 8) - proj_u1(2, 8)\n   = (2, 8) - ((2, 8) · (4, 2)) / ||(4, 2)||^2 * (4, 2)\n   = (2, 8) - (36 / 20) * (4, 2)\n   = (2, 8) - (1.8, 0.9)\n   = (0.2, 7.1)\n\nNow, normalize the orthogonal basis vectors to obtain the orthonormal basis:\n\ne1 = u1 / ||u1||\n   = (4, 2) / sqrt(4^2 + 2^2)\n   = (4, 2) / sqrt(20)\n   = (2/sqrt(5), 1/sqrt(5))\n\ne2 = u2 / ||u2||\n   = (0.2, 7.1) / sqrt(0.2^2 + 7.1^2)\n   = (0.2, 7.1) / sqrt(50.45)\n   = (1/sqrt(5), 3/sqrt(5))\n\nNow, we can form the Q and R matrices:\n\nQ = | 2/sqrt(5)  1/sqrt(5) |\n    | 1/sqrt(5)  3/sqrt(5) |\n\nR = | ||u1||  e1 · u2 |\n    |   0     ||u2||   |\n\nR = | sqrt(20)  36/20 |\n    |    0     sqrt(50.45) |\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Qtb:\n\nQt = | 2/sqrt(5)  1/sqrt(5) |\n     | 1/sqrt(5)  3/sqrt(5) |\n\nQt * b = | (2/sqrt(5)) * 14 + (1/sqrt(5)) * 32 |\n         | (1/sqrt(5)) * 14 + (3/sqrt(5)) * 32 |\n\nQt * b = | 70/sqrt(5) |\n         | 110/sqrt(5) |\n\nNow, we can solve the upper triangular system Rx = Qtb:\n\n| sqrt(20)  36/20 | | x |   | 70/sqrt(5) |\n|    0     sqrt(50.45) | | y | = | 110/sqrt(5) |\n\nDivide the first row by sqrt(20) and the second row by sqrt(50.45):\n\n| 1  36/20sqrt(20) | | x |   | 2 |\n| 0       1        | | y | = | 6 |\n\nNow, we can use back substitution to solve for x and y:\n\ny = 6\nx = 2 - (36/20sqrt(20)) * 6\nx = 2 - (9/sqrt(20)) * 6\nx = 2 - 54/sqrt(20)\nx = 2 - 27/sqrt(5)\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 2 - 27/sqrt(5)\ny = 6"
