    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of residents who watch the local news regularly, we will use the formula for the confidence interval of a proportion:\n\nCI = p-hat ± Z * sqrt((p-hat * (1 - p-hat)) / n)\n\nwhere:\n- CI is the confidence interval\n- p-hat is the sample proportion (45% or 0.45)\n- Z is the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval (1.96)\n- n is the sample size (200)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nSE = sqrt((p-hat * (1 - p-hat)) / n)\nSE = sqrt((0.45 * (1 - 0.45)) / 200)\nSE = sqrt((0.45 * 0.55) / 200)\nSE = sqrt(0.2475 / 200)\nSE ≈ 0.035\n\nNow, let's calculate the margin of error:\n\nME = Z * SE\nME = 1.96 * 0.035\nME ≈ 0.0686\n\nFinally, let's calculate the confidence interval:\n\nCI = p-hat ± ME\nCI = 0.45 ± 0.0686\nCI = (0.45 - 0.0686, 0.45 + 0.0686)\nCI ≈ (0.3814, 0.5186)\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of residents in the city who watch the local news regularly is approximately (0.3814, 0.5186), or (38.14%, 51.86%)."
