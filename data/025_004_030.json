    "message_2": "1. To find the singular points of the curve C, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + 4x. Then, the curve C is defined by the equation F(x, y) = 0. Now, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 + 4\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero:\n\n-3x^2 + 4 = 0\n2y = 0\n\nSolving the first equation for x, we get:\n\nx^2 = 4/3\nx = ±(2/√3)\n\nSince 2y = 0, we have y = 0. Now, we need to check if these points satisfy the original equation:\n\nFor x = 2/√3:\n\n(2/√3)^3 - 4(2/√3) = 8/√9 - 8/√3 = 0\n\nFor x = -2/√3:\n\n(-2/√3)^3 + 4(-2/√3) = -8/√9 + 8/√3 = 0\n\nThus, both points (2/√3, 0) and (-2/√3, 0) are singular points of the curve C.\n\n2. To determine if the curve C has any rational points, we can use the fact that it is a cubic curve and apply the Mordell-Weil theorem. However, finding all rational points on a cubic curve is a difficult task in general. Instead, we can try to find some rational points by inspection.\n\nOne obvious rational point is the origin (0, 0), since 0^2 = 0^3 - 4(0).\n\nAnother rational point can be found by considering the line x = 2. Substituting x = 2 into the equation of the curve, we get:\n\ny^2 = 2^3 - 4(2) = 8 - 8 = 0\n\nSo, y = 0, and the point (2, 0) is a rational point on the curve C.\n\nIn conclusion, the curve C has at least two rational points: (0, 0) and (2, 0)."
