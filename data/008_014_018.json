    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  1  1 |       X = | x |       B = |  6  |\n    | 2  3  4 |           | y |           | 20  |\n    | 4  5  6 |           | z |           | 34  |\n\nNow, we need to perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we need to find an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and the upper triangular matrix R.\n\n1. Find the orthogonal basis for A:\n\nu1 = a1 = (1, 2, 4)\nu2 = a2 - proj(u1, a2) = (1, 3, 5) - ((1, 3, 5)·(1, 2, 4))/(1^2 + 2^2 + 4^2) * (1, 2, 4) = (-1/3, 2/3, 2/3)\nu3 = a3 - proj(u1, a3) - proj(u2, a3) = (1, 1, 1) - ((1, 1, 1)·(1, 2, 4))/(1^2 + 2^2 + 4^2) * (1, 2, 4) - ((1, 1, 1)·(-1/3, 2/3, 2/3))/((-1/3)^2 + (2/3)^2 + (2/3)^2) * (-1/3, 2/3, 2/3) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nSince u3 is the zero vector, we have a linearly dependent system, which means there is no unique solution. However, we can still find a least-squares solution using QR decomposition.\n\n2. Normalize the orthogonal basis to form the orthonormal basis:\n\nq1 = u1/||u1|| = (1, 2, 4) / sqrt(1^2 + 2^2 + 4^2) = (1/3, 2/3, 4/3)\nq2 = u2/||u2|| = (-1/3, 2/3, 2/3) / sqrt((-1/3)^2 + (2/3)^2 + (2/3)^2) = (-1/3, 2/3, 2/3)\n\n3. Form the orthogonal matrix Q and the upper triangular matrix R:\n\nQ = |  1/3  -1/3 |\n      |  2/3   2/3 |\n      |  4/3   2/3 |\n\nR = | 3  3 |\n      | 0  3 |\n\nNow, we can solve the system RX = Q^T * B.\n\nQ^T * B = |  1/3   2/3   4/3 |  |  6  |\n                 | -1/3   2/3   2/3 |  | 20  |\n                 |  0      0      0  |  | 34  |\n\nQ^T * B = | 14 |\n                 |  4  |\n                 |  0  |\n\nNow, we can solve the system RX = Q^T * B:\n\n| 3  3 | | x |   | 14 |\n| 0  3 | | y | = |  4  |\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n\n3y = 4\ny = 4/3\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\n3x + 3y = 14\nx + y = 14/3\nx = 14/3 - 4/3\nx = 10/3\n\nSince we have a linearly dependent system, we cannot find a unique value for z. However, we can express z in terms of x and y:\n\nz = 6 - x - y\nz = 6 - 10/3 - 4/3\nz = 2/3\n\nSo, the least-squares solution for the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 10/3\ny = 4/3\nz = 2/3"
