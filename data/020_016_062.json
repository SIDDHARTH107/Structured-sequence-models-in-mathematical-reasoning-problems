    "message_1": "A mechanical engineer wants to design a light-weight support bracket for a machine that can withstand a force of 500 N. The bracket is made of a material that costs $10 per cubic centimeter. The engineer wants to optimize the design of the bracket to minimize the material cost while satisfying the load-bearing requirement. If the bracket can have any shape and size, what is the minimum material cost a  student can design the bracket with?",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum material cost for the bracket, we need more information about the material properties and the specific load-bearing requirements. For example, we need to know the material's strength (e.g., tensile strength, compressive strength, or yield strength) and the type of loading the bracket will experience (e.g., tension, compression, or bending). \n\nOnce we have this information, we can use optimization techniques, such as the Finite Element Method (FEM), to design the bracket with the minimum amount of material needed to satisfy the load-bearing requirement. Then, we can calculate the volume of the optimized bracket and multiply it by the material cost per cubic centimeter to find the minimum material cost.\n\nWithout the necessary information about the material properties and loading conditions, it is impossible to provide a specific minimum material cost for the bracket."
