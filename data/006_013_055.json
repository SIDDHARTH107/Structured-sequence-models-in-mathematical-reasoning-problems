    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a tornado occurring in a region that has historically experienced an average of 10 tornadoes per year, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, tornadoes) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events (tornadoes) in the given interval\n- λ (lambda) is the average rate of events (tornadoes) per interval (in this case, 10 tornadoes per year)\n- k is the number of events (tornadoes) we want to find the probability for\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of a tornado occurring in the region, we are interested in the probability of observing at least one tornado (k ≥ 1). To find this probability, we can calculate the complement probability, which is the probability of observing zero tornadoes (k = 0), and then subtract it from 1.\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\n\nUsing the Poisson PMF formula with k = 0:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-10) * 10^0) / 0! = e^(-10)\n\nNow, calculate the probability of at least one tornado:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - e^(-10) ≈ 0.9999546\n\nSo, the probability of a tornado occurring in the region is approximately 99.99546%. Keep in mind that this probability is based on historical data and assumes that the average rate of tornadoes remains constant."
