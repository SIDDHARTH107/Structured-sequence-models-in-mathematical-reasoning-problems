    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 35, and let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G.\n\nBy the first Sylow theorem, there exist Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups of G. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 7-subgroup. Then, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7.\n\nBy the third Sylow theorem, n_5 divides 7 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, n_7 divides 5 and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7), so n_7 = 1.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup, they are both normal in G (as any conjugate of a Sylow p-subgroup is also a Sylow p-subgroup, and there is only one of each). Let P = ⟨a⟩ and Q = ⟨b⟩, where a has order 5 and b has order 7.\n\nNow, consider the product of elements from P and Q: ab. Since P and Q are normal in G, we have:\n\n(ab)^5 = a^5b^5 = e, since a^5 = e and b commutes with a.\n\nSimilarly, (ab)^7 = a^7b^7 = e, since b^7 = e and a commutes with b.\n\nThe least common multiple of 5 and 7 is 35, so the order of ab is 35. Therefore, G has an element of order 35, which means G is a cyclic group generated by ab: G = ⟨ab⟩.\n\nAlternatively, if G is not cyclic, then G must be the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, as they are both normal and their intersection is trivial (only the identity element). In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7: G ≅ P × Q ≅ C_5 × C_7.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 35, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
