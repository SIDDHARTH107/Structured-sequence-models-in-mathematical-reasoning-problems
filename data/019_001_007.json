    "message_1": "Suppose you have two propositions: P: \"It is raining today\" and Q: \"The sky is cloudy.\" Use propositional logic to determine the truth value of the following proposition: \"If it is raining today, then the sky is cloudy.\"",
    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of the proposition \"If it is raining today, then the sky is cloudy,\" we can use the logical implication (→) operator. In propositional logic, the statement \"P → Q\" is true unless P is true and Q is false. The truth table for the implication operator is as follows:\n\nP | Q | P → Q\n--------------\nT | T |   T\nT | F |   F\nF | T |   T\nF | F |   T\n\nSince we don't have the actual truth values for P and Q, we cannot determine the specific truth value for the proposition \"If it is raining today, then the sky is cloudy.\" However, we can represent it symbolically as \"P → Q.\""
