Project A has a return on investment (ROI) of 10%, project B has an ROI of 15%, and project C has an ROI of 20%. However, due to limited resources, the company can only invest a maximum of $200,000 in project A, $150,000 in project B, and $250,000 in project C. \n\nWhat is the optimal allocation for the budget to maximize the total return on investment?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total return on investment, the company should allocate the budget to the projects with the highest ROI first, as long as the maximum investment for each project is not exceeded.\n\n1. Start by allocating the maximum amount to Project C, which has the highest ROI of 20%.\n   Investment in Project C: $250,000\n   Remaining budget: $500,000 - $250,000 = $250,000\n\n2. Next, allocate the maximum amount to Project B, which has the second-highest ROI of 15%.\n   Investment in Project B: $150,000\n   Remaining budget: $250,000 - $150,000 = $100,000\n\n3. Finally, allocate the remaining budget to Project A, which has the lowest ROI of 10%.\n   Investment in Project A: $100,000 (since the maximum investment for Project A is $200,000, this amount is within the limit)\n\nThe optimal allocation for the budget is:\n- $100,000 in Project A\n- $150,000 in Project B\n- $250,000 in Project C\n\nNow, let's calculate the total return on investment:\n\nROI_A = $100,000 * 10% = $10,000\nROI_B = $150,000 * 15% = $22,500\nROI_C = $250,000 * 20% = $50,000\n\nTotal ROI = ROI_A + ROI_B + ROI_C = $10,000 + $22,500 + $50,000 = $82,500"
