    "message_2": "Since the function f(z) is given in terms of the complex variable z, we first need to rewrite it in terms of the real and imaginary parts, x and y, where z = x + iy. Then, we can find the partial derivative with respect to x.\n\nLet z = x + iy, then:\n\nf(z) = 4(x + iy)^3 + 6(x + iy)^2 + 2(x + iy) + 1\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nf(z) = (4x^3 - 12x^2y - 12xy^2 + 4y^3) + i(12x^2y - 4x^3y - 4y^3 + 12y^2x) + (6x^2 - 6y^2) + i(12xy) + 2x + i(2y) + 1\n\nNow, we separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: u(x, y) = 4x^3 - 12x^2y - 12xy^2 + 4y^3 + 6x^2 - 6y^2 + 2x + 1\nImaginary part: v(x, y) = 12x^2y - 4x^3y - 4y^3 + 12y^2x + 12xy + 2y\n\nWe are interested in finding the partial derivative of the real part u(x, y) with respect to x:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂(4x^3 - 12x^2y - 12xy^2 + 4y^3 + 6x^2 - 6y^2 + 2x + 1)/∂x\n\nUsing basic rules of differentiation, we get:\n\n∂u/∂x = 12x^2 - 24xy - 12y^2 + 12x + 2\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this partial derivative at the point z = 2 + i, which corresponds to x = 2 and y = 1:\n\n∂u/∂x(2, 1) = 12(2)^2 - 24(2)(1) - 12(1)^2 + 12(2) + 2 = 48 - 48 - 12 + 24 + 2 = 14\n\nSo, the partial derivative of f(z) with respect to x at the point z = 2 + i is 14."
