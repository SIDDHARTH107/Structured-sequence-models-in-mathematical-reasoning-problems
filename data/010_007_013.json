    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of sheets in the covering map p: Y -> X as n. Since X is a connected space with a fundamental group π(X) isomorphic to the cyclic group Z/4Z, we know that the order of π(X) is 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the covering space Y. The fundamental group of Y, denoted as π(Y), is a subgroup of π(X) due to the covering map p. According to the covering space theory, the index of the subgroup π(Y) in π(X) is equal to the number of sheets n in the covering map p.\n\nSince π(X) is isomorphic to Z/4Z, its subgroups can only have orders that divide 4. Therefore, the possible orders for π(Y) are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n1. If the order of π(Y) is 1, then π(Y) is the trivial group, and the index of π(Y) in π(X) is 4. In this case, the covering map p has 4 sheets.\n\n2. If the order of π(Y) is 2, then π(Y) is isomorphic to Z/2Z, and the index of π(Y) in π(X) is 2. In this case, the covering map p has 2 sheets.\n\n3. If the order of π(Y) is 4, then π(Y) is isomorphic to π(X), and the index of π(Y) in π(X) is 1. In this case, the covering map p has 1 sheet, which means Y is homeomorphic to X.\n\nIn conclusion, the covering map p: Y -> X can have 1, 2, or 4 sheets, depending on the order of the fundamental group π(Y) of the covering space Y."
