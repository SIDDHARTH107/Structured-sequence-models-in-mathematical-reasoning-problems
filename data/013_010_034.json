    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in the context of Cournot Competition:\n\nTwo competing companies produce identical products and simultaneously set their output levels. The market demand curve for the product is given by P(Q) = 100 - 0.5Q, where P is price and Q is total output. Each company's cost function is C(qi) = 10qi, where qi is the output of the ith company. \n\na) Determine the Nash equilibrium output levels of the two companies.\nb) Calculate the equilibrium price and profits of each company.\nc) Suppose the two companies merge and act as a single monopolist. Determine the monopoly output level, price, and profits, and compare these values to those obtained in part b.",
    "message_2": "a) To determine the Nash equilibrium output levels of the two companies, we first need to find their reaction functions. The profit function for each company is given by:\n\nπi = P(Q)qi - C(qi) = (100 - 0.5(Q))qi - 10qi\n\nSince Q = q1 + q2, we can rewrite the profit function for each company as:\n\nπ1 = (100 - 0.5(q1 + q2))q1 - 10q1\nπ2 = (100 - 0.5(q1 + q2))q2 - 10q2\n\nNow, we find the first-order conditions by taking the partial derivative of each profit function with respect to its own output:\n\n∂π1/∂q1 = 100 - q1 - 0.5q2 - 10 = 0\n∂π2/∂q2 = 100 - q2 - 0.5q1 - 10 = 0\n\nSolving these two equations simultaneously, we get:\n\nq1 = 30\nq2 = 30\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium output levels for the two companies are q1 = 30 and q2 = 30.\n\nb) To calculate the equilibrium price and profits of each company, we first find the total output Q:\n\nQ = q1 + q2 = 30 + 30 = 60\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium price using the market demand curve:\n\nP(Q) = 100 - 0.5Q = 100 - 0.5(60) = 70\n\nThe equilibrium price is $70. To find the profits of each company, we can use their profit functions:\n\nπ1 = (100 - 0.5(60))(30) - 10(30) = 70(30) - 10(30) = 1800\nπ2 = (100 - 0.5(60))(30) - 10(30) = 70(30) - 10(30) = 1800\n\nThe equilibrium profits for each company are $1,800.\n\nc) If the two companies merge and act as a single monopolist, they will maximize their joint profit. The new cost function for the merged company is:\n\nC(Q) = 10Q\n\nThe profit function for the merged company is:\n\nπ = P(Q)Q - C(Q) = (100 - 0.5Q)Q - 10Q\n\nTo find the monopoly output level, we take the first-order condition by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to Q:\n\n∂π/∂Q = 100 - Q - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for Q, we get:\n\nQ = 90\n\nThe monopoly output level is 90 units. Now, we can find the monopoly price using the market demand curve:\n\nP(Q) = 100 - 0.5Q = 100 - 0.5(90) = 55\n\nThe monopoly price is $55. To find the monopoly profits, we can use the profit function:\n\nπ = (100 - 0.5(90))(90) - 10(90) = 55(90) - 10(90) = 4050\n\nThe monopoly profits are $4,050.\n\nComparing the monopoly values to the Cournot competition values, we see that the monopoly produces a higher output (90 vs. 60), charges a lower price ($55 vs. $70), and earns higher profits ($4,050 vs. $1,800 for each company)."
