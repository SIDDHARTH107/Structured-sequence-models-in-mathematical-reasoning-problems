    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:\n\n(2x + 1)(x + 2) = 3(x - 3)\n\nNow, we will expand the expressions:\n\n2x^2 + 4x + x + 2 = 3x - 9\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x^2 + 5x + 2 = 3x - 9\n\nMove all terms to one side of the equation:\n\n2x^2 + 2x + 11 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 2, and c = 11:\n\nx = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4(2)(11))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (-2 ± √(-84)) / 4\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. The equation (2x^2 + 2x + 11 = 0) has two complex solutions:\n\nx = (-1 ± √(21)i) / 2"
