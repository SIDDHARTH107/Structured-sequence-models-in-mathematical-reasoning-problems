    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B:\n\nA × B = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A × B and B, denoted as (A × B) ⊕ B:\n\nSince B contains only single elements and A × B contains ordered pairs, their intersection is empty. Therefore, the symmetric difference is the union of both sets:\n\n(A × B) ⊕ B = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), 3, 4}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and B, denoted as B ⊕ B:\n\nB ⊕ B = ∅ (empty set), because all elements in B are also in B.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and (B ⊕ B), denoted as A × (B ⊕ B):\n\nSince (B ⊕ B) is an empty set, the Cartesian product with any set will also be an empty set:\n\nA × (B ⊕ B) = ∅ (empty set)\n\nNow, we can see that the symmetric difference of (A × B) ⊕ B and A × (B ⊕ B) is:\n\n((A × B) ⊕ B) ⊕ (A × (B ⊕ B)) = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), 3, 4} ⊕ ∅\n\nSince the symmetric difference with an empty set is the set itself:\n\n((A × B) ⊕ B) ⊕ (A × (B ⊕ B)) = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets we found:\n\n(A × B) ⊕ B = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), 3, 4}\nA × (B ⊕ B) = ∅ (empty set)\n\nSince these two sets are not equal, we have shown that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
