    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nB × A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference (△) for each expression:\n\n(A × B) △ A = {elements in (A × B) but not in A} ∪ {elements in A but not in (A × B)}\n\nA × B has ordered pairs, while A has single elements, so there is no intersection between them. Therefore, the symmetric difference is the union of both sets:\n\n(A × B) △ A = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)} ∪ {1, 2, 3}\n\nA △ (B × A) = {elements in A but not in (B × A)} ∪ {elements in (B × A) but not in A}\n\nSimilarly, there is no intersection between A and B × A, so the symmetric difference is the union of both sets:\n\nA △ (B × A) = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow let's compare the two expressions:\n\n(A × B) △ A = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), 1, 2, 3}\n\nA △ (B × A) = {1, 2, 3, (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nThese two expressions are not equal, as the ordered pairs in each set are different."
