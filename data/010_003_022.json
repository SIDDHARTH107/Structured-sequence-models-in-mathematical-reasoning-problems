    "message_2": "To prove that the Euclidean plane with the usual metric is a T2 space, we need to show that for any two distinct points x and y in the plane, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x belongs to U and y belongs to V.\n\nLet x and y be two distinct points in the Euclidean plane. We can denote these points as x = (x1, x2) and y = (y1, y2). Since x and y are distinct, there must be some positive distance between them. Let d be the Euclidean distance between x and y, which can be calculated as:\n\nd = sqrt((x1 - y1)^2 + (x2 - y2)^2)\n\nNow, let's consider the open balls B(x, d/2) and B(y, d/2) centered at x and y, respectively, with radius d/2. By definition, these open balls are open sets in the Euclidean plane.\n\nWe claim that these open balls are disjoint. To prove this, suppose there exists a point z in the intersection of B(x, d/2) and B(y, d/2). Then, the distance between z and x is less than d/2, and the distance between z and y is also less than d/2. By the triangle inequality, we have:\n\nd = dist(x, y) ≤ dist(x, z) + dist(z, y) < d/2 + d/2 = d\n\nThis is a contradiction, as d cannot be less than itself. Therefore, there cannot be any point z in the intersection of B(x, d/2) and B(y, d/2), which means that these open balls are disjoint.\n\nFinally, we have x ∈ B(x, d/2) and y ∈ B(y, d/2), as the distance between x and itself (and y and itself) is 0, which is less than d/2. Thus, we have found disjoint open sets U = B(x, d/2) and V = B(y, d/2) such that x belongs to U and y belongs to V.\n\nTherefore, the Euclidean plane with the usual metric is a T2 space."
