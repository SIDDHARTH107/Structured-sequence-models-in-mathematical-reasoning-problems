Starting with an initial guess of x = 0, and using a learning rate of 0.1, what is the value of x after five iterations of the algorithm? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To use the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x.
