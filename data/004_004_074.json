    "message_2": "To calculate the area under the curve y = 2x between x = 1 and x = 5, we need to integrate the function y = 2x with respect to x from x = 1 to x = 5.\n\nThe integral of 2x with respect to x is x^2. So, we need to evaluate x^2 at the limits x = 1 and x = 5 and subtract the results.\n\nArea = (5^2 - 1^2) = (25 - 1) = 24 square units."
