    "message_2": "To find the non-abelian groups of order 24, we first consider the prime factorization of 24, which is 2^3 * 3. We can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups and their structures.\n\nLet's denote the number of Sylow 2-subgroups as n_2 and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups as n_3. By Sylow's third theorem, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we find that n_2 can be 1 or 3, and n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of the Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal. In this case, the Sylow 2-subgroup is of order 8, so it can be either Z_8, Z_4 × Z_2, or D_4 (cyclic, direct product, or dihedral group, respectively). The Sylow 3-subgroup is of order 3 and isomorphic to Z_3.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, and the Sylow 2-subgroup is of order 8 and isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_2. The Sylow 3-subgroup is of order 3 and isomorphic to Z_3.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible non-abelian groups of order 24:\n\n1. Z_8 × Z_3: This group is abelian, so we exclude it.\n2. (Z_4 × Z_2) × Z_3: This group is isomorphic to Z_6 × Z_4, which is abelian, so we exclude it.\n3. D_4 × Z_3: This group is non-abelian and has elements of order 2, 3, and 4.\n4. Z_4 × Z_2 ⋊ Z_3: This group is non-abelian and has elements of order 2, 3, and 4.\n5. Z_4 ⋊ Z_6: This group is non-abelian and has elements of order 2, 3, and 4.\n\nThus, we have found three non-abelian groups of order 24: D_4 × Z_3, Z_4 × Z_2 ⋊ Z_3, and Z_4 ⋊ Z_6.\n\nNow, let's consider the given group G = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l}, where every element has order 2, except for one element with order 3 and one element with order 4.\n\nSince G has an element of order 3 and an element of order 4, it cannot be isomorphic to D_4 × Z_3, as this group has elements of order 6. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to either Z_4 × Z_2 ⋊ Z_3 or Z_4 ⋊ Z_6."
