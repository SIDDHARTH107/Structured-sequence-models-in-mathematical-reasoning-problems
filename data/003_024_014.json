    "message_2": "To find the component of the velocity vector that is parallel to the ground, we need to use the horizontal component of the velocity. We can do this by using the cosine of the angle with respect to the horizontal.\n\nThe horizontal component of the velocity (Vx) can be found using the following formula:\n\nVx = V * cos(θ)\n\nwhere V is the total velocity (400 km/h), θ is the angle with respect to the horizontal (60°), and cos(θ) is the cosine of the angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 60°:\n\ncos(60°) = 0.5\n\nNow, we can find the horizontal component of the velocity:\n\nVx = 400 km/h * 0.5 = 200 km/h\n\nSo, the component of the velocity vector that is parallel to the ground is 200 km/h."
