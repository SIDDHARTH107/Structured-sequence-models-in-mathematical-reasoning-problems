    "message_2": "To find the rational points on the curve, we can use the method of elliptic curves. First, we rewrite the given equation in the form of an elliptic curve:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 + 2x^2 + x \\Rightarrow y^2 = x(x^2 + 2x + 1) = x(x+1)^2$\n\nNow, let's consider a point $(x_1, y_1)$ on the curve with rational coordinates. We want to find another point $(x_2, y_2)$ on the curve such that the line passing through $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ has rational slope.\n\nLet the slope of the line be $m$. Then, we have:\n\n$y_2 - y_1 = m(x_2 - x_1)$\n\nRearranging and solving for $y_2$, we get:\n\n$y_2 = y_1 + m(x_2 - x_1)$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for $y_2$ into the equation of the curve:\n\n$(y_1 + m(x_2 - x_1))^2 = x_2(x_2 + 1)^2$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get a quadratic equation in $x_2$:\n\n$(m^2 - 1)x_2^2 + (2m^2x_1 - 2mx_1 - 2m^2 - 2)x_2 + m^2x_1^2 - 2mx_1^2 + x_1^2 = 0$\n\nSince we know that $x_1$ is a solution to this equation (as $(x_1, y_1)$ lies on the curve), we can factor out $(x_2 - x_1)$:\n\n$(x_2 - x_1)(A x_2 + B) = 0$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are rational coefficients. Thus, either $x_2 = x_1$ or $x_2 = -\\frac{B}{A}$. In the first case, we get the same point $(x_1, y_1)$, which is not of interest. In the second case, we obtain a new point $(x_2, y_2)$ with rational coordinates.\n\nNow, we can use the group law on elliptic curves to find all rational points on the curve. Starting from a known rational point, we can repeatedly apply the group law to find new rational points. In this case, we can start with the point $(0,0)$, which lies on the curve.\n\nHowever, finding all rational points on an elliptic curve is a difficult task in general, and there is no simple formula to list all of them. The process of finding rational points can be quite involved and may require advanced techniques from number theory and algebraic geometry."
