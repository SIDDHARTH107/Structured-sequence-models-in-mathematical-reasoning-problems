    "message_2": "In the Sierpinski tetrahedron construction, the number of smaller tetrahedrons at each stage can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of Tetrahedrons = N^3\n\nwhere N is the number of smaller tetrahedrons along one edge of the larger tetrahedron at each stage.\n\nAt the first stage (Stage 0), there is only one tetrahedron (the original large tetrahedron). \n\nAt the second stage (Stage 1), the large tetrahedron is divided into 4 smaller tetrahedrons along each edge, so N = 2. Therefore, there are 2^3 = 8 tetrahedrons.\n\nAt the third stage (Stage 2), each of the 4 smaller tetrahedrons from Stage 1 is further divided into 4 smaller tetrahedrons, so N = 4. Therefore, there are 4^3 = 64 tetrahedrons.\n\nAt the fourth stage (Stage 3), each of the 64 smaller tetrahedrons from Stage 2 is further divided into 4 smaller tetrahedrons, so N = 8. Therefore, there are 8^3 = 512 tetrahedrons."
