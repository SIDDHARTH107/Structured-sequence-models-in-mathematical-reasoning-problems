    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface at the point P(1,2,12), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet the surface be parametrized by the vector function r(u,v) = (u, v, 4u^2 + v^2). Then, we can find the first fundamental form by calculating the tangent vectors and their dot products.\n\nru = dr/du = (1, 0, 8u)\nrv = dr/dv = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = ru • ru = 1 + 64u^2\nF = ru • rv = 16uv\nG = rv • rv = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNext, we need to find the second fundamental form. We can do this by finding the normal vector and taking its derivatives.\n\nThe normal vector N can be found by taking the cross product of ru and rv:\n\nN = ru × rv = (-8u, -2v, 1)\n\nNow, we normalize N:\n\n|N| = sqrt((-8u)^2 + (-2v)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(64u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nNormalized N = (-8u, -2v, 1) / |N|\n\nNow, we find the coefficients of the second fundamental form by taking the dot product of the derivatives of the normalized normal vector with the tangent vectors:\n\nL = (d(Normalized N)/du) • ru\nM = (d(Normalized N)/du) • rv\nN = (d(Normalized N)/dv) • rv\n\nAfter calculating the derivatives and dot products, we get:\n\nL = -8 / |N|\nM = -16 / |N|\nN = -4 / |N|\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H using the following formulas:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\nH = (LE + GN - 2FM) / 2(EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point P(1,2,12), we have:\n\nE = 1 + 64(1)^2 = 65\nF = 16(1)(2) = 32\nG = 1 + 4(2)^2 = 17\n|N| = sqrt(64(1)^2 + 4(2)^2 + 1) = sqrt(69)\n\nL = -8 / sqrt(69)\nM = -16 / sqrt(69)\nN = -4 / sqrt(69)\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H:\n\nK = ((-8/sqrt(69))(-4/sqrt(69)) - (-16/sqrt(69))^2) / (65*17 - 32^2) = -1/69\nH = ((-8/sqrt(69))(17) + (65)(-4/sqrt(69)) - 2(32)(-16/sqrt(69))) / 2(65*17 - 32^2) = -6/sqrt(69)\n\nThe sectional curvature of the surface at the point P(1,2,12) is K = -1/69."
