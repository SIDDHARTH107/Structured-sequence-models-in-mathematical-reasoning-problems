    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the frequency of each letter in the given message:\n\ny: 12, m: 2, n: 8, x: 6, t: 12, z: 10, s: 6, i: 8, j: 6, w: 4, q: 2, f: 6, d: 2\n\nThe most common letter is \"y\" with 12 occurrences, so we can assume that \"y\" represents \"e\" in the original message. Now we can start building the key by comparing the frequency of the other letters in the message to the frequency of letters in the English language.\n\nHere's a possible key based on frequency analysis:\n\ny -> e\nm -> t\nn -> h\nx -> a\nt -> o\nz -> n\ns -> r\ni -> s\nj -> u\nw -> c\nq -> m\nf -> d\nd -> f\n\nUsing this key, we can decrypt the message:\n\n\"ymn xnt zsi ytjwzqji yt fs idzy fsxjx tzyjwzynfsi, ymn xntzsi ytjwzqji yt fs idzy fsxjx tzyjwzynfsi.\"\n\nDecrypted message:\n\n\"the art of concealing the fact that fact and fiction are inseparable, the artist conceals the fact that fact and fiction are inseparable.\"\n\nThe decrypted message is a quote about the art of concealing the fact that fact and fiction are inseparable."
