    "message_1": "Suppose we have a Feistel cipher structure with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits. The number of rounds used in the cipher is 16. If the plaintext input is divided into two equal 32-bit parts, what is the size of the output?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, the block size remains the same throughout the encryption process. Since the block size is 64 bits and the plaintext input is divided into two equal 32-bit parts, the output will also have a block size of 64 bits."
