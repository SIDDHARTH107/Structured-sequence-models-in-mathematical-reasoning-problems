    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = 3cos(2t) + 4sin(3t), we can use the following formulas for the Fourier transform of cosine and sine functions:\n\nFourier transform of cos(at) = (1/2) [δ(ω - a) + δ(ω + a)]\nFourier transform of sin(at) = (-j/2) [δ(ω - a) - δ(ω + a)]\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function, a is the frequency of the cosine or sine function, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nNow, let's apply these formulas to the given function:\n\nFourier transform of 3cos(2t) = (3/2) [δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)]\nFourier transform of 4sin(3t) = (-4j/2) [δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3)]\n\nSince the Fourier transform is a linear operation, we can add these two results together:\n\nFourier transform of f(t) = (3/2) [δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)] - (2j) [δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3)]\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = 3cos(2t) + 4sin(3t) is:\n\nF(ω) = (3/2) [δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)] - 2j [δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3)]"
