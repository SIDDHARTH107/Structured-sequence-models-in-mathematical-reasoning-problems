    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 27, which is a power of a prime (3^3), we can apply the Sylow theorems to analyze the structure of G.\n\nLet n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, we know that n_3 must divide the order of G (27) and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. However, n_3 cannot be 3, 9, or 27, since these values do not satisfy the congruence condition n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Therefore, n_3 = 1.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let H be this normal Sylow 3-subgroup. The order of H is 3^2 = 9, so H is a group of order 9. Since H is a normal subgroup of G, we can form the quotient group G/H.\n\nThe order of G/H is |G|/|H| = 27/9 = 3, which is a prime. Therefore, G/H is a cyclic group of order 3. Let K be a subgroup of G such that G/H is isomorphic to K. Then, K is a cyclic group of order 3.\n\nNow, we have a normal subgroup H of order 9 and a cyclic subgroup K of order 3. Since the orders of H and K are relatively prime (gcd(9, 3) = 1), their intersection is trivial, i.e., H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nWe can now apply the following result from group theory: if H and K are subgroups of G such that H is normal, the orders of H and K are relatively prime, and their intersection is trivial, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, i.e., G ≅ H × K.\n\nIn our case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 (K) and a group of order 9 (H). Note that we have not shown that H is necessarily cyclic, so we cannot conclude that G is cyclic. However, we have shown that G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
