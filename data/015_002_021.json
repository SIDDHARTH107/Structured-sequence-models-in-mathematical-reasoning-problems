    "message_1": "Suppose a butterfly flaps its wings in Beijing, which leads to a tornado forming in Oklahoma. Assume that the butterfly flapping its wings changes the initial conditions of a chaotic system by about 0.00001%. If the tornado is directly caused by the butterfly's flap, and the maximum wind speed in the tornado is 200 mph, what would have been the maximum wind speed in the tornado if the butterfly had not flapped its wings?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the maximum wind speed in the tornado if the butterfly had not flapped its wings as x. Since the butterfly's flap changes the initial conditions by 0.00001%, we can write the equation:\n\nx + 0.00001% * x = 200 mph\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n1.00001 * x = 200\n\nDivide both sides by 1.00001:\n\nx ≈ 200 / 1.00001\n\nx ≈ 199.998 mph\n\nSo, the maximum wind speed in the tornado if the butterfly had not flapped its wings would have been approximately 199.998 mph."
