    "message_2": "The period of a double pendulum is a complex problem that cannot be solved using a simple formula. However, we can approximate the period using numerical methods or simulations. The period of a double pendulum depends on the initial conditions, masses, and lengths of the rods. In this case, we have the following parameters:\n\nm1 = m2 = 1 kg (masses of the pendulums)\nL1 = L2 = 0.5 m (lengths of the rods)\nθ1 = θ2 = 30 degrees (initial angles)\ng = 9.81 m/s² (gravitational acceleration)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the initial angles from degrees to radians:\n\nθ1 = θ2 = 30 * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can use the equations of motion for a double pendulum to approximate the period. The equations of motion are given by:\n\nd²θ1/dt² = (m2 * L1 * (dθ1/dt)² * sin(θ1 - θ2) * cos(θ1 - θ2) + m2 * g * sin(θ2) * cos(θ1 - θ2) + m2 * L2 * (dθ2/dt)² * sin(θ1 - θ2) - (m1 + m2) * g * sin(θ1)) / (L1 * (m1 + m2 * sin²(θ1 - θ2)))\n\nd²θ2/dt² = (-m2 * L2 * (dθ2/dt)² * sin(θ1 - θ2) * cos(θ1 - θ2) + (m1 + m2) * (g * sin(θ1) * cos(θ1 - θ2) - L1 * (dθ1/dt)² * sin(θ1 - θ2) - g * sin(θ2))) / (L2 * (m1 + m2 * sin²(θ1 - θ2)))\n\nThese equations are nonlinear and coupled, so they must be solved numerically. One common method to solve these equations is the Runge-Kutta method. By solving these equations, we can obtain the time evolution of the angles θ1 and θ2.\n\nTo find the period, we need to find the time it takes for the double pendulum to return to its initial state. This can be done by analyzing the time evolution of the angles and finding the time when both angles are close to their initial values (π/6 radians) and their velocities are close to zero.\n\nDue to the complexity of the problem, it is not possible to provide an exact value for the period without performing the numerical simulation. However, you can use software like Python or MATLAB to implement the Runge-Kutta method and find an approximate value for the period of the double pendulum with the given parameters."
