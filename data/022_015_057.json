    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Cauchy integral formula and the Phragmén-Lindelöf principle.\n\nFirst, let's consider a semicircle C_R with radius R > 0 centered at the origin in the upper half plane. The contour integral of f(z) along C_R can be written as:\n\n∫(f(z)/z^(n+1))dz, where n is a non-negative integer.\n\nUsing the Cauchy integral formula, we have:\n\nf^(n)(0) = n! * ∫(f(z)/z^(n+1))dz\n\nNow, let's estimate the integral along the arc of the semicircle. We have:\n\n|∫(f(z)/z^(n+1))dz| ≤ ∫|f(z)/z^(n+1)||dz|\n\nSince Re(f(z)) ≤ |z|^(1/2), we have |f(z)| ≤ |z|^(1/2). Thus,\n\n|∫(f(z)/z^(n+1))dz| ≤ ∫(|z|^(1/2)/|z|^(n+1))|dz|\n\n= ∫(1/|z|^(n+1/2))|dz|\n\nAs R → ∞, the integral along the arc goes to 0 for n ≥ 1. Therefore, f'(0) = 0, f''(0) = 0, and so on. This implies that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 2:\n\nf(z) = az^2 + bz + c\n\nNow, we will apply the Phragmén-Lindelöf principle to find the bounds on a and b. The principle states that if an entire function g(z) satisfies:\n\n1. |g(z)| ≤ M for all z in a region D\n2. g(z) is continuous in the closure of D\n3. g(z) is analytic in D\n\nThen, g(z) is a polynomial of degree at most m, where m is the number of zeros of g(z) in D.\n\nLet g(z) = f(z) - (az^2 + bz + c). Then, Re(g(z)) = Re(f(z)) - Re(az^2 + bz + c) ≤ |z|^(1/2) - Re(az^2 + bz + c).\n\nWe know that g(z) is entire, continuous in the closure of the upper half plane, and analytic in the upper half plane. Therefore, by the Phragmén-Lindelöf principle, g(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 1.\n\nSince g(z) = f(z) - (az^2 + bz + c), we have:\n\nf(z) = az^2 + bz + c + g(z)\n\nSince g(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 1, we have:\n\nf(z) = az^2 + bz + c + (d_1z + d_0)\n\nNow, we need to find the bounds on a and b. Since Re(f(z)) ≤ |z|^(1/2), we have:\n\nRe(az^2 + bz + c) + Re(d_1z + d_0) ≤ |z|^(1/2)\n\nAs z goes to infinity along the positive real axis, we have:\n\nRe(a)z^2 + Re(b)z + Re(c) + Re(d_1)z + Re(d_0) ≤ |z|^(1/2)\n\nThis inequality can only hold if Re(a) = 0, Re(b) = 0, and Re(d_1) = 0. Thus, a and b are purely imaginary, and we can write:\n\na = iA, b = iB, where A and B are real numbers.\n\nNow, consider the case when z goes to infinity along the imaginary axis. We have:\n\n-Ay^2 + By + Re(c) + Re(d_0) ≤ |iy|^(1/2)\n\nThis inequality can only hold if A ≤ 2 and B ≤ 1/2. Therefore, we have:\n\nf(z) = az^2 + bz + c = (iA)z^2 + (iB)z + c\n\nwith |a| = |iA| ≤ 2 and |b| = |iB| ≤ 1/2."
