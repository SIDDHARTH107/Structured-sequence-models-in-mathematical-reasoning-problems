    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (2x^2 + 1)(3x - 4) using the product rule, we first need to identify the two functions being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = 2x^2 + 1\nv(x) = 3x - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = d(2x^2 + 1)/dx = 4x\nv'(x) = d(3x - 4)/dx = 3\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is given by:\n\nd(uv)/dx = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nSo, applying the product rule to f(x):\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\nf'(x) = (4x)(3x - 4) + (2x^2 + 1)(3)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 16x + 6x^2 + 3\nf'(x) = 18x^2 - 16x + 3\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (2x^2 + 1)(3x - 4) is f'(x) = 18x^2 - 16x + 3."
