    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one component failing, we can first find the probability of none of the components failing and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a component not failing is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nSince the components are independent, the probability of all components not failing is the product of their individual probabilities of not failing:\n\n0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.92236816\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one component failing:\n\n1 - 0.92236816 = 0.07763184\n\nSo, the probability of at least one component failing in the system is approximately 0.0776 or 7.76%."
