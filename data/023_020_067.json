    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π], we first need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since f(x) is an even function, all b_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to compute the a_n coefficients.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series of an even function is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x)]\n\nwhere the coefficients a_n are given by:\n\na_0 = (1 / (2 * L)) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) dx\na_n = (1 / L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nFor our function f(x) = x^2 and interval [-π, π], L = π. Let's compute a_0 and a_n:\n\na_0 = (1 / (2 * π)) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 dx\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * cos(n * x) dx\n\nTo compute the integrals, we can use integration by parts for a_n:\n\nLet u = x^2 and dv = cos(n * x) dx\nThen du = 2x dx and v = (1/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [(x^2 * (1/n) * sin(n * x))|[-π, π] - ∫[-π, π] (1/n) * sin(n * x) * 2x dx]\n\nThe first term (x^2 * (1/n) * sin(n * x))|[-π, π] evaluates to zero because sin(n * x) is zero at x = -π and x = π. So we are left with:\n\na_n = (-2 / (n * π)) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(n * x) dx\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts again:\n\nLet u = x and dv = sin(n * x) dx\nThen du = dx and v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\na_n = (-2 / (n * π)) * [(-x * (1/n) * cos(n * x))|[-π, π] - ∫[-π, π] (-1/n) * cos(n * x) dx]\n\nThe first term (-x * (1/n) * cos(n * x))|[-π, π] evaluates to zero because x = -π and x = π. So we are left with:\n\na_n = (2 / (n^2 * π)) * ∫[-π, π] cos(n * x) dx\n\nThis integral evaluates to zero for n ≠ 0 because cos(n * x) is an odd function. Therefore, a_n = 0 for n ≠ 0.\n\nNow, let's compute a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / (2 * π)) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 dx = (1 / (2 * π)) * [(1/3) * x^3]|[-π, π] = (π^2 / 3)\n\nSo the Fourier series of f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = (π^2 / 3)\n\nSince all a_n coefficients are zero for n ≠ 0, there is no singularity at x = 0. The Fourier series representation of f(x) = x^2 is a constant function equal to (π^2 / 3) on the interval [-π, π]."
