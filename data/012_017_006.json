    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges in a graph such that every vertex is connected to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges share a vertex. In this graph, we have 6 vertices, so we need to find the maximum number of disjoint pairs of vertices that can be connected by edges.\n\nLet's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F, as shown in the image:\n\n![graph image with labels](https://i.imgur.com/5Z5Y5Zi.png)\n\nWe can see that vertex A is connected to vertices B, C, and D. Let's consider each of these connections as a starting point for a perfect matching:\n\n1. If A is connected to B, then we have two options for the remaining vertices: C-D and E-F. So, there is one perfect matching in this case: {A-B, C-D, E-F}.\n\n2. If A is connected to C, then we have two options for the remaining vertices: B-D and E-F. So, there is one perfect matching in this case: {A-C, B-D, E-F}.\n\n3. If A is connected to D, then we have no options for the remaining vertices since B and C are not connected, and E and F are not connected. So, there are no perfect matchings in this case.\n\nTherefore, there are a maximum of 2 perfect matchings possible in this graph:\n\n1. {A-B, C-D, E-F}\n2. {A-C, B-D, E-F}"
