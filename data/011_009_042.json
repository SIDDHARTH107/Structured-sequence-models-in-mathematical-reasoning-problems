    "message_2": "To partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets, we use the Bell number, denoted as B(n). The Bell number counts the number of different ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets.\n\nFor a set of 5 elements, we want to find B(5). The first few Bell numbers are:\n\nB(0) = 1\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\n\nTo find B(5), we can use the recurrence relation:\n\nB(n) = Î£ [C(n-1, k) * B(k)], where the sum is taken over k from 0 to n-1 and C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.\n\nUsing this relation, we can calculate B(5):\n\nB(5) = C(4, 0) * B(0) + C(4, 1) * B(1) + C(4, 2) * B(2) + C(4, 3) * B(3) + C(4, 4) * B(4)\n\nB(5) = 1 * 1 + 4 * 1 + 6 * 2 + 4 * 5 + 1 * 15\n\nB(5) = 1 + 4 + 12 + 20 + 15\n\nB(5) = 52\n\nSo, there are 52 ways to partition a set of 5 elements into non-empty subsets."
