    "message_2": "To determine whether A and B are open or closed in the subspace topology induced on X by the usual topology on ℝ, we will examine their intersections with open and closed intervals in ℝ.\n\nRecall that a set is open in the subspace topology if and only if it is the intersection of an open set in the larger space (ℝ in this case) with the subspace (X in this case). Similarly, a set is closed in the subspace topology if and only if it is the intersection of a closed set in the larger space with the subspace.\n\nLet's first consider A:\n\nA = {[n, n + 1) ∩ ℚ : n ∈ ℤ}\n\nFor each n ∈ ℤ, the interval [n, n + 1) is open in ℝ. The intersection of an open interval with ℚ will still be open in the subspace topology induced on X by the usual topology on ℝ. Since A is a union of these open sets, A is open in the subspace topology.\n\nNow let's consider B:\n\nB = {[n, n + 1] ∩ ℚ : n ∈ ℤ}\n\nFor each n ∈ ℤ, the interval [n, n + 1] is closed in ℝ. However, the intersection of a closed interval with ℚ does not necessarily result in a closed set in the subspace topology induced on X by the usual topology on ℝ. To show this, consider the complement of B in X:\n\nX - B = X ∩ (ℝ - B)\n\nSince B consists of all rational numbers in closed intervals [n, n + 1], the complement of B in ℝ consists of all irrational numbers in the same intervals. The intersection of this complement with X will be a union of open intervals (n, n + 1) containing only irrational numbers. This union of open intervals is open in ℝ, and thus X - B is open in the subspace topology induced on X by the usual topology on ℝ.\n\nSince the complement of B is open, B is closed in the subspace topology induced on X by the usual topology on ℝ.\n\nIn conclusion, A is open and B is closed in the subspace topology induced on X by the usual topology on ℝ."
