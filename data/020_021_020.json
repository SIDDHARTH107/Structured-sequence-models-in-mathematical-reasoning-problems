Machine 1 produces 2 products in an hour, Machine 2 produces 3 products in an hour, and Machine 3 produces 4 products in an hour. Assuming all machines take the same amount of time to set up, how many hours should be allocated to each machine to maximize production?",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z be the number of hours allocated to Machine 1, Machine 2, and Machine 3, respectively. We want to maximize the total production, which is given by the equation:\n\nTotal production = 2x + 3y + 4z\n\nSubject to the constraint:\n\nx + y + z = 8 (since the total number of hours is 8)\n\nTo maximize production, we want to allocate more hours to the machine with the highest production rate. In this case, Machine 3 has the highest production rate of 4 products per hour. Therefore, we should allocate as many hours as possible to Machine 3.\n\nLet's first allocate all 8 hours to Machine 3:\n\nz = 8\n\nNow, we have no more hours left to allocate to Machine 1 and Machine 2:\n\nx = 0\ny = 0\n\nWith this allocation, the total production is:\n\nTotal production = 2(0) + 3(0) + 4(8) = 32 products\n\nHowever, this allocation does not utilize all three machines. To maximize production, we should also allocate some hours to Machine 2, which has the second-highest production rate.\n\nLet's allocate 1 hour to Machine 2 and 7 hours to Machine 3:\n\ny = 1\nz = 7\n\nNow, we have no more hours left to allocate to Machine 1:\n\nx = 0\n\nWith this allocation, the total production is:\n\nTotal production = 2(0) + 3(1) + 4(7) = 3 + 28 = 31 products\n\nWe can see that allocating 1 hour to Machine 2 and 7 hours to Machine 3 results in a lower total production than allocating all 8 hours to Machine 3. Therefore, the optimal allocation is:\n\nMachine 1: 0 hours\nMachine 2: 0 hours\nMachine 3: 8 hours\n\nThis allocation maximizes production at 32 products."
