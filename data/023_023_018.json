    "message_2": "To analyze the frequency components present in the transmitted signal, we will use the Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform is a mathematical tool that decomposes a signal into its constituent frequencies. It is defined as:\n\nF(w) = ∫ f(t) * e^(-j*w*t) dt\n\nwhere F(w) is the Fourier Transform of the signal f(t), w is the angular frequency (2π times the frequency in Hz), and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven that the communication network transmits a signal frequency of 15 kHz, we can assume that the signal is a sinusoidal wave:\n\nf(t) = A * sin(2π * 15000 * t + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the signal, and φ is the phase shift.\n\nNow, we will compute the Fourier Transform of the signal:\n\nF(w) = ∫ A * sin(2π * 15000 * t + φ) * e^(-j*w*t) dt\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can use the Euler's formula:\n\nsin(x) = (e^(jx) - e^(-jx)) / (2j)\n\nSo, the signal f(t) can be rewritten as:\n\nf(t) = A * (e^(j*(2π * 15000 * t + φ)) - e^(-j*(2π * 15000 * t + φ))) / (2j)\n\nNow, we can compute the Fourier Transform:\n\nF(w) = ∫ A * (e^(j*(2π * 15000 * t + φ)) - e^(-j*(2π * 15000 * t + φ))) / (2j) * e^(-j*w*t) dt\n\nF(w) = A/(2j) * ∫ (e^(j*(2π * 15000 * t + φ)) * e^(-j*w*t) - e^(-j*(2π * 15000 * t + φ)) * e^(-j*w*t)) dt\n\nF(w) = A/(2j) * (∫ e^(j*(2π * 15000 * t + φ - w*t)) dt - ∫ e^(-j*(2π * 15000 * t + φ + w*t)) dt)\n\nThe integrals above are complex exponentials, and their Fourier Transforms result in Dirac delta functions:\n\nF(w) = A/(2j) * (2π * δ(w - 2π * 15000) * e^(jφ) - 2π * δ(w + 2π * 15000) * e^(-jφ))\n\nF(w) = Aπ * (δ(w - 2π * 15000) * e^(jφ) / j - δ(w + 2π * 15000) * e^(-jφ) / j)\n\nFrom the Fourier Transform, we can see that there are two frequency components present in the transmitted signal:\n\n1. A positive frequency component at 15 kHz with a phase shift of φ.\n2. A negative frequency component at -15 kHz with a phase shift of -φ.\n\nThese are the frequency components present in the transmitted signal of the communication network."
