    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm and the lengths of its parallel sides are 10 cm and 16 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Let's call the two non-parallel sides a and b, and let's call the height h. We know that h = 8 cm, and the lengths of the parallel sides are 10 cm and 16 cm.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of a and b. First, let's find the difference in length between the parallel sides: 16 - 10 = 6 cm. Now, we can create two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the non-parallel sides to the opposite parallel side.\n\nIn the first right triangle, the height is 8 cm, and the base is half of the difference in length between the parallel sides, which is 6/2 = 3 cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of side a:\n\na^2 = h^2 + (3)^2\na^2 = 8^2 + 3^2\na^2 = 64 + 9\na^2 = 73\na = √73\n\nIn the second right triangle, the height is still 8 cm, and the base is the other half of the difference in length between the parallel sides, which is also 3 cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of side b:\n\nb^2 = h^2 + (3)^2\nb^2 = 8^2 + 3^2\nb^2 = 64 + 9\nb^2 = 73\nb = √73\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all four sides, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\n\nPerimeter = 10 + 16 + √73 + √73\nPerimeter ≈ 26 + 2(√73)\nPerimeter ≈ 26 + 17.146\nPerimeter ≈ 43.146 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 43.146 cm."
