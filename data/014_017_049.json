    "message_1": "Suppose you have been given the ciphertext \"GEEKSFORGEEKS\" which has been encrypted using a substitution cipher. You have also been given the frequencies of each letter in the English language (as a percentage of total letters). Use frequency analysis to determine the plaintext message.",
    "message_2": "To perform frequency analysis, we first need to count the occurrences of each letter in the ciphertext and compare it to the known frequencies of letters in the English language. Here's the ciphertext \"GEEKSFORGEEKS\" with the count of each letter:\n\nG: 3\nE: 5\nK: 2\nS: 2\nF: 1\nO: 1\nR: 1\n\nNow, let's consider the frequencies of letters in the English language (rounded to the nearest whole number):\n\nE: 13%\nT: 9%\nA: 8%\nO: 8%\nI: 7%\nN: 7%\nS: 6%\nH: 6%\nR: 6%\nD: 4%\nL: 4%\nC: 3%\nU: 3%\nM: 3%\nW: 2%\nF: 2%\nG: 2%\nY: 2%\nP: 2%\nB: 1%\nV: 1%\nK: 1%\nJ: 1%\nX: 1%\nQ: 1%\nZ: 1%\n\nSince E is the most common letter in the ciphertext and also the most common letter in English, we can assume that E in the ciphertext corresponds to E in the plaintext. Next, we can look at the other letters. G has the second-highest frequency in the ciphertext, and T has the second-highest frequency in English, so we can assume that G corresponds to T.\n\nFollowing this logic, we can make some educated guesses about the other letters. However, since the ciphertext is relatively short, it's difficult to make accurate assumptions for all the letters. We can try to decipher the message with the information we have so far:\n\nGEEKSFORGEEKS\nTEE_EFO_TEE_S\n\nAt this point, it's difficult to determine the exact plaintext message using frequency analysis alone. We would need more context or a longer ciphertext to make more accurate assumptions. However, given the partial decryption, we can guess that the plaintext message might be \"TESTEFFECTS\" or \"TESTEFTOETS\"."
