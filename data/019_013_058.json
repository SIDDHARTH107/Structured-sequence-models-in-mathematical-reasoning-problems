    "message_2": "The statement is true in second-order logic.\n\nThe statement says that for every set A of integers, there exists a set B of integers such that for every element x in A, there exists an element y in B such that x > y.\n\nTo prove this, let's consider the set B to be the set of all integers that are one less than the integers in A. In other words, for every x in A, let y = x - 1. Then, y is an integer and x > y.\n\nSo, for any given set A of integers, we can construct a set B of integers such that for every x in A, there exists a y in B with x > y. Therefore, the statement is true in second-order logic."
