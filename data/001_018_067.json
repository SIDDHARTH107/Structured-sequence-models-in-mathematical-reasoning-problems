    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we can use the properties of logarithms:\n\n1. log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b)\n2. log(a) - log(b) = log(a / b)\n\nApplying these properties, we get:\n\nlog(base 2)8 + log(base 2)16 - log(base 2)4 = log(base 2)(8 * 16) - log(base 2)4\n= log(base 2)(128) - log(base 2)4\n\nNow, we can apply the second property:\n\n= log(base 2)(128 / 4)\n= log(base 2)32\n\nNow, we need to find the exponent to which the base (2) must be raised to obtain the number (32). In other words, we need to find x in the equation 2^x = 32.\n\n2^x = 32\n2^x = 2^5 (since 2^5 = 32)\n\nSince the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal as well:\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is:\n\nlog(base 2)32 = 5"
