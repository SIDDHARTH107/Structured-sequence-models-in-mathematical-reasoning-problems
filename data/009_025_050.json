    "message_1": "Here's an example problem for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider a European call option on a stock with a current price of $100. The option has a strike price of $110 and matures in 1 year. The risk-free interest rate is 5% per annum. The stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion with an initial volatility of 30% per annum and a long-term volatility of 20% per annum. Use the Black-Scholes-Merton equation to find the price of this call option at time t=0.",
    "message_2": "To find the price of the call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation, we first need to calculate the following parameters:\n\n1. d1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + σ^2/2)T) / (σ√T)\n2. d2 = d1 - σ√T\n3. Call option price = SN(d1) - Ke^(-rT)N(d2)\n\nWhere:\nS = current stock price = $100\nK = strike price = $110\nr = risk-free interest rate = 5% per annum = 0.05\nT = time to maturity = 1 year\nσ = volatility = 30% per annum = 0.3 (initial volatility)\nN(x) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\nln = natural logarithm\ne = Euler's number (approximately 2.71828)\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.05 + 0.3^2/2) * 1) / (0.3 * √1)\nd1 = (ln(0.9091) + (0.05 + 0.045)) / 0.3\nd1 = (-0.0953 + 0.095) / 0.3\nd1 = -0.0003 / 0.3\nd1 ≈ -0.001\n\nd2 = d1 - σ√T\nd2 = -0.001 - 0.3 * √1\nd2 = -0.001 - 0.3\nd2 ≈ -0.301\n\nNow, we need to find the values of N(d1) and N(d2). Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator:\n\nN(-0.001) ≈ 0.4993\nN(-0.301) ≈ 0.3817\n\nFinally, let's calculate the call option price:\n\nCall option price = SN(d1) - Ke^(-rT)N(d2)\nCall option price = 100 * 0.4993 - 110 * e^(-0.05 * 1) * 0.3817\nCall option price = 49.93 - 110 * 0.9512 * 0.3817\nCall option price = 49.93 - 110 * 0.3623\nCall option price = 49.93 - 39.85\nCall option price ≈ $10.08\n\nSo, the price of the European call option at time t=0 is approximately $10.08."
