Show that the number of subgroups of order 2 in a group of order 12 is either 1, 3, or 6, and use this result to prove that any group of order 12 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, or the dihedral group D6.",
    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 12. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of 2-Sylow subgroups (subgroups of order 4) divides the order of the group and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups is either 1 or 3. Let n_2 be the number of 2-Sylow subgroups.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of elements of order 2 in G. If an element x has order 2, then x^2 = e (the identity element), so x is in a subgroup of order 2. Conversely, if x is in a subgroup of order 2, then x has order 2. Therefore, counting the number of elements of order 2 in G is equivalent to counting the number of subgroups of order 2 in G.\n\nIf n_2 = 1, then there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup H. Since |H| = 4, H must have exactly 3 elements of order 2 (excluding the identity element). Thus, there are 3 subgroups of order 2 in G.\n\nIf n_2 = 3, then there are three 2-Sylow subgroups H_1, H_2, and H_3. Each of these subgroups has 3 elements of order 2. However, we must be careful not to double-count any elements that are in more than one of these subgroups. The intersection of any two distinct 2-Sylow subgroups must be trivial (i.e., contain only the identity element) because their orders are both powers of 2 and their intersection would be a subgroup of both. Therefore, there are no elements of order 2 that are in more than one 2-Sylow subgroup, so there are a total of 3 * 3 = 9 elements of order 2 in G. Since G has 12 elements, there must be 12 - 9 = 3 elements of order 1 or 3. Since there is only one element of order 1 (the identity element), there must be 2 elements of order 3. These two elements generate a subgroup of order 3, which is unique since 3 is prime. Thus, there are 6 subgroups of order 2 in G.\n\nIn summary, the number of subgroups of order 2 in a group of order 12 is either 1, 3, or 6.\n\nNow, let's use this result to classify groups of order 12:\n\n1. If there is only 1 subgroup of order 2, then G must be a cyclic group of order 12, denoted C12.\n\n2. If there are 3 subgroups of order 2, then G must have a normal 2-Sylow subgroup (by the Sylow Theorems). Let H be this normal 2-Sylow subgroup, and let K be the unique subgroup of order 3. Since H and K are both normal in G, their product HK is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since |H| = 4 and |K| = 3, we have |HK| = |H||K|/|H âˆ© K| = 12, so HK = G. Thus, G is a semidirect product of H and K. Since the only group of order 3 is cyclic, K is isomorphic to C3. The group H is either isomorphic to C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). If H is isomorphic to C4, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6. If H is isomorphic to V4, then G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4.\n\n3. If there are 6 subgroups of order 2, then G must have 3 non-normal 2-Sylow subgroups. In this case, G is isomorphic to the symmetric group S3 acting on the set of 2-Sylow subgroups, which is also isomorphic to the dihedral group D6.\n\nThus, any group of order 12 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, or the dihedral group D6."
