    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = |  3  2 -4 |\n    | -2  7  2 |\n    |  1 -1 -3 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = |  6 |\n    | -1 |\n    |  0 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a method of decomposing a matrix A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing a QR decomposition calculator or software (such as NumPy in Python), we find:\n\nQ = | -0.8018  0.5345  0.2673 |\n    |  0.5345  0.7772  0.3333 |\n    | -0.2673  0.3333 -0.9045 |\n\nR = | -3.7417 -4.1602  4.5345 |\n    |  0      6.8739  0.5345 |\n    |  0      0      2.6833 |\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Q^Tb, where Q^T is the transpose of matrix Q.\n\nQ^Tb = | -0.8018  0.5345 -0.2673 | |  6 |\n       |  0.5345  0.7772  0.3333 | |-1 |\n       |  0.2673  0.3333 -0.9045 | |  0 |\n\nQ^Tb = |  4.8028 |\n       | -0.8018 |\n       | -1.3397 |\n\nNow, we can solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^Tb using back substitution:\n\nR = | -3.7417 -4.1602  4.5345 | | x |   |  4.8028 |\n    |  0      6.8739  0.5345 | | y | = |-0.8018 |\n    |  0      0      2.6833 | | z |   | -1.3397 |\n\nSolving for x, y, and z, we get:\n\nz = -1.3397 / 2.6833 ≈ -0.5\ny = (-0.8018 - 0.5345 * z) / 6.8739 ≈ 0.5\nx = (4.8028 + 4.1602 * y - 4.5345 * z) / -3.7417 ≈ 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately x ≈ 1, y ≈ 0.5, and z ≈ -0.5."
