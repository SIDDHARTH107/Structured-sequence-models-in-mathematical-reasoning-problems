    "message_1": "Suppose that $f(z)$ is a meromorphic function on the complex plane such that $\\text{Res}_{z=1} f(z) = 2$ and $\\text{Res}_{z=2} f(z) = -3$. If $f(z)$ has no other singularities, then what is the sum of the residues of $f(z)$ on the imaginary axis?",
    "message_2": "Since $f(z)$ is a meromorphic function on the complex plane, it has only isolated singularities. We are given that $f(z)$ has singularities at $z=1$ and $z=2$, with residues 2 and -3, respectively. We are also given that $f(z)$ has no other singularities.\n\nBy the residue theorem, the sum of the residues of a meromorphic function on a closed contour is equal to $2\\pi i$ times the winding number of the contour around the singularities. In this case, we are interested in the sum of the residues of $f(z)$ on the imaginary axis.\n\nConsider the rectangular contour with vertices at $-R, -R+iR, R+iR, R$, where $R$ is a large positive real number. The contour consists of the imaginary axis and three other line segments. Since $f(z)$ has no singularities other than at $z=1$ and $z=2$, the winding number of this contour around the singularities is 0. Therefore, the sum of the residues of $f(z)$ on this contour is 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the residues of $f(z)$ on the three other line segments of the contour. As $R$ becomes very large, the contributions from these line segments become negligible. Therefore, the sum of the residues of $f(z)$ on the imaginary axis is equal to the sum of the residues of $f(z)$ on the entire contour, which is 0."
