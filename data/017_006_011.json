    "message_2": "A group of order 15 has 15 elements. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, the possible groups of order 15 are either cyclic or a direct product of cyclic groups of prime order.\n\nSince 15 = 3 * 5, where 3 and 5 are prime numbers, there are two possible groups of order 15:\n\n1. A cyclic group of order 15, denoted as Z_15 or C_15.\n2. A direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 3 and 5, denoted as Z_3 × Z_5 or C_3 × C_5.\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these groups are isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 3 and 5.\n\nThe group Z_3 × Z_5 is already a direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 3 and 5, so it is isomorphic to itself.\n\nThe group Z_15 is a cyclic group of order 15, and it can be generated by an element of order 15. Since 15 = 3 * 5, and 3 and 5 are coprime, Z_15 is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 3 and 5 by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In other words, Z_15 is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_5.\n\nSo, both possible groups of order 15 (Z_15 and Z_3 × Z_5) are isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 3 and 5."
