    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the system of linear equations in matrix form Ax = b:\n\nA = | 4  2  1 |      x = | x |      b = | 18 |\n    | 2  5  2 |          | y |          | 27 |\n    | 0  2  9 |          | z |          | 55 |\n\nNow, we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. Cholesky decomposition states that a symmetric positive-definite matrix A can be decomposed into a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T, such that A = LL^T.\n\n1. Calculate the lower triangular matrix L:\n\nL11 = sqrt(A11) = sqrt(4) = 2\nL21 = A21 / L11 = 2 / 2 = 1\nL31 = A31 / L11 = 0 / 2 = 0\n\nL22 = sqrt(A22 - L21^2) = sqrt(5 - 1^2) = 2\nL32 = (A32 - L31 * L21) / L22 = (2 - 0 * 1) / 2 = 1\n\nL33 = sqrt(A33 - L31^2 - L32^2) = sqrt(9 - 0^2 - 1^2) = sqrt(8)\n\nSo, the lower triangular matrix L is:\n\nL = | 2  0  0 |\n    | 1  2  0 |\n    | 0  1  sqrt(8) |\n\n2. Solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n| 2  0  0 | | y1 |   | 18 |\n| 1  2  0 | | y2 | = | 27 |\n| 0  1  sqrt(8) | | y3 |   | 55 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 18 / 2 = 9\ny2 = (27 - 1 * 9) / 2 = 9\ny3 = (55 - 1 * 9) / sqrt(8) = 23 / sqrt(8)\n\n3. Solve the system L^T x = y for x:\n\n| 2  1  0 | | x |   | 9 |\n| 0  2  1 | | y | = | 9 |\n| 0  0  sqrt(8) | | z |   | 23 / sqrt(8) |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nz = (23 / sqrt(8)) / sqrt(8) = 23 / 8\ny = (9 - 1 * (23 / 8)) / 2 = (49 / 8) / 2 = 49 / 16\nx = (9 - 1 * (49 / 16)) / 2 = (95 / 16) / 2 = 95 / 32\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 95 / 32\ny = 49 / 16\nz = 23 / 8"
