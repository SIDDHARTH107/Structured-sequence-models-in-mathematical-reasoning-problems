If 7 students are taking both Mathematics and Science, 4 are taking both Mathematics and History, 3 are taking both Science and History, and 2 are taking all three subjects, then how many students are taking only one subject?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of students taking only one subject, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of students taking at least two subjects:\n- 7 students are taking both Mathematics and Science.\n- 4 students are taking both Mathematics and History.\n- 3 students are taking both Science and History.\nSo, there are a total of 7 + 4 + 3 = 14 students taking at least two subjects.\n\nHowever, we have counted the students taking all three subjects twice. There are 2 students taking all three subjects, so we need to subtract them once to get the correct count of students taking at least two subjects: 14 - 2 = 12 students.\n\nNow, we can find the number of students taking only one subject by subtracting the number of students taking at least two subjects from the total number of students: 30 - 12 = 18 students.\n\nTherefore, 18 students are taking only one subject."
