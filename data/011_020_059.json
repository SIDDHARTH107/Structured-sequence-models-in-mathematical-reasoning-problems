    "message_2": "To find the number of different teams that can be formed, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of employees (20), k is the number of employees in each team (5), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nC(20, 5) = 20! / (5!(20-5)!)\n\nC(20, 5) = 20! / (5!15!)\n\nC(20, 5) = (20 * 19 * 18 * 17 * 16) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(20, 5) = 15504\n\nSo, there are 15,504 different 5-person teams that can be formed from the 20 employees."
