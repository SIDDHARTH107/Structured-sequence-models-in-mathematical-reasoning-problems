    "message_1": "A daycare center has 12 toddlers playing at a given time. On average, each toddler has a 5% chance of needing to use the restroom in the next 30 minutes. What is the probability that at least 2 toddlers will need to use the restroom in the next 30 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of k successes (toddlers needing to use the restroom) in n trials (12 toddlers), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (5% or 0.05), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (95% or 0.95).\n\nFirst, we will find the probability of 0 toddlers needing to use the restroom and 1 toddler needing to use the restroom. Then, we will subtract these probabilities from 1 to find the probability of at least 2 toddlers needing to use the restroom.\n\nP(X = 0) = C(12, 0) * 0.05^0 * 0.95^12\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * 0.54036\nP(X = 0) = 0.54036\n\nP(X = 1) = C(12, 1) * 0.05^1 * 0.95^11\nP(X = 1) = 12 * 0.05 * 0.56880\nP(X = 1) = 0.34224\n\nNow, we will find the probability of at least 2 toddlers needing to use the restroom:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1)\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - 0.54036 - 0.34224\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - 0.88260\nP(X ≥ 2) = 0.11740\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 toddlers will need to use the restroom in the next 30 minutes is approximately 11.74%."
