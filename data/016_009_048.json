    "message_1": "A fractal known as the Dragon curve is created by recursively adding turns to a line segment. Starting with a line segment of length 1, the first iteration adds a right turn and a line segment of length 1, followed by a left turn and another line segment of length 1. Each subsequent iteration replaces every line segment with the basic pattern of the first iteration.\n\nIf a Dragon curve of length 8 is drawn, how many line segments will it contain?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of line segments in a Dragon curve of length 8, we need to find the number of line segments after each iteration. The number of line segments doubles with each iteration.\n\n1. Initial line segment: 1 line segment\n2. First iteration: 2 line segments\n3. Second iteration: 4 line segments\n4. Third iteration: 8 line segments\n\nSince a Dragon curve of length 8 is drawn, it means that it has gone through 3 iterations. Therefore, it will contain 8 line segments."
