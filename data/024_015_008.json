    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative $d\\omega$, we need to take the exterior derivative of each term in $\\omega$ and sum them up. Recall that the exterior derivative of a differential form is given by taking the partial derivatives with respect to each variable and then wedging the result with the corresponding differential.\n\nFor the first term, $x^2 dy \\wedge dz$, we have:\n$$\nd(x^2 dy \\wedge dz) = (2x dx) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n\nFor the second term, $yz dz \\wedge dx$, we have:\n$$\nd(yz dz \\wedge dx) = (y dz + z dy) \\wedge dz \\wedge dx\n$$\n\nFor the third term, $x^3 dx \\wedge dy$, we have:\n$$\nd(x^3 dx \\wedge dy) = (3x^2 dx) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n\nNow, we sum up these terms to get the exterior derivative $d\\omega$:\n$$\nd\\omega = (2x dx) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + (y dz + z dy) \\wedge dz \\wedge dx + (3x^2 dx) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate $d\\omega$ at the point $(1,2,3)$:\n$$\nd\\omega(1,2,3) = (2(1) dx) \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + (2 dz + 3 dy) \\wedge dz \\wedge dx + (3(1)^2 dx) \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n\n$$\nd\\omega(1,2,3) = 2 dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + (2 dz + 3 dy) \\wedge dz \\wedge dx + 3 dx \\wedge dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n\nSince $dx \\wedge dx = 0$, the last term vanishes, and we are left with:\n$$\nd\\omega(1,2,3) = 2 dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz + (2 dz + 3 dy) \\wedge dz \\wedge dx\n$$"
