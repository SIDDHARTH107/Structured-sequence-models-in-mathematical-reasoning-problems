    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose 3 books from a collection of 8 books using Pascal's Triangle, we can use the combination formula, which is derived from Pascal's Triangle:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 8 (the total number of books) and k = 3 (the number of books we want to choose). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!5!)\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(8, 3) = (8 × 7 × 6) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(8, 3) = 336 / 6\n\nC(8, 3) = 56\n\nSo there are 56 ways to choose 3 books from a collection of 8 books using Pascal's Triangle."
