    "message_2": "To evaluate the limit of the function (x^2 + x - 6)/(x - 2) as x approaches 2, we first try to factor the numerator:\n\nx^2 + x - 6 = (x - 2)(x + 3)\n\nNow, the function can be written as:\n\n(x^2 + x - 6)/(x - 2) = (x - 2)(x + 3)/(x - 2)\n\nWe can cancel out the (x - 2) terms:\n\n(x - 2)(x + 3)/(x - 2) = x + 3\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 2:\n\nlim (x -> 2) (x + 3) = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the limit of the function (x^2 + x - 6)/(x - 2) as x approaches 2 is 5."
