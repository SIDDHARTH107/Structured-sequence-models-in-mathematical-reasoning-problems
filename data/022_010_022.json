    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = 1/(z-1)(z-2), we first perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = A/(z-1) + B/(z-2)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (z-1)(z-2), we get:\n\n1 = A(z-2) + B(z-1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by setting z = 1 and z = 2:\n\nFor z = 1: 1 = A(1-2) + B(1-1) => A = -1\nFor z = 2: 1 = A(2-2) + B(2-1) => B = 1\n\nSo, f(z) = -1/(z-1) + 1/(z-2)\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion for each term:\n\n-1/(z-1) = -1 * (1/(1-z)) = -1 * (1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + ... ) = -1 - z - z^2 - z^3 - ...\n\n1/(z-2) = 1/(2(1-z/2)) = (1/2) * (1/(1-z/2)) = (1/2) * (1 + z/2 + (z/2)^2 + (z/2)^3 + ... ) = (1/2) + z/4 + z^2/8 + z^3/16 + ...\n\nAdding the two series together, we get the Laurent series expansion of f(z):\n\nf(z) = (-1 - z - z^2 - z^3 - ...) + (1/2 + z/4 + z^2/8 + z^3/16 + ...) = -z/2 - z^2/2 - z^3/2 - ...\n\nThe radius of convergence of the series is determined by the singularities of f(z). The singularities are the points where the function is not analytic, which are the poles of the function. In this case, the poles are at z = 1 and z = 2. The distance from the center of the series (z = 0) to the closest singularity determines the radius of convergence. The closest singularity is z = 1, so the radius of convergence is 1.\n\nFinally, we classify the singularities of f(z). Both singularities are poles of order 1, as the factors (z-1) and (z-2) have an exponent of 1 in the denominator. Therefore, the singularities are simple poles."
