    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTO\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid and fill it with the key and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is combined with I in the Playfair cipher). The grid will look like this:\n\n   C  R  Y  P  T\n   O  A  B  D  E\n   F  G  H  I  K\n   L  M  N  S  U\n   V  W  X  Z  Q\n\n2. Split the plaintext into pairs of letters. If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them. If there's an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end:\n\n   MA  TH  EM  AT  IC  SX\n\n3. For each pair of letters, apply the Playfair rules:\n\n   - If the letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their immediate right (wrapping around if necessary):\n   - If the letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters immediately below them (wrapping around if necessary):\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other corners of the rectangle:\n\n   MA -> PK\n   TH -> YD\n   EM -> FO\n   AT -> PK\n   IC -> YB\n   SX -> ZN\n\n4. Combine the encrypted pairs to get the ciphertext:\n\n   PKYDFOPKYBZN\n\nSo, the encrypted message using the Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTO\" is \"PKYDFOPKYBZN\"."
