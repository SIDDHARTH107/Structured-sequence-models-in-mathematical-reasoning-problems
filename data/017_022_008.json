    "message_2": "To determine if G is isomorphic to C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, we will analyze the structure of G using Sylow theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 60, which can be factored as 2^2 * 3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 * 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, and 15. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 2^2 * 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 10. Finally, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 2^2 * 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 5, so n_5 can only be 1.\n\n1. If n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1, then G has unique Sylow subgroups P_2, P_3, and P_5 of orders 4, 3, and 5, respectively. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Since the orders of P_2, P_3, and P_5 are pairwise coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3 × P_5, which is a cyclic group of order 60 (C60).\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 10, then G cannot be isomorphic to C60, as C60 has unique Sylow subgroups. In this case, G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. The factor group G/P_5 has order 12, and there are two non-isomorphic groups of order 12: the cyclic group C12 and the alternating group A4. If G/P_5 is isomorphic to A4, then G is an extension of A4 by C5, which is the alternating group A5 × C2. If G/P_5 is isomorphic to C12, then G is an extension of C12 by C5, which is one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, depending on the number of its Sylow subgroups. To determine which one G is isomorphic to, we would need more information about the structure of G."
