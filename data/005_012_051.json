    "message_1": "A local ice cream shop wants to estimate the average number of scoops of ice cream customers purchase per visit. They survey a random sample of 50 customers and find that the average number of scoops is 2.5 with a standard deviation of 1.2. What is the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean number of scoops purchased per visit?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean number of scoops purchased per visit, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 2.5, the standard deviation is 1.2, and the sample size is 50. For a 95% confidence interval, the critical value (z-score) is approximately 1.96.\n\nConfidence Interval = 2.5 ± (1.96 * (1.2 / √50))\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 1.2 / √50 ≈ 0.1697\n\nNow, let's calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 0.1697 ≈ 0.3326\n\nFinally, let's calculate the confidence interval:\n\nLower Limit = 2.5 - 0.3326 ≈ 2.1674\nUpper Limit = 2.5 + 0.3326 ≈ 2.8326\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true population mean number of scoops purchased per visit is approximately (2.1674, 2.8326)."
