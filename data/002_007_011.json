    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula: Area = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height\n\nIn this case, base1 = 8 cm, base2 = 14 cm, and height = 5 cm.\n\nArea = (1/2) * (8 + 14) * 5\nArea = (1/2) * (22) * 5\nArea = 11 * 5\nArea = 55 square centimeters\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 55 square centimeters."
