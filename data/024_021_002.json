    "message_2": "a) To find the Killing vector fields, we need to solve the Killing equation:\n\n$$\\nabla_\\mu X_\\nu + \\nabla_\\nu X_\\mu = 0$$\n\nwhere $X_\\mu$ are the components of the Killing vector field and $\\nabla_\\mu$ is the covariant derivative associated with the metric $g$. In our case, we have the metric components:\n\n$$g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nand the inverse metric components:\n\n$$g^{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow, we compute the Christoffel symbols:\n\n$$\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$$\n\nAfter calculating the Christoffel symbols, we find that all of them are zero. This means that the covariant derivative is just the ordinary partial derivative:\n\n$$\\nabla_\\mu X_\\nu = \\partial_\\mu X_\\nu$$\n\nNow, we can solve the Killing equation:\n\n$$\\partial_\\mu X_\\nu + \\partial_\\nu X_\\mu = 0$$\n\nThis equation gives us the following system of equations:\n\n1. $\\partial_x X_x + \\partial_y X_y = 0$\n2. $\\partial_x X_y + \\partial_y X_x = 0$\n3. $\\partial_x X_z + \\partial_z X_x = 0$\n4. $\\partial_y X_z + \\partial_z X_y = 0$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find three linearly independent solutions:\n\n1. $X^{(1)} = (1, 0, 0)$\n2. $X^{(2)} = (0, 1, 1)$\n3. $X^{(3)} = (0, -1, 1)$\n\nThese are the Killing vector fields of the metric.\n\nb) The isometry group of the metric is generated by the flows of the Killing vector fields. The flows are given by the following transformations:\n\n1. $x \\rightarrow x + a$\n2. $y \\rightarrow y + b, z \\rightarrow z + b$\n3. $y \\rightarrow y + c, z \\rightarrow z - c$\n\nwhere $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. These transformations form a group under composition, which is isomorphic to the group $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, the isometry group of the metric is $\\mathbb{R}^3$."
