    "message_2": "To prove that any group of order p is cyclic, let G be a group of order p, where p is a prime number. We want to show that G is cyclic, which means there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nSince p is prime, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1 and p. The only subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, let g be any non-identity element of G. Since g is not the identity, the subgroup generated by g, denoted as <g>, must have order greater than 1. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of <g> must divide p, and since the only divisors of p are 1 and p, the order of <g> must be p.\n\nSince the order of <g> is p, it means that there are p distinct elements in <g>. But the order of G is also p, so <g> must contain all elements of G. Therefore, G is generated by the single element g, and G is cyclic.\n\nNow, suppose we have a group G of order 17. Since 17 is a prime number, by the proof above, G must be cyclic."
