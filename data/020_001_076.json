    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company has 8000 hours of labor available in a month and only has a maximum of 2500 pounds of raw material. Product A needs 10 labor hours and 5 pounds of raw material to be manufactured, while Product B needs 8 labor hours and 10 pounds of raw material. The profit for Product A is $500 and the profit for Product B is $700. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit the company can make in a month and how many units of each product should be produced?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and raw material can be represented by the following inequalities:\n\n10x + 8y ≤ 8000 (labor constraint)\n5x + 10y ≤ 2500 (raw material constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 500x + 700y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n10x + 8y = 8000 => y = (8000 - 10x) / 8\n5x + 10y = 2500 => y = (2500 - 5x) / 10\n\nThe intersection points of these lines are:\n\n1. (0, 0)\n2. (0, 250) - Intersection of y-axis and raw material constraint\n3. (800, 0) - Intersection of x-axis and labor constraint\n4. (400, 150) - Intersection of labor and raw material constraints\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these points:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 500(0) + 700(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 250) = 500(0) + 700(250) = $175,000\n3. P(800, 0) = 500(800) + 700(0) = $400,000\n4. P(400, 150) = 500(400) + 700(150) = $200,000 + $105,000 = $305,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $305,000, which occurs when the company produces 400 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B."
