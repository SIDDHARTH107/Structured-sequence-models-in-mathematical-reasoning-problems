    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\nS(u, v) = (u, v, 2uv + u^2 - v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\nS_u = (∂S/∂u) = (1, 0, 2v + 2u)\nS_v = (∂S/∂v) = (0, 1, 2u - 2v)\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\nI = [S_u • S_u, S_u • S_v]\n       [S_v • S_u, S_v • S_v]\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives:\nS_uu = (∂²S/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nS_uv = (∂²S/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 2)\nS_vv = (∂²S/∂v²) = (0, 0, -2)\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\nII = [-S_uu • N, -S_uv • N]\n         [-S_vu • N, -S_vv • N]\n\nTo find the normal vector N, we compute the cross product of S_u and S_v:\nN = S_u × S_v = (2u - 2v, -2u - 2v, 1)\n\nAt the point (-1, 1, 0), we have:\nS_u = (1, 0, 0)\nS_v = (0, 1, -2)\nN = (0, 2, 1)\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form at the point (-1, 1, 0):\nI = [1, 0]\n       [0, 5]\n\nNext, we compute the second fundamental form at the point (-1, 1, 0):\nII = [-2, -2]\n         [-2, 2]\n\nNow, we find the principal curvatures by solving the characteristic equation of the matrix product (I^(-1) * II):\ndet(I^(-1) * II - kI) = 0\n\nThe inverse of I is:\nI^(-1) = [1, 0]\n                [0, 1/5]\n\nThe product I^(-1) * II is:\nI^(-1) * II = [-2, -2/5]\n                          [-2, 2/5]\n\nNow, we find the eigenvalues of this matrix, which represent the principal curvatures:\ndet(I^(-1) * II - kI) = det([-2 - k, -2/5]\n                                            [-2, 2/5 - k]) = 0\n\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n(-2 - k)(2/5 - k) - (-2)(-2/5) = 0\nk^2 - 2k - 8/5 = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation, we find the principal curvatures k1 and k2:\nk1 = 1 - sqrt(33)/5\nk2 = 1 + sqrt(33)/5\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (-1, 1, 0) on the surface are k1 = 1 - sqrt(33)/5 and k2 = 1 + sqrt(33)/5."
