    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first get rid of the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by x:\n\nx * (5/x) + 2x = x * (8/x) - x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n5 + 2x = 8 - x\n\nNow, we will isolate x by adding x to both sides and subtracting 2x from both sides:\n\n5 + 3x = 8\n\nNext, subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n3x = 3\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 1"
