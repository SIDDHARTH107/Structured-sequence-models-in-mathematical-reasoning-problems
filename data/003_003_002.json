    "message_2": "In the unit circle, a 30-degree angle is equivalent to π/6 radians. The exact values of sine, cosine, and tangent for a 30-degree angle are as follows:\n\n1. Sine (sin 30° or sin(π/6)):\nsin(30°) = sin(π/6) = 1/2\n\n2. Cosine (cos 30° or cos(π/6)):\ncos(30°) = cos(π/6) = √3/2\n\n3. Tangent (tan 30° or tan(π/6)):\ntan(30°) = tan(π/6) = sin(π/6) / cos(π/6) = (1/2) / (√3/2) = 1/√3 = √3/3\n\nSo, the exact values are:\nsin(30°) = 1/2\ncos(30°) = √3/2\ntan(30°) = √3/3"
