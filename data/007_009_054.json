    "message_2": "To find the value of Euler's totient function, φ(n), for a given number n, we need to count the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. In other words, we need to find the number of integers k such that gcd(n, k) = 1, where gcd denotes the greatest common divisor.\n\nFor n = 21, we can factorize it as 21 = 3 × 7, where 3 and 7 are prime numbers. Using the formula for the Euler's totient function for a product of distinct prime factors:\n\nφ(n) = n × (1 - 1/p1) × (1 - 1/p2) × ... × (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\nφ(21) = 21 × (1 - 1/3) × (1 - 1/7) = 21 × (2/3) × (6/7) = 12.\n\nSo, the value of φ(21) is 12."
