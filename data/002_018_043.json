    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to find its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, its diameter is equal to the edge length of the cube. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half of the edge length of the cube:\n\nRadius = (Edge length of cube) / 2\nRadius = 4 cm / 2\nRadius = 2 cm\n\nNow we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * (radius^3)\nVolume = (4/3) * π * (2^3)\nVolume = (4/3) * π * 8\nVolume = 32/3 * π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π to get the volume to two decimal places:\n\nVolume ≈ 32/3 * 3.14\nVolume ≈ 33.493333...\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 33.49 cubic centimeters."
