    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the right-angled triangle as follows:\n\n- Hypotenuse (opposite the right angle): c = 13 cm\n- Side opposite the 30-degree angle: a\n- Side adjacent to the 30-degree angle: b\n\nWe can use the sine, cosine, and tangent functions to find the exact values of the sides a and b.\n\n1. Sine (sin) function:\nsin(30) = a/c\nsin(30) = a/13\n\nSince sin(30) = 1/2, we can write:\n1/2 = a/13\n\nSolving for a:\na = 13/2 = 6.5 cm\n\n2. Cosine (cos) function:\ncos(30) = b/c\ncos(30) = b/13\n\nSince cos(30) = √3/2, we can write:\n√3/2 = b/13\n\nSolving for b:\nb = 13√3/2 ≈ 11.258 cm\n\nNow that we have the side lengths a and b, we can find the exact values of sine, cosine, and tangent for the 30-degree angle.\n\nsin(30) = a/c = 6.5/13 = 1/2\ncos(30) = b/c = (13√3/2)/13 = √3/2\ntan(30) = a/b = (6.5)/(13√3/2) = 2/√3\n\nSo, the exact values of sine, cosine, and tangent for the 30-degree angle are:\n\nsin(30) = 1/2\ncos(30) = √3/2\ntan(30) = 2/√3"
