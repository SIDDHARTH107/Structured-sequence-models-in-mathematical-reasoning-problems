    "message_1": "Consider two firms in a Bertrand competition. The firms have identical and constant marginal costs of $5. The market demand curve is given by P = 30 â€“ Q, where P is the price and Q is the quantity. What will be the equilibrium price and quantity produced by each firm?",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition, firms compete by setting prices, and they produce the quantity demanded at the price they set. Since both firms have identical and constant marginal costs of $5, they will set their prices equal to their marginal costs in equilibrium. This is because if one firm sets a price above its marginal cost, the other firm can undercut it and capture the entire market. Therefore, the equilibrium price will be $5.\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium quantity by plugging the equilibrium price into the market demand curve:\n\nP = 30 - Q\n5 = 30 - Q\nQ = 30 - 5\nQ = 25\n\nSo, the total quantity demanded in the market is 25 units. Since both firms are identical and they share the market equally, each firm will produce half of the total quantity demanded:\n\nQuantity produced by each firm = Q / 2 = 25 / 2 = 12.5 units\n\nIn conclusion, the equilibrium price is $5, and each firm produces 12.5 units."
