    "message_2": "To find the volume of the metal rod using integration, we can consider the rod as a series of infinitesimally thin disks of thickness \"dx\" along the x-axis. The volume of each disk is the product of its cross-sectional area and its thickness. We can then integrate the volume of these disks along the length of the rod.\n\nThe cross-sectional area of the rod (A) is given by the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA = πr^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the rod (3 cm).\n\nSo, the volume of each infinitesimally thin disk is:\n\ndV = A * dx = πr^2 * dx\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression along the length of the rod (from x = 0 to x = 10 cm):\n\nV = ∫(πr^2 * dx) from 0 to 10\n\nSince π and r^2 are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nV = πr^2 * ∫(dx) from 0 to 10\n\nNow, we integrate:\n\nV = πr^2 * [x] from 0 to 10\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nV = πr^2 * (10 - 0)\n\nV = πr^2 * 10\n\nNow, substitute the value of r (3 cm) into the equation:\n\nV = π(3^2) * 10\n\nV = 9π * 10\n\nV = 90π cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the metal rod is 90π cubic centimeters."
