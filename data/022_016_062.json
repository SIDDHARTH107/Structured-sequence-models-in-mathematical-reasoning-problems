    "message_2": "To find a biholomorphic map from the region bounded by the circle $|z-2i|=2$ to the open unit disk $|w|<1$, we can use a composition of Möbius transformations. \n\nFirst, let's find a Möbius transformation that maps the circle $|z-2i|=2$ to the real axis. We can do this by mapping the center of the circle, $2i$, to the origin, and a point on the circle, say $z=0$, to a point on the real axis, say $w=1$. \n\nLet's consider the Möbius transformation of the form $w = \\frac{z-a}{z-b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are complex constants. We want to find $a$ and $b$ such that the transformation maps $2i$ to $0$ and $0$ to $1$. \n\nFor $z=2i$, we have $w=0$, so\n$$0 = \\frac{2i-a}{2i-b}.$$\nThis implies that $a=b$.\n\nFor $z=0$, we have $w=1$, so\n$$1 = \\frac{-a}{-b}.$$\nThis implies that $a=b$ as well.\n\nThus, we can choose $a=b=2i$, and our Möbius transformation becomes\n$$w = \\frac{z-2i}{z-2i} = 1.$$\n\nNow, we need to find a Möbius transformation that maps the real axis to the unit circle. We can use the transformation $w = \\frac{z-i}{z+i}$, which maps the real axis to the unit circle.\n\nFinally, we can compose the two transformations to obtain the biholomorphic map from the region bounded by the circle $|z-2i|=2$ to the open unit disk $|w|<1$. The composition is given by\n$$w = \\frac{\\frac{z-2i}{z-2i} - i}{\\frac{z-2i}{z-2i} + i} = \\frac{1-i}{1+i}.$$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get\n$$w = \\frac{(1-i)(1-i)}{(1+i)(1-i)} = \\frac{1-2i+i^2}{1+i^2} = \\frac{1-2i-1}{1+1} = \\frac{-2i}{2} = -i.$$\n\nSo, the biholomorphic map that takes the region bounded by the circle $|z-2i|=2$ to the open unit disk $|w|<1$ is given by\n$$w = -i.$$"
