    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 7. Since 7 is a prime number, we can apply the fact that every group of prime order is cyclic. To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be written as a power of g.\n\nLet's take an arbitrary non-identity element a in G. The order of a must be a divisor of the order of G, which is 7. Since 7 is prime, the only divisors of 7 are 1 and 7. The order of a cannot be 1, as the identity element is the only element with order 1, and we chose a to be a non-identity element. Therefore, the order of a must be 7.\n\nNow, consider the powers of a: a^1, a^2, ..., a^7. Since the order of a is 7, these powers are all distinct, and a^7 is the identity element. Thus, we have 7 distinct elements in the set {a^1, a^2, ..., a^7}, which are all the elements of G. This means that G is generated by the element a, and G is a cyclic group.\n\nTo find the generator of G, we have already shown that the element a generates G. Therefore, the generator of the group G is the element a."
