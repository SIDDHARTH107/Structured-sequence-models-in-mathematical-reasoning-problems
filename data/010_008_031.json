    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a simplicial complex is given by the formula:\n\nEuler characteristic (χ) = number of vertices (V) - number of edges (E) + number of faces (F)\n\nIn this case, we have 7 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 faces. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nχ = 7 - 12 + 6\n\nχ = -5 + 6\n\nχ = 1\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of this simplicial complex is 1."
