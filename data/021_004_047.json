    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nThe velocity function of a particle moving along a straight line is given by $v(t) = 2t^2 - 6t + 5,$ where $t$ is time in seconds. \n\nUsing a forward difference with a step size of $0.5$ seconds, find the approximate acceleration of the particle at $t = 2.5$ seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the approximate acceleration using a forward difference with a step size of 0.5 seconds, we need to calculate the difference in velocity over the time interval and divide it by the step size. The acceleration function is the derivative of the velocity function, so we can approximate it as follows:\n\n$a(t) \\approx \\frac{v(t + \\Delta t) - v(t)}{\\Delta t}$\n\nwhere $a(t)$ is the acceleration, $v(t)$ is the velocity function, and $\\Delta t$ is the step size (0.5 seconds in this case).\n\nFirst, let's find the velocity at $t = 2.5$ seconds:\n\n$v(2.5) = 2(2.5)^2 - 6(2.5) + 5 = 2(6.25) - 15 + 5 = 12.5 - 15 + 5 = 2.5$\n\nNext, let's find the velocity at $t = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3$ seconds:\n\n$v(3) = 2(3)^2 - 6(3) + 5 = 2(9) - 18 + 5 = 18 - 18 + 5 = 5$\n\nNow, we can approximate the acceleration at $t = 2.5$ seconds using the forward difference formula:\n\n$a(2.5) \\approx \\frac{v(3) - v(2.5)}{0.5} = \\frac{5 - 2.5}{0.5} = \\frac{2.5}{0.5} = 5$\n\nSo, the approximate acceleration of the particle at $t = 2.5$ seconds is 5 m/sÂ²."
