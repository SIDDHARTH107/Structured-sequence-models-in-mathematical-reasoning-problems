    "message_2": "Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a group G of order 18 that is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a non-abelian group of order 6. Let's denote these groups as C_3 and H, respectively. Then, we have:\n\nG ≅ C_3 × H\n\nSince C_3 is a cyclic group of order 3, it has an element a of order 3, i.e., a^3 = e, where e is the identity element of G. Similarly, since H is a group of order 6, it has an element b of order 6, i.e., b^6 = e.\n\nNow, let's consider the element (a, b) ∈ G. Since G is the direct product of C_3 and H, the order of (a, b) is the least common multiple of the orders of a and b, which is lcm(3, 6) = 6. Therefore, (a, b)^6 = e.\n\nHowever, since H is non-abelian, there exists an element c ∈ H such that bc ≠ cb. Let's consider the element (e, c) ∈ G. Since (a, b) and (e, c) are elements of G, their product is also an element of G:\n\n((a, b)(e, c))^6 = (a, b)^6(e, c)^6 = e\n\nHowever, since bc ≠ cb, we have:\n\n(a, b)(e, c) = (a, bc) ≠ (a, cb) = (a, b)(c, e)\n\nThis means that G has two distinct elements of order 6, which contradicts the fact that G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a non-abelian group of order 6, as the latter has only one element of order 6.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that there exists a group G of order 18 that is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a non-abelian group of order 6 must be false."
