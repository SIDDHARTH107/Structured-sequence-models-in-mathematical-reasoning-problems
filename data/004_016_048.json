    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, we can consider the function f(t) to represent the position of the car at time t, where t is measured in hours and f(t) is measured in kilometers. The car travels from point A to point B, a distance of 100 km, in 2 hours. Therefore, we have:\n\nf(0) = 0 (the starting position)\nf(2) = 100 (the ending position)\n\nThe average rate of change of the function over the interval [0, 2] is given by:\n\n(f(2) - f(0)) / (2 - 0) = (100 - 0) / 2 = 50 km/h\n\nBy the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 2) such that the derivative of the function at c, which represents the instantaneous speed of the car at time c, is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [0, 2].\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the car during this journey is 50 km/h."
