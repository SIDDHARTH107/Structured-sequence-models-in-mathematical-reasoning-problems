    "message_1": "Consider a common value auction with 4 bidders. The true value of the item is $100. Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 have a private value of $80 and Bidder 3 and Bidder 4 have a private value of $120. The auction is second-price sealed-bid. Assuming all bidders bid truthfully, what is the expected payment that the winning bidder will make in this auction?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, also known as a Vickrey auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid. Since all bidders are assumed to bid truthfully, we can determine the winning bidder and the expected payment.\n\nBidder 1: $80\nBidder 2: $80\nBidder 3: $120\nBidder 4: $120\n\nIn this case, either Bidder 3 or Bidder 4 will win the auction, as they both have the highest bids of $120. However, they will pay the second-highest bid, which is $80.\n\nTherefore, the expected payment that the winning bidder will make in this auction is $80."
