    "message_2": "First, we need to compute the modulus n and the totient function φ(n):\n\nn = p * q = 13 * 17 = 221\n\nφ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = 12 * 16 = 192\n\nNow, we need to represent the message \"hello\" as an integer. One common way to do this is to use the ASCII values of the characters:\n\n\"hello\" = [104, 101, 108, 108, 111]\n\nHowever, since n = 221, we need to represent the message as an integer smaller than 221. We can concatenate the ASCII values to form a single integer:\n\n104101108108111\n\nThis number is too large, so we can try another method, such as taking the sum of the ASCII values:\n\n104 + 101 + 108 + 108 + 111 = 532\n\nSince 532 is still larger than 221, we can take the sum modulo n:\n\n532 mod 221 = 90\n\nNow we have the message represented as an integer m = 90.\n\nTo sign the message, we compute the signature s using the private exponent d:\n\ns = m^d mod n = 90^53 mod 221 = 58\n\nSo, the digital signature for the message \"hello\" is 58."
