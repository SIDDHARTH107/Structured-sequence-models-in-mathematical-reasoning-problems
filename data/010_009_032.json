    "message_1": "Consider a square ABCD with sides of length 6 units. This square can be divided into four congruent squares as shown below. If we continue this process of dividing each square into four equal squares and then shading the first obtained square red, what will be the total area of red squares for the fourth subdivision?\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/8WnSnoS.png) \n\n(Note: The red square in the image indicates the one that will be shaded in each subdivision.)",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the pattern of the red squares in each subdivision.\n\n1. In the first subdivision, we have 1 red square with an area of 9 square units (3x3).\n2. In the second subdivision, we have 4 red squares, each with an area of 2.25 square units (1.5x1.5). The total area of red squares in this subdivision is 9 square units.\n3. In the third subdivision, we have 16 red squares, each with an area of 0.5625 square units (0.75x0.75). The total area of red squares in this subdivision is 9 square units.\n\nNotice that the total area of red squares remains constant at 9 square units in each subdivision.\n\n4. In the fourth subdivision, we can expect the same pattern to continue. The total area of red squares will still be 9 square units."
