    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set ∅ is a subset of any set A, we need to show that every element of the empty set is also an element of A. \n\nRecall the definition of a subset: A set B is a subset of a set A (denoted as B ⊆ A) if every element of B is also an element of A. \n\nThe empty set ∅ has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in A, regardless of what set A is. Since there are no elements in the empty set that are not in A, it is true that every element of the empty set is also an element of A.\n\nThus, the empty set ∅ is a subset of any set A (i.e., ∅ ⊆ A)."
