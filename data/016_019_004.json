    "message_2": "The Koch island fractal is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the number of segments in the curve increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is reduced to 1/3 of the previous length.\n\nLet's denote the initial side length of the equilateral triangle as L0, which is 10 cm in this case. After the first iteration, the length of each side of the triangle becomes L1 = (4/3)L0. After the second iteration, the length of each side becomes L2 = (4/3)L1 = (4/3)^2L0. Similarly, after the third iteration, the length of each side becomes L3 = (4/3)^3L0, and after the fourth iteration, the length of each side becomes L4 = (4/3)^4L0.\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter of the Koch island fractal after four iterations. Since the Koch island fractal is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle, the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the three sides after four iterations:\n\nPerimeter = 3 * L4 = 3 * (4/3)^4 * L0\n\nPlugging in the given value of L0 = 10 cm:\n\nPerimeter = 3 * (4/3)^4 * 10 ≈ 3 * 3.16049 * 10 ≈ 94.8147 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch island fractal after four iterations is approximately 94.81 cm."
