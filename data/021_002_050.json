Choose an initial guess x0.\n2. Iterate x(k+1) = A * x(k) until convergence.\n3. Normalize x(k+1) at each step.\n4. The dominant eigenvalue is approximated by the Rayleigh quotient: λ = (x^T * A * x) / (x^T * x).\n\nGiven matrix A and initial guess x0:\n\nA = [ 2  1 \n      1  3 ]\n\nx0 = [ 1 \n       1 ]\n\nLet's perform the power iteration method:\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = A * x0 = [ 2*1 + 1*1\n                1*1 + 3*1 ] = [ 3\n                                4 ]\nNormalize x1:\nx1_norm = x1 / ||x1|| = [ 3/sqrt(3^2 + 4^2)\n                          4/sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) ] = [ 3/5\n                                                  4/5 ]\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = A * x1_norm = [ 2*(3/5) + 1*(4/5)\n                     1*(3/5) + 3*(4/5) ] = [ 14/5\n                                             18/5 ]\nNormalize x2:\nx2_norm = x2 / ||x2|| = [ (14/5)/sqrt((14/5)^2 + (18/5)^2)\n                          (18/5)/sqrt((14/5)^2 + (18/5)^2) ] = [ 14/22\n                                                                18/22 ]\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = A * x2_norm = [ 2*(14/22) + 1*(18/22)\n                     1*(14/22) + 3*(18/22) ] = [ 50/22\n                                                 68/22 ]\nNormalize x3:\nx3_norm = x3 / ||x3|| = [ (50/22)/sqrt((50/22)^2 + (68/22)^2)\n                          (68/22)/sqrt((50/22)^2 + (68/22)^2) ] = [ 50/86\n                                                                    68/86 ]\n\nNow, let's check the stopping criteria:\n\n||x3_norm - x2_norm|| = || [ 50/86 - 14/22\n                              68/86 - 18/22 ] || = || [ 4/86\n                                                        4/86 ] || = 4*sqrt(2)/86\n\nSince 4*sqrt(2)/86 < 0.001, we can stop the iteration.\n\nNow, let's find the dominant eigenvalue using the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nλ = (x3_norm^T * A * x3_norm) / (x3_norm^T * x3_norm)\n\nλ = [ (50/86) (68/86) ] * [ 2  1\n                             1  3 ] * [ 50/86\n                                        68/86 ] / [ (50/86)^2 + (68/86)^2 ]\n\nλ ≈ 3.618\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue is approximately 3.618, and the corresponding eigenvector is approximately:\n\nx3_norm = [ 50/86\n            68/86 ]"
