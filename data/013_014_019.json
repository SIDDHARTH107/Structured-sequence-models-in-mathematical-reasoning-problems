    "message_1": "Consider an auction where a seller wants to sell a painting to one of three bidders. The three bidders' valuations of the painting are $V_1 = 50$, $V_2 = 80$, and $V_3 = 100$. If the seller uses a second-price sealed-bid auction (also known as a Vickrey auction), how much should each bidder bid in order to maximize their chances of winning the auction while minimizing the amount they pay?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction (Vickrey auction), the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid. Bidders should bid their true valuation to maximize their chances of winning the auction while minimizing the amount they pay.\n\nHere's why: If a bidder bids below their true valuation, they risk losing the auction to someone who bids closer to their true valuation. If they bid above their true valuation, they risk overpaying for the painting if they win.\n\nSo, in this case, each bidder should bid their true valuation:\n\nBidder 1 should bid $50.\nBidder 2 should bid $80.\nBidder 3 should bid $100.\n\nWith these bids, Bidder 3 would win the auction and pay the second-highest bid, which is $80."
