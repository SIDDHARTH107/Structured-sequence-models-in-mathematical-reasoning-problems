    "message_1": "A school wants to create a schedule for its 10 teachers so that each teacher teaches exactly 4 classes per day. If the school has a total of 30 classes per day and each class must be taught by exactly one teacher, how many different schedules can the school create?",
    "message_2": "Let's use combinatorics to solve this problem. We need to distribute 30 classes among 10 teachers such that each teacher gets exactly 4 classes.\n\nFirst, we can calculate the total number of ways to distribute the 30 classes among the 10 teachers without any restrictions. This can be done using the stars and bars method. We have 30 classes (stars) and we need to divide them into 10 groups (teachers). To do this, we need 9 dividers (bars). So, we have a total of 30 + 9 = 39 objects.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these 39 objects is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(39, 9) = 39! / (9! * (39 - 9)!)\n\nNow, we need to subtract the cases where some teachers have more than 4 classes. Let's assume that one teacher has 5 classes. Then, we have 29 classes left to distribute among the remaining 9 teachers. Using the stars and bars method again, we have:\n\nC(37, 9) = 37! / (9! * (37 - 9)!)\n\nHowever, this case can occur for any of the 10 teachers. So, we have 10 * C(37, 9) cases where one teacher has 5 classes.\n\nNext, we need to consider the case where two teachers have 5 classes each. In this case, we have 28 classes left to distribute among the remaining 8 teachers. Using the stars and bars method, we have:\n\nC(35, 9) = 35! / (9! * (35 - 9)!)\n\nHowever, this case can occur for any pair of the 10 teachers. So, we have C(10, 2) * C(35, 9) cases where two teachers have 5 classes each.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the cases where some teachers have more than 4 classes from the total number of ways to distribute the 30 classes among the 10 teachers without any restrictions:\n\nTotal schedules = C(39, 9) - 10 * C(37, 9) + C(10, 2) * C(35, 9)\n\nTotal schedules = (39! / (9! * 30!)) - 10 * (37! / (9! * 28!)) + (10! / (2! * 8!)) * (35! / (9! * 26!))\n\nTotal schedules = 92,378,518,400\n\nSo, there are 92,378,518,400 different schedules that the school can create."
