    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, let's write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n[ 1 -2  1 | 0 ]\n[ 2 -4  2 | 0 ]\n[ 3 -6  3 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form. We can start by subtracting 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1 -2  1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  0 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  0 | 0 ]\n```\n\nSince the second and third rows are all zeros, we can see that the system has infinitely many solutions. To find the general solution, we can express the variables in terms of a free variable. In this case, let's choose z as the free variable. From the first row, we have:\n\nx - 2y + z = 0\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\nx = 2y - z\n\nNow, let z = t, where t is a real number. Then, we have:\n\nx = 2y - t\n\nSince y can also be any real number, we can write the general solution as:\n\nx = 2y - t\ny = y\nz = t\n\nThis represents infinitely many solutions, as y and t can be any real numbers."
