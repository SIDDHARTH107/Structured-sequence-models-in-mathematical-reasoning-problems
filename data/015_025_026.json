    "message_1": "What is the period of the forced van der Pol oscillator when the damping parameter is $\\mu = 0.5$, the amplitude of the external force is $F=1.5$, and the frequency of the external force is $\\omega=1.2$?",
    "message_2": "The period of a forced van der Pol oscillator can be determined by the frequency of the external force. The period (T) is the reciprocal of the frequency (ω). In this case, the frequency of the external force is given as ω = 1.2. \n\nTo find the period, we can use the formula:\n\nT = 1/ω\n\nSubstituting the given value of ω:\n\nT = 1/1.2\n\nT ≈ 0.8333\n\nSo, the period of the forced van der Pol oscillator is approximately 0.8333 units of time."
