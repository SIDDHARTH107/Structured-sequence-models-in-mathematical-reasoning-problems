    "message_1": "Consider a signaling game where the sender has two types, T1 and T2, each type occurs with probability 1/2. The receiver can take one of two actions, A1 and A2. If the sender is of type T1 and chooses to send signal s1, the probability of the receiver choosing action A1 is 2/3, however, if the sender is of type T2 and sends signal s1, the probability of the receiver choosing action A1 falls to 1/3. If the sender chooses to send signal s2, the probability of the receiver choosing action A1 is 1/3, regardless of the sender's type. What is the expected utility of the sender when he sends s1?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected utility of the sender when he sends signal s1, we need to consider the utilities for both types of senders (T1 and T2) and the probabilities of the receiver choosing action A1 or A2.\n\nLet U1_A1 and U1_A2 be the utilities for the sender of type T1 when the receiver chooses actions A1 and A2, respectively. Similarly, let U2_A1 and U2_A2 be the utilities for the sender of type T2 when the receiver chooses actions A1 and A2, respectively.\n\nThe expected utility of the sender when he sends s1 can be calculated as follows:\n\nExpected Utility = (Probability of T1) * [(Probability of A1 given T1 and s1) * U1_A1 + (Probability of A2 given T1 and s1) * U1_A2] + (Probability of T2) * [(Probability of A1 given T2 and s1) * U2_A1 + (Probability of A2 given T2 and s1) * U2_A2]\n\nSince the probabilities of T1 and T2 are both 1/2, and the probabilities of A1 given T1 and s1 is 2/3, A1 given T2 and s1 is 1/3, we can plug in these values:\n\nExpected Utility = (1/2) * [(2/3) * U1_A1 + (1/3) * U1_A2] + (1/2) * [(1/3) * U2_A1 + (2/3) * U2_A2]\n\nTo find the exact expected utility, we would need the specific utility values for U1_A1, U1_A2, U2_A1, and U2_A2."
