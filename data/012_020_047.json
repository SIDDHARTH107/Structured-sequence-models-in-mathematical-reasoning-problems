    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of the vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.\n\nLet's label the vertices of the given graph as follows:\n\n```\n  1---2\n  |\\  |\n  | \\ |\n  |  \\|\n  4---3\n```\n\nWe can see that there are 4 non-trivial automorphisms in addition to the identity automorphism:\n\n1. Identity automorphism (no change): (1)(2)(3)(4)\n2. Swap vertices 1 and 3, and 2 and 4: (1 3)(2 4)\n3. Swap vertices 1 and 2, and 3 and 4: (1 2)(3 4)\n4. Swap vertices 1 and 4, and 2 and 3: (1 4)(2 3)\n5. Rotate the graph 180 degrees: (1 3 4 2)\n\nThe automorphism group of this graph is the set of these 5 automorphisms, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 4, D4."
