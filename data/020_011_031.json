    "message_1": "A student wants to optimize their grades in three subjects: Math, Science, and English. Their current scores are Math (80), Science (85), and English (90). They want to improve their overall score by increasing their scores in two of the subjects while keeping the third subject's score the same. \nWhat is the highest overall score the student can achieve, and what should be their scores in the two improved subjects?",
    "message_2": "To achieve the highest overall score, the student should focus on improving the two subjects with the lowest scores, which are Math (80) and Science (85). Assuming the maximum score for each subject is 100, the student can improve their Math score to 100 and their Science score to 100.\n\nIn this case, the student's new scores would be:\nMath: 100\nScience: 100\nEnglish: 90\n\nThe highest overall score the student can achieve is the sum of these new scores, which is 100 + 100 + 90 = 290."
