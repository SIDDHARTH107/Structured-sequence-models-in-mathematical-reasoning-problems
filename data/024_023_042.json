    "message_2": "The given equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 represents a 3-dimensional sphere centered at the origin with a radius of 1. To determine the symmetries of the manifold M, we need to find the transformations that preserve the shape and structure of the sphere.\n\nThere are several types of symmetries for the sphere:\n\n1. Reflections: Reflecting the sphere across any plane passing through the origin will preserve its shape and structure. For example, reflecting across the xy-plane (z = 0) will map the point (x, y, z) to (x, y, -z), and the equation of the sphere remains unchanged.\n\n2. Rotations: Rotating the sphere around any axis passing through the origin will also preserve its shape and structure. For example, rotating around the z-axis by an angle θ will map the point (x, y, z) to (x*cos(θ) - y*sin(θ), x*sin(θ) + y*cos(θ), z), and the equation of the sphere remains unchanged.\n\n3. Inversions: Inverting the sphere through the origin, i.e., mapping the point (x, y, z) to (-x, -y, -z), will also preserve its shape and structure, as the equation of the sphere remains unchanged.\n\n4. Identity: The identity transformation, which maps each point to itself, is also a symmetry of the sphere.\n\nThese symmetries form a group called the orthogonal group O(3), which consists of all 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant ±1. The subgroup of O(3) consisting of matrices with determinant 1 corresponds to the rotations, and is called the special orthogonal group SO(3). The symmetries of the 3-dimensional sphere M are described by the orthogonal group O(3)."
