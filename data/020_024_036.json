    "message_1": "A company produces and sells a product at a cost of $10 per unit. The demand function for the product is given by p = 100 - 2q, where p is the price and q is the quantity demanded. Determine the optimal price that the company should charge to maximize its revenue.",
    "message_2": "To maximize revenue, we need to find the price (p) that maximizes the product of price and quantity demanded (pq). \n\nThe demand function is given by p = 100 - 2q. We can rewrite this equation in terms of q: q = (100 - p)/2.\n\nNow, let's find the revenue function R(p) = pq. Substitute the expression for q into the revenue function:\n\nR(p) = p((100 - p)/2)\n\nR(p) = (100p - p^2)/2\n\nTo find the maximum revenue, we need to find the critical points of the revenue function by taking the derivative with respect to p and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndR(p)/dp = (100 - 2p)/2\n\nSet the derivative equal to 0 and solve for p:\n\n0 = (100 - 2p)/2\n\n0 = 100 - 2p\n\n2p = 100\n\np = 50\n\nThe optimal price to maximize revenue is $50 per unit."
