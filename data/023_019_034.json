    "message_1": "Suppose a system is described by the differential equation $y'' + 2y' + 2y = 2\\sin(t)$, where $y(0) = 1$ and $y'(0) = 0$. Use Fourier analysis to determine if the system is stable.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the system is stable using Fourier analysis, we first need to find the transfer function of the system. The transfer function is the ratio of the Laplace transform of the output to the Laplace transform of the input.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n\n$y'' + 2y' + 2y = 2\\sin(t)$\n\nTaking the Laplace transform of both sides, we get:\n\n$s^2Y(s) + 2sY(s) + 2Y(s) = 2\\frac{1}{s^2 + 1}$\n\nNow, we can factor out $Y(s)$:\n\n$Y(s)(s^2 + 2s + 2) = 2\\frac{1}{s^2 + 1}$\n\nThe transfer function $H(s)$ is the ratio of the Laplace transform of the output $Y(s)$ to the Laplace transform of the input $X(s) = 2\\frac{1}{s^2 + 1}$:\n\n$H(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)} = \\frac{2\\frac{1}{s^2 + 1}}{s^2 + 2s + 2}$\n\nSimplifying the transfer function, we get:\n\n$H(s) = \\frac{2}{(s^2 + 1)(s^2 + 2s + 2)}$\n\nNow, we need to determine if the system is stable. A system is stable if all the poles of its transfer function have negative real parts. The poles are the values of $s$ that make the denominator of the transfer function equal to zero.\n\nThe denominator of the transfer function is:\n\n$(s^2 + 1)(s^2 + 2s + 2)$\n\nWe need to find the roots of this expression. The first term, $s^2 + 1$, has roots at $s = \\pm i$. These roots have a real part of zero, so they do not affect the stability of the system.\n\nThe second term, $s^2 + 2s + 2$, is a quadratic equation. We can find its roots using the quadratic formula:\n\n$s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = 2$, and $c = 2$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$s = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(2)}}{2(1)}$\n\n$s = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}}{2}$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex conjugates with negative real parts:\n\n$s = -1 \\pm i\\sqrt{1}$\n\nBoth roots have a negative real part, so the system is stable."
