    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing each column with the constants (Dx, Dy, Dz).\n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n| 2 -3  4 |\n| 3  2 -1 |\n| 1 -1  1 |\n\nTo find the determinant D:\nD = 2((2 * 1) - (-1 * -1)) - (-3)((3 * 1) - (-1 * 1)) + 4((3 * -1) - (2 * 1))\nD = 2(2 - 1) - (-3)(3 - 1) + 4(-3 - 2)\nD = 2(1) + 3(2) - 4(5)\nD = 2 + 6 - 20\nD = -12\n\nNow, we'll find Dx by replacing the first column with the constants:\n| 7 -3  4 |\n| 1  2 -1 |\n| 2 -1  1 |\n\nDx = 7((2 * 1) - (-1 * -1)) - (-3)((1 * 1) - (-1 * 2)) + 4((1 * -1) - (2 * 1))\nDx = 7(2 - 1) + 3(1 - 2) + 4(-1 - 2)\nDx = 7(1) - 3(1) - 4(3)\nDx = 7 - 3 - 12\nDx = -8\n\nNow, we'll find Dy by replacing the second column with the constants:\n| 2  7  4 |\n| 3  1 -1 |\n| 1  2  1 |\n\nDy = 2((1 * 1) - (-1 * 2)) - 7((3 * 1) - (-1 * 1)) + 4((3 * 2) - (1 * 1))\nDy = 2(1 + 2) - 7(3 + 1) + 4(6 - 1)\nDy = 2(3) - 7(4) + 4(5)\nDy = 6 - 28 + 20\nDy = -2\n\nNow, we'll find Dz by replacing the third column with the constants:\n| 2 -3  7 |\n| 3  2  1 |\n| 1 -1  2 |\n\nDz = 2((2 * 2) - (1 * -1)) - (-3)((3 * 2) - (1 * 1)) + 7((3 * -1) - (2 * 1))\nDz = 2(4 + 1) + 3(6 - 1) + 7(-3 - 2)\nDz = 2(5) + 3(5) - 7(5)\nDz = 10 + 15 - 35\nDz = -10\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z:\nx = Dx / D = -8 / -12 = 2/3\ny = Dy / D = -2 / -12 = 1/6\nz = Dz / D = -10 / -12 = 5/6\n\nSo, the solution is x = 2/3, y = 1/6, and z = 5/6."
