    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I would like to clarify that linear logic is a substructural logic that replaces the usual notion of logical conjunction with a weaker, resource-sensitive version. The symbols used in the formula you provided (⊗, ⊸, and ⊕) are not standard arithmetic operations, but rather linear logic connectives.\n\nThe linear logic rule of exchange states that the order of the resources does not matter. In this case, the formula A ⊗ B ⊸ C ⊕ D can be rearranged in any order without changing its meaning. However, since A, B, C, and D are given numerical values, it seems that you might be looking for a solution using arithmetic operations.\n\nIf you could provide the correct arithmetic operations to be used in place of the linear logic connectives, I would be happy to help you solve the problem."
