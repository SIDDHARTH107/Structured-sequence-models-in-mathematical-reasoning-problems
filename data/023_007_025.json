    "message_1": "Suppose you are given a signal in the time domain that represents the voltage of an electrical circuit over time. The voltage signal is periodic with a period of 1 second and can be modeled as follows:\n\nv(t) = 2cos(2πt) + 3sin(4πt) - cos(6πt) - 2sin(8πt)\n\nUsing the Fourier transform, determine the frequency content of the signal in Hertz (Hz) and provide the amplitudes and phases of each of the frequencies present in the signal.",
    "message_2": "The given signal is already in the form of a sum of sinusoids, so we can directly identify the frequency content, amplitudes, and phases without needing to perform the Fourier transform. The general form of a sinusoid is A*cos(2πft + φ), where A is the amplitude, f is the frequency in Hz, and φ is the phase.\n\nThe signal can be rewritten as:\n\nv(t) = 2cos(2π(1)t + 0) + 3sin(2π(2)t + π/2) - cos(2π(3)t + 0) - 2sin(2π(4)t + π/2)\n\nNow we can identify the frequency content, amplitudes, and phases for each sinusoid:\n\n1. Frequency: 1 Hz, Amplitude: 2, Phase: 0\n2. Frequency: 2 Hz, Amplitude: 3, Phase: π/2\n3. Frequency: 3 Hz, Amplitude: 1, Phase: 0\n4. Frequency: 4 Hz, Amplitude: 2, Phase: π/2\n\nSo, the signal contains four frequencies: 1 Hz, 2 Hz, 3 Hz, and 4 Hz with corresponding amplitudes of 2, 3, 1, and 2, and phases of 0, π/2, 0, and π/2, respectively."
