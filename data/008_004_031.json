    "message_2": "To solve this homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix of the system:\n\n```\n[  2  -3   4 |  0 ]\n[  5   6  -7 |  0 ]\n[ -1   2  -1 |  0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 3:\n```\n[ -1   2  -1 |  0 ]\n[  5   6  -7 |  0 ]\n[  2  -3   4 |  0 ]\n```\n\n2. Add 5 times Row 1 to Row 2:\n```\n[ -1   2  -1 |  0 ]\n[  0  16 -12 |  0 ]\n[  2  -3   4 |  0 ]\n```\n\n3. Add 2 times Row 1 to Row 3:\n```\n[ -1   2  -1 |  0 ]\n[  0  16 -12 |  0 ]\n[  0   1   2 |  0 ]\n```\n\n4. Divide Row 2 by 16:\n```\n[ -1   2  -1 |  0 ]\n[  0   1 -3/4 |  0 ]\n[  0   1   2  |  0 ]\n```\n\n5. Subtract Row 2 from Row 3:\n```\n[ -1   2  -1 |  0 ]\n[  0   1 -3/4 |  0 ]\n[  0   0 11/4 |  0 ]\n```\n\n6. Divide Row 3 by 11/4:\n```\n[ -1   2  -1 |  0 ]\n[  0   1 -3/4 |  0 ]\n[  0   0   1  |  0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we can write the system of linear equations corresponding to the row-echelon form:\n\n```\n-x + 2y - z = 0\n y - 3/4z = 0\n       z = 0\n```\n\nFrom the last equation, we have z = 0. Substituting this into the second equation, we get y = 0. Finally, substituting y = 0 and z = 0 into the first equation, we get x = 0.\n\nSo, the solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
