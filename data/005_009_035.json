    "message_2": "To find the median using the non-parametric method, we first need to sort the data in ascending order:\n\n{1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9}\n\nSince there are 20 data points (an even number), the median will be the average of the 10th and 11th values in the sorted data set.\n\nThe 10th value is 4, and the 11th value is 5. The average of these two values is:\n\n(4 + 5) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5\n\nSo, the median of this data set is 4.5 hours."
