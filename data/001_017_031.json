    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x-3) + log(x+1) = log(20), we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property that states that log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b). Applying this property to the given equation, we get:\n\nlog((x-3)(x+1)) = log(20)\n\nSince the logarithms on both sides of the equation have the same base, we can set the arguments equal to each other:\n\n(x-3)(x+1) = 20\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get:\n\nx^2 - 3x + x - 3 = 20\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 3 = 20\n\nSubtracting 20 from both sides, we get:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 23 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 2x - 23 = 0. We can do this by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. In this case, the equation does not factor easily, so we will use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -23. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(-23))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (2 ± √(4 + 92)) / 2\n\nx = (2 ± √96) / 2\n\nx = (2 ± 4√6) / 2\n\nx = 1 ± 2√6\n\nSo, the two possible solutions for x are:\n\nx = 1 + 2√6 and x = 1 - 2√6\n\nHowever, we need to check if these solutions are valid, since logarithms are only defined for positive arguments. Plugging the first solution into the original equation, we get:\n\nlog((1 + 2√6) - 3) + log((1 + 2√6) + 1) = log(20)\n\nlog(2√6 - 2) + log(2√6 + 2) = log(20)\n\nSince both arguments are positive, this solution is valid.\n\nNow, plugging the second solution into the original equation, we get:\n\nlog((1 - 2√6) - 3) + log((1 - 2√6) + 1) = log(20)\n\nlog(-2√6 - 2) + log(-2√6 + 2) = log(20)\n\nSince both arguments are negative, this solution is not valid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution for x is:\n\nx = 1 + 2√6"
