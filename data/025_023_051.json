    "message_2": "To compute the degree of the intersection of the variety with the hyperplane given by $z = 0$, we first substitute $z = 0$ into the equations:\n\n$$x^2 + y^2 = 1$$\n$$x^3 + y^3 = 1$$\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection points of these two equations. We can rewrite the first equation as:\n\n$$y^2 = 1 - x^2$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$$y = \\pm\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $y$ into the second equation:\n\n$$x^3 + (\\pm\\sqrt{1 - x^2})^3 = 1$$\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\n$$x^3 + (1 - x^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 1$$\n\nSubtracting $x^3$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$$(1 - x^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 1 - x^3$$\n\nThis equation represents the intersection points of the two equations in the $x$-$y$ plane. To find the degree of the intersection, we need to find the number of distinct solutions for $x$. \n\nNotice that the left-hand side of the equation is non-negative, and the right-hand side is non-negative for $x \\in [0, 1]$. Therefore, we can restrict our search for solutions to the interval $x \\in [0, 1]$. \n\nThe equation is continuous and differentiable on this interval, so we can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem. The function $(1 - x^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ is decreasing on the interval $x \\in [0, 1]$, and the function $1 - x^3$ is also decreasing on this interval. \n\nAt $x = 0$, we have $(1 - x^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 1$ and $1 - x^3 = 1$, so there is one intersection point at $x = 0$. \n\nAt $x = 1$, we have $(1 - x^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 0$ and $1 - x^3 = 0$, so there is another intersection point at $x = 1$. \n\nSince both functions are decreasing on the interval $x \\in [0, 1]$, there are no other intersection points. Therefore, the degree of the intersection of the variety with the hyperplane given by $z = 0$ is 2."
