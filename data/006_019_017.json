    "message_1": "Suppose there are 4 political parties contesting in a national election in a country. The probability of party A winning the election is 0.4, the probability of party B winning is 0.25, the probability of party C winning is 0.2, and the probability of party D winning is 0.15. \n\nWhat is the probability that a party other than party A will win the election in the country?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a party other than party A will win the election, we can simply subtract the probability of party A winning from the total probability, which is 1.\n\nProbability (not party A) = 1 - Probability (party A)\n\nProbability (not party A) = 1 - 0.4\n\nProbability (not party A) = 0.6\n\nSo, the probability that a party other than party A will win the election is 0.6 or 60%."
