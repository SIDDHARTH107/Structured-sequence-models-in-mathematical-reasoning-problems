    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since f(x) is an even function, all the b_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the a_n coefficients.\n\nThe formula for the Fourier coefficients of an even function is given by:\n\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L)] dx from -L to L\n\nIn this case, L = π, so:\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[x^2 * cos(nπx/π)] dx from -π to π\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[x^2 * cos(nx)] dx from -π to π\n\nTo find the integral, we can use integration by parts twice:\n\nLet u = x^2, dv = cos(nx) dx\nThen, du = 2x dx, v = (1/n) * sin(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\n∫[x^2 * cos(nx)] dx = (x^2 * (1/n) * sin(nx)) - ∫[(1/n) * sin(nx) * 2x] dx\n\nNow, let u = 2x, dv = (1/n) * sin(nx) dx\nThen, du = 2 dx, v = (-1/n^2) * cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts again:\n\n∫[(1/n) * sin(nx) * 2x] dx = (2x * (-1/n^2) * cos(nx)) - ∫[(-1/n^2) * cos(nx) * 2] dx\n\n∫[(1/n) * sin(nx) * 2x] dx = (-2x/n^2) * cos(nx) + (2/n^2) * ∫[cos(nx)] dx\n\n∫[(1/n) * sin(nx) * 2x] dx = (-2x/n^2) * cos(nx) + (2/n^3) * sin(nx)\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into our original integration by parts formula:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(x^2 * (1/n) * sin(nx)) - ((-2x/n^2) * cos(nx) + (2/n^3) * sin(nx))] evaluated from -π to π\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(π^2/n) * sin(nπ) - (-2π/n^2) * cos(nπ) + (2/n^3) * sin(nπ) - ((-π^2/n) * sin(-nπ) - (2π/n^2) * cos(-nπ) + (2/n^3) * sin(-nπ))]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 and cos(nπ) = (-1)^n for all integer values of n, we get:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(-1)^n * (-2π/n^2) - (-1)^n * (2π/n^2)]\n\na_n = (4π/n^2) * (-1)^n\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = x^2:\n\nf(x) = (a_0/2) + Σ[a_n * cos(nx)] from n=1 to infinity\n\nf(x) = (π^2/3) + Σ[((4π/n^2) * (-1)^n) * cos(nx)] from n=1 to infinity\n\nThe Fourier series converges pointwise to f(x) = x^2 for all x in the interval [-π, π], except at the endpoints x = -π and x = π, where it converges to the average value (f(-π) + f(π))/2 = (π^2 + π^2)/2 = π^2.\n\nIn mean square, the Fourier series converges to f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π]. This can be shown by computing the mean square error and showing that it approaches zero as the number of terms in the series increases."
