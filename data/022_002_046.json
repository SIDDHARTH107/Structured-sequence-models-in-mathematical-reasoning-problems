    "message_2": "To find the conformal mapping, we will first map the unit disk to the upper half-plane and then translate and scale the result to map the point $0$ to $1+2i$.\n\nStep 1: Map the unit disk to the upper half-plane.\n\nWe can use the Möbius transformation to map the unit disk to the upper half-plane. The Möbius transformation has the form:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $ad - bc \\neq 0$. We want to find the values of $a, b, c, d$ such that the unit disk is mapped to the upper half-plane.\n\nWe know that the unit disk is symmetric with respect to the real axis, so we can map the point $z = -1$ to the point $z = -\\infty$ and the point $z = 1$ to the point $z = \\infty$. This can be achieved by the following Möbius transformation:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1}$$\n\nNow, we need to map the point $z = i$ to the point $z = 0$. We can do this by composing the above transformation with another Möbius transformation that maps $z = 0$ to $z = i$:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{z - i}{z + i}$$\n\nThe inverse of $g(z)$ is:\n\n$$g^{-1}(z) = \\frac{iz + i}{-z + i}$$\n\nNow, we can find the conformal mapping that transforms the unit disk to the upper half-plane by composing $f(z)$ with $g^{-1}(z)$:\n\n$$h(z) = f(g^{-1}(z)) = f\\left(\\frac{iz + i}{-z + i}\\right) = \\frac{\\frac{iz + i}{-z + i} - 1}{\\frac{iz + i}{-z + i} + 1}$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$h(z) = \\frac{(iz + i) - (-z + i)(-z + i)}{(iz + i) + (-z + i)(-z + i)} = \\frac{iz + i + z^2 - 2zi + 1}{iz + i - z^2 + 2zi + 1} = \\frac{z^2 + (1 + i)z + 1}{-z^2 + (1 - i)z + 1}$$\n\nStep 2: Translate and scale the result to map the point $0$ to $1+2i$.\n\nWe can find the translation and scaling factors by solving the equation:\n\n$$h(0) = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$$\n\n$$h'(0) = \\frac{(2z + (1 + i))(-z^2 + (1 - i)z + 1) - (z^2 + (1 + i)z + 1)(-2z + (1 - i))}{(-z^2 + (1 - i)z + 1)^2}\\Bigg|_{z=0} = 1 + i$$\n\nNow, we can find the final conformal mapping by composing $h(z)$ with the translation and scaling factors:\n\n$$F(z) = (1 + 2i)h(z) = (1 + 2i)\\frac{z^2 + (1 + i)z + 1}{-z^2 + (1 - i)z + 1}$$\n\nSo, the conformal mapping that transforms the unit disk onto the upper half-plane and maps the point $0$ to $1+2i$ is:\n\n$$F(z) = (1 + 2i)\\frac{z^2 + (1 + i)z + 1}{-z^2 + (1 - i)z + 1}$$"
