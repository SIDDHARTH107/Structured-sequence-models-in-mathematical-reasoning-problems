    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation dy/dx = x^2 + y^2, we can use the method of separation of variables. First, we rewrite the equation as:\n\ndy/(y^2) = dx/(x^2)\n\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/y^2) dy = ∫(1/x^2) dx\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n-1/y = -1/x + C\n\nNow, we solve for y:\n\ny = 1/(1/x + C)\n\nWe can now use the initial condition y(0) = 1 to find the value of C:\n\n1 = 1/(1/0 + C)\n\nSince 1/0 is undefined, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1 = 1/C\n\nThus, C = 1.\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\ny = 1/(1/x + 1)\n\nTo find the value of y when x = 1, we plug in x = 1:\n\ny = 1/(1/1 + 1)\n\ny = 1/(2)\n\ny = 1/2\n\nSo, the value of y when x = 1 is y = 1/2."
