    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the elliptic curve E(F7), we need to check all possible combinations of x and y values in the field F7, and count the ones that satisfy the equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1. The field F7 consists of the elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nWe will go through each x value and check if there is a corresponding y value that satisfies the equation. If there is, we will count it as a point on the curve.\n\nFor x = 0:\ny^2 = 0^3 + 2*0 + 1 = 1\ny = 1, 6 (since 1^2 = 6^2 = 1 in F7)\n\nFor x = 1:\ny^2 = 1^3 + 2*1 + 1 = 4\ny = 2, 5 (since 2^2 = 5^2 = 4 in F7)\n\nFor x = 2:\ny^2 = 2^3 + 2*2 + 1 = 13 ≡ 6 in F7\ny = no solution (no y value squares to 6 in F7)\n\nFor x = 3:\ny^2 = 3^3 + 2*3 + 1 = 34 ≡ 6 in F7\ny = no solution (no y value squares to 6 in F7)\n\nFor x = 4:\ny^2 = 4^3 + 2*4 + 1 = 73 ≡ 3 in F7\ny = 3, 4 (since 3^2 = 4^2 = 3 in F7)\n\nFor x = 5:\ny^2 = 5^3 + 2*5 + 1 = 132 ≡ 4 in F7\ny = 2, 5 (since 2^2 = 5^2 = 4 in F7)\n\nFor x = 6:\ny^2 = 6^3 + 2*6 + 1 = 223 ≡ 1 in F7\ny = 1, 6 (since 1^2 = 6^2 = 1 in F7)\n\nSo, the points on the curve E(F7) are:\n(0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 6)\n\nIn total, there are 10 points on the curve E(F7)."
