    "message_1": "If the hypotenuse of a right triangle is 13 cm and one of the acute angles is 35 degrees, what are the trigonometric ratios (sin, cos, tan) of this angle?",
    "message_2": "To find the trigonometric ratios of the given angle, we can use the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent in a right triangle. Let's denote the angle as A, the side opposite to angle A as a, the side adjacent to angle A as b, and the hypotenuse as c.\n\nGiven:\nHypotenuse (c) = 13 cm\nAngle A = 35 degrees\n\nWe can use the sine and cosine functions to find the lengths of the other two sides (a and b).\n\nsin(A) = opposite side (a) / hypotenuse (c)\ncos(A) = adjacent side (b) / hypotenuse (c)\n\nsin(35) = a / 13\na = 13 * sin(35)\n\ncos(35) = b / 13\nb = 13 * cos(35)\n\nNow, we can find the tangent function.\n\ntan(A) = opposite side (a) / adjacent side (b)\ntan(35) = (13 * sin(35)) / (13 * cos(35))\n\nNow, let's calculate the values:\n\nsin(35) ≈ 0.5736\ncos(35) ≈ 0.8192\ntan(35) ≈ 0.7002\n\nSo, the trigonometric ratios for the angle 35 degrees are:\n\nsin(35) ≈ 0.5736\ncos(35) ≈ 0.8192\ntan(35) ≈ 0.7002"
