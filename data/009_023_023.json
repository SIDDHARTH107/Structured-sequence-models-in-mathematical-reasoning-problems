    "message_2": "To solve the given nonlinear Schrödinger equation, we can use the inverse scattering transform (IST) method. However, finding an analytical expression for the solution $u(x,t)$ at $t=1$ is quite involved and requires a deep understanding of the IST method and its application to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation.\n\nHere, we will outline the main steps to find the solution:\n\n1. Identify that the given initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sqrt{2} \\operatorname{sech}(x)$ is a soliton solution of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. This means that the solution will maintain its shape as it propagates in time.\n\n2. Apply the IST method to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with the given initial condition. This involves finding the scattering data (eigenvalues, reflection coefficients, and norming constants) associated with the initial condition.\n\n3. Use the scattering data to construct the solution $u(x,t)$ at any time $t$ by applying the inverse scattering transform. This step involves solving the so-called Riemann-Hilbert problem, which is a complex analytic problem.\n\n4. Evaluate the solution $u(x,t)$ at $t=1$ to obtain the desired analytical expression.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this process is quite involved and requires a deep understanding of the IST method and its application to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. It is beyond the scope of a simple answer. However, we can provide the final result for the solution $u(x,t)$ at $t=1$:\n\n$$u(x,1) = \\sqrt{2} \\operatorname{sech}(x) e^{i(x - \\tanh(x))}$$\n\nThis solution represents a soliton that maintains its shape as it propagates in time, with a phase factor that depends on both $x$ and $t$."
