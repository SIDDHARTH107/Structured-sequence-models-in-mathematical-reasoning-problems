    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x + 1 on the interval [-π, π], we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is not periodic, we will use the complex Fourier series. The complex Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = Σ(c_n * e^(inx))\n\nwhere c_n are the complex Fourier coefficients, and they are given by:\n\nc_n = (1/2π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * e^(-inx) dx\n\nFor the function f(x) = x + 1, we have:\n\nc_n = (1/2π) * ∫[-π, π] (x + 1) * e^(-inx) dx\n\nNow, we will compute the integral separately for x and 1:\n\nc_n = (1/2π) * [∫[-π, π] x * e^(-inx) dx + ∫[-π, π] e^(-inx) dx]\n\nLet's compute the first integral:\n\n∫[-π, π] x * e^(-inx) dx = (1/(-in)) * [e^(-inx) * x] | from -π to π - (1/(-in)) * ∫[-π, π] e^(-inx) dx\n\n= (1/(-in)) * [π * e^(-inπ) - (-π) * e^(inπ)] - (1/(-in)) * [(-1/in) * (e^(-inπ) - e^(inπ))]\n\n= (1/(-in)) * [2π * cos(nπ)] - (1/n²) * [2i * sin(nπ)]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, the second term becomes 0. So, we have:\n\nc_n = (1/(-in)) * [2π * cos(nπ)] = (2π/n) * i * (-1)^n\n\nNow, let's compute the second integral:\n\n∫[-π, π] e^(-inx) dx = (1/(-in)) * (e^(-inπ) - e^(inπ))\n\n= (1/(-in)) * [2i * sin(nπ)]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, this integral becomes 0.\n\nSo, the complex Fourier series for f(x) = x + 1 is:\n\nf(x) = Σ((2π/n) * i * (-1)^n * e^(inx))\n\nThis is the complex Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = x + 1 on the interval [-π, π]."
