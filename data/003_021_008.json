    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors v1 and v2, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors. The dot product formula is:\n\nv1 • v2 = ||v1|| ||v2|| cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the vectors, ||v1|| and ||v2|| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and v1 • v2 is the dot product of the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the vectors:\n\nv1 • v2 = (3 * 5) + (4 * 2) = 15 + 8 = 23\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n||v1|| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n||v2|| = √(5² + 2²) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula:\n\n23 = 5 * √29 * cos(θ)\n\nNow, we can solve for cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = 23 / (5 * √29)\n\nFinally, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nθ = arccos(23 / (5 * √29))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 0.920 radians or ≈ 52.74 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors is approximately 0.920 radians or 52.74 degrees."
