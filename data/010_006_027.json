    "message_2": "An example of a topological space X with a first homotopy group isomorphic to Z_3 is the real projective plane RP^2 with a cell complex structure given by attaching a 2-cell to the boundary of a 1-cell with a 3-fold twist.\n\nTo prove that the first homotopy group of X is indeed isomorphic to Z_3, we will use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The Seifert-van Kampen theorem states that if a space X can be written as the union of two open sets A and B such that A, B, and A ∩ B are path-connected and have trivial fundamental groups, then the fundamental group of X is the free product of the fundamental groups of A and B, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form i(a)j(b)^{-1}, where i and j are the inclusion maps of A ∩ B into A and B, respectively.\n\nLet A be an open set containing the 0-cell and the 1-cell, and B be an open set containing the 0-cell and the 2-cell. Then A ∩ B is an open set containing the 0-cell, and A, B, and A ∩ B are all path-connected. The fundamental group of A is trivial since it is homotopy equivalent to a circle, and the fundamental group of B is trivial since it is homotopy equivalent to a disk.\n\nLet x be the generator of the fundamental group of A ∩ B, and let i(x) and j(x) be the images of x under the inclusion maps i and j, respectively. Then the fundamental group of X is the free product of the fundamental groups of A and B, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form i(x)j(x)^{-1}.\n\nSince the 2-cell is attached to the boundary of the 1-cell with a 3-fold twist, we have i(x)^3 = j(x). Therefore, the fundamental group of X is the free product of the trivial groups, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the element x^3. This is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3, Z_3.\n\nThus, the first homotopy group of X is indeed isomorphic to Z_3."
