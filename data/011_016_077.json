    "message_2": "In a round-robin tournament with 10 teams, we can use the formula for combinations to determine the total number of matches. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of teams and k is the size of the combination (in this case, 2 teams playing each other).\n\nSo, for a 10-team tournament:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!8!)\nC(10, 2) = (10 × 9 × 8!)/(2 × 8!)\nC(10, 2) = (10 × 9) / 2\nC(10, 2) = 90 / 2\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nThere are 45 matches in total in a round-robin tournament with 10 teams."
