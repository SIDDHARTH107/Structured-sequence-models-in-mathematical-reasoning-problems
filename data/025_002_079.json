Suppose that $C_1$ and $C_2$ intersect transversely at $r$ distinct points in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, counted with multiplicity. Determine the degree of the intersection product $[C_1]\\cdot[C_2]$ in the Chow ring $A^*(\\mathbb{P}^2)$, where $[C_i]$ denotes the cohomology class of $C_i$ in $A^*(\\mathbb{P}^2)$ for $i=1,2$, and $\\cdot$ denotes the cup product. \n\nFind the value of $[C_1]\\cdot[C_2]$ in $A^*(\\mathbb{P}^2)$ as a polynomial in $d_1$, $d_2$, and $r$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the intersection product $[C_1] \\cdot [C_2]$ in the Chow ring $A^*(\\mathbb{P}^2)$, we first need to find the cohomology classes of the curves $C_1$ and $C_2$. Since $C_1$ and $C_2$ are algebraic curves in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, their cohomology classes are given by $[C_1] = d_1 h$ and $[C_2] = d_2 h$, where $h$ is the hyperplane class in $A^*(\\mathbb{P}^2)$.\n\nNow, we compute the cup product of these cohomology classes:\n$$[C_1] \\cdot [C_2] = (d_1 h) \\cdot (d_2 h) = d_1 d_2 (h \\cdot h).$$\n\nSince $h$ is the hyperplane class in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, we have $h \\cdot h = [pt]$, the class of a point in $A^*(\\mathbb{P}^2)$. Therefore, the intersection product is given by:\n$$[C_1] \\cdot [C_2] = d_1 d_2 [pt].$$\n\nNow, we need to find the degree of this intersection product. By definition, the degree of an intersection product is the number of intersection points counted with multiplicity. Since $C_1$ and $C_2$ intersect transversely at $r$ distinct points in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, the degree of the intersection product is equal to $r$. Thus, we have:\n$$d_1 d_2 = r.$$\n\nIn conclusion, the intersection product $[C_1] \\cdot [C_2]$ in the Chow ring $A^*(\\mathbb{P}^2)$ is given by the polynomial $d_1 d_2 [pt]$, and its degree is equal to the number of intersection points $r$, which satisfies the equation $d_1 d_2 = r$."
