    "message_2": "To find the period of f(x) + g(x), we first need to find the periods of f(x) and g(x) individually.\n\nFor f(x) = 2sin(x), the period is the same as the period of the sine function, which is 2π. So, the period of f(x) is 2π.\n\nFor g(x) = cos(2x), we need to find the period of the cosine function with the argument 2x. The period of the cosine function is 2π, but since the argument is 2x, the period of g(x) will be half of the period of the cosine function. So, the period of g(x) is π.\n\nNow, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods of f(x) and g(x) to find the period of f(x) + g(x). The LCM of 2π and π is 2π.\n\nTherefore, the period of f(x) + g(x) is 2π."
