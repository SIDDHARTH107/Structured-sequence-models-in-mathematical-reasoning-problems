    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a product defect occurring is 0.03. If a company produces 1000 products, what is the probability that at most 30 products will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective products\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the total number of products (1000 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective products (we want to find the probability of at most 30 defective products)\n- p is the probability of a product being defective (0.03 in this case)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at most 30 defective products, we need to calculate the probability for each value of k from 0 to 30 and then sum them up.\n\nP(X ≤ 30) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 30\n\nP(X ≤ 30) = Σ [C(1000, k) * (0.03)^k * (0.97)^(1000-k)] for k = 0 to 30\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so it's best to use a calculator or software that can handle binomial probability calculations. Using a calculator or software, we get:\n\nP(X ≤ 30) ≈ 0.9136\n\nSo, the probability that at most 30 products will be defective is approximately 0.9136 or 91.36%."
