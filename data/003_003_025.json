    "message_2": "Using the unit circle, we know that the coordinates of a point on the circle can be represented as (cos(θ), sin(θ)), where θ is the angle in radians.\n\nFor θ = pi/3, we can recall the special right triangle with angles 30° (pi/6), 60° (pi/3), and 90° (pi/2). In this triangle, the side ratios are 1:√3:2.\n\nNow, let's consider a right triangle with hypotenuse 1 (the radius of the unit circle) and angle pi/3. The side adjacent to the angle pi/3 will be half the length of the hypotenuse, which is 1/2. Therefore, the coordinates of the point on the unit circle corresponding to the angle pi/3 are (cos(pi/3), sin(pi/3)) = (1/2, √3/2).\n\nSo, the exact value of cos(pi/3) is 1/2."
