    "message_1": "Assuming that an insurance company offers an employee a salary of $50,000 per year, but the employee has the option to choose a commission based salary of 6% per sale. On average, the employee can make 100 sales per year with a commission of $500 per sale. However, there is a 20% chance that the employee will make no sales at all due to Moral Hazard. Should the employee choose the commission-based salary, or stick with the $50,000 per year salary? Which option is more financially advantageous to the employee assuming that the employee is risk-neutral?",
    "message_2": "To determine which option is more financially advantageous, we need to calculate the expected value of each option.\n\nOption 1: Fixed salary of $50,000 per year.\n\nOption 2: Commission-based salary with 6% commission per sale and an average of 100 sales per year with a commission of $500 per sale. There is a 20% chance of making no sales at all due to Moral Hazard.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected commission from the sales:\n\nExpected commission per sale = 6% of $500 = 0.06 * $500 = $30\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected number of sales considering the 20% chance of making no sales:\n\nExpected number of sales = (100 sales * 80%) + (0 sales * 20%) = 80 sales\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected commission-based salary:\n\nExpected commission-based salary = Expected commission per sale * Expected number of sales = $30 * 80 = $2,400\n\nSince the expected commission-based salary ($2,400) is significantly lower than the fixed salary of $50,000, the employee should choose the fixed salary option as it is more financially advantageous."
