    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 2x³ + 5x² - 3x, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x).\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x³)/dx + d(5x²)/dx - d(3x)/dx\nf'(x) = (3 * 2)x^(3-1) + (2 * 5)x^(2-1) - (1 * 3)x^(1-1)\nf'(x) = 6x² + 10x - 3\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative, f''(x), by differentiating f'(x) with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = d(6x²)/dx + d(10x)/dx - d(3)/dx\nf''(x) = (2 * 6)x^(2-1) + (1 * 10)x^(1-1) - 0\nf''(x) = 12x + 10\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) is f''(x) = 12x + 10."
