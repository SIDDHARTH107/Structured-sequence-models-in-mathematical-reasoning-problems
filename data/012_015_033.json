    "message_2": "To determine the connectivity of the graph, we need to find the minimum number of vertices that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In this case, we can see that removing vertex E will disconnect the graph into two separate components:\n\n```\n  A---B   C\n  |       |\n  D       F\n```\n\nThus, the connectivity of the graph is 1, as removing a single vertex (E) is enough to disconnect the graph."
