    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 120 = 2^3 × 3 × 5\n\n2. Determine the number of possible groups for each prime factor:\n\n- For the prime factor 2, there are five possible groups: Cyclic (C_2, C_4, C_8), Dihedral (D_4, D_8), Quaternion (Q_8), and two non-abelian groups of order 8 (the direct product of Q_8 and C_2, and the direct product of D_4 and C_2).\n- For the prime factor 3, there are two possible groups: Cyclic (C_3) and Dihedral (D_3).\n- For the prime factor 5, there is only one possible group: Cyclic (C_5).\n\n3. Use the formula for the number of distinct non-isomorphic groups of order n = p₁^a₁ × p₂^a₂ × ... × p_k^a_k:\n\nNumber of groups = (number of groups for p₁^a₁) × (number of groups for p₂^a₂) × ... × (number of groups for p_k^a_k)\n\nIn our case:\n\nNumber of groups = (5 groups for 2^3) × (2 groups for 3) × (1 group for 5) = 5 × 2 × 1 = 10\n\nTherefore, there are 10 distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
