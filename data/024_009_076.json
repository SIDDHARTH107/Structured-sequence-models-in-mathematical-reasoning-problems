    "message_2": "To find the scalar curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface by the coordinates (u, v) as follows:\n\nX(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives of X with respect to u and v:\n\nX_u = (∂X/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nX_v = (∂X/∂v) = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = <X_u, X_u> = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <X_u, X_v> = 4uv\nG = <X_v, X_v> = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives of X:\n\nX_uu = (∂²X/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nX_uv = (∂²X/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 0)\nX_vv = (∂²X/∂v²) = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNext, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = <N, X_uu> = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nM = <N, X_uv> = 0\nN = <N, X_vv> = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface.\n\nFinally, we compute the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\nH = (LE + GN - 2FM) / (2(EG - F^2))\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\n\nL = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2) = 1/3\nM = 0\nN = 1/3\n\nNow, we compute the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H:\n\nK = (1/9) / (25 - 16) = 1/9\nH = (5/3 - 0) / (18) = 5/18\n\nThe scalar curvature R is given by:\n\nR = 2K = 2/9\n\nSo, the scalar curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2) is 2/9."
