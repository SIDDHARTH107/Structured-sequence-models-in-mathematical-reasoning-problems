    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1$ at the point $(1,2)$, we first need to find the derivative of the curve with respect to $x$. \n\nGiven the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1$, we can implicitly differentiate both sides with respect to $x$:\n\n$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 + 2$\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3x^2 + 2}{2y}$\n\nNext, we'll plug in the point $(1,2)$ to find the slope of the tangent line at that point:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx}(1,2) = \\frac{3(1)^2 + 2}{2(2)} = \\frac{5}{4}$\n\nNow that we have the slope of the tangent line, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$\n\nPlugging in the point $(1,2)$ and the slope $\\frac{5}{4}$:\n\n$y - 2 = \\frac{5}{4}(x - 1)$\n\nTo put the equation in slope-intercept form, we can distribute the slope and add 2 to both sides:\n\n$y = \\frac{5}{4}(x - 1) + 2$\n\n$y = \\frac{5}{4}x - \\frac{5}{4} + 2$\n\n$y = \\frac{5}{4}x - \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{8}{4}$\n\n$y = \\frac{5}{4}x + \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1$ at the point $(1,2)$ is:\n\n$y = \\frac{5}{4}x + \\frac{3}{4}$"
