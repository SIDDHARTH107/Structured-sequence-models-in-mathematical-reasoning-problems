    "message_2": "There are 14 distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 16. We will show that any group of order 16 is isomorphic to one of these 14 groups. The groups are:\n\n1. C16 (cyclic group of order 16)\n2. C8 × C2 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 8 and 2)\n3. C4 × C4 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 4 and 4)\n4. C4 × C2 × C2 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 4, 2, and 2)\n5. D8 (dihedral group of order 16)\n6. Q16 (quaternion group of order 16)\n7-14. Eight distinct non-abelian groups of order 16\n\nProof:\n\nLet G be a group of order 16. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G is 1, which implies that G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup. Since the order of G is 16, this normal Sylow 2-subgroup is G itself.\n\nNow, let x be an element of G with the largest possible order. Since G is a p-group (a group of order p^n for some prime p), the order of x must be a power of 2. Let the order of x be 2^k, where k is a positive integer. Then, the subgroup generated by x, denoted by <x>, is a cyclic group of order 2^k.\n\nIf k = 4, then <x> = G, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16.\n\nIf k = 3, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups C8 × C2.\n\nIf k = 2, then G is isomorphic to either the direct product of cyclic groups C4 × C4 or C4 × C2 × C2.\n\nNow, we consider the case when G is non-abelian. If G has an element of order 8, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8. If G has no element of order 8, then G is isomorphic to either the quaternion group Q16 or one of the eight distinct non-abelian groups of order 16.\n\nThus, any group of order 16 is isomorphic to one of the 14 distinct non-isomorphic groups mentioned above."
