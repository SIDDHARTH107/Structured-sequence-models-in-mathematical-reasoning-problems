    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to rewrite the equation in a way that isolates x. We can do this by taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation. In this case, we'll use the base 2 logarithm (log2) since the equation involves 2 raised to a power.\n\n2^(x+1) = 16\n\nlog2(2^(x+1)) = log2(16)\n\nNow, we can use the logarithm property that states logb(a^c) = c * logb(a). In this case, we have:\n\n(x+1) * log2(2) = log2(16)\n\nSince log2(2) = 1, we can simplify the equation to:\n\nx+1 = log2(16)\n\nNow we need to find the value of log2(16). Since 2^4 = 16, we know that log2(16) = 4. So, we have:\n\nx+1 = 4\n\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting 1 from both sides:\n\nx = 4 - 1\nx = 3\n\nSo, the solution to the equation 2^(x+1) = 16 is x = 3."
