    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a closed surface S, the integral of the Gaussian curvature K over the surface S is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic χ(S):\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ(S)\n\nGiven that the Gaussian curvature K is constant and equal to 1, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n∫∫_S 1 dA = A(S)\n\nwhere A(S) is the total area of the surface S. Now, we have:\n\nA(S) = 2πχ(S)\n\nSince the Gaussian curvature K is 1, we can find the total area of the surface S by integrating K over the surface:\n\nA(S) = ∫∫_S 1 dA = ∫∫_S K dA\n\nNow, we can use the given information to find the Euler characteristic χ(S):\n\nA(S) = 2πχ(S)\n\nχ(S) = A(S) / 2π\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to determine the exact value of A(S). Therefore, we cannot find the exact value of the Euler characteristic χ(S) without more information about the surface S."
