    "message_2": "To find the time it takes for the car to travel 180 miles at a constant speed of 60 mph, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nTime = 180 miles / 60 mph\n\nTime = 3 hours\n\nSo, it will take the car 3 hours to travel a distance of 180 miles at a constant speed of 60 mph."
