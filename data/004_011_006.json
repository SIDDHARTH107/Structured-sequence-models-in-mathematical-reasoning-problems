    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall. The ladder is 15 feet long and the base of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second. At the moment when the base of the ladder is 9 feet from the wall, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. We are given that the ladder is 15 feet long, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 15^2\n\nWe are also given that the base of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second, so dx/dt = 2 ft/s. We want to find dy/dt when x = 9 feet.\n\nDifferentiating both sides of the equation with respect to time t, we get:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 9 feet. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n9^2 + y^2 = 15^2\n81 + y^2 = 225\ny^2 = 144\ny = 12\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of x, y, and dx/dt into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(9)(2) + 2(12)(dy/dt) = 0\n36 + 24(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, solve for dy/dt:\n\n24(dy/dt) = -36\ndy/dt = -36/24\ndy/dt = -3/2\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 3/2 feet per second (or 1.5 ft/s) when the base of the ladder is 9 feet from the wall."
