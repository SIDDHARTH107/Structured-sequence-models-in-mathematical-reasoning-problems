    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will consider the possible orders of elements in G.\n\nSince G has order 4, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 4. Note that the identity element has order 1, and there is only one such element in G.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nLet g be an element in G with order 4. Then, the powers of g are distinct: {e, g, g^2, g^3}, where e is the identity element. Therefore, G = {e, g, g^2, g^3}. Since G is generated by g, G is a cyclic group of order 4, and thus G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G has no element of order 4.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let G = {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element, and a, b, and c are distinct non-identity elements. Since the orders of a, b, and c are 2, we have a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e.\n\nNow, consider the product ab. Since ab is not equal to e (otherwise, b would be equal to a^{-1} = a, which contradicts the distinctness of a and b), ab must be equal to either a, b, or c. However, ab cannot be equal to a or b, as this would imply that b or a, respectively, is the identity element, which is a contradiction. Therefore, ab = c.\n\nNow, we have the following relations in G:\n1. a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e\n2. ab = c\n\nWe can also deduce that:\n3. bc = a (since (ab)c = a(bc) => c^2 = ab(bc) => e = ab(bc) => a^{-1} = b(bc) => a^{-1} = bc)\n4. ac = b (similarly, (ac)b = a(cb) => c^2 = a(ac)b => e = a(ac)b => a^{-1} = (ac)b => a^{-1} = ac)\n\nNow, we can define a binary operation * on G as follows:\n- e * x = x * e = x for all x in G\n- a * a = b * b = c * c = e\n- a * b = c, b * a = c\n- b * c = a, c * b = a\n- c * a = b, a * c = b\n\nThis operation makes G isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4. To see this, consider the group V4 = {e, a', b', c'} with the operation *', where a'^2 = b'^2 = c'^2 = e and a'b' = c', b'c' = a', c'a' = b'. The isomorphism φ: G → V4 defined by φ(e) = e', φ(a) = a', φ(b) = b', and φ(c) = c' preserves the group operation, i.e., φ(x * y) = φ(x) *' φ(y) for all x, y in G.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 4, it must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4, depending on whether or not it has an element of order 4."
