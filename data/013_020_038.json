    "message_2": "To maximize your chances of winning, you should try to predict what the other players will choose and then choose a number that is 2/3 of the average of their choices. This is known as a \"level-k\" reasoning strategy, where you assume that other players are also using the same strategy.\n\nLet's start with level-0 reasoning. If all players choose randomly, the average of their choices will be around 50 (since it's the midpoint of the range 0 to 100). So, a level-1 player would choose 2/3 of 50, which is approximately 33.\n\nNow, if all players are level-1 thinkers and choose around 33, a level-2 player would choose 2/3 of 33, which is approximately 22.\n\nContinuing this process, we get the following sequence of choices:\n\nLevel-0: 50\nLevel-1: 33\nLevel-2: 22\nLevel-3: 14.67\nLevel-4: 9.78\nLevel-5: 6.52\nLevel-6: 4.35\nLevel-7: 2.9\nLevel-8: 1.93\nLevel-9: 1.29\n\nAs we go deeper into the levels, the choices get closer and closer to 0. However, in a real game, not all players will think at the same level. Some might be level-1 thinkers, some might be level-2, and so on. Therefore, to maximize your chances of winning, you should choose a number that is a good compromise between these different levels.\n\nOne possible strategy is to choose a number close to the level-2 choice, which is around 22. This is because it's a reasonable assumption that many players will be level-1 thinkers and choose around 33, and some might be level-0 thinkers and choose around 50. By choosing 22, you'll be closer to 2/3 of the average in these cases.\n\nOf course, there's no guarantee that this strategy will always win, as the outcome depends on the choices of the other players. But choosing a number around 22 should give you a good chance of winning in this beauty contest game."
