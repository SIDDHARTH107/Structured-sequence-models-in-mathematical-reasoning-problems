    "message_2": "First, let's find the union of A and B, which is A∪B = {1, 2, 3, 4}. The complement of A∪B, denoted as (A∪B)', is the set of all elements not in A∪B. Assuming the universal set U contains all integers, we have (A∪B)' = {..., -2, -1, 0, 5, 6, ...}.\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, which is A×B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}. The complement of A×B, denoted as (A×B)', is the set of all ordered pairs not in A×B. We can't list all the elements of (A×B)', but we know it contains all ordered pairs of integers except those in A×B.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A∪B)' and (A×B)', denoted as (A∪B)' × (A×B)'. This set contains all possible ordered pairs where the first element is from (A∪B)' and the second element is from (A×B)'.\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian products A'×B', A'×B, and A×B'. A' is the set of all elements not in A, so A' = {..., -2, -1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...}. Similarly, B' is the set of all elements not in B, so B' = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, ...}.\n\nA'×B' contains all ordered pairs where the first element is from A' and the second element is from B'. A'×B contains all ordered pairs where the first element is from A' and the second element is from B. A×B' contains all ordered pairs where the first element is from A and the second element is from B'.\n\nNow, let's find the union of these three sets: (A'×B') ∪ (A'×B) ∪ (A×B'). This set contains all ordered pairs where the first element is from A' and the second element is from B', or the first element is from A' and the second element is from B, or the first element is from A and the second element is from B'.\n\nComparing (A∪B)' × (A×B)' and (A'×B') ∪ (A'×B) ∪ (A×B'), we can see that they are not equal. The first set contains all possible ordered pairs where the first element is from (A∪B)' and the second element is from (A×B)', while the second set contains all ordered pairs where the first element is from A' and the second element is from B', or the first element is from A' and the second element is from B, or the first element is from A and the second element is from B'.\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement."
