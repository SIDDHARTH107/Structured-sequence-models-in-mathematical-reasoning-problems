    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it is not possible to create a precise numerical problem for the Intuitionistic logic subtopic in Mathematics. Intuitionistic logic is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with reasoning under the assumption that not all mathematical statements have a definite truth value. It is an abstract concept that deals with the structure of proofs rather than specific numerical computations. Can I assist you with anything else?",
    "message_2": "Of course! If you have any other mathematical problems or topics you'd like assistance with, please feel free to ask."
