    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation (2 * (2x + 3y) = 4x + 6y). This means that the first two equations are dependent and represent the same line. So, we only need to solve the system using the first and the third equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 14\n-5x - 7y = 21\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. We will first eliminate y by making the coefficients of y in both equations the same. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 3:\n\n(2x + 3y) * 7 = 14 * 7\n(-5x - 7y) * 3 = 21 * 3\n\nWhich results in:\n\n14x + 21y = 98\n-15x - 21y = 63\n\nNow, we can add both equations to eliminate y:\n\n(14x + 21y) + (-15x - 21y) = 98 + 63\n14x + 21y - 15x - 21y = 161\n-1x = 161\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = -161\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 14\n2(-161) + 3y = 14\n-322 + 3y = 14\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\n3y = 336\ny = 112\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -161 and y = 112."
