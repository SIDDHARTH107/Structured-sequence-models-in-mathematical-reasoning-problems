    "message_2": "If the Cayley diagram of a group of order 20 has a cyclic relation of order 20, it means that there is an element in the group that generates the entire group by its powers. In other words, the group is cyclic.\n\nA group of order 20 can be represented as Z_20, where Z_20 is the set of integers modulo 20. The group operation is addition modulo 20. Since the group is cyclic, it has a generator, say g, such that the powers of g generate the entire group:\n\ng^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^19\n\nThe structure of this group is isomorphic to the additive group of integers modulo 20, which can be written as:\n\nZ_20 = {0, 1, 2, ..., 19}\n\nwith the group operation being addition modulo 20."
