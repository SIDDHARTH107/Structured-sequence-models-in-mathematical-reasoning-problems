    "message_2": "Yes, this degree sequence is possible for a simple graph. Here is one such graph:\n\nLet the vertices be A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n\n1. Connect vertex A to vertices B, C, and D. Now, the degree of A is 3.\n2. Connect vertex B to vertices C and E. Now, the degree of B is 2.\n3. Connect vertex C to vertex F. Now, the degree of C is 2.\n\nThe graph now has the following edges: AB, AC, AD, BC, BE, and CF. The degree sequence is (3,2,2,1,1,1), as required."
