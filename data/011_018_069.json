    "message_1": "A math student is tasked with creating a block design for a tournament with 10 teams. The tournament will consist of 4 rounds and each team will play once in each round. How many blocks must be created in the design to ensure that no team plays against the same team twice?",
    "message_2": "In a tournament with 10 teams, there will be a total of 10 * (10 - 1) / 2 = 45 unique pairings of teams. Since each team plays once in each round, there will be 10 / 2 = 5 games per round. To ensure that no team plays against the same team twice, we need to distribute the 45 unique pairings across the 4 rounds.\n\nTo create a block design for this tournament, we can use a round-robin scheduling algorithm. In this case, we can arrange the teams in a circle and rotate them, keeping one team fixed. This will create a schedule where each team plays against every other team exactly once.\n\nHere's an example of a round-robin schedule for 10 teams:\n\nRound 1:\n(1, 10), (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6)\n\nRound 2:\n(1, 9), (10, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5)\n\nRound 3:\n(1, 8), (9, 7), (10, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4)\n\nRound 4:\n(1, 7), (8, 6), (9, 5), (10, 4), (2, 3)\n\nIn this example, we have created 4 blocks (rounds) with 5 games in each block. This ensures that no team plays against the same team twice. So, the answer is 4 blocks."
