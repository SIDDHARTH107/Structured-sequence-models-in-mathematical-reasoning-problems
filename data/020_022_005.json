    "message_1": "A toy company produces two types of toys, type A and type B. The company has a maximum of 3000 pounds of raw material and 2100 man-hours available per month. An hour of type A toy production requires 2 pounds of raw material and 3 man-hours, while an hour of type B toy production requires 4 pounds of raw material and 1 man-hour. The profit per unit of type A toy is $25 and for type B toy is $20. How many units of type A and type B toys should the company produce to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of type A toys and y be the number of units of type B toys.\n\nThe constraints for the raw material and man-hours can be written as:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 3000 (raw material constraint)\n3x + y ≤ 2100 (man-hour constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 25x + 20y\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. First, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 3000\ny ≤ (3000 - 2x) / 4\ny ≤ 750 - 0.5x\n\n3x + y ≤ 2100\ny ≤ 2100 - 3x\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. We also have the non-negativity constraints x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0. Now we find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0: (0, 0)\n2. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 2100 - 3x: (0, 2100)\n3. Intersection of y = 0 and y = 750 - 0.5x: (1500, 0)\n4. Intersection of y = 750 - 0.5x and y = 2100 - 3x:\n\n750 - 0.5x = 2100 - 3x\n2.5x = 1350\nx = 540\n\ny = 2100 - 3(540) = 480\n\nSo the intersection point is (540, 480).\n\nNow we evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 25(0) + 20(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 2100) = 25(0) + 20(2100) = $42,000\n3. P(1500, 0) = 25(1500) + 20(0) = $37,500\n4. P(540, 480) = 25(540) + 20(480) = $21,000 + $9,600 = $30,600\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex (0, 2100) with a profit of $42,000. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of type A toys and 2100 units of type B toys to maximize the profit."
