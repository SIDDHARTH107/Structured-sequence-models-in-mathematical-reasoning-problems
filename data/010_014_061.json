    "message_2": "To compute the first cohomology group H^1(X, Z) of the torus X, we can use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. We will cover the torus X with two open sets U and V such that their intersection U ∩ V is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1. \n\nLet U be the torus with a small open disk removed from its interior, and V be an open annulus that wraps around the torus. Then, U is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1, V is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1, and U ∩ V is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1.\n\nNow, we can apply the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for reduced cohomology groups:\n\n... → H^0(X, Z) → H^0(U, Z) ⊕ H^0(V, Z) → H^0(U ∩ V, Z) → H^1(X, Z) → H^1(U, Z) ⊕ H^1(V, Z) → H^1(U ∩ V, Z) → ...\n\nSince U, V, and U ∩ V are all homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1, we have:\n\nH^0(U, Z) ≅ H^0(V, Z) ≅ H^0(U ∩ V, Z) ≅ Z\nH^1(U, Z) ≅ H^1(V, Z) ≅ H^1(U ∩ V, Z) ≅ Z\n\nPlugging these into the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, we get:\n\n... → H^0(X, Z) → Z ⊕ Z → Z → H^1(X, Z) → Z ⊕ Z → Z → ...\n\nThe connecting homomorphism from H^0(U ∩ V, Z) to H^1(X, Z) is an isomorphism, so we have:\n\nH^1(X, Z) ≅ Z ⊕ Z\n\nThus, the first cohomology group of the torus X with coefficients in the group Z of integers is H^1(X, Z) ≅ Z ⊕ Z."
