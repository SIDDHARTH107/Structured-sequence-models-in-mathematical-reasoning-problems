    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. The graph G has the following edges: {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. Let's choose edge (3,4) to apply the deletion-contraction algorithm.\n\n1. Delete edge (3,4): The remaining edges are {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,5), (4,5)}. This graph is a tree, so its chromatic polynomial is P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)^(n-1) = k(k-1)^4.\n\n2. Contract edge (3,4): The resulting graph has vertices {1, 2, 3, 5} and edges {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,5)}. This graph is also a tree, so its chromatic polynomial is P(G/e, k) = k(k-1)^(n-2) = k(k-1)^3.\n\nNow, we can use the deletion-contraction formula: P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k) = k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)^3.\n\nFactor out k(k-1)^3: P(G, k) = k(k-1)^3(k-1) = k(k-1)^4.\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G is P(G, k) = k(k-1)^4."
