    "message_1": "In a medical study, the heights, weights, and ages of 100 male patients were recorded. The data were analyzed using multivariate analysis, and a correlation matrix was obtained between these three variables. The correlation coefficient between height and weight was found to be 0.75, between height and age was found to be -0.45, and between weight and age was found to be 0.60. \n\nIf the mean height of these 100 male patients was 175 cm with a standard deviation of 5 cm, the mean weight was 70 kg with a standard deviation of 10 kg, and the mean age was 40 years with a standard deviation of 7 years, what is the expected weight of a male patient who is 180 cm tall and 45 years old?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected weight of a male patient who is 180 cm tall and 45 years old, we can use the multiple regression equation:\n\nWeight = b0 + b1 * Height + b2 * Age\n\nwhere b0 is the intercept, b1 is the coefficient for height, and b2 is the coefficient for age.\n\nFirst, we need to find the coefficients b1 and b2. We can use the following formulas:\n\nb1 = r_hw * (SD_w / SD_h)\nb2 = r_wa * (SD_w / SD_a)\n\nwhere r_hw is the correlation coefficient between height and weight, r_wa is the correlation coefficient between weight and age, SD_w is the standard deviation of weight, SD_h is the standard deviation of height, and SD_a is the standard deviation of age.\n\nUsing the given correlation coefficients and standard deviations:\n\nb1 = 0.75 * (10 / 5) = 1.5\nb2 = 0.60 * (10 / 7) ≈ 0.857\n\nNow, we need to find the intercept b0. We can use the following formula:\n\nb0 = Mean_w - b1 * Mean_h - b2 * Mean_a\n\nUsing the given means:\n\nb0 = 70 - 1.5 * 175 - 0.857 * 40 ≈ -95.28\n\nNow, we can plug in the height and age of the male patient into the multiple regression equation:\n\nWeight = -95.28 + 1.5 * 180 + 0.857 * 45 ≈ 70.985\n\nThe expected weight of a male patient who is 180 cm tall and 45 years old is approximately 70.99 kg."
