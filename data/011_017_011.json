    "message_2": "A Latin Square of order 4 is a 4x4 grid filled with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 such that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. To find the number of distinct Latin squares of order 4, we can use the following method:\n\n1. Fill in the first row in any order. There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to do this, which is 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways.\n\n2. Fill in the second row. The first entry in the second row is determined by the first row (it must be the number not in the same column in the first row). There are 3 remaining choices for the second entry in the second row. After that, there are 2 choices for the third entry, and the last entry is determined. So there are 3 × 2 = 6 ways to fill in the second row.\n\n3. Fill in the third row. The first two entries are determined by the first two columns. There are 2 ways to fill in the remaining two entries in the third row.\n\n4. Fill in the fourth row. At this point, all entries in the fourth row are determined by the previous rows.\n\nSo, the total number of distinct Latin squares of order 4 is:\n\n24 (ways to fill the first row) × 6 (ways to fill the second row) × 2 (ways to fill the third row) = 24 × 6 × 2 = 288.\n\nTherefore, there are 288 distinct Latin squares of order 4 that can be generated from the given entries."
