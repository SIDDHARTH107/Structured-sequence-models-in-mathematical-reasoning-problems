    "message_2": "To solve the equation |3x + 4| = 10, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x + 4 is positive or zero\nIn this case, we can remove the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n3x + 4 = 10\n3x = 6\nx = 2\n\nCase 2: 3x + 4 is negative\nIn this case, we need to negate the expression inside the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n-(3x + 4) = 10\n-3x - 4 = 10\n-3x = 14\nx = -14/3\n\nSo, the two solutions for x are x = 2 and x = -14/3."
