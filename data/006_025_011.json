    "message_1": "Suppose a magician has five cards, numbered 1 through 5. In his performance, he shuffles the cards and selects two of them at random. What is the probability that he selects card number 3 and another odd-numbered card?",
    "message_2": "There are a total of 5 cards, and the magician is selecting 2 of them. So, there are C(5,2) = 10 possible combinations of cards that the magician can select, where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.\n\nNow, we need to find the combinations that include card number 3 and another odd-numbered card. The other odd-numbered cards are 1 and 5. So, there are 2 possible combinations that meet the criteria: {1, 3} and {3, 5}.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the magician selects card number 3 and another odd-numbered card is the number of successful outcomes (2) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (10):\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 2 / 10 = 1 / 5 = 0.2 or 20%."
