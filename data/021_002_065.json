    "message_2": "To find the largest eigenvalue using the power iteration method, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial guess vector x0 = [1; 1].\n2. Compute the product Ax for the current vector x.\n3. Normalize the resulting vector.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the desired number of iterations.\n\nLet's perform 3 iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nx0 = [1; 1]\nAx0 = A * [1; 1] = [2*1 + 1*1; 1*1 + 2*1] = [3; 3]\nNormalize Ax0: [3/√18; 3/√18] = [1/√2; 1/√2]\n\nIteration 2:\nx1 = [1/√2; 1/√2]\nAx1 = A * [1/√2; 1/√2] = [2*(1/√2) + 1*(1/√2); 1*(1/√2) + 2*(1/√2)] = [3/√2; 3/√2]\nNormalize Ax1: [3/√18; 3/√18] = [1/√2; 1/√2]\n\nIteration 3:\nx2 = [1/√2; 1/√2]\nAx2 = A * [1/√2; 1/√2] = [2*(1/√2) + 1*(1/√2); 1*(1/√2) + 2*(1/√2)] = [3/√2; 3/√2]\nNormalize Ax2: [3/√18; 3/√18] = [1/√2; 1/√2]\n\nNow, we can approximate the largest eigenvalue by taking the dot product of Ax2 and x2:\n\nλ ≈ (Ax2) ⋅ x2 = [3/√2; 3/√2] ⋅ [1/√2; 1/√2] = (3/2) + (3/2) = 3\n\nSo, after 3 iterations, the approximation for the largest eigenvalue is 3."
