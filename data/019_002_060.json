    "message_1": "Let P(x) be the statement \"x is a prime number\" and Q(x) be the statement \"x is an odd number\". Write the negation of the statement \"Every prime number is odd\" in predicate logic notation, and then determine whether it is true or false:\n\nNegation: There exists a prime number x such that not Q(x), i.e., \"There exists a prime number that is not odd\" or ∃x(P(x) ∧ ¬Q(x)).\n\nDetermining truth value: The negation is false since every prime number is indeed odd.",
    "message_2": "I apologize for my previous incorrect responses. Let's reevaluate the truth value of the negation.\n\nNegation: There exists a prime number x such that not Q(x), i.e., \"There exists a prime number that is not odd\" or ∃x(P(x) ∧ ¬Q(x)).\n\nDetermining truth value: The negation is true since there exists a prime number that is not odd, which is 2. All other prime numbers are odd, but the existence of 2 as a prime number that is not odd makes the negation true."
