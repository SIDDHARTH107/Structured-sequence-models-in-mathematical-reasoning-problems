Similarly, C is a superset of set B if every element of B is also an element of C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of A:\n\n1 ∈ A ∪ B (yes)\n3 ∈ A ∪ B (yes)\n5 ∈ A ∪ B (yes)\n7 ∈ A ∪ B (yes)\n\nSince all elements of A are in A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of B:\n\n2 ∈ A ∪ B (yes)\n4 ∈ A ∪ B (yes)\n6 ∈ A ∪ B (yes)\n\nSince all elements of B are in A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, the union of sets A and B, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, is a superset of each of the sets A and B."
