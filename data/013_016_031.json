    "message_1": "A company is deciding whether or not to invest in a new project. The project's expected profits (in thousands of dollars) depend on the effort level of the manager hired to oversee the project. The company can offer the manager a salary of $50,000 or $80,000, with a 50% chance of each offer. The manager's effort level can be either \"low\" or \"high\", with the following profit outcomes for each combination of salary and effort level:\n\n- $50,000 salary, low effort: $100 profit\n- $50,000 salary, high effort: $200 profit\n- $80,000 salary, low effort: $150 profit\n- $80,000 salary, high effort: $300 profit\n\nAssuming the manager is risk-averse and makes decisions based on expected utility, what salary offer should the company make to motivate the manager to choose the high-effort level?",
    "message_2": "To determine the salary offer that would motivate the manager to choose the high-effort level, we need to compare the expected utility of each salary and effort level combination. Since the manager is risk-averse, they will choose the option with the highest expected utility.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected profit for each salary and effort level combination:\n\n1. $50,000 salary, low effort: $100 profit\n2. $50,000 salary, high effort: $200 profit\n3. $80,000 salary, low effort: $150 profit\n4. $80,000 salary, high effort: $300 profit\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected utility for each combination. We'll assume that the utility of the profit is equal to the profit itself (i.e., U($100) = $100, U($200) = $200, etc.).\n\n1. $50,000 salary, low effort: 0.5 * $100 = $50\n2. $50,000 salary, high effort: 0.5 * $200 = $100\n3. $80,000 salary, low effort: 0.5 * $150 = $75\n4. $80,000 salary, high effort: 0.5 * $300 = $150\n\nComparing the expected utilities, we can see that the manager would choose the high-effort level if they are offered the $80,000 salary, as it has the highest expected utility ($150). Therefore, the company should offer the manager a salary of $80,000 to motivate them to choose the high-effort level."
