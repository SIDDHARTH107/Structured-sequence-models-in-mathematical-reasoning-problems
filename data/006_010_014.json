    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of a group of 200 people, where 20% are over the age of 60, and the overall probability of getting a disease is 10%, that at least 15 people over the age of 60 will get the disease?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, people over 60 getting the disease)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of getting the disease, which is 10% or 0.1)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of people over 60, which is 20% of 200, or 40 people)\n- k is the number of successes we are interested in (in this case, at least 15 people over 60 getting the disease)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 15 people over 60 getting the disease, we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 15, 16, ..., 40. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nP(X ≥ 15) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 15 to 40\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 15) = Σ [C(40, k) * (0.1)^k * (0.9)^(40-k)] for k = 15 to 40\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 15) ≈ 0.1187\n\nSo, the probability that at least 15 people over the age of 60 will get the disease is approximately 11.87%."
