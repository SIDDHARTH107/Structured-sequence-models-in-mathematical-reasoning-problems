The warehouses are connected by a transportation network, and the transportation cost between any two warehouses is given in the following matrix: \n\n|       | W1 | W2 | W3 | W4 | W5 | W6 |\n|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| **W1** | 0  | 8  | 7  | 12 | 5  | 6  |\n| **W2** | 8  | 0  | 5  | 10 | 4  | 7  |\n| **W3** | 7  | 5  | 0  | 6  | 3  | 4  |\n| **W4** | 12 | 10 | 6  | 0  | 8  | 9  |\n| **W5** | 5  | 4  | 3  | 8  | 0  | 5  |\n| **W6** | 6  | 7  | 4  | 9  | 5  | 0  |\n\nThe company wants to deliver goods from warehouse W1 to warehouse W6 at minimum cost. However, due to certain constraints, they must pass through warehouse W3 before reaching W6. What is the optimal route and the minimum cost to deliver the goods from W1 to W6 via W3?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route and the minimum cost to deliver the goods from W1 to W6 via W3, we need to find the shortest path from W1 to W3 and then from W3 to W6.\n\nFrom the matrix, the direct cost from W1 to W3 is 7. Now, let's check if there's a shorter path through other warehouses:\n\n1. W1 -> W2 -> W3: 8 + 5 = 13 (not shorter)\n2. W1 -> W4 -> W3: 12 + 6 = 18 (not shorter)\n3. W1 -> W5 -> W3: 5 + 3 = 8 (not shorter)\n\nSo, the shortest path from W1 to W3 is the direct path with a cost of 7.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from W3 to W6:\n\n1. W3 -> W1 -> W6: 7 + 6 = 13 (not shorter)\n2. W3 -> W2 -> W6: 5 + 7 = 12 (not shorter)\n3. W3 -> W4 -> W6: 6 + 9 = 15 (not shorter)\n4. W3 -> W5 -> W6: 3 + 5 = 8 (not shorter)\n\nSo, the shortest path from W3 to W6 is the direct path with a cost of 4.\n\nTherefore, the optimal route is W1 -> W3 -> W6, and the minimum cost is 7 + 4 = 11."
