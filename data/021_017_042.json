    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population.\n2. Perform mutation, crossover, and selection.\n3. Repeat step 2 for the desired number of iterations.\n4. Find the best solution in the final population.\n\nLet's start by initializing the population. We will create 20 random individuals within the interval [-4, 4].\n\nNow, we will perform mutation, crossover, and selection for 100 iterations. In each iteration, we will do the following:\n\n1. For each individual in the population, create a mutant vector by combining three other distinct individuals. The mutant vector is created by adding the scaled difference between two of the individuals to the third one.\n2. Perform crossover between the target individual and the mutant vector with a crossover probability of 0.8.\n3. Compare the fitness of the offspring with the target individual. If the offspring has better fitness (i.e., a lower value of f(x)), replace the target individual with the offspring.\n\nAfter 100 iterations, we will find the best solution in the final population by selecting the individual with the lowest value of f(x).\n\nPlease note that the Differential Evolution algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, and the solution may not be the exact minimum value. The algorithm's performance depends on the initial population, the number of iterations, and the parameter settings.\n\nSince I am an AI language model and cannot perform calculations in real-time, I recommend using a programming language like Python to implement the Differential Evolution algorithm and find the minimum value of the function within the given interval. You can use the `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution` function from the SciPy library to achieve this."
