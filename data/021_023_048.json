    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company has a total of 3000 hours of machine time and 900 hours of labor time each week. The production of Product A requires 4 hours of machine time and 3 hours of labor time, while the production of Product B requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor time. The company earns a profit of $30 for each unit of Product A sold and $20 for each unit of Product B sold. How many units of each product should be produced to maximize the company's weekly profit? Use grey wolf optimizer to solve the optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can provide you with the mathematical formulation of the problem and the constraints. However, I cannot execute the Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm as it requires programming and computational resources. Here's the mathematical formulation of the problem:\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 30A + 20B\n\nConstraints:\n1. 4A + 3B ≤ 3000 (machine time constraint)\n2. 3A + 2B ≤ 900 (labor time constraint)\n3. A ≥ 0\n4. B ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this problem using the Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm, you would need to implement the algorithm in a programming language (such as Python) and use the objective function and constraints as inputs. The algorithm will then search for the optimal solution (i.e., the number of units of Product A and Product B that maximize the profit) within the feasible region defined by the constraints."
