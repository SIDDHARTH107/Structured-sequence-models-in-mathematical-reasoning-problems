    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier transform of f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nIn this case, f(t) = 3cos(2πt) + 2sin(4πt). We can rewrite this function as:\n\nf(t) = 3cos(2πt) + 2jsin(4πt)\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of each term separately:\n\nFor the first term, 3cos(2πt):\n\nF1(ω) = ∫[3cos(2πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nFor the second term, 2jsin(4πt):\n\nF2(ω) = ∫[2jsin(4πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nThe Fourier transform of the entire function f(t) is the sum of the Fourier transforms of its individual terms:\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω)\n\nNow, we can analyze the frequency content of the signal. The frequency content is determined by the frequencies present in the function f(t). In this case, we have two frequencies:\n\n1. The first term, 3cos(2πt), has a frequency of 1 Hz (since 2πt has a period of 1 second).\n2. The second term, 2sin(4πt), has a frequency of 2 Hz (since 4πt has a period of 0.5 seconds).\n\nSo, the frequency content of the signal f(t) = 3cos(2πt) + 2sin(4πt) consists of two frequencies: 1 Hz and 2 Hz."
