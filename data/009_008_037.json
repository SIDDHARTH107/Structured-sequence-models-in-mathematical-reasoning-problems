    "message_2": "To find the frequency and period of the wave, we can use the wave velocity formula and the relationship between frequency and period.\n\nThe wave velocity formula is:\n\nv = f * λ\n\nwhere v is the wave velocity, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength.\n\nWe are given the wave velocity (v = 2 m/s) and the wavelength (λ = 1 m). We can solve for the frequency (f):\n\n2 m/s = f * 1 m\n\nf = 2 Hz\n\nNow that we have the frequency, we can find the period (T) using the relationship between frequency and period:\n\nT = 1/f\n\nT = 1/2 Hz\n\nT = 0.5 s\n\nSo, the frequency of the wave is 2 Hz, and the period of the wave is 0.5 seconds."
