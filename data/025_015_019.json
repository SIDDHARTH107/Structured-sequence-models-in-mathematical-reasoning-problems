    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the given point (1, 1, 0), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the surface equation with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nThe surface equation is:\n\n$F(x, y, z) = x^2 + 2y^2 - 3z^2 - 1 = 0$\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 4y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = -6z$\n\nNow, we evaluate the partial derivatives at the given point (1, 1, 0):\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(1, 1, 0) = 2(1) = 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(1, 1, 0) = 4(1) = 4$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z}(1, 1, 0) = -6(0) = 0$\n\nThe gradient vector at the point (1, 1, 0) is:\n\n$\\nabla F(1, 1, 0) = \\langle 2, 4, 0 \\rangle$\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent plane using the gradient vector and the given point. The equation of the tangent plane is given by:\n\n$(\\nabla F \\cdot \\langle x - x_0, y - y_0, z - z_0 \\rangle) = 0$\n\nPlugging in the gradient vector and the given point (1, 1, 0):\n\n$(\\langle 2, 4, 0 \\rangle \\cdot \\langle x - 1, y - 1, z - 0 \\rangle) = 0$\n\nExpanding the dot product:\n\n$2(x - 1) + 4(y - 1) + 0(z - 0) = 0$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$2x - 2 + 4y - 4 = 0$\n\n$2x + 4y = 6$\n\nThe equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (1, 1, 0) is:\n\n$x + 2y = 3$"
