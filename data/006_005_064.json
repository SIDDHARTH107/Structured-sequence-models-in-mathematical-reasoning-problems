    "message_2": "To find the probability of no car accidents in a week, we need to find the probability of no car accidents occurring on each day of the week and then multiply those probabilities together.\n\nThe probability of no car accident occurring on a given day is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the probability of no car accidents occurring on each day together:\n\n0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.98^7 â‰ˆ 0.9135\n\nSo, the probability of no car accidents occurring in a week is approximately 0.9135 or 91.35%."
