    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem related to Solving optimization problems using differential evolution that a math student can solve:\n\nA factory manufactures two products X and Y. The production process requires two raw materials A and B. The cost of producing X and Y is given below:\n\n- Cost of producing X = 3A + 4B\n- Cost of producing Y = 2A + 5B\n\nThe factory has a budget constraint of $2000 for the raw materials A and B. The factory wants to produce X and Y such that the total profit (revenue minus cost) is maximized. Determine the amount of raw materials A and B that should be used to produce X and Y to maximize the profit.\n\nUse differential evolution method to solve the problem. Assume that the profit for X and Y is $7 and $5 per unit respectively.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the differential evolution method, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and bounds for the variables.\n\nObjective function: Maximize the total profit\nTotal profit = 7 * X + 5 * Y - (3A + 4B) - (2A + 5B)\n\nConstraints:\n1. Budget constraint: 3A + 4B + 2A + 5B ≤ 2000\n2. Non-negativity constraint: A, B, X, Y ≥ 0\n\nBounds:\nA: [0, 2000]\nB: [0, 2000]\nX: [0, 2000]\nY: [0, 2000]\n\nNow, we can use the differential evolution method to find the optimal values for A, B, X, and Y that maximize the total profit. Here's a Python implementation using the `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import differential_evolution\n\ndef objective_function(variables):\n    A, B, X, Y = variables\n    profit = 7 * X + 5 * Y - (3 * A + 4 * B) - (2 * A + 5 * B)\n    return -profit  # Minimize the negative profit to maximize the profit\n\ndef budget_constraint(variables):\n    A, B, X, Y = variables\n    return 2000 - (3 * A + 4 * B + 2 * A + 5 * B)\n\nbounds = [(0, 2000), (0, 2000), (0, 2000), (0, 2000)]\n\nconstraints = {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': budget_constraint}\n\nresult = differential_evolution(objective_function, bounds, constraints=[constraints])\n\noptimal_A, optimal_B, optimal_X, optimal_Y = result.x\n\nprint(f\"Optimal A: {optimal_A}\")\nprint(f\"Optimal B: {optimal_B}\")\nprint(f\"Optimal X: {optimal_X}\")\nprint(f\"Optimal Y: {optimal_Y}\")\n```\n\nNote that the differential evolution method is a global optimization method, and it might not always find the exact optimal solution. However, it should provide a good approximation of the optimal values for A, B, X, and Y that maximize the total profit."
