    "message_2": "To solve this system of congruences, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let's denote the given congruences as follows:\n\n1. x ≡ a1 (mod m1) => x ≡ 3 (mod 4)\n2. x ≡ a2 (mod m2) => x ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n3. x ≡ a3 (mod m3) => x ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\nAccording to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can find a unique solution for x modulo M, where M = m1 * m2 * m3 = 4 * 5 * 7 = 140.\n\nNow, we need to find the constants M1, M2, and M3, where Mi = M / mi:\n\n1. M1 = M / m1 = 140 / 4 = 35\n2. M2 = M / m2 = 140 / 5 = 28\n3. M3 = M / m3 = 140 / 7 = 20\n\nNext, we need to find the inverse of each Mi modulo mi. Let's denote these inverses as y1, y2, and y3:\n\n1. y1 ≡ M1^(-1) (mod m1) => y1 ≡ 35^(-1) (mod 4)\n2. y2 ≡ M2^(-1) (mod m2) => y2 ≡ 28^(-1) (mod 5)\n3. y3 ≡ M3^(-1) (mod m3) => y3 ≡ 20^(-1) (mod 7)\n\nCalculating the inverses:\n\n1. 35 ≡ 3 (mod 4), so y1 = 3\n2. 28 ≡ 3 (mod 5), so y2 = 3\n3. 20 ≡ 6 (mod 7), so y3 = 6\n\nNow, we can find the solution for x:\n\nx = a1 * M1 * y1 + a2 * M2 * y2 + a3 * M3 * y3\n\nx = 3 * 35 * 3 + 1 * 28 * 3 + 5 * 20 * 6\nx = 315 + 84 + 600\nx = 999\n\nSince we want the smallest positive integer value of x, we can take x modulo M:\n\nx = 999 (mod 140)\nx = 39\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer value of x that satisfies all three congruences is 39."
