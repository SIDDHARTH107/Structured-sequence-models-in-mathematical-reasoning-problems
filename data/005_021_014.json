    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean using the bootstrapping method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples from the original sample.\n2. Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample.\n3. Order the bootstrap sample means.\n4. Find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the bootstrap sample means. These percentiles will give us the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nSince we don't have the actual data, we can't perform the bootstrapping method directly. However, we can provide a general formula for the confidence interval based on the given information.\n\nGiven that the sample mean (x̄) is 25 and the standard deviation (s) is 5, and the sample size (n) is 100, we can calculate the standard error (SE) as follows:\n\nSE = s / √n\nSE = 5 / √100\nSE = 5 / 10\nSE = 0.5\n\nNow, to find the 95% confidence interval, we need to find the critical value (z) for a 95% confidence level. For a 95% confidence level, the critical value (z) is approximately 1.96.\n\nLower bound of the confidence interval = x̄ - z * SE\nLower bound = 25 - 1.96 * 0.5\nLower bound = 25 - 0.98\nLower bound ≈ 24.02\n\nUpper bound of the confidence interval = x̄ + z * SE\nUpper bound = 25 + 1.96 * 0.5\nUpper bound = 25 + 0.98\nUpper bound ≈ 25.98\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean using the bootstrapping method is approximately (24.02, 25.98)."
