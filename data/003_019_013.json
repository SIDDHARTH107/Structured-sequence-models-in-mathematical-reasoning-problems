    "message_2": "To find the definite integral, we first need to find the antiderivative of the given function. Let's find the antiderivative of each term separately:\n\n1. Antiderivative of 5sin(x):\n∫(5sin(x) dx) = -5cos(x) + C₁\n\n2. Antiderivative of -2cos(2x):\n∫(-2cos(2x) dx) = -∫(2cos(2x) d(2x)) (using substitution: u = 2x, du = 2 dx)\n= -∫(cos(u) du)\n= -sin(u) + C₂\n= -sin(2x) + C₂ (substituting back u = 2x)\n\n3. Antiderivative of 3:\n∫(3 dx) = 3x + C₃\n\nNow, let's combine the antiderivatives:\n∫(5sin(x) - 2cos(2x) + 3 dx) = -5cos(x) - sin(2x) + 3x + C\n\nNow, we need to find the definite integral between x = π/2 and x = π/3:\n∫[π/2, π/3] (5sin(x) - 2cos(2x) + 3 dx) = (-5cos(x) - sin(2x) + 3x) | [π/2, π/3]\n\nNow, let's evaluate the antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\nAt x = π/2:\n-5cos(π/2) - sin(2(π/2)) + 3(π/2) = -5(0) - sin(π) + 3(π/2) = 0 - 0 + (3π/2) = (3π/2)\n\nAt x = π/3:\n-5cos(π/3) - sin(2(π/3)) + 3(π/3) = -5(1/2) - sin(2π/3) + π = -5/2 - (√3/2) + π\n\nNow, let's subtract the values:\n(3π/2) - (-5/2 - (√3/2) + π) = 3π/2 + 5/2 + √3/2 - π\n\nCombining the terms:\n(3π/2 - π) + (5/2 + √3/2) = (π/2) + (5 + √3)/2\n\nSo, the value of the definite integral between x = π/2 and x = π/3 is:\n(π/2) + (5 + √3)/2"
