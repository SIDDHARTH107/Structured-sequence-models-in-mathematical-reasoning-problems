    "message_1": "A rectangular plate made of a certain metal has dimensions of $4 \\text{ m} \\times 3 \\text{ m}$. The temperature distribution on the plate is given by $T(x,y) = 100\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{4}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{3}\\right)$, where $T$ is measured in degrees Celsius and $x$ and $y$ are the horizontal and vertical distances from the bottom left corner of the plate, respectively. Using the Fourier transform, determine the maximum and minimum temperatures on the plate.",
    "message_2": "In this problem, we don't actually need to use the Fourier transform to find the maximum and minimum temperatures on the plate. Instead, we can use basic calculus to find the critical points of the temperature function.\n\nThe temperature function is given by:\n$$T(x,y) = 100\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{4}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{3}\\right)$$\n\nTo find the critical points, we need to find the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ and set them equal to zero:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = 100\\cdot\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{4}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{3}\\right) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = 100\\cdot\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{4}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{3}\\right) = 0$$\n\nFrom the first equation, we have either $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{4}\\right) = 0$ or $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{3}\\right) = 0$. Similarly, from the second equation, we have either $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{4}\\right) = 0$ or $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{3}\\right) = 0$.\n\nSolving these equations, we find that the critical points occur at the intersections of the following points:\n$$x = 0, 2, 4$$\n$$y = 0, 3$$\n\nNow, we can evaluate the temperature function at these critical points:\n\n1. $(x, y) = (0, 0)$: $T(0, 0) = 0$\n2. $(x, y) = (2, 0)$: $T(2, 0) = 0$\n3. $(x, y) = (4, 0)$: $T(4, 0) = 0$\n4. $(x, y) = (0, 3)$: $T(0, 3) = 0$\n5. $(x, y) = (2, 3)$: $T(2, 3) = 100\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi \\cdot 2}{4}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi \\cdot 3}{3}\\right) = 100$\n6. $(x, y) = (4, 3)$: $T(4, 3) = 0$\n\nFrom these evaluations, we can see that the minimum temperature on the plate is $0^\\circ$C and the maximum temperature is $100^\\circ$C."
