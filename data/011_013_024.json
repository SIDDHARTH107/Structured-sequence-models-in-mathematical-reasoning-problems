    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Polya Enumeration Theorem (PET), which is a combinatorial method for counting objects under symmetry.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cyclic group C_n, which represents rotations. There are 20 rotations in total (including the identity rotation). We will use the cycle index polynomial for the cyclic group:\n\nP_C20 = (1/20) * (x1^20 + 2x2^10 + 4x4^5 + 5x5^4 + 10x10^2 + 20x20)\n\nNow, let's consider the dihedral group D_n, which represents reflections. There are 10 reflections in total. We will use the cycle index polynomial for the dihedral group:\n\nP_D20 = (1/2) * P_C20 + (1/2) * (x1^10x2^5 + 10x2^10)\n\nNow, we will substitute x_i^j with (b^j + w^j), where b represents black beads and w represents white beads:\n\nP_D20(b, w) = (1/2) * (b^20 + w^20 + 2(b^10 + w^10)^2 + 4(b^4 + w^4)^5 + 5(b^5 + w^5)^4 + 10(b^10 + w^10)^2 + 20(b^20 + w^20)) + (1/2) * ((b^10 + w^10)(b^5 + w^5) + 10(b^10 + w^10)^2)\n\nNow, we will expand and simplify the polynomial to find the coefficient of the term b^10w^10, which represents the number of distinct bracelets with 10 black and 10 white beads:\n\nP_D20(b, w) = (1/2) * (b^20 + w^20 + 2b^20 + 2w^20 + 4b^20 + 4w^20 + 5b^20 + 5w^20 + 10b^20 + 10w^20 + 20b^20 + 20w^20) + (1/2) * (b^15w^5 + b^5w^15 + 10b^20 + 10w^20)\n\nP_D20(b, w) = b^20 + w^20 + b^20 + w^20 + 2b^20 + 2w^20 + 2b^20 + 2w^20 + 5b^20 + 5w^20 + 10b^20 + 10w^20 + 10b^20 + 10w^20\n\nP_D20(b, w) = 41b^20 + 41w^20 + b^15w^5 + b^5w^15\n\nThe coefficient of the term b^10w^10 is 0, which means there are no distinct bracelets that can be made using 10 black and 10 white beads under rotation and reflection."
