    "message_1": "Consider a block design with 7 blocks and 3 items per block. If each item appears in exactly 4 blocks, how many items are there in total?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the total number of items as n. Since each item appears in exactly 4 blocks, we can say that the total number of appearances of all items is 4n. On the other hand, there are 7 blocks with 3 items per block, which means there are 7 * 3 = 21 appearances of items in total.\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n\n4n = 21\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nn = 21 / 4\n\nSince n must be an integer, we can round up the result to the nearest integer:\n\nn = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 items in total."
