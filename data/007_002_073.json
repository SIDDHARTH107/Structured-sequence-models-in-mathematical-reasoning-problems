    "message_2": "To find the largest three-digit number that is divisible by both 7 and 11, we first need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 11. \n\nThe LCM of 7 and 11 is 7 × 11 = 77.\n\nNow, we need to find the largest three-digit multiple of 77. To do this, divide 1000 (the smallest four-digit number) by 77:\n\n1000 ÷ 77 ≈ 12.98\n\nSince we need the largest three-digit multiple, we round down to 12. Now, multiply 12 by 77:\n\n12 × 77 = 924\n\nSo, the largest three-digit number that is divisible by both 7 and 11 is 924."
