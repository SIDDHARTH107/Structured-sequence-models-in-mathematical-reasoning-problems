    "message_1": "Consider a simple optimal control problem: you have a car that needs to travel a certain distance of 100 km. There is a time limit of 2 hours for completing the task. Your car travels faster on highways than on local roads, but it also consumes more fuel. On highways, your car can travel at a speed of 100 km/h and consumes 1 liter of fuel for every 10 km. On local roads, your car can travel at a speed of 60 km/h and consumes 1 liter of fuel for every 7 km. What is the optimal strategy for driving the car to minimize the fuel consumption while completing the task within the given time limit of 2 hours?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance traveled on the highway as x km and the distance traveled on local roads as y km. We have two constraints:\n\n1. The total distance traveled should be 100 km: x + y = 100\n2. The total time taken should be less than or equal to 2 hours: x/100 + y/60 ≤ 2\n\nWe need to minimize the fuel consumption, which can be represented as the objective function:\n\nFuel consumption = (x/10) + (y/7)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy the constraints and minimize the fuel consumption.\n\nFirst, let's solve the distance constraint for y:\n\ny = 100 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the time constraint:\n\nx/100 + (100 - x)/60 ≤ 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 300 (the least common multiple of 100 and 60) to get rid of the fractions:\n\n3x + 5(100 - x) ≤ 600\n\n3x + 500 - 5x ≤ 600\n\n-2x ≤ 100\n\nx ≥ 50\n\nSince x represents the distance traveled on the highway, the minimum distance we need to travel on the highway is 50 km. Now, let's find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny = 100 - x = 100 - 50 = 50\n\nSo, the optimal strategy is to travel 50 km on the highway and 50 km on local roads. Now let's calculate the fuel consumption for this strategy:\n\nFuel consumption = (50/10) + (50/7) = 5 + 50/7 ≈ 5 + 7.14 = 12.14 liters\n\nThus, the optimal strategy to minimize fuel consumption while completing the task within the given time limit is to travel 50 km on the highway and 50 km on local roads, with a total fuel consumption of approximately 12.14 liters."
