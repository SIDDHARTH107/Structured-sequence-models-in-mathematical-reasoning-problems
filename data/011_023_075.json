    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors required to color a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is determined by the chromatic number of the graph. The chromatic number depends on the structure of the graph.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the graph with six vertices is a complete graph, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the chromatic number is equal to the number of vertices, which is 6.\n\nHowever, if the graph is not a complete graph, the chromatic number could be lower. For example, if the graph is a cycle with an even number of vertices (like a hexagon), the chromatic number is 2, as you can color the vertices with alternating colors.\n\nIn general, without more information about the structure of the graph, it is impossible to determine the exact minimum number of colors required. However, we can say that the minimum number of colors required will be between 2 and 6, inclusive."
