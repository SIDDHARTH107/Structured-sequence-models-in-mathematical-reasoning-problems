    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 2x² - 5x + 3 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 2, b = -5, and c = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (5 ± √((-5)² - 4(2)(3))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 4\n\nx = (5 ± √1) / 4\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (5 + 1) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 3 / 2\n\nx = (5 - 1) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1\n\nSo, the solutions to the quadratic equation 2x² - 5x + 3 = 0 are x = 3/2 and x = 1."
