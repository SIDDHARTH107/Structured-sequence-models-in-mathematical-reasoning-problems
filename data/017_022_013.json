    "message_2": "To determine the conjugacy classes of a non-abelian group of order 60, we can use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a non-abelian group of order 60. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. \n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) divides 12 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 6. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 20 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1, 4, and 10. Finally, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) divides 15 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, and 15.\n\nNow, we can use the information about the Sylow subgroups to determine the conjugacy classes of G. If G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, then it is normal, and G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is also normal. In this case, G would be a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which would make it abelian. Since G is non-abelian, this case is not possible.\n\nIf G has 6 Sylow 5-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, then G is isomorphic to the alternating group A_5, which has conjugacy classes of sizes 1, 15, 20, 12, and 12. \n\nIf G has 6 Sylow 5-subgroups and 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, then G is isomorphic to the projective special linear group PSL(2,5), which has conjugacy classes of sizes 1, 15, 20, 6, 6, 6, and 6.\n\nIf G has 6 Sylow 5-subgroups and 1 Sylow 3-subgroup, then G is isomorphic to the holomorph of the cyclic group of order 5, which has conjugacy classes of sizes 1, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, and 4.\n\nKnowledge of the conjugacy classes can help determine which of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60 a given group is isomorphic to by comparing the sizes of the conjugacy classes. If the sizes of the conjugacy classes of a given group match one of the cases above, then the group is isomorphic to the corresponding group."
