    "message_2": "Given a right-angled triangle ABC with angle A = 30° and side AB = 5 cm, we can find the trigonometric ratios sin A, cos A, and tan A using the definitions of these ratios in terms of the sides of the triangle.\n\nFirst, let's denote the sides of the triangle as follows:\n- Side AB is opposite angle C and adjacent to angle A, so we'll call it the adjacent side (adj).\n- Side AC is opposite angle A and adjacent to angle C, so we'll call it the opposite side (opp).\n- Side BC is the hypotenuse (hyp).\n\nSince we know angle A and the adjacent side, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle to find the other sides. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side lengths are in the ratio 1:√3:2, where the side opposite the 30° angle is the shortest side (opp), the side opposite the 60° angle is the middle side (adj), and the hypotenuse is the longest side (hyp).\n\nWe are given that the adjacent side (AB) is 5 cm. To find the other sides, we can use the ratios:\n\nopp/adj = 1/√3\nopp = (1/√3) * adj\nopp = (1/√3) * 5\nopp = 5/√3\nopp ≈ 2.886751 cm\n\nhyp/adj = 2/1\nhyp = 2 * adj\nhyp = 2 * 5\nhyp = 10 cm\n\nNow that we have all the side lengths, we can find the trigonometric ratios:\n\nsin A = opp/hyp\nsin 30° = (5/√3) / 10\nsin 30° = 1/2\n\ncos A = adj/hyp\ncos 30° = 5 / 10\ncos 30° = 1/2\n\ntan A = opp/adj\ntan 30° = (5/√3) / 5\ntan 30° = 1/√3\ntan 30° ≈ 0.577350\n\nSo, the trigonometric ratios for angle A are:\nsin A = sin 30° ≈ 1/2\ncos A = cos 30° ≈ 1/2\ntan A = tan 30° ≈ 0.577350"
