    "message_1": "A wave traveling in a cable is described by the function f(x) = 5cos(8πx), where x is the distance along the cable. What is the wavelength and frequency of this wave? Use the Fourier transform to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "The given function is f(x) = 5cos(8πx). This is a cosine function, and we can identify the angular frequency (ω) and amplitude (A) directly from the function.\n\nA = 5 (amplitude)\nω = 8π (angular frequency)\n\nThe angular frequency (ω) is related to the frequency (f) by the equation:\n\nω = 2πf\n\nSolving for the frequency (f):\n\nf = ω / (2π) = (8π) / (2π) = 4 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the wave is 4 Hz.\n\nThe wavelength (λ) is related to the frequency (f) and the speed of the wave (v) by the equation:\n\nv = fλ\n\nIn this problem, we are not given the speed of the wave (v). However, we can find the relationship between the wavelength and the angular frequency using the equation:\n\nω = 2π / λ\n\nSolving for the wavelength (λ):\n\nλ = 2π / ω = 2π / (8π) = 1/4\n\nThe wavelength of the wave is 1/4 units.\n\nIn summary, the frequency of the wave is 4 Hz, and the wavelength is 1/4 units. Note that without the speed of the wave, we cannot determine the exact value of the wavelength in terms of distance."
