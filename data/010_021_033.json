Let $S$ be the 2-sphere of radius $1$ centered at the origin, given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1$.

    "message_2": "To determine whether $S$ is a symplectic submanifold of $(\\mathbb{R}^4,\\omega)$, we need to check two conditions:\n\n1. $S$ is a submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n2. The restriction of $\\omega$ to $S$ is non-degenerate.\n\nFirst, let's check if $S$ is a submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^4$. The equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1$ defines a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{R}^4$, and its gradient $\\nabla F = (2x, 2y, 2z, 2w)$ is non-zero for all points on $S$. Therefore, $S$ is a submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\nNow, let's check if the restriction of $\\omega$ to $S$ is non-degenerate. Since $S$ is a 2-dimensional submanifold, we need to show that the pullback of $\\omega$ to the tangent space of $S$ at each point is non-degenerate.\n\nLet $p \\in S$ and let $T_pS$ denote the tangent space of $S$ at $p$. Let $v, w \\in T_pS$ be arbitrary tangent vectors. Since $v, w$ are tangent to $S$, we have $\\nabla F \\cdot v = \\nabla F \\cdot w = 0$. Now, consider the pullback of $\\omega$ to $T_pS$:\n\n$(\\omega|_S)_p(v, w) = \\omega_p(v, w) = v^1 w^2 - v^2 w^1 + v^3 w^4 - v^4 w^3$.\n\nSince $v$ and $w$ are orthogonal to $\\nabla F$, we can choose a basis for $T_pS$ such that $v = (v^1, v^2, 0, 0)$ and $w = (0, 0, w^3, w^4)$. Then,\n\n$(\\omega|_S)_p(v, w) = v^1 w^2 - v^2 w^1 + v^3 w^4 - v^4 w^3 = 0$.\n\nThis shows that the restriction of $\\omega$ to $S$ is degenerate, and therefore, $S$ is not a symplectic submanifold of $(\\mathbb{R}^4,\\omega)$."
