    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 36 and 48 using Euclid's algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (48) by the smaller number (36) and find the remainder.\n48 รท 36 = 1 with a remainder of 12.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (48) with the smaller number (36) and the smaller number with the remainder (12).\nNow, we need to find the GCD of 36 and 12.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (36) by the smaller number (12) and find the remainder.\n36 รท 12 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 12.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of 36 and 48 is 12."
