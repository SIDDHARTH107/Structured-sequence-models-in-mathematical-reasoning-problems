    "message_2": "To find the value of x such that 3^x is congruent to 7 (mod 11), we can use trial and error to find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the equation.\n\nLet's start by calculating the powers of 3 modulo 11:\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n3^3 ≡ 27 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n3^4 ≡ 81 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n3^5 ≡ 243 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nNow, we can see that 3^5 ≡ 1 (mod 11). This means that 3^x will repeat its cycle every 5 powers. So, we can continue our search for the value of x:\n\n3^6 ≡ 3^1 * 3^5 ≡ 3 * 1 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n3^7 ≡ 3^2 * 3^5 ≡ 9 * 1 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n3^8 ≡ 3^3 * 3^5 ≡ 5 * 1 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n3^9 ≡ 3^4 * 3^5 ≡ 4 * 1 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n3^10 ≡ 3^5 * 3^5 ≡ 1 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nWe can see that 3^x is congruent to 7 (mod 11) when x = 7. Therefore, the value of x is 7."
