    "message_2": "To find the number of patients who would test positive for the condition, we can multiply the total number of patients with the symptoms by the probability of testing positive.\n\nNumber of patients with symptoms = 500\nProbability of testing positive = 25% = 0.25\n\nNumber of patients who would test positive = 500 * 0.25 = 125 patients"
