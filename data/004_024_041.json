Find the derivative of y with respect to x when x = 1.\n\nHint: To differentiate an implicitly defined function involving both x and y, you will need to use the chain rule.",
    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we will differentiate the given equation implicitly with respect to x. \n\nGiven equation: x^2 + xy + y^2 = 5\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\n2x + y + x(dy/dx) + 2y(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx * (x + 2y) = -2x - y\n\ndy/dx = (-2x - y) / (x + 2y)\n\nWe are asked to find the derivative when x = 1. To do this, we need to find the corresponding value of y when x = 1. We can plug x = 1 back into the original equation:\n\n(1)^2 + (1)y + y^2 = 5\n\n1 + y + y^2 = 5\n\ny^2 + y - 4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for y using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\ny = (-1 ± √(1^2 - 4(1)(-4))) / 2(1)\n\ny = (-1 ± √17) / 2\n\nThere are two possible values for y: y1 = (-1 + √17) / 2 and y2 = (-1 - √17) / 2. We will find the derivative for both values of y.\n\nFor y1:\n\ndy/dx = (-2(1) - ((-1 + √17) / 2)) / (1 + 2((-1 + √17) / 2))\n\ndy/dx = (-2 - (-1 + √17) / 2) / (1 - 1 + √17)\n\ndy/dx = (1 - √17) / (√17)\n\nFor y2:\n\ndy/dx = (-2(1) - ((-1 - √17) / 2)) / (1 + 2((-1 - √17) / 2))\n\ndy/dx = (-2 - (-1 - √17) / 2) / (1 - 1 - √17)\n\ndy/dx = (1 + √17) / (-√17)\n\nSo, there are two possible values for the derivative of y with respect to x when x = 1: dy/dx = (1 - √17) / (√17) and dy/dx = (1 + √17) / (-√17)."
