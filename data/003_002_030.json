    "message_2": "In a triangle, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees. Since we are given two angles, 30 degrees and 60 degrees, we can find the third angle:\n\n180 - 30 - 60 = 90 degrees\n\nNow we have a right-angled triangle with angles 30, 60, and 90 degrees. We can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle to find the values of sin(30), cos(60), and tan(30).\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2, where the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 1, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is √3, and the hypotenuse is 2.\n\nNow we can find the trigonometric ratios:\n\nsin(30) = opposite side / hypotenuse = 1 / 2 ≈ 0.50\n\ncos(60) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = 1 / 2 ≈ 0.50\n\ntan(30) = opposite side / adjacent side = 1 / √3 ≈ 0.58\n\nSo, sin(30) ≈ 0.50, cos(60) ≈ 0.50, and tan(30) ≈ 0.58."
