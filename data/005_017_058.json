    "message_2": "To calculate the principal components for these exam scores, we need the actual data values for the 50 students across the 6 subjects. Since the data is not provided, I will explain the general steps to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and how to determine the percentage of total variation that each principal component explains.\n\n1. Standardize the data: Since the exam scores might be on different scales, it's important to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each subject.\n\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix: The covariance matrix helps to understand the linear relationship between the subjects. It is a square matrix of size 6x6 (since there are 6 subjects).\n\n3. Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix: Eigenvectors represent the direction of the principal components, while eigenvalues represent the magnitude of the principal components. There will be 6 eigenvectors and eigenvalues since there are 6 subjects.\n\n4. Sort the eigenvectors by their corresponding eigenvalues in descending order: The eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue is the first principal component, the one with the second-highest eigenvalue is the second principal component, and so on.\n\n5. Calculate the percentage of total variation that each principal component explains: To do this, divide each eigenvalue by the sum of all eigenvalues and multiply by 100. This will give you the percentage of total variation explained by each principal component.\n\nFor example, let's say the eigenvalues are λ1, λ2, λ3, λ4, λ5, and λ6. The sum of all eigenvalues is Σλ = λ1 + λ2 + λ3 + λ4 + λ5 + λ6. The percentage of total variation explained by each principal component is as follows:\n\n- PC1: (λ1 / Σλ) * 100\n- PC2: (λ2 / Σλ) * 100\n- PC3: (λ3 / Σλ) * 100\n- PC4: (λ4 / Σλ) * 100\n- PC5: (λ5 / Σλ) * 100\n- PC6: (λ6 / Σλ) * 100\n\nThese percentages will help you understand how much each principal component contributes to the total variation in the dataset. The first few principal components usually explain a significant portion of the total variation, and you can use them for dimensionality reduction or other analyses."
