    "message_1": "A radioactive substance has a half-life of 10 years. If the initial amount of the substance was 500 grams, find the amount of substance that remains after 30 years.",
    "message_2": "To find the amount of substance remaining after 30 years, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 500 grams, the time elapsed is 30 years, and the half-life is 10 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 500 * (1/2)^(30 / 10)\nFinal amount = 500 * (1/2)^3\nFinal amount = 500 * (1/8)\nFinal amount = 62.5 grams\n\nSo, after 30 years, 62.5 grams of the radioactive substance will remain."
