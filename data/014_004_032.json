    "message_1": "What is the public key of an elliptic curve cryptography system with the private key 5, and the generator point (2, 1) on the curve y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 over the field of integers modulo 11?",
    "message_2": "To find the public key, we need to perform scalar multiplication of the generator point (G) by the private key (k). In this case, G = (2, 1) and k = 5. The curve equation is y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 (mod 11).\n\nScalar multiplication involves repeated point addition on the elliptic curve. We will perform point doubling and point addition to find the result.\n\n1. Point doubling (2 * G):\n   - For point doubling, we use the formula λ = (3x1^2 + a) / 2y1 (mod p) and x3 = λ^2 - 2x1 (mod p), y3 = λ(x1 - x3) - y1 (mod p).\n   - In this case, x1 = 2, y1 = 1, a = 5, and p = 11.\n   - λ = (3(2)^2 + 5) / 2(1) = (12 + 5) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8 (mod 11).\n   - x3 = 8^2 - 2(2) = 64 - 4 = 60 = 6 (mod 11).\n   - y3 = 8(2 - 6) - 1 = -24 - 1 = -25 = 9 (mod 11).\n   - So, 2 * G = (6, 9).\n\n2. Point addition (2 * G + G = 3 * G):\n   - For point addition, we use the formula λ = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) (mod p) and x3 = λ^2 - x1 - x2 (mod p), y3 = λ(x1 - x3) - y1 (mod p).\n   - In this case, x1 = 2, y1 = 1, x2 = 6, y2 = 9, and p = 11.\n   - λ = (9 - 1) / (6 - 2) = 8 / 4 = 2 (mod 11).\n   - x3 = 2^2 - 2 - 6 = 4 - 8 = -4 = 7 (mod 11).\n   - y3 = 2(2 - 7) - 1 = -10 - 1 = -11 = 0 (mod 11).\n   - So, 3 * G = (7, 0).\n\n3. Point addition (3 * G + G = 4 * G):\n   - λ = (0 - 1) / (7 - 2) = -1 / 5 = 9 (mod 11) (since 9 * 5 = 45 = 1 (mod 11)).\n   - x3 = 9^2 - 2 - 7 = 81 - 9 = 72 = 6 (mod 11).\n   - y3 = 9(2 - 6) - 1 = -36 - 1 = -37 = 7 (mod 11).\n   - So, 4 * G = (6, 7).\n\n4. Point addition (4 * G + G = 5 * G = Public Key):\n   - λ = (1 - 7) / (2 - 6) = -6 / -4 = 3 / 2 = 7 (mod 11) (since 7 * 2 = 14 = 1 (mod 11)).\n   - x3 = 7^2 - 2 - 6 = 49 - 8 = 41 = 8 (mod 11).\n   - y3 = 7(2 - 8) - 1 = -42 - 1 = -43 = 6 (mod 11).\n   - So, 5 * G = (8, 6).\n\nThe public key is the result of the scalar multiplication, which is (8, 6)."
