    "message_2": "To find the third angle of a triangle using the Law of Cosines, we first need to identify which angle we want to find. Let's call the angle opposite the side with length 10 as angle C. The triangle sides are a = 6, b = 8, and c = 10.\n\nThe Law of Cosines formula is:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for angle C:\n\ncos(C) = (a² + b² - c²) / (2ab)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of the sides:\n\ncos(C) = (6² + 8² - 10²) / (2 * 6 * 8)\ncos(C) = (36 + 64 - 100) / (96)\ncos(C) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the angle whose cosine is 0. Using the inverse cosine function (also known as arccos or cos^(-1)):\n\nC = arccos(0)\nC = 90°\n\nSo, the third angle of the triangle is 90°."
