    "message_2": "To compute the De Rham cohomology of the quotient manifold M/[1,2], we will use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. Let U be an open set containing the submanifold [1,2] and V be an open set such that M = U ∪ V. Then, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the De Rham cohomology is given by:\n\n... → H^k(U ∩ V) → H^k(U) ⊕ H^k(V) → H^k(M) → H^(k+1)(U ∩ V) → ...\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information. We have a manifold M with De Rham cohomology [0,1], which means that H^0(M) = ℝ and H^1(M) = ℝ. The submanifold [1,2] has De Rham cohomology [0,1], so H^0([1,2]) = ℝ and H^1([1,2]) = ℝ.\n\nSince [1,2] is a submanifold of M, we can choose U = M and V to be an open neighborhood of [1,2] such that V deformation retracts onto [1,2]. Then, U ∩ V = V, and we have the following Mayer-Vietoris sequence:\n\n... → H^k(V) → H^k(M) ⊕ H^k(V) → H^k(M/[1,2]) → H^(k+1)(V) → ...\n\nFor k = 0, we have:\n\n... → H^0(V) → H^0(M) ⊕ H^0(V) → H^0(M/[1,2]) → H^1(V) → ...\n\nSince H^0(M) = ℝ and H^0([1,2]) = ℝ, we have H^0(V) = ℝ. Thus, the sequence becomes:\n\n... → ℝ → ℝ ⊕ ℝ → H^0(M/[1,2]) → H^1(V) → ...\n\nThe map ℝ → ℝ ⊕ ℝ is the diagonal map, and its image is the diagonal in ℝ ⊕ ℝ. Therefore, the kernel of the map ℝ ⊕ ℝ → H^0(M/[1,2]) is the diagonal, and so H^0(M/[1,2]) = ℝ.\n\nFor k = 1, we have:\n\n... → H^1(V) → H^1(M) ⊕ H^1(V) → H^1(M/[1,2]) → H^2(V) → ...\n\nSince H^1(M) = ℝ and H^1([1,2]) = ℝ, we have H^1(V) = ℝ. Thus, the sequence becomes:\n\n... → ℝ → ℝ ⊕ ℝ → H^1(M/[1,2]) → H^2(V) → ...\n\nThe map ℝ → ℝ ⊕ ℝ is again the diagonal map. Since the kernel of this map is trivial, the map ℝ ⊕ ℝ → H^1(M/[1,2]) is injective. Therefore, H^1(M/[1,2]) = ℝ ⊕ ℝ.\n\nFor k ≥ 2, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence gives us:\n\n... → H^k(V) → H^k(M) ⊕ H^k(V) → H^k(M/[1,2]) → H^(k+1)(V) → ...\n\nSince H^k(M) = 0 for k ≥ 2 and H^k([1,2]) = 0 for k ≥ 2, we have H^k(V) = 0 for k ≥ 2. Thus, the sequence becomes:\n\n... → 0 → 0 ⊕ 0 → H^k(M/[1,2]) → 0 → ...\n\nThis implies that H^k(M/[1,2]) = 0 for k ≥ 2.\n\nIn conclusion, the De Rham cohomology of the quotient manifold M/[1,2] is given by:\n\nH^0(M/[1,2]) = ℝ,\nH^1(M/[1,2]) = ℝ ⊕ ℝ,\nH^k(M/[1,2]) = 0 for k ≥ 2."
