    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and M is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, at each iteration, the curve is divided into 4 self-similar pieces (N = 4), and each piece is 1/3 the length of the previous iteration (M = 3).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619"
