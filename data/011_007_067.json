    "message_2": "To find the number of different combinations, we can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of players in each position and k is the number of players to be selected from that position.\n\nFirst, let's find the combinations for each position:\n\n1. Forwards: C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6\n2. Midfielders: C(3, 3) = 3! / (3!(3-3)!) = 1\n3. Defenders: C(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = 3\n\nNow, to find the total number of combinations for the starting lineup, we multiply the combinations for each position:\n\nTotal combinations = 6 (forwards) * 1 (midfielders) * 3 (defenders) = 6 * 1 * 3 = 18\n\nSo, there are 18 different combinations the coach can choose to form his starting lineup."
