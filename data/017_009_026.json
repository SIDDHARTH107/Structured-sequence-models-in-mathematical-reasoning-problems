    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2), we can apply the following theorem:\n\nTheorem: If the order of a group G is p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer, then G has a normal subgroup of order p^k for each k, 0 ≤ k ≤ n.\n\nIn our case, p = 3 and n = 2. So, G has a normal subgroup of order 3. Let's call this subgroup H. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of H divides the order of G, which means that the index of H in G is [G : H] = 9/3 = 3.\n\nNow, we can apply another theorem:\n\nTheorem: If H is a normal subgroup of G with index [G : H] = n, then there exists a homomorphism φ: G → S_n with kernel Ker(φ) = H.\n\nIn our case, n = 3. So, there exists a homomorphism φ: G → S_3 with kernel Ker(φ) = H. Since H is a normal subgroup of order 3, it is isomorphic to C3 (the cyclic group of order 3). The group S_3 has order 6, and since 3 is the highest power of 3 dividing 6, S_3 has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is also normal.\n\nNow, consider the image of G under φ, which is a subgroup of S_3. Since the kernel of φ is H, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have G/H ≅ φ(G). Since G has order 9 and H has order 3, the order of G/H is 9/3 = 3. Thus, φ(G) is a subgroup of S_3 of order 3, which means that φ(G) is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of S_3 and is normal.\n\nSince φ(G) is normal in S_3 and isomorphic to G/H, we can conclude that G/H is abelian. Now, we use the following fact:\n\nFact: If G is a group and H is a normal subgroup of G such that G/H is abelian, then G' (the commutator subgroup of G) is a subgroup of H.\n\nIn our case, G' is a subgroup of H. Since H is isomorphic to C3, which is abelian, G' must also be abelian. But G' being abelian implies that G is abelian, as the commutator subgroup is a measure of the \"non-abelianness\" of a group.\n\nTherefore, G is an abelian group of order 9. The only abelian group of order 9 is the cyclic group C9, so G must be isomorphic to C9. We can conclude that G cannot be isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 9, as it is isomorphic to the abelian group C9."
