    "message_2": "To find the value of x for which arccos(x) = 0.5, we need to find the angle whose cosine is 0.5.\n\nRecall that the cosine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. In this case, we are looking for an angle whose cosine is 0.5, or:\n\ncos(angle) = 0.5\n\nThe angle that satisfies this condition is 60 degrees or π/3 radians. Therefore, the value of x for which arccos(x) = 0.5 is:\n\nx = cos(π/3) = 0.5"
