    "message_2": "To compute the order of the Jacobian of C, we first need to find the number of points on the curve C over the finite field F_7 (the field of integers modulo 7). We can do this by checking all possible combinations of x and y in F_7 and counting the number of points that satisfy the equation y^2 = x^3 + x^2 + 1.\n\nWe have the following table for the values of x^3 + x^2 + 1 modulo 7:\n\nx | x^3 + x^2 + 1 (mod 7)\n-------------------------\n0 | 1\n1 | 3\n2 | 2\n3 | 6\n4 | 6\n5 | 2\n6 | 3\n\nNow, we check for each value of x, which values of y satisfy the equation y^2 = x^3 + x^2 + 1 (mod 7):\n\nx = 0: y^2 = 1 (mod 7) => y = 1, 6 (2 solutions)\nx = 1: y^2 = 3 (mod 7) => no solutions\nx = 2: y^2 = 2 (mod 7) => no solutions\nx = 3: y^2 = 6 (mod 7) => y = 3, 4 (2 solutions)\nx = 4: y^2 = 6 (mod 7) => y = 3, 4 (2 solutions)\nx = 5: y^2 = 2 (mod 7) => no solutions\nx = 6: y^2 = 3 (mod 7) => no solutions\n\nWe have a total of 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 6 points on the curve C over F_7.\n\nNow, we need to add the point at infinity, which is always included in the Jacobian of an elliptic curve. Thus, the order of the Jacobian of C is 6 + 1 = 7."
