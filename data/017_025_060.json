    "message_1": "In a group of order 120, there are exactly 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. Determine the number of elements of order 3 in the group.",
    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 120, and let P be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. The order of P is 3, as 3 is the highest power of 3 dividing 120. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is congruent to 1 modulo 3 and divides 120/3 = 40. The only such number is 10, which is given in the problem.\n\nNow, each Sylow 3-subgroup P has order 3, and since 3 is prime, P is cyclic. Thus, P has exactly two elements of order 3 (all non-identity elements in P). Since there are 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, we might be tempted to say there are 10 * 2 = 20 elements of order 3 in G. However, we must be careful not to double-count elements that are in more than one Sylow 3-subgroup.\n\nLet's consider the intersection of two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups P and Q. If the intersection P ∩ Q has an element of order 3, then the intersection would have order 3 (since the only subgroups of a cyclic group of prime order are the trivial subgroup and the group itself). But this would mean P = Q, which contradicts our assumption that P and Q are distinct. Therefore, the intersection of any two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups contains only the identity element.\n\nThis means that each of the 10 Sylow 3-subgroups contributes exactly 2 unique elements of order 3 to G. So, there are a total of 10 * 2 = 20 elements of order 3 in the group G."
