    "message_1": "A control system requires that a signal be filtered such that only frequencies between 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz are allowed to pass through. The signal being filtered has a Fourier transform given by:\n\nF(ω) = 3π(δ(ω-1000) + δ(ω+1000) + δ(ω-2000) + δ(ω+2000))\n\nwhere δ represents the Dirac delta function. Determine the Fourier transform of the filtered signal after passing through the filter.",
    "message_2": "To determine the Fourier transform of the filtered signal, we need to consider the frequency range allowed by the filter. Since the filter only allows frequencies between 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz to pass through, we can represent the filter's frequency response as a rectangular function:\n\nH(ω) = rect((ω - 1500)/1000)\n\nwhere rect(x) is the rectangular function defined as:\n\nrect(x) = 1 if |x| ≤ 0.5\nrect(x) = 0 if |x| > 0.5\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of the filtered signal by multiplying the Fourier transform of the original signal F(ω) with the frequency response of the filter H(ω):\n\nG(ω) = F(ω) * H(ω)\n\nG(ω) = 3π(δ(ω-1000) + δ(ω+1000) + δ(ω-2000) + δ(ω+2000)) * rect((ω - 1500)/1000)\n\nNow, we can apply the filter to each of the delta functions in F(ω):\n\nG(ω) = 3π(δ(ω-1000) * rect((ω - 1500)/1000) + δ(ω+1000) * rect((ω - 1500)/1000) + δ(ω-2000) * rect((ω - 1500)/1000) + δ(ω+2000) * rect((ω - 1500)/1000))\n\nSince the rectangular function is zero outside the range of |x| ≤ 0.5, only the delta functions with frequencies between 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz will have a non-zero product with the rectangular function:\n\nG(ω) = 3π(δ(ω-1000) * rect((ω - 1500)/1000) + δ(ω-2000) * rect((ω - 1500)/1000))\n\nNow, we can evaluate the rectangular function for the frequencies of the delta functions:\n\nG(ω) = 3π(δ(ω-1000) * 1 + δ(ω-2000) * 0)\n\nG(ω) = 3πδ(ω-1000)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the filtered signal after passing through the filter is:\n\nG(ω) = 3πδ(ω-1000)"
