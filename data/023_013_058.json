The plate measures 1m x 1m.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution at time t=10 seconds, we need to solve the heat equation using the Fourier transform. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α(∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y²)\n\nwhere T(x,y,t) is the temperature distribution at time t, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x and y are the positions on the plate.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial temperature distribution in terms of Fourier series:\n\nT(x,y,0) = 20 + 100*sin(2πx)*cos(3πy)\n\nNow, we can represent T(x,y,t) as a Fourier series:\n\nT(x,y,t) = ∑∑[A(m,n)*sin(mπx)*cos(nπy)*e^(-α(m²+n²)π²t)]\n\nwhere A(m,n) are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nTo find A(m,n), we can use the orthogonality property of sine and cosine functions:\n\nA(m,n) = (4/(mnπ²)) * ∫∫[T(x,y,0)*sin(mπx)*cos(nπy) dx dy]\n\nFor m=2 and n=3, we have:\n\nA(2,3) = (4/(6π²)) * ∫∫[(20 + 100*sin(2πx)*cos(3πy))*sin(2πx)*cos(3πy) dx dy]\n\nSince the plate measures 1m x 1m, we integrate over the range [0,1] for both x and y:\n\nA(2,3) = (4/(6π²)) * ∫[∫[(20 + 100*sin(2πx)*cos(3πy))*sin(2πx)*cos(3πy) dx] dy]\n\nA(2,3) = (4/(6π²)) * ∫[20*∫[sin(2πx)*cos(3πy) dx] dy] + (4/(6π²)) * ∫[100*∫[sin²(2πx)*cos²(3πy) dx] dy]\n\nAfter evaluating the integrals, we find that:\n\nA(2,3) = 100/3\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution at time t=10 seconds:\n\nT(x,y,10) = 20 + A(2,3)*sin(2πx)*cos(3πy)*e^(-α(2²+3²)π²*10)\n\nT(x,y,10) = 20 + (100/3)*sin(2πx)*cos(3πy)*e^(-0.01*(13)π²*10)\n\nThis is the temperature distribution of the metal plate at time t=10 seconds."
