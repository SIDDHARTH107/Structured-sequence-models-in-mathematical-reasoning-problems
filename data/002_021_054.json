    "message_1": "What is the area of a sector that subtends an angle of 60 degrees in a circle with a radius of 10cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (angle/360) × π × r²\n\nwhere angle is the measure of the central angle in degrees, r is the radius of the circle, and π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the angle is 60 degrees and the radius is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (60/360) × π × 10²\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 100\n\nArea of sector = (100π)/6\n\nArea of sector ≈ 16.67π\n\nArea of sector ≈ 52.36 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the sector is approximately 52.36 cm²."
