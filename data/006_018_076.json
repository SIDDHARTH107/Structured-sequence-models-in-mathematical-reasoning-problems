    "message_1": "Suppose the probability of a certain type of financial fraud occurring in a company is 0.03, and there are 500 employees in the company. What is the probability that at least 15 employees are involved in the fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, employees involved in fraud) in n trials (the number of employees), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (the probability of an employee being involved in fraud), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (the probability of an employee not being involved in fraud).\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 15 employees being involved in fraud, so we need to find the probability of 15, 16, 17, ..., 500 employees being involved in fraud and sum those probabilities. Mathematically, this is represented as:\n\nP(X ≥ 15) = P(X = 15) + P(X = 16) + ... + P(X = 500)\n\nHowever, calculating this directly would be very time-consuming. Instead, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring. In this case, the event not occurring is that fewer than 15 employees are involved in fraud. So, we can calculate the probability of 0, 1, 2, ..., 14 employees being involved in fraud and subtract that from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 15) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 14)]\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 14 and sum them:\n\nSum = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 14)\n\nn = 500 (number of employees)\np = 0.03 (probability of an employee being involved in fraud)\n\nSum = Σ [C(500, k) * (0.03)^k * (0.97)^(500-k)] for k = 0 to 14\n\nAfter calculating the sum, we get:\n\nSum ≈ 0.9334\n\nNow, we can use the complement rule to find the probability of at least 15 employees being involved in fraud:\n\nP(X ≥ 15) = 1 - Sum ≈ 1 - 0.9334 ≈ 0.0666\n\nSo, the probability that at least 15 employees are involved in the fraud is approximately 0.0666 or 6.66%."
