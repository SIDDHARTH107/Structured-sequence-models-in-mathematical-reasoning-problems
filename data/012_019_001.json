    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of colors required to color the edges of G such that no two adjacent edges have the same color, we can use the concept of edge chromatic number. The edge chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the edges so that no two adjacent edges have the same color.\n\nAccording to Vizing's theorem, the edge chromatic number χ'(G) of a graph G is either its maximum degree Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1. In other words, Δ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the maximum degree Δ(G) of the graph. Since G has 10 vertices and 20 edges, the average degree of the graph is (2 * 20) / 10 = 4. This means that there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 4 or higher.\n\nNow, we can apply Vizing's theorem:\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nSince Δ(G) is at least 4, we have:\n\n4 ≤ χ'(G) ≤ 5\n\nWe cannot determine the exact value of χ'(G) without more information about the graph, but we know that the minimum number of colors required to color the edges of G such that no two adjacent edges have the same color is between 4 and 5, inclusive."
