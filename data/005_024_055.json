    "message_1": "A company has collected data on the number of monthly sales for the past 36 months for one of its products. The data is as follows:\n\n35, 36, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 73, 78, 80, 86, 90, 99.\n\nFind the median, mode, and range of the sales data.",
    "message_2": "To find the median, we first need to determine the middle value(s) in the dataset. Since there are 36 data points, the middle values are the 18th and 19th values. In this case, the 18th value is 58 and the 19th value is 59. To find the median, we take the average of these two values:\n\nMedian = (58 + 59) / 2 = 58.5\n\nTo find the mode, we need to determine which value(s) appear most frequently in the dataset. In this case, all values appear only once, so there is no mode.\n\nTo find the range, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value:\n\nRange = 99 - 35 = 64\n\nSo, the median is 58.5, there is no mode, and the range is 64."
