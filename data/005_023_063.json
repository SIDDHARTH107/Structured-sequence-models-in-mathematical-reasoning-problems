    "message_1": "A sample of 20 math test scores was taken, and the mean score was calculated as 75. However, upon examining the data, the teacher realized that one of the scores was incorrectly recorded as 40 instead of 90. What was the correct mean score for the 20 math test scores?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the sum of the original 20 test scores. We can do this by multiplying the mean by the number of scores:\n\nMean = Sum of scores / Number of scores\n75 = Sum of scores / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for the sum of scores:\n\nSum of scores = 75 * 20 = 1500\n\nNext, we need to correct the error in the data. We do this by removing the incorrect score (40) and adding the correct score (90):\n\nCorrected sum of scores = 1500 - 40 + 90 = 1460\n\nFinally, we can find the corrected mean by dividing the corrected sum of scores by the number of scores:\n\nCorrected mean = Corrected sum of scores / Number of scores\nCorrected mean = 1460 / 20 = 73\n\nThe correct mean score for the 20 math test scores is 73."
