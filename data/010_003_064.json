    "message_2": "If every subset containing exactly two points can be separated by open sets in a topological space X, then X satisfies the T1 separation axiom (also known as the Frechet space). \n\nThe T1 separation axiom states that for any two distinct points x and y in X, there exist open sets U and V such that x ∈ U, y ∉ U, and y ∈ V, x ∉ V. In other words, singletons {x} and {y} are closed sets in X."
