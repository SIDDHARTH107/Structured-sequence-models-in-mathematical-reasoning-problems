    "message_2": "To compute the ciphertext using a Feistel cipher, we need to follow the Feistel structure and apply the round function for each round. However, the round function is not provided in the problem statement. The Feistel cipher's security relies on the round function, which is usually a complex and non-linear function that depends on the key.\n\nWithout knowing the specific round function, it is impossible to compute the ciphertext for the given plaintext and key."
