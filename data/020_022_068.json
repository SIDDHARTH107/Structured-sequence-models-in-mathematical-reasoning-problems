    "message_1": "A company has a budget of $10,000 to allocate among three advertising platforms - Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. The cost per click for each platform is $0.20, $0.30, and $0.40 respectively. The company wants to maximize the number of clicks they receive for their budget. What is the optimal allocation of the budget among the three platforms to maximize the number of clicks?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the number of clicks, the company should allocate the entire budget to the platform with the lowest cost per click. In this case, Instagram has the lowest cost per click at $0.20.\n\nSo, the optimal allocation would be:\n- Instagram: $10,000\n- Facebook: $0\n- Twitter: $0\n\nWith this allocation, the company can get the maximum number of clicks for their budget:\n\nNumber of clicks on Instagram = $10,000 / $0.20 = 50,000 clicks"
