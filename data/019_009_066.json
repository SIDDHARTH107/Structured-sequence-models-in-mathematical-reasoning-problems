    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, the negation of a proposition is not simply the opposite of the original proposition. Instead, it is the assertion that the original proposition cannot be proven. So, the negation of the proposition \"There exists a natural number x such that x + 2 = 5\" would be:\n\n\"It cannot be proven that there exists a natural number x such that x + 2 = 5.\"\n\nHowever, it is important to note that in classical logic, the negation of the proposition would be \"For all natural numbers x, x + 2 â‰  5.\" In this case, since the original proposition is true (x = 3), the negation in classical logic would be false."
