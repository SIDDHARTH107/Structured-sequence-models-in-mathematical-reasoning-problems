    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space of holomorphic 2-forms on the hypersurface, we will use Hodge theory and compute the Hodge numbers. The hypersurface $X$ given by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$ is a smooth cubic surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^2$. \n\nFirst, we compute the Hodge diamond of $X$. Since $X$ is a smooth cubic surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^2$, it is a degree 3 hypersurface, and its Hodge diamond is given by:\n\n```\n  1   0   1\n  0   h11 0\n  1   0   1\n```\n\nHere, $h11$ is the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(X)$, which corresponds to the dimension of the space of holomorphic 2-forms on $X$. To compute $h11$, we use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, which states that for a smooth hypersurface $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n$ of degree $d$, we have:\n\n$h^{p,q}(X) = h^{p,q}(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ if $p+q < n-1$\n\n$h^{p,q}(X) = h^{p,q}(\\mathbb{CP}^n) - 1$ if $p+q = n-1$\n\n$h^{p,q}(X) = h^{p,q}(\\mathbb{CP}^n) - (d-1)$ if $p+q = n$\n\nIn our case, $n = 2$ and $d = 3$. Thus, we have:\n\n$h^{1,1}(X) = h^{1,1}(\\mathbb{CP}^2) - (3-1) = 1 - 2 = -1$\n\nHowever, Hodge numbers are always non-negative integers, so we must have made an error in our calculations. The error comes from the fact that the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem does not apply to our situation since the condition $p+q < n-1$ is never satisfied for $n=2$. \n\nInstead, we can use the adjunction formula to compute the canonical bundle of $X$. The canonical bundle of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ is given by $K_{\\mathbb{CP}^2} = \\mathcal{O}(-3)$, and the normal bundle of $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ is given by $\\mathcal{O}(3)$. The adjunction formula states that:\n\n$K_X = K_{\\mathbb{CP}^2}|_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}(3)|_X = \\mathcal{O}(-3)|_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}(3)|_X = \\mathcal{O}(0)|_X$\n\nThis means that $X$ is a Calabi-Yau manifold, and its Hodge diamond is given by:\n\n```\n  1   0   1\n  0   1   0\n  1   0   1\n```\n\nThus, the dimension of the space of holomorphic 2-forms on $X$ is given by $h^{1,1}(X) = 1$."
