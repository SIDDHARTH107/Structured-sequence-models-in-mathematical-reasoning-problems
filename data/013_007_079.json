    "message_1": "Let's assume that a certain fishery has 10 fishermen, and each fisherman can catch up to 100 fish per day. The fishery can sustainably produce a total of 800 fish per day. If each fisherman acts independently and tries to maximize their own catch, how many fish will be caught per day, and how many fish should each fisherman be allowed to catch in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the fishery?",
    "message_2": "If each fisherman acts independently and tries to maximize their own catch, they will each catch 100 fish per day. Therefore, the total number of fish caught per day will be:\n\n10 fishermen * 100 fish/fisherman = 1000 fish\n\nHowever, this is not sustainable, as the fishery can only sustainably produce 800 fish per day. To ensure the long-term sustainability of the fishery, the total catch per day should not exceed 800 fish. To achieve this, we can divide the sustainable limit by the number of fishermen:\n\n800 fish / 10 fishermen = 80 fish/fisherman\n\nSo, each fisherman should be allowed to catch 80 fish per day to ensure the long-term sustainability of the fishery."
