    "message_1": "A thin rod of 10 cm length is heated in such a way that its ends are maintained at 0°C and the middle part is maintained at 100°C. Find the temperature distribution along the length of the rod using Fourier series.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution along the length of the rod, we can use the Fourier series method. The temperature distribution can be represented as a function T(x), where x is the distance from one end of the rod.\n\nSince the rod is symmetric about its midpoint, we can consider only half of the rod (0 ≤ x ≤ 5) and then extend the solution to the full length. The temperature function T(x) can be represented as a Fourier sine series:\n\nT(x) = ∑[B_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere L is the half-length of the rod (5 cm), n is an integer, and B_n are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nTo find the B_n coefficients, we need to use the following formula:\n\nB_n = (2 / L) * ∫[T(x) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nSince the middle part of the rod is maintained at 100°C, we can represent T(x) as a piecewise function:\n\nT(x) = 100 for 0 < x < L\n\nNow, we can find the B_n coefficients:\n\nB_n = (2 / 5) * ∫[100 * sin(n * π * x / 5) dx] from 0 to 5\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\nB_n = (200 / nπ) * [1 - cos(nπ)]\n\nSince cos(nπ) is 1 for even n and -1 for odd n, B_n will be non-zero only for odd n:\n\nB_n = 400 / (nπ) for odd n\n\nNow, we can write the temperature distribution function T(x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 5:\n\nT(x) = ∑[(400 / (nπ)) * sin(n * π * x / 5)] for odd n\n\nTo find the temperature distribution for the full length of the rod (0 ≤ x ≤ 10), we can use symmetry:\n\nT(x) = T(10 - x) for 5 ≤ x ≤ 10\n\nSo, the temperature distribution along the length of the rod is:\n\nT(x) = ∑[(400 / (nπ)) * sin(n * π * x / 5)] for odd n, 0 ≤ x ≤ 5\nT(x) = T(10 - x) for 5 ≤ x ≤ 10"
