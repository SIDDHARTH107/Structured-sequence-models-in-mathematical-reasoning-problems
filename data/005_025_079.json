    "message_1": "A math student wants to determine if the average grade of students in their class is different from 75%. They collect a random sample of 20 students and calculate that the sample mean is 72.5% with a standard deviation of 5%. \n\nWhat is the z-score for this sample mean? \n\nAssuming a significance level of 0.05, is there evidence to suggest that the class average differs from 75%?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the z-score for the sample mean, we can use the formula:\n\nz = (sample mean - population mean) / (standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 72.5%, the population mean is 75%, the standard deviation is 5%, and the sample size is 20.\n\nz = (72.5 - 75) / (5 / sqrt(20))\nz = (-2.5) / (5 / sqrt(20))\nz = -2.5 / (5 / 4.472)\nz = -2.5 / 1.118\nz â‰ˆ -2.24\n\nThe z-score for this sample mean is approximately -2.24.\n\nNow, we need to determine if there is evidence to suggest that the class average differs from 75% at a significance level of 0.05. Since we are looking for a difference (not just greater or lesser), we will use a two-tailed test. For a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05, we need to look at the critical z-scores at 0.025 and 0.975. These critical z-scores are approximately -1.96 and 1.96.\n\nOur calculated z-score of -2.24 is less than the critical z-score of -1.96, which means it falls in the rejection region. Therefore, we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence to suggest that the class average differs from 75% at a significance level of 0.05."
