    "message_2": "To find the period-2 orbit of the logistic map with a control parameter r = 4, we will use the logistic map equation:\n\nx_n+1 = r * x_n * (1 - x_n)\n\nFor a period-2 orbit, we have two points x_1 and x_2 such that:\n\nx_2 = 4 * x_1 * (1 - x_1)\nx_1 = 4 * x_2 * (1 - x_2)\n\nNow, we will solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x_1 and x_2.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express x_2 in terms of x_1:\n\nx_2 = 4 * x_1 * (1 - x_1)\n\nSubstitute this expression for x_2 in the second equation:\n\nx_1 = 4 * (4 * x_1 * (1 - x_1)) * (1 - 4 * x_1 * (1 - x_1))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nx_1 = 16 * x_1 * (1 - x_1) * (1 - 4 * x_1 + 4 * x_1^2)\n\nDivide both sides by x_1:\n\n1 = 16 * (1 - x_1) * (1 - 4 * x_1 + 4 * x_1^2)\n\nNow, we will solve this equation for x_1:\n\n1 = 16 * (1 - x_1) * (1 - 4 * x_1 + 4 * x_1^2)\n1/16 = (1 - x_1) * (1 - 4 * x_1 + 4 * x_1^2)\n\nLet's denote y = x_1, then:\n\n1/16 = (1 - y) * (1 - 4 * y + 4 * y^2)\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\n1/16 = 1 - 4 * y + 4 * y^2 - y + 4 * y^2 - 4 * y^3\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/16 = 1 - 5 * y + 8 * y^2 - 4 * y^3\n\nMultiply both sides by 16:\n\n1 = 16 - 80 * y + 128 * y^2 - 64 * y^3\n\nRearrange:\n\n64 * y^3 - 128 * y^2 + 80 * y - 15 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and solving it numerically, we get three solutions:\n\ny ≈ 0.382, y ≈ 0.618, y ≈ 1.0\n\nSince x_1 = y, we have x_1 ≈ 0.382 and x_1 ≈ 0.618 as the two possible values for x_1. Now, we can find the corresponding values for x_2 using the equation:\n\nx_2 = 4 * x_1 * (1 - x_1)\n\nFor x_1 ≈ 0.382:\n\nx_2 ≈ 4 * 0.382 * (1 - 0.382) ≈ 0.618\n\nFor x_1 ≈ 0.618:\n\nx_2 ≈ 4 * 0.618 * (1 - 0.618) ≈ 0.382\n\nThus, the period-2 orbit of the logistic map with r = 4 is approximately (0.382, 0.618) and (0.618, 0.382). Note that the Feigenbaum constant (δ) and the universality property (α) are not directly used in this specific problem, but they are related to the general behavior of the logistic map and the transition to chaos."
