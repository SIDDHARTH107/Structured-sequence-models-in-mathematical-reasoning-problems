    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it to form a pattern. The length of the Dragon curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2^(n/2))\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after the 7th iteration.\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(7/2))\nLength = 1 * (2^3.5)\nLength = 1 * (sqrt(2)^7)\n\nThe length of the Dragon curve after the 7th iteration is sqrt(2)^7 units."
