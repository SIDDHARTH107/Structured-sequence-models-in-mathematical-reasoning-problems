    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x, we first need to find its first derivative, f'(x), and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nTo make it easier to solve, we can divide the equation by 3:\n\n0 = x^2 - 4x + 3\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic:\n\n0 = (x - 1)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nTo determine whether each critical point is a maximum, minimum, or saddle point, we need to analyze the second derivative, f''(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9)\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we evaluate f''(x) at each critical point:\n\nf''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6\n\nSince f''(1) < 0, the critical point x = 1 is a local maximum.\nSince f''(3) > 0, the critical point x = 3 is a local minimum.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x has two critical points: x = 1 is a local maximum, and x = 3 is a local minimum."
