    "message_1": "Suppose the RSA public key of a user is (n, e) = (3233, 17), and the user wants to send the message \"HELLO\" (represented as a string of ASCII codes) to another user. Convert the message into an integer using ASCII codes, then encrypt the message using the RSA encryption algorithm by finding its ciphertext C.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to convert the message \"HELLO\" into a string of ASCII codes. The ASCII codes for each character are as follows:\n\nH - 72\nE - 69\nL - 76\nL - 76\nO - 79\n\nNow, we concatenate these ASCII codes to form a single integer:\n\n7269767679\n\nNext, we will use the RSA encryption algorithm to encrypt the message. The public key is given as (n, e) = (3233, 17). The encryption formula for RSA is:\n\nC = M^e mod n\n\nwhere M is the message (in this case, the integer 7269767679), e is the encryption exponent (17), and n is the modulus (3233).\n\nC = 7269767679^17 mod 3233\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\nC = 2201\n\nSo, the encrypted message (ciphertext) is 2201."
