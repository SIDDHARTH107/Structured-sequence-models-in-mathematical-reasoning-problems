    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to the Stag Hunt game:\n\nIn a Stag Hunt game, two hunters can choose to hunt either a stag or a hare. If they both hunt stags, they get a larger reward of 10 units each, but if one hunter hunts a stag and the other hunts a hare, they get a smaller reward of only 5 units each. If they both hunt hares, they get a reward of only 2 units each.\n\nSuppose that Hunter 1 believes there is a 40% chance that Hunter 2 will hunt a stag, and a 60% chance that they will hunt a hare. Hunter 1 must then decide whether to hunt a stag or a hare.\n\nIf Hunter 1 chooses to hunt a stag, what is their expected reward? And if Hunter 1 chooses to hunt a hare, what is their expected reward? Which choice should they make to maximize their expected reward, and what is that maximum expected reward?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected reward for each choice, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the corresponding reward and then sum the results.\n\nIf Hunter 1 chooses to hunt a stag:\n- There's a 40% chance that Hunter 2 also hunts a stag, so they both get a reward of 10 units each. The expected reward for this outcome is 0.4 * 10 = 4 units.\n- There's a 60% chance that Hunter 2 hunts a hare, so they both get a reward of 5 units each. The expected reward for this outcome is 0.6 * 5 = 3 units.\nThe total expected reward for Hunter 1 if they choose to hunt a stag is 4 + 3 = 7 units.\n\nIf Hunter 1 chooses to hunt a hare:\n- There's a 40% chance that Hunter 2 hunts a stag, so they both get a reward of 5 units each. The expected reward for this outcome is 0.4 * 5 = 2 units.\n- There's a 60% chance that Hunter 2 hunts a hare, so they both get a reward of 2 units each. The expected reward for this outcome is 0.6 * 2 = 1.2 units.\nThe total expected reward for Hunter 1 if they choose to hunt a hare is 2 + 1.2 = 3.2 units.\n\nTo maximize their expected reward, Hunter 1 should choose to hunt a stag, as the expected reward for that choice is 7 units, which is higher than the expected reward of 3.2 units for hunting a hare."
