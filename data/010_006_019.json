    "message_2": "To find the homotopy class of $\\gamma_0$ and $\\gamma_1$ in $\\pi_1(S^2)$, we need to determine whether these paths are homotopic in $S^2$. Recall that the fundamental group $\\pi_1(S^2)$ of the 2-sphere is trivial, meaning that every loop in $S^2$ is homotopic to the constant loop.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the paths $\\gamma_0$ and $\\gamma_1$. Both paths start and end at the same point, which is the north pole of the sphere:\n\n$$\n\\gamma_0(0) = \\gamma_0(1) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n                                1 \\\\\n                                0 \\\\\n                                0\n                              \\end{bmatrix},\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\gamma_1(0) = \\gamma_1(1) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n                                1 \\\\\n                                0 \\\\\n                                0\n                              \\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nNow, let's find a homotopy between $\\gamma_0$ and $\\gamma_1$. A homotopy is a continuous deformation of one path into another, and it can be represented as a continuous function $H: [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] \\rightarrow S^2$ such that $H(t, 0) = \\gamma_0(t)$ and $H(t, 1) = \\gamma_1(t)$.\n\nConsider the following homotopy:\n\n$$\nH(t, s) = \\cos((1-s)\\pi t + s2\\pi t) \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix}\n                                1 \\\\\n                                0 \\\\\n                                0\n                              \\end{bmatrix}\n                              +\n                              \\sin((1-s)\\pi t + s2\\pi t) \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix}\n                                                    0 \\\\\n                                                    (1-s) \\\\\n                                                    s\n                                                    \\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nIt is clear that $H(t, 0) = \\gamma_0(t)$ and $H(t, 1) = \\gamma_1(t)$. Moreover, $H(t, s)$ is continuous in both $t$ and $s$. Thus, $H$ is a homotopy between $\\gamma_0$ and $\\gamma_1$.\n\nSince $\\gamma_0$ and $\\gamma_1$ are homotopic, they belong to the same homotopy class in $\\pi_1(S^2)$. As mentioned earlier, the fundamental group of the 2-sphere is trivial, so the homotopy class of both $\\gamma_0$ and $\\gamma_1$ is the identity element in $\\pi_1(S^2)$."
