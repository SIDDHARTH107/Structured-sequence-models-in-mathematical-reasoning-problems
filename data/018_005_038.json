    "message_2": "The complement of set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements that are not in set A. In order to find the intersection of set A and its complement A', we need to find the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nHowever, by definition, the complement of a set contains elements that are not in the original set. Therefore, there are no elements that are common to both set A and its complement A'. \n\nSo, the intersection of set A and its complement A' is an empty set, denoted as âˆ… or {}."
