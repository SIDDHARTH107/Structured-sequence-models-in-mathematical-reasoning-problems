Here's a precise numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nA thin, circular disc with a radius of 1 meter has a temperature distribution given by: \n\n$T(r,\\theta) = 3\\cos(3\\theta)e^{-r^2/2}$\n\nwhere $r$ is the radial distance from the center of the disc and $\\theta$ is the angular position measured in radians. Using Fourier series, find the temperature at the center of the disc.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature at the center of the disc, we need to evaluate the given temperature distribution function at r = 0. Since the Fourier series is not needed to solve this problem directly, we can simply plug in r = 0 into the given function:\n\n$T(r,\\theta) = 3\\cos(3\\theta)e^{-r^2/2}$\n\nAt the center, r = 0:\n\n$T(0,\\theta) = 3\\cos(3\\theta)e^{-0^2/2} = 3\\cos(3\\theta)e^0$\n\nSince $e^0 = 1$, the temperature at the center of the disc is:\n\n$T(0,\\theta) = 3\\cos(3\\theta)$\n\nHowever, this temperature is still dependent on the angular position $\\theta$. To find the average temperature at the center, we can integrate the function over the range of $\\theta$ from 0 to $2\\pi$ and divide by the range:\n\n$T_{avg}(0) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi} 3\\cos(3\\theta) d\\theta$\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\n$\\int_0^{2\\pi} 3\\cos(3\\theta) d\\theta = \\left[ \\frac{1}{3}\\sin(3\\theta) \\right]_0^{2\\pi}$\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits:\n\n$\\frac{1}{3}\\sin(6\\pi) - \\frac{1}{3}\\sin(0) = 0$\n\nSo, the average temperature at the center of the disc is:\n\n$T_{avg}(0) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\cdot 0 = 0$"
