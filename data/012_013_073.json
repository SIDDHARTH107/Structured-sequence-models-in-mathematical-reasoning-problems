Find the chromatic polynomial of G.\n\n```\nA---B---C\n|   |   |\nD---E---F\n```\n\nNote: The chromatic polynomial of a graph G is a polynomial that counts the number of ways to color the vertices of G using at most k colors, such that no adjacent vertices have the same color.",
    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G, we can use the deletion-contraction method. This method involves deleting an edge and contracting an edge, then finding the chromatic polynomial of the resulting graphs.\n\nLet's consider the edge connecting vertices B and E. We will first delete this edge and then contract it.\n\n1. Deletion: Remove the edge between B and E.\n\n```\nA---B   C\n|   |   |\nD---E---F\n```\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of this graph, P'(k), can be found by multiplying the chromatic polynomials of its two disconnected components:\n\n```\nA---B     C\n|   |     |\nD---E---F\n```\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of the left component (A, B, D, E) is P1(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + k(k-1)(k-2), and the chromatic polynomial of the right component (C, F) is P2(k) = k(k-1). Therefore, P'(k) = P1(k) * P2(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-1) + k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2.\n\n2. Contraction: Contract the edge between B and E, merging vertices B and E into a single vertex, say BE.\n\n```\nA---BE---C\n|       |\nD-------F\n```\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of this graph, P''(k), can be found by considering the chromatic polynomial of its components:\n\n```\nA---BE     C\n|         |\nD---------F\n```\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of the left component (A, BE, D) is P3(k) = k(k-1)(k-2), and the chromatic polynomial of the right component (C, F) is P4(k) = k(k-1). Therefore, P''(k) = P3(k) * P4(k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2).\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial of the original graph G by subtracting the chromatic polynomial of the contracted graph from the chromatic polynomial of the deleted graph:\n\nP(k) = P'(k) - P''(k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-1) + k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2] - [k(k-1)^2(k-2)]\n\nAfter simplifying, we get:\n\nP(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G is P(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)."
