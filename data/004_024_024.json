    "message_2": "To find the rate of change in x with respect to y (dx/dy), we'll first differentiate the given equation with respect to x, and then with respect to y using the chain rule.\n\nGiven equation: xy^2 + x^3 = 10\n\nDifferentiate with respect to x:\nd/dx(xy^2) + d/dx(x^3) = d/dx(10)\ny^2 + 3x^2 = 0 (since d/dx(10) = 0)\n\nNow, differentiate with respect to y using the chain rule:\nd/dy(y^2 + 3x^2) = d/dy(0)\n2y(dy/dx) + 6x(dx/dy) = 0\n\nWe want to find dx/dy when x = 1 and y = 2. Plug these values into the equation:\n2(2)(dy/dx) + 6(1)(dx/dy) = 0\n4(dy/dx) + 6(dx/dy) = 0\n\nNow, solve for dx/dy:\n6(dx/dy) = -4(dy/dx)\n(dx/dy) = -4(dy/dx) / 6\n(dx/dy) = -2(dy/dx) / 3\n\nTo find dy/dx, we can use the equation we found when differentiating with respect to x:\ny^2 + 3x^2 = 0\n(2)^2 + 3(1)^2 = 0\n4 + 3 = 7 â‰  0\n\nSince the equation y^2 + 3x^2 = 0 is not satisfied when x = 1 and y = 2, it seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement or the given values of x and y. Please check the problem statement and provide the correct information."
