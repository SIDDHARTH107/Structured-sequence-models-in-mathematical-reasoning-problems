Antiderivative of 3x^2:\n   Apply the power rule: (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3\n\n2. Antiderivative of 2x:\n   Apply the power rule: (2x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (2x^2)/2 = x^2\n\n3. Antiderivative of -4:\n   Since the derivative of a constant is zero, the antiderivative of a constant is a linear function: -4x\n\nNow, combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration (C):\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 4x + C"
