    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the metal ball is 10 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 5 cm.\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (5 cm)^2\nSurface area = 4 * π * 25 cm^2\nSurface area = 100π cm^2\n\nApproximating π as 3.14, the surface area is:\n\nSurface area ≈ 100 * 3.14 cm^2\nSurface area ≈ 314 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere is approximately 314 square centimeters."
