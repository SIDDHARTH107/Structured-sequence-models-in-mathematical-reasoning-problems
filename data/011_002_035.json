    "message_2": "Using the formula for binomial coefficients, we have:\n\nn choose k = n! / (k! (n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, we have n = 8 (the total number of items) and k = 3 (the number of items we want to choose). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n8 choose 3 = 8! / (3! (8-3)!)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the factorials:\n\n8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n(8-3)! = 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\n8 choose 3 = 40,320 / (6 × 120)\n\n8 choose 3 = 40,320 / 720\n\n8 choose 3 = 56\n\nSo, there are 56 ways to choose 3 different items from a set of 8 items."
