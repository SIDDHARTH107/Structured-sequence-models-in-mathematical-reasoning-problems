    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^(-3t)cos(6t), we will use the integral representation of the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform F(ω) of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over all real numbers.\n\nIn this case, f(t) = e^(-3t)cos(6t). So, we need to compute the following integral:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-3t)cos(6t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we will first rewrite the cosine function using Euler's formula:\n\ncos(6t) = (e^(j6t) + e^(-j6t))/2\n\nNow, substitute this into the integral:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-3t)(e^(j6t) + e^(-j6t))/2 * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nDistribute the exponential term:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2)∫[e^(-3t+j6t-jωt) + e^(-3t-j6t-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can solve the integral term by term:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2)[∫e^(-3t+j6t-jωt) dt + ∫e^(-3t-j6t-jωt) dt]\n\nTo solve these integrals, we can use the formula:\n\n∫e^(at) dt = (1/a)e^(at) + C\n\nApplying this formula to both integrals:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2)[(1/(-3+j(6-ω)))e^(-3t+j6t-jωt) + (1/(-3+j(-6-ω)))e^(-3t-j6t-jωt)] evaluated from -∞ to +∞\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the limits. Since the function e^(-3t) decays to zero as t goes to infinity, the limits will be:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2)[(1/(-3+j(6-ω)))e^(0) - 0 + (1/(-3+j(-6-ω)))e^(0) - 0]\n\nSimplifying:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2)[(1/(-3+j(6-ω))) + (1/(-3+j(-6-ω)))]\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^(-3t)cos(6t)."
