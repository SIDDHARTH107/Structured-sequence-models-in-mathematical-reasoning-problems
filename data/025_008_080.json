    "message_2": "The given curve is a smooth projective curve, and its genus can be calculated using the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The curve is a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = x^3 - 4x + 1$. The degree of $f(x)$ is 3, so the genus of the curve is given by:\n\n$g = \\frac{1}{2}(3 - 1) = 1$\n\nNow, we can use the Hodge diamond to find the Hodge numbers $h^{2,0}$ and $h^{1,1}$. The Hodge diamond for a curve of genus $g$ is given by:\n\n```\n  h^{0,0}   h^{1,0}\nh^{0,1}   h^{1,1}\n  h^{2,0}   h^{2,1}\n```\n\nFor a curve of genus 1, we have:\n\n```\n  1    g\ng    1-g\n  0    g\n```\n\nSo, for our curve, the Hodge numbers are:\n\n$h^{2,0} = 0$\n$h^{1,1} = 1 - g = 1 - 1 = 0$\n\nThus, the Hodge numbers $h^{2,0}$ and $h^{1,1}$ of the curve are both 0."
