    "message_1": "If the initial angle of the first pendulum of the double pendulum system is 30 degrees and the initial angle of the second pendulum is 45 degrees, and the lengths of the two pendulums are 1 and 2 meters respectively, what is the maximum angle reached by the second pendulum after swinging back and forth for 10 seconds?",
    "message_2": "The double pendulum system is a highly complex and chaotic system, meaning that it is very sensitive to initial conditions and does not have a simple closed-form solution. To determine the maximum angle reached by the second pendulum after swinging back and forth for 10 seconds, we would need to use numerical methods to simulate the motion of the double pendulum.\n\nOne common approach to simulating the motion of a double pendulum is to use the Runge-Kutta method, which is a numerical integration technique for solving ordinary differential equations. By applying this method to the equations of motion for the double pendulum, we can approximate the positions and velocities of the pendulums at discrete time steps.\n\nHowever, this process requires programming and computational resources, which are beyond the scope of this platform. To find the maximum angle reached by the second pendulum, you would need to use a software package or programming language that can handle numerical integration, such as MATLAB, Python, or Mathematica.\n\nOnce you have implemented the numerical integration and simulated the motion of the double pendulum for 10 seconds, you can analyze the results to find the maximum angle reached by the second pendulum."
