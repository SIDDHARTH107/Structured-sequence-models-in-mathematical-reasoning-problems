    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question:\n\nA company produces two products, product A and product B. Each unit of product A requires 2 units of raw material and 3 units of labor, while each unit of product B requires 1 unit of raw material and 4 units of labor. The company has 320 units of raw material and 400 units of labor each week. Each unit of product A generates a profit of $10 and each unit of product B generates a profit of $15. The company wants to maximize its weekly profit. How many units of each product should it produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We have the following constraints:\n\n2x + y ≤ 320 (raw material constraint)\n3x + 4y ≤ 400 (labor constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we'll find the feasible region and then evaluate the objective function at the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 320\n   y ≤ -2x + 320\n\n2. 3x + 4y ≤ 400\n   y ≤ -(3/4)x + 100\n\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 100), (80, 80), and (160, 0). Now, we'll evaluate the profit function at these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 100) = 10(0) + 15(100) = $1500\n3. P(80, 80) = 10(80) + 15(80) = $2000\n4. P(160, 0) = 10(160) + 15(0) = $1600\n\nThe maximum profit of $2000 is achieved when the company produces 80 units of product A and 80 units of product B."
