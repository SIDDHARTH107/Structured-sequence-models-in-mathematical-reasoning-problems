    "message_1": "A ship is trying to travel due east, but there is a current pushing it to the southeast with a velocity of 12 km/hr. If the ship's speed is 15 km/hr, what is the magnitude and direction of the ship's velocity relative to the ground? Use trigonometry to solve.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the ship's velocity relative to the ground, we can use vector addition and trigonometry. Let's represent the ship's velocity as vector A and the current's velocity as vector B.\n\nVector A (ship's velocity) is due east, so it has components:\nA_x = 15 km/hr (east)\nA_y = 0 km/hr (no north/south component)\n\nVector B (current's velocity) is southeast, so it has equal components in the east and south directions. Therefore, its components are:\nB_x = 12*cos(45°) km/hr (east)\nB_y = -12*sin(45°) km/hr (south)\n\nNow, we can find the components of the resultant vector C (ship's velocity relative to the ground) by adding the components of vectors A and B:\nC_x = A_x + B_x = 15 + 12*cos(45°) = 15 + 12*(1/sqrt(2)) ≈ 23.49 km/hr (east)\nC_y = A_y + B_y = 0 - 12*sin(45°) = -12*(1/sqrt(2)) ≈ -8.49 km/hr (south)\n\nTo find the magnitude of vector C, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n|C| = sqrt(C_x^2 + C_y^2) = sqrt((23.49)^2 + (-8.49)^2) ≈ 24.97 km/hr\n\nTo find the direction of vector C, we can use the arctangent function:\nθ = arctan(C_y / C_x) = arctan(-8.49 / 23.49) ≈ -20.3°\n\nSince the angle is negative, it means the direction is south of east. Therefore, the ship's velocity relative to the ground has a magnitude of approximately 24.97 km/hr and a direction of 20.3° south of east."
