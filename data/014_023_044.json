    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using the Rail Fence Cipher with 3 rails, we need to arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern with 3 levels and then read the message horizontally. The message has 17 characters, so the arrangement would look like this:\n\nE . . . I . . . R . . . E\n. V . G . H . S . T . D\n. . Y . . . E . . . O\n\nNow, read the message horizontally:\n\nEIR EVGHSTD YEO\n\nThe original message is \"EIREVGHSTDYEO\"."
