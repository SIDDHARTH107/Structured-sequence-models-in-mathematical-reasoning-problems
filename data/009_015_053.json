    "message_2": "To determine the amount of radioactive material remaining after a certain number of years, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(number of years / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 400 grams, the half-life is 10 years, and we want to find the remaining mass after 20 years.\n\nFinal mass = 400 * (1/2)^(20 / 10)\n\nFinal mass = 400 * (1/2)^2\n\nFinal mass = 400 * (1/4)\n\nFinal mass = 100 grams\n\nAfter 20 years, there will be 100 grams of the radioactive material left."
