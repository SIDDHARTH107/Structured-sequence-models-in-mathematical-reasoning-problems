    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the complex function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z^2 + 2z + 1), we first need to find the points where the denominator is equal to zero.\n\nThe denominator is a quadratic equation: z^2 + 2z + 1. We can factor this as (z + 1)^2. Setting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n(z + 1)^2 = 0\nz + 1 = 0\nz = -1\n\nSo, the singularity occurs at z = -1.\n\nNow, we need to classify the singularity. We can do this by looking at the behavior of the function near the singularity. First, let's simplify the function by factoring the numerator:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z^2 + 2z + 1) = (z - 1)(z + 1)/(z + 1)^2\n\nNow, we can see that the function has a pole of order 2 at z = -1, since the (z + 1) term in the numerator cancels out one of the (z + 1) terms in the denominator, leaving a (z + 1) term in the denominator.\n\nSo, the function f(z) has a pole of order 2 at z = -1."
