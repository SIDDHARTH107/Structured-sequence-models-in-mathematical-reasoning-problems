    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of the given piecewise function, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx))\n\nwhere the sum is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's compute a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\n\nSince f(x) = 0 for -π ≤ x < 0 and f(x) = 1 for 0 ≤ x ≤ π, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] 0 dx + ∫[0, π] 1 dx]\n\nThe first integral is 0, and the second integral is x evaluated from 0 to π:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [0 + (π - 0)] = 1\n\nNow, let's compute a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\n\nAgain, we split the integral into two parts:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] 0 * cos(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] 1 * cos(nx) dx]\n\nThe first integral is 0, and the second integral is (1/n) * sin(nx) evaluated from 0 to π:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [0 + (1/n) * (sin(nπ) - sin(0))] = 0\n\nThis is because sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n.\n\nFinally, let's compute b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nSplitting the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] 0 * sin(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] 1 * sin(nx) dx]\n\nThe first integral is 0, and the second integral is (-1/n) * cos(nx) evaluated from 0 to π:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [0 + (-1/n) * (cos(nπ) - cos(0))] = (-1/n) * (cos(nπ) - 1)\n\nNow, we have all the Fourier coefficients:\n\na_0 = 1\na_n = 0\nb_n = (-1/n) * (cos(nπ) - 1)\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = 1/2 + Σ((-1/n) * (cos(nπ) - 1) * sin(nx))\n\nwhere the sum is from n = 1 to infinity."
