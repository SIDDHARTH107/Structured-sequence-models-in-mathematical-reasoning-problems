The equation is y = 0.1x^2 + 50x + 1000. Find the minimum cost of constructing the building and the number of workers required to achieve that minimum cost.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of constructing the building, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by the quadratic equation y = 0.1x^2 + 50x + 1000. The vertex of a parabola in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by the formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 0.1 and b = 50. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = -50 / (2 * 0.1)\nx = -50 / 0.2\nx = -250\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the y-coordinate (the minimum cost) by plugging x back into the original equation:\n\ny = 0.1(-250)^2 + 50(-250) + 1000\ny = 0.1(62500) - 12500 + 1000\ny = 6250 - 12500 + 1000\ny = -5000\n\nHowever, the result of y = -5000 doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the cost cannot be negative. This indicates that there might be an error in the given quadratic equation. Please check the equation and provide the correct one to find the minimum cost and the number of workers required."
