    "message_2": "To show that G must have a normal subgroup of order 5, we will use Sylow's Theorems. Let's first find the Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nBy Sylow's First Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, denoted by n_5, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Since the order of G is 30, the possible values for n_5 are 1 and 6. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, denoted by n_3, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 10.\n\nNow, we will use Sylow's Second Theorem, which states that all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to each other. If n_5 = 1, then there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, and it must be normal since it is the only one in its conjugacy class. So, we have found a normal subgroup of order 5 in this case.\n\nIf n_5 = 6, then there are 6 Sylow 5-subgroups. Each of these subgroups has order 5, and since the intersection of any two distinct Sylow 5-subgroups is trivial (i.e., contains only the identity element), there are a total of 6 * (5 - 1) = 24 non-identity elements in these subgroups. This leaves only 6 elements in G that are not in any Sylow 5-subgroup. \n\nNow, consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. If n_3 = 10, then there would be 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, each with order 3. Since the intersection of any two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups is trivial, there would be a total of 10 * (3 - 1) = 20 non-identity elements in these subgroups. However, this contradicts the fact that there are only 6 elements in G that are not in any Sylow 5-subgroup. Therefore, n_3 cannot be 10, and it must be 1. This means there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, and it is normal.\n\nNow, let P be the unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup, and let Q be any Sylow 5-subgroup. Since P is normal, the product PQ is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, the order of PQ is |P| * |Q| = 3 * 5 = 15. Thus, PQ is a subgroup of G with index 2, and by a well-known result, any subgroup of index 2 is normal. In particular, PQ is normal in G.\n\nFinally, we claim that Q is normal in G. To see this, consider the action of G on the set of left cosets of PQ by left multiplication. This action induces a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group on the set of left cosets, which has order 2. Since the kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup of G containing PQ, and since Q is a subgroup of PQ, it follows that Q is normal in G. Thus, we have shown that G must have a normal subgroup of order 5.\n\nNow, we will show that there are only two distinct groups of order 30 that have such a normal subgroup. Let Q be a normal subgroup of G of order 5, and let P be the unique normal subgroup of G of order 3. Since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the internal direct product of P and Q, which is isomorphic to the external direct product P × Q.\n\nSince P and Q have orders 3 and 5, respectively, they are both cyclic and isomorphic to Z_3 and Z_5. Thus, G is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_5. There are two distinct groups of order 30 that can be formed in this way: the direct product Z_3 × Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_15, and the semidirect product Z_3 ⋊ Z_5, which is a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nIn conclusion, G must have a normal subgroup of order 5, and there are only two distinct groups of order 30 that have such a normal subgroup: the cyclic group Z_15 and the non-abelian group Z_3 ⋊ Z_5."
