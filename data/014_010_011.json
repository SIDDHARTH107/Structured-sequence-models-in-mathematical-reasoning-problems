    "message_1": "In a substitution cipher, the letters in the alphabet are replaced by other letters according to a specific key. If the letter \"A\" is replaced with the letter \"D\", \"B\" is replaced with \"E\", and so on, what letter is \"F\" replaced with using this key?",
    "message_2": "In this substitution cipher, each letter is replaced by the letter that is 3 positions ahead in the alphabet. So, to find the letter that replaces \"F\", we need to move 3 positions ahead.\n\nF (6th letter) + 3 positions = 9th letter\n\nThe 9th letter in the alphabet is \"I\". Therefore, \"F\" is replaced with the letter \"I\" using this key."
