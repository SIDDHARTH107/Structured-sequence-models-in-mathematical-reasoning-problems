    "message_2": "The formula for the volume of a cone is V = (1/3)πr²h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = (1/3)π(5²)(10)\nV = (1/3)π(25)(10)\nV = (1/3)π(250)\nV ≈ (1/3)(3.14159)(250)\nV ≈ (1.047197)(250)\nV ≈ 261.799\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is approximately 261.8 cubic centimeters (rounded to the nearest tenth)."
