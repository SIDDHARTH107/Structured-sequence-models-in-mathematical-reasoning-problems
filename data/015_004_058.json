    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function f_c(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. The main cardioid is the largest connected region of the Mandelbrot set, and satellite disks are smaller connected regions that are attached to the main cardioid or other satellite disks.\n\nThe smallest value of c for which the Mandelbrot set has a connected main cardioid and a satellite disk of positive radius is when the satellite disk is a period-2 bulb (the smallest possible period) attached to the main cardioid. This occurs at the point where the main cardioid meets the period-2 bulb.\n\nTo find this point, we can use the following formula for the boundary of the main cardioid:\n\nc = (1/4) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere θ is the angle in polar coordinates. For the period-2 bulb, θ = π (180 degrees). Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\nc = (1/4) * (1 - cos(π))\n\nc = (1/4) * (1 - (-1))\n\nc = (1/4) * 2\n\nc = 1/2\n\nSo, the smallest value of c for which the Mandelbrot set has a connected main cardioid and a satellite disk of positive radius is c = 1/2."
