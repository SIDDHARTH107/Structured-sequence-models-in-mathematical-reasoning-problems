    "message_2": "To calculate the fundamental group of the torus with respect to the basepoint on the circle S, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The theorem states that if a topological space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected sets A and B, both containing the basepoint, and their intersection A ∩ B is also path-connected, then the fundamental group of X can be obtained from the fundamental groups of A, B, and A ∩ B.\n\nLet's consider the torus T as the union of two open sets A and B, where A is the torus with a small open disk removed around the basepoint on the circle S, and B is an open tubular neighborhood of the circle S. Both A and B are path-connected and contain the basepoint. Their intersection A ∩ B is an annulus, which is also path-connected.\n\nNow, we can compute the fundamental groups of A, B, and A ∩ B:\n\n1. The space A is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of two circles, which can be seen by collapsing the two non-contractible loops on the torus (one going around the hole and the other going around the \"tube\") to points. Therefore, the fundamental group of A is the free group on two generators, say π₁(A) = ⟨a, b⟩.\n\n2. The space B is homotopy equivalent to a circle, as it is an open tubular neighborhood of the circle S. Therefore, the fundamental group of B is the infinite cyclic group, say π₁(B) = ⟨c⟩.\n\n3. The space A ∩ B is an annulus, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle. Therefore, the fundamental group of A ∩ B is the infinite cyclic group, say π₁(A ∩ B) = ⟨d⟩.\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The fundamental group of the torus T, denoted by π₁(T), is the free product of π₁(A) and π₁(B) with the normal subgroup generated by the relation d = c, as d is the image of c under the homomorphism induced by the inclusion of A ∩ B into A.\n\nThus, π₁(T) = ⟨a, b⟩ * ⟨c⟩ / ⟨d = c⟩ = ⟨a, b, c | d = c⟩.\n\nSince d and c are both generators of infinite cyclic groups, we can replace d with c in the presentation of the fundamental group. Therefore, the fundamental group of the torus T with respect to the basepoint on the circle S is:\n\nπ₁(T) = ⟨a, b, c | c = c⟩ = ⟨a, b, c⟩.\n\nThis is the free abelian group on two generators, which is isomorphic to Z × Z, where Z denotes the set of integers."
