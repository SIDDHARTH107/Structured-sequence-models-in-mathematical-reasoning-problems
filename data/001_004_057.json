    "message_2": "To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the given expression, we need to find the common factors of the coefficients and the variables.\n\nThe coefficients are 6, -12, and 24. The GCF of these numbers is 6.\n\nNow, let's look at the variables. We have x^2, x, and x^3 as the powers of x. The lowest power of x is x, so the GCF for x is x.\n\nWe also have y, y^2, and y^2 as the powers of y. The lowest power of y is y, so the GCF for y is y.\n\nNow, we can multiply the GCF of the coefficients and the GCF of the variables to find the overall GCF of the expression:\n\nGCF = 6 * x * y = 6xy\n\nSo, the greatest common factor of the expression $6x^2y - 12xy^2 + 24x^3y^2$ is 6xy."
