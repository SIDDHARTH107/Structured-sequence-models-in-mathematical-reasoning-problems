    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the inequality for non-planar graphs.\n\nEuler's formula for planar graphs states that:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, V = 10 and E = 20. We want to find the minimum genus g such that the graph can be embedded in a surface of genus g without crossing edges.\n\nFor a graph embedded in a surface of genus g, the inequality is:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6\n\nWe can plug in the values of V and E and solve for g:\n\n20 ≤ 3(10) + 6g - 6\n\n20 ≤ 30 + 6g - 6\n\n-4 ≤ 6g\n\ng ≥ 2/3\n\nSince the genus must be an integer, the minimum genus for the graph G is 1. Therefore, the genus of the graph G is 1."
