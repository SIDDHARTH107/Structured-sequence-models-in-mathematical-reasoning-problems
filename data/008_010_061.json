    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Write down the augmented matrix of the system.\n2. Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n3. Perform back substitution to find the solution.\n\nStep 1: Write down the augmented matrix of the system.\n\nThe augmented matrix is:\n\n|  5  2 -1 |  7 |\n|  2 -3  4 | -5 |\n|  1  1 -1 |  3 |\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (echelon form).\n\nFirst, we'll eliminate the x terms in the second and third rows. To do this, we'll replace the second row with (-2/5) times the first row plus the second row, and replace the third row with (-1/5) times the first row plus the third row.\n\n|  5  2  -1 |  7  |\n|  0 -7  18/5 | -24/5 |\n|  0  3/5 -4/5 |  8/5 |\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the y terms in the third row. To do this, we'll replace the third row with (-3/7) times the second row plus the third row.\n\n|  5  2  -1 |  7  |\n|  0 -7  18/5 | -24/5 |\n|  0  0  -2/5 |  2/5 |\n\nStep 3: Perform back substitution to find the solution.\n\nNow that we have an upper triangular matrix, we can perform back substitution to find the solution.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n\n-2/5 * z = 2/5\n\nDividing both sides by -2/5, we get:\n\nz = -1\n\nNow, substitute z back into the second row:\n\n-7y + 18/5 * (-1) = -24/5\n\n-7y - 18/5 = -24/5\n\nMultiply both sides by -5 to get rid of the fractions:\n\n35y + 18 = 24\n\nSubtract 18 from both sides:\n\n35y = 6\n\nDivide both sides by 35:\n\ny = 6/35 = 2/5\n\nFinally, substitute y and z back into the first row:\n\n5x + 2 * (2/5) - (-1) = 7\n\n5x + 4/5 + 1 = 7\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n25x + 4 + 5 = 35\n\nSubtract 4 and 5 from both sides:\n\n25x = 26\n\nDivide both sides by 25:\n\nx = 26/25\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 26/25, y = 2/5, z = -1"
