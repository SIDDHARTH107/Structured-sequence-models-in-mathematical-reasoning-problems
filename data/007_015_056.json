    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. The first few Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127, and so on.\n\nTo find the 12th Mersenne prime, we need to find the 12th prime number for the exponent n and then calculate 2^n - 1. The first 12 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. The 12th prime number is 37.\n\nNow, we can calculate the 12th Mersenne prime:\n\nM_37 = 2^37 - 1 = 137,438,953,471\n\nSo, the 12th Mersenne prime number is 137,438,953,471."
