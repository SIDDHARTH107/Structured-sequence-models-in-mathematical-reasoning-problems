    "message_2": "The minimum number of crossings in a non-trivial knot with genus 2 is 5.\n\nThis can be seen in the knot known as the \"5_2 knot\" or \"5-crossing knot of genus 2.\" This knot has 5 crossings and cannot be simplified further, making it the minimal example of a non-trivial knot with genus 2."
