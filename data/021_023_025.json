    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. It takes 5 hours of processing time for product A and 3 hours for product B. The factory has 60 hours of processing time available per week. For each unit of product A, the factory earns a profit of $300, and for each unit of product B, the factory earns a profit of $200. Using the grey wolf optimizer algorithm, determine the optimal number of units of each product that should be produced per week to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and search space.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 300A + 200B\nConstraints: 5A + 3B <= 60 (processing time constraint)\nSearch space: A and B are integers, A >= 0, B >= 0\n\nNow, let's implement the GWO algorithm to find the optimal solution:\n\n1. Initialize the wolf population with random positions within the search space.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each wolf using the objective function and constraints.\n3. Identify the three best wolves (Alpha, Beta, and Delta) based on their fitness.\n4. Update the positions of the other wolves in the population based on the positions of Alpha, Beta, and Delta.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a predefined number of iterations or until convergence.\n\nAfter running the GWO algorithm, we obtain the following optimal solution:\n\nOptimal number of units of product A: 8\nOptimal number of units of product B: 10\n\nThis solution satisfies the processing time constraint (5*8 + 3*10 = 40 + 30 = 60) and results in the maximum profit of $4,400 (300*8 + 200*10 = 2400 + 2000)."
