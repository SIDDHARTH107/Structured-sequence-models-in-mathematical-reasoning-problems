    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C, respectively. In this case, we have a = 8, b = 10, and c = 12. We want to find the largest angle, which is the angle opposite the longest side, so we want to find angle C.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the values for a, b, and c, we get:\n\n12^2 = 8^2 + 10^2 - 2 * 8 * 10 * cos(C)\n\n144 = 64 + 100 - 160 * cos(C)\n\nNow, we will solve for cos(C):\n\n80 = 160 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = 80 / 160\n\ncos(C) = 1/2\n\nNow, we will find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 1/2:\n\nC = arccos(1/2)\n\nC ≈ 60°\n\nSo, the measure of the largest angle (C) in the triangle is approximately 60°."
