The edges of the plate are held at fixed temperatures of $100^{\\circ}$C along the top and bottom sides, and $0^{\\circ}$C along the left and right sides.\n\nWhat is the temperature function $u(x,y,t)$ at the point $(x,y) = (2,1)$ and time $t=10$ minutes? Use the heat equation:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\\right)$$\n\nwith thermal diffusivity constant $k=0.01$ m$^2$/min.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\n$$u(x,y,t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)$$\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)Y(y)\\frac{dT}{dt} = k\\left(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y)\\right)$$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $kXYT$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{kT}\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$ and $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-\\lambda$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{kT}\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda$$\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -\\lambda$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $$\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k\\lambda T$$\n2) $$X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$$\n3) $$Y''(y) - \\lambda Y(y) = 0$$\n\nWe will solve these equations one by one.\n\n1) The first equation is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\n$$T(t) = T_0 e^{-k\\lambda t}$$\n\nwhere $T_0$ is a constant.\n\n2) The second equation is a second-order linear ODE with constant coefficients. Its solution depends on the value of $\\lambda$:\n\n- If $\\lambda > 0$, the solution is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$$\n\n- If $\\lambda = 0$, the solution is:\n\n$$X(x) = Ax + B$$\n\n- If $\\lambda < 0$, the solution is:\n\n$$X(x) = Ae^{\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x} + Be^{-\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x}$$\n\n3) The third equation is also a second-order linear ODE with constant coefficients. Its solution is:\n\n$$Y(y) = C\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y) + D\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y)$$\n\nNow we need to apply the boundary conditions:\n\n- Along the top and bottom sides ($y=0$ and $y=W$), the temperature is $100^{\\circ}$C:\n\n$$u(x,0,t) = X(x)Y(0)T(t) = 100$$\n$$u(x,W,t) = X(x)Y(W)T(t) = 100$$\n\n- Along the left and right sides ($x=0$ and $x=L$), the temperature is $0^{\\circ}$C:\n\n$$u(0,y,t) = X(0)Y(y)T(t) = 0$$\n$$u(L,y,t) = X(L)Y(y)T(t) = 0$$\n\nApplying these boundary conditions, we can determine the coefficients $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ and the value of $\\lambda$. Since the problem is symmetric with respect to $x$ and $y$, we can assume that the solution is of the form:\n\n$$u(x,y,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\left[C_n \\cosh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{L}\\right) + D_n \\sinh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{L}\\right)\\right]e^{-k\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t}$$\n\nNow we need to find the coefficients $A_n$, $C_n$, and $D_n$ using the initial condition $u(x,y,0) = x^2 - y^2$. We can do this by expanding the initial condition in a Fourier sine series:\n\n$$x^2 - y^2 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\left[C_n \\cosh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{L}\\right) + D_n \\sinh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{L}\\right)\\right]$$\n\nBy comparing the coefficients, we can find the values of $A_n$, $C_n$, and $D_n$. However, this process is quite involved and requires solving an infinite system of linear equations.\n\nInstead, we will use the fact that the temperature distribution reaches a steady state after a long time. In this case, the temperature function becomes:\n\n$$u(x,y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\left[C_n \\cosh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{L}\\right) + D_n \\sinh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{L}\\right)\\right]$$\n\nNow we can find the temperature at the point $(x,y) = (2,1)$ and time $t=10$ minutes:\n\n$$u(2,1,10) \\approx u(2,1) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{2n\\pi}{10}\\right)\\left[C_n \\cosh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{10}\\right) + D_n \\sinh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{10}\\right)\\right]$$\n\nUnfortunately, without more information about the coefficients $A_n$, $C_n$, and $D_n$, we cannot find an exact value for the temperature at the point $(2,1)$ and time $t=10$ minutes."
