The rental rates for sedans and SUVs are \\$40 and \\$60 per day, respectively. The company wants to maximize its daily revenue subject to the following conditions:\n\n- The total number of cars rented cannot exceed four.\n- At least one sedan must be rented.\n- The revenue earned from each rental cannot exceed \\$120.\n\nWhat is the maximum daily revenue that the company can earn?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the daily revenue, we need to consider the different possible rental scenarios that meet the given conditions. Let's denote the number of sedans rented as S and the number of SUVs rented as U.\n\n1. Renting one sedan and three SUVs (S=1, U=3) is not possible because the company only has two SUVs available.\n\n2. Renting two sedans and two SUVs (S=2, U=2):\nRevenue = 2 * $40 (for sedans) + 2 * $60 (for SUVs) = $80 + $120 = $200\n\n3. Renting one sedan and two SUVs (S=1, U=2):\nRevenue = 1 * $40 (for sedan) + 2 * $60 (for SUVs) = $40 + $120 = $160\n\n4. Renting two sedans and one SUV (S=2, U=1):\nRevenue = 2 * $40 (for sedans) + 1 * $60 (for SUV) = $80 + $60 = $140\n\nComparing the revenues from the different scenarios, we can see that renting two sedans and two SUVs (Scenario 2) yields the maximum daily revenue of $200."
