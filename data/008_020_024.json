    "message_2": "Apologies for the confusion earlier. The coefficient matrix of this system is actually square. Let's solve the system of linear equations:\n\nx + 2y - 3z = 1  (1)\n2x + 3y + 2z = 7  (2)\n3x + 2y - z = 4   (3)\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from equations (2) and (3). To do this, multiply equation (1) by 2 and subtract it from equation (2):\n\n(2) - 2*(1): 2x + 3y + 2z - 2x - 4y + 6z = 7 - 2\ny + 8z = 5  (4)\n\nNext, multiply equation (1) by 3 and subtract it from equation (3):\n\n(3) - 3*(1): 3x + 2y - z - 3x - 6y + 9z = 4 - 3\n-4y + 8z = 1  (5)\n\nNow, we will eliminate y from equations (4) and (5). To do this, multiply equation (4) by 4 and add it to equation (5):\n\n4*(4) + (5): 4y + 32z + (-4y + 8z) = 20 + 1\n40z = 21\n\nNow, solve for z:\n\nz = 21/40\n\nNow, substitute the value of z back into equation (4) to find y:\n\ny + 8(21/40) = 5\ny + 21/5 = 5\ny = 5 - 21/5\ny = (25 - 21)/5\ny = 4/5\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z back into equation (1) to find x:\n\nx + 2(4/5) - 3(21/40) = 1\nx + 8/5 - 63/40 = 1\nx = 1 - 8/5 + 63/40\nx = (40 - 64 + 63)/40\nx = 39/40\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 39/40, y = 4/5, and z = 21/40."
