    "message_1": "A company wants to analyze the salaries of its employees using data mining techniques. The company has 100 employees, and the average salary of all employees is $50,000. The standard deviation of the salaries is $10,000. What percentage of employees have salaries within one standard deviation of the mean salary of the company?",
    "message_2": "According to the empirical rule (also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule) in statistics, approximately 68% of the data in a normal distribution falls within one standard deviation of the mean. In this case, the mean salary is $50,000 and the standard deviation is $10,000. Therefore, approximately 68% of the employees have salaries within one standard deviation of the mean salary, which is between $40,000 and $60,000."
