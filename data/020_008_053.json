Supplier 1 can supply 500 units at $3 each, supplier 2 can supply 700 units at $4 each, and supplier 3 can supply 400 units at $5 each. The factory needs to buy 1000 units of raw material. The cost of transportation from each supplier is $1 per unit. What is the optimal combination of suppliers the factory should choose to minimize the total cost of raw material and transportation?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal combination of suppliers, we need to consider the total cost of raw material and transportation for each supplier. \n\nSupplier 1: Cost per unit = $3 (raw material) + $1 (transportation) = $4 per unit\nSupplier 2: Cost per unit = $4 (raw material) + $1 (transportation) = $5 per unit\nSupplier 3: Cost per unit = $5 (raw material) + $1 (transportation) = $6 per unit\n\nSince the factory needs 1000 units of raw material, we should prioritize the supplier with the lowest cost per unit. In this case, Supplier 1 has the lowest cost per unit at $4. However, Supplier 1 can only supply 500 units, so we will need to source the remaining 500 units from the other suppliers.\n\nNext, we consider Supplier 2, which has a cost per unit of $5. Since Supplier 2 can supply 700 units, we can source the remaining 500 units from them.\n\nSo, the optimal combination of suppliers is:\n- 500 units from Supplier 1 at $4 per unit\n- 500 units from Supplier 2 at $5 per unit\n\nTotal cost = (500 units * $4 per unit) + (500 units * $5 per unit) = $2000 + $2500 = $4500\n\nThe factory should choose to buy 500 units from Supplier 1 and 500 units from Supplier 2 to minimize the total cost of raw material and transportation, which will be $4500."
