    "message_2": "To find the truth value of \"[(P OR Q) AND R]\", we will evaluate the truth values of the individual propositions and then apply the logical operators.\n\nWe are given that P is true, Q is false, and R is true.\n\nNow, let's evaluate (P OR Q):\nSince P is true and Q is false, (P OR Q) is true because in an OR operation, if at least one of the propositions is true, the result is true.\n\nNow, we have [(P OR Q) AND R] which is equivalent to [(True) AND R].\n\nSince R is true, we have [(True) AND (True)].\n\nIn an AND operation, if both propositions are true, the result is true. Therefore, the truth value of \"[(P OR Q) AND R]\" is True."
