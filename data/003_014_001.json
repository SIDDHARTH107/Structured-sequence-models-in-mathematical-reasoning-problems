    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of f(x) = 3 sin(x) - 2 cos(x), we can use the trigonometric identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1.\n\nLet A = 3 sin(x) and B = -2 cos(x). Then, we want to find the maximum value of C, where C = A + B.\n\nNow, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:\n\n(A^2 + B^2) * (sin^2(x) + cos^2(x)) >= (A * sin(x) + B * cos(x))^2\n\nSubstituting A and B:\n\n(3^2 * sin^2(x) + (-2)^2 * cos^2(x)) * (sin^2(x) + cos^2(x)) >= (3 * sin(x) - 2 * cos(x))^2\n\nSince sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, we have:\n\n(9 * sin^2(x) + 4 * cos^2(x)) >= (3 * sin(x) - 2 * cos(x))^2\n\nNow, let's find the maximum value of the left side of the inequality:\n\n9 * sin^2(x) + 4 * cos^2(x) = 9 * (1 - cos^2(x)) + 4 * cos^2(x) = 9 - 5 * cos^2(x)\n\nThe maximum value of 9 - 5 * cos^2(x) occurs when cos^2(x) is at its minimum value, which is 0. So, the maximum value of the left side is 9.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of f(x) = 3 sin(x) - 2 cos(x) is the square root of 9, which is 3. Thus, the maximum value of f(x) is 3."
