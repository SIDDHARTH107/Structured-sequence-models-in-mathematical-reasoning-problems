    "message_2": "To factor the given polynomial completely, we look for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (12) and add up to the coefficient of the linear term (7).\n\nThe two numbers that satisfy this condition are 3 and 4, since 3 Ã— 4 = 12 and 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nTherefore, we can factor the polynomial as:\n\nx^2 + 7x + 12 = (x + 3)(x + 4)"
