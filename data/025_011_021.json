    "message_2": "The dimension of the moduli space of genus 2 abelian varieties with a principal polarization is 3.\n\nIn general, the dimension of the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties (PPAVs) of genus g is given by g(g + 1)/2. In the case of genus 2, this formula gives 2(2 + 1)/2 = 3."
