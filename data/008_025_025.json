    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. To see this, multiply the first equation by 2:\n\n(2x + 3y) * 2 = 7 * 2\n4x + 6y = 14\n\nNow we can see that the second equation (4x + 6y = 12.5) is not a multiple of the first equation (2x + 3y = 7). This means that the system of equations has no solution, as the two lines represented by the equations are parallel and never intersect."
