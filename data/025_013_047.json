    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian matrix of the curve C at the point (0, -1), we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y.\n\nLet F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - x - 1. Then, the curve C is defined by the equation F(x, y) = 0.\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives of F:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 - 1\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (0, -1):\n\n∂F/∂x(0, -1) = -3(0)^2 - 1 = -1\n∂F/∂y(0, -1) = 2(-1) = -2\n\nFinally, we form the Jacobian matrix J of C at the point (0, -1):\n\nJ = | ∂F/∂x  ∂F/∂y |\n    |  -1      -2  |\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix of C at the point (0, -1) is:\n\n| -1  -2 |"
