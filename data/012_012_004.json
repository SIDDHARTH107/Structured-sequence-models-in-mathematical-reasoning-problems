    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. In order to determine the girth of G, we will use the following inequality:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor((2 * |E|) / |V|)\n\nwhere |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices.\n\nIn this case, |E| = 15 and |V| = 10. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor((2 * 15) / 10)\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor(3)\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * 3\ngirth(G) ≤ 6\n\nSo, the girth of G is at most 6. However, we need to check if there is a cycle of length 3, 4, or 5 in the graph. If there is, then the girth of G will be the length of the shortest cycle.\n\nConsider the following cases:\n\n1. If there is a cycle of length 3, then the girth is 3.\n2. If there is no cycle of length 3 but there is a cycle of length 4, then the girth is 4.\n3. If there are no cycles of length 3 or 4 but there is a cycle of length 5, then the girth is 5.\n4. If there are no cycles of length 3, 4, or 5, then the girth is 6.\n\nSince we don't have any information about the specific structure of the graph G, we can only conclude that the girth of G is at most 6."
