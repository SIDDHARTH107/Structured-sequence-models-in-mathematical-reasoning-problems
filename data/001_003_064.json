    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. In this case, we'll use the substitution method.\n\nFirst, let's solve the second equation for x:\n\nx - y = 5\nx = y + 5\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the first equation:\n\n3(y + 5) + 2y = 18\n\nDistribute the 3:\n\n3y + 15 + 2y = 18\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n5y + 15 = 18\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\n5y = 3\n\nDivide by 5:\n\ny = 3/5\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the expression for x:\n\nx = (3/5) + 5\n\nTo add the fraction and the whole number, we need a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 5:\n\nx = (3/5) + (25/5)\n\nAdd the fractions:\n\nx = 28/5\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 28/5 and y = 3/5."
