    "message_1": "A machine produces screws and the probability of each screw being defective is 0.05. What is the probability that out of 100 screws produced, exactly 6 are defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective screws\n- n is the total number of screws produced (100 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective screws we are interested in (6 in this case)\n- p is the probability of a screw being defective (0.05 in this case)\n- (n choose k) is the number of combinations of choosing k defective screws out of n total screws, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 6) = (100 choose 6) * 0.05^6 * (1-0.05)^(100-6)\n\nFirst, let's calculate (100 choose 6):\n\n(100 choose 6) = 100! / (6!(100-6)!) = 100! / (6!94!) = 1192052400\n\nNow, let's calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(X = 6) = 1192052400 * 0.05^6 * 0.95^94 â‰ˆ 0.1509\n\nSo, the probability that out of 100 screws produced, exactly 6 are defective is approximately 0.1509 or 15.09%."
