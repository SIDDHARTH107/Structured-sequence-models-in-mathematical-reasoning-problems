    "message_2": "We will use the identity theorem for holomorphic functions. The identity theorem states that if two holomorphic functions agree on a set with an accumulation point, then they must be equal everywhere in their domain.\n\nConsider the function $g(z) = f(z) - z^2$. Then $g(z)$ is also holomorphic on $\\mathbb{H}$, since it is the difference of two holomorphic functions. Moreover, we have $g(\\frac{1}{n}) = f(\\frac{1}{n}) - (\\frac{1}{n})^2 = \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^2} = 0$ for all positive integers $n$. \n\nThe set of points $\\{\\frac{1}{n} : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ has an accumulation point at $z = 0$. By the identity theorem, we conclude that $g(z) = 0$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$. Therefore, $f(z) = z^2$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$."
