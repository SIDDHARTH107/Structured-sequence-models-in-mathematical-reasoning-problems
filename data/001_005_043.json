    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 3x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 3, b = -5, and c = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (5 ± √((-5)^2 - 4(3)(2))) / 2(3)\n\nx = (5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 6\n\nx = (5 ± √1) / 6\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (5 + 1) / 6\nx = 6 / 6\nx = 1\n\nand\n\nx = (5 - 1) / 6\nx = 4 / 6\nx = 2/3\n\nSo, the solutions to the quadratic equation 3x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0 are x = 1 and x = 2/3."
