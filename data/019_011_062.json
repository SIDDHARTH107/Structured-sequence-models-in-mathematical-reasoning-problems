    "message_2": "The relevance operator (∼) is also known as the material conditional or simply the \"implies\" operator. It is denoted as A → B, which means \"if A, then B.\" The truth table for the material conditional is as follows:\n\nA | B | A → B\n--------------\n0 | 0 |   1\n0 | 1 |   1\n1 | 0 |   0\n1 | 1 |   1\n\nGiven A = 1 and B = 0, the truth value of A ∼ B (or A → B) is 0."
