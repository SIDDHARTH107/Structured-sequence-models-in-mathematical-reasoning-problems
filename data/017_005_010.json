    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 125, we know that |G| = 125 = 5^3. According to the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_5 divides |G|, so n_5 divides 125.\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nThe possible divisors of 125 are 1, 5, 25, and 125. The only divisor that satisfies both conditions is n_5 = 1. This means that there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup in G, which we will denote by H. Since H is the only Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/H. Since |G| = 125 and |H| = 5, we have |G/H| = |G|/|H| = 125/5 = 25. Since 25 = 5^2, G/H is a group of order 25, which must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIf G/H is cyclic, then G is an extension of H by G/H, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Group Extensions, G must be a cyclic group of order 125.\n\nIf G/H is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, then G is an extension of H by G/H, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Group Extensions, G must be isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
