The expected returns and standard deviations of the stocks are given below:\n\n| Stock  | Expected Return | Standard Deviation |\n|--------|----------------|--------------------|\n| A      | 10%            | 8%                 |\n| B      | 12%            | 12%                |\n| C      | 8%             | 5%                 |\n\nYou want to find the portfolio that maximizes your expected return while minimizing your risk. What is the optimal portfolio allocation among the three stocks?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal portfolio allocation, we can use the concept of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), which aims to maximize the expected return for a given level of risk. We will use the following notations:\n\n- wA, wB, and wC are the weights of stocks A, B, and C in the portfolio, respectively.\n- E(R) is the expected return of the portfolio.\n- σ is the standard deviation (risk) of the portfolio.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio can be calculated as:\n\nE(R) = wA * E(RA) + wB * E(RB) + wC * E(RC)\n\nThe risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio can be calculated as:\n\nσ² = wA² * σA² + wB² * σB² + wC² * σC² + 2 * wA * wB * Cov(A, B) + 2 * wA * wC * Cov(A, C) + 2 * wB * wC * Cov(B, C)\n\nHowever, we do not have the covariance values between the stocks. In this case, we can only find the optimal portfolio allocation by making some assumptions or using historical data to estimate the covariance values.\n\nAssuming that the stocks are not correlated (Cov(A, B) = Cov(A, C) = Cov(B, C) = 0), the risk of the portfolio simplifies to:\n\nσ² = wA² * σA² + wB² * σB² + wC² * σC²\n\nSince we have a budget of $500,000 and we want to invest in all three stocks, we have the following constraint:\n\nwA + wB + wC = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the weights wA, wB, and wC that maximize E(R) while minimizing σ², subject to the constraint wA + wB + wC = 1.\n\nThis is an optimization problem that can be solved using various techniques, such as the Lagrange multiplier method or numerical optimization methods like the Markowitz mean-variance optimization.\n\nHowever, without additional information on the correlation between the stocks, it is not possible to provide a specific optimal portfolio allocation. The optimal allocation would depend on the investor's risk tolerance and the correlation between the stocks."
