Since x ∈ U and y ∈ V, and U ∩ V = {1} ≠ ∅, they are not disjoint open sets.\n\n2. x = 1, y = 3: We can choose U = {1} and V = {3, 4}. Since x ∈ U and y ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅, they are disjoint open sets.\n\n3. x = 1, y = 4: We can choose U = {1} and V = {3, 4}. Since x ∈ U and y ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅, they are disjoint open sets.\n\n4. x = 2, y = 3: We can choose U = {1, 2} and V = {3, 4}. Since x ∈ U and y ∈ V, and U ∩ V = ∅, they are disjoint open sets.\n\n5. x = 2, y = 4: We can choose U = {1, 2} and V = {3, 4}.

Since x ∈ U and y ∈ V, and U ∩ V = {3, 4} ≠ ∅, they are not disjoint open sets.\n\nSince we found pairs of distinct points (x = 1, y = 2) and (x = 3, y = 4) for which there are no disjoint open sets U and V in T such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V, the topology T does not satisfy the T1 separation axiom."
