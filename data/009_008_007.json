Take $a=1$ and $c=2$, and find the displacement of the wave at $x= \\pi/4$ and $t=1$.",
    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation with the given initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$:\n\n$$\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n$$\n\nSubstitute this into the wave equation:\n\n$$\nX(x)T''(t) - 4X''(x)T(t) = 0\n$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 4\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}\n$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-k^2$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 4\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2\n$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\nT''(t) + k^2T(t) = 0\n$$\n\n$$\nX''(x) + \\frac{k^2}{4}X(x) = 0\n$$\n\nThe general solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$$\nT(t) = A\\cos(kt) + B\\sin(kt)\n$$\n\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$\nX(x) = C\\cos(\\frac{k}{2}x) + D\\sin(\\frac{k}{2}x)\n$$\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions. First, $u(x,0) = \\cos(x)$:\n\n$$\nX(x)T(0) = \\cos(x) \\implies X(x) = \\cos(x)\n$$\n\nSince $T(0) = A$, we have $A = 1$. The second initial condition is $u_t(x,0) = 0$:\n\n$$\nX(x)T'(0) = 0 \\implies T'(0) = 0\n$$\n\nSince $T'(0) = -k\\sin(kt)|_{t=0} = -kB$, we have $B = 0$. Thus, the solution is:\n\n$$\nu(x,t) = \\cos(x)\\cos(kt)\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $k$. Since the initial condition is given for $0 \\leq x \\leq \\pi$, we can assume that the solution is periodic with period $2\\pi$. This means that:\n\n$$\n\\frac{k}{2} = 1 \\implies k = 2\n$$\n\nSo the solution is:\n\n$$\nu(x,t) = \\cos(x)\\cos(2t)\n$$\n\nFinally, we can find the displacement of the wave at $x = \\pi/4$ and $t = 1$:\n\n$$\nu(\\frac{\\pi}{4}, 1) = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4})\\cos(2) \\approx 0.2919\n$$"
