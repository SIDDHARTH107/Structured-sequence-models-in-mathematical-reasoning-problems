    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using the Frobenius method, we first assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(z) = Σ (from n=0 to ∞) a_n * z^(n+r)\n\nwhere a_n are the coefficients to be determined, and r is a constant. We also need to find the derivatives of u(z):\n\nu'(z) = Σ (from n=0 to ∞) (n+r) * a_n * z^(n+r-1)\n\nu''(z) = Σ (from n=0 to ∞) (n+r)(n+r-1) * a_n * z^(n+r-2)\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the given differential equation:\n\n(1 + z^2) * Σ (from n=0 to ∞) (n+r)(n+r-1) * a_n * z^(n+r-2) + z^3 * Σ (from n=0 to ∞) (n+r) * a_n * z^(n+r-1) + z^2 * Σ (from n=0 to ∞) a_n * z^(n+r) = 0\n\nWe can simplify this expression by combining the summations and factoring out the z terms:\n\nΣ (from n=0 to ∞) [ (1 + z^2) * (n+r)(n+r-1) * a_n * z^(n+r-2) + z^3 * (n+r) * a_n * z^(n+r-1) + z^2 * a_n * z^(n+r) ] = 0\n\nNow, we can equate the coefficients of each power of z to zero:\n\nFor z^(n+r-2): (n+r)(n+r-1) * a_n = 0\n\nFor z^(n+r-1): (n+r) * a_n = 0\n\nFor z^(n+r): a_n = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: n + r = 0, which implies r = -n\nCase 2: n + r - 1 = 0, which implies r = 1 - n\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0) = 1 => Σ (from n=0 to ∞) a_n * 0^(n+r) = 1\nu'(1) = 2i => Σ (from n=0 to ∞) (n+r) * a_n * 1^(n+r-1) = 2i\n\nFor the first boundary condition, we have:\n\na_0 = 1, and all other coefficients are 0.\n\nFor the second boundary condition, we have:\n\nΣ (from n=0 to ∞) (n+r) * a_n = 2i\n\nSince a_0 = 1, we have:\n\nr * a_0 + Σ (from n=1 to ∞) (n+r) * a_n = 2i\n\nr + Σ (from n=1 to ∞) (n+r) * a_n = 2i\n\nNow, we need to find the values of r and a_n that satisfy this equation. We can try both cases for r:\n\nCase 1: r = -n\n\n- n + Σ (from n=1 to ∞) (n - n) * a_n = 2i\n\nThis case does not provide a solution since the summation term becomes 0.\n\nCase 2: r = 1 - n\n\n1 - n + Σ (from n=1 to ∞) (n + 1 - n) * a_n = 2i\n\n1 - n + Σ (from n=1 to ∞) a_n = 2i\n\nThis case gives us a solution for a_n:\n\na_n = (2i - 1 + n) / (n + 1)\n\nNow, we can write the solution u(z) as:\n\nu(z) = Σ (from n=0 to ∞) a_n * z^(n+r)\n\nu(z) = a_0 * z^r + Σ (from n=1 to ∞) a_n * z^(n+r)\n\nu(z) = z^(1-n) + Σ (from n=1 to ∞) [(2i - 1 + n) / (n + 1)] * z^(n+1-n)\n\nu(z) = z^(1-n) + Σ (from n=1 to ∞) [(2i - 1 + n) / (n + 1)] * z\n\nThis is the solution to the boundary value problem using the Frobenius method."
