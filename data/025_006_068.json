    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology class $[\\omega]$ in the de Rham cohomology $H^2_{dR}(X;\\mathbb{C})$, we first need to find a closed 2-form representing the cohomology class. Since $\\omega$ is given, we need to check if it is closed. A form is closed if its exterior derivative is zero, i.e., $d\\omega = 0$.\n\nLet's compute the exterior derivative of $\\omega$:\n\n$d\\omega = d(\\frac{x\\,dy\\wedge dz - y\\,dx\\wedge dz + z\\,dx\\wedge dy}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^2})$\n\nUsing the product rule for exterior derivatives, we have:\n\n$d\\omega = \\frac{1}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^2} d(x\\,dy\\wedge dz - y\\,dx\\wedge dz + z\\,dx\\wedge dy) - \\frac{2(x^2+y^2+z^2)(2x\\,dx + 2y\\,dy + 2z\\,dz)}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^4}(x\\,dy\\wedge dz - y\\,dx\\wedge dz + z\\,dx\\wedge dy)$\n\nNow, let's compute the exterior derivative of each term:\n\n$d(x\\,dy\\wedge dz) = dx\\wedge dy\\wedge dz$\n\n$d(-y\\,dx\\wedge dz) = -dy\\wedge dx\\wedge dz$\n\n$d(z\\,dx\\wedge dy) = dz\\wedge dx\\wedge dy$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$d\\omega = \\frac{1}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^2}(dx\\wedge dy\\wedge dz - dy\\wedge dx\\wedge dz + dz\\wedge dx\\wedge dy) - \\frac{4(x\\,dx + y\\,dy + z\\,dz)}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^3}(x\\,dy\\wedge dz - y\\,dx\\wedge dz + z\\,dx\\wedge dy)$\n\nNow, notice that the first term is a 3-form, and the second term is a 2-form. Since we are working in $\\mathbb{C}^3$, the 3-form part of $d\\omega$ is automatically zero. Thus, we only need to consider the 2-form part:\n\n$- \\frac{4(x\\,dx + y\\,dy + z\\,dz)}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^3}(x\\,dy\\wedge dz - y\\,dx\\wedge dz + z\\,dx\\wedge dy)$\n\nNow, recall that $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 = 0$ on the algebraic variety $X$. Taking the exterior derivative of this equation, we get:\n\n$2x\\,dx + 2y\\,dy + 2z\\,dz = 0$\n\nThus, the 2-form part of $d\\omega$ is also zero. Therefore, $d\\omega = 0$, and $\\omega$ is a closed 2-form.\n\nSince $\\omega$ is closed, it represents a cohomology class in $H^2_{dR}(X;\\mathbb{C})$. Thus, the cohomology class $[\\omega]$ is given by the closed 2-form $\\omega$:\n\n$[\\omega] = \\frac{x\\,dy\\wedge dz - y\\,dx\\wedge dz + z\\,dx\\wedge dy}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^2}$"
