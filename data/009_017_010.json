    "message_1": "A copper wire with a radius of 0.5 mm carries a current of 2 A. The wire is surrounded by a vacuum with a permeability of 4π×10^-7 H/m. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the wire, according to Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic fields?",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability (μ) and the enclosed current (I).\n\nIn this case, we can use the formula for the magnetic field around a long straight wire:\n\nB = (μ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ is the permeability, I is the current, and r is the distance from the center of the wire.\n\nGiven:\nμ = 4π × 10^-7 H/m\nI = 2 A\nr = 2 cm = 0.02 m\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^-7 H/m * 2 A) / (2 * π * 0.02 m)\n\nB = (8π × 10^-7 Tm/A) / (0.04π m)\n\nB = 2 × 10^-5 T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the wire is 2 × 10^-5 Tesla."
