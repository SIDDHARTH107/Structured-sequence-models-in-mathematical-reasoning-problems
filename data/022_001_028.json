The branch cut for the function f(z) = log(z+1) is the interval [-1, 0) on the real axis.\n\nLet's choose a path that goes from z=0 to z=2 in the upper half-plane, avoiding the branch cut. One possible path is a semicircle with radius 1 centered at z=1, which we can parametrize as z(t) = 1 + e^(iπt) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.\n\nNow, we can find the analytic continuation of f(z) along this path by integrating its derivative with respect to z:\n\nf'(z) = d(log(z+1))/dz = 1/(z+1)\n\nWe integrate f'(z) along the path z(t):\n\n∫(0 to 1) f'(z(t)) * z'(t) dt = ∫(0 to 1) (1/(1 + e^(iπt))) * (iπe^(iπt)) dt\n\nLet's make a substitution: u = e^(iπt), so du = iπe^(iπt) dt. The integral becomes:\n\n∫(1 to -1) (1/(1 + u)) * (1/iπ) du = (1/iπ) * ∫(1 to -1) (1/(1 + u)) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\n(1/iπ) * [-log|1 + u|] (from 1 to -1) = (1/iπ) * (log|2| - log|0|) = (1/iπ) * log|2|\n\nSo, the analytic continuation of f(z) = log(z+1) from z=0 to z=2 along the chosen path is:\n\nf(2) = f(0) + (1/iπ) * log|2| = log(1) + (1/iπ) * log|2| = (1/iπ) * log|2|\n\nThus, the analytic continuation of the complex function f(z) = log(z+1) from the initial point z=0 along a path that avoids the branch cut on the negative real axis to the point z=2 is (1/iπ) * log|2|."
