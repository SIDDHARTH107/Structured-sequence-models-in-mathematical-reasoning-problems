The company has three different transportation routes available with the following capacities (in units):\n- Route 1: 2000 units\n- Route 2: 1500 units\n- Route 3: 1000 units\n\nThe transportation costs per unit (in dollars) for each route are as follows:\n- Route 1: $5\n- Route 2: $6\n- Route 3: $8\n\nWhat is the minimum cost for the company to transport all 1500 units from factory A to factory B?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost, we need to determine which route or combination of routes will result in the lowest total cost for transporting 1500 units.\n\n1. Using only Route 1:\nCapacity: 2000 units (enough to transport all 1500 units)\nCost per unit: $5\nTotal cost: 1500 units * $5/unit = $7500\n\n2. Using only Route 2:\nCapacity: 1500 units (enough to transport all 1500 units)\nCost per unit: $6\nTotal cost: 1500 units * $6/unit = $9000\n\n3. Using only Route 3:\nCapacity: 1000 units (not enough to transport all 1500 units)\n\n4. Using Route 1 and Route 3:\nCapacity: 2000 + 1000 = 3000 units (enough to transport all 1500 units)\nHowever, using Route 1 alone is already enough and cheaper than using Route 3, so there is no need to combine these two routes.\n\n5. Using Route 2 and Route 3:\nCapacity: 1500 + 1000 = 2500 units (enough to transport all 1500 units)\nAgain, using Route 2 alone is already enough and cheaper than using Route 3, so there is no need to combine these two routes.\n\n6. Using Route 1, Route 2, and Route 3:\nCapacity: 2000 + 1500 + 1000 = 4500 units (enough to transport all 1500 units)\nHowever, using Route 1 alone is already enough and cheaper than using any combination of the other routes, so there is no need to use all three routes.\n\nThe minimum cost for the company to transport all 1500 units from factory A to factory B is $7500, using only Route 1."
