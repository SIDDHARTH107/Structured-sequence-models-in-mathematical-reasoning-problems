    "message_2": "Since each of the 5 distinct boxes must contain at least 2 balls, we will first place 2 balls in each box. This leaves us with 10 - 2*5 = 0 balls to distribute.\n\nNow, we can use the stars and bars method to distribute the remaining balls. In this method, we consider the balls as stars and use bars to separate them into different boxes. Since there are 5 boxes, we need 4 bars to separate them.\n\nHowever, in this case, there are no remaining balls to distribute, so there is only 1 way to distribute the 10 identical balls to the 5 distinct boxes, which is to place 2 balls in each box."
