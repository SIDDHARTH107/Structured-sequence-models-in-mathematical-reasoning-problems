    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures k1 and k2 at the point (1,1,-1), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. \n\n1. First, find the tangent plane at the given point:\nCompute the partial derivatives of z with respect to x and y:\n∂z/∂x = 3x^2 - 3y^2\n∂z/∂y = -6xy\n\nAt the point (1,1,-1), we have:\n∂z/∂x = 3(1)^2 - 3(1)^2 = 0\n∂z/∂y = -6(1)(1) = -6\n\nThe tangent plane at the point (1,1,-1) is given by the equation:\nz - (-1) = 0(x - 1) - 6(y - 1)\n\n2. Compute the first fundamental form:\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n[ E  F ]\n[ F  G ]\n\nwhere E = <ru, ru>, F = <ru, rv>, G = <rv, rv>, and ru and rv are the partial derivatives of the position vector r with respect to u and v.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as:\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^3 - 3uv^2)\n\nThen, we have:\nru = ∂r/∂u = (1, 0, 3u^2 - 3v^2)\nrv = ∂r/∂v = (0, 1, -6uv)\n\nAt the point (1,1,-1), we have:\nru = (1, 0, 0)\nrv = (0, 1, -6)\n\nNow, we can compute E, F, and G:\nE = <ru, ru> = (1)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 = 1\nF = <ru, rv> = (1)(0) + (0)(1) + (0)(-6) = 0\nG = <rv, rv> = (0)^2 + (1)^2 + (-6)^2 = 37\n\nThe first fundamental form is:\n[ 1  0 ]\n[ 0  37 ]\n\n3. Compute the second fundamental form:\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n[ L  M ]\n[ M  N ]\n\nwhere L = <ruu, n>, M = <ruv, n>, N = <rvv, n>, and n is the unit normal vector to the surface.\n\nFirst, find the normal vector n:\nn = ru × rv = (0, 0, 1)\n\nNow, compute the second derivatives of r:\nruu = ∂^2r/∂u^2 = (0, 0, 6u)\nruv = ∂^2r/∂u∂v = (0, 0, -6v)\nrvv = ∂^2r/∂v^2 = (0, 0, -6u)\n\nAt the point (1,1,-1), we have:\nruu = (0, 0, 6)\nruv = (0, 0, -6)\nrvv = (0, 0, -6)\n\nNow, we can compute L, M, and N:\nL = <ruu, n> = (0)(0) + (0)(0) + (6)(1) = 6\nM = <ruv, n> = (0)(0) + (0)(0) + (-6)(1) = -6\nN = <rvv, n> = (0)(0) + (0)(0) + (-6)(1) = -6\n\nThe second fundamental form is:\n[  6 -6 ]\n[ -6 -6 ]\n\n4. Compute the principal curvatures k1 and k2:\nThe principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the matrix product (First fundamental form)^(-1) * (Second fundamental form).\n\nFirst, find the inverse of the first fundamental form:\n[ 1  0 ]^(-1) = [ 1  0 ]\n[ 0 37 ]       [ 0 1/37 ]\n\nNow, compute the matrix product:\n[ 1  0 ] * [  6 -6 ] = [  6 -6/37 ]\n[ 0 1/37]   [ -6 -6 ]   [ -6/37 -6/37 ]\n\nThe characteristic equation for the eigenvalues is:\ndet(A - λI) = (6 - λ)((-6/37) - λ) - (-6/37)(-6/37) = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\nλ^2 - (6 - 6/37)λ - 36/37 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the eigenvalues (principal curvatures):\nk1 = (6 - 6/37 + sqrt((6 - 6/37)^2 - 4(-36/37)))/2 ≈ 2.324\nk2 = (6 - 6/37 - sqrt((6 - 6/37)^2 - 4(-36/37)))/2 ≈ -0.324\n\nSo, the principal curvatures k1 and k2 at the point (1,1,-1) are approximately 2.324 and -0.324."
