    "message_2": "To analyze the Chua circuit, we need to first write down the governing equations. The Chua circuit consists of a resistor, an inductor, a capacitor, and a Chua diode. The governing equations for the Chua circuit are given by:\n\n1. $C_1 \\frac{dV_1}{dt} = G(V_2 - V_1) - g(V_1)$\n2. $C_2 \\frac{dV_2}{dt} = G(V_1 - V_2) + I$\n3. $L \\frac{dI}{dt} = -V_2$\n\nwhere $G = 1/R$, $g(V_1)$ is the piecewise-linear function representing the Chua diode, and the parameters $a$, $b$, $m_0$, and $m_1$ are related to the circuit components.\n\nThe Chua diode function is given by:\n\n$g(V_1) = m_1 V_1 + \\frac{1}{2}(m_0 - m_1)(|V_1 + 1| - |V_1 - 1|)$\n\nNow, we have the governing equations and the Chua diode function. To find the steady-state voltage and frequency of the chaotically oscillating output, we need to numerically solve these equations using the given parameters and initial conditions.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that chaotic systems are highly sensitive to initial conditions, and the steady-state voltage and frequency may not be well-defined. In practice, one would use numerical simulations to analyze the behavior of the Chua circuit and study its bifurcation diagrams and attractors.\n\nTo get a numerical solution, you can use software like MATLAB or Python to solve the system of differential equations and analyze the output. The steady-state voltage and frequency can then be estimated from the simulation results."
