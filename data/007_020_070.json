    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext C using RSA encryption, we use the formula:\n\nC ≡ M^e (mod n)\n\nwhere M is the message, e is the public exponent, and n is the modulus. In this case, M = 123, e = 17, and n = 323.\n\nC ≡ 123^17 (mod 323)\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\nC ≡ 248533713 (mod 323)\n\nC = 69\n\nSo, the corresponding ciphertext C for the message M = 123 using the public key (17, 323) is 69."
