Find the intersection of set S and its complement.\n4. Is the result the empty set? Prove your answer using set theory.",
    "message_2": "1. The set S contains all even numbers less than or equal to 10. Therefore, S = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}.\n\n2. The complement of set S, denoted as S', contains all numbers that are not in S. Since S contains even numbers less than or equal to 10, the complement will contain all odd numbers less than or equal to 10. Therefore, S' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\n3. The intersection of set S and its complement, denoted as S ∩ S', represents the set of all elements that are common to both S and S'. Since S contains even numbers and S' contains odd numbers, there are no common elements between the two sets. Therefore, S ∩ S' = {}.\n\n4. The result of the intersection of set S and its complement is the empty set, as shown in step 3. In set theory, the empty set, denoted as ∅, is a set with no elements. Since S ∩ S' = {}, this means that the intersection of S and S' is indeed the empty set. This is because, by definition, the complement of a set contains all elements that are not in the original set, so there cannot be any elements common to both the set and its complement."
