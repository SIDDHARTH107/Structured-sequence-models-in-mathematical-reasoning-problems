    "message_2": "Based on the historical data provided, the probability of a political revolution occurring in Country X within the next 3 years is 10% (0.10), assuming that Country X has similar political and economic conditions to the countries in the historical data. However, it is important to note that this is a simplified analysis and other factors may influence the actual probability."
