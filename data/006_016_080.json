    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces a certain type of electronic device with a defect rate of 5%. If a random sample of 100 devices is selected, what is the probability of finding at least 4 defective devices?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of finding at least 4 defective devices, we can use the binomial probability formula and then subtract the probabilities of finding 0, 1, 2, or 3 defective devices from 1.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of finding exactly x defective devices\n- C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, also written as nCx or \"n choose x\"\n- n is the total number of devices in the sample (100 in this case)\n- x is the number of defective devices we want to find (0, 1, 2, or 3 in this case)\n- p is the probability of a device being defective (0.05 in this case)\n\nFirst, let's find the probabilities of finding 0, 1, 2, or 3 defective devices:\n\nP(0) = C(100, 0) * 0.05^0 * (1-0.05)^(100-0)\nP(1) = C(100, 1) * 0.05^1 * (1-0.05)^(100-1)\nP(2) = C(100, 2) * 0.05^2 * (1-0.05)^(100-2)\nP(3) = C(100, 3) * 0.05^3 * (1-0.05)^(100-3)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute these values, we get:\n\nP(0) ≈ 0.0036\nP(1) ≈ 0.0377\nP(2) ≈ 0.1314\nP(3) ≈ 0.2283\n\nNow, we can find the probability of finding at least 4 defective devices by subtracting the probabilities of finding 0, 1, 2, or 3 defective devices from 1:\n\nP(at least 4) = 1 - (P(0) + P(1) + P(2) + P(3))\nP(at least 4) ≈ 1 - (0.0036 + 0.0377 + 0.1314 + 0.2283)\nP(at least 4) ≈ 1 - 0.4010\nP(at least 4) ≈ 0.5990\n\nSo, the probability of finding at least 4 defective devices in a random sample of 100 devices is approximately 0.5990 or 59.9%."
