    "message_1": "Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$ with the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 17x + 7$. Suppose $P$ and $Q$ are points on $E$ with $P = (2, 5)$ and $Q = (-1, 5)$. Calculate the coordinates of the point $P+Q$ on $E$.",
    "message_2": "To find the sum of two points $P$ and $Q$ on an elliptic curve, we need to find the line that passes through $P$ and $Q$, and then find the third point of intersection of this line with the curve. Finally, we reflect this third point across the x-axis to obtain the result.\n\nSince $P$ and $Q$ have the same y-coordinate, the line passing through them is a vertical line with the equation $x = \\frac{1}{2}(2 - 1) = \\frac{1}{2}$. This line intersects the curve at a third point, which we will call $R$. The x-coordinate of $R$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so we can plug this into the equation of the curve to find the y-coordinate of $R$:\n\n$y^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 + 17\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 7$\n\n$y^2 = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{17}{2} + 7$\n\n$y^2 = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{68}{4} + \\frac{28}{4}$\n\n$y^2 = \\frac{97}{4}$\n\nSince $P$ and $Q$ have a y-coordinate of $5$, the y-coordinate of $R$ must be the other square root of $\\frac{97}{4}$, which is $-\\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nSo, $R = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{5}{2}\\right)$.\n\nNow, we reflect $R$ across the x-axis to find the point $P + Q$. The x-coordinate remains the same, and the y-coordinate becomes the negation of the y-coordinate of $R$. Thus,\n\n$P + Q = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}\\right)$."
