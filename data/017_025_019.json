    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct groups of order 120, we first need to find the prime factorization of 120. The prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 × 3 × 5. Now, we will use the formula for the number of distinct groups of order n, which is given by:\n\nn(G) = (p^(k+1) - 1)/(p - 1)\n\nwhere n(G) is the number of distinct groups of order G, p is a prime factor of G, and k is the highest power of p that divides G.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, we have k = 3, so the number of distinct groups of order 2^3 is:\n\nn(2^3) = (2^(3+1) - 1)/(2 - 1) = (16 - 1)/1 = 15\n\nFor the prime factor 3, we have k = 1, so the number of distinct groups of order 3 is:\n\nn(3) = (3^(1+1) - 1)/(3 - 1) = (9 - 1)/2 = 4\n\nFor the prime factor 5, we have k = 1, so the number of distinct groups of order 5 is:\n\nn(5) = (5^(1+1) - 1)/(5 - 1) = (25 - 1)/4 = 6\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of distinct groups of each order to find the total number of distinct groups of order 120:\n\nn(120) = n(2^3) × n(3) × n(5) = 15 × 4 × 6 = 360\n\nHowever, this number includes groups that are not distinct, so we need to divide by the number of automorphisms of the cyclic group of order 120:\n\nAut(C120) = φ(120) = φ(2^3 × 3 × 5) = φ(2^3) × φ(3) × φ(5) = 4 × 2 × 4 = 32\n\nwhere φ is Euler's totient function.\n\nSo, the number of distinct groups of order 120 is:\n\nn(120) = 360 / 32 = 11\n\nNow, let's determine which of these groups are isomorphic to the cyclic group C120 or the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2.\n\n1. C120: A group of order 120 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C120 if and only if it is a cyclic group itself. There is only one such group, which is C120.\n\n2. A5 × C2 × C2: A group of order 120 is isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2 if and only if it is a semidirect product of A5 and C2 × C2. There is only one such group, which is A5 × C2 × C2.\n\nSo, out of the 11 distinct groups of order 120, 2 of them are isomorphic to the cyclic group C120 or the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2."
