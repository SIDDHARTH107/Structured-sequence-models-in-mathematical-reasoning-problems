    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves defined by polynomials f(x, y) and g(x, y) is equal to the product of their degrees, provided that the intersection points are counted with multiplicity and the curves have no common components.\n\nIn this case, the degree of f(x, y) is 2, since the highest power of x or y is 2 (x^2 and y^2 terms). The degree of g(x, y) is 1, since the highest power of x or y is 1 (x and y terms).\n\nNow, we need to check if f(x, y) and g(x, y) have any common components. To do this, we can compute their greatest common divisor (GCD). Since f(x, y) and g(x, y) have no common factors, their GCD is 1.\n\nTherefore, according to Bezout's theorem, the number of intersection points of f(x, y) and g(x, y) in the plane is the product of their degrees, which is 2 * 1 = 2. So, there are 2 intersection points of f(x, y) and g(x, y) in the plane."
