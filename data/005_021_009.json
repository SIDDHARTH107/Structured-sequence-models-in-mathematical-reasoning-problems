    "message_2": "Bootstrapping is a resampling technique used to estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with replacement. To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean exam score using bootstrapping, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a random sample of 50 exam scores with replacement from the original dataset. This is called a bootstrap sample.\n2. Calculate the mean of the bootstrap sample.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 a large number of times (e.g., 1000 or more) to create a distribution of bootstrap sample means.\n4. Calculate the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of bootstrap sample means. These percentiles represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the population mean exam score.\n\nSince we don't have the actual dataset, we can't perform the bootstrapping procedure. However, we can provide a general idea of what the confidence interval might look like based on the given mean and standard deviation.\n\nGiven a mean of 75 and a standard deviation of 10, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean exam score would likely fall within a range around the sample mean. The exact range would depend on the distribution of the bootstrap sample means obtained through the bootstrapping process."
