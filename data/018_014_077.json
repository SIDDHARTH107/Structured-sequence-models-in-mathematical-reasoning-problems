    "message_2": "To determine whether (A x B)' = A' x B' or not, we will first find the Cartesian product A x B, and then find its complement (A x B)'. After that, we will find the complements of A and B, i.e., A' and B', and then find their Cartesian product A' x B'. Finally, we will compare (A x B)' and A' x B' to see if they are equal.\n\nStep 1: Find A x B\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nStep 2: Find (A x B)'\n(A x B)' = {all possible pairs (x, y) not in A x B}\n(A x B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nStep 3: Find A' and B'\nLet's assume the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B.
