    "message_1": "Let M be the three-dimensional manifold defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1. Let the vector field V on M be defined by V = x∂/∂x + y∂/∂y. Determine the Lie derivative of V with respect to the vector field U = z∂/∂x + y^2∂/∂y - xz∂/∂z.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of V with respect to U, we use the Lie bracket of vector fields, denoted as [U, V]. The Lie bracket is defined as:\n\n[U, V] = UV - VU\n\nwhere UV and VU denote the action of U on V and V on U, respectively. We can compute the Lie bracket component-wise:\n\n[U, V]_x = U(V_x) - V(U_x) = U(x) - V(z) = z∂/∂x(x) - x∂/∂x(z) = z - 0 = z\n\n[U, V]_y = U(V_y) - V(U_y) = U(y) - V(y^2) = z∂/∂y(y) - y∂/∂y(y^2) = 0 - y = -y\n\n[U, V]_z = U(V_z) - V(U_z) = U(0) - V(-xz) = 0 - x∂/∂z(-xz) = 0 + x^2 = x^2\n\nSo, the Lie derivative of V with respect to U is:\n\nL_U(V) = [U, V] = z∂/∂x - y∂/∂y + x^2∂/∂z"
