    "message_2": "To find the temperature at 1:00pm, we need to calculate the temperature change from 12:00pm to 1:00pm.\n\nFrom 12:00pm to 1:00pm, the temperature increased at a rate of 0.5°C per hour. Since there is 1 hour between 12:00pm and 1:00pm, the temperature increased by 0.5°C * 1 hour = 0.5°C.\n\nThe temperature at 12:00pm was 22°C, so the temperature at 1:00pm would be 22°C + 0.5°C = 22.5°C."
