    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. Let Y(ω) be the Fourier transform of y(x), then the Fourier transform of y''(x) is (iω)^2 Y(ω) = -ω^2 Y(ω). Therefore, we have:\n\n-ω^2 Y(ω) + 4Y(ω) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) (-ω^2 + 4) = 0\n\nSince Y(ω) is not equal to 0, we have:\n\n-ω^2 + 4 = 0\n\nω^2 = 4\n\nω = ±2\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to obtain the solution y(x). Since the differential equation is linear and homogeneous, the solution will be a linear combination of the inverse Fourier transforms of the individual solutions:\n\ny(x) = A * e^(2ix) + B * e^(-2ix)\n\nNow, we can use the initial conditions to find the constants A and B:\n\ny(0) = 1 => A * e^(0) + B * e^(0) = A + B = 1\ny'(0) = 0 => 2iA - 2iB = 0 => A = B\n\nSince A + B = 1 and A = B, we have A = B = 1/2. Therefore, the solution is:\n\ny(x) = (1/2) * e^(2ix) + (1/2) * e^(-2ix)\n\nNow, we can find the value of y(x) at x = π/2:\n\ny(π/2) = (1/2) * e^(iπ) + (1/2) * e^(-iπ) = (1/2) * (-1) + (1/2) * (-1) = -1\n\nSo, the solution y(x) at x = π/2 is -1."
