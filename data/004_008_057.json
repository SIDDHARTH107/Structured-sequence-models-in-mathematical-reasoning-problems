    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x=2, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) and then evaluate it at x=2.\n\nThe function is f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 1.\n\nFirst, find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2 + 3x + 1)/dx = 4x + 3.\n\nNow, evaluate f'(x) at x=2:\n\nf'(2) = 4(2) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11.\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x=2 is 11."
