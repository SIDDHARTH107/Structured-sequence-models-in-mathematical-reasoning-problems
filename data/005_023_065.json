    "message_1": "Suppose that a class of 25 students took a math test, and their scores were as follows: \n\n{65, 78, 73, 80, 82, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 65, 68, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 77, 81, 83, 84}\n\nDetermine if there are any outliers in the data using the 1.5*IQR method.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n{65, 65, 68, 70, 71, 72, 73, 73, 74, 75, 77, 78, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100}\n\nNext, we need to find the first quartile (Q1), the second quartile (Q2 or the median), and the third quartile (Q3).\n\nSince there are 25 data points, the median (Q2) is the middle value, which is the 13th value: 80.\n\nFor Q1, we look at the lower half of the data (excluding the median): {65, 65, 68, 70, 71, 72, 73, 73, 74, 75, 77, 78}. The median of this lower half is the average of the 6th and 7th values: (72 + 73)/2 = 72.5.\n\nFor Q3, we look at the upper half of the data (excluding the median): {81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100}. The median of this upper half is the average of the 6th and 7th values: (85 + 90)/2 = 87.5.\n\nNow we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR): IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 87.5 - 72.5 = 15.\n\nNext, we find the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\n\nLower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 72.5 - 1.5 * 15 = 72.5 - 22.5 = 50\nUpper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 87.5 + 1.5 * 15 = 87.5 + 22.5 = 110\n\nNow we check if there are any data points outside of these bounds:\n\nAll the data points are within the range of 50 to 110, so there are no outliers in the data using the 1.5*IQR method."
