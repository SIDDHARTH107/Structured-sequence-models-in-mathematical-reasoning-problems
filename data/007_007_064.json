    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer value of x that satisfies the Diophantine equation 5x + 7y = 113, we can use the following method:\n\n1. Write the equation as 5x = 113 - 7y.\n2. We want to find the smallest positive integer x, so we need to find the smallest non-negative integer y such that 113 - 7y is divisible by 5.\n\nLet's try different values of y:\n\n- For y = 0, 113 - 7y = 113, which is not divisible by 5.\n- For y = 1, 113 - 7y = 106, which is not divisible by 5.\n- For y = 2, 113 - 7y = 99, which is not divisible by 5.\n- For y = 3, 113 - 7y = 92, which is not divisible by 5.\n- For y = 4, 113 - 7y = 85, which is divisible by 5.\n\nSo, the smallest non-negative integer y that satisfies the condition is y = 4. Now, we can find the corresponding value of x:\n\n5x = 113 - 7y = 113 - 7(4) = 113 - 28 = 85\nx = 85 / 5 = 17\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer value of x that satisfies the Diophantine equation 5x + 7y = 113 is x = 17."
