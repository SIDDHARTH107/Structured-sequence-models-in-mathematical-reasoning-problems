    "message_1": "Suppose that there are three bidders interested in buying a valuable item in an auction. Each bidder has a private valuation for the item, which represents the maximum amount they are willing to pay for it. The valuations are:\n\nBidder 1: $100\nBidder 2: $150\nBidder 3: $200\n\nAssume that the auction is a sealed-bid second-price auction, where the highest bidder wins the item and pays the second-highest bid amount. What is the optimal bid for each bidder and who wins the auction?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid second-price auction, the optimal strategy for each bidder is to bid their true valuation. This is because they will only pay the second-highest bid if they win, so there is no advantage in bidding higher than their valuation, and bidding lower could result in losing the auction even if their valuation is higher than the second-highest bid.\n\nSo, the optimal bids for each bidder are:\n\nBidder 1: $100\nBidder 2: $150\nBidder 3: $200\n\nSince Bidder 3 has the highest bid, they win the auction. They will pay the second-highest bid amount, which is $150."
