    "message_2": "The probability of an event not happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event happening. \n\nSo, the probability of Team A not scoring a goal is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4, and the probability of Team B not scoring a goal is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening (neither team scoring a goal), we multiply the probabilities of the individual events:\n\n0.4 (Team A not scoring) * 0.6 (Team B not scoring) = 0.24\n\nTherefore, the probability that neither team scores a goal is 0.24 or 24%."
