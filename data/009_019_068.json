    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE) and then compute the probability that the particle remains above the line $y=0$ up to time $t=1$.\n\nThe given SDE is a linear SDE with constant coefficients, which can be solved using the integrating factor method. Let's define the integrating factor $e^{kt}$, where $k$ is a constant to be determined. Multiplying both sides of the SDE by $e^{kt}$, we get:\n\n$$e^{kt} dX_t = -\\frac{1}{2} e^{kt} X_t dt + e^{kt} dW_t$$\n\nWe want to choose $k$ such that the left-hand side becomes an exact differential. To do this, we use Ito's lemma. Recall that for a function $G(t, X_t)$, Ito's lemma states that:\n\n$$dG(t, X_t) = \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial t} dt + \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial X_t} dX_t + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 G}{\\partial X_t^2} d[W_t]^2$$\n\nIn our case, we want to find $k$ such that $G(t, X_t) = e^{kt} X_t$ is an exact differential. Applying Ito's lemma to $G(t, X_t)$, we get:\n\n$$dG(t, X_t) = ke^{kt} X_t dt + e^{kt} dX_t + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0$$\n\nComparing this with the equation obtained by multiplying the SDE by $e^{kt}$, we see that we need to choose $k = -\\frac{1}{2}$ to make the left-hand side an exact differential. Thus, the integrating factor is $e^{-\\frac{1}{2}t}$, and we have:\n\n$$e^{-\\frac{1}{2}t} dX_t = -\\frac{1}{2} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}t} X_t dt + e^{-\\frac{1}{2}t} dW_t$$\n\nNow, integrating both sides from $0$ to $t$, we get:\n\n$$\\int_0^t e^{-\\frac{1}{2}s} dX_s = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^t e^{-\\frac{1}{2}s} X_s ds + \\int_0^t e^{-\\frac{1}{2}s} dW_s$$\n\nThe left-hand side is an exact differential, so we have:\n\n$$e^{-\\frac{1}{2}t} X_t - X_0 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^t e^{-\\frac{1}{2}s} X_s ds + \\int_0^t e^{-\\frac{1}{2}s} dW_s$$\n\nUsing the initial condition $X_0 = 1$, we can solve for $X_t$:\n\n$$X_t = e^{\\frac{1}{2}t} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^t e^{-\\frac{1}{2}s} X_s ds + \\int_0^t e^{-\\frac{1}{2}s} dW_s \\right)$$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $X_t > 0$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$. To do this, we can use the reflection principle for Brownian motion. Let $T = \\inf\\{t \\ge 0: X_t = 0\\}$ be the first time the particle hits the line $y=0$. Then, by the reflection principle, the process $Y_t = X_{t \\wedge T}$ is a Brownian motion with drift $+\\frac{1}{2}$ and initial position $Y_0 = 1$. \n\nThe probability that $X_t > 0$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$ is equal to the probability that $Y_t > 0$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$. By the reflection principle, this is equal to the probability that a standard Brownian motion $W_t$ starting at $1$ stays above the line $y=-\\frac{1}{2}$ up to time $t=1$. \n\nLet $Z_t = W_t + \\frac{1}{2}t$. Then $Z_t$ is a Brownian motion with drift $+\\frac{1}{2}$ and initial position $Z_0 = 1$. The probability that $W_t > -\\frac{1}{2}$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$ is equal to the probability that $Z_t > 0$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$. This is a well-known result for Brownian motion with drift, and the probability is given by:\n\n$$P(Z_t > 0 \\text{ for all } t \\in [0, 1]) = \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{Z_0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\approx 0.6827$$\n\nwhere erf is the error function. Therefore, the probability that the particle remains above the line $y=0$ up to time $t=1$ is approximately $0.6827$."
