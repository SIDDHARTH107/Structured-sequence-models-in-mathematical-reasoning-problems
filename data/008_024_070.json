    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, the elimination method seems more straightforward. \n\nFirst, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n\nNow we have two identical equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n2x + 3y = 7\n\nSince the two equations are the same, they represent the same line in the xy-plane. This means that there are infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line is a solution to the system. The system of equations is dependent, and we cannot find unique values for x and y."
