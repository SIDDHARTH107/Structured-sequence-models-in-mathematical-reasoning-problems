    "message_2": "In Pascal's triangle, the value of an element in the nth row and kth column can be found using the formula:\n\nC(n-1, k-1) = (n-1)! / [(k-1)! * (n-k)!]\n\nFor the 7th row and 4th column, we have n = 7 and k = 4. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3! * 3!)\n\nC(6, 3) = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / [(3 * 2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1)]\n\nC(6, 3) = (720) / (6 * 6)\n\nC(6, 3) = 720 / 36\n\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nSo, the value of the element in the 7th row and 4th column of Pascal's triangle is 20."
