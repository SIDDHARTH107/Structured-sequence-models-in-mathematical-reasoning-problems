    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for a math student to solve related to ElGamal encryption:\n\nSuppose that the shared prime modulus p is 19, the primitive root g is 2, and the private key is a = 5. The public key is generated as A = g^a (mod p). \n\nIf you receive the ciphertext (R, C) = (12, 18), where R is the random value selected by the sender and C is the encrypted message, what is the plaintext message m that was encrypted using ElGamal encryption?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the ElGamal ciphertext (R, C) = (12, 18), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the public key A:\nA = g^a (mod p)\nA = 2^5 (mod 19)\nA = 32 (mod 19)\nA = 13\n\n2. Compute the shared secret S:\nS = R^a (mod p)\nS = 12^5 (mod 19)\nS = 248832 (mod 19)\nS = 11\n\n3. Calculate the inverse of S (mod p), denoted as S_inv:\nS_inv * S ≡ 1 (mod p)\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the inverse of S (mod p). In this case, we have:\nS_inv = 7 (since 11 * 7 ≡ 1 (mod 19))\n\n4. Decrypt the message m:\nm = C * S_inv (mod p)\nm = 18 * 7 (mod 19)\nm = 126 (mod 19)\nm = 9\n\nSo, the plaintext message m that was encrypted using ElGamal encryption is 9."
