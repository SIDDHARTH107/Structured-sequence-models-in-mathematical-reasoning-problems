    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: type A and type B. Type A sells for $5 per unit and requires 2 hours of production time, while type B sells for $8 per unit and requires 3 hours of production time. The company has 100 production hours available, and wants to maximize its profit. Formulate and solve this as a multi-objective optimization problem. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first set up the objective function and constraints, and then use linear programming to find the optimal solution.\n\nLet x be the number of units of type A products and y be the number of units of type B products.\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 5x + 8y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Production time constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 100 (since there are 100 production hours available)\n2. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (since the company cannot produce negative units)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the profit P.\n\nGraphing the constraint 2x + 3y ≤ 100, we find that the feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 33.33), and (50, 0). We will evaluate the objective function at these vertices to find the maximum profit.\n\n1. At (0, 0): P = 5(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. At (0, 33.33): P = 5(0) + 8(33.33) = $266.64\n3. At (50, 0): P = 5(50) + 8(0) = $250\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 33.33), which corresponds to producing 0 units of type A products and 33.33 units of type B products. However, since the company cannot produce a fraction of a unit, it should produce 0 units of type A and 33 units of type B to maximize its profit. In this case, the maximum profit will be $264 (5(0) + 8(33))."
