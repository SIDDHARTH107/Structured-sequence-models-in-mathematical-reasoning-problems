    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A x B:\n\nA x B = {(1,0), (1,2), (1,4), (2,0), (2,2), (2,4), (3,0), (3,2), (3,4)}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of sets A and B. Since there is no universal set provided, we will assume the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B:\n\nU = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nA' = U - A = {0, 4}\nB' = U - B = {1, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A' and B':\n\nA' x B' = {(0,1), (0,3), (4,1), (4,3)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the Cartesian product A x B:\n\n(A x B)' = U² - (A x B)\n\nU² = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)}\n\n(A x B)' = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)}\n\nNow, let's compare (A x B)' and A' x B':\n\n(A x B)' = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)}\n\nA' x B' = {(0,1), (0,3), (4,1), (4,3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A x B)' ≠ A' x B'.
