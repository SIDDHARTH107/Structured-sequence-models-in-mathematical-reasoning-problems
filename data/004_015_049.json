    "message_2": "To find the inflection point of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 - 27x + 54, we need to find the second derivative of the function and then set it equal to zero to find the x-coordinate of the inflection point.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 - 27x + 54)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x - 27\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x - 27)\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nTo find the x-coordinate of the inflection point, we set the second derivative equal to zero:\n\n6x - 12 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nSo, the x-coordinate of the inflection point of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 - 27x + 54 is x = 2."
