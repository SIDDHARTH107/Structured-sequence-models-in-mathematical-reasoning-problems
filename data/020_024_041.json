    "message_1": "A company sells a certain product that costs $50 to produce. The company has found that it can sell the product at a price of $75 if it produces and sells 500 units per month. However, the demand for the product decreases by 5 units for every $1 increase in price. What is the optimal price the company should charge to maximize its profit, and how many units should the company produce and sell at that price to achieve the maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let P be the price of the product and Q be the quantity of products sold. We are given that the company can sell 500 units at a price of $75. We are also given that the demand decreases by 5 units for every $1 increase in price. Therefore, we can write the demand function as:\n\nQ = 500 - 5(P - 75)\n\nThe cost to produce each unit is $50, so the total cost (C) for producing Q units is:\n\nC = 50Q\n\nThe revenue (R) is the product of the price and the quantity sold:\n\nR = PQ\n\nThe profit (π) is the difference between the revenue and the cost:\n\nπ = R - C = PQ - 50Q\n\nNow, we need to find the price P that maximizes the profit. To do this, we will substitute the demand function into the profit function:\n\nπ = P(500 - 5(P - 75)) - 50(500 - 5(P - 75))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nπ = 500P - 5P(P - 75) - 25000 + 250(P - 75)\n\nExpand and combine like terms:\n\nπ = 500P - 5P^2 + 375P - 25000 + 250P - 18750\n\nπ = -5P^2 + 1125P - 43750\n\nTo find the optimal price, we need to find the maximum point of the profit function. This can be done by finding the derivative of the profit function with respect to P and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndπ/dP = -10P + 1125 = 0\n\nSolve for P:\n\nP = 1125 / 10 = 112.5\n\nNow, we need to find the quantity Q that corresponds to this price. Use the demand function:\n\nQ = 500 - 5(112.5 - 75)\n\nQ = 500 - 5(37.5)\n\nQ = 500 - 187.5\n\nQ = 312.5\n\nSince the company cannot produce and sell a fraction of a unit, we can round the quantity down to 312 units. The optimal price to charge is $112.5, and the company should produce and sell 312 units to achieve the maximum profit."
