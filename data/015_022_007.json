    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a time-delay differential equation given by:\n\ndy(t) / dt = β * y(t - τ) / (1 + y(t - τ)^n) - a * y(t)\n\nwhere β, τ, n, and a are parameters, and y(t) represents the value of the function at time t. The steady-state value is the value of y(t) as t approaches infinity, assuming that the system reaches a stable equilibrium.\n\nTo find the steady-state value, we need to solve the equation when dy(t) / dt = 0, which means the system is not changing anymore.\n\n0 = β * y(t - τ) / (1 + y(t - τ)^n) - a * y(t)\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate y(t):\n\na * y(t) = β * y(t - τ) / (1 + y(t - τ)^n)\n\nNow, since we're looking for the steady-state value, we can assume that y(t) = y(t - τ) = y_ss (steady-state value). This is because, at steady-state, the value of y(t) doesn't change over time.\n\na * y_ss = β * y_ss / (1 + y_ss^n)\n\nNow, we can solve for y_ss using the given parameter values:\n\n0.2 * y_ss = 0.1 * y_ss / (1 + y_ss^10)\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n0.2 * y_ss * (1 + y_ss^10) = 0.1 * y_ss\n\nDivide both sides by 0.1 * y_ss:\n\n2 * (1 + y_ss^10) = 1\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n1 + y_ss^10 = 0.5\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\ny_ss^10 = -0.5\n\nSince y_ss^10 cannot be negative, there is no real steady-state value for the given parameters. This means that the system does not reach a stable equilibrium with the given parameter values."
