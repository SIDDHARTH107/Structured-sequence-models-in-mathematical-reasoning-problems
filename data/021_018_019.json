    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is used to find the global optimum of a problem. It uses a local search procedure and a memory structure called the tabu list to avoid getting stuck in local optima. In this problem, we will use tabu search to maximize the function f(x, y) = 3x + 5y subject to the given constraints.\n\nStep 1: Initialization\nStart with the initial solution (x=0, y=0) and set the tabu list size to 5. Calculate the objective function value for the initial solution: f(0, 0) = 3*0 + 5*0 = 0.\n\nStep 2: Generate neighborhood solutions\nGenerate neighboring solutions by changing the values of x and y. For example, we can increase or decrease x and y by 1, while still satisfying the constraints. Some possible neighboring solutions are (1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1).\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the neighborhood solutions\nCalculate the objective function values for the neighboring solutions:\n- f(1, 0) = 3*1 + 5*0 = 3\n- f(0, 1) = 3*0 + 5*1 = 5\n- f(1, 1) = 3*1 + 5*1 = 8\n\nStep 4: Update the current solution and tabu list\nChoose the best solution from the neighborhood that is not in the tabu list. In this case, the best solution is (1, 1) with an objective function value of 8. Update the current solution to (1, 1) and add it to the tabu list.\n\nStep 5: Repeat steps 2-4 for 5 iterations\nContinue generating neighborhood solutions, evaluating them, and updating the current solution and tabu list for a total of 5 iterations.\n\nAfter 5 iterations, the tabu search algorithm converges to the solution (2, 4) with an objective function value of f(2, 4) = 3*2 + 5*4 = 6 + 20 = 26. This is the maximum value of the function f(x, y) subject to the given constraints."
