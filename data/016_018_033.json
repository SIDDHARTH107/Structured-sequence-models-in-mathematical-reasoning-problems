    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Cantor dust can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor dust, the initial line segment is divided into 3 equal parts, and the middle part is removed. So, there are N = 2 self-similar pieces, and the scaling factor r = 3.\n\nD = log(2) / log(3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nD â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust is approximately 0.63."
