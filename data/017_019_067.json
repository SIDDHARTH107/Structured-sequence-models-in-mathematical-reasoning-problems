    "message_2": "There are 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 36. Here is the list of all the non-isomorphic groups of order 36:\n\n1. C_36: The cyclic group of order 36.\n2. C_9 x C_4: The direct product of the cyclic groups of orders 9 and 4.\n3. C_3 x C_3 x C_4: The direct product of the cyclic groups of orders 3, 3, and 4.\n4. C_6 x C_6: The direct product of the cyclic groups of orders 6 and 6.\n\nTo justify why this list is complete, we can use the Sylow theorems. The order of a group G is 36, which can be factored as 2^2 * 3^2. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide the order of the group and satisfy certain congruences:\n\n- n_2 divides 3^2 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n- n_3 divides 2^2 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have the following possibilities:\n\n- n_2 = 1 or 3^1 or 3^2\n- n_3 = 1 or 2^1 or 2^2\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible structures of the groups based on these Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If n_2 = n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since both are normal, their direct product forms a group of order 36, which is the cyclic group C_36.\n\n2. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. The unique Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, and the group structure is C_9 x C_4.\n\n3. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. The unique Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, and the group structure is C_3 x C_3 x C_4.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, the group structure is C_6 x C_6.\n\nThese are all the possible non-isomorphic groups of order 36, and the list is complete."
