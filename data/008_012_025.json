    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2 |\n    | 5 -4 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 7 |\n    | 2 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (denoted as A^(-1)). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = (3 * -4) - (2 * 5) = -12 - 10 = -22\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere adj(A) is the adjugate of A, which is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors.\n\nadj(A) = | -4 -2 |\n         | -5  3 |\n\nA^(-1) = (-1/-22) * | -4 -2 |\n                    | -5  3 |\n\nA^(-1) = (1/22) * | -4 -2 |\n                 | -5  3 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 2/11  1/11 |\n         | 5/22  -3/22 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  2/11  1/11  | * | 7 |\n    |  5/22 -3/22 |   | 2 |\n\nX = | (2/11 * 7) + (1/11 * 2) |\n    | (5/22 * 7) - (3/22 * 2) |\n\nX = | 14/11 + 2/11 |\n    | 35/22 - 6/22 |\n\nX = | 16/11 |\n    | 29/22 |\n\nSo, the solution is x = 16/11 and y = 29/22."
