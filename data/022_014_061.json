    "message_2": "To find the harmonic conjugate of the function $f(z) = \\mathrm{Im}(z)$, we first need to find a function $g(z)$ such that $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are both harmonic and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations.\n\nLet $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. Then, $f(z) = \\mathrm{Im}(z) = y$. Now, we need to find a function $g(z)$ such that $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}$\n\nSince $f(z) = y$, we have:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 1$\n\nNow, we need to find a function $g(z)$ that satisfies these conditions. Let $g(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$, where $u$ and $v$ are real-valued functions. Then, the Cauchy-Riemann equations become:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 1$\n3. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -1$\n4. $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0$\n\nFrom equations (1) and (4), we see that $u$ and $v$ are independent of $x$. Thus, $u(x, y) = u(y)$ and $v(x, y) = v(y)$. Now, we can integrate equations (2) and (3) to find $u$ and $v$:\n\n1. $\\int \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} dy = \\int -1 dy \\implies u(y) = -y + C_1$\n2. $\\int \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} dy = \\int 1 dy \\implies v(y) = y + C_2$\n\nNow, we can write the harmonic conjugate $g(z)$ as:\n\n$g(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) = -y + C_1 + i(y + C_2) = -y + C_1 + iy + iC_2$\n\nSince the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ do not affect the harmonicity of the function, we can set them to zero for simplicity:\n\n$g(z) = -y + iy = i(x - y)$\n\nThus, the harmonic conjugate of the function $f(z) = \\mathrm{Im}(z)$ over the domain $D = \\{z\\in\\mathbb{C} : 1 < |z| < 2\\}$ is $g(z) = i(x - y)$."
