    "message_2": "Let S be a set with 3 elements, i.e., S = {a, b, c}. The power set of S, denoted as P(S), is the set of all possible subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself.\n\nTo find the cardinality of P(S), we can list all possible subsets of S:\n\n1. The empty set: {}\n2. Single-element subsets: {a}, {b}, {c}\n3. Two-element subsets: {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}\n4. The three-element subset: {a, b, c}\n\nIn total, there are 8 subsets in P(S), so the cardinality of P(S) is 8.\n\nNow, let's compare the cardinality of P(S) to the cardinality of S. The cardinality of S is 3, as it has 3 elements: a, b, and c.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the power set of S (P(S)) is 8, which is greater than the cardinality of S, which is 3.\n\nIn general, for a set S with n elements, the cardinality of its power set P(S) is 2^n. In this case, since S has 3 elements, the cardinality of P(S) is 2^3 = 8."
