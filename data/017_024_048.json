    "message_1": "Consider a group of order 96. How many non-abelian groups of order 96 exist? Can you list all the possible isomorphism types for such groups?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96, we first need to find all possible groups of order 96 and then eliminate the abelian ones. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3. Using the formula for the number of groups of a given order, we have:\n\nn(96) = n(2^5) * n(3) = 7 * 1 = 7\n\nThese 7 groups include both abelian and non-abelian groups. We can find the abelian groups using the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. The abelian groups of order 96 are:\n\n1. Z_96\n2. Z_2 x Z_48\n3. Z_3 x Z_32\n4. Z_6 x Z_16\n5. Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_24\n6. Z_2 x Z_4 x Z_12\n7. Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3\n\nOut of these 7 groups, 6 are abelian. Therefore, there is only 1 non-abelian group of order 96.\n\nThe possible isomorphism types for the non-abelian group of order 96 are:\n\n1. (Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_3\n\nHere, ⋊ denotes the semidirect product."
