    "message_2": "To find the value of the binomial coefficient (n choose k) for n = 7 and k = 3, we can use the formula:\n\n(n choose k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n! is the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nSo, for n = 7 and k = 3:\n\n(7 choose 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!)\n\n= 7! / (3!4!)\n\n= (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n\n= (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n\n= 210 / 6\n\n= 35\n\nThere are 35 ways to choose 3 items from a set of 7 items."
