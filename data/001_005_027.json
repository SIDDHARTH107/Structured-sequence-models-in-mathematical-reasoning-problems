    "message_2": "To find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0, we can use the factored form of the quadratic equation. We are looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to -5.\n\nThese two numbers are -2 and -3. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n\nNow, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\nx - 3 = 0 => x = 3\n\nSo, the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 are x = 2 and x = 3."
