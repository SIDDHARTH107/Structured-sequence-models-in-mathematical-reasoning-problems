    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products A and B. The profit earned by selling each unit of A is $5 while that of B is $8. The factory can produce a maximum of 500 units per day. The production of A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time while that of B requires 4 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time. The total daily labor and machine hours available are 1200 and 1100 respectively. How many units of A and B should the factory produce daily to maximize the profit? Use the firefly algorithm to solve the optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is based on the flashing behavior of fireflies. However, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute the firefly algorithm directly. Instead, I will guide you through the process of setting up the problem and provide you with a general idea of how to apply the firefly algorithm to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables and constraints:\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A produced daily.\nLet y be the number of units of product B produced daily.\n\nObjective function (profit to be maximized):\nP = 5x + 8y\n\nConstraints:\n1. x + y ≤ 500 (maximum units per day)\n2. 2x + 4y ≤ 1200 (total daily labor hours)\n3. 3x + 2y ≤ 1100 (total daily machine hours)\n4. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity)\n\nNow, to apply the firefly algorithm, follow these general steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of fireflies with random positions (x, y) within the feasible region.\n2. Define the attractiveness and brightness of each firefly based on the objective function value (profit).\n3. Update the positions of the fireflies by moving less attractive (lower profit) fireflies towards more attractive (higher profit) fireflies.\n4. Apply randomness to the movement of fireflies to avoid getting stuck in local optima.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for a predefined number of iterations or until convergence is achieved.\n6. The firefly with the highest attractiveness (profit) will provide the optimal solution (x, y) for the problem.\n\nAfter applying the firefly algorithm, you will obtain the optimal number of units of products A and B that the factory should produce daily to maximize the profit. Note that implementing the firefly algorithm requires programming skills and the use of a suitable programming language or software."
