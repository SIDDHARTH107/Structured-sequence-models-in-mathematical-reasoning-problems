The temperature of the edges of the plate remains fixed at 0 degrees Celsius. Use complex analysis techniques to find the temperature distribution at any point in the plate.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution at any point in the plate, we can use the method of conformal mapping in complex analysis. The idea is to map the given rectangular region to a simpler region (like a unit circle) where the temperature distribution is known, and then map back to the original region.\n\nLet's consider the complex plane, where the rectangular plate is represented by the rectangle with vertices at 0, 2, 4+2i, and 4+4i. We want to find a conformal mapping that maps this rectangle to the upper half of the unit circle.\n\nWe can use the following conformal mapping:\n\nf(z) = (1/π) * sin(πz/2)\n\nThis maps the rectangle to the upper half of the unit circle. Now, we can find the temperature distribution in the upper half of the unit circle. In polar coordinates, the temperature distribution in the upper half of the unit circle can be represented as:\n\nT(r, θ) = 100 * (1 - r^2) for 0 ≤ θ ≤ π\n\nNow, we need to map this temperature distribution back to the rectangular region using the inverse of the conformal mapping:\n\nf^(-1)(w) = (2/π) * arcsin(πw)\n\nLet w = u + iv, then z = x + iy, where u = (1/π) * sin(πx/2) * cosh(πy/2) and v = (1/π) * cos(πx/2) * sinh(πy/2).\n\nNow, we can express the temperature distribution T(x, y) in the rectangular region as:\n\nT(x, y) = 100 * (1 - (u^2 + v^2))\n\nSubstituting the expressions for u and v, we get:\n\nT(x, y) = 100 * (1 - (1/π^2) * (sin^2(πx/2) * cosh^2(πy/2) + cos^2(πx/2) * sinh^2(πy/2)))\n\nThis is the temperature distribution at any point (x, y) in the rectangular metal plate."
