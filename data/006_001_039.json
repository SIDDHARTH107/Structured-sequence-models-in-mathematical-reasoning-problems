    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least 30 heads in 50 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (heads) in n trials (flips)\n- nCk (read \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (getting tails) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n is the number of trials (50 coin flips)\n- k is the number of successes (heads) we want to find the probability for\n\nSince we want to find the probability of getting at least 30 heads, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for getting exactly 30, 31, 32, ..., 50 heads. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nP(X ≥ 30) = P(X = 30) + P(X = 31) + ... + P(X = 50)\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate each term in the sum:\n\nP(X = k) = (50Ck) * (0.5^k) * (0.5^(50-k))\n\nand then sum up the probabilities for k = 30, 31, ..., 50.\n\nCalculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 30) ≈ 0.0985\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 30 heads in 50 coin flips is approximately 9.85%."
