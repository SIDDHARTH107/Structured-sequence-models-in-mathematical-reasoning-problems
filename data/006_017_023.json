    "message_2": "To find the expected number of accidents, we can multiply the probability of an accident occurring by the number of vehicles passing through the road.\n\nExpected number of accidents = Probability of an accident * Number of vehicles\nExpected number of accidents = 0.25 * 5000\nExpected number of accidents = 1250\n\nSo, the expected number of accidents that will occur on the road in a day is 1250."
