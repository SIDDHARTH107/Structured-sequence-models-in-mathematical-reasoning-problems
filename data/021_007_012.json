    "message_1": "Sure! Here's an example problem for a math student to solve using the Newton-Raphson method for solving nonlinear equations: \n\nUsing the Newton-Raphson method, find an approximate solution to the equation x³ + 2x - 5 = 0, with an initial guess of x0 = 1.5. Round your answer to four decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the given function. The function is f(x) = x³ + 2x - 5, so its derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x² + 2\n\nNow, we will apply the Newton-Raphson formula:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nOur initial guess is x0 = 1.5. Let's plug this into the formula:\n\nf(1.5) = (1.5)³ + 2(1.5) - 5 = 3.375\nf'(1.5) = 3(1.5)² + 2 = 11.5\n\nx1 = 1.5 - (3.375 / 11.5) ≈ 1.2065\n\nNow, we can use x1 as our new guess and repeat the process:\n\nf(1.2065) ≈ 0.2455\nf'(1.2065) ≈ 6.4583\n\nx2 = 1.2065 - (0.2455 / 6.4583) ≈ 1.1656\n\nWe can continue this process until we reach the desired level of accuracy. In this case, we want to round our answer to four decimal places:\n\nf(1.1656) ≈ 0.0098\nf'(1.1656) ≈ 5.9488\n\nx3 = 1.1656 - (0.0098 / 5.9488) ≈ 1.1644\n\nSince the difference between x2 and x3 is less than 0.0001, we can stop here. The approximate solution to the equation x³ + 2x - 5 = 0, with an initial guess of x0 = 1.5, is x ≈ 1.1644, rounded to four decimal places."
