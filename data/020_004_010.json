    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: chairs and tables. The profit per chair is $20 and the profit per table is $30. The company has a daily production capacity of 120 units and a weekly production capacity of 600 units. In order to maintain balance in the production line, they want to ensure that the number of chairs manufactured is at least half the number of tables manufactured. Use quadratic programming to determine the number of chairs and tables the company should produce daily in order to maximize their profit.\n\nFormulate the problem with the objective function, constraints, and decision variables, and solve it to find the optimal daily production plan.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced daily.\n\nObjective function (to maximize profit):\nP = 20x + 30y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Daily production capacity: x + y ≤ 120\n2. Weekly production capacity: 7(x + y) ≤ 600\n3. Chairs should be at least half the number of tables: x ≥ 0.5y\n\nDecision variables:\nx, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will solve this problem using quadratic programming.\n\nFirst, we will rewrite the constraints in the standard form:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 120\n2. 7x + 7y ≤ 600\n3. x - 0.5y ≥ 0\n\nDivide the second constraint by 7:\nx + y ≤ 85.71 (approximately)\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by plotting these constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 120\n2. x + y = 85.71\n3. x = 0.5y\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices A(0, 85.71), B(0, 120), C(60, 60), and D(85.71, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 20x + 30y at each vertex:\n\nA(0, 85.71): P = 20(0) + 30(85.71) = 2571.3\nB(0, 120): P = 20(0) + 30(120) = 3600\nC(60, 60): P = 20(60) + 30(60) = 3000\nD(85.71, 0): P = 20(85.71) + 30(0) = 1714.2\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex B(0, 120) with a profit of $3600. Therefore, the company should produce 0 chairs and 120 tables daily to maximize their profit."
