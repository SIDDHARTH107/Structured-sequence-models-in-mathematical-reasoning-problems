    "message_2": "To find the image of the circle $|z-1|=2$ under the mapping $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z-3}$, we first need to find the inverse of the function $f(z)$.\n\nLet $w = f(z) = \\frac{1}{z-3}$. Then, we can write $z$ in terms of $w$ as follows:\n\n$z = \\frac{1}{w} + 3$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $z$ into the equation of the circle:\n\n$| \\frac{1}{w} + 3 - 1 | = 2$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$| \\frac{1}{w} + 2 | = 2$\n\nNow, we want to find the image of the circle in the $w$-plane. To do this, we can rewrite the equation in terms of $w$:\n\n$| \\frac{1}{w} + 2 - 2 | = | \\frac{1}{w} | = 2$\n\nNow, we can solve for $w$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{w} = 2$\n\n$w = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, the image of the circle $|z-1|=2$ under the mapping $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z-3}$ is a circle with radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ centered at the origin in the $w$-plane.\n\nTo sketch the resulting figure, draw a circle with radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ centered at the origin."
