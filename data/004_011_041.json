    "message_1": "A spotlight on a vertical wall is 10 meters away from the wall, and the light is shining on a person standing next to the wall. If the person is walking away from the wall at a speed of 1.5 meters per second, how fast is the height of the person's shadow on the wall decreasing when she is 8 meters from the spotlight? (Assume the person is 2 meters tall and the light is positioned to shine directly on her at all times.)",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance between the person and the wall as x, the distance between the person and the spotlight as y, and the height of the shadow on the wall as h. We are given that the spotlight is 10 meters away from the wall, the person is walking away from the wall at a speed of 1.5 meters per second, and the person is 2 meters tall.\n\nWe can use similar triangles to relate the height of the shadow to the distance between the person and the wall. The triangles are formed by the person, the shadow, and the spotlight. The height of the person (2 meters) is to the height of the shadow (h) as the distance between the person and the wall (x) is to the distance between the spotlight and the wall (10 meters):\n\n2/h = x/10\n\nWe want to find dh/dt, the rate at which the height of the shadow is decreasing when the person is 8 meters away from the spotlight (y = 8). To do this, we first need to find the relationship between x and y. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2\nx^2 = 100 - y^2\n\nNow we can differentiate both sides with respect to time t:\n\n2x(dx/dt) = -2y(dy/dt)\n\nWe are given that dy/dt = -1.5 m/s (the person is walking away from the wall) and y = 8 m. We can find x when y = 8:\n\nx^2 = 100 - 8^2\nx^2 = 36\nx = 6\n\nNow we can plug in the values for x, y, and dy/dt into the equation we derived:\n\n2(6)(dx/dt) = -2(8)(-1.5)\n12(dx/dt) = 24\ndx/dt = 2 m/s\n\nNow that we have dx/dt, we can find dh/dt. Rearrange the similar triangles equation to solve for h:\n\nh = 20/x\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to time t:\n\ndh/dt = -20/x^2 (dx/dt)\n\nPlug in the values for x and dx/dt:\n\ndh/dt = -20/(6^2) * 2\ndh/dt = -20/36 * 2\ndh/dt = -10/18\n\nSo, the height of the person's shadow on the wall is decreasing at a rate of 10/18 meters per second, or approximately 0.56 m/s, when she is 8 meters away from the spotlight."
