    "message_2": "To find the intersection of the Cartesian products A x B and B x A, we need to find the elements that are common in both products.\n\nLet A = {a1, a2, a3, a4} and B = {b1, b2, b3}.\n\nA x B will have elements in the form (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, A x B = {(a1, b1), (a1, b2), (a1, b3), (a2, b1), (a2, b2), (a2, b3), (a3, b1), (a3, b2), (a3, b3), (a4, b1), (a4, b2), (a4, b3)}.\n\nB x A will have elements in the form (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A. So, B x A = {(b1, a1), (b1, a2), (b1, a3), (b1, a4), (b2, a1), (b2, a2), (b2, a3), (b2, a4), (b3, a1), (b3, a2), (b3, a3), (b3, a4)}.\n\nNow, we need to find the elements that are common in both A x B and B x A. However, since the elements in A x B are in the form (a, b) and the elements in B x A are in the form (b, a), there are no common elements between the two Cartesian products.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements in the intersection of the Cartesian products A x B and B x A is 0."
