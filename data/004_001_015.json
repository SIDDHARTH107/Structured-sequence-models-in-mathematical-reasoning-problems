    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5, we will first find the derivative with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is given by:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation (d(x^n)/dx = nx^(n-1)), we get:\n\nf'(x) = 4 * 3x^(4-1) - 2 * 2x^(2-1)\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 4x\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 12(2)^3 - 4(2)\n\nf'(2) = 12(8) - 8\n\nf'(2) = 96 - 8\n\nf'(2) = 88\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5 at x = 2 is 88."
