    "message_1": "Consider a juice company that produces apple and orange juice. The company has 4000 apples and 3000 oranges. To make a bottle of apple juice, it requires 3 apples and to make a bottle of orange juice it requires 2 oranges. The profit per bottle of apple juice is $6 and the profit per bottle of orange juice is $5. The company wants to maximize its profit. How many bottles of each type of juice should the company produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of bottles of apple juice and y be the number of bottles of orange juice.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. The number of apples used: 3x ≤ 4000\n2. The number of oranges used: 2y ≤ 3000\n3. The number of bottles produced must be non-negative: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe company wants to maximize its profit, which can be represented by the objective function:\n\nProfit = 6x + 5y\n\nFirst, we will solve the inequalities to find the feasible region:\n\n1. 3x ≤ 4000 => x ≤ 4000/3 ≈ 1333.33\n2. 2y ≤ 3000 => y ≤ 3000/2 = 1500\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will check the corner points of the feasible region to find the maximum profit:\n\n1. (x, y) = (0, 0): Profit = 6(0) + 5(0) = $0\n2. (x, y) = (1333, 0): Profit = 6(1333) + 5(0) = $7998\n3. (x, y) = (0, 1500): Profit = 6(0) + 5(1500) = $7500\n4. (x, y) = (1333, 1500) is not in the feasible region since it would require more apples and oranges than available.\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (1333, 0), which means the company should produce 1333 bottles of apple juice and 0 bottles of orange juice. The maximum profit would be $7998."
