    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector u onto vector v, we can use the formula:\n\nprojection of u onto v = (u • v) / ||v||\n\nwhere (u • v) is the dot product of u and v, and ||v|| is the magnitude of vector v.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of u and v:\n\nu • v = (3 * 5) + (-4 * 2) = 15 - 8 = 7\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of vector v:\n\n||v|| = √(5^2 + 2^2) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\nNow, we can find the projection of u onto v:\n\nprojection of u onto v = (u • v) / ||v|| = 7 / √29\n\nThe magnitude of the projection of u onto v is 7 / √29."
