    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x, we first need to find its derivative, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points.\n\n3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can either factor it or use the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring is not straightforward, so we'll use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 3, b = -6, and c = 2.\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(3)(2))) / (2(3))\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 24)) / 6\nx = (6 ± √12) / 6\n\nNow, we can simplify the square root:\n\n√12 = √(4 * 3) = 2√3\n\nSo, the critical points are:\n\nx = (6 ± 2√3) / 6\n\nx = 1 + √3/3 (approximately 1.577)\nx = 1 - √3/3 (approximately 0.423)\n\nThus, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x are x ≈ 1.577 and x ≈ 0.423."
