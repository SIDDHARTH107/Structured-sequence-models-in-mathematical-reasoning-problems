    "message_2": "To find the probability of winning all three games in a row, we need to multiply the probability of winning each individual game together.\n\nThe probability of winning each game is 75%, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.75.\n\nSo, the probability of winning all three games in a row is:\n\n0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.421875\n\nAs a percentage, this is approximately 42.19%."
