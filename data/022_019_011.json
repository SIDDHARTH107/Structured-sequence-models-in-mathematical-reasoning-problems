    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral ∫C f(z) dz, we can use Cauchy's integral theorem, which states that if a function is analytic (holomorphic) in a simply connected domain containing a curve C, then the integral of the function over the curve is zero.\n\nThe function f(z) = z^3 - 2z^2 + 3z - 4 is a polynomial, and polynomials are holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is holomorphic in the domain containing the circle C.\n\nSince f(z) is holomorphic in the domain containing C, we can apply Cauchy's integral theorem:\n\n∫C f(z) dz = 0"
