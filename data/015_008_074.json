    "message_2": "The Feigenbaum constant (Î´) is a universal constant that describes the ratio of the difference between consecutive bifurcation points in a period-doubling route to chaos. It is approximately equal to 4.6692016091.\n\nHowever, the Feigenbaum constant does not depend on the specific value of the control parameter \"r\" in the logistic map. It is a universal constant that applies to any one-dimensional map with a quadratic maximum, such as the logistic map.\n\nTo clarify, the logistic map is given by the equation:\n\nx_n+1 = r * x_n * (1 - x_n)\n\nwhere x_n is the population at generation n, and r is the control parameter.\n\nThe Feigenbaum constant describes the period-doubling bifurcations, but it does not depend on the specific value of \"r\". So, even if \"r\" is equal to 3.678, the Feigenbaum constant remains the same, approximately 4.6692016091."
