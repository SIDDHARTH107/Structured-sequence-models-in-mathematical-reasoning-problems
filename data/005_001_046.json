    "message_2": "To determine if a coin is fair or not, we will perform a hypothesis test. \n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The coin is fair, meaning the probability of getting heads is 0.5.\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The coin is not fair, meaning the probability of getting heads is not 0.5.\n\nWe will use a significance level of 0.05 (α = 0.05) for this test.\n\nTo perform the test, we will use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution since we have a large sample size (n = 100). We will calculate the z-score and compare it to the critical value.\n\nFirst, let's find the sample proportion of heads (p-hat) and the expected proportion of heads under the null hypothesis (p0):\n\np-hat = (number of heads) / (total flips) = 56 / 100 = 0.56\np0 = 0.5 (since we assume the coin is fair under the null hypothesis)\n\nNow, let's calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = sqrt(p0 * (1 - p0) / n) = sqrt(0.5 * (1 - 0.5) / 100) = sqrt(0.25 / 100) = 0.05\n\nNext, we will calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (p-hat - p0) / SE = (0.56 - 0.5) / 0.05 = 1.2\n\nNow, we will compare the z-score to the critical value. Since we have a two-tailed test (we are testing if the coin is not fair, which means the probability of heads could be either greater or less than 0.5), we will use the critical value for α/2 = 0.025. From the standard normal distribution table, the critical value for 0.025 in each tail is approximately ±1.96.\n\nOur z-score (1.2) is less than the critical value (1.96), so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. \n\nConclusion: At a significance level of 0.05, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the coin is fair."
