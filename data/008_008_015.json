The production of each product requires time on two machines, Machine X and Machine Y. Each machine has a limited number of hours per day available for production. It takes 2 hours on Machine X and 3 hours on Machine Y to produce one unit of Product A. It takes 4 hours on Machine X and 2 hours on Machine Y to produce one unit of Product B. Machine X is available for 60 hours per day and Machine Y is available for 70 hours per day. The profit for Product A is $10 per unit and the profit for Product B is $15 per unit. How many units of each product should the company produce each day to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the machines' available hours are:\n2x + 4y ≤ 60 (Machine X)\n3x + 2y ≤ 70 (Machine Y)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\nFor Machine X:\n2x + 4y ≤ 60\nx + 2y ≤ 30\ny ≤ (30 - x) / 2\n\nFor Machine Y:\n3x + 2y ≤ 70\ny ≤ (70 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the boundary lines:\n\n1) Intersection of Machine X and Machine Y constraints:\nx + 2y = 30\n3x + 2y = 70\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\nx = 20\ny = 5\n\n2) Intersection of Machine X constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\nx + 2y = 30\ny = 15\n\n3) Intersection of Machine Y constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n3x + 2y = 70\nx = 70/3 ≈ 23.33 (since x must be an integer, we round down to 23)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P at each vertex:\n\n1) P(20, 5) = 10(20) + 15(5) = 200 + 75 = $275\n2) P(0, 15) = 10(0) + 15(15) = 0 + 225 = $225\n3) P(23, 0) = 10(23) + 15(0) = 230 + 0 = $230\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (20, 5), so the company should produce 20 units of Product A and 5 units of Product B each day to maximize their profit at $275 per day."
