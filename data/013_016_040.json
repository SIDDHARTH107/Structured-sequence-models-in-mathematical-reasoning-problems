    "message_1": "A company wants to offer a new project to an investor. The investor can either invest $100,000 or $300,000 into the project. If the project is successful, the investor will receive a return of $200,000. If the project fails, the investor will receive nothing. However, the company can also choose to take on a riskier version of the project that requires a $300,000 investment but has the potential to earn a return of $400,000. If the investor chooses to invest $100,000, the company will choose the safer project. If the investor chooses to invest $300,000, the company will choose the riskier project.\n\nAssuming both the company and the investor are rational and risk-averse, what is the expected return for the investor if they invest $100,000? What is the expected return if they invest $300,000? Should the investor invest $100,000 or $300,000 to maximize their expected return?",
    "message_2": "To determine the expected return for the investor, we need to know the probabilities of success and failure for both the safer and riskier projects. Let's assume the probability of success for the safer project is Ps and for the riskier project is Pr. \n\nIf the investor invests $100,000, the company will choose the safer project. The expected return for the investor in this case would be:\n\nExpected Return (Invest $100,000) = (Ps * $200,000) + ((1 - Ps) * $0)\n\nIf the investor invests $300,000, the company will choose the riskier project. The expected return for the investor in this case would be:\n\nExpected Return (Invest $300,000) = (Pr * $400,000) + ((1 - Pr) * $0)\n\nTo determine which investment option maximizes the expected return for the investor, we need to compare the expected returns for both options. If the expected return for investing $100,000 is greater than the expected return for investing $300,000, the investor should invest $100,000. If the expected return for investing $300,000 is greater than the expected return for investing $100,000, the investor should invest $300,000.\n\nHowever, without knowing the probabilities of success for both projects, we cannot definitively determine which investment option maximizes the expected return for the investor."
