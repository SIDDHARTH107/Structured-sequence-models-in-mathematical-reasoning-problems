    "message_2": "A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. If a number is a multiple of 7, it means that it has 7 as one of its divisors. Therefore, it cannot be a prime number since it would have at least three divisors: 1, 7, and itself. Consequently, there is no 5-digit prime number that is a multiple of 7."
