    "message_1": "A company has two factories that produce the same product. Factory A can produce 200 units per day, while Factory B can produce 300 units per day. The company has a demand of 400 units per day. Each unit produced at Factory A incurs a cost of $5, while each unit produced at Factory B incurs a cost of $7. How many units should the company produce at each factory to minimize the production cost while meeting the demand?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units produced at Factory A and y be the number of units produced at Factory B. We need to minimize the total cost, which is given by the equation:\n\nCost = 5x + 7y\n\nWe also know that the total production must meet the demand of 400 units per day:\n\nx + y = 400\n\nWe can solve for y in terms of x:\n\ny = 400 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the cost equation:\n\nCost = 5x + 7(400 - x)\n\nCost = 5x + 2800 - 7x\n\nCost = -2x + 2800\n\nSince Factory A has a lower cost per unit, we want to produce as many units as possible at Factory A without exceeding its capacity. Factory A can produce a maximum of 200 units per day, so we set x = 200:\n\ny = 400 - 200 = 200\n\nSo, to minimize the production cost while meeting the demand, the company should produce 200 units at Factory A and 200 units at Factory B."
