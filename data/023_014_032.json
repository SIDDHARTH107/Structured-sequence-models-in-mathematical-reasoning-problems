    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-2|x|), we need to compute the integral:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-2|x|) * e^(-ikx)] dx from -∞ to +∞\n\nSince the function is even, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nF(k) = 2 * ∫[e^(-2x) * cos(kx)] dx from 0 to +∞\n\nNow, we can integrate by parts:\n\nLet u = e^(-2x) and dv = cos(kx) dx\nThen du = -2e^(-2x) dx and v = (1/k)sin(kx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\nF(k) = 2 * [(1/k)e^(-2x)sin(kx) - (1/k^2)∫e^(-2x)sin(kx) dx] from 0 to +∞\n\nNow, we need to integrate the second term again by parts:\n\nLet u = e^(-2x) and dv = sin(kx) dx\nThen du = -2e^(-2x) dx and v = (-1/k)cos(kx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula again:\n\n(1/k^2)∫e^(-2x)sin(kx) dx = (-1/k^3)e^(-2x)cos(kx) - (2/k^3)∫e^(-2x)cos(kx) dx from 0 to +∞\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for F(k):\n\nF(k) = 2 * [(1/k)e^(-2x)sin(kx) - (1/k^2)(-1/k^3)e^(-2x)cos(kx) - (2/k^3)∫e^(-2x)cos(kx) dx] from 0 to +∞\n\nNotice that the last term is the same as the original integral. Let's call it I:\n\nI = ∫e^(-2x)cos(kx) dx from 0 to +∞\n\nNow we have:\n\nF(k) = 2 * [(1/k)e^(-2x)sin(kx) - (1/k^2)(-1/k^3)e^(-2x)cos(kx) - (2/k^3)I] from 0 to +∞\n\nNow, we can solve for I:\n\nI = (1/k^3)e^(-2x)cos(kx) - (1/k^4)e^(-2x)sin(kx) + (2/k^3)I\n\nRearrange the terms to isolate I:\n\nI(1 - 2/k^3) = (1/k^3)e^(-2x)cos(kx) - (1/k^4)e^(-2x)sin(kx)\n\nNow, divide both sides by (1 - 2/k^3):\n\nI = [(1/k^3)e^(-2x)cos(kx) - (1/k^4)e^(-2x)sin(kx)] / (1 - 2/k^3)\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform F(k):\n\nF(k) = 2 * I = 2 * [(1/k^3)e^(-2x)cos(kx) - (1/k^4)e^(-2x)sin(kx)] / (1 - 2/k^3)\n\nNow, let's find the probability of finding a particle in a position x between -∞ and +∞ in quantum mechanics. The probability density function is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function, which is the inverse Fourier transform of F(k):\n\nP(x) = |f(x)|^2 = |e^(-2|x|)|^2 = e^(-4|x|)\n\nTo find the probability of finding the particle between -∞ and +∞, we need to integrate the probability density function over that range:\n\nP = ∫[e^(-4|x|)] dx from -∞ to +∞\n\nSince the function is even, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nP = 2 * ∫[e^(-4x)] dx from 0 to +∞\n\nIntegrate:\n\nP = 2 * [-1/4 * e^(-4x)] from 0 to +∞\n\nEvaluate the integral:\n\nP = 2 * [-1/4 * (0 - 1)] = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability of finding the particle in a position x between -∞ and +∞ is 1/2."
