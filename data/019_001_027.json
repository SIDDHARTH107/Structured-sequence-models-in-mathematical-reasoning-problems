    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of r, we need to evaluate the compound proposition r = (p ∧ ¬q) ∨ (¬p ∧ q) using the given values of p and q.\n\nGiven that p is true (1) and q is false (0), we have:\n\n¬p = not p = not true = false (0)\n¬q = not q = not false = true (1)\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the compound proposition:\n\nr = (p ∧ ¬q) ∨ (¬p ∧ q)\nr = (1 ∧ 1) ∨ (0 ∧ 0)\n\nUsing the rules of conjunction (AND) and disjunction (OR):\n\n1 ∧ 1 = 1 (true)\n0 ∧ 0 = 0 (false)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nr = 1 ∨ 0\n\nUsing the rule of disjunction (OR):\n\n1 ∨ 0 = 1 (true)\n\nTherefore, the truth value of the compound proposition r is 1 (true)."
