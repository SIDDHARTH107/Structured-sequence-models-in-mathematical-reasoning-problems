    "message_1": "In the Traveler's Dilemma game, two travelers each declare a whole number between 0 and 100. The traveler with the lower number gets paid the amount he declared, but the traveler with the higher number gets paid $2 less than the amount he declared. If both travelers declare the same number, they each get paid that number. What number should each traveler declare to maximize their payout?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their payout, both travelers should declare the number 2. Here's the reasoning:\n\nIf one traveler declares 100, the other traveler would declare 99, and the first traveler would only get 98. If the first traveler declares 99, the second traveler would declare 98, and the first traveler would only get 97. This pattern continues all the way down to the number 2.\n\nIf both travelers declare 2, they both get paid $2. If either traveler declares 1, they would only get $1, while the other traveler would get $2. Therefore, declaring 2 is the best strategy for both travelers to maximize their payout, as it is the Nash equilibrium in this game."
