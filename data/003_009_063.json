    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to determine the length of the third side. Since we have an angle and the lengths of the two sides adjacent to it, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, we have:\na = 5 cm\nb = 7 cm\nC = 60 degrees\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\nC (in radians) = (60 * π) / 180 = π / 3\n\nNow, we can apply the Law of Cosines:\n\nc² = 5² + 7² - 2 * 5 * 7 * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 25 + 49 - 70 * (1/2)\nc² = 74 - 35\nc² = 39\n\nNow, we find the square root to get the length of side c:\nc = √39 ≈ 6.24 cm\n\nFinally, we can find the perimeter by adding the lengths of all three sides:\nPerimeter = a + b + c = 5 + 7 + 6.24 ≈ 18.24 cm"
