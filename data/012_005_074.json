    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. In other words, it is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices.\n\nIn order to find the diameter of this graph, we need to consider the possible structures of the graph. Since there are 7 vertices and 10 edges, we know that the graph is connected (otherwise, there would be fewer edges).\n\nThe maximum number of edges in a complete graph with 7 vertices is given by the formula:\n\nEdges = n(n-1)/2 = 7(7-1)/2 = 21\n\nSince we have 10 edges, the graph is not complete. However, we can still try to minimize the diameter by connecting the vertices in a way that creates the shortest possible paths between them.\n\nOne way to do this is to create a \"star\" structure, where one central vertex is connected to all other vertices. In this case, the diameter would be 2, as any two non-central vertices would have to pass through the central vertex to reach each other.\n\nHowever, since we have 10 edges, we can further connect some of the outer vertices to each other, creating a more connected graph. For example, we can connect three pairs of outer vertices, leaving one unconnected. This would result in a graph with a diameter of 2, as any two vertices would either be directly connected or connected through the central vertex.\n\nIn conclusion, the diameter of the given undirected graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges is 2."
