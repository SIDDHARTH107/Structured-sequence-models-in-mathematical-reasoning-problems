    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(3,3) is the smallest number of vertices that a graph must have in order to guarantee that either a complete graph of size 3 (a triangle) or an independent set of size 3 exists within the graph. The Ramsey number R(3,3) is 6.\n\nTo see why, consider a graph with 5 vertices. It is possible to construct a graph such that no complete graph of size 3 or independent set of size 3 exists. This can be done by creating a cycle of length 5, where each vertex is connected to its two neighbors but not to the other two vertices. In this graph, there are no triangles and no independent sets of size 3.\n\nNow, consider a graph with 6 vertices. Pick any vertex, and consider its 5 neighbors. By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least 3 of these neighbors must either be connected to the chosen vertex by an edge (forming a triangle) or not connected to the chosen vertex by an edge (forming an independent set). Thus, in a graph with 6 vertices, it is guaranteed that either a complete graph of size 3 or an independent set of size 3 exists. Therefore, the Ramsey number R(3,3) is 6."
