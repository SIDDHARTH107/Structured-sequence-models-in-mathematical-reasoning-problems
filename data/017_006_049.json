    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either a cyclic group or the direct product of two cyclic groups, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nRecall that the order of G is 35, which can be factored as 5 * 7. By the Sylow theorems, there exist Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups of G. Let's denote the number of Sylow 5-subgroups as n_5 and the number of Sylow 7-subgroups as n_7.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we have the following conditions:\n\n1. n_5 divides 7 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_7 divides 5 and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nFrom condition 1, we see that n_5 must be 1 or 7. However, since n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5), n_5 must be 1. Similarly, from condition 2, we see that n_7 must be 1 or 5, and since n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7), n_7 must be 1.\n\nNow, let P_5 and P_7 be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup and Sylow 7-subgroup of G, respectively. Since n_5 = n_7 = 1, both P_5 and P_7 are normal subgroups of G. Furthermore, the orders of P_5 and P_7 are 5 and 7, respectively, which are both prime numbers.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in P_5 is either 1 or 5, and the order of any element in P_7 is either 1 or 7. Since the orders of P_5 and P_7 are prime, they must be cyclic groups.\n\nNow, let x be an element of order 5 in P_5 and y be an element of order 7 in P_7. Then, the order of the element (x, y) in the direct product group P_5 × P_7 is the least common multiple of 5 and 7, which is 35. Since the order of (x, y) is equal to the order of G, the direct product group P_5 × P_7 is a cyclic group of order 35.\n\nSince P_5 and P_7 are both normal subgroups of G, their direct product P_5 × P_7 is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the order of P_5 × P_7 is 35, which is equal to the order of G, we have G = P_5 × P_7. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups, as desired."
