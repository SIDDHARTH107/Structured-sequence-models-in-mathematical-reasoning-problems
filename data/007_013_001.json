    "message_2": "Goldbach's Conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, has not been proven or disproven. Therefore, it is currently unknown if there exists a smallest even integer greater than 2 that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers."
