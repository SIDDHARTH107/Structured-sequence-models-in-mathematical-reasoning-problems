    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we first need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Since we know one angle (30 degrees) and the hypotenuse (10 cm), we can use the sine and cosine functions to find the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's denote the side opposite the 30-degree angle as \"a\" and the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle as \"b\". \n\nUsing sine function:\nsin(30) = a / 10\na = 10 * sin(30)\n\nSince sin(30) = 1/2, we have:\na = 10 * (1/2)\na = 5 cm\n\nUsing cosine function:\ncos(30) = b / 10\nb = 10 * cos(30)\n\nSince cos(30) = √3/2, we have:\nb = 10 * (√3/2)\nb = 5√3 cm\n\nNow that we have the lengths of both sides, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * a * b\nArea = (1/2) * 5 * 5√3\nArea = 25√3/2 cm²"
