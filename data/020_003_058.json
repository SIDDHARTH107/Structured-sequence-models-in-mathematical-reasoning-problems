    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, X and Y. Each unit of X requires 2 hours of assembly time and 1 hour of painting time. Each unit of Y requires 3 hours of assembly time and 2 hours of painting time. The company has 60 hours of assembly time and 30 hours of painting time available. The profit from each unit of X is $10 and the profit from each unit of Y is $15. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
