    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products P1 and P2. Each unit of P1 requires 2 hours of processing time in department A and 1 hour of processing time in department B. Each unit of P2 requires 1 hour of processing time in department A and 3 hours of processing time in department B. If department A has 10 hours of processing time available and department B has 30 hours of processing time available, what is the maximum number of units of each product that can be produced while optimizing the profit if the profit per unit of P1 is $20 and the profit per unit of P2 is $30?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of P1 and y be the number of units of P2. We have the following constraints:\n\n2x + y <= 10 (Department A processing time)\nx + 3y <= 30 (Department B processing time)\nx >= 0, y >= 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function: Z = 20x + 30y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y <= 10\ny <= -2x + 10\n\n2. x + 3y <= 30\ny <= (-1/3)x + 10\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0,0), (0,10), (5,5), and (10,0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function Z at each vertex:\n\n1. Z(0,0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = 0\n2. Z(0,10) = 20(0) + 30(10) = 300\n3. Z(5,5) = 20(5) + 30(5) = 250\n4. Z(10,0) = 20(10) + 30(0) = 200\n\nThe maximum profit is $300, which occurs when 0 units of P1 and 10 units of P2 are produced."
