    "message_1": "Suppose two players, A and B are sharing a cake. Player A is offered the opportunity to divide the cake into two pieces and offer one piece to Player B. If Player B accepts the offer, both players keep their pieces of cake, and if Player B rejects the offer, both players get no cake. What would be the optimal division and offer for Player A if the cake is worth $10 and Player B's minimum acceptable offer is $3?",
    "message_2": "Player A should divide the cake in such a way that Player B gets at least their minimum acceptable offer of $3. Since Player A wants to maximize their own share, they should offer Player B exactly $3 worth of cake. This way, Player B will accept the offer as it meets their minimum requirement, and Player A will get the remaining $7 worth of cake. So, the optimal division and offer for Player A would be to give $3 worth of cake to Player B and keep $7 worth of cake for themselves."
