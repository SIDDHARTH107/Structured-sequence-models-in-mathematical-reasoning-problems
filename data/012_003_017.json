    "message_2": "An independent set of vertices in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. To find the maximum independent set, we want to find the largest set of vertices that satisfy this condition.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph:\n\n1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4\n|    |         |\n5    6---------|\n\nWe can see that vertices 1, 3, and 6 form an independent set, as none of them are connected to each other. Similarly, vertices 1, 3, and 5 also form an independent set.\n\nNow, let's try to find a larger independent set. If we include vertex 4, we cannot include vertices 3 and 6, as they are connected to vertex 4. This would leave us with vertices 1, 2, and 5. However, vertices 1 and 2 are connected, so we cannot include both of them in the independent set. Therefore, we cannot find an independent set larger than 3 vertices.\n\nThus, the maximum independent set of vertices in this graph is {1, 3, 6} or {1, 3, 5}, both with a size of 3."
