    "message_1": "In an experiment, three different fertilizers were tested on a plot of land. The yield of rice (in kg) for each fertilizer is as follows: Fertilizer A - 20, 22, 23, 24; Fertilizer B - 18, 19, 22, 21; Fertilizer C - 25, 26, 24, 27. Is there significant difference in the yield of rice among the three fertilizers at 95% confidence level? Use ANOVA to analyze the data.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in the yield of rice among the three fertilizers at a 95% confidence level, we will perform a one-way ANOVA test. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean yield for each fertilizer group:\nFertilizer A: (20+22+23+24)/4 = 89/4 = 22.25\nFertilizer B: (18+19+22+21)/4 = 80/4 = 20\nFertilizer C: (25+26+24+27)/4 = 102/4 = 25.5\n\n2. Calculate the overall mean yield:\n(89+80+102)/12 = 271/12 = 22.5833\n\n3. Calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB):\nSSB = 4*((22.25-22.5833)^2 + (20-22.5833)^2 + (25.5-22.5833)^2) = 56.3333\n\n4. Calculate the sum of squares within groups (SSW):\nFor Fertilizer A: (20-22.25)^2 + (22-22.25)^2 + (23-22.25)^2 + (24-22.25)^2 = 6.5\nFor Fertilizer B: (18-20)^2 + (19-20)^2 + (22-20)^2 + (21-20)^2 = 6\nFor Fertilizer C: (25-25.5)^2 + (26-25.5)^2 + (24-25.5)^2 + (27-25.5)^2 = 4.5\nSSW = 6.5 + 6 + 4.5 = 17\n\n5. Calculate the degrees of freedom between groups (dfB) and within groups (dfW):\ndfB = number of groups - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\ndfW = total number of observations - number of groups = 12 - 3 = 9\n\n6. Calculate the mean square between groups (MSB) and within groups (MSW):\nMSB = SSB/dfB = 56.3333/2 = 28.1667\nMSW = SSW/dfW = 17/9 = 1.8889\n\n7. Calculate the F-statistic:\nF = MSB/MSW = 28.1667/1.8889 = 14.9028\n\n8. Determine the critical F-value at a 95% confidence level:\nUsing an F-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical F-value for dfB = 2 and dfW = 9 at a 95% confidence level is approximately 4.2565.\n\n9. Compare the F-statistic to the critical F-value:\nSince the F-statistic (14.9028) is greater than the critical F-value (4.2565), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the yield of rice among the three fertilizers at a 95% confidence level.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is a significant difference in the yield of rice among the three fertilizers at a 95% confidence level."
