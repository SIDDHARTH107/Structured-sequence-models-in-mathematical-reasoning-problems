    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = cos(2πx), we will use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken over the interval -∞ to +∞.\n\nFor f(x) = cos(2πx), we have:\n\nF(k) = ∫[cos(2πx) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, with the integral taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let u = cos(2πx) and dv = e^(-2πikx) dx. Then, du = -2πsin(2πx) dx and v = (-1/(2πik))e^(-2πikx).\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\nF(k) = uv | (-∞, +∞) - ∫[v * du]\n\nF(k) = [(-1/(2πik))e^(-2πikx) * cos(2πx)] | (-∞, +∞) - ∫[(-1/(2πik))e^(-2πikx) * (-2πsin(2πx))] dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the first term and solve the remaining integral:\n\nThe first term is:\n\nlim(x->±∞) [(-1/(2πik))e^(-2πikx) * cos(2πx)]\n\nAs x goes to ±∞, the cosine term oscillates between -1 and 1, and the exponential term e^(-2πikx) also oscillates. Therefore, the product of these two terms does not converge to a specific value, and the limit is undefined. Thus, the first term is 0.\n\nNow, we need to solve the remaining integral:\n\nF(k) = ∫[(1/(πik))e^(-2πikx) * sin(2πx)] dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts again. Let u = e^(-2πikx) and dv = sin(2πx) dx. Then, du = -2πike^(-2πikx) dx and v = (-1/(2π))cos(2πx).\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\nF(k) = uv | (-∞, +∞) - ∫[v * du]\n\nF(k) = [(-1/(2πik))e^(-2πikx) * (-1/(2π))cos(2πx)] | (-∞, +∞) - ∫[(-1/(2π))cos(2πx) * (-2πike^(-2πikx))] dx\n\nAgain, the first term is 0 for the same reason as before. Now, we need to solve the remaining integral:\n\nF(k) = (1/(π^2k^2)) ∫[cos(2πx) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nThis integral is the same as the original integral we started with, but multiplied by a factor of 1/(π^2k^2). Therefore, we have:\n\nF(k) = (1/(π^2k^2)) F(k)\n\nNow, we can solve for F(k):\n\nF(k) = 0 when k ≠ ±1\n\nF(k) = ∞ when k = ±1\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of f(x) = cos(2πx) is:\n\nF(k) = ∞ for k = ±1, and 0 for all other values of k."
