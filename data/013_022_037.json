    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, there are two players, A and B. Player A is given $10,000 to distribute between themselves and Player B however they choose. If Player B accepts the allocation, they both get to keep their respective amounts. If Player B rejects the allocation, neither of them receive any money. Player B's acceptance is assumed to be based solely on the amount they receive. If Player B's minimum acceptable amount is $2,000, what is the maximum amount Player A can keep for themselves while still ensuring that Player B accepts the allocation?",
    "message_2": "If Player B's minimum acceptable amount is $2,000, then Player A can keep the maximum amount for themselves by giving Player B exactly $2,000. In this case, Player A would keep $10,000 - $2,000 = $8,000 for themselves."
