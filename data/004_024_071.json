    "message_2": "To find the derivative dy/dx of the given equation y = sin(x^2 + 2x), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's denote the inner function as u(x) and the outer function as v(u). In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = x^2 + 2x\nv(u) = sin(u)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of u(x) and v(u):\n\ndu/dx = d(x^2 + 2x)/dx = 2x + 2\ndv/du = d(sin(u))/du = cos(u)\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule to find dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = dv/du * du/dx\n\nSince dv/du = cos(u) and du/dx = 2x + 2, we have:\n\ndy/dx = cos(u) * (2x + 2)\n\nNow, we need to substitute u(x) back into the equation:\n\ndy/dx = cos(x^2 + 2x) * (2x + 2)\n\nSo, the derivative of y = sin(x^2 + 2x) with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = (2x + 2)cos(x^2 + 2x)"
