    "message_1": "A company claims that its product has a probability of 0.6 of meeting customer satisfaction. A sample of 20 customers is taken. What is the probability that at least 14 of them are satisfied with the product according to Bayesian statistics?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (satisfied customers) in n trials (customers sampled)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (customer satisfaction), which is 0.6 in this case\n- n is the number of trials (customers sampled), which is 20\n- k is the number of successes (satisfied customers), which we want to be at least 14\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 14 customers are satisfied, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.\n\nP(X ≥ 14) = P(X = 14) + P(X = 15) + P(X = 16) + P(X = 17) + P(X = 18) + P(X = 19) + P(X = 20)\n\nWe can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 14) = C(20, 14) * 0.6^14 * 0.4^6\nP(X = 15) = C(20, 15) * 0.6^15 * 0.4^5\nP(X = 16) = C(20, 16) * 0.6^16 * 0.4^4\nP(X = 17) = C(20, 17) * 0.6^17 * 0.4^3\nP(X = 18) = C(20, 18) * 0.6^18 * 0.4^2\nP(X = 19) = C(20, 19) * 0.6^19 * 0.4^1\nP(X = 20) = C(20, 20) * 0.6^20 * 0.4^0\n\nNow, we can calculate each term:\n\nP(X = 14) ≈ 0.1091\nP(X = 15) ≈ 0.1664\nP(X = 16) ≈ 0.1773\nP(X = 17) ≈ 0.1319\nP(X = 18) ≈ 0.0660\nP(X = 19) ≈ 0.0207\nP(X = 20) ≈ 0.0026\n\nFinally, we can sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 14) ≈ 0.1091 + 0.1664 + 0.1773 + 0.1319 + 0.0660 + 0.0207 + 0.0026 ≈ 0.6740\n\nSo, the probability that at least 14 out of 20 customers are satisfied with the product according to Bayesian statistics is approximately 0.674 or 67.4%."
