    "message_1": "A stream cipher generates a stream of pseudo-random bits that are combined with the plain text message to produce the ciphertext. If the generator produces 100,000 bits and the plain text message is 10,000 bytes long, what is the ratio of the number of generated bits to the size of the message in bytes?",
    "message_2": "To find the ratio of the number of generated bits to the size of the message in bytes, we first need to convert the size of the message to bits. Since there are 8 bits in a byte, we can multiply the number of bytes by 8.\n\n10,000 bytes * 8 bits/byte = 80,000 bits\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the number of generated bits (100,000 bits) to the size of the message in bits (80,000 bits).\n\nRatio = (Number of generated bits) / (Size of the message in bits)\nRatio = 100,000 bits / 80,000 bits\nRatio = 5 / 4\n\nSo the ratio of the number of generated bits to the size of the message in bytes is 5:4."
