    "message_2": "To find the average value of a continuous function over an interval, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[f(x) dx] from a to b\n\nIn this case, f(x) = 2sin(x), a = 0, and b = π/2. So, we need to find the integral of 2sin(x) from 0 to π/2 and then divide it by the length of the interval (π/2 - 0).\n\nFirst, let's find the integral of 2sin(x):\n\n∫[2sin(x) dx] = -2cos(x) + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral at the bounds:\n\n[-2cos(π/2) - (-2cos(0))] = [-2(0) - (-2(1))] = 2\n\nNow, we'll find the average value:\n\nAverage value = (1/(π/2 - 0)) * 2 = (2/π) * 2 = 4/π\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) between x = 0 and x = π/2 is 4/π."
