    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A△B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA△B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nSimilarly, we can find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B△A. Note that the symmetric difference is commutative, so B△A = A△B.\n\nB△A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A△B)×A and (B△A)×A. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A△B)×A = {1, 4}×{1, 2, 3} = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\n(B△A)×A = {1, 4}×{1, 2, 3} = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A△B)×A = (B△A)×A. However, this does not prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is associative with respect to the Cartesian product in general. This example only shows that for these specific sets A and B, their symmetric difference is equal when taking the Cartesian product with A.\n\nTo show that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product in general, consider three sets A, B, and C. We want to show that (A△B)×C ≠ A△(B×C) in general.\n\nLet A = {1}, B = {2}, and C = {3}. Then,\n\nA△B = {1, 2}\nB×C = {(2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find (A△B)×C and A△(B×C):\n\n(A△B)×C = {1, 2}×{3} = {(1,3), (2,3)}\n\nA△(B×C) = {1}△{(2, 3)} = {(1), (2, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A△B)×C ≠ A△(B×C), showing that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product in general."
