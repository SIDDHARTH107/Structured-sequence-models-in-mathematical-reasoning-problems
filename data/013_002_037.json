A can choose to invest either $10 million or $20 million in advertising, while B can choose to invest either $5 million or $15 million. The profits (in millions of dollars) for each company are given by the following table:\n\n| A\\B | Invest $5m | Invest $15m |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Invest $10m | 5, 1 | 1, 3 |\n| Invest $20m | 3, 2 | 2, 4 |\n\nWhat is the Nash equilibrium of this game? What will be the outcome for both companies?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the best response for each company given the other company's strategy. \n\n1. If Company B invests $5 million:\n   - Company A's best response is to invest $10 million, as it will earn a profit of $5 million compared to $3 million if it invests $20 million.\n\n2. If Company B invests $15 million:\n   - Company A's best response is to invest $20 million, as it will earn a profit of $2 million compared to $1 million if it invests $10 million.\n\nNow, let's consider Company B's best response given Company A's strategy.\n\n1. If Company A invests $10 million:\n   - Company B's best response is to invest $5 million, as it will earn a profit of $1 million compared to $3 million if it invests $15 million.\n\n2. If Company A invests $20 million:\n   - Company B's best response is to invest $15 million, as it will earn a profit of $4 million compared to $2 million if it invests $5 million.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when both companies choose their best response given the other's strategy. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when Company A invests $20 million and Company B invests $15 million. The outcome for both companies at the Nash equilibrium is a profit of $2 million for Company A and $4 million for Company B."
