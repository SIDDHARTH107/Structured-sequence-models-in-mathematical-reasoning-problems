    "message_2": "To evaluate the given contour integral using Cauchy's theorem, we first need to identify the singularities of the integrand inside the contour. The integrand is given by:\n\nf(z) = z^3 / [(z - 1)(z + 2)]\n\nThe singularities of f(z) are the points where the denominator is zero, which are z = 1 and z = -2. Both of these points lie inside the circle |z| = 3, so we can apply Cauchy's theorem.\n\nAccording to the residue theorem, the contour integral is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues of f(z) at its singularities inside the contour. So, we need to find the residues of f(z) at z = 1 and z = -2.\n\n1. Residue at z = 1:\nTo find the residue at z = 1, we can use the formula:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 1] = lim(z->1) [(z - 1) * f(z)]\n\n= lim(z->1) [(z - 1) * (z^3 / [(z - 1)(z + 2)])]\n\n= lim(z->1) [z^3 / (z + 2)]\n\n= 1^3 / (1 + 2)\n\n= 1 / 3\n\n2. Residue at z = -2:\nTo find the residue at z = -2, we can use the formula:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -2] = lim(z->-2) [(z + 2) * f(z)]\n\n= lim(z->-2) [(z + 2) * (z^3 / [(z - 1)(z + 2)])]\n\n= lim(z->-2) [z^3 / (z - 1)]\n\n= (-2)^3 / (-2 - 1)\n\n= -8 / (-3)\n\n= 8 / 3\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to find the contour integral:\n\n∫(𝑧^3 / [(𝑧 − 1)(𝑧 + 2)]) d𝑧 = 2πi * (Res[f(z), z = 1] + Res[f(z), z = -2])\n\n= 2πi * (1/3 + 8/3)\n\n= 2πi * (9/3)\n\n= 2πi * 3\n\n= 6πi\n\nSo, the contour integral is equal to 6πi."
