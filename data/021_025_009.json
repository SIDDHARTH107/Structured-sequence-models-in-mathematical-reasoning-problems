    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the humpback whale's hunting behavior. It is a metaheuristic algorithm used to find the global minimum of complex optimization problems. To apply the WOA to the given function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of whales (search agents) randomly within the search space.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each whale.\n3. Update the position of each whale using the WOA equations.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the maximum number of iterations is reached or the desired level of accuracy is achieved.\n\nHowever, as a text-based AI, I cannot run simulations or iterative algorithms. Instead, I can provide you with the general idea and equations used in the WOA. You can then implement the algorithm in a programming language of your choice.\n\nThe main equations used in the WOA are:\n\nX(t+1) = X*(t) + A * D\n\nwhere X(t+1) is the updated position of the whale, X*(t) is the best position found so far, A is a coefficient that decreases linearly from 2 to 0 over the course of the algorithm, and D is the distance between the current position and the best position.\n\nD = |X*(t) - X(t)|\n\nTo simulate the humpback whale's hunting behavior, the WOA also includes a spiral updating equation:\n\nX(t+1) = D * e^(b * l) * cos(2 * Ï€ * l) + X*(t)\n\nwhere b is a constant, and l is a random number between -1 and 1.\n\nImplement the WOA using these equations in a programming language, and you can find the minimum value of the given function f(x) = 3x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 6. Remember to set the appropriate search space, population size, and maximum number of iterations for the problem."
