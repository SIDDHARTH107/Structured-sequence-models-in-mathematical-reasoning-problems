    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a length of 10 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the volume of the rectangular pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Length * Width * Height\n\nIn this case, the length is 10 cm, the width is 6 cm, and the height is 4 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 10 * 6 * 4\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 240\n\nVolume = 80 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 80 cubic centimeters."
