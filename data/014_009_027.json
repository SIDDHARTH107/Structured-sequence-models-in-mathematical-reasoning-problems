    "message_1": "Consider a Feistel cipher with a block size of 64-bits and a key size of 128-bits. The round function of Feistel cipher applies an S-box that takes a 6-bit input and gives a 4-bit output. If the S-box is applied 16 times in each round, how many S-boxes are required to encrypt one block of data?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, the block size is divided into two equal halves. Since the block size is 64-bits, each half is 32-bits. The round function is applied to one half of the block (32-bits) while the other half remains unchanged.\n\nThe S-box takes a 6-bit input and gives a 4-bit output. Since the S-box is applied 16 times in each round, it processes 16 * 6 = 96 bits of input and produces 16 * 4 = 64 bits of output.\n\nHowever, the round function is applied to a 32-bit half of the block. To cover the entire 32-bit half, we need to use multiple S-boxes in parallel. To determine how many S-boxes are needed, we can divide the 32-bit half by the 4-bit output of each S-box:\n\n32 bits / 4 bits = 8 S-boxes\n\nSo, 8 S-boxes are required to encrypt one half of the block in each round. Since the Feistel cipher processes both halves of the block, the total number of S-boxes required to encrypt one block of data is 8 S-boxes * 2 halves = 16 S-boxes."
