    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (3 * √3 * s^2) / 2\n\nwhere s is the side length of the hexagon.\n\nIn this case, s = 5 cm. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (3 * √3 * 5^2) / 2\nArea = (3 * √3 * 25) / 2\nArea = (75 * √3) / 2\nArea ≈ 64.95 cm^2\n\nSo, the area of the regular hexagon with a side length of 5 cm is approximately 64.95 cm^2."
