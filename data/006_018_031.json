    "message_1": "Assume that the probability of a financial fraud occurring in a company is 0.08. If a company has 500 employees, what is the probability that at least 20 employees in the company have committed fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k employees committing fraud\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of employees (500)\n- k is the number of employees committing fraud (20 or more)\n- p is the probability of an employee committing fraud (0.08)\n- (1-p) is the probability of an employee not committing fraud (0.92)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 20 employees committing fraud, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 20, 21, 22, ..., 500. However, calculating this directly would be quite tedious. Instead, we can find the complementary probability (the probability of fewer than 20 employees committing fraud) and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - P(X < 20) = 1 - Σ[P(X = k)] for k = 0 to 19\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 19 using the binomial probability formula:\n\nΣ[P(X = k)] = Σ[C(500, k) * 0.08^k * 0.92^(500-k)] for k = 0 to 19\n\nUsing a calculator or software that can handle large numbers and summations, we find:\n\nΣ[P(X = k)] ≈ 0.566\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 20 employees committing fraud:\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - 0.566 ≈ 0.434\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 employees in the company have committed fraud is approximately 0.434 or 43.4%."
