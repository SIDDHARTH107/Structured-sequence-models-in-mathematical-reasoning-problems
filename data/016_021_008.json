    "message_2": "To find the length of the third stage of the Sierpinski Arrowhead curve, we need to understand the pattern of the curve's growth. In each stage, each line segment is replaced by three smaller segments, each of which is half the length of the original segment.\n\nLet's calculate the length of the curve at each stage:\n\n1. Initial stage (0th stage): The curve is an equilateral triangle with a side length of 18 cm. The total length is 3 * 18 = 54 cm.\n\n2. First stage: Each side of the triangle is replaced by three segments, each half the length of the original side (18/2 = 9 cm). The total length is now 3 * 3 * 9 = 81 cm.\n\n3. Second stage: Each of the 9 segments from the first stage is replaced by three segments, each half the length of the original segment (9/2 = 4.5 cm). The total length is now 3 * 9 * 4.5 = 121.5 cm.\n\n4. Third stage: Each of the 27 segments from the second stage is replaced by three segments, each half the length of the original segment (4.5/2 = 2.25 cm). The total length is now 3 * 27 * 2.25 = 182.25 cm.\n\nSo, the length of the third stage of the Sierpinski Arrowhead curve is 182.25 cm."
