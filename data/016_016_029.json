    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that is generated by repeatedly replacing a line segment with a specific pattern of smaller segments. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nFor the Gosper curve, the length of the curve after each iteration is given by the formula:\n\nLength = (previous length) * (7/3)\n\nFor the 6th iteration, we can calculate the length as follows:\n\n1st iteration: Length = 1 * (7/3) = 7/3\n2nd iteration: Length = (7/3) * (7/3) = 49/9\n3rd iteration: Length = (49/9) * (7/3) = 343/27\n4th iteration: Length = (343/27) * (7/3) = 2401/81\n5th iteration: Length = (2401/81) * (7/3) = 16807/243\n6th iteration: Length = (16807/243) * (7/3) = 117649/729\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve up to its 6th iteration is 117649/729 units."
