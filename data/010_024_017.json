    "message_2": "To find the length of the shortest path from A to B that avoids point C, we will use the concept of hyperbolic distance. In a hyperbolic plane with curvature K, the hyperbolic distance between two points is given by the formula:\n\nd(A, B) = arcosh(1 - K * (AB)^2 / 4)\n\nwhere d(A, B) is the hyperbolic distance between points A and B, and (AB) is the Euclidean distance between A and B.\n\nSince we are given that the curvature K = -2.5, we can rewrite the formula as:\n\nd(A, B) = arcosh(1 + 2.5 * (AB)^2 / 4)\n\nNow, let's consider the triangle Î”ABC formed by the non-collinear points A, B, and C. To avoid point C, we can take the shortest path from A to B that goes around C. This path will consist of two segments: one from A to a point D on the line BC, and another from D to B.\n\nLet's denote the Euclidean distances AD, DB, and DC as a, b, and c, respectively. Then, the total Euclidean distance of the path ADB is (a + b). We can now use the hyperbolic distance formula for each segment:\n\nd(A, D) = arcosh(1 + 2.5 * a^2 / 4)\nd(D, B) = arcosh(1 + 2.5 * b^2 / 4)\n\nThe total hyperbolic distance of the path ADB is the sum of these two distances:\n\nd(A, B) = d(A, D) + d(D, B) = arcosh(1 + 2.5 * a^2 / 4) + arcosh(1 + 2.5 * b^2 / 4)\n\nTo find the shortest path, we need to minimize this expression. We can do this using calculus, by taking the partial derivatives with respect to a and b and setting them equal to zero. However, this is a complicated process and requires advanced mathematical techniques.\n\nIn summary, the length of the shortest path from A to B that avoids point C can be found using the hyperbolic distance formula and minimizing the expression for the total distance. The exact solution depends on the specific positions of points A, B, and C in the hyperbolic plane."
