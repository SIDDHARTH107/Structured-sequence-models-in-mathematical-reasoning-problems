    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem that a math student can solve related to signaling game in Game theory:\n\nConsider a signaling game between two players, the sender and the receiver. The sender has two types, type A and type B, where type A occurs with probability 0.6, and type B occurs with probability 0.4. Type A has an outside option of 2, while type B has an outside option of 5. The receiver has to choose an action, and the payoff matrix is given by:\n\n|   | Action 1 | Action 2 |\n|---|---------|---------|\n| A | 7, 3    | 3, 7    |\n| B | 2, 5    | 5, 2    |\n\nWhat is the expected utility of the sender and the receiver in this game? What is the receiver's optimal strategy?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected utility of the sender and the receiver, we need to consider the probabilities of each type of sender and the payoffs associated with each action.\n\nExpected utility for the sender when the receiver chooses Action 1:\n- Type A: 0.6 * 7 = 4.2\n- Type B: 0.4 * 2 = 0.8\nTotal expected utility for the sender with Action 1: 4.2 + 0.8 = 5\n\nExpected utility for the sender when the receiver chooses Action 2:\n- Type A: 0.6 * 3 = 1.8\n- Type B: 0.4 * 5 = 2\nTotal expected utility for the sender with Action 2: 1.8 + 2 = 3.8\n\nExpected utility for the receiver when choosing Action 1:\n- Type A: 0.6 * 3 = 1.8\n- Type B: 0.4 * 5 = 2\nTotal expected utility for the receiver with Action 1: 1.8 + 2 = 3.8\n\nExpected utility for the receiver when choosing Action 2:\n- Type A: 0.6 * 7 = 4.2\n- Type B: 0.4 * 2 = 0.8\nTotal expected utility for the receiver with Action 2: 4.2 + 0.8 = 5\n\nThe receiver's optimal strategy is to choose the action with the highest expected utility. In this case, both Action 1 and Action 2 have the same expected utility of 5. Therefore, the receiver is indifferent between the two actions and can choose either one."
