    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 35. Since 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers, we can apply Sylow's Theorems.\n\nLet n_5 and n_7 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups of G, respectively. By Sylow's Third Theorem, we have:\n\nn_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5) and n_5 | 7, so n_5 can be either 1 or 7.\nn_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7) and n_7 | 5, so n_7 can only be 1.\n\nSince n_7 = 1, there exists a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, say H, of G. Thus, H is a normal subgroup of G. Now, let's consider the case when n_5 = 1. In this case, there exists a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, say K, of G. Thus, K is also a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we have two normal subgroups H and K of G, with orders 7 and 5, respectively. Since the orders of H and K are coprime (gcd(5, 7) = 1), we have:\n\n|HK| = |H||K| / |H ∩ K| = 7 * 5 / 1 = 35.\n\nSince |HK| = |G|, we have HK = G. Moreover, since H and K are both cyclic (as they are groups of prime order), G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which are cyclic groups of orders 7 and 5, respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when n_5 = 7. In this case, there are 7 distinct Sylow 5-subgroups. However, each of these subgroups has 4 non-identity elements, and since these elements are of order 5, they cannot be in the Sylow 7-subgroup H. Thus, there are at least 7 * 4 = 28 distinct non-identity elements in the Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\nHowever, since G has only 35 - 1 = 34 non-identity elements, and 28 of them are in the Sylow 5-subgroups, there are only 6 non-identity elements left for the Sylow 7-subgroup H. This is a contradiction, as H should have 7 - 1 = 6 non-identity elements. Therefore, the case n_5 = 7 is not possible.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, as shown in the case when n_5 = 1."
