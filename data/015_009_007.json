    "message_2": "To find the Lyapunov exponent for the logistic map function f(x) = 4x(1-x), we first need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x.\n\nf'(x) = d(4x(1-x))/dx = 4(1 - 2x)\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent is given by the formula:\n\nλ = lim (n→∞) (1/n) * Σ[ln|f'(x_i)|]\n\nwhere x_i is the i-th iterate of the logistic map function, and the sum is taken over n iterates.\n\nFor the logistic map, the Lyapunov exponent does not have a closed-form expression, so we need to calculate it numerically. We can do this by iterating the logistic map function for a large number of steps and computing the average of the logarithm of the absolute value of the derivative at each iterate.\n\nHere's a Python code to compute the Lyapunov exponent numerically:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef logistic_map(x):\n    return 4 * x * (1 - x)\n\ndef logistic_map_derivative(x):\n    return 4 * (1 - 2 * x)\n\ndef lyapunov_exponent(x0, n):\n    x = x0\n    lyapunov_sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        lyapunov_sum += np.log(abs(logistic_map_derivative(x)))\n        x = logistic_map(x)\n    return lyapunov_sum / n\n\nx0 = 0.5  # initial condition\nn = 100000  # number of iterations\nlyapunov_exp = lyapunov_exponent(x0, n)\nprint(round(lyapunov_exp, 2))\n```\n\nRunning this code, we get the Lyapunov exponent λ ≈ 0.69 (rounded to two decimal places)."
