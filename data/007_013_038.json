    "message_2": "The conjecture you are referring to is known as the Goldbach Conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This conjecture has been tested extensively for even numbers up to very large values, and it has been found to hold true in every case. However, the conjecture has not been proven or disproven, so we cannot definitively say if there is a smallest even number greater than 2 that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers."
