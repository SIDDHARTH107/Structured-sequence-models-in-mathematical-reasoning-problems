    "message_2": "To determine if there are any outliers in the grades, we can use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. First, we need to find the median (Q2), the first quartile (Q1), and the third quartile (Q3).\n\nThe grades in ascending order are: 85, 90, 92, 93, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100.\n\nThe median (Q2) is the average of the two middle numbers: (99 + 100)/2 = 99.5\n\nThe first quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half: (92 + 93)/2 = 92.5\n\nThe third quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half: (100 + 100)/2 = 100\n\nNow, we can calculate the Interquartile Range (IQR): IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 100 - 92.5 = 7.5\n\nNext, we find the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\n\nLower bound: Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 92.5 - 1.5 * 7.5 = 80.25\nUpper bound: Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 100 + 1.5 * 7.5 = 111.25\n\nNow, we can check if there are any grades outside of these bounds:\n\n85 is greater than the lower bound (80.25) and all other grades are less than the upper bound (111.25).\n\nTherefore, there are no outliers in the grades."
