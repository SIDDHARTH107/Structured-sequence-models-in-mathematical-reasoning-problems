    "message_2": "To find the expected number of fans who would win their bet if they bet on Team A to win, we can multiply the probability of Team A winning (0.6) by the total number of fans placing bets (1000).\n\nExpected number of winning bets = Probability of Team A winning × Total number of fans placing bets\nExpected number of winning bets = 0.6 × 1000\nExpected number of winning bets = 600\n\nSo, 600 fans are expected to win their bet if they bet on Team A to win."
