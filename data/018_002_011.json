    "message_2": "To show that the intersection of sets A and B is a subset of both sets A and B, we first need to find the intersection of the two sets. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nIntersection of A and B (A ∩ B) = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nComparing the elements of sets A and B, we can see that the common elements are 4 and 8.\n\nSo, A ∩ B = {4, 8}\n\nNow, we need to show that A ∩ B is a subset of both A and B.\n\nA subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. In other words, if set C is a subset of set D, then every element of C must also be an element of D.\n\nLet's check if A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be in A. Since A ∩ B = {4, 8} and both 4 and 8 are elements of A, A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be in B. Since A ∩ B = {4, 8} and both 4 and 8 are elements of B, A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the intersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B) is a subset of both sets A and B."
