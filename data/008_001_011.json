    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  3 ]\n[ 3 -4  2 | -5 ]\n[ 2 -1  3 |  7 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to transform the matrix into its row-echelon form:\n\nStep 1: Swap row 1 and row 2 to have the largest absolute value in the first column:\n\n```\n[ 3 -4  2 | -5 ]\n[ 1  2 -1 |  3 ]\n[ 2 -1  3 |  7 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Subtract (1/3) * row 1 from row 2, and subtract (2/3) * row 1 from row 3:\n\n```\n[ 3 -4  2 | -5 ]\n[ 0  10/3 -5/3 | 16/3 ]\n[ 0  5/3  7/3 | 23/3 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Multiply row 2 by 3/10 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n```\n[ 3 -4  2 | -5 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/2 | 8/5 ]\n[ 0  5/3  7/3 | 23/3 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Add (4/5) * row 2 to row 1, and subtract (5/3) * row 2 from row 3:\n\n```\n[ 3  0  6/5 | -3/5 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/2 |  8/5 ]\n[ 0  0  3 |  9 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the row-echelon form of the matrix. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nStep 5: Divide row 3 by 3 to get a leading 1 in the third row:\n\n```\n[ 3  0  6/5 | -3/5 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/2 |  8/5 ]\n[ 0  0  1 |  3 ]\n```\n\nStep 6: Add (1/2) * row 3 to row 2, and subtract (6/5) * row 3 from row 1:\n\n```\n[ 3  0  0 | -3 ]\n[ 0  1  0 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0  1 |  3 ]\n```\n\nStep 7: Divide row 1 by 3 to get a leading 1 in the first row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  0 | -1 ]\n[ 0  1  0 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0  1 |  3 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the reduced row-echelon form of the matrix, and we can read the solution directly:\n\nx = -1\ny = 2\nz = 3\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the system of equations are x = -1, y = 2, and z = 3."
