    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not depend on the number of iterations (n). The Hausdorff dimension remains constant as the curve becomes more complex with each iteration. For the Koch curve, the Hausdorff dimension (D) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, there are 4 self-similar pieces (N = 4) and each piece is scaled down by a factor of 3 (S = 3). Therefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is approximately 1.2619, regardless of the number of iterations (n)."
