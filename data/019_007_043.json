    "message_1": "Assuming that a non-monotonic logic rule is a rule that can have additional information added to it without invalidating the original rule, consider the following scenario:\n \nIn a store, there are three types of discounts: 10%, 15%, and 20%. The discount is applied based on the total amount of the purchase made by the customer. All customers are eligible for a 10% discount, but if the total purchase amount is above $100, then an additional 5% discount is given. If the total purchase amount is above $200, then an additional 5% discount is given on top of the previous discounts.\n\nIf John bought items that were worth $350, how much discount will be applied to his total purchase amount using non-monotonic logic rules?",
    "message_2": "Using non-monotonic logic rules, we can determine the discount applied to John's total purchase amount as follows:\n\n1. All customers are eligible for a 10% discount.\n2. Since John's total purchase amount is above $100, he gets an additional 5% discount.\n3. Since John's total purchase amount is above $200, he gets another additional 5% discount.\n\nAdding up the discounts, John will receive a total discount of 10% + 5% + 5% = 20%.\n\nNow, to calculate the discounted amount, we can apply the 20% discount to John's total purchase amount of $350:\n\nDiscounted amount = $350 * (1 - 0.20) = $350 * 0.80 = $280.\n\nSo, John will pay $280 after the 20% discount is applied to his total purchase amount."
