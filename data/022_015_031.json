Consider the line L, given by the equation Im(z) = 0, and let D be the domain bounded by the line L and the parabola P, given by the equation Re(z) = (1/4)Im(z)^2, where Im(z) > 0. Using the Schwarz reflection principle, determine the analytic extension of f(z) from D to the larger domain D' obtained by reflecting D with respect to the line L.",
    "message_2": "To find the analytic extension of f(z) using the Schwarz reflection principle, we first need to find the reflection of z with respect to the line L. Since L is the real axis (Im(z) = 0), the reflection of a point z = x + yi with respect to L is simply its complex conjugate, z' = x - yi.\n\nNow, let g(z) be the analytic extension of f(z) from D to D'. According to the Schwarz reflection principle, g(z) must satisfy the following condition:\n\ng(z) = f(z) for z in D\ng(z') = f'(z) for z' in D'\n\nHere, f'(z) is the complex conjugate of f(z). Let's find f'(z):\n\nf(z) = z^2 - 3z + 2\nf'(z) = (z')^2 - 3z' + 2 = (x - yi)^2 - 3(x - yi) + 2\n\nExpanding and simplifying f'(z), we get:\n\nf'(z) = (x^2 + 2xyi - y^2) - 3x + 3yi + 2 = (x^2 - y^2 - 3x + 2) + (2xy + 3y)i\n\nNow, we can define g(z) as follows:\n\ng(z) = f(z) for z in D (Im(z) > 0)\ng(z) = f'(z) for z in D' (Im(z) < 0)\n\nSo, the analytic extension of f(z) from D to D' is given by:\n\ng(z) = { f(z) = z^2 - 3z + 2, if Im(z) > 0\n       { f'(z) = (x^2 - y^2 - 3x + 2) + (2xy + 3y)i, if Im(z) < 0"
