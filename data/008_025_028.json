    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can first check if the equations are multiples of each other. If they are, then the system has either infinitely many solutions or no solution.\n\nDivide the second equation by 2:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}(10x - 4y) = \\frac{1}{2}(14)$\n\nThis results in:\n\n$5x - 2y = 7$\n\nWe can see that the two equations are the same:\n\n$\\begin{cases} 5x - 2y = 7 \\\\ 5x - 2y = 7 \\end{cases}$\n\nSince the two equations are the same, they represent the same line in the coordinate plane. Therefore, the system has infinitely many solutions, and the solution is not unique."
