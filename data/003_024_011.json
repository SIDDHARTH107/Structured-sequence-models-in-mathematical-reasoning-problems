Find the projection of the velocity of the plane with respect to airspeed. Assume the angle between the velocity of the plane and the direction of the wind is 30 degrees.",
    "message_2": "To find the projection of the velocity of the plane with respect to airspeed, we need to consider the components of the plane's velocity in the northward and eastward directions.\n\nLet Vp be the velocity of the plane, Vw be the velocity of the wind, and Vr be the resultant velocity of the plane with respect to airspeed.\n\nThe northward component of the plane's velocity (Vp_north) is given by:\n\nVp_north = Vp * cos(30°)\n\nThe eastward component of the plane's velocity (Vp_east) is given by:\n\nVp_east = Vp * sin(30°)\n\nNow, we need to account for the wind's effect on the plane's velocity. The wind is blowing eastward, so it only affects the eastward component of the plane's velocity. Therefore, the resultant eastward velocity (Vr_east) is given by:\n\nVr_east = Vp_east + Vw\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the resultant velocity (Vr) using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nVr = sqrt(Vr_north^2 + Vr_east^2)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nVp = 400 km/h\nVw = 50 km/h\n\nVp_north = 400 * cos(30°) = 400 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 200 * sqrt(3) km/h\nVp_east = 400 * sin(30°) = 400 * (1/2) = 200 km/h\n\nVr_east = Vp_east + Vw = 200 + 50 = 250 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the resultant velocity (Vr):\n\nVr = sqrt((200 * sqrt(3))^2 + (250)^2)\nVr = sqrt((400 * 3) + (62500))\nVr = sqrt(1200 + 62500)\nVr = sqrt(63700)\n\nVr ≈ 252.39 km/h\n\nThe projection of the velocity of the plane with respect to airspeed is approximately 252.39 km/h."
