    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the output y(t), we first need to find the Fourier series of the input x(t). Since the input is a periodic signal with a period of T = 2 seconds, we can represent x(t) using the Fourier series:\n\nx(t) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nωt) + b_n * sin(nωt)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π/T = π, n is an integer, and a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of x(t) and G(s). Let X(jω) be the Fourier transform of x(t) and Y(jω) be the Fourier transform of y(t). According to the properties of the Fourier transform and the transfer function, we have:\n\nY(jω) = G(jω) * X(jω)\n\nTo find the Fourier series of y(t), we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(jω). We can do this by substituting the Fourier series of x(t) into the equation above and then finding the inverse Fourier transform:\n\ny(t) = Inverse_Fourier_Transform{G(jω) * [a_0 + Σ (a_n * cos(nωt) + b_n * sin(nωt))]}\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of G(jω). To do this, we first substitute jω for s in the transfer function G(s):\n\nG(jω) = (2(jω) + 1)/((jω)^2 + 4(jω) + 5)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of G(jω) * X(jω) by multiplying G(jω) with each term in the Fourier series of x(t) and then taking the inverse Fourier transform:\n\ny(t) = a_0 * Inverse_Fourier_Transform{G(jω)} + Σ [a_n * Inverse_Fourier_Transform{G(jω) * cos(nωt)} + b_n * Inverse_Fourier_Transform{G(jω) * sin(nωt)}]\n\nThis equation represents the Fourier series of the output y(t). Note that the actual values of the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n depend on the specific input signal x(t)."
