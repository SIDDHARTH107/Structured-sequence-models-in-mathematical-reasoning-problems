    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key between Alice and Bob, we can use the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Alice and Bob agree on a prime number p and a primitive root g. In this case, we don't have the values of p and g, so we cannot proceed with the algorithm.\n\nHowever, if you meant that Alice and Bob have public keys A and B, and private keys a and b, then we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. Alice's public key (A) = 3\n2. Bob's public key (B) = 7\n3. Alice's private key (a) = 4\n4. Bob's private key (b) = 4\n\nNow, to find the shared secret key, we can use the following formula:\n\nShared Secret Key = (A^b) mod p = (B^a) mod p\n\nSince we don't have the values of p and g, we cannot calculate the shared secret key. Please provide the values of p and g to proceed with the calculation."
