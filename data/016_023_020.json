    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Vicsek fractal, we start with a square and replace each line segment with four line segments of equal length. This results in 5 smaller squares, so N = 5. The scaling factor is 3, as each new line segment is 1/3 the length of the original line segment.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.46497\n\nSo, the exact Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is approximately 1.46497."
