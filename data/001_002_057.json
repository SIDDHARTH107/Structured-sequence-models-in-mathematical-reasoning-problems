    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line that passes through the points (2, -3) and (5, 1), we can use the slope-point form of a linear equation, which is:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nFirst, we need to find the slope (m) of the line. The slope can be found using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points (2, -3) and (5, 1), we can plug in the values:\n\nm = (1 - (-3)) / (5 - 2)\nm = (1 + 3) / 3\nm = 4 / 3\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use either point to find the equation of the line. Let's use the point (2, -3):\n\ny - (-3) = (4/3)(x - 2)\ny + 3 = (4/3)(x - 2)\n\nTo get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n3(y + 3) = 4(x - 2)\n\nNow, distribute the numbers:\n\n3y + 9 = 4x - 8\n\nTo write the equation in the standard form (Ax + By = C), we can subtract 4x from both sides:\n\n-4x + 3y = -17\n\nSo, the equation of the line that passes through the points (2, -3) and (5, 1) is:\n\n-4x + 3y = -17"
