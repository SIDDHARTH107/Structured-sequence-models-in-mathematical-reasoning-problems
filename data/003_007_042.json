    "message_2": "To find the largest angle in the triangle, we will use the Law of Cosines. The largest angle is opposite the longest side, which is 13 in this case. Let's denote the sides as a = 7, b = 10, and c = 13, and the angles as A, B, and C, respectively, where C is the largest angle.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C). We can plug in the values and solve for angle C:\n\n13^2 = 7^2 + 10^2 - 2 * 7 * 10 * cos(C)\n169 = 49 + 100 - 140 * cos(C)\n20 = -140 * cos(C)\n\nNow, divide both sides by -140:\n\ncos(C) = -20/140 = -1/7\n\nNow, we can find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of -1/7:\n\nC = arccos(-1/7)\n\nC ≈ 97.41°\n\nSo, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 97.41°."
