    "message_1": "A company wants to optimize its production process to maximize profit. The cost of producing each unit of product A is $5, and the cost of producing each unit of product B is $7. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of either A or B. The selling prices for A and B are $15 and $20 per unit, respectively. The company wants to produce a combination of A and B that maximizes its total profit.\n\nFormulate and solve the quadratic programming problem to find the optimal production quantities of A and B that maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The profit for each unit of product A is $15 - $5 = $10, and the profit for each unit of product B is $20 - $7 = $13.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 13y\n\nThe company can produce a maximum of 100 units of either A or B, so we have the constraint:\n\nx + y ≤ 100\n\nSince the company cannot produce a negative number of units, we also have the following constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we have a linear programming problem:\n\nMaximize P(x, y) = 10x + 13y\nSubject to:\nx + y ≤ 100\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method. First, we'll graph the constraint x + y ≤ 100:\n\n1. When x = 0, y = 100\n2. When y = 0, x = 100\n\nPlot these points and draw the line connecting them. The feasible region is below this line, including the axes.\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. (0, 0) - Origin\n2. (100, 0) - Intersection of x-axis and x + y = 100\n3. (0, 100) - Intersection of y-axis and x + y = 100\n\nEvaluate the objective function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 13(0) = 0\n2. P(100, 0) = 10(100) + 13(0) = 1000\n3. P(0, 100) = 10(0) + 13(100) = 1300\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 100), where the company produces 0 units of product A and 100 units of product B. The maximum profit is $1300."
