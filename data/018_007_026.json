    "message_2": "The power set of a set X, denoted as P(X), is the set of all possible subsets of X, including the empty set and X itself. The size of the power set of X is given by the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in X.\n\nIn this case, X has 5 elements, so the size of the power set of X is 2^5 = 32.\n\nNow, let's show that the size of the power set of X is always larger than 5. We know that the power set of X includes the empty set, X itself, and all possible subsets of X. Since X has 5 elements, there are at least 5 subsets of X that contain only one element (i.e., each element of X is a subset of X). Additionally, there are other subsets of X that contain more than one element.\n\nTherefore, the power set of X must have at least 5 + 2 = 7 elements (the empty set, X itself, and the 5 single-element subsets). Since the actual size of the power set of X is 32, which is greater than 7, we can conclude that the size of the power set of X is always larger than 5."
