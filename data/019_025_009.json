    "message_2": "To determine the number of different ways to order a set of 5 cards without replacement, we can use the concept of permutations. In this case, we have 5 cards and we want to arrange all of them, so we will use the formula for permutations:\n\nn! / (n - r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (cards) and r is the number of items we want to arrange. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5.\n\n5! / (5 - 5)!\n\n5! / 0!\n\n5! / 1 (since 0! = 1)\n\nNow, we need to calculate 5! (5 factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to 5:\n\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 different ways to order a set of 5 cards without replacement."
