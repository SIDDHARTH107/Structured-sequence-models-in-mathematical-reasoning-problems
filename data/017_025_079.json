Determine the number of possible groups for each prime factor using the formula: n_p = (p^(k+1) - 1) / (p - 1), where p is the prime factor and k is the highest power of the prime factor dividing the order of the group.\n   - For p = 2, k = 3: n_2 = (2^(3+1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 15\n   - For p = 3, k = 1: n_3 = (3^(1+1) - 1) / (3 - 1) = 4\n   - For p = 5, k = 1: n_5 = (5^(1+1) - 1) / (5 - 1) = 6\n3. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order n: n = (n_p1 * n_p2 * ... * n_pk) / k!, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of n and n_pi is the number of possible groups for each prime factor.\n   - In this case, k = 3, so n = (15 * 4 * 6) / 3! = (360) / 6 = 60\n\nThere are 60 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
