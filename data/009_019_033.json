If X(0) = 1 and σ = 2, what is the expected value of X(2)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The given SDE is:\n\ndX(t) = X(t) dt + σ dw(t)\n\nwhere X(0) = 1, σ = 2, and dw(t) is a Wiener process with a standard deviation of 0.5.\n\nThis SDE is a linear SDE with constant coefficients, and it can be solved using the integrating factor method. The integrating factor is e^(∫dt) = e^t. Multiplying both sides of the SDE by the integrating factor, we get:\n\ne^t dX(t) = X(t) e^t dt + σ e^t dw(t)\n\nNow, the left-hand side is the differential of the product X(t)e^t:\n\nd(X(t)e^t) = X(t) e^t dt + σ e^t dw(t)\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to t from 0 to 2, we have:\n\n∫[d(X(t)e^t)] = ∫[X(t) e^t dt] + σ ∫[e^t dw(t)]\n\nX(2)e^2 - X(0)e^0 = ∫[X(t) e^t dt] + σ ∫[e^t dw(t)]\n\nSince X(0) = 1, we have:\n\nX(2)e^2 - 1 = ∫[X(t) e^t dt] + σ ∫[e^t dw(t)]\n\nNow, we need to find the expected value of X(2). The expected value of the stochastic integral ∫[e^t dw(t)] is 0. Therefore, we have:\n\nE[X(2)e^2 - 1] = E[∫[X(t) e^t dt]]\n\nE[X(2)e^2] - E[1] = E[∫[X(t) e^t dt]]\n\nE[X(2)e^2] - 1 = 0\n\nE[X(2)e^2] = 1\n\nE[X(2)] = e^(-2)\n\nE[X(2)] ≈ 0.1353\n\nSo, the expected value of X(2) is approximately 0.1353."
