    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a vehicle accident occurring on a busy street in a given week is 0.2. What is the probability that there will be at least two accidents on the street in a given week?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least two accidents occurring in a given week, we can use the complementary probability rule. This means we will find the probability of there being zero or one accident and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of at least two accidents.\n\nLet P(A) be the probability of an accident occurring in a given week, which is 0.2. Then, the probability of no accident occurring is P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of exactly one accident occurring in a week. We can use the binomial probability formula for this:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nIn this case, n = 1 (since we want exactly one accident), k = 1, and p = 0.2. So, the formula becomes:\n\nP(X = 1) = C(1, 1) * 0.2^1 * (1-0.2)^(1-1) = 1 * 0.2 * 1 = 0.2\n\nNow we have the probabilities of zero accidents (0.8) and one accident (0.2). To find the probability of at least two accidents, we subtract the sum of these probabilities from 1:\n\nP(at least 2 accidents) = 1 - (P(0 accidents) + P(1 accident)) = 1 - (0.8 + 0.2) = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nHowever, this result assumes that there can only be a maximum of one accident per week, which is not realistic. To accurately calculate the probability of at least two accidents, we would need more information about the distribution of accidents per week (e.g., if it follows a Poisson distribution or another distribution)."
