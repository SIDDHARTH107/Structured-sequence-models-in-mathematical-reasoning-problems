    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation with the given initial condition, we first need to find the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator:\n\n$$H = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + x^2$$\n\nWe can solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n\n$$H\\phi_n(x) = E_n\\phi_n(x)$$\n\nThe eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator potential are known to be the Hermite functions:\n\n$$\\phi_n(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n n!}}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/4}e^{-x^2/2}H_n(x)$$\n\nwhere $H_n(x)$ are the Hermite polynomials and the eigenvalues are given by:\n\n$$E_n = n + \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNow, we can expand the initial condition in terms of the eigenfunctions:\n\n$$\\psi(x,0) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}c_n\\phi_n(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $c_n$, we can use the orthogonality property of the eigenfunctions:\n\n$$c_n = \\int_0^1 \\sin(\\pi x)\\phi_n(x) dx$$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation as:\n\n$$\\psi(x,t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}c_n\\phi_n(x)e^{-iE_nt}$$\n\nTo compute the expectation value of $x^2$, we use the following formula:\n\n$$\\langle x^2 \\rangle = \\int_0^1 \\psi^*(x,t) x^2 \\psi(x,t) dx$$\n\nSubstituting the general solution:\n\n$$\\langle x^2 \\rangle = \\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}c_n^*\\phi_n^*(x)e^{iE_nt}\\right) x^2 \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty}c_m\\phi_m(x)e^{-iE_mt}\\right) dx$$\n\nUsing the orthogonality property of the eigenfunctions, we can simplify the expression:\n\n$$\\langle x^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}|c_n|^2\\int_0^1 \\phi_n^*(x) x^2 \\phi_n(x) dx$$\n\nNow, we need to compute the integral for each $n$ and sum them up. However, this is a complicated task and usually requires numerical methods to obtain an accurate result. The expectation value of $x^2$ will depend on the coefficients $c_n$ and the specific form of the Hermite functions."
