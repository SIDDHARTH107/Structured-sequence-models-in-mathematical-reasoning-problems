    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 6 vertices and the following edges: {(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,6),(6,1)}. Find the perfect matching in this graph if it exists, otherwise prove that it does not exist.",
    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges share a vertex.\n\nIn this graph, we can see that it is a cycle of length 6. To find a perfect matching, we can simply choose every other edge in the cycle. This will give us the following perfect matching:\n\n{(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)}\n\nThis perfect matching includes all 6 vertices, and each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the set. Therefore, a perfect matching exists in this graph."
