    "message_2": "To find the Fourier Transform of the given signal, we need to apply the Fourier Transform formula:\n\nF(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} f(t) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier Transform of the signal f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1).\n\nThe given signal f(t) is a sum of two functions:\n\nf(t) = 3sin(2πt/5) + 5cos(4πt/5)\n\nLet's find the Fourier Transform of each function separately and then add them together.\n\n1) For the first function, g(t) = 3sin(2πt/5):\n\nG(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} 3sin(2πt/5) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let u = 3sin(2πt/5) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = (6π/5)cos(2πt/5) dt and v = -j/ω * e^(-jωt).\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\nG(ω) = uv |_{-∞}^{∞} - ∫_{-∞}^{∞} v du\n\nG(ω) = -3j/ω * e^(-jωt) * sin(2πt/5) |_{-∞}^{∞} - (-j/ω) * ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-jωt) * (6π/5)cos(2πt/5) dt\n\nThe first term goes to zero because sin(2πt/5) is a periodic function with finite period, and e^(-jωt) oscillates infinitely many times within that period. So, we are left with:\n\nG(ω) = (6πj/5ω) * ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-jωt) * cos(2πt/5) dt\n\nNow, we can use the Euler's formula to rewrite the cosine function:\n\ncos(x) = (e^(jx) + e^(-jx))/2\n\nG(ω) = (6πj/10ω) * ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-jωt) * (e^(j(2πt/5)) + e^(-j(2πt/5))) dt\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nG(ω) = (6πj/10ω) * [∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-jωt) * e^(j(2πt/5)) dt + ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-jωt) * e^(-j(2πt/5)) dt]\n\nG(ω) = (6πj/10ω) * [∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-j(ω - 2π/5)t) dt + ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-j(ω + 2π/5)t) dt]\n\nNow, we have two integrals of the form ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-jαt) dt. These integrals are zero for all α ≠ 0 and infinite for α = 0. Therefore, G(ω) will be non-zero only when ω = ±2π/5, and it will be infinite at these points. To represent this, we use the Dirac delta function, δ(ω):\n\nG(ω) = (6πj/10ω) * [π * δ(ω - 2π/5) + π * δ(ω + 2π/5)]\n\nG(ω) = (3j/ω) * [δ(ω - 2π/5) + δ(ω + 2π/5)]\n\n2) For the second function, h(t) = 5cos(4πt/5):\n\nH(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} 5cos(4πt/5) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nUsing the same approach as before, we rewrite the cosine function using Euler's formula and split the integral into two parts:\n\nH(ω) = (5/2) * [∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-j(ω - 4π/5)t) dt + ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-j(ω + 4π/5)t) dt]\n\nH(ω) = (5/2) * [π * δ(ω - 4π/5) + π * δ(ω + 4π/5)]\n\nNow, we can add the Fourier Transforms of the two functions to get the Fourier Transform of the original signal:\n\nF(ω) = G(ω) + H(ω)\n\nF(ω) = (3j/ω) * [δ(ω - 2π/5) + δ(ω + 2π/5)] + (5/2) * [δ(ω - 4π/5) + δ(ω + 4π/5)]\n\nThis is the Fourier Transform of the given signal f(t) = 3sin(2πt/5) + 5cos(4πt/5)."
