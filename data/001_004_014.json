    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 6x^2 - 17x + 5 = 0, we can try to factor the polynomial. However, since it's not easily factorable, we can use the quadratic formula instead. The quadratic formula is given by:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 6, b = -17, and c = 5. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nx = (17 ± √((-17)²-4(6)(5))) / (2(6))\n\nx = (17 ± √(289-120)) / 12\n\nx = (17 ± √169) / 12\n\nx = (17 ± 13) / 12\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (17 + 13) / 12\nx = 30 / 12\nx = 5/2\n\nand\n\nx = (17 - 13) / 12\nx = 4 / 12\nx = 1/3\n\nSo, the values of x that satisfy the equation are x = 5/2 and x = 1/3."
