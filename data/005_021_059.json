    "message_2": "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean using the bootstrapping method, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples from the original sample (with replacement).\n2. Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample.\n3. Order the bootstrap sample means.\n4. Find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the bootstrap sample means.\n\nSince we don't have the actual data points, we can't perform the bootstrapping method directly. However, we can use the Central Limit Theorem to approximate the confidence interval, which is a common approach when the sample size is large enough (n ≥ 30). In this case, the sample size is 25, which is slightly below the threshold, but we can still use this approach to get an approximate confidence interval.\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed with mean equal to the population mean (μ) and standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, we have:\nSample mean (x̄) = 60\nSample standard deviation (s) = 10\nSample size (n) = 25\n\nSince we don't know the population standard deviation, we'll use the sample standard deviation as an estimate. The standard error (SE) is calculated as:\n\nSE = s / √n = 10 / √25 = 10 / 5 = 2\n\nNow, we can calculate the 95% confidence interval using the z-score for a 95% confidence level, which is 1.96:\n\nMargin of error (ME) = z-score * SE = 1.96 * 2 = 3.92\n\nConfidence interval = (x̄ - ME, x̄ + ME) = (60 - 3.92, 60 + 3.92) = (56.08, 63.92)\n\nSo, the estimated 95% confidence interval for the population mean using the Central Limit Theorem is approximately (56.08, 63.92). Keep in mind that this is an approximation, and the bootstrapping method might give slightly different results if we had the actual data points."
