    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix, which we'll call D. The coefficient matrix is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & -5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe determinant D is calculated as follows:\n\n$$\nD = (2 \\times -5) - (3 \\times 4) = -10 - 12 = -22\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the determinants of the matrices formed by replacing the columns of the coefficient matrix with the constants from the right-hand side of the equations. We'll call these determinants D_x and D_y.\n\nFor D_x, replace the first column of the coefficient matrix with the constants:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n7 & 3 \\\\\n-19 & -5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nCalculate the determinant D_x:\n\n$$\nD_x = (7 \\times -5) - (3 \\times -19) = -35 + 57 = 22\n$$\n\nFor D_y, replace the second column of the coefficient matrix with the constants:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 7 \\\\\n4 & -19\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nCalculate the determinant D_y:\n\n$$\nD_y = (2 \\times -19) - (7 \\times 4) = -38 - 28 = -66\n$$\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y using Cramer's rule:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{D_x}{D} = \\frac{22}{-22} = -1\n$$\n\n$$\ny = \\frac{D_y}{D} = \\frac{-66}{-22} = 3\n$$\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n$$\nx = -1, y = 3\n$$"
