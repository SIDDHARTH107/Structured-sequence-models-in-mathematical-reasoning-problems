    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P, we first need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A.\n\nMatrix A:\n[1 4]\n[5 2]\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI:\n[1-λ  4 ]\n[ 5  2-λ]\n\nNow, we compute the determinant:\n\n(1-λ)(2-λ) - (4)(5) = λ^2 - 3λ - 18 = (λ - 6)(λ + 3)\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ1 = 6 and λ2 = -3.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors:\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors associated with each eigenvalue by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFor λ1 = 6:\n(A - 6I)v = 0\n[-5  4] [x1]   [0]\n[ 5  -4] [x2]   [0]\n\nWe can simplify this system to:\n-5x1 + 4x2 = 0\nx1 = (4/5)x2\n\nLet x2 = 5, then x1 = 4. So, the eigenvector v1 = [4, 5].\n\nFor λ2 = -3:\n(A - (-3)I)v = 0\n[ 4  4] [x1]   [0]\n[ 5  5] [x2]   [0]\n\nWe can simplify this system to:\n4x1 + 4x2 = 0\nx1 = -x2\n\nLet x2 = 1, then x1 = -1. So, the eigenvector v2 = [-1, 1].\n\n3. Form the matrix P and D:\nNow that we have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns, and the diagonal matrix D using the eigenvalues as diagonal entries.\n\nMatrix P:\n[ 4 -1]\n[ 5  1]\n\nMatrix D:\n[ 6  0]\n[ 0 -3]\n\n4. Verify the result:\nTo verify that P^(-1)AP = D, we need to compute the inverse of P and then multiply the matrices.\n\nP^(-1) = (1/det(P)) * adj(P)\ndet(P) = (4)(1) - (-1)(5) = 9\n\nadj(P) = [ 1  1]\n         [-5  4]\n\nP^(-1) = (1/9) * [ 1  1]\n                [-5  4]\n\nNow, compute P^(-1)AP:\n\nP^(-1)AP = (1/9) * [ 1  1] * [1 4; 5 2] * [ 4 -1]\n                  [-5  4]                 [ 5  1]\n\n= (1/9) * [ 1  1] * [41  1]\n          [-5  4]   [ 5 22]\n\n= (1/9) * [36  23]\n          [-5  86]\n\n= [ 6  0]\n  [ 0 -3]\n\nIndeed, P^(-1)AP = D. So, we have found the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P such that P^(-1)AP = D."
