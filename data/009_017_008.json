    "message_1": "Consider an electromagnetic wave that propagates in a vacuum with a frequency of 100 MHz. If the amplitude of the electric field of this wave at a particular point in space is 2 V/m, what is the amplitude of its magnetic field at the same point? Use Maxwell's equations to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "In a vacuum, the relationship between the amplitudes of the electric field (E) and the magnetic field (B) in an electromagnetic wave can be derived from Maxwell's equations. Specifically, we can use the equation:\n\nE = c * B\n\nwhere c is the speed of light in a vacuum, approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nGiven the amplitude of the electric field E = 2 V/m, we can solve for the amplitude of the magnetic field B:\n\nB = E / c\nB = (2 V/m) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)\nB â‰ˆ 6.67 x 10^-9 T (Tesla)\n\nSo, the amplitude of the magnetic field at the same point is approximately 6.67 x 10^-9 T."
