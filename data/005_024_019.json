The following data shows the total amount spent by 20 customers:\n\n$10, $15, $17, $25, $30, $30, $35, $40, $45, $50, $55, $60, $75, $80, $90, $100, $150, $200, $250, $500\n\nWhat is the median and the mean total amount spent by the company's customers in the last three months?",
    "message_2": "To find the median, we first need to arrange the data in ascending order, which is already done in this case. Since there are 20 customers (an even number), the median will be the average of the 10th and 11th values.\n\nMedian = (50 + 55) / 2 = 105 / 2 = $52.50\n\nTo find the mean, we need to add up all the amounts and divide by the number of customers (20).\n\nMean = (10 + 15 + 17 + 25 + 30 + 30 + 35 + 40 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 60 + 75 + 80 + 90 + 100 + 150 + 200 + 250 + 500) / 20\nMean = 1627 / 20 = $81.35\n\nSo, the median total amount spent by the customers in the last three months is $52.50, and the mean total amount spent is $81.35."
