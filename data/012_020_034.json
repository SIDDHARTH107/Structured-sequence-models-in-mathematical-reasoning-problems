    "message_2": "To find the automorphism group of the graph G with 6 vertices and 8 edges, we first need to know the structure of the graph. Since there are multiple possible graphs with 6 vertices and 8 edges, we cannot determine the automorphism group without more information about the specific graph.\n\nAn automorphism group of a graph is a set of all permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relations between the vertices. In other words, it is a group of all isomorphisms of the graph to itself.\n\nIf you can provide more information about the structure of the graph G, I can help you find the automorphism group."
