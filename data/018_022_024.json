The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {2, 3, 4, 5} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {3, 4} (intersection of A and B)\n\nA ∆ B = {2, 3, 4, 5} - {3, 4} = {2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B ∆ A.\n\nB ∆ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {2, 3, 4, 5} (union of B and A)\nB ∩ A = {3, 4} (intersection of B and A)\n\nB ∆ A = {2, 3, 4, 5} - {3, 4} = {2, 5}\n\nNow, we can see that A ∆ B = B ∆ A = {2, 5}.
