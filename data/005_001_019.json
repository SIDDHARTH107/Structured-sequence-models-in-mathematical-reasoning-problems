    "message_1": "The mean weight of packages of chips produced by a company is supposed to be 6 ounces. However, a consumer group suspects that the actual mean weight is less than advertised. They take a sample of 50 packages and find that the mean weight is 5.8 ounces with a standard deviation of 0.6 ounces. Test the hypothesis that the actual mean weight is less than 6 ounces at a 5% level of significance.",
    "message_2": "To test the hypothesis that the actual mean weight is less than 6 ounces at a 5% level of significance, we will perform a one-sample t-test. \n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 6 ounces (the mean weight is equal to 6 ounces)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ < 6 ounces (the mean weight is less than 6 ounces)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the test statistic\nWe will use the t-test statistic formula: t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nt = (5.8 - 6) / (0.6 / √50)\nt = (-0.2) / (0.6 / 7.071)\nt = -0.2 / 0.0849\nt ≈ -2.36\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value\nSince we are testing at a 5% level of significance and it's a one-tailed test, we will look up the critical value in the t-distribution table for α = 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49.\n\nThe critical value for a one-tailed test with α = 0.05 and df = 49 is approximately -1.68.\n\nStep 4: Compare the test statistic to the critical value\nOur test statistic t ≈ -2.36 is less than the critical value -1.68.\n\nStep 5: Make a decision\nSince the test statistic is less than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis. There is enough evidence to support the consumer group's claim that the actual mean weight of the packages of chips is less than 6 ounces at a 5% level of significance."
