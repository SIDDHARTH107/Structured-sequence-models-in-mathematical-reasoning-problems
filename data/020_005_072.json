    "message_1": "A furniture manufacturer wants to produce chairs and tables using three different types of machines: A, B, and C. Each chair requires 4 hours on machine A, 3 hours on machine B, and 2 hours on machine C. Each table requires 2 hours on machine A, 5 hours on machine B, and 3 hours on machine C. Machine A can be used for a maximum of 80 hours per week, machine B can be used for a maximum of 60 hours per week, and machine C can be used for a maximum of 100 hours per week. The profit for each chair is $10 and the profit for each table is $20. What is the maximum profit that the manufacturer can earn per week by producing chairs and tables? Determine the optimal number of chairs and tables that should be produced to maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs produced and y be the number of tables produced.\n\nThe constraints for the machines are as follows:\n\nMachine A: 4x + 2y ≤ 80\nMachine B: 3x + 5y ≤ 60\nMachine C: 2x + 3y ≤ 100\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 20y\n\nWe will now solve the system of inequalities to find the feasible region:\n\n1. Rearrange the inequalities to solve for y:\n\nMachine A: y ≤ (80 - 4x) / 2\nMachine B: y ≤ (60 - 3x) / 5\nMachine C: y ≤ (100 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. Graph the inequalities and find the feasible region:\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 20), (10, 20), (20, 10), and (20, 0).\n\n3. Calculate the profit at each vertex:\n\nPoint (0, 0): Profit = 10(0) + 20(0) = $0\nPoint (0, 20): Profit = 10(0) + 20(20) = $400\nPoint (10, 20): Profit = 10(10) + 20(20) = $500\nPoint (20, 10): Profit = 10(20) + 20(10) = $400\nPoint (20, 0): Profit = 10(20) + 20(0) = $200\n\n4. Determine the maximum profit and the optimal number of chairs and tables:\n\nThe maximum profit is $500 per week, which occurs when the manufacturer produces 10 chairs and 20 tables."
