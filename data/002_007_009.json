    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm and its two bases are 10 cm and 16 cm long. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height\n\nIn this case, base1 = 10 cm, base2 = 16 cm, and the height = 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (10 + 16) * 8\nArea = (1/2) * (26) * 8\nArea = 13 * 8\nArea = 104 cmÂ²\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 104 square centimeters."
