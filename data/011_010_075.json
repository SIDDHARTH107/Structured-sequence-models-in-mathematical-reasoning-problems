    "message_1": "A building has n floors, and there is only one staircase from ground floor to the top floor. How many ways are there to traverse the staircase such that you never go below the ground floor or above the top floor? (Hint: The answer involves Catalan numbers)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Catalan numbers. Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that have many applications in combinatorial mathematics, including counting certain types of lattice paths.\n\nIn this case, we can represent the traversal of the staircase as a lattice path on a grid, where each step up corresponds to moving right and each step down corresponds to moving up. We can only take n steps up and n steps down, so the path will be contained within an n x n grid. We want to count the number of paths that start at the bottom-left corner (0, 0), end at the top-right corner (n, n), and never go above the main diagonal (i.e., the line y = x).\n\nThese paths are counted by the Catalan numbers, which are defined by the following formula:\n\nC_n = (1 / (n + 1)) * (2n choose n) = (1 / (n + 1)) * (2n! / (n! * n!))\n\nwhere n is the number of floors in the building, and C_n is the nth Catalan number.\n\nSo, the number of ways to traverse the staircase without going below the ground floor or above the top floor is given by the nth Catalan number, C_n."
