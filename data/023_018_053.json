    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the system, we first assume a solution of the form:\n$$y_{ss}(t) = A\\sin(3t) + B\\cos(3t)$$\nwhere A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nNow, we will differentiate $y_{ss}(t)$ with respect to time to find the first and second derivatives:\n$$\\frac{dy_{ss}(t)}{dt} = 3A\\cos(3t) - 3B\\sin(3t)$$\n$$\\frac{d^2y_{ss}(t)}{dt^2} = -9A\\sin(3t) - 9B\\cos(3t)$$\n\nSubstitute these expressions for $y_{ss}(t)$, $\\frac{dy_{ss}(t)}{dt}$, and $\\frac{d^2y_{ss}(t)}{dt^2}$ into the given differential equation:\n$$(-9A\\sin(3t) - 9B\\cos(3t)) + 4(3A\\cos(3t) - 3B\\sin(3t)) + 5(A\\sin(3t) + B\\cos(3t)) = \\sin(3t)$$\n\nNow, we equate the coefficients of the sine and cosine terms on both sides of the equation:\n$$(-9A - 12B + 5A)\\sin(3t) + (-9B + 12A + 5B)\\cos(3t) = \\sin(3t)$$\n\nThis gives us the following system of equations:\n$$-4A - 12B = 1$$\n$$12A + (-4B) = 0$$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that A = 1/4 and B = 1/4. Therefore, the steady-state response is:\n$$y_{ss}(t) = \\frac{1}{4}\\sin(3t) + \\frac{1}{4}\\cos(3t)$$"
