    "message_1": "A certain amount of radioactive material has a half-life of 20 years. If the initial amount of the material is 1000 grams, how much will be left after 60 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 1000 grams, the time elapsed is 60 years, and the half-life is 20 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 1000 * (1/2)^(60 / 20)\n\nFinal amount = 1000 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal amount = 1000 * (1/8)\n\nFinal amount = 125 grams\n\nSo, after 60 years, there will be 125 grams of the radioactive material left."
