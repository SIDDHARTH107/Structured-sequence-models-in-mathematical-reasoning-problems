    "message_2": "The intersection pairing $<A, B>$ cannot be determined solely in terms of the genus $g$ of the surface $X$. The intersection pairing depends on the specific homotopy classes of the curves $A$ and $B$ on the surface, and not just the genus of the surface.\n\nIn general, the intersection pairing $<A, B>$ is defined as the algebraic count of the intersection points of the curves $A$ and $B$. The algebraic count takes into account the orientation of the surface and the curves, assigning a positive or negative sign to each intersection point depending on the relative orientation of the tangent vectors of the curves at the intersection point.\n\nFor a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, there is a standard basis for the homology group $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$, which consists of $2g$ curves, say $\\{a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \\dots, a_g, b_g\\}$. These curves are chosen such that they intersect transversely and have the following intersection pairings:\n\n- $<a_i, a_j> = <b_i, b_j> = 0$ for all $i, j = 1, 2, \\dots, g$\n- $<a_i, b_j> = \\delta_{ij}$ for all $i, j = 1, 2, \\dots, g$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if $i = j$ and 0 otherwise.\n\nGiven two distinct embedded closed curves $A$ and $B$ on $X$, we can express them as linear combinations of the standard basis elements:\n\n- $A = \\sum_{i=1}^g (m_i a_i + n_i b_i)$\n- $B = \\sum_{i=1}^g (p_i a_i + q_i b_i)$\n\nwhere $m_i, n_i, p_i, q_i$ are integers. Then, the intersection pairing $<A, B>$ can be computed as:\n\n$<A, B> = \\sum_{i=1}^g \\sum_{j=1}^g (m_i p_j <a_i, a_j> + m_i q_j <a_i, b_j> + n_i p_j <b_i, a_j> + n_i q_j <b_i, b_j>)$\n\nUsing the properties of the standard basis intersection pairings, this simplifies to:\n\n$<A, B> = \\sum_{i=1}^g (m_i q_i - n_i p_i)$\n\nAs we can see, the intersection pairing $<A, B>$ depends on the specific coefficients $m_i, n_i, p_i, q_i$, which in turn depend on the homotopy classes of the curves $A$ and $B$. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the intersection pairing solely in terms of the genus $g$ of the surface $X$."
