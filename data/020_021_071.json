    "message_2": "To find the minimum time in which the project can be completed, we need to determine the combined work rate of the three workers.\n\nLet's denote the work rate of each worker as follows:\nWorker 1: W1 = 1/5 (completes 1/5 of the project per day)\nWorker 2: W2 = 1/6 (completes 1/6 of the project per day)\nWorker 3: W3 = 1/10 (completes 1/10 of the project per day)\n\nNow, we can find the combined work rate by adding the individual work rates:\nCombined work rate = W1 + W2 + W3 = (1/5) + (1/6) + (1/10)\n\nTo add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which in this case is 30. So, we have:\nCombined work rate = (6/30) + (5/30) + (3/30) = 14/30\n\nNow, to find the minimum time required to complete the project, we need to find the reciprocal of the combined work rate:\nMinimum time = 1 / (Combined work rate) = 1 / (14/30)\n\nMinimum time = 30/14 = 15/7\n\nSo, the minimum time required to complete the project is 15/7 days, or approximately 2.14 days."
