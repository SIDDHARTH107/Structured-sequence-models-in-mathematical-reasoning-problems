    "message_2": "To find the rate at which the height of the water is increasing, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nSince the tank is filling at a rate of 5 cubic feet per minute, we have dV/dt = 5 ft³/min. We are given the radius r = 5 feet and want to find the rate of change of the height, dh/dt, when the height h = 2 feet.\n\nFirst, we can differentiate the volume formula with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = d(πr^2h)/dt = πr^2(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for dh/dt:\n\n5 = π(5^2)(dh/dt)\n\n5 = 25π(dh/dt)\n\nTo isolate dh/dt, divide both sides by 25π:\n\ndh/dt = 5 / (25π)\n\ndh/dt ≈ 1 / (5π)\n\nSo, the height of the water is increasing at a rate of approximately 1/(5π) feet per minute when the water is 2 feet deep."
