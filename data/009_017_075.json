    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point 4 mm away from the wire's center, we can use Ampere's Law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the total current enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, Ampere's Law is written as:\n\n∮ B • dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a long straight wire, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. Therefore, we can choose a circular loop with a radius of 4 mm as our path for the line integral. The magnetic field (B) is tangent to the loop at every point, and the differential length element (dl) is also tangent to the loop. Thus, the dot product B • dl = B * dl, and the integral becomes:\n\n∮ B dl = B * ∮ dl\n\nSince B is constant along the circular loop, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB * ∮ dl = B * (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere r is the radius of the loop, which is 4 mm in this case.\n\nNow, we need to find the current enclosed by the loop. Since the wire has a radius of 2 mm and carries a current of 4 A, the entire current is enclosed by the loop. Therefore, I_enclosed = 4 A.\n\nUsing Ampere's Law, we have:\n\nB * (2 * π * r) = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I_enclosed) / (2 * π * r)\n\nThe permeability of free space (μ₀) is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 4 A) / (2 * π * 4 × 10^(-3) m)\n\nB = (16π × 10^(-7) Tm) / (8π × 10^(-3) m)\n\nB = 2 × 10^(-4) T\n\nSo, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point 4 mm away from the wire's center is 2 × 10^(-4) Tesla."
