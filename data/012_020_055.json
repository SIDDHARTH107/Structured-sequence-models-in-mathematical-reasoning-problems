    "message_2": "To find the automorphism group of a graph G with 6 vertices and 7 edges, we first need to determine the possible structures of the graph. Since the graph is simple and undirected, there are no self-loops or multiple edges between vertices.\n\nThere are two possible structures for a graph with 6 vertices and 7 edges:\n\n1. A tree with one additional edge: In this case, the graph would have a cycle of length 3 or 4. The automorphism group would depend on the specific structure of the tree. For example, if the tree is a star (one central vertex connected to all others), the automorphism group would be the symmetric group S5, which has 120 elements. If the tree has a different structure, the automorphism group would be smaller.\n\n2. A cycle of length 6 with one additional edge: In this case, the graph would have a cycle of length 6 and another cycle of length 3 or 4. The automorphism group would be the dihedral group D6, which has 12 elements.\n\nWithout more information about the specific structure of the graph, it is not possible to determine the exact automorphism group. However, it will be one of the groups mentioned above, depending on the structure of the graph."
