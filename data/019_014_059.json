Each person has a favorite color - blue, green, red, purple, and yellow, but not necessarily in that order. \n\nUsing higher-order logic, write down a statement that finds the person who loves purple and their favorite number (from 1-10).",
    "message_2": "Let P(x, y) represent the statement \"person x has favorite color y,\" and let N(x, z) represent the statement \"person x has favorite number z.\" We are given that there are 5 people and 5 colors, so we can represent this information using the following higher-order logic statement:\n\n∃x∃y∃z∃w∃v∃a∃b∃c∃d∃e (P(x, purple) ∧ N(x, a) ∧ 1 ≤ a ≤ 10 ∧ P(y, blue) ∧ P(z, green) ∧ P(w, red) ∧ P(v, yellow) ∧ x ≠ y ≠ z ≠ w ≠ v)\n\nThis statement says that there exists a person x who has the favorite color purple and a favorite number a between 1 and 10, and there exist other people y, z, w, and v with different favorite colors blue, green, red, and yellow, respectively, such that all the people are distinct."
