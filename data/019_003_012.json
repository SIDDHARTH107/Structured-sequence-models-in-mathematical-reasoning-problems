    "message_1": "In modal logic, possible worlds are often represented as nodes in a graph. Consider a Kripke model with the following graph:\n\n- Node 1 is labeled \"p\".\n- Node 2 is labeled \"q\".\n- There is a directed edge from node 1 to node 2.\n\nWhat is the truth value of the formula \"~(p & ~q)\" at node 1?",
    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of the formula \"~(p & ~q)\" at node 1, we need to evaluate the formula at that node.\n\nAt node 1, the proposition \"p\" is true, and since there is a directed edge from node 1 to node 2, we can consider the truth value of \"q\" at node 2. At node 2, the proposition \"q\" is true.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the formula:\n\n1. ~(p & ~q)\n2. ~(True & ~True) (since p is true at node 1 and q is true at node 2)\n3. ~(True & False) (since ~True is False)\n4. ~False\n\nThe negation of False is True. Therefore, the truth value of the formula \"~(p & ~q)\" at node 1 is True."
