    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem related to radioactive decay and half-life equations:\n\nThe half-life of a radioactive substance is 10 years. If the initial mass of the substance was 100 grams, what will be the mass of the substance after 30 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 100 grams, the half-life is 10 years, and the time elapsed is 30 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 100 * (1/2)^(30 / 10)\n\nFinal mass = 100 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal mass = 100 * (1/8)\n\nFinal mass = 12.5 grams\n\nSo, after 30 years, the mass of the radioactive substance will be 12.5 grams."
