    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve in the subtopic of Hypothesis testing:\n\nA manufacturer of light bulbs claims that their bulbs have an average lifespan of 10,000 hours. A random sample of 50 bulbs is selected and tested, with a resulting mean lifespan of 9,800 hours and a standard deviation of 300 hours. Conduct a hypothesis test at the 5% level of significance to determine if there is enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim.",
    "message_2": "To conduct a hypothesis test at the 5% level of significance, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. State the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1).\n2. Determine the test statistic.\n3. Determine the critical value and the rejection region.\n4. Compare the test statistic to the critical value and make a decision.\n\nStep 1: State the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1)\nH0: μ = 10,000 (the average lifespan of the bulbs is 10,000 hours)\nH1: μ ≠ 10,000 (the average lifespan of the bulbs is not 10,000 hours)\n\nStep 2: Determine the test statistic\nWe will use a t-test since the population standard deviation is unknown. The test statistic (t) is calculated as follows:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\nt = (9,800 - 10,000) / (300 / sqrt(50))\nt = (-200) / (300 / sqrt(50))\nt ≈ -2.915\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value and the rejection region\nSince we are conducting a two-tailed test at the 5% level of significance, we will have a 2.5% rejection region in each tail. The degrees of freedom (df) for this test is (sample size - 1), which is 49. Using a t-distribution table, we find the critical value for a two-tailed test with df = 49 and α = 0.05 to be approximately ±2.009.\n\nStep 4: Compare the test statistic to the critical value and make a decision\nOur test statistic, t ≈ -2.915, falls in the rejection region (t < -2.009). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis (H0).\n\nConclusion:\nThere is enough evidence at the 5% level of significance to reject the manufacturer's claim that their bulbs have an average lifespan of 10,000 hours."
