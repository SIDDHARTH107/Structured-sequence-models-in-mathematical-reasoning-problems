    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product A x B, we form all possible ordered pairs with the first element from set A and the second element from set B. Similarly, to find B x A, we form all possible ordered pairs with the first element from set B and the second element from set A.\n\nA x B = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n\nB x A = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets A x B and B x A. We can see that the ordered pairs in A x B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B x A. For example, (1,3) is in A x B but not in B x A, and (3,1) is in B x A but not in A x B.\n\nSince A x B and B x A are not equal, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
