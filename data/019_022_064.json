    "message_1": "A student is trying to decide which class to take next semester. They have 5 options with different grades and credits: \n\n- Class A: 3 credits, grade B \n- Class B: 4 credits, grade A \n- Class C: 2 credits, grade A- \n- Class D: 3 credits, grade C+ \n- Class E: 4 credits, grade B- \n\nUsing expected value analysis, which class should the student choose if they care only about getting the highest possible GPA?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best class to take based on maximizing GPA, we first need to assign numerical values to the letter grades:\n\n- A = 4.0\n- A- = 3.7\n- B+ = 3.3\n- B = 3.0\n- B- = 2.7\n- C+ = 2.3\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected value (EV) for each class by multiplying the grade value by the number of credits:\n\n- Class A: 3 credits, grade B (3.0) -> EV = 3 * 3.0 = 9.0\n- Class B: 4 credits, grade A (4.0) -> EV = 4 * 4.0 = 16.0\n- Class C: 2 credits, grade A- (3.7) -> EV = 2 * 3.7 = 7.4\n- Class D: 3 credits, grade C+ (2.3) -> EV = 3 * 2.3 = 6.9\n- Class E: 4 credits, grade B- (2.7) -> EV = 4 * 2.7 = 10.8\n\nBased on the expected value analysis, the student should choose Class B, as it has the highest expected value (16.0) and will contribute the most to their GPA."
