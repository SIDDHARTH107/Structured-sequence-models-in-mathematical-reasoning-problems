    "message_1": "A guitar string is modeled as a wave propagating on a string fixed at both ends. The string is 50 cm long and has a tension of 80 N. The linear density of the string is 0.01 kg/m. If the string is plucked, it vibrates with a frequency of 500 Hz. The student is required to use Fourier transform to calculate the amplitude of all harmonics (up to the 10th harmonic) present in the wave.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the amplitude of all harmonics (up to the 10th harmonic) present in the wave, we will first find the fundamental frequency and then use the Fourier series to find the amplitudes of the harmonics.\n\n1. Find the fundamental frequency (f1):\n\nThe fundamental frequency of a vibrating string fixed at both ends can be calculated using the formula:\n\nf1 = (1/2L) * sqrt(T/μ)\n\nwhere L is the length of the string, T is the tension, and μ is the linear density.\n\nGiven: L = 50 cm = 0.5 m, T = 80 N, and μ = 0.01 kg/m.\n\nf1 = (1/(2 * 0.5)) * sqrt(80/0.01) = (1/1) * sqrt(8000) = sqrt(8000) = 89.44 Hz (approximately)\n\n2. Find the amplitudes of the harmonics using Fourier series:\n\nThe Fourier series for the displacement of the string can be written as:\n\ny(x, t) = Σ (An * sin(n * π * x / L) * cos(2 * π * n * f1 * t))\n\nwhere An is the amplitude of the nth harmonic, x is the position along the string, and t is the time.\n\nSince the string is plucked and vibrates with a frequency of 500 Hz, we can assume that the displacement of the string at the plucking point is a triangular wave. The Fourier series for a triangular wave is given by:\n\nAn = (8 * h) / (n^2 * π^2) for odd n, and An = 0 for even n\n\nwhere h is the maximum displacement of the string at the plucking point.\n\nWe don't have the value of h, but we can find the relative amplitudes of the harmonics by calculating the An values for n = 1 to 10.\n\nA1 = (8 * h) / (1^2 * π^2) = (8 * h) / π^2\nA2 = 0 (since n is even)\nA3 = (8 * h) / (3^2 * π^2) = (8 * h) / (9 * π^2)\nA4 = 0 (since n is even)\nA5 = (8 * h) / (5^2 * π^2) = (8 * h) / (25 * π^2)\nA6 = 0 (since n is even)\nA7 = (8 * h) / (7^2 * π^2) = (8 * h) / (49 * π^2)\nA8 = 0 (since n is even)\nA9 = (8 * h) / (9^2 * π^2) = (8 * h) / (81 * π^2)\nA10 = 0 (since n is even)\n\nThese are the amplitudes of the harmonics up to the 10th harmonic, relative to the maximum displacement h at the plucking point. To find the actual amplitudes, the value of h would be needed."
