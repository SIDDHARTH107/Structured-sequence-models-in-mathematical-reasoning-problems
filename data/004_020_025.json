    "message_1": "A 50 Newton force acts on an object that moves along a straight line a distance of 10 meters. If the force is applied at an angle of 30 degrees to the direction of motion, find the work done by the force using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we need to calculate the component of the force that is acting in the direction of the motion. Since the force is applied at an angle of 30 degrees to the direction of motion, we can use the cosine function to find the component of the force in the direction of motion.\n\nF_x = F * cos(θ)\nF_x = 50 N * cos(30°)\n\nConverting the angle to radians:\n30° * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nF_x = 50 N * cos(π/6)\nF_x ≈ 43.30 N\n\nNow, we need to find the work done by this force. Work is defined as the integral of force with respect to distance:\n\nW = ∫ F_x dx\n\nSince the force is constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nW = F_x * ∫ dx\n\nWe need to integrate over the distance the object moves, which is from 0 to 10 meters:\n\nW = 43.30 N * ∫ dx from 0 to 10\n\nW = 43.30 N * [x] from 0 to 10\n\nW = 43.30 N * (10 - 0)\n\nW = 433 Nm\n\nSo, the work done by the force is 433 Nm."
