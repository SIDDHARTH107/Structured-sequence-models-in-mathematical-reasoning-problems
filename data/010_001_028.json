It is not open because it is not in τ. Its complement {c,d} is also not in τ, so it is not closed either.\n\n3. {b,c,d} is closed. Its complement {a} is in the topology τ.\n\n4. {c,d} is neither open nor closed. It is not open because it is not in τ. Its complement {a,b} is also not in τ, so it is not closed either.\n\n5. {a,b,c,d} is open since it belongs to the topology τ (it is equal to X). Additionally, its complement, the empty set {}, is also in τ, so it is also closed. In a topology, the whole set X and the empty set are always both open and closed."
