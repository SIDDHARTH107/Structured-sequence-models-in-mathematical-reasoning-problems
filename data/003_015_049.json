    "message_1": "A student is asked to find the period and amplitude of the function y= 4sin(3x). What is the period and amplitude of this function?",
    "message_2": "The given function is y = 4sin(3x).\n\nTo find the amplitude, we look at the coefficient of the sine function, which is 4 in this case. So, the amplitude is 4.\n\nTo find the period, we need to look at the coefficient of the x inside the sine function, which is 3. The general formula for the period of a sine function is (2π) / |B|, where B is the coefficient of x. In this case, B = 3.\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |3| = (2π) / 3\n\nSo, the amplitude is 4 and the period is (2π) / 3."
