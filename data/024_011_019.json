    "message_1": "Let $M$ be a two-dimensional manifold equipped with a Riemannian metric $g$. Let $u:M\\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a twice-differentiable function on $M$. Suppose the Laplacian $\\Delta u= \\operatorname{div} (\\operatorname{grad} u)$ of $u$ with respect to $g$ is given by $$\\Delta u= -2(x+y)e^{x+y},$$ where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates on $M$.\n\nFind the function $u$ defined on $M$.",
    "message_2": "To find the function $u$, we need to solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) for the Laplacian:\n\n$$\\Delta u = -2(x+y)e^{x+y}.$$\n\nFirst, let's compute the gradient and divergence in terms of the Riemannian metric $g$. In a local coordinate system $(x, y)$, the gradient of $u$ is given by\n\n$$\\operatorname{grad} u = g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x^i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j},$$\n\nwhere $g^{ij}$ are the components of the inverse metric tensor. The divergence of the gradient is then given by\n\n$$\\Delta u = \\operatorname{div} (\\operatorname{grad} u) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g)}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\left( \\sqrt{\\det(g)} g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x^j} \\right).$$\n\nNow, we can plug the given expression for the Laplacian into this formula and solve for $u$. Since we are not given any information about the Riemannian metric $g$, we will assume that $M$ is equipped with the standard Euclidean metric, i.e., $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ and $g^{ij} = \\delta^{ij}$. In this case, the Laplacian simplifies to the standard Laplacian in $\\mathbb{R}^2$:\n\n$$\\Delta u = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = -2(x+y)e^{x+y}.$$\n\nNow we have a PDE to solve:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = -2(x+y)e^{x+y}.$$\n\nTo solve this PDE, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Then the PDE becomes\n\n$$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = -2(x+y)e^{x+y}XY.$$\n\nDivide both sides by $XY$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -2(x+y)e^{x+y}.$$\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by setting each side equal to a constant:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -2(x+y)e^{x+y} - \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda.$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve:\n\n1. $X''(x) = \\lambda X(x) - 2(x+y)e^{x+y}X(x)$\n2. $Y''(y) = \\lambda Y(y) + 2(x+y)e^{x+y}Y(y)$\n\nUnfortunately, these ODEs do not have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. However, we can still express the solution $u(x, y)$ as a product of solutions to these ODEs:\n\n$$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y),$$\n\nwhere $X(x)$ and $Y(y)$ satisfy the ODEs above."
