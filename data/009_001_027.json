    "message_1": "A population of rabbits is introduced to a new island. The population grows at a rate proportional to the population itself, with a proportionality constant of 0.4. If there are initially 100 rabbits, what will be the population after 5 years? Solve this differential equation to find a formula for the population as a function of time, and use it to calculate the population after 5 years.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll first set up a differential equation to model the population growth. Let P(t) be the population of rabbits at time t (in years). The problem states that the rate of growth of the population is proportional to the population itself, with a proportionality constant of 0.4. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere dP/dt is the rate of change of the population with respect to time, k is the proportionality constant (0.4 in this case), and P is the population at time t.\n\nNow we have:\n\ndP/dt = 0.4P\n\nTo solve this first-order linear differential equation, we can use separation of variables. Divide both sides by P and multiply both sides by dt:\n\n(1/P) dP = 0.4 dt\n\nNow integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫0.4 dt\n\nln(P) = 0.4t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition that there are 100 rabbits at t = 0:\n\nln(100) = 0.4(0) + C\nC = ln(100)\n\nNow we can write the equation for the population as a function of time:\n\nln(P) = 0.4t + ln(100)\n\nTo solve for P, we can take the exponential of both sides:\n\nP(t) = e^(0.4t + ln(100))\n\nUsing the property of exponentials, we can rewrite this as:\n\nP(t) = e^(0.4t) * e^(ln(100))\n\nSince e^(ln(100)) = 100, we have:\n\nP(t) = 100 * e^(0.4t)\n\nNow we can find the population after 5 years by plugging in t = 5:\n\nP(5) = 100 * e^(0.4 * 5)\nP(5) = 100 * e^2\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(5) ≈ 100 * 7.389\nP(5) ≈ 738.9\n\nSo after 5 years, there will be approximately 739 rabbits on the island."
