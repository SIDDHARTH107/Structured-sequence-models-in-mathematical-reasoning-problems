    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. Each unit of product A requires 5 kg of material X and 3 kg of material Y, and sells for $100. Each unit of product B requires 4 kg of material X and 2 kg of material Y, and sells for $80. The company has 2500 kg of material X and 1500 kg of material Y available. The company wants to maximize its profit. Using the Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm, what is the optimal production plan for the company?",
    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the leadership hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves in nature. It is used to solve complex optimization problems. However, the problem presented can be solved using linear programming, which is a more suitable and efficient method for this type of problem.\n\nLet's define the variables:\nx = number of units of product A\ny = number of units of product B\n\nObjective function (profit to maximize):\nP = 100x + 80y\n\nConstraints (materials available):\n5x + 4y ≤ 2500 (material X)\n3x + 2y ≤ 1500 (material Y)\nx, y ≥ 0 (non-negative production)\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method or the simplex method.\n\nGraphical method:\n1. Plot the constraints on a graph.\n2. Identify the feasible region.\n3. Find the vertices of the feasible region.\n4. Evaluate the objective function at each vertex.\n5. Choose the vertex with the highest objective function value.\n\nSimplex method:\n1. Convert the inequalities into equalities by introducing slack variables.\n2. Set up the initial simplex tableau.\n3. Perform pivot operations until an optimal solution is reached.\n\nSolving this problem using the graphical method or the simplex method, we get the optimal production plan as follows:\n\nx = 300 units of product A\ny = 450 units of product B\n\nThe maximum profit the company can achieve is:\n\nP = 100(300) + 80(450) = 30,000 + 36,000 = $66,000"
