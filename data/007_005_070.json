    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8, 12, and 18, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n8 = 2^3\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n18 = 2 * 3^2\n\n2. Take the highest power of each prime factor present in the numbers:\n2^3, 3^2\n\n3. Multiply the highest powers of each prime factor together:\n2^3 * 3^2 = 8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, the least common multiple (LCM) of 8, 12, and 18 is 72."
