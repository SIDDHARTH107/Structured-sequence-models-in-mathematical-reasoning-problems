    "message_2": "To find the probability that both propositions P and Q are true at the same time, we can simply multiply their individual probabilities together, assuming that they are independent events.\n\nProbability(P and Q) = Probability(P) * Probability(Q)\n\nProbability(P and Q) = 0.8 * 0.6\n\nProbability(P and Q) = 0.48\n\nSo, the probability that both propositions P and Q are true at the same time is 48%."
