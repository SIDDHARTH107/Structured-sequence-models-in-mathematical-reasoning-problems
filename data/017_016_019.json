    "message_2": "Since G has order 27, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups (subgroups of order 3^2 = 9) must divide 27/9 = 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, there can be either 1 or 3 such subgroups. \n\nCase 1: There is only one 3-Sylow subgroup of order 9.\nLet H be this unique 3-Sylow subgroup. Since it is unique, it must be normal in G (by the Sylow Theorems). Now, we know that the order of H is 9, which is a power of a prime, so H must be a cyclic group (by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups). Therefore, H is a normal cyclic subgroup of G of order 9. \n\nNow, let K be a subgroup of G of order 3 (which must exist by Cauchy's Theorem). Since the order of K is prime, K is cyclic. Also, the orders of H and K are relatively prime, so H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element. Thus, we have a normal subgroup H of order 9 and a cyclic subgroup K of order 3 with trivial intersection. \n\nBy the product formula, we have |HK| = |H||K| / |H ∩ K| = 9 * 3 / 1 = 27. Since |HK| = |G|, we have HK = G. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of H and K, and G is isomorphic to the external direct product H × K. Since both H and K are cyclic, G is isomorphic to a direct product of two cyclic groups, which is abelian. In this case, H is cyclic of order 9, and G is an abelian group.\n\nCase 2: There are three 3-Sylow subgroups of order 9.\nLet H be one of these 3-Sylow subgroups. Since there are three such subgroups, H is not normal in G. However, we can consider the normalizer of H in G, denoted by N_G(H). The normalizer is the largest subgroup of G in which H is normal. By definition, H is a normal subgroup of N_G(H). \n\nNow, we know that H is not normal in G, so N_G(H) cannot be equal to G. Thus, the order of N_G(H) must be a proper divisor of 27. The only possibilities are 1, 3, and 9. If the order of N_G(H) is 1, then H is the trivial subgroup, which contradicts our assumption that H is not the identity. If the order of N_G(H) is 3, then H is a subgroup of order 9 contained in a group of order 3, which is impossible. Therefore, the order of N_G(H) must be 9. \n\nSince H is a subgroup of N_G(H) and both have order 9, we have H = N_G(H). This means that H is a normal subgroup of itself. Now, consider the quotient group G/H. Since H has order 9 and G has order 27, the quotient group G/H has order 27/9 = 3. Since the order of G/H is prime, G/H is a cyclic group. \n\nNow, let K be a subgroup of G such that G/H is isomorphic to K. Since G/H is cyclic of order 3, K must also be cyclic of order 3. Thus, we have a normal subgroup H of order 9 and a cyclic subgroup K of order 3. However, unlike in Case 1, their intersection is not necessarily trivial, and G is not necessarily a direct product of H and K. In this case, G is a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn conclusion, if H is a subgroup of G that is not the identity, then H is either a normal cyclic subgroup of order 9 (in which case G is abelian), or H is a normal subgroup of itself and G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 27."
