    "message_2": "The Hénon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, which is described by the following Hamiltonian:\n\nH(x, y, px, py) = 1/2 (px^2 + py^2) + 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) + a * (x^2 * y - b * y^3 / 3) + c * (x^4 / 4 + d * x^2 * y^2)\n\nwhere x and y are the coordinates, px and py are the corresponding momenta, and a, b, c, and d are constants.\n\nThe maximum Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions, and it is used to characterize the chaotic behavior of the system. However, calculating the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Hénon-Heiles system is not a trivial task, as it requires numerical simulations and the use of advanced algorithms.\n\nGiven the values a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, and d = 1, the Hamiltonian becomes:\n\nH(x, y, px, py) = 1/2 (px^2 + py^2) + 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) + x^2 * y - y^3 / 3 + x^4 / 4 + x^2 * y^2\n\nTo find the maximum Lyapunov exponent for this specific case, one would need to perform numerical simulations and use specialized algorithms, which is beyond the scope of this platform. However, there are numerous scientific papers and software tools available that can help you perform these calculations."
