    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety V(f), we need to compute the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are zero.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 6xy + 3y^2\n∂f/∂y = -3x^2 + 6xy - 3y^2\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 - 6xy + 3y^2 = 0\n-3x^2 + 6xy - 3y^2 = 0\n\nWe can simplify the first equation by dividing by 3:\n\nx^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 0\n\nNow, let's add the first equation to the second equation:\n\nx^2 - 2xy + y^2 - 3x^2 + 6xy - 3y^2 = 0\n-2x^2 + 4xy - 2y^2 = 0\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing by -2:\n\nx^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 0\n\nNotice that this equation is the same as the first equation. So, we only need to solve one equation:\n\nx^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 0\n\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n\n(x - y)^2 = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied if and only if x = y. So, the algebraic variety V(f) consists of points (x, x) for all x in the field.\n\nNow, let's show that the origin (0, 0) is a singular point. We can see that the partial derivatives at the origin are:\n\n∂f/∂x(0, 0) = 3(0)^2 - 6(0)(0) + 3(0)^2 = 0\n∂f/∂y(0, 0) = -3(0)^2 + 6(0)(0) - 3(0)^2 = 0\n\nSince both partial derivatives are zero at the origin, the origin is a singular point of the algebraic variety V(f)."
