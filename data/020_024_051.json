    "message_1": "An ice cream truck operator is trying to maximize their profits by determining the optimal price to sell their ice cream cones. The fixed cost of operating the truck is $50 per day, and the variable cost of producing one ice cream cone is $1. The demand for ice cream cones can be modeled by the following relationship: \n\nQ = 50 - 2P \n\nwhere Q is the quantity demanded (in hundreds of cones) and P is the price per cone (in dollars). \n\nWhat is the optimal price that the operator should sell their ice cream cones at to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price to maximize profit, we first need to find the revenue function and the cost function. Then, we can find the profit function by subtracting the cost function from the revenue function. Finally, we can find the optimal price by taking the derivative of the profit function and setting it equal to zero.\n\n1. Revenue function: R(P) = P * Q(P) = P * (50 - 2P)\n\n2. Cost function: C(Q) = Fixed cost + Variable cost * Q = 50 + 1 * Q(P) = 50 + 1 * (50 - 2P)\n\n3. Profit function: π(P) = R(P) - C(Q) = P * (50 - 2P) - (50 + 1 * (50 - 2P))\n\n4. Simplify the profit function: π(P) = 50P - 2P^2 - 50 - 50 + 2P = -2P^2 + 52P - 50\n\n5. Take the derivative of the profit function with respect to P: dπ(P)/dP = -4P + 52\n\n6. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for P: -4P + 52 = 0 => P = 13\n\nThe optimal price that the operator should sell their ice cream cones at to maximize their profit is $13 per cone."
