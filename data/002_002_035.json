    "message_2": "The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere V is the volume, π is a constant (approximately 3.14159), and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 5 cm, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (5^3)\nV = (4/3) * 3.14159 * 125\nV = 1.33333 * 3.14159 * 125\nV ≈ 523.59878 cubic cm\n\nThe volume of the sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 523.6 cubic cm."
