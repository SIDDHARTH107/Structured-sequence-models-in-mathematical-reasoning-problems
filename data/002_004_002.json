    "message_2": "The perimeter of a rectangle can be found using the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nGiven the length (L) is 8 cm and the width (W) is 5 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = 2(8) + 2(5)\nP = 16 + 10\nP = 26 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 26 cm."
