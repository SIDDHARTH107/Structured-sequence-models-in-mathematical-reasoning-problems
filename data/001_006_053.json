    "message_2": "To find the vertex, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex: x = -b / 2a, where a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic equation y = ax^2 + bx + c. In this case, a = 2 and b = -4.\n\nx = -(-4) / (2 * 2) = 4 / 4 = 1\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging the x-value back into the equation:\n\ny = 2(1)^2 - 4(1) + 3 = 2 - 4 + 3 = 1\n\nSo, the vertex is at the point (1, 1).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is x = 1.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we can set x = 0 in the equation and solve for y:\n\ny = 2(0)^2 - 4(0) + 3 = 0 - 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo, the y-intercept is at the point (0, 3).\n\nNow, we can graph the equation and label the vertex, axis of symmetry, and y-intercept:\n\n1. Plot the vertex (1, 1) on the graph.\n2. Draw the axis of symmetry, which is a vertical line at x = 1.\n3. Plot the y-intercept (0, 3) on the graph.\n4. Since the parabola opens upwards (a > 0), plot a few more points on either side of the vertex to get the shape of the parabola.\n5. Connect the points with a smooth curve to complete the graph of the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 - 4x + 3.\n\nThe graph should show a parabola with the vertex at (1, 1), the axis of symmetry at x = 1, and the y-intercept at (0, 3)."
