    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but non-monotonic logic is not usually associated with numerical problems. It is a type of logic that deals with uncertainty and exceptions to rules. Writing a numerical problem for a non-monotonic logic topic may not be appropriate. Could you please provide more information on what specifically you are looking for?",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are looking for a problem related to non-monotonic logic. Since non-monotonic logic is not associated with numerical problems, let's consider a simple example using the concept of non-monotonic logic:\n\nSuppose we have a set of birds and a rule that states:\n\n1. By default, all birds can fly.\n\nNow, let's introduce an exception to this rule:\n\n2. Penguins are birds that cannot fly.\n\nIn this case, non-monotonic logic allows us to reason about the flying ability of birds, taking into account the exception for penguins. If we encounter a new bird species, we can assume it can fly unless we learn otherwise.\n\nPlease let me know if you need more clarification or if you have any other questions related to non-monotonic logic or other topics."
