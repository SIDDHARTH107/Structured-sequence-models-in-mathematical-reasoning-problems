    "message_2": "To find the contact structure induced on $K$, we first need to find the intersection of the plane $z=0$ with the surface $\\{x^2+y^2+z^2=1\\}$. Since $z=0$, we have $x^2+y^2=1$. This is the equation of a circle of radius 1 in the $xy$-plane. So, the knot $K$ is a circle of radius 1 in the $xy$-plane.\n\nNow, let's restrict the contact form $\\alpha = dz + y dx$ to the knot $K$. Since $z=0$ on $K$, we have $\\alpha|_K = y dx$. We can parameterize the knot $K$ by the angle $\\theta$ as follows:\n\n$x(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)$,\n$y(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta)$.\n\nNow, we can express the contact form $\\alpha|_K$ in terms of $\\theta$:\n\n$\\alpha|_K = \\sin(\\theta) d(\\cos(\\theta)) = -\\sin(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta = -\\sin^2(\\theta) d\\theta$.\n\nLet's denote this 1-form by $\\beta = -\\sin^2(\\theta) d\\theta$. Now, we need to check if $\\beta \\wedge (d\\beta)^2 \\neq 0$. We have:\n\n$d\\beta = -2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) d\\theta$.\n\nNow, let's compute the wedge product:\n\n$\\beta \\wedge (d\\beta)^2 = (-\\sin^2(\\theta) d\\theta) \\wedge (-2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) d\\theta)^2$.\n\nSince $d\\theta \\wedge d\\theta = 0$, we have:\n\n$\\beta \\wedge (d\\beta)^2 = 0$.\n\nThis means that the 1-form $\\beta$ does not induce a contact structure on $K$. However, we can modify $\\beta$ to obtain a contact structure on $K$. Let's consider the 1-form:\n\n$\\beta' = \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta$.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$d\\beta' = \\cos(\\theta) d\\theta$.\n\nAnd the wedge product is:\n\n$\\beta' \\wedge (d\\beta')^2 = (\\sin(\\theta) d\\theta) \\wedge (\\cos(\\theta) d\\theta)^2 = \\sin(\\theta)\\cos^2(\\theta) (d\\theta \\wedge d\\theta) = 0$.\n\nAgain, this 1-form does not induce a contact structure on $K$. However, we can consider the following 1-form:\n\n$\\beta'' = \\sin^2(\\theta) d\\theta + \\cos^2(\\theta) d\\theta = d\\theta$.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$d\\beta'' = 0$.\n\nAnd the wedge product is:\n\n$\\beta'' \\wedge (d\\beta'')^2 = (d\\theta) \\wedge 0 = 0$.\n\nThis 1-form also does not induce a contact structure on $K$. It seems that the contact form $\\alpha = dz + y dx$ does not induce a contact structure on the knot $K$."
