    "message_1": "Using data mining techniques, a math student has collected the following set of values representing the number of hours students in a class studied for their final exam: 4, 6, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 1, 4, and 8. What is the mean and median study hours of the students in this class?",
    "message_2": "To find the mean (average) study hours, we need to add up all the values and then divide by the total number of values.\n\nMean = (4 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 1 + 4 + 8) / 10\nMean = (46) / 10\nMean = 4.6 hours\n\nTo find the median (middle value), we need to first arrange the values in ascending order and then find the middle value. If there are an even number of values, we take the average of the two middle values.\n\nSorted values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8\n\nSince there are 10 values (an even number), we need to find the average of the two middle values (4 and 5).\n\nMedian = (4 + 5) / 2\nMedian = 9 / 2\nMedian = 4.5 hours\n\nSo, the mean study hours is 4.6 hours, and the median study hours is 4.5 hours."
