    "message_2": "To solve this homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 2 -1  3 | 0 ]\n[-3  7 -2 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -5  5 | 0 ]\n[-3  7 -2 | 0 ]\n```\n\n2. Add 3 times the first row to the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -5  5 | 0 ]\n[ 0 13 -5 | 0 ]\n```\n\n3. Multiply the second row by -1/5:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0 13 -5 | 0 ]\n```\n\n4. Subtract 13 times the second row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  8 | 0 ]\n```\n\n5. Divide the third row by 8:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we can read the solutions directly from the row-echelon form:\n\nz = 0\ny - z = y = 0\nx + 2y - z = x = 0\n\nSo, the solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
