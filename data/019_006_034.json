    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but deontic logic is not really focused on numerical problems in the conventional sense. It is a branch of logic concerned with obligations, permissions, and related concepts. Instead, I can provide you with a question based on deontic logic for a math student to solve that involves interpreting statements and analyzing their logical relationships. Here's an example:\n\nSuppose Person A says \"I am obligated to attend the lecture if I want to pass the exam,\" while Person B says \"I am prohibited from attending the lecture unless I have completed the homework.\" Can both statements be true simultaneously? If not, how do you resolve the conflict between them?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the statements using deontic logic.\n\nStatement A: \"I am obligated to attend the lecture if I want to pass the exam.\"\nWe can represent this as: P → O(L), where P represents the desire to pass the exam, O(L) represents the obligation to attend the lecture, and → denotes implication.\n\nStatement B: \"I am prohibited from attending the lecture unless I have completed the homework.\"\nWe can represent this as: ¬H → P(¬L), where H represents completing the homework, P(¬L) represents the prohibition of attending the lecture, and ¬ denotes negation.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of both statements being true simultaneously.\n\n1. If a person wants to pass the exam (P is true), then according to Statement A, they are obligated to attend the lecture (O(L) is true).\n\n2. If a person has not completed the homework (¬H is true), then according to Statement B, they are prohibited from attending the lecture (P(¬L) is true).\n\nThe conflict arises when a person wants to pass the exam (P is true) and has not completed the homework (¬H is true). In this case, they are both obligated to attend the lecture (O(L) is true) and prohibited from attending the lecture (P(¬L) is true) simultaneously, which is a contradiction.\n\nTo resolve this conflict, a person must complete the homework (H is true) before attending the lecture. This way, they are no longer prohibited from attending the lecture (P(¬L) is false), and they can fulfill their obligation to attend the lecture (O(L) is true) in order to pass the exam (P is true)."
