    "message_1": "Consider the nonlinear differential equation: \n\ndy/dt = 3y - 8y^2\n\nwith the initial condition y(0) = 0.5. \n\nDetermine the critical points of the system and classify them as stable, unstable, or semi-stable. Also, sketch the phase portrait of the system.",
    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the system, we need to find the values of y for which dy/dt = 0. So, we set the right-hand side of the equation to zero:\n\n0 = 3y - 8y^2\n\nNow, we can factor out a y:\n\n0 = y(3 - 8y)\n\nThis gives us two critical points:\n\ny1 = 0\ny2 = 3/8\n\nTo classify these critical points as stable, unstable, or semi-stable, we need to analyze the behavior of the system around these points. We can do this by looking at the sign of dy/dt for values of y near the critical points.\n\nFor y1 = 0:\nIf y > 0, then dy/dt = 3y - 8y^2 > 0, which means the system moves away from the critical point.\nIf y < 0, then dy/dt = 3y - 8y^2 < 0, which means the system moves towards the critical point.\n\nThus, the critical point y1 = 0 is unstable.\n\nFor y2 = 3/8:\nIf y > 3/8, then dy/dt = 3y - 8y^2 < 0, which means the system moves towards the critical point.\nIf y < 3/8, then dy/dt = 3y - 8y^2 > 0, which means the system moves away from the critical point.\n\nThus, the critical point y2 = 3/8 is semi-stable.\n\nNow, let's sketch the phase portrait of the system. The phase portrait is a plot of the system's behavior over time, with the horizontal axis representing time (t) and the vertical axis representing the state variable (y).\n\n1. Draw a horizontal line at y = 0, representing the unstable critical point.\n2. Draw a horizontal line at y = 3/8, representing the semi-stable critical point.\n3. For y < 0, draw arrows pointing downwards, indicating that the system moves towards y = 0.\n4. For 0 < y < 3/8, draw arrows pointing upwards, indicating that the system moves away from y = 0 and towards y = 3/8.\n5. For y > 3/8, draw arrows pointing downwards, indicating that the system moves towards y = 3/8.\n\nThe phase portrait should show an unstable critical point at y = 0, with the system moving away from it for positive values of y, and a semi-stable critical point at y = 3/8, with the system moving towards it for y > 3/8 and away from it for y < 3/8."
