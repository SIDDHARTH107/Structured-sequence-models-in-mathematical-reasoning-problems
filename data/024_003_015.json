    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2), we need to compute the first and second fundamental forms and then use the formula for Gaussian curvature:\n\nK = (L*M - N^2) / (E*G - F^2)\n\nFirst, we find the partial derivatives of the surface equation with respect to x and y:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = 2y\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), these partial derivatives are:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2\n∂z/∂y = 2\n\nNow, we find the normal vector N to the surface at the point (1, 1, 2) by taking the gradient of the surface equation:\n\nN = (-∂z/∂x, -∂z/∂y, 1) = (-2, -2, 1)\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives of the surface equation:\n\n∂²z/∂x² = 2\n∂²z/∂y² = 2\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms:\n\nE = <∂r/∂x, ∂r/∂x> = <(1, 0, 2x), (1, 0, 2x)> = 1 + 4x^2\nF = <∂r/∂x, ∂r/∂y> = <(1, 0, 2x), (0, 1, 2y)> = 4xy\nG = <∂r/∂y, ∂r/∂y> = <(0, 1, 2y), (0, 1, 2y)> = 1 + 4y^2\n\nL = <N, ∂²r/∂x²> = <-2, -2, 1> • <2, 0, 0> = -4\nM = <N, ∂²r/∂x∂y> = <-2, -2, 1> • <0, 0, 0> = 0\nN = <N, ∂²r/∂y²> = <-2, -2, 1> • <0, 2, 0> = -4\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), the coefficients are:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (L*M - N^2) / (E*G - F^2) = (-4*0 - (-4)^2) / (5*5 - 4^2) = (-16) / (25 - 16) = -16 / 9\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature at the point (1, 1, 2) is K = -16/9."
