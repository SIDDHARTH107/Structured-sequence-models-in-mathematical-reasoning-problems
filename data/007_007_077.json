    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n3x + 5y = 31\n\nNow, we need to find integer solutions for x and y. We can start by expressing the equation in terms of one variable:\n\nx = (31 - 5y) / 3\n\nWe can now try different integer values for y and see if we get an integer value for x:\n\n1. If y = 1, x = (31 - 5) / 3 = 26 / 3 (not an integer)\n2. If y = 2, x = (31 - 10) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7 (integer)\n\nSo, one solution is x = 7 and y = 2.\n\nTo find other solutions, we can use the general solution for Diophantine equations of the form ax + by = c:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the particular solutions we found (x0 = 7, y0 = 2), a = 3, b = 5, d = gcd(a, b) = 1, and n is an integer.\n\nx = 7 + 5n\ny = 2 - 3n\n\nBy plugging in different integer values for n, we can find other solutions:\n\n1. If n = 1, x = 7 + 5 = 12, y = 2 - 3 = -1\n2. If n = -1, x = 7 - 5 = 2, y = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nSo, the integer solutions for the Diophantine equation 6x + 10y = 62 are:\n\n(x, y) = (7, 2), (12, -1), (2, 5), and any other solutions generated by the general formula with different integer values for n."
