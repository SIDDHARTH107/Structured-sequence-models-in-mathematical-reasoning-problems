    "message_2": "A 4-dimensional simplex, also known as a 4-simplex or a pentachoron, is a geometric object that has 5 vertices, 10 edges, 10 triangular faces, and 5 tetrahedral faces. In order to determine how many 4-dimensional simplices $K$ contains, we need to find the number of distinct sets of 5 vertices that can form a 4-simplex.\n\nSince $K$ has 7 vertices, there are $\\binom{7}{5} = 21$ possible sets of 5 vertices. However, not all of these sets will necessarily form a 4-simplex. We need to check if each set of 5 vertices has the required number of edges, triangular faces, and tetrahedral faces.\n\nA 4-simplex has 10 edges, so for each set of 5 vertices, we need to make sure that there are 10 edges connecting them. Since $K$ has 10 edges in total, this means that all 10 edges must be present in the set of 5 vertices. However, this is not possible, as each vertex in $K$ can have at most 6 edges connecting it to the other 6 vertices, and we would need at least two vertices to have 7 edges each to form a 4-simplex.\n\nTherefore, there are no 4-dimensional simplices in the simplicial complex $K$."
