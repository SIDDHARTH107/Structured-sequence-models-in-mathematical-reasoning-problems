    "message_1": "One classical problem in proof theory involves proving the following statement: if a set of natural numbers has no smallest element, then it is infinite. \n\nFormally, let S be a set of natural numbers. Prove that if S does not have a smallest element, then there exists a one-to-one function from the set of natural numbers to S. \n\nHint: you can construct such function by recursion.",
    "message_2": "To prove this statement, we will construct a one-to-one function f: ℕ → S using recursion. Since S has no smallest element, for every natural number n, there must be an element in S that is strictly greater than n. We will use this property to define our function f.\n\nLet's define the function f as follows:\n\n1. Base case: f(0) = s_0, where s_0 is an arbitrary element of S. Since S is non-empty (it has no smallest element), we can choose such an element.\n\n2. Recursive step: For any n ∈ ℕ, let f(n) = s_n, where s_n is an element of S such that s_n > f(n-1) and s_n ≠ f(k) for any k < n. Since S has no smallest element, there will always be an element in S that is strictly greater than f(n-1), and we can choose one that has not been assigned to any previous natural number.\n\nNow, we will show that f is one-to-one (injective):\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exist natural numbers m and n such that m ≠ n and f(m) = f(n). Without loss of generality, assume that m > n. Then, by the definition of f, f(m) > f(m-1) > ... > f(n). But this contradicts the assumption that f(m) = f(n). Therefore, f must be injective.\n\nSince we have constructed an injective function from ℕ to S, we have shown that S is infinite."
