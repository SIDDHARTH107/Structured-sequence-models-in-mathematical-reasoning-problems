    "message_2": "The Euler's totient function, denoted as ϕ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nIn the case of ϕ(11), since 11 is a prime number, all the positive integers less than 11 are relatively prime to 11. Therefore, the value of ϕ(11) is equal to the number of positive integers less than 11, which is 10.\n\nSo, ϕ(11) = 10."
