    "message_2": "To find the secret key in a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = α^x mod p, where α is the primitive root, x is Alice's secret integer, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = α^y mod p, where y is Bob's secret integer.\n3. Alice computes the secret key as K_A = B^x mod p.\n4. Bob computes the secret key as K_B = A^y mod p.\n\nIf the protocol is secure, K_A and K_B should be equal, and this shared value is the secret key.\n\nLet's compute the secret key:\n\n1. A = 2^3 mod 11 = 8 mod 11 = 8\n2. B = 2^4 mod 11 = 16 mod 11 = 5\n3. K_A = 5^3 mod 11 = 125 mod 11 = 4\n4. K_B = 8^4 mod 11 = 4096 mod 11 = 4\n\nSince K_A and K_B are equal, the secret key that Alice and Bob will use to encrypt their communications is 4."
