    "message_2": "To find the second-order mixed partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x\\partial y}$, we first need to find the first-order partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$.\n\nThe first-order partial derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^3 + 3x^2y + y^3) = 3x^2 + 6xy$$\n\nNow, we find the second-order mixed partial derivative by taking the derivative of $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$ with respect to $y$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(3x^2 + 6xy) = 6x$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate the mixed partial derivative at the point $(1,2)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x\\partial y}(1,2) = 6(1) = 6$$\n\nSo, the value of the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x\\partial y}$ at the point $(1,2)$ is $6$."
