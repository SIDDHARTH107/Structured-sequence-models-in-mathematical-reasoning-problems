    "message_2": "Let the length of the garden be L meters and the width be W meters. The area of the garden is given by:\n\nArea = L * W = 120 square meters\n\nWe need to minimize the length of the fence, which is the perimeter of the garden on three sides (one length and two widths). So, the length of the fence is given by:\n\nFence length = L + 2W\n\nTo minimize the fence length, we can use calculus. First, we need to express either L or W in terms of the other variable using the area equation. Let's express W in terms of L:\n\nW = 120 / L\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W in the fence length equation:\n\nFence length = L + 2(120 / L)\n\nNow, we'll find the derivative of the fence length with respect to L:\n\nd(Fence length) / dL = 1 - (240 / L^2)\n\nTo find the minimum length, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for L:\n\n0 = 1 - (240 / L^2)\n\n240 / L^2 = 1\n\nL^2 = 240\n\nL = sqrt(240) = 2 * sqrt(60)\n\nNow, we can find the width W using the expression we found earlier:\n\nW = 120 / L = 120 / (2 * sqrt(60)) = sqrt(60)\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden that minimize the fence length are L = 2 * sqrt(60) meters and W = sqrt(60) meters. Now, we can find the minimum fence length:\n\nMinimum fence length = L + 2W = 2 * sqrt(60) + 2 * sqrt(60) = 4 * sqrt(60) â‰ˆ 29.53 meters\n\nTherefore, the minimum length of the fence required to enclose the garden is approximately 29.53 meters."
