    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic equation, we can use the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation first. \n\nProperty: log_a(b) + log_a(c) = log_a(bc)\n\nApplying this property to the given equation:\n\nlog(base 3)(x + 2) + log(base 3)(x - 1) = log(base 3)((x + 2)(x - 1))\n\nNow, since the bases are the same, we can equate the arguments:\n\n(x + 2)(x - 1) = 3^2\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation:\n\nx^2 - x + 2x - 2 = 9\n\nCombining like terms:\n\nx^2 + x - 2 = 9\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\nx^2 + x - 11 = 0\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula to find the values of x. In this case, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -11. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nx = (-1 ± √(1^2 - 4(1)(-11))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-1 ± √(1 + 44)) / 2\n\nx = (-1 ± √45) / 2\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = (-1 + √45) / 2 and x = (-1 - √45) / 2"
