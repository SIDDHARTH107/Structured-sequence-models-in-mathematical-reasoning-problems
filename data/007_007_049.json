    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 3x + 5y = 64, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the general solution.\n\nFirst, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3 and 5 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n5 = 1 * 3 + 2\n3 = 1 * 2 + 1\n2 = 2 * 1\n\nSo, the GCD(3, 5) = 1.\n\nNow, we use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers x and y such that:\n\n3x + 5y = GCD(3, 5) = 1\n\nWorking backwards from the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1 = 3 - 1 * 2\n1 = 3 - 1 * (5 - 1 * 3)\n1 = 3 - 1 * 5 + 1 * 3\n1 = 2 * 3 - 1 * 5\n\nSo, we have a particular solution x = 2 and y = -1.\n\nNow, we can find the general solution for the Diophantine equation 3x + 5y = 64:\n\n3x + 5y = 3(2) + 5(-1) + 64\n3x + 5y = 3(2 + 5t) + 5(-1 - 3t)\n\nSo, the general solution is x = 2 + 5t and y = -1 - 3t, where t is an integer.\n\nFor example, when t = 0, we have x = 2 and y = -1, which gives 3x + 5y = 64. When t = 1, we have x = 7 and y = -4, which also gives 3x + 5y = 64. You can find more solutions by plugging in different values of t."
