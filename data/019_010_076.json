    "message_2": "In linear logic, we cannot infer the proposition \"It's cloudy today\" based solely on the given propositions \"It's sunny today\" and \"It's not raining today.\" \n\nThe reason is that the given propositions do not provide any information about cloudiness. They only tell us about the presence of sun and the absence of rain. It is possible for it to be sunny and not raining, while also being cloudy (e.g., partly cloudy). Similarly, it is possible for it to be sunny and not raining, while not being cloudy at all (e.g., clear sky).\n\nSince the given propositions do not provide any direct information about cloudiness, we cannot logically infer the proposition \"It's cloudy today\" using linear logic."
