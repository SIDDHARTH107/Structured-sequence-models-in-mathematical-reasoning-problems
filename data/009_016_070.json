    "message_2": "To determine the potential function inside a circular capacitor, we can use the method of conformal mapping. Conformal mapping is a technique used to transform a given geometry into a simpler one, solve the problem in the simpler geometry, and then transform the solution back to the original geometry.\n\nIn this case, we can use the conformal mapping technique to transform the circular capacitor into a parallel plate capacitor. Let's denote the potential function as V(r), where r is the radial distance from the center of the circular capacitor.\n\nFirst, we need to find the conformal mapping function. For a circular capacitor with radius R and spacing d between the plates, the conformal mapping function is given by:\n\nf(z) = R * (1 + d/R) * z / (1 + z)\n\nIn our case, R = 4 cm and d = 2 cm. Plugging these values into the conformal mapping function, we get:\n\nf(z) = 4 * (1 + 2/4) * z / (1 + z) = 6z / (1 + z)\n\nNow, we can solve the problem in the simpler geometry of a parallel plate capacitor. The potential function for a parallel plate capacitor with plate separation d and potential difference V0 is given by:\n\nV(x) = V0 * x / d\n\nIn our case, V0 = 50 V - 10 V = 40 V, and d = 2 cm. Plugging these values into the potential function for a parallel plate capacitor, we get:\n\nV(x) = 40 * x / 2 = 20x\n\nNow, we need to transform this potential function back to the original geometry of the circular capacitor. To do this, we need to find the inverse of the conformal mapping function:\n\nf^(-1)(w) = w / (1 - (d/R) * w)\n\nIn our case, f^(-1)(w) = w / (1 - (2/4) * w) = w / (1 - w/2)\n\nNow, we can find the potential function V(r) by substituting f^(-1)(w) into V(x):\n\nV(r) = 20 * f^(-1)(r)\n\nV(r) = 20 * r / (1 - r/2)\n\nThis is the potential function inside the circular capacitor. Note that this function is valid for r < R, i.e., inside the circular capacitor."
