    "message_2": "First, let's find the image of the morphism $f(x,y,z) = (x^2+y^2, xy+yz, yz-z^2)$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. We can rewrite the morphism as:\n\n$$f(x,y,z) = (x^2+y^2: xy+yz: yz-z^2)$$\n\nNow, let's find the Zariski closure of the image of this morphism. The Zariski closure is the set of all points in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ that can be approximated arbitrarily well by points in the image of the morphism. Since the morphism is already defined in the projective space, the Zariski closure is simply the image of the morphism itself.\n\nNow, let's compute the cohomology groups $H^0$ and $H^1$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The cohomology groups of a projective variety are related to the sheaf cohomology groups of the structure sheaf of the variety. In particular, we have:\n\n$$H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = \\Gamma(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$$\n$$H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$$\n\nwhere $X$ is the projective variety defined by the Zariski closure of the image of the morphism, and $\\Gamma(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$ is the global sections of the structure sheaf of $X$.\n\nFor a projective variety in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, the global sections of the structure sheaf are simply the constant functions. Therefore, the dimension of $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$ is 1.\n\nNow, let's compute the dimension of $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$. By Serre duality, we have:\n\n$$H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\cong H^0(X, \\omega_X)$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_X$ is the canonical sheaf of $X$. Since $X$ is a projective variety in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, the canonical sheaf is given by:\n\n$$\\omega_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(-3)$$\n\nThe global sections of this sheaf are the homogeneous polynomials of degree -3, which are trivial. Therefore, the dimension of $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$ is 0.\n\nIn conclusion, the dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^0$ and $H^1$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}$ are 1 and 0, respectively."
