    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a closed loop on a graph where every node (vertex) is visited exactly once.\n\nIn the given graph, there is no Hamiltonian cycle. Here's why:\n\nIf we start at the central vertex (let's call it A), we have four edges to choose from. Let's say we choose the edge connecting A to the top-left vertex (B). From B, we have two options: either go to the top-right vertex (C) or the bottom-left vertex (D).\n\n1. If we go from B to C, we can then go to the bottom-right vertex (E). However, we are now stuck at E, as the only remaining edge connects E back to C, which we have already visited. This path does not form a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\n2. If we go from B to D, we can then go to the bottom-right vertex (E). However, we are now stuck at E, as the only remaining edge connects E back to D, which we have already visited. This path does not form a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nSince we have exhausted all possible paths starting from vertex A, we can conclude that there is no Hamiltonian cycle in this graph."
