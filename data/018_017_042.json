Using the symmetric difference operation (∆), calculate:\n\n(A × B) ∆ B\n\nthen calculate:\n\nA ∆ (B × B)\n\nShow that the two results are different and hence prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference.",
    "message_2": "First, let's define the Cartesian product and symmetric difference operations.\n\nThe Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∈ A and b ∈ B. \n\nThe symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∆ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection, i.e., (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nNow, let's calculate (A × B) ∆ B:\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nSince B = {2, 3, 4}, none of its elements are ordered pairs, so B ∩ (A × B) = ∅.\n\nTherefore, (A × B) ∆ B = (A × B) ∪ B - ∅ = (A × B) ∪ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), 2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's calculate A ∆ (B × B):\n\nB × B = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nSince A = {1, 2, 3}, none of its elements are ordered pairs, so A ∩ (B × B) = ∅.\n\nTherefore, A ∆ (B × B) = A ∪ (B × B) - ∅ = A ∪ (B × B) = {1, 2, 3, (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nComparing the two results:\n\n(A × B) ∆ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), 2, 3, 4}\n\nA ∆ (B × B) = {1, 2, 3, (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nThese two sets are different, as (A × B) ∆ B contains the elements 2, 3, and 4, while A ∆ (B × B) contains the element 1. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
