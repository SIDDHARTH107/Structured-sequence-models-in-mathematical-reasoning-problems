    "message_2": "To determine if the set $S$ is compact in the metric space $\\mathbb{R}$, we need to check if every open cover of $S$ has a finite subcover. Recall that a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.\n\nFirst, let's check if $S$ is bounded. Since all elements of $S$ are either $-1$ or positive fractions less than or equal to $1$, we can see that $S$ is bounded by $-1$ and $1$. Thus, $S$ is bounded.\n\nNow, let's check if $S$ is closed. A set is closed if it contains all its limit points. We can see that $0$ is a limit point of $S$, as the sequence $\\left\\{\\frac{1}{n}\\right\\}$ converges to $0$. However, $0$ is not an element of $S$. Therefore, $S$ is not closed.\n\nSince $S$ is not closed, it cannot be compact. Thus, $S$ is not compact in $\\mathbb{R}$."
