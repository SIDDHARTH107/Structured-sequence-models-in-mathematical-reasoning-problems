    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G, we can use the concept of graph coloring and the degree of vertices.\n\nThe degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it. In any graph, the maximum degree of a vertex is denoted by Δ(G). According to the greedy coloring algorithm, any graph can be colored with Δ(G) + 1 colors or fewer.\n\nFirst, we need to find the maximum degree Δ(G) in the graph G. Since G has 8 vertices and 12 edges, the average degree of a vertex is (2 * 12) / 8 = 3. Therefore, Δ(G) must be greater than or equal to 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario, where Δ(G) = 4. In this case, there would be a vertex with 4 edges incident to it. Since the graph has 12 edges, there must be at least one more vertex with a degree of 4, otherwise, the total number of edges would be less than 12.\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, Δ(G) = 4. According to the greedy coloring algorithm, G can be colored with Δ(G) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 colors or fewer. However, this is an upper bound, and we need to find the minimum number of colors.\n\nLet's try to color the graph with 4 colors. Since there are vertices with a degree of 4, it is possible that all their neighbors have different colors. In this case, we would need a 5th color for the central vertex. However, since the graph has only 8 vertices, there must be at least one pair of adjacent vertices with the same color. Therefore, it is possible to color the graph with 4 colors.\n\nHence, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is 4."
