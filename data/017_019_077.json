    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we will use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The order of a group G is 36, which can be factored as 2^2 * 3^2. Thus, we need to find the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, denoted by n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, which must be isomorphic to either Z_4 or Z_2 × Z_2. If n_2 = 9, then all Sylow 2-subgroups are isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_2.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, denoted by n_3, must divide 2^2 = 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9, which must be isomorphic to either Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3. If n_3 = 4, then all Sylow 3-subgroups are isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3.\n\nNow, we can list the possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 36 based on the Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup isomorphic to Z_4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup isomorphic to Z_9, then G is isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_9, which is isomorphic to Z_36.\n\n2. If G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup isomorphic to Z_4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3, then G is isomorphic to Z_4 × (Z_3 × Z_3), which is isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_3.\n\n3. If G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_2 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup isomorphic to Z_9, then G is isomorphic to (Z_2 × Z_2) × Z_9, which is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_9.\n\n4. If G has 9 Sylow 2-subgroups isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_2 and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3, then G is a semi-direct product of Z_2 × Z_2 and Z_3 × Z_3. There are two non-isomorphic semi-direct products in this case, which we denote by (Z_2 × Z_2) ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_3)_1 and (Z_2 × Z_2) ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_3)_2.\n\nIn total, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 36:\n\n1. Z_36\n2. Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_3\n3. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_9\n4. (Z_2 × Z_2) ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_3)_1\n5. (Z_2 × Z_2) ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_3)_2"
