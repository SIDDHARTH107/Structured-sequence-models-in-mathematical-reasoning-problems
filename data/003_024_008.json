    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector u onto vector v, we can use the formula:\n\nprojection of u onto v = (u • v) / ||v||\n\nwhere u • v is the dot product of the two vectors, and ||v|| is the magnitude of vector v.\n\nFirst, let's find the components of vectors u and v:\n\nu_x = ||u|| * cos(60°) = 5 * (1/2) = 2.5\nu_y = ||u|| * sin(60°) = 5 * (√3/2) = 5√3/2\n\nv_x = ||v|| * cos(30°) = 8 * (√3/2) = 4√3\nv_y = ||v|| * sin(30°) = 8 * (1/2) = 4\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of u and v:\n\nu • v = u_x * v_x + u_y * v_y = 2.5 * 4√3 + (5√3/2) * 4 = 10√3 + 10√3 = 20√3\n\nNow, we can find the projection of u onto v:\n\nprojection of u onto v = (u • v) / ||v|| = (20√3) / 8 = 5√3/2\n\nSo, the projection of vector u onto vector v is 5√3/2 units."
