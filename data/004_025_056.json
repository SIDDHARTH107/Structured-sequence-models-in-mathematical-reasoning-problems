    "message_1": "A car is traveling along a straight road with a velocity of 20 m/s. Suddenly, the driver sees an obstacle ahead and applies the brakes, bringing the car to a stop in 5 seconds. Find the acceleration of the car and the distance it travelled before coming to a stop.",
    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the car, we can use the formula:\n\na = (v_f - v_i) / t\n\nwhere a is the acceleration, v_f is the final velocity, v_i is the initial velocity, and t is the time taken.\n\nIn this case, the final velocity (v_f) is 0 m/s (since the car comes to a stop), the initial velocity (v_i) is 20 m/s, and the time (t) is 5 seconds. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\na = (0 - 20) / 5\na = -20 / 5\na = -4 m/s²\n\nThe acceleration of the car is -4 m/s² (negative because it's decelerating).\n\nNow, to find the distance the car traveled before coming to a stop, we can use the formula:\n\nd = v_i * t + 0.5 * a * t²\n\nwhere d is the distance, v_i is the initial velocity, t is the time, and a is the acceleration.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nd = 20 * 5 + 0.5 * (-4) * 5²\nd = 100 - 0.5 * 4 * 25\nd = 100 - 50\nd = 50 meters\n\nThe car traveled a distance of 50 meters before coming to a stop."
