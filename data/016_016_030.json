    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a space-filling curve that is constructed through a series of iterations. The perimeter of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nFor the Gosper curve, the perimeter at each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (side length) × (number of segments)\n\nThe number of segments in the curve increases by a factor of 7 with each iteration. So, for the nth iteration, the number of segments is 7^n.\n\nThe side length of the curve decreases by a factor of √(2 + √2) with each iteration. So, for the nth iteration, the side length is (1/√(2 + √2))^n.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total perimeter of the Gosper curve up to the 5th iteration:\n\n1st iteration:\nPerimeter = 1 × 7^1 = 7\n\n2nd iteration:\nPerimeter = (1/√(2 + √2))^2 × 7^2 = (1/3) × 49 = 49/3\n\n3rd iteration:\nPerimeter = (1/√(2 + √2))^3 × 7^3 = (1/√(2 + √2)) × 343 = 343/√(2 + √2)\n\n4th iteration:\nPerimeter = (1/√(2 + √2))^4 × 7^4 = (1/3^2) × 2401 = 2401/9\n\n5th iteration:\nPerimeter = (1/√(2 + √2))^5 × 7^5 = (1/√(2 + √2))^2 × 16807 = 16807/3\n\nNow, let's sum the perimeters of all 5 iterations:\n\nTotal perimeter = 7 + 49/3 + 343/√(2 + √2) + 2401/9 + 16807/3 ≈ 7 + 16.333 + 242.685 + 266.778 + 5602.333 ≈ 6135.129\n\nSo, the total perimeter of the Gosper curve up to the 5th iteration, assuming the initial side length of the curve is 1 unit, is approximately 6135.129 units."
