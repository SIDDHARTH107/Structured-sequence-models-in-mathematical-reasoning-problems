    "message_2": "Mori theory is a powerful tool in algebraic geometry, but it may not be the most straightforward method to find the number of irreducible components of this curve over the complex numbers. Instead, we can use the fact that a plane curve defined by a polynomial equation is irreducible if and only if the polynomial is irreducible.\n\nLet's consider the given equation:\n\nf(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + x^2\n\nTo find the irreducible components of this curve, we need to determine if the polynomial is irreducible. We can do this by checking if it can be factored into simpler polynomials.\n\nNotice that we can rewrite the equation as:\n\ny^2 = x^3 - x^2\n\nNow, factor out x^2 on the right side:\n\ny^2 = x^2 (x - 1)\n\nThis equation represents the curve as a product of two simpler polynomials, but it does not factor f(x, y) itself. The equation still defines a single curve in the complex plane, and we cannot separate it into two distinct curves.\n\nTherefore, the given curve is irreducible, and it has only one irreducible component over the complex numbers."
