The distances between the cities are given in the following matrix:\n\n|   | A | B | C |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| A | 0 | 5 | 8 |\n| B | 5 | 0 | 6 |\n| C | 8 | 6 | 0 |\n\nThe company wants to minimize the total distance traveled in transporting the packages. They decide to use a hub-and-spoke model, where one central city will serve as the hub, and the other cities will be connected to it. What is the optimal hub city, and what is the minimum distance traveled using this model?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal hub city, we need to calculate the total distance traveled for each city as the hub. \n\nIf city A is the hub:\nTotal distance = (A to B) + (A to C) = 5 + 8 = 13\n\nIf city B is the hub:\nTotal distance = (B to A) + (B to C) = 5 + 6 = 11\n\nIf city C is the hub:\nTotal distance = (C to A) + (C to B) = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nComparing the total distances, we can see that city B as the hub results in the minimum distance traveled, which is 11. Therefore, the optimal hub city is B, and the minimum distance traveled using this model is 11."
