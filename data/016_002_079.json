    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve formed by iteratively replacing each line segment in an equilateral triangle with a smaller equilateral triangle, removing the middle third of the segment and adding two segments of the same length on either side.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the nth iteration as P_n. The perimeter of the original equilateral triangle (n = 0) is P_0 = 3 * 12 = 36 cm.\n\nFor each iteration, the number of segments increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment decreases by a factor of 3. Therefore, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the nth iteration can be calculated as:\n\nP_n = P_0 * (4/3)^n\n\nFor the 5th iteration (n = 5), the perimeter is:\n\nP_5 = 36 * (4/3)^5 = 36 * (1024/243) â‰ˆ 152.104 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the 5th iteration is approximately 152.104 cm."
