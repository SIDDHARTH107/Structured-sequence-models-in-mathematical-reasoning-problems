    "message_1": "A group of 25 students took a quiz. 14 students got an A, 12 students got a B, and 7 students got a C. 3 students got both an A and a B, 2 students got both a B and a C, and 1 student got all three grades. How many students did not get any of the three grades?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.\n\nTotal students with A, B, or C = (students with A) + (students with B) + (students with C) - (students with both A and B) - (students with both B and C) - (students with both A and C) + (students with all three grades)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of students with both A and C. Since 1 student got all three grades, that student is also included in the students with both A and B, and both B and C. So, there is 1 student with both A and C.\n\nNow, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal students with A, B, or C = 14 + 12 + 7 - 3 - 2 - 1 + 1 = 28\n\nSince there are 25 students in total, the number of students who did not get any of the three grades is:\n\n25 - 28 = -3\n\nHowever, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. It seems there is an inconsistency in the given data. Please check the data and try again."
