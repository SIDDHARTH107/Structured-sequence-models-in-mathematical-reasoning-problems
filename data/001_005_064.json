    "message_2": "I will use the quadratic formula to solve the equation. The quadratic formula is given by:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nFor the given equation, 2x^2 - 5x - 3 = 0, we have:\n\na = 2, b = -5, and c = -3\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (5 ± √((-5)² - 4(2)(-3))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (5 ± √(25 + 24)) / 4\n\nx = (5 ± √49) / 4\n\nx = (5 ± 7) / 4\n\nThere are two possible solutions:\n\n1) x = (5 + 7) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3\n2) x = (5 - 7) / 4 = -2 / 4 = -1/2\n\nSo, the solutions to the quadratic equation 2x^2 - 5x - 3 = 0 are x = 3 and x = -1/2."
