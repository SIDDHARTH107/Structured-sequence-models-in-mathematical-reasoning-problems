    "message_2": "To find the frequency response of the circuit, we first need to analyze the circuit in the frequency domain. The circuit is an RC (resistor-capacitor) circuit, which acts as a low-pass filter. The transfer function H(jω) of the circuit can be found using the impedance of the resistor (R) and the capacitor (C).\n\nThe impedance of the resistor is R = 50 ohms, and the impedance of the capacitor is Z_C = 1/(jωC), where ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe transfer function H(jω) of the RC circuit can be found using the voltage divider rule:\n\nH(jω) = V_out(jω) / V_in(jω) = Z_C / (R + Z_C)\n\nH(jω) = 1/(jωC) / (R + 1/(jωC))\n\nNow, let's plug in the values of R and C:\n\nR = 50 ohms\nC = 0.1 * 10^(-6) F\n\nH(jω) = 1/(jω * 0.1 * 10^(-6)) / (50 + 1/(jω * 0.1 * 10^(-6)))\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by jω * 0.1 * 10^(-6):\n\nH(jω) = 1 / (50jω * 0.1 * 10^(-6) + 1)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude response |H(jω)| and phase response ∠H(jω) of the circuit:\n\n|H(jω)| = 1 / sqrt((50ω * 0.1 * 10^(-6))^2 + 1)\n\n∠H(jω) = -atan(50ω * 0.1 * 10^(-6))\n\nThe frequency response of the circuit is given by the magnitude response |H(jω)| and phase response ∠H(jω) as a function of the angular frequency ω."
