    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. We are given that the ladder is 10 ft long. According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n\nNow, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWe are given that dx/dt = 2 ft/s. We want to find dy/dt when x = 6 ft. First, we need to find the value of y when x = 6 ft. We can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n6^2 + y^2 = 10^2\n36 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 64\ny = 8 ft\n\nNow, we can plug in the values of x, y, and dx/dt into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(6)(2) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0\n24 + 16(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for dy/dt:\n\n16(dy/dt) = -24\ndy/dt = -24/16\ndy/dt = -3/2\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of -3/2 ft/s or -1.5 ft/s when the base of the ladder is 6 ft away from the wall."
