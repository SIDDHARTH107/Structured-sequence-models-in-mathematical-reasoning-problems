    "message_1": "Sure! Here is a linear programming problem for a math student to solve:\n\nAn electronics manufacturing company produces two types of smartphones, Model A and Model B. Each Model A phone requires 3 hours of assembly time, 2 hours of testing time, and $150 in material costs. Each Model B phone requires 2 hours of assembly time, 1 hour of testing time, and $120 in material costs. The company has a maximum of 900 hours of assembly time, 600 hours of testing time, and $90,000 for materials. Model A phones are sold for $500 and Model B phones are sold for $400 each. The company wants to maximize their profit. \n\nWhat is the optimal number of each type of smartphone the company should produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Model A phones and y be the number of Model B phones produced.\n\nObjective function (profit to be maximized): P = 500x + 400y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Assembly time: 3x + 2y ≤ 900\n2. Testing time: 2x + y ≤ 600\n3. Material costs: 150x + 120y ≤ 90,000\n4. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 2y = 900 -> y = (900 - 3x) / 2\n2. 2x + y = 600 -> y = 600 - 2x\n3. 150x + 120y = 90,000 -> y = (90,000 - 150x) / 120\n\nIntersection points of the constraints:\nA. (0, 0) - intersection of x-axis and y-axis\nB. (0, 450) - intersection of constraint 1 and y-axis\nC. (0, 300) - intersection of constraint 2 and y-axis\nD. (200, 0) - intersection of constraint 3 and x-axis\nE. (150, 150) - intersection of constraint 1 and constraint 2\nF. (300, 0) - intersection of constraint 1 and constraint 3\n\nFeasible region: ABEF\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each of the corner points of the feasible region:\n\nA. P(0, 0) = 500(0) + 400(0) = $0\nB. P(0, 450) = 500(0) + 400(450) = $180,000\nC. P(0, 300) = 500(0) + 400(300) = $120,000\nD. P(200, 0) = 500(200) + 400(0) = $100,000\nE. P(150, 150) = 500(150) + 400(150) = $135,000\nF. P(300, 0) = 500(300) + 400(0) = $150,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $180,000, which occurs when the company produces 0 Model A phones and 450 Model B phones."
