    "message_2": "Let's first recall the definition of the residue of a function at a pole. If $f(z)$ has a pole of order $m$ at $z=a$, then the residue of $f(z)$ at $z=a$ is the coefficient of the $\\frac{1}{(z-a)^{m-1}}$ term in the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$ around $z=a$.\n\nSince $f(z)$ has a zero of order 3 at $z=2+3i$ and a pole of order 2 at $z=1-i$, we can write $f(z)$ as:\n\n$$f(z) = (z - (2+3i))^3 g(z)$$\n\nwhere $g(z)$ is an analytic function with a pole of order 2 at $z=1-i$. Now, we can rewrite $g(z)$ as:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{h(z)}{(z - (1-i))^2}$$\n\nwhere $h(z)$ is an analytic function with no zeros or poles on or inside the circle $|z|=5$. Combining the expressions for $f(z)$ and $g(z)$, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{(z - (2+3i))^3 h(z)}{(z - (1-i))^2}$$\n\nNow, we want to find the residue of $f(z)$ at $z=1-i$. To do this, we can find the coefficient of the $\\frac{1}{(z-(1-i))}$ term in the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$ around $z=1-i$. \n\nLet's first expand $(z - (2+3i))^3$ using the binomial theorem:\n\n$$(z - (2+3i))^3 = (z-(1-i) + (1+4i))^3 = (1+4i)^3 + 3(1+4i)^2(z-(1-i)) + 3(1+4i)(z-(1-i))^2 + (z-(1-i))^3$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression into the expression for $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{((1+4i)^3 + 3(1+4i)^2(z-(1-i)) + 3(1+4i)(z-(1-i))^2 + (z-(1-i))^3) h(z)}{(z - (1-i))^2}$$\n\nThe residue of $f(z)$ at $z=1-i$ is the coefficient of the $\\frac{1}{(z-(1-i))}$ term in this expression. We can see that the only term that contributes to this coefficient is the $3(1+4i)^2(z-(1-i)) h(z)$ term. Therefore, the residue of $f(z)$ at $z=1-i$ is:\n\n$$3(1+4i)^2 h(1-i)$$\n\nSince $h(z)$ is analytic at $z=1-i$, we can simply evaluate $h(1-i)$ to find the residue. However, we are not given any information about $h(z)$, so we cannot determine the exact value of the residue. The final answer is:\n\n$$\\text{Residue of } f(z) \\text{ at } z=1-i = 3(1+4i)^2 h(1-i)$$"
