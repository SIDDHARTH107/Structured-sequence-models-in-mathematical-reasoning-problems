    "message_1": "A box contains 10 red balls, 8 blue balls, and 12 green balls. If one ball is selected at random from the box, what is the probability that it is blue?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selecting a blue ball, we need to divide the number of blue balls by the total number of balls in the box.\n\nTotal number of balls in the box = 10 red balls + 8 blue balls + 12 green balls = 30 balls\n\nNumber of blue balls = 8\n\nProbability of selecting a blue ball = (Number of blue balls) / (Total number of balls) = 8/30\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a blue ball = (8/2) / (30/2) = 4/15."
