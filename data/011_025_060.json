    "message_2": "To determine the winner, let's analyze the game from the end. \n\nIf there are 1, 2, or 3 stones left, the player who is about to play can take all the remaining stones and win the game. So, if a player can leave 4 stones for their opponent, they will guarantee a win.\n\nNow, let's work backward:\n\n- If there are 5 stones, the first player can take 1 stone, leaving 4 for the second player, and guarantee a win.\n- If there are 6 stones, the first player can take 2 stones, leaving 4 for the second player, and guarantee a win.\n- If there are 7 stones, the first player can take 3 stones, leaving 4 for the second player, and guarantee a win.\n- If there are 8 stones, no matter how many stones the first player takes (1, 2, or 3), the second player can take the remaining stones to leave 4 for the first player and guarantee a win.\n\nNow, we can see a pattern. If a player can leave a multiple of 4 stones for their opponent, they can guarantee a win. Since there are 15 stones in the pile, the first player can take 3 stones, leaving 12 (a multiple of 4) for the second player. From this point, the first player can always ensure that they leave a multiple of 4 stones for the second player by taking the remaining stones after the second player's move (e.g., if the second player takes 1 stone, the first player takes 3; if the second player takes 2, the first player takes 2; if the second player takes 3, the first player takes 1).\n\nTherefore, assuming both players play optimally, the first player will win this game."
