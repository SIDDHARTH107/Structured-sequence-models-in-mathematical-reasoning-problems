    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, consumers buying the product) out of n trials (the sample of 10 consumers), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (0.25 in this case), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (0.75 in this case).\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the probability that exactly 2 out of 10 consumers will buy the product, so we have:\n\nn = 10 (the sample size)\nk = 2 (the number of consumers we want to buy the product)\np = 0.25 (the probability of a consumer buying the product)\n1-p = 0.75 (the probability of a consumer not buying the product)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(10, 2), which is the number of combinations of 10 items taken 2 at a time:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!)\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!)\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(10, 2) * p^2 * (1-p)^(10-2)\nP(X = 2) = 45 * (0.25)^2 * (0.75)^8\nP(X = 2) â‰ˆ 0.2816\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 2 consumers out of a sample of 10 will buy the product is approximately 0.2816 or 28.16%."
