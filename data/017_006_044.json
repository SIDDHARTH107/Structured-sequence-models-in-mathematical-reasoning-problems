    "message_2": "To find the possible groups of order 35, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. Since 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are distinct primes, we can find the Sylow subgroups of order 5 and 7.\n\nLet G be a group of order 35. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups (n_5) divides 7 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups (n_7) divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility is n_7 = 1.\n\nLet P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G and Q be the unique 7-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P and Q are unique, they are both normal in G (by the Sylow Theorems). Now, we can consider the product of these subgroups, PQ. Since P and Q are normal in G, the product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime (5 and 7), we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 5 * 7 = 35. Thus, PQ = G.\n\nNow, we can show that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q. Since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, P âˆ© Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively. This is because P and Q are Sylow subgroups of prime order, and thus are cyclic.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one group of order 35 up to isomorphism, and it is the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively. This group is also cyclic, as the direct product of two cyclic groups of relatively prime orders is cyclic."
