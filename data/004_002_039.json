    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 4x + 5) / (x - 1) as x approaches 1, we can try to simplify the function first.\n\nWe can attempt to factor the numerator and see if there is a common factor with the denominator that can be canceled out:\n\n3x^2 - 4x + 5\n\nWe can use the factoring by grouping method:\n\n3x^2 - 4x + 5 = x(3x - 4) + 1(3x - 4)\n\nNow, we can factor out the common factor (3x - 4):\n\n3x^2 - 4x + 5 = (3x - 4)(x + 1)\n\nNow, the function becomes:\n\nf(x) = (3x^2 - 4x + 5) / (x - 1) = (3x - 4)(x + 1) / (x - 1)\n\nHowever, there is no common factor between the numerator and the denominator that can be canceled out. In this case, we can use the limit definition and substitute x = 1 directly into the function:\n\nlim (x -> 1) (3x^2 - 4x + 5) / (x - 1)\n\nHowever, when we substitute x = 1, we get:\n\n(3(1)^2 - 4(1) + 5) / (1 - 1) = (3 - 4 + 5) / 0 = 4 / 0\n\nSince division by zero is undefined, the limit does not exist."
