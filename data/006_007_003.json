    "message_1": "In the stock market, the probability of a certain stock price changing by more than $5 in a single day is 0.25. If an investor buys 100 shares of this stock, what is the probability that the total value of the investment will change by more than $500 in a single day?",
    "message_2": "Since the probability of the stock price changing by more than $5 in a single day is 0.25, we can use this information to determine the probability of the total value of the investment changing by more than $500 in a single day.\n\nIf the investor buys 100 shares of the stock, a change of more than $5 in the stock price would result in a change of more than $500 in the total value of the investment (100 shares * $5 = $500).\n\nSince the probability of the stock price changing by more than $5 is 0.25, the probability of the total value of the investment changing by more than $500 in a single day is also 0.25, or 25%."
