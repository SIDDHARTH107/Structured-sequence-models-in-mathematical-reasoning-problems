    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The production of one unit of A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time, while the production of one unit of B requires 2 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time. Each unit of A generates a profit of $50, and each unit of B generates a profit of $30. The company has 90 hours of labor and 60 hours of machine time available. What is the optimal number of units of each type of product the company should produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are as follows:\n\nLabor: 3x + 2y ≤ 90\nMachine time: 2x + 2y ≤ 60\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 50x + 30y.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the machine time constraint:\n\n2x + 2y ≤ 60\nx + y ≤ 30\n\nNow, we can find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. y ≥ 0 (since we cannot produce a negative number of units)\n2. x ≥ 0 (same reason as above)\n3. 3x + 2y ≤ 90\n4. x + y ≤ 30\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 30), (20, 10), and (30, 0). We will evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\nP(0, 0) = 50(0) + 30(0) = $0\nP(0, 30) = 50(0) + 30(30) = $900\nP(20, 10) = 50(20) + 30(10) = $1300\nP(30, 0) = 50(30) + 30(0) = $1500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 30 units of product A and 0 units of product B, resulting in a profit of $1500."
