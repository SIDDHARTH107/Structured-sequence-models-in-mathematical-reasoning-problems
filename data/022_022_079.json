    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform F(k) of the function f(x) = e^(2ix), we can use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken over all x from -∞ to ∞.\n\nIn this case, f(x) = e^(2ix), so we have:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(2ix) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(x(2i - 2πik))] dx\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use the Dirac delta function, which is defined as:\n\nδ(x) = 0 for x ≠ 0, and ∫[δ(x)] dx = 1 for the integral taken over all x from -∞ to ∞.\n\nThe Dirac delta function has the property that:\n\n∫[f(x) * δ(x - a)] dx = f(a) for any function f(x).\n\nIn our case, we want to find a value of k such that the exponent in the integral becomes zero:\n\n2i - 2πik = 0\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\nk = i / (π)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral using the Dirac delta function:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(x(2i - 2πik)) * δ(k - i/π)] dk\n\nSince the integral is taken over all k from -∞ to ∞, the Dirac delta function will \"pick out\" the value of F(k) when k = i/π:\n\nF(k) = (1/π) * δ(k - i/π)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform F(k) of the function f(x) = e^(2ix) is given by:\n\nF(k) = (1/π) * δ(k - i/π)"
