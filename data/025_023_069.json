    "message_2": "To compute the Euler characteristic of the intersection cohomology groups, we will use the following formula for the Euler characteristic of a space:\n\n$$\\chi(X) = \\sum_{i=0}^{2n} (-1)^i \\dim H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q}).$$\n\nFirst, let's compute $\\chi(I(X))$. Since $X$ has singularities of type $\\operatorname{A}_n$ at $p_1, \\dots, p_k$, the Euler characteristic of $X$ is given by:\n\n$$\\chi(I(X)) = \\sum_{i=0}^{2n} (-1)^i \\dim H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q}) - k\\sum_{i=0}^{n} (-1)^i \\dim H^i(\\operatorname{A}_n, \\mathbb{Q}).$$\n\nNow, let's compute $\\chi(J(X_i))$.
