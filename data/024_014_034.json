Consider the vector field $X=x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ on $M$. \n\nDetermine the Lie derivative of $X$ with respect to the vector field $Y=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ at the point $(1,1)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of $X$ with respect to the vector field $Y$, we use the Lie bracket $[Y, X]$. Recall that the Lie bracket is defined as $[Y, X] = Y(X) - X(Y)$, where $Y(X)$ and $X(Y)$ denote the action of the vector fields $Y$ and $X$ on the respective vector fields $X$ and $Y$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the action of $Y$ on $X$. We have:\n\n$Y(X) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}) = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + y\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + y\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x\\partial y}$.\n\nNow, let's compute the action of $X$ on $Y$. We have:\n\n$X(Y) = (x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y})(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}) = x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}) + y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}) = x\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + y\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y\\partial x}$.\n\nNow, we can compute the Lie bracket $[Y, X] = Y(X) - X(Y)$:\n\n$[Y, X] = (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + y\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x\\partial y}) - (x\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + y\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y\\partial x}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x\\partial y} - y\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y\\partial x}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the Lie derivative at the point $(1,1)$:\n\n$[Y, X](1,1) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(1,1) + 1\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x\\partial y}(1,1) - 1\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y\\partial x}(1,1) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(1,1)$.\n\nSince the Lie derivative is a vector field, we need to express it in terms of the basis vector fields $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$. In this case, the Lie derivative is simply:\n\n$[Y, X](1,1) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$.\n\nSo, the Lie derivative of $X$ with respect to the vector field $Y$ at the point $(1,1)$ is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$."
