    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using Fourier transform, we first take the Fourier transform of both sides of the differential equation:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}\\right\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{-u\\}$$\n\nUsing the property of Fourier transform for the second derivative, we have:\n\n$$-(k^2)\\hat{u}(k) = -\\hat{u}(k)$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$k^2\\hat{u}(k) = \\hat{u}(k)$$\n\nNow, we solve for $\\hat{u}(k)$:\n\n$$\\hat{u}(k) = C(k)e^{-k^2}$$\n\nWhere $C(k)$ is an arbitrary function of $k$. Next, we take the inverse Fourier transform of $\\hat{u}(k)$ to obtain the solution $u(x)$:\n\n$$u(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{C(k)e^{-k^2}\\}$$\n\nNow, we need to determine the function $C(k)$ by using the given boundary conditions $u(0) = 0$ and $u(\\pi) = 1$. To do this, we can use the Fourier sine series representation of the solution:\n\n$$u(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}b_n\\sin(nx)$$\n\nWhere $b_n$ are the Fourier coefficients given by:\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\pi}u(x)\\sin(nx)dx$$\n\nSince $u(0) = 0$, we have:\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\pi}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}b_n\\sin(nx)\\sin(nx)dx$$\n\nNow, we use the orthogonality property of sine functions to get:\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\pi}u(x)\\sin(nx)dx$$\n\nUsing the boundary condition $u(\\pi) = 1$, we can write the equation as:\n\n$$1 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}b_n\\sin(n\\pi)$$\n\nSince $\\sin(n\\pi) = 0$ for all integer values of $n$, there is no solution for the given boundary value problem using the Fourier transform method. This is because the given boundary conditions are inconsistent with the differential equation."
