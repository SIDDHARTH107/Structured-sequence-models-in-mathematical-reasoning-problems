    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y:\n\n$$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$$\n\nSubstituting this into the given partial differential equation, we get:\n\n$$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. We will call this constant $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2, \\qquad \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda^2$$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$$\n$$Y''(y) - \\lambda^2 Y(y) = 0$$\n\nWe will solve these equations separately, starting with the equation for X(x):\n\nThe general solution for X(x) is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) + B\\sin(\\lambda x)$$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $u(0, y) = 0$, we get:\n\n$$X(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 0$$\n\nSo, the solution for X(x) becomes:\n\n$$X(x) = B\\sin(\\lambda x)$$\n\nNow, we solve the equation for Y(y):\n\nThe general solution for Y(y) is:\n\n$$Y(y) = C\\cosh(\\lambda y) + D\\sinh(\\lambda y)$$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $u(x, 0) = 0$, we get:\n\n$$Y(0) = C\\cosh(0) + D\\sinh(0) = C = 0$$\n\nSo, the solution for Y(y) becomes:\n\n$$Y(y) = D\\sinh(\\lambda y)$$\n\nNow, we have the product solution:\n\n$$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y) = BD\\sin(\\lambda x)\\sinh(\\lambda y)$$\n\nTo satisfy the last boundary condition $u(x, 1) = 1 - e^{2x}$, we need to find a Fourier sine series representation of the function $1 - e^{2x}$:\n\n$$1 - e^{2x} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n \\sin(\\lambda_n x)$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda_n = n\\pi$ and\n\n$$b_n = 2\\int_0^1 (1 - e^{2x})\\sin(n\\pi x) dx$$\n\nNow, we can write the solution as a sum of product solutions:\n\n$$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n \\sin(n\\pi x)\\sinh(n\\pi y)$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $b_n$, we compute the integral:\n\n$$b_n = 2\\int_0^1 (1 - e^{2x})\\sin(n\\pi x) dx$$\n\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{2}{n\\pi}(1 - (-1)^n) - \\frac{4}{n^3\\pi^3}(1 - (-1)^n)$$\n\nFinally, the general solution of the given partial differential equation is:\n\n$$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[\\frac{2}{n\\pi}(1 - (-1)^n) - \\frac{4}{n^3\\pi^3}(1 - (-1)^n)\\right] \\sin(n\\pi x)\\sinh(n\\pi y)$$"
