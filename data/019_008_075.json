    "message_1": "A factory produces widgets with a weight of 10 grams, but due to the manufacturing process, the actual weight can vary by up to ±2 grams. Using fuzzy logic, determine the degree of membership of a widget that weighs 7.5 grams to the set of \"acceptable widgets\".",
    "message_2": "To determine the degree of membership of a 7.5-gram widget to the set of \"acceptable widgets\" using fuzzy logic, we first need to define the membership function for the acceptable weight range. Since the acceptable weight range is 10 grams ±2 grams, the range is from 8 grams to 12 grams.\n\nWe can use a triangular membership function for this problem, where the degree of membership is 0 outside the range [8, 12], 1 at the ideal weight of 10 grams, and linearly decreasing from 1 to 0 as the weight moves away from 10 grams within the range [8, 12].\n\nFor a widget weighing 7.5 grams, we can calculate the degree of membership as follows:\n\nSince 7.5 grams is outside the acceptable range [8, 12], the degree of membership is 0.\n\nTherefore, the degree of membership of a 7.5-gram widget to the set of \"acceptable widgets\" is 0."
