    "message_2": "To find the average value of a continuous function on a given interval, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = 2cos(x), and the interval is [0, π/2]. So, a = 0 and b = π/2.\n\nAverage value = (1/(π/2 - 0)) * ∫[0, π/2] 2cos(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of 2cos(x) with respect to x:\n\n∫2cos(x) dx = 2∫cos(x) dx = 2sin(x) + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral on the interval [0, π/2]:\n\n2sin(π/2) - 2sin(0) = 2(1) - 2(0) = 2\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the average value formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(π/2)) * 2 = 4/π\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 2cos(x) on the interval [0, π/2] is 4/π."
