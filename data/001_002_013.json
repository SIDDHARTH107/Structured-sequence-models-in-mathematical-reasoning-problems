Write a linear equation in slope-intercept form that represents the cost (y) of lawn care as a function of the number of hours worked (x), and calculate the total cost of 4 hours of lawn care services.",
    "message_2": "To write the linear equation in slope-intercept form, we can use the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope (rate of change) and b is the y-intercept (initial value).\n\nIn this case, the slope (m) is the additional cost per hour of work, which is $15. The y-intercept (b) is the flat fee of $50.\n\nSo the linear equation is: y = 15x + 50\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total cost of 4 hours of lawn care services. We can do this by plugging in x = 4 into the equation:\n\ny = 15(4) + 50\ny = 60 + 50\ny = $110\n\nThe total cost of 4 hours of lawn care services is $110."
