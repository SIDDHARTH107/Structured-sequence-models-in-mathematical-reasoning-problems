    "message_1": "Suppose two hunters are attempting to hunt a stag. Hunter A can hunt the stag alone with a probability of 0.6, while Hunter B can hunt the stag alone with a probability of 0.8. The stags are too fast for one person to catch them. If they both hunt together, they will have a probability of 0.9 to successfully hunt the stag. What is the best strategy for the hunters to maximize their chances of hunting the stag?",
    "message_2": "The best strategy for the hunters to maximize their chances of hunting the stag is to hunt together. Since the stags are too fast for one person to catch them, hunting alone will not be successful. When they hunt together, they have a probability of 0.9 to successfully hunt the stag, which is higher than the individual probabilities of 0.6 for Hunter A and 0.8 for Hunter B. Therefore, hunting together will maximize their chances of success."
