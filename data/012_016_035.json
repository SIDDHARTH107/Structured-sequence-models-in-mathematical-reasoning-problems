    "message_2": "The Tutte polynomial, also known as the Tutte–Whitney polynomial, is a polynomial invariant of a graph that generalizes various graph invariants, such as the chromatic polynomial and the flow polynomial. It is defined as T(x, y) = ∑(r, k) A(r, k) x^(r-c) y^(k-c), where the sum is over all subgraphs H of G, r is the number of connected components of H, k is the number of connected components of the complement of H, c is the number of connected components of G, and A(r, k) is the number of subgraphs of G with r connected components and k connected components in the complement.\n\nTo compute the Tutte polynomial for the given graph G, we can use the recursive deletion-contraction formula: T(G; x, y) = T(G-e; x, y) + T(G/e; x, y) for any edge e in G, where G-e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n\nLet's compute the Tutte polynomial for the given graph G:\n\n1. Choose edge AB. Compute T(G-AB; x, y) and T(G/AB; x, y).\n2. For T(G-AB; x, y), we have the following graph:\n\n```\n   A     B --- C\n  /      |      \\\n H      E      D\n  \\      |      /\n   G --- F --- I\n```\n\n3. Choose edge BC. Compute T(G-AB-BC; x, y) and T(G-AB/BC; x, y).\n4. For T(G-AB-BC; x, y), we have the following graph:\n\n```\n   A     B     C\n  /      |      \\\n H      E      D\n  \\      |      /\n   G --- F --- I\n```\n\nThe Tutte polynomial for this graph is (x-1)(y-1).\n\n5. For T(G-AB/BC; x, y), we have the following graph:\n\n```\n   A --- C\n  /      \\\n H      E-D\n  \\      /\n   G --- F --- I\n```\n\nThe Tutte polynomial for this graph is (x-1)(y-1) + (x-1).\n\n6. Now, compute T(G/AB; x, y). We have the following graph:\n\n```\n   A* --- C\n  /|      \\\n H |      D\n  \\|      /\n   G --- F --- I\n```\n\nHere, A* is the vertex resulting from the contraction of A and B.\n\n7. Choose edge A*C. Compute T(G/AB-A*C; x, y) and T(G/AB/A*C; x, y).\n8. For T(G/AB-A*C; x, y), we have the following graph:\n\n```\n   A*    C\n  /|      \\\n H |      D\n  \\|      /\n   G --- F --- I\n```\n\nThe Tutte polynomial for this graph is (x-1)(y-1) + (y-1).\n\n9. For T(G/AB/A*C; x, y), we have the following graph:\n\n```\n   A*\n  / \\\n H   D\n  \\ /\n   G --- F --- I\n```\n\nThe Tutte polynomial for this graph is (x-1)(y-1) + (x-1) + (y-1).\n\n10. Finally, we compute the Tutte polynomial for the original graph G using the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G-AB; x, y) + T(G/AB; x, y) = ((x-1)(y-1) + (x-1)) + ((x-1)(y-1) + (x-1) + (y-1)) = 2(x-1)(y-1) + 2(x-1) + (y-1).\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial for the given graph G is T(G; x, y) = 2(x-1)(y-1) + 2(x-1) + (y-1)."
