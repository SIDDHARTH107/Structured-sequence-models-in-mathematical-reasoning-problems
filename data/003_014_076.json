    "message_2": "To graph the function y = 2sin(3x) over two periods, we first need to determine the period, amplitude, and any phase shifts.\n\n1. Amplitude: The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, the amplitude is |2| = 2.\n\n2. Period: The period of a sine function is given by the formula (2π) / |B|, where B is the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, B = 3, so the period is (2π) / 3.\n\nNow, let's graph the function:\n\n1. Label the y-axis with a scale from -2 to 2, as the amplitude is 2.\n\n2. Label the x-axis with a scale that accommodates the period. Since the period is (2π) / 3, we can label the x-axis with multiples of π/3. For two periods, we need to go up to 4π/3.\n\n3. Plot the key points of the sine function within one period:\n   - At x = 0, y = 2sin(3*0) = 2sin(0) = 0.\n   - At x = π/6, y = 2sin(3*(π/6)) = 2sin(π/2) = 2.\n   - At x = π/3, y = 2sin(3*(π/3)) = 2sin(π) = 0.\n   - At x = π/2, y = 2sin(3*(π/2)) = 2sin(3π/2) = -2.\n   - At x = 2π/3, y = 2sin(3*(2π/3)) = 2sin(2π) = 0.\n\n4. Repeat the key points for the second period:\n   - At x = 7π/6, y = 2sin(3*(7π/6)) = 2sin(7π/2) = 2.\n   - At x = 4π/3, y = 2sin(3*(4π/3)) = 2sin(4π) = 0.\n\n5. Connect the points with a smooth curve to complete the graph of y = 2sin(3x) over two periods.\n\nRemember that this is a description of the graph. To actually visualize the graph, you can use graphing software or graphing calculator and input the function y = 2sin(3x) with the appropriate window settings."
