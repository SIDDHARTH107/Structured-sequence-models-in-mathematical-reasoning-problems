    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 using Newton's method, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined. \n\nStep 1: Find the derivative of the function.\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 11\n\nStep 2: Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x.\n3x^2 - 12x + 11 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -12, and c = 11.\n\nx = (12 ± √((-12)^2 - 4 * 3 * 11)) / (2 * 3)\nx = (12 ± √(144 - 132)) / 6\nx = (12 ± √12) / 6\n\nSo we have two critical points: x = (12 + √12) / 6 and x = (12 - √12) / 6.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the critical points are minima, maxima, or saddle points.\nTo do this, we can use the second derivative test. Find the second derivative of the function:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n\nf''((12 + √12) / 6) = 6((12 + √12) / 6) - 12 = 12 - 12 = 0\nf''((12 - √12) / 6) = 6((12 - √12) / 6) - 12 = 12 - 12 = 0\n\nSince the second derivative is equal to zero at both critical points, the second derivative test is inconclusive. We need to use another method to determine the nature of the critical points.\n\nStep 4: Use the first derivative to determine the nature of the critical points.\nWe can analyze the intervals around the critical points using the first derivative:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 11\n\nFor x < (12 - √12) / 6, the first derivative is positive, indicating an increasing function.\nFor (12 - √12) / 6 < x < (12 + √12) / 6, the first derivative is negative, indicating a decreasing function.\nFor x > (12 + √12) / 6, the first derivative is positive, indicating an increasing function.\n\nSince the function changes from increasing to decreasing at x = (12 - √12) / 6, this critical point is a local maximum. The function changes from decreasing to increasing at x = (12 + √12) / 6, so this critical point is a local minimum.\n\nStep 5: Find the minimum value of the function.\nThe minimum value of the function occurs at x = (12 + √12) / 6. To find the minimum value, plug this value of x back into the original function:\n\nf((12 + √12) / 6) = (((12 + √12) / 6)^3 - 6((12 + √12) / 6)^2 + 11((12 + √12) / 6) - 6\n\nThis is the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 using Newton's method."
