    "message_1": "Suppose that Bob uses ElGamal to securely exchange messages with Alice. Bob selects the prime number p=71 and chooses 2 as the primitive root. He also selects a secret key a=5. Bob generates his public key as follows: g=2, p=71, and h=g^a (mod p). Bob then receives the following encrypted message from Alice: (c1=32, c2=45). Using his secret key a and the information in the message, what is the decrypted message that Bob receives from Alice?",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute Bob's public key h:\nh = g^a (mod p) = 2^5 (mod 71) = 32\n\nNow, let's decrypt the message using the ElGamal decryption formula:\nM = c2 * (c1^a)^(-1) (mod p)\n\nFirst, compute c1^a (mod p):\nc1^a (mod p) = 32^5 (mod 71) = 52\n\nNow, compute the modular inverse of c1^a (mod p):\n52^(-1) (mod 71) can be computed using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or by finding the number x such that 52x â‰¡ 1 (mod 71). In this case, x = 68.\n\nFinally, compute the decrypted message M:\nM = c2 * (c1^a)^(-1) (mod p) = 45 * 68 (mod 71) = 3060 (mod 71) = 9\n\nSo, the decrypted message that Bob receives from Alice is 9."
