    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNote that the symmetric difference is commutative, meaning A Δ B = B Δ A. This property holds because the symmetric difference is based on the union and intersection of sets, both of which are commutative operations.\n\nHowever, the question seems to ask to show that the symmetric difference is not commutative using the Cartesian product. This is a misunderstanding, as the symmetric difference is indeed commutative. The Cartesian product, on the other hand, is not commutative in general. To illustrate this, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A:\n\nB x A = {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nComparing A x B and B x A, we can see that they are not equal:\n\nA x B ≠ B x A\n\nThis shows that the Cartesian product is not commutative, but it does not affect the commutative property of the symmetric difference."
