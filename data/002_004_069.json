    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)\n\nIn this case, the length is 10 cm and the width is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPerimeter = 2(10 + 5) = 2(15) = 30 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the rectangle is 30 cm."
