    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix, which consists of the partial derivatives of the given functions with respect to x and y.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^2 - xy - 10 and g(x, y) = y + 3xy^2 - 57. Then, the Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f/∂x  ∂f/∂y |\n          | ∂g/∂x  ∂g/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x - y\n∂f/∂y = -x\n∂g/∂x = 3y^2\n∂g/∂y = 1 + 6xy\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x - y   -x    |\n          | 3y^2     1+6xy |\n\nNow, we apply Newton's method using the initial guesses x0 = 3 and y0 = 4. The iteration formula for Newton's method for systems of equations is:\n\n(X_n+1, Y_n+1) = (X_n, Y_n) - J(X_n, Y_n)^(-1) * F(X_n, Y_n)\n\nwhere F(X_n, Y_n) is the vector of the functions evaluated at (X_n, Y_n), and J(X_n, Y_n)^(-1) is the inverse of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at (X_n, Y_n).\n\nFor the first iteration, we have (X_0, Y_0) = (3, 4). First, let's compute the Jacobian matrix and its inverse at this point:\n\nJ(3, 4) = | 2(3) - 4   -3  |\n          | 3(4)^2    1+6(3)(4) |\n\nJ(3, 4) = |  2   -3  |\n          | 48   73  |\n\nTo find the inverse of J(3, 4), we use the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix:\n\nJ(3, 4)^(-1) = (1/det(J(3, 4))) * |  73   3  |\n                                   | -48   2  |\n\nwhere det(J(3, 4)) = (2)(73) - (-3)(-48) = 146 - 144 = 2.\n\nSo, J(3, 4)^(-1) = |  36.5   1.5  |\n                   | -24     1    |\n\nNow, let's compute F(X_0, Y_0):\n\nF(3, 4) = | 3^2 - 3(4) - 10 |\n          | 4 + 3(3)(4^2) - 57 |\n\nF(3, 4) = | -1 |\n          |  35 |\n\nNow, we can compute the next approximation (X_1, Y_1):\n\n(X_1, Y_1) = (X_0, Y_0) - J(X_0, Y_0)^(-1) * F(X_0, Y_0)\n\n(X_1, Y_1) = (3, 4) - |  36.5   1.5  | * | -1 |\n                        | -24     1    |   | 35 |\n\n(X_1, Y_1) = (3, 4) - |  38  |\n                        | -59  |\n\n(X_1, Y_1) = (3 - 38, 4 + 59) = (-35, 63)\n\nSo, after one iteration of Newton's method, the approximate solution is (X_1, Y_1) = (-35, 63). Further iterations can be performed to refine the approximation, but it's important to note that Newton's method may not always converge to a solution, depending on the initial guess and the functions involved."
