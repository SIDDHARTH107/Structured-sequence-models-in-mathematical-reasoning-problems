Show that every element of G can be expressed in the form a^i b^j where i=0,1,2,3,4 and j=0,1. Also, prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20.",
    "message_2": "First, let's show that every element of G can be expressed in the form a^i b^j where i=0,1,2,3,4 and j=0,1.\n\nSince 'a' has order 10, the elements {1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9} are all distinct. Similarly, since 'b' has order 2, we have b^2 = 1. Now, consider the elements a^i b^j where i=0,1,2,3,4 and j=0,1. There are 10 such elements:\n\n{1, b, a, ab, a^2, a^2b, a^3, a^3b, a^4, a^4b}\n\nWe will show that these elements are distinct. Suppose that a^i b^j = a^k b^l for some i, k = 0,1,2,3,4 and j, l = 0,1. Then, we have:\n\na^(i-k) = b^(l-j)\n\nIf l = j, then i = k, and the elements are the same. If l ≠ j, then the left side of the equation is an element of order 10 (or 1), and the right side is an element of order 2 (or 1). The only way this equation can hold is if both sides are equal to 1. However, this would mean that i = k (mod 10), which contradicts our assumption that the elements are distinct.\n\nThus, the 10 elements {1, b, a, ab, a^2, a^2b, a^3, a^3b, a^4, a^4b} are distinct. Since G has 20 elements and we have found 10 distinct elements, there must be another set of 10 elements of the form a^i b^j where i=5,6,7,8,9 and j=0,1:\n\n{a^5, a^5b, a^6, a^6b, a^7, a^7b, a^8, a^8b, a^9, a^9b}\n\nNow, let's prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20.\n\n1. If G is abelian, then G is isomorphic to C20:\n\nSince G has elements of order 10 and 2, the only possible abelian group of order 20 is C20, which is the cyclic group generated by an element of order 20. In this case, the element 'a' generates a subgroup of order 10, and 'b' generates a subgroup of order 2. The product of these subgroups' orders is 10 * 2 = 20, which is equal to the order of G. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is isomorphic to C20.\n\n2. If G is non-abelian, then G is isomorphic to either D10 or the non-abelian group of order 20:\n\nIf G is non-abelian, then the commutator [a, b] = a^(-1) b^(-1) a b ≠ 1. There are two possibilities:\n\na) [a, b] = a^k for some k ≠ 0 (mod 10). In this case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10. The dihedral group D10 has 20 elements and is generated by an element of order 10 (a rotation) and an element of order 2 (a reflection). The relations between these generators are given by a^10 = b^2 = 1 and a^(-1) b^(-1) a b = a^k.\n\nb) [a, b] = a^5. In this case, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20. This group has 20 elements and is generated by elements of order 10 and 2, with the relation a^(-1) b^(-1) a b = a^5.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20."
