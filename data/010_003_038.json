    "message_2": "To determine the compactness of A, we will consider the closure of A, denoted as Cl(A), which is the union of A and its limit points. Since A has exactly 3 limit points, Cl(A) consists of A and these 3 limit points.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary closed set C containing these 3 limit points. Since X is a T2-space (also known as a Hausdorff space), every closed set in X is compact. Therefore, C is compact.\n\nSince Cl(A) is a subset of C, and C is compact, we can conclude that Cl(A) is compact as well. This is because compactness is a hereditary property, meaning that every closed subset of a compact space is also compact.\n\nNow, let's consider the compactness of A itself. We know that Cl(A) is compact, and A is a subset of Cl(A). If A is closed, then A is compact as well, since compactness is hereditary for closed subsets. However, if A is not closed, we cannot directly conclude that A is compact.\n\nIn general, we can say that the closure of A, Cl(A), is compact. However, without more information about the set A itself, we cannot definitively determine the compactness of A."
