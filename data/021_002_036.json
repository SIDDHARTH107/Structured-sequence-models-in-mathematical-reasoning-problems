    "message_2": "Let's perform the power iteration method using the given matrix A and initial guess vector [1; 1]. We will perform a few iterations to find an approximation of the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector.\n\nMatrix A:\n[4  1]\n[-2 3]\n\nInitial guess vector (v0):\n[1]\n[1]\n\n1st iteration:\nv1 = A * v0 = [4*1 + 1*1; -2*1 + 3*1] = [5; 1]\nEigenvalue (λ1) = v1(1) / v0(1) = 5 / 1 = 5\n\n2nd iteration:\nv2 = A * v1 = [4*5 + 1*1; -2*5 + 3*1] = [21; -7]\nEigenvalue (λ2) = v2(1) / v1(1) = 21 / 5 = 4.2\n\n3rd iteration:\nv3 = A * v2 = [4*21 + 1*(-7); -2*21 + 3*(-7)] = [77; -49]\nEigenvalue (λ3) = v3(1) / v2(1) = 77 / 21 ≈ 3.667\n\n4th iteration:\nv4 = A * v3 = [4*77 + 1*(-49); -2*77 + 3*(-49)] = [259; -203]\nEigenvalue (λ4) = v4(1) / v3(1) = 259 / 77 ≈ 3.364\n\nAfter 4 iterations, we can see that the eigenvalue is converging. Let's round the eigenvalue and eigenvector to three decimal places:\n\nDominant eigenvalue (λ) ≈ 3.364\n\nCorresponding eigenvector (v) ≈ [1; -0.783] (normalized to the first component)\n\nNote that the power iteration method only gives an approximation, and more iterations can be performed to get a more accurate result. However, for this problem, we have rounded the answer to three decimal places."
