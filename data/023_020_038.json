    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series expansion of the given function f(x) = x/(1 + x^2) over the interval (-π, π), we first need to determine if the function is even, odd, or neither. Since f(-x) = -x/(1 + (-x)^2) = -f(x), the function is odd.\n\nFor an odd function, the Fourier series expansion is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑[bn * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere bn = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x) dx] from -π to π.\n\nNow, we need to find the bn coefficients:\n\nbn = (2/π) * ∫[x/(1 + x^2) * sin(n * x) dx] from -π to π.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x/(1 + x^2) and dv = sin(n * x) dx.\nThen, du = (1 - x^2)/(1 + x^2)^2 dx and v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫[u * dv] = u * v - ∫[v * du]\n\nbn = (2/π) * [(-x/(1 + x^2)) * (-1/n) * cos(n * x) - ∫[(-1/n) * cos(n * x) * (1 - x^2)/(1 + x^2)^2 dx] from -π to π.\n\nNow, we need to solve the remaining integral:\n\n∫[(-1/n) * cos(n * x) * (1 - x^2)/(1 + x^2)^2 dx] from -π to π.\n\nUnfortunately, this integral does not have a simple closed-form solution. However, we can still express the Fourier series expansion in terms of this integral:\n\nf(x) = ∑[bn * sin(n * x)] = ∑[(2/π) * [(-x/(1 + x^2)) * (-1/n) * cos(n * x) - ∫[(-1/n) * cos(n * x) * (1 - x^2)/(1 + x^2)^2 dx] from -π to π] * sin(n * x)].\n\nThis is the Fourier series expansion of the function f(x) = x/(1 + x^2) over the interval (-π, π) in terms of the bn coefficients and the remaining integral."
