    "message_1": "What is the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the Lorenz attractor with parameter values of $\\rho = 28$, $\\sigma = 10$, and $\\beta = 8/3$? Convert your answer to scientific notation, accurate to 3 significant figures.",
    "message_2": "The maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Lorenz attractor can be calculated numerically. For the given parameter values of $\\rho = 28$, $\\sigma = 10$, and $\\beta = \\frac{8}{3}$, the maximum Lyapunov exponent is approximately 0.905. In scientific notation, this is $9.05 \\times 10^{-1}$."
