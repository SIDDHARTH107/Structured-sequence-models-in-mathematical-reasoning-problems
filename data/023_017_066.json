    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the fluid velocity field u(x) = 4cos(2πx/L), we will use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nU(k) = ∫[u(x) * e^(-ikx)] dx, where the integral is taken over the entire domain of x, and k is the wave number.\n\nIn this case, the fluid velocity field is given by u(x) = 4cos(2πx/L), where L = 2m. We will find the Fourier transform of this function.\n\nU(k) = ∫[4cos(2πx/L) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the Euler's formula: cos(θ) = (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ))/2\n\nSo, u(x) = 4cos(2πx/L) = 2(e^(i2πx/L) + e^(-i2πx/L))\n\nNow, we can rewrite the Fourier transform as:\n\nU(k) = ∫[2(e^(i2πx/L) + e^(-i2πx/L)) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nU(k) = 2∫[(e^(i2πx/L) * e^(-ikx) + e^(-i2πx/L) * e^(-ikx))] dx\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nU(k) = 2∫[(e^(-ix(k-2π/L)) + e^(-ix(k+2π/L)))] dx\n\nNow, we can integrate separately:\n\nU(k) = 2[∫(e^(-ix(k-2π/L))) dx + ∫(e^(-ix(k+2π/L))) dx]\n\nTo solve these integrals, we can use the following formula:\n\n∫(e^(ax)) dx = (1/a)e^(ax)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nU(k) = 2[(1/(-i(k-2π/L)))e^(-ix(k-2π/L)) + (1/(-i(k+2π/L)))e^(-ix(k+2π/L))]\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this expression over the entire domain of x. Since the problem does not specify the domain, we will assume it is one period of the cosine function, which is L = 2m in this case. So, we will evaluate the expression from x = 0 to x = L:\n\nU(k) = 2[(-1/i(k-2π/L))[e^(-iL(k-2π/L)) - 1] + (-1/i(k+2π/L))[e^(-iL(k+2π/L)) - 1]]\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nU(k) = 2[(-1/i(k-2π/L))[e^(-i2π(k-2π/L)) - 1] + (-1/i(k+2π/L))[e^(-i2π(k+2π/L)) - 1]]\n\nSince e^(-i2πn) = 1 for any integer n, we can see that the first term in the brackets will be zero for all k except when k = 2π/L, and the second term will be zero for all k except when k = -2π/L.\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform of the fluid velocity field u(x) = 4cos(2πx/L) is:\n\nU(k) = 2[(-1/i(k-2π/L))[1 - 1] + (-1/i(k+2π/L))[1 - 1]] for k ≠ ±2π/L\n\nU(k) = 0 for k ≠ ±2π/L\n\nU(2π/L) = 2[(-1/i(2π/L-2π/L))[1 - 1] + (-1/i(2π/L+2π/L))[1 - 1]] = -iL\n\nU(-2π/L) = 2[(-1/i(-2π/L-2π/L))[1 - 1] + (-1/i(-2π/L+2π/L))[1 - 1]] = iL\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the fluid velocity field is:\n\nU(k) = -iL for k = 2π/L\nU(k) = iL for k = -2π/L\nU(k) = 0 for k ≠ ±2π/L\n\nThe frequency components of this field are k = ±2π/L, which correspond to the spatial frequencies of the fluid velocity field."
