    "message_1": "A jewelry store has 30 necklaces of gold, silver, and platinum. 18 of the necklaces are made of gold and silver, 14 are made of silver and platinum, and 10 are made of gold and platinum. How many necklaces are made of gold only?",
    "message_2": "Let G be the number of gold necklaces, S be the number of silver necklaces, and P be the number of platinum necklaces. We are given the following information:\n\n1. G + S + P = 30 (total number of necklaces)\n2. G + S = 18 (gold and silver necklaces)\n3. S + P = 14 (silver and platinum necklaces)\n4. G + P = 10 (gold and platinum necklaces)\n\nWe can use these equations to solve for the number of gold-only necklaces. First, we can solve equation 2 for G:\n\nG = 18 - S\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for G into equation 4:\n\n(18 - S) + P = 10\n\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n\n18 - S + P = 10\nP - S = -8\n\nNow, we can solve equation 3 for P:\n\nP = 14 - S\n\nSubstitute this expression for P into the equation P - S = -8:\n\n(14 - S) - S = -8\n14 - 2S = -8\n\nNow, solve for S:\n\n2S = 22\nS = 11\n\nNow that we have the value for S, we can substitute it back into the equation G = 18 - S to find the value for G:\n\nG = 18 - 11\nG = 7\n\nSo, there are 7 necklaces made of gold only."
