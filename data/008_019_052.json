    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, let's write the given system in the matrix form:\n\n```\n| 1  2  3i | | x |   |  4i  |\n| 2 -1  i  | | y | = | -3   |\n| 3  4  2i | | z |   | 5+6i |\n```\n\nNow, we'll perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  2   3i | | x |   |  4i   |\n| 0 -5 -6i  | | y | = | -3-8i |\n| 0  2 -7i  | | z |   |  7+6i |\n```\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -5:\n\n```\n| 1  2   3i | | x |   |  4i    |\n| 0  1 6/5i | | y | = | 3/5+8/5i|\n| 0  2 -7i  | | z |   |  7+6i  |\n```\n\nStep 3: Subtract 2 times the second row from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  2   3i  | | x |   |  4i      |\n| 0  1  6/5i | | y | = |  3/5+8/5i |\n| 0  0 -17i  | | z |   |  1-10i   |\n```\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by -17i:\n\n```\nz = (-17i)^(-1) * (1 - 10i)\nz = (1/17) * (1 - 10i) * (1 + 10i)\nz = (1/17) * (1 + 100)\nz = 101/17\n```\n\nStep 5: Substitute z into the second row to find y:\n\n```\ny = (3/5 + 8/5i) - (6/5i) * (101/17)\ny = (3/5 + 8/5i) - (606/85i)\ny = (3/5) + (8/5 - 606/85)i\ny = (3/5) + (-34/17)i\n```\n\nStep 6: Substitute y and z into the first row to find x:\n\n```\nx = 4i - 2y - 3iz\nx = 4i - 2(3/5 - 34/17i) - 3i(101/17)\nx = 4i - (6/5 - 68/17i) - (303/17i)\nx = -6/5 + (4 - 68/17 + 303/17)i\nx = -6/5 + (4 + 235/17)i\nx = -6/5 + (69/17)i\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = -6/5 + (69/17)i\ny = 3/5 - (34/17)i\nz = 101/17\n```"
