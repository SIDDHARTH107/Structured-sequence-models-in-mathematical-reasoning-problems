    "message_2": "a) To find the singular points of the curve, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to $x$ and $y$, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are zero.\n\nLet $F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 3x - 2$. Then the partial derivatives are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 - 3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y)$ where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n$-3x^2 - 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = -1 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm i$\n\n$2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nHowever, since the curve is defined over real numbers, there are no singular points on the curve.\n\nb) To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point $(1, 2)$, we need to compute the gradient of the curve at that point. The gradient is given by the ratio of the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}}{\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}} = \\frac{3x^2 + 3}{2y}$\n\nAt the point $(1, 2)$, the gradient is:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3(1)^2 + 3}{2(2)} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)$\n\nPlugging in the point $(1, 2)$ and the gradient $\\frac{3}{2}$, we get:\n\n$y - 2 = \\frac{3}{2}(x - 1)$\n\nSimplifying, we get the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$y = \\frac{3}{2}x + \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nc) To show that the map $f: C \\rightarrow C'$ defined by $f(x, y) = (y^2, x)$ is a birational equivalence, we need to find an inverse map $g: C' \\rightarrow C$ such that $g(f(x, y)) = (x, y)$ and $f(g(u, v)) = (u, v)$.\n\nConsider the map $g: C' \\rightarrow C$ defined by $g(u, v) = (v, \\pm\\sqrt{u})$. We will show that this map is the inverse of $f$.\n\nFirst, let's compute $g(f(x, y))$:\n\n$g(f(x, y)) = g(y^2, x) = (x, \\pm\\sqrt{y^2}) = (x, \\pm y)$\n\nSince $y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 2$, we have that $y \\neq 0$. Therefore, we can choose the sign of $\\pm y$ such that $g(f(x, y)) = (x, y)$.\n\nNow, let's compute $f(g(u, v))$:\n\n$f(g(u, v)) = f(v, \\pm\\sqrt{u}) = ((\\pm\\sqrt{u})^2, v) = (u, v)$\n\nThus, the map $f$ is a birational equivalence between the curves $C$ and $C'$.\n\nNote that the equation of the curve $C'$ can be obtained by applying the map $f$ to the equation of the curve $C$:\n\n$v^2 = u^3 + 4u + 6$"
