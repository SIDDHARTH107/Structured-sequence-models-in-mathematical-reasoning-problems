    "message_2": "To find the probability of randomly selecting a day in June where the temperature exceeds 80 degrees Fahrenheit, we can use the information given about the past 10 years. \n\nWe know that on average, there are 20 days in June where the temperature exceeds 80 degrees Fahrenheit out of 30 days in the month. To find the probability, we can simply divide the number of days with temperatures above 80 degrees by the total number of days in June:\n\nProbability = (Number of days with temperature > 80Â°F) / (Total number of days in June)\n\nProbability = 20 days / 30 days\n\nProbability = 2/3 or approximately 0.67\n\nSo, the probability of randomly selecting a day in June where the temperature exceeds 80 degrees Fahrenheit is 2/3 or approximately 0.67 (67%)."
