    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products A and B. The production process involves three stages: Cutting, Machining and Assembly. The time required for each stage for each product is given in the table below:\n\n| Stage     | Product A | Product B |\n| --------- | --------- | --------- |\n| Cutting   | 2 hours   | 3 hours   |\n| Machining | 2 hours   | 1 hour    |\n| Assembly  | 4 hours   | 2 hours   |\n\nThe company has 12 hours available for Cutting, 10 hours available for Machining, and 16 hours available for Assembly in a day. Product A earns the company a profit of $30 per unit and product B earns a profit of $20 per unit. Determine the optimal production quantities of each product to maximize the company's profit, given that the company wants to produce at least 4 units of product A and at least 2 units of product B.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the production process are as follows:\n\n1. Cutting: 2x + 3y ≤ 12\n2. Machining: 2x + y ≤ 10\n3. Assembly: 4x + 2y ≤ 16\n4. Minimum production: x ≥ 4, y ≥ 2\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 30x + 20y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Cutting: y ≤ (12 - 2x)/3\n2. Machining: y ≤ 10 - 2x\n3. Assembly: y ≤ (16 - 4x)/2 = 8 - 2x\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of Cutting and Machining: (12 - 2x)/3 = 10 - 2x => x = 3, y = 2\n2. Intersection of Cutting and Assembly: (12 - 2x)/3 = 8 - 2x => x = 4, y = 2\n3. Intersection of Machining and Assembly: 10 - 2x = 8 - 2x => No solution\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. P(3, 2) = 30(3) + 20(2) = 90 + 40 = 130\n2. P(4, 2) = 30(4) + 20(2) = 120 + 40 = 160\n\nSince the company wants to produce at least 4 units of Product A and at least 2 units of Product B, the optimal production quantities are 4 units of Product A and 2 units of Product B, which will result in a maximum profit of $160."
