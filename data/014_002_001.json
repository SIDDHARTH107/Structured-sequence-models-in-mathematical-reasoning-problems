    "message_1": "Consider two parties, Alice and Bob, who want to establish a shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Alice chooses a prime number, p = 23, and a base number, g = 5. Bob chooses a secret number, a = 4, and calculates g^a mod p. Alice chooses a secret number, b = 3, and calculates g^b mod p. They exchange their results and compute their shared secret key. What is the value of the shared secret key?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the values that Alice and Bob exchange:\n\nAlice calculates g^b mod p:\n5^3 mod 23 = 125 mod 23 = 8\n\nBob calculates g^a mod p:\n5^4 mod 23 = 625 mod 23 = 10\n\nNow, they exchange their results (8 and 10) and compute the shared secret key:\n\nAlice computes the shared secret key as (Bob's result)^b mod p:\n10^3 mod 23 = 1000 mod 23 = 18\n\nBob computes the shared secret key as (Alice's result)^a mod p:\n8^4 mod 23 = 4096 mod 23 = 18\n\nThe shared secret key is 18."
