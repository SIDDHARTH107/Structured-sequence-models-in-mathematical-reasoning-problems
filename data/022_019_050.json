    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral of f(z) along the boundary of D(0,4), we will use the Cauchy integral formula. First, we parametrize the boundary of the disc, which is a circle with radius 4 centered at 0. We can parametrize it as:\n\nz(t) = 4 * e^(it), where t ∈ [0, 2π].\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of z(t) with respect to t:\n\ndz/dt = 4 * i * e^(it).\n\nNext, we substitute z(t) into f(z):\n\nf(z(t)) = (4 * e^(it))^2 / (4 * e^(it) - 3).\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral along the boundary of D(0,4) of f(z) dz:\n\n∫(f(z(t)) * dz/dt) dt = ∫((4 * e^(it))^2 / (4 * e^(it) - 3) * 4 * i * e^(it)) dt, where t ∈ [0, 2π].\n\nHowever, the function f(z) has a pole at z = 3, which is inside the disc D(0,4). According to the residue theorem, the integral of a function with a pole inside the contour is equal to 2πi times the residue of the function at the pole. \n\nTo find the residue, we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = (z² / (z - 3)) = (z² / (z - 3)) * ((z - 3) / (z - 3)) = ((z² + 3z - 3z + 9) / (z - 3)) = (z² - 3z + 9) / (z - 3).\n\nNow, we can find the residue of f(z) at z = 3:\n\nRes(f(z), 3) = (3² - 3 * 3 + 9) = (9 - 9 + 9) = 9.\n\nFinally, we can evaluate the integral:\n\n∫(f(z) dz) = 2πi * Res(f(z), 3) = 2πi * 9 = 18πi."
