    "message_1": "In an ultimatum game, Player 1 is given $10 to split with Player 2. Player 2 must either accept the offer or reject it. If Player 2 accepts, the money is split as proposed. If Player 2 rejects, both players receive nothing. What is the minimum amount of money that Player 1 should offer to Player 2 to ensure that Player 2 accepts the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the ultimatum game, the minimum amount of money that Player 1 should offer to Player 2 to ensure that Player 2 accepts the offer is $0.01, assuming that both players are rational and want to maximize their own payoff. This is because any amount greater than $0 is better for Player 2 than receiving nothing. However, in real-life situations, people may not always act rationally, and Player 2 might reject an offer that they perceive as unfair."
