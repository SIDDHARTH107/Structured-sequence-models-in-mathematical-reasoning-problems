    "message_2": "To determine the rank of matrix A, we need to find the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by performing row operations to get the matrix into row-echelon form.\n\nMatrix A:\n\\begin{bmatrix} \n2 & 4 & 6 \\\\ \n1 & 3 & 0 \\\\ \n2 & 6 & 8 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 1: Swap row 1 and row 2 to have the smallest non-zero element in the top-left corner.\n\\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 3 & 0 \\\\ \n2 & 4 & 6 \\\\ \n2 & 6 & 8 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 2: Subtract 2 times row 1 from row 2, and subtract 2 times row 1 from row 3.\n\\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 3 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & -2 & 6 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 8 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 3: Divide row 2 by -2 and row 3 by 8.\n\\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 3 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & 1 & -3 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 1 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can see that all three rows are linearly independent (non-zero rows). Therefore, the rank of matrix A is 3."
