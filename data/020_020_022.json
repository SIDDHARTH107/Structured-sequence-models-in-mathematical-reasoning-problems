    "message_2": "To minimize the surface area of the can while maintaining a volume of 50 cubic inches, we'll use calculus to find the optimal dimensions.\n\nLet r be the radius and h be the height of the cylindrical can. The volume V and surface area A of the cylinder are given by:\n\nV = πr^2h\nA = 2πrh + 2πr^2\n\nSince the volume must be 50 cubic inches, we have:\n\n50 = πr^2h\n\nWe can solve for h in terms of r:\n\nh = 50/(πr^2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the surface area formula:\n\nA(r) = 2πr(50/(πr^2)) + 2πr^2\nA(r) = 100/r + 2πr^2\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we'll find the critical points by taking the derivative of A(r) with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dr = -100/r^2 + 4πr\n\nNow, set dA/dr = 0 and solve for r:\n\n0 = -100/r^2 + 4πr\n100/r^2 = 4πr\n100 = 4πr^3\nr^3 = 100/(4π)\nr^3 = 25/π\nr = (25/π)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can find the height h using the expression we derived earlier:\n\nh = 50/(πr^2)\nh = 50/(π(25/π)^(2/3))\nh = 50/(25^(2/3))\nh = 2(25/π)^(1/3)\n\nSo, the optimal dimensions for the cylindrical can are:\nr ≈ (25/π)^(1/3) ≈ 1.241 inches\nh ≈ 2(25/π)^(1/3) ≈ 2.482 inches"
