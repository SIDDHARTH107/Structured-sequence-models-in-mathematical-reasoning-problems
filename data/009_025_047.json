    "message_2": "To find the fair value of the European call option, we can use the Black-Scholes-Merton formula:\n\n$C(S_0, K, T, r, \\sigma) = S_0 N(d_1) - Ke^{-rT} N(d_2)$,\n\nwhere\n$C$ is the option price,\n$S_0$ is the current stock price,\n$K$ is the strike price,\n$T$ is the time to expiration (in years),\n$r$ is the risk-free rate,\n$\\sigma$ is the volatility,\n$N(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and\n$d_1$ and $d_2$ are given by:\n\n$d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(\\frac{S_0}{K}) + (r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}$,\n\n$d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T}$.\n\nGiven the parameters $S_0 = 100$, $K = 110$, $T = \\frac{3}{12} = 0.25$, $r = 0.03$, and $\\sigma = 0.2$, we can calculate $d_1$ and $d_2$:\n\n$d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(\\frac{100}{110}) + (0.03 + \\frac{0.2^2}{2})(0.25)}{0.2\\sqrt{0.25}} = -0.4732$,\n\n$d_2 = -0.4732 - 0.2\\sqrt{0.25} = -0.6732$.\n\nNow, we can find the cumulative distribution function values $N(d_1)$ and $N(d_2)$:\n\n$N(d_1) = N(-0.4732) = 0.3180$,\n\n$N(d_2) = N(-0.6732) = 0.2506$.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the option price:\n\n$C(100, 110, 0.25, 0.03, 0.2) = 100 \\times 0.3180 - 110e^{-0.03 \\times 0.25} \\times 0.2506 = 31.80 - 27.22 = 4.58$.\n\nThus, the fair value of the call option is $4.58."
