    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 135 is divided by 7 using modular arithmetic, we can use the congruence relation. We are looking for a number x such that:\n\n135 ≡ x (mod 7)\n\nWe can rewrite 135 as a multiple of 7 plus the remainder:\n\n135 = 7 * 19 + 2\n\nSo, 135 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 135 is divided by 7 is 2."
