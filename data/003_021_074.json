    "message_2": "Let's denote the angle between the direction the plane is pointing and the direction it is actually traveling as θ. We can use the law of cosines to solve for θ.\n\nFirst, let's break down the wind vector into its westward and southward components. Since the wind is blowing from the south-west, it is blowing at a 45-degree angle to the westward direction. We can use the sine and cosine functions to find the westward and southward components of the wind vector:\n\nWestward component of wind = 200 * cos(45°) = 200 * (√2 / 2) = 100√2 km/h\nSouthward component of wind = 200 * sin(45°) = 200 * (√2 / 2) = 100√2 km/h\n\nNow, let's find the actual westward and southward components of the plane's velocity:\n\nActual westward component = Plane's westward velocity + Westward component of wind\nActual westward component = 500 km/h + 100√2 km/h\n\nActual southward component = Southward component of wind\nActual southward component = 100√2 km/h\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the plane's actual velocity:\n\nActual velocity^2 = (Actual westward component)^2 + (Actual southward component)^2\nActual velocity^2 = (500 + 100√2)^2 + (100√2)^2\n\nActual velocity = √((500 + 100√2)^2 + (100√2)^2)\n\nNow, we can use the law of cosines to find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (Plane's westward velocity^2 + Actual velocity^2 - Actual southward component^2) / (2 * Plane's westward velocity * Actual velocity)\n\ncos(θ) = ((500)^2 + ((500 + 100√2)^2 + (100√2)^2) - (100√2)^2) / (2 * 500 * √((500 + 100√2)^2 + (100√2)^2))\n\nθ = arccos(((500)^2 + ((500 + 100√2)^2 + (100√2)^2) - (100√2)^2) / (2 * 500 * √((500 + 100√2)^2 + (100√2)^2)))\n\nθ ≈ 11.31°\n\nSo, the angle between the direction the plane is pointing and the direction it is actually traveling due to the effect of the wind is approximately 11.31°."
