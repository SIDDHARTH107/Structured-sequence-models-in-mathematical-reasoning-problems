    "message_2": "To calculate the magnitude of the frequency component at coordinates (100, 200) in the frequency domain representation of a 512 x 512 image matrix, we first need to apply the two-dimensional Fourier transform to the image matrix. Let's denote the image matrix as I(x, y) and its Fourier transform as F(u, v).\n\nThe two-dimensional Fourier transform is given by:\n\nF(u, v) = ∑(x=0 to 511) ∑(y=0 to 511) I(x, y) * exp(-2 * pi * i * (ux + vy) / 512)\n\nwhere i is the imaginary unit, and u and v are the frequency coordinates.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the magnitude of the frequency component at coordinates (100, 200):\n\nF(100, 200) = ∑(x=0 to 511) ∑(y=0 to 511) I(x, y) * exp(-2 * pi * i * (100x + 200y) / 512)\n\nTo find the magnitude, we take the absolute value of F(100, 200):\n\n|F(100, 200)| = |∑(x=0 to 511) ∑(y=0 to 511) I(x, y) * exp(-2 * pi * i * (100x + 200y) / 512)|\n\nSince we don't have the actual image matrix I(x, y), we cannot compute the exact value of |F(100, 200)|. However, if you have the image matrix, you can plug it into the formula and calculate the magnitude of the frequency component at coordinates (100, 200), then round off the answer to the nearest whole number."
