    "message_2": "We will use Liouville's theorem, which states that every bounded entire function must be constant.\n\nLet $g(z) = f(z) - f(-1) = f(z) - 1$. Then $g(z)$ is also an entire function, and $g(\\frac{1}{2}) = -1$ and $g(-1) = 0$. Moreover, $g(z)$ is bounded on the real line since $f(z)$ is bounded on the real line.\n\nNow, consider the function $h(z) = e^{g(z)}$. This is also an entire function, and $h(\\frac{1}{2}) = e^{-1}$ and $h(-1) = e^0 = 1$. Since $g(z)$ is bounded on the real line, there exists a constant $M > 0$ such that $|g(x)| \\leq M$ for all real $x$. Then, for all real $x$, we have $|h(x)| = |e^{g(x)}| \\leq e^M$, which means that $h(z)$ is also bounded on the real line.\n\nBy Liouville's theorem, $h(z)$ must be a constant function. Let $h(z) = C$ for all $z$. Then, $e^{g(z)} = C$, and $g(z) = \\log(C)$, where $\\log$ denotes the natural logarithm. Finally, we have $f(z) = g(z) + 1 = \\log(C) + 1$.\n\nSince $f(\\frac{1}{2}) = 0$ and $f(-1) = 1$, we have $\\log(C) + 1 = 0$ and $\\log(C) + 1 = 1$. This implies that $\\log(C) = -1$ and $\\log(C) = 0$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no entire functions $f(z)$ that satisfy the given conditions."
