    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x) = 1/(1+x^2) over the interval -π < x < π, we need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n.\n\nThe general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx))\n\nwhere n goes from 1 to infinity.\n\nThe Fourier coefficients are given by the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] 1/(1+x^2) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the arctangent function:\n\n∫ 1/(1+x^2) dx = arctan(x) + C\n\nSo,\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [arctan(π) - arctan(-π)] = 2/π\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (1/(1+x^2)) * cos(nx) dx\n\nUnfortunately, this integral does not have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. However, we can express the result in terms of special functions, such as the sine and cosine integral functions (Si and Ci).\n\nSimilarly, for b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (1/(1+x^2)) * sin(nx) dx\n\nThis integral also does not have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions.\n\nSo, the Fourier series of f(x) = 1/(1+x^2) over the interval -π < x < π is:\n\nf(x) = (1/π) + Σ(a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx))\n\nwhere a_n and b_n are given in terms of special functions, and the summation goes from n = 1 to infinity."
