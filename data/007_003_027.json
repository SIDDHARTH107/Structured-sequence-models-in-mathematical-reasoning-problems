    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 3^11 is divided by 7 using modular arithmetic, we can use the property of congruence:\n\na ≡ b (mod m) if and only if a mod m = b mod m\n\nFirst, let's find the powers of 3 modulo 7:\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n3^2 ≡ 9 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n3^3 ≡ 3^2 * 3 ≡ 2 * 3 ≡ 6 (mod 7)\n3^4 ≡ 3^2 * 3^2 ≡ 2 * 2 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n3^5 ≡ 3^4 * 3 ≡ 4 * 3 ≡ 12 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can see a pattern:\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n3^2 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n3^3 ≡ 6 (mod 7)\n3^4 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n3^5 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n3^6 ≡ 3^5 * 3 ≡ 5 * 3 ≡ 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSince 3^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we can use this property to find the remainder of 3^11:\n\n3^11 ≡ 3^(6*1 + 5) ≡ (3^6)^1 * 3^5 ≡ 1^1 * 3^5 ≡ 1 * 5 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the remainder when 3^11 is divided by 7 is 5."
