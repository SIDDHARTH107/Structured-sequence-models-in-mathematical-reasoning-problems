    "message_1": "Using predicate logic, solve the given problem:\n\nThe statement \"All cats are mammals\" can be represented as ∀x (P(x) → Q(x)), where P(x) represents x is a cat and Q(x) represents x is a mammal. If there are 50 animals in the room and 30 of them are cats, how many of those animals are mammals according to this statement?",
    "message_2": "According to the statement \"All cats are mammals\" represented as ∀x (P(x) → Q(x)), if an animal is a cat (P(x)), then it is also a mammal (Q(x)). Since there are 30 cats in the room, all of them are mammals. However, this statement does not provide any information about the other 20 animals in the room. \n\nSo, we can only conclude that at least 30 animals in the room are mammals (the 30 cats). The number of mammals could be anywhere between 30 and 50, depending on the types of the other 20 animals."
