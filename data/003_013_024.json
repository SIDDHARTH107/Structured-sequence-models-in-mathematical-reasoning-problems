    "message_1": "A tower is located 200 meters away from a straight road. An observer is standing on the road, and the angle of elevation to the top of the tower measures 60 degrees. If the observer moves 100 meters closer to the tower, what is the new angle of elevation to the top of the tower? Find the maximum and minimum height of the tower.",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the height of the tower using the initial angle of elevation and distance from the observer to the tower.\n\nWe can use the tangent function in this case:\ntan(angle) = height / distance\n\ntan(60 degrees) = height / 200 meters\n\nTo find the height, we can rearrange the formula:\nheight = 200 meters * tan(60 degrees)\n\nSince tan(60 degrees) = √3, we have:\nheight = 200 meters * √3 ≈ 346.41 meters\n\nNow, let's find the new angle of elevation when the observer moves 100 meters closer to the tower. The new distance from the observer to the tower is 200 meters - 100 meters = 100 meters.\n\nWe can use the same tangent function:\ntan(new angle) = height / new distance\n\ntan(new angle) = 346.41 meters / 100 meters\n\nnew angle = arctan(3.4641) ≈ 74.21 degrees\n\nSo, the new angle of elevation to the top of the tower is approximately 74.21 degrees.\n\nAs for the maximum and minimum height of the tower, since the tower is a fixed structure, its height remains constant at approximately 346.41 meters."
