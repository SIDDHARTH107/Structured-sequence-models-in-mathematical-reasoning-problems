    "message_2": "To find the integral of cos(x) from 0 to π/2, we first need to find the antiderivative of cos(x). The antiderivative of cos(x) is sin(x). Now, we will evaluate sin(x) at the limits of integration:\n\n∫(cos(x) dx) from 0 to π/2 = sin(x) evaluated from 0 to π/2\n\n= sin(π/2) - sin(0)\n\n= 1 - 0\n\n= 1\n\nSo, the integral of cos(x) from 0 to π/2 is 1."
