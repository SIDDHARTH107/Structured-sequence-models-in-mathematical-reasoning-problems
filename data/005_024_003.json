    "message_1": "A car dealer has a dataset containing the age (in years) and the price (in thousands of dollars) of 20 used cars that were recently sold. The dataset has a mean age of 5 years and a standard deviation of 2 years. The mean sale price is $15,000 with a standard deviation of $3,000. The dealer is interested in finding the correlation coefficient between the age and the sale price of these cars. What is the correlation coefficient between age and sale price?",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient between the age and the sale price of these cars, we need the covariance between the two variables and the standard deviations of both variables. Unfortunately, the information provided is not sufficient to calculate the correlation coefficient directly.\n\nThe correlation coefficient (r) is calculated using the following formula:\n\nr = Cov(X, Y) / (ﾏダX * ﾏダY)\n\nWhere Cov(X, Y) is the covariance between the age (X) and the sale price (Y), and ﾏダX and ﾏダY are the standard deviations of the age and the sale price, respectively.\n\nWe are given the mean and standard deviation of both variables, but we do not have the covariance between the two variables. Without the covariance, we cannot calculate the correlation coefficient."
