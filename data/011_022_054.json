    "message_1": "A student has a knapsack that can carry at most 15 kgs of weight. The student has the following items:\n- A book that weighs 2 kgs and is worth $10.\n- A laptop that weighs 3 kgs and is worth $500.\n- A water bottle that weighs 1 kg and is worth $5.\n- A jacket that weighs 4 kgs and is worth $50.\n- A pair of running shoes that weigh 2 kgs and are worth $80.\n\nWhat is the maximum value of items that the student can carry in their knapsack, assuming they cannot carry fractional amounts of any item?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the value of items in the knapsack, the student should prioritize items with the highest value-to-weight ratio. \n\n1. Laptop: value-to-weight ratio = $500 / 3 kg = $166.67/kg\n2. Running shoes: value-to-weight ratio = $80 / 2 kg = $40/kg\n3. Jacket: value-to-weight ratio = $50 / 4 kg = $12.50/kg\n4. Book: value-to-weight ratio = $10 / 2 kg = $5/kg\n5. Water bottle: value-to-weight ratio = $5 / 1 kg = $5/kg\n\nThe student should first take the laptop (3 kg, $500), then the running shoes (2 kg, $80), then the jacket (4 kg, $50), and finally the water bottle (1 kg, $5) or the book (2 kg, $10), depending on the remaining weight capacity.\n\nLaptop + running shoes + jacket = 3 kg + 2 kg + 4 kg = 9 kg\nRemaining weight capacity = 15 kg - 9 kg = 6 kg\n\nSince the student has 6 kg of remaining weight capacity, they can take both the water bottle and the book.\n\nTotal value = $500 (laptop) + $80 (running shoes) + $50 (jacket) + $5 (water bottle) + $10 (book) = $645\n\nThe maximum value of items the student can carry in their knapsack is $645."
