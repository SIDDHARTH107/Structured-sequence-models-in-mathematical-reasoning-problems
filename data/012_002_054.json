    "message_2": "To find the chromatic number of the graph, we need to determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nLet's try to color the graph using the given edges:\n\n1. Color A with color 1.\n2. Color B with color 2 (since it's connected to A).\n3. Color C with color 3 (since it's connected to both A and B).\n4. Color D with color 2 (since it's connected to A, but not B).\n5. Color E with color 1 (since it's connected to B and D, but not A).\n6. Color F with color 1 (since it's connected to C, but not A, B, D, or E).\n\nWe have successfully colored the graph using 3 colors, and it's not possible to color it with fewer colors since vertices A, B, and C are all connected to each other, forming a triangle. Therefore, the chromatic number of the graph is 3."
