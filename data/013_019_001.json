    "message_1": "Consider a two-player game where each player can either cooperate or defect. If both players cooperate, they receive a payoff of 5. If one player cooperates and the other defects, the defector gets a payoff of 8 and the cooperator gets a payoff of 0. If both players defect, they each receive a payoff of 1. \n\nNow, suppose before playing the game, the two players can communicate and make promises to each other (i.e., engage in cheap talk). If both players always keep their promises, then what is the best outcome they can achieve?",
    "message_2": "If both players always keep their promises and they communicate before playing the game, the best outcome they can achieve is for both players to cooperate. In this case, both players will receive a payoff of 5. This is the best outcome because it maximizes the total payoff for both players (5+5=10) and is better than the other possible outcomes:\n\n- If one player cooperates and the other defects, the total payoff is 8 (8+0=8).\n- If both players defect, the total payoff is 2 (1+1=2).\n\nSo, the best outcome they can achieve is for both players to cooperate and receive a payoff of 5 each."
