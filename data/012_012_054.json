    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of graph G, we can use the following inequality:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * m / n + 1\n\nwhere m is the number of edges (20) and n is the number of vertices (12).\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * 20 / 12 + 1\ngirth(G) ≤ 40 / 12 + 1\ngirth(G) ≤ 3.33 + 1\n\nSince the girth must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 4\n\nTherefore, the girth of graph G is at most 4. However, we need to check if a graph with 12 vertices and 20 edges can have a girth of 3, which is the next smallest possible girth value.\n\nA graph with girth 3 is a triangle, and the maximum number of triangles that can be formed with 12 vertices is given by the Turán's theorem:\n\nm ≤ (n^2 - n * girth(G)) / (2 * (girth(G) - 1))\n\nFor girth(G) = 3:\n\nm ≤ (12^2 - 12 * 3) / (2 * (3 - 1))\nm ≤ (144 - 36) / 4\nm ≤ 108 / 4\nm ≤ 27\n\nSince 20 edges are less than the maximum number of edges (27) for a graph with girth 3 and 12 vertices, it is possible for graph G to have a girth of 3.\n\nThus, the girth of graph G is 3."
