    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph G, we can use the concept of graph coloring and the chromatic number. The chromatic number is the smallest number of colors needed to color a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nWe can start by trying to color the graph using the greedy coloring algorithm. The greedy coloring algorithm colors the vertices in order, assigning the smallest available color to each vertex.\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A.\n2. Color vertex 2 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertex 1 with color A).\n3. Color vertex 3 with color C (since it's adjacent to vertices 1 and 2 with colors A and B).\n4. Color vertex 4 with color A (since it's only adjacent to vertex 2 with color B).\n5. Color vertex 5 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertices 3 and 4 with colors C and A).\n6. Color vertex 6 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertices 1 and 5 with colors A and B).\n7. Color vertex 7 with color A (since it's adjacent to vertices 2 and 6 with colors B and C).\n8. Color vertex 8 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertices 4 and 7 with colors A and B).\n\nThe graph can be colored using 3 colors (A, B, and C). Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph G is 3."
