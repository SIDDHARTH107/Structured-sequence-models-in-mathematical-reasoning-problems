    "message_2": "a) To find the bandwidth of the network, we need to find the -3dB cutoff frequency of the system. The -3dB cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the magnitude of the frequency response is reduced to 1/sqrt(2) times its maximum value. \n\nb) To find the frequency response of the network, we need to compute the Fourier transform of the impulse response h(t) = e^(-2t). The Fourier transform of h(t) is given by:\n\nH(f) = ∫ h(t) * e^(-j2πft) dt\nH(f) = ∫ e^(-2t) * e^(-j2πft) dt, for t >= 0\n\nTo compute the integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = e^(-2t) and dv = e^(-j2πft) dt\nThen du = -2e^(-2t) dt and v = (-1/j2πf)e^(-j2πft)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\nH(f) = (-1/j2πf)e^(-2t)e^(-j2πft) - ∫ (-1/j2πf)e^(-j2πft) * -2e^(-2t) dt\nH(f) = (-1/j2πf)e^(-2t)e^(-j2πft) + (2/j2πf) ∫ e^(-2t)e^(-j2πft) dt\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral from 0 to infinity:\n\nH(f) = lim(T->∞) [(-1/j2πf)e^(-2t)e^(-j2πft) + (2/j2πf) ∫[0 to T] e^(-2t)e^(-j2πft) dt]\n\nThe first term goes to zero as T goes to infinity, so we are left with:\n\nH(f) = (2/j2πf) ∫[0 to ∞] e^(-2t)e^(-j2πft) dt\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nH(f) = (2/j2πf) ∫[0 to ∞] e^(-2t - j2πft) dt\n\nTo solve the integral, we can use the formula for the integral of an exponential function:\n\n∫ e^(at) dt = (1/a)e^(at)\n\nApplying this formula, we get:\n\nH(f) = (2/j2πf) * [(-1/2 - jπf)e^(-2t - j2πft)] [0 to ∞]\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\nH(f) = (2/j2πf) * [(-1/2 - jπf)e^(-∞) - (-1/2 - jπf)e^(0)]\nH(f) = (2/j2πf) * [0 - (-1/2 - jπf)]\nH(f) = (2/j2πf) * (1/2 + jπf)\n\nFinally, we can simplify the expression:\n\nH(f) = 1 / (1 + j2πf)\n\nc) To find the maximum bit rate that can be transmitted through this network, we can use the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, which states that the maximum bit rate is twice the bandwidth of the network. Since we already found the -3dB cutoff frequency in part (a), we can use that to find the bandwidth and then calculate the maximum bit rate.\n\nHowever, we need to find the -3dB cutoff frequency first. Let's denote the cutoff frequency as f_c. We need to find f_c such that:\n\n|H(f_c)| = 1/sqrt(2) * |H(0)|\n\nSince |H(0)| = 1, we have:\n\n|H(f_c)| = 1/sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of H(f):\n\n|H(f)| = |1 / (1 + j2πf)|\n\nAt the cutoff frequency f_c:\n\n|H(f_c)| = |1 / (1 + j2πf_c)| = 1/sqrt(2)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n1 / (1 + (2πf_c)^2) = 1/2\n\nSolving for f_c:\n\n(2πf_c)^2 = 1\nf_c = 1 / (2π)\n\nNow, we can find the maximum bit rate using the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem:\n\nMaximum bit rate = 2 * Bandwidth = 2 * f_c = 2 / (2π) ≈ 0.3183 bits per second\n\nSo, the maximum bit rate that can be transmitted through this network is approximately 0.3183 bits per second."
