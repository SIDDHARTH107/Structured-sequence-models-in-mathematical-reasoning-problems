    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to write the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be written in matrix form as:\n\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 1 & 1\\\\\n4 & 6 & 2\\\\\n-2 & 4 & 3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nx = \\begin{bmatrix}\nx\\\\\ny\\\\\nz\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nb = \\begin{bmatrix}\n9\\\\\n30\\\\\n4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we need to perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we need to find orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R:\n\nQ = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0.333 & -0.182 & 0.925\\\\\n0.667 & -0.546 & -0.308\\\\\n-0.333 & 0.818 & 0.308\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nR = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6 & 6 & 2\\\\\n0 & 4.36 & 2.18\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1.54\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Qtb:\n\nQt = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0.333 & 0.667 & -0.333\\\\\n-0.182 & -0.546 & 0.818\\\\\n0.925 & -0.308 & 0.308\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nQt * b = \\begin{bmatrix}\n15\\\\\n-12.36\\\\\n2.31\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x + 6y + 2z &= 15\\\\\n4.36y + 2.18z &= -12.36\\\\\n1.54z &= 2.31\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving this system using back-substitution, we get:\n\nz = 2.31 / 1.54 ≈ 1.5\n\ny = (-12.36 - 2.18 * 1.5) / 4.36 ≈ 2\n\nx = (15 - 6 * 2 - 2 * 1.5) / 6 ≈ 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx ≈ 1, y ≈ 2, z ≈ 1.5"
