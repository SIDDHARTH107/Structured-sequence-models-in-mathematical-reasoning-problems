    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem based on Solving non-homogeneous systems of linear equations:\n```\nSolve the following system of linear equations for x, y, and z:\n   3x + 5y - 2z = 14\n   2x - y + 4z = 6\n  -4x + 2y + 3z = -7\n```",
    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution, elimination, or matrices. In this case, I will use the matrix method.\n\nFirst, we write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n```\n[ 3  5 -2 | 14 ]\n[ 2 -1  4 |  6 ]\n[-4  2  3 | -7 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2:\n\n```\n[ 2 -1  4 |  6 ]\n[ 3  5 -2 | 14 ]\n[-4  2  3 | -7 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-3/2) * Row 1 + Row 2:\n\n```\n[  2  -1   4 |   6 ]\n[  0   7 -10 |   5 ]\n[ -4   2   3 |  -7 ]\n```\n\n3. Replace Row 3 with 2 * Row 1 + Row 3:\n\n```\n[  2  -1   4 |   6 ]\n[  0   7 -10 |   5 ]\n[  0   0  11 |   5 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. We can now perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. Divide Row 3 by 11:\n\n```\nz = 5/11\n```\n\n2. Substitute z into Row 2 and solve for y:\n\n```\n7y - 10(5/11) = 5\ny = (5 + 50/11) / 7\ny = (105/11) / 7\ny = 15/11\n```\n\n3. Substitute y and z into Row 1 and solve for x:\n\n```\n2x - (15/11) + 4(5/11) = 6\n2x = 6 + (15/11) - (20/11)\n2x = (66 + 15 - 20) / 11\n2x = 61/11\nx = 61/22\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = 61/22\ny = 15/11\nz = 5/11\n```"
