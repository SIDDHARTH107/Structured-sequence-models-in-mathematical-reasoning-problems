    "message_2": "Cauchy's theorem states that if a function is analytic (holomorphic) in a simply connected domain containing a closed contour C, then the integral of the function over C is zero. In other words, if f(z) is analytic in a domain D containing C, then:\n\n∮C f(z) dz = 0\n\nNow, let's consider the function f(z) = (z^2 + 2z)/(z + 2)^2. We need to check if this function is analytic in the domain containing the closed circular path C.\n\nThe function f(z) is a rational function, and it is analytic everywhere except at the points where the denominator is zero. In this case, the denominator is (z + 2)^2, which is zero only when z = -2. Since the circular path C is centered at the origin with radius 3, it contains the point z = -2. Therefore, Cauchy's theorem cannot be applied directly.\n\nHowever, we can use Cauchy's integral formula to evaluate the integral. Cauchy's integral formula states that for a function f(z) analytic in a domain D containing a closed contour C and a point a inside C:\n\nf(a) = (1/(2πi)) ∮C (f(z)/(z - a)) dz\n\nIn our case, we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 2z)/(z + 2)^2 = (z^2 + 2z - 4 + 4)/(z + 2)^2 = ((z - 2)(z + 2) + 4)/(z + 2)^2\n\nNow, let g(z) = (z - 2)(z + 2) + 4. The function g(z) is analytic everywhere, and we can apply Cauchy's integral formula to it:\n\ng(-2) = (1/(2πi)) ∮C (g(z)/(z - (-2))) dz\n\nSince g(-2) = (-2 - 2)(-2 + 2) + 4 = 4, we have:\n\n4 = (1/(2πi)) ∮C (g(z)/(z + 2)) dz\n\nNow, we can relate this back to the original integral:\n\n∮C f(z) dz = ∮C ((z - 2)(z + 2) + 4)/(z + 2)^2 dz = ∮C (g(z)/(z + 2)) dz\n\nUsing the result from Cauchy's integral formula, we get:\n\n∮C f(z) dz = 2πi * 4 = 8πi"
