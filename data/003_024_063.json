    "message_1": "A force vector of magnitude 40 N acts at an angle of 30 degrees with respect to the horizontal axis. What is the magnitude of the horizontal projection of the force vector?",
    "message_2": "To find the horizontal projection of the force vector, we can use the cosine function. The horizontal projection is given by:\n\nHorizontal projection = Magnitude of force vector × cos(angle)\n\nHere, the magnitude of the force vector is 40 N, and the angle is 30 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n30 degrees × (π/180) = (30 × π)/180 = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can find the horizontal projection:\n\nHorizontal projection = 40 N × cos(π/6)\nHorizontal projection ≈ 40 N × 0.866025\nHorizontal projection ≈ 34.641 N\n\nThe magnitude of the horizontal projection of the force vector is approximately 34.641 N."
