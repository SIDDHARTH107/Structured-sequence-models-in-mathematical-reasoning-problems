    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2, we need to find the first derivative of the function and set it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first try to factor it:\n\n3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0\n\n3(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nThe solutions are x = 1 and x = 3. These are the critical points of the function. Now, we need to check if these critical points are within the given interval [0, 5]:\n\n1 ∈ [0, 5] and 3 ∈ [0, 5]\n\nBoth critical points are within the interval, so the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 in the interval [0, 5] are x = 1 and x = 3."
