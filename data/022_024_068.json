    "message_2": "To find the temperature at the point (π/4, π/6), we need to substitute the values of x and y into the given temperature distribution function T(x,y).\n\nT(x,y) = 20 + 30*cos(2x)*sin(3y)\n\nLet x = π/4 and y = π/6:\n\nT(π/4, π/6) = 20 + 30*cos(2(π/4))*sin(3(π/6))\n\nT(π/4, π/6) = 20 + 30*cos(π/2)*sin(π/2)\n\nNow, we know that cos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π/2) = 1:\n\nT(π/4, π/6) = 20 + 30*0*1\n\nT(π/4, π/6) = 20 + 0\n\nT(π/4, π/6) = 20\n\nSo, the temperature at the point (π/4, π/6) is 20°C."
