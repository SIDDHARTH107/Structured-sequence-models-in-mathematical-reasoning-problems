    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall and sliding down at a rate of 5 ft/s. Initially, the bottom of the ladder is 12 feet away from the wall and 16 feet long. What is the rate of change of the height of the top of the ladder when the bottom is 9 feet away from the wall? Using the product rule, differentiate the equation relating the height of the ladder to its distance from the wall.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance of the bottom of the ladder from the wall, and y be the height of the top of the ladder from the ground. The ladder, wall, and ground form a right triangle, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = L^2, where L is the length of the ladder (16 feet).\n\nWe are given that dx/dt = -5 ft/s (negative because the bottom of the ladder is moving away from the wall). We want to find dy/dt when x = 9 feet.\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of y when x = 9 feet. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n9^2 + y^2 = 16^2\n81 + y^2 = 256\ny^2 = 175\ny = √175\n\nNow, we will differentiate the equation x^2 + y^2 = L^2 with respect to time t:\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = d(L^2)/dt\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0 (since the length of the ladder is constant)\n\nNow, plug in the given values and solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(9)(-5) + 2(√175)(dy/dt) = 0\n-90 + 2(√175)(dy/dt) = 0\n\nSolve for dy/dt:\n\n2(√175)(dy/dt) = 90\ndy/dt = 90 / (2(√175))\ndy/dt = 45 / √175\ndy/dt ≈ -3 ft/s\n\nSo, the rate of change of the height of the top of the ladder when the bottom is 9 feet away from the wall is approximately -3 ft/s (negative because the top of the ladder is moving downward)."
