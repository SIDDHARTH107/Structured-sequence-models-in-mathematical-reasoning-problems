    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = x^2 - 2x + 1 at the point where x = 3, we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 3.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 - 2x + 1.\n\nThe derivative of the function with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = 2x - 2\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the derivative at x = 3:\n\ndy/dx (3) = 2(3) - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 3 is 4."
