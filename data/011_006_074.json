    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the generating functions method. Let's represent each number in the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 10} as a variable x raised to the power of that number. The generating function for this set is:\n\nG(x) = x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + ... + x^10\n\nNow, we want to find the coefficient of x^15 in the expansion of G(x)^3, as this will represent the number of ways to select 3 numbers from the set such that their sum is 15.\n\nG(x)^3 = (x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + ... + x^10)^3\n\nExpanding G(x)^3, we are looking for the coefficient of x^15. We can do this by finding the possible combinations of terms that multiply to x^15:\n\n1. x^1 * x^5 * x^9\n2. x^2 * x^4 * x^9\n3. x^3 * x^4 * x^8\n4. x^3 * x^5 * x^7\n5. x^4 * x^5 * x^6\n\nNow, let's count the number of ways each combination can be formed:\n\n1. x^1 * x^5 * x^9: There is only 1 way to form this combination.\n2. x^2 * x^4 * x^9: There is only 1 way to form this combination.\n3. x^3 * x^4 * x^8: There is only 1 way to form this combination.\n4. x^3 * x^5 * x^7: There is only 1 way to form this combination.\n5. x^4 * x^5 * x^6: There are 3! = 6 ways to form this combination (since each term is distinct).\n\nAdding up the number of ways for each combination, we get:\n\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 ways to select 3 numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 10} such that their sum is 15."
