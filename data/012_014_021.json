    "message_2": "To determine if the given pair of graphs are isomorphic or not, we need to check if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of the two graphs such that the adjacency relationship is preserved. In other words, if two vertices are adjacent in Graph A, their corresponding vertices in Graph B should also be adjacent, and vice versa.\n\nSince both Graph A and Graph B have the same number of vertices (5), the same number of edges (7), and no isolated vertices, they have the same basic structure. However, this information alone is not enough to conclude that they are isomorphic. We need more information about the specific connections between the vertices in each graph.\n\nIf you can provide the adjacency matrix or adjacency list for each graph, we can further analyze the graphs and determine if they are isomorphic or not.\n\nIn summary, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude if Graph A and Graph B are isomorphic or not. Additional information about the specific connections between vertices is needed to make a determination."
