Find the equation of the unique line passing through two points $P_1=(1,1)$ and $P_2=(-1,-1)$ on $C$.\n\nHint: Use the fact that $C$ is birationally equivalent to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the unique line passing through two points $P_1=(1,1)$ and $P_2=(-1,-1)$ on the curve $C$, we can use the point-slope form of a line equation, which is given by:\n\n$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$,\n\nwhere $(x_1, y_1)$ is one of the points on the line and $m$ is the slope of the line.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope $m$ using the two points $P_1$ and $P_2$:\n\n$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{-1 - 1}{-1 - 1} = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1$.\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope form with $P_1$ as $(x_1, y_1)$ and $m = 1$:\n\n$y - 1 = 1(x - 1)$.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$y = x$.\n\nSo, the equation of the unique line passing through the points $P_1$ and $P_2$ on the curve $C$ is $y = x$."
