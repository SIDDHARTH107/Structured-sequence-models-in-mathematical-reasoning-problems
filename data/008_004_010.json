    "message_2": "We will use the elimination method to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation, and multiply the first equation by -1 and add it to the third equation.\n\nFirst equation * 2:\n4x - 2y - 2z = 0\n\nSubtract the first equation * 2 from the second equation:\n(4x - 3y + z) - (4x - 2y - 2z) = 0\ny + 3z = 0 (1)\n\nFirst equation * -1:\n-2x + y + z = 0\n\nAdd the first equation * -1 to the third equation:\n(x + 5y - 2z) + (-2x + y + z) = 0\n-x + 6y - z = 0 (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\ny + 3z = 0 (1)\n- x + 6y - z = 0 (2)\n\nWe can eliminate y from these two equations by multiplying the first equation by 6 and adding it to the second equation:\n\nFirst equation * 6:\n6y + 18z = 0\n\nAdd the first equation * 6 to the second equation:\n(-x + 6y - z) + (6y + 18z) = 0\n-x + 12y + 17z = 0 (3)\n\nNow we have a single equation with two variables (y and z):\n\n12y + 17z = x (3)\n\nSince this is a homogeneous system of linear equations, we can express the variables in terms of a parameter, let's call it t:\n\ny = 3t (4)\nz = -t (5)\n\nSubstitute these expressions for y and z into equation (3):\n\n12(3t) + 17(-t) = x\n36t - 17t = x\n19t = x (6)\n\nNow we have the general solution for the system of homogeneous linear equations in terms of the parameter t:\n\nx = 19t\ny = 3t\nz = -t\n\nThis represents an infinite number of solutions, depending on the value of t."
