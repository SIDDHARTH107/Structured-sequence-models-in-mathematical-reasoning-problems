    "message_1": "A committee of 4 members will be formed from a group of 10 individuals. How many different committees are possible if the committee must have at least two women, but the chairman of the committee must always be a man? \n\nUse Catalan numbers to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Catalan numbers, we will first count the number of ways to form a committee without the restriction on the chairman being a man, and then subtract the number of ways where the chairman is a woman.\n\nLet's consider the group of 10 individuals as 5 men (M) and 5 women (W). We want to form a committee of 4 members with at least 2 women.\n\nWe can represent the committee formation as a sequence of M's and W's, where the first position is the chairman, and the remaining positions are the other members. For example, MWWM represents a committee with a male chairman, one man, and two women.\n\nUsing Catalan numbers, we can count the number of ways to form a committee without the restriction on the chairman being a man. The Catalan numbers are defined as:\n\nC_n = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n)\n\nWe can think of the committee formation as a sequence of balanced parentheses, where M represents an open parenthesis and W represents a close parenthesis. A sequence of balanced parentheses has an equal number of open and close parentheses, and for any prefix of the sequence, the number of open parentheses is greater than or equal to the number of close parentheses.\n\nFor a committee of 4 members with at least 2 women, we can have the following balanced sequences:\n\n1. MWWM\n2. MWMW\n3. MMWW\n\nThere are 3 balanced sequences, which corresponds to the Catalan number C_2:\n\nC_2 = (1/3) * (4 choose 2) = (1/3) * 6 = 2\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the number of committees, as we have included the case where the chairman is a woman. To correct for this, we need to subtract the number of ways where the chairman is a woman.\n\nIf the chairman is a woman, we have the following balanced sequences:\n\n1. WMWM\n2. WMMW\n\nThere are 2 balanced sequences with a female chairman.\n\nNow, we can find the number of committees with a male chairman by subtracting the number of committees with a female chairman from the total number of committees:\n\n3 (total committees) - 2 (committees with a female chairman) = 1 (committee with a male chairman)\n\nHowever, this only accounts for the balanced sequences. We need to consider the actual number of people involved. For the single balanced sequence with a male chairman (MMWW), we have:\n\n- 5 choices for the male chairman (since there are 5 men)\n- 4 choices for the other man (since there are 4 men left)\n- 5 choices for the first woman (since there are 5 women)\n- 4 choices for the second woman (since there are 4 women left)\n\nSo, the total number of committees with a male chairman and at least 2 women is:\n\n5 (male chairman) * 4 (other man) * 5 (first woman) * 4 (second woman) = 400\n\nTherefore, there are 400 different committees possible with a male chairman and at least 2 women."
