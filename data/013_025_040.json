    "message_1": "Here's a question for the math student to solve:\n\nIn the Traveler's Dilemma game, two travelers are asked to choose a number between 2 and 100. The traveler who chooses the lower number will receive the amount that was chosen as the prize, and the other traveler will receive the same amount plus a bonus of $2. If both travelers choose the same number, they will each receive that amount as the prize. What number should you choose to maximize your winnings, assuming the other player is also trying to maximize their winnings?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the Traveler's Dilemma game using game theory. We will use backward induction to find the optimal strategy for both players.\n\nFirst, consider the case where both players can only choose between 99 and 100. If player A chooses 99, they will receive $99, and player B will receive $101. If player A chooses 100, both players will receive $100. Therefore, player A should choose 99 to maximize their winnings.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where both players can choose between 98, 99, and 100. If player A chooses 98, they will receive $98, and player B will receive $100. If player A chooses 99, they know that player B will choose 98 to maximize their winnings, so player A will receive $100. If player A chooses 100, both players will receive $100. Therefore, player A should choose 99 in this case as well.\n\nContinuing this logic, we can see that the optimal strategy for both players is to choose the lowest possible number, which is 2. So, you should choose 2 to maximize your winnings, assuming the other player is also trying to maximize their winnings."
