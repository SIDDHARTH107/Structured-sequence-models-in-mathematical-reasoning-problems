    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the distance from the student to the base of the building (adjacent side) is 15 meters, and we want to find the height of the building (opposite side).\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 15\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3:\n\n√3 = height / 15\n\nNow, we can solve for the height by multiplying both sides of the equation by 15:\n\nheight = 15 * √3\n\nheight ≈ 15 * 1.732\n\nheight ≈ 25.98 meters\n\nThe height of the building is approximately 25.98 meters."
