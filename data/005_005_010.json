    "message_2": "To find the probability of rolling a 5 or a 6 on a fair six-sided die, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nThere are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). There are 2 favorable outcomes (rolling a 5 or a 6).\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 5 or a 6 is:\n\nProbability = 2/6 = 1/3 â‰ˆ 0.3333\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a 5 or a 6 on a single fair six-sided die is approximately 0.3333 or 33.33%."
