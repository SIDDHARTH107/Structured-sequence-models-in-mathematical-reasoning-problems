    "message_1": "In a certain region, the probability of a flood occurring during the month of June is 0.35. If 8 independent June months are selected at random, what is the probability that a flood will occur exactly 3 times?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of June months), k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of floods), p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a flood occurring), and (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nIn this problem, we have n = 8, k = 3, and p = 0.35. First, we need to find (8 choose 3):\n\n(8 choose 3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!)\n= 8! / (3! * 5!)\n= (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n= (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n= 336 / 6\n= 56\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = (8 choose 3) * 0.35^3 * (1 - 0.35)^(8-3)\n= 56 * 0.35^3 * 0.65^5\n= 56 * 0.042875 * 0.1160290625\nâ‰ˆ 0.276\n\nSo, the probability that a flood will occur exactly 3 times in 8 independent June months is approximately 0.276 or 27.6%."
