The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {2}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and C, which is represented by (A ∩ B) x C. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set.\n\n(A ∩ B) x C = {(2, 0)}\n\nSo, the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and C is {(2, 0)}."
