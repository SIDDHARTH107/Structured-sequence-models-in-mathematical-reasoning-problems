    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define a universal set U that contains all the elements under consideration. Let's assume U is the set of integers from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNow, the complement of set A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A. Therefore, A' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNext, we need to find the intersection of set A and its complement A'. The intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no elements that are common to both A and A', as A contains the integers from 1 to 5 and A' contains the integers from 6 to 10.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of set A and its complement A' is an empty set, denoted by âˆ….\n\nThis result is consistent with the principles of set theory, as the intersection of a set and its complement should always be an empty set. This is because the complement of a set contains all the elements that are not in the original set, so there can be no elements in common between the two sets."
