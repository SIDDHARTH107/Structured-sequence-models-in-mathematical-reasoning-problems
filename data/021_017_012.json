    "message_2": "Differential Evolution (DE) is a numerical optimization algorithm that is not easily solvable by hand. However, I can provide you with a general outline of the steps involved in the DE algorithm, and you can then implement it in a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, MATLAB, etc.) to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 5x^2 - 2x + 1.\n\n1. Initialize the population: Generate 20 random values for x within a reasonable range (e.g., -10 to 10) to create the initial population.\n\n2. For each iteration (up to 100 iterations):\n   a. For each individual in the population:\n      i. Select three distinct individuals from the population randomly, say a, b, and c.\n      ii. Create a mutant vector by adding the scaled difference between b and c to a: mutant = a + 0.5 * (b - c).\n      iii. Perform crossover between the mutant vector and the current individual with a probability of 0.8 to create a trial vector.\n      iv. Evaluate the fitness of the trial vector using the function f(x).\n      v. If the trial vector's fitness is better than the current individual's fitness, replace the current individual with the trial vector.\n\n3. After 100 iterations, find the individual with the best fitness (i.e., the minimum value of f(x)) in the final population.\n\nBy following these steps and implementing the DE algorithm in a programming language, you can find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 5x^2 - 2x + 1 using the given parameters."
