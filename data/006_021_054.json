    "message_1": "A certain region has a 20% chance of experiencing a thunderstorm on any given day. What is the probability that the region will have thunderstorms on exactly 3 out of the next 5 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (thunderstorms) in n trials (days)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (thunderstorm) on any given day (20% or 0.2)\n- n is the number of trials (days) (5 in this case)\n- k is the number of successes (thunderstorms) we want to find the probability for (3 in this case)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(5, 3), which is the number of ways to choose 3 thunderstorm days out of 5 days:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\nC(5, 3) = 120 / (6 * 2)\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * 0.2^3 * (1-0.2)^(5-3)\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.008 * 0.8^2\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.008 * 0.64\nP(X = 3) = 0.0512\n\nSo, the probability that the region will have thunderstorms on exactly 3 out of the next 5 days is approximately 5.12%."
