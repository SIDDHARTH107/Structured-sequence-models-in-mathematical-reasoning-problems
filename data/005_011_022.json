    "message_1": "In an experimental design, a group of researchers recorded the number of hours of sleep per night for a sample of 20 college students. The data for the number of hours of sleep were as follows:\n6.5, 7, 6, 5.5, 6, 5, 7.5, 6, 6.5, 5.5, 6, 5.5, 6, 7, 6.5, 5.5, 6, 7, 6, 5.5.\n\nCalculate the sample mean and sample standard deviation of hours of sleep for the sample of 20 college students.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the sample mean, we need to add up all the values and divide by the number of values (20 in this case). \n\nMean = (6.5 + 7 + 6 + 5.5 + 6 + 5 + 7.5 + 6 + 6.5 + 5.5 + 6 + 5.5 + 6 + 7 + 6.5 + 5.5 + 6 + 7 + 6 + 5.5) / 20\n\nMean = (122.5) / 20\n\nMean = 6.125 hours\n\nTo calculate the sample standard deviation, we first need to find the variance. The variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. \n\n1. Calculate the differences from the mean for each value:\n[-0.375, 0.875, -0.125, -0.625, -0.125, -1.125, 1.375, -0.125, 0.375, -0.625, -0.125, -0.625, -0.125, 0.875, 0.375, -0.625, -0.125, 0.875, -0.125, -0.625]\n\n2. Square the differences:\n[0.140625, 0.765625, 0.015625, 0.390625, 0.015625, 1.265625, 1.890625, 0.015625, 0.140625, 0.390625, 0.015625, 0.390625, 0.015625, 0.765625, 0.140625, 0.390625, 0.015625, 0.765625, 0.015625, 0.390625]\n\n3. Calculate the average of the squared differences:\nSum = 7.625\nVariance = Sum / (n - 1) = 7.625 / (20 - 1) = 7.625 / 19 = 0.401315789\n\n4. Take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation:\nStandard Deviation = âˆš0.401315789 = 0.633523289\n\nSo, the sample mean is 6.125 hours, and the sample standard deviation is approximately 0.634 hours."
