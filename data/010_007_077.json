    "message_2": "To determine whether $Y$ is connected or disconnected, we will use the properties of covering spaces and the fundamental group.\n\nRecall that if $p: Y \\rightarrow X$ is a covering map, then the fiber $p^{-1}(x_0)$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of homomorphisms from $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ to the group of deck transformations $G$ of the covering, i.e., $\\text{Hom}(\\pi_1(X, x_0), G)$. \n\nSince $\\pi_1(X, x_0) = \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, we need to find the number of homomorphisms from $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ to $G$. The number of such homomorphisms will determine the number of connected components in the fiber $p^{-1}(x_0)$, and hence the connectedness of $Y$.\n\nLet $n$ be the order of $G$. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, any homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ to $G$ is determined by the image of the generator $1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. Since the order of the image of $1$ must divide both $6$ and $n$, there are at most $\\gcd(6, n)$ choices for the image of $1$. Therefore, there are at most $\\gcd(6, n)$ homomorphisms from $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ to $G$.\n\nNow, we have two cases to consider:\n\n1. If $n = 1$, then $G$ is the trivial group, and there is only one homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ to $G$. In this case, the fiber $p^{-1}(x_0)$ has only one connected component, and hence $Y$ is connected.\n\n2. If $n > 1$, then $\\gcd(6, n) > 1$, and there are at least two homomorphisms from $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ to $G$. In this case, the fiber $p^{-1}(x_0)$ has at least two connected components, and hence $Y$ is disconnected.\n\nIn conclusion, $Y$ can be either connected or disconnected, depending on the group of deck transformations $G$."
