    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 60, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. \n\nLet's find the Sylow subgroups for each prime factor:\n\n1. For the prime factor 2, the Sylow 2-subgroups have order 2^2 = 4. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 60/4 = 15, and n_2 must be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. \n\n2. For the prime factor 3, the Sylow 3-subgroups have order 3. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 60/3 = 20, and n_3 must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 10.\n\n3. For the prime factor 5, the Sylow 5-subgroups have order 5. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 60/5 = 12, and n_5 must be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 6.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then there is only one Sylow subgroup for each prime factor, and the group is the direct product of these subgroups, which is a cyclic group of order 60. This group is abelian, so we discard this case.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, and the group is a semi-direct product of a normal Sylow 2-subgroup and the unique Sylow 3-subgroup and Sylow 5-subgroup. This gives us one non-abelian group, which is the symmetric group S_3 × Z_5, also known as the Frobenius group of order 60.\n\n3. If n_2 = 5, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then there are five Sylow 2-subgroups, but this case is not possible because there are only four elements of order 2 in the group, and each Sylow 2-subgroup must contain an element of order 2.\n\n4. If n_2 = 15, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then there are fifteen Sylow 2-subgroups, but this case is also not possible because there are only fourteen elements of order 2 in the group.\n\n5. If n_2 = 3, n_3 = 10, and n_5 = 1, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and ten Sylow 3-subgroups. This gives us another non-abelian group, which is the alternating group A_5.\n\nSo, there are two non-abelian groups of order 60: the Frobenius group of order 60 (S_3 × Z_5) and the alternating group A_5."
