Graph the line on a coordinate plane with x values ranging from -10 to 10. What is the slope of the line? Where does the line intersect the y-axis?",
    "message_2": "To graph the line y = 1/2x + 3 on a coordinate plane with x values ranging from -10 to 10, we can start by finding the y values corresponding to each x value. Here are some points on the line:\n\nx = -10: y = 1/2(-10) + 3 = -5 + 3 = -2, so the point (-10, -2)\nx = -5: y = 1/2(-5) + 3 = -2.5 + 3 = 0.5, so the point (-5, 0.5)\nx = 0: y = 1/2(0) + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3, so the point (0, 3)\nx = 5: y = 1/2(5) + 3 = 2.5 + 3 = 5.5, so the point (5, 5.5)\nx = 10: y = 1/2(10) + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8, so the point (10, 8)\n\nNow, plot these points on the coordinate plane and connect them with a straight line.\n\nThe slope of the line is the coefficient of x in the equation, which is 1/2. This means that for every 1 unit increase in x, y increases by 1/2.\n\nThe line intersects the y-axis when x = 0. In this case, y = 1/2(0) + 3 = 3. So, the line intersects the y-axis at the point (0, 3)."
