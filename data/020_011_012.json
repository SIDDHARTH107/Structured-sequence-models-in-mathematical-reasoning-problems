    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products A and B. The profit per unit of A is $10 and that of B is $20. The production process requires two machines M1 and M2. One unit of A requires 2 hours on machine M1 and 1 hour on machine M2. One unit of B requires 1 hour on machine M1 and 2 hours on machine M2. Machine M1 is available for a maximum of 120 hours and machine M2 is available for a maximum of 100 hours. Determine the production quantities of A and B that maximize the total profit while satisfying the time restrictions.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total profit is:\nP = 10x + 20y\n\nThe constraints for the available hours on machines M1 and M2 are:\n2x + y ≤ 120 (M1 constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 100 (M2 constraint)\n\nAdditionally, we have the non-negativity constraints:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. For the M1 constraint, we have y ≤ 120 - 2x.\n2. For the M2 constraint, we have y ≤ (100 - x)/2.\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both constraints are satisfied. The vertices of the feasible region are (0,0), (0,50), (40,30), and (60,0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 10(0) + 20(0) = $0\n2. P(0,50) = 10(0) + 20(50) = $1000\n3. P(40,30) = 10(40) + 20(30) = $1000\n4. P(60,0) = 10(60) + 20(0) = $600\n\nThe maximum total profit is $1000, which occurs when producing 40 units of product A and 30 units of product B."
