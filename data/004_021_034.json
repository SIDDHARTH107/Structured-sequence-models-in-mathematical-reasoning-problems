    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x - 3, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x).\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d/dx (4x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x - 3)\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 10x + 2\n\nNow, we find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx (12x^2 - 10x + 2)\nf''(x) = 24x - 10\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x - 3 is f''(x) = 24x - 10."
