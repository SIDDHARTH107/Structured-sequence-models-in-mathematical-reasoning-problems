    "message_2": "To find the fair price of the option, we will use the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) equation. The BSM equation for a call option is given by:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC = the fair price of the call option\nS = the current stock price\nX = the strike price of the option\nT = the time to maturity (in years)\nr = the risk-free interest rate\nN(d1) and N(d2) = the cumulative normal distribution function values for d1 and d2\ne = the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nwhere:\nσ = the implied volatility\nln = the natural logarithm\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\nS = 100\nX = 110\nT = 0.5 (6 months = 0.5 years)\nr = 0.05\nσ = 0.20\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.05 + (0.20^2)/2) * 0.5) / (0.20 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 = (-0.0953 + (0.05 + 0.02) * 0.5) / (0.20 * 0.7071)\nd1 = (-0.0953 + 0.035) / 0.1414\nd1 = -0.4272\n\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nd2 = -0.4272 - 0.20 * 0.7071\nd2 = -0.4272 - 0.1414\nd2 = -0.5686\n\nNow, we need to find the cumulative normal distribution function values for d1 and d2:\n\nN(d1) = N(-0.4272) = 0.3349\nN(d2) = N(-0.5686) = 0.2849\n\nFinally, we can calculate the fair price of the option using the BSM equation:\n\nC = 100 * 0.3349 - 110 * e^(-0.05 * 0.5) * 0.2849\nC = 33.49 - 110 * 0.9753 * 0.2849\nC = 33.49 - 110 * 0.2785\nC = 33.49 - 30.64\n\nC = 2.85\n\nSo, the fair price of the option is $2.85."
