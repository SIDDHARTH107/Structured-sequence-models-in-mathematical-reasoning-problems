    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C96 or the group A4 × C4 × C2, we will first analyze the Sylow subgroups of G. Recall that the order of G is 96, which can be factored as 2^5 * 3. By Sylow's Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 2^5 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce that n_2 ∈ {1, 3} and n_3 ∈ {1, 4}. \n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Since both P and Q are normal in G, their product PQ is also normal in G. Moreover, since |P| = 2^5 and |Q| = 3, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 2^5 * 3 = 96, which implies that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ C_2^5 × C_3. Since C_2^5 × C_3 is a cyclic group of order 96, G is isomorphic to C96 in this case.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G and Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since n_2 = 3, P is not normal in G. However, since n_3 = 4, Q is normal in G. \n\nNow, let's consider the semidirect product of P and Q, denoted as P ⋊ Q. Since |P| = 2^5 and |Q| = 3, we have |P ⋊ Q| = |P| * |Q| = 2^5 * 3 = 96. Thus, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product P ⋊ Q. \n\nBy analyzing the possible actions of Q on P, we can show that G is isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2 in this case. \n\nTherefore, if G is a group of order 96, it must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C96 or the group A4 × C4 × C2.\n\nIf G is non-isomorphic to either of these groups, it must be one of the 196 possible non-abelian groups of order 96. However, a complete classification of these groups is beyond the scope of this answer and would require a more in-depth analysis using tools such as the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem and the classification of finite simple groups."
