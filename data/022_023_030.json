Assume that at $t=0$, we have $u(x,0) = \\cos(x)$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$. Solve for $u(x,t)$ using complex analysis techniques. Find $u(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},2)$.",
    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T''(t) = 4X''(x)T(t)$$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 4\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$$\n\nSince the left side is a function of $t$ only and the right side is a function of $x$ only, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 4\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$T''(t) = -\\lambda^2 T(t)$$\n$$X''(x) = -\\frac{\\lambda^2}{4} X(x)$$\n\nThe general solution for the second equation is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(\\frac{\\lambda}{2}x) + B\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda}{2}x)$$\n\nApplying the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\cos(x)$, we get:\n\n$$X(x) = \\cos(x)$$\n\nNow, we need to find the general solution for the first equation. Since the equation is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients, the general solution is:\n\n$$T(t) = C\\cos(\\lambda t) + D\\sin(\\lambda t)$$\n\nApplying the initial condition $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$, we get:\n\n$$-\\lambda\\sin(\\lambda t) = 0$$\n\nSince $\\sin(\\lambda t) = 0$ for $t=0$, we can conclude that $D=0$. Therefore, the solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$$T(t) = C\\cos(\\lambda t)$$\n\nNow, we have the solution for $u(x,t)$:\n\n$$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t) = \\cos(x)\\cos(\\lambda t)$$\n\nSince we have the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\cos(x)$, we can conclude that $\\lambda = 1$ and $C=1$. Therefore, the solution for $u(x,t)$ is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\cos(x)\\cos(t)$$\n\nNow, we can find $u(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},2)$:\n\n$$u(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},2) = \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{2})\\cos(2) = 0 \\cdot \\cos(2) = 0$$"
