    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal (d) of a rectangular prism can be found using the formula:\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height of the prism.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we have:\n\nl = 8 cm\nw = 6 cm\nh = 4 cm\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nd = √(8² + 6² + 4²)\nd = √(64 + 36 + 16)\nd = √116\nd ≈ 10.77 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 10.77 cm."
