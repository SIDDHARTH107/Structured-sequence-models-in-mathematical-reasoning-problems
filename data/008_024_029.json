    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second and third equations are just multiples of the first equation. Specifically, the second equation is 2 times the first equation, and the third equation is 3 times the first equation. This means that the three equations are not independent, and the system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two. Let's solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 10 - 2y - 3z\n\nNow we have x in terms of y and z. We can write the general solution as:\n\nx = 10 - 2y - 3z\ny = y\nz = z\n\nwhere y and z can be any real numbers."
