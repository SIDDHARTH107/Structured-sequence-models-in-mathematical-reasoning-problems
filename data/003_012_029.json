    "message_2": "To calculate the angle of depression from the top of the building to the same point on the ground, we can use the tangent function in a right triangle. Let's call the angle of depression θ.\n\nWe know that the building is 200 meters tall and the point on the ground is 50 meters away from the base of the building. This forms a right triangle with the building's height as the opposite side (O), the distance from the base as the adjacent side (A), and the line connecting the top of the building to the point on the ground as the hypotenuse (H).\n\nWe can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation (35 degrees) to the sides of the triangle:\n\ntan(35) = O/A = 200/x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 200/tan(35) ≈ 114.28 meters\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can use the tangent function again to find the angle of depression (θ):\n\ntan(θ) = A/O = 114.28/200\n\nθ = arctan(114.28/200) ≈ 29.74 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of depression from the top of the building to the same point on the ground is approximately 29.74 degrees."
