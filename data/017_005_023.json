    "message_2": "Since G has order 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G, denoted by n_3, satisfies:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 27\n\nThe possible values for n_3 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. However, since n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3), we can eliminate 3 and 9 as possibilities. \n\nIf n_3 = 1, then there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal. Let P be this normal Sylow 3-subgroup. Since P has order 3^3, it is a cyclic group of order 27. Therefore, G is cyclic in this case.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when n_3 = 27. In this case, there are 27 Sylow 3-subgroups, each of order 9. Let P be one of these Sylow 3-subgroups. Since the index of P in G is 3, which is the smallest prime dividing the order of G, P is normal in G by the Normalizer/Centralizer theorem.\n\nNow, let Q be another Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since P and Q are both normal in G, their intersection, P ∩ Q, is also normal in G. Moreover, since P and Q have order 9, their intersection must have order 3 (by Lagrange's theorem). Let Z be the center of G. Since G is a p-group, Z is nontrivial. Thus, Z must have order 3 or 9.\n\nIf Z has order 9, then G/Z has order 3, which implies that G is a cyclic group of order 27. This case is already covered.\n\nIf Z has order 3, then Z = P ∩ Q. Let H = PQ. Since P and Q are both normal in G, H is also normal in G. Moreover, the order of H is |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 9 * 9 / 3 = 27. Thus, H = G. Since P and Q are both abelian (as they are groups of order 9), their direct product, H, is also abelian. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 (Z) and a group of order 9 (P).\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
