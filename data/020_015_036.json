    "message_1": "A farmer has 1000 meters of fencing available and wants to enclose a rectangular pasture along a river bank. The river will be one side of the rectangle. What is the maximum area that can be enclosed?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the fence parallel to the river be x meters, and the length of the two other sides be y meters each. Since the river forms one side of the rectangle, we only need to use the fencing for the other three sides. Therefore, the total fencing used is x + 2y = 1000 meters.\n\nWe want to maximize the area of the enclosed rectangle, which is given by A = xy.\n\nFrom the fencing equation, we can express y in terms of x: y = (1000 - x) / 2.\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the area equation: A = x((1000 - x) / 2).\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to x and set it to 0:\n\ndA/dx = (1000 - x) / 2 - x/2 = 0.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n1000 - x = x\nx = 500.\n\nNow, substitute x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (1000 - 500) / 2\ny = 250.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle that maximize the area are 500 meters parallel to the river and 250 meters perpendicular to the river. The maximum area that can be enclosed is:\n\nA = xy = 500 * 250 = 125,000 square meters."
