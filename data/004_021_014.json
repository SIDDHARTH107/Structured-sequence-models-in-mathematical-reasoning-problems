    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function, we first need to find the first derivative, and then differentiate it once more.\n\nThe given function is f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx(x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 2)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 4\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx(3x^2 - 6x + 4)\nf''(x) = 6x - 6\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative at x = 2:\nf''(2) = 6(2) - 6\nf''(2) = 12 - 6\nf''(2) = 6\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 2 at x = 2 is 6."
