    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem regarding Stag Hunt for a math student to solve:\n\nIn a group of 10 people, 5 individuals prefer to hunt stag while the remaining 5 prefer to hunt hare. Each person hunts alone, but the stag requires the cooperation of two hunters to be captured. If a stag is hunted, each participant gets a payoff of 2 units; if a hare is hunted, each participant gets a payoff of 1 unit regardless of the number of hunters. \n\na) What is the Nash equilibrium of this game?\nb) What is the Pareto efficient outcome? \nc) Is the Pareto efficient outcome also the Nash equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "a) The Nash equilibrium of this game occurs when no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the strategies of the other players. In this case, there are two Nash equilibria: \n1) All 5 stag hunters pair up and hunt stags, while the 5 hare hunters hunt hares. The stag hunters get a payoff of 2 units each (total of 10 units), and the hare hunters get a payoff of 1 unit each (total of 5 units).\n2) All 10 hunters hunt hares, and each gets a payoff of 1 unit (total of 10 units).\n\nb) The Pareto efficient outcome is the one where no player can improve their payoff without making another player worse off. In this case, the Pareto efficient outcome is when all 5 stag hunters pair up and hunt stags, while the 5 hare hunters hunt hares. The stag hunters get a payoff of 2 units each (total of 10 units), and the hare hunters get a payoff of 1 unit each (total of 5 units).\n\nc) The Pareto efficient outcome is also one of the Nash equilibria in this game. When all 5 stag hunters pair up and hunt stags, while the 5 hare hunters hunt hares, no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the strategies of the other players."
