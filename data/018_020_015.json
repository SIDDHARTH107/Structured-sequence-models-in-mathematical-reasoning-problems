    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}, find the symmetric difference of A and B, and then find the union of the result with the set C = {3, 4, 5}.

    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the result with the set C:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ C = {1, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5} = {1, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of this union with the set D:\n\n((A ∆ B) ∪ C) ∆ D = ({1, 3, 4, 5} ∪ {1, 2, 3, 4}) - ({1, 3, 4, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4})\n\n({1, 3, 4, 5} ∪ {1, 2, 3, 4}) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n({1, 3, 4, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4}) = {1, 3, 4}\n\n(({1, 3, 4, 5} ∪ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) - ({1, 3, 4, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4})) = {2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the original sets A and B with D:\n\n(A ∪ B) ∆ D = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) ∆ {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\n(A ∪ B) ∆ D = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∆ {1, 2, 3, 4} = {2, 5}\n\nThe result of both operations is {2, 5}, so the result is equal to the symmetric difference of the original sets A and B with D."
