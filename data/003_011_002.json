    "message_1": "A lighthouse is located 500 feet away from a shore. A boat is sailing towards the shore and spots the lighthouse at an angle of depression of 25 degrees. What is the height of the lighthouse?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The angle of depression from the boat to the lighthouse is 25 degrees, which means the angle of elevation from the shore to the top of the lighthouse is also 25 degrees. We can set up a right triangle with the lighthouse as the opposite side, the distance from the shore to the lighthouse as the adjacent side, and the angle of elevation as 25 degrees.\n\nWe can use the tangent function as follows:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nIn this case:\n\ntan(25) = height of lighthouse / 500 feet\n\nTo find the height of the lighthouse, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nheight of lighthouse = tan(25) * 500 feet\n\nNow, we can calculate the height:\n\nheight of lighthouse ≈ 0.4663 * 500 feet\nheight of lighthouse ≈ 233.15 feet\n\nThe height of the lighthouse is approximately 233.15 feet."
