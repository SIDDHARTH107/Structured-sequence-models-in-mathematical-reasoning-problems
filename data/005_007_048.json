    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r) between Hours studied (X) and Final exam grade (Y), we can use the following formula:\n\nr = [n * Σ(xy) - Σx * Σy] / sqrt([n * Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2] * [n * Σ(y^2) - (Σy)^2])\n\nwhere n is the number of data points, Σ(xy) is the sum of the product of each x and y pair, Σx and Σy are the sums of x and y values, and Σ(x^2) and Σ(y^2) are the sums of the squared x and y values.\n\nFirst, let's find the necessary values:\n\nn = 10 (number of data points)\n\nΣx = 6 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 7 + 2 + 5 + 9 + 10 = 59\nΣy = 75 + 67 + 60 + 70 + 85 + 80 + 55 + 68 + 90 + 95 = 745\n\nΣ(xy) = (6*75) + (4*67) + (3*60) + (5*70) + (8*85) + (7*80) + (2*55) + (5*68) + (9*90) + (10*95) = 4500 + 268 + 180 + 350 + 680 + 560 + 110 + 340 + 810 + 950 = 5898\n\nΣ(x^2) = 6^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 = 36 + 16 + 9 + 25 + 64 + 49 + 4 + 25 + 81 + 100 = 409\n\nΣ(y^2) = 75^2 + 67^2 + 60^2 + 70^2 + 85^2 + 80^2 + 55^2 + 68^2 + 90^2 + 95^2 = 5625 + 4489 + 3600 + 4900 + 7225 + 6400 + 3025 + 4624 + 8100 + 9025 = 58013\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nr = [10 * 5898 - 59 * 745] / sqrt([10 * 409 - 59^2] * [10 * 58013 - 745^2])\n\nr = [58980 - 43955] / sqrt([4090 - 3481] * [580130 - 555025])\n\nr = [15025] / sqrt([609] * [25105])\n\nr = 15025 / (sqrt(15295845))\n\nr ≈ 15025 / 3910.21\n\nr ≈ 0.384\n\nThe correlation coefficient between Hours studied (X) and Final exam grade (Y) is approximately 0.384."
