    "message_2": "First, let's label the edges of the graph as follows:\n\n```\n     A --1-- B\n     |\\     /|\n     |  \\ /  |\n    6|   C   |2\n     |  / \\  |\n     |/     \\|\n     D --5-- E\n```\nHere, we have a complete graph on 4 vertices, denoted as K4. The Tutte polynomial of a graph G, T(G; x, y), can be computed using the recursive formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G-e; x, y) + T(G/e; x, y) if e is not a loop or a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = x * T(G-e; x, y) if e is a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = y * T(G-e; x, y) if e is a loop.\n\nIn our case, we don't have any loops or bridges, so we can use the first formula. We can also use the fact that the Tutte polynomial of a complete graph K_n is given by:\n\nT(K_n; x, y) = (x-1)^{n-1} + (x-1)^{n-2} * (y-1) + ... + (y-1)^{n-1}.\n\nFor our graph K4, we have:\n\nT(K4; x, y) = (x-1)^3 + (x-1)^2 * (y-1) + (x-1) * (y-1)^2 + (y-1)^3.\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is:\n\nT(K4; x, y) = (x-1)^3 + 3(x-1)^2(y-1) + 3(x-1)(y-1)^2 + (y-1)^3."
