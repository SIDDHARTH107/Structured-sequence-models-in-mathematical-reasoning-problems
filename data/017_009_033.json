    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2), we know that G is a p-group. According to the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. In this case, G can be either isomorphic to C9 or C3 × C3.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of elements of order 3 in G. By Cauchy's theorem, G must have an element of order 3. Let's denote this element as x, so x^3 = e (identity element). Then, the subgroup generated by x, denoted as <x>, has order 3 and is isomorphic to C3. Since the index of <x> in G is 3, which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G, <x> must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/<x>. Since the order of G is 9 and the order of <x> is 3, the order of G/<x> is 9/3 = 3. Thus, G/<x> is isomorphic to C3. \n\nBy the correspondence theorem, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the subgroups of G containing <x> and the subgroups of G/<x>. Since G/<x> is cyclic, it has only two subgroups: the trivial subgroup and itself. This means that G has only two subgroups containing <x>: <x> and G itself.\n\nSince there is no other subgroup of order 3 in G, we can conclude that G cannot be isomorphic to C3 × C3, as this group would have two distinct subgroups of order 3. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C9."
