    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative of the function $f(x,y,z)$, we first need to find its gradient. The gradient of $f$ is given by the vector of its partial derivatives with respect to each variable:\n\n$\\nabla f(x,y,z) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right)$\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(e^x + 3yz^2) = e^x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(e^x + 3yz^2) = 3z^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(e^x + 3yz^2) = 6yz$\n\nSo, the gradient of $f$ is:\n\n$\\nabla f(x,y,z) = (e^x, 3z^2, 6yz)$\n\nNow, we need to compute the exterior derivative of $f$ on the manifold $M$ defined by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$. The exterior derivative of a function on a manifold is given by the projection of its gradient onto the tangent space of the manifold at the given point.\n\nThe normal vector to the manifold $M$ at the point $(1,0,0)$ can be computed as the gradient of the defining equation of the manifold:\n\n$\\nabla (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (2x, 2y, 2z)$\n\nAt the point $(1,0,0)$, the normal vector is:\n\n$\\nabla (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)_{(1,0,0)} = (2, 0, 0)$\n\nNow, we need to project the gradient of $f$ onto the tangent space of $M$ at the point $(1,0,0)$. The tangent space is orthogonal to the normal vector, so we can compute the projection as follows:\n\n$\\text{proj}_{T_pM} \\nabla f(x,y,z) = \\nabla f(x,y,z) - \\frac{\\langle \\nabla f(x,y,z), \\nabla (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)_{(1,0,0)} \\rangle}{\\|\\nabla (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)_{(1,0,0)}\\|^2} \\nabla (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)_{(1,0,0)}$\n\nAt the point $(1,0,0)$, the gradient of $f$ is:\n\n$\\nabla f(1,0,0) = (e, 0, 0)$\n\nThe inner product of the gradients is:\n\n$\\langle \\nabla f(1,0,0), \\nabla (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)_{(1,0,0)} \\rangle = (e)(2) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) = 2e$\n\nThe squared norm of the normal vector is:\n\n$\\|\\nabla (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)_{(1,0,0)}\\|^2 = (2)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 = 4$\n\nNow, we can compute the projection:\n\n$\\text{proj}_{T_pM} \\nabla f(1,0,0) = (e, 0, 0) - \\frac{2e}{4}(2, 0, 0) = (e, 0, 0) - (e, 0, 0) = (0, 0, 0)$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of the function $f$ on the manifold $M$ at the point $(1,0,0)$ is the zero vector:\n\n$\\text{d}f_{(1,0,0)} = (0, 0, 0)$"
