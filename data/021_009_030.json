    "message_1": "A company produces a certain product that has variable production costs. The production cost can be expressed as C(x) = 2x^2 - 10x + 100 where x is the quantity produced. If the selling price is fixed at $75, what is the optimal quantity that the company should produce to maximize their profit using the gradient descent method?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal quantity (x) that maximizes the profit function P(x). The profit function can be expressed as the difference between the revenue function R(x) and the cost function C(x).\n\nSince the selling price is fixed at $75, the revenue function can be expressed as R(x) = 75x.\n\nNow, let's find the profit function P(x) = R(x) - C(x):\n\nP(x) = 75x - (2x^2 - 10x + 100)\nP(x) = -2x^2 + 85x - 100\n\nTo find the optimal quantity (x) that maximizes the profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. We can do this by finding the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and setting it to 0.\n\nP'(x) = dP(x)/dx = -4x + 85\n\nNow, let's set P'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n-4x + 85 = 0\n4x = 85\nx = 85/4\nx ≈ 21.25\n\nSince the quantity produced must be a whole number, we need to check the profit for x = 21 and x = 22 to determine the optimal quantity:\n\nP(21) = -2(21)^2 + 85(21) - 100 ≈ 775\nP(22) = -2(22)^2 + 85(22) - 100 ≈ 774\n\nThe profit is slightly higher when the company produces 21 units. Therefore, the optimal quantity that the company should produce to maximize their profit is 21 units."
