    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question on Traveler's Dilemma for a math student:\n \nOn a flight, two passengers A and B have identical suitcases. The airline offers them to play the Traveler's Dilemma game, where each passenger will independently decide on the amount they will declare of the value of their bag. The airline will then use the declared amount to determine the fee for any damages incurred during the flight. The passenger who declares the lower amount will receive a payoff equal to the declared amount, and the other passenger will receive the declared amount plus a bonus of $10. If both passengers declare the same amount, they will both receive that amount as their payoff.\n\nAssuming that the true value of the bags is between $45 and $60, what will each passenger declare to maximize their payoff?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their payoff, both passengers A and B should declare the lowest possible value within the given range, which is $45. Here's why:\n\nIf one of the passengers declares $60, the other passenger can declare $59 and receive a payoff of $69 ($59 + $10 bonus). However, if the second passenger declares $58, they would receive a payoff of $68 ($58 + $10 bonus), which is still better than declaring $60. This pattern continues all the way down to the lowest possible value of $45.\n\nIf both passengers declare $45, they will both receive a payoff of $45. If one of them tries to declare a lower value (e.g., $44), they would receive a payoff of $44, which is worse than declaring $45. Therefore, the best strategy for both passengers is to declare the lowest possible value of $45 to maximize their payoff."
