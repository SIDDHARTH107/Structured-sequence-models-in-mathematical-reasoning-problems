    "message_1": "A magician claims that they can successfully perform a magic trick with a probability of 0.75. If the magician will perform this trick 8 times in a row, what is the probability of successfully performing the trick at least 6 times?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of successfully performing the trick at least 6 times, we can calculate the probabilities of exactly 6, 7, and 8 successful performances and then add them together.\n\nWe will use the binomial probability formula: P(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x), where P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of success, and n is the number of trials.\n\nFor 6 successes:\nP(6) = C(8, 6) * (0.75)^6 * (1-0.75)^(8-6)\nP(6) = 28 * (0.75)^6 * (0.25)^2\n\nFor 7 successes:\nP(7) = C(8, 7) * (0.75)^7 * (1-0.75)^(8-7)\nP(7) = 8 * (0.75)^7 * (0.25)^1\n\nFor 8 successes:\nP(8) = C(8, 8) * (0.75)^8 * (1-0.75)^(8-8)\nP(8) = 1 * (0.75)^8 * (0.25)^0\n\nNow, we calculate the probabilities:\nP(6) ≈ 28 * 0.1780 * 0.0625 ≈ 0.3115\nP(7) ≈ 8 * 0.1334 * 0.25 ≈ 0.2230\nP(8) ≈ 1 * 0.1001 * 1 ≈ 0.1001\n\nFinally, we add the probabilities together:\nP(at least 6 successes) = P(6) + P(7) + P(8) ≈ 0.3115 + 0.2230 + 0.1001 ≈ 0.6346\n\nSo, the probability of successfully performing the trick at least 6 times is approximately 0.6346 or 63.46%."
