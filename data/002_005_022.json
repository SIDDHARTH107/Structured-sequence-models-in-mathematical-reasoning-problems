    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism? (Round your answer to the nearest hundredth if required)",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal (d) can be found using the formula:\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height of the rectangular prism.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we have:\n\nl = 8 cm\nw = 5 cm\nh = 3 cm\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nd = √((8 cm)² + (5 cm)² + (3 cm)²)\nd = √(64 cm² + 25 cm² + 9 cm²)\nd = √(98 cm²)\n\nThe diagonal is approximately equal to:\n\nd ≈ 9.90 cm (rounded to the nearest hundredth)"
