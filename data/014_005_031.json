    "message_1": "Consider the following scenario: Bob wants to digitally sign a message using a RSA signature scheme with n = 33 and d = 7, where n is the modulus and d is the private exponent. \n\nIf Bob's message m is 10, what would be the resulting digital signature created by Bob?",
    "message_2": "To create a digital signature using RSA, Bob needs to raise the message m to the power of his private exponent d, and then take the result modulo n. In this case, m = 10, d = 7, and n = 33.\n\nThe digital signature s can be calculated as follows:\n\ns = m^d mod n\ns = 10^7 mod 33\n\nCalculating 10^7:\n\n10^7 = 10000000\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 10000000 is divided by 33:\n\n10000000 mod 33 = 4\n\nSo, the digital signature s created by Bob is 4."
