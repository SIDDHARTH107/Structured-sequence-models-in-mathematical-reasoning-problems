    "message_2": "To partition a set of n distinct objects into non-empty subsets, we can use the Bell number. The Bell number B(n) is the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets.\n\nFor a set of 5 distinct objects, we need to find B(5). The Bell numbers can be computed using the following recurrence relation:\n\nB(n) = Î£ (from k=0 to n-1) C(n-1, k) * B(k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nUsing this formula, we can compute B(5):\n\nB(5) = C(4, 0) * B(0) + C(4, 1) * B(1) + C(4, 2) * B(2) + C(4, 3) * B(3) + C(4, 4) * B(4)\n\nWe know that B(0) = 1, B(1) = 1, B(2) = 2, B(3) = 5, and B(4) = 15. Now we can compute the binomial coefficients:\n\nC(4, 0) = 1\nC(4, 1) = 4\nC(4, 2) = 6\nC(4, 3) = 4\nC(4, 4) = 1\n\nNow we can calculate B(5):\n\nB(5) = 1 * 1 + 4 * 1 + 6 * 2 + 4 * 5 + 1 * 15\nB(5) = 1 + 4 + 12 + 20 + 15\nB(5) = 52\n\nSo there are 52 ways to partition a set of 5 distinct objects into non-empty subsets."
