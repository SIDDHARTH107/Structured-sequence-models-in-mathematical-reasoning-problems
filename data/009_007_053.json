The velocity of the water leaving the hole is 8 feet per second. Use Navier-Stokes equations to determine the rate at which the water level is decreasing.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Torricelli's Law, which is derived from the Navier-Stokes equations for this specific case. Torricelli's Law states that the speed of efflux of a fluid under the force of gravity through an orifice is v = sqrt(2gh), where v is the velocity of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2 or 32.2 ft/s^2), and h is the height of the fluid above the orifice.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given velocity of the water leaving the hole (8 ft/s) to the height of the water above the hole. Using Torricelli's Law:\n\nv = sqrt(2gh)\n8 ft/s = sqrt(2 * 32.2 ft/s^2 * h)\n64 ft^2/s^2 = 64.4 ft/s^2 * h\nh = 64 / 64.4\nh ≈ 0.994 ft\n\nNow we know that the height of the water above the hole is approximately 0.994 ft. Since the total height of the water in the tank is 12 ft, the effective height of the water column is 12 - 0.994 ≈ 11.006 ft.\n\nNext, we need to find the rate at which the water level is decreasing. To do this, we will use the principle of conservation of mass. The volume flow rate out of the hole must equal the rate at which the volume of the water in the tank is decreasing.\n\nThe volume flow rate out of the hole can be calculated as:\n\nQ_out = A_hole * v\nQ_out = π * (0.5 ft)^2 * 8 ft/s\nQ_out ≈ 6.283 ft^3/s\n\nNow, we need to relate this to the rate of decrease in the height of the water in the tank. The volume of the water in the tank can be expressed as:\n\nV_tank = π * R_tank^2 * h_tank\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to time, we get:\n\ndV_tank/dt = π * R_tank^2 * dh_tank/dt\n\nSince the rate of decrease in the volume of the water in the tank is equal to the volume flow rate out of the hole, we can write:\n\n6.283 ft^3/s = π * (5 ft)^2 * dh_tank/dt\n\nNow, we can solve for the rate of decrease in the height of the water:\n\ndh_tank/dt = 6.283 ft^3/s / (π * 25 ft^2)\ndh_tank/dt ≈ 0.025 ft/s\n\nThus, the water level in the tank is decreasing at a rate of approximately 0.025 ft/s."
