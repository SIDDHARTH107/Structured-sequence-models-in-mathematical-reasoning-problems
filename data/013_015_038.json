    "message_1": "Suppose that a principal hires an agent to complete a project. The principal can only observe the outcome of the project and not the effort put in by the agent. The agent has two choices, 'exert effort' or 'shirk'. If the agent exerts effort, the outcome will be good with probability 0.7, and bad with probability 0.3. If the agent shirks, the outcome will be bad with probability 0.8, and good with probability 0.2. The principal offers the agent a payment scheme of $1500 bonus for a good outcome and $500 bonus for a bad outcome. If the agent shirks, the principal will deduct $1000 as a penalty. \n\nWhat is the optimal strategy for the agent and how much money will they expect to earn?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal strategy for the agent, we need to calculate the expected earnings for both choices: exerting effort and shirking.\n\n1. Exerting effort:\n- Good outcome (probability 0.7): $1500 bonus\n- Bad outcome (probability 0.3): $500 bonus\n\nExpected earnings for exerting effort = (0.7 * $1500) + (0.3 * $500) = $1050 + $150 = $1200\n\n2. Shirking:\n- Good outcome (probability 0.2): $1500 bonus - $1000 penalty = $500\n- Bad outcome (probability 0.8): $500 bonus - $1000 penalty = -$500\n\nExpected earnings for shirking = (0.2 * $500) + (0.8 * -$500) = $100 - $400 = -$300\n\nComparing the expected earnings for both strategies, the agent should choose to exert effort, as it has a higher expected earning of $1200 compared to shirking, which has an expected earning of -$300."
