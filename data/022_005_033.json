    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Residue Theorem. The Residue Theorem states that for a function f(z) that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C, except for a finite number of singularities inside C, the integral of f(z) around C is given by:\n\n$\\oint_C f(z) dz = 2\\pi i \\sum Res(f, z_k)$\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all singularities $z_k$ inside C.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that f(z) has poles at z = 2 and z = 3, and we are asked to find the integral of $\\frac{z^5}{f(z)}$ around the circle $|z| = 5/2$. Since the circle $|z| = 5/2$ encloses the poles at z = 2 and z = 3, we can apply the Residue Theorem.\n\nFirst, let's find the residues of the function $\\frac{z^5}{f(z)}$ at the poles z = 2 and z = 3. Since f(z) has poles at these points, we can write f(z) as:\n\n$f(z) = (z - 2)^m g_2(z) = (z - 3)^n g_3(z)$\n\nwhere m and n are the orders of the poles at z = 2 and z = 3, respectively, and $g_2(z)$ and $g_3(z)$ are analytic functions at z = 2 and z = 3, respectively.\n\nNow, we are given that Res(f, 2) = 3 and Res(f, 3) = -4/3. The residues of $\\frac{z^5}{f(z)}$ at z = 2 and z = 3 can be found using the following formulas:\n\n$Res(\\frac{z^5}{f(z)}, 2) = \\frac{2^5}{(2 - 3)^n g_3(2)} = \\frac{32}{-g_3(2)}$\n\n$Res(\\frac{z^5}{f(z)}, 3) = \\frac{3^5}{(3 - 2)^m g_2(3)} = \\frac{243}{g_2(3)}$\n\nNow, we can use the given residues of f(z) to find the residues of $\\frac{z^5}{f(z)}$:\n\n$Res(\\frac{z^5}{f(z)}, 2) = \\frac{32}{-g_3(2)} = \\frac{32}{-3} = -\\frac{32}{3}$\n\n$Res(\\frac{z^5}{f(z)}, 3) = \\frac{243}{g_2(3)} = \\frac{243}{-4/3} = -\\frac{729}{4}$\n\nNow, we can apply the Residue Theorem to find the integral of $\\frac{z^5}{f(z)}$ around the circle $|z| = 5/2$:\n\n$\\oint_{|z|=5/2} \\frac{z^5}{f(z)} dz = 2\\pi i \\left(-\\frac{32}{3} - \\frac{729}{4}\\right) = 2\\pi i \\left(-\\frac{128}{12} - \\frac{2187}{12}\\right) = 2\\pi i \\left(-\\frac{2315}{12}\\right)$\n\nSo, the value of the integral is:\n\n$\\int_{|z|=5/2}\\frac{z^5}{f(z)}dz = -\\frac{2315\\pi i}{6}$."
