    "message_2": "To find the largest angle in the triangle, we should use the Law of Cosines instead of the Law of Sines. The Law of Cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles.\n\nThe Law of Cosines formula is:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite side c.\n\nIn this case, the largest angle is opposite the longest side, which is 13 cm. So, we have:\n\na = 10 cm\nb = 7 cm\nc = 13 cm\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Law of Cosines formula to find the largest angle:\n\n13² = 10² + 7² - 2 * 10 * 7 * cos(C)\n\n169 = 100 + 49 - 140 * cos(C)\n\n20 = -140 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = -20/140\n\nC = arccos(-20/140)\n\nC ≈ 97.41°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 97.41°."
