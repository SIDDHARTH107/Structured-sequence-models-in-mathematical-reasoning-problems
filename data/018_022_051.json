    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted by A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nSimilarly, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted by B ∆ A.\n\nB ∆ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∆ B) and (B ∆ A).\n\n(A ∆ B) x (B ∆ A) = {1, 4} x {1, 4} = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (B ∆ A) and (A ∆ B).\n\n(B ∆ A) x (A ∆ B) = {1, 4} x {1, 4} = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A ∆ B) x (B ∆ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)} and (B ∆ A) x (A ∆ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}. \n\nTherefore, (A ∆ B) x (B ∆ A) is equal to (B ∆ A) x (A ∆ B)."
