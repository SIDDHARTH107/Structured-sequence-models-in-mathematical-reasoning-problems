    "message_1": "A certain type of traffic accident occurs on a road with a probability of 0.04. If 10,000 vehicles travel on the same road in a day, find the probability that at least 5 accidents occur on the road.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 5 accidents occur on the road, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 accidents occurring. Then, we can subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least 5 accidents.\n\nLet X be the number of accidents. We can model this problem using a binomial distribution with parameters n = 10,000 (number of vehicles) and p = 0.04 (probability of an accident).\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of a binomial distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere \"n choose k\" is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as:\n\n(n choose k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nFirst, we'll find the probability of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 accidents occurring:\n\nP(X = 0) = (10000 choose 0) * 0.04^0 * (1-0.04)^(10000-0)\nP(X = 1) = (10000 choose 1) * 0.04^1 * (1-0.04)^(10000-1)\nP(X = 2) = (10000 choose 2) * 0.04^2 * (1-0.04)^(10000-2)\nP(X = 3) = (10000 choose 3) * 0.04^3 * (1-0.04)^(10000-3)\nP(X = 4) = (10000 choose 4) * 0.04^4 * (1-0.04)^(10000-4)\n\nNow, we'll find the sum of these probabilities:\n\nP(0 ≤ X ≤ 4) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)\n\nFinally, we'll find the complementary probability:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(0 ≤ X ≤ 4)\n\nCalculating these probabilities using a calculator or software:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 1.80e-17\nP(X = 1) ≈ 7.45e-15\nP(X = 2) ≈ 1.53e-12\nP(X = 3) ≈ 1.68e-10\nP(X = 4) ≈ 1.04e-08\n\nP(0 ≤ X ≤ 4) ≈ 1.80e-17 + 7.45e-15 + 1.53e-12 + 1.68e-10 + 1.04e-08 ≈ 1.05e-08\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(0 ≤ X ≤ 4) ≈ 1 - 1.05e-08 ≈ 0.9999999895\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 accidents occur on the road is approximately 0.9999999895, or 99.99999895%."
