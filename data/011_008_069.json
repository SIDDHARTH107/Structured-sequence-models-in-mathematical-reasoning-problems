    "message_1": "A group of 8 students is participating in a school talent show. Each student will perform a different act, and the judges will award them first, second, and third place prizes. In how many ways can the prizes be awarded if no student can win more than one prize? Use Stirling numbers of the second kind.",
    "message_2": "Using Stirling numbers of the second kind is not the most appropriate method for solving this problem. Instead, we can use the permutation formula to find the number of ways to award the prizes.\n\nThere are 8 students, and we need to choose 3 of them to receive the prizes. The order in which they receive the prizes matters, so we will use the permutation formula:\n\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n\nIn this case, n = 8 (the number of students) and r = 3 (the number of prizes). So, we have:\n\nP(8, 3) = 8! / (8 - 3)!\n\nP(8, 3) = 8! / 5!\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorials:\n\n8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nNow, we can divide:\n\nP(8, 3) = 40,320 / 120 = 336\n\nSo, there are 336 ways to award the prizes to the 8 students."
