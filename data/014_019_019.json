    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the given transposition cipher key, we first need to split the message into blocks of 8 characters (the length of the key). Since the message has 11 characters, we will pad it with extra characters (usually 'X') to make it a multiple of 8. So, the padded message becomes \"MATHEMATICSXX\".\n\nNow, we arrange the message into blocks of 8 characters:\n\nMATHEMAT\nICSXX\n\nNext, we apply the transposition cipher key (2 5 1 8 7 4 3 6) to each block:\n\nBlock 1: MATHEMAT\nRearranged: ATEHMATM\n\nBlock 2: ICSXX\nRearranged: CSIXX\n\nFinally, we combine the rearranged blocks to get the ciphertext: ATEHMATMCSIXX"
