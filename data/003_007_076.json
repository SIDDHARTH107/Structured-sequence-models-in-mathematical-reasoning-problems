    "message_2": "To find the largest angle of the triangle, we need to find the angle opposite the longest side, which is 12 cm in this case. We can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of lengths a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, a = 8 cm, b = 10 cm, and c = 12 cm. We want to find the angle C. Plugging the values into the formula:\n\n12² = 8² + 10² - 2 * 8 * 10 * cos(C)\n\n144 = 64 + 100 - 160 * cos(C)\n\n80 = 160 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = 80 / 160\n\ncos(C) = 0.5\n\nNow, we need to find the angle C whose cosine is 0.5. Using the inverse cosine function (also called arccos or cos^(-1)):\n\nC = arccos(0.5)\n\nC ≈ 60°\n\nSo, the largest angle of the triangle is approximately 60°."
