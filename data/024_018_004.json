    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature in the direction of the vector v = √(3)i + j at the point (1,1,2) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2 - 4, we first need to find the tangent plane at that point and then find the curvature of the curve obtained by intersecting the tangent plane with the surface.\n\n1. Find the tangent plane at the point (1,1,2):\n\nThe gradient of the surface is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∇f = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y) = (2x, 2y)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), the gradient is:\n\n∇f(1,1,2) = (2, 2)\n\nThe normal vector to the tangent plane is given by the gradient, so N = (2, 2, -1). The equation of the tangent plane can be written as:\n\n2(x - 1) + 2(y - 1) - (z - 2) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get the equation of the tangent plane:\n\n2x + 2y - z = 1\n\n2. Find the curve of intersection between the tangent plane and the surface:\n\nTo find the curve of intersection, we substitute z from the surface equation into the tangent plane equation:\n\n2x + 2y - (x^2 + y^2 - 4) = 1\n\nRearranging and simplifying, we get a quadratic equation in x and y:\n\nx^2 + y^2 - 2x - 2y + 3 = 0\n\n3. Find the curvature of the curve of intersection:\n\nTo find the curvature, we need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the curve. Let's parameterize the curve using the vector v:\n\nr(t) = (1,1,2) + t(√3, 1, 0) = (1 + √3t, 1 + t, 2)\n\nNow, we find the first and second derivatives of r(t) with respect to t:\n\nr'(t) = (√3, 1, 0)\nr''(t) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nThe curvature κ is given by the formula:\n\nκ = ||r'(t) × r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nSince r''(t) = (0, 0, 0), the cross product r'(t) × r''(t) is also (0, 0, 0). Therefore, the curvature κ is:\n\nκ = ||(0, 0, 0)|| / ||(√3, 1, 0)||^3 = 0 / (2)^3 = 0\n\nSo, the sectional curvature in the direction of the vector v = √(3)i + j at the point (1,1,2) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2 - 4 is 0."
