    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, there are 10 players who each have an initial endowment of $100. They can choose to either keep the money, or contribute some or all of it towards a public good. The amount contributed towards the public good is multiplied by a factor of 2, and then divided equally among all players, regardless of whether they contributed or not. For example, if 5 players each contribute $20, then the total public good amount is $100 ($20 x 2 x 5), and each player receives $10 ($100 divided by 10). If all 10 players keep their money, then the public good amount is $0.\n\nWhat is the Nash equilibrium for this Public Goods Game, and how much money will each player contribute towards the public good at this equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "In the Public Goods Game, the Nash equilibrium occurs when no player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the strategies of the other players. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when each player contributes $0 towards the public good.\n\nTo understand why, consider the following: If a player contributes any amount towards the public good, the total amount contributed will be multiplied by 2 and then divided among all 10 players. This means that each player will receive only 1/5 (or 20%) of their own contribution. Since this is less than the amount they initially contributed, they would be better off keeping their money instead of contributing.\n\nTherefore, in the Nash equilibrium, each player will contribute $0 towards the public good."
