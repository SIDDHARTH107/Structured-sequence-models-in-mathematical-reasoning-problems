    "message_1": "A ladder is placed on the ground, leaning against a wall. The ladder is 10 meters long, and the angle formed between the ladder and the ground is 70 degrees. How far up the wall does the ladder reach?",
    "message_2": "To find how far up the wall the ladder reaches, we can use the sine function in trigonometry. The sine function relates the ratio of the opposite side (the height up the wall) to the hypotenuse (the length of the ladder) in a right triangle.\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this case, the angle is 70 degrees, and the hypotenuse is the length of the ladder, which is 10 meters. We want to find the opposite side, which represents the height up the wall.\n\nsin(70) = height / 10\n\nTo find the height, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nheight = 10 * sin(70)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the height:\n\nheight = 10 * sin(70) ≈ 10 * 0.9397 ≈ 9.397 meters\n\nSo, the ladder reaches approximately 9.397 meters up the wall."
