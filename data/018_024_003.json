    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4} = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A ∆ B and C, denoted as (A ∆ B) ∆ C.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ C = ({1, 5} ∪ {3, 4, 5, 6}) - ({1, 5} ∩ {3, 4, 5, 6}) = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {5} = {1, 3, 4, 6}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and C, denoted as B ∆ C.\n\nB ∆ C = (B ∪ C) - (B ∩ C) = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4, 5} = {2, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and (B ∆ C), denoted as A ∆ (B ∆ C).\n\nA ∆ (B ∆ C) = (A ∪ {2, 6}) - (A ∩ {2, 6}) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6} - {2} = {1, 3, 4, 6}\n\nWe can see that (A ∆ B) ∆ C = A ∆ (B ∆ C) = {1, 3, 4, 6}. However, this does not prove that the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement, as we have only shown that it is equal in this specific case.\n\nTo show that the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement, we need to find a counterexample where (A ∆ B) ∆ C ≠ A ∆ (B ∆ C).\n\nLet's consider the sets A = {1, 2}, B = {2, 3}, and C = {1, 3}. \n\nA ∆ B = {1, 3}\nB ∆ C = {1, 2}\nA ∆ (B ∆ C) = A ∆ {1, 2} = {3}\n\nNow, let's find (A ∆ B) ∆ C.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ C = {1, 3} ∆ {1, 3} = {}\n\nIn this case, (A ∆ B) ∆ C ≠ A ∆ (B ∆ C) since {} ≠ {3}. This counterexample shows that the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement."
