    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first represent the initial wave profile as a function and then use the Fourier transform to find the wave profiles at the desired positions.\n\nLet's represent the initial wave profile as a function f(x) with a height of 2m:\n\nf(x) = 2, for 0 <= x <= 100\n\nNow, we will use the Fourier transform to represent this function as a sum of sinusoidal functions. The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-ikx)] dx, where i is the imaginary unit, k is the wave number, and the integral is taken over the entire domain of the function.\n\nFor our problem, the wave number k = 0.1m^-1. We can compute the Fourier transform of f(x) as follows:\n\nF(k) = ∫[2 * e^(-i * 0.1 * x)] dx, for 0 <= x <= 100\n\nF(k) = -20i * (e^(-10i) - 1)\n\nNow, we can use the inverse Fourier transform to find the wave profile at any position x after the wave has traveled a certain distance downstream. The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\nf(x) = (1/2π) * ∫[F(k) * e^(ikx)] dk\n\nFor our problem, we want to find the wave profiles at x = 25m and x = 75m after the wave has traveled 50m downstream. Let's denote these wave profiles as f1(x) and f2(x), respectively:\n\nf1(x) = (1/2π) * ∫[-20i * (e^(-10i) - 1) * e^(i * 0.1 * (x - 50))] dk, for 0 <= x <= 100\nf2(x) = (1/2π) * ∫[-20i * (e^(-10i) - 1) * e^(i * 0.1 * (x - 50))] dk, for 0 <= x <= 100\n\nNow, we can plug in x = 25m and x = 75m to find the wave profiles at these positions:\n\nf1(25) = (1/2π) * ∫[-20i * (e^(-10i) - 1) * e^(i * 0.1 * (25 - 50))] dk\nf1(25) = (1/2π) * ∫[-20i * (e^(-10i) - 1) * e^(-2.5i)] dk\n\nf2(75) = (1/2π) * ∫[-20i * (e^(-10i) - 1) * e^(i * 0.1 * (75 - 50))] dk\nf2(75) = (1/2π) * ∫[-20i * (e^(-10i) - 1) * e^(2.5i)] dk\n\nTo find the actual values of f1(25) and f2(75), we would need to compute these integrals numerically. However, the main idea here is that we have used the Fourier transform to represent the initial wave profile as a sum of sinusoidal functions, and we can use the inverse Fourier transform to find the wave profiles at any position after the wave has traveled a certain distance downstream."
