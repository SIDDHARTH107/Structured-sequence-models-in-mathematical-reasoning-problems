    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the two equal side lengths are 9 cm each. The base of the triangle is 12 cm. What is the length of the altitude drawn from the vertex to the base?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the altitude, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. Since the altitude bisects the base, it creates two right triangles with the base being divided into two equal parts, each of length 6 cm.\n\nLet h be the length of the altitude. In one of the right triangles, the legs are h and 6 cm, and the hypotenuse is 9 cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nh^2 + 6^2 = 9^2\nh^2 + 36 = 81\nh^2 = 81 - 36\nh^2 = 45\nh = √45\nh ≈ 6.71 cm\n\nSo, the length of the altitude is approximately 6.71 cm."
