    "message_1": "Suppose that a linear system is described by the transfer function: \n\nH(s) = (2s + 4)/((s+1)(s+3))\n\nDetermine whether this system is stable or unstable by using the Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system using the Fourier transform, we first need to analyze the poles of the transfer function H(s). The poles are the values of s that make the denominator of the transfer function equal to zero. In this case, the denominator is (s+1)(s+3).\n\nSetting the denominator equal to zero, we get:\n\n(s+1)(s+3) = 0\n\nSolving for s, we find the poles:\n\ns = -1, -3\n\nNow, we need to check the real parts of the poles. If the real parts of all poles are negative, the system is stable. If any of the real parts of the poles are positive or zero, the system is unstable.\n\nIn this case, the real parts of both poles are negative:\n\nRe(s) = -1, -3\n\nSince both real parts are negative, the system is stable."
