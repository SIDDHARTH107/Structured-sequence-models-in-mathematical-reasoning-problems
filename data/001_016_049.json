    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we can use the rule of exponents: $$a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$$\n\nIn this case, $$a = 3$$, $$m = 4$$, and $$n = -2$$. Applying the rule, we get:\n\n$$3^4 \\cdot 3^{-2} = 3^{4 + (-2)} = 3^2$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of $$3^2$$:\n\n$$3^2 = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9$$\n\nSo, the simplified form of the expression is $$9$$."
