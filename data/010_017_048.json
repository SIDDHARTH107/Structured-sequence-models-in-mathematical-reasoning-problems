    "message_2": "To determine the Morse polynomial of the graph, we will use the Euler characteristic formula for planar graphs:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere χ is the Euler characteristic, V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. In this case, we have:\n\nχ = 6 - 9 + 5 = 2\n\nNow, let's denote the number of critical points of index i by m_i. The Morse inequalities state that:\n\nm_0 - m_1 + m_2 - ... = χ\n\nSince the graph is planar, the maximum index of a critical point is 2. Therefore, we have:\n\nm_0 - m_1 + m_2 = 2\n\nWe also know that the number of critical points of index 0 (minima) is 1, and the number of critical points of index 2 (maxima) is also 1. This is because there is only one global minimum and one global maximum in a planar graph. So, we have:\n\n1 - m_1 + 1 = 2\n\nSolving for m_1, we get:\n\nm_1 = 0\n\nThus, there are no critical points of index 1 (saddle points) in this graph.\n\nNow, we can write the Morse polynomial P(t) as:\n\nP(t) = m_0 + m_1 * t + m_2 * t^2 = 1 + 0 * t + 1 * t^2 = 1 + t^2\n\nSo, the Morse polynomial of this graph is:\n\nP(t) = 1 + t^2\n\nAnd the number of critical points of its associated Morse function is:\n\nm_0 + m_1 + m_2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2"
