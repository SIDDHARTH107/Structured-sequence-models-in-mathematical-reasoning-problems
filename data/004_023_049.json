    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed by the curves y = x^3 and y = x + 1 over the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. To do this, we set y = x^3 equal to y = x + 1:\n\nx^3 = x + 1\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\nx^3 - x - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and it does not have a simple algebraic solution. However, we can approximate the solutions numerically. Using a numerical method, we find that there is one real root in the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, which is approximately x ≈ 1.3247.\n\nNow, we will find the area enclosed by the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 2. Since y = x^3 is below y = x + 1 in this interval, we will integrate (x + 1) - x^3:\n\nArea = ∫[(x + 1) - x^3] dx from 0 to 1.3247 + ∫[(x + 1) - x^3] dx from 1.3247 to 2\n\nArea = [x^2/2 + x - x^4/4] from 0 to 1.3247 + [x^2/2 + x - x^4/4] from 1.3247 to 2\n\nEvaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of integration:\n\nArea ≈ (1.3247^2/2 + 1.3247 - 1.3247^4/4) - (0^2/2 + 0 - 0^4/4) + (2^2/2 + 2 - 2^4/4) - (1.3247^2/2 + 1.3247 - 1.3247^4/4)\n\nArea ≈ 0.8817\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the curves y = x^3 and y = x + 1 over the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 is approximately 0.8817 square units."
