    "message_2": "To find the scaling factor for the second largest fern in the Barnsley fern fractal after 10 iterations, we need to consider the growth of the fern through each iteration.\n\nThe Barnsley fern fractal has four transformations, but we are given specific scaling factors for the main stem and two primary branches (0.33) and the smaller branches (0.5). We will focus on these scaling factors to find the size of the second largest fern.\n\nIn the first iteration, the main stem and two primary branches are scaled by a factor of 0.33, and the smaller branches are scaled by a factor of 0.5. The second largest fern in this iteration is one of the primary branches, which has a length of 0.33 units.\n\nIn the second iteration, the main stem and two primary branches of the second largest fern are scaled by a factor of 0.33, and the smaller branches are scaled by a factor of 0.5. The second largest fern in this iteration is one of the primary branches of the previous second largest fern, which has a length of 0.33 * 0.33 = 0.1089 units.\n\nWe continue this process for 10 iterations. To find the scaling factor for the second largest fern after 10 iterations, we multiply the scaling factor of the primary branches (0.33) by itself 10 times:\n\nScaling factor = 0.33^10 = 0.0000175767063\n\nSo, the scaling factor for the second largest fern in the Barnsley fern fractal after 10 iterations is approximately 0.0000175767."
