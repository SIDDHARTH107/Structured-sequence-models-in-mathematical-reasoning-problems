    "message_1": "A magician has five red balls, three blue balls, and two green balls. He plans to select three balls at random one by one without replacement. What is the probability that he will select two red balls and one blue ball in any order?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We need to find the number of ways to select two red balls and one blue ball, and then divide that by the total number of ways to select three balls from the ten available.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to select two red balls and one blue ball. There are 5 red balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 of them is given by the combination formula: C(5,2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = 10. Similarly, there are 3 blue balls, so the number of ways to choose 1 of them is C(3,1) = 3! / (1! * (3-1)!) = 3.\n\nNow, we multiply these two numbers together to find the total number of ways to select two red balls and one blue ball: 10 * 3 = 30.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of ways to select any three balls from the ten available. This is given by the combination formula: C(10,3) = 10! / (3! * (10-3)!) = 120.\n\nFinally, we divide the number of ways to select two red balls and one blue ball by the total number of ways to select three balls: 30 / 120 = 1/4.\n\nSo, the probability that the magician will select two red balls and one blue ball in any order is 1/4 or 0.25."
