    "message_2": "To determine whether the sequence (3, 3, 3, ...) converges in the topological space (X, T), we need to check if there exists a limit point x âˆˆ X such that for any open set U containing x, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, the terms of the sequence belong to U.\n\nIn this case, the sequence is constant, with all terms equal to 3. Let's consider the point x = 3. We will show that the sequence converges to x.\n\nThere are two open sets in T that contain x: {1, 2, 3, 4} and {1, 2}. \n\n1. For the open set {1, 2, 3, 4}, since all terms of the sequence are in this set, we can choose N = 1. For all n > N, the terms of the sequence belong to {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\n2. For the open set {1, 2}, x = 3 is not in this set, so we don't need to consider it.\n\nSince for every open set U containing x, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, the terms of the sequence belong to U, we can conclude that the sequence (3, 3, 3, ...) converges to x = 3 in the topological space (X, T)."
