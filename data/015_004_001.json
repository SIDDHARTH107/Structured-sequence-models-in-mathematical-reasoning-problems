    "message_1": "What is the number of iterations required to determine if the point (0.225, 0.745) belongs to the Mandelbrot set based on the formula Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + C, where C = 0.225 + 0.745i and Z(0) = 0?",
    "message_2": "To determine if a point belongs to the Mandelbrot set, we need to check if the sequence Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + C remains bounded. If the magnitude of Z(n) becomes greater than 2 at any point, we can say that the point does not belong to the Mandelbrot set. We can set a maximum number of iterations to check for convergence, and if the sequence remains bounded within that number of iterations, we can assume that the point belongs to the Mandelbrot set.\n\nLet's start calculating the iterations for the given point (0.225, 0.745):\n\nC = 0.225 + 0.745i\nZ(0) = 0\n\nIteration 1:\nZ(1) = Z(0)^2 + C = 0^2 + (0.225 + 0.745i) = 0.225 + 0.745i\n\nIteration 2:\nZ(2) = Z(1)^2 + C = (0.225 + 0.745i)^2 + (0.225 + 0.745i)\n= (0.225^2 - 0.745^2) + 2(0.225)(0.745)i + (0.225 + 0.745i)\n= -0.476225 + 0.33525i + 0.225 + 0.745i\n= -0.251225 + 1.08025i\n\nIteration 3:\nZ(3) = Z(2)^2 + C = (-0.251225 + 1.08025i)^2 + (0.225 + 0.745i)\n= (-0.251225^2 - 1.08025^2) + 2(-0.251225)(1.08025)i + (0.225 + 0.745i)\n= 1.162570 + 0.5425i + 0.225 + 0.745i\n= 1.38757 + 1.2875i\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnitude of Z(3):\n\n|Z(3)| = sqrt(1.38757^2 + 1.2875^2) = sqrt(1.926 + 1.656) = sqrt(3.582)\n\nSince |Z(3)| > 2, we can conclude that the point (0.225, 0.745) does not belong to the Mandelbrot set. It took 3 iterations to determine this."
