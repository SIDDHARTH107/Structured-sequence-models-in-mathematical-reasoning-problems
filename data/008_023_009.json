    "message_2": "To find an approximation to the solution, we can use the least squares method. First, let's represent the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants:\n\nA = | 2  3  1 |\n    | 1 -1  2 |\n    | 3 -2 -1 |\n\nB = | 28.1  |\n    |  7.9  |\n    | -16.3 |\n\nNow, we'll use the least squares method to find an approximation to the solution. The least squares method involves finding the pseudo-inverse of the matrix A, denoted as A^+. We can calculate A^+ using the formula:\n\nA^+ = (A^T * A)^(-1) * A^T\n\nwhere A^T is the transpose of A and (A^T * A)^(-1) is the inverse of the product of A^T and A.\n\nFirst, let's find the transpose of A:\n\nA^T = |  2  1  3 |\n      |  3 -1 -2 |\n      |  1  2 -1 |\n\nNext, let's find the product of A^T and A:\n\nA^T * A = | 14  0  8 |\n          |  0 14  0 |\n          |  8  0  6 |\n\nNow, let's find the inverse of the product (A^T * A)^(-1):\n\n(A^T * A)^(-1) = | 1/14  0  -1/7 |\n                 |  0  1/14  0  |\n                 | -1/7  0  1/3 |\n\nNow, we can find the pseudo-inverse A^+:\n\nA^+ = (A^T * A)^(-1) * A^T = | 1/14  0  -1/7 | * |  2  1  3 |\n                              |  0  1/14  0  |   |  3 -1 -2 |\n                              | -1/7  0  1/3 |   |  1  2 -1 |\n\nA^+ = | 1/7  1/7  2/7 |\n      | 3/14 -1/14 -1/7 |\n      | 1/3  1/3 -1/3 |\n\nFinally, we can find the approximation to the solution X by multiplying A^+ with B:\n\nX = A^+ * B = | 1/7  1/7  2/7 | * | 28.1  |\n              | 3/14 -1/14 -1/7 |   |  7.9  |\n              | 1/3  1/3 -1/3 |   | -16.3 |\n\nX = | 3.042857 |\n    | 4.971429 |\n    | -1.966667 |\n\nSo, the approximation to the solution is (x, y, z) â‰ˆ (3.042857, 4.971429, -1.966667)."
