    "message_1": "A non-periodic function f(x) is given as f(x) = x^2 for 0<=x<1. You are asked to find the Fourier coefficients for this function using Fourier analysis techniques. What are the values of the first three non-zero Fourier coefficients for this function?",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients for the function f(x) = x^2 for 0 <= x < 1, we first need to make the function periodic. We can do this by extending the function to be an odd function over the interval -1 <= x < 1. This means that f(x) = -x^2 for -1 <= x < 0. Now, the function is periodic with period 2.\n\nWe can now find the Fourier sine series for this function since it is an odd function. The Fourier sine series is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑[B_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nwhere B_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L, and L is half the period of the function (in this case, L = 1).\n\nLet's find the first three non-zero Fourier coefficients B_1, B_2, and B_3.\n\nB_n = 2 * ∫[x^2 * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 1\n\nTo find B_n, we need to integrate x^2 * sin(nπx) with respect to x. We can use integration by parts twice to find the integral.\n\nLet u = x^2 and dv = sin(nπx) dx.\nThen, du = 2x dx and v = -(1/nπ)cos(nπx).\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n∫[x^2 * sin(nπx) dx] = -x^2 * (1/nπ)cos(nπx) - ∫[-2x * (1/nπ)cos(nπx) dx]\n\nNow, let u = -2x and dv = (1/nπ)cos(nπx) dx.\nThen, du = -2 dx and v = (1/n^2π^2)sin(nπx).\n\nUsing integration by parts again:\n∫[-2x * (1/nπ)cos(nπx) dx] = -2x * (1/n^2π^2)sin(nπx) - ∫[-2 * (1/n^2π^2)sin(nπx) dx]\n\nIntegrating the remaining term:\n∫[-2 * (1/n^2π^2)sin(nπx) dx] = -2 * (1/n^3π^3)cos(nπx)\n\nNow, we can find B_n:\nB_n = 2 * [-x^2 * (1/nπ)cos(nπx) - (-2x * (1/n^2π^2)sin(nπx) - 2 * (1/n^3π^3)cos(nπx))] evaluated from 0 to 1\n\nB_n = 2 * [(1/nπ) - (1/n^3π^3)]\n\nNow, we can find the first three non-zero Fourier coefficients:\n\nB_1 = 2 * [(1/π) - (1/π^3)] = 2(π^2 - 1) / π^3\nB_2 = 2 * [(1/2π) - (1/8π^3)] = 2(4 - 1) / 8π^3 = 6 / 4π^3\nB_3 = 2 * [(1/3π) - (1/27π^3)] = 2(9 - 1) / 27π^3 = 16 / 9π^3\n\nSo, the first three non-zero Fourier coefficients are B_1 = 2(π^2 - 1) / π^3, B_2 = 6 / 4π^3, and B_3 = 16 / 9π^3."
