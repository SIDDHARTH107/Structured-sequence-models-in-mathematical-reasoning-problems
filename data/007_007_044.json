    "message_1": "The Diophantine equation you need to solve is: 9x + 15y = 12. Find all possible integer solutions for x and y such that the equation holds true.",
    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the given Diophantine equation by dividing it by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9, 15, and 12, which is 3. So, we get:\n\n3x + 5y = 4\n\nNow, we need to find all integer solutions for x and y. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the solutions.\n\nLet's find the GCD of 3 and 5 using the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n\n5 = 1 * 3 + 2\n3 = 1 * 2 + 1\n\nNow, we can express 1 as a linear combination of 3 and 5:\n\n1 = 3 - 1 * 2\n1 = 3 - 1 * (5 - 1 * 3)\n1 = 2 * 3 - 1 * 5\n\nSo, we have found a particular solution for the Diophantine equation:\n\nx0 = 2, y0 = -1\n\nNow, we can find the general solution for the equation:\n\nx = x0 + k * (5/GCD(3, 5))\ny = y0 - k * (3/GCD(3, 5))\n\nSince GCD(3, 5) = 1, the general solution is:\n\nx = 2 + 5k\ny = -1 - 3k\n\nNow, we can find all integer solutions for x and y by substituting different integer values for k:\n\nFor k = 0: x = 2, y = -1\nFor k = 1: x = 7, y = -4\nFor k = -1: x = -3, y = 2\nFor k = 2: x = 12, y = -7\n...\n\nSo, the general integer solutions for the given Diophantine equation are:\n\nx = 2 + 5k\ny = -1 - 3k\n\nwhere k is an integer."
