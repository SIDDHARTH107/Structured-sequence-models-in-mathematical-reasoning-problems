    "message_2": "To solve the equation 4x^3 - 10x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0, we can use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method, as it is a cubic equation and may not have a straightforward algebraic solution.\n\nThe Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method that refines an initial guess for the root of an equation. The formula for the method is:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nwhere x_n is the current guess, f(x_n) is the value of the function at x_n, and f'(x_n) is the value of the derivative of the function at x_n.\n\nThe given equation is:\n\nf(x) = 4x^3 - 10x^2 + 3x + 2\n\nThe derivative of the function is:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 20x + 3\n\nNow, we need to choose an initial guess for the root. Let's start with x_0 = 1.\n\nWe will iterate the Newton-Raphson method until the difference between successive guesses is less than 0.01, which will give us an answer correct to two decimal places.\n\nIteration 1:\nx_1 = x_0 - f(x_0) / f'(x_0)\nx_1 = 1 - (4(1)^3 - 10(1)^2 + 3(1) + 2) / (12(1)^2 - 20(1) + 3)\nx_1 = 1 - (-5 / -5)\nx_1 = 1\n\nSince x_1 is the same as x_0, we have found a root of the equation: x = 1.\n\nNow, we can use synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic equation:\n\n4x^3 - 10x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x - 1)(4x^2 - 6x - 2)\n\nNow, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\n4x^2 - 6x - 2 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(4)(-2))) / (2(4))\nx = (6 ± √(36 + 32)) / 8\nx = (6 ± √68) / 8\n\nSo, the roots of the equation are:\n\nx = (6 + √68) / 8 ≈ 1.91\nx = (6 - √68) / 8 ≈ -0.41\n\nThus, the solutions to the equation 4x^3 - 10x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0 are approximately x = 1, x ≈ 1.91, and x ≈ -0.41, correct to two decimal places."
