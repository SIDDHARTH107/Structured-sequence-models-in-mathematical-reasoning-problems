    "message_1": "A 10-meter ladder is leaning against a wall. If the angle of elevation of the ladder is 60°, what is the maximum possible height the ladder can reach on the wall? (round your answer to the nearest tenth of a meter)",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum possible height the ladder can reach on the wall, we can use the sine function in trigonometry. The sine function is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the angle of elevation is 60°, and the hypotenuse is the length of the ladder, which is 10 meters.\n\nsin(60°) = height / 10\n\nTo find the sine of 60°, we can use a calculator or recall that sin(60°) = √3/2.\n\n(√3/2) = height / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 10 * (√3/2)\n\nheight ≈ 10 * (0.866)\n\nheight ≈ 8.66\n\nRounded to the nearest tenth of a meter, the maximum possible height the ladder can reach on the wall is approximately 8.7 meters."
