This is the set of all elements that are in both A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of A ∩ B and B, denoted as (A ∩ B) x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A ∩ B and b is in B.\n\n(A ∩ B) x B = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, we want to prove that the Cartesian product of A and B is distributive over intersection. In other words, we want to show that:\n\nA x (B ∩ C) = (A x B) ∩ (A x C)\n\nLet C be an arbitrary set. We will prove this by showing that each side of the equation is a subset of the other.\n\n1. A x (B ∩ C) ⊆ (A x B) ∩ (A x C)\n\nLet (a, d) be an arbitrary element in A x (B ∩ C). Then, by definition of Cartesian product, a ∈ A and d ∈ (B ∩ C). Since d ∈ (B ∩ C), d ∈ B and d ∈ C. Therefore, (a, d) ∈ A x B and (a, d) ∈ A x C. Thus, (a, d) ∈ (A x B) ∩ (A x C). Since (a, d) was arbitrary, A x (B ∩ C) ⊆ (A x B) ∩ (A x C).\n\n2. (A x B) ∩ (A x C) ⊆ A x (B ∩ C)\n\nLet (a, d) be an arbitrary element in (A x B) ∩ (A x C). Then, by definition of intersection, (a, d) ∈ A x B and (a, d) ∈ A x C. Since (a, d) ∈ A x B, a ∈ A and d ∈ B. Similarly, since (a, d) ∈ A x C, a ∈ A and d ∈ C. Therefore, d ∈ B ∩ C. Thus, (a, d) ∈ A x (B ∩ C). Since (a, d) was arbitrary, (A x B) ∩ (A x C) ⊆ A x (B ∩ C).\n\nSince both 1 and 2 are true, we have shown that A x (B ∩ C) = (A x B) ∩ (A x C), proving that the Cartesian product is distributive over intersection."
