    "message_2": "First, we can write the system of equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  3 |  7  ]\n[ 4  6 | 14.1]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to find the solution.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5 |  3.5 ]\n[ 4  6   | 14.1 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with the second row minus 4 times the first row to eliminate the leading 4 in the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5 |  3.5 ]\n[ 0  0   |  0.1 ]\n```\n\nAt this point, we can see that the second equation is now 0x + 0y = 0.1, which is a contradiction. This means that the system of equations has no solution and is inconsistent.\n\nNow, let's discuss whether the system is well-conditioned or ill-conditioned. A system of equations is considered well-conditioned if a small change in the coefficients results in a small change in the solution. Conversely, a system is ill-conditioned if a small change in the coefficients results in a large change in the solution.\n\nIn this case, if we look at the original system of equations, we can see that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation (with a small change in the constant term). This means that the two equations are nearly linearly dependent, and the system is very sensitive to small changes in the coefficients. Therefore, the system is ill-conditioned."
