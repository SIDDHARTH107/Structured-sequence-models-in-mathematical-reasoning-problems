    "message_2": "To find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the determinant (denoted as |A|) of the matrix.\n2. Swap the elements in the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).\n3. Change the sign of the elements in the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left).\n4. Divide each element by the determinant.\n\nGiven matrix A:\n\n```\n[3 4]\n[2 5]\n```\n\nStep 1: Find the determinant |A|:\n\n|A| = (3 * 5) - (4 * 2) = 15 - 8 = 7\n\nStep 2: Swap the elements in the main diagonal:\n\n```\n[5 4]\n[2 3]\n```\n\nStep 3: Change the sign of the elements in the other diagonal:\n\n```\n[ 5 -4]\n[-2  3]\n```\n\nStep 4: Divide each element by the determinant (7):\n\n```\n[ 5/7 -4/7]\n[-2/7  3/7]\n```\n\nSo, the inverse of the given matrix A is:\n\n```\n[ 5/7 -4/7]\n[-2/7  3/7]\n```"
