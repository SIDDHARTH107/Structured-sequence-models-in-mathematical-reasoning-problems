    "message_2": "First, we will show the existence of the deck transformation $f$. Since $X$ is path-connected, locally path-connected, and semi-locally simply connected, we know that the covering space $\\tilde{X}$ is normal. This means that for any two points $\\tilde{x}_1, \\tilde{x}_2 \\in \\tilde{X}$ with $p(\\tilde{x}_1) = p(\\tilde{x}_2) = x$, there exists a unique deck transformation $f : \\tilde{X} \\rightarrow \\tilde{X}$ such that $f(\\tilde{x}_1) = \\tilde{x}_2$. \n\nNow, let $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ be the lift of $\\gamma$ to $\\tilde{X}$ starting at $\\tilde{x}_1$. Then, $p(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = \\gamma(t)$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$. We want to show that $f(\\tilde{\\gamma})$ is a path in $\\tilde{X}$ from $\\tilde{x}_1$ to $\\tilde{x}_2$. \n\nDefine a new path $\\tilde{\\gamma}'(t) = f(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$. Then, $p(\\tilde{\\gamma}'(t)) = p(f(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))) = p(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = \\gamma(t)$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$ since deck transformations preserve the covering map. Thus, $\\tilde{\\gamma}'$ is a lift of $\\gamma$ to $\\tilde{X}$. \n\nSince $\\tilde{\\gamma}'(0) = f(\\tilde{\\gamma}(0)) = f(\\tilde{x}_1) = \\tilde{x}_2$, we have that $\\tilde{\\gamma}'$ is a path in $\\tilde{X}$ from $\\tilde{x}_1$ to $\\tilde{x}_2$. Therefore, the deck transformation $f$ exists.\n\nNow, we will determine the fundamental group of the torus $T = S^1 \\times S^1$. Let $a$ and $b$ be the generators of the fundamental group of $S^1$. Then, the fundamental group of the torus is given by the direct product of the fundamental groups of $S^1$:\n\n$\\pi_1(T) = \\pi_1(S^1) \\times \\pi_1(S^1) = \\langle a \\rangle \\times \\langle b \\rangle = \\langle a, b \\mid ab = ba \\rangle$\n\nThus, the fundamental group of the torus $T = S^1 \\times S^1$ is the free abelian group of rank 2, denoted by $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$."
