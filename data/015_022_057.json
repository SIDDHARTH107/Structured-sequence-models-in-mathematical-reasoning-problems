Implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.\n3. Set up the initial conditions and time step.\n4. Run the simulation from t = 0 to t = 2000.\n\nHere's the Python code to do this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef mackey_glass(x_t, x_t_minus_tau, beta=0.2, n=10, gamma=0.1):\n    return beta * x_t_minus_tau / (1 + x_t_minus_tau**n) - gamma * x_t\n\ndef runge_kutta(x, t, dt, tau, func):\n    k1 = dt * func(x[t], x[t - tau])\n    k2 = dt * func(x[t] + 0.5 * k1, x[t - tau] + 0.5 * k1)\n    k3 = dt * func(x[t] + 0.5 * k2, x[t - tau] + 0.5 * k2)\n    k4 = dt * func(x[t] + k3, x[t - tau] + k3)\n    return x[t] + (k1 + 2 * k2 + 2 * k3 + k4) / 6\n\n# Initial conditions and time step\nx_0 = 1.2\nx_minus_tau = 1\ndt = 0.01\nt_max = 2000\ntau = 17\n\n# Initialize the time series array\ntimesteps = int(t_max / dt) + 1\nx = np.zeros(timesteps + tau)\nx[:tau] = x_minus_tau\nx[tau] = x_0\n\n# Run the simulation\nfor t in range(tau, timesteps - 1):\n    x[t + 1] = runge_kutta(x, t, dt, tau, mackey_glass)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(x[tau:])\n```\n\nThis code will output the time series solution for x(t) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with the given initial conditions and time step.
