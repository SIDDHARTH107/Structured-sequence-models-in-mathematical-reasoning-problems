    "message_1": "A company is considering launching a new product that costs $50 to produce. If the product is successful, it will yield a profit of $150. If it fails, it will result in a loss of -$50. The company can also invest $20 in advertising to increase the chances of success. However, the success of the product also depends on market conditions outside the company's control. There is a 50% chance that the product will be successful if the company invests in advertising, but only a 20% chance if they don't invest in advertising. If the company decides to invest in advertising, what should it signal to the market about the product's potential success to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "If the company decides to invest in advertising, it should signal to the market that the product has a higher potential for success, as the probability of success has increased from 20% to 50% due to the investment in advertising. This positive signal can help attract more customers and further increase the chances of the product's success, ultimately maximizing the company's profit."
