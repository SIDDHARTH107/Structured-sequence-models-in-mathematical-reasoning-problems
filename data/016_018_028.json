    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the middle-third Cantor set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the middle-third Cantor set, at each step, the interval is divided into three equal parts, and the middle third is removed. So, there are N = 2 self-similar pieces (the left and right thirds), and the scaling factor r = 3.\n\nUsing the formula, we get:\n\nD = log(2) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the middle-third Cantor set is approximately 0.6309."
