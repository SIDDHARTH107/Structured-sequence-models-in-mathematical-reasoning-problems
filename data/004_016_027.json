    "message_2": "According to the Mean Value Theorem, if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nLet's denote the position function of the car as s(t), where s is the position in kilometers and t is the time in hours. The car travels from point A to point B in 5 minutes, which is equal to 5/60 = 1/12 hours. The average speed of the car is 60 km/hr.\n\nFirst, we need to find the position function s(t). Since the average speed is 60 km/hr, we can write the position function as:\n\ns(t) = 60t\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of the position function, which represents the instantaneous speed of the car:\n\ns'(t) = 60\n\nAccording to the Mean Value Theorem, there must be a point c in the interval (0, 1/12) such that:\n\ns'(c) = (s(1/12) - s(0)) / (1/12 - 0)\n\nHowever, since s'(t) = 60 for all t, there is no point in the interval (0, 1/12) where the car's speed is 90 km/hr. Therefore, the car never reaches a speed of 90 km/hr during its trip from point A to point B."
