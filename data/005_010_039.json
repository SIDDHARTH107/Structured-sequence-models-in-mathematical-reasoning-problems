    "message_1": "Suppose a factory produces light bulbs with a defect rate of 5%. A quality control inspector randomly selects a box of 50 light bulbs for inspection. What is the probability that the number of defective bulbs in the sample is exactly 3, given a Bayesian prior probability of 0.2 that the defect rate is actually 5%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula and Bayes' theorem. \n\nLet A be the event that the defect rate is 5%, and B be the event that there are exactly 3 defective bulbs in the sample. We want to find the probability P(B|A).\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of getting exactly 3 defective bulbs in the sample, given a 5% defect rate. This can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(B|A) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, 50 light bulbs), k is the number of successes (3 defective bulbs), p is the probability of success (0.05, or 5% defect rate), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nC(50, 3) = 50! / (3! * (50-3)!) = 19600\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(B|A) = 19600 * (0.05)^3 * (0.95)^47 â‰ˆ 0.182\n\nNow, we will use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of having exactly 3 defective bulbs in the sample, given a Bayesian prior probability of 0.2 that the defect rate is actually 5%:\n\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n\nWe already found P(B|A) = 0.182, and we are given P(A) = 0.2. To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:\n\nP(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')\n\nwhere A' is the event that the defect rate is not 5%. We are not given the values for P(B|A') and P(A'), so we cannot find the exact value for P(B). However, since we are only interested in the probability of having exactly 3 defective bulbs given a 5% defect rate, we can focus on P(B|A), which we found to be approximately 0.182 or 18.2%."
