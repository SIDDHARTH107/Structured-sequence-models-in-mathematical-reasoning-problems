    "message_1": "Suppose two parties want to communicate securely using elliptic curve cryptography. The curve being used is y^2 = x^3 + 7 over the finite field Fp where p = 19. If the parties agree that their public points on the curve are (5,1) and (11,9), determine the shared secret key that they can use to encrypt and decrypt their messages.",
    "message_2": "To determine the shared secret key, we need to find the product of each party's private key and the other party's public point. Since we don't have the private keys, we'll assume that the public points are generated by multiplying a base point G by the respective private keys. Let's denote the private keys as a and b, and the public points as A and B. Then, we have:\n\nA = a * G\nB = b * G\n\nThe shared secret key is the product of one party's private key and the other party's public point, which can be represented as:\n\nS = a * B = a * (b * G) = b * A = b * (a * G)\n\nSince both parties have the same shared secret key, we can find the shared secret point by multiplying one public point by the other party's private key. However, we don't have the private keys, so we can't directly compute the shared secret key.\n\nIn practice, the private keys would be known to the respective parties, and they would perform the above calculations to arrive at the shared secret key. The shared secret point's x-coordinate is then used as the shared secret key for encryption and decryption.\n\nWithout the private keys, we cannot determine the shared secret key in this scenario."
