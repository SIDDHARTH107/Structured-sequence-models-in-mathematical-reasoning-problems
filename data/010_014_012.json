    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology groups of the real projective plane $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, we can use the cellular cochain complex. The real projective plane has a CW-complex structure with one cell in each dimension: one 0-cell, one 1-cell, and one 2-cell. The cellular cochain complex is given by:\n\n$$0 \\rightarrow C^0(\\mathbb{R}P^2; \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\xrightarrow{d^0} C^1(\\mathbb{R}P^2; \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\xrightarrow{d^1} C^2(\\mathbb{R}P^2; \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\rightarrow 0$$\n\nSince there is only one cell in each dimension, the cochain groups are all isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The boundary maps $d^0$ and $d^1$ are determined by the attaching maps of the cells. The attaching map of the 1-cell is a 2-fold cover of the 0-cell, so it induces the map $d^0: \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_2$ given by multiplication by 2. However, since we are working with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, multiplication by 2 is the same as multiplication by 0, so $d^0$ is the zero map.\n\nThe attaching map of the 2-cell is a 2-fold cover of the 1-cell, so it also induces a map $d^1: \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_2$ given by multiplication by 2. Again, since we are working with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, this is the zero map.\n\nNow we can compute the cohomology groups:\n\n- $H^0(\\mathbb{R}P^2; \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\ker d^0 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n- $H^1(\\mathbb{R}P^2; \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\ker d^1 / \\operatorname{im} d^0 = \\mathbb{Z}_2 / 0 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n- $H^2(\\mathbb{R}P^2; \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\ker d^2 / \\operatorname{im} d^1 = \\mathbb{Z}_2 / 0 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\nSo the cohomology groups are non-trivial for $k = 0, 1, 2$."
