    "message_2": "Let $z = x + iy$ and $\\bar{z} = x - iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit. Then, we can write $f(z) = (x + iy) + (x - iy) = 2x$. Now, we need to find the harmonic conjugate of $f(z)$, which is a function $g(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$ such that $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are both harmonic functions and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations.\n\nThe Cauchy-Riemann equations are given by:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$\n\nSince $u(x, y) = 2x$, we have:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 2$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find a function $v(x, y)$ that satisfies these equations. From equation (1), we have $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 2$. Integrating with respect to $y$, we get $v(x, y) = 2y + h(x)$, where $h(x)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$.\n\nNow, we use equation (2) to find $h(x)$. We have $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = h'(x)$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0$. So, $h'(x) = 0$. Integrating with respect to $x$, we get $h(x) = C$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nThus, the harmonic conjugate of $f(z)$ is $g(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) = 2x + i(2y + C)$."
