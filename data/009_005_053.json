    "message_1": "A series RLC circuit consists of a 20-ohm resistor, a 0.1 Henries inductor, and a 100μF capacitor. If a 50V AC voltage source is connected to the circuit, find the current passing through the circuit using differential equations. Assume that the initial charge on the capacitor is zero.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll first write the differential equation that describes the voltage across each component in the RLC circuit. Then, we'll solve the differential equation to find the current passing through the circuit.\n\nKirchhoff's voltage law states that the sum of the voltages across each component in a closed loop is equal to the voltage source. In this case, we have:\n\nV(t) = V_R + V_L + V_C\n\nwhere V(t) is the voltage source, V_R is the voltage across the resistor, V_L is the voltage across the inductor, and V_C is the voltage across the capacitor.\n\nThe voltage across the resistor is given by Ohm's law:\n\nV_R = R * I(t)\n\nThe voltage across the inductor is given by:\n\nV_L = L * (dI(t)/dt)\n\nThe voltage across the capacitor is given by:\n\nV_C = 1/C * ∫I(t) dt\n\nNow, we can write the differential equation for the circuit:\n\n50 = 20 * I(t) + 0.1 * (dI(t)/dt) + 1/(100 * 10^(-6)) * ∫I(t) dt\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to time, we get:\n\n0 = 20 * (dI(t)/dt) + 0.1 * (d^2I(t)/dt^2) + 1/(100 * 10^(-6)) * I(t)\n\nNow, we have a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation:\n\n(d^2I(t)/dt^2) + 200 * (dI(t)/dt) + 10^4 * I(t) = 0\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we assume a solution of the form:\n\nI(t) = e^(st)\n\nSubstituting this into the differential equation, we get:\n\n(s^2 + 200s + 10^4) * e^(st) = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\ns^2 + 200s + 10^4 = 0\n\nSolving for s, we get two complex roots:\n\ns1 = -100 + 100i\ns2 = -100 - 100i\n\nThe general solution for the current is:\n\nI(t) = e^(-100t) * (A * cos(100t) + B * sin(100t))\n\nSince the initial charge on the capacitor is zero, the initial current is also zero:\n\nI(0) = 0 = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0)\nA = 0\n\nSo, the current in the circuit is:\n\nI(t) = B * e^(-100t) * sin(100t)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of B. To do this, we'll use the initial condition for the voltage across the capacitor:\n\nV_C(0) = 50 = 1/(100 * 10^(-6)) * ∫I(t) dt\n\nIntegrating I(t) with respect to time, we get:\n\n∫I(t) dt = -B * e^(-100t) * (sin(100t) + cos(100t))\n\nEvaluating the integral from 0 to infinity, we get:\n\n50 = 1/(100 * 10^(-6)) * (-B)\n\nSolving for B, we get:\n\nB = -50 * (100 * 10^(-6))\nB = -0.005\n\nSo, the current in the circuit is:\n\nI(t) = -0.005 * e^(-100t) * sin(100t) A"
