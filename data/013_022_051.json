    "message_1": "Suppose a Dictator Game is played between two persons. The first person, the dictator, is given 100 tokens and must decide how many tokens to give to the second person, the recipient. If the recipient accepts the offer, they each keep their allocated tokens. However, if the recipient rejects the offer, neither player receives any tokens. If the recipient is indifferent between accepting and rejecting an offer, they will accept the offer. Assuming both players are rational, what is the optimal amount of tokens that the dictator should offer to the recipient to maximize their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, the recipient has no power to reject the offer, unlike the Ultimatum Game. Therefore, the dictator can offer any amount of tokens to the recipient without fear of rejection. Since the dictator wants to maximize their own payoff, they can offer the smallest possible amount of tokens to the recipient, which is 0 tokens. This way, the dictator keeps all 100 tokens for themselves, maximizing their own payoff."
