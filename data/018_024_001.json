    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 3, 4, 5}. Find the symmetric difference of the two sets A and B, denoted A △ B, and then find the complement of the set A △ B, denoted A △ B'. Finally, find A' △ B' and compare it with A △ B'. Does the result support the statement that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement? Justify your conclusion.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of the two sets A and B, denoted A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, A △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\nA △ B = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the set A △ B, denoted A △ B'. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. Assuming the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B, U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. \n\nA △ B' = U - (A △ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 5} = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNext, let's find the complements of sets A and B, denoted A' and B', respectively.\n\nA' = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 2, 3, 4} = {5}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4, 5} = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the complements of sets A and B, denoted A' △ B'.\n\nA' △ B' = (A' ∪ B') - (A' ∩ B') = ({5} ∪ {1}) - ({5} ∩ {1}) = {1, 5} - {} = {1, 5}\n\nComparing A' △ B' with A △ B', we have:\n\nA' △ B' = {1, 5}\nA △ B' = {2, 3, 4}\n\nSince A' △ B' ≠ A △ B', the result supports the statement that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement. In other words, (A △ B)' ≠ A' △ B'."
