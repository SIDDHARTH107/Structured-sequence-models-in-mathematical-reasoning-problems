    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the space curve, we need to compute the first and second derivatives of the parametric equation, and then use the formulas for curvature (k) and torsion (τ).\n\nFirst, let's find the first and second derivatives of r(t):\n\nr(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), 3t)\nr'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 3)\nr''(t) = (-cos(t), -sin(t), 0)\n\nNow, let's evaluate r'(t) and r''(t) at t = pi/2:\n\nr'(pi/2) = (-sin(pi/2), cos(pi/2), 3) = (0, 1, 3)\nr''(pi/2) = (-cos(pi/2), -sin(pi/2), 0) = (-1, 0, 0)\n\nNext, we will find the curvature (k) using the formula:\n\nk = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nFirst, let's compute the cross product r'(t) x r''(t):\n\nr'(t) x r''(t) = (1 * 0 - 3 * 0, 3 * (-1) - 0 * 0, 0 * (-1) - 1 * 1) = (0, -3, -1)\n\nNow, let's compute the magnitude of r'(t):\n\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt(0^2 + 1^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(10)\n\nNow, let's compute the curvature:\n\nk = ||(0, -3, -1)|| / (sqrt(10))^3\nk = sqrt(0^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) / 10^(3/2)\nk = sqrt(10) / 1000\n\nNow, let's find the torsion (τ) using the formula:\n\nτ = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nFirst, let's find the third derivative of r(t):\n\nr'''(t) = (sin(t), -cos(t), 0)\n\nNow, let's evaluate r'''(t) at t = pi/2:\n\nr'''(pi/2) = (sin(pi/2), -cos(pi/2), 0) = (1, 0, 0)\n\nNow, let's compute the dot product (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t):\n\n(0, -3, -1) • (1, 0, 0) = 0\n\nFinally, let's compute the torsion:\n\nτ = 0 / ||(0, -3, -1)||^2\nτ = 0 / (0^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2)\nτ = 0 / 10\n\nSo, the curvature k = sqrt(10) / 1000 and the torsion τ = 0 at t = pi/2."
