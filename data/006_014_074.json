    "message_1": "Let's say in a data center, there are 100 servers and the probability of a server failure is 0.05. What is the probability that exactly 6 servers will fail at the same time?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the total number of servers (100), k is the number of failed servers we're interested in (6), p is the probability of a server failing (0.05), and (n choose k) is the number of combinations of choosing k failures from n servers.\n\nFirst, let's calculate (n choose k), which is:\n\n(n choose k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\n(100 choose 6) = 100! / (6! * 94!)\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 6) = (100 choose 6) * (0.05)^6 * (1-0.05)^(100-6)\n\nP(X = 6) = (100! / (6! * 94!)) * (0.05)^6 * (0.95)^94\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the factorials and probabilities, we get:\n\nP(X = 6) â‰ˆ 0.1291\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 6 servers will fail at the same time is approximately 12.91%."
