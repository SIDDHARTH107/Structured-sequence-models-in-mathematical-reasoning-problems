    "message_2": "To determine if G is isomorphic to C10, D5, or a non-abelian group of order 10, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of order 10 has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, by Sylow's Theorems.\n2. If a group has a unique Sylow p-subgroup, then that subgroup is normal.\n3. The order of an element in a group divides the order of the group.\n\nLet P be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G, and let Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since G has order 10, we have |P| = 5 and |Q| = 2. By facts 1 and 2, both P and Q are normal subgroups of G.\n\nNow, consider the product PQ. Since P and Q are normal, the product PQ is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since |P| and |Q| are relatively prime, we have |PQ| = |P||Q| = 10, which implies that PQ = G.\n\nLet p be a generator of P, and let q be a generator of Q. Then G = <p, q>, and every element of G can be written as a product of powers of p and q. Since the order of p is 5 and the order of q is 2, we have p^5 = e and q^2 = e, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, we will consider the commutator [p, q] = p^(-1)q^(-1)pq. Since P is normal, we have qp = p^kq for some integer k. Therefore, [p, q] = p^(-1)q^(-1)p^kq = p^(-1+k)p^(-1) = p^(k-2). Since the order of p is 5, we have k-2 ≡ 0 (mod 5), which implies k ≡ 2 (mod 5).\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: k = 2\nIn this case, qp = p^2q, and G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5. This is because the dihedral group D5 has a presentation <r, s | r^5 = s^2 = e, sr = r^2s>, which matches the relations we found for p and q.\n\nCase 2: k = 7\nIn this case, qp = p^7q = p^(-3)q, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10. This is because the cyclic group C10 has a presentation <x | x^10 = e>, and we can take x = pq. Then x^10 = (pq)^10 = p^10q^10 = e, since p^5 = q^2 = e.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C10 or the dihedral group D5. There is no non-abelian group of order 10 that is distinct from D5, so G cannot be isomorphic to a different non-abelian group of order 10."
