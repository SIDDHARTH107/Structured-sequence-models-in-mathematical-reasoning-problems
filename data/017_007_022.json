    "message_2": "First, let's recall some basic facts about groups:\n\n1. A group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element, called a generator.\n2. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where a is the element, e is the identity element, and a^n denotes the product of a with itself n times.\n3. Lagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group G divides the order of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the group G of order 6. By Cauchy's theorem, there must exist an element of order 2 and an element of order 3 in G. Let a be an element of order 2 and b be an element of order 3.\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\n\nIf G is cyclic, then there exists an element g in G such that G = {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5}, where e is the identity element. In this case, the order of g is 6, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6. The isomorphism can be given by the mapping φ: G → C6, where φ(g^k) = k mod 6 for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 5.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\n\nIf G is not cyclic, then no element in G has order 6. Since we already have elements of order 2 and 3, the only possibility for the orders of the elements in G is 1 (the identity), 2, and 3. \n\nLet's consider the subgroup H generated by b, which has order 3. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of H must divide the order of G, so |H| = 3. Thus, H = {e, b, b^2}. Since G has 6 elements and H has 3, there must be 3 more elements in G that are not in H. Let's denote these elements by x, y, and z.\n\nNow, let's consider the element a. Since a has order 2, a^2 = e. Also, a is not in H, so a must be one of the elements x, y, or z. Without loss of generality, let a = x. Then G = {e, b, b^2, x, y, z}.\n\nSince G is a group, it must be closed under the group operation. Thus, the products xb, x(b^2), and x^2 must be in G. We know that x^2 = e, and xb and x(b^2) cannot be equal to b or b^2, as x is not in H. Therefore, xb and x(b^2) must be equal to y and z (in some order). \n\nNow, we can define a multiplication table for G:\n\n```\n   | e  b  b^2  x  y   z\n---+---------------------\n e | e  b  b^2  x  y   z\n b | b b^2  e   y  z   x\nb^2|b^2 e  b   z  x   y\n x | x  y  z   e  b  b^2\n y | y  z  x  b^2 e   b\n z | z  x  y   b b^2  e\n```\n\nThis multiplication table defines a group isomorphic to the dihedral group D3. The isomorphism can be given by the mapping ψ: G → D3, where ψ(e) = R0, ψ(b) = R120, ψ(b^2) = R240, ψ(x) = F1, ψ(y) = F2, and ψ(z) = F3 (Rk denotes a rotation by k degrees, and Fj denotes a reflection about a specific axis).\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 6, it must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
