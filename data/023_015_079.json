    "message_2": "To find the components and amplitudes of the frequency spectrum for the given signal using the Fourier transform, we first need to identify the frequencies and their corresponding coefficients in the time-domain function f(t).\n\nThe given function is:\n\nf(t) = sin(2*pi*50*t) + 0.5*sin(2*pi*120*t)\n\nHere, we have two sinusoidal components with frequencies 50 Hz and 120 Hz. The coefficients (amplitudes) for these frequencies are 1 and 0.5, respectively.\n\nNow, let's represent the function f(t) in the frequency domain using the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a continuous-time sinusoidal signal is given by a pair of impulses located at the positive and negative frequencies of the sinusoid.\n\nFor the first component, sin(2*pi*50*t), the Fourier transform will have impulses at ±50 Hz with amplitudes of 1/2 (since the amplitude of the sinusoid is 1).\n\nFor the second component, 0.5*sin(2*pi*120*t), the Fourier transform will have impulses at ±120 Hz with amplitudes of 0.5/2 (since the amplitude of the sinusoid is 0.5).\n\nTherefore, the frequency spectrum of the given signal f(t) will have the following components and amplitudes:\n\n- At ±50 Hz: Amplitude = 1/2\n- At ±120 Hz: Amplitude = 0.5/2 = 1/4\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the given signal f(t) will have impulses at ±50 Hz and ±120 Hz with amplitudes of 1/2 and 1/4, respectively."
