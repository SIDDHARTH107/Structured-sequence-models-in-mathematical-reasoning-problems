    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 4)/(x - 2) as x approaches 2, we can first try to simplify the function. We can factor the numerator:\n\nx^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)\n\nSo the function can be rewritten as:\n\nf(x) = ((x - 2)(x + 2))/(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the (x - 2) terms:\n\nf(x) = x + 2\n\nNow that the function is simplified, we can find the limit as x approaches 2:\n\nlim (x -> 2) (x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 4)/(x - 2) as x approaches 2 is 4."
