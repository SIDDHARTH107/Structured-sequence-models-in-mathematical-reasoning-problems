    "message_1": "A rectangular sheet of cardboard measuring 64 cm by 36 cm has squares of equal size cut out from each corner. The cut-out corners are then folded upwards to form an open rectangular box. Determine the length of the side of the square cut-out so that the box has the maximum possible volume.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the length of the side of the square cut-out. After cutting out the squares and folding, the dimensions of the open rectangular box will be (64-2x) cm by (36-2x) cm by x cm.\n\nThe volume V of the box can be expressed as a function of x:\n\nV(x) = x(64-2x)(36-2x)\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points of the function V(x) by taking its derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndV/dx = (64-2x)(36-2x) - 2x(36-2x) - 2x(64-2x) = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation:\n\ndV/dx = -8x^3 + 200x^2 - 2304x = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by solving for x:\n\n-8x(x^2 - 25x + 288) = 0\n\nThe first critical point is x = 0, which corresponds to no cut-out squares and thus no box. The other critical points are the solutions to the quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 25x + 288 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (25 ± √(25^2 - 4 * 288)) / 2\nx = (25 ± √337) / 2\n\nThe two possible values for x are approximately 8.1 cm and 35.4 cm. However, since the width of the cardboard is only 36 cm, the 35.4 cm cut-out is not possible. Therefore, the length of the side of the square cut-out that maximizes the volume of the box is approximately 8.1 cm."
