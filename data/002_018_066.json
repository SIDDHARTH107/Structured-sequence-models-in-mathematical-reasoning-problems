    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to find its radius. Since the sphere touches all six faces of the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Side length of the cube = 5 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2:\n\nRadius of the sphere = Diameter / 2 = 5 cm / 2 = 2.5 cm\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\nVolume of the sphere = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nVolume of the sphere = (4/3) * π * (2.5 cm)^3\nVolume of the sphere ≈ (4/3) * π * 15.625 cm^3\nVolume of the sphere ≈ 20.833 * π cm^3\nVolume of the sphere ≈ 65.45 cm^3\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 65.45 cm^3."
