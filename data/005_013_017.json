    "message_1": "In a statistics class, a professor has given a group of 10 students a midterm and final exam. The scores on the midterm exam range from 60 to 95, with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 10. The scores on the final exam range from 65 to 90, with a mean of 85 and a standard deviation of 8. Calculate the correlation between the midterm and final exam scores of the 10 students.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation between the midterm and final exam scores, we need to find the covariance between the two sets of scores and then divide it by the product of their standard deviations. However, we do not have enough information to calculate the covariance directly. We need the individual scores for each student on both exams to calculate the covariance and subsequently the correlation.\n\nIf we had the individual scores, we could follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the midterm scores (already given as 80) and the mean of the final exam scores (already given as 85).\n2. Subtract the mean from each individual score to get the deviations for both exams.\n3. Multiply the deviations for each student's midterm and final exam scores.\n4. Sum the products of the deviations and divide by the number of students (10) to get the covariance.\n5. Divide the covariance by the product of the standard deviations (10 for midterm and 8 for final exam) to get the correlation.\n\nWithout the individual scores, we cannot calculate the correlation between the midterm and final exam scores for the 10 students."
