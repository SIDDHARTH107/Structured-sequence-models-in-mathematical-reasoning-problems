    "message_1": "A city has two main roads: Road A and Road B. The probability of a car accident happening on Road A in a month is 0.08 and the probability of a car accident happening on Road B in a month is 0.12. What is the probability of a car accident happening on at least one of these two roads in a month?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a car accident happening on at least one of these two roads in a month, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nHowever, we don't have the probability of a car accident happening on both roads in a month (P(A ∩ B)). Since we don't have any information about the dependence or independence of these events, we cannot directly calculate P(A ∩ B).\n\nIf we assume that the events are independent, meaning that the occurrence of a car accident on one road does not affect the occurrence of a car accident on the other road, then we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two independent events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B)\n\nPlugging in the given probabilities:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.08 + 0.12 - (0.08 * 0.12)\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.08 + 0.12 - 0.0096\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.1904\n\nSo, if we assume that the events are independent, the probability of a car accident happening on at least one of these two roads in a month is 0.1904 or 19.04%."
