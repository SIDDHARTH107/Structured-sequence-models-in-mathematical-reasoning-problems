    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of a vector along a curve, we need to solve the following equation:\n\n∇_r'(t) V(t) = 0\n\nwhere ∇ is the covariant derivative, r'(t) is the tangent vector of the curve, and V(t) is the vector field along the curve.\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector r'(t) by differentiating r(t) with respect to t:\n\nr'(t) = (-sin t, cos t, 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the covariant derivative of V(t) along r'(t). Since we are working in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, the covariant derivative is the same as the ordinary derivative. So, we need to find a vector field V(t) = (V1(t), V2(t), V3(t)) such that:\n\ndV1/dt = -sin t * dV1/dx + cos t * dV1/dy + dV1/dz\ndV2/dt = -sin t * dV2/dx + cos t * dV2/dy + dV2/dz\ndV3/dt = -sin t * dV3/dx + cos t * dV3/dy + dV3/dz\n\nWe are given the initial vector v = (1, 2, 3) at the point r(0) = (1, 0, 0). Thus, V(0) = (1, 2, 3).\n\nNow, let's integrate the above system of equations to find V(t):\n\nV1(t) = cos t + C1(t)\nV2(t) = sin t + C2(t)\nV3(t) = t + C3(t)\n\nwhere C1(t), C2(t), and C3(t) are functions of t.\n\nWe know that V(0) = (1, 2, 3), so:\n\n1 = cos 0 + C1(0) => C1(0) = 0\n2 = sin 0 + C2(0) => C2(0) = 2\n3 = 0 + C3(0) => C3(0) = 3\n\nThus, the vector field V(t) is given by:\n\nV(t) = (cos t, sin t + 2, t + 3)\n\nNow, we need to find the resulting vector at the point r(π/2). We have:\n\nV(π/2) = (cos(π/2), sin(π/2) + 2, (π/2) + 3) = (0, 1 + 2, (π/2) + 3) = (0, 3, (π/2) + 3)\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the vector v = (1, 2, 3) along the curve r(t) = (cos t, sin t, t) is given by the vector (0, 3, (π/2) + 3) at the point r(π/2)."
