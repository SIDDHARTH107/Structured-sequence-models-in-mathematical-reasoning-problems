    "message_1": "A factory produces 2000 units of a product every day. There is a 1% chance that any unit produced will be defective. Assuming each unit produced is independent of the others, calculate the probability that there will be exactly 30 defective units produced in a day.",
    "message_2": "We can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x defective units\n- C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (n choose x)\n- n is the total number of units produced (2000 in this case)\n- x is the number of defective units (30 in this case)\n- p is the probability of a unit being defective (0.01 in this case)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(2000, 30), which is the number of ways to choose 30 defective units out of 2000:\n\nC(2000, 30) = 2000! / (30! * (2000-30)!)\n\nNext, we need to calculate p^x and (1-p)^(n-x):\n\np^x = 0.01^30\n(1-p)^(n-x) = (1-0.01)^(2000-30) = 0.99^1970\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(30) = C(2000, 30) * 0.01^30 * 0.99^1970\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values, we get:\n\nP(30) â‰ˆ 0.0274\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 30 defective units produced in a day is approximately 2.74%."
