    "message_2": "To find the probability that both Team A and Team B make a 3-point shot in the next possession, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each event occurring.\n\nProbability of Team A making a 3-point shot = 0.4\nProbability of Team B making a 3-point shot = 0.3\n\nProbability of both events occurring = (Probability of Team A making a 3-point shot) * (Probability of Team B making a 3-point shot)\n\nProbability of both events occurring = 0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12\n\nSo, the probability that Team A and Team B both make a 3-point shot in the next possession is 0.12 or 12%."
