    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve doubles with each iteration.\n\nLet's calculate the total length of the curve after 8 iterations:\n\nIteration 1: Length = 1 (initial length)\nIteration 2: Length = 1 * 2 = 2\nIteration 3: Length = 2 * 2 = 4\nIteration 4: Length = 4 * 2 = 8\nIteration 5: Length = 8 * 2 = 16\nIteration 6: Length = 16 * 2 = 32\nIteration 7: Length = 32 * 2 = 64\nIteration 8: Length = 64 * 2 = 128\n\nAfter 8 iterations, the total length of the Dragon curve is 128."
