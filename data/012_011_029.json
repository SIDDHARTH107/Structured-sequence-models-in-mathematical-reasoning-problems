    "message_2": "To find the number of cut vertices and bridges in the graph, we need more information about the specific connections between the nodes. However, I can provide you with a general approach to solve this problem.\n\n1. Cut Vertices:\nA cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. To find the cut vertices, you can use the following algorithm:\n\n- Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) on the graph and assign a discovery time and a low value to each vertex.\n- A vertex is a cut vertex if it is the root of the DFS tree and has at least two children, or if it is not the root and has a child v such that there is no back edge from v or any of its descendants to an ancestor of the current vertex.\n\n2. Bridges:\nA bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. To find the bridges, you can use the following algorithm:\n\n- Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) on the graph and assign a discovery time and a low value to each vertex.\n- An edge (u, v) is a bridge if the low value of v is greater than the discovery time of u.\n\nPlease provide the specific connections between the nodes in the graph, and I can help you find the cut vertices and bridges."
