    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow Theorems. Let G be a group of order 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers.\n\nBy the First Sylow Theorem, there exist Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups in G. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 7-subgroup. Then, the orders of P and Q are 5 and 7, respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups in G. By the Third Sylow Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n_5 divides 7 and n_5 = 1 or 7. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. Thus, n_7 divides 5 and n_7 = 1 or 5.\n\nCase 1: n_5 = n_7 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup in G. Let P and Q be these unique subgroups. Since P and Q are unique, they are both normal in G. Now, we have |P ∩ Q| = 1, as the intersection of P and Q can only be the identity element. Thus, we can form the direct product of P and Q, which is a subgroup of G of order |P| * |Q| = 5 * 7 = 35. Since this subgroup has the same order as G, it must be equal to G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups of order 5 and 7.\n\nCase 2: n_5 = 1 and n_7 = 5 (or n_5 = 7 and n_7 = 1)\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume n_5 = 1 and n_7 = 5. In this case, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, P, which is normal in G. Since there are multiple Sylow 7-subgroups, Q is not necessarily normal in G. However, we can still consider the set {pq | p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}, which forms a subgroup of G of order 5 * 7 = 35. Since this subgroup has the same order as G, it must be equal to G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups of order 5 and 7.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that G is either cyclic (if G is the direct product of cyclic groups of order 5 and 7 and one of the generators has order 35) or isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups of order 5 and 7."
