    "message_2": "To find the velocity and acceleration of the ball at t = 2 seconds, we need to find the first and second derivatives of the height function h(t) with respect to time t.\n\nThe height function is given by:\nh(t) = -4.9t^2 + 20t\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of h(t) with respect to t, which represents the velocity function v(t):\nv(t) = dh/dt = d(-4.9t^2 + 20t)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\nv(t) = -9.8t + 20\n\nNow, let's find the velocity at t = 2 seconds:\nv(2) = -9.8(2) + 20\nv(2) = -19.6 + 20\nv(2) = 0.4 m/s\n\nNext, let's find the second derivative of h(t) with respect to t, which represents the acceleration function a(t):\na(t) = dv/dt = d(-9.8t + 20)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\na(t) = -9.8\n\nThe acceleration function a(t) is a constant, so the acceleration at t = 2 seconds is the same as the acceleration at any other time:\na(2) = -9.8 m/s²\n\nSo, at t = 2 seconds, the velocity of the ball is 0.4 m/s and the acceleration is -9.8 m/s²."
