If a student has a height of 180 cm, what is the predicted weight based on the regression line?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the regression line for predicting weight from height, we can use the formula:\n\ny = a + bx\n\nwhere y is the predicted weight, x is the height, a is the y-intercept, and b is the slope of the line.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slope (b) using the formula:\n\nb = r * (Sy / Sx)\n\nwhere r is the correlation coefficient, Sy is the standard deviation of the weights, and Sx is the standard deviation of the heights.\n\nb = 0.6 * (8 / 5)\nb = 0.6 * 1.6\nb = 0.96\n\nNext, we need to find the y-intercept (a) using the formula:\n\na = Y - bX\n\nwhere Y is the mean weight and X is the mean height.\n\na = 70 - (0.96 * 170)\na = 70 - 163.2\na = -93.2\n\nNow we have the equation of the regression line:\n\ny = -93.2 + 0.96x\n\nTo predict the weight of a student with a height of 180 cm, we can plug the height into the equation:\n\ny = -93.2 + 0.96 * 180\ny = -93.2 + 172.8\ny = 79.6\n\nSo, the predicted weight for a student with a height of 180 cm is 79.6 kg."
