    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph G is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. To find the edge connectivity, we can use the formula:\n\nEdge connectivity (Î») = min{degree(v)} for all vertices v in G\n\nwhere degree(v) is the number of edges connected to vertex v.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information about the specific graph G to determine the degree of each vertex. If you can provide more information about the graph or its structure, I can help you find the edge connectivity."
