    "message_2": "Bell numbers are used to count the number of ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets. In this case, we have 7 people, so we want to find the Bell number for n = 7.\n\nThe first few Bell numbers are: B0 = 1, B1 = 1, B2 = 2, B3 = 5, B4 = 15, B5 = 52, B6 = 203, and B7 = 877.\n\nSo, there are 877 different ways to split 7 people into teams for a game using Bell numbers."
