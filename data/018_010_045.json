    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n1. A x B = {(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c)}\n2. A x {c} = {(1, c), (2, c)}\n3. A ∪ {2} = {1, 2} (since 2 is already in A)\n4. (A ∪ {2}) x B = A x B (since A ∪ {2} is just A)\n\nNow, let's find the unions:\n\n1. (A x B) ∪ (A x {c}) = {(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c)} (since A x {c} is a subset of A x B)\n2. (A ∪ {2}) x B = A x B = {(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c)}\n\nNow, let's prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over union. Let C be an arbitrary set. We want to show that (A ∪ C) x B = (A x B) ∪ (C x B).\n\nProof:\n\nLet (x, y) be an element in (A ∪ C) x B. Then x is in A ∪ C and y is in B. There are two cases:\n\n1. x is in A: In this case, (x, y) is in A x B, so (x, y) is in (A x B) ∪ (C x B).\n2. x is in C: In this case, (x, y) is in C x B, so (x, y) is in (A x B) ∪ (C x B).\n\nIn either case, (x, y) is in (A x B) ∪ (C x B). Therefore, (A ∪ C) x B is a subset of (A x B) ∪ (C x B).\n\nNow, let (x, y) be an element in (A x B) ∪ (C x B). There are two cases:\n\n1. (x, y) is in A x B: In this case, x is in A and y is in B, so x is in A ∪ C and (x, y) is in (A ∪ C) x B.\n2. (x, y) is in C x B: In this case, x is in C and y is in B, so x is in A ∪ C and (x, y) is in (A ∪ C) x B.\n\nIn either case, (x, y) is in (A ∪ C) x B. Therefore, (A x B) ∪ (C x B) is a subset of (A ∪ C) x B.\n\nSince both sets are subsets of each other, we can conclude that (A ∪ C) x B = (A x B) ∪ (C x B). This proves that the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over union."
