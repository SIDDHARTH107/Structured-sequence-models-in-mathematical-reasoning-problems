    "message_1": "Suppose a principal hires an agent who is capable of completing a task with a cost of $800. The agent has two effort levels he can exert: low effort and high effort. If the agent exerts low effort, the total cost incurred will be $1200. If he exerts high effort, the total cost incurred will be $1000. However, the agent's true effort level is not observable by the principal. The principal believes there is a 50% chance the agent will exert high effort and a 50% chance the agent will exert low effort. If the principal gives the agent a flat fee of $900 for completing the task, which effort level would the agent choose and what would be the principal's expected profit from this transaction?\n\n(Solve the problem using the framework of the principal-agent problem in game theory.)",
    "message_2": "In this principal-agent problem, the agent will choose the effort level that maximizes his payoff. The agent's payoff is the difference between the flat fee he receives and the cost incurred for exerting a certain effort level.\n\nIf the agent exerts low effort, his payoff will be:\nPayoff_low_effort = $900 (flat fee) - $1200 (cost) = -$300\n\nIf the agent exerts high effort, his payoff will be:\nPayoff_high_effort = $900 (flat fee) - $1000 (cost) = -$100\n\nSince the agent's payoff is higher when exerting high effort, he will choose to exert high effort.\n\nNow, let's calculate the principal's expected profit from this transaction. The principal's profit is the difference between the value of the completed task and the flat fee paid to the agent. We assume the value of the completed task is $800.\n\nSince the agent will exert high effort, the principal's expected profit will be:\nExpected_profit = $800 (value of completed task) - $900 (flat fee) = -$100\n\nSo, the principal's expected profit from this transaction is -$100."
