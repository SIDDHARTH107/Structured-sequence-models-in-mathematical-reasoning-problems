    "message_2": "To prove that the group G is isomorphic to one of the given groups, we will first analyze the structure of G and then find a suitable isomorphism.\n\n1. Analyzing the structure of G:\n\nLet's find the orders of the elements in G:\n\n- Order of 1 is 1 (identity element).\n- Order of a is 2 (a * a = 1).\n- Order of b is 3 (b * b * b = 1).\n- Order of c is 4 (c * c * c * c = 1).\n- Order of d is 6 (d * d * d * d * d * d = 1).\n- Order of e is 4 (e * e * e * e = 1).\n- Order of f is 6 (f * f * f * f * f * f = 1).\n- Order of g is 6 (g * g * g * g * g * g = 1).\n- Order of h is 4 (h * h * h * h = 1).\n- Order of i is 6 (i * i * i * i * i * i = 1).\n- Order of j is 4 (j * j * j * j = 1).\n- Order of k is 6 (k * k * k * k * k * k = 1).\n\nNow let's compare the structure of G with the given groups:\n\n- C12: A cyclic group of order 12 should have an element of order 12, but G does not have any element of order 12. So, G is not isomorphic to C12.\n- A4: The alternating group A4 has 12 elements, with 3 elements of order 2 and 8 elements of order 3. However, G has only 1 element of order 2 and 6 elements of order 6. So, G is not isomorphic to A4.\n- D6: The dihedral group D6 has 12 elements, with 6 elements of order 2 and 6 elements of order 6. This matches the structure of G. So, G might be isomorphic to D6.\n\n2. Finding a suitable isomorphism:\n\nSince G seems to be isomorphic to D6, let's find a suitable isomorphism between them. Recall that D6 can be represented as the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon, with elements {r^i * s^j | 0 ≤ i < 6, 0 ≤ j < 2}, where r is a rotation and s is a reflection.\n\nDefine a mapping φ: G → D6 as follows:\n\n- φ(1) = r^0 * s^0\n- φ(a) = r^0 * s^1\n- φ(b) = r^1 * s^0\n- φ(c) = r^2 * s^0\n- φ(d) = r^3 * s^0\n- φ(e) = r^4 * s^0\n- φ(f) = r^5 * s^0\n- φ(g) = r^1 * s^1\n- φ(h) = r^2 * s^1\n- φ(i) = r^3 * s^1\n- φ(j) = r^4 * s^1\n- φ(k) = r^5 * s^1\n\nWe can verify that φ is an isomorphism by checking that it preserves the group operation:\n\nFor any two elements x, y in G, φ(xy) = φ(x) * φ(y). For example, let's check for x = b and y = c:\n\nφ(bc) = φ(h) = r^2 * s^1\nφ(b) * φ(c) = (r^1 * s^0) * (r^2 * s^0) = r^3 * s^0 = r^2 * s^1\n\nSince φ(xy) = φ(x) * φ(y) for all x, y in G, φ is an isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, the group G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6."
