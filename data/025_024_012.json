    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose we have three points in a plane with coordinates (-1, 2), (4, 5), and (2, -1). Find the equation of the line such that the sum of the distances from each point to the line is minimized. Use geometric invariant theory to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using geometric invariant theory, we will first find the centroid of the three points, which is the average of their coordinates. Then, we will find the direction vector of the line that passes through the centroid and is orthogonal to the direction vector of the line connecting the first and third points. Finally, we will find the equation of the line that passes through the centroid and has the direction vector we found.\n\n1. Find the centroid of the three points:\nCentroid = ((-1 + 4 + 2)/3, (2 + 5 - 1)/3) = (5/3, 6/3) = (5/3, 2)\n\n2. Find the direction vector of the line connecting the first and third points:\nDirection vector = (2 - (-1), -1 - 2) = (3, -3)\n\n3. Find the direction vector orthogonal to the line connecting the first and third points:\nOrthogonal direction vector = (-3, -3)\n\n4. Find the equation of the line that passes through the centroid and has the orthogonal direction vector:\nThe equation of the line in point-slope form is:\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is the centroid (5/3, 2) and m is the slope of the line. The slope can be found using the orthogonal direction vector:\nm = -3/-3 = 1\n\nNow, plug in the centroid and slope into the point-slope form:\ny - 2 = 1(x - 5/3)\n\n5. Simplify the equation to get the final answer:\ny - 2 = x - 5/3\ny = x - 5/3 + 2\ny = x - 5/3 + 6/3\ny = x + 1/3\n\nSo, the equation of the line that minimizes the sum of the distances from the three points is y = x + 1/3."
