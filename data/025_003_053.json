    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point [1:1:1:1], we first need to find the partial derivatives of the defining polynomials with respect to the variables x, y, z, and w.\n\nLet F(x, y, z, w) = xz - y^2 and G(x, y, z, w) = xz - w^2. The intersection of the projective varieties is defined by F(x, y, z, w) = G(x, y, z, w) = 0.\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = z\n∂F/∂y = -2y\n∂F/∂z = x\n∂F/∂w = 0\n\n∂G/∂x = z\n∂G/∂y = 0\n∂G/∂z = x\n∂G/∂w = -2w\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point [1:1:1:1]:\n\n∂F/∂x(1,1,1,1) = 1\n∂F/∂y(1,1,1,1) = -2\n∂F/∂z(1,1,1,1) = 1\n∂F/∂w(1,1,1,1) = 0\n\n∂G/∂x(1,1,1,1) = 1\n∂G/∂y(1,1,1,1) = 0\n∂G/∂z(1,1,1,1) = 1\n∂G/∂w(1,1,1,1) = -2\n\nNow, we can form the Jacobian matrix:\n\nJ = |  1  -2   1   0 |\n    |  1   0   1  -2 |\n\nThe tangent space to the curve at the point [1:1:1:1] is the null space of the Jacobian matrix. To find the null space, we can row reduce the matrix:\n\n|  1  -2   1   0 | ~ |  1  -2   1   0 |\n|  1   0   1  -2 |   |  0   2   0  -2 |\n\nRow reducing further:\n\n|  1  -2   1   0 |\n|  0   1   0  -1 |\n\nNow, we can read off the null space from the row reduced matrix:\n\nx - 2y + z = 0\ny - w = 0\n\nThus, the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point [1:1:1:1] in projective space is given by the intersection of these two planes:\n\n[x:y:z:w] = [2y - z : y : z : y]"
