    "message_2": "Let A be a set with 4 distinct elements, i.e., A = {a, b, c, d}. The power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself.\n\nTo prove that P(A) is larger than A, we can simply list all the elements of P(A) and count them. The elements of P(A) are:\n\n1. The empty set: {} (1 element)\n2. Single-element subsets: {a}, {b}, {c}, {d} (4 elements)\n3. Two-element subsets: {a, b}, {a, c}, {a, d}, {b, c}, {b, d}, {c, d} (6 elements)\n4. Three-element subsets: {a, b, c}, {a, b, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d} (4 elements)\n5. The set A itself: {a, b, c, d} (1 element)\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 16 elements in P(A).\n\nSince A has 4 elements and P(A) has 16 elements, it is clear that the power set of A is larger than the set A itself."
