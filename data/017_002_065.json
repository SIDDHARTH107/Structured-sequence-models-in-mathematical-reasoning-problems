    "message_2": "Let G be a cyclic group of order 12, and let g be a generator of G. That is, G = {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^11}. Since G is cyclic, any subgroup of G will also be cyclic.\n\nThe divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G, which is 12. Therefore, the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\n1. The subgroup of order 1 is {g^0} = {e}, where e is the identity element. This subgroup is cyclic, as it contains only one element.\n\n2. For the subgroup of order 2, we have the element g^(12/2) = g^6. The subgroup generated by g^6 is {e, g^6}, which is cyclic.\n\n3. For the subgroup of order 3, we have the element g^(12/3) = g^4. The subgroup generated by g^4 is {e, g^4, g^8}, which is cyclic.\n\n4. For the subgroup of order 4, we have the element g^(12/4) = g^3. The subgroup generated by g^3 is {e, g^3, g^6, g^9}, which is cyclic.\n\n5. For the subgroup of order 6, we have the element g^(12/6) = g^2. The subgroup generated by g^2 is {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8, g^10}, which is cyclic.\n\n6. The subgroup of order 12 is G itself, which is cyclic by definition.\n\nIn summary, the possible subgroups of G are:\n\n1. {e}\n2. {e, g^6}\n3. {e, g^4, g^8}\n4. {e, g^3, g^6, g^9}\n5. {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8, g^10}\n6. G = {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^11}\n\nEach of these subgroups is cyclic, as shown above."
