    "message_2": "To find the average value of a continuous function on a given interval, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = sin(x), and the interval is [0, pi/2]. So, a = 0 and b = pi/2.\n\nAverage value = (1/(pi/2 - 0)) * ∫[0, pi/2] sin(x) dx\nAverage value = (2/pi) * ∫[0, pi/2] sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of sin(x) from 0 to pi/2:\n\n∫ sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral at the bounds:\n\n[-cos(pi/2) + cos(0)] = [-0 + 1] = 1\n\nNow, we'll multiply this result by the (2/pi) term:\n\nAverage value = (2/pi) * 1 = 2/pi\n\nSo, the average value of sin(x) on the interval [0, pi/2] is 2/pi."
