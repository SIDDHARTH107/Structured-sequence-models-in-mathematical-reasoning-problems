Using ElGamal, what is the ciphertext that Alice sends to Bob? ",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"12\" using the ElGamal encryption scheme, Alice will first choose a random number k (let's say k = 4). Then, she will compute the following two values:\n\n1. C1 = g^k mod p\n2. C2 = (message * y^k) mod p\n\nUsing the given parameters:\n\n1. C1 = 2^4 mod 19 = 16\n2. C2 = (12 * 3^4) mod 19 = (12 * 81) mod 19 = 972 mod 19 = 6\n\nSo, the ciphertext that Alice sends to Bob is (C1, C2) = (16, 6)."
