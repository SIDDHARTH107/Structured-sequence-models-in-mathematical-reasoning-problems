    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is f(x) and the inner function is g(x).\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x) and g(x).\n\nf(x) = (2x² + 5x + 1)³\nf'(x) = 3(2x² + 5x + 1)² * (4x + 5) [using the chain rule for the power function]\n\ng(x) = 4x - 1\ng'(x) = 4\n\nNow, we will find the derivative of f(g(x)) using the chain rule.\n\n(f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nSubstitute the derivatives we found earlier:\n\n(f(g(x)))' = 3(2(4x - 1)² + 5(4x - 1) + 1)² * (4x + 5) * 4\n\nNow, we will simplify the expression:\n\n(f(g(x)))' = 3(2(16x² - 8x + 1) + 20x - 5 + 1)² * (4x + 5) * 4\n(f(g(x)))' = 3(32x² - 16x + 2 + 20x - 5)² * (4x + 5) * 4\n(f(g(x)))' = 3(32x² + 4x - 3)² * (4x + 5) * 4\n\nSo, the derivative of f(g(x)) is:\n\n(f(g(x)))' = 12(32x² + 4x - 3)² * (4x + 5)"
