    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} - {2, 4} = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A Δ B) and C, which is denoted as (A Δ B) ∩ C. The intersection is the set of elements that are in both (A Δ B) and C.\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ C = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8} ∩ {2, 3, 4, 5} = {3, 5}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and C, which is denoted as A ∩ C. \n\nA ∩ C = {2, 4, 6, 8} ∩ {2, 3, 4, 5} = {2, 4}\n\nSimilarly, let's find the intersection of B and C, which is denoted as B ∩ C.\n\nB ∩ C = {1, 3, 5, 7} ∩ {2, 3, 4, 5} = {3, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∩ C) and (B ∩ C), which is denoted as (A ∩ C) Δ (B ∩ C).\n\n(A ∩ C) Δ (B ∩ C) = {2, 4} Δ {3, 5} = {2, 3, 4, 5} - {} = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSince (A Δ B) ∩ C = {3, 5} and (A ∩ C) Δ (B ∩ C) = {2, 3, 4, 5}, the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over intersection, as the two results are not equal."
