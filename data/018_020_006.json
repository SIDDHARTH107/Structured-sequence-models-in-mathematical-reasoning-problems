    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 3, 4, 5}. Find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and C , where C = {3, 4, 5, 6} and prove that it is distributive over union.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and C.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ C = ({1, 5} ∆ {3, 4, 5, 6})\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ C = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n(A ∆ B) ∩ C = {5}\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ C = {1, 3, 4, 6}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the symmetric difference is distributive over union. The distributive property states that:\n\nA ∆ (B ∪ C) = (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C)\n\nLet's find the left-hand side of the equation:\n\nB ∪ C = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∆ (B ∪ C) = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∆ {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nA ∪ (B ∪ C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∩ (B ∪ C) = {2, 3, 4}\n\nA ∆ (B ∪ C) = {1, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the right-hand side of the equation:\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 5}\nA ∆ C = {1, 2, 3, 6}\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C) = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}\n\nAs we can see, the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation are not equal:\n\nA ∆ (B ∪ C) = {1, 5, 6} ≠ {1, 2, 3, 5, 6} = (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C)\n\nTherefore, the symmetric difference is not distributive over union in this case."
