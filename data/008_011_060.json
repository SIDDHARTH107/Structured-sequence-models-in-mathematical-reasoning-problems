    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then find the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing the columns of the coefficient matrix with the constants (Dx, Dy, Dz). Finally, we'll divide the determinants of the matrices with constants by the determinant of the coefficient matrix to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n\n| 3  4 -2 |\n| 2 -3  6 |\n| 1  5 -4 |\n\nTo find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D):\n\nD = 3((-3)(-4) - 6(5)) - 4(2(-4) - 6(1)) - 2(2(5) - (-3)(1))\nD = 3(12 - 30) - 4(-8 - 6) - 2(10 + 3)\nD = 3(-18) + 4(14) - 2(13)\nD = -54 + 56 - 26\nD = 2\n\nNow, we'll find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the first column with the constants (Dx):\n\n| 19  4 -2 |\n| -3 -3  6 |\n|  2  5 -4 |\n\nDx = 19((-3)(-4) - 6(5)) - 4(-3(-4) - 6(2)) - 2(-3(5) - (-3)(2))\nDx = 19(12 - 30) - 4(12 - 12) - 2(-15 + 6)\nDx = 19(-18) - 0 - 2(-9)\nDx = -342 + 18\nDx = -324\n\nNow, we'll find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the second column with the constants (Dy):\n\n| 3  19 -2 |\n| 2  -3  6 |\n| 1   2 -4 |\n\nDy = 3((-3)(-4) - 6(2)) - 19(2(-4) - 6(1)) - 2(2(2) - (-3)(1))\nDy = 3(12 - 12) - 19(-8 - 6) - 2(4 + 3)\nDy = 0 + 19(14) - 2(7)\nDy = 266 - 14\nDy = 252\n\nFinally, we'll find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the third column with the constants (Dz):\n\n| 3  4 19 |\n| 2 -3 -3 |\n| 1  5  2 |\n\nDz = 3((-3)(2) - (-3)(5)) - 4(2(2) - (-3)(1)) - 19(2(5) - (-3)(1))\nDz = 3(-6 + 15) - 4(4 + 3) - 19(10 + 3)\nDz = 3(9) - 4(7) - 19(13)\nDz = 27 - 28 - 247\nDz = -248\n\nNow, we'll divide the determinants of the matrices with constants by the determinant of the coefficient matrix to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nx = Dx / D = -324 / 2 = -162\ny = Dy / D = 252 / 2 = 126\nz = Dz / D = -248 / 2 = -124\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the system are:\n\nx = -162\ny = 126\nz = -124"
