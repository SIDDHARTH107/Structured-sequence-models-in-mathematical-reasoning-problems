    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. The system of linear equations can be represented as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the coefficient matrix, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants (6, 1, 5).\n\nA = | 1  1  1 |\n    | 2 -1  3 |\n    | 3 -2  4 |\n\nB = | 6 |\n    | 1 |\n    | 5 |\n\nStep 1: LU decomposition of matrix A\n\nPerforming Gaussian elimination on matrix A:\n\nA = | 1  1   1 |  R2 = R2 - 2*R1, R3 = R3 - 3*R1\n    | 0 -3   1 |  R3 = R3 + R2\n    | 0  0  -1 |\n\nNow we have:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 2  1  0 |\n    | 3  1  1 |\n\nU = | 1  1   1 |\n    | 0 -3   1 |\n    | 0  0  -1 |\n\nStep 2: Solve L * Y = B for Y\n\nL * Y = | 1  0  0 | | y1 |   | 6 |\n        | 2  1  0 | | y2 | = | 1 |\n        | 3  1  1 | | y3 |   | 5 |\n\nSolving for Y:\n\ny1 = 6\ny2 = 1 - 2*y1 = 1 - 2*6 = -11\ny3 = 5 - 3*y1 - y2 = 5 - 3*6 + 11 = -2\n\nY = |  6  |\n    | -11 |\n    | -2  |\n\nStep 3: Solve U * X = Y for X\n\nU * X = | 1  1   1 | | x |   |  6  |\n        | 0 -3   1 | | y | = | -11 |\n        | 0  0  -1 | | z |   | -2  |\n\nSolving for X:\n\nz = -2/-1 = 2\ny = (-11 - z)/-3 = (-11 - 2)/-3 = 13/3\nx = 6 - y - z = 6 - 13/3 - 2 = (18 - 13 - 6)/3 = -1/3\n\nX = | -1/3  |\n    | 13/3  |\n    |  2    |\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -1/3, y = 13/3, and z = 2."
