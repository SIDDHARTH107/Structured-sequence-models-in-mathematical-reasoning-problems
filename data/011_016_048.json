    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. A combination is a selection of items from a larger set, where the order of the items does not matter.\n\nThe teacher has 12 different math problems and wants to assign 3 problems to each of her 8 students. We can think of this as choosing 3 problems from the set of 12 problems for each student.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 problems from a set of 12 problems is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 12 problems), k is the number of items to choose (in this case, 3 problems), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, for the first student, the number of ways to choose 3 problems from 12 problems is:\n\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3!(12-3)!) = 12! / (3!9!) = (12 × 11 × 10) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 220\n\nNow, after the first student has been assigned 3 problems, there are 9 problems left. For the second student, the number of ways to choose 3 problems from the remaining 9 problems is:\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!(9-3)!) = 9! / (3!6!) = (9 × 8 × 7) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 84\n\nContinuing this process for the remaining students:\n\n- For the third student, there are 6 problems left, so C(6, 3) = 20\n- For the fourth student, there are 3 problems left, so C(3, 3) = 1\n\nSince the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth students will not have any problems left to choose from, there are no more combinations for them.\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to assign the problems to all 8 students, we multiply the number of combinations for each student:\n\nTotal combinations = 220 × 84 × 20 × 1 = 369,600\n\nSo, there are 369,600 different ways the teacher can assign the 12 different math problems to her 8 students, with each student receiving exactly 3 problems."
