    "message_1": "Suppose two players, A and B, are trying to divide a grand prize of $100. Player A can either lie or tell the truth about their preferred division, and Player B must decide whether or not to believe them. If Player B believes Player A, they both receive their proposed shares. If Player B does not believe Player A, they both receive $0. What is the Nash equilibrium of this game assuming Player B is risk-neutral and both players have complete information?",
    "message_2": "In this game, we have two players: A and B. Player A can either lie or tell the truth about their preferred division, and Player B can either believe or not believe Player A. We can represent the game in a 2x2 matrix:\n\n```\n               Player B\n               Believe    Not Believe\nPlayer A\nLie          (x, 100-x)      (0, 0)\nTruth        (y, 100-y)      (0, 0)\n```\n\nHere, x and y represent the shares of the $100 prize that Player A proposes when lying and telling the truth, respectively.\n\nTo find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the strategies for each player that are their best responses to the other player's strategy.\n\n1. If Player A lies, Player B's best response is to believe if x ≥ y, and not believe if x < y.\n2. If Player A tells the truth, Player B's best response is to believe if y ≥ x, and not believe if y < x.\n\nNow, let's consider Player A's best response:\n\n1. If Player B believes, Player A's best response is to lie if x > y, and tell the truth if x ≤ y.\n2. If Player B does not believe, Player A's choice does not matter, as both players will receive $0.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when both players are playing their best responses to each other's strategies. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when Player A tells the truth and proposes a division y, and Player B believes them, as long as y ≥ x. This is because, given Player B's risk-neutral assumption, Player B would prefer to accept any division that is equal to or better than the alternative of receiving $0.\n\nIn summary, the Nash equilibrium of this game is when Player A tells the truth about their preferred division y, and Player B believes them, as long as y ≥ x."
