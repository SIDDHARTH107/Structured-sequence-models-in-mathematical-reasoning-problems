    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function (x^2 - 4) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2, we can first try to simplify the function. We can factor the numerator:\n\nx^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)\n\nSo the function can be written as:\n\n((x - 2)(x + 2)) / (x - 2)\n\nNow we can cancel out the (x - 2) terms:\n\n(x + 2)\n\nNow the function is simplified, and we can find the limit as x approaches 2:\n\nlim (x -> 2) (x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo the limit of the function (x^2 - 4) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2 is 4."
