    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given function f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 1, we need to compute the following integral:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken over the range (-∞, ∞).\n\nHere, f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 1, and k is the frequency variable.\n\nF(k) = ∫[(x^2 - 3x + 1) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞.\n\nNow, we can split this integral into three parts:\n\nF(k) = ∫[x^2 * e^(-2πikx)] dx - 3∫[x * e^(-2πikx)] dx + ∫[e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞.\n\nTo solve these integrals, we can use integration by parts. Let's solve them one by one.\n\n1) ∫[x^2 * e^(-2πikx)] dx:\n\nLet u = x^2, dv = e^(-2πikx) dx.\nThen, du = 2x dx, v = (-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫[u * dv] = u * v - ∫[v * du].\n\n∫[x^2 * e^(-2πikx)] dx = x^2 * (-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) - ∫[(-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) * 2x] dx.\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts again for the remaining integral:\n\nLet u = x, dv = (-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) dx.\nThen, du = dx, v = (1/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx).\n\n∫[x^2 * e^(-2πikx)] dx = x^2 * (-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) - 2 * (x * (1/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx) - ∫[(1/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx)] dx).\n\n2) ∫[x * e^(-2πikx)] dx:\n\nWe have already solved this integral above:\n\n∫[x * e^(-2πikx)] dx = x * (1/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx) - ∫[(1/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx)] dx.\n\n3) ∫[e^(-2πikx)] dx:\n\nThis integral is straightforward:\n\n∫[e^(-2πikx)] dx = (-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx).\n\nNow, we can plug these results back into the expression for F(k):\n\nF(k) = [x^2 * (-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx) - 2 * (x * (1/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx) - ∫[(1/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx)] dx)] - 3 * [x * (1/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx) - ∫[(1/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx)] dx] + (-1/(2πik)) * e^(-2πikx).\n\nSince the integral is taken over the range (-∞, ∞), the terms containing x will vanish, as they will be odd functions. Therefore, we are left with the constant term:\n\nF(k) = -3 * (-∫[(1/(4π^2k^2)) * e^(-2πikx)] dx) + (-1/(2πik)) * ∫[e^(-2πikx)] dx.\n\nThese remaining integrals are not elementary, and their solutions involve the Dirac delta function and its derivatives. However, the frequency spectrum of the signal can be analyzed using the Fourier transform F(k), which we have derived above. The frequency spectrum will provide information about the material properties by studying the behavior of F(k) at different frequencies."
