    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 36 and 48, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (48) by the smaller number (36) and find the remainder.\n48 รท 36 = 1 with a remainder of 12.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (48) with the smaller number (36) and the smaller number with the remainder (12).\nNow we have 36 and 12.\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n36 รท 12 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\nThe GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 12. So, the greatest common divisor of 36 and 48 is 12."
