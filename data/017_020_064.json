    "message_2": "To prove that a group of order 40 must be isomorphic to one of the mentioned groups, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 40. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5. We will find the Sylow subgroups of G.\n\n1. Sylow 5-subgroups: By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 2^3 = 8 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Let P_5 be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Since it is unique, it is normal in G.\n\n2. Sylow 2-subgroups: By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 5 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possibilities are n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 5. Let P_2 be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G.\n\nNow we analyze the possibilities:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal in G. In this case, G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and a normal Sylow 5-subgroup P_5. Since the orders of P_2 and P_5 are relatively prime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_5, which is a cyclic group of order 40, i.e., G is isomorphic to C40.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 5\nIn this case, there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal in G. We know that P_5 is normal in G, and |P_5| = 5. Let H be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then |H| = 8. Since P_5 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product of P_5 and H. The possible groups that can be formed are determined by the homomorphisms from H to Aut(P_5).\n\nAut(P_5) is isomorphic to Z_4, since P_5 is cyclic of order 5. There are three possible homomorphisms from H to Aut(P_5):\n\n1. The trivial homomorphism, which results in the direct product of P_5 and H, which is an abelian group of order 40. This case was already covered in Case 1.\n\n2. A homomorphism with kernel H, which results in the dihedral group D20. In this case, G is isomorphic to D20.\n\n3. A homomorphism with kernel of order 2. In this case, there are 8 possible non-abelian groups of order 40 that can be formed. These are the eight non-abelian groups of order 40 mentioned in the problem.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 40 must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C40, the dihedral group D20, or one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40. To determine which of the three possibilities the group falls under, we can analyze the structure of the Sylow subgroups and the homomorphisms between them."
