    "message_2": "Let G be a group of prime order p, and let g be an element in G. We want to show that the order of g is either 1 or p.\n\nRecall that the order of an element g in a group G, denoted as |g|, is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e, where e is the identity element of the group.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. Since G has prime order p, the only possible orders for subgroups of G are 1 and p.\n\nNow, consider the cyclic subgroup generated by g, denoted as <g>. The order of <g> is equal to the order of g, i.e., |<g>| = |g|. Since the order of any subgroup must divide the order of G, we have that |g| must be either 1 or p.\n\nIf |g| = 1, then g has order 1, which means g = e, the identity element.\n\nIf |g| = p, then g has order p, which means that g^p = e, and g is not equal to e.\n\nThus, the order of every element of G is either 1 or p."
