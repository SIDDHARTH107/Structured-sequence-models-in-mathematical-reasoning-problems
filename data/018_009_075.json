    "message_2": "First, let's find (A x B) x C and A x (B x C).\n\n(A x B) x C:\nTo find the Cartesian product A x B, we form ordered pairs with elements from A in the first position and elements from B in the second position.\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, we find the Cartesian product of (A x B) x C.

We form ordered pairs with elements from A in the first position and elements from B x C in the second position.\nA x (B x C) = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (5, 6)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (5, 6))}\n\nNow, let's show that (A x B) x C = A x (B x C) using mathematical proof.\n\nWe can see that the number of elements in both sets is the same, which is 6. Now, we need to show that the elements in both sets are equivalent.\n\nWe can rewrite the elements of (A x B) x C as:\n{((1, 4), 6), ((1, 5), 6), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 5), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 5), 6)}\n\nWe can rewrite the elements of A x (B x C) as:\n{(1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (5, 6)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (5, 6))}\n\nNow, let's compare the elements of both sets. We can see that for each element in (A x B) x C, there is a corresponding element in A x (B x C) with the same values. For example, ((1, 4), 6) in (A x B) x C corresponds to (1, (4, 6)) in A x (B x C).\n\nSince the number of elements in both sets is the same and the elements in both sets are equivalent, we can conclude that (A x B) x C = A x (B x C)."
