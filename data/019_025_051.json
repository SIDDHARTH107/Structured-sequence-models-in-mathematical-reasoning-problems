    "message_1": "If X number of students study for Y hours per week, how many more questions would they answer correctly on an exam compared to students who do not study at all, assuming a causal relationship between studying and exam performance?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need more information about the relationship between the number of hours studied and the increase in the number of questions answered correctly. \n\nFor example, if we know that for every hour of study, a student can answer Z more questions correctly, then we can calculate the difference as follows:\n\nDifference in the number of questions answered correctly = X * Y * Z\n\nHowever, without knowing the value of Z or any other information about the relationship between studying and exam performance, we cannot provide a specific answer to this problem."
