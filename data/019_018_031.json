    "message_2": "You have already provided a complete and correct proof by induction for the statement P(n). To reiterate:\n\n1. Base Case: P(1) is true because the sum of the first odd natural number is 1, which is equal to 1².\n\n2. Induction Hypothesis: Assume that P(k) is true for some positive integer k.\n\n3. Induction Step: We need to prove that P(k+1) is also true.\n\n   a. The sum of the first (k+1) odd natural numbers can be written as:\n\n      1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k+1) = k² + (2k+1)\n\n   b. We can use the induction hypothesis to rewrite k² as the sum of the k odd natural numbers:\n\n      k² = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1)\n\n   c. Substituting this into the previous expression, we get:\n\n      1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k+1) = k² + (2k+1) = (1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1)) + (2k+1)\n\n   d. Simplifying this expression gives us:\n\n      1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k+1) = (k+1)²\n\n   e. Therefore, P(k+1) is true.\n\n4. By the principle of mathematical induction, P(n) is true for all positive integers n."
