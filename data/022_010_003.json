    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^3 - z^2}$, we first factor out $z^2$ from the denominator:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2(z - 1)}$$\n\nNow, we want to express the function as a sum of simpler functions that we can expand into a Laurent series. We can do this using partial fraction decomposition:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{z^2(z - 1)} = \\frac{A}{z} + \\frac{B}{z^2} + \\frac{C}{z - 1}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $z^2(z - 1)$, we get:\n\n$$1 = A(z^2)(z - 1) + B(z)(z - 1) + C(z^2)$$\n\nNow we can solve for $A$, $B$, and $C$ by plugging in values of $z$ that simplify the equation:\n\n1. $z = 0$: $1 = -A(0) + 0 + 0 \\Rightarrow A = -1$\n2. $z = 1$: $0 = 0 + 0 + C(1) \\Rightarrow C = 0$\n3. Differentiating both sides with respect to $z$ and then plugging in $z = 0$, we get:\n\n$$0 = 2A(0) + B(-1) + 0 \\Rightarrow B = 0$$\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\n$$f(z) = -\\frac{1}{z}$$\n\nSince this is already a simple function, we can write its Laurent series expansion directly:\n\n$$f(z) = -\\frac{1}{z}$$\n\nThe radius of convergence of this series is infinite, as there are no singularities other than the pole at $z = 0$."
