    "message_2": "Twin primes are pairs of primes that have a difference of 2. To find the twin primes immediately before and after 500, we need to check the prime numbers around 500.\n\nThe prime numbers before 500 are 499 and 491. Since 499 - 491 = 8, they are not twin primes.\n\nThe prime numbers after 500 are 503 and 509. Since 509 - 503 = 6, they are not twin primes.\n\nHowever, the pair (499, 503) has a difference of 4, which means they are not twin primes either.\n\nThus, there are no twin primes immediately before and after the number 500."
