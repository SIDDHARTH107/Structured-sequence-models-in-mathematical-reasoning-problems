The statement \"I know that it is sunny today\" can be translated into epistemic logic as:\n\nK(sunny)\n\nNow, we want to determine if the statement \"I do not know if it is sunny today\" is true or false. This statement can be translated into epistemic logic as:\n\n¬K(sunny)\n\nSince the given statement is \"I know that it is sunny today\" (K(sunny)), the statement \"I do not know if it is sunny today\" (¬K(sunny)) is false."
