    "message_2": "To find the shortest route, we can use the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm. The TSP is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, which means that it is computationally expensive to solve. However, since there are only 5 locations, we can use the brute force method to find the shortest route.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible routes starting and ending at Location A:\n\n1. A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> A\n2. A -> B -> C -> E -> D -> A\n3. A -> B -> D -> C -> E -> A\n4. A -> B -> D -> E -> C -> A\n5. A -> B -> E -> C -> D -> A\n6. A -> B -> E -> D -> C -> A\n7. A -> C -> B -> D -> E -> A\n8. A -> C -> B -> E -> D -> A\n9. A -> C -> D -> B -> E -> A\n10. A -> C -> D -> E -> B -> A\n11. A -> C -> E -> B -> D -> A\n12. A -> C -> E -> D -> B -> A\n13. A -> D -> B -> C -> E -> A\n14. A -> D -> B -> E -> C -> A\n15. A -> D -> C -> B -> E -> A\n16. A -> D -> C -> E -> B -> A\n17. A -> D -> E -> B -> C -> A\n18. A -> D -> E -> C -> B -> A\n19. A -> E -> B -> C -> D -> A\n20. A -> E -> B -> D -> C -> A\n21. A -> E -> C -> B -> D -> A\n22. A -> E -> C -> D -> B -> A\n23. A -> E -> D -> B -> C -> A\n24. A -> E -> D -> C -> B -> A\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance for each route using the given distance table:\n\n1. 5+6+1+7+8 = 27\n2. 5+6+7+4+8 = 30\n3. 5+1+7+2+8 = 23\n4. 5+1+4+3+8 = 21\n5. 5+8+7+1+8 = 29\n6. 5+8+4+3+8 = 28\n7. 4+3+1+7+5 = 20\n8. 4+3+7+4+5 = 23\n9. 4+2+1+7+5 = 19\n10. 4+2+4+3+5 = 18\n11. 4+5+1+7+5 = 22\n12. 4+5+4+3+5 = 21\n13. 2+3+6+7+5 = 23\n14. 2+3+7+4+5 = 21\n15. 2+6+1+7+5 = 21\n16. 2+6+4+3+5 = 20\n17. 2+7+1+6+5 = 21\n18. 2+7+3+6+5 = 23\n19. 8+3+6+1+5 = 23\n20. 8+3+7+1+5 = 24\n21. 8+6+1+7+5 = 27\n22. 8+6+4+3+5 = 26\n23. 8+7+1+6+5 = 27\n24. 8+7+3+6+5 = 29\n\nThe shortest route is Route 10 with a total distance of 18 units: A -> C -> D -> E -> B -> A."
