    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface as:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we find the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we find the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form (E, F, G) and the second fundamental form (L, M, N):\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 2uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nL = r_uu • n = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nM = r_uv • n = 0\nN = r_vv • n = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nHere, n is the unit normal vector to the surface, which can be found as the cross product of r_u and r_v, and then normalized:\n\nn = (r_u × r_v) / ||r_u × r_v||\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have:\n\nE = 5\nF = 2\nG = 5\n\nL = 2 / sqrt(9) = 2 / 3\nM = 0\nN = 2 / 3\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures (k1 and k2) using the formulas:\n\nk1 = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\nk2 = (EM - FL) / (EG - F^2)\n\nk1 = (2/3 * 2/3 - 0) / (5 * 5 - 2 * 2) = 4 / 21\nk2 = (5 * 0 - 2 * 2/3) / (5 * 5 - 2 * 2) = -4 / 21\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1, 1, 2) are k1 = 4/21 and k2 = -4/21."
