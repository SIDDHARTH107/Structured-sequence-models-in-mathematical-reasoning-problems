    "message_2": "An elliptic curve over a finite field 𝔽p (in this case, 𝔽7) is defined by the equation:\n\ny^2 ≡ x^3 + ax + b (mod p)\n\nGiven the point (1, 3) is on the curve, and the coefficients a = -1 and b = 1, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n(3)^2 ≡ (1)^3 - 1(1) + 1 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can simplify and solve the equation:\n\n9 ≡ 1 - 1 + 1 (mod 7)\n9 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSince 9 ≡ 1 (mod 7), the equation for the elliptic curve defined over the finite field of integers modulo 7 (𝔽7) with the point (1, 3) on the curve and the coefficients a = -1 and b = 1 is:\n\ny^2 ≡ x^3 - x + 1 (mod 7)"
