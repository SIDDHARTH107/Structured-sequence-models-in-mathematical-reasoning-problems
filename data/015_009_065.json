    "message_2": "To calculate the Lyapunov exponent for this system, we first need to linearize the system around its fixed points. The fixed points can be found by setting dX/dt = 0 and solving for X:\n\nX(2-X) = 0\n\nThis equation has two fixed points: X = 0 and X = 2.\n\nNow, we linearize the system around each fixed point by taking the derivative of the right-hand side of the differential equation with respect to X:\n\nd/dX (X(2-X)) = 2 - 2X\n\nFor the fixed point X = 0:\n\nd/dX (X(2-X)) = 2 - 2(0) = 2\n\nFor the fixed point X = 2:\n\nd/dX (X(2-X)) = 2 - 2(2) = -2\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent is given by the average growth rate of the linearized system. In this case, we have two fixed points with different growth rates, so we need to consider them separately.\n\nFor the fixed point X = 0, the Lyapunov exponent is positive (2), which indicates that this fixed point is unstable. For the fixed point X = 2, the Lyapunov exponent is negative (-2), which indicates that this fixed point is stable.\n\nSince we are given an initial condition X(0) = 0.5, which is closer to the stable fixed point X = 2, the system will likely converge to this fixed point over the time interval [0, 10]. Therefore, the Lyapunov exponent for this system over the given time interval is approximately -2."
