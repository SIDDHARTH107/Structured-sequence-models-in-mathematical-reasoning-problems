    "message_1": "In a Rail fence cipher encryption, a message with 16 letters was encrypted with a key of 3 rails. How many columns does the resulting encrypted message have?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of columns in the encrypted message, we need to understand the structure of the Rail Fence cipher. With a key of 3 rails, the message is written in a zigzag pattern as follows:\n\n1. Write the first letter in the top row.\n2. Write the next letter in the second row.\n3. Write the next letter in the third row.\n4. Write the next letter in the second row.\n5. Write the next letter in the top row.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until all letters are used.\n\nFor a 16-letter message, the pattern would look like this:\n\n1. _ _ _ _\n2. _ _ _ _ _\n3. _ _ _ _\n\nNow, we can count the columns in the pattern:\n\n1. Four columns in the top row.\n2. Five columns in the second row.\n3. Three columns in the third row.\n\nSo, the resulting encrypted message will have 4 + 5 + 3 = 12 columns."
