    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! â‰¡ -1 (mod p). In other words, (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p. We are looking for the smallest positive integer n such that n! - 1 is divisible by n.\n\nLet's test the smallest prime numbers:\n\nFor n = 2, 2! - 1 = 1, which is not divisible by 2.\nFor n = 3, 3! - 1 = 5, which is not divisible by 3.\nFor n = 5, 5! - 1 = 119, which is not divisible by 5.\nFor n = 7, 7! - 1 = 5039, which is divisible by 7.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given condition is 7."
