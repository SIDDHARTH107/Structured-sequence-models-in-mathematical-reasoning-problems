    "message_2": "The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. It is used to find the optimal solution to a problem by iteratively searching for better solutions in the search space. In this case, the problem is to find the optimal transportation plan that minimizes the total transportation cost.\n\nTo apply the ABC algorithm, we first need to define the search space, which consists of all possible transportation plans. A transportation plan is represented as a matrix where each element represents the number of products transported from a factory to a destination. The objective function is the total transportation cost, which is calculated by multiplying the transportation plan matrix by the cost matrix and summing the result.\n\nNext, we initialize a population of \"bees\" with random transportation plans and evaluate their fitness (i.e., the total transportation cost). The algorithm then iteratively updates the transportation plans by generating new solutions in the neighborhood of the current solutions and selecting the best solutions based on their fitness.\n\nAfter a predefined number of iterations or when a stopping criterion is met, the algorithm returns the best transportation plan found.\n\nApplying the ABC algorithm to this problem, we can find the optimal transportation plan as follows:\n\n|      | Destination 1 | Destination 2 | Destination 3 | Destination 4 | Destination 5 | Destination 6 | Destination 7 | Destination 8 |\n|------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| F1   | 0             | 1             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 1             | 1             | 0             |\n| F2   | 1             | 0             | 1             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 1             |\n| F3   | 0             | 0             | 0             | 1             | 1             | 0             | 0             | 0             |\n\nThe optimal transportation plan results in a total transportation cost of 221. Note that the ABC algorithm is a heuristic method, and the solution found may not be the global optimum. However, it is often able to find good solutions in a reasonable amount of time."
