    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$D = \\frac{\\log N}{\\log (1/s)}$\n\nwhere $N$ is the number of self-similar pieces and $s$ is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor dust fractal with the central $\\frac{1}{3}$ interval removed in each iteration, we have:\n\n- $N = 2$, as each interval is split into 2 self-similar pieces.\n- $s = 3$, as each piece is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the original size.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\n$D = \\frac{\\log 2}{\\log 3} \\approx 0.6309$\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust fractal with 5 iterations is approximately 0.6309. Note that the number of iterations does not affect the Hausdorff dimension, as it is a property of the fractal itself and not dependent on the number of iterations."
