    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose you are given a non-monotonic logical system with 100 propositional variables. At the start of the system, all variables are assigned the value 'false'. You are then given a set of 50 rules that can change the truth value of some of these variables. Each rule has a certainty level between 0 and 1, indicating how confident you are in the rule. The logical system is non-monotonic, which means that the truth value of a variable may change as new rules are added to the system.\n\nYour task is to determine which variables will have a truth value of 'true' when all 50 rules have been added to the system, assuming that the system is closed (i.e., no new rules will be added after the initial set of 50). You can assume that the system will stop changing after a certain number of rules have been added, although you do not know in advance how many rules this will be.\n\nGiven this information, what is the probability that variable A will have a truth value of 'true' at the end of the system, and what is the probability that variable B will have a truth value of 'true' at the end of the system?",
    "message_2": "To determine the probability that variable A will have a truth value of 'true' at the end of the system, and the probability that variable B will have a truth value of 'true' at the end of the system, we need more information about the rules and their certainty levels. Without knowing the specific rules and their certainty levels, it is impossible to calculate the exact probabilities.\n\nHowever, we can provide a general approach to solving this problem:\n\n1. Create a list of all possible combinations of rules being applied. There are 2^50 possible combinations since each rule can either be applied or not applied.\n\n2. For each combination of rules, calculate the resulting truth values of variables A and B. Keep track of the number of times A and B are 'true' in each combination.\n\n3. For each combination of rules, calculate the probability of that combination occurring by multiplying the certainty levels of the applied rules and (1 - certainty level) of the unapplied rules.\n\n4. Multiply the probability of each combination by the number of times A and B are 'true' in that combination.\n\n5. Sum the probabilities for all combinations to find the total probability that A and B will have a truth value of 'true' at the end of the system.\n\n6. Divide the total probability for A and B by the total number of combinations (2^50) to find the probability that variable A will have a truth value of 'true' and the probability that variable B will have a truth value of 'true' at the end of the system.\n\nThis approach will give you the exact probabilities for A and B being 'true' at the end of the system, given the specific rules and their certainty levels."
