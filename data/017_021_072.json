    "message_2": "To find the distinct number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3^1. \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^4 = 16, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4. If n_3 = 1, there is a normal Sylow 3-subgroup. If n_3 = 4, there is no guarantee of a normal Sylow 3-subgroup.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^1 = 3, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The only possible value for n_2 is 1, which means there is a normal Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nSince there is a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, we can apply the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, which states that if G has a normal subgroup H of order m and the order of G/H is n, then G has a subgroup K of order n such that G is the internal direct product of H and K. In our case, G has a normal subgroup of order 16 (2^4) and the order of G/H is 3. Therefore, G has a subgroup of order 3, and G is the internal direct product of these two subgroups.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 16 (2^4). There are five such groups:\n\n1. C_16 (cyclic group)\n2. C_8 × C_2 (direct product of two cyclic groups)\n3. C_4 × C_4 (direct product of two cyclic groups)\n4. D_8 (dihedral group)\n5. Q_16 (quaternion group)\n\nFor each of these groups of order 16, we can form a group of order 48 by taking the internal direct product with a group of order 3. If the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal (n_3 = 1), we can form a semi-direct product with the Sylow 2-subgroup. If the Sylow 3-subgroup is not normal (n_3 = 4), we cannot form a semi-direct product.\n\n1. C_16 × C_3 (cyclic group)\n2. (C_8 × C_2) × C_3 (direct product of two cyclic groups)\n3. (C_4 × C_4) × C_3 (direct product of two cyclic groups)\n4. D_8 × C_3 (dihedral group)\n5. Q_16 × C_3 (quaternion group)\n\nIn total, there are 5 distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
