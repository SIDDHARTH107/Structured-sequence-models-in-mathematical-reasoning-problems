    "message_1": "A telecommunications company needs to lay out fiber optic cables in a city to connect its network. The city has 10 buildings, and each building needs to be connected to the network. The cost of laying cables between buildings varies, and the company wants to minimize its total cost while ensuring that each building can be reached from the network. The cost of laying cables between each pair of buildings is given in the following table:\n\n| Building        | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   |\n| --------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| **1**           | 0    | 110  | 170  | 230  | 210  | 290  | 280  | 210  | 320  | 170  |\n| **2**           | 110  | 0    | 210  | 290  | 260  | 350  | 360  | 270  | 350  | 210  |\n| **3**           | 170  | 210  | 0    | 160  | 160  | 260  | 230  | 240  | 190  | 50   |\n| **4**           | 230  | 290  | 160  | 0    | 100  | 200  | 180  | 190  | 280  | 120  |\n| **5**           | 210  | 260  | 160  | 100  | 0    | 110  | 90   | 120  | 210  | 60   |\n| **6**           | 290  | 350  | 260  | 200  | 110  | 0    | 130  | 200  | 290  | 160  |\n| **7**           | 280  | 360  | 230  | 180  | 90   | 130  | 0    | 110  | 200  | 110  |\n| **8**           | 210  | 270  | 240  | 190  | 120  | 200  | 110  | 0    | 200  | 150  |\n| **9**           | 320  | 350  | 190  | 280  | 210  | 290  | 200  | 200  | 0    | 220  |\n| **10**          | 170  | 210  | 50   | 120  | 60   | 160  | 110  | 150  | 220  | 0    |\n\nWhat is the minimum cost required to connect all the buildings to the network?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost required to connect all the buildings to the network, we can use Kruskal's algorithm, which is a minimum spanning tree algorithm. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Sort all the edges (connections between buildings) in non-decreasing order of their weight (cost).\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the next edge with the lowest weight to the graph, making sure it doesn't form a cycle.\n4. Repeat step 3 until all the buildings are connected.\n\nSorted edges by weight (cost):\n(3, 10) - 50\n(5, 10) - 60\n(4, 5) - 100\n(5, 7) - 90\n(6, 7) - 130\n(7, 8) - 110\n(1, 2) - 110\n(4, 10) - 120\n(3, 4) - 160\n(3, 5) - 160\n(1, 3) - 170\n(1, 5) - 210\n(1, 8) - 210\n(2, 3) - 210\n(2, 10) - 210\n(2, 8) - 270\n(3, 6) - 260\n(3, 7) - 230\n(3, 8) - 240\n(3, 9) - 190\n(4, 6) - 200\n(4, 7) - 180\n(4, 8) - 190\n(4, 9) - 280\n(5, 6) - 110\n(5, 8) - 120\n(5, 9) - 210\n(6, 8) - 200\n(6, 9) - 290\n(6, 10) - 160\n(7, 9) - 200\n(7, 10) - 110\n(8, 9) - 200\n(8, 10) - 150\n(9, 10) - 220\n\nMinimum spanning tree edges:\n(3, 10) - 50\n(5, 10) - 60\n(4, 5) - 100\n(5, 7) - 90\n(6, 7) - 130\n(7, 8) - 110\n(1, 2) - 110\n(4, 10) - 120\n\nThe minimum cost required to connect all the buildings to the network is the sum of the weights of the edges in the minimum spanning tree:\n\n50 + 60 + 100 + 90 + 130 + 110 + 110 + 120 = 770"
