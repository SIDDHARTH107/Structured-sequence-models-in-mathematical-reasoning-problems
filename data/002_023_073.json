    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 6 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (6 cm)^2\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 36 cm^2\nSurface Area = 144π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 452.39 cm^2 (rounded to two decimal places)."
