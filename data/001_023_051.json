    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation 2cos(x) - 1 = 0 for x in the interval [0, 2π], follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate the cosine function:\n2cos(x) - 1 = 0\n2cos(x) = 1\ncos(x) = 1/2\n\n2. Find the angles x in the interval [0, 2π] that have a cosine value of 1/2:\nx = cos^(-1)(1/2)\n\nThere are two angles in the interval [0, 2π] that have a cosine value of 1/2:\nx = π/3 and x = 5π/3\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation 2cos(x) - 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2π] are x = π/3 and x = 5π/3."
