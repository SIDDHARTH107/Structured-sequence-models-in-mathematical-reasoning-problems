    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of the graph G, we need to find the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find an upper bound for the chromatic number using the maximum degree of the graph (Δ). Since G has 9 vertices and 12 edges, the maximum possible degree for a vertex in G is 8 (if it were connected to all other vertices). However, this would result in more than 12 edges, so the maximum degree must be less than 8. Let's assume the maximum degree is Δ = 7. In this case, the graph would have at least (7+1)/2 = 4 vertices with degree 7, which would result in at least 4 * 7 / 2 = 14 edges, which is still more than 12 edges. Therefore, the maximum degree must be less than 7.\n\nNow let's assume the maximum degree is Δ = 6. In this case, the graph would have at least (6+1)/2 = 3.5 vertices with degree 6, which would result in at least 3 * 6 / 2 = 9 edges. This is possible with 12 edges, so Δ = 6 is a valid maximum degree for the graph G.\n\nAccording to the theorem, the chromatic number χ(G) is at most Δ + 1. Therefore, the upper bound for the chromatic number of G is 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNow let's find a lower bound for the chromatic number using the clique number (ω). A clique is a complete subgraph, meaning all vertices in the clique are connected to each other. The clique number is the size of the largest clique in the graph. Since G has 12 edges, the largest possible clique is a triangle (3 vertices and 3 edges). This means that the lower bound for the chromatic number is ω(G) = 3.\n\nIn summary, we have a lower bound of 3 and an upper bound of 7 for the chromatic number of the graph G. To determine the exact chromatic number, we would need more information about the specific structure of the graph. However, we can conclude that the chromatic number of G lies between 3 and 7, inclusive."
