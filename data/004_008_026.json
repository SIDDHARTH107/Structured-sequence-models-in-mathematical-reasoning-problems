    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA curve is defined by the equation y = x^3 - 5x^2. Find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2.",
    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2, we need to find the derivative of the function y = x^3 - 5x^2 with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of y with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = d(x^3 - 5x^2)/dx = 3x^2 - 10x\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\ndy/dx(2) = 3(2)^2 - 10(2) = 3(4) - 20 = 12 - 20 = -8\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2 is -8."
