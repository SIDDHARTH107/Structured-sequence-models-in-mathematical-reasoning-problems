Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of f(x, y) with respect to x and y.\n\nf_x = ∂f/∂x = 6x\nf_y = ∂f/∂y = 4y\n\nNow, let's find the second partial derivatives:\n\nf_xx = ∂²f/∂x² = 6\nf_yy = ∂²f/∂y² = 4\nf_xy = ∂²f/∂x∂y = 0\n\nNext, we need to find the unit normal vector N at the point (1, 2):\n\nN = (-f_x, -f_y, 1) / ||(-f_x, -f_y, 1)||\n\nAt the point (1, 2), we have:\n\nN = (-6, -8, 1) / ||(-6, -8, 1)|| = (-6, -8, 1) / √(6² + 8² + 1²) = (-6, -8, 1) / √101\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms:\n\nE = <∂X/∂x, ∂X/∂x> = <(-f_x, -f_y, 1), (-f_x, -f_y, 1)> = 6² + 8² + 1² = 101\nF = <∂X/∂x, ∂X/∂y> = <(-f_x, -f_y, 1), (0, 0, 0)> = 0\nG = <∂X/∂y, ∂X/∂y> = <(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0)> = 0\n\nL = <N, ∂²X/∂x²> = <(-6, -8, 1), (6, 0, 0)> = 36\nM = <N, ∂²X/∂x∂y> = <(-6, -8, 1), (0, 0, 0)> = 0\nN = <N, ∂²X/∂y²> = <(-6, -8, 1), (0, 4, 0)> = 32\n\nFinally, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M²) / (EG - F²) = (36 * 32 - 0²) / (101 * 0 - 0²) = 0\n\nThe Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point (1, 2) is 0."
