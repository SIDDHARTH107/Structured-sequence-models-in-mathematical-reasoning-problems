    "message_2": "To show that a group of order 20 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 20. The prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup and a Sylow 2-subgroup in G. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 4 (the index of the Sylow 5-subgroup) and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can only be 1. This means that P is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 5 (the index of the Sylow 2-subgroup) and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 5. If n_2 = 1, then Q is also a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we consider the following cases:\n\n1. If both P and Q are normal subgroups of G, then G is the internal direct product of P and Q. Since P has order 5 and Q has order 4, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20.\n\n2. If Q is not a normal subgroup of G (i.e., n_2 = 5), then G has 5 Sylow 2-subgroups. Since each Sylow 2-subgroup has 3 elements of order 2, there are a total of 5 * 3 = 15 elements of order 2 in G. The remaining 4 elements must have order 5, and they form the unique Sylow 5-subgroup P.\n\nNow, let x be an element of order 5 in P and y be an element of order 2 in Q. Since P is normal in G, we have yxy^(-1) = x^i for some i (1 ≤ i ≤ 4). If i is odd, then (yxy^(-1))^2 = x^(2i) = x, which contradicts the fact that x has order 5. Therefore, i must be even, and we can assume without loss of generality that i = 2.\n\nThus, we have the following relations: x^5 = y^2 = e (the identity element) and yxy^(-1) = x^2. These relations define the non-abelian group of order 20.\n\n3. If G is not isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20, then G must be isomorphic to the dihedral group D10. In this case, G can be generated by two elements x and y, where x has order 10, y has order 2, and yxy^(-1) = x^(-1). The multiplication table of D10 can be constructed using these relations.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 20 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, or the non-abelian group of order 20. To determine which one of these groups is the given group, we can find its multiplication table using the relations described above."
