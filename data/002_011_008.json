    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of 5 cm and a hypotenuse of 13 cm, what is the length of the perpendicular side using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the base a, the perpendicular side b, and the hypotenuse c.\n\na = 5 cm\nc = 13 cm\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\na² + b² = c²\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n\n5² + b² = 13²\n\n25 + b² = 169\n\nNow, solve for b:\n\nb² = 169 - 25\nb² = 144\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nb = √144\nb = 12 cm\n\nSo, the length of the perpendicular side is 12 cm."
