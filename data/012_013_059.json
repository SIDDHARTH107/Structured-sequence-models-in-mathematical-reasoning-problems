    "message_2": "The chromatic polynomial of a graph G, denoted as P(G, k), is a polynomial that counts the number of proper k-colorings of G (i.e., the number of ways to color the vertices of G using k colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color). It is a polynomial in the variable k.\n\nHowever, to compute the chromatic polynomial of a graph, we need more information about the graph's structure than just the number of vertices and edges. The chromatic polynomial depends on the specific arrangement of vertices and edges in the graph, not just their counts.\n\nThere are several recursive methods to compute the chromatic polynomial, such as deletion-contraction and the chromatic polynomial of smaller subgraphs, but these methods also require knowledge of the graph's structure.\n\nIn summary, without more information about the structure of the graph G with 12 vertices and 25 edges, we cannot determine its chromatic polynomial."
