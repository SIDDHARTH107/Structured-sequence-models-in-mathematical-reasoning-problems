    "message_2": "To arrange a deck of 52 cards in a specific order, we can use the concept of permutations. A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order.\n\nFor the first card, there are 52 options. After the first card is chosen, there are 51 cards left for the second position. For the third position, there are 50 cards left, and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to arrange a deck of 52 cards in a specific order is:\n\n52! (52 factorial) = 52 × 51 × 50 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1\n\n52! ≈ 8.0658 × 10^67\n\nSo, there are approximately 8.0658 × 10^67 ways to arrange a deck of 52 cards in a specific order."
