    "message_2": "To find the measure of the angle opposite the side with length 12, we will use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this problem, a = 8, b = 10, and c = 12. We want to find the angle C. Plugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\n12² = 8² + 10² - 2 * 8 * 10 * cos(C)\n\n144 = 64 + 100 - 160 * cos(C)\n\nNow, we will isolate cos(C):\n\n80 = 160 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = 80 / 160\n\ncos(C) = 0.5\n\nNow, we will find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 0.5:\n\nC = arccos(0.5)\n\nC ≈ 60°\n\nSo, the measure of the angle opposite the side with length 12 is approximately 60°."
