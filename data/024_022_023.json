    "message_2": "To find all isometries of this metric, we need to find all bijective linear transformations T: R² → R² that preserve the metric tensor g. In other words, we need to find all 2x2 matrices A such that:\n\nA^T * g * A = g\n\nwhere A^T is the transpose of A. Let A be a 2x2 matrix:\n\nA = (a b\n     c d)\n\nThen A^T is:\n\nA^T = (a c\n       b d)\n\nNow, we compute A^T * g * A:\n\nA^T * g * A = (a c\n               b d) * (1 0\n                        0 4) * (a b\n                                c d)\n\n             = (a c\n                b 4d) * (a b\n                         c d)\n\n             = (a + 4c  b + 4d\n                 4b + 16d 4c + 16d)\n\nFor A^T * g * A to be equal to g, we must have:\n\na + 4c = 1\nb + 4d = 0\n4b + 16d = 0\n4c + 16d = 4\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n\nd = -b/4\n\nSubstituting this into the third equation:\n\n4b + 16(-b/4) = 0\n4b - 4b = 0\n\nThis equation is always true, so it doesn't give us any new information.\n\nNow, substitute d = -b/4 into the fourth equation:\n\n4c + 16(-b/4) = 4\n4c - 4b = 4\n\nDivide by 4:\n\nc - b = 1\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\na + 4c = 1\nc - b = 1\n\nWe can solve for a and b in terms of c:\n\na = 1 - 4c\nb = c - 1\n\nNow, we can write the matrix A in terms of c:\n\nA = (1 - 4c  c - 1\n     c     -c/4)\n\nSince A must be a bijective linear transformation, its determinant must be nonzero:\n\ndet(A) = (1 - 4c)(-c/4) - c(c - 1) ≠ 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n-c/4 + c^2 - c^2/4 + c ≠ 0\n(3/4)c ≠ 0\n\nSince c ≠ 0, we can choose any nonzero value for c and find the corresponding values for a, b, and d. Therefore, the isometries of this metric are given by the family of matrices:\n\nA(c) = (1 - 4c  c - 1\n        c     -c/4)\n\nwhere c is any nonzero real number."
