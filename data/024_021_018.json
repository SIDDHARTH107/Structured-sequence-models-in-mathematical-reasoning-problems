    "message_2": "To find the Killing vector fields of the given metric, we need to find the vector fields $X$ that satisfy the Killing equation:\n\n$$\\nabla_\\mu X_\\nu + \\nabla_\\nu X_\\mu = 0$$\n\nwhere $\\nabla$ is the covariant derivative and $\\mu, \\nu$ are the indices for the coordinates $(r, \\theta)$. \n\nFirst, we compute the Christoffel symbols for the given metric. The non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n\n$$\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} = -\\sin(r)\\cos(r)$$\n$$\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r} = \\cot(r)$$\n\nNow, let's write the Killing equation in terms of the components of the Killing vector field $X = X^r \\partial_r + X^\\theta \\partial_\\theta$. The Killing equation can be written as:\n\n$$\\partial_\\mu X_\\nu + \\partial_\\nu X_\\mu - 2\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu}X_\\lambda = 0$$\n\nWe have four equations to solve:\n\n1. $\\partial_r X^r - 2\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta}X^\\theta = 0$\n2. $\\partial_\\theta X^r + \\partial_r X^\\theta - 2\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta}X^r = 0$\n3. $\\partial_\\theta X^\\theta - 2\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r}X^r = 0$\n4. $\\partial_r X^\\theta + \\partial_\\theta X^\\theta - 2\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta}X^\\theta = 0$\n\nFrom equation (1), we have:\n\n$$\\partial_r X^r = 2\\cot(r)X^\\theta$$\n\nIntegrating with respect to $r$, we get:\n\n$$X^r = 2\\sin(r)\\cos(r)F(\\theta) + G(\\theta)$$\n\nwhere $F(\\theta)$ and $G(\\theta)$ are functions of $\\theta$.\n\nFrom equation (3), we have:\n\n$$\\partial_\\theta X^\\theta = 2\\cot(r)X^r$$\n\nIntegrating with respect to $\\theta$, we get:\n\n$$X^\\theta = 2\\sin(r)\\cos(r)H(r) + K(r)$$\n\nwhere $H(r)$ and $K(r)$ are functions of $r$.\n\nNow, we substitute $X^r$ and $X^\\theta$ into equation (2) and equation (4). After simplification, we get two equations:\n\n$$\\partial_\\theta G(\\theta) = 0$$\n$$\\partial_\\theta F(\\theta) + 2\\sin^2(r)H'(r) = 0$$\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $G(\\theta) = C_1$, where $C_1$ is a constant. The second equation implies that $F(\\theta)$ is independent of $\\theta$ and $H'(r) = 0$. Therefore, we have $F(\\theta) = C_2$ and $H(r) = C_3$, where $C_2$ and $C_3$ are constants.\n\nFinally, we have the Killing vector fields:\n\n$$X = (2C_2\\sin(r)\\cos(r) + C_1)\\partial_r + (2C_3\\sin(r)\\cos(r) + K(r))\\partial_\\theta$$\n\nThe constants $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$ can be determined by the boundary conditions or other constraints on the Killing vector fields."
