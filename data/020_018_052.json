    "message_2": "To find the optimal strategy for player 1, we need to use the minimax theorem. First, we find the minimum value in each row (i.e., the worst-case scenario for player 1 if they choose a specific strategy).\n\nMinimum values for each row:\n- Player 2: min(4, 6, 8) = 4\n- Player 3: min(1, 0, 6) = 0\n- Player 4: min(5, 4, 7) = 4\n\nNow, we find the maximum value among these minimum values (i.e., the best outcome among the worst-case scenarios).\n\nMaximum value among the minimum values: max(4, 0, 4) = 4\n\nThe optimal strategy for player 1 is to choose either Strategy A or Strategy C, as both have the same maximum minimum value of 4. The corresponding payoff value for player 1 is 4."
