    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we'll use the properties of logarithms:\n\n1. log_a(a^x) = x\n2. log_a(x) - log_a(y) = log_a(x/y)\n\nApplying the first property to the equation:\n\nlog(base 3)(3^(x+1)) - log(base 3)(9) = x + 1 - log(base 3)(9)\n\nNow, we know that 9 = 3^2, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx + 1 - log(base 3)(3^2) = x + 1 - 2\n\nApplying the first property again:\n\nx + 1 - 2 = x - 1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx - 1 = x\n\nHowever, this equation has no solution, as x cannot be equal to itself plus 1. Therefore, there is no value of x that satisfies the given equation."
