    "message_2": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method to find the roots of a real-valued function. Given a function f(x) and an initial guess x₀, the method generates a sequence of approximations to the root using the formula:\n\nxₙ₊₁ = xₙ - f(xₙ) / f'(xₙ)\n\nFor the given function f(x) = x³ - 5x + 9, we first need to find its derivative:\n\nf'(x) = 3x² - 5\n\nNow, we can apply the Newton-Raphson method using the initial guess x₀ = 2:\n\n1. x₁ = x₀ - f(x₀) / f'(x₀)\nx₁ = 2 - (2³ - 5*2 + 9) / (3*2² - 5)\nx₁ = 2 - (8 - 10 + 9) / (12 - 5)\nx₁ = 2 - (7) / (7)\nx₁ = 2 - 1\nx₁ = 1\n\n2. x₂ = x₁ - f(x₁) / f'(x₁)\nx₂ = 1 - (1³ - 5*1 + 9) / (3*1² - 5)\nx₂ = 1 - (1 - 5 + 9) / (3 - 5)\nx₂ = 1 - (5) / (-2)\nx₂ = 1 + 2.5\nx₂ = 3.5\n\n3. x₃ = x₂ - f(x₂) / f'(x₂)\nx₃ = 3.5 - (3.5³ - 5*3.5 + 9) / (3*3.5² - 5)\nx₃ ≈ 3.5 - (42.875 - 17.5 + 9) / (36.75 - 5)\nx₃ ≈ 3.5 - (34.375) / (31.75)\nx₃ ≈ 3.5 - 1.0826\nx₃ ≈ 2.4174\n\n4. x₄ = x₃ - f(x₃) / f'(x₃)\nx₄ ≈ 2.4174 - (2.4174³ - 5*2.4174 + 9) / (3*2.4174² - 5)\nx₄ ≈ 2.4174 - (14.1416 - 12.087 + 9) / (17.4801 - 5)\nx₄ ≈ 2.4174 - (11.0546) / (12.4801)\nx₄ ≈ 2.4174 - 0.8856\nx₄ ≈ 2.5318\n\nWe can continue this process until the difference between successive approximations is less than the desired level of accuracy (four decimal places in this case). However, after four iterations, we have:\n\nx₄ ≈ 2.5318\n\nThis is the approximate root of the equation f(x) = x³ - 5x + 9, correct to four decimal places, using the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of x₀ = 2."
