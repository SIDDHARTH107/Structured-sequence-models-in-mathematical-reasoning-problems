    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (in this case, individuals affected by the disease)\n- n is the sample size (in this case, 500 individuals)\n- x is the number of successes (in this case, 25 individuals affected by the disease)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the prevalence of the disease, which is 10% or 0.1)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(25) = (500C25) * (0.1^25) * (0.9^475)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 500C25:\n\n500C25 = 500! / (25! * (500-25)!)\n= 500! / (25! * 475!)\n= 2,118,760,585,387,800\n\nNow, let's calculate (0.1^25) and (0.9^475):\n\n0.1^25 = 1e-25\n0.9^475 = 5.178469e-23\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(25) = 2,118,760,585,387,800 * 1e-25 * 5.178469e-23\n= 0.01098 (approximately)\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 25 individuals out of a sample size of 500 will be affected by the disease is approximately 1.098%."
