    "message_2": "In a connected graph, the radius is the minimum eccentricity of any vertex, and the diameter is the maximum eccentricity of any vertex. The eccentricity of a vertex is the greatest distance between that vertex and any other vertex in the graph.\n\nSince the radius is 3, there exists at least one vertex with an eccentricity of 3. Now, we need to find the maximum eccentricity, which will give us the diameter.\n\nIn the worst case, the graph could be a tree with a central vertex connected to three branches, each with a length of 2. This would give us a graph with 7 vertices (1 central vertex and 6 vertices in the branches). In this case, the maximum eccentricity would be the distance between the two farthest leaf vertices, which would be 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nHowever, since the graph is connected and has only 7 vertices, it is not possible to have a diameter greater than 6. Therefore, the diameter of the graph must be less than or equal to 6.\n\nSince we know that there is at least one vertex with an eccentricity of 3 (the radius), the diameter must be greater than or equal to 3.\n\nTaking these two constraints into account, the diameter of the graph must be between 3 and 6, inclusive. Without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact value of the diameter."
