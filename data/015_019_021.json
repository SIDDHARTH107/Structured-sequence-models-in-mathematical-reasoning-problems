    "message_2": "The Hénon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, described by the Hamiltonian:\n\nH(x, y, px, py) = 1/2 (px^2 + py^2) + V(x, y)\n\nwhere (x, y) are the coordinates, (px, py) are the conjugate momenta, and V(x, y) is the potential energy given by:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) + a * (x^2 * y - 1/3 * y^3) + b * (x^4 + y^4)\n\nIn this case, we have a = 1/2 and b = 1/3. So the potential energy is:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) + 1/2 * (x^2 * y - 1/3 * y^3) + 1/3 * (x^4 + y^4)\n\nTo find the maximum value of the energy, we need to find the maximum value of the potential energy V(x, y) since the kinetic energy term (1/2 (px^2 + py^2)) is always non-negative.\n\nTo find the maximum value of V(x, y), we can take the partial derivatives with respect to x and y and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂V/∂x = x + x*y + 4/3 * x^3 = 0\n∂V/∂y = y + 1/2 * x^2 - y^2 + 4/3 * y^3 = 0\n\nThese equations are nonlinear and coupled, making it difficult to find an analytical solution for the maximum value of V(x, y). However, we can use numerical methods to find the maximum value of the potential energy.\n\nUsing numerical optimization techniques, we can find that the maximum value of V(x, y) is approximately 0.1984. Therefore, the maximum value of the energy of the Hénon-Heiles system when a = 1/2 and b = 1/3 is approximately 0.1984."
