The profit per unit for Product A is $10 and for Product B is $12. The total production capacity of the company is 500 units. The company has to fulfill the following constraints:\n- The production of Product A should be at least 100 units.\n- The production of Product B should be at least 200 units.\n- The total production of the products cannot exceed the total production capacity i.e. 500 units.\n\nHow many units of Product A and Product B should the company manufacture in order to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 12y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. x ≥ 100\n2. y ≥ 200\n3. x + y ≤ 500\n\nSince Product B has a higher profit per unit, the company should aim to produce as many units of Product B as possible while still satisfying the constraints. \n\nFirst, let's consider the constraint x + y ≤ 500. If the company produces the minimum required units of Product A (x = 100), then the maximum number of units of Product B (y) can be calculated as:\n\n100 + y ≤ 500\ny ≤ 400\n\nSince y must be at least 200, the company can produce between 200 and 400 units of Product B. To maximize profit, the company should produce 400 units of Product B. Now, let's check if this solution satisfies all constraints:\n\n1. x = 100 (satisfies constraint 1)\n2. y = 400 (satisfies constraint 2)\n3. x + y = 100 + 400 = 500 (satisfies constraint 3)\n\nThus, the company should manufacture 100 units of Product A and 400 units of Product B to maximize its profit.\n\nThe maximum profit can be calculated as:\n\nP = 10x + 12y\nP = 10(100) + 12(400)\nP = 1000 + 4800\nP = $5800"
