    "message_2": "The scaling factor of the Barnsley fern can be determined by comparing the length of the largest frond to the length of the stem. Given that the stem's length is 1 unit and the largest frond's length is 1/3 of the stem's length, the scaling factor is:\n\nScaling factor = (Length of largest frond) / (Length of stem)\nScaling factor = (1/3) / 1\nScaling factor = 1/3\n\nSo, the scaling factor of the Barnsley fern is 1/3."
