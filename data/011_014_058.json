    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we have n = 8 friends and k = 5 cities.\n\nThe Stirling number of the second kind is denoted as S(n, k) and can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nwith the base cases:\n\nS(n, 1) = 1 for all n\nS(n, n) = 1 for all n\nS(n, 0) = 0 for all n > 0\n\nUsing this recurrence relation, we can find S(8, 5):\n\nS(8, 5) = 5 * S(7, 5) + S(7, 4)\n\nS(7, 5) = 5 * S(6, 5) + S(6, 4)\nS(7, 4) = 4 * S(6, 4) + S(6, 3)\n\nS(6, 5) = 5 * S(5, 5) + S(5, 4)\nS(6, 4) = 4 * S(5, 4) + S(5, 3)\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)\n\nS(5, 5) = 1 (base case)\nS(5, 4) = 4 * S(4, 4) + S(4, 3)\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\nS(5, 2) = 2 * S(4, 2) + S(4, 1)\n\nS(4, 4) = 1 (base case)\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2)\nS(4, 2) = 2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1)\nS(4, 1) = 1 (base case)\n\nS(3, 3) = 1 (base case)\nS(3, 2) = 2 * S(2, 2) + S(2, 1)\nS(3, 1) = 1 (base case)\n\nS(2, 2) = 1 (base case)\nS(2, 1) = 1 (base case)\n\nNow we can fill in the values from the base cases and work our way up:\n\nS(3, 2) = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3\nS(4, 2) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\nS(4, 3) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\nS(5, 2) = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15\nS(5, 3) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\nS(5, 4) = 4 * 1 + 6 = 10\nS(6, 3) = 3 * 25 + 15 = 90\nS(6, 4) = 4 * 10 + 25 = 65\nS(6, 5) = 5 * 1 + 10 = 15\nS(7, 4) = 4 * 65 + 90 = 350\nS(7, 5) = 5 * 15 + 65 = 140\nS(8, 5) = 5 * 140 + 350 = 1050\n\nSo there are 1050 different ways for the 8 friends to split up into groups and visit the 5 cities."
