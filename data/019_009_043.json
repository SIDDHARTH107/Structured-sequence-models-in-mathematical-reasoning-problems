    "message_2": "To prove or disprove that $\\sqrt{2}$ is a rational number using intuitionistic logic, we first need to understand the definition of a rational number. A rational number is a number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction $\\frac{p}{q}$ of two integers, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \\neq 0$.\n\nNow, let's assume that $\\sqrt{2}$ is a rational number. Then, we can write it as $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime integers (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1) and $q \\neq 0$.\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$2 = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$\n\nRearranging the equation, we have:\n\n$p^2 = 2q^2$\n\nThis equation implies that $p^2$ is an even number since it is equal to two times another integer ($q^2$). Therefore, $p$ must also be an even number. Let's say $p = 2k$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nSubstituting $p = 2k$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$(2k)^2 = 2q^2$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$4k^2 = 2q^2$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$2k^2 = q^2$\n\nNow, this equation implies that $q^2$ is an even number, and therefore, $q$ must also be an even number.\n\nHowever, this contradicts our initial assumption that $p$ and $q$ are coprime integers since both $p$ and $q$ are even numbers, meaning they have a common divisor of 2. Thus, our assumption that $\\sqrt{2}$ is a rational number is false.\n\nUsing intuitionistic logic, we have shown that $\\sqrt{2}$ cannot be a rational number, and therefore, it must be an irrational number."
