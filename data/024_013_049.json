    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the given metric, we first need to find the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor for the given metric is:\n\ng_ij = [[1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 2, 0],\n        [0, 0, 3]]\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of the metric tensor:\n\ndet(g_ij) = 1 * (2 * 3 - 0) - 0 * (0) + 0 * (0) = 6\n\nThe volume form is given by the square root of the absolute value of the determinant of the metric tensor, multiplied by the standard volume element in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, which is dx ∧ dy ∧ dz (the wedge product of the coordinate differentials).\n\nSo, the volume form is:\n\n√|det(g_ij)| dx ∧ dy ∧ dz = √6 dx ∧ dy ∧ dz"
