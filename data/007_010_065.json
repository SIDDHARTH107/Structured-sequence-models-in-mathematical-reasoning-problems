Box 1 contains an odd number of candies, Box 2 contains a multiple of 3 candies, and Box 3 contains a number of candies that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. What is the smallest possible number of candies in Box 1?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of candies in each box as follows:\nBox 1: x (odd number)\nBox 2: y (multiple of 3)\nBox 3: z (leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4)\n\nWe are given that x + y + z = 71.\n\nSince Box 1 contains an odd number of candies, x can be any odd number. We want to find the smallest possible value for x.\n\nSince Box 2 contains a multiple of 3 candies, y can be any multiple of 3, such as 0, 3, 6, 9, etc.\n\nSince Box 3 contains a number of candies that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, z can be any number of the form 4n + 2, where n is a non-negative integer. Some examples are 2, 6, 10, 14, etc.\n\nNow, let's try to find the smallest possible value for x.\n\nIf we start with the smallest possible values for y and z, we have y = 0 (smallest multiple of 3) and z = 2 (smallest number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation x + y + z = 71:\n\nx + 0 + 2 = 71\nx = 71 - 2\nx = 69\n\nSo, the smallest possible number of candies in Box 1 is 69."
