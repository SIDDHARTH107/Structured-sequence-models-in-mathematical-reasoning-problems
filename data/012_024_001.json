    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the given graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nIn the given graph, we have:\nV = 5 (vertices: a, b, c, d, e)\nE = 6 (edges: ab, ac, bc, bd, cd, de)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of faces (F). Since the graph is not planar (it has a subgraph homeomorphic to K3,3, which is non-planar), we cannot draw it on a plane without edges crossing. Therefore, we need to consider drawing it on a surface with higher genus (e.g., a torus).\n\nBy drawing the graph on a torus, we can avoid edge crossings, and the graph will have three faces (F = 3). Now, we can use Euler's formula:\n\n5 - 6 + 3 = 2 - 2g\n2 = 2 - 2g\ng = 0\n\nSo, the genus of the given graph is 0, which means it can be drawn on a torus without edge crossings."
