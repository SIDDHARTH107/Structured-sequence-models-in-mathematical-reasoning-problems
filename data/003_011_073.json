    "message_1": "A plane flies at an altitude of 5000 feet and spots a boat in the ocean below. If the angle of depression between the plane and the boat is 30 degrees, what is the distance between the plane and the boat?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. We have the angle of depression (30 degrees) and the altitude (5000 feet). We can set up a right triangle with the altitude as the opposite side, the horizontal distance between the plane and the boat as the adjacent side, and the distance between the plane and the boat as the hypotenuse.\n\nLet's denote the horizontal distance as x and the distance between the plane and the boat as d. We can use the tangent function as follows:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(30) = 5000 / x\n\nTo find x, we can use the fact that tan(30) = 1/sqrt(3):\n\n1/sqrt(3) = 5000 / x\nx = 5000 * sqrt(3)\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance d:\n\nd^2 = x^2 + (5000)^2\nd^2 = (5000 * sqrt(3))^2 + (5000)^2\nd^2 = 5000^2 * (3 + 1)\nd^2 = 5000^2 * 4\nd = 5000 * 2\nd = 10000 feet\n\nSo, the distance between the plane and the boat is 10,000 feet."
