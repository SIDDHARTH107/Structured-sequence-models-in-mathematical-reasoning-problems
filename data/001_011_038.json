    "message_2": "To solve the equation (1/x) + (1/(x+1)) = 1/3, we will first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator is x(x+1).\n\nNow, we will rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:\n\n[(x+1) + x]/[x(x+1)] = 1/3\n\nCombine the terms in the numerator:\n\n(2x+1)/[x(x+1)] = 1/3\n\nNow, we will cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions:\n\n3(2x+1) = x(x+1)\n\nDistribute the 3 on the left side:\n\n6x + 3 = x^2 + x\n\nNow, we will move all the terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero:\n\nx^2 + x - 6x - 3 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^2 - 5x - 3 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = -3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = [5 ± sqrt((-5)^2 - 4(1)(-3))] / 2(1)\n\nx = [5 ± sqrt(25 + 12)] / 2\n\nx = [5 ± sqrt(37)] / 2\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = (5 + sqrt(37)) / 2 and x = (5 - sqrt(37)) / 2"
