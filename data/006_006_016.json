    "message_1": "In a basketball game, a player makes 70% of their free throws. If they have to take 10 free throws during the game, what is the probability that they will make all 10 of them?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of making all 10 free throws, we need to multiply the probability of making each individual free throw together. Since the player makes 70% of their free throws, the probability of making each free throw is 0.7.\n\nSo, the probability of making all 10 free throws is:\n\n0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.7^10 â‰ˆ 0.0282475\n\nThe probability of making all 10 free throws is approximately 2.82%."
