    "message_1": "Suppose a right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 10 cm and one leg of length 6 cm. What is the length of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the other leg, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, we have:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nWe know the length of the hypotenuse (c) is 10 cm and the length of one leg (a) is 6 cm. We need to find the length of the other leg (b). Plugging in the known values, we get:\n\n10^2 = 6^2 + b^2\n100 = 36 + b^2\n\nNow, we can solve for b^2:\n\nb^2 = 100 - 36\nb^2 = 64\n\nFinally, we find the length of the other leg (b) by taking the square root of 64:\n\nb = âˆš64\nb = 8\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 8 cm."
