    "message_2": "To find the Mori cone of X, we first need to find the effective curves on X. Since X is a smooth projective surface in P^3 of degree 4, it is a quartic surface. We can use the adjunction formula and intersection theory to find the effective curves on X.\n\nLet C be an irreducible curve on X. Then, by the adjunction formula, we have:\n\nK_C = (K_X + C) | _C\n\nwhere K_C is the canonical divisor of C, K_X is the canonical divisor of X, and (K_X + C) | _C denotes the restriction of the divisor (K_X + C) to C.\n\nNow, we know that the canonical divisor of P^3 is given by:\n\nK_{P^3} = -4H\n\nwhere H is the hyperplane class. Since X is a degree 4 surface, we have:\n\nX = 4H\n\nThen, the canonical divisor of X is given by the restriction of K_{P^3} to X:\n\nK_X = (K_{P^3} + X) | _X = (-4H + 4H) | _X = 0\n\nSo, K_X is trivial, and the adjunction formula becomes:\n\nK_C = C | _C\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of C with X. We have:\n\nC · X = C · 4H = 4 (C · H)\n\nSince X is a smooth surface, the intersection number C · H must be a positive integer. Therefore, the possible values for C · X are 4, 8, 12, and so on.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for C · X:\n\n1. If C · X = 4, then C is a plane curve of degree 1, i.e., a line. In this case, C | _C = 0, so K_C = 0, and C is a rational curve.\n\n2. If C · X = 8, then C is a plane curve of degree 2, i.e., a conic. In this case, C | _C = 2, so K_C = 2, and C is an elliptic curve.\n\n3. If C · X = 12, then C is a plane curve of degree 3, i.e., a cubic. In this case, C | _C = 4, so K_C = 4, and C has genus 2.\n\n4. If C · X = 16, then C is a plane curve of degree 4, i.e., a quartic. In this case, C | _C = 6, so K_C = 6, and C has genus 3.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we see that the only effective curves on X are lines (rational curves) and conics (elliptic curves). Therefore, the Mori cone of X is generated by the classes of lines and conics:\n\nMori cone of X = Cone([line], [conic])"
