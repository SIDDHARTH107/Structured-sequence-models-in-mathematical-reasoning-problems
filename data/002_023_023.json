    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the spherical water tank is 5 meters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (5^2)\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 25\n\nSurface Area = 100 * π\n\nThe surface area of the tank is approximately 100π square meters or approximately 314.16 square meters."
