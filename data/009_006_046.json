    "message_1": "Consider the chemical reaction A + B → C, where the rate of formation of product C is proportional to the concentrations of reactants A and B raised to some powers x and y, respectively. If x = 1 and y = 2, and the initial concentrations of A and B are 2 M and 3 M, respectively, find the concentration of C after 10 minutes if the rate constant k is 0.05.",
    "message_2": "Given the reaction A + B → C, the rate of formation of product C is given by the rate law:\n\nRate = k[A]^x[B]^y\n\nWhere k is the rate constant, [A] and [B] are the concentrations of reactants A and B, and x and y are the orders of the reaction with respect to A and B, respectively.\n\nWe are given that x = 1 and y = 2, and the initial concentrations of A and B are [A]₀ = 2 M and [B]₀ = 3 M, respectively. The rate constant k is 0.05. Therefore, the rate law becomes:\n\nRate = k[A][B]^2\n\nNow, we need to find the concentration of C after 10 minutes. To do this, we can use the integrated rate law. Since the reaction is second-order with respect to B, we can write the integrated rate law as:\n\n1/[B] - 1/[B]₀ = kt\n\nWe know that the initial concentration of B is [B]₀ = 3 M, and the rate constant k = 0.05. We want to find the concentration of B after 10 minutes, which is [B]. First, we need to convert 10 minutes to seconds:\n\n10 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 600 seconds\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the integrated rate law equation:\n\n1/[B] - 1/3 = 0.05 * 600\n\n1/[B] - 1/3 = 30\n\n1/[B] = 31/3\n\n[B] = 3/31\n\nNow, we can find the change in concentration of B:\n\nΔ[B] = [B]₀ - [B] = 3 - 3/31 = 90/31\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the change in concentration of B is equal to the change in concentration of A and the concentration of C formed. Therefore, the concentration of C after 10 minutes is:\n\n[C] = Δ[B] = 90/31 M"
