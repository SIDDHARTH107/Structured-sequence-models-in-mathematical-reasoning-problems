    "message_2": "To determine the nature of the singular point of the complex function f(z) = (z^2 - 1) / sin(pi*z) at z = 1/2, we first need to find the singular points of the function. A singular point occurs when the denominator of the function is equal to zero.\n\nThe denominator of the function is sin(pi*z), so we need to find the values of z for which sin(pi*z) = 0. \n\nsin(pi*z) = 0 when pi*z = n*pi, where n is an integer. Thus, z = n for any integer n. \n\nNow, let's consider the point z = 1/2. At this point, the denominator sin(pi*(1/2)) = sin(pi/2) = 1, which is not equal to zero. Therefore, z = 1/2 is not a singular point of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 1) / sin(pi*z)."
