    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to write the given system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the variable matrix, and b is the constant matrix.\n\nA = | 1  2  2 |      x = | x |      b = | 10 |\n    | 2  8  8 |          | y |          | 40 |\n    | 2  8 17 |          | z |          | 69 |\n\nNow, we need to decompose matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T, such that A = LL^T.\n\nPerforming Cholesky decomposition, we get:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |      L^T = | 1  2  2 |\n    | 2  2  0 |             | 0  2  2 |\n    | 2  2  3 |             | 0  0  3 |\n\nNow, we will solve the system in two steps:\n\n1. Solve Ly = b for y\n2. Solve L^Tx = y for x\n\nStep 1: Solve Ly = b for y\n\n| 1  0  0 | | y1 |   | 10 |\n| 2  2  0 | | y2 | = | 40 |\n| 2  2  3 | | y3 |   | 69 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 10\ny2 = 10\ny3 = 3\n\nStep 2: Solve L^Tx = y for x\n\n| 1  2  2 | | x |   | 10 |\n| 0  2  2 | | y | = | 10 |\n| 0  0  3 | | z |   |  3 |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 1."
