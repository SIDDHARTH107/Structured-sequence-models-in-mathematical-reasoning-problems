    "message_2": "To find the median and interquartile range of the temperatures, we first need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n12, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, 15, 16, 17, 90\n\nNow, let's find the median (the middle value). Since there are 10 data points, we will take the average of the two middle values (5th and 6th values):\n\nMedian = (14 + 15) / 2 = 29 / 2 = 14.5\n\nNext, we need to find the interquartile range (IQR), which is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n\nTo find Q1, we look at the lower half of the data (excluding the median if there's an odd number of data points):\n\n12, 13, 13, 14, 14\n\nSince there are 5 data points, the first quartile (Q1) is the middle value, which is 13.\n\nTo find Q3, we look at the upper half of the data (excluding the median if there's an odd number of data points):\n\n15, 15, 16, 17, 90\n\nAgain, since there are 5 data points, the third quartile (Q3) is the middle value, which is 16.\n\nNow, we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting Q1 from Q3:\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 16 - 13 = 3\n\nSo, the median of the temperatures is 14.5 degrees Celsius, and the interquartile range is 3 degrees Celsius."
