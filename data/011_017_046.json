    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. For a 3x3 Latin square, we have n = 3, and we can use the symbols 1, 2, and 3.\n\nTo count the number of distinct 3x3 Latin squares, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Fix the first row. Without loss of generality, we can assume the first row is 1, 2, 3. Any other arrangement of the first row can be transformed into this one by renaming the symbols.\n\n2. There are two possible arrangements for the second row: either 2, 3, 1 or 3, 1, 2. This is because the first element of the second row cannot be 1 (since 1 is already in the first column), and the remaining two elements must be placed in the remaining two positions.\n\n3. For each arrangement of the second row, there is only one possible arrangement for the third row, as each element must appear exactly once in each column.\n\nSo, there are 2 distinct 3x3 Latin squares possible."
