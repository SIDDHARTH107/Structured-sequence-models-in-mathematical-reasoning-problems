    "message_1": "Alice, Bob, and Charlie are volunteers for a charity event. They can each choose to work for 5 hours, 10 hours, or 15 hours. The total benefit to the charity is proportional to the total hours worked. However, if only one person volunteers, they get a huge reward while the other two get nothing. If two people volunteer, they split a smaller reward. If all three volunteers work, they split an even smaller reward.\n\nThe rewards are as follows:\n- If only one person volunteers, they get a reward of $100.\n- If two people volunteer, they each get a reward of $50.\n- If all three volunteers work, they each get a reward of $30.\n\nAssuming all three volunteers wish to maximize the benefit to the charity, what will each person choose to work? What will be the total benefit to the charity?",
    "message_2": "Since the volunteers want to maximize the benefit to the charity, they will choose to work the maximum number of hours possible. This means that Alice, Bob, and Charlie will each choose to work 15 hours.\n\nNow let's consider the rewards. If all three volunteers work, they each get a reward of $30. Since they all want to maximize the benefit to the charity, they will all choose to work and accept the smaller reward.\n\nSo, Alice, Bob, and Charlie will each work 15 hours and receive a reward of $30 each.\n\nThe total benefit to the charity will be the sum of the hours worked by all three volunteers, which is 15 hours + 15 hours + 15 hours = 45 hours. Since the benefit is proportional to the total hours worked, the total benefit to the charity will be 45 times the proportionality constant. However, since we are not given the proportionality constant, we can only say that the total benefit to the charity is proportional to 45 hours."
