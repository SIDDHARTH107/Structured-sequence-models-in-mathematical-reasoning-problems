Determine the total Betti number, b(X), of X.\n\n(Note: The Betti number b_k(X) counts the rank of the k-th homology group of X, and the total Betti number b(X) is the sum of all the individual Betti numbers.)",
    "message_2": "To find the total Betti number b(X), we need to determine the Betti numbers for each cohomology group and then sum them up.\n\nRecall that the Betti number b_k(X) is the rank of the k-th homology group H_k(X). In this problem, we are given the cohomology groups H^k(X) instead of the homology groups H_k(X). However, for a topological space X, the Betti numbers are the same for homology and cohomology groups, i.e., b_k(X) = rank(H_k(X)) = rank(H^k(X)).\n\nNow, let's determine the Betti numbers for each cohomology group:\n\n1. H^0(X) = Z: The rank of the group Z is 1, so b_0(X) = 1.\n\n2. H^1(X) = Z/2Z: The rank of the group Z/2Z is 0, as it is a finite cyclic group. Therefore, b_1(X) = 0.\n\n3. H^2(X) = Z/3Z: The rank of the group Z/3Z is 0, as it is a finite cyclic group. Therefore, b_2(X) = 0.\n\nNow, we can find the total Betti number b(X) by summing up the individual Betti numbers:\n\nb(X) = b_0(X) + b_1(X) + b_2(X) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.\n\nSo, the total Betti number of the topological space X is 1."
