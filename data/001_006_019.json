    "message_2": "To graph the parabola and determine its properties, we first need to identify the vertex, axis of symmetry, and x-intercepts.\n\n1. Vertex: The vertex of a parabola in the form y = ax² + bx + c is given by the formula:\n\nVertex (h, k) = ( -b / 2a , f(-b / 2a) )\n\nIn our equation, a = 2, b = -5, and c = 3.\n\nh = -(-5) / 2(2) = 5 / 4\nk = f(5/4) = 2(5/4)² - 5(5/4) + 3\n\nNow, we need to calculate the value of k:\n\nk = 2(25/16) - 5(5/4) + 3\nk = 50/16 - 25/4 + 3\nk = 50/16 - 100/16 + 48/16\nk = (50 - 100 + 48) / 16\nk = -2/16\nk = -1/8\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (5/4, -1/8).\n\n2. Axis of symmetry: The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex. Its equation is given by:\n\nx = h\n\nIn our case, the axis of symmetry is x = 5/4.\n\n3. X-intercepts: To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x² - 5x + 3\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (5 ± √((-5)² - 4(2)(3))) / (2 * 2)\n\nx = (5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 4\n\nx = (5 ± √1) / 4\n\nx = (5 + 1) / 4 or x = (5 - 1) / 4\n\nx = 6 / 4 or x = 4 / 4\n\nx = 3/2 or x = 1\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = 3/2 and x = 1.\n\nIn summary, the parabola y = 2x² - 5x + 3 has a vertex at (5/4, -1/8), an axis of symmetry at x = 5/4, and x-intercepts at x = 3/2 and x = 1."
