    "message_2": "To find the quadratic residues of 17, we need to find all the numbers between 1 and 16, inclusive, that have a square root modulo 17. In other words, we are looking for numbers x such that there exists an integer y satisfying the equation:\n\nx ≡ y^2 (mod 17)\n\nWe can find these quadratic residues by squaring each number between 1 and 16 (inclusive) modulo 17 and then removing duplicates:\n\n1. 1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n2. 2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\n3. 3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n4. 4^2 ≡ 16 (mod 17)\n5. 5^2 ≡ 8 (mod 17)\n6. 6^2 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\n7. 7^2 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n8. 8^2 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n9. 9^2 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n10. 10^2 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n11. 11^2 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\n12. 12^2 ≡ 8 (mod 17)\n13. 13^2 ≡ 16 (mod 17)\n14. 14^2 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n15. 15^2 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\n16. 16^2 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n\nNow, we remove duplicates and sort the results:\n\n{1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16}\n\nSo, the quadratic residues of 17 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13, 15, and 16."
