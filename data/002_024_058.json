    "message_1": "A trapezium has one side of 8 cm, another side of 15 cm, and the height is 6 cm. Find the perimeter of the trapezium.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two sides. Let's call the shorter base a (8 cm), the longer base b (15 cm), and the height h (6 cm). We can use the properties of right triangles to find the length of the other two sides.\n\nLet's call the two other sides of the trapezium c and d. We can divide the trapezium into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the vertices of the shorter base to the longer base. Let's call the length of this line x.\n\nNow, we have two right triangles. In the first right triangle, the legs are a (8 cm) and h (6 cm), and the hypotenuse is c. In the second right triangle, the legs are the difference between b and a (15 - 8 = 7 cm) and h (6 cm), and the hypotenuse is d.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of c and d:\n\nc² = a² + h²\nc² = 8² + 6²\nc² = 64 + 36\nc² = 100\nc = √100\nc = 10 cm\n\nd² = (b - a)² + h²\nd² = 7² + 6²\nd² = 49 + 36\nd² = 85\nd = √85\nd ≈ 9.22 cm (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding the lengths of all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c + d\nPerimeter = 8 + 15 + 10 + 9.22\nPerimeter ≈ 42.22 cm (rounded to two decimal places)"
