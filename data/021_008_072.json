    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\n$J(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nwhere $f_1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 25$ and $f_2(x, y) = xy - 9$. Computing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$J(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2x & 2y \\\\ y & x \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow, we apply Newton's method using the initial guess $(x_0, y_0) = (1, 1)$. The iterative formula for Newton's method for systems of equations is:\n\n$(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (x_n, y_n) - J(x_n, y_n)^{-1} \\cdot F(x_n, y_n)$\n\nwhere $F(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix} f_1(x, y) \\\\ f_2(x, y) \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nFor the first iteration, we have:\n\n$J(1, 1) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n$F(1, 1) = \\begin{bmatrix} -23 \\\\ -8 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nTo find $J(1, 1)^{-1}$, we compute the inverse of the Jacobian matrix:\n\n$J(1, 1)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{(2)(1) - (2)(1)} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSince the determinant of $J(1, 1)$ is zero, the inverse does not exist. This means that Newton's method cannot be applied directly to this system of equations with the given initial guess.\n\nHowever, we can try to find a different initial guess that allows us to apply Newton's method. Let's try with $(x_0, y_0) = (3, 3)$:\n\n$J(3, 3) = \\begin{bmatrix} 6 & 6 \\\\ 3 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n$F(3, 3) = \\begin{bmatrix} 7 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe determinant of $J(3, 3)$ is still zero, so we cannot apply Newton's method with this initial guess either.\n\nIn this case, it might be more appropriate to use a different numerical method, such as the fixed-point iteration method or the bisection method, to find the solution to this system of nonlinear equations."
