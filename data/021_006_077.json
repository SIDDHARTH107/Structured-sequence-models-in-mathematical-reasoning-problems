    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM) with a uniform mesh of step size h = 0.1 and order of approximation p = 2, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Discretize the domain: Divide the domain into a uniform mesh with step size h = 0.1. This will create a grid of 11 x 11 nodes, with a total of 121 nodes.\n\n2. Define the basis functions: Since we are using an order of approximation p = 2, we will use quadratic basis functions for both x and y directions. The basis functions can be defined as:\n\n   N_i(x) = (1 - x/h) * (1 - 2x/h) for i = 1\n   N_i(x) = 4x/h * (1 - x/h) for i = 2\n   N_i(x) = x/h * (2x/h - 1) for i = 3\n\n   N_j(y) = (1 - y/h) * (1 - 2y/h) for j = 1\n   N_j(y) = 4y/h * (1 - y/h) for j = 2\n   N_j(y) = y/h * (2y/h - 1) for j = 3\n\n3. Formulate the weak form of the PDE: Multiply the PDE by a test function and integrate over the domain. This will result in a system of linear equations in the form of [K]{u} = {F}, where [K] is the stiffness matrix, {u} is the vector of unknowns, and {F} is the force vector.\n\n4. Assemble the stiffness matrix [K] and force vector {F}: For each element in the mesh, compute the local stiffness matrix and force vector, and assemble them into the global stiffness matrix and force vector.\n\n5. Apply boundary conditions: Set the values of u(0, y) and u(1, y) to 0, and the values of ∂u/∂y(x, 0) and ∂u/∂y(x, 1) to 0.\n\n6. Solve the system of linear equations: Use a numerical method, such as the Gauss-Seidel method or the conjugate gradient method, to solve the system of linear equations [K]{u} = {F} for the unknown vector {u}.\n\n7. Compute the numerical solution u(x, y): Using the computed values of {u} and the basis functions, compute the numerical solution u(x, y) at each node in the mesh.\n\nPlease note that the actual computation of the numerical solution requires programming and the use of a software package, such as MATLAB or Python, to implement the finite element method. The steps provided above outline the general procedure for solving the given PDE using FEM with the specified parameters."
