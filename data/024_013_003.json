    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the given metric, we first need to compute the determinant of the metric tensor g_ij. The metric tensor can be represented as a matrix:\n\ng_ij = | 1   0   0 |\n       | 0  2x  0 |\n       | 0   0 3z² |\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of g_ij:\n\ndet(g_ij) = 1 * (2x * 3z² - 0) - 0 * (0 - 0) + 0 * (0 - 0) = 6x * z²\n\nThe volume form is given by the square root of the absolute value of the determinant of the metric tensor, multiplied by the standard volume element in 3-dimensional space, which is dx ∧ dy ∧ dz:\n\nvolume_form = √|det(g_ij)| dx ∧ dy ∧ dz = √(6xz²) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz\n\nSo, the volume form of the given metric is:\n\n√(6xz²) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz"
