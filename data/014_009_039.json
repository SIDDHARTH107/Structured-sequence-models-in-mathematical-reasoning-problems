    "message_1": "Suppose we have a Feistel cipher structure with 16 rounds and a block size of 64 bits. If each round uses a 48-bit key, how many total bits are used for the keys in the Feistel cipher structure?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of bits used for the keys in the Feistel cipher structure, we need to multiply the number of rounds by the number of bits used in each round's key.\n\nTotal bits = (Number of rounds) × (Bits per key)\n\nTotal bits = 16 rounds × 48 bits per key\n\nTotal bits = 768 bits\n\nSo, 768 total bits are used for the keys in the Feistel cipher structure."
