    "message_2": "To find the expected value of X(2), we can use the fact that the given stochastic differential equation is a linear stochastic differential equation with constant coefficients. This means that the expected value of X(t) will satisfy the corresponding ordinary differential equation:\n\ndE[X(t)]/dt = -2*E[X(t)]\n\nwith the initial condition E[X(0)] = 1, since X(0) = 1.\n\nNow, we can solve this ordinary differential equation:\n\ndE[X(t)]/dt + 2*E[X(t)] = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, and its solution is given by:\n\nE[X(t)] = C * exp(-2t)\n\nwhere C is a constant. Using the initial condition E[X(0)] = 1, we find that C = 1. Therefore, the expected value of X(t) is:\n\nE[X(t)] = exp(-2t)\n\nNow, we can find the expected value of X(2):\n\nE[X(2)] = exp(-2*2) = exp(-4) â‰ˆ 0.0183\n\nSo, the expected value of X(2) is approximately 0.0183."
