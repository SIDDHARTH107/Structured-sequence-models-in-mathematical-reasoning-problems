    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to compute the first and second derivatives of the position vector r(t) with respect to time t.\n\nr(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t)\n\nFirst derivative (velocity vector):\nr'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 1)\n\nSecond derivative (acceleration vector):\nr''(t) = (-cos(t), -sin(t), 0)\n\nNow, we need to find the unit tangent vector T(t) and the unit normal vector N(t).\n\nT(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)||\n\nAt t = π/4, we have:\nr'(π/4) = (-sin(π/4), cos(π/4), 1) = (-1/√2, 1/√2, 1)\n\n||r'(π/4)|| = √((-1/√2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + 1^2) = √(1/2 + 1/2 + 1) = √2\n\nT(π/4) = (-1/2, 1/2, 1/√2)\n\nNow, we find the derivative of the unit tangent vector T'(t) and its magnitude ||T'(t)||.\n\nT'(t) = (-1/2cos(t), 1/2cos(t), 0)\n\nAt t = π/4, we have:\nT'(π/4) = (-1/2cos(π/4), 1/2cos(π/4), 0) = (-1/2√2, 1/2√2, 0)\n\n||T'(π/4)|| = √((-1/2√2)^2 + (1/2√2)^2 + 0^2) = 1/√2\n\nNow, we can find the curvature κ(t) using the formula:\n\nκ(t) = ||T'(t)|| / ||r'(t)||\n\nAt t = π/4, we have:\nκ(π/4) = (1/√2) / √2 = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the torsion τ(t). First, we find the unit normal vector N(t) using the formula:\n\nN(t) = T'(t) / ||T'(t)||\n\nAt t = π/4, we have:\nN(π/4) = (-1/2√2, 1/2√2, 0) / (1/√2) = (-1, 1, 0)\n\nNow, we find the binormal vector B(t) using the formula:\n\nB(t) = T(t) x N(t)\n\nAt t = π/4, we have:\nB(π/4) = (-1/2, 1/2, 1/√2) x (-1, 1, 0) = (1/√2, -1/√2, 1)\n\nNow, we find the derivative of the binormal vector B'(t).\n\nB'(t) = (1/2sin(t), 1/2sin(t), 0)\n\nAt t = π/4, we have:\nB'(π/4) = (1/2sin(π/4), 1/2sin(π/4), 0) = (1/2√2, 1/2√2, 0)\n\nFinally, we find the torsion τ(t) using the formula:\n\nτ(t) = -B'(t) • N(t)\n\nAt t = π/4, we have:\nτ(π/4) = -(1/2√2, 1/2√2, 0) • (-1, 1, 0) = -(-1/2√2 + 1/2√2 + 0) = 0\n\nSo, the curvature κ(t) at t = π/4 is 1/2, and the torsion τ(t) at t = π/4 is 0."
