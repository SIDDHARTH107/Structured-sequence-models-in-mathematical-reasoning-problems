He takes a random sample of 50 days and finds that the mean number of cups sold is 250 with a standard deviation of 30 cups. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean daily sales of coffee cups in the shop.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean daily sales of coffee cups in the shop, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere:\nSample Mean = 250 cups (given)\nStandard Deviation = 30 cups (given)\nSample Size (n) = 50 days (given)\nCritical Value = Z-score for a 95% confidence interval (1.96)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the Standard Error (SE):\n\nStandard Error (SE) = Standard Deviation / √Sample Size\nSE = 30 / √50\nSE ≈ 4.24\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = Critical Value * Standard Error\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 4.24\nMargin of Error ≈ 8.31\n\nFinally, we can calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± Margin of Error\nConfidence Interval = 250 ± 8.31\nConfidence Interval ≈ (241.69, 258.31)\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean daily sales of coffee cups in the shop is approximately 241.69 to 258.31 cups."
