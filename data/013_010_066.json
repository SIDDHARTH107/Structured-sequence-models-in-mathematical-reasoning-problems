The market demand for this product is given by the equation P = 300 - Q, where P is the price and Q is the total quantity of the product produced by both companies. The production cost for each company is given by the equation C(Qi) = 50Qi, where Qi is the quantity produced by company i. The two companies are playing a Cournot game in which they simultaneously choose their production levels. What is the Nash equilibrium quantity of product produced by each company?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium quantity of product produced by each company, we first need to find the reaction functions for each company. The reaction function shows the best response of one company to the production level of the other company.\n\nLet Q1 be the quantity produced by company A and Q2 be the quantity produced by company B. The total quantity produced, Q, is given by Q = Q1 + Q2.\n\nThe revenue for each company is given by R(Qi) = P * Qi, where P is the price and Qi is the quantity produced by company i.\n\nSubstitute the market demand equation P = 300 - Q into the revenue equation:\n\nR(Qi) = (300 - Q) * Qi = (300 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Qi\n\nThe profit for each company is given by π(Qi) = R(Qi) - C(Qi), where C(Qi) is the cost function.\n\nSubstitute the revenue and cost equations into the profit equation:\n\nπ(Qi) = (300 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Qi - 50Qi\n\nNow we need to find the reaction functions for each company by maximizing their profit with respect to their own production level. We do this by taking the first derivative of the profit function with respect to Qi and setting it equal to 0.\n\nFor company A:\n\ndπ(Q1)/dQ1 = (300 - Q1 - Q2) - 50 - Q1 = 0\n\nSolve for Q1:\n\n250 - 2Q1 - Q2 = 0\n2Q1 = 250 - Q2\nQ1 = (250 - Q2)/2\n\nThis is the reaction function for company A.\n\nFor company B:\n\ndπ(Q2)/dQ2 = (300 - Q1 - Q2) - 50 - Q2 = 0\n\nSolve for Q2:\n\n250 - Q1 - 2Q2 = 0\n2Q2 = 250 - Q1\nQ2 = (250 - Q1)/2\n\nThis is the reaction function for company B.\n\nTo find the Nash equilibrium, we need to find the production levels where both companies' reaction functions intersect. We can do this by substituting one reaction function into the other:\n\nQ1 = (250 - Q2)/2\nQ2 = (250 - Q1)/2\n\nSubstitute the reaction function for Q2 into the equation for Q1:\n\nQ1 = (250 - ((250 - Q1)/2))/2\n\nSolve for Q1:\n\nQ1 = (500 - 250 + Q1)/4\n4Q1 = 500 - 250 + Q1\n3Q1 = 250\nQ1 = 250/3 ≈ 83.33\n\nNow substitute the value of Q1 back into the reaction function for Q2:\n\nQ2 = (250 - Q1)/2\nQ2 = (250 - 250/3)/2\nQ2 = (500/3)/2\nQ2 = 250/3 ≈ 83.33\n\nSo the Nash equilibrium quantity of product produced by each company is approximately 83.33 units."
