What is the maximum value of z reached during this time interval? At what time does it occur?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Runge-Kutta method (4th order) to approximate the solution of the Lorenz system.

The maximum value of z and the time at which it occurs will vary depending on the specific trajectory, but you can find these values by running the code above."
