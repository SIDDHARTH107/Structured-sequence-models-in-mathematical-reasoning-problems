    "message_1": "A Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter of the alphabet by a certain number of places. If a message \"HELLO\" is encrypted using a Caesar Cipher with a shift of 3, the encrypted message becomes \"KHOOR\". If a message \"MATH\" is encrypted with a Caesar Cipher with a shift of 7, what is the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH\" with a Caesar Cipher with a shift of 7, we will shift each letter 7 positions forward in the alphabet.\n\nM -> T (M + 7)\nA -> H (A + 7)\nT -> A (T + 7, wrapping around the alphabet)\nH -> O (H + 7)\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"THAO\"."
