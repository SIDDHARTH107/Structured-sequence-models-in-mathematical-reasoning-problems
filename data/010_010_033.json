    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + 2y^2 - x^3$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is given by the vector of partial derivatives:\n\n$\\nabla f(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right)$\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x - 3x^2$\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 4y$\n\nNow we need to find the points $(x, y)$ where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n$2x - 3x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x(2 - 3x) = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0 \\text{ or } x = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\n$4y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nSo we have two critical points: $(0, 0)$ and $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, 0\\right)$.\n\nNow we need to determine the Morse indices of these critical points. The Morse index is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. The Hessian matrix is given by the matrix of second partial derivatives:\n\n$H(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nLet's compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2 - 6x$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 4$\n\nNow let's evaluate the Hessian matrix at the critical points:\n\n$H(0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n$H\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, 0\\right) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues of $H(0, 0)$ are 2 and 4, both of which are positive. Therefore, the Morse index of the critical point $(0, 0)$ is 0.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $H\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, 0\\right)$ are -2 and 4, one of which is negative. Therefore, the Morse index of the critical point $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, 0\\right)$ is 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + 2y^2 - x^3$ are $(0, 0)$ with Morse index 0 and $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, 0\\right)$ with Morse index 1."
