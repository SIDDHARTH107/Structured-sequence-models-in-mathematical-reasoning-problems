    "message_1": "A student is going on a trip and has a backpack that can only hold a maximum weight of 8kg. They have 6 items to bring with them, each with a different weight: item 1 weighs 2kg, item 2 weighs 3kg, item 3 weighs 4kg, item 4 weighs 1kg, item 5 weighs 5kg, and item 6 weighs 6kg. The student must choose which items to bring with them, while also ensuring that the total weight of the items does not exceed the maximum weight the backpack can hold. What is the maximum weight the student can carry, and which items should they bring with them to achieve this maximum weight?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the weight the student can carry, we need to find the combination of items that add up to 8 kg or as close to 8 kg as possible without exceeding it. Let's consider the possible combinations:\n\n1. Items 1, 2, and 4: 2 kg + 3 kg + 1 kg = 6 kg\n2. Items 1, 3, and 4: 2 kg + 4 kg + 1 kg = 7 kg\n3. Items 2 and 3: 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg\n4. Items 1 and 5: 2 kg + 5 kg = 7 kg\n5. Items 2 and 5: 3 kg + 5 kg = 8 kg (this combination reaches the maximum weight)\n\nThe maximum weight the student can carry is 8 kg, and they should bring items 2 and 5 with them to achieve this maximum weight."
