    "message_2": "There are actually five distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 16, not three. These are:\n\n1. C16: The cyclic group of order 16.\n2. C8 × C2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n3. C4 × C4: The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4.\n4. D8: The dihedral group of order 16 (the group of symmetries of a regular octagon).\n5. Q16: The quaternion group of order 16 (a non-abelian group).\n\nTo prove that every group of order 16 is isomorphic to one of these five groups, we can use the Sylow theorems and the structure of p-groups.\n\nLet G be a group of order 16. Since 16 = 2^4, G is a 2-group. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G is congruent to 1 mod 2 and divides 16. Thus, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is either 1 or 2. However, if there were two Sylow 2-subgroups, their intersection would have order 8, which would contradict the fact that the Sylow 2-subgroups are maximal. Therefore, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal.\n\nLet H be a subgroup of G with order 8. Then G/H has order 2, so G is an extension of H by a group of order 2. Since H is normal, G acts on H by conjugation. The action of G on H induces a homomorphism from G to Aut(H), the group of automorphisms of H.\n\nNow, we consider the possible structures of H:\n\n1. If H is cyclic, then H ≅ C8, and Aut(H) ≅ C2 × C2. The homomorphism from G to Aut(H) has a kernel K, which is a normal subgroup of G. Since G is a 2-group, K has index 2 in G, so K is also normal in G. If K = G, then G is a subgroup of Aut(H), so G ≅ C16. If K = H, then G is a semidirect product of H and a group of order 2, so G ≅ C8 × C2.\n\n2. If H is not cyclic, then H ≅ C4 × C4, and Aut(H) ≅ GL(2, 2) ≅ S3. The homomorphism from G to Aut(H) has a kernel K, which is a normal subgroup of G. If K = G, then G is a subgroup of Aut(H), so G ≅ C4 × C4. If K = H, then G is a semidirect product of H and a group of order 2. There are two possibilities for this semidirect product: either G ≅ D8 or G ≅ Q16.\n\nThus, every group of order 16 is isomorphic to one of the five groups C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, D8, or Q16."
