    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 7 vertices and the degree sequence [3 3 3 2 2 1 1]. Is this degree sequence valid for the given graph? If yes, draw the graph. If no, explain why.",
    "message_2": "Yes, this degree sequence is valid for the given graph. The sum of the degrees is 3+3+3+2+2+1+1 = 15, which is an odd number. Since the sum of the degrees of a graph is equal to twice the number of edges, this graph has 15/2 = 7.5 edges, which is not possible. However, the Handshaking lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph must be even, as each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices. Therefore, this degree sequence is not valid for the given graph."
