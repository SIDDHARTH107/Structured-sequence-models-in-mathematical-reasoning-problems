    "message_1": "Here is a problem in Stochastic optimization for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose that the profit of a company is a normally distributed random variable with a mean of $50,000 and a standard deviation of $10,000. The company is trying to decide whether or not to invest in a new project that has an expected profit of $70,000. However, the success of the project depends on economic conditions, which are modeled as a Bernoulli random variable with a probability of success of 0.6. If the project is successful, the profit is expected to be $80,000, but if it fails, the company will lose $20,000.\n\nWhat is the expected profit of the company if it decides to invest in the project?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected profit of the company if it decides to invest in the project, we need to consider the probabilities of success and failure of the project.\n\nIf the project is successful (with a probability of 0.6), the profit will be $80,000. If the project fails (with a probability of 1 - 0.6 = 0.4), the company will lose $20,000.\n\nThe expected profit of the company if it invests in the project can be calculated using the formula:\n\nExpected Profit = (Probability of Success * Profit if Successful) + (Probability of Failure * Profit if Failed)\n\nExpected Profit = (0.6 * $80,000) + (0.4 * -$20,000)\n\nExpected Profit = ($48,000) + (-$8,000)\n\nExpected Profit = $40,000\n\nSo, the expected profit of the company if it decides to invest in the project is $40,000."
