    "message_1": "A rocket is launched vertically from the ground and its altitude (in meters) is given by the function $h(t)=-4.9t^2+235t$, where $t$ is the time elapsed since launch. The rocket's fuel supply is limited and it can only burn for 20 seconds. What is the maximum altitude that the rocket can reach?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum altitude the rocket can reach, we need to find the maximum value of the function $h(t)=-4.9t^2+235t$. Since the rocket can only burn for 20 seconds, we need to find the maximum value of the function within the interval $0 \\leq t \\leq 20$.\n\nThe function $h(t)$ is a quadratic function, and its graph is a parabola. The maximum value of a parabola occurs at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given by the function $f(t) = at^2 + bt + c$ is given by the formula $t_{vertex} = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\n\nIn our case, $a = -4.9$ and $b = 235$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$t_{vertex} = -\\frac{235}{2(-4.9)} \\approx 23.98$\n\nSince the rocket can only burn for 20 seconds, we need to evaluate the function at $t = 20$ to find the maximum altitude within the given interval:\n\n$h(20) = -4.9(20)^2 + 235(20) = -4.9(400) + 4700 = -1960 + 4700 = 2740$\n\nSo, the maximum altitude the rocket can reach is 2740 meters."
