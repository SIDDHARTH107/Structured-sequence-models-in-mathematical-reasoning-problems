    "message_1": "A cable company wants to run a cable from a power station on the east side of a river to a town on the west side of the river. The cable must run in a straight line underwater and emerge from the water at a point directly opposite the town. The distance from the power station to the point on the river closest to the town is 5 km. The distance from the town to the point on the river closest to the power station is 8 km. The cost of running the cable underwater is proportional to the length of the cable. What is the least expensive way for the cable company to run the cable from the power station to the town?",
    "message_2": "To find the least expensive way to run the cable, we need to find the shortest distance between the power station and the town, which will be the length of the cable. Since the cable must run in a straight line underwater and emerge from the water at a point directly opposite the town, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the shortest distance.\n\nLet the distance from the power station to the town be represented by \"c\". We know that the distance from the power station to the point on the river closest to the town is 5 km (a) and the distance from the town to the point on the river closest to the power station is 8 km (b).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n(5 km)^2 + (8 km)^2 = c^2\n\n25 + 64 = c^2\n\n89 = c^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nc = √89\n\nc ≈ 9.43 km\n\nThe least expensive way for the cable company to run the cable from the power station to the town is to run it in a straight line underwater with a length of approximately 9.43 km."
