    "message_2": "To find the amplitude of oscillation of a forced van der Pol oscillator, we need to analyze the equation of motion for the system. The equation for a forced van der Pol oscillator is given by:\n\nx''(t) - µ(1 - x^2(t))x'(t) + ω₀²x(t) = F₀cos(ωt)\n\nwhere:\nx(t) is the displacement of the oscillator at time t\nx'(t) is the velocity of the oscillator at time t\nx''(t) is the acceleration of the oscillator at time t\nµ is the damping parameter (given as 3)\nω₀ is the natural frequency of the oscillator\nF₀ is the forcing amplitude (given as 2)\nω is the forcing frequency (given as 10 Hz)\n\nTo find the amplitude of oscillation, we need to solve this nonlinear differential equation. However, solving this equation analytically is quite challenging. Instead, we can use numerical methods to approximate the solution and find the amplitude of oscillation.\n\nOne common approach to solving this type of problem is to use a numerical method like the Runge-Kutta method or the Euler method. These methods involve discretizing the time variable and iteratively solving the differential equation at each time step.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a software package like MATLAB or Python's SciPy library to solve the differential equation numerically and find the amplitude of oscillation.\n\nIn summary, finding the amplitude of oscillation for a forced van der Pol oscillator with the given parameters requires solving a nonlinear differential equation using numerical methods or specialized software."
