    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 3:\n\nx + 2y = 5\nx + 2y = 4\n\nNow we can see that the two equations are contradictory (since they have the same left-hand side but different right-hand sides). Therefore, there are no solutions to this system of linear equations."
