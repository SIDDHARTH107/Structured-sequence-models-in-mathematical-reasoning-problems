    "message_2": "To solve for x, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Add 16 to both sides of the equation:\n$2^{x+1} = 16$\n\n2. Express 16 as a power of 2:\n$2^{x+1} = 2^4$\n\n3. Since the bases are equal (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n$x+1 = 4$\n\n4. Subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n$x = 3$\n\nSo, the solution is $x = 3$."
