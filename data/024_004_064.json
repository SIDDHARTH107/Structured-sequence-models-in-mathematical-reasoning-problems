    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (0,0,0), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface by the position vector:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we find the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we find the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (∂²r/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (∂²r/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (∂²r/∂v²) = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 2uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\ne = r_uu • N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nf = r_uv • N = 0\ng = r_vv • N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface, which can be found by taking the cross product of r_u and r_v and dividing by its magnitude:\n\nN = (r_u × r_v) / |r_u × r_v| = (-2u, -2v, 1) / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature H using the formula:\n\nH = (eG - 2fF + gE) / (2(EG - F^2))\n\nAt the point (0,0,0), we have u = 0 and v = 0, so the coefficients become:\n\nE = 1, F = 0, G = 1\ne = 2, f = 0, g = 2\n\nPlugging these values into the formula for H, we get:\n\nH = (2*1 - 2*0 + 2*1) / (2(1 - 0^2)) = (2 + 2) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (0,0,0) is H = 2."
