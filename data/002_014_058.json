    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8cm, a width of 4cm, and a height of 5cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to calculate the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: top, bottom, front, back, left, and right.\n\n1. Top and bottom faces: Both are rectangles with length 8cm and width 4cm.\nArea of top face = length × width = 8 × 4 = 32 square centimeters\nArea of bottom face = length × width = 8 × 4 = 32 square centimeters\n\n2. Front and back faces: Both are rectangles with length 8cm and height 5cm.\nArea of front face = length × height = 8 × 5 = 40 square centimeters\nArea of back face = length × height = 8 × 5 = 40 square centimeters\n\n3. Left and right faces: Both are rectangles with width 4cm and height 5cm.\nArea of left face = width × height = 4 × 5 = 20 square centimeters\nArea of right face = width × height = 4 × 5 = 20 square centimeters\n\nNow, add the areas of all six faces together:\nSurface area = 32 + 32 + 40 + 40 + 20 + 20 = 184 square centimeters\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 184 square centimeters."
