    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that is generated by a series of iterations. With each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of (2√3)/3.\n\nTo find the total length of the Gosper curve after 4 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length × (Growth Factor)^Number of Iterations\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, the growth factor is (2√3)/3, and the number of iterations is 4.\n\nLength = 1 × ((2√3)/3)^4\n\nLength ≈ 1 × (2.1547)^4\n\nLength ≈ 1 × 21.5331\n\nLength ≈ 21.5331 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve after 4 iterations is approximately 21.5331 units."
