Determine the number of possible groups for each prime factor using Sylow's theorems.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, there are three possibilities:\n- Cyclic group of order 8: C_8\n- Quaternion group of order 8: Q_8\n- Elementary abelian group of order 8: C_2 x C_2 x C_2\n\nFor the prime factor 3, there is only one possibility:\n- Cyclic group of order 3: C_3\n\nFor the prime factor 5, there is only one possibility:\n- Cyclic group of order 5: C_5\n\n3. Determine the possible combinations of these groups.\n\nThere are a total of 3 * 1 * 1 = 3 possible combinations:\n- C_8 x C_3 x C_5\n- Q_8 x C_3 x C_5\n- (C_2 x C_2 x C_2) x C_3 x C_5\n\n4. Check if any of these combinations are isomorphic.\n\nIn this case, none of the combinations are isomorphic to each other.\n\nSo, there are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
