    "message_2": "First, let's find the dimension of the complex torus $\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda$. The lattice $\\Lambda$ is generated by the columns of the given matrix, which are $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} i \\\\ 2i \\end{pmatrix}$. These two vectors are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{R}$, so the rank of the lattice is 2. Since the lattice is generated by two linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{C}$, the complex torus $\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda$ is a 1-dimensional complex manifold.\n\nNow, let's find the genus $g$ of the Abelian variety defined by this torus. For a complex torus of dimension 1, the genus is equal to the dimension of the torus, which is 1 in this case.\n\nFinally, we can find the dimension of the complex torus $(\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda)^g$. Since $g=1$, we have $(\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda)^g = (\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda)^1 = \\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda$. Therefore, the dimension of the complex torus $(\\mathbb{C}/\\Lambda)^g$ is also 1."
