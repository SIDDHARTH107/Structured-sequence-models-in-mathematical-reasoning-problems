    "message_1": "A guitar string is plucked and creates a disturbance that travels down the string from one end to another with a velocity of 500 m/s. The disturbance can be modeled by a wave equation of the form y(x,t)=Asin(kx−ωt), where A is the amplitude of the wave, k is the wave number, and ω is the angular frequency. Suppose the string is 100 cm long and the ends are fixed. At time t=0, the string is plucked at the midpoint x=50 cm, causing a wave of amplitude 1cm to travel towards one end of the string. Find the frequency of the sound produced by the string.",
    "message_2": "Since the ends of the string are fixed, we have a standing wave pattern. For a standing wave on a string of length L, the allowed wavelengths are given by:\n\nλ_n = (2L) / n\n\nwhere n is an integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...). In this case, the length of the string is L = 100 cm = 1 m. The fundamental frequency (n = 1) has the longest wavelength and lowest frequency. We will consider this case to find the frequency of the sound produced by the string.\n\nThe wavelength of the fundamental frequency is:\n\nλ_1 = (2 * 1) / 1 = 2 m\n\nThe wave speed (v) is given as 500 m/s. We can relate the wave speed, wavelength, and frequency (f) using the formula:\n\nv = λ * f\n\nSolving for the frequency:\n\nf = v / λ\n\nFor the fundamental frequency:\n\nf_1 = (500 m/s) / (2 m) = 250 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency of the sound produced by the string when plucked at the midpoint is approximately 250 Hz."
