    "message_1": "In a two-player centipede game, Player 1 has a payoff of $10 and Player 2 has a payoff of $5 at the start of the game. On each turn, the players can choose to either continue or stop the game. If both players choose to continue, then each of their payoffs increases by $1. If one player chooses to stop, then the game ends and that player receives their current payoff while the other player receives nothing. What decision should Player 1 take on their first turn to maximize their payoff assuming that Player 2 will always continue the game?",
    "message_2": "If Player 2 always continues the game, Player 1 should also choose to continue the game on their first turn. This is because, by continuing, Player 1's payoff will increase by $1 each turn without any risk of losing their payoff, as Player 2 will never choose to stop the game. \n\nBy continuing the game, Player 1's payoff will keep increasing, and they can choose to stop the game at any point to secure their current payoff. Since there is no risk of Player 2 stopping the game, Player 1 can maximize their payoff by continuing the game for as long as they want."
