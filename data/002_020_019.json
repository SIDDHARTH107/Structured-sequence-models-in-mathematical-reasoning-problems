    "message_1": "A circular pizza has a diameter of 16 inches. What is the perimeter of a sector of the pizza that has a central angle of 60 degrees? (Round your answer to two decimal places.)",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius of the pizza:\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 16 inches / 2 = 8 inches\n\nNext, we'll find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\nArc length (L) = (Central angle / 360) * 2 * π * r\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 60 degrees, and the radius is 8 inches. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nL = (60 / 360) * 2 * π * 8\nL = (1/6) * 16π\nL ≈ 8.38 inches (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the sector by adding the arc length and the two radii:\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2 * Radius\nPerimeter ≈ 8.38 + 2 * 8\nPerimeter ≈ 8.38 + 16\nPerimeter ≈ 24.38 inches (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 24.38 inches."
