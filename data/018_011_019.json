    "message_2": "First, we need to find the intersection of sets A and B, which is denoted by A ∩ B. Since A contains numbers and B contains variables, there are no common elements between the two sets. Therefore, A ∩ B = {} (the empty set).\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and C, which is denoted by (A ∩ B) x C. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set.\n\nSince A ∩ B is the empty set, there are no elements in it to form ordered pairs with elements from set C. Therefore, (A ∩ B) x C = {} (the empty set)."
