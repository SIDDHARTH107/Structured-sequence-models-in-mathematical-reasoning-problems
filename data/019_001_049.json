If I only have enough money to buy one item, but I definitely want to buy at least one of them, which of the following statements represents my purchasing decision?\n\na) P or Q\nb) P and Q\nc) not P or not Q\nd) not P and not Q\n\nWhat is the correct answer and why?",
    "message_2": "The correct answer is a) P or Q.\n\nThis is because the statement \"I will buy a t-shirt\" (P) or \"I will buy a pair of jeans\" (Q) represents the purchasing decision where you will buy either one of the items but not both. Since you only have enough money to buy one item and you definitely want to buy at least one of them, the statement P or Q accurately represents your purchasing decision. \n\nThe other options do not fit the given conditions:\nb) P and Q implies that you will buy both items, which is not possible due to limited money.\nc) not P or not Q implies that you will either not buy a t-shirt or not buy a pair of jeans, which does not guarantee that you will buy at least one item.\nd) not P and not Q implies that you will not buy either item, which contradicts the condition that you want to buy at least one of them."
