    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression, we need to break down each term into its prime factors and look for perfect squares that can be simplified.\n\n√(75) - √(48) + √(27)\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factors of each number:\n\n75 = 3 × 5 × 5\n48 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3\n27 = 3 × 3 × 3\n\nNow, let's simplify each term:\n\n√(75) = √(3 × 5 × 5) = 5√3\n√(48) = √(2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3) = 4√3\n√(27) = √(3 × 3 × 3) = 3√3\n\nNow, substitute the simplified terms back into the expression:\n\n5√3 - 4√3 + 3√3\n\nNow, combine the like terms:\n\n(5 - 4 + 3)√3 = 4√3\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is:\n\n4√3"
