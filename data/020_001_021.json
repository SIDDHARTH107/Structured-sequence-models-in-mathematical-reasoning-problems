    "message_1": "A company that produces two kinds of products, apples and oranges. Each apple requires 2 hours of labor and each orange requires 1 hour of labor. The profit per apple is $10 and the profit per orange is $6. The company has 100 hours of labor available. How many of each product should they produce in order to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of apples produced and y be the number of oranges produced.\n\nThe labor constraint can be represented by the equation:\n2x + y ≤ 100\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\nP(x, y) = 10x + 6y\n\nTo find the optimal production levels, we can use the method of linear programming. First, we need to find the feasible region defined by the labor constraint. The feasible region is the set of all (x, y) pairs that satisfy the labor constraint.\n\nRearranging the labor constraint equation, we get:\ny ≤ -2x + 100\n\nThe feasible region is the set of all (x, y) pairs where y is less than or equal to -2x + 100. Since x and y represent the number of apples and oranges produced, they must be non-negative integers.\n\nNow we need to find the corner points of the feasible region. These are the points where the maximum or minimum values of the profit function can occur. The corner points are:\n\n(0, 0) - Producing no apples and no oranges\n(0, 100) - Producing no apples and 100 oranges\n(50, 0) - Producing 50 apples and no oranges\n\nNow we evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 6(0) = $0\nP(0, 100) = 10(0) + 6(100) = $600\nP(50, 0) = 10(50) + 6(0) = $500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when producing no apples and 100 oranges, with a profit of $600. Therefore, the company should produce 0 apples and 100 oranges to maximize their profit."
