    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. In other words, it counts the number of integers less than or equal to n that have a greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1 with n.\n\nTo calculate φ(12), we need to find the numbers less than or equal to 12 that are relatively prime to 12. The prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3. Now, we will use the formula for Euler's totient function for a composite number:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor n = 12, we have two distinct prime factors: 2 and 3. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nφ(12) = 12 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) = 12 * (1/2) * (2/3) = 12 * (1/3) = 4.\n\nTherefore, the value of Euler's totient function for the number 12 is 4. The numbers relatively prime to 12 are 1, 5, 7, and 11."
