    "message_2": "Goldbach's conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The smallest even number greater than or equal to 10 is 10 itself. The two smallest prime numbers that can be added up to give 10 are 3 and 7 (3 + 7 = 10). Therefore, the sum of these two prime numbers is 3 + 7 = 10."
