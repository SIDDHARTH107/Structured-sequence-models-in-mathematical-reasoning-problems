    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x, y) = (x^2 + y^2)^2 - 2(x^2 - y^2), we first need to find its partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\nfx(x, y) = ∂f/∂x = 4x(x^2 + y^2) - 4x = 4x( (x^2 + y^2) - 1)\nfy(x, y) = ∂f/∂y = 4y(x^2 + y^2) + 4y = 4y( (x^2 + y^2) + 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the points where both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\nfx(x, y) = 0 => 4x( (x^2 + y^2) - 1) = 0\nfy(x, y) = 0 => 4y( (x^2 + y^2) + 1) = 0\n\nFrom fx(x, y) = 0, we have two cases:\n1. x = 0 => y^2 = 1 => (x, y) = (0, 1) or (0, -1)\n2. x^2 + y^2 = 1 => This is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin.\n\nFrom fy(x, y) = 0, we have two cases:\n1. y = 0 => x^2 = 1 => (x, y) = (1, 0) or (-1, 0)\n2. x^2 + y^2 = -1 => This case has no real solutions.\n\nNow, we need to classify these critical points as local maxima, local minima, or saddle points. To do this, we use the second partial derivative test:\n\nfxx(x, y) = ∂²f/∂x² = 12x^2 - 4(x^2 + y^2) + 4\nfyy(x, y) = ∂²f/∂y² = 12y^2 - 4(x^2 + y^2) + 4\nfxy(x, y) = ∂²f/∂x∂y = 8xy\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix, D(x, y) = fxx(x, y) * fyy(x, y) - fxy(x, y)^2:\n\nD(x, y) = (12x^2 - 4(x^2 + y^2) + 4)(12y^2 - 4(x^2 + y^2) + 4) - (8xy)^2\n\nEvaluating D(x, y) at the critical points:\n\nD(0, 1) = 16 > 0 and fxx(0, 1) > 0 => local minimum\nD(0, -1) = 16 > 0 and fxx(0, -1) > 0 => local minimum\nD(1, 0) = 16 > 0 and fxx(1, 0) > 0 => local minimum\nD(-1, 0) = 16 > 0 and fxx(-1, 0) > 0 => local minimum\n\nThus, there are 4 critical points: 2 local minima at (0, 1) and (0, -1), and 2 local minima at (1, 0) and (-1, 0). There are no local maxima or saddle points."
