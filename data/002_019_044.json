    "message_1": "A right circular cone has a diameter of 14 cm and a slant height of 16 cm. What is the surface area of the cone? (Round your answer to the nearest tenth.)",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of the cone, we need to find the lateral surface area and the base area.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius (r) of the cone. Since the diameter is 14 cm, the radius is half of that:\n\nr = 14 cm / 2 = 7 cm\n\nNext, we need to find the height (h) of the cone. We can use the Pythagorean theorem since we have a right circular cone with slant height (l) and radius (r):\n\nl^2 = r^2 + h^2\n\nWe are given the slant height (l) as 16 cm, so we can plug in the values and solve for the height (h):\n\n16^2 = 7^2 + h^2\n256 = 49 + h^2\nh^2 = 256 - 49\nh^2 = 207\nh = √207 ≈ 14.4 cm\n\nNow we can find the lateral surface area (LSA) and the base area (BA) of the cone:\n\nLSA = π * r * l\nLSA = π * 7 cm * 16 cm\nLSA ≈ 351.9 cm^2\n\nBA = π * r^2\nBA = π * (7 cm)^2\nBA ≈ 153.9 cm^2\n\nFinally, we can find the total surface area (SA) by adding the lateral surface area and the base area:\n\nSA = LSA + BA\nSA ≈ 351.9 cm^2 + 153.9 cm^2\nSA ≈ 505.8 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 505.8 cm^2, rounded to the nearest tenth."
