    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.\n\nFor the given graph, we can find the automorphisms by considering the possible permutations of the vertices that preserve adjacency. The graph has 6 vertices, so there are 6! = 720 possible permutations. However, most of these will not be automorphisms.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the graph. Vertices 0, 2, and 4 have degree 2, while vertices 1, 3, and 5 have degree 3. Any automorphism must map vertices of the same degree to each other. Therefore, we can consider the possible permutations of the vertices within these two sets.\n\nThere are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the vertices with degree 2 (0, 2, and 4) and 3! = 6 possible permutations of the vertices with degree 3 (1, 3, and 5). However, not all of these permutations will be automorphisms. We need to check which of these permutations preserve adjacency.\n\nAfter checking the possible permutations, we find the following automorphisms:\n\n1. Identity: (0 1 2 3 4 5)\n2. (0 2)(1 3)(4 5)\n3. (0 4)(1 5)(2 3)\n4. (0 2 4)(1 3 5)\n5. (0 4 2)(1 5 3)\n\nThese 5 automorphisms form the automorphism group of the graph. The group is isomorphic to the symmetric group S3, as it has the same number of elements and the same cycle structure."
