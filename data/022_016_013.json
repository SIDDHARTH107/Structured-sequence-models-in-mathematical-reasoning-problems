    "message_1": "Suppose you have a simply connected domain in the complex plane consisting of the unit disc, i.e, the set of all complex numbers whose modulus is less than or equal to 1, centered at the origin. Using the Riemann mapping theorem, find a conformal map that transforms this domain onto the upper half-plane. What is the image of the points 0, 1, and i under this map?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Möbius transformation to find a conformal map from the unit disc to the upper half-plane. A Möbius transformation has the form:\n\nf(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d)\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are complex numbers and ad - bc ≠ 0.\n\nWe want to find a, b, c, and d such that the unit disc is mapped to the upper half-plane. We can use the following three points on the boundary of the unit disc to find the transformation:\n\n1. z = 1 (boundary point on the positive real axis)\n2. z = -1 (boundary point on the negative real axis)\n3. z = i (boundary point on the imaginary axis)\n\nWe want to map these points to the real axis, so their imaginary parts become zero. Let's find the images of these points under the transformation:\n\n1. f(1) = (a + b) / (c + d)\n2. f(-1) = (-a + b) / (-c + d)\n3. f(i) = (ai + b) / (ci + d)\n\nNow we want the imaginary parts of f(1) and f(-1) to be zero, and the imaginary part of f(i) to be positive:\n\n1. Im(f(1)) = 0 => (a + b) / (c + d) is real\n2. Im(f(-1)) = 0 => (-a + b) / (-c + d) is real\n3. Im(f(i)) > 0 => (ai + b) / (ci + d) has a positive imaginary part\n\nFrom conditions 1 and 2, we can deduce that a + b and -a + b are real, which implies that a and b are real numbers. Also, c + d and -c + d are real, which implies that c and d are real numbers as well.\n\nNow let's consider condition 3. Plugging in z = i, we get:\n\nf(i) = (ai + b) / (ci + d)\n\nSince a, b, c, and d are real, the imaginary part of f(i) is:\n\nIm(f(i)) = (ad - bc) / (c^2 + d^2)\n\nFor this to be positive, we need ad - bc > 0. We can choose a = 1, b = 0, c = 0, and d = 1, which satisfies this condition. This gives us the Möbius transformation:\n\nf(z) = z / (z + 1)\n\nNow let's find the images of the points 0, 1, and i under this map:\n\n1. f(0) = 0 / (0 + 1) = 0\n2. f(1) = 1 / (1 + 1) = 1/2\n3. f(i) = i / (i + 1) = i / (1 + i) = (i - 1) / 2\n\nSo the images of the points 0, 1, and i under the conformal map are 0, 1/2, and (i - 1) / 2, respectively."
