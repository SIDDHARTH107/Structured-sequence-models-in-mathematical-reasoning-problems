    "message_1": "A fence 100 meters in length is to be built to enclose a rectangular garden. If one side of the garden requires no fence, what dimensions should the garden have in order to maximize its area? Using calculus, find the maximum area of the garden.",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the side that requires no fence be x meters, and the other two sides be y meters each. Since the total length of the fence is 100 meters, we have:\n\nx + 2y = 100\n\nWe want to maximize the area A of the rectangular garden, which is given by:\n\nA = xy\n\nWe can solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 100 - 2y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the area equation:\n\nA(y) = (100 - 2y)y = 100y - 2y^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A(y) with respect to y and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dy = 100 - 4y\n\nNow, set dA/dy = 0 and solve for y:\n\n0 = 100 - 4y\n4y = 100\ny = 25\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 100 - 2(25) = 100 - 50 = 50\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden that maximize its area are 50 meters by 25 meters. To find the maximum area, substitute these values back into the area equation:\n\nA_max = (50)(25) = 1250 square meters"
