    "message_2": "To determine the order of the function f(z) = e^(2z)cos(z), we need to analyze its growth rate as z approaches infinity. Since e^(2z) is an entire function of order 2 and cos(z) is an entire function of order 0, the product of these two functions will have an order of 2.\n\nNow, let's find the number of zeros of f(z) in the first quadrant of the complex plane. We can use the argument principle, which states that the number of zeros minus the number of poles of a function in a region is equal to the change in the argument of the function along the boundary of the region divided by 2π.\n\nThe boundary of the first quadrant is formed by the positive real axis and the positive imaginary axis. Let's analyze the behavior of f(z) along these axes.\n\n1. Along the positive real axis (z = x, where x > 0):\n\nf(z) = e^(2x)cos(x), and the argument of f(z) is the argument of cos(x), which is 0.\n\n2. Along the positive imaginary axis (z = iy, where y > 0):\n\nf(z) = e^(2iy)cos(iy). Using Euler's formula, we have:\n\ne^(2iy) = cos(2y) + i*sin(2y)\n\nAnd using the hyperbolic cosine and sine functions, we have:\n\ncos(iy) = cosh(y)\n\nSo, f(z) = (cos(2y) + i*sin(2y))cosh(y)\n\nThe argument of f(z) along the positive imaginary axis is the argument of (cos(2y) + i*sin(2y)), which is 2y.\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in the argument of f(z) along the boundary of the first quadrant:\n\nΔarg(f(z)) = 2y - 0 = 2y\n\nSince the number of poles of f(z) in the first quadrant is 0, the number of zeros of f(z) in the first quadrant is:\n\n(number of zeros) - (number of poles) = Δarg(f(z)) / 2π\n\n(number of zeros) = (2y) / 2π\n\nHowever, this expression does not give us a specific number of zeros, as it depends on the value of y. This is because the zeros of f(z) = e^(2z)cos(z) do not have a simple pattern in the complex plane. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of zeros of f(z) in the first quadrant of the complex plane."
