    "message_1": "Here's a potential question for a math student to solve based on Game theory and Mechanism Design:\n\nSuppose there are two bidders who each have a private valuation for a painting. The painting is being sold in an auction and the seller wants to design a mechanism to maximize their revenue. The bidders have valuations of $100 and $150, respectively. The seller is considering a second-price sealed bid auction, but is also considering a different mechanism where the winner pays a price equal to the average of their and the other bidder's valuations. Which mechanism will result in higher revenue for the seller and what will that revenue be?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze both mechanisms:\n\n1. Second-price sealed bid auction:\nIn this mechanism, the highest bidder wins the auction and pays the second-highest bid. In this case, the bidder with a valuation of $150 will win the auction and pay the second-highest bid, which is $100. So, the seller's revenue in this mechanism is $100.\n\n2. Average valuation mechanism:\nIn this mechanism, the highest bidder wins the auction and pays the average of their and the other bidder's valuations. In this case, the bidder with a valuation of $150 will win the auction and pay the average of their valuation and the other bidder's valuation, which is ($150 + $100) / 2 = $125. So, the seller's revenue in this mechanism is $125.\n\nComparing the two mechanisms, the seller will have higher revenue with the average valuation mechanism, with a revenue of $125."
