    "message_2": "First, let's compute each expression:\n\n1. (A × B) △ B\nA × B = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\nNow, we compute the symmetric difference (△) between the Cartesian product (A × B) and set B.\n(A × B) △ B = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)} △ {2, 3} = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\n\n2. A × (B △ B)\nSince the symmetric difference of a set with itself is the empty set, B △ B = ∅.\nA × (B △ B) = A × ∅ = ∅\n\n3. (A △ B) × B\nFirst, we compute the symmetric difference between A and B.\nA △ B = {1, 2} △ {2, 3} = {1, 3}\nNow, we compute the Cartesian product of (A △ B) and B.\n(A △ B) × B = {1, 3} × {2, 3} = {(1,2), (1,3), (3,2), (3,3)}\n\nNow, let's compare the expressions:\n\n1. (A × B) △ B = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\n2. A × (B △ B) = ∅\n3. (A △ B) × B = {(1,2), (1,3), (3,2), (3,3)}\n\nFrom the above results, we can see that expressions 1 and 3 are not equal, and expressions 2 is not equal to either 1 or 3. Therefore, none of the expressions are equal. Here's a proof for each inequality:\n\n1 ≠ 2: Expression 1 has four elements, while expression 2 is the empty set. Since they have different numbers of elements, they cannot be equal.\n\n1 ≠ 3: Although both expressions have four elements, the elements themselves are different. Expression 1 contains (2,2) and (2,3), while expression 3 contains (3,2) and (3,3). Since they have different elements, they cannot be equal.\n\n2 ≠ 3: Expression 2 is the empty set, while expression 3 has four elements. Since they have different numbers of elements, they cannot be equal."
