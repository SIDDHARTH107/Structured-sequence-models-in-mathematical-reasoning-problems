    "message_2": "Let f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c be the polynomial of degree at most 2. We are given that f(0) = 1, f(1) = 3, and f(2) = 7. We can use these values to create a system of equations:\n\n1. f(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 1\n2. f(1) = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 3\n3. f(2) = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 7\n\nFrom equation (1), we have c = 1. Now we can substitute this value into equations (2) and (3):\n\n4. a(1) + b(1) + 1 = 3\n5. a(4) + b(2) + 1 = 7\n\nSimplifying equations (4) and (5):\n\n6. a + b = 2\n7. 4a + 2b = 6\n\nNow we can solve this system of equations. We can multiply equation (6) by 2 to make the coefficients of b the same:\n\n8. 2a + 2b = 4\n\nNow we can subtract equation (7) from equation (8):\n\n9. -2a = -2\n\nDividing both sides by -2, we get:\n\na = 1\n\nNow we can substitute the value of a back into equation (6):\n\n1 + b = 2\n\nSo, b = 1.\n\nNow we have the polynomial f(x) = 1x^2 + 1x + 1. The coefficient of x^2 in f(x) is 1."
