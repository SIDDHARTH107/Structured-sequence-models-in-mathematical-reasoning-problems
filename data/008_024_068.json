    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can first check if the equations are multiples of each other. If they are, then the system has infinite solutions.\n\nDivide the second equation by 3:\n\n(9x - 6y) / 3 = 21 / 3\n3x - 2y = 7\n\nNow we can see that both equations are the same:\n\n3x - 2y = 7\n\nSince the two equations are the same, they represent the same line, and therefore the system has infinite solutions. To express the infinite solutions, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y in terms of x:\n\n3x - 2y = 7\n-2y = -3x + 7\ny = (3/2)x - (7/2)\n\nSo the infinite solutions can be represented as:\n\ny = (3/2)x - (7/2)"
