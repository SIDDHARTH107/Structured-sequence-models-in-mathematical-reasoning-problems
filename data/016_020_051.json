    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Sierpinski pyramid, is a fractal created by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. After each iteration, the number of triangular faces increases.\n\nIn the first iteration, the original tetrahedron is divided into four smaller tetrahedra, each with 4 faces. However, the 4 smaller tetrahedra share a common face, so the total number of triangular faces is 4 * 4 - 1 = 15.\n\nIn the second iteration, each of the 4 smaller tetrahedra from the first iteration is further divided into 4 smaller tetrahedra. This results in 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 smaller tetrahedra. However, each group of 4 smaller tetrahedra shares a common face, and there are 4 such groups. So, the total number of triangular faces is 64 * 4 - 4 = 252.\n\nIn the third iteration, each of the 64 smaller tetrahedra from the second iteration is further divided into 4 smaller tetrahedra. This results in 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 256 smaller tetrahedra. However, each group of 4 smaller tetrahedra shares a common face, and there are 64 such groups. So, the total number of triangular faces is 256 * 4 - 64 = 960.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triangular faces in a Sierpinski tetrahedron after 3 iterations is 960."
