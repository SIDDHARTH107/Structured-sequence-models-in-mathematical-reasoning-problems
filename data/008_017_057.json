    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first represent the given system as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the variable matrix, and b is the constant matrix.\n\nA = | 2  1  3 |\n    | 4 -3 -5 |\n    | 2  9  1 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 11 |\n    | -1 |\n    |  6 |\n\nNow, we can use the inverse of matrix A (if it exists) to find the solution x = A_inv * b. To find the inverse of A, we can use the Gaussian elimination method or any other suitable method.\n\nUsing Gaussian elimination, we perform the following operations:\n\n1. R2 = R2 - 2 * R1\n2. R3 = R3 - R1\n3. R3 = R3 - 4 * R2\n4. R2 = R2 / (-11)\n5. R1 = R1 - R2\n6. R1 = R1 - 3 * R3\n7. R3 = R3 / 55\n\nAfter performing these operations, we get the following inverse matrix A_inv:\n\nA_inv = |  1/3  1/11  1/55 |\n        | -2/3 -1/11 -4/55 |\n        |  0    4/11  9/55 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution x by multiplying A_inv with b:\n\nx = A_inv * b\n\nx = |  1/3  1/11  1/55 |  | 11 |\n    | -2/3 -1/11 -4/55 |  | -1 |\n    |  0    4/11  9/55 |  |  6 |\n\nMultiplying the matrices, we get:\n\nx = | 3 |\n    | 1 |\n    | 2 |\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 3, y = 1, and z = 2."
