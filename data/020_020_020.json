The material cost for the top and bottom of the can is $0.05/cm², while the cost for the sides is $0.03/cm². What is the minimum cost for the material needed to manufacture the container?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost for the material needed to manufacture the container, we need to calculate the surface area of the top, bottom, and sides of the cylindrical container and then multiply each by their respective costs.\n\nThe surface area of the top and bottom of the cylinder (both are circles) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle.\n\nThe surface area of the sides of the cylinder (the lateral area) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLateral Area = 2 * π * r * h\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 10 cm, we can calculate the surface areas:\n\nTop and bottom area = π * (5 cm)² = 25π cm²\nLateral area = 2 * π * (5 cm) * (10 cm) = 100π cm²\n\nNow we can calculate the cost of each part:\n\nTop and bottom cost = 2 * (25π cm²) * ($0.05/cm²) = 50π * $0.05 = $2.50π\nLateral cost = (100π cm²) * ($0.03/cm²) = $3.00π\n\nFinally, we add the costs together to find the minimum cost for the material needed to manufacture the container:\n\nTotal cost = Top and bottom cost + Lateral cost = $2.50π + $3.00π = $5.50π ≈ $17.28"
