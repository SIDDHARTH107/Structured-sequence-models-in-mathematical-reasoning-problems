    "message_1": "Let C be an algebraic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^5 - 4x + 1, and let J(C) be the Jacobian of C. Calculate the dimension of J(C) over the field of rational numbers (i.e., the dimension of the vector space J(C)Q).",
    "message_2": "To find the dimension of J(C) over the field of rational numbers, we first need to determine the genus of the curve C. The genus of an algebraic curve can be found using the formula:\n\ng = (d - 1)(d - 2) / 2\n\nwhere d is the degree of the curve. In our case, the degree of the curve is 5 (since the highest power of x is 5). Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\ng = (5 - 1)(5 - 2) / 2 = (4)(3) / 2 = 6\n\nThe genus of the curve C is 6. The dimension of the Jacobian J(C) is equal to the genus of the curve. Therefore, the dimension of J(C) over the field of rational numbers is 6."
