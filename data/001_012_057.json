    "message_2": "First, we can factor out the common factors in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n8x^3 - 24x^2 + 16x = 8x(x^2 - 3x + 2)\n\nDenominator:\n4x^2 - 12x = 4x(x - 3)\n\nNow, we have the expression:\n\n(8x(x^2 - 3x + 2)) / (4x(x - 3))\n\nWe can simplify this further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 4x.\n\n(8x/4x)((x^2 - 3x + 2)/(x - 3))\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2(x^2 - 3x + 2) / (x - 3)\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic expression in the numerator:\n\n2(x - 1)(x - 2) / (x - 3)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n(2(x - 1)(x - 2)) / (x - 3)"
