    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = 3x² - 2x + 5 at the point x = 2, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x, denoted as f'(x), can be found using the power rule:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x² - 2x + 5)\n\nf'(x) = 3 * d/dx (x²) - 2 * d/dx (x) + d/dx (5)\n\nf'(x) = 3 * (2x) - 2 * (1) + 0\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 2\n\nNow, we need to evaluate f'(x) at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6 * (2) - 2\n\nf'(2) = 12 - 2\n\nf'(2) = 10\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = 3x² - 2x + 5 at the point x = 2 is 10."
