    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = 2te^(-3t) using complex analysis techniques, we first recall the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫₀^∞ e^(-st)f(t) dt\n\nIn our case, f(t) = 2te^(-3t). So, we need to find the Laplace transform of this function:\n\nF(s) = L{2te^(-3t)} = ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) * 2te^(-3t) dt\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(s) = 2∫₀^∞ t * e^(-(s+3)t) dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use integration by parts. Let u = t and dv = e^(-(s+3)t) dt. Then, du = dt and v = -1/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t). Applying integration by parts:\n\nF(s) = 2[-t/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t) |₀^∞ + ∫₀^∞ 1/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t) dt]\n\nThe first term in the brackets goes to zero as t approaches infinity, since the exponential term dominates:\n\nF(s) = 2[0 + ∫₀^∞ 1/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t) dt]\n\nNow, we just need to solve the remaining integral:\n\nF(s) = 2[-1/(s+3)^2 * e^(-(s+3)t) |₀^∞]\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\nF(s) = 2[-1/(s+3)^2 * (0 - 1)]\n\nF(s) = 2/(s+3)^2\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = 2te^(-3t) is F(s) = 2/(s+3)^2."
