    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem related to Auction Theory that a math student can solve:\n\nThe Sealed Bid First-Price Auction has five bidders with the following valuations for an item for sale: \n\nBidder 1: $50\nBidder 2: $75\nBidder 3: $90\nBidder 4: $100\nBidder 5: $120 \n\nAssuming that each bidder bids his or her true valuation, who is the winning bidder and what is the final price paid for the item?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed bid first-price auction, the highest bidder wins the item and pays the price they bid. Since each bidder is bidding their true valuation, we can determine the winning bidder by identifying the highest valuation.\n\nBidder 1: $50\nBidder 2: $75\nBidder 3: $90\nBidder 4: $100\nBidder 5: $120\n\nBidder 5 has the highest valuation at $120. Therefore, Bidder 5 is the winning bidder and will pay $120 for the item."
