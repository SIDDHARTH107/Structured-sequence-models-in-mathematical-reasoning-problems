    "message_1": "In a game of chance, a player rolls a fair six-sided die. What is the probability that the player rolls a number greater than 3?",
    "message_2": "There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to determine how many of these outcomes meet that condition.\n\nThere are 3 outcomes that are greater than 3: 4, 5, and 6.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the number of successful outcomes (3) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (6).\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 3/6 = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2 or 50%."
