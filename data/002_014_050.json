    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 10 cm. What is the total surface area of the prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of one of the length-width faces is 8 cm * 5 cm = 40 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 40 cm² * 2 = 80 cm².\n2. The area of one of the length-height faces is 8 cm * 10 cm = 80 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 80 cm² * 2 = 160 cm².\n3. The area of one of the width-height faces is 5 cm * 10 cm = 50 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 50 cm² * 2 = 100 cm².\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together: 80 cm² + 160 cm² + 100 cm² = 340 cm².\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 340 cm²."
