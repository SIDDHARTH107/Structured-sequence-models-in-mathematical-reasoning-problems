    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation u(x, t) = 2cos((2x + 3t)/4) + 3sin((2x - 3t)/4) for x = π/4 and t = π/6, we simply need to substitute the given values of x and t into the equation and evaluate the result.\n\nu(π/4, π/6) = 2cos((2(π/4) + 3(π/6))/4) + 3sin((2(π/4) - 3(π/6))/4)\n\nFirst, let's simplify the expressions inside the parentheses:\n\n(2(π/4) + 3(π/6))/4 = (π/2 + π/2)/4 = (2π/4)/4 = π/4\n\n(2(π/4) - 3(π/6))/4 = (π/2 - π/2)/4 = 0\n\nNow, we can substitute these simplified expressions back into the equation:\n\nu(π/4, π/6) = 2cos(π/4) + 3sin(0)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the trigonometric functions:\n\ncos(π/4) = √2/2\nsin(0) = 0\n\nFinally, substitute these values back into the equation:\n\nu(π/4, π/6) = 2(√2/2) + 3(0) = √2\n\nSo, u(π/4, π/6) = √2."
