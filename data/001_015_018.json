    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to rewrite the equation in a way that isolates x. We can do this by using logarithms. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\nGiven equation: 3^(2x+1) = 27\n\nStep 1: Rewrite 27 as a power of 3. Since 3^3 = 27, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n3^(2x+1) = 3^3\n\nStep 2: Since the bases are the same (both are 3), we can equate the exponents:\n\n2x + 1 = 3\n\nStep 3: Solve for x by isolating x:\n\n2x = 3 - 1\n2x = 2\nx = 2/2\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution is x = 1."
