    "message_2": "To solve the integral equation, we first rewrite the given equation as follows:\n\n$$f(z) = e^z + \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\frac{\\sin(z+\\theta)}{\\sin(\\theta)}f(\\theta)d\\theta.$$\n\nNow, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $z$:\n\n$$f'(z) = e^z + \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\frac{\\cos(z+\\theta)}{\\sin(\\theta)}f(\\theta)d\\theta.$$\n\nWe differentiate once more:\n\n$$f''(z) = e^z - \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\frac{\\sin(z+\\theta)}{\\sin(\\theta)}f(\\theta)d\\theta.$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the original equation back into the second derivative:\n\n$$f''(z) = e^z - f(z).$$\n\nThis is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\n$$r^2 - 1 = 0,$$\n\nwhich has roots $r = 1$ and $r = -1$. Therefore, the general solution of the homogeneous equation is:\n\n$$f_h(z) = C_1 e^z + C_2 e^{-z},$$\n\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants.\n\nNow, we need to find a particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation. Since the non-homogeneous term is $e^z$, we can guess a particular solution of the form:\n\n$$f_p(z) = A e^z,$$\n\nwhere $A$ is a constant. Substituting this into the non-homogeneous equation, we get:\n\n$$A e^z - e^z = e^z.$$\n\nSolving for $A$, we find that $A = 2$. Therefore, the particular solution is:\n\n$$f_p(z) = 2 e^z.$$\n\nNow, we can combine the homogeneous and particular solutions to find the general solution of the non-homogeneous equation:\n\n$$f(z) = C_1 e^z + C_2 e^{-z} + 2 e^z.$$\n\nTo find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$, we would need boundary conditions or additional information about the function $f(z)$. Without this information, we can only provide the general solution above."
