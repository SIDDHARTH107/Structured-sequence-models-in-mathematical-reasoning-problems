    "message_1": "A fair deck of 52 cards contains 4 aces. If you draw one card from the deck, what is the probability that it will be an ace?",
    "message_2": "There are 4 aces in a deck of 52 cards. To find the probability of drawing an ace, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 4 (the 4 aces) and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (the total number of cards in the deck).\n\nSo, the probability of drawing an ace is:\n\nProbability = 4 / 52\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nProbability = 1 / 13\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing an ace from a fair deck of 52 cards is 1/13 or approximately 0.0769 (rounded to four decimal places)."
