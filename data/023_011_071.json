    "message_2": "The given signal f(t) is a sum of two sinusoidal functions with different frequencies and amplitudes. To find the amplitude and frequency of each component, we can analyze the signal using Fourier analysis.\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a periodic function f(t) with period T is given by:\n\nf(t) = a0 + Σ[an * cos(2πnft) + bn * sin(2πnft)]\n\nwhere a0, an, and bn are the Fourier coefficients, and f is the frequency of the signal.\n\nIn our case, the given signal is:\n\nf(t) = 3cos(10πt) + 4sin(20πt)\n\nComparing this with the Fourier series representation, we can identify the coefficients and frequencies of the two sinusoidal components:\n\n1st component:\nan = 3\nfrequency, f1 = 10π / (2π) = 5 Hz\n\n2nd component:\nbn = 4\nfrequency, f2 = 20π / (2π) = 10 Hz\n\nSo, the signal f(t) consists of two sinusoidal components with amplitudes 3 and 4, and frequencies 5 Hz and 10 Hz, respectively."
