    "message_2": "To find the derivative of h(x) = f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a composite function h(x) = f(g(x)), then the derivative h'(x) is given by:\n\nh'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x).\n\nf(x) = (sinx)^2\nf'(x) = d/dx((sinx)^2) = 2(sin(x))(cos(x)), using the chain rule for the sine function.\n\ng(x) = (2x-1)^3\ng'(x) = d/dx((2x-1)^3) = 3(2x-1)^2 * 2, using the chain rule for the power function.\n\nNow, we can find h'(x) using the chain rule:\n\nh'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\nh'(x) = 2(sin(g(x)))(cos(g(x))) * 3(2x-1)^2 * 2\n\nh'(x) = 2(sin((2x-1)^3))(cos((2x-1)^3)) * 3(2x-1)^2 * 2\n\nh'(x) = 12(sin((2x-1)^3))(cos((2x-1)^3))(2x-1)^2"
