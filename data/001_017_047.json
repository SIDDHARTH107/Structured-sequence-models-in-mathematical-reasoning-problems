    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x-1) + log(x+2) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms. \n\nFirst, we can combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation using the product rule, which states that log(a) + log(b) = log(ab):\n\nlog((x-1)(x+2)) = 2\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if log(a) = b, then a = 10^b:\n\n(x-1)(x+2) = 10^2\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation:\n\nx^2 + 2x - x - 2 = 100\n\nSimplifying:\n\nx^2 + x - 2 = 100\n\nSubtract 100 from both sides to set the equation to 0:\n\nx^2 + x - 102 = 0\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 9)(x + 11) = 0\n\nSetting each factor to 0 and solving for x:\n\nx - 9 = 0 => x = 9\nx + 11 = 0 => x = -11\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 9 and -11."
