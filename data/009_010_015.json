    "message_1": "What is the theoretical price of a European call option with a strike price of $100, a current stock price of $120, with a volatility of 0.2 and a risk-free interest rate of 0.05, assuming the option has one month until expiration? Use the Black-Scholes equation to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the theoretical price of a European call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to use the following formula:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC = the price of the call option\nS = the current stock price\nX = the strike price of the option\nr = the risk-free interest rate\nT = the time until expiration (in years)\nN(d1) and N(d2) = the cumulative normal distribution function values for d1 and d2\ne = the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nwhere:\nln = the natural logarithm\nσ = the volatility of the stock\n\nGiven the problem, we have the following values:\nS = 120\nX = 100\nr = 0.05\nσ = 0.2\nT = 1 month = 1/12 years (approximately 0.0833 years)\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(120/100) + (0.05 + (0.2^2)/2) * 0.0833) / (0.2 * sqrt(0.0833))\nd1 ≈ 1.136\n\nd2 = 1.136 - 0.2 * sqrt(0.0833)\nd2 ≈ 1.009\n\nNow, we need to find the cumulative normal distribution function values for d1 and d2. Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n\nN(1.136) ≈ 0.872\nN(1.009) ≈ 0.843\n\nFinally, we can calculate the price of the call option:\n\nC = 120 * 0.872 - 100 * e^(-0.05 * 0.0833) * 0.843\nC ≈ 120 * 0.872 - 100 * 0.9959 * 0.843\nC ≈ 104.64 - 83.98\nC ≈ 20.66\n\nTherefore, the theoretical price of the European call option is approximately $20.66."
