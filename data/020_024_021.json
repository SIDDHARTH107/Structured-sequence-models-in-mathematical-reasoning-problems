    "message_1": "Suppose a company is selling a product and the demand function for the product is given by q(p) = 100 - 2p where p is the price of the product and q(p) is the quantity demanded at that price. The cost function for producing the product is C(q) = 50q + 1000 where q is the quantity produced. Determine the optimal price for the company to sell the product at in order to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price to maximize profit, we first need to find the revenue function, R(q), and the profit function, P(q).\n\nRevenue is the product of the price and the quantity sold, so we have:\n\nR(q) = p * q\n\nSince q(p) = 100 - 2p, we can solve for p in terms of q:\n\np = (100 - q) / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for p into the revenue function:\n\nR(q) = ((100 - q) / 2) * q = 50q - q^2/2\n\nNext, we find the profit function, P(q), which is the difference between the revenue and cost functions:\n\nP(q) = R(q) - C(q) = (50q - q^2/2) - (50q + 1000)\n\nSimplify the profit function:\n\nP(q) = -q^2/2 - 1000\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to q and setting it equal to 0:\n\nP'(q) = -q - 0\n\nSolve for q:\n\nq = 50\n\nNow, we need to make sure this is a maximum by checking the second derivative:\n\nP''(q) = -1\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, we have a maximum at q = 50.\n\nFinally, we need to find the optimal price, p, using the demand function:\n\np = (100 - q) / 2 = (100 - 50) / 2 = 25\n\nThus, the optimal price for the company to sell the product at in order to maximize their profit is $25."
