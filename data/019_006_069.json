    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student studying Deontic Logic:\n\nA company has a policy that states that all employees must complete a training course annually. There are 50 employees in the company. Of these, 10 have completed the training course, but 2 of them have not completed it annually. How many employees have not completed the training course, and therefore are in violation of the company's policy?",
    "message_2": "Out of the 50 employees, 10 have completed the training course. However, 2 of those 10 have not completed it annually, which means they are in violation of the company's policy. So, there are 8 employees who have completed the training course annually and are in compliance with the policy.\n\nNow, let's find out how many employees have not completed the training course at all. Since there are 50 employees in total and 8 have completed the training course annually, there are 50 - 8 = 42 employees who have not completed the training course.\n\nHowever, we must also consider the 2 employees who have completed the training course but not annually. These employees are also in violation of the company's policy. Therefore, the total number of employees in violation of the policy is 42 (those who haven't completed the course) + 2 (those who completed the course but not annually) = 44 employees."
