    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4, we need to analyze the possible structures of a group of order 8 and compare them to the structures of these three groups.\n\n1. Cyclic group C8: This group has one element of order 1 (the identity), and all other elements have order 8. It has a generator, which means that every element in the group can be expressed as a power of the generator.\n\n2. Quaternion group Q8: This group has one element of order 1 (the identity), six elements of order 4, and one element of order 2. The elements of order 4 are the \"quaternion\" elements, and the element of order 2 is the \"central\" element.\n\n3. Dihedral group D4: This group has one element of order 1 (the identity), four elements of order 2, and two elements of order 4. The elements of order 4 are the \"rotations,\" and the elements of order 2 are the \"reflections.\"\n\nNow let's analyze the possible structures of a group G of order 8:\n\n- If G has an element of order 8, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C8, since all elements can be expressed as powers of this element.\n\n- If G does not have an element of order 8 but has an element of order 4, we need to check the number of elements of order 4. If there are six elements of order 4, then G is isomorphic to Q8. If there are only two elements of order 4, then G is isomorphic to D4.\n\n- If G has no elements of order 8 or 4, then all non-identity elements must have order 2. However, this is not possible for a group of order 8, as it would imply that the group is abelian and has an element of order 8 (by the structure theorem for finite abelian groups), which contradicts our assumption.\n\nIn conclusion, to determine whether G is isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4, we need to analyze the orders of its elements. If G has an element of order 8, it is isomorphic to C8. If it has six elements of order 4, it is isomorphic to Q8. If it has two elements of order 4 and four elements of order 2, it is isomorphic to D4."
