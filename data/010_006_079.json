    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of the unit circle $S^1$, we can use the loop space definition of the fundamental group. The fundamental group $\\pi_1(S^1)$ is the set of homotopy classes of loops in $S^1$ based at a fixed point, say $(1,0)$, with the group operation being concatenation of loops.\n\nConsider the map $f: [0,1] \\to S^1$ defined by $f(t) = (\\cos(2\\pi n t), \\sin(2\\pi n t))$ for some integer $n$. This is a loop in $S^1$ starting and ending at $(1,0)$. We claim that every loop in $S^1$ is homotopic to a loop of this form, and that two loops $f_n$ and $f_m$ are homotopic if and only if $n = m$. This will show that $\\pi_1(S^1)$ is isomorphic to the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFirst, let's show that every loop in $S^1$ is homotopic to a loop of the form $f_n$. Given any loop $g: [0,1] \\to S^1$, we can lift it to a path $\\tilde{g}: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ in the universal cover of $S^1$, which is the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. Since $\\tilde{g}(0) = \\tilde{g}(1)$, the endpoints of $\\tilde{g}$ differ by an integer, say $n$. We can then define a homotopy $H: [0,1] \\times [0,1] \\to S^1$ between $g$ and $f_n$ by projecting the straight-line homotopy between $\\tilde{g}$ and the path corresponding to $f_n$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ back down to $S^1$. This shows that every loop is homotopic to a loop of the form $f_n$.\n\nNow, suppose $f_n$ and $f_m$ are homotopic for some integers $n$ and $m$. Then there is a homotopy $H: [0,1] \\times [0,1] \\to S^1$ between them. Lifting this homotopy to a homotopy $\\tilde{H}: [0,1] \\times [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ between the corresponding paths in $\\mathbb{R}$, we see that the endpoints of the lifted paths must differ by the same integer, which implies that $n = m$. Conversely, if $n = m$, then $f_n$ and $f_m$ are clearly homotopic.\n\nThus, we have shown that $\\pi_1(S^1)$ is isomorphic to the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$, with the isomorphism given by sending the homotopy class of $f_n$ to the integer $n$."
