    "message_1": "A bird is sitting on a tree branch that is 30 meters above the ground. It sees a worm on the ground that is 20 meters away from the base of the tree. What is the shortest distance the bird can fly to reach the worm? Use trigonometry to solve.",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance the bird can fly to reach the worm, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The bird's height above the ground and the horizontal distance to the worm form a right triangle, with the hypotenuse being the shortest distance the bird needs to fly.\n\nLet's denote the height of the tree branch as a (30 meters), the horizontal distance to the worm as b (20 meters), and the shortest distance the bird needs to fly as c.\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nSubstitute the values of a and b:\n\n(30)^2 + (20)^2 = c^2\n900 + 400 = c^2\n1300 = c^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the value of c:\n\nc = √1300\nc ≈ 36.06 meters\n\nSo, the shortest distance the bird can fly to reach the worm is approximately 36.06 meters."
