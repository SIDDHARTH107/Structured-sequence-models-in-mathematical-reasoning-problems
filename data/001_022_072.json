    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation y = x^3 + 3x^2 - 10x - 24, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^3 + 3x^2 - 10x - 24\n\nWe can try to factor this polynomial or use synthetic division to find the roots. In this case, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of 24 divided by the factors of 1 (the leading coefficient). So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, and ±24.\n\nBy testing these possible roots, we find that x = -4, x = 2, and x = 3 are the roots of the polynomial:\n\n0 = (x + 4)(x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are (-4, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 0).\n\nTo graph the equation on the coordinate plane using these intercepts, plot the points (-4, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 0) and draw a smooth curve through these points. The curve should start in the bottom left quadrant, pass through the x-intercepts, and end in the top right quadrant, as the leading term x^3 has a positive coefficient."
