The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {2, 4, 6}\nB = {4, 6, 8}\nA ∩ B = {4, 6}\n\nAΔB = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {2, 4, 6, 8} - {4, 6} = {2, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and C.\n\nA = {2, 4, 6}\nC = {2, 8}\nA ∩ C = {2}\n\nAΔC = (A ∪ C) - (A ∩ C) = {2, 4, 6, 8} - {2} = {4, 6, 8}\n\nNow we need to find the symmetric difference of (AΔB) and (AΔC).\n\nAΔB = {2, 8}\nAΔC = {4, 6, 8}\n(AΔB) ∩ (AΔC) = {8}\n\n(AΔB)Δ(AΔC) = ({2, 8} ∪ {4, 6, 8}) - {8} = {2, 4, 6, 8} - {8} = {2, 4, 6}\n\nNow let's check if the symmetric difference is distributive over complement.
