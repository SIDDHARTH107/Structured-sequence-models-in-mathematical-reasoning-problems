    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian matrix $J(C)$, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation defining $C$ with respect to $x$ and $y$. The equation is given by $y^2 = x^3 - 3x + 4$. \n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2) = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^3 - 3x + 4) = 3x^2 - 3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^2) = 2y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^3 - 3x + 4) = 0$\n\nNow, let's evaluate these partial derivatives at the point $P = (1, 2)$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2) \\Big|_{(1,2)} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^3 - 3x + 4) \\Big|_{(1,2)} = 3(1)^2 - 3 = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^2) \\Big|_{(1,2)} = 2(2) = 4$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^3 - 3x + 4) \\Big|_{(1,2)} = 0$\n\nFinally, let's form the Jacobian matrix $J(C)$:\n\n$J(C) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^2) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^3 - 3x + 4) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^3 - 3x + 4) \\end{bmatrix} \\Big|_{(1,2)} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix $J(C)$ at the point $P = (1, 2)$ is:\n\n$J(C) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$"
