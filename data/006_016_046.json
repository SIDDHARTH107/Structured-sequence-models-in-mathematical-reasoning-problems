    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, it is observed that 3% of the products are defective. If a batch of 500 products is manufactured, what is the probability that at least 10 products are defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective products\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of products (in this case, 500)\n- k is the number of defective products (in this case, at least 10)\n- p is the probability of a product being defective (in this case, 0.03)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having at least 10 defective products, we need to find the probability of having 10, 11, 12, ..., 500 defective products and sum them up. However, calculating this directly would be very time-consuming. Instead, we can find the probability of having 9 or fewer defective products and subtract it from 1.\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9)\n\nTo find P(X ≤ 9), we need to calculate the probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 and sum them up:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 9\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = Σ [C(500, k) * (0.03)^k * (0.97)^(500-k)] for k = 0 to 9\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) ≈ 0.416\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least 10 defective products:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9) = 1 - 0.416 ≈ 0.584\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 10 defective products in a batch of 500 is approximately 0.584 or 58.4%."
