    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 7, we need to show that G is a cyclic group itself and has the same order as the cyclic group of order 7, which is 7.\n\nSince G is a group of prime order 7, we know that |G| = 7. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup H of G must divide the order of G. In this case, the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1 and 7 (since 7 is prime).\n\nNow, let's consider an element g in G such that g ≠ e (where e is the identity element). Since the order of any subgroup must divide the order of G, the order of the subgroup generated by g, denoted as ⟨g⟩, must be either 1 or 7. If the order of ⟨g⟩ is 1, then g = e, which is a contradiction since we assumed g ≠ e. Therefore, the order of ⟨g⟩ must be 7.\n\nSince ⟨g⟩ is a subgroup of G with the same order as G, we have ⟨g⟩ = G. This means that G is a cyclic group generated by the element g. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 7, as required."
