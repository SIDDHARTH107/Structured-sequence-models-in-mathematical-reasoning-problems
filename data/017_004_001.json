    "message_2": "To find all possible groups of order 25, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 25. Since 25 = 5^2, we have that G is a p-group with p = 5. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Since the only divisors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25, the only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. However, n_5 cannot be 25 since there would be too many elements of order 5 in G (each Sylow 5-subgroup has 4 non-identity elements of order 5, and there would be 4 * 25 = 100 such elements, which is impossible since G has only 25 elements). Therefore, n_5 = 1.\n\nThis means that there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G, which we will denote by P. Since P is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup, it is normal in G. Now, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIf G is cyclic, then G is isomorphic to Z_25, the additive group of integers modulo 25. In this case, G is generated by a single element of order 25.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\nIf G is not cyclic, then every non-identity element of G must have order 5. Let a and b be two non-identity elements of G such that a is not in the subgroup generated by b. Since both a and b have order 5, the subgroups generated by a and b, denoted by <a> and <b>, are both cyclic of order 5. Moreover, since a is not in <b>, the intersection of <a> and <b> must be the identity element. \n\nNow, consider the element ab. Since a and b have order 5, we have (ab)^5 = a^5b^5 = e, where e is the identity element. Thus, ab has order at most 5. Since G is not cyclic, ab cannot have order 25, so ab must have order 5. Therefore, ab is in <a> or <b>. Without loss of generality, assume that ab is in <a>. Then, there exists an integer k such that ab = a^k. Then, b = a^(k-1), which implies that b is in <a>, a contradiction. Therefore, G cannot be non-cyclic.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 25 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. Since we have shown that G cannot be non-cyclic, the only possible groups of order 25 are cyclic, and thus isomorphic to Z_25."
