    "message_1": "Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function. Consider a vector field $X = x_1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x_2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + x_3\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ on $M$, where $x,y,z$ are coordinates on $M$ and $x_1 = e^z, x_2 = xy, x_3 = y^2$. Determine the Lie derivative of $X$ with respect to the smooth function $f$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of the vector field $X$ with respect to the smooth function $f$, we need to apply the vector field $X$ to the function $f$. In other words, we need to compute the action of $X$ on $f$, which is given by the directional derivative of $f$ along the vector field $X$. Mathematically, this is represented as:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X f = X(f) = x_1\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + x_2\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} + x_3\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for $x_1, x_2, x_3$:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X f = e^z\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + xy\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} + y^2\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}$$\n\nThis expression represents the Lie derivative of the vector field $X$ with respect to the smooth function $f$."
