    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between node A and node E, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or simply analyze the possible paths and their weights.\n\n1. A -> B -> D -> E: The path weight is 3 (A-B) + 7 (B-D) + 6 (D-E) = 16\n2. A -> C -> D -> E: The path weight is 5 (A-C) + 4 (C-D) + 6 (D-E) = 15\n3. A -> C -> E: The path weight is 5 (A-C) + 10 (C-E) = 15\n\nComparing the path weights, we can see that the shortest path between node A and node E is either A -> C -> D -> E or A -> C -> E, both with a total weight of 15."
