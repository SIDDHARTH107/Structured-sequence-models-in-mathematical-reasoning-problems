    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. It is used to solve various optimization problems, including continuous and discrete ones. In this case, we will use it to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 7.\n\nHere are the steps to perform the Harmony Search algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters: \n   - Population size (HMS) = 10\n   - Number of generations (NGEN) = 100\n   - Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR) = 0.9 (a common value)\n   - Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR) = 0.3 (a common value)\n   - Bandwidth (BW) = 0.1 (a common value)\n\n2. Generate the initial population (harmony memory) randomly within the search space. In this case, let's assume the search space is between -10 and 10.\n\n3. For each generation, create a new harmony by following these steps:\n   a. For each decision variable (in this case, x), decide whether to select a value from the harmony memory or generate a new random value. This decision is based on the HMCR value.\n   b. If a value is selected from the harmony memory, apply pitch adjustment with probability PAR. This means adjusting the value by adding or subtracting a random value within the bandwidth (BW).\n   c. Evaluate the new harmony (calculate the function value for the new x).\n   d. If the new harmony is better than the worst harmony in the harmony memory, replace the worst harmony with the new one.\n\n4. Repeat step 3 for the specified number of generations (100 in this case).\n\n5. The best harmony in the harmony memory represents the solution to the optimization problem.\n\nSince the Harmony Search algorithm is a stochastic process, the results may vary in different runs. However, after 100 generations, the algorithm should converge to a solution close to the true minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 7.\n\nNote: Implementing the Harmony Search algorithm requires programming skills and cannot be done directly in this text-based format. However, you can use various programming languages (such as Python, MATLAB, or R) to implement the algorithm and find the minimum value of the function."
