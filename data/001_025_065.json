    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation z^2 + 4z + 5 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4(1)(5))) / 2(1)\n\nz = (-4 ± √(16 - 20)) / 2\n\nz = (-4 ± √(-4)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (the value inside the square root) is negative, we will have complex solutions. We can rewrite the square root as:\n\n√(-4) = √(4 * -1) = 2√(-1) = 2i\n\nNow, we can find the two complex solutions:\n\nz = (-4 + 2i) / 2 = -2 + i\n\nz = (-4 - 2i) / 2 = -2 - i\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation z^2 + 4z + 5 = 0 are z = -2 + i and z = -2 - i."
