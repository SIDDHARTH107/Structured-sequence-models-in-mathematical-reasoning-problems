    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node A to node E, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We start by initializing the flow in each edge to 0 and then iteratively find augmenting paths from A to E, increasing the flow along the path until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, we find an augmenting path from A to E: A -> B -> D -> E. The minimum capacity along this path is 2 (edge B -> D). We increase the flow along this path by 2.\n\n```\n   A --6--> B\n  / |      / | \\\n 2  3     0  5  1\n/   |   /   |   \\\nC --4--> D --2--> E\n```\n\n2. Next, we find another augmenting path: A -> C -> D -> E. The minimum capacity along this path is 2 (edge C -> D). We increase the flow along this path by 2.\n\n```\n   A --6--> B\n  / |      / | \\\n 0  3     0  5  1\n/   |   /   |   \\\nC --2--> D --0--> E\n```\n\n3. We find another augmenting path: A -> B -> E. The minimum capacity along this path is 1 (edge B -> E). We increase the flow along this path by 1.\n\n```\n   A --5--> B\n  / |      / | \\\n 0  3     0  5  0\n/   |   /   |   \\\nC --2--> D --0--> E\n```\n\n4. We find another augmenting path: A -> C -> B -> D -> E. The minimum capacity along this path is 2 (edge C -> B). We increase the flow along this path by 2.\n\n```\n   A --3--> B\n  / |      / | \\\n 0  1     2  3  0\n/   |   /   |   \\\nC --0--> D --0--> E\n```\n\n5. We find another augmenting path: A -> B -> D -> E. The minimum capacity along this path is 3 (edge B -> D). We increase the flow along this path by 3.\n\n```\n   A --0--> B\n  / |      / | \\\n 0  1     5  0  0\n/   |   /   |   \\\nC --0--> D --3--> E\n```\n\nNow, we cannot find any more augmenting paths from A to E. The maximum flow is the sum of the flow values on the edges entering node E, which is 2 + 3 = 5. Therefore, the maximum flow that can be sent from node A to node E is 5."
