    "message_1": "A 200-pound box is lifted 6 feet off the ground by a crane. The cable used to lift the box has a weight of 50 pounds per foot. Find the work done by the crane's lifting force. Use integration to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the weight of the box as W_box and the weight of the cable as W_cable. The total weight being lifted by the crane at any given height h is the sum of the weight of the box and the weight of the cable that has been lifted.\n\nW_box = 200 pounds\nW_cable = 50 pounds/foot\n\nAt height h, the weight of the cable that has been lifted is 50h pounds. So, the total weight being lifted by the crane at height h is:\n\nW_total(h) = W_box + W_cable * h\nW_total(h) = 200 + 50h\n\nNow, we need to find the work done by the crane's lifting force. Work is the integral of force with respect to distance. In this case, the force is the total weight being lifted, and the distance is the height h. We will integrate W_total(h) with respect to h from 0 to 6 feet:\n\nWork = âˆ«(200 + 50h) dh from 0 to 6\n\nNow, we integrate:\n\nWork = [200h + (50/2)h^2] from 0 to 6\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nWork = (200(6) + (50/2)(6)^2) - (200(0) + (50/2)(0)^2)\nWork = (1200 + 900) - 0\nWork = 2100\n\nSo, the work done by the crane's lifting force is 2100 foot-pounds."
