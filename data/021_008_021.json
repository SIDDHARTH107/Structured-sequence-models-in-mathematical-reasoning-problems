    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to a system of nonlinear equations, we need to compute the Jacobian matrix and its inverse. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n          | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nFor the given system of equations, we have:\n\nf1(x, y) = x^2 - xy + y^2 - 9\nf2(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 17\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f1/∂x = 2x - y\n∂f1/∂y = -x + 2y\n∂f2/∂x = 3x^2\n∂f2/∂y = 3y^2\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x - y   -x + 2y |\n          | 3x^2      3y^2    |\n\nNow, we apply Newton's method using the initial guess (1,1):\n\n1. Compute the function values at the initial guess:\n\nf1(1, 1) = 1^2 - 1*1 + 1^2 - 9 = -6\nf2(1, 1) = 1^3 + 1^3 - 17 = -15\n\n2. Compute the Jacobian matrix at the initial guess:\n\nJ(1, 1) = | 1  1 |\n          | 3  3 |\n\n3. Compute the inverse of the Jacobian matrix:\n\n| a  b |^-1 = (1 / det) * |  d  -b |\n| c  d |                 | -c   a |\n\ndet = ad - bc = 3 - 3 = 0\n\nThe determinant of the Jacobian matrix is 0, which means the matrix is singular and its inverse does not exist. Therefore, we cannot apply Newton's method to this system of equations with the given initial guess (1,1)."
