    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5. The derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 2\n\nNow, we will apply the Newton-Raphson formula:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nwhere x0 is the initial guess (x=2) and x1 is the updated guess.\n\nf(x0) = (2)^3 - 2(2) - 5 = 8 - 4 - 5 = -1\nf'(x0) = 3(2)^2 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10\n\nx1 = 2 - (-1) / 10 = 2 + 0.1 = 2.1\n\nNow, we will repeat the process until we reach the desired precision (4 decimal places). We will use x1 as the new guess (x0) and calculate x2:\n\nf(x1) = (2.1)^3 - 2(2.1) - 5 ≈ -0.389\nf'(x1) = 3(2.1)^2 - 2 ≈ 10.83\n\nx2 = 2.1 - (-0.389) / 10.83 ≈ 2.1359\n\nWe can continue this process, but since we are asked to round to 4 decimal places, we can stop here. The root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5 using the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of x=2 is approximately x ≈ 2.1359."
