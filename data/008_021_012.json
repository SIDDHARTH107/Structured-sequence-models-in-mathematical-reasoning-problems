If it has a unique solution, find the values of x, y and z.",
    "message_2": "First, let's try to eliminate one of the variables. We can start by eliminating x. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by -2 and add it to the second equation:\n\n-2(x + 2y + 3z) = -2(7)\n-2x - 4y - 6z = -14\n\nNow add this to the second equation:\n\n(2x + 4y + 6z) + (-2x - 4y - 6z) = 14 + (-14)\n0x + 0y + 0z = 0\n\nThis equation simplifies to 0 = 0, which is always true. This means that the second equation is a multiple of the first equation and does not provide any new information.\n\nNow let's try to eliminate x from the third equation. We can multiply the first equation by -3 and add it to the third equation:\n\n-3(x + 2y + 3z) = -3(7)\n-3x - 6y - 9z = -21\n\nNow add this to the third equation:\n\n(3x + 6y + 9z) + (-3x - 6y - 9z) = 21 + (-21)\n0x + 0y + 0z = 0\n\nAgain, this equation simplifies to 0 = 0, which is always true. This means that the third equation is also a multiple of the first equation and does not provide any new information.\n\nSince the second and third equations are multiples of the first equation, we essentially have only one equation with three variables:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 7\n\nThis system does not have a unique solution, as there are infinitely many combinations of x, y, and z that can satisfy this equation."
