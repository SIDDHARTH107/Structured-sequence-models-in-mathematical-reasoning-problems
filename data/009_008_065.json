    "message_1": "A wave propagates along a string with speed 20 m/s. The wave is described by the equation $y(x,t)= 0.1sin(6t-0.02x)$, where $y$ is the displacement of the string at position $x$ and time $t$ in meters and seconds respectively. Find the wavelength, frequency and amplitude of the wave.",
    "message_2": "To find the wavelength, frequency, and amplitude of the wave, we need to analyze the given wave equation:\n\n$y(x,t) = 0.1\\sin(6t - 0.02x)$\n\nThis equation is in the form of a sinusoidal wave function:\n\n$y(x,t) = A\\sin(\\omega t - kx)$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $k$ is the wave number.\n\nComparing the given equation with the general form, we can identify the following:\n\nAmplitude, $A = 0.1$ meters\n\nAngular frequency, $\\omega = 6$ rad/s\n\nWave number, $k = 0.02$ rad/m\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength and frequency using the following relationships:\n\nWavelength, $\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{k}$\n\nFrequency, $f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$\n\nCalculating the wavelength:\n\n$\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{0.02}$\n\n$\\lambda = 100\\pi$ meters\n\nCalculating the frequency:\n\n$f = \\frac{6}{2\\pi}$\n\n$f = \\frac{3}{\\pi}$ Hz\n\nSo, the amplitude, wavelength, and frequency of the wave are:\n\nAmplitude: $0.1$ meters\n\nWavelength: $100\\pi$ meters\n\nFrequency: $\\frac{3}{\\pi}$ Hz"
