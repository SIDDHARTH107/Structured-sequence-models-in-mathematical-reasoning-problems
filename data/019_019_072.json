If it is computable, provide an algorithm or program that can compute the value of f(x) for any input x. If it is not computable, explain why.",
    "message_2": "The function f(x) = 2x + 1 is computable. This is because it can be computed using a finite number of steps and basic arithmetic operations (multiplication and addition) for any given input x.\n\nHere's an algorithm to compute the value of f(x) for any input x:\n\n1. Take the input value x.\n2. Multiply x by 2.\n3. Add 1 to the result obtained in step 2.\n4. The result obtained in step 3 is the value of f(x).\n\nFor example, if the input value is x = 3, the algorithm would proceed as follows:\n\n1. Take the input value x = 3.\n2. Multiply x by 2: 3 * 2 = 6.\n3. Add 1 to the result obtained in step 2: 6 + 1 = 7.\n4. The result obtained in step 3 is the value of f(x): f(3) = 7.\n\nThis algorithm can be implemented in a programming language, such as Python:\n\n```python\ndef f(x):\n    return 2 * x + 1\n\nx = 3\nresult = f(x)\nprint(\"f({}) = {}\".format(x, result))\n```\n\nThis program would output: \"f(3) = 7\"."
