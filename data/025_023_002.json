    "message_2": "To find the intersection cohomology groups of the algebraic variety defined by the given equation system, we first need to analyze the variety and its singularities.\n\nThe given system of equations is:\n\n1) x + y + z = 0\n2) x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express z as z = -x - y. Substituting this into equation (2), we get:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + (-x - y)^2 = r^2\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = r^2\n2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2xy = r^2\n\nDividing by 2, we get:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + xy = (r^2)/2\n\nNow, let's analyze the variety. The equation x^2 + y^2 + xy = (r^2)/2 defines a smooth affine algebraic curve in the xy-plane. This curve is non-singular, as it does not have any singular points. The third variable z is determined by the linear equation z = -x - y, which is also smooth. Therefore, the algebraic variety defined by the given system of equations is a smooth three-dimensional variety.\n\nFor a smooth variety, the intersection cohomology groups coincide with the usual cohomology groups. In this case, we can use the singular cohomology groups with complex coefficients. The variety is a 2-dimensional complex manifold, so we have the following non-zero cohomology groups:\n\nH^0(V, ℂ) = ℂ (the constant functions)\nH^2(V, ℂ) = ℂ (the holomorphic 2-forms)\n\nAll other cohomology groups are zero:\n\nH^k(V, ℂ) = 0 for k ≠ 0, 2\n\nSo, the intersection cohomology groups of the given algebraic variety are:\n\nIH^0(V, ℂ) = ℂ\nIH^2(V, ℂ) = ℂ\nIH^k(V, ℂ) = 0 for k ≠ 0, 2"
