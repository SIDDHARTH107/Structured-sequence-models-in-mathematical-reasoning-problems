    "message_1": "Consider an auction where there are 3 bidders who value the item as follows: Bidder 1 values it at $100, Bidder 2 values it at $90, and Bidder 3 values it at $80. The auction is a sealed bid second price auction, meaning the highest bidder wins and pays the second-highest bid as the price. If Bidder 1 bids $70, Bidder 2 bids $60, and Bidder 3 bids $50, who wins the auction and what is the price they pay for the item?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed bid second price auction, the highest bidder wins and pays the second-highest bid as the price. In this case, the bids are as follows:\n\nBidder 1: $70\nBidder 2: $60\nBidder 3: $50\n\nBidder 1 has the highest bid at $70, so they win the auction. The second-highest bid is $60 from Bidder 2, so Bidder 1 pays $60 for the item."
