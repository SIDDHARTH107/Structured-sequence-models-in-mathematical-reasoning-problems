    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the total curvature of a surface to its Euler characteristic. For a closed surface like a unit sphere, the theorem states:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ(S)\n\nwhere K is the Gaussian curvature, dA is the area element, and χ(S) is the Euler characteristic of the surface S.\n\nFor a unit sphere, the Gaussian curvature K is constant and equal to 1/R^2, where R is the radius of the sphere. Since the sphere is a unit sphere, R = 1, so K = 1.\n\nThe Euler characteristic χ(S) for a sphere is 2.\n\nNow we can apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ(S)\n∫∫_S (1) dA = 2π(2)\n\nTo find the total curvature, we integrate the Gaussian curvature over the surface of the sphere:\n\n∫∫_S dA = 4π\n\nNow we can substitute this result back into the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\n4π = 2π(2)\n\nThus, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem holds for the unit sphere, and the total curvature of the unit sphere is 4π."
