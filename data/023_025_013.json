    "message_2": "To determine the frequency of the bending vibration mode of the aluminum sheet, we can use the following equation for the natural frequency of a thin rectangular plate:\n\nf = (1 / 2π) * √(D / ρh²)\n\nwhere f is the natural frequency, D is the flexural rigidity, ρ is the density, and h is the thickness of the sheet.\n\nThe flexural rigidity D can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nD = (Eh³) / (12(1 - ν²))\n\nwhere E is the Young's modulus, h is the thickness, and ν is the Poisson's ratio. For aluminum, the Poisson's ratio is approximately 0.33.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to the appropriate units:\n\nThickness (h): 1.5 mm = 0.0015 m\nYoung's modulus (E): 70 GPa = 70 * 10^9 N/m²\nDensity (ρ): 2.7 g/cm³ = 2700 kg/m³\n\nNow, we can calculate the flexural rigidity (D):\n\nD = (70 * 10^9 * (0.0015)^3) / (12(1 - 0.33²))\nD ≈ 3.67 * 10^-7 Nm\n\nNext, we can calculate the natural frequency (f):\n\nf = (1 / 2π) * √((3.67 * 10^-7) / (2700 * (0.0015)^2))\nf ≈ 0.0018 Hz\n\nUsing the Fourier transform, we can determine that the frequency of the bending vibration mode of the aluminum sheet is approximately 0.0018 Hz. Note that this is a very simplified model, and the actual frequency may be affected by factors such as boundary conditions, shape, and size of the sheet."
