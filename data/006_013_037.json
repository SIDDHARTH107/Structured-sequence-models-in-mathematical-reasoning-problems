    "message_2": "To find the probability of a region experiencing a tornado in a given year, we can use the historical data provided. The region experiences an average of 3 tornadoes every 5 years. \n\nTo find the average number of tornadoes per year, we can divide the total number of tornadoes (3) by the total number of years (5):\n\n3 tornadoes / 5 years = 0.6 tornadoes per year\n\nSince we want the probability of at least one tornado occurring in a given year, we can use the Poisson distribution formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, tornadoes) occurring in a fixed interval of time (one year).\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (tornadoes), k is the specific number of events we are interested in (at least 1 tornado), λ is the average rate of events (0.6 tornadoes per year), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nTo find the probability of at least one tornado occurring in a given year, we can first find the probability of no tornadoes occurring (k = 0) and then subtract that from 1:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.6) * 0.6^0) / 0! = e^(-0.6) = 0.5488 (approximately)\n\nNow, subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one tornado:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - 0.5488 = 0.4512 (approximately)\n\nSo, the probability that a region experiences a tornado in a given year, based on the historical data, is approximately 0.4512 or 45.12%."
