    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of operations on the augmented matrix to transform it into an upper triangular matrix. Then, we will use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations is:\n\n```\n| 1  2  3 | 6 |\n| 2  3  1 | 2 |\n| 3  1  4 | 7 |\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo eliminate x from the second row, we can replace the second row with (-2 times the first row) + (second row):\n\n```\n|  1  2  3 |  6  |\n|  0 -1 -5 | -10 |\n|  3  1  4 |  7  |\n```\n\nTo eliminate x from the third row, we can replace the third row with (-3 times the first row) + (third row):\n\n```\n|  1  2  3 |  6  |\n|  0 -1 -5 | -10 |\n|  0 -5 -5 | -11 |\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo eliminate y from the third row, we can replace the third row with (-5 times the second row) + (third row):\n\n```\n|  1  2  3 |  6  |\n|  0 -1 -5 | -10 |\n|  0  0 20 |  40 |\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nNow that we have an upper triangular matrix, we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z. Starting with the third row:\n\n20z = 40\n\nz = 40 / 20 = 2\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it into the second row to find the value of y:\n\n-1y - 5(2) = -10\n\n-1y - 10 = -10\n\ny = 0\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of y and z into the first row to find the value of x:\n\nx + 2(0) + 3(2) = 6\n\nx + 6 = 6\n\nx = 0\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 2."
