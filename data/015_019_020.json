    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium points of the Henon-Heiles system, we need to find the points where the gradient of the potential energy is zero. The potential energy V(x, y) is given by the last three terms of the Hamiltonian:\n\nV(x, y) = (1/2)*(x^2 + y^2) + x^2*y - (1/3)*y^3\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of V(x, y) with respect to x and y:\n\n∂V/∂x = x + 2*x*y\n∂V/∂y = y + x^2 - y^2\n\nAt the equilibrium points, these partial derivatives are zero:\n\nx + 2*x*y = 0\ny + x^2 - y^2 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this system of equations. From the first equation, we have:\n\nx(1 + 2*y) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possibilities:\n\n1) x = 0\n2) 1 + 2*y = 0 => y = -1/2\n\nFor the first case (x = 0), we substitute x into the second equation:\n\ny - y^2 = 0\ny(1 - y) = 0\n\nThis gives us two equilibrium points: (x, y) = (0, 0) and (x, y) = (0, 1).\n\nFor the second case (y = -1/2), we substitute y into the second equation:\n\n-1/2 + x^2 - (1/4) = 0\nx^2 = 1/4\n\nThis gives us two equilibrium points: (x, y) = (1/2, -1/2) and (x, y) = (-1/2, -1/2).\n\nSo, the equilibrium points of the Henon-Heiles system are:\n\n(0, 0), (0, 1), (1/2, -1/2), and (-1/2, -1/2)."
