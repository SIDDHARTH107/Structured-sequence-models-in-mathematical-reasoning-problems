    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to represent the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 7\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nb = \\begin{bmatrix}\n6 \\\\\n15 \\\\\n22\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow we need to find the Cholesky decomposition of A, which is a lower triangular matrix L such that A = LL^T.\n\nL = \\begin{bmatrix}\nl_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\\nl_{21} & l_{22} & 0 \\\\\nl_{31} & l_{32} & l_{33}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nTo find the elements of L, we can use the following formulas:\n\nl_{11} = \\sqrt{a_{11}} = \\sqrt{1} = 1\n\nl_{21} = a_{21}/l_{11} = 2/1 = 2\n\nl_{31} = a_{31}/l_{11} = 3/1 = 3\n\nl_{22} = \\sqrt{a_{22} - l_{21}^2} = \\sqrt{5 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1\n\nl_{32} = (a_{32} - l_{31}l_{21})/l_{22} = (5 - 3*2)/1 = -1\n\nl_{33} = \\sqrt{a_{33} - l_{31}^2 - l_{32}^2} = \\sqrt{7 - 3^2 - (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1\n\nSo, L = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n3 & -1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow we need to solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n3 & -1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\ny_2 \\\\\ny_3\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n6 \\\\\n15 \\\\\n22\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny_1 = 6\n\ny_2 = 15 - 2*y_1 = 15 - 2*6 = 3\n\ny_3 = 22 - 3*y_1 + y_2 = 22 - 3*6 + 3 = 4\n\nNow we need to solve the system L^Tx = y for x:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n6 \\\\\n3 \\\\\n4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx_3 = 4\n\nx_2 = 3 + x_3 = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nx_1 = 6 - 2*x_2 - 3*x_3 = 6 - 2*7 - 3*4 = -13\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -13, y = 7, z = 4"
