    "message_1": "Suppose that there are 100 employees working in a company and the probability of a fraud committed by an employee is 0.05. What is the probability that at least 5 employees commit fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 5 employees commit fraud, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability that fewer than 5 employees commit fraud. We can then subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that at least 5 employees commit fraud.\n\nThe probability of exactly k employees committing fraud can be found using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the total number of employees (100), k is the number of employees committing fraud, p is the probability of an employee committing fraud (0.05), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nWe need to find the probability of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 employees committing fraud and then subtract the sum of these probabilities from 1.\n\nP(X < 5) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula for each value of k:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * 0.05^0 * (1-0.05)^(100-0) ≈ 0.00592\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * 0.05^1 * (1-0.05)^(100-1) ≈ 0.03116\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * 0.05^2 * (1-0.05)^(100-2) ≈ 0.08118\nP(X = 3) = C(100, 3) * 0.05^3 * (1-0.05)^(100-3) ≈ 0.13956\nP(X = 4) = C(100, 4) * 0.05^4 * (1-0.05)^(100-4) ≈ 0.17814\n\nNow, sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X < 5) ≈ 0.00592 + 0.03116 + 0.08118 + 0.13956 + 0.17814 ≈ 0.43596\n\nFinally, subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that at least 5 employees commit fraud:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) ≈ 1 - 0.43596 ≈ 0.56404\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 employees commit fraud is approximately 0.564 or 56.4%."
