    "message_2": "Cauchy's theorem states that if a function is analytic (holomorphic) within and on a simple closed curve C, then the integral of the function over the curve C is zero.\n\nThe function f(z) = z^2 + 2z is a polynomial function, which means it is analytic everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, Cauchy's theorem can be applied to this problem.\n\nSince f(z) is analytic within and on the curve C, which is the circle |z-1| = 2, the integral of f(z) over the curve C in the counterclockwise direction is:\n\n∫(z^2 + 2z)dz = 0"
