    "message_1": "Suppose two players, Alice and Bob, are about to play a trust game. Alice starts with $10 and decides how much to send to Bob, who receives triple the amount Alice sends. Bob then decides how much of the received amount to return to Alice.\n\nIf Alice sends $4 to Bob, how much should Bob send back to maximize the total amount of money they both have?",
    "message_2": "If Alice sends $4 to Bob, Bob will receive 3 * $4 = $12. Now, Bob needs to decide how much to send back to Alice to maximize the total amount of money they both have.\n\nLet's denote the amount Bob sends back as x. Then, Alice will have $10 - $4 + x = $6 + x, and Bob will have $12 - x.\n\nTo maximize the total amount of money they both have, we need to maximize the sum of their individual amounts: ($6 + x) + ($12 - x) = $18.\n\nSince x does not affect the sum, Bob can send any amount back to Alice, and the total amount of money they both have will still be $18. However, to maintain a fair and trusting relationship, it would be reasonable for Bob to send back an amount close to what Alice initially sent, such as $4 or more."
