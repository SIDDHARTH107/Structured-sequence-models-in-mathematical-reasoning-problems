    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts (zeros) of the polynomial equation, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x + 6\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding the zeros can be challenging. However, we can try to find integer factors of the constant term (6) and test them as potential zeros using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible integer factors of 6 are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6.\n\nLet's test these values:\n\nFor x = 1:\n0 = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 11(1) + 6\n0 = 1 - 6 + 11 + 6\n0 = 12\n\nThis is not a zero.\n\nFor x = -1:\n0 = (-1)^3 - 6(-1)^2 + 11(-1) + 6\n0 = -1 - 6 - 11 + 6\n0 = -12\n\nThis is not a zero.\n\nFor x = 2:\n0 = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 11(2) + 6\n0 = 8 - 24 + 22 + 6\n0 = 12 - 24\n0 = -12\n\nThis is not a zero.\n\nFor x = -2:\n0 = (-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 + 11(-2) + 6\n0 = -8 - 24 - 22 + 6\n0 = -48 + 6\n0 = -42\n\nThis is not a zero.\n\nFor x = 3:\n0 = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 11(3) + 6\n0 = 27 - 54 + 33 + 6\n0 = 66 - 54\n0 = 12\n\nThis is not a zero.\n\nFor x = -3:\n0 = (-3)^3 - 6(-3)^2 + 11(-3) + 6\n0 = -27 - 54 - 33 + 6\n0 = -108 + 6\n0 = -102\n\nThis is not a zero.\n\nFor x = 6:\n0 = (6)^3 - 6(6)^2 + 11(6) + 6\n0 = 216 - 216 + 66 + 6\n0 = 66\n\nThis is not a zero.\n\nFor x = -6:\n0 = (-6)^3 - 6(-6)^2 + 11(-6) + 6\n0 = -216 - 216 - 66 + 6\n0 = -492\n\nThis is not a zero.\n\nNone of the integer factors of 6 are zeros of the polynomial. However, we can use numerical methods (such as the Newton-Raphson method or synthetic division) to approximate the zeros:\n\nx ≈ 1.289, 2.000, and 2.711\n\nThese are the approximate x-intercepts (zeros) of the polynomial equation.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = (0)^3 - 6(0)^2 + 11(0) + 6\ny = 0 - 0 + 0 + 6\ny = 6\n\nThe y-intercept of the polynomial equation is (0, 6)."
