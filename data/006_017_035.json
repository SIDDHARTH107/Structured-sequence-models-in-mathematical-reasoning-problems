    "message_1": "A study shows that in a certain area, the probability of a car accident on a specific road during a snowy day is 0.25, and the probability of a car accident on that same road during a non-snowy day is 0.1. If the probability of a snowy day is 0.3, what is the probability of a car accident occurring on that road in this area on any given day?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a car accident occurring on that road in this area on any given day, we can use the law of total probability. The law of total probability states that the probability of an event (in this case, a car accident) can be found by multiplying the probability of each scenario (snowy or non-snowy day) by the probability of the event occurring in that scenario, and then summing these products.\n\nLet A be the event of a car accident, S be the event of a snowy day, and N be the event of a non-snowy day. We are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(A|S) = 0.25 (probability of a car accident on a snowy day)\nP(A|N) = 0.1 (probability of a car accident on a non-snowy day)\nP(S) = 0.3 (probability of a snowy day)\n\nSince there are only two possible scenarios (snowy or non-snowy), the probability of a non-snowy day is:\n\nP(N) = 1 - P(S) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\n\nNow, we can use the law of total probability to find the probability of a car accident on any given day:\n\nP(A) = P(A|S) * P(S) + P(A|N) * P(N)\nP(A) = (0.25 * 0.3) + (0.1 * 0.7)\nP(A) = 0.075 + 0.07\nP(A) = 0.145\n\nSo, the probability of a car accident occurring on that road in this area on any given day is 0.145 or 14.5%."
