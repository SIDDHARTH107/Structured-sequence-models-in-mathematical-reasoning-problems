    "message_2": "The surface area of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2 * π * r * (r + h)\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 4 cm and the height (h) is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = 2 * π * 4 * (4 + 10)\n\nSurface Area = 2 * π * 4 * 14\n\nSurface Area = 8 * π * 14\n\nSurface Area ≈ 8 * 3.14159 * 14\n\nSurface Area ≈ 351.8584 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately 351.86 cm²."
