    "message_2": "To find the complex conjugate of the function f(z), we need to replace z with its complex conjugate, which is denoted as z*. The complex conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi. Then, we need to find the complex conjugate of the resulting expression.\n\nLet's find the complex conjugate of f(z):\n\nf(z*) = exp(3z* + 2i) - 2(z*)^2 + 4i(z*) - 5\n\nNow, let z* = a - bi, where a and b are real numbers. Then:\n\nf(z*) = exp(3(a - bi) + 2i) - 2(a - bi)^2 + 4i(a - bi) - 5\n\nNow, we need to find the complex conjugate of this expression. To do this, we replace i with -i wherever it appears:\n\nf*(z*) = exp(3(a + bi) - 2i) - 2(a + bi)^2 - 4i(a + bi) - 5\n\nThis is the complex conjugate of the function f(z)."
