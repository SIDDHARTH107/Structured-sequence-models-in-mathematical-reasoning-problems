    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting a sum of 15 when rolling a dice five times, we can use the concept of generating functions. However, since this is a relatively advanced topic, we will use a simpler method to solve this problem.\n\nLet's consider the possible ways to get a sum of 15 when rolling a dice five times. We can represent the outcomes as (a, b, c, d, e), where a, b, c, d, and e are the results of each roll, and 1 ≤ a, b, c, d, e ≤ 6.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes (i.e., the number of ways to get a sum of 15). We can do this by finding the partitions of 15 into 5 parts, each part being between 1 and 6.\n\nThe partitions are:\n(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n(1, 2, 4, 4, 4)\n(1, 3, 3, 4, 4)\n(2, 2, 2, 4, 5)\n(2, 2, 3, 3, 5)\n(2, 2, 3, 4, 4)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of permutations for each partition. This can be done using the multinomial coefficient formula:\n\nMultinomial Coefficient = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the counts of each distinct item.\n\nFor the partition (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), there are 5! / (1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!) = 120 permutations.\n\nFor the partition (1, 2, 4, 4, 4), there are 5! / (1! * 1! * 3!) = 20 permutations.\n\nFor the partition (1, 3, 3, 4, 4), there are 5! / (1! * 2! * 2!) = 30 permutations.\n\nFor the partition (2, 2, 2, 4, 5), there are 5! / (3! * 1! * 1!) = 20 permutations.\n\nFor the partition (2, 2, 3, 3, 5), there are 5! / (2! * 2! * 1!) = 30 permutations.\n\nFor the partition (2, 2, 3, 4, 4), there are 5! / (2! * 1! * 2!) = 30 permutations.\n\nThe total number of favorable outcomes is the sum of the permutations for each partition: 120 + 20 + 30 + 20 + 30 + 30 = 250.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling a dice five times is 6^5 = 7776.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting a sum of 15 when rolling a dice five times is:\n\nP(sum = 15) = (number of favorable outcomes) / (total number of possible outcomes) = 250 / 7776 ≈ 0.03215 or 3.215%."
