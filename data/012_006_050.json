    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian circuit is a path that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. To find the length of the Hamiltonian circuit in this graph, we need to find the shortest path that visits all vertices and returns to the starting point.\n\nLet's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, and E, as shown below:\n\n![Graph with labels](https://i.imgur.com/5Q5QoQJ.png)\n\nNow, let's find the shortest Hamiltonian circuit:\n\n1. Start at vertex A.\n2. Move to vertex B (cost = 2).\n3. Move to vertex C (cost = 3).\n4. Move to vertex D (cost = 4).\n5. Move to vertex E (cost = 5).\n6. Return to vertex A (cost = 1).\n\nThe total cost of this Hamiltonian circuit is 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 15. Therefore, the length of the Hamiltonian circuit in this graph is 15."
