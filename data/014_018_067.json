    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted an encrypted message that was encrypted with a substitution cipher, and you know that the original message was in English. The encrypted message contains the letter \"H\" exactly 12 times. Assuming that \"H\" was encrypted with the same substitution letter each time, what letter was \"H\" most likely encrypted with?",
    "message_2": "To determine the most likely letter that \"H\" was encrypted with, we can look at the frequency of letters in the English language. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. Since the encrypted message has the letter \"H\" appearing 12 times, we can assume that it might represent a common letter in the English language.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively determine which letter \"H\" was encrypted with based on this information alone. It could be any of the common letters, or even a less common letter, depending on the specific substitution cipher used. Further analysis of the encrypted message and the frequency of other letters would be necessary to make a more accurate determination."
