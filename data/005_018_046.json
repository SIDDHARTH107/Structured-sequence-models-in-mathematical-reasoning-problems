    "message_1": "Based on survival analysis, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose a group of 100 individuals was followed for 5 years to observe the survival rate of a certain disease. If 20 individuals got the disease at year 2 and 10 individuals died at year 4, what is the probability that an individual would survive for the full 5 years without contracting the disease?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of an individual not contracting the disease and surviving for the full 5 years.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of not contracting the disease. Out of the 100 individuals, 20 contracted the disease at year 2. Therefore, 80 individuals did not contract the disease.\n\nProbability of not contracting the disease = (Number of individuals not contracting the disease) / (Total number of individuals) = 80/100 = 0.8\n\nNext, let's find the probability of surviving for the full 5 years. Out of the 100 individuals, 10 died at year 4. Therefore, 90 individuals survived until year 4.\n\nProbability of surviving until year 4 = (Number of individuals surviving until year 4) / (Total number of individuals) = 90/100 = 0.9\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of both events happening: not contracting the disease and surviving for the full 5 years. Since these events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities.\n\nProbability of surviving for the full 5 years without contracting the disease = (Probability of not contracting the disease) * (Probability of surviving until year 4) = 0.8 * 0.9 = 0.72\n\nTherefore, the probability that an individual would survive for the full 5 years without contracting the disease is 0.72 or 72%."
