    "message_2": "Using Ramsey theory, we can solve this problem by finding the minimum number of handshakes needed to guarantee that either a group of 3 people have all shaken hands with each other (a \"triangle\" of handshakes) or a group of 3 people have not shaken hands with each other (an \"anti-triangle\" of non-handshakes).\n\nLet's denote R(m, n) as the minimum number of people needed to guarantee either an m-sized triangle or an n-sized anti-triangle. In this case, we want to find R(3, 3).\n\nWe can use the following formula for Ramsey numbers: R(m, n) = R(m-1, n) + R(m, n-1) - 1.\n\nTo find R(3, 3), we first need to find R(2, 3) and R(3, 2).\n\nR(2, 3) = R(1, 3) + R(2, 2) - 1\nR(1, 3) = 3 (since it takes 3 people to guarantee a 1-sized triangle or a 3-sized anti-triangle)\nR(2, 2) = 2 (since it takes 2 people to guarantee a 2-sized triangle or a 2-sized anti-triangle)\nSo, R(2, 3) = 3 + 2 - 1 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, R(3, 2) = R(2, 2) + R(3, 1) - 1\nR(3, 1) = 3 (since it takes 3 people to guarantee a 3-sized triangle or a 1-sized anti-triangle)\nSo, R(3, 2) = 2 + 3 - 1 = 4.\n\nNow, we can find R(3, 3):\nR(3, 3) = R(2, 3) + R(3, 2) - 1\nR(3, 3) = 4 + 4 - 1 = 7.\n\nSo, it takes a minimum of 7 handshakes to guarantee that either 3 people have all shaken hands with each other or 3 people have not shaken hands with each other among 6 people in a room."
