    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 108 and 192 using the Euclidean algorithm, we will perform a series of divisions with remainders until we reach a remainder of 0. The last non-zero remainder will be the GCD.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (192) by the smaller number (108) and find the remainder:\n192 รท 108 = 1 (remainder 84)\n\n2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number (108) and the smaller number with the remainder (84) from the previous step:\n108 รท 84 = 1 (remainder 24)\n\n3. Repeat the process:\n84 รท 24 = 3 (remainder 12)\n\n4. And again:\n24 รท 12 = 2 (remainder 0)\n\nSince we've reached a remainder of 0, the last non-zero remainder (12) is the GCD of 108 and 192. So, the GCD(108, 192) = 12."
