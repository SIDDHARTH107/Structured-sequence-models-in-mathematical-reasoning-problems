    "message_1": "Suppose you roll a dice once, and you will win the game if you roll a number that is greater than 4. What is the probability of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "To win the game, you need to roll a 5 or a 6. There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a dice (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), and 2 of those outcomes are winning outcomes (5 and 6). Therefore, the probability of winning the game is:\n\nP(winning) = (number of winning outcomes) / (total possible outcomes) = 2/6 = 1/3\n\nSo, the probability of winning the game is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333 (33.33%)."
