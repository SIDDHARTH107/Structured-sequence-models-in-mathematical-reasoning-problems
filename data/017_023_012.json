    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of these groups, we will first analyze the structure of G using Sylow theorems. The order of G is 72, which can be factored as 2^3 * 3^2. \n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 9. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^3 = 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup and one 3-Sylow subgroup, both of which are normal in G. Let P be the 2-Sylow subgroup and Q be the 3-Sylow subgroup. Since P and Q are both normal, their direct product PQ is also normal in G. Moreover, |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 8 * 9 = 72, which implies that G = PQ. Since P and Q are abelian, G is also abelian. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C72.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, which is normal in G. Let Q be the 3-Sylow subgroup. Then, G acts on the set of 2-Sylow subgroups by conjugation, and this action induces a homomorphism from G to S_9. The kernel of this homomorphism contains Q, and the order of the image divides both |G| and |S_9|, which implies that the order of the image is a divisor of 8. If the order of the image is 8, then G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of Q and a 2-Sylow subgroup, which is one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72. If the order of the image is less than 8, then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_4, which is the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, and the same arguments apply. G is either isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2 or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G is isomorphic to one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C72, the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2, or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72, depending on the number of 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups."
