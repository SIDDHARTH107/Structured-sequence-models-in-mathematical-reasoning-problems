    "message_1": "Here's a question based on Auction Theory:\n\nSuppose there are two bidders in an auction, each with a private valuation of a painting being auctioned. The auction follows a second-price sealed-bid format, and the bidders only learn about the winning bid after the auction is over. \n\nBidder 1's valuation of the painting is $10,000 and Bidder 2's valuation is $8,000. Both bidders follow a strategy of bidding their true valuations. \n\nWhat is the winning bid and how much does the winning bidder pay?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid price. In this case, Bidder 1 has the highest valuation at $10,000, and Bidder 2 has the second-highest valuation at $8,000. \n\nSince both bidders are bidding their true valuations, Bidder 1 wins the auction with a bid of $10,000. However, they only pay the second-highest bid, which is $8,000."
