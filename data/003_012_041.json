    "message_1": "A person standing on a cliff observes a boat at an angle of depression of 30 degrees. If the cliff is 50 meters high, find the distance between the boat and the foot of the cliff. (Assume the person is standing at the edge of the cliff).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. Since we have the angle of depression and the height of the cliff, we can use the tangent function to find the distance between the boat and the foot of the cliff.\n\nLet's denote the distance between the boat and the foot of the cliff as x. We know that the angle of depression is 30 degrees, and the height of the cliff is 50 meters. We can set up the following equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(30°) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(30°) = 50 / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 50 / tan(30°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nx ≈ 50 / 0.57735\nx ≈ 86.6025\n\nSo, the distance between the boat and the foot of the cliff is approximately 86.6 meters."
