    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1} ∪ {7} = {1, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the sets A and B. The intersection is the set of elements that are in both A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 5}\n\nTo show that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over their intersection, we need to prove the following:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = (A ∩ B) ∆ (A ∩ B)\n\nLet's find the left side of the equation:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = {1, 7} ∩ {3, 5} = ∅ (empty set)\n\nNow let's find the right side of the equation:\n\n(A ∩ B) ∆ (A ∩ B) = {3, 5} ∆ {3, 5} = ∅ (empty set)\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, we have shown that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over their intersection:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B) = (A ∩ B) ∆ (A ∩ B)"
