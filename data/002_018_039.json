    "message_2": "To find the volume of a sphere inscribed in a cube, we first need to determine the diameter of the sphere. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, its diameter is equal to the length of one edge of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Edge of the cube = 6 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the sphere by dividing the diameter by 2:\n\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 6 cm / 2 = 3 cm\n\nThe formula to find the volume of a sphere is:\n\nVolume (V) = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nSubstitute the value of the radius (r = 3 cm) into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (3 cm)^3\nV = (4/3) * π * 27 cm^3\nV = (4 * 27 * π) / 3\nV = 108π / 3\nV = 36π cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube is approximately 36π cubic centimeters, or approximately 113.097 cubic centimeters."
