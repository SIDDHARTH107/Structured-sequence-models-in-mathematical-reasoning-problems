    "message_1": "Suppose there are three mathematicians, A, B, and C, and one of them knows the answer to a math problem while the other two don't. Each of the mathematicians knows whether or not they themselves know the answer. If A knows the answer, then B and C both know that A knows. Likewise, if B knows the answer, then A and C both know that B knows, and if C knows the answer, then A and B both know that C knows. If two of the mathematicians each say, \"I don't know,\" then who knows the answer to the math problem?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. Suppose A says, \"I don't know.\" This means A doesn't know the answer, and now B and C are aware that A doesn't know the answer.\n\n2. Now, suppose B says, \"I don't know.\" This means B doesn't know the answer either, and now A and C are aware that B doesn't know the answer.\n\nAt this point, both A and B have stated that they don't know the answer. Since there are only three mathematicians and one of them knows the answer, it must be C who knows the answer. A and B are also aware of this, as they know that one of them must know the answer and they have both confirmed that they don't know it. Therefore, C knows the answer to the math problem."
