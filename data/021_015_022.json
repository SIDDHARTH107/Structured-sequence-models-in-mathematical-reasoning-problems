    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. Here, we will use PSO to find the minimum value of the given function f(x, y) = 2x² - 5xy + 3y² within the specified range of x and y.\n\n1. Initialize parameters:\n- Number of particles: N = 50\n- Number of iterations: T = 100\n- Inertia weight: w = 0.7\n- Acceleration constants: c1 = 2, c2 = 2\n- Initialize particles' positions and velocities randomly within the given range.\n\n2. For each iteration t = 1, 2, ..., T:\n   a. For each particle i = 1, 2, ..., N:\n      i. Evaluate the fitness of the particle: f(x_i, y_i)\n      ii. Update the personal best position (pbest) if the current position has a better fitness.\n   b. Update the global best position (gbest) if any particle has a better fitness than the current gbest.\n   c. For each particle i = 1, 2, ..., N:\n      i. Update the velocity of the particle using the following equation:\n         v_i = w * v_i + c1 * rand() * (pbest_i - x_i) + c2 * rand() * (gbest - x_i)\n      ii. Update the position of the particle using the following equation:\n         x_i = x_i + v_i\n      iii. Make sure the updated positions are within the given range.\n\n3. After all iterations, the gbest position represents the approximate minimum value of the function.\n\nSince PSO is a heuristic algorithm, the results may vary slightly with each run. However, the approximate minimum value of the function f(x, y) = 2x² - 5xy + 3y² within the specified range of x and y can be found using this method."
