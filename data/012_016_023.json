    "message_2": "The Tutte polynomial, also known as the Tutte–Whitney polynomial, is a graph invariant that generalizes several other graph invariants, such as the chromatic polynomial and the flow polynomial. It is defined as T(x, y) = ∑(r, k) A(r, k) x^(r - k) y^(k - c), where A(r, k) is the number of spanning subgraphs with r connected components and k edges, and c is the number of connected components in the original graph.\n\nFor the given graph, let's label the edges as follows:\n\n```\n      A---B\n      e1  e2\n      | / |\n      C---D\n      e3  e4\n```\n\nNow, we will compute the Tutte polynomial by considering all possible subgraphs and their corresponding connected components and edges:\n\n1. Empty subgraph: 1 connected component, 0 edges\n2. Subgraph with only e1: 2 connected components, 1 edge\n3. Subgraph with only e2: 2 connected components, 1 edge\n4. Subgraph with only e3: 2 connected components, 1 edge\n5. Subgraph with only e4: 2 connected components, 1 edge\n6. Subgraph with e1 and e2: 1 connected component, 2 edges\n7. Subgraph with e1 and e3: 1 connected component, 2 edges\n8. Subgraph with e1 and e4: 2 connected components, 2 edges\n9. Subgraph with e2 and e3: 2 connected components, 2 edges\n10. Subgraph with e2 and e4: 1 connected component, 2 edges\n11. Subgraph with e3 and e4: 1 connected component, 2 edges\n12. Subgraph with e1, e2, and e3: 1 connected component, 3 edges\n13. Subgraph with e1, e2, and e4: 1 connected component, 3 edges\n14. Subgraph with e1, e3, and e4: 1 connected component, 3 edges\n15. Subgraph with e2, e3, and e4: 1 connected component, 3 edges\n16. Subgraph with all edges: 1 connected component, 4 edges\n\nNow, we can compute the Tutte polynomial using the formula:\n\nT(x, y) = ∑(r, k) A(r, k) x^(r - k) y^(k - c)\n\nHere, c = 1 (since the original graph is connected). We have:\n\nT(x, y) = x^0 y^0 + 4x^1 y^1 + 6x^0 y^2 + 5x^(-1) y^3 + x^(-2) y^4\nT(x, y) = 1 + 4xy + 6y^2 + 5y^3/x + y^4/x^2\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is:\n\nT(x, y) = 1 + 4xy + 6y^2 + 5y^3/x + y^4/x^2"
