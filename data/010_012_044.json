    "message_2": "To find the local maxima and minima, we need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf(x) = x^3 - 2x + 1\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 2\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 2 = 0\nx^2 = 2/3\nx = ±√(2/3)\n\nSince the interval is [-1, 1], both critical points are within the interval. Now, we need to determine if these points correspond to local maxima or minima. We do this by analyzing the second derivative.\n\nf''(x) = 6x\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n\nf''(√(2/3)) = 6(√(2/3)) > 0, so x = √(2/3) is a local minimum.\nf''(-√(2/3)) = -6(√(2/3)) < 0, so x = -√(2/3) is a local maximum.\n\nTo find the inflection points, we set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nf''(x) = 6x = 0\nx = 0\n\nNow, we check the concavity of the function to the left and right of x = 0:\n\nf''(x) > 0 for x > 0, so the function is concave up to the right of x = 0.\nf''(x) < 0 for x < 0, so the function is concave down to the left of x = 0.\n\nSince the concavity changes at x = 0, there is an inflection point at x = 0.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Local maximum: x = -√(2/3)\n- Local minimum: x = √(2/3)\n- Inflection point: x = 0\n\nTo sketch the graph, plot the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 1 and mark the local maximum at x = -√(2/3), the local minimum at x = √(2/3), and the inflection point at x = 0. The graph will show a cubic function with a local maximum to the left, a local minimum to the right, and an inflection point at the origin."
