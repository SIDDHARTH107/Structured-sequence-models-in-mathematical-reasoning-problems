    "message_2": "To find the wavelength and period of the wave, we first need to find the angular frequency $\\omega$ and the wave number $k$. The given wave function is $u(x,t) = 2x^2\\cos(ct)$. This is not in the standard form of a wave function, which is usually given as:\n\n$$u(x,t) = A\\cos(kx - \\omega t + \\phi)$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude, $k$ is the wave number, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\\phi$ is the phase angle. \n\nSince the given wave function is not in the standard form, we cannot directly find the wavelength and period from it. However, we can still find the wave speed, which is given as $c = 6$.\n\nNow, let's try to rewrite the given wave function in the standard form. We can do this by applying a change of variables. Let $y = x^2$, then $u(y,t) = 2y\\cos(ct)$. Now the wave function is in the standard form with $A = 2y$, $k = 1$, $\\omega = c$, and $\\phi = 0$. \n\nThe wavelength $\\lambda$ is related to the wave number $k$ by the formula:\n\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{k}$$\n\nSince $k = 1$, the wavelength is:\n\n$$\\lambda = 2\\pi$$\n\nThe period $T$ is related to the angular frequency $\\omega$ by the formula:\n\n$$T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$$\n\nSince $\\omega = c = 6$, the period is:\n\n$$T = \\frac{2\\pi}{6} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$$\n\nSo, the wavelength of the wave is $2\\pi$, the period is $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$, and the wave speed is $6$."
