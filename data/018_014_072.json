    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}. Find the following sets:\n1. (A x B)’\n2. A’ x B’\n3. (A’ x B’) U (A x B)’\n4. Is (A x B)’ distributive over complement?",
    "message_2": "1. (A x B)' \nTo find the complement of A x B, we first need to find A x B. A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, we need to find the complement of A x B. The complement of a set is the set of all elements that are not in the set. However, to find the complement, we need to know the universal set. Since the universal set is not given, we cannot find the complement (A x B)'.\n\n2. A' x B'\nSimilar to the previous case, we need to know the universal set to find the complements of A and B. Without the universal set, we cannot find A' x B'.\n\n3. (A’ x B’) U (A x B)’\nAs mentioned earlier, we cannot find the complements without the universal set. Therefore, we cannot find (A’ x B’) U (A x B)’.\n\n4. Is (A x B)’ distributive over complement?\nThe distributive property states that for any sets A, B, and C, A ∩ (B U C) = (A ∩ B) U (A ∩ C) and A U (B ∩ C) = (A U B) ∩ (A U C). However, this question seems to be asking about the distributive property over the complement operation, which is not a standard property in set theory. Therefore, the question is not clear, and we cannot determine if (A x B)' is distributive over complement."
