    "message_2": "Twin primes are pairs of primes that differ by 2. To find the smallest twin primes with a difference of 10 or more between the pairs, we can start by listing the first few twin prime pairs:\n\n(3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31), (41, 43), ...\n\nNow, we look for the smallest difference of 10 or more between consecutive twin prime pairs:\n\n(11, 13) and (29, 31) have a difference of 18 between the first numbers of each pair (29 - 11 = 18).\n\nSo, the two smallest twin primes that differ by at least 10 are (11, 13) and (29, 31)."
