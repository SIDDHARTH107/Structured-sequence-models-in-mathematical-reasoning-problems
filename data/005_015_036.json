They have collected data on the number of items purchased and the total amount spent by each customer in the last month. Using k-means clustering with k=3, determine the clusters into which the customers can be grouped based on the following data:\n\nCustomer 1: Purchased 8 items and spent $136.50\nCustomer 2: Purchased 10 items and spent $175.25\nCustomer 3: Purchased 3 items and spent $47.80\nCustomer 4: Purchased 6 items and spent $97.30\nCustomer 5: Purchased 12 items and spent $212.80\nCustomer 6: Purchased 4 items and spent $56.90\nCustomer 7: Purchased 9 items and spent $132.40\nCustomer 8: Purchased 7 items and spent $108.20\nCustomer 9: Purchased 11 items and spent $185.70\nCustomer 10: Purchased 5 items and spent $79.10",
    "message_2": "To perform k-means clustering, we first need to choose initial centroids for the clusters. Since k=3, we will have 3 centroids. We can choose the first 3 customers as the initial centroids:\n\nCentroid 1: (8, 136.50)\nCentroid 2: (10, 175.25)\nCentroid 3: (3, 47.80)\n\nNow, we will calculate the Euclidean distance between each customer and the centroids, and assign each customer to the nearest centroid.\n\nDistances:\nCustomer 1: C1=0, C2=39.25, C3=88.70 -> Cluster 1\nCustomer 2: C1=38.75, C2=0, C3=127.45 -> Cluster 2\nCustomer 3: C1=88.70, C2=127.45, C3=0 -> Cluster 3\nCustomer 4: C1=39.20, C2=77.95, C3=49.50 -> Cluster 1\nCustomer 5: C1=76.30, C2=37.55, C3=165.00 -> Cluster 2\nCustomer 6: C1=79.60, C2=118.35, C3=9.10 -> Cluster 3\nCustomer 7: C1=4.10, C2=42.85, C3=84.60 -> Cluster 1\nCustomer 8: C1=28.30, C2=67.05, C3=60.40 -> Cluster 1\nCustomer 9: C1=49.20, C2=10.45, C3=137.90 -> Cluster 2\nCustomer 10: C1=57.40, C2=96.15, C3=31.20 -> Cluster 3\n\nNow we have the initial clusters:\nCluster 1: Customers 1, 4, 7, 8\nCluster 2: Customers 2, 5, 9\nCluster 3: Customers 3, 6, 10\n\nNext, we need to update the centroids by calculating the mean of each cluster:\n\nNew Centroid 1: ((8+6+9+7)/4, (136.50+97.30+132.40+108.20)/4) = (7.5, 118.60)\nNew Centroid 2: ((10+12+11)/3, (175.25+212.80+185.70)/3) = (11, 191.25)\nNew Centroid 3: ((3+4+5)/3, (47.80+56.90+79.10)/3) = (4, 61.27)\n\nNow we repeat the process of assigning customers to the nearest centroid and updating the centroids until there are no changes in the clusters.\n\nAfter repeating the process, the clusters remain the same, and the final centroids are:\n\nCentroid 1: (7.5, 118.60)\nCentroid 2: (11, 191.25)\nCentroid 3: (4, 61.27)\n\nSo, the final clusters are:\n\nCluster 1: Customers 1, 4, 7, 8\nCluster 2: Customers 2, 5, 9\nCluster 3: Customers 3, 6, 10"
