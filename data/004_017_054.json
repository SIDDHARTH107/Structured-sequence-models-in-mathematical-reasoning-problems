    "message_2": "To find the length of the wire, we need to calculate the arc length of the curve y = x^2/4 between x = 0 and x = 4. We can use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x):\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2/4:\n\nf'(x) = d(x^2/4)/dx = (1/2)x\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + ((1/2)x)^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + (x^2/4)) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let u = x^2/4, then du/dx = x/2, and dx = 2du/x. The new limits of integration are u(0) = 0 and u(4) = 4^2/4 = 4.\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + u) * (2du/x)\n\nSince x = 2sqrt(u), we can substitute it back:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + u) * (2du/(2sqrt(u))) = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + u) * (du/sqrt(u))\n\nNow, we can simplify the integrand:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] (u^(1/2) * u^(-1/2)) du = ∫[0, 4] u^(1/2 - 1/2) du = ∫[0, 4] u^0 du\n\nSince u^0 = 1 for all u:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] 1 du\n\nNow, we can easily integrate:\n\nL = [u] from 0 to 4 = 4 - 0 = 4\n\nSo, the length of the wire is 4 units."
