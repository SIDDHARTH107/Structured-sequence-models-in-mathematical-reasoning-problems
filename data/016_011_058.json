    "message_2": "A Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that is constructed by successively replacing each square with a cross-like pattern of five smaller squares. The perimeter of the Vicsek fractal increases with each iteration (order) of the fractal.\n\nLet's denote the total perimeter of the Vicsek fractal at order n as P(n). At order 0, there is only one square, so the perimeter is P(0) = 4 units.\n\nFor each subsequent order, the perimeter increases by a factor of 3. This is because each square is replaced by a cross-like pattern of five smaller squares, and the perimeter of this cross-like pattern is 3 times the perimeter of the original square.\n\nSo, the total perimeter of the Vicsek fractal at order n can be calculated as:\n\nP(n) = 4 * 3^n\n\nFor a Vicsek fractal of order 4, the total perimeter is:\n\nP(4) = 4 * 3^4 = 4 * 81 = 324 units."
