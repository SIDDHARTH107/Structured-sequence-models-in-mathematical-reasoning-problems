    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (3 * √3 * s^2) / 2\n\nwhere s is the side length of the hexagon.\n\nIn this case, s = 7 cm. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (3 * √3 * 7^2) / 2\nArea = (3 * √3 * 49) / 2\nArea = (147 * √3) / 2\nArea ≈ 127.28 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the regular hexagon with a side length of 7 cm is approximately 127.28 cm²."
