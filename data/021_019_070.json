    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) optimization algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. In this algorithm, each musician (variable) plays a note (value) to find the best harmony (solution). To find the minimum value of the given function f(x) = 5x^4 - 9x^3 - 12x^2 + 4x + 6, we will follow the steps of the HS algorithm.\n\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n- Harmony Memory Size (HMS): The number of solutions in the harmony memory (e.g., 10)\n- Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR): The probability of selecting a value from the harmony memory (e.g., 0.8)\n- Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR): The probability of adjusting a selected value (e.g., 0.3)\n- Number of iterations (NI): The maximum number of iterations (e.g., 1000)\n- Search space: Define the range of x (e.g., -10 to 10)\n\nStep 2: Initialize the harmony memory\nGenerate HMS random solutions within the search space and store them in the harmony memory.\n\nStep 3: Improvise a new harmony\nFor each variable (in this case, x), generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the random number is less than HMCR, select a value from the harmony memory for that variable. If the random number is greater than HMCR, generate a new random value within the search space.\n\nStep 4: Pitch adjustment\nFor each variable, generate another random number between 0 and 1. If the random number is less than PAR, adjust the value of that variable by adding or subtracting a small random number (e.g., 0.01).\n\nStep 5: Update the harmony memory\nEvaluate the new harmony (solution) using the given function. If the new harmony is better than the worst harmony in the harmony memory, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony.\n\nStep 6: Check the stopping criterion\nIf the number of iterations reaches NI, stop the algorithm and return the best harmony (solution) in the harmony memory. Otherwise, go back to Step 3.\n\nAfter running the HS algorithm with the given parameters, we will obtain the minimum value of the function f(x) = 5x^4 - 9x^3 - 12x^2 + 4x + 6. Note that the result may vary depending on the parameter settings and the random nature of the algorithm."
