    "message_1": "A mountain range contains 8 peaks, where no three peaks are in a straight line. In how many ways can a mountaineer climb the mountain range by starting at the first peak and ending at the last peak, with the restriction that each ascent must be followed by a descent, except for the final descent from the last peak?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the peaks as P1, P2, P3, ..., P8. The mountaineer starts at P1 and ends at P8. Since each ascent must be followed by a descent, the mountaineer must visit an even number of peaks between P1 and P8. There are 6 peaks between P1 and P8, so the mountaineer can visit 0, 2, 4, or 6 peaks between P1 and P8.\n\nCase 1: The mountaineer visits 0 peaks between P1 and P8.\nThere is only 1 way to do this: P1 -> P8.\n\nCase 2: The mountaineer visits 2 peaks between P1 and P8.\nThere are 6 peaks between P1 and P8, and the mountaineer must visit 2 of them. There are 6 choose 2 = 15 ways to choose which 2 peaks to visit. For each choice, there is only 1 way to visit the peaks: P1 -> ascent -> descent -> P8. So there are 15 ways in this case.\n\nCase 3: The mountaineer visits 4 peaks between P1 and P8.\nThere are 6 peaks between P1 and P8, and the mountaineer must visit 4 of them. There are 6 choose 4 = 15 ways to choose which 4 peaks to visit. For each choice, there are 2 ways to visit the peaks: P1 -> ascent -> descent -> ascent -> descent -> P8, or P1 -> ascent -> ascent -> descent -> descent -> P8. So there are 15 * 2 = 30 ways in this case.\n\nCase 4: The mountaineer visits 6 peaks between P1 and P8.\nThere is only 1 way to do this: P1 -> ascent -> ascent -> ascent -> descent -> descent -> descent -> P8.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 15 + 30 + 1 = 47 ways for the mountaineer to climb the mountain range."
