    "message_1": "A plane is moving at a velocity of 450 km/h towards the east. If the wind is blowing at a velocity of 200 km/h towards the north, determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant vector of the plane's velocity and the wind's velocity. Round the magnitude to two decimal places and express the direction in degrees measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the resultant vector, we can use the Pythagorean theorem since the plane's velocity and the wind's velocity are perpendicular to each other.\n\nMagnitude = √(Plane's velocity² + Wind's velocity²)\nMagnitude = √(450² + 200²)\nMagnitude = √(202500 + 40000)\nMagnitude = √(242500)\nMagnitude ≈ 492.37 km/h (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, to find the direction, we can use the tangent function to find the angle between the resultant vector and the positive x-axis (east direction).\n\ntan(θ) = (Wind's velocity) / (Plane's velocity)\ntan(θ) = 200 / 450\nθ = arctan(200 / 450)\nθ ≈ 24.23° (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the magnitude of the resultant vector is 492.37 km/h, and the direction is 24.23° measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis (east direction)."
