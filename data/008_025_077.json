    "message_2": "To determine if the given system of linear equations has no solutions, we can first check if the equations are parallel by comparing their slopes. If the slopes are equal and the y-intercepts are different, then the lines are parallel and have no solutions.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite both equations in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n\nEquation 1: 2x + 3y = 7\nDivide both sides by 3:\ny = (-2/3)x + 7/3\n\nEquation 2: 4x + 6y = 14\nDivide both sides by 6:\ny = (-2/3)x + 7/3\n\nAs we can see, both equations have the same slope (-2/3) and the same y-intercept (7/3). This means that the lines are not parallel, but rather they are the same line, which means they have infinitely many solutions, not no solutions."
