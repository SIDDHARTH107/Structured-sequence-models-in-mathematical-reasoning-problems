    "message_1": "A math student needs to find a number which leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 and a remainder of 3 when divided by 7. What is the smallest positive integer that satisfies these conditions using the Chinese remainder theorem?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we can set up the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nFirst, we need to find the modular inverses. Let's denote the modular inverse of 5 (mod 7) as M1 and the modular inverse of 7 (mod 5) as M2.\n\nM1 * 5 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\nM2 * 7 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nBy trying different values, we find that M1 = 3 and M2 = 3.\n\nNow, we can use the Chinese remainder theorem formula:\n\nx = (2 * M1 * 7) + (3 * M2 * 5) (mod 35)\n\nx = (2 * 3 * 7) + (3 * 3 * 5) (mod 35)\nx = 42 + 45 (mod 35)\nx = 87 (mod 35)\n\nThe smallest positive integer that satisfies these conditions is x = 87 % 35 = 17."
