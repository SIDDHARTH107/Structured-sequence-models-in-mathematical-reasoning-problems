    "message_2": "There are five distinct isomorphism classes for groups of order 8. We can list them as follows:\n\n1. C8: The cyclic group of order 8.\n2. C4 x C2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n3. D4: The dihedral group of order 8 (symmetries of a square).\n4. Q8: The quaternion group of order 8.\n5. Z2 x Z2 x Z2: The direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2.\n\nNow, let's show that every group of order 8 belongs to one of these classes:\n\nLet G be a group of order 8. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups in G must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, there must be either 1 or 4 such subgroups. If there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal and have order 8, so G is cyclic and isomorphic to C8.\n\nIf there are four 2-Sylow subgroups, let P be one of them. Since the order of P is 8, it must have an element of order 4, say x. Now, let y be an element of G not in P. Since the order of y must divide 8, the order of y is either 2 or 4. If the order of y is 4, then G is generated by x and y, and G is isomorphic to D4. If the order of y is 2, then G is generated by x, y, and xy, and G is either isomorphic to C4 x C2, Q8, or Z2 x Z2 x Z2.\n\nNow, let's determine to which class each of the given groups belongs:\n\n1. C8 belongs to the first class, as it is the cyclic group of order 8.\n2. Q8 belongs to the fourth class, as it is the quaternion group of order 8.\n3. D4 belongs to the third class, as it is the dihedral group of order 8.\n4. G, where G is a non-abelian group of order 8, must belong to either the third class (D4) or the fourth class (Q8). Since D4 and Q8 are both non-abelian, G could be isomorphic to either of them. Without more information about G, we cannot determine which class it belongs to."
