    "message_2": "To find the non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we first need to find the possible ways to factorize 40. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5^1. Now, we will use the Sylow theorems to find the possible Sylow subgroups and their structures.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. One 2-Sylow subgroup of order 8 (2^3).\n2. Five 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8 (2^3).\n\nFor the 5-Sylow subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. One 5-Sylow subgroup of order 5 (5^1).\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible combinations of these Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. One 2-Sylow subgroup of order 8 and one 5-Sylow subgroup of order 5:\n   In this case, the group is a direct product of the two Sylow subgroups, since their orders are coprime. There are 5 groups of order 8 (4 abelian and 1 non-abelian) and 1 group of order 5 (abelian). So, we have 5 possible groups in this case.\n\n2. Five 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8 and one 5-Sylow subgroup of order 5:\n   In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of the two Sylow subgroups. There are 5 groups of order 8 (4 abelian and 1 non-abelian) and 1 group of order 5 (abelian). However, since the 5-Sylow subgroup is unique, it is normal, and the semi-direct product becomes a direct product. So, this case does not give us any new groups.\n\nIn total, we have 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 40. They are:\n\n1. C_40 (cyclic group of order 40)\n2. C_8 × C_5 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 8 and 5)\n3. C_4 × C_2 × C_5 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 4, 2, and 5)\n4. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_5 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 2, 2, 2, and 5)\n5. D_8 × C_5 (direct product of dihedral group of order 8 and cyclic group of order 5)"
