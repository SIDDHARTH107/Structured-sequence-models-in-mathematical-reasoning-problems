    "message_1": "A syrup manufacturer claims that their syrup bottles contain exactly 500 ml of syrup. A sample of 25 bottles is randomly selected and their contents are measured. The mean amount of syrup is found to be 498 ml with a standard deviation of 4 ml. Does this sample provide enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim at 5% significance level?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean is equal to 500 ml, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean is not equal to 500 ml.\n\nH0: μ = 500 ml\nH1: μ ≠ 500 ml\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- Sample size (n) = 25\n- Sample mean (x̄) = 498 ml\n- Sample standard deviation (s) = 4 ml\n- Significance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nt = (498 - 500) / (4 / √25)\nt = (-2) / (4 / 5)\nt = -2 / 0.8\nt = -2.5\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24) and a significance level of 0.05. We can look this up in a t-distribution table or use a calculator:\n\nt_critical = ± 2.064\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-2.5) is less than the negative critical t-value (-2.064), we are in the rejection region.\n\nTherefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is enough evidence to reject the manufacturer's claim that the syrup bottles contain exactly 500 ml of syrup at a 5% significance level."
