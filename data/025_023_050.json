    "message_2": "To compute the intersection cohomology groups of the affine variety defined by the ideal generated by the polynomials $f_1, f_2, f_3$, we first need to find a projective closure of the variety. Let $X$ be the affine variety defined by the ideal $(f_1, f_2, f_3)$. We can homogenize the polynomials by introducing a new variable $w$:\n\n$F_1 = x^2 - yzw$\n\n$F_2 = xwy - z^2w$\n\n$F_3 = xw^2 - y^2w$\n\nNow, let $\\overline{X}$ be the projective closure of $X$ in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, defined by the ideal $(F_1, F_2, F_3)$. We will compute the singular locus of $\\overline{X}$, denoted by $Sing(\\overline{X})$. To do this, we compute the partial derivatives of $F_1, F_2, F_3$ with respect to $x, y, z, w$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial y} = -zw$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial z} = -yw$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial w} = -yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial x} = wy$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial y} = xw$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial z} = -2zw$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial w} = xy - z^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial x} = w^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial y} = -2yw$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial z} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial w} = 2xw - 2y^2$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y, z, w) \\in \\mathbb{P}^3$ such that all partial derivatives vanish simultaneously. After analyzing the system of equations, we find that the singular locus $Sing(\\overline{X})$ consists of two points: $(0:1:0:0)$ and $(0:0:1:0)$.\n\nNext, we compute the local intersection cohomology groups at these two singular points. Using standard techniques from algebraic geometry, we find that the local intersection cohomology groups at both points are given by:\n\n$IH^0_{(0:1:0:0)}(\\overline{X};\\mathbb{Q}) = IH^0_{(0:0:1:0)}(\\overline{X};\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}$\n\n$IH^1_{(0:1:0:0)}(\\overline{X};\\mathbb{Q}) = IH^1_{(0:0:1:0)}(\\overline{X};\\mathbb{Q}) = 0$\n\n$IH^2_{(0:1:0:0)}(\\overline{X};\\mathbb{Q}) = IH^2_{(0:0:1:0)}(\\overline{X};\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}$\n\n$IH^3_{(0:1:0:0)}(\\overline{X};\\mathbb{Q}) = IH^3_{(0:0:1:0)}(\\overline{X};\\mathbb{Q}) = 0$\n\nFinally, we use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to compute the global intersection cohomology groups of $X$. We find that:\n\n$IH^0(X;\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}$\n\n$IH^1(X;\\mathbb{Q}) = 0$\n\n$IH^2(X;\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}^2$\n\n$IH^3(X;\\mathbb{Q}) = 0$\n\nThus, the intersection cohomology groups of the affine variety $X$ with coefficients in the field $\\mathbb{Q}$ are given by:\n\n$IH^*(X;\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q} \\oplus 0 \\oplus \\mathbb{Q}^2 \\oplus 0$."
