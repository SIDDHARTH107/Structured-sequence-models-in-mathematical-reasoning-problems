    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, player 1 proposes to split a $100 reward with player 2. Player 2 can either accept the offer or reject it. If player 2 accepts, both players receive their respective shares of the reward. If player 2 rejects, neither player gets anything. If player 2 has a minimum acceptance threshold of $30, what is the minimum amount that player 1 should offer to ensure a positive payoff for both players?",
    "message_2": "In this situation, player 1 should offer player 2 a minimum of $30 to ensure a positive payoff for both players. This is because player 2 has a minimum acceptance threshold of $30, meaning they will reject any offer below that amount. By offering $30, player 1 ensures that player 2 will accept the offer, and both players will receive a positive payoff. Player 1 will then receive the remaining $70 ($100 - $30)."
