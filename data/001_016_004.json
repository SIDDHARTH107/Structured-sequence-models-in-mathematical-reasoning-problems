In this case, the base is 2. \n\n$8^3 \\cdot 2^5 \\div 4^2 = (2^3)^3 \\cdot 2^5 \\div (2^2)^2$\n\nNow, we apply the power of a power rule, which states that $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$:\n\n$(2^3)^3 \\cdot 2^5 \\div (2^2)^2 = 2^{3 \\cdot 3} \\cdot 2^5 \\div 2^{2 \\cdot 2}$\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n$2^9 \\cdot 2^5 \\div 2^4$\n\nNow, we apply the product of powers rule, which states that $a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$:\n\n$2^{9+5} \\div 2^4 = 2^{14} \\div 2^4$\n\nFinally, we apply the quotient of powers rule, which states that $\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$:\n\n$2^{14-4} = 2^{10}$\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n$2^{10}$"
