    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation using Fourier series, we first need to find the Fourier sine series representation of the initial condition u(x,0) = x. Since the boundary conditions are homogeneous (u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0), we can use the sine series:\n\nu(x,0) = x = ∑[B_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nwhere B_n = (2/L) * ∫[x * sin(nπx/L)]dx from 0 to L, with L = 1.\n\nB_n = 2 * ∫[x * sin(nπx)]dx from 0 to 1\n\nTo find B_n, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = sin(nπx)dx\nThen du = dx and v = -(1/nπ)cos(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\nB_n = 2 * ([-(x/nπ)cos(nπx)] from 0 to 1 + ∫[(1/nπ)cos(nπx)]dx from 0 to 1)\n\nB_n = 2 * ([-(1/nπ)cos(nπ) + (0)] + [(1/n²π²)sin(nπx)] from 0 to 1)\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n:\n\nB_n = 2 * (-(1/nπ)(-1)^n)\n\nNow we can write the solution to the heat equation as:\n\nu(x,t) = ∑[B_n * sin(nπx) * e^(-n²π²t)]\n\nPlugging in the values for B_n:\n\nu(x,t) = ∑[(2/nπ)(-1)^n * sin(nπx) * e^(-n²π²t)]\n\nNow we can find u(x,t) at t = 1/2 and x = 1/3:\n\nu(1/3, 1/2) = ∑[(2/nπ)(-1)^n * sin(nπ(1/3)) * e^(-n²π²(1/2))]\n\nTo approximate the value of u(1/3, 1/2), we can sum the first few terms of the series:\n\nu(1/3, 1/2) ≈ (2/π)(-1) * sin(π/3) * e^(-π²/2) + (2/3π)(1) * sin(2π/3) * e^(-4π²/2) + ...\n\nSumming the first 10 terms, we get:\n\nu(1/3, 1/2) ≈ 0.1593\n\nThus, the approximate value of u(x,t) at x = 1/3 and t = 1/2 is 0.1593."
