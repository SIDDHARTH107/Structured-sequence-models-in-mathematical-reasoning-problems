    "message_2": "In a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the shared secret key can be calculated using the following steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = α^a mod p, where α is the primitive root, a is Alice's secret key, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = α^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret key.\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as S_A = B^a mod p.\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as S_B = A^b mod p.\n\nIf S_A and S_B are equal, then Alice and Bob have the same shared secret key.\n\nLet's calculate the shared secret key using the given values:\n\n1. A = 3^4 mod 17 = 81 mod 17 = 13\n2. B = 3^6 mod 17 = 729 mod 17 = 12\n3. S_A = 12^4 mod 17 = 20736 mod 17 = 10\n4. S_B = 13^6 mod 17 = 4826809 mod 17 = 10\n\nSince S_A and S_B are equal, the shared secret key is 10. Alice and Bob will use this key to encrypt their messages."
