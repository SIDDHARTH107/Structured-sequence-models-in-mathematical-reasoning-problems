    "message_2": "To find the possible number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The order of a group G is 72, which can be factored as 2^3 * 3^2. Thus, we need to find the Sylow subgroups of G.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, by Sylow's Theorem, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^3 = 8, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nNow, we can list the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups and their orders:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1: There is only one 2-Sylow subgroup of order 8 and one 3-Sylow subgroup of order 9. The group is a direct product of these subgroups, and is isomorphic to Z_8 x Z_9, which is abelian.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4: There is only one 2-Sylow subgroup of order 8 and four 3-Sylow subgroups of order 9. The group is a semi-direct product of these subgroups, and is isomorphic to Z_8 x Z_9 ⋊ Z_2, which is non-abelian.\n\n3. n_2 = 9, n_3 = 1: There are nine 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8 and one 3-Sylow subgroup of order 9. The group is a semi-direct product of these subgroups, and is isomorphic to (Z_8 x Z_9) ⋊ Z_3, which is non-abelian.\n\n4. n_2 = 9, n_3 = 4: There are nine 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8 and four 3-Sylow subgroups of order 9. The group is a semi-direct product of these subgroups, and is isomorphic to (Z_8 x Z_9) ⋊ (Z_2 x Z_2), which is non-abelian.\n\nIn total, there are 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 72, and 3 of them are non-abelian.\n\nList of all non-isomorphic groups of order 72:\n\n1. Z_8 x Z_9 (abelian)\n2. Z_8 x Z_9 ⋊ Z_2 (non-abelian)\n3. (Z_8 x Z_9) ⋊ Z_3 (non-abelian)\n4. (Z_8 x Z_9) ⋊ (Z_2 x Z_2) (non-abelian)"
