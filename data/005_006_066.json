    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Central Limit Theorem, we first need to find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean for a sample size of 100.\n\nMean of the sampling distribution (µ_sample) = Mean of the population (µ) = 1200 hours\n\nStandard deviation of the sampling distribution (σ_sample) = Standard deviation of the population (σ) / √(sample size (n))\nσ_sample = 100 hours / √100\nσ_sample = 100 hours / 10\nσ_sample = 10 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range (1100 hours and 1300 hours).\n\nz-score = (x - µ_sample) / σ_sample\n\nz-score for 1100 hours:\nz1 = (1100 - 1200) / 10\nz1 = -100 / 10\nz1 = -10\n\nz-score for 1300 hours:\nz2 = (1300 - 1200) / 10\nz2 = 100 / 10\nz2 = 10\n\nNow, we need to find the probability between these two z-scores using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator.\n\nP(-10 < z < 10)\n\nHowever, the z-scores -10 and 10 are too far from the mean (more than 3 standard deviations away) and are not found in the standard normal distribution table. In practice, we can assume that the probability of a light bulb having a lifespan between 1100 and 1300 hours is almost 100% since the z-scores are so far away from the mean.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected light bulb will have a lifespan between 1100 and 1300 hours is approximately 1 or 100%."
