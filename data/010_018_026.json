    "message_1": "Let $f: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a Morse function with three critical points of index $0$, $1$ and $2$ respectively. Suppose the stable manifold $W^s(x)$ of the index-$1$ critical point contains a closed curve $\\gamma$ such that all critical points of index $\\leq 1$ lie in the interior of the region bounded by $\\gamma$. Calculate the Euler characteristic of the Morse-Smale complex associated to $f$.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Euler characteristic of the Morse-Smale complex associated to $f$, we need to count the number of cells in each dimension and then compute the alternating sum of these counts.\n\nLet $n_i$ denote the number of critical points of index $i$. In this case, we have $n_0 = 1$, $n_1 = 1$, and $n_2 = 1$.\n\nThe Morse-Smale complex has one $0$-cell for each index-$0$ critical point, one $1$-cell for each index-$1$ critical point, and one $2$-cell for each index-$2$ critical point. Therefore, the number of cells in each dimension is as follows:\n\n- $0$-cells: $n_0 = 1$\n- $1$-cells: $n_1 = 1$\n- $2$-cells: $n_2 = 1$\n\nNow, we compute the Euler characteristic as the alternating sum of the number of cells in each dimension:\n\n$\\chi = n_0 - n_1 + n_2 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1$\n\nThus, the Euler characteristic of the Morse-Smale complex associated to $f$ is $1$."
