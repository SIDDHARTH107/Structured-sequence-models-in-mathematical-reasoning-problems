    "message_2": "The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr³, where V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nGiven the radius r = 5 cm, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3)π(5³)\nV = (4/3)π(125)\nV ≈ 523.6 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is approximately 523.6 cm³, correct to one decimal place."
