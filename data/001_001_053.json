    "message_2": "To solve for x in the linear equation 3x + 5 = 11, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation.\n3x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5\n3x = 6\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 3.\n3x / 3 = 6 / 3\nx = 2\n\nSo, the solution for x in the linear equation 3x + 5 = 11 is x = 2."
