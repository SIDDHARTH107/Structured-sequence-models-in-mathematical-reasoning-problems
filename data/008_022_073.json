    "message_2": "1) Solve the system using Gaussian elimination and report the solution.\n\nFirst, we write the augmented matrix for the system of linear equations:\n\n| 1  1  1 | 6 |\n| 2  3  4 |16 |\n| 4  5  6 |22 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows.\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - 4 * Row1\n\n| 1  1   1 |  6 |\n| 0  1   2 |  4 |\n| 0 -1  -2 | -2 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second element in the third row.\n\nRow3 = Row3 + Row2\n\n| 1  1   1 |  6 |\n| 0  1   2 |  4 |\n| 0  0   0 |  2 |\n\nAt this point, we have a contradiction in the third row (0x + 0y + 0z = 2). This means that the system of linear equations has no solution.\n\n2) Calculate the condition number of the coefficient matrix A.\n\nThe condition number of a matrix A is defined as the product of the norm of A and the norm of its inverse (A_inv): cond(A) = ||A|| * ||A_inv||.\n\nHowever, since the system of linear equations has no solution, the matrix A is singular, and its inverse does not exist. Therefore, the condition number is undefined.\n\n3) Discuss the ill-conditioned nature of the system and the implications it has on the accuracy of the solution.\n\nAn ill-conditioned system is one where small changes in the input can lead to large changes in the output. In this case, the system of linear equations has no solution, which indicates that the matrix A is singular. This means that the system is very sensitive to small changes in the coefficients or the right-hand side of the equations.\n\nThe ill-conditioned nature of the system implies that the accuracy of the solution (if it existed) would be highly dependent on the accuracy of the input data. In practice, this means that small errors in the input data could lead to large errors in the solution, making it unreliable for practical purposes."
