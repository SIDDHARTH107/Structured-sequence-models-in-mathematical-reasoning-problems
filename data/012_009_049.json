    "message_2": "Yes, there is a possible degree sequence for a simple undirected graph with 7 vertices such that the degree of each vertex is even.\n\nConsider the following degree sequence: (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2). This means that each of the 7 vertices has a degree of 2, which is an even number.\n\nTo construct a graph with this degree sequence, we can arrange the vertices in a cycle. Label the vertices as V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, and V7. Connect V1 to V2, V2 to V3, V3 to V4, V4 to V5, V5 to V6, V6 to V7, and finally, V7 to V1. This forms a cycle, and each vertex has a degree of 2.\n\nThus, it is possible to have a degree sequence for a simple undirected graph with 7 vertices such that the degree of each vertex is even."
