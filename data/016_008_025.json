    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(L)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces in each iteration, and L is the scaling factor (the length of each piece relative to the original length).\n\nFor the Koch curve, each iteration creates a total of 4 line segments, so N = 4. The initial line segment has a length of 1 unit, and each new segment in the iteration is 1/3 the length of the previous segment, so L = 3.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(4) / log(3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that the Hausdorff dimension is approximately 1.26186.\n\nSo, the exact value of the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is log(4) / log(3)."
