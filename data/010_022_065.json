    "message_1": "A cylindrical glass is filled with water up to a height of 10 cm. Another identical cylindrical glass is poured with water such that the height of the water is 15 cm. If the radius of the glasses is 3 cm, calculate the volume of water poured into the second glass. (Assuming no water was spilled during pouring)",
    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of water poured into the second glass, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = πr²h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 3 cm and the height (h) of the water in the second glass is 15 cm.\n\nSo, the volume of water in the second glass is:\n\nV = π(3 cm)²(15 cm) = π(9 cm²)(15 cm) = 135π cm³\n\nTherefore, the volume of water poured into the second glass is 135π cm³."
