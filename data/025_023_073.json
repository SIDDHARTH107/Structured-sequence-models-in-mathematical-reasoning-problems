    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the intersection cohomology group IH^3(Y, Q), we will use the decomposition theorem and the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for complex projective varieties. Let X be a complex projective variety of dimension n, and let H be a hyperplane section of X. Then the restriction map\n\nH^k(X, Q) → H^k(H, Q)\n\nis an isomorphism for k < n - 1 and injective for k = n - 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the given conditions. Since the intersection of Y with any algebraic hyperplane of X is either empty or all of Y, we know that Y is not contained in any hyperplane of X. Thus, we can apply the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to Y.\n\nLet H_Y be a hyperplane section of Y. Then the restriction map\n\nH^k(Y, Q) → H^k(H_Y, Q)\n\nis an isomorphism for k < 1 and injective for k = 1.\n\nSince Y is a complex algebraic sub-variety of X of dimension 2, we have that H_Y is a complex algebraic sub-variety of dimension 1. Moreover, since there exists a smooth irreducible algebraic curve C in Y such that the cohomology groups H^*(C, Q) are pure of weight 1, we can apply the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to C as well.\n\nLet H_C be a hyperplane section of C. Then the restriction map\n\nH^k(C, Q) → H^k(H_C, Q)\n\nis an isomorphism for k < 0 and injective for k = 0.\n\nNow, we can use the decomposition theorem to compute the intersection cohomology group IH^3(Y, Q). The decomposition theorem states that the intersection cohomology groups of a complex algebraic variety can be computed as the direct sum of the cohomology groups of its strata.\n\nIn our case, the strata of Y are given by the smooth irreducible algebraic curve C and its complement in Y. Since C is a curve, its cohomology groups are concentrated in degrees 0 and 1. Moreover, since H^*(C, Q) are pure of weight 1, we have that\n\nH^0(C, Q) = Q and H^1(C, Q) = Q^r,\n\nwhere r is the rank of the first cohomology group of C.\n\nNow, let's consider the complement of C in Y. Since Y is a complex algebraic variety of dimension 2, its cohomology groups are concentrated in degrees 0, 1, and 2. Moreover, by the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we have that\n\nH^0(Y, Q) = Q, H^1(Y, Q) = Q^s,\n\nwhere s is the rank of the first cohomology group of Y.\n\nFinally, we can compute the intersection cohomology group IH^3(Y, Q) as the direct sum of the cohomology groups of the strata of Y:\n\nIH^3(Y, Q) = H^3(C, Q) ⊕ H^3(Y - C, Q).\n\nSince C is a curve, its third cohomology group is trivial, i.e., H^3(C, Q) = 0. Moreover, since Y is a complex algebraic variety of dimension 2, its third cohomology group is also trivial, i.e., H^3(Y - C, Q) = 0.\n\nThus, we have that\n\nIH^3(Y, Q) = 0 ⊕ 0 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the intersection cohomology group IH^3(Y, Q) of Y is 0."
