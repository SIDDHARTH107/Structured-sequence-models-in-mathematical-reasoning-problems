    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) and C, denoted as (A △ B) x C. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A △ B) x C = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B and C, denoted as B x C.\n\nB x C = {(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and (B x C), denoted as A △ (B x C). Since A is a set of single elements and (B x C) is a set of ordered pairs, their intersection is empty, and their symmetric difference is simply the union of the two sets.\n\nA △ (B x C) = A ∪ (B x C) = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)}\n\nComparing the two results, we have:\n\n(A △ B) x C = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)}\n\nA △ (B x C) = {1, 2, 3, (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)}\n\nClearly, (A △ B) x C ≠ A △ (B x C), which shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product."
