    "message_2": "To find the area of a hyperbolic triangle with vertices A(-1, -1), B(2, -3), and C(-3, -4) on the hyperbolic plane with curvature -1, we first need to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n\nLet's denote the side lengths as follows:\na = length of side BC\nb = length of side AC\nc = length of side AB\n\nWe can use the hyperbolic distance formula to find the lengths of the sides:\nd(P, Q) = arcosh(1 + 2 * ((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) / ((1 - x1^2 - y1^2) * (1 - x2^2 - y2^2)))\n\nUsing the formula, we find the side lengths:\na = d(B, C) = arcosh(1 + 2 * ((-3 - 2)^2 + (-4 + 3)^2) / ((1 - 2^2 - (-3)^2) * (1 - (-3)^2 - (-4)^2))) ≈ 2.298\nb = d(A, C) = arcosh(1 + 2 * ((-3 + 1)^2 + (-4 + 1)^2) / ((1 - (-1)^2 - (-1)^2) * (1 - (-3)^2 - (-4)^2))) ≈ 2.298\nc = d(A, B) = arcosh(1 + 2 * ((2 + 1)^2 + (-3 + 1)^2) / ((1 - (-1)^2 - (-1)^2) * (1 - 2^2 - (-3)^2))) ≈ 2.298\n\nNow, we can use the hyperbolic cosine rule to find the angles of the triangle:\ncosh(c) = cosh(a) * cosh(b) - sinh(a) * sinh(b) * cos(C)\ncos(C) = (cosh(c) - cosh(a) * cosh(b)) / (sinh(a) * sinh(b))\n\nUsing the cosine rule, we find the angle C:\ncos(C) = (cosh(2.298) - cosh(2.298) * cosh(2.298)) / (sinh(2.298) * sinh(2.298)) ≈ -0.5\nC = arccos(-0.5) ≈ 2.094\n\nSince the curvature is -1, the area of the hyperbolic triangle is given by the Lobachevsky formula:\nArea = π - (A + B + C)\n\nSince the triangle is equilateral (all side lengths are equal), the angles A and B are also equal to 2.094. Therefore, the area of the triangle is:\nArea = π - (2.094 + 2.094 + 2.094) ≈ π - 6.282 ≈ 0.141\n\nSo, the area of the hyperbolic triangle with vertices at (-1, -1), (2, -3), and (-3, -4) on the hyperbolic plane with curvature -1 is approximately 0.141 square units."
