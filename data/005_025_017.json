    "message_1": "Suppose that the weights of oranges at a local store follow a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1.5 ounces. A sample of 50 oranges is drawn, and the average weight is found to be 8.2 ounces. \n\nWhat is the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of all oranges at the store?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of all oranges at the store, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √(Sample Size)\n\nGiven the information provided, we have:\n\nSample Mean = 8.2 ounces\nStandard Deviation = 1.5 ounces\nSample Size = 50\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 1.5 / √(50) ≈ 0.2121\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 0.2121 ≈ 0.4157\n\nFinally, we can find the 95% confidence interval:\n\nLower Bound = 8.2 - 0.4157 ≈ 7.7843 ounces\nUpper Bound = 8.2 + 0.4157 ≈ 8.6157 ounces\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of all oranges at the store is approximately (7.7843, 8.6157) ounces."
