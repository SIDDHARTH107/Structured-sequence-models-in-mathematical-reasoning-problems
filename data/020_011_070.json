    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit made on each unit of product A is $5, and the profit made on each unit of product B is $7. The company has 300 units of raw materials and 180 production hours available per day. The production of each unit of A requires 2 units of raw materials and 3 production hours, while the production of each unit of B requires 1 unit of raw materials and 2 production hours. The company wants to know how many units of A and B should be produced per day in order to maximize the profit while meeting the raw materials and production hours constraints. \n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of product A and product B that the company should produce per day to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function, which is given by:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 7y\n\nThe constraints are given by the raw materials and production hours:\n\n2x + y ≤ 300 (raw materials constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 180 (production hours constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y = 300\ny = 300 - 2x\n\n2. 3x + 2y = 180\ny = (180 - 3x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of the constraints, which forms a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 90), (60, 0), and (30, 60).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 90) = 5(0) + 7(90) = 630\n3. P(60, 0) = 5(60) + 7(0) = 300\n4. P(30, 60) = 5(30) + 7(60) = 150 + 420 = 570\n\nThe maximum profit is $630, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 90 units of product B per day."
