    "message_2": "To find the probability of team A winning at least 4 games, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of games)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of games won)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of team A winning)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of team A winning at least 4 games, so we need to calculate the probability of team A winning 4, 5, or 6 games and then sum those probabilities.\n\nP(X >= 4) = P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6)\n\nFirst, let's calculate P(X = 4):\n\nC(6, 4) = 6! / (4!(6-4)!) = 15\nP(X = 4) = 15 * (0.75)^4 * (1-0.75)^(6-4) = 15 * (0.3164) * (0.0625) = 0.2966\n\nNext, let's calculate P(X = 5):\n\nC(6, 5) = 6! / (5!(6-5)!) = 6\nP(X = 5) = 6 * (0.75)^5 * (1-0.75)^(6-5) = 6 * (0.2373) * (0.25) = 0.3562\n\nFinally, let's calculate P(X = 6):\n\nC(6, 6) = 6! / (6!(6-6)!) = 1\nP(X = 6) = 1 * (0.75)^6 * (1-0.75)^(6-6) = 1 * (0.1779) * (1) = 0.1779\n\nNow, we can sum the probabilities:\n\nP(X >= 4) = P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) = 0.2966 + 0.3562 + 0.1779 = 0.8307\n\nSo, the probability that team A will win at least 4 games is approximately 0.8307 or 83.07%."
