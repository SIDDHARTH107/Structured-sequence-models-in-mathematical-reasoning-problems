    "message_2": "To find the length of the Lévy C curve after the third iteration, we need to understand how the length of the curve changes with each iteration.\n\nIn the first iteration, the initial line segment of length 1 is replaced by two segments of equal length, each at a 45-degree angle to the original segment. Since the angle is 45 degrees, the two new segments form a right-angled isosceles triangle with the original segment as the hypotenuse. In a right-angled isosceles triangle, the ratio of the hypotenuse to each leg is √2:1. So, each new segment has a length of 1/√2, and the total length of the curve after the first iteration is 2 * (1/√2) = √2.\n\nIn the second iteration, each of the two segments from the first iteration is replaced by two segments of equal length, each at a 45-degree angle to the original segment. The length of each new segment is (1/√2) * (1/√2) = 1/2. Since there are four new segments, the total length of the curve after the second iteration is 4 * (1/2) = 2.\n\nIn the third iteration, each of the four segments from the second iteration is replaced by two segments of equal length, each at a 45-degree angle to the original segment. The length of each new segment is (1/2) * (1/√2) = 1/(2√2). Since there are eight new segments, the total length of the curve after the third iteration is 8 * (1/(2√2)) = 4/√2 = 2√2.\n\nSo, the length of the Lévy C curve after the third iteration is 2√2 units."
