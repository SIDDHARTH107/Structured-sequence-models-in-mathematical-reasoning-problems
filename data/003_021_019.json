    "message_2": "Let's denote the plane's velocity as Vp and the wind's velocity as Vw. We want to find the angle θ between the plane's velocity and the direction of the wind.\n\nWe can represent the plane's velocity and the wind's velocity as two vectors:\n\nVp = 500 km/h (north)\nVw = 200 km/h (east)\n\nNow, we can use the dot product formula to find the angle between these two vectors:\n\nVp • Vw = |Vp| * |Vw| * cos(θ)\n\nThe dot product of two orthogonal vectors (north and east) is 0:\n\nVp • Vw = 0\n\nThe magnitudes of the vectors are:\n\n|Vp| = 500 km/h\n|Vw| = 200 km/h\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula:\n\n0 = 500 * 200 * cos(θ)\n\nNow, we can solve for cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = 0 / (500 * 200)\ncos(θ) = 0\n\nSince cos(θ) = 0, the angle θ between the plane's velocity and the direction of the wind is:\n\nθ = arccos(0)\nθ = 90°\n\nSo, the angle between the plane's velocity and the direction of the wind is 90°."
