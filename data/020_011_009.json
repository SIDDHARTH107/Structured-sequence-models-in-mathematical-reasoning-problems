    "message_1": "A company produces two products, Product A and Product B, and wants to maximize their profit. Each unit of Product A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time, while each unit of Product B requires 2 hours of labor and 4 hours of machine time. The company has 600 hours of labor available per week and 400 hours of machine time available per week. The profit per unit of Product A is $150 and the profit per unit of Product B is $200.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit the company can make per week if they allocate their labor and machine time efficiently between Product A and Product B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are as follows:\n\nLabor: 3x + 2y ≤ 600\nMachine time: 2x + 4y ≤ 400\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 150x + 200y.\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraints for y:\n\nFrom the labor constraint: y ≤ (600 - 3x) / 2\nFrom the machine time constraint: y ≤ (400 - 2x) / 4\n\nNow we will find the vertices of the feasible region by setting the inequalities to equalities and solving the system of equations:\n\n1. x = 0, y = (600 - 3x) / 2 => y = 300\n2. x = 0, y = (400 - 2x) / 4 => y = 100\n3. y = 0, x = 600 / 3 => x = 200\n4. Intersection of the two lines: 3x + 2y = 600 and 2x + 4y = 400\n\nTo find the intersection point, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract the second equation:\n\n6x + 4y = 1200\n2x + 4y = 400\n--------------\n4x = 800 => x = 200\n\nNow substitute x back into either equation to find y:\n\n3(200) + 2y = 600\n600 + 2y = 600\n2y = 0 => y = 0\n\nSo, the intersection point is (200, 0).\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of the vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 300) = 150(0) + 200(300) = $60,000\n2. P(0, 100) = 150(0) + 200(100) = $20,000\n3. P(200, 0) = 150(200) + 200(0) = $30,000\n4. P(200, 0) = 150(200) + 200(0) = $30,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $60,000 per week when the company produces 0 units of Product A and 300 units of Product B."
