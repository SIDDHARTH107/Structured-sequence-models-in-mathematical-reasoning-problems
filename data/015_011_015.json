    "message_1": "Given a double pendulum system with the first mass being 0.5 kg, the second mass being 0.2 kg, and the length of both rods being 0.3 m. Assuming initial angular velocities of 1 rad/s and 2 rad/s for the first and second masses respectively, find the maximum angle reached by the second mass during the chaotic motion.",
    "message_2": "The double pendulum system is a highly non-linear and chaotic system, which means that it is very difficult to predict the motion and find an exact analytical solution for the maximum angle reached by the second mass. However, we can use numerical methods to approximate the solution.\n\nWe can use the Lagrangian method to derive the equations of motion for the double pendulum system. Let θ1 and θ2 be the angles of the first and second pendulums, respectively, measured from the vertical. The Lagrangian L is given by the difference between the kinetic energy T and the potential energy V:\n\nL = T - V\n\nThe kinetic energy T can be calculated as:\n\nT = 0.5 * m1 * (l1 * dθ1/dt)^2 + 0.5 * m2 * ((l1 * dθ1/dt)^2 + (l2 * dθ2/dt)^2 + 2 * l1 * l2 * dθ1/dt * dθ2/dt * cos(θ1 - θ2))\n\nThe potential energy V can be calculated as:\n\nV = m1 * g * l1 * (1 - cos(θ1)) + m2 * g * (l1 * (1 - cos(θ1)) + l2 * (1 - cos(θ2)))\n\nNow, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equations to derive the equations of motion:\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dθ1/dt)) - ∂L/∂θ1 = 0\nd/dt(∂L/∂(dθ2/dt)) - ∂L/∂θ2 = 0\n\nThese equations are non-linear and coupled, which makes them difficult to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method to solve them.\n\nGiven the initial conditions (θ1(0) = 0, θ2(0) = 0, dθ1/dt(0) = 1 rad/s, dθ2/dt(0) = 2 rad/s), we can use a numerical solver to find the time evolution of θ1 and θ2. By analyzing the numerical results, we can find the maximum angle reached by the second mass during the chaotic motion.\n\nNote that the maximum angle will depend on the specific numerical method used and the time step chosen, so it is difficult to provide an exact value for the maximum angle. However, using a numerical solver should give a good approximation of the maximum angle reached by the second mass in the double pendulum system."
