    "message_2": "Euler's totient function φ(n) counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nTo compute φ(n), we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor n = 36, we first find the prime factors:\n\n36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n\nNow, we can compute φ(36):\n\nφ(36) = 36 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3)\n     = 36 * (1/2) * (2/3)\n     = 36 * (1/3)\n     = 12\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function φ(36) is 12."
