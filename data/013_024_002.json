    "message_1": "In a group of five volunteers, each volunteer has to decide whether they want to contribute $10 or not towards a charity. The charity will receive $50 only if at least three volunteers contribute, otherwise, the charity receives nothing. What is the probability that the charity will receive a donation of $50?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of having exactly x successes in n trials, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of success in a single trial, and (1-p) is the probability of failure in a single trial.\n\nIn this case, n = 5 (the number of volunteers), p = 0.5 (since each volunteer has a 50% chance of contributing $10), and x will be 3, 4, or 5 (since the charity will receive $50 if at least three volunteers contribute).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of exactly 3 volunteers contributing:\n\nP(3) = C(5, 3) * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^(5-3)\nP(3) = 10 * (0.125) * (0.25)\nP(3) = 0.3125\n\nNext, let's calculate the probability of exactly 4 volunteers contributing:\n\nP(4) = C(5, 4) * (0.5)^4 * (0.5)^(5-4)\nP(4) = 5 * (0.0625) * (0.5)\nP(4) = 0.15625\n\nFinally, let's calculate the probability of all 5 volunteers contributing:\n\nP(5) = C(5, 5) * (0.5)^5 * (0.5)^(5-5)\nP(5) = 1 * (0.03125) * (1)\nP(5) = 0.03125\n\nNow, we can add the probabilities of these three cases to find the probability that the charity will receive a donation of $50:\n\nP(at least 3) = P(3) + P(4) + P(5)\nP(at least 3) = 0.3125 + 0.15625 + 0.03125\nP(at least 3) = 0.5\n\nSo, the probability that the charity will receive a donation of $50 is 0.5 or 50%."
