    "message_1": "A math student is playing a game with their friend. In each round, both players have to choose either \"A\" or \"B\". If both players choose \"B\", they each get 0 points. If one player chooses \"A\" and the other chooses \"B\", the player who chose \"A\" gets 2 points and the other gets 1 point. If both players choose \"A\", they each get 1 point. \n\nIf the math student always chooses \"A\", what is the best strategy for their friend to maximize their points? What is the maximum number of points their friend can get in 10 rounds?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the possible outcomes for each round:\n\n1. If the friend chooses \"A\", the outcome will be (A, A), and both players get 1 point.\n2. If the friend chooses \"B\", the outcome will be (A, B), the math student gets 2 points, and the friend gets 1 point.\n\nSince the math student always chooses \"A\", the friend's best strategy is to always choose \"B\". This way, they will always get 1 point per round, while the math student gets 2 points per round.\n\nIn 10 rounds, the maximum number of points the friend can get is 10 (1 point per round)."
