    "message_1": "A manufacturing plant has 80 employees, and the probability of an employee having an accident in a week is 0.05. What is the probability that at least two employees will have an accident in the workplace during the week?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least two employees having an accident, we can first find the probability of none or only one employee having an accident and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of no employee having an accident:\nP(0 accidents) = (1 - 0.05)^80\n\nNow, let's find the probability of exactly one employee having an accident:\nP(1 accident) = C(80, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (1 - 0.05)^(80-1)\nWhere C(80, 1) is the number of combinations of choosing 1 employee out of 80, which is 80.\n\nP(1 accident) = 80 * (0.05)^1 * (0.95)^79\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least two accidents:\nP(at least 2 accidents) = 1 - P(0 accidents) - P(1 accident)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\nP(0 accidents) ≈ (0.95)^80 ≈ 0.0359\nP(1 accident) ≈ 80 * (0.05) * (0.95)^79 ≈ 0.2843\n\nP(at least 2 accidents) ≈ 1 - 0.0359 - 0.2843 ≈ 0.6798\n\nSo, the probability that at least two employees will have an accident in the workplace during the week is approximately 0.6798 or 67.98%."
