    "message_2": "Consider the group G defined by the following presentation:\n\nG = ⟨a, b | a^7 = b^7 = 1, b^(-1) * a * b = a^2⟩\n\nThis group has order 49 since there are 7 possible values for both a and b, and the relations ensure that no element has order less than 7. Now, let's show that G is not cyclic and not isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7.\n\n1. G is not cyclic:\n\nAssume, for contradiction, that G is cyclic. Then there exists an element g in G such that every element in G can be written as a power of g. Since a and b have order 7, we can write a = g^m and b = g^n for some integers m and n. Then, we have:\n\nb^(-1) * a * b = g^(-n) * g^m * g^n = g^(m-n+n) = g^m = a\n\nBut the relation in G states that b^(-1) * a * b = a^2, so we have a = a^2, which implies a^7 = (a^2)^7 = a^14 = 1. This is a contradiction since a has order 7, so G cannot be cyclic.\n\n2. G is not isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7:\n\nLet H = C_7 × C_7, where C_7 is a cyclic group of order 7. Suppose there exists an isomorphism φ: G → H. Let A = φ(a) and B = φ(b). Since φ is an isomorphism, we have:\n\nφ(b^(-1) * a * b) = φ(a^2)\nφ(b)^(-1) * φ(a) * φ(b) = A^2\n\nNow, A and B are elements of H, so they can be written as A = (x, 0) and B = (0, y) for some x, y in C_7. Then, we have:\n\n(0, -y) * (x, 0) * (0, y) = (x^2, 0)\n\nThis simplifies to (0, y^(-1)) * (x, 0) * (0, y) = (x^2, 0), which gives (x, y^(-1) * y) = (x^2, 0). Thus, we have y^(-1) * y = 1, which implies that the relation b^(-1) * a * b = a^2 is trivial in H. This is a contradiction since this relation is nontrivial in G. Therefore, G is not isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G = ⟨a, b | a^7 = b^7 = 1, b^(-1) * a * b = a^2⟩ is an example of a group of order 49 that is not cyclic and not isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7."
