    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the diameter is 14 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter:\n\nr = 14 cm / 2 = 7 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the radius into the formula and use the given value of π (3.14):\n\nSurface area = 4 * 3.14 * (7 cm)²\nSurface area = 4 * 3.14 * 49 cm²\nSurface area = 12.56 * 49 cm²\nSurface area ≈ 615.44 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 615.44 cm²."
