    "message_1": "Consider the wave equation: \n\n$$\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} - c^2 \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = 0$$ \n\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the displacement of a wave at position $x$ and time $t$, and $c$ is the speed of the wave. Suppose $u(x,t) = Ae^{-(x^2+t^2)}$ is a solution to the wave equation.\n\nWhat is the speed $c$ of the wave?",
    "message_2": "To find the speed $c$ of the wave, we need to plug the given solution $u(x,t) = Ae^{-(x^2+t^2)}$ into the wave equation and solve for $c$. First, let's find the second partial derivatives of $u(x,t)$ with respect to $t$ and $x$.\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -2At e^{-(x^2+t^2)}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = 2A(2t^2 - 1) e^{-(x^2+t^2)}$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = -2Ax e^{-(x^2+t^2)}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 2A(2x^2 - 1) e^{-(x^2+t^2)}$$\n\nNow, plug these second partial derivatives into the wave equation:\n\n$$2A(2t^2 - 1) e^{-(x^2+t^2)} - c^2 2A(2x^2 - 1) e^{-(x^2+t^2)} = 0$$\n\nSince $Ae^{-(x^2+t^2)}$ is nonzero, we can divide both sides by $2Ae^{-(x^2+t^2)}$:\n\n$$(2t^2 - 1) - c^2 (2x^2 - 1) = 0$$\n\nThis equation must hold for all values of $x$ and $t$. Let's consider the case when $x = 0$ and $t = 1$:\n\n$$(2(1)^2 - 1) - c^2 (2(0)^2 - 1) = 1$$\n\nThis gives us $c^2 = 1$, so $c = \\pm 1$. Therefore, the speed of the wave is $c = 1$ or $c = -1$."
