    "message_2": "First, let's find the first derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 11\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative of the function.\n\nf''(x) = d/dx(3x^2 - 12x + 11)\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the second derivative at the point where x = 2.\n\nf''(2) = 6(2) - 12\nf''(2) = 12 - 12\nf''(2) = 0\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 at the point where x = 2 is 0."
