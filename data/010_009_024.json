Then, divide each of those triangles into 4 smaller triangles by connecting their midpoints. What is the total number of triangles in the resulting triangulation?",
    "message_2": "First, let's consider the initial division of the square into 4 triangles. By connecting the midpoints of the edges, we create 4 congruent right triangles. \n\nNow, we will divide each of these 4 triangles into 4 smaller triangles by connecting their midpoints. For each of the 4 larger triangles, this process creates:\n\n1. One smaller triangle in the center (similar to the larger triangle)\n2. Three smaller triangles surrounding the central triangle, each sharing a side with the central triangle\n\nSo, for each of the 4 larger triangles, we create 4 smaller triangles, resulting in a total of 4 x 4 = 16 smaller triangles.\n\nAdding the initial 4 larger triangles, we have a total of 16 + 4 = 20 triangles in the resulting triangulation."
