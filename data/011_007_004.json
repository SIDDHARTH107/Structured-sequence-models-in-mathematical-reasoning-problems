    "message_1": "A computer virus starts with a single infected file. Each hour, every infected file has a 50% chance of infecting one additional file. After 3 hours, how many infected files are there if the virus has infected 4 files in the first hour?\n\nHint: Use a recursive formula to calculate the total number of infected files after each hour.",
    "message_2": "Let's use a recursive formula to calculate the total number of infected files after each hour.\n\nLet I(n) be the number of infected files after n hours.\n\nBase case: I(0) = 1 (initial infected file)\n\nGiven that the virus has infected 4 files in the first hour, we have:\n\nI(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of infected files after 2 hours. Each of the 4 infected files has a 50% chance of infecting one additional file. So, on average, each file will infect 0.5 files. Therefore, the expected number of new infections in the second hour is:\n\nNew infections in the second hour = 4 * 0.5 = 2\n\nSo, the total number of infected files after 2 hours is:\n\nI(2) = I(1) + New infections in the second hour = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of infected files after 3 hours. Each of the 6 infected files has a 50% chance of infecting one additional file. So, on average, each file will infect 0.5 files. Therefore, the expected number of new infections in the third hour is:\n\nNew infections in the third hour = 6 * 0.5 = 3\n\nSo, the total number of infected files after 3 hours is:\n\nI(3) = I(2) + New infections in the third hour = 6 + 3 = 9\n\nAfter 3 hours, there are 9 infected files."
