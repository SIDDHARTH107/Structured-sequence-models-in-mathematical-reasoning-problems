    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each stage, the number of smaller tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nTo find the total number of smaller tetrahedra in the 4th stage, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedra = 4^n\n\nwhere n is the stage number.\n\nFor the 4th stage:\n\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedra = 4^4 = 256\n\nSo, there are 256 smaller tetrahedra in the 4th stage of constructing the Sierpinski tetrahedron."
