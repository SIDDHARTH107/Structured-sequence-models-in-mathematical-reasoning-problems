    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 10 cm. Calculate the length of its diagonal.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nIn this case, the length is 8 cm, the width is 6 cm, and the height is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiagonal length = √(8² + 6² + 10²)\nDiagonal length = √(64 + 36 + 100)\nDiagonal length = √200\n\nNow, we can simplify the square root of 200:\n\n200 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5\n√200 = √(2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5)\n√200 = 2 × 5 × √2\n√200 = 10√2\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is 10√2 cm."
