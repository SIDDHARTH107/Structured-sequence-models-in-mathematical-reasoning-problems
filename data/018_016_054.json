    "message_2": "First, let's find AxB (Cartesian product of A and B). AxB consists of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is from set A and b is from set B. \n\nAxB = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n\nNow, let's find BxA (Cartesian product of B and A). BxA consists of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is from set B and a is from set A.\n\nBxA = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of AxB and BxA. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either of the sets.\n\nUnion of AxB and BxA = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nAs we can see, the union of AxB and BxA contains different ordered pairs. The ordered pairs in AxB have elements from set A in the first position and elements from set B in the second position, while the ordered pairs in BxA have elements from set B in the first position and elements from set A in the second position. Therefore, the union of AxB is not equal to the union of BxA."
