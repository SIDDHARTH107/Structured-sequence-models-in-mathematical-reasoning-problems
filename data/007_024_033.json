    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the equation 5^x ≡ 3 (mod 7), we can use the method of trial and error by calculating powers of 5 modulo 7 until we find the desired result.\n\n1. x = 1: 5^1 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n2. x = 2: 5^2 ≡ 25 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n3. x = 3: 5^3 ≡ 125 ≡ 6 (mod 7)\n4. x = 4: 5^4 ≡ 625 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\n5. x = 5: 5^5 ≡ 3125 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the equation 5^x ≡ 3 (mod 7) is x = 5."
