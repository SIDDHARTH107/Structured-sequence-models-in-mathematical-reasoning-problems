    "message_2": "A singular point of an algebraic variety is a point where the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to each variable simultaneously vanish. In this case, the algebraic variety is defined by the equation $x^3 + y^3 = z^3$. We will find the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^3 + y^3 - z^3) = 3x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^3 + y^3 - z^3) = 3y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x^3 + y^3 - z^3) = -3z^2$\n\nNow, we need to find the points where all three partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n$3x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n\n$3y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\n$-3z^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow z = 0$\n\nThe only point where all three partial derivatives vanish simultaneously is $(0, 0, 0)$. Therefore, the singular point of the algebraic variety defined by the equation $x^3 + y^3 = z^3$ is $(0, 0, 0)$."
