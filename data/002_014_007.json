    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: top, bottom, left, right, front, and back.\n\nThe area of the top and bottom faces can be found by multiplying the length and width:\nArea_top/bottom = 6 cm * 4 cm = 24 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their total area is 2 * 24 cm² = 48 cm².\n\nThe area of the left and right faces can be found by multiplying the height and width:\nArea_left/right = 5 cm * 4 cm = 20 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their total area is 2 * 20 cm² = 40 cm².\n\nThe area of the front and back faces can be found by multiplying the length and height:\nArea_front/back = 6 cm * 5 cm = 30 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their total area is 2 * 30 cm² = 60 cm².\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together:\nSurface area = 48 cm² + 40 cm² + 60 cm² = 148 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 148 cm²."
