    "message_2": "To find the value of f(5) - f(2) + f(7), we need to first find the value of f(x) for each of the given x values (5, 2, and 7) and then perform the operations as indicated.\n\n1. Find f(5):\nf(5) = 2(5) + 3\nf(5) = 10 + 3\nf(5) = 13\n\n2. Find f(2):\nf(2) = 2(2) + 3\nf(2) = 4 + 3\nf(2) = 7\n\n3. Find f(7):\nf(7) = 2(7) + 3\nf(7) = 14 + 3\nf(7) = 17\n\nNow, we can perform the operations as indicated:\n\nf(5) - f(2) + f(7) = 13 - 7 + 17 = 6 + 17 = 23\n\nSo, the value of f(5) - f(2) + f(7) is 23."
