The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative:\n\ny = 2sin(3x)\ndy/dx = d(2sin(3x))/dx\n\nFirst, find the derivative of the outer function (2sin(u)) with respect to u:\n\nd(2sin(u))/du = 2cos(u)\n\nNow, find the derivative of the inner function (3x) with respect to x:\n\nd(3x)/dx = 3\n\nNow, apply the chain rule:\n\ndy/dx = (2cos(3x))(3)\n\nSo, the derivative of y = 2sin(3x) is:\n\ndy/dx = 6cos(3x)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = π/6:\n\ndy/dx = 6cos(3(π/6))\ndy/dx = 6cos(π/2)\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0, the value of the derivative at x = π/6 is:\n\ndy/dx = 6(0) = 0"
