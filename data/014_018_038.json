    "message_1": "In a substitution cipher, a plaintext letter 'e' is replaced with a ciphertext letter 'v'. If the ciphertext message contains 200 letters and exactly 20 of them are letter 'v', how many plaintext letters 'e' were there in the original text message?",
    "message_2": "Since in the substitution cipher, the plaintext letter 'e' is replaced with the ciphertext letter 'v', the number of 'v's in the ciphertext message corresponds to the number of 'e's in the original plaintext message. Therefore, there were 20 plaintext letters 'e' in the original text message."
