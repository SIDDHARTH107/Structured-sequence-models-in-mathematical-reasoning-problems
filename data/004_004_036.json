    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curve of f(x) = x^2 + 2x, the x-axis, and the vertical lines x = -1 and x = 2, we will use definite integration. \n\nFirst, we need to find the definite integral of f(x) with respect to x from -1 to 2:\n\nâˆ«[-1, 2] (x^2 + 2x) dx\n\nWe will now find the antiderivative of f(x):\n\nF(x) = (1/3)x^3 + x^2 + C\n\nNow, we will evaluate F(x) at the limits of integration:\n\nF(2) = (1/3)(2)^3 + (2)^2 = (1/3)(8) + 4 = 8/3 + 4 = 20/3\n\nF(-1) = (1/3)(-1)^3 + (-1)^2 = (1/3)(-1) + 1 = -1/3 + 1 = 2/3\n\nNow, we will subtract F(-1) from F(2) to find the area:\n\nArea = F(2) - F(-1) = 20/3 - 2/3 = 18/3 = 6\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curve of f(x) = x^2 + 2x, the x-axis, and the vertical lines x = -1 and x = 2 is 6 square units."
