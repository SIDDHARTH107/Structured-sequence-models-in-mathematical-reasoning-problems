    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. In this case, the radius is 5 cm.\n\nArea of one circular base = π(5^2) = 25π square cm\n\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is 2 * 25π = 50π square cm.\n\nThe lateral surface area of a cylinder can be found using the formula A = 2πrh, where A is the lateral surface area, r is the radius, and h is the height. In this case, the radius is 5 cm and the height is 10 cm.\n\nLateral surface area = 2π(5)(10) = 100π square cm\n\nNow, to find the total surface area, we add the area of the bases and the lateral surface area:\n\nTotal surface area = 50π + 100π = 150π square cm\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cylinder is 150π square cm or approximately 471.24 square cm."
