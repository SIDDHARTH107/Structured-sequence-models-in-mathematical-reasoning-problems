    "message_1": "In a computer science competition, there are 10 problems that participants must solve. A participant is awarded points based on how many problems they solve correctly. The first problem is worth 1 point, the second is worth 2 points, the third is worth 3 points, and so on. How many points must a participant earn in order to solve at least 6 of the 10 problems?",
    "message_2": "To solve at least 6 of the 10 problems, a participant must solve the first 6 problems. The points for these problems are:\n\n1 point (first problem) + 2 points (second problem) + 3 points (third problem) + 4 points (fourth problem) + 5 points (fifth problem) + 6 points (sixth problem)\n\nAdding these points together, we get:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 points\n\nSo, a participant must earn at least 21 points to solve at least 6 of the 10 problems."
