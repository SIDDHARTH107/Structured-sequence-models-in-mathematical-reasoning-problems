    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of f(t), we need to compute the coefficients a_n and b_n for the series representation:\n\nf(t) = a_0/2 + Σ [a_n * cos(nωt) + b_n * sin(nωt)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π/T, and T = 2π (the period of the function).\n\nSince f(t) is an odd function, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to compute the b_n coefficients for the odd harmonics (n = 1, 3, 5, ...).\n\nThe formulas for the coefficients are:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π to π] f(t) * cos(nωt) dt\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π to π] f(t) * sin(nωt) dt\n\nFor odd harmonics, we compute b_n:\n\nb_1 = (1/π) * ∫[-π to π] f(t) * sin(t) dt\nb_3 = (1/π) * ∫[-π to π] f(t) * sin(3t) dt\n\nWe can split the integrals into two parts, one for -π ≤ t < 0 and one for 0 ≤ t < π:\n\nb_1 = (1/π) * [∫[-π to 0] (-1) * sin(t) dt + ∫[0 to π] (1) * sin(t) dt]\nb_3 = (1/π) * [∫[-π to 0] (-1) * sin(3t) dt + ∫[0 to π] (1) * sin(3t) dt]\n\nIntegrating and evaluating the limits, we get:\n\nb_1 = (1/π) * [(-cos(t))|[-π to 0] + (cos(t))|[0 to π]] = (1/π) * [(-1 - 1) + (1 - (-1))] = 2/π\n\nb_3 = (1/π) * [(-1/3 * cos(3t))|[-π to 0] + (1/3 * cos(3t))|[0 to π]] = (1/π) * [(-1/3 + 1/3) + (1/3 - (-1/3))] = 2/(3π)\n\nNow we can write the Fourier series up to the third odd harmonic:\n\nf(t) = 2/π * sin(t) + 2/(3π) * sin(3t)\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of f(t) up to the third odd harmonic."
