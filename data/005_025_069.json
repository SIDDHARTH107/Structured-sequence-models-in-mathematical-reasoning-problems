    "message_1": "A car manufacturing company claims that the average gas mileage of their new hybrid car is at least 55 miles per gallon. A group of 50 customers who purchased the car were surveyed and the sample mean gas mileage was found to be 52 miles per gallon with a standard deviation of 4 miles per gallon. Can we reject the manufacturer's claim at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. We will set up the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1) as follows:\n\nH0: μ ≥ 55 (The average gas mileage is at least 55 miles per gallon)\nH1: μ < 55 (The average gas mileage is less than 55 miles per gallon)\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 52 miles per gallon\nSample standard deviation (s) = 4 miles per gallon\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is greater than 30, we can use the t-distribution to perform the t-test. First, we need to calculate the t-score:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (52 - 55) / (4 / √50)\nt = -3 / (4 / √50)\nt = -3 / (4 / 7.071)\nt = -3 / 0.5657\nt ≈ -5.31\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.68.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-5.31) is less than the critical t-value (-1.68), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This means that there is significant evidence to suggest that the average gas mileage of the hybrid car is less than 55 miles per gallon at a significance level of 0.05."
