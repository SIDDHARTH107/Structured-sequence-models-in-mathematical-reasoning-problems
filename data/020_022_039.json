    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The production of each product requires resources from two departments, X and Y. Each unit of product A requires 2 units of X and 1 unit of Y, while each unit of product B requires 1 unit of X and 3 units of Y. The company has 500 units of X and 600 units of Y available. If the profit per unit of product A is $8 and the profit per unit of product B is $9, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The constraints for the resources can be written as:\n\n2x + y ≤ 500 (Resource X constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 600 (Resource Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraints)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 8x + 9y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the constraints as:\n\ny ≤ 500 - 2x\ny ≤ (600 - x) / 3\n\nPlotting these constraints along with the non-negativity constraints, we find the feasible region. The vertices of the feasible region are:\n\nA(0, 0)\nB(0, 200)\nC(300, 0)\nD(150, 150)\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\nProfit at A(0, 0) = 8(0) + 9(0) = $0\nProfit at B(0, 200) = 8(0) + 9(200) = $1800\nProfit at C(300, 0) = 8(300) + 9(0) = $2400\nProfit at D(150, 150) = 8(150) + 9(150) = $2550\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point D(150, 150). Therefore, the company should produce 150 units of product A and 150 units of product B to maximize their profit, which will be $2550."
