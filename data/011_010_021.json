    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of ways to climb the staircase with n steps as C_n. We can climb the staircase by either taking one step or two steps at a time. If we take one step, we are left with (n-1) steps, and if we take two steps, we are left with (n-2) steps. So, the number of ways to climb the staircase with n steps can be expressed as the sum of the number of ways to climb the staircase with (n-1) steps and the number of ways to climb the staircase with (n-2) steps:\n\nC_n = C_(n-1) + C_(n-2)\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, and we can solve it using the initial conditions C_0 = 1 and C_1 = 1.\n\nNow, let's express C_n in terms of Catalan numbers. The nth Catalan number is given by the formula:\n\nCat(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n) = (2n)! / ((n+1)! * n!)\n\nWe can rewrite the recurrence relation for C_n as follows:\n\nC_n = C_(n-1) + C_(n-2) = Cat(n-1) + Cat(n-2)\n\nThus, the number of ways to climb the staircase with n steps can be expressed using Catalan numbers as:\n\nC_n = Cat(n-1) + Cat(n-2)"
