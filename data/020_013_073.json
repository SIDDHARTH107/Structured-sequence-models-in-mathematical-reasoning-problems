    "message_1": "A company wants to minimize the cost of producing two products, X and Y. The production process involves two machines, A and B. The company has 300 units of time on machine A and 150 units of time on machine B available for production. The costs of producing one unit of product X on machine A is 5, on machine B it's 4. The costs of producing one unit of product Y on machine A is 4, on machine B it's 5. Each product needs to be produced at least 10 units. How many units of each product should the company produce in order to minimize the total production cost?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced.\n\nThe total cost of production can be represented as:\nC = 5x + 4y (cost on machine A) + 4x + 5y (cost on machine B)\nC = 9x + 9y\n\nThe constraints for the machines' available time are:\n5x + 4y ≤ 300 (machine A)\n4x + 5y ≤ 150 (machine B)\n\nAdditionally, we have the constraints for the minimum production of each product:\nx ≥ 10\ny ≥ 10\n\nTo minimize the total cost, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy these constraints and minimize the cost function C.\n\nFirst, let's solve the constraints for the machines' available time:\n\n5x + 4y = 300 (machine A)\n4x + 5y = 150 (machine B)\n\nWe can solve this system of linear equations using substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method:\n\nMultiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 5 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n20x + 16y = 1200\n20x + 25y = 750\n\nNow subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n9y = -450\ny = -50\n\nSince y cannot be negative, there is no solution to this system of equations that satisfies the constraints for the machines' available time. This means that the company cannot produce both products X and Y at the same time while minimizing the total cost.\n\nHowever, we still need to consider the minimum production constraints. Since the company must produce at least 10 units of each product, we can check the cost when producing 10 units of each product:\n\nC = 9(10) + 9(10) = 90 + 90 = 180\n\nSo, the company should produce 10 units of product X and 10 units of product Y to minimize the total production cost, which will be 180."
