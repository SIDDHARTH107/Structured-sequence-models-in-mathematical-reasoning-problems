    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the lengths of the other two sides. We can use the sine and cosine functions to do this.\n\nLet's call the side opposite the 30-degree angle \"a\" and the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle \"b\".\n\nUsing the sine function:\nsin(30) = a / 10\n\nSince sin(30) = 1/2, we can write:\n1/2 = a / 10\n\nSolving for \"a\", we get:\na = 10 * 1/2 = 5 cm\n\nNow, using the cosine function:\ncos(30) = b / 10\n\nSince cos(30) = √3/2, we can write:\n√3/2 = b / 10\n\nSolving for \"b\", we get:\nb = 10 * √3/2 = 5√3 cm\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all three sides, we can find the perimeter:\nPerimeter = a + b + hypotenuse\nPerimeter = 5 + 5√3 + 10\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is 15 + 5√3 cm."
