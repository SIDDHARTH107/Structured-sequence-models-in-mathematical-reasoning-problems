    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian Product A × B. The Cartesian Product of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference (A × B) △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B but not in their intersection.\n\n(A × B) △ B = (A × B ∪ B) - (A × B ∩ B)\n\nSince B contains only single elements (2, 4) and A × B contains ordered pairs, their intersection is empty:\n\nA × B ∩ B = ∅\n\nSo, the symmetric difference is just the union of A × B and B:\n\n(A × B) △ B = A × B ∪ B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 4), 2, 4}\n\nThus, (A × B) △ B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 4), 2, 4}."
