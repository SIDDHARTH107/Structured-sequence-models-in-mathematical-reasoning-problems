    "message_2": "The power iteration method is an iterative algorithm used to find the dominant eigenvalue and eigenvector of a matrix. The algorithm starts with an initial guess for the eigenvector and iteratively refines the guess until convergence. Here's the algorithm:\n\n1. Choose an initial guess for the eigenvector, v0.\n2. Compute the product Av0.\n3. Normalize the resulting vector.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\n\nLet's apply the power iteration method to the given matrix A and initial guess [1, 1].\n\nMatrix A:\n{{3, 2},\n {2, 5}}\n\nInitial guess (v0):\n[1, 1]\n\nIteration 1:\n1. Compute Av0: A * [1, 1] = [3*1 + 2*1, 2*1 + 5*1] = [5, 7]\n2. Normalize the resulting vector: [5, 7] / ||[5, 7]|| = [5, 7] / sqrt(5^2 + 7^2) = [5, 7] / sqrt(74) = [5/sqrt(74), 7/sqrt(74)]\n\nIteration 2:\n1. Compute A * [5/sqrt(74), 7/sqrt(74)] = [3*(5/sqrt(74)) + 2*(7/sqrt(74)), 2*(5/sqrt(74)) + 5*(7/sqrt(74))] = [31/sqrt(74), 49/sqrt(74)]\n2. Normalize the resulting vector: [31/sqrt(74), 49/sqrt(74)] / ||[31/sqrt(74), 49/sqrt(74)]|| = [31/sqrt(74), 49/sqrt(74)] / sqrt((31/sqrt(74))^2 + (49/sqrt(74))^2) = [31/sqrt(74), 49/sqrt(74)] / sqrt(31^2 + 49^2) = [31/sqrt(3120), 49/sqrt(3120)]\n\nIteration 3:\n1. Compute A * [31/sqrt(3120), 49/sqrt(3120)] = [3*(31/sqrt(3120)) + 2*(49/sqrt(3120)), 2*(31/sqrt(3120)) + 5*(49/sqrt(3120))] = [217/sqrt(3120), 343/sqrt(3120)]\n2. Normalize the resulting vector: [217/sqrt(3120), 343/sqrt(3120)] / ||[217/sqrt(3120), 343/sqrt(3120)]|| = [217/sqrt(3120), 343/sqrt(3120)] / sqrt((217/sqrt(3120))^2 + (343/sqrt(3120))^2) = [217/sqrt(3120), 343/sqrt(3120)] / sqrt(217^2 + 343^2) = [217/sqrt(151240), 343/sqrt(151240)]\n\nAt this point, the eigenvector is converging, and further iterations will yield only minor changes. Thus, we can stop here and round the eigenvector to three decimal places:\n\nEigenvector (approx.): [0.559, 0.829]\n\nNow, let's find the dominant eigenvalue. We can use the Rayleigh quotient, which is defined as:\n\nEigenvalue = (v^T * A * v) / (v^T * v)\n\nUsing the approximated eigenvector [0.559, 0.829]:\n\nEigenvalue = ([0.559, 0.829] * A * [0.559, 0.829]) / ([0.559, 0.829] * [0.559, 0.829]) = ([3.559, 4.829]) / (0.312 + 0.687) = 6.388 / 0.999 = 6.394\n\nRounding to three decimal places:\n\nDominant eigenvalue (approx.): 6.394\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue is approximately 6.394, and the corresponding eigenvector is approximately [0.559, 0.829]."
