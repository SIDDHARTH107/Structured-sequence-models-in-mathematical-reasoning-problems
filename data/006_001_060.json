    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 5 heads and 5 tails in 10 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (coin flips), k is the number of successful outcomes (heads), p is the probability of success (0.5 for a fair coin), q is the probability of failure (1-p, also 0.5 for a fair coin), and nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\").\n\nIn this case, n = 10, k = 5, p = 0.5, and q = 0.5.\n\nFirst, we need to find nCk, which is the number of ways to choose 5 heads out of 10 coin flips:\n\nnCk = C(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * (10-5)!)\n= 10! / (5! * 5!)\n= (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n= 252\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 5) = (252) * (0.5^5) * (0.5^5)\n= 252 * 0.03125 * 0.03125\n= 0.24609375\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 5 heads and 5 tails in 10 coin flips is approximately 24.61%."
