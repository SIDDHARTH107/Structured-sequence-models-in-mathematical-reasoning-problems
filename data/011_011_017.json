Now, let's find the possible values for b and c.\n\n1. If a = 1, then b + c = 9. The possible pairs for (b, c) are (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5). Note that we don't include (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), and (8, 1) because we have already counted them as they are just the reverse of the previous pairs.\n\n2. If a = 2, then b + c = 8. The possible pairs for (b, c) are (2, 6), (3, 5), and (4, 4). We don't include (5, 3) and (6, 2) because they are just the reverse of the previous pairs.\n\n3. If a = 3, then b + c = 7. The possible pairs for (b, c) are (3, 4) and (4, 3). However, since (4, 3) is just the reverse of (3, 4), we only count (3, 4).\n\nThere are no other possibilities for a since a ≥ b ≥ c.\n\nSo, there are a total of 4 + 3 + 1 = 8 ways to partition the number 10 into exactly three positive integers."
