    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^5 - 2x^3 + 7x - 1, we will use the power rule for derivatives. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1), where n is a constant.\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^5)/dx - d(2x^3)/dx + d(7x)/dx - d(1)/dx\n\nFor the first term, 3x^5:\nThe derivative is 5 * 3x^(5-1) = 15x^4.\n\nFor the second term, -2x^3:\nThe derivative is -3 * 2x^(3-1) = -6x^2.\n\nFor the third term, 7x:\nThe derivative is 1 * 7x^(1-1) = 7.\n\nFor the fourth term, -1:\nSince it's a constant, its derivative is 0.\n\nNow, combining the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 15x^4 - 6x^2 + 7\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^5 - 2x^3 + 7x - 1 is f'(x) = 15x^4 - 6x^2 + 7."
