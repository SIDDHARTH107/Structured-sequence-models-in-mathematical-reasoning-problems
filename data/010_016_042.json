Let $\\alpha$ be a closed 1-form on $S$ such that $\\int_{\\gamma} \\alpha = 1$ for some simple closed curve $\\gamma$ on $S$. Determine the value of $\\int_{\\delta} \\alpha$ for some other simple closed curve $\\delta$ on $S$.",
    "message_2": "To determine the value of $\\int_{\\delta} \\alpha$ for some other simple closed curve $\\delta$ on $S$, we need to consider the homology classes of the curves $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$.\n\nRecall that the first homology group of a closed, connected, orientable surface of genus $g$ is given by $H_1(S) = \\mathbb{Z}^{2g}$. In our case, $g = 4$, so $H_1(S) = \\mathbb{Z}^8$. Let's denote the standard basis of $H_1(S)$ by $\\{a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, a_3, b_3, a_4, b_4\\}$, where each $a_i$ and $b_i$ correspond to simple closed curves on $S$.\n\nNow, let's express the homology classes of $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$ in terms of this basis. Suppose that $[\\gamma] = n_1 a_1 + n_2 b_1 + n_3 a_2 + n_4 b_2 + n_5 a_3 + n_6 b_3 + n_7 a_4 + n_8 b_4$ and $[\\delta] = m_1 a_1 + m_2 b_1 + m_3 a_2 + m_4 b_2 + m_5 a_3 + m_6 b_3 + m_7 a_4 + m_8 b_4$, where $n_i, m_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSince $\\alpha$ is a closed 1-form, it defines a cohomology class in $H^1(S)$. By Poincaré duality, there is a unique element $\\beta \\in H_1(S)$ such that $\\int_{\\gamma} \\alpha = \\langle \\alpha, [\\gamma] \\rangle = \\langle [\\beta], [\\gamma] \\rangle$ for all $\\gamma \\in H_1(S)$. In particular, we have $\\int_{\\gamma} \\alpha = \\langle [\\beta], [\\gamma] \\rangle = 1$.\n\nNow, we want to compute $\\int_{\\delta} \\alpha = \\langle [\\beta], [\\delta] \\rangle$. By linearity, this is equal to $\\sum_{i=1}^8 m_i \\langle [\\beta], [a_i] \\rangle + \\sum_{i=1}^8 m_i \\langle [\\beta], [b_i] \\rangle$. Since $\\langle [\\beta], [\\gamma] \\rangle = 1$, we can determine the values of $\\langle [\\beta], [a_i] \\rangle$ and $\\langle [\\beta], [b_i] \\rangle$ for $i = 1, \\ldots, 4$.\n\nFinally, we can compute $\\int_{\\delta} \\alpha = \\sum_{i=1}^4 m_i \\langle [\\beta], [a_i] \\rangle + \\sum_{i=1}^4 m_i \\langle [\\beta], [b_i] \\rangle$. This value depends on the specific choice of the curve $\\delta$ and its homology class in $H_1(S)$. In general, the value of $\\int_{\\delta} \\alpha$ can be any integer, depending on the homology class of $\\delta$ and the cohomology class of $\\alpha$."
