    "message_1": "What is the total number of roots of the polynomial equation $z^{3}-2z^{2}+z+2=0$ lying within the disk $\\left\\{|z| \\leq 2\\right\\}$?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of roots within the disk $\\left\\{|z| \\leq 2\\right\\}$, we can use the argument principle. First, let's rewrite the given polynomial as a function of $z$:\n\n$$f(z) = z^3 - 2z^2 + z + 2$$\n\nNow, consider the contour integral of $\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}$ around the boundary of the disk, i.e., the circle $|z| = 2$. By the argument principle, this integral is equal to $2\\pi i$ times the number of roots of $f(z)$ inside the disk.\n\nThe derivative of $f(z)$ is:\n\n$$f'(z) = 3z^2 - 4z + 1$$\n\nNow, let's parameterize the circle $|z| = 2$ using $z = 2e^{i\\theta}$, where $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$. Then, the contour integral becomes:\n\n$$\\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{f'(2e^{i\\theta})}{f(2e^{i\\theta})} (2ie^{i\\theta}) d\\theta$$\n\nLet's compute $f(2e^{i\\theta})$ and $f'(2e^{i\\theta})$:\n\n$$f(2e^{i\\theta}) = (2e^{i\\theta})^3 - 2(2e^{i\\theta})^2 + 2e^{i\\theta} + 2 = 8e^{3i\\theta} - 8e^{2i\\theta} + 2e^{i\\theta} + 2$$\n\n$$f'(2e^{i\\theta}) = 3(2e^{i\\theta})^2 - 4(2e^{i\\theta}) + 1 = 12e^{2i\\theta} - 8e^{i\\theta} + 1$$\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the integral:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{12e^{2i\\theta} - 8e^{i\\theta} + 1}{8e^{3i\\theta} - 8e^{2i\\theta} + 2e^{i\\theta} + 2} (2ie^{i\\theta}) d\\theta$$\n\nThis integral is not easy to compute directly. However, we can use the residue theorem to find the number of roots inside the disk. The residue theorem states that the integral of a function around a closed contour is equal to $2\\pi i$ times the sum of the residues of the function at its poles inside the contour.\n\nIn this case, the poles of the function $\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}$ are the roots of the polynomial $f(z)$. Let's denote the roots as $z_1, z_2, z_3$. Then, the residues of $\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}$ at these poles are:\n\n$$\\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}, z=z_1\\right) = \\frac{f'(z_1)}{f'(z_1)} = 1$$\n$$\\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}, z=z_2\\right) = \\frac{f'(z_2)}{f'(z_2)} = 1$$\n$$\\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}, z=z_3\\right) = \\frac{f'(z_3)}{f'(z_3)} = 1$$\n\nThus, the integral is equal to $2\\pi i$ times the sum of these residues, which is $2\\pi i(1 + 1 + 1) = 6\\pi i$. Since the integral is equal to $2\\pi i$ times the number of roots inside the disk, we have:\n\n$$6\\pi i = 2\\pi i \\cdot (\\text{number of roots})$$\n\nDividing both sides by $2\\pi i$, we find that the number of roots inside the disk is:\n\n$$\\text{number of roots} = \\frac{6\\pi i}{2\\pi i} = 3$$\n\nTherefore, there are 3 roots of the polynomial equation $z^3 - 2z^2 + z + 2 = 0$ lying within the disk $\\left\\{|z| \\leq 2\\right\\}$."
