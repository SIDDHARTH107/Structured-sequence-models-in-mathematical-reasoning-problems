    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. A minimum vertex cover is a vertex cover with the smallest possible number of vertices.\n\nFor the given graph, one possible minimum vertex cover is {2, 3, 4}. This set of vertices covers all the edges in the graph:\n\n- Edge 1-2 is covered by vertex 2\n- Edge 2-4 is covered by vertex 2 and vertex 4\n- Edge 1-3 is covered by vertex 3\n- Edge 3-5 is covered by vertex 3\n- Edge 3-6 is covered by vertex 3\n- Edge 4-7 is covered by vertex 4\n- Edge 4-8 is covered by vertex 4\n\nNo smaller set of vertices can cover all the edges, so {2, 3, 4} is a minimum vertex cover for the given graph."
