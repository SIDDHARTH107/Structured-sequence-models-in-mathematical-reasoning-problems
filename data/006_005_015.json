    "message_1": "A coffee shop sells an average of 30 cups of coffee per hour. What is the probability that exactly 40 cups are sold in a given hour? (Assuming that the number of cups sold follows a Poisson distribution with lambda = 30).",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of exactly 40 cups being sold in a given hour, we can use the Poisson probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * (λ^k)) / k!\n\nWhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k events occurring\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- λ is the average number of events (in this case, 30 cups of coffee per hour)\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for (in this case, 40 cups of coffee)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 40) = (e^(-30) * (30^40)) / 40!\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values:\n\nP(X = 40) ≈ 0.018132788\n\nSo the probability of exactly 40 cups being sold in a given hour is approximately 1.81%."
