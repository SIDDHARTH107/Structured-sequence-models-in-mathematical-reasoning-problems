    "message_1": "Assume that a principal wants an agent to produce an output that generates a profit of $500. The effort level of the agent can either be low or high. The principal knows that the agent's effort level affects the probability of generating the desired profit. The probability of generating the desired profit given low effort is 0.25, while the probability of generating the desired profit given high effort is 0.75. The agent incurs a disutility cost of $100 for exerting high effort. If the agent exerts low effort, no disutility cost is incurred. If the principal offers the agent a contract with a fixed salary of $200, should the agent exert high effort or low effort?",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the agent should exert high effort or low effort, we need to compare the expected utility of each option.\n\nExpected utility for low effort:\nThe agent receives a fixed salary of $200 and incurs no disutility cost. The probability of generating the desired profit is 0.25, but since the agent's salary is fixed, the probability does not affect the agent's utility. Therefore, the expected utility for low effort is $200.\n\nExpected utility for high effort:\nThe agent receives a fixed salary of $200 and incurs a disutility cost of $100 for exerting high effort. The probability of generating the desired profit is 0.75, but again, since the agent's salary is fixed, the probability does not affect the agent's utility. Therefore, the expected utility for high effort is $200 - $100 = $100.\n\nComparing the expected utilities, the agent should choose low effort, as the expected utility for low effort ($200) is higher than the expected utility for high effort ($100)."
