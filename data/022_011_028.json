    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero. The numerator is given by $(z-1)(z+2)^3$. Setting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n$(z-1)(z+2)^3 = 0$\n\nThis equation has two solutions:\n\n1. $z = 1$: This is a simple zero, as the factor $(z-1)$ has an exponent of 1.\n2. $z = -2$: This is a zero of order 3, as the factor $(z+2)$ has an exponent of 3.\n\nNow, to find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero. The denominator is given by $(z-3)^2$. Setting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n$(z-3)^2 = 0$\n\nThis equation has one solution:\n\n1. $z = 3$: This is a pole of order 2, as the factor $(z-3)$ has an exponent of 2.\n\nIn summary, the function $f(z) = \\frac{(z-1)(z+2)^3}{(z-3)^2}$ has:\n\n1. A simple zero at $z = 1$.\n2. A zero of order 3 at $z = -2$.\n3. A pole of order 2 at $z = 3$."
