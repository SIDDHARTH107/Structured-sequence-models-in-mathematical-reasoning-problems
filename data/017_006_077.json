    "message_2": "To determine whether the group is cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of order p * q, where p and q are distinct prime numbers, is always cyclic. This is because, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup and a Sylow q-subgroup, and their intersection is trivial (i.e., contains only the identity element).\n\n2. A cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups of orders p and q, where n = p * q, and p and q are distinct prime numbers.\n\nIn our case, the group has order 35, which is the product of two distinct prime numbers, 5 and 7. Therefore, by fact 1, the group is cyclic. Moreover, by fact 2, the cyclic group of order 35 is isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nSo, the group is both cyclic and isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
