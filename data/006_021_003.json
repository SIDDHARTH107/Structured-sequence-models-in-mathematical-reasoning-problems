    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (thunderstorms) in n trials (afternoons)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (thunderstorm) on a single trial (afternoon), which is 0.3\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (no thunderstorm) on a single trial (afternoon), which is 0.7\n- n is the number of trials (afternoons in a week), which is 7\n- k is the number of successes (thunderstorms) we want to find the probability for\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having at least 3 thunderstorms in a week, we need to calculate the probabilities for 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 thunderstorms and then sum them up.\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + P(X = 7)\n\nNow, we calculate the probabilities for each value of k:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(7, 3) * 0.3^3 * 0.7^4 ≈ 0.2668\nP(X = 4) = C(7, 4) * 0.3^4 * 0.7^3 ≈ 0.2001\nP(X = 5) = C(7, 5) * 0.3^5 * 0.7^2 ≈ 0.0600\nP(X = 6) = C(7, 6) * 0.3^6 * 0.7^1 ≈ 0.0102\nP(X = 7) = C(7, 7) * 0.3^7 * 0.7^0 ≈ 0.0002\n\nNow, we sum up the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 3) ≈ 0.2668 + 0.2001 + 0.0600 + 0.0102 + 0.0002 ≈ 0.5373\n\nSo, the probability that the region will have thunderstorms on at least 3 afternoons in a given week is approximately 53.73%."
