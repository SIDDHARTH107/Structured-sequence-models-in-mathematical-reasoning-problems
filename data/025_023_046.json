    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the vector space H¹(X, L⊗L^(-2)), we will use the Serre duality theorem. Serre duality states that for a smooth projective curve X of genus g and a line bundle L on X, we have:\n\nH¹(X, L) ≅ H⁰(X, K_X ⊗ L^(-1))^*\n\nwhere K_X is the canonical bundle on X, and * denotes the dual vector space.\n\nIn our case, we have L⊗L^(-2), so we want to compute H¹(X, L⊗L^(-2)). By Serre duality, this is isomorphic to:\n\nH⁰(X, K_X ⊗ (L⊗L^(-2))^(-1))^*\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression inside the H⁰:\n\nK_X ⊗ (L⊗L^(-2))^(-1) = K_X ⊗ L^(-1)⊗L^2\n\nSince X is a curve of genus 3, the canonical bundle K_X is isomorphic to the line bundle of degree 2g-2 = 4. Let's denote this line bundle by M. Then we have:\n\nH⁰(X, M ⊗ L^(-1)⊗L^2) ≅ H¹(X, L⊗L^(-2))^*\n\nNow we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem to compute the dimension of this vector space. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle L on a curve X of genus g:\n\nh⁰(X, L) - h¹(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nIn our case, we have the line bundle M ⊗ L^(-1)⊗L^2, which has degree:\n\ndeg(M ⊗ L^(-1)⊗L^2) = deg(M) + deg(L^(-1)) + 2*deg(L) = 4 - deg(L) + 2*deg(L) = 4 + deg(L)\n\nApplying Riemann-Roch, we get:\n\nh⁰(X, M ⊗ L^(-1)⊗L^2) - h¹(X, M ⊗ L^(-1)⊗L^2) = 4 + deg(L) + 1 - 3\n\nh⁰(X, M ⊗ L^(-1)⊗L^2) - h¹(X, M ⊗ L^(-1)⊗L^2) = deg(L) + 2\n\nSince h¹(X, M ⊗ L^(-1)⊗L^2) = 0 (by Serre duality and the fact that h⁰(X,L^(-1))=0), we have:\n\nh⁰(X, M ⊗ L^(-1)⊗L^2) = deg(L) + 2\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the vector space H¹(X, L⊗L^(-2)) is deg(L) + 2."
