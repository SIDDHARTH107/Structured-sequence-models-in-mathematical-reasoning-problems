    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response y(t) for a unit step input u(t) = 1, we first need to find the Laplace transform of the unit step function. The Laplace transform of a unit step function is given by:\n\nU(s) = L{u(t)} = 1/s\n\nNow, we need to find the output Y(s) in the frequency domain by multiplying the transfer function G(s) with the input U(s):\n\nY(s) = G(s) * U(s) = (s^2 + 2s + 2) / (s^3 + 3s^2 + 3s + 1) * (1/s)\n\nY(s) = (s^2 + 2s + 2) / (s(s^2 + 3s + 3) + 1)\n\nTo find the steady-state response y(t), we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s):\n\ny(t) = L^(-1){Y(s)}\n\nHowever, finding the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s) directly can be quite challenging. Instead, we can use the Final Value Theorem to find the steady-state value of y(t) as t approaches infinity:\n\ny(∞) = lim (t->∞) y(t) = lim (s->0) s * Y(s)\n\ny(∞) = lim (s->0) s * [(s^2 + 2s + 2) / (s(s^2 + 3s + 3) + 1)]\n\ny(∞) = lim (s->0) (s^2 + 2s + 2) / (s^2 + 3s + 3)\n\ny(∞) = 2 / 3\n\nSo, the steady-state response y(t) for a unit step input u(t) = 1 is y(∞) = 2/3."
