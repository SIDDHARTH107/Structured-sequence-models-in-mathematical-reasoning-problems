    "message_2": "Since the Christoffel symbols Γ are given to be zero, we can use the definition of the Riemann curvature tensor in terms of the Christoffel symbols:\n\nRiemann curvature tensor R^a_{bcd} = ∂Γ^a_{bd}/∂x^c - ∂Γ^a_{bc}/∂x^d + Γ^a_{ec}Γ^e_{bd} - Γ^a_{ed}Γ^e_{bc}\n\nSince all the Christoffel symbols Γ are zero, their derivatives with respect to the coordinates x^c and x^d will also be zero. Moreover, the product of any two Christoffel symbols will also be zero. Therefore, all the components of the Riemann curvature tensor will be zero:\n\nR^a_{bcd} = 0 for all a, b, c, and d.\n\nSo, the Riemann curvature tensor at the point (1, 2, 3) has all its components equal to zero."
