    "message_1": "Consider the heat equation in the complex plane,\n\nu_t = u_{xx} + u_{yy},\n\nwhere the initial condition is given by u(x, y, 0) = e^{-x^2-y^2} and the boundary condition is u(x, y, t)|_{\\partial D} = 0, where D is the closed disk of radius R centered at the origin. Find the solution u(x, y, t).",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution u(x, y, t) can be written as a product of functions of x, y, and t, i.e., u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t).\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by X(x)Y(y)T(t):\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = X''(x) / X(x) + Y''(y) / Y(y)\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on t and the right-hand side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\nX''(x) / X(x) + Y''(y) / Y(y) = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) = -λX(x)\nY''(y) = (λ - k)Y(y)\n\nwith k being another constant. The boundary conditions for X(x) and Y(y) are:\n\nX(x)|_{x=±R} = 0\nY(y)|_{y=±R} = 0\n\nThe solutions to the ODEs are:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(√λx) + B*sin(√λx)\nY(y) = C*cos(√(λ-k)y) + D*sin(√(λ-k)y)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nX(±R) = A*cos(√λR) = 0\nY(±R) = C*cos(√(λ-k)R) = 0\n\nThis implies that λ and (λ-k) are of the form (nπ/R)^2 for some integer n. Thus, we can write the solution as:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑[A_n*cos(nπx/R)*cos(mπy/R)*e^(-(n^2π^2 + m^2π^2)t/R^2)]\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all integers n and m, and A_n are constants to be determined.\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = e^{-x^2-y^2}:\n\ne^{-x^2-y^2} = ∑[A_n*cos(nπx/R)*cos(mπy/R)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we can use the orthogonality of the cosine functions and integrate both sides over the domain D:\n\n∫∫_D e^{-x^2-y^2} * cos(nπx/R) * cos(mπy/R) dx dy = A_n * ∫∫_D cos^2(nπx/R) * cos^2(mπy/R) dx dy\n\nSolving for A_n and substituting back into the solution, we obtain the final solution u(x, y, t):\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑[A_n*cos(nπx/R)*cos(mπy/R)*e^(-(n^2π^2 + m^2π^2)t/R^2)]\n\nwhere A_n can be found by solving the integral equation above."
