    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the properties of geometric Brownian motion and the log-normal distribution. The stock price at time t, denoted by S(t), follows a log-normal distribution with the following parameters:\n\nMean: μ = ln(S(0)) + (r - σ^2/2)t\nVariance: σ^2t\n\nwhere S(0) is the initial stock price, r is the drift, σ is the volatility, and t is the time.\n\nIn this case, S(0) = $10,000, r = 0.05, σ = 0.2, and t = 2 years.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the mean and variance:\n\nμ = ln(10000) + (0.05 - 0.2^2/2) * 2\nμ ≈ 9.2103 + 0.06\nμ ≈ 9.2703\n\nσ^2t = (0.2)^2 * 2\nσ^2t = 0.08\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that S(2) > $12,000. To do this, we can standardize the log-normal distribution and use the standard normal distribution (Z) to find the probability:\n\nP(S(2) > 12000) = P(ln(S(2)) > ln(12000))\nP(Z > (ln(12000) - μ) / √(σ^2t))\n\nLet's calculate the Z-score:\n\n(ln(12000) - μ) / √(σ^2t) ≈ (9.3927 - 9.2703) / √(0.08)\nZ ≈ 0.1224 / 0.2828\nZ ≈ 0.4330\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability:\n\nP(Z > 0.4330) ≈ 1 - 0.6671\nP(Z > 0.4330) ≈ 0.3329\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will be above $12,000 after two years is approximately 33.29%."
