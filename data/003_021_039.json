    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors u and v, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere u · v is the dot product of the vectors, |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the vectors u and v:\n\nu · v = (3)(-2) + (5)(6) = -6 + 30 = 24\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n|u| = √(3² + 5²) = √(9 + 25) = √34\n|v| = √((-2)² + 6²) = √(4 + 36) = √40\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n24 = (√34)(√40) cos(θ)\n\nTo solve for cos(θ), we can divide both sides by (√34)(√40):\n\ncos(θ) = 24 / (√34)(√40)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nθ = arccos(24 / (√34)(√40))\n\nθ ≈ 33.5573°\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors u and v is approximately 33.56°."
