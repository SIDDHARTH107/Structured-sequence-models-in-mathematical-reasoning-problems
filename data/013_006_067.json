    "message_1": "Two hunters are trying to hunt a stag. If they both hunt the stag, they will be successful and get a reward of 10. If one hunter hunts the stag and the other hunter hunts a rabbit, the hunter who hunted the stag will not get any reward and the hunter who hunted the rabbit will get only 2. However, if both hunters hunt rabbits, each will get a reward of 1. Determine the Nash equilibrium of this game.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to analyze the possible strategies and their payoffs for both hunters. Let's denote the strategies as follows:\n\nS: Hunt the stag\nR: Hunt the rabbit\n\nNow, let's create a payoff matrix for the two hunters:\n\n          Hunter 2\n          S    R\n        _________\nHunter 1|\nS      |(10,10) (0,2)\n        |\nR      |(2,0)   (1,1)\n\nNow, let's find the best responses for each hunter:\n\n1. If Hunter 1 hunts the stag (S), Hunter 2's best response is to also hunt the stag (S) since 10 > 2.\n2. If Hunter 1 hunts the rabbit (R), Hunter 2's best response is to hunt the stag (S) since 2 > 1.\n3. If Hunter 2 hunts the stag (S), Hunter 1's best response is to also hunt the stag (S) since 10 > 2.\n4. If Hunter 2 hunts the rabbit (R), Hunter 1's best response is to hunt the stag (S) since 2 > 1.\n\nFrom the best responses, we can see that both hunters hunting the stag (S) is a Nash equilibrium, as neither hunter has an incentive to change their strategy given the other's strategy. So, the Nash equilibrium of this game is (S, S) with a payoff of (10, 10)."
