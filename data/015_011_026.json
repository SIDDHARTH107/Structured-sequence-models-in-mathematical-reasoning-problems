    "message_1": "What is the maximum angle (in degrees) that the second pendulum makes with the vertical when the first pendulum is released from an angle of 30 degrees and the second pendulum is released from an angle of 60 degrees? The length of each pendulum arm is 1 meter and their masses are negligible. (Assume that the double pendulum is subject to the chaotic behavior of non-linear systems.)",
    "message_2": "The double pendulum is a highly complex and chaotic system, and its behavior is extremely sensitive to initial conditions. Analytically determining the maximum angle that the second pendulum makes with the vertical is not possible due to the non-linear nature of the system. \n\nHowever, we can use numerical simulations to estimate the maximum angle that the second pendulum makes with the vertical. The specific maximum angle will depend on the precise initial conditions and the level of accuracy of the simulation. It is important to note that the results may vary slightly with different simulations and initial conditions.\n\nIn this case, since we cannot provide a numerical simulation, we cannot give a specific maximum angle for the second pendulum."
