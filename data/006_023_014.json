    "message_1": "In a study of a certain type of consumer behavior in the tech market, it was found that 65% of customers who buy a smartwatch also purchase a fitness tracker. If 150 customers buy a smartwatch, what is the probability that at least 80 of them will also purchase a fitness tracker?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 80 of the 150 customers will also purchase a fitness tracker, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X ≥ k) = 1 - P(X < k)\n\nwhere X is the number of successes (customers who buy both a smartwatch and a fitness tracker), k is the threshold (80 in this case), and P(X < k) is the cumulative probability of X being less than k.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (0.65 in this case), and n is the total number of trials (150 customers).\n\nTo find P(X < 80), we need to calculate the sum of the probabilities for X = 0 to X = 79:\n\nP(X < 80) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 79\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so it's often easier to use a statistical software or calculator to find the cumulative binomial probability. Alternatively, you can use a normal approximation to estimate the probability.\n\nUsing a normal approximation, we can calculate the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the binomial distribution:\n\nμ = n * p = 150 * 0.65 = 97.5\nσ = √(n * p * (1-p)) = √(150 * 0.65 * 0.35) ≈ 6.237\n\nNow, we can standardize the threshold value (80) by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation:\n\nz = (80 - 97.5) / 6.237 ≈ -2.808\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find the probability P(Z < -2.808) ≈ 0.0025.\n\nFinally, we can find the probability P(X ≥ 80) by subtracting the cumulative probability from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 80) = 1 - P(X < 80) = 1 - 0.0025 ≈ 0.9975\n\nSo, the probability that at least 80 of the 150 customers will also purchase a fitness tracker is approximately 0.9975 or 99.75%."
