    "message_2": "To compute the Riemann constant $\\Theta_{00}(0)$, we first need to find the lattice of periods of the elliptic curve. The lattice of periods is generated by the periods $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$, which are the integrals of the differential form $\\frac{dx}{y}$ over two independent cycles on the curve.\n\nLet's denote the elliptic curve by $E: y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7$. We can rewrite the differential form as $\\frac{dx}{y} = \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x^3 + 5x + 7}}$. To find the periods $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$, we need to compute the integrals of this differential form over two independent cycles on the curve. These cycles can be represented by the contours $C_1$ and $C_2$ in the complex plane, where $C_1$ is a closed loop around a branch point of the curve, and $C_2$ is a closed loop around another branch point.\n\nThe branch points of the curve are the roots of the polynomial $x^3 + 5x + 7$. Let's denote these roots by $x_1, x_2, x_3$. Then, the periods $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ can be computed as follows:\n\n$$\\omega_1 = \\oint_{C_1} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x^3 + 5x + 7}}$$\n\n$$\\omega_2 = \\oint_{C_2} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x^3 + 5x + 7}}$$\n\nThese integrals can be computed using complex analysis techniques, such as the residue theorem or elliptic functions. However, the computation is quite involved and typically requires specialized software or numerical methods.\n\nOnce we have the periods $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$, we can form the lattice of periods $\\Lambda = \\{m\\omega_1 + n\\omega_2 : m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. The Riemann theta function $\\Theta_{00}$ is a function on the complex plane that is periodic with respect to this lattice, and its value at the origin is given by the Riemann constant:\n\n$$\\Theta_{00}(0) = \\sum_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} e^{-\\pi i \\tau \\lambda^2}$$\n\nwhere $\\tau$ is the ratio of the periods, i.e., $\\tau = \\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1}$.\n\nIn summary, to compute the Riemann constant $\\Theta_{00}(0)$ for the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7$, we need to find the periods $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ by integrating the differential form $\\frac{dx}{y}$ over two independent cycles on the curve, and then compute the sum over the lattice of periods. This is a challenging task that typically requires specialized software or numerical methods."
