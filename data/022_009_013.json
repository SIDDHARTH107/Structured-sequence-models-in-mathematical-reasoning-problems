The interval of convergence is the set of values of $x$ for which the series converges.",
    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = L$, then the series converges if $L < 1$, diverges if $L > 1$, and is inconclusive if $L = 1$. In our case, the series is given by:\n\n$$a_n = \\frac{(x-3)^n}{n^2}$$\n\nApplying the Ratio Test, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{(x-3)^{n+1}}{(n+1)^2}}{\\frac{(x-3)^n}{n^2}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-3)n^2}{(n+1)^2}\\right|$$\n\nNow, let's find the limit:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-3)n^2}{(n+1)^2}\\right| = |x-3| \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{n^2}{(n+1)^2}$$\n\n$$= |x-3| \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^2} = |x-3|$$\n\nFor the series to converge, we need $|x-3| < 1$. Thus, the radius of convergence is $r = 1$.\n\nNow, let's find the interval of convergence. Since the series converges for $|x-3| < 1$, we have:\n\n$$-1 < x-3 < 1$$\n\nAdding 3 to all parts of the inequality, we get:\n\n$$2 < x < 4$$\n\nHowever, we need to check the endpoints of the interval to determine if the series converges at $x = 2$ and $x = 4$. \n\nFor $x = 2$, the series becomes:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{n^2}$$\n\nThis is an alternating series, and since $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2} = 0$ and $\\frac{1}{n^2}$ is a decreasing sequence, the series converges by the Alternating Series Test.\n\nFor $x = 4$, the series becomes:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^2}$$\n\nThis is a convergent p-series with $p = 2 > 1$.\n\nThus, the series converges at both endpoints, and the interval of convergence is $2 \\le x \\le 4$."
