    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into the given partial differential equation, we get:\n\n$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$\n\nSince the left-hand side is a function of $x$ and the right-hand side is a function of $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda$. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$ and $\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda$\n\nSolving the first equation for $X(x)$, we get:\n\n$X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n\nThe boundary conditions for $X(x)$ are $X(0) = 0$ and $X(1) = 1$. The general solution to this equation is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$X(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 0$\n\n$X(1) = B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = 1$\n\nThus, $B = \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda})}$, and $X(x) = \\frac{\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)}{\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda})}$.\n\nNow, let's solve the second equation for $Y(y)$:\n\n$Y''(y) - \\lambda Y(y) = 0$\n\nThe boundary conditions for $Y(y)$ are $Y(0) = Y(1) = 0$. The general solution to this equation is:\n\n$Y(y) = C\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y) + D\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$Y(0) = C\\cosh(0) + D\\sinh(0) = C = 0$\n\n$Y(1) = D\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = 0$\n\nSince $D\\neq 0$, we must have $\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = 0$. However, $\\sinh$ is only zero at $\\sqrt{\\lambda} = 0$, which would lead to a trivial solution. To avoid this, we consider $\\lambda$ to be complex, i.e., $\\lambda = -\\mu^2$ for some $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then, the equation for $Y(y)$ becomes:\n\n$Y''(y) + \\mu^2 Y(y) = 0$\n\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\n$Y(y) = E\\cos(\\mu y) + F\\sin(\\mu y)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$Y(0) = E\\cos(0) + F\\sin(0) = E = 0$\n\n$Y(1) = F\\sin(\\mu) = 0$\n\nSince $F\\neq 0$, we must have $\\mu = n\\pi$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, the solution for $Y(y)$ is:\n\n$Y_n(y) = \\sin(n\\pi y)$\n\nNow, we can write the solution for $u(x, y)$ as a sum of the product of $X(x)$ and $Y(y)$:\n\n$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} X_n(x)Y_n(y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(\\sqrt{-n^2\\pi^2}x)}{\\sin(\\sqrt{-n^2\\pi^2})} \\sin(n\\pi y)$\n\nHowever, since $\\lambda = -n^2\\pi^2$, we have $\\sqrt{-n^2\\pi^2} = n\\pi$. Thus, the solution simplifies to:\n\n$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(n\\pi x)}{n\\pi} \\sin(n\\pi y)$\n\nThis is the solution to the given boundary value problem."
