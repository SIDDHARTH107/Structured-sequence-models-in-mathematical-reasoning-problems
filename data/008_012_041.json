    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nGiven system:\n```\n2x + y = 9\n4x + 7y = 31\n```\n\nMatrix form:\n```\nA = | 2  1 |    X = | x |    B = |  9 |\n    | 4  7 |        | y |        | 31 |\n```\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (denoted as A^(-1)). To find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we can use the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of matrix A and adj(A) is the adjugate of matrix A.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = (2 * 7) - (1 * 4) = 14 - 4 = 10\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of A:\n\nadj(A) = |  7 -1 |\n         | -4  2 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of A:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/10) * |  7 -1 |\n                  | -4  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = |  0.7 -0.1 |\n         | -0.4  0.2 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution to the system of linear equations by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  0.7 -0.1 | * |  9 |\n    | -0.4  0.2 |   | 31 |\n\nX = | (0.7 * 9) + (-0.1 * 31) |\n    | (-0.4 * 9) + (0.2 * 31) |\n\nX = | 6.3 - 3.1 |\n    | -3.6 + 6.2 |\n\nX = | 3.2 |\n    | 2.6 |\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 3.2 and y = 2.6."
