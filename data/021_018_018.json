    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two types of products: X and Y. The profit per unit for X is $10, and for Y it is $15. The production of each product requires raw materials A, B, and C. The production of 1 unit of X requires 2 units of A, 1 unit of B, and 3 units of C. The production of 1 unit of Y requires 1 unit of A, 3 units of B, and 2 units of C. The company has 100 units of raw material A, 120 units of raw material B, and 90 units of raw material C available. What is the maximum profit that the company can make by producing the two products using tabu search optimization?",
    "message_2": "Tabu search optimization is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is used to find the best solution to a problem by exploring the solution space and avoiding previously visited solutions. In this case, we want to find the optimal number of products X and Y to produce to maximize profit while adhering to the constraints of available raw materials.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- x: number of units of product X\n- y: number of units of product Y\n\nConstraints:\n1. 2x + y ≤ 100 (raw material A constraint)\n2. x + 3y ≤ 120 (raw material B constraint)\n3. 3x + 2y ≤ 90 (raw material C constraint)\n4. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 10x + 15y\n\nTo solve this problem using tabu search optimization, we would follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a starting solution (x, y) and set it as the current best solution.\n2. Define a neighborhood of solutions around the current solution.\n3. Select the best solution from the neighborhood that is not in the tabu list and set it as the current solution.\n4. Update the tabu list by adding the current solution and removing the oldest solution if the list exceeds a predefined size.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a target profit value).\n\nHowever, tabu search optimization is a complex algorithm that requires programming and is not suitable for solving by hand. Instead, we can solve this problem using linear programming methods or by graphing the feasible region and finding the optimal solution.\n\nBy graphing the feasible region and analyzing the corner points, we find that the optimal solution is x = 20 and y = 20. This results in a maximum profit of P = 10(20) + 15(20) = $500."
