    "message_2": "The fractal dimension of the Sierpinski carpet can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere D is the fractal dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski carpet, N = 8 (as there are 8 smaller carpets after each iteration) and S = 3 (as each side of the carpet is divided into 3 equal parts).\n\nD = log(8) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.8928\n\nThe fractal dimension of the Sierpinski carpet remains constant after each iteration, so the fractal dimension after the 5th iteration is still approximately 1.8928."
