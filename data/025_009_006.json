    "message_2": "To show that $\\phi^*: M_C \\rightarrow M_X$ is an injection, we need to show that if $\\phi_1, \\phi_2: X \\rightarrow C$ are two non-constant morphisms of degree 4, and if $\\phi_1^* = \\phi_2^*$, then $\\phi_1 = \\phi_2$. \n\nSuppose $\\phi_1^* = \\phi_2^*$. Then for any line bundle $L$ on $C$, we have $\\phi_1^* L \\cong \\phi_2^* L$ as line bundles on $X$. In particular, if $L = \\mathcal{O}_C(D)$ for some divisor $D$ on $C$, then $\\phi_1^* \\mathcal{O}_C(D) \\cong \\phi_2^* \\mathcal{O}_C(D)$. This implies that $\\phi_1^* D \\sim \\phi_2^* D$ as divisors on $X$. \n\nNow, let $D_1$ and $D_2$ be the branch divisors of $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$, respectively. Then we have $\\phi_1^* D_1 \\sim \\phi_2^* D_1$ and $\\phi_1^* D_2 \\sim \\phi_2^* D_2$. Since $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ are morphisms of degree 4, we have $\\deg D_1 = \\deg D_2 = 4(2-1) = 4$. \n\nBy the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, we have\n$$2g_X - 2 = 4(2g_C - 2) + \\deg D_1 = 4(2g_C - 2) + \\deg D_2.$$\nSince $g_X = 3$ and $g_C = 2$, we get\n$$4 = 4 + \\deg D_1 - \\deg D_2.$$\nThis implies that $\\deg D_1 = \\deg D_2$, and hence $\\phi_1^* D_1 \\sim \\phi_2^* D_1 \\sim \\phi_2^* D_2$. \n\nNow, consider the divisors $\\phi_1^* D_1 - \\phi_1^* D_2$ and $\\phi_2^* D_1 - \\phi_2^* D_2$. Since they are linearly equivalent, there exists a rational function $f$ on $X$ such that\n$$\\mathrm{div}(f) = \\phi_1^* D_1 - \\phi_1^* D_2 = \\phi_2^* D_1 - \\phi_2^* D_2.$$\nThis implies that $\\phi_1^* D_1 - \\phi_1^* D_2$ and $\\phi_2^* D_1 - \\phi_2^* D_2$ have the same zeros and poles, counted with multiplicities. Since $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ are non-constant morphisms, they are surjective, and hence the zeros and poles of $\\phi_1^* D_1 - \\phi_1^* D_2$ and $\\phi_2^* D_1 - \\phi_2^* D_2$ are the preimages of the zeros and poles of $D_1 - D_2$ under $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$, respectively. \n\nSince $D_1 - D_2$ has degree 0, it follows that $\\phi_1^{-1}(D_1 - D_2) = \\phi_2^{-1}(D_1 - D_2)$. This implies that $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ agree on the zeros and poles of $D_1 - D_2$. Since a morphism is determined by its values on a dense subset of its domain, we conclude that $\\phi_1 = \\phi_2$. This shows that $\\phi^*: M_C \\rightarrow M_X$ is an injection.\n\nNow, let's find the induced map of $\\phi^*$ on the tangent spaces at the corresponding points. Let $[C] \\in M_C$ and $[X] \\in M_X$ be the points corresponding to the curves $C$ and $X$, respectively. Then the tangent space $T_{[C]}M_C$ can be identified with the space of first-order deformations of $C$, and the tangent space $T_{[X]}M_X$ can be identified with the space of first-order deformations of $X$. \n\nGiven a first-order deformation $\\xi_C$ of $C$, we can pull it back via $\\phi$ to obtain a first-order deformation $\\xi_X = \\phi^* \\xi_C$ of $X$. This defines a linear map $\\phi^*: T_{[C]}M_C \\rightarrow T_{[X]}M_X$. To see that this map is injective, suppose that $\\phi^* \\xi_C = 0$ for some $\\xi_C \\in T_{[C]}M_C$. This means that the pullback of the deformation $\\xi_C$ of $C$ via $\\phi$ is trivial. But this implies that the deformation $\\xi_C$ itself must be trivial, since otherwise, we would obtain a nontrivial deformation of $X$ by pulling back a nontrivial deformation of $C$. Therefore, $\\xi_C = 0$, and hence $\\phi^*$ is injective on the tangent spaces."
