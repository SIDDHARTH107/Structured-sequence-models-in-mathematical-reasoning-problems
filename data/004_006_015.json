    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 5, we first need to find its first derivative f'(x) and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nThe first derivative of the function is:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 5)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 12x^2 - 24x\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting f'(x) equal to zero:\n\n0 = 12x^3 - 12x^2 - 24x\n\nWe can factor out a common factor of 12x:\n\n0 = 12x(x^2 - x - 2)\n\nNow, we need to solve the quadratic equation x^2 - x - 2 = 0. We can do this by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring works:\n\n(x - 2)(x + 1) = 0\n\nSo, we have two solutions for x:\n\nx = 2 and x = -1\n\nNow, we also need to consider the solution from the factored out 12x:\n\nx = 0\n\nThus, the critical points of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 5 are x = -1, x = 0, and x = 2."
