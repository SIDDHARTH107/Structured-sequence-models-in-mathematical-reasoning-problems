The shop owner suspects that the machine that dispenses the coffee might be giving out too much or too little coffee in each cup. A sample of 25 cups of coffee was selected, and their contents were measured. The sample mean was found to be 8.2 ounces with a sample standard deviation of 0.4 ounces. Using a significance level of 5%, can we conclude that the machine is not working correctly and is dispensing an incorrect amount of coffee?\n\nThe task is to conduct a hypothesis test of the population mean and report the findings.",
    "message_2": "To conduct the hypothesis test, we will use the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 8 ounces (The machine is working correctly and dispensing the correct amount of coffee)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 8 ounces (The machine is not working correctly and dispensing an incorrect amount of coffee)\n\nGiven the sample mean (x̄) = 8.2 ounces, sample standard deviation (s) = 0.4 ounces, and sample size (n) = 25, we will perform a t-test since the population standard deviation is unknown.\n\nFirst, calculate the t-score using the formula:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (8.2 - 8) / (0.4 / √25)\nt = 0.2 / (0.4 / 5)\nt = 0.2 / 0.08\nt = 2.5\n\nNow, we will compare the calculated t-score to the critical t-value at a 5% significance level (α = 0.05) and with degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24.\n\nUsing a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with α = 0.05 and df = 24 is approximately 2.064.\n\nSince the calculated t-score (2.5) is greater than the critical t-value (2.064), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n\nConclusion: At a 5% significance level, we have enough evidence to conclude that the machine is not working correctly and is dispensing an incorrect amount of coffee."
