    "message_1": "Given the following linear logic formula: A ⊸ (B ⊗ C), where A, B, and C are propositions. If A represents the statement \"5 is an odd number\", B represents the statement \"4 is an even number\", and C represents the statement \"3 is a prime number\", what is the conclusion of the formula?",
    "message_2": "In linear logic, the formula A ⊸ (B ⊗ C) can be interpreted as \"if A is true, then B and C are both true\". Let's analyze the given propositions:\n\nA: \"5 is an odd number\" - This statement is true, as 5 is not divisible by 2.\n\nB: \"4 is an even number\" - This statement is true, as 4 is divisible by 2.\n\nC: \"3 is a prime number\" - This statement is true, as 3 has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n\nSince A is true, according to the formula A ⊸ (B ⊗ C), both B and C must be true. Therefore, the conclusion of the formula is that \"4 is an even number and 3 is a prime number\"."
