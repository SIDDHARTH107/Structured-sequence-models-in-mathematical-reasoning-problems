    "message_2": "Since G is a cyclic group of order 12, it has subgroups of orders that divide 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We will find the subgroups of these orders and their generators.\n\n1. Order 1: The trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element. This subgroup is cyclic and generated by e.\n\n2. Order 2: The subgroup H_2 = {e, a^6}, where a^6 has order 2 since (a^6)^2 = a^12 = e. This subgroup is cyclic and generated by a^6.\n\n3. Order 3: The subgroup H_3 = {e, a^4, a^8}, where a^4 has order 3 since (a^4)^3 = a^12 = e. This subgroup is cyclic and generated by a^4.\n\n4. Order 4: The subgroup H_4 = {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}, where a^3 has order 4 since (a^3)^4 = a^12 = e. This subgroup is cyclic and generated by a^3.\n\n5. Order 6: The subgroup H_6 = {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}, where a^2 has order 6 since (a^2)^6 = a^12 = e. This subgroup is cyclic and generated by a^2.\n\n6. Order 12: The whole group G = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^10, a^11} is cyclic and generated by a.\n\nIn summary, the subgroups of G are:\n\n1. {e}, generated by e\n2. {e, a^6}, generated by a^6\n3. {e, a^4, a^8}, generated by a^4\n4. {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}, generated by a^3\n5. {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}, generated by a^2\n6. {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^10, a^11}, generated by a"
