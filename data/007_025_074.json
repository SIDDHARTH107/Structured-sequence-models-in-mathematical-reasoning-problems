    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem related to Diffie-Hellman key exchange:\n\nSuppose the prime number used in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is 11, and Alice chooses her secret number as 3 while Bob chooses his secret number as 5. \n\na) What public key value will Alice send to Bob? \nb) What public key value will Bob send to Alice? \nc) If the shared secret key value generated by the algorithm is 9, what would be the value of K if the prime number used was 23?",
    "message_2": "a) To find the public key value that Alice sends to Bob, we use the formula:\n\nAlice's public key (A) = (g^a) % p\n\nwhere g is the generator (usually 2), a is Alice's secret number (3), and p is the prime number (11).\n\nA = (2^3) % 11\nA = (8) % 11\nA = 8\n\nSo, Alice sends the public key value 8 to Bob.\n\nb) To find the public key value that Bob sends to Alice, we use the same formula:\n\nBob's public key (B) = (g^b) % p\n\nwhere b is Bob's secret number (5).\n\nB = (2^5) % 11\nB = (32) % 11\nB = 10\n\nSo, Bob sends the public key value 10 to Alice.\n\nc) To find the shared secret key value (S), we use the formula:\n\nS = (B^a) % p = (A^b) % p\n\nUsing Alice's secret number (3) and Bob's public key value (10):\n\nS = (10^3) % 11\nS = (1000) % 11\nS = 9\n\nThe shared secret key value is 9, as given in the problem.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of K if the prime number used was 23. We can use the same formula for the shared secret key value:\n\nK = (B^a) % p\n\nSince the shared secret key value remains the same (9), we can set up the equation:\n\n9 = (B^a) % 23\n\nWe know that a = 3 and B = 10 from the previous calculations. Plugging in these values:\n\n9 = (10^3) % 23\n9 = (1000) % 23\n\nTo find the value of K, we can simply solve for K:\n\nK = (9 * 23) % 1000\nK = 207 % 1000\nK = 207\n\nSo, the value of K if the prime number used was 23 would be 207."
