    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1, we will first find the derivative with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 5.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2 - 4x + 1)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 4\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at x = 5:\n\nf'(5) = 6(5) - 4\nf'(5) = 30 - 4\nf'(5) = 26\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1 when x = 5 is 26."
