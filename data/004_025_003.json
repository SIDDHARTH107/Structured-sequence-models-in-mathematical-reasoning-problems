    "message_1": "A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly over a time of 5.21 seconds for a distance of 110 meters. Determine the acceleration of the car and the force exerted on it. (Assume the car has a mass of 1000 kg.)",
    "message_2": "To determine the acceleration of the car, we can use the following kinematic equation:\n\nd = vi * t + 0.5 * a * t^2\n\nwhere d is the distance, vi is the initial velocity, t is the time, and a is the acceleration. Since the car starts from rest, the initial velocity (vi) is 0. We can rearrange the equation to solve for acceleration (a):\n\na = (2 * (d - vi * t)) / t^2\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\na = (2 * (110 m - 0 m/s * 5.21 s)) / (5.21 s)^2\na = (2 * 110 m) / (5.21 s)^2\na ≈ 8.09 m/s^2\n\nThe acceleration of the car is approximately 8.09 m/s^2.\n\nNow, to find the force exerted on the car, we can use Newton's second law of motion:\n\nF = m * a\n\nwhere F is the force, m is the mass of the car, and a is the acceleration. Plugging in the values:\n\nF = 1000 kg * 8.09 m/s^2\nF ≈ 8090 N\n\nThe force exerted on the car is approximately 8090 Newtons."
