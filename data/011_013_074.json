    "message_2": "Polya's enumeration theorem is not the most suitable method to solve this problem. Instead, we can use the combination formula to find the number of ways to select 3 toppings from 6 available toppings.\n\nThe combination formula is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to be chosen, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 6 (total number of toppings) and k = 3 (number of toppings to be chosen).\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!3!)\n\nC(6, 3) = (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(6, 3) = (6 × 5 × 4) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(6, 3) = 120 / 6\n\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 different ways a customer can select their chosen combination of 3 toppings to add on to their pizza."
