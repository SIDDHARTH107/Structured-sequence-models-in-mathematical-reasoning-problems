    "message_1": "A cylindrical surface has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm. What is the Gaussian curvature of this surface at any point on its surface?",
    "message_2": "The Gaussian curvature (K) of a surface is the product of its two principal curvatures (k1 and k2). For a cylindrical surface, one of the principal curvatures is zero (k1 = 0) since the surface is flat along the height direction. The other principal curvature (k2) is the reciprocal of the radius of the cylinder.\n\nIn this case, the radius of the cylinder (r) is 5 cm. So, k2 = 1/r = 1/5 cm^(-1).\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature (K) by multiplying the two principal curvatures:\n\nK = k1 * k2 = 0 * (1/5) = 0\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the cylindrical surface at any point on its surface is 0."
