    "message_1": "A sample of 500 grams of a radioactive material decays at a rate of 0.02% per day. How long will it take for the sample to decay to 250 grams? Use the half-life equation to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the half-life equation:\n\nFinal Amount = Initial Amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nFirst, we need to find the half-life of the radioactive material. We are given the decay rate, which is 0.02% per day. We can use the following equation to find the half-life:\n\ndecay rate = 1 - (1/2)^(1 / half-life)\n\n0.0002 = 1 - (1/2)^(1 / half-life)\n\nNow, we need to solve for the half-life:\n\n1 - 0.0002 = (1/2)^(1 / half-life)\n\n0.9998 = (1/2)^(1 / half-life)\n\nTo solve for the half-life, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.9998) = (1 / half-life) * ln(1/2)\n\nNow, we can solve for the half-life:\n\nhalf-life = ln(1/2) / ln(0.9998) ≈ 346.573 days\n\nNow that we have the half-life, we can use the half-life equation to find the time it takes for the sample to decay to 250 grams:\n\n250 = 500 * (1/2)^(time elapsed / 346.573)\n\n0.5 = (1/2)^(time elapsed / 346.573)\n\nTo solve for the time elapsed, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.5) = (time elapsed / 346.573) * ln(1/2)\n\nNow, we can solve for the time elapsed:\n\ntime elapsed = 346.573 * ln(0.5) / ln(1/2) ≈ 346.573 days\n\nIt will take approximately 346.573 days for the sample to decay to 250 grams."
