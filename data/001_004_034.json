    "message_2": "To factorize the given polynomial x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 12, we can try factoring by grouping.\n\n1. Group the terms in pairs:\n\n(x^3 + 3x^2) + (-4x - 12)\n\n2. Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from each pair:\n\nx^2(x + 3) - 4(x + 3)\n\n3. Notice that (x + 3) is a common factor in both terms. Factor it out:\n\n(x + 3)(x^2 - 4)\n\n4. Now, we can see that the second term (x^2 - 4) is a difference of squares, which can be factored further:\n\n(x + 3)(x + 2)(x - 2)\n\nSo, the factorized form of the polynomial x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 12 is (x + 3)(x + 2)(x - 2)."
