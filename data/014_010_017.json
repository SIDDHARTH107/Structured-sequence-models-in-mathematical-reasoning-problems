    "message_1": "In a simple substitution cipher, each letter of the alphabet is replaced by another letter. If the letter \"A\" is replaced by the letter \"Q\", what letter will \"G\" be replaced with?",
    "message_2": "To determine the letter that \"G\" will be replaced with, we need to find the pattern or rule being used in the substitution cipher. Since \"A\" is replaced by \"Q\", we can find the difference between their positions in the alphabet.\n\nA is the 1st letter, and Q is the 17th letter. The difference between their positions is 17 - 1 = 16.\n\nNow, we apply this rule to \"G\". G is the 7th letter in the alphabet. Adding the difference of 16 to its position, we get 7 + 16 = 23. The 23rd letter in the alphabet is \"W\". \n\nSo, in this simple substitution cipher, \"G\" will be replaced with the letter \"W\"."
