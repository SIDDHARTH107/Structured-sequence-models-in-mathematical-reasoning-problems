    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. \n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's calculate the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B x A.\n\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, we will find the symmetric difference of the two resulting sets, (A x B) and (B x A). The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nSymmetric Difference (A x B, B x A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)} - {(2, 2)}\n\nSymmetric Difference (A x B, B x A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (B x A) and (A x B).\n\nSymmetric Difference (B x A, A x B) = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)} - {(2, 2)}\n\nSymmetric Difference (B x A, A x B) = {(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nWe can see that the symmetric difference of (A x B) and (B x A) is the same as the symmetric difference of (B x A) and (A x B). Therefore, the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative with respect to the Cartesian product."
