    "message_1": "Consider a compact, connected, oriented manifold M of dimension 2 with Euler characteristic $\\chi(M) = 1$. Let $\\gamma$ be a simple closed curve on $M$. Suppose the complement $M \\setminus \\gamma$ consists of two connected components $U$ and $V$. Compute the total number of geodesics on $M$ that intersect $\\gamma$ exactly once and intersect $U$ and $V$ transversely.",
    "message_2": "Since the Euler characteristic of the manifold M is 1, we can deduce that M is homeomorphic to the real projective plane, denoted as RP^2. This is because the only compact, connected, and oriented 2-dimensional manifolds with Euler characteristic 1 are the real projective plane and the connected sum of two projective planes, but the latter has a nontrivial fundamental group, which is not the case for M.\n\nNow, consider the universal cover of RP^2, which is the 2-sphere S^2. Let p: S^2 → RP^2 be the covering map. The preimage of the simple closed curve γ under the covering map p is a collection of simple closed curves on S^2. Since γ separates M into two connected components U and V, the preimage of γ separates S^2 into two connected components as well.\n\nA geodesic on RP^2 that intersects γ exactly once and intersects U and V transversely lifts to a geodesic on S^2 that intersects the preimage of γ exactly twice and intersects the preimages of U and V transversely. This is because the covering map p is a local isometry.\n\nNow, we can count the number of such geodesics on S^2. Since S^2 is simply connected, any two points on S^2 can be connected by a unique geodesic. Therefore, we only need to count the number of pairs of points on the preimage of γ. The preimage of γ consists of two simple closed curves, say γ_1 and γ_2, each of which is a great circle on S^2. Each point on γ_1 corresponds to a unique point on γ_2 under the antipodal map, and vice versa. Therefore, there are uncountably many pairs of points on the preimage of γ, and hence uncountably many geodesics on S^2 that intersect the preimage of γ exactly twice and intersect the preimages of U and V transversely.\n\nFinally, we project these geodesics back to RP^2 using the covering map p. Since p is a local isometry, each geodesic on S^2 projects to a geodesic on RP^2 that intersects γ exactly once and intersects U and V transversely. Therefore, there are uncountably many such geodesics on RP^2."
