    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using Fourier transform, we first need to find the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation:\n\ny''(x) + 4y(x) = 0\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = Â±2i\n\nSo, the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = A * cos(2x) + B * sin(2x)\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1) y(0) = 0\n\n0 = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0)\n\n0 = A\n\nSo, A = 0. The solution becomes:\n\ny(x) = B * sin(2x)\n\n2) y'(L) = 3\n\nTo find y'(x), we differentiate y(x) with respect to x:\n\ny'(x) = 2B * cos(2x)\n\nNow, apply the second boundary condition:\n\n3 = 2B * cos(2L)\n\nB = 3 / (2 * cos(2L))\n\nSo, the particular solution that satisfies the boundary conditions is:\n\ny(x) = (3 / (2 * cos(2L))) * sin(2x)\n\nThis is the solution to the given boundary value problem."
