Let $L$ be the line defined by the equations $x - y = 0$ and $z = 0$. Show that the intersection of $C$ and $L$ is a set of four distinct points, and that $C$ is birationally equivalent to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$.\n\nHint: One way to approach this problem is to use the fact that a quartic curve has 28 bitangents, which are lines that intersect the curve in exactly four points. One of these bitangents can be taken to be the line $x - y = 0$, which intersects $C$ in four distinct points, as required. The remaining bitangents can be used to show that $C$ is birationally equivalent to $\\mathbb{P}^1$.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection points of $C$ and $L$. Since $L$ is defined by $x - y = 0$, we can substitute $y$ with $x$ in the equation of $C$:\n\n$2x^4 + 3x^4 + 6x^2x^2 - 1 = 0$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$5x^4 + 6x^4 - 1 = 0$\n\nNow, let's solve for $x$:\n\n$x^4 = \\frac{1}{11}$\n\n$x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}}, \\pm i\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}}$\n\nSince $x = y$, we have four distinct points of intersection:\n\n$(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}}, \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}}, 0)$, $(-\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}}, -\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}}, 0)$, $(i\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}}, i\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}}, 0)$, and $(-i\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}}, -i\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}}, 0)$.\n\nNow, we want to show that $C$ is birationally equivalent to $\\mathbb{P}^1$. To do this, we will construct a rational map from $C$ to $\\mathbb{P}^1$. Let's consider the projection from one of the intersection points, say $(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}}, \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}}, 0)$, to a point $(x, y, 1)$ on $C$. The line connecting these two points can be parameterized as:\n\n$(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}} + tx, \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}} + ty, 1 - t)$\n\nFor some parameter $t$. Now, we want to find the value of $t$ such that this line intersects $C$. Substituting the parameterization into the equation of $C$, we get:\n\n$2(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}} + tx)^4 + 3(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}} + ty)^4 + 6(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}} + tx)^2(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}} + ty)^2 - 1 = 0$\n\nThis equation is a polynomial in $t$. Since the line intersects $C$ at the point $(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}}, \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{11}}, 0)$, we know that $t = 0$ is a root of this polynomial. Therefore, we can factor out $t$:\n\n$tP(t) = 0$\n\nWhere $P(t)$ is some polynomial. Now, we can define a rational map $\\phi: C \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$ by:\n\n$\\phi(x, y, 1) = [P(t): 1]$\n\nThis map is well-defined since $P(t)$ is a polynomial and does not have any common factors with $t$. Moreover, since the projection is from a point on $C$, the map $\\phi$ is also a bijection. Therefore, $C$ is birationally equivalent to $\\mathbb{P}^1$."
