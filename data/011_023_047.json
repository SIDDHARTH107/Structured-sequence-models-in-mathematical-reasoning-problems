    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors required to color a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color depends on the graph's structure. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nFor a complete graph with 6 vertices, we can use the chromatic number formula for complete graphs:\n\nChromatic number = n if n is odd\nChromatic number = n + 1 if n is even\n\nSince we have 6 vertices (which is even), the minimum number of colors required is:\n\nChromatic number = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, we would need 7 colors to color the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. However, if the graph is not complete or has a different structure, fewer colors may be needed."
