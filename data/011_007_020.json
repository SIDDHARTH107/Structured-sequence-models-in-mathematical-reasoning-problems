    "message_1": "A company has 10 employees, and each employee chooses a different day of the week to take off. However, the company cannot operate without at least 5 employees present each day. How many ways can the employees choose their day off so that the company can remain open every day of the week?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use combinatorics. We have 10 employees and 7 days of the week. We need to find the number of ways to distribute the days off among the employees such that there are at least 5 employees present each day.\n\nLet's consider the number of employees taking a day off on each day of the week. We can represent this as a 7-tuple (a, b, c, d, e, f, g), where a is the number of employees taking Monday off, b is the number of employees taking Tuesday off, and so on. Since there are 10 employees, we have a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 10.\n\nWe need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation, subject to the constraint that each of a, b, c, d, e, f, and g is at most 5 (since there must be at least 5 employees present each day).\n\nWe can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. We have 10 \"stars\" (representing the employees) and 6 \"bars\" (to separate the days of the week). We can arrange these stars and bars in C(16, 6) ways, where C(n, k) denotes the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the cases where there are more than 5 employees taking a day off. There are 7 days of the week, so there are 7 cases where one of the days has more than 5 employees taking a day off. For each of these cases, we are left with 4 employees to distribute among the remaining 6 days, which can be done in C(9, 3) ways. So, we need to subtract 7 * C(9, 3) from the total.\n\nFinally, we have:\n\nTotal ways = C(16, 6) - 7 * C(9, 3)\nTotal ways = 8008 - 7 * 84\nTotal ways = 8008 - 588\nTotal ways = 7420\n\nSo there are 7420 ways for the employees to choose their day off so that the company can remain open every day of the week."
