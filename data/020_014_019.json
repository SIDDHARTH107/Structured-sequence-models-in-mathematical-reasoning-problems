    "message_2": "To find the local minimum value of the function f(x) = x^4 - 5x^3 - 10x^2 + 26x over the domain [-1, 2], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined.\n\nLet's find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 15x^2 - 20x + 26\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0:\n\n4x^3 - 15x^2 - 20x + 26 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be challenging. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing software to approximate the roots. In this case, we find that there are two real roots within the domain [-1, 2]:\n\nx ≈ 0.425 and x ≈ 1.575\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the domain and the critical points to determine which one gives the minimum value of f(x):\n\nf(-1) = (-1)^4 - 5(-1)^3 - 10(-1)^2 + 26(-1) = 1 + 5 - 10 - 26 = -30\nf(0.425) ≈ (0.425)^4 - 5(0.425)^3 - 10(0.425)^2 + 26(0.425) ≈ -6.378\nf(1.575) ≈ (1.575)^4 - 5(1.575)^3 - 10(1.575)^2 + 26(1.575) ≈ -6.378\nf(2) = (2)^4 - 5(2)^3 - 10(2)^2 + 26(2) = 16 - 40 - 40 + 52 = -12\n\nComparing the values of f(x) at the critical points and endpoints, we find that the local minimum value of f(x) over the domain [-1, 2] is approximately -6.378, which occurs at both x ≈ 0.425 and x ≈ 1.575."
