    "message_1": "Suppose the heights of fifth-grade students in a school are normally distributed with a mean of 55 inches and a standard deviation of 5 inches. If a random sample of 25 fifth-grade students is taken, what is the probability that their average height is greater than 57 inches?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of z-scores and the standard normal distribution table. Since we have a sample of 25 students, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with the same mean as the population (55 inches) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nFirst, let's find the standard deviation of the sample means:\n\nσ_sample = σ_population / √n\nσ_sample = 5 / √25\nσ_sample = 5 / 5\nσ_sample = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 57 inches:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ_sample\nz = (57 - 55) / 1\nz = 2\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can find the probability that the average height of the sample is greater than 57 inches. We will use the standard normal distribution table to find the area to the left of the z-score and then subtract it from 1 to find the area to the right (which represents the probability of the average height being greater than 57 inches).\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table, we find that the area to the left of z = 2 is approximately 0.9772. Therefore, the area to the right (the probability we are looking for) is:\n\nP(X > 57) = 1 - P(X ≤ 57)\nP(X > 57) = 1 - 0.9772\nP(X > 57) ≈ 0.0228\n\nSo, the probability that the average height of the sample of 25 fifth-grade students is greater than 57 inches is approximately 0.0228 or 2.28%."
