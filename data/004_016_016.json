    "message_1": "A car travels 80 miles from city A to city B in 2 hours. What is the average velocity of the car during that time interval? Using the mean value theorem, determine at which point in time during the trip the car was traveling at the average velocity.",
    "message_2": "To find the average velocity of the car, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage velocity = (Total distance traveled) / (Total time taken)\n\nIn this case, the car travels 80 miles in 2 hours. So, the average velocity is:\n\nAverage velocity = 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour (mph)\n\nNow, let's use the Mean Value Theorem. The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the instantaneous rate of change (derivative) at c is equal to the average rate of change over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, we can consider the position function s(t) of the car, which is continuous and differentiable on the interval [0, 2] (since the car is moving continuously and smoothly). The average velocity we found earlier is the average rate of change of the position function over the interval [0, 2].\n\nAccording to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists at least one point c in the interval (0, 2) such that the instantaneous velocity (derivative of the position function) at c is equal to the average velocity:\n\ns'(c) = 40 mph\n\nUnfortunately, without more information about the position function s(t) or the specific path the car took, we cannot determine the exact value of c. However, we can conclude that at some point during the trip (between 0 and 2 hours), the car was traveling at the average velocity of 40 mph."
