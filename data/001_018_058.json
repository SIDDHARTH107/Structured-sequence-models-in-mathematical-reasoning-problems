    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the properties of subtraction and equality of logarithms.\n\nlog(x^2) - log(2x) = log(4)\n\nAccording to the properties of logarithms, when we subtract two logarithms with the same base, we can divide the arguments:\n\nlog(x^2 / 2x) = log(4)\n\nNow, we can simplify the left side of the equation:\n\nlog(x^2 / 2x) = log(x/2) (since x^2 / 2x = x/2)\n\nSince the logarithms are equal, their arguments must also be equal:\n\nx/2 = 4\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 4 * 2\nx = 8\n\nSo, the solution for x is 8."
