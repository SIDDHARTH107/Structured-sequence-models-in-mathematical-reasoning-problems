    "message_2": "To compute the Tutte polynomial of a graph, we need to know the number of spanning trees and the number of connected components. However, the information given is not sufficient to determine the Tutte polynomial directly. The Tutte polynomial of a graph G with n vertices and m edges is given by:\n\nT_G(x, y) = ∑_{A ⊆ E(G)} (x-1)^(k(A) - k(G)) * (y-1)^(|A| - k(A) + n)\n\nwhere A is a subset of the edges of G, k(A) is the number of connected components in the subgraph induced by A, k(G) is the number of connected components in G, and |A| is the number of edges in A.\n\nSince we only know the number of vertices (n = 10) and the number of edges (m = 18) in the graph, we cannot compute the Tutte polynomial directly. We would need more information about the graph structure, such as the degree sequence or adjacency matrix, to determine the Tutte polynomial.\n\nHowever, we can provide some general information about the graph based on the given data. Since the graph is connected, it has k(G) = 1 connected component. The minimum number of edges required to form a connected graph with 10 vertices is 9 (forming a tree), and the maximum number of edges is 45 (forming a complete graph). The given graph has 18 edges, which means it is neither a tree nor a complete graph.\n\nIn summary, we cannot compute the Tutte polynomial of the graph with the given information, but we can conclude that the graph is connected and has 10 vertices and 18 edges."
