    "message_1": "A math student needs to find the number of solutions of the equation $z^3 - 4z + 8 = 0$ in the complex plane using Liouville's theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of solutions of the equation $z^3 - 4z + 8 = 0$ in the complex plane, we can use the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every non-constant polynomial equation has at least one complex root. Since the given equation is a cubic polynomial, it must have exactly three complex roots, which may be real or non-real.\n\nLiouville's theorem is not directly applicable to this problem, as it is a result in complex analysis that states that every bounded entire function must be constant. It does not help us find the number of solutions of a polynomial equation.\n\nSo, using the fundamental theorem of algebra, we can conclude that the equation $z^3 - 4z + 8 = 0$ has exactly 3 complex roots in the complex plane."
