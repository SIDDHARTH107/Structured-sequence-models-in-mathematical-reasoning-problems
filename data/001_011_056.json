    "message_2": "To solve the equation (3x-2)/(x+2) = 1/2, we will first eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying.\n\n(3x - 2)(2) = (x + 2)(1)\n\nNow, distribute the numbers:\n\n6x - 4 = x + 2\n\nNext, we will isolate x by subtracting x from both sides:\n\n6x - x = 4 + 2\n\n5x = 6\n\nFinally, divide by 5 to solve for x:\n\nx = 6/5"
