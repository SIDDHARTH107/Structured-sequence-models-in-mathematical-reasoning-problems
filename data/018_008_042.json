    "message_2": "A × B is the Cartesian product of sets A and B, which consists of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. \n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB × A is the Cartesian product of sets B and A, which consists of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is an element of B and a is an element of A.\n\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A × B and B × A are different. For example, (1, 3) is in A × B but not in B × A, and (3, 1) is in B × A but not in A × B. Therefore, A × B and B × A are not equal."
