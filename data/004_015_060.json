    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = x³ - 3x² + 2x + 1, we need to find the points where the second derivative of the function changes its sign.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of the function, f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x³ - 3x² + 2x + 1) = 3x² - 6x + 2\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x² - 6x + 2) = 6x - 6\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to find the values of x where f''(x) = 0:\n\n6x - 6 = 0\n6(x - 1) = 0\nx = 1\n\nSo, there is an inflection point at x = 1. To find the exact location, we need to find the corresponding y-coordinate by plugging x = 1 into the original function:\n\nf(1) = (1)³ - 3(1)² + 2(1) + 1 = 1 - 3 + 2 + 1 = 1\n\nTherefore, the exact location of the inflection point is (1, 1)."
