    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector (4, 1) onto vector (2, 3), we can use the formula for the scalar projection:\n\nproj_u(v) = (u • v) / ||u||\n\nwhere u is the vector we are projecting onto (in this case, (2, 3)), v is the vector being projected (in this case, (4, 1)), and ||u|| is the magnitude of vector u.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product (u • v):\n\nu • v = (2 * 4) + (3 * 1) = 8 + 3 = 11\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of vector u:\n\n||u|| = √(2^2 + 3^2) = √(4 + 9) = √13\n\nNow, we can find the scalar projection:\n\nproj_u(v) = (u • v) / ||u|| = 11 / √13\n\nThe scalar projection of vector (4, 1) onto vector (2, 3) is 11/√13."
