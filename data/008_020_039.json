    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation, and subtract the first equation from the third equation.\n\n(4x + 6y + 8z) - (4x + 5y + 6z) = 7 - 5\n2y + 2z = 2\n\n(2x + 4y + 5z) - (2x + 3y + 4z) = 3 - 5\ny + z = -2\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n2y + 2z = 2\ny + z = -2\n\nWe can solve for y in the second equation:\n\ny = -2 - z\n\nNow substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n2(-2 - z) + 2z = 2\n-4 - 2z + 2z = 2\n-4 = 2\n\nThis result is a contradiction, which means that the original system of linear equations has no solution. The system is inconsistent."
