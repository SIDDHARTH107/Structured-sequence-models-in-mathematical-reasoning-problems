Create a 5x5 grid using the keyword and the remaining letters of the alphabet (omitting J).\n\n   C  R  Y  P  T\n   O  L  G  A  B\n   D  E  F  H  I\n   K  M  N  Q  S\n   U  V  W  X  Z\n\n2. Split the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them. If the message has an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end.\n\n   ME ET ME AF TE RT HE MA TH CL AS SX\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their right (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters below them (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other corners of the rectangle.\n\n   Encrypted digraphs:\n\n   ME -> YD\n   ET -> FI\n   ME -> YD\n   AF -> RF\n   TE -> YH\n   RT -> YC\n   HE -> IA\n   MA -> KN\n   TH -> YI\n   CL -> DG\n   AS -> CP\n   SX -> QW\n\n4. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the encrypted message:\n\n   YDFIYDRFYHYCYIAKNYIDGCPQW"
