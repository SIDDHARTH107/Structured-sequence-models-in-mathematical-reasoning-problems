    "message_2": "To prove that the interval [0, 1] is compact using the sequential definition of compactness, we need to show that every sequence in [0, 1] has a convergent subsequence whose limit is also in [0, 1].\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary sequence {x_n} in [0, 1]. Since the sequence is bounded (0 ≤ x_n ≤ 1 for all n), by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, there exists a convergent subsequence {x_{n_k}} of {x_n}.\n\nNow, let's show that the limit of this convergent subsequence is also in [0, 1]. Let L be the limit of the subsequence {x_{n_k}}, i.e.,\n\nlim (n_k → ∞) x_{n_k} = L.\n\nSince {x_{n_k}} is a subsequence of {x_n}, we have 0 ≤ x_{n_k} ≤ 1 for all k. By the squeeze theorem, we get\n\n0 ≤ L ≤ 1.\n\nThus, the limit L of the convergent subsequence {x_{n_k}} is also in [0, 1].\n\nSince we have shown that every sequence in [0, 1] has a convergent subsequence whose limit is also in [0, 1], we can conclude that the interval [0, 1] is compact using the sequential definition of compactness."
