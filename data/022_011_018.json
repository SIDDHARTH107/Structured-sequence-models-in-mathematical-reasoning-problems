    "message_2": "To find the order and type of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 1) / (z - 2i)^3 at the point z = 2i, we need to determine if it is a zero or a pole.\n\nA zero of a function is a point where the function equals zero, while a pole is a point where the function goes to infinity. In this case, we can see that the denominator (z - 2i)^3 has a zero at z = 2i, which means the function f(z) will have a pole at z = 2i.\n\nTo find the order of the pole, we need to determine the multiplicity of the zero in the denominator. Since the zero (z - 2i) has an exponent of 3, the order of the pole is 3.\n\nSo, the function f(z) = (z^2 - 1) / (z - 2i)^3 has a pole of order 3 at the point z = 2i."
