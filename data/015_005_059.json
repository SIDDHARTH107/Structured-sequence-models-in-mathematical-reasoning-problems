    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent of the Rössler system can be found by numerically solving the system of equations and calculating the average exponential growth rate of the perturbations. However, this process is quite complex and requires the use of numerical methods and specialized software.\n\nTo provide an approximate answer, we can refer to existing literature and research on the Rössler system. For the given set of parameters (a = 0.2, b = 0.2, c = 5.7), the system exhibits chaotic behavior, and the largest Lyapunov exponent is positive.\n\nAccording to some studies, the largest Lyapunov exponent for these parameters is approximately 0.07. Therefore, the Lyapunov exponent for the Rössler system with a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7 is approximately 0.07 when rounded to two decimal places."
