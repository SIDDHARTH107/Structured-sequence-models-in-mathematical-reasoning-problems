    "message_1": "Suppose you have a knapsack with a capacity of 10 and you have following items with respective weights and values: \n\nItem 1 - weight: 2, value: 5\nItem 2 - weight: 3, value: 7\nItem 3 - weight: 4, value: 10\nItem 4 - weight: 5, value: 12\n\nWhat is the maximum value you can carry in the knapsack?",
    "message_2": "This is a classic example of the 0/1 Knapsack problem, which can be solved using dynamic programming. Let's create a table to store the maximum value that can be obtained with a given capacity and number of items.\n\nThe table will have rows for each item (plus one for the base case of 0 items) and columns for each capacity from 0 to 10.\n\nLet's fill in the table row by row, considering each item and its weight and value.\n\n1. For the base case (0 items), the maximum value for any capacity is 0.\n\n2. For Item 1 (weight: 2, value: 5):\n   - For capacities 0 and 1, we can't fit the item, so the maximum value is still 0.\n   - For capacities 2 to 10, we can fit the item, so the maximum value is 5.\n\n3. For Item 2 (weight: 3, value: 7):\n   - For capacities 0, 1, and 2, we can't fit the item, so the maximum value is the same as for Item 1.\n   - For capacities 3 to 10, we can fit the item, so we compare the value of including the item (7 + value of remaining capacity after including the item) and not including the item (maximum value from previous row).\n\n4. For Item 3 (weight: 4, value: 10):\n   - For capacities 0, 1, 2, and 3, we can't fit the item, so the maximum value is the same as for Item 2.\n   - For capacities 4 to 10, we can fit the item, so we compare the value of including the item (10 + value of remaining capacity after including the item) and not including the item (maximum value from previous row).\n\n5. For Item 4 (weight: 5, value: 12):\n   - For capacities 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can't fit the item, so the maximum value is the same as for Item 3.\n   - For capacities 5 to 10, we can fit the item, so we compare the value of including the item (12 + value of remaining capacity after including the item) and not including the item (maximum value from previous row).\n\nAfter filling in the table, the maximum value for a capacity of 10 is found in the last row and last column, which is 19.\n\nSo, the maximum value you can carry in the knapsack with a capacity of 10 is 19."
