    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) up to the third harmonic, we need to compute the coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n for n = 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * π * x / L) + b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere L is half of the period of the function (in this case, L = 1), and the summation is taken over the harmonics (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nFirst, let's compute a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) dx] from -L to L\na_0 = (1 / 1) * [∫(1 dx) from -1 to 0 + ∫(-3 dx) from 0 to 1]\na_0 = [x] from -1 to 0 + [-3x] from 0 to 1\na_0 = (0 - (-1)) + (-3 - 0)\na_0 = 1 - 3\na_0 = -2\n\nNow, let's compute a_n and b_n for n = 1, 2, and 3:\n\na_n = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * π * x / L) dx] from -L to L\nb_n = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx] from -L to L\n\nFor n = 1, 2, and 3, we compute the coefficients as follows:\n\na_1 = (1 / 1) * [∫(1 * cos(πx) dx) from -1 to 0 + ∫(-3 * cos(πx) dx) from 0 to 1]\na_1 = [sin(πx) / π] from -1 to 0 + [-3sin(πx) / π] from 0 to 1\na_1 = (0 - 0) + (0 - (-3))\na_1 = 3\n\nb_1 = (1 / 1) * [∫(1 * sin(πx) dx) from -1 to 0 + ∫(-3 * sin(πx) dx) from 0 to 1]\nb_1 = [-cos(πx) / π] from -1 to 0 + [3cos(πx) / π] from 0 to 1\nb_1 = (1 - 0) + (3 - 0)\nb_1 = 4\n\nFor n = 2 and 3, we can see that the coefficients a_n and b_n will be zero due to the symmetry of the function and the orthogonality of the cosine and sine functions.\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the function f(x) up to the third harmonic is:\n\nf(x) = -2 + 3cos(πx) + 4sin(πx)"
