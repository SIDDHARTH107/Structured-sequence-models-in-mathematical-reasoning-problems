    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: product A and product B. The company needs to produce a total of 500 units of product A and 800 units of product B. Each unit of product A requires 5 hours of labor and 2 units of material, while each unit of product B requires 3 hours of labor and 4 units of material. The company has a total of 3500 hours of labor and 1600 units of material available. How many units of each product should the company produce to meet the demand and the available resources? \n\nUsing block matrices, solve the system of linear equations to determine the number of units of each type of product the company should produce.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We have the following system of linear equations:\n\n1. x = 500 (The company needs to produce 500 units of product A)\n2. y = 800 (The company needs to produce 800 units of product B)\n3. 5x + 3y ≤ 3500 (The total labor hours constraint)\n4. 2x + 4y ≤ 1600 (The total material constraint)\n\nWe can write this system of linear equations as a block matrix equation:\n\n[1 0] [x]   [500]\n[0 1] [y] = [800]\n[5 3] [x] ≤ [3500]\n[2 4] [y] ≤ [1600]\n\nNow we can solve for x and y:\n\nSince the first two equations are already solved for x and y, we have:\n\nx = 500\ny = 800\n\nNow we need to check if these values satisfy the constraints in equations 3 and 4:\n\n3. 5x + 3y ≤ 3500\n   5(500) + 3(800) = 2500 + 2400 = 4900\n\n4. 2x + 4y ≤ 1600\n   2(500) + 4(800) = 1000 + 3200 = 4200\n\nSince 4900 > 3500 and 4200 > 1600, the given values of x and y do not satisfy the constraints. Therefore, it is not possible for the company to produce the required number of units of each product with the available resources."
