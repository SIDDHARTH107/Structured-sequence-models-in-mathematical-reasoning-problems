    "message_2": "A contact structure on a 3-dimensional manifold M is a completely non-integrable plane field ξ, which means that at each point p in M, ξ(p) is a 2-dimensional subspace of the tangent space T_pM, and the Frobenius integrability condition is not satisfied.\n\nThe standard contact structure on the 3-dimensional sphere S^3 is given by the kernel of the 1-form α = cos(θ) dφ + sin(θ) cos(ψ) dθ, where (r, θ, φ, ψ) are the standard spherical coordinates on S^3 ⊂ ℝ^4, with r = 1.\n\nTo find a contact structure on S^3 that is not isotopic to the standard contact structure, we can consider the kernel of a different 1-form. Let's take β = cos(θ) dφ + sin(θ) cos(ψ) dθ + λ sin(θ) sin(ψ) dψ, where λ is a non-zero real constant.\n\nNow, we need to check that the kernel of β defines a contact structure. First, we compute the exterior derivative of β:\n\ndβ = -sin(θ) dθ ∧ dφ + cos(θ) cos(ψ) dθ ∧ dψ - λ sin(θ) cos(ψ) dθ ∧ dψ + λ cos(θ) sin(ψ) dθ ∧ dψ + λ sin(θ) sin(ψ) dψ ∧ dφ.\n\nNow, we need to check that β ∧ dβ ≠ 0, which is the non-integrability condition. We have:\n\nβ ∧ dβ = (cos(θ) dφ + sin(θ) cos(ψ) dθ + λ sin(θ) sin(ψ) dψ) ∧ (-sin(θ) dθ ∧ dφ + cos(θ) cos(ψ) dθ ∧ dψ - λ sin(θ) cos(ψ) dθ ∧ dψ + λ cos(θ) sin(ψ) dθ ∧ dψ + λ sin(θ) sin(ψ) dψ ∧ dφ).\n\nExpanding this expression, we obtain:\n\nβ ∧ dβ = λ sin^2(θ) dθ ∧ dφ ∧ dψ.\n\nSince λ ≠ 0 and sin^2(θ) is non-zero for θ ∈ (0, π), we have β ∧ dβ ≠ 0, and thus the kernel of β defines a contact structure on S^3.\n\nNow, we need to show that this contact structure is not isotopic to the standard contact structure. Suppose there exists an isotopy F_t : S^3 → S^3, with t ∈ [0, 1], such that F_0 is the identity and F_1 takes the standard contact structure to the contact structure defined by β. Then, the 1-forms α and F_1^*β would be homotopic, and thus their cohomology classes would be equal in H^1(S^3; ℝ). However, α and β are not cohomologous, since their difference, β - α = λ sin(θ) sin(ψ) dψ, is not an exact form. This contradiction implies that the contact structure defined by β is not isotopic to the standard contact structure."
