    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, and it is a subgroup of the symmetric group on the vertex set.\n\nIn the given graph G, there are 6 vertices, labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. We will find the automorphisms of G by considering the possible mappings of the vertices.\n\n1. The identity automorphism: This is the trivial automorphism that maps each vertex to itself. It is always an element of the automorphism group.\n\n2. Swapping vertices A and B: Since A and B have the same degree and are connected to the same vertices (C, D, and E), we can swap A and B. This automorphism maps A to B, B to A, and keeps the other vertices fixed.\n\n3. Swapping vertices D and E: Similarly, since D and E have the same degree and are connected to the same vertices (A, B, and F), we can swap D and E. This automorphism maps D to E, E to D, and keeps the other vertices fixed.\n\n4. Swapping both A and B, and D and E: This automorphism is the composition of the previous two. It maps A to B, B to A, D to E, and E to D, while keeping C and F fixed.\n\nThus, the automorphism group of G has 4 elements: {identity, swap A and B, swap D and E, swap A and B and D and E}. In terms of permutations, this group can be represented as {(), (AB), (DE), (AB)(DE)}. This group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, which is a non-cyclic group of order 4."
