    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)\n\nIn this case, the length of the garden is 12 meters and the width is 8 meters. So, we plug these values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2(12 + 8)\nPerimeter = 2(20)\nPerimeter = 40 meters\n\nThe perimeter of the garden is 40 meters."
