    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x²/4 from x = 0 to x = 2, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)²) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x²/4\ndy/dx = (1/4) * 2x = x/2\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 2] √(1 + (x/2)²) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use substitution. Let u = 1 + (x/2)². Then, du/dx = x, and dx = du/x.\n\nL = ∫[0, 2] √u * (du/x)\n\nNow, we need to change the limits of integration according to the substitution. When x = 0, u = 1 + (0/2)² = 1. When x = 2, u = 1 + (2/2)² = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nL = ∫[1, 2] √u * (du/x)\n\nSince x is not present in the integrand, we can separate the integral into two parts:\n\nL = (∫[1, 2] √u du) * (∫[0, 2] 1/x dx)\n\nNow, we can solve each integral separately:\n\n∫[1, 2] √u du = (2/3)(u^(3/2))[1, 2] = (2/3)(2^(3/2) - 1^(3/2)) = (2/3)(2√2 - 1)\n\n∫[0, 2] 1/x dx = ln|x|[0, 2] = ln(2) - ln(1) = ln(2)\n\nNow, we can multiply the results of the two integrals:\n\nL = (2/3)(2√2 - 1) * ln(2)\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x²/4 from x = 0 to x = 2 is (2/3)(2√2 - 1) * ln(2)."
