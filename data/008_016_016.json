Round your answer to 3 decimal places.",
    "message_2": "The Jacobi iterative method is an iterative method used to solve systems of linear equations. It involves rearranging each equation to make one variable the subject, and then iteratively updating the values of the variables using the rearranged equations.\n\nFirst, we rearrange each equation to make x, y, and z the subjects:\n\nx = (1 - 2y + z) / 3\ny = (2 - 2x + 4z) / 4\nz = (x - (1/2)y)\n\nNow, we can use the Jacobi iterative method to update the values of x, y, and z iteratively, starting with an initial guess of x = y = z = 0.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = (1 - 2(0) + 0) / 3 = 1/3\ny1 = (2 - 2(0) + 4(0)) / 4 = 1/2\nz1 = (0 - (1/2)(1/2)) = -1/4\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = (1 - 2(1/2) + (-1/4)) / 3 = (1 - 1 - 1/4) / 3 = -1/12\ny2 = (2 - 2(-1/12) - 1/2) / 4 = (2 + 1/3 - 1/2) / 4 = 5/6\nz2 = (-1/12 - (1/2)(5/6)) = -1/12 - 5/12 = -1/2\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = (1 - 2(5/6) + (-1/2)) / 3 = (1 - 5/3 + 1/2) / 3 = -1/6\ny3 = (2 - 2(-1/6) - 1) / 4 = (2 + 1/3 - 1) / 4 = 1/3\nz3 = (-1/6 - (1/2)(1/3)) = -1/6 - 1/6 = -1/3\n\nWe can continue iterating until the values of x, y, and z converge to a certain level of precision. For this problem, we are asked to round our answer to 3 decimal places. After 3 iterations, the values of x, y, and z are:\n\nx = -0.167\ny = 0.333\nz = -0.333\n\nThese values are rounded to 3 decimal places. You can perform more iterations to improve the precision of the solution, but for this problem, the solution is:\n\nx ≈ -0.167\ny ≈ 0.333\nz ≈ -0.333"
