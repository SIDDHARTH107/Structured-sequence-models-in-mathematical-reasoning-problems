Since G has 12 vertices and each vertex has degree 3, we know that there are 1.5 * 12 = 18 edges in the graph (using the Handshaking Lemma).\n\nLet's consider the possible cycle lengths in the graph:\n\n1. A cycle of length 3 (a triangle) would require 3 edges.\n2. A cycle of length 4 (a square) would require 4 edges.\n3. A cycle of length 5 (a pentagon) would require 5 edges.\n\nWe can see that a cycle of length 3 is the shortest possible cycle in a graph. Now, let's check if G has a cycle of length 3.\n\nSince each vertex has degree 3, it means that every vertex is connected to 3 other vertices. Let's consider a vertex v. It is connected to 3 other vertices, say u1, u2, and u3. Now, if any of these 3 vertices are connected to each other, we would have a cycle of length 3 (a triangle) in the graph. If none of these vertices are connected to each other, they must be connected to other vertices in the graph.\n\nHowever, since there are only 12 vertices in the graph and each vertex has degree 3, it becomes highly likely that at least one pair of vertices among u1, u2, and u3 are connected to each other, forming a cycle of length 3.\n\nTherefore, the girth of the graph G is 3."
