    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation y = 2x^3 - 7x^2 + 3x + 18, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x^3 - 7x^2 + 3x + 18\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and it does not factor easily. We can use numerical methods, such as the Rational Root Theorem, to find the x-intercepts. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (18 in this case) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (2 in this case).\n\nFactors of 18: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±9, ±18\nFactors of 2: ±1, ±2\n\nPossible rational roots: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±9, ±18, ±1/2, ±3/2, ±9/2\n\nBy testing these possible rational roots, we find that x = -1 and x = 3 are roots of the polynomial:\n\n2(-1)^3 - 7(-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 18 = 0\n2(3)^3 - 7(3)^2 + 3(3) + 18 = 0\n\nNow we can use synthetic division to factor the polynomial:\n\nDividing by (x + 1):\n```\n  -1 |  2  -7   3  18\n      |     2   5  -8\n      ----------------\n        2  -5   8  10\n```\nThe quotient is 2x^2 - 5x + 8.\n\nDividing by (x - 3):\n```\n   3 |  2  -5   8\n       |     6  3\n       ------------\n         2   1  11\n```\nThe quotient is 2x + 11.\n\nSo, the polynomial can be factored as y = (x + 1)(x - 3)(2x + 11). The x-intercepts are x = -1 and x = 3. The third factor (2x + 11) does not have a real root, so there are only two x-intercepts.\n\nTo graph the polynomial, we can plot the x-intercepts and a few additional points:\n\nx = -2: y = 2(-2)^3 - 7(-2)^2 + 3(-2) + 18 = -16\nx = 0: y = 2(0)^3 - 7(0)^2 + 3(0) + 18 = 18\nx = 1: y = 2(1)^3 - 7(1)^2 + 3(1) + 18 = 16\nx = 4: y = 2(4)^3 - 7(4)^2 + 3(4) + 18 = 50\n\nPlot these points and the x-intercepts, and draw a smooth curve through them:\n\n(-2, -16), (-1, 0), (0, 18), (1, 16), (3, 0), (4, 50)\n\nThe graph of the polynomial y = 2x^3 - 7x^2 + 3x + 18 will be a cubic curve with x-intercepts at x = -1 and x = 3."
