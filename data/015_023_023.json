    "message_2": "To compute the Lyapunov exponent of the Chirikov-Taylor map, we first need to find the Jacobian matrix of the map. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\nJ(x_n, y_n) = | ∂x_(n+1)/∂x_n  ∂x_(n+1)/∂y_n |\n              | ∂y_(n+1)/∂x_n  ∂y_(n+1)/∂y_n |\n\nFor the given map, we have:\n\n∂x_(n+1)/∂x_n = 1 - k*cos(2πx_n)\n∂x_(n+1)/∂y_n = 1\n∂y_(n+1)/∂x_n = k*cos(2πx_n)\n∂y_(n+1)/∂y_n = 1\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x_n, y_n) = | 1 - k*cos(2πx_n)  1 |\n              | k*cos(2πx_n)      1 |\n\nNow, we need to compute the Lyapunov exponent, which is defined as the average growth rate of the distance between two nearby points in the phase space. For a 2D map, it can be computed as:\n\nλ = lim (n -> ∞) (1/n) * Σ[log(||J(x_n, y_n)||)]\n\nHere, ||J(x_n, y_n)|| denotes the norm of the Jacobian matrix. For simplicity, we can use the maximum norm, which is the maximum absolute row sum:\n\n||J(x_n, y_n)|| = max(|1 - k*cos(2πx_n) + 1|, |k*cos(2πx_n) + 1|)\n\nFor k = 0.2, we have:\n\n||J(x_n, y_n)|| = max(|1 - 0.2*cos(2πx_n) + 1|, |0.2*cos(2πx_n) + 1|)\n\nTo compute the Lyapunov exponent, we need to iterate the map for a large number of steps (n) and average the logarithm of the norm of the Jacobian matrix. This can be done numerically using a computer program. However, it is important to note that the Lyapunov exponent depends on the initial conditions (x_0, y_0) and can be different for different regions of the phase space."
