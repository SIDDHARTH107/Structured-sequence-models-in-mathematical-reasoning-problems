    "message_2": "To find the exact value of sine of 135 degrees, we can first convert the angle to radians and then use the sine addition formula.\n\n135 degrees = (135 * π) / 180 = (3π) / 4 radians\n\nNow, we can use the sine addition formula for sin(π/4 + π/4):\n\nsin(135°) = sin((3π) / 4) = sin(π/4 + π/4) = sin(π/4)cos(π/4) + cos(π/4)sin(π/4)\n\nSince sin(π/4) = cos(π/4) = √2 / 2,\n\nsin(135°) = (√2 / 2)(√2 / 2) + (√2 / 2)(√2 / 2) = 2(√2 / 2)(√2 / 2) = (√2 / 2)² = 1/2\n\nSo, the exact value of sine of 135 degrees is 1/2."
