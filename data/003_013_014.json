    "message_2": "Let's denote the point from which we are measuring the angle of elevation as A, the base of the hill as B, the top of the hill as C, and the top of the tower as D. We are given that the angle of elevation from point A to point D is 60 degrees, the distance from point A to point B is 400 meters, and the height of the hill (BC) is 100 meters.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation to the distances involved. We have:\n\ntan(60) = (CD + BC) / AB\n\nSince tan(60) = √3, we can write:\n\n√3 = (CD + 100) / 400\n\nNow, we can solve for CD:\n\nCD = 400 * √3 - 100\n\nCD ≈ 592.3 meters\n\nNow, we can find the maximum distance from point A to the top of the tower (point D) by using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nAD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2\n\nSince BD = BC + CD, we have:\n\nAD^2 = AB^2 + (BC + CD)^2\n\nAD^2 = 400^2 + (100 + 592.3)^2\n\nAD^2 = 160000 + 692.3^2\n\nAD^2 ≈ 160000 + 479172.29\n\nAD^2 ≈ 639172.29\n\nNow, we can find the maximum distance AD by taking the square root:\n\nAD ≈ √639172.29\n\nAD ≈ 799.48 meters\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance from the point to the top of the tower is approximately 799.48 meters."
