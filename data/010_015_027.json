    "message_2": "(a) Show that $k\\leq n$.\n\nSince $M$ is an $n$-dimensional manifold, the highest possible degree for a differential form on $M$ is $n$. The De Rham cohomology groups are defined in terms of the space of closed forms modulo the space of exact forms, and since there are no differential forms of degree higher than $n$, it follows that $H^i(M,\\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all $i > n$. Therefore, $k \\leq n$.\n\n(b) Suppose that $k=n$. Prove that $M$ is diffeomorphic to the sphere $S^n$.\n\nSince $H^i(M,\\mathbb{R})=0$ for $i\\neq n$ and $H^n(M,\\mathbb{R})=1$, we have that the only nontrivial cohomology group is $H^n(M,\\mathbb{R})$. By Poincar√© duality, we also have that $H_0(M,\\mathbb{R})=1$. This implies that $M$ is connected and has the same homology and cohomology groups as the $n$-sphere $S^n$. \n\nNow, consider the universal cover $\\tilde{M}$ of $M$. Since $M$ is connected, $\\tilde{M}$ is simply connected. Moreover, since $M$ and $S^n$ have the same homology groups, it follows that $\\tilde{M}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^n$ have the same homotopy groups. By the Whitehead theorem, $\\tilde{M}$ is homotopy equivalent to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Since $\\tilde{M}$ is simply connected, it is contractible, and thus, $\\tilde{M}$ is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nThe covering map $p: \\tilde{M} \\to M$ is a local diffeomorphism, and since $\\tilde{M}$ is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$, it follows that $M$ is diffeomorphic to the quotient space $\\mathbb{R}^n/\\sim$, where $\\sim$ is the equivalence relation induced by the action of the fundamental group of $M$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Since $M$ has the same homology groups as $S^n$, it follows that the fundamental group of $M$ is isomorphic to the fundamental group of $S^n$, which is trivial. Therefore, the quotient space $\\mathbb{R}^n/\\sim$ is diffeomorphic to $S^n$, and thus, $M$ is diffeomorphic to $S^n$.\n\n(c) Suppose that $k< n$. Prove that there exists a closed, non-exact $k$-form on $M$.\n\nSince $H^k(M,\\mathbb{R})=1$, there exists a nontrivial cohomology class in $H^k(M,\\mathbb{R})$. This means that there exists a closed $k$-form $\\omega$ on $M$ such that $\\omega$ is not exact. If $\\omega$ were exact, then there would exist a $(k-1)$-form $\\eta$ on $M$ such that $d\\eta = \\omega$. However, this would imply that the cohomology class of $\\omega$ is trivial, which contradicts the assumption that $H^k(M,\\mathbb{R})=1$. Therefore, there exists a closed, non-exact $k$-form on $M$."
