    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |3x + 2| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The expression inside the absolute value is positive or zero.\n3x + 2 = 7\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n3x = 5\n\nDivide by 3:\nx = 5/3\n\nCase 2: The expression inside the absolute value is negative.\n-(3x + 2) = 7\n\nDistribute the negative sign:\n-3x - 2 = 7\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n-3x = 9\n\nDivide by -3:\nx = -3\n\nSo, the solutions to the absolute value equation |3x + 2| = 7 are x = 5/3 and x = -3."
