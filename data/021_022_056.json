The cost of producing a unit in unit 1, unit 2, and unit 3 are $10, $12, and $15, respectively. The company needs to produce 300 units in the next quarter. The company wants to minimize the cost of production. Using firefly algorithm, what is the optimal number of units that should be produced in each unit?",
    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies. It is used to find the optimal solution to complex optimization problems. In this case, we want to find the optimal number of units to produce in each production unit to minimize the cost.\n\nLet x1, x2, and x3 represent the number of units produced in unit 1, unit 2, and unit 3, respectively. We want to minimize the cost function:\n\nC(x1, x2, x3) = 10x1 + 12x2 + 15x3\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 = 300 (total units produced)\nx1, x2, x3 >= 0 (non-negative production)\n\nTo solve this problem using the Firefly Algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of fireflies with random positions (x1, x2, x3) within the feasible search space.\n2. Evaluate the cost function for each firefly.\n3. Update the positions of the fireflies based on their attractiveness (which is inversely proportional to the cost function) and their distance to other fireflies.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a predetermined number of iterations or until convergence is achieved.\n\nAfter running the Firefly Algorithm, we would obtain the optimal number of units to produce in each production unit. However, it's important to note that implementing the Firefly Algorithm requires programming skills and specialized optimization software.\n\nFor this specific problem, we can also solve it using linear programming techniques or even intuitively. Since unit 1 has the lowest cost per unit, it's logical to produce as many units as possible in unit 1, and then distribute the remaining units between unit 2 and unit 3 based on their costs. In this case, the optimal solution would be to produce all 300 units in unit 1, resulting in a total cost of $3000."
