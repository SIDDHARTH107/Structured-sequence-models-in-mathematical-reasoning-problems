    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence for the power series representation of the function f(x) = ln(1+x) at x=1/2, we first need to find the power series representation of the function.\n\nThe power series representation of ln(1+x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = ln(1+x) = Σ((-1)^(n+1) * x^n) / n, for n = 1 to infinity\n\nNow, we will use the Ratio Test to find the radius of convergence (R). The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than 1, then the series converges.\n\nLet's find the limit:\n\nlim (n -> ∞) |((-1)^(n+2) * x^(n+1) / (n+1)) / ((-1)^(n+1) * x^n / n)|\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nlim (n -> ∞) |(n * x) / (n+1)|\n\nSince we are interested in the radius of convergence, we can ignore the (-1)^(n+1) term as it does not affect the convergence. Now, let's find the limit:\n\nlim (n -> ∞) |(n * x) / (n+1)| = |x|\n\nFor the series to converge, |x| < 1. Therefore, the radius of convergence (R) is 1.\n\nNow, let's find the interval of convergence. Since the radius of convergence is 1, the interval of convergence is (-1, 1). However, we need to check the endpoints to see if they are included in the interval.\n\nFor x = -1, the series becomes:\n\nΣ((-1)^(n+1) * (-1)^n) / n = Σ((-1)^n) / n\n\nThis is an alternating harmonic series, which converges. Therefore, the endpoint x = -1 is included in the interval of convergence.\n\nFor x = 1, the series becomes:\n\nΣ((-1)^(n+1) * 1^n) / n = Σ((-1)^(n+1)) / n\n\nThis is an alternating harmonic series, which also converges. Therefore, the endpoint x = 1 is included in the interval of convergence.\n\nSo, the interval of convergence is [-1, 1].\n\nIn conclusion, the radius of convergence for the power series representation of the function f(x) = ln(1+x) at x=1/2 is 1, and the interval of convergence is [-1, 1]."
