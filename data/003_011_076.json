    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The angle of depression is the angle formed between the horizontal line of sight from the plane and the line of sight to the ship. We can create a right triangle with the altitude of the plane (10,000 feet) as the opposite side, the distance from the ship to the point on the ground directly below the plane as the adjacent side, and the distance between the plane and the ship as the hypotenuse.\n\nLet x be the distance from the ship to the point on the ground directly below the plane, and let d be the distance between the plane and the ship. We can use the tangent function as follows:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(15°) = 10,000 feet / x\n\nTo find x, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nx = 10,000 feet / tan(15°)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of the angle and calculate x:\n\nx ≈ 10,000 feet / 0.26795\nx ≈ 37,308.1 feet\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between the plane and the ship (d):\n\nd^2 = x^2 + (10,000 feet)^2\nd^2 = (37,308.1 feet)^2 + (10,000 feet)^2\nd^2 ≈ 1,391,218,256.8 + 100,000,000\nd^2 ≈ 1,491,218,256.8\n\nNow, we can find the value of d by taking the square root of both sides:\n\nd ≈ √1,491,218,256.8\nd ≈ 38,614.6 feet\n\nTo convert the distance to miles, we can use the conversion factor 1 mile = 5,280 feet:\n\nd ≈ 38,614.6 feet / 5,280 feet/mile\nd ≈ 7.3 miles\n\nSo, the ship is approximately 7.3 miles away from the plane, rounded to the nearest tenth of a mile."
