Calculate the Cartan connection of $M$ with respect to this frame.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Cartan connection of the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold $M$ with respect to the local orthonormal frame $(E_1, E_2)$, we need to find the connection 1-forms $\\omega^i_j$ that satisfy the structure equations:\n\n1. $d\\theta^i = -\\omega^i_j \\wedge \\theta^j$\n2. $d\\omega^i_j = -\\omega^i_k \\wedge \\omega^k_j$\n\nHere, $\\theta^i$ are the dual 1-forms to the frame $(E_1, E_2)$, i.e., $\\theta^1(E_1) = 1$, $\\theta^1(E_2) = 0$, $\\theta^2(E_1) = 0$, and $\\theta^2(E_2) = 1$.\n\nSince $E_1 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ and $E_2 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$, we have $\\theta^1 = dx$ and $\\theta^2 = dy$. Now, we compute the exterior derivatives of these 1-forms:\n\n$d\\theta^1 = d(dx) = 0$\n\n$d\\theta^2 = d(dy) = 0$\n\nNow, we can use the first structure equation to find the connection 1-forms $\\omega^i_j$:\n\n$0 = -\\omega^1_1 \\wedge dx - \\omega^1_2 \\wedge dy$\n\n$0 = -\\omega^2_1 \\wedge dx - \\omega^2_2 \\wedge dy$\n\nSince the wedge product is alternating, we can equate the coefficients of the wedge products to get:\n\n$\\omega^1_1 = 0$\n\n$\\omega^1_2 = 0$\n\n$\\omega^2_1 = 0$\n\n$\\omega^2_2 = 0$\n\nThus, the Cartan connection of the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold $M$ with respect to the local orthonormal frame $(E_1, E_2)$ is given by the connection 1-forms:\n\n$\\omega^1_1 = 0$\n\n$\\omega^1_2 = 0$\n\n$\\omega^2_1 = 0$\n\n$\\omega^2_2 = 0$\n\nThis means that the connection is flat, which is expected for a 2-dimensional Euclidean space with Cartesian coordinates."
