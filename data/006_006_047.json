    "message_1": "In a basketball game, the probability of a player scoring a free throw is 0.85. If the player takes 10 free throws, what is the probability that they will make all 10 shots?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the player making all 10 free throws, we simply multiply the probability of making each individual shot together since they are independent events. \n\nThe probability of making each free throw is 0.85. So, the probability of making all 10 shots is:\n\n0.85^10 = 0.1968744043407226\n\nTherefore, the probability of the player making all 10 free throws is approximately 0.1969 or 19.69%."
