    "message_1": "A lottery has 50 tickets, of which 5 are winning tickets. If you buy 2 tickets, what is the probability that you will win at least one of the tickets?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of winning at least one ticket, it's easier to calculate the probability of not winning any ticket and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThere are 45 non-winning tickets and 50 total tickets. The probability of the first ticket being a non-winning ticket is 45/50.\n\nAfter the first ticket is bought, there are 44 non-winning tickets left and 49 total tickets. The probability of the second ticket being a non-winning ticket is 44/49.\n\nThe probability of both tickets being non-winning tickets is (45/50) * (44/49).\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of winning at least one ticket:\n\n1 - (45/50) * (44/49) = 1 - (1980/2450) = 1 - 0.808163 = 0.191837\n\nSo, the probability of winning at least one ticket is approximately 0.191837 or 19.18%."
