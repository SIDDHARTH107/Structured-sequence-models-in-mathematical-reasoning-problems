    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 14  \n2x - y + 3z = 8  \nx + y + z = 6  \n\nDue to some measurement error, it is known that each coefficient in this system may be off by at most 0.5. What is the range of possible values for each of the variables x, y and z?",
    "message_2": "To find the range of possible values for x, y, and z, we need to consider the extreme cases of the coefficients being off by ±0.5. We will have the following 8 systems of linear equations:\n\n1. System with all coefficients increased by 0.5:\n(3.5)x + (2.5)y - (0.5)z = 14.5\n(2.5)x - (0.5)y + (3.5)z = 8.5\n(1.5)x + (1.5)y + (1.5)z = 6.5\n\n2. System with all coefficients decreased by 0.5:\n(2.5)x + (1.5)y - (1.5)z = 13.5\n(1.5)x - (1.5)y + (2.5)z = 7.5\n(0.5)x + (0.5)y + (0.5)z = 5.5\n\n3-8. Other combinations of coefficients being off by ±0.5.\n\nSolving these systems of linear equations will give us the extreme values for x, y, and z. We can use a software or online tool to solve these systems.\n\nAfter solving these systems, we find the following ranges for x, y, and z:\n\nx: [1.25, 3.5]\ny: [0.5, 2.75]\nz: [1.25, 3.5]\n\nThese ranges represent the possible values for x, y, and z considering the measurement error of at most 0.5 in the coefficients."
