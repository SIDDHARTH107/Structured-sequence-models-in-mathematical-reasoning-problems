The company wants to find the optimal route that visits all 5 locations while minimizing the total distance traveled. The distances between each location, in miles, are given in the following matrix:\n\n| Locations | A | B | C | D | E |\n| --------- | - | - | - | - | - |\n| A         | 0 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 6 |\n| B         | 4 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 5 |\n| C         | 2 | 1 | 0 | 3 | 4 |\n| D         | 5 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 2 |\n| E         | 6 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 0 |\n\nWhat is the optimal route for the delivery company to visit all 5 locations while minimizing the total distance traveled?

    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the brute force method by calculating the total distance for all possible routes and selecting the one with the minimum distance. Since there are 5 locations, there are 5! (5 factorial) possible routes, which is equal to 120. However, since the route is a cycle, we can divide this number by 5, resulting in 24 unique routes to consider.\n\nHere are the possible routes and their total distances:\n\n1.
