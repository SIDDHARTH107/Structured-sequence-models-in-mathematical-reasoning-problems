    "message_2": "To determine if a perfect matching exists in G, we need to check if the graph satisfies the Tutte-Berge formula. The Tutte-Berge formula states that a graph G has a perfect matching if and only if:\n\nt(G) â‰¥ n(G) - 2 * o(G) for all subsets G of the graph\n\nwhere t(G) is the number of odd components in the subgraph G, n(G) is the number of vertices in G, and o(G) is the number of odd components in the subgraph G.\n\nSince we do not have the specific information about the edges and vertices of the graph G, we cannot determine if a perfect matching exists or list the edges that form a perfect matching in G. We need more information about the graph's structure to proceed with the problem."
