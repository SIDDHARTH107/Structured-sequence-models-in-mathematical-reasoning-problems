    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal, and its length increases with each iteration. After each iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by a constant factor, which is √2 for the Lévy C curve.\n\nTo find the length of the curve after the 16th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nLength after n iterations = Initial length × (√2)^n\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and n = 16:\n\nLength after 16 iterations = 1 × (√2)^16\n\nFirst, we need to calculate (√2)^16:\n\n(√2)^16 = 2^8 = 256\n\nSo, the length of the Lévy C curve after the 16th iteration is:\n\nLength after 16 iterations = 1 × 256 = 256 units"
