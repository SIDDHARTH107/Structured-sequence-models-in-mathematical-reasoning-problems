    "message_2": "In Pascal's triangle, the value of a number in the nth row and kth column can be found using the formula:\n\nC(n-1, k-1) = (n-1)! / [(k-1)! * (n-k)!]\n\nHere, n = 7 and k = 4. So, we have:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!)\n\nC(6, 3) = 720 / (6 * 6)\n\nC(6, 3) = 720 / 36\n\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nSo, the value of the number in the 7th row and 4th column of Pascal's triangle is 20."
