    "message_1": "A school has 500 students. If the probability of a student passing a math test is 0.8, what is the probability that at least 400 students will pass the test?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 400 students will pass the test, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (students passing the test) out of n trials (total students)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (0.8 in this case)\n- n is the total number of trials (500 students)\n- k is the number of successes (400 or more students passing)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 400 students passing, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 400 to k = 500:\n\nP(X ≥ 400) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 400 to 500\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring:\n\nP(X ≥ 400) = 1 - P(X < 400)\n\nNow we only need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to k = 399:\n\nP(X < 400) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 399\n\nThis is still a large number of calculations, so it's best to use software or a calculator with a built-in binomial cumulative distribution function (CDF) to find the result. Using a calculator or software, we find:\n\nP(X < 400) ≈ 0.0574\n\nNow we can find the probability of at least 400 students passing:\n\nP(X ≥ 400) = 1 - P(X < 400) = 1 - 0.0574 ≈ 0.9426\n\nSo, the probability that at least 400 students will pass the test is approximately 0.9426 or 94.26%."
