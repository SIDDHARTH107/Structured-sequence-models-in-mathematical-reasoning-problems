    "message_2": "To find the perimeter and area of a Vicsek fractal with the given properties, we first need to determine the number of iterations and the scaling factor.\n\nSince the starting square has a side length of 4 units and is decomposed into smaller squares of side length 1 unit, this means that there is only 1 iteration. The scaling factor for each iteration is 1/4.\n\nNow, let's find the perimeter and area for the first iteration:\n\n1. Perimeter: The initial square has a perimeter of 4 * 4 = 16 units. After decomposing it into smaller squares and removing one quarter of each smaller square, we are left with an \"L\" shape for each smaller square. The perimeter of each \"L\" shape is 6 units (3 sides of length 2 units). Since there are 5 \"L\" shapes in the first iteration, the total perimeter is 5 * 6 = 30 units.\n\n2. Area: The initial square has an area of 4 * 4 = 16 square units. After removing one quarter of each smaller square, we are left with 3/4 of each smaller square. Since there are 5 smaller squares, the total area is 5 * (3/4) * 1 * 1 = 15/4 * 1 = 3.75 square units.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Vicsek fractal is approximately 30 units, and the area is approximately 3.75 square units."
