    "message_1": "A pizza restaurant owner wants to know the perimeter of the slice of pizza that contains 60 degrees of the whole pizza. If the pizza has a diameter of 14 inches, what is the perimeter of the slice?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the slice, we need to find the length of the arc and the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius of the pizza. Since the diameter is 14 inches, the radius is half of that, which is 7 inches.\n\nNext, we need to find the length of the arc. The circumference of the whole pizza can be found using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. In this case, C = 2π(7) = 14π inches.\n\nSince the slice is 60 degrees of the whole pizza, we can find the length of the arc by taking the proportion of the circumference that corresponds to the 60-degree angle. There are 360 degrees in a circle, so the proportion is 60/360 = 1/6. Therefore, the length of the arc is (1/6) * 14π = 7π/3 inches.\n\nFinally, we can find the perimeter of the slice by adding the length of the arc and the two radii: 7π/3 + 7 + 7 = 7π/3 + 14.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 60-degree pizza slice is 7π/3 + 14 inches."
