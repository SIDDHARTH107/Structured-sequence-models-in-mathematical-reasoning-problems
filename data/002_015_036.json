    "message_2": "The perimeter of a circle, also known as the circumference, can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 8 centimeters. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nC = 2π(8)\nC ≈ 2(3.14)(8)\nC ≈ 50.24\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 50.24 centimeters, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
