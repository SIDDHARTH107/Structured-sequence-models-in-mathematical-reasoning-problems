    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x, we first need to find its derivative, f'(x), and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = x^3 - 9x is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 9\n\nNow, we set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 9 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nx^2 - 3 = 0\n\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n\nx^2 = 3\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nx = ±√3\n\nSo, the critical points of the function are x = √3 and x = -√3. Now, we need to check if these critical points are within the interval [-4, 4].\n\nSince -4 ≤ -√3 ≤ 4 and -4 ≤ √3 ≤ 4, both critical points are within the interval [-4, 4]. Therefore, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x over the interval [-4, 4] are x = -√3 and x = √3."
