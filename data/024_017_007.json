    "message_2": "To find the components of the vector at the end point, we need to consider how the vector is transformed as it is parallel transported along the curve $y = x^2$. \n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector to the curve $y = x^2$ at any point $(x, x^2)$. To do this, we differentiate $y$ with respect to $x$:\n\n$y' = \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x$\n\nSo, the tangent vector to the curve at any point $(x, x^2)$ is $(1, 2x)$. \n\nNow, let's consider the parallel transport of the vector $(1, 0)$ along the curve. Since the vector is parallel to the tangent vector at each point, we can write the transported vector as a linear combination of the tangent vector:\n\n$(v_x, v_y) = k(1, 2x)$\n\nAt the initial point $(0, 0)$, the vector is $(1, 0)$. Plugging this into the equation above, we get:\n\n$(1, 0) = k(1, 0)$\n\nSolving for $k$, we find that $k = 1$. So, the transported vector at any point $(x, x^2)$ is:\n\n$(v_x, v_y) = (1, 2x)$\n\nFinally, we need to find the components of the vector at the end point $(1, 1)$. Plugging in $x = 1$, we get:\n\n$(v_x, v_y) = (1, 2)$\n\nSo, the components of the vector at the end point $(1, 1)$ are $(1, 2)$."
