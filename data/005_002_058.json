She selects a random sample of 50 days from her sales records and finds that the average daily revenue is $200 with a standard deviation of $20. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true average daily revenue of the coffee shop.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true average daily revenue of the coffee shop, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere\nSample Mean = $200 (given)\nStandard Deviation = $20 (given)\nSample Size (n) = 50 (given)\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √Sample Size\nCritical Value for a 95% confidence interval (Z-score) = 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Standard Error:\nStandard Error = $20 / √50 ≈ $2.83\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error:\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * $2.83 ≈ $5.54\n\nFinally, we can calculate the 95% confidence interval:\nConfidence Interval = $200 ± $5.54\nLower Limit = $200 - $5.54 = $194.46\nUpper Limit = $200 + $5.54 = $205.54\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true average daily revenue of the coffee shop is approximately $194.46 to $205.54."
