    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given differential equation dy/dx = 2x, we need to integrate both sides with respect to x.\n\n∫(dy/dx) dx = ∫2x dx\n\nLet's integrate both sides:\n\ny(x) = x^2 + C\n\nwhere y(x) is the function y in terms of x, and C is the constant of integration. This is the general solution of the given differential equation."
