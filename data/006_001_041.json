    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting 6 or more heads when flipping a fair coin 10 times, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting k successes (in this case, heads) in n trials (coin flips)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (getting tails) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n is the number of trials (coin flips), which is 10 in this case\n- k is the number of successes (heads) we want to find the probability for\n\nWe want to find the probability of getting 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 heads, so we'll calculate the probabilities for each of these cases and then sum them up:\n\nP(X ≥ 6) = P(X = 6) + P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)\n\nCalculating each probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 6) = (10C6) * (0.5^6) * (0.5^4) = 210 * 0.015625 * 0.0625 ≈ 0.205078\nP(X = 7) = (10C7) * (0.5^7) * (0.5^3) = 120 * 0.0078125 * 0.125 ≈ 0.117188\nP(X = 8) = (10C8) * (0.5^8) * (0.5^2) = 45 * 0.00390625 * 0.25 ≈ 0.043945\nP(X = 9) = (10C9) * (0.5^9) * (0.5^1) = 10 * 0.001953125 * 0.5 ≈ 0.009766\nP(X = 10) = (10C10) * (0.5^10) * (0.5^0) = 1 * 0.0009765625 * 1 ≈ 0.000977\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 6) ≈ 0.205078 + 0.117188 + 0.043945 + 0.009766 + 0.000977 ≈ 0.376954\n\nSo, the probability of getting 6 or more heads when flipping a fair coin 10 times is approximately 0.376954, or 37.7%."
