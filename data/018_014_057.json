    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A x B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted by A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = { (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5) }\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B. The complement of a set A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in A. Similarly, the complement of a set B, denoted by B', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in B.\n\nLet's assume the universal set U contains the elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. Then,\n\nA' = { 4, 5, 6, 7 }\nB' = { 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 }\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product A' x B':\n\nA' x B' = { (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 7) }\n\nNow, let's check if the Cartesian product is distributive over complement. For the Cartesian product to be distributive over complement, the following equation must hold:\n\n(A x B)' = A' x B' + A x B'\n\nHowever, (A x B)' is not well-defined, as the complement of a Cartesian product is not a standard set operation. Therefore, we cannot show that the Cartesian product is distributive over complement, as the equation does not make sense in the context of set operations."
