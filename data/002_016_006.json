    "message_1": "A triangle has a side length of 10 centimeters. What is the length of each side in the equilateral triangle formed by connecting the midpoint of each side of the original triangle?",
    "message_2": "In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal in length. When we connect the midpoints of each side of the original triangle, we create a smaller equilateral triangle inside the original one. This smaller triangle is called the medial triangle.\n\nThe sides of the medial triangle are half the length of the sides of the original equilateral triangle. Since the original triangle has a side length of 10 centimeters, the length of each side in the medial triangle (the equilateral triangle formed by connecting the midpoint of each side) is:\n\n10 cm / 2 = 5 cm\n\nSo, the length of each side in the equilateral triangle formed by connecting the midpoint of each side of the original triangle is 5 centimeters."
