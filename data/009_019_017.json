    "message_2": "To solve the stochastic differential equation (SDE) using the Euler-Maruyama method, we will discretize the equation and simulate the process for the given time step h = 0.1. The Euler-Maruyama method is given by:\n\nX(t + h) = X(t) + 0.1 * X(t) * h + 0.5 * sqrt(h) * Z\n\nwhere Z is a standard normal random variable (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).\n\nSince we want to find X(2) and our time step is h = 0.1, we will have 2 / 0.1 = 20 steps. We will simulate the process for these 20 steps.\n\nHere's the simulation:\n\n1. Set t = 0 and X(0) = 1\n2. For each step from 1 to 20, do the following:\n   a. Generate a standard normal random variable Z\n   b. Update X(t + h) using the Euler-Maruyama method\n   c. Set t = t + h\n\nAfter 20 steps, the value of X(t) will be an approximation of X(2).\n\nPlease note that since the process involves random variables, the result will vary each time you run the simulation."
