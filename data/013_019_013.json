    "message_1": "Let's say there are two players, A and B, who are bidding on an item worth $100. Player A can estimate the true value of the item with 70% accuracy while player B can estimate it with 80% accuracy. Player A and B can communicate with each other through cheap talk without any cost. If both players truthfully divulge their estimates, what should be the bid made by Player A and Player B to maximize their combined profits?",
    "message_2": "Let's assume that Player A's estimate is X and Player B's estimate is Y. Since Player A has a 70% accuracy, we can represent the true value (T) as:\n\nT = 0.7X + 0.3E_A, where E_A is the estimation error of Player A.\n\nSimilarly, for Player B with 80% accuracy:\n\nT = 0.8Y + 0.2E_B, where E_B is the estimation error of Player B.\n\nNow, if both players truthfully divulge their estimates, they can combine their information to get a better estimate of the true value. Let's call this combined estimate Z.\n\nTo find Z, we can use a weighted average of X and Y, with weights proportional to their accuracies:\n\nZ = (0.7X + 0.8Y) / (0.7 + 0.8) = (0.7X + 0.8Y) / 1.5\n\nNow, to maximize their combined profits, both players should bid according to this combined estimate Z. Since they are bidding on an item worth $100, their bids should be:\n\nBid_A = 100 * Z\nBid_B = 100 * Z\n\nSo, both players should bid 100 * Z to maximize their combined profits."
