    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 30, we will first show that G has a unique subgroup of order 5 and a unique subgroup of order 3. Then, we will show that G is the semi-direct product of these two subgroups.\n\n1. Unique subgroups of order 5 and 3:\n\nBy Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, divides 6 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n_5 = 1. Let P be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Since H is a normal subgroup of G with order 5, we have H = P.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, divides 10 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 = 1. Let Q be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G.\n\n2. G is the semi-direct product of H and Q:\n\nSince H is normal in G and |H ∩ Q| = 1 (as their orders are coprime), we have HQ = H × Q. Moreover, |H × Q| = |H| × |Q| = 5 × 3 = 30 = |G|. Thus, G = H × Q.\n\nNow, let's define a homomorphism φ: Q → Aut(H) by φ(q)(h) = qhq⁻¹ for all q ∈ Q and h ∈ H. Since H and Q are both cyclic, we can write H = ⟨a⟩ and Q = ⟨b⟩, where a has order 5 and b has order 3.\n\nLet's consider the automorphism φ(b) ∈ Aut(H). Since φ(b) has order dividing 3 and Aut(H) ≅ Z_4 (as H is cyclic of order 5), we have two possibilities: φ(b) is the identity or φ(b) has order 3.\n\nIf φ(b) is the identity, then G is the direct product of H and Q, which is abelian. However, we are given that G is non-abelian, so this case is not possible.\n\nThus, φ(b) must have order 3. In this case, G is the semi-direct product of H and Q, denoted by H ⋊_φ Q. Since H and Q are unique, this semi-direct product is unique as well.\n\nTherefore, G is isomorphic to the unique non-abelian group of order 30, which is the semi-direct product of its unique subgroups of order 5 and 3."
