    "message_2": "To find the cosine and sine values for the angle θ = 60 degrees, we can use the unit circle. In the unit circle, the coordinates (x, y) of a point on the circle represent the cosine and sine values of the angle, respectively.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians, since the unit circle uses radians. To do this, we use the conversion factor:\n\n1 radian = 180/π degrees\n\nSo, θ = 60 degrees * (π/180) = π/3 radians.\n\nNow, we can find the cosine and sine values for θ = π/3 radians:\n\ncos(π/3) = 1/2\nsin(π/3) = √3/2\n\nSo, the cosine value for θ = 60 degrees is 1/2, and the sine value is √3/2."
