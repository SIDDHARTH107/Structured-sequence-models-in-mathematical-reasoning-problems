    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients for the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1 on the interval [0, 1], we will use the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x)]dx from 0 to L\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L)]dx from 0 to L\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)]dx from 0 to L\n\nSince our interval is [0, 1], L = 1. Therefore, the formulas become:\n\na_0 = ∫[f(x)]dx from 0 to 1\na_n = 2 * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx)]dx from 0 to 1\nb_n = 2 * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx)]dx from 0 to 1\n\nNow, let's calculate the coefficients:\n\na_0:\n∫[f(x)]dx from 0 to 1 = ∫(2x^2 - 3x + 1)dx from 0 to 1\n= (2/3)x^3 - (3/2)x^2 + x | from 0 to 1\n= (2/3)(1)^3 - (3/2)(1)^2 + (1) - [(2/3)(0)^3 - (3/2)(0)^2 + (0)]\n= 2/3 - 3/2 + 1\n= -1/6\n\na_n:\n2 * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx)]dx from 0 to 1 = 2 * ∫[(2x^2 - 3x + 1) * cos(nπx)]dx from 0 to 1\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice.\nAfter solving the integral, we get:\na_n = (6/(n^2 * π^2)) * (-1)^n\n\nb_n:\nSince f(x) is an even function, all the sine terms will be zero. Therefore, b_n = 0 for all n.\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients are:\na_0 = -1/6\na_n = (6/(n^2 * π^2)) * (-1)^n\nb_n = 0"
