    "message_2": "Let S be a set with 4 elements, i.e., |S| = 4. The power set of S, denoted as P(S), is the set of all possible subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself.\n\nThe number of elements in the power set of S can be calculated using the formula:\n\n|P(S)| = 2^|S|\n\nIn this case, since |S| = 4:\n\n|P(S)| = 2^4 = 16\n\nNow, let's compare the number of elements in the power set of S with the number of elements in S:\n\n|P(S)| = 16\n|S| = 4\n\nIt is clear that |P(S)| > |S|, which means the power set of S is always larger than S.\n\nIn general, for any set S with n elements, the power set of S will have 2^n elements, which will always be greater than the number of elements in S, as 2^n > n for all n â‰¥ 0."
