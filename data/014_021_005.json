    "message_1": "Suppose we have a message \"HELLO\" that we want to encrypt using Hill Cipher with the key matrix \n\n$K = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$ \n\nand assume all letters are replaced by their respective numbers according to their position in the alphabet, i.e. A=0, B=1, C=2, and so on.\n\nWhat is the ciphertext obtained from encrypting the message \"HELLO\" using the Hill Cipher with the given key matrix?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the Hill Cipher with the given key matrix, we first need to convert the letters to their respective numbers according to their position in the alphabet:\n\nH = 7, E = 4, L = 11, L = 11, O = 14\n\nSince the key matrix is a 2x2 matrix, we need to break the message into pairs of letters. If the message has an odd number of letters, we would need to add a padding letter (usually 'X' or 'Z') to the end of the message. In this case, the message has an even number of letters, so we don't need to add any padding.\n\nNow, we have the pairs (7, 4), (11, 11), and (14, -). We will multiply each pair by the key matrix to get the encrypted pairs:\n\n$K = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n1. Encrypting (7, 4):\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 7 \\\\ 4 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 26 \\\\ 23 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSince we are working with mod 26, we have:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 23 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n2. Encrypting (11, 11):\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 11 \\\\ 11 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 55 \\\\ 55 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nAgain, working with mod 26:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 3 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n3. Encrypting (14, -):\n\nSince we don't have a second letter in this pair, we don't need to encrypt it.\n\nNow, we convert the encrypted pairs back to letters:\n\n(0, 23) = A, X\n(3, 3) = D, D\n\nSo, the ciphertext obtained from encrypting the message \"HELLO\" using the Hill Cipher with the given key matrix is \"AXDD\"."
