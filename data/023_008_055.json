    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the non-periodic function f(x) = x^2 - 3 on the interval [-π, π], we first need to make the function periodic by extending it to a periodic function g(x) with period 2π. Since f(x) is an even function, we can extend it symmetrically about the y-axis. Now, g(x) is an even function with period 2π.\n\nThe Fourier series of a function g(x) with period 2π is given by:\n\ng(x) = a₀ + Σ[ aₙcos(nx) + bₙsin(nx) ]\n\nwhere a₀, aₙ, and bₙ are the Fourier coefficients, and n is a positive integer.\n\nFor an even function, the sine terms vanish, and we are left with:\n\ng(x) = a₀ + Σ[ aₙcos(nx) ]\n\nTo find the Fourier coefficients, we use the following formulas:\n\na₀ = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] g(x) dx\n\naₙ = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] g(x)cos(nx) dx\n\nSince g(x) = x^2 - 3, we can compute a₀ and aₙ:\n\na₀ = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] (x^2 - 3) dx\na₀ = (1/π) [ (1/3)x^3 - 3x ] | (-π, π)\na₀ = (1/π) [ ((1/3)π^3 - 3π) - ((1/3)(-π)^3 + 3(-π)) ]\na₀ = (1/π) [ (2/3)π^3 - 6π ]\na₀ = (2/3)π^2 - 6\n\nNow, let's compute aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/π) ∫[-π, π] (x^2 - 3)cos(nx) dx\n\nSince x^2 - 3 is an even function and cos(nx) is also an even function, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\naₙ = (2/π) ∫[0, π] (x^2 - 3)cos(nx) dx\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x^2 - 3, dv = cos(nx) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = (1/n)sin(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\naₙ = (2/π) [ (x^2 - 3)(1/n)sin(nx) | [0, π] - ∫[0, π] 2x(1/n)sin(nx) dx ]\n\nThe first term vanishes because sin(0) = sin(nπ) = 0 for integer n. Now, we need to integrate the second term:\n\nLet u = 2x, dv = (1/n)sin(nx) dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = (-1/n^2)cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts again:\n\naₙ = (2/π) [ - (4/n^3)xcos(nx) | [0, π] + (4/n^3) ∫[0, π] cos(nx) dx ]\n\nThe first term vanishes because cos(0) = 1 and cos(nπ) = 1 or -1 for integer n, and x = 0 or x = π. Now, we need to integrate the second term:\n\naₙ = (2/π) [ (4/n^3) (1/n)sin(nx) | [0, π] ]\n\nThe term vanishes because sin(0) = sin(nπ) = 0 for integer n. Therefore, aₙ = 0 for all n.\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the function g(x) = x^2 - 3 on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\ng(x) = (2/3)π^2 - 6\n\nHowever, this is a constant function, which means that the Fourier series does not converge to the original function f(x) = x^2 - 3 on the interval [-π, π]. This is because f(x) is not periodic, and we cannot represent a non-periodic function using a Fourier series."
