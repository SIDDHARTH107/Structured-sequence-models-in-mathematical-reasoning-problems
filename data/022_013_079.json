    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(z) = z^2 + 2iz + 2, we will use the rules of differentiation for complex functions. \n\nThe derivative of a complex function f(z) with respect to z is given by:\n\nf'(z) = df/dz = d(u + iv)/dz = du/dz + i dv/dz\n\nwhere u and v are real functions of the complex variable z = x + iy.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of f(z) = z^2 + 2iz + 2:\n\nf'(z) = d(z^2)/dz + d(2iz)/dz + d(2)/dz\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation:\n\nd(z^2)/dz = 2z\n\nFor the second term, we can treat i as a constant:\n\nd(2iz)/dz = 2i\n\nThe derivative of a constant is zero:\n\nd(2)/dz = 0\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\nf'(z) = 2z + 2i\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of f(z) at z = 1 + i:\n\nf'(1 + i) = 2(1 + i) + 2i = 2 + 2i + 2i = 2 + 4i\n\nSo, the derivative of f(z) at z = 1 + i is f'(1 + i) = 2 + 4i."
