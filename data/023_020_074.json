    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 1/x in the interval (-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n.\n\nThe general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nThe Fourier coefficients are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * 1) dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * cos(n * x)) dx from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * sin(n * x)) dx from -π to π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫(1/x) dx from -π to π\n\nHowever, this integral is not convergent, as the function 1/x has a singularity at x = 0. Therefore, the Fourier series for f(x) = 1/x in the interval (-π, π] does not exist in the classical sense.\n\nHowever, we can still find the Fourier sine series for the function f(x) = 1/x in the interval (0, π] by considering only the odd extension of the function. In this case, the Fourier series will only have sine terms:\n\nf(x) = Σ(b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nNow, let's find the b_n coefficients:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫(1/x * sin(n * x)) dx from 0 to π\n\nThis integral can be solved using integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 1/x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = -1/x^2 dx, v = -cos(n * x)/n\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1/x * cos(n * x)/n) - ∫(-cos(n * x)/n * -1/x^2 dx)] from 0 to π\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n) * (cos(n * π)/π - cos(0)) - (1/n) * ∫(cos(n * x)/x^2 dx)] from 0 to π\n\nThe remaining integral is not elementary, but it can be expressed in terms of the sine integral function Si(x):\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n) * (cos(n * π)/π - cos(0)) + (1/n) * (Si(n * π) - Si(0))]\n\nSince Si(0) = 0, the final expression for b_n is:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-1/n) * (cos(n * π)/π - cos(0)) + (1/n) * Si(n * π)]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier sine series for the odd extension of f(x) = 1/x in the interval (0, π]:\n\nf(x) = Σ[((2/π) * ((-1/n) * (cos(n * π)/π - cos(0)) + (1/n) * Si(n * π))) * sin(n * x)]\n\nKeep in mind that this Fourier series is only valid for the odd extension of the function f(x) = 1/x in the interval (0, π]."
