    "message_2": "The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven a sphere with a radius of 5 cm, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * 3.14159 * (5³)\n\nV = (4/3) * 3.14159 * (125)\n\nV = 1.33333 * 3.14159 * 125\n\nV ≈ 523.598 cm³\n\nThe volume of the sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 523.598 cubic centimeters."
