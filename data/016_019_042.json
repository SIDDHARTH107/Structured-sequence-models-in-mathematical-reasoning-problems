    "message_2": "The Koch island is a fractal created by applying the Koch curve construction to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the length of each side of the triangle is multiplied by 4/3. \n\nAfter the fourth iteration, the length of each side of the triangle will be multiplied by (4/3)^4. Since the initial line segment has a length of 3 units, the length of each side after the fourth iteration will be:\n\n3 * (4/3)^4 = 3 * (256/81)\n\nNow, since the Koch island is an equilateral triangle, there are three sides. So, the total length of the perimeter after the fourth iteration will be:\n\n3 * 3 * (256/81) = 9 * (256/81) = 256/9 * 9 = 256 units."
