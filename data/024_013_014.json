    "message_2": "To find the volume form associated with the metric $g$, we first need to compute the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor $G$ corresponding to the given metric $g$ is a diagonal matrix with entries $1$, $4$, and $9$:\n\n$$G = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 9 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\nThe determinant of $G$ is the product of its diagonal entries:\n\n$$\\det(G) = 1 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 9 = 36.$$\n\nNow, we take the square root of the determinant:\n\n$$\\sqrt{\\det(G)} = \\sqrt{36} = 6.$$\n\nThe volume form associated with the metric $g$ is given by the product of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor and the standard volume form in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which is $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$. Therefore, the volume form is\n\n$$\\omega = 6 dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz.$$"
