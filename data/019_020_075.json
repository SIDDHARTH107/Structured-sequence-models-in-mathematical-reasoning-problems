    "message_2": "To determine the time complexity of the sorting algorithm, we need to find the relationship between the input size (n) and the time taken (T) to sort the data items. Since we only have one data point (n=10,000 and T=250 seconds), we cannot definitively determine the time complexity. However, we can make an educated guess based on some common sorting algorithms and their time complexities.\n\n1. Linear time complexity (O(n)): In this case, the time taken would be directly proportional to the input size. If the sorting algorithm had a linear time complexity, it would take 25 seconds to sort 1,000 data items and 2.5 seconds to sort 100 data items.\n\n2. Log-linear time complexity (O(n*log(n))): This is the time complexity of efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and quick sort. If the sorting algorithm had a log-linear time complexity, it would take approximately 83.3 seconds to sort 1,000 data items and 16.7 seconds to sort 100 data items.\n\n3. Quadratic time complexity (O(n^2)): This is the time complexity of less efficient sorting algorithms like bubble sort and insertion sort. If the sorting algorithm had a quadratic time complexity, it would take 2.5 seconds to sort 1,000 data items and 0.025 seconds to sort 100 data items.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot definitively determine the time complexity of the sorting algorithm. However, if we had more data points or more information about the algorithm, we could make a more accurate determination."
