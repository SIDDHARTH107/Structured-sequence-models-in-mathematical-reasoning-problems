The corresponding numerical codes for each letter in the message are as follows: \n\nH = 7, E = 4, L = 11, O = 14. \n\nNow suppose the random key used for encryption is: \n\nK = 3, 6, 9, 11, 2. \n\nUsing the one-time pad encryption scheme, find the encrypted message.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using a one-time pad encryption scheme, we need to add the numerical codes of the message and the key, and then take the result modulo 26 (since there are 26 letters in the alphabet). \n\nThe message is: H (7), E (4), L (11), L (11), O (14)\nThe key is: K = 3, 6, 9, 11, 2\n\nNow, we add the corresponding numerical codes and take the result modulo 26:\n\n(7+3) mod 26 = 10\n(4+6) mod 26 = 10\n(11+9) mod 26 = 20\n(11+11) mod 26 = 22\n(14+2) mod 26 = 16\n\nThe encrypted message in numerical codes is: 10, 10, 20, 22, 16\n\nNow, we convert these numerical codes back to letters:\n\n10 = J, 10 = J, 20 = U, 22 = W, 16 = Q\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"JJUWQ\"."
