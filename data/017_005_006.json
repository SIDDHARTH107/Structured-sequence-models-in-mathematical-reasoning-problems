    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Recall that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. n_3 divides the order of G, which is 27.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe divisors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, and 27. The only divisors that satisfy the second condition are 1 and 27. \n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let P be this Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the order of P is 3^3 = 27, P = G. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 27.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 27\nIn this case, there are 27 Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P be one of these Sylow 3-subgroups. Since the order of P is 3^2 = 9, P is a normal subgroup of G. Now, consider the quotient group G/P. The order of G/P is |G|/|P| = 27/9 = 3, which implies that G/P is a cyclic group of order 3. Let Q be a subgroup of G such that G/P is isomorphic to Q. Then, Q has order 3.\n\nNow, we claim that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q. To show this, we need to prove that the intersection of P and Q is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Suppose there exists an element x in P ∩ Q. Then, the order of x must divide both |P| = 9 and |Q| = 3. Since 3 is a prime and does not divide 9, the only possibility is that the order of x is 1, which means x = e. Thus, P ∩ Q = {e}.\n\nFinally, since |P| = 9 and |Q| = 3, and P ∩ Q = {e}, we have |P × Q| = |P| × |Q| = 27, which is the order of G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, where P is a cyclic group of order 9 and Q is a cyclic group of order 3.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either a cyclic group of order 27 or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
