    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph, we will use the recursive formula for the Tutte polynomial T(G; x, y), where G is the graph:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G-e; x, y) + T(G*e; x, y) if e is not a loop nor a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = x * T(G/e; x, y) if e is a loop,\nT(G; x, y) = y * T(G-e; x, y) if e is a bridge.\n\nHere, G-e denotes the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, G*e denotes the graph obtained by contracting the edge e, and G/e denotes the graph obtained by deleting the edge e and identifying its endpoints.\n\nLet's label the edges of the graph as follows:\n\n```\n   1--2\n  /a\\ |b\n 4---3\n  \\c/ \n   5\n```\n\nEdge a is a bridge, so we can apply the third case of the formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = y * T(G-a; x, y)\n\nNow, G-a has the following structure:\n\n```\n   1--2\n    \\ |b\n 4---3\n  \\c/ \n   5\n```\n\nEdge b is a bridge in G-a, so we can apply the third case of the formula again:\n\nT(G-a; x, y) = y * T(G-a-b; x, y)\n\nNow, G-a-b has the following structure:\n\n```\n   1  2\n    \\  \n 4---3\n  \\c/ \n   5\n```\n\nEdge c is a bridge in G-a-b, so we can apply the third case of the formula again:\n\nT(G-a-b; x, y) = y * T(G-a-b-c; x, y)\n\nNow, G-a-b-c has the following structure:\n\n```\n   1  2\n       \n 4   3\n    / \n   5\n```\n\nThis graph has 4 connected components: vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the edge connecting vertices 3 and 5. The Tutte polynomial of a graph with n connected components is x^(n-1). In this case, n = 4, so:\n\nT(G-a-b-c; x, y) = x^(4-1) = x^3\n\nNow we can substitute this back into the previous equations:\n\nT(G-a-b; x, y) = y * x^3\nT(G-a; x, y) = y * (y * x^3) = y^2 * x^3\nT(G; x, y) = y * (y^2 * x^3) = y^3 * x^3\n\nSo the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is:\n\nT(G; x, y) = y^3 * x^3"
