    "message_2": "To find the median of a set of numbers using the non-parametric method, follow these steps:\n\n1. Arrange the numbers in ascending order.\n2. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle value.\n3. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\nThe given set of numbers is already in ascending order: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 17, 20\n\nSince there are 10 numbers (an even number), we need to find the average of the two middle values. The middle values are 7 and 8.\n\nThe median is the average of 7 and 8:\n\n(7 + 8) / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5\n\nSo, the median of the given set of numbers is 7.5."
