However, the dataset contains some outliers. Using the median absolute deviation (MAD) as a measure of spread, if an observation is considered an outlier if it is more than k times the MAD away from the median, what is the largest value of k where no observation in the dataset would be considered an outlier?",
    "message_2": "To find the largest value of k where no observation in the dataset would be considered an outlier, we need to first calculate the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD). \n\nMAD is the median of the absolute deviations from the median. Since we don't have the actual data points, we can't compute the MAD directly. However, we can use the information given about the quartiles to find the range within which the MAD must lie.\n\nThe first quartile (Q1) is 15, and the third quartile (Q3) is 25. The Interquartile Range (IQR) is the difference between Q3 and Q1, which is 25 - 15 = 10. The IQR contains the middle 50% of the data, so the absolute deviations from the median for these data points must be within the range of 0 to 10/2 = 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the largest value of k where no observation would be considered an outlier. Since the absolute deviations from the median for the middle 50% of the data are within the range of 0 to 5, we can set k such that k times the MAD is equal to 5.\n\nk * MAD = 5\n\nSince we know that the MAD must be less than or equal to 5 (as it's the maximum absolute deviation for the middle 50% of the data), the largest value of k would be when MAD is equal to 5.\n\nk * 5 = 5\n\nk = 1\n\nSo, the largest value of k where no observation in the dataset would be considered an outlier is 1."
