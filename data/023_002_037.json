    "message_2": "To determine the convergence of the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] at the point x = 0, we first need to find the Fourier series representation of the function.\n\nSince f(x) = x is an odd function, we only need to compute the sine series. The Fourier sine series is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑(b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nwhere b_n = (2/L) * ∫(f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx) from -L to L (L = π in our case).\n\nSo, b_n = (2/π) * ∫(x * sin(n * x) dx) from -π to π.\n\nTo compute b_n, we need to integrate by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = sin(n * x) dx.\nThen, du = dx and v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = u*v - ∫v du\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(n * x) + (1/n^2) * sin(n * x)] from -π to π\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(π/n) * cos(n * π) - (-π/n) * cos(-n * π)] = 0 (since cos(n * π) = -1 for odd n and 1 for even n)\n\nThus, b_n = 0 for all n.\n\nThe Fourier sine series of f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = ∑(0 * sin(n * x)) = 0\n\nAt x = 0, the Fourier series converges to f(0) = 0."
