    "message_2": "A sphere inscribed in a cube touches all the faces of the cube. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. In this case, the diameter of the sphere is 5 centimeters. The radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, so the radius is 2.5 centimeters.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is given by:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nWhere V is the volume, π is a mathematical constant (approximately 3.14159), and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nSubstituting the given radius into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(2.5)³\n\nV = (4/3)π(15.625)\n\nV ≈ 65.45 cubic centimeters\n\nThe volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube is approximately 65.45 cubic centimeters."
