    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, and its length increases with each iteration. In the first iteration, there are 3 segments, and in each subsequent iteration, the number of segments is multiplied by 3. \n\nTo find the length of the Peano curve after 5 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = (initial number of segments) * (3^(number of iterations - 1))\n\nLength = 3 * (3^(5-1))\n\nLength = 3 * (3^4)\n\nLength = 3 * 81\n\nLength = 243\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve after 5 iterations, assuming each segment has a length of 1, is 243."
