    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 3x + 4y = 17, we need to find integer values for x and y that satisfy the equation.\n\nFirst, let's find a particular solution. We can try different integer values for x and see if we get an integer value for y.\n\nLet x = 1, then the equation becomes:\n3(1) + 4y = 17\n4y = 14\ny = 14/4\n\nSince y is not an integer, we can try another value for x.\n\nLet x = 2, then the equation becomes:\n3(2) + 4y = 17\n6 + 4y = 17\n4y = 11\ny = 11/4\n\nAgain, y is not an integer. Let's try x = 3.\n\n3(3) + 4y = 17\n9 + 4y = 17\n4y = 8\ny = 2\n\nNow we have a particular solution: x = 3 and y = 2.\n\nNext, we need to find the general solution. To do this, we can use the fact that the general solution of a Diophantine equation of the form ax + by = c can be written as:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is a particular solution, d = gcd(a, b), and n is an integer.\n\nIn our case, a = 3, b = 4, and c = 17. The greatest common divisor of 3 and 4 is 1 (gcd(3, 4) = 1). So, the general solution is:\n\nx = 3 + 4n\ny = 2 - 3n\n\nFor different integer values of n, we get different integer solutions for x and y:\n\nn = 0: x = 3, y = 2 (this is the particular solution we found earlier)\nn = 1: x = 7, y = -1\nn = -1: x = -1, y = 5\n\nAnd so on. The general solution of the Diophantine equation 3x + 4y = 17 is given by:\n\nx = 3 + 4n\ny = 2 - 3n\n\nwhere n is an integer."
