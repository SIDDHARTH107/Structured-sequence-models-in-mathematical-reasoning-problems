    "message_2": "To show that $f$ is a smooth function, we need to show that all its partial derivatives of all orders exist and are continuous on the open unit disk $D$. \n\nFirst, let's compute the first-order partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2y - 4xy^2 + y^3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = x^3 - 4x^2y + 3xy^2$\n\nNow, let's compute the second-order partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6xy - 4y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 3x^2 - 4xy + 3y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = -4x^2 + 6xy$\n\nNotice that all the partial derivatives are polynomials in $x$ and $y$. Polynomials are smooth functions, as they have continuous derivatives of all orders. Therefore, the first and second-order partial derivatives of $f$ are smooth functions.\n\nNow, let's compute the third-order partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^3 f}{\\partial x^3} = 6y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^3 f}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y} = 6x - 4y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^3 f}{\\partial x \\partial y^2} = 6y - 4x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^3 f}{\\partial y^3} = 6x$\n\nAgain, all the third-order partial derivatives are polynomials in $x$ and $y$, and hence they are smooth functions.\n\nIn general, the partial derivatives of $f$ of any order will be polynomials in $x$ and $y$, as differentiating a polynomial will always result in another polynomial. Therefore, all the partial derivatives of $f$ of all orders exist and are continuous on the open unit disk $D$, which means that $f$ is a smooth function."
