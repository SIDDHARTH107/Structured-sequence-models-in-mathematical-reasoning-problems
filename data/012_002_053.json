    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nIn this graph, we can color the vertices as follows:\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A\n2. Color vertex 2 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertex 1)\n3. Color vertex 3 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertex 1)\n4. Color vertex 4 with color A (since it's adjacent to vertices 2 and 3)\n5. Color vertex 5 with color A (since it's adjacent to vertex 3)\n6. Color vertex 6 with color B (since it's adjacent to vertices 4 and 5)\n\nThe coloring looks like this:\n\n```\n  A -- B\n  |    |\n  B -- A\n  |    |\n  A -- B\n```\n\nSince we were able to color the graph using only two colors (A and B) and no two adjacent vertices share the same color, the chromatic number of this graph is 2."
