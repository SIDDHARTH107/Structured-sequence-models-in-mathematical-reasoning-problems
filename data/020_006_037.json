The company has 500 square meters of wood available. Each desk is sold for \\$150 and each chair is sold for \\$80. The company wants to maximize its profit. \n\nWrite a mixed-integer programming problem that will help the company determine the number of desks and chairs it should produce to maximize its profit while using all of the available wood.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of desks and y be the number of chairs produced.\n\nObjective function:\nMaximize profit P = 150x + 80y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Wood constraint: x + 0.5y <= 500\n2. Non-negativity constraints: x >= 0, y >= 0\n3. Integer constraints: x and y must be integers\n\nThe mixed-integer programming problem can be written as:\n\nMaximize P = 150x + 80y\nSubject to:\nx + 0.5y <= 500\nx >= 0\ny >= 0\nx, y âˆˆ Z (integers)"
