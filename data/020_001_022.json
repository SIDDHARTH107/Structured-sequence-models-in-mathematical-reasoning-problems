    "message_1": "A factory produces two products, X and Y. The total production time is 2400 hours per week, and the profit per unit of product X and Y are $20 and $30 respectively. The factory can sell all the products produced. However, the production process requires two resources - raw material and labor. Each unit of product X requires five hours of labor and three units of raw material, and each unit of product Y requires eight hours of labor and four units of raw material. The factory has a maximum of 8000 units of raw material and 4800 hours of labor available per week for production. How many units of each product should the factory produce to maximize its weekly profit, and what will be the maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y produced per week.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y.\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n1. Labor constraint: 5x + 8y ≤ 4800 (hours of labor available per week)\n2. Raw material constraint: 3x + 4y ≤ 8000 (units of raw material available per week)\n3. Production time constraint: x + y ≤ 2400 (total production time per week)\n4. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\n1. Labor constraint: 5x + 8y ≤ 4800\nDivide by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5 and 8, which is 1:\n5x + 8y ≤ 4800\n\n2. Raw material constraint: 3x + 4y ≤ 8000\nDivide by the GCD of 3 and 4, which is 1:\n3x + 4y ≤ 8000\n\n3. Production time constraint: x + y ≤ 2400\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the intersections of the constraint lines:\n\nIntersection of labor and raw material constraints:\n5x + 8y = 4800\n3x + 4y = 8000\n\nMultiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 5 to eliminate x:\n15x + 24y = 14400\n15x + 20y = 40000\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n-4y = -4400\ny = 1100\n\nSubstitute y back into the first equation to find x:\n5x + 8(1100) = 4800\n5x = 4800 - 8800\n5x = -4000\nx = -800\n\nSince x cannot be negative, there is no intersection between the labor and raw material constraints.\n\nIntersection of labor and production time constraints:\n5x + 8y = 4800\nx + y = 2400\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation:\n4x + 7y = 2400\ny = (2400 - 4x) / 7\n\nSince x and y must be integers, we will test integer values of x that satisfy the labor constraint:\nx = 0: y = (2400 - 4(0)) / 7 = 342.857 (not an integer)\nx = 1: y = (2400 - 4(1)) / 7 = 340 (integer)\n\nSo, the intersection point is (1, 340).\n\nIntersection of raw material and production time constraints:\n3x + 4y = 8000\nx + y = 2400\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation:\n2x + 3y = 5600\ny = (5600 - 2x) / 3\n\nSince x and y must be integers, we will test integer values of x that satisfy the raw material constraint:\nx = 0: y = (5600 - 2(0)) / 3 = 1866.667 (not an integer)\nx = 1: y = (5600 - 2(1)) / 3 = 1866 (not an integer)\nx = 2: y = (5600 - 2(2)) / 3 = 1864 (not an integer)\n...\nx = 2666: y = (5600 - 2(2666)) / 3 = 0 (integer)\n\nSo, the intersection point is (2666, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y at the corner points of the feasible region:\n\nP(0, 0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\nP(1, 340) = 20(1) + 30(340) = $10,220\nP(2666, 0) = 20(2666) + 30(0) = $53,320\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (2666, 0), where the factory should produce 2666 units of product X and 0 units of product Y. The maximum weekly profit will be $53,320."
