    "message_2": "To find the points on the surface where the tangent plane is parallel to the xy-plane, we need to find the points where the normal vector to the surface is parallel to the z-axis. The normal vector can be found by taking the gradient of the function.\n\nLet $F(x, y, z) = z^2 - x^3 - y^3 + 3xy$. Then the gradient of F is given by:\n\n∇F = (∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y, ∂F/∂z)\n\nNow we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 + 3y\n∂F/∂y = -3y^2 + 3x\n∂F/∂z = 2z\n\nFor the tangent plane to be parallel to the xy-plane, the normal vector must be parallel to the z-axis. This means that the x and y components of the gradient must be zero:\n\n-3x^2 + 3y = 0\n-3y^2 + 3x = 0\n\nDivide both equations by 3:\n\n-x^2 + y = 0\n-y^2 + x = 0\n\nNow we can solve this system of equations. From the first equation, we get:\n\ny = x^2\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\n-(x^2)^2 + x = 0\n-x^4 + x = 0\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx(-x^3 + 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = 0\n-x^3 + 1 = 0 => x^3 = 1 => x = 1\n\nNow we find the corresponding y values:\n\nFor x = 0:\ny = (0)^2 = 0\n\nFor x = 1:\ny = (1)^2 = 1\n\nSo we have two points on the surface where the tangent plane is parallel to the xy-plane: (0, 0, 0) and (1, 1, 0).\n\nHowever, we need to check if these points satisfy the original equation of the surface:\n\nFor (0, 0, 0):\n0^2 = 0^3 + 0^3 - 3(0)(0) => 0 = 0 (True)\n\nFor (1, 1, 0):\n0^2 = 1^3 + 1^3 - 3(1)(1) => 0 = 2 - 3 (False)\n\nSo the only point on the surface where the tangent plane is parallel to the xy-plane is (0, 0, 0)."
