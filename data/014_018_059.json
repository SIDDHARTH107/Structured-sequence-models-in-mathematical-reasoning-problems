    "message_1": "Suppose we have a substitution cipher where each letter is replaced with another letter in the alphabet. If the letter \"A\" is substituted with \"D\", what is the probability that a randomly chosen letter is a \"D\" in the encoded message consisting of 100 letters?",
    "message_2": "Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, the probability of any letter being replaced by \"D\" is 1/26. In this case, the letter \"A\" is replaced by \"D\". Therefore, the probability of a randomly chosen letter being a \"D\" in the encoded message is the same as the probability of a randomly chosen letter being an \"A\" in the original message.\n\nAssuming that each letter in the alphabet has an equal probability of appearing in the original message, the probability of a randomly chosen letter being an \"A\" is 1/26. \n\nThus, the probability that a randomly chosen letter is a \"D\" in the encoded message consisting of 100 letters is also 1/26 or approximately 0.0385 (rounded to four decimal places)."
