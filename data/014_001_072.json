    "message_1": "Suppose you are using RSA encryption with a public key (e=13, n=221) to encrypt a message. If you want to send the message \"246\", what will be the encrypted message that you will send? Use the RSA encryption formula to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"246\" using RSA encryption with the public key (e=13, n=221), we will use the RSA encryption formula:\n\nC ≡ M^e (mod n)\n\nwhere C is the encrypted message, M is the original message (in this case, 246), e is the encryption exponent (13), and n is the modulus (221).\n\nC ≡ 246^13 (mod 221)\n\nTo calculate this, we can use the modular exponentiation method:\n\n1. Calculate 246^13:\n246^13 = 114415582592768696313614286\n\n2. Calculate the remainder when divided by 221:\n114415582592768696313614286 (mod 221) = 76\n\nSo, the encrypted message C is 76."
