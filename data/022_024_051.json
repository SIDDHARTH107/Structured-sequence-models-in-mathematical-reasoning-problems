    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) about the point z = 3 + i, we first need to rewrite the function in terms of (z - (3 + i)). Let's denote w = z - (3 + i), so z = w + (3 + i). Then, we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = f(w + (3 + i)) = (2(w + (3 + i)) + 4i)/((w + (3 + i))^2 + 6(w + (3 + i)) + 13)\n\nNow, let's simplify the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2(w + (3 + i)) + 4i = 2w + 6 + 2i + 4i = 2w + 6 + 6i\nDenominator: (w + (3 + i))^2 + 6(w + (3 + i)) + 13\n\nExpanding the denominator, we get:\n\n(w^2 + 2(3 + i)w + (3 + i)^2) + 6(w + (3 + i)) + 13\n\nNow, let's simplify the terms:\n\n(w^2 + 6w + 6iw + 9 + 6i + i^2) + 6w + 18 + 6i + 13\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can further simplify:\n\n(w^2 + 6w - 1 + 6iw + 9 + 6i) + 6w + 18 + 6i + 13\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n(w^2 + 12w + 6iw + 6i + 39)\n\nNow, we have:\n\nf(z) = (2w + 6 + 6i) / (w^2 + 12w + 6iw + 6i + 39)\n\nTo find the Laurent series expansion, we can use partial fraction decomposition. However, in this case, the denominator does not factor into simpler terms, and there are no poles in the function. Therefore, the Laurent series expansion does not exist for this function about the point z = 3 + i.\n\nSince there is no Laurent series expansion, we cannot find the residue of f(z) at z = 3 + i."
