    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x^2 + 3x - 1\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 3, and c = -1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-3 ± √(3^2 - 4(2)(-1))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (-3 ± √(9 + 8)) / 4\n\nx = (-3 ± √17) / 4\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = (-3 + √17) / 4 and x = (-3 - √17) / 4.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 2(0)^2 + 3(0) - 1\n\ny = -1\n\nSo, the y-intercept is y = -1.\n\nIn summary, the x-intercepts are x = (-3 + √17) / 4 and x = (-3 - √17) / 4, and the y-intercept is y = -1."
