    "message_2": "To show that f is continuous, we need to show that the preimage of every open set in Y is open in X.\n\nSince Y has the trivial topology, its open sets are the empty set Ø and Y itself.\n\nCase 1: Consider the open set Ø in Y. The preimage of Ø under f, denoted by f^(-1)(Ø), is also the empty set Ø, since no element in X can be mapped to an element in Ø. Since Ø is an open set in the discrete topology on X, f^(-1)(Ø) is open in X.\n\nCase 2: Consider the open set Y in Y. Since f is a function from X to Y, every element in X must be mapped to an element in Y. Therefore, the preimage of Y under f, denoted by f^(-1)(Y), is the entire set X. Since X is an open set in the discrete topology on X, f^(-1)(Y) is open in X.\n\nIn both cases, the preimage of the open sets in Y is open in X. Therefore, the function f is continuous."
