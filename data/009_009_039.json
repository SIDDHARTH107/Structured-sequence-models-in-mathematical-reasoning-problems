    "message_1": "A particle is moving in a one-dimensional box with a length of 2 nm. The wave function of the particle is given as: \n\nΨ(x, t) = A sin(πx/L)e^((-iE/ħ)t)\n\nwhere A = 1.5 nm^(-1/2), E = 3 eV, L = 2 nm, t = 0, and x is the position of the particle. \n\nFind the normalized probability density function of the particle at x = 1 nm.",
    "message_2": "To find the normalized probability density function, we first need to find the probability density function, which is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function: \n\nP(x, t) = |Ψ(x, t)|^2\n\nSince t = 0, the exponential term e^((-iE/ħ)t) becomes 1. Therefore, the wave function at t = 0 is:\n\nΨ(x, 0) = A sin(πx/L)\n\nNow, we can find the probability density function:\n\nP(x, 0) = |Ψ(x, 0)|^2 = (A sin(πx/L))^2\n\nGiven A = 1.5 nm^(-1/2) and L = 2 nm, we can now find the probability density function at x = 1 nm:\n\nP(1 nm, 0) = (1.5 sin(π(1 nm)/(2 nm)))^2\nP(1 nm, 0) = (1.5 sin(π/2))^2\nP(1 nm, 0) = (1.5 * 1)^2\nP(1 nm, 0) = 2.25\n\nSo, the normalized probability density function of the particle at x = 1 nm is 2.25."
