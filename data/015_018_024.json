    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and frequency of the steady-state oscillation, we first need to find the steady-state solution of the given Duffing oscillator equation. The given equation is:\n\nx'' + 2λx' - x + x^3 = f cos(ωt)\n\nwhere λ = 0.1, ω = 1, and f = 1.\n\nFor the steady-state solution, we assume a solution of the form:\n\nx(t) = A cos(ωt - δ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, ω is the frequency, and δ is the phase shift. Now, we need to find the first and second derivatives of x(t) with respect to time t:\n\nx'(t) = -Aω sin(ωt - δ)\nx''(t) = -Aω^2 cos(ωt - δ)\n\nNow, substitute x(t), x'(t), and x''(t) into the given equation:\n\n-Aω^2 cos(ωt - δ) + 2λ(-Aω sin(ωt - δ)) - A cos(ωt - δ) + A^3 cos^3(ωt - δ) = cos(ωt)\n\nNow, we equate the coefficients of cos(ωt - δ) and sin(ωt - δ) on both sides of the equation:\n\nFor cos(ωt - δ):\n\n-Aω^2 - A + A^3 cos^2(ωt - δ) = 1\n\nFor sin(ωt - δ):\n\n2λAω = 0\n\nSince λ ≠ 0 and ω ≠ 0, the second equation implies that A = 0, which is a trivial solution (no oscillation). However, we are interested in the non-trivial solution. In this case, we need to use numerical methods to find the amplitude A and phase shift δ for the given Duffing oscillator equation.\n\nUnfortunately, as a language model AI, I am unable to perform numerical simulations. However, you can use numerical methods like the Runge-Kutta method or other numerical solvers to find the amplitude A and phase shift δ for the given Duffing oscillator equation. Once you have the amplitude A and phase shift δ, the steady-state oscillation will be given by:\n\nx(t) = A cos(ωt - δ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude and ω is the frequency of the steady-state oscillation."
