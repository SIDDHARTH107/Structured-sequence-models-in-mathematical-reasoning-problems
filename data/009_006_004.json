    "message_1": "Sure, here is a numerical problem:\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is given by the differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k [A]^2$\n\nwhere [A] is the concentration of the reactant A at time t, and k is a constant rate constant. The initial concentration of A, [A]$_0$ = 2 mol/L. Determine [A] after 5 minutes if k = 0.01 L/mol/min.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the given differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k [A]^2$\n\nFirst, let's separate the variables:\n\n$\\frac{d[A]}{[A]^2} = -k dt$\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides:\n\n$\\int \\frac{d[A]}{[A]^2} = \\int -k dt$\n\nThe integral of $\\frac{1}{[A]^2}$ with respect to [A] is $-\\frac{1}{[A]}$, and the integral of $-k$ with respect to $t$ is $-kt$. So we have:\n\n$-\\frac{1}{[A]} = -kt + C$\n\nNow, we need to find the constant of integration, C. We know that at t = 0, [A] = [A]$_0$ = 2 mol/L. Plugging these values into the equation:\n\n$-\\frac{1}{2} = -k(0) + C$\n\n$-\\frac{1}{2} = C$\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation with the constant C:\n\n$-\\frac{1}{[A]} = -kt - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nWe want to find [A] after 5 minutes, so we'll plug in t = 5 and k = 0.01 L/mol/min:\n\n$-\\frac{1}{[A]} = -0.01(5) - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$-\\frac{1}{[A]} = -0.05 - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$-\\frac{1}{[A]} = -\\frac{6}{10}$\n\nNow, we can solve for [A]:\n\n$[A] = -\\frac{1}{-\\frac{6}{10}}$\n\n$[A] = \\frac{10}{6}$\n\n$[A] = \\frac{5}{3}$\n\nSo, the concentration of A after 5 minutes is [A] = $\\frac{5}{3}$ mol/L."
