    "message_2": "To compute the integral of f(z) over C, we can use the Cauchy's integral formula. The Cauchy's integral formula states that for a function f(z) that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C, and for any point a inside C, we have:\n\n∫(f(z)/(z-a))dz = 2πif(a)\n\nIn our case, f(z) = (z-i)/(z^2+1), and C is the unit circle centered at the origin. We can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = (z-i)/((z-i)(z+i))\n\nNow, we can see that f(z) has a simple pole at z = i, which is inside the contour C. Therefore, we can apply the Cauchy's integral formula with a = i:\n\n∫(f(z)/(z-i))dz = 2πif(i)\n\nTo find f(i), we plug in i into the function f(z):\n\nf(i) = (i-i)/((i-i)(i+i)) = 0\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the Cauchy's integral formula:\n\n∫(f(z)/(z-i))dz = 2πi(0) = 0\n\nSo, the integral of f(z) over the contour C is 0."
