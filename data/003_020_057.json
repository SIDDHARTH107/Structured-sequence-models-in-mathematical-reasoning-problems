    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of the pole is 54 degrees. If the flagpole is 20 meters tall, what is the distance from the point on the ground to the base of the flagpole?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle is 54 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the flagpole (20 meters), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the point on the ground to the base of the flagpole, which we'll call \"x\".\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(54°) = 20 / x\n\nTo find the value of x, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nx = 20 / tan(54°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 54 degrees:\n\ntan(54°) ≈ 1.3764\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nx ≈ 20 / 1.3764\n\nx ≈ 14.52\n\nSo, the distance from the point on the ground to the base of the flagpole is approximately 14.52 meters."
