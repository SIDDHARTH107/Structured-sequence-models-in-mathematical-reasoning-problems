    "message_2": "Kuratowski's Theorem states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 3+3 vertices).\n\nTo determine if G is planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, v = 10 and e = 13. We need to find the maximum number of faces, f, that G can have.\n\nA planar graph can have at most 3v - 6 edges (for v > 2). In our case, this gives:\n\n3 * 10 - 6 = 30 - 6 = 24\n\nSince 13 edges are less than the maximum 24 edges allowed for a planar graph with 10 vertices, it is possible that G is planar. However, we still need to check for the presence of K5 or K3,3 subdivisions.\n\nFor a graph to have a K5 subdivision, it must have at least 5 vertices with a degree of 4 or more. In our case, the maximum degree sum for a graph with 10 vertices and 13 edges is:\n\n2 * 13 = 26\n\nIf we distribute the degrees among the vertices, we can have at most 4 vertices with a degree of 4, and the remaining 6 vertices with a degree of 3. This means that G cannot have a K5 subdivision.\n\nFor a graph to have a K3,3 subdivision, it must have at least 6 vertices with a degree of 3 or more. In our case, we have 6 vertices with a degree of 3, which is the minimum requirement for a K3,3 subdivision. However, having 6 vertices with a degree of 3 or more does not guarantee the presence of a K3,3 subdivision.\n\nSince we cannot conclusively determine the presence of a K3,3 subdivision, we cannot definitively say whether G is planar or not based on the given information. Further analysis of the specific graph structure would be needed to determine its planarity."
