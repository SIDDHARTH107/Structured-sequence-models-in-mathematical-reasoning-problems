The distances between these cities are as follows: \n\n- City 1 to City 2: 5 km\n- City 1 to City 3: 9 km\n- City 1 to City 4: 7 km\n- City 1 to City 5: 8 km\n- City 2 to City 3: 4 km\n- City 2 to City 4: 3 km\n- City 2 to City 5: 6 km\n- City 3 to City 4: 2 km\n- City 3 to City 5: 5 km\n- City 4 to City 5: 3 km\n\nWhat is the shortest possible route that the salesman can take to visit all the cities exactly once and then return to the starting city?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible route, we can use the brute force method by listing all possible routes and calculating their total distances. Since there are 5 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) possible routes. However, since the route is a cycle, we can divide this number by 5, resulting in 4! (4 factorial) = 24 unique routes to consider. Here are the routes and their total distances:\n\n1. 1-2-3-4-5-1: 5+4+2+3+8 = 22 km\n2. 1-2-3-5-4-1: 5+4+5+3+7 = 24 km\n3. 1-2-4-3-5-1: 5+3+2+5+8 = 23 km\n4. 1-2-4-5-3-1: 5+3+3+5+9 = 25 km\n5. 1-2-5-3-4-1: 5+6+5+2+7 = 25 km\n6. 1-2-5-4-3-1: 5+6+3+2+9 = 25 km\n7. 1-3-2-4-5-1: 9+4+3+3+8 = 27 km\n8. 1-3-2-5-4-1: 9+4+6+3+7 = 29 km\n9. 1-3-4-2-5-1: 9+2+3+6+8 = 28 km\n10. 1-3-4-5-2-1: 9+2+3+3+5 = 22 km\n11. 1-3-5-2-4-1: 9+5+6+3+7 = 30 km\n12. 1-3-5-4-2-1: 9+5+3+3+5 = 25 km\n13. 1-4-2-3-5-1: 7+3+4+5+8 = 27 km\n14. 1-4-2-5-3-1: 7+3+6+5+9 = 30 km\n15. 1-4-3-2-5-1: 7+2+4+6+8 = 27 km\n16. 1-4-3-5-2-1: 7+2+5+6+5 = 25 km\n17. 1-4-5-2-3-1: 7+3+6+4+9 = 29 km\n18. 1-4-5-3-2-1: 7+3+5+4+5 = 24 km\n19. 1-5-2-3-4-1: 8+6+4+2+7 = 27 km\n20. 1-5-2-4-3-1: 8+6+3+2+9 = 28 km\n21. 1-5-3-2-4-1: 8+5+4+3+7 = 27 km\n22. 1-5-3-4-2-1: 8+5+2+3+5 = 23 km\n23. 1-5-4-2-3-1: 8+3+3+4+9 = 27 km\n24. 1-5-4-3-2-1: 8+3+2+4+5 = 22 km\n\nThe shortest possible route is 1-2-3-4-5-1 or 1-5-4-3-2-1, both with a total distance of 22 km."
