    "message_2": "A cyclic group of order 12 is generated by an element of order 12. Let's call this generator g. The elements of the cyclic group C12 are {1, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6, g^7, g^8, g^9, g^10, g^11}.\n\nA subgroup of order 2 must have two elements: the identity element (1) and an element of order 2. An element x has order 2 if and only if x^2 = 1.\n\nLet's check the elements of C12 to see which ones have order 2:\n\n- g^1: (g^1)^2 = g^2 ≠ 1\n- g^2: (g^2)^2 = g^4 ≠ 1\n- g^3: (g^3)^2 = g^6 = 1 (since 6 is half of 12)\n- g^4: (g^4)^2 = g^8 ≠ 1\n- g^5: (g^5)^2 = g^10 ≠ 1\n- g^6: (g^6)^2 = g^12 = 1 (since 12 is the order of the group)\n- g^7: (g^7)^2 = g^14 = g^2 ≠ 1\n- g^8: (g^8)^2 = g^16 = g^4 ≠ 1\n- g^9: (g^9)^2 = g^18 = g^6 = 1 (since 18 is 6 more than 12)\n- g^10: (g^10)^2 = g^20 = g^8 ≠ 1\n- g^11: (g^11)^2 = g^22 = g^10 ≠ 1\n\nWe found three elements of order 2: g^3, g^6, and g^9. Each of these elements generates a subgroup of order 2:\n\n- {1, g^3}\n- {1, g^6}\n- {1, g^9}\n\nThus, there are 3 subgroups of order 2 in a group of order 12 that is isomorphic to the cyclic group C12."
