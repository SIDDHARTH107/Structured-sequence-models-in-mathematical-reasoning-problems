    "message_2": "To solve the equation |5x + 2| = 18, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 5x + 2 = 18\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n5x = 16\nDivide by 5:\nx = 16/5\n\nCase 2: 5x + 2 = -18\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n5x = -20\nDivide by 5:\nx = -4\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 16/5 and -4."
