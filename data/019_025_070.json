    "message_1": "A company wants to determine if there is a causal relationship between the amount of money spent on advertising and the number of products sold. They collected data over 10 weeks and found that the company spent an average of $500 on advertising per week and sold an average of 150 products per week. Using causal logic, can you determine if there is a significant causal relationship between the two variables? If so, what is the correlation coefficient and what does it indicate?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant causal relationship between the amount of money spent on advertising and the number of products sold, we need more information than just the averages. We need the actual data points for each week to calculate the correlation coefficient.\n\nThe correlation coefficient (r) is a measure of the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, with -1 indicating a strong negative relationship, 1 indicating a strong positive relationship, and 0 indicating no relationship.\n\nIf you can provide the data points for each week, I can calculate the correlation coefficient and help you interpret its meaning in the context of this problem."
