    "message_2": "To find the complex function $f(z)$ that satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations and has $u(x, y) = 5x^2 - 4y^2$ as its real part, we first need to find the imaginary part of the function, $v(x, y)$. \n\nThe Cauchy-Riemann equations are given by:\n\n1) $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$\n\n2) $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$\n\nLet's find the partial derivatives of $u(x, y)$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 10x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -8y$\n\nNow, we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to find the partial derivatives of $v(x, y)$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 10x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 8y$\n\nNow we need to integrate these partial derivatives to find $v(x, y)$:\n\nIntegrate $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 10x$ with respect to $y$:\n\n$v(x, y) = 10xy + g(x)$, where $g(x)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$.\n\nIntegrate $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 8y$ with respect to $x$:\n\n$v(x, y) = 8xy + h(y)$, where $h(y)$ is an arbitrary function of $y$.\n\nComparing these two expressions for $v(x, y)$, we can see that $g(x) = h(y) = 0$, so:\n\n$v(x, y) = 10xy$\n\nNow we can write the complex function $f(z)$ as:\n\n$f(z) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y) = (5x^2 - 4y^2) + i(10xy)$\n\nTo express $f(z)$ in terms of $z$, we can use the fact that $z = x + iy$ and $x = \\frac{z + \\bar{z}}{2}$, $y = \\frac{z - \\bar{z}}{2i}$:\n\n$f(z) = 5\\left(\\frac{z + \\bar{z}}{2}\\right)^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{z - \\bar{z}}{2i}\\right)^2 + 10i\\left(\\frac{z + \\bar{z}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{z - \\bar{z}}{2i}\\right)$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$f(z) = 5\\left(\\frac{z^2 + 2z\\bar{z} + \\bar{z}^2}{4}\\right) - 4\\left(\\frac{z^2 - 2z\\bar{z} + \\bar{z}^2}{-4}\\right) + 10\\left(\\frac{z^2 - \\bar{z}^2}{2}\\right)$\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{5}{4}z^2 + 2z\\bar{z} + \\frac{5}{4}\\bar{z}^2 + z^2 - 2z\\bar{z} + \\bar{z}^2 + 5z^2 - 5\\bar{z}^2$\n\n$f(z) = (5z^2 + 5\\bar{z}^2) + 10i(xy)$\n\nThus, the complex function $f(z)$ that satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations and has $u(x, y) = 5x^2 - 4y^2$ as its real part is:\n\n$f(z) = 5z^2 + 5\\bar{z}^2$"
