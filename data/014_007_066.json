    "message_1": "Suppose you have a binary key stream of length 8 and a plaintext of length 12, where the plaintext is represented in ASCII code. Use the XOR operation to encrypt the plaintext with the key stream. Show the resulting ciphertext in binary and in ASCII code.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need the binary key stream and the plaintext in ASCII code. Since you didn't provide them, I'll create an example for you.\n\nLet's say the binary key stream is: 10100101\nAnd the plaintext is: \"plaintext\"\n\nFirst, we need to convert the plaintext into binary using ASCII code:\np: 01110000\nl: 01101100\na: 01100001\ni: 01101001\nn: 01101110\nt: 01110100\ne: 01100101\nx: 01111000\nt: 01110100\n\nSince the plaintext is 12 characters long and the key stream is 8 bits long, we need to repeat the key stream to match the length of the plaintext. So, the extended key stream would be:\n\n10100101 10100101 10100101 10100101 10100101 10100101 10100101 10100101 10100101 10100101 10100101 10100101\n\nNow, we perform the XOR operation between the binary plaintext and the extended key stream:\n\n01110000 ⊕ 10100101 = 11010101 (D)\n01101100 ⊕ 10100101 = 11001001 (É)\n01100001 ⊕ 10100101 = 11000100 (Ä)\n01101001 ⊕ 10100101 = 11001100 (Ì)\n01101110 ⊕ 10100101 = 11001011 (Ë)\n01110100 ⊕ 10100101 = 11010001 (Ñ)\n01100101 ⊕ 10100101 = 11000000 (À)\n01111000 ⊕ 10100101 = 11011101 (Ý)\n01110100 ⊕ 10100101 = 11010001 (Ñ)\n\nThe resulting ciphertext in binary is:\n11010101 11001001 11000100 11001100 11001011 11010001 11000000 11011101 11010001\n\nAnd the resulting ciphertext in ASCII code is:\nDÉÄÌËÑÀÝÑ\n\nPlease note that the example I used is arbitrary, and the actual ciphertext will depend on the specific binary key stream and plaintext you are working with."
