The cost of laying a cable between each pair of offices is given in the following table:\n\n|  Offices | A | B | C | D | E |\n|----------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A        | 0 | 1 | 5 | 6 | 3 |\n| B        | 1 | 0 | 4 | 2 | 7 |\n| C        | 5 | 4 | 0 | 3 | 8 |\n| D        | 6 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 5 |\n| E        | 3 | 7 | 8 | 5 | 0 |\n\nFind the minimum cost of connecting all the offices using the minimum spanning tree algorithm.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of connecting all the offices using the minimum spanning tree algorithm, we will use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we list all the edges in increasing order of their weights:\n\n1. A-B (1)\n2. B-D (2)\n3. A-E (3)\n4. C-D (3)\n5. B-C (4)\n6. D-E (5)\n7. A-C (5)\n8. E-C (8)\n9. B-E (7)\n\nNow, we will add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure not to create any cycles:\n\n1. Add edge A-B (1)\n2. Add edge B-D (2)\n3. Add edge A-E (3) (Adding C-D would also work here, but we'll choose A-E for this solution)\n4. Add edge C-D (3) (Now all vertices are included in the tree)\n5. We don't need to add any more edges, as all offices are connected.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree has edges A-B, B-D, A-E, and C-D. The total cost is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 9. So, the minimum cost of connecting all the offices is 9."
