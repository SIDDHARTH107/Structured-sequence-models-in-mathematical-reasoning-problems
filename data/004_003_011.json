    "message_2": "Let x be the length of the side of the square base, and let h be the height of the box. The volume V of the box can be expressed as:\n\nV = x^2 * h\n\nSince the volume is given as 12 cubic meters, we have:\n\n12 = x^2 * h\n\nNow we need to minimize the surface area A of the box (since the top is open) to minimize the amount of material needed. The surface area can be expressed as:\n\nA = x^2 + 4xh\n\nWe want to minimize A, so we need to express A in terms of one variable. We can do this by solving the volume equation for h:\n\nh = 12 / x^2\n\nNow substitute this expression for h into the surface area equation:\n\nA = x^2 + 4x(12 / x^2)\n\nA = x^2 + 48 / x\n\nTo minimize A, we can take the derivative of A with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dx = 2x - 48 / x^2\n\nSetting dA/dx to 0:\n\n0 = 2x - 48 / x^2\n\nMultiplying both sides by x^2:\n\n0 = 2x^3 - 48\n\nNow add 48 to both sides and divide by 2:\n\nx^3 = 24\n\nNow take the cube root of both sides:\n\nx = ∛24 ≈ 2.884\n\nSo, the length of the side of the square base should be approximately 2.884 meters to minimize the amount of material needed to construct the box."
