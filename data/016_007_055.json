    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape created by recursively removing cubes from an initial cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the whole structure are removed. This process is repeated for the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nTo find the volume of a Menger sponge after a certain number of iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = a^3 * (1 - (20/27)^n)\n\nwhere a is the side length of the initial cube, and n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the side length (a) is 6, and the number of iterations (n) is 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = 6^3 * (1 - (20/27)^6)\nVolume = 216 * (1 - (20/27)^6)\nVolume ≈ 216 * (1 - 0.026184)\nVolume ≈ 216 * 0.973816\nVolume ≈ 210.304656\n\nSo, the volume of a Menger sponge of side length 6 after 6 iterations is approximately 210.304656 cubic units."
