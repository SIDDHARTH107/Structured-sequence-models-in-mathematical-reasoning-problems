    "message_1": "Suppose X is an algebraic curve of degree 4 in the complex projective plane defined by the homogeneous polynomial equation $F(x,y,z) = x^4+y^4+z^4 - 2(x^2y^2+y^2z^2+z^2x^2)$. Suppose furthermore that we have a line bundle on X whose degree is 3. Use sheaf cohomology to determine whether or not this line bundle is ample.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the line bundle is ample, we will use the following criterion: a line bundle L on a curve X is ample if and only if the degree of L is positive and the dimension of the space of global sections of L is at least 2.\n\nLet L be the line bundle of degree 3 on the curve X. We know that the degree of L is positive, so we need to compute the dimension of the space of global sections of L, denoted by H^0(X, L).\n\nWe will use the Riemann-Roch theorem to compute the dimension of H^0(X, L). The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle L on a curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nFirst, we need to compute the genus g of the curve X. The genus of a curve of degree d in the complex projective plane is given by the formula:\n\ng = (d-1)(d-2)/2\n\nIn our case, d = 4, so the genus is:\n\ng = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3\n\nNow, we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g = 3 + 1 - 3 = 1\n\nSince h^1(X, L) is non-negative, we have h^0(X, L) ≤ 1. However, to show that the line bundle L is ample, we need h^0(X, L) ≥ 2. Therefore, the line bundle L is not ample."
