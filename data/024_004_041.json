    "message_2": "The mean curvature (H) of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:\n\nH = (1/R1 + 1/R2) / 2\n\nwhere R1 and R2 are the principal radii of curvature at the point in question. For a cylinder, one of the principal radii of curvature is the radius of the cylinder (R), and the other is infinite (since the cylinder extends infinitely in the axial direction).\n\nIn this case, the radius of the cylinder is 5 cm. However, we are asked to find the mean curvature at a point where the distance from the axis of the cylinder is 3 cm. This means that we need to consider a smaller cylinder with a radius of 3 cm that is concentric with the original cylinder.\n\nSo, for this smaller cylinder, R1 = 3 cm and R2 = ∞.\n\nNow, we can calculate the mean curvature:\n\nH = (1/3 + 1/∞) / 2\nH = (1/3 + 0) / 2\nH = 1/6\n\nThe mean curvature at a point on the surface where the distance from the axis of the cylinder is 3 cm is 1/6 cm^(-1)."
