    "message_1": "What is the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set, which is generated by the quadratic polynomial f(z) = z^2 + c, where c = -0.75 and z starts at 0?",
    "message_2": "The main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is the largest connected region in the set, and it has a shape similar to a heart. The area of the main cardioid can be found using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * π * (p^2)\n\nwhere p is the radius of the cardioid. In the case of the Mandelbrot set, the radius of the main cardioid is 1/4. Therefore, the area of the main cardioid is:\n\nArea = (1/2) * π * (1/4)^2\nArea = (1/2) * π * (1/16)\nArea = π/32\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is π/32 or approximately 0.09817477042."
