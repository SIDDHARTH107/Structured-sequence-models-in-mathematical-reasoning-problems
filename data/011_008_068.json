    "message_1": "A group of 7 friends wants to take a picture together. If they arrange themselves in a row, how many possible ways can they do so?\nHint: Use Stirling numbers of the second kind to solve it.",
    "message_2": "The hint provided is not applicable to this problem. Stirling numbers of the second kind are used for partitioning a set into non-empty subsets, which is not the case here.\n\nInstead, we can solve this problem using a simple permutation formula. Since there are 7 friends and they can be arranged in a row, there are 7! (7 factorial) ways to do so.\n\n7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040\n\nSo, there are 5040 possible ways for the 7 friends to arrange themselves in a row for a picture."
