    "message_2": "A power set is the set of all subsets of a set, including the empty set and the set itself. The size of a power set can be calculated using the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the original set.\n\nIn this case, the set A has 4 elements, so the size of A's power set is 2^4 = 16.\n\nNow, to prove that the power set of A is larger than A itself, we can compare their sizes. The size of A is 4, and the size of the power set of A is 16. Since 16 > 4, the power set of A is larger than A itself."
