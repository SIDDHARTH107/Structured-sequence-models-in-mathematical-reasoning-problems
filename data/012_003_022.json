    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. To find the maximum independent set, we want to find the largest set of vertices that do not share an edge.\n\nIn this graph, one possible maximum independent set is {A, E, C}. Another possible maximum independent set is {B, D, F}. Both of these sets have 3 vertices, and no two vertices in each set are adjacent.\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set in this graph is 3."
