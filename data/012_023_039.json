    "message_1": "In a graph G, the clique number is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in G. If G has 10 vertices and its clique number is 3, how many different 3-vertex subsets of vertices in G satisfy the property that they form a complete subgraph (clique) in G?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of 3-vertex cliques in the graph G as C. Since G has a clique number of 3, there are no complete subgraphs with more than 3 vertices. We are asked to find the value of C.\n\nTo form a 3-vertex clique, we need to choose 3 vertices from the 10 vertices in G such that all 3 vertices are connected to each other. The number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 10 vertices is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10 - 3)!) = 10! / (3! * 7!) = 120\n\nHowever, this value represents the total number of 3-vertex subsets without considering whether they form a complete subgraph (clique) or not. Since we know that the clique number of G is 3, there must be at least one 3-vertex clique in G. Let's assume there are C such cliques.\n\nNow, let's consider the complementary graph G', which is a graph with the same vertices as G but with the edges reversed (i.e., two vertices are connected in G' if and only if they are not connected in G). In G', a 3-vertex subset that forms an independent set (i.e., no two vertices are connected) corresponds to a 3-vertex clique in G.\n\nThe problem now becomes finding the number of 3-vertex independent sets in G'. Since G has a clique number of 3, G' has an independence number of 3 (i.e., the size of the largest independent set in G' is 3). This means that there are no independent sets with more than 3 vertices in G'.\n\nLet's denote the number of 3-vertex independent sets in G' as I. We know that the sum of the number of cliques and independent sets in a graph and its complementary graph is equal to the total number of 3-vertex subsets:\n\nC + I = 120\n\nSince we are interested in finding the value of C, we need to find the value of I. To do this, we can use the fact that the independence number of G' is 3. This means that there are at least 1 and at most 120 - 1 = 119 independent sets of size 3 in G'. However, without more information about the structure of G or G', we cannot determine the exact value of I and, consequently, the exact value of C.\n\nIn conclusion, the number of different 3-vertex subsets of vertices in G that form a complete subgraph (clique) in G is at least 1 and at most 119, but we cannot determine the exact value without more information about the graph G."
