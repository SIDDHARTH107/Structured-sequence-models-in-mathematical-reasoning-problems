    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, if we raise a to the power of p and divide by p, the remainder is a.\n\nIn our case, p = 7 (which is a prime number) and a = 3. According to Fermat's Little Theorem, 3^7 ≡ 3 (mod 7).\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 3^23 is divided by 7. We can rewrite 3^23 as (3^7)^(3) * 3^2. Since 3^7 ≡ 3 (mod 7), we have:\n\n(3^7)^3 * 3^2 ≡ 3^3 * 3^2 (mod 7)\n\n3^5 ≡ 243 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can find the remainder when 243 is divided by 7:\n\n243 % 7 = 5\n\nSo, the remainder when 3 to the power of 23 is divided by 7 is 5."
