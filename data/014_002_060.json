Alice chooses a secret number a=6 and Bob chooses a secret number b=15. They agree to use a primitive root g=2. What is the shared secret key K?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key K using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g is the primitive root, a is Alice's secret number, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret number.\n3. Alice computes K = B^a mod p.\n4. Bob computes K = A^b mod p.\n\nLet's calculate the shared secret key K:\n\n1. Alice computes A = 2^6 mod 23 = 64 mod 23 = 18.\n2. Bob computes B = 2^15 mod 23 = 32768 mod 23 = 12.\n3. Alice computes K = 12^6 mod 23 = 2985984 mod 23 = 2.\n4. Bob computes K = 18^15 mod 23 = 3.8742e+17 mod 23 = 2.\n\nThe shared secret key K is 2."
