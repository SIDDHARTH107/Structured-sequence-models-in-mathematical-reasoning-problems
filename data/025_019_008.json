    "message_2": "The degree of a hypersurface is the degree of the defining polynomial. In this case, the hypersurface is of dimension 3 and degree 5, which means it is defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5 in the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4$. Therefore, the degree of the hypersurface is 5."
