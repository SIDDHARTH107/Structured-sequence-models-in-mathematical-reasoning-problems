    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 10 meters and one leg of length 8 meters. Find the length of the other leg.",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the length of the unknown leg \"a\" and the length of the given leg \"b\" (8 meters). The hypotenuse is \"c\" (10 meters).\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem formula is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nWe know the values of b and c, so we can plug them into the formula:\n\na^2 + 8^2 = 10^2\n\na^2 + 64 = 100\n\nNow, we need to solve for a:\n\na^2 = 100 - 64\na^2 = 36\n\nTo find the value of a, we take the square root of both sides:\n\na = âˆš36\na = 6\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 6 meters."
