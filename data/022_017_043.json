    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation y'' + 4y = sin(2x), we first find the complementary solution (homogeneous solution) and then find a particular solution.\n\n1. Complementary solution:\nThe homogeneous equation is y'' + 4y = 0. The characteristic equation is r^2 + 4 = 0, which has roots r = Â±2i. So, the complementary solution is:\n\ny_c(x) = A cos(2x) + B sin(2x)\n\n2. Particular solution:\nWe guess a particular solution of the form F(x) = Cx cos(2x) + Dx sin(2x), where C and D are constants to be determined.\n\nNow, we find the first and second derivatives of F(x):\n\nF'(x) = C(1 - 2x sin(2x)) + D(2x cos(2x) + sin(2x))\nF''(x) = -4Cx cos(2x) - 4Dx sin(2x) - 4C sin(2x) + 4D cos(2x)\n\nSubstitute F''(x) and F(x) into the given differential equation:\n\n-4Cx cos(2x) - 4Dx sin(2x) - 4C sin(2x) + 4D cos(2x) + 4(Cx cos(2x) + Dx sin(2x)) = sin(2x)\n\nComparing the coefficients of cos(2x) and sin(2x), we get:\n\n-4C + 4D = 0\n-4D + 4C = 1\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find C = 1/8 and D = 1/8. So, the particular solution is:\n\nF(x) = (1/8)x cos(2x) + (1/8)x sin(2x)\n\n3. General solution:\nThe general solution is the sum of the complementary and particular solutions:\n\ny(x) = A cos(2x) + B sin(2x) + (1/8)x cos(2x) + (1/8)x sin(2x)\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 2 = A\ny'(0) = 3 = B\n\nSo, the final solution is:\n\ny(x) = 2 cos(2x) + 3 sin(2x) + (1/8)x cos(2x) + (1/8)x sin(2x)"
