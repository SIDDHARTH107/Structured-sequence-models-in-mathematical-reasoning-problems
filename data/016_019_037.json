    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The Koch curve is generated by dividing a straight line into three equal parts and replacing the middle part with two sides of an equilateral triangle of the same length. This process is repeated for each new segment in the curve for each iteration.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of the Koch curve is 4/3 times the original length. After each subsequent iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by 4/3 again.\n\nSo, after the 5th iteration, the length of one side of the Koch island is:\n\n(4/3)^5 = 1024/243 ≈ 4.217\n\nSince the Koch island is an equilateral triangle, the total perimeter is three times the length of one side:\n\nPerimeter = 3 × 4.217 ≈ 12.651"
