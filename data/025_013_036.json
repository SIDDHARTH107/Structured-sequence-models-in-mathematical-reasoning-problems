    "message_2": "To find the order of the point $P(3, \\sqrt{22})$ on the elliptic curve $E:y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10$, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $nP = O$, where $O$ is the point at infinity.\n\nWe will use the double-and-add algorithm to compute multiples of $P$. First, we need to find the tangent line at $P$. The slope of the tangent line is given by the derivative of the curve with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3x^2 + 7}{2y}$$\n\nAt point $P(3, \\sqrt{22})$, the slope is:\n\n$$m = \\frac{3(3)^2 + 7}{2\\sqrt{22}} = \\frac{34}{2\\sqrt{22}} = \\frac{17}{\\sqrt{22}}$$\n\nNow, we find the intersection of the tangent line with the curve. The equation of the tangent line is:\n\n$$y - \\sqrt{22} = m(x - 3)$$\n\nSubstituting this into the curve equation:\n\n$$(y - \\sqrt{22})^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n$$x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x - 22 = 0$$\n\nWe know that $x = 3$ is a solution (since the tangent line intersects the curve at $P$). Using synthetic division, we can find the other two solutions:\n\n$$x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x - 22 = (x - 3)(x^2 - 3x + 22)$$\n\nThe quadratic factor has no rational roots, so the tangent line intersects the curve at a single point $P$. Therefore, $2P = O$, and the order of $P$ is 2.\n\nNow, we compute the divisor $div(P) - div(O)$. Since $P$ has order 2, $div(P) = [P] - [O]$. Therefore, $div(P) - div(O) = [P] - [O] - ([P] - [O]) = [O] - [O] = 0$.\n\nSo, the divisor $div(P) - div(O)$ is 0."
