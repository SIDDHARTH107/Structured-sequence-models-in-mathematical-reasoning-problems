    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall. The ladder's bottom is 6 meters from the wall and the ladder's top is 8 meters up the wall. How long is the ladder?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem, as it involves a right triangle with the ladder as the hypotenuse, the distance from the wall as one leg, and the height up the wall as the other leg. The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b):\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nIn this case, a = 6 meters (distance from the wall) and b = 8 meters (height up the wall). Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nc^2 = 6^2 + 8^2\nc^2 = 36 + 64\nc^2 = 100\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the ladder (c):\n\nc = âˆš100\nc = 10 meters\n\nSo, the ladder is 10 meters long."
