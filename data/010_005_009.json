    "message_2": "To prove that A U B is connected, we will use the following theorem:\n\nTheorem: Let X be a topological space, and suppose that A and B are two connected subsets of X such that A ∩ B is non-empty. Then A U B is connected.\n\nProof: Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that A U B is not connected. Then there exist two non-empty open sets U and V in X such that:\n\n1. A U B ⊆ U ∪ V\n2. (A U B) ∩ U ≠ ∅ and (A U B) ∩ V ≠ ∅\n3. (A U B) ∩ (U ∩ V) = ∅\n\nNow, since A and B are connected, we have:\n\nA ⊆ U or A ⊆ V (since if A were to intersect both U and V, A would be disconnected)\nB ⊆ U or B ⊆ V (for the same reason as above)\n\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V. Now, since A ∩ B is non-empty, there exists an element x ∈ A ∩ B. But then x ∈ U (since A ⊆ U) and x ∈ V (since B ⊆ V), which implies x ∈ U ∩ V. This contradicts the fact that (A U B) ∩ (U ∩ V) = ∅.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that A U B is not connected must be false, and so A U B is connected.\n\nNow, let's apply this theorem to the given problem:\n\nLet X be a topological space with two connected subsets A = [0,1] and B = (1,2]. We want to find the union A U B and determine if it is connected or not.\n\nFirst, let's find the union A U B:\n\nA U B = [0,1] ∪ (1,2] = [0,2]\n\nNow, we need to check if A ∩ B is non-empty. Since A and B share the endpoint 1, we have:\n\nA ∩ B = {1}\n\nSince A ∩ B is non-empty, we can apply the theorem we proved earlier. Therefore, A U B = [0,2] is connected."
