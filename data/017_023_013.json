Determine the divisors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n3. Use the formula for the number of abelian groups of order n: n(G) = p(n) * p(n-1) * ... * p(1), where p(n) is the number of partitions of n.\n\nFor the abelian groups, we have:\n\n- G1: C_72 (cyclic group of order 72)\n- G2: C_36 x C_2\n- G3: C_24 x C_3\n- G4: C_18 x C_4\n- G5: C_12 x C_6\n- G6: C_9 x C_8\n- G7: C_9 x C_4 x C_2\n- G8: C_6 x C_4 x C_3\n\nThere are 8 abelian groups.\n\nFor the non-abelian groups, we have:\n\n- G9: S_3 x C_4 x C_3 (semi-direct product)\n- G10: S_3 x C_6 x C_2 (semi-direct product)\n- G11: S_3 x C_9 x C_2 (semi-direct product)\n- G12: S_3 x C_12 x C_2 (semi-direct product)\n- G13: S_3 x C_18 x C_2 (semi-direct product)\n- G14: S_3 x C_36 x C_2 (semi-direct product)\n\nThere are 6 non-abelian groups.\n\nIn total, there are 8 abelian groups + 6 non-abelian groups = 14 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
