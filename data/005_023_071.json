    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n58, 61, 63, 67, 72, 75, 79, 82, 87, 95\n\nNext, we find the median (Q2), lower quartile (Q1), and upper quartile (Q3).\n\nSince there are 10 data points, the median is the average of the 5th and 6th values:\n(Q2) = (72 + 75) / 2 = 73.5\n\nThe lower quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half of the data (excluding the median if the number of data points is odd). In this case, the lower half is:\n58, 61, 63, 67, 72\n\nThe median of the lower half is the 3rd value:\n(Q1) = 63\n\nThe upper quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half of the data (excluding the median if the number of data points is odd). In this case, the upper half is:\n75, 79, 82, 87, 95\n\nThe median of the upper half is the 3rd value:\n(Q3) = 82\n\nNow, we calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 82 - 63 = 19\n\nNext, we find the lower and upper bounds for outliers using the factor of 1.5:\nLower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 63 - 1.5 * 19 = 63 - 28.5 = 34.5\nUpper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 82 + 1.5 * 19 = 82 + 28.5 = 110.5\n\nFinally, we check if there are any outliers in the data:\nAll the scores are within the range of 34.5 to 110.5, so there are no outliers in the data using the interquartile range method with a factor of 1.5."
