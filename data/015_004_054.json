    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. In other words, the sequence {z_n} remains bounded, where z_0 = 0 and z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c.\n\nTo find the area of the set of complex numbers that remain bounded under iteration of the Mandelbrot set function up to 10 iterations, we can approximate the area using a numerical method such as the Monte Carlo method.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is contained within a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. Therefore, we can generate random complex numbers within this circle and check if they remain bounded after 10 iterations of the function. The ratio of the number of bounded points to the total number of points will give us an estimate of the area of the Mandelbrot set.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the exact area of the Mandelbrot set is not known, and the area will depend on the number of iterations we consider. The more iterations we use, the more accurate our estimate will be, but it will also be more computationally intensive.\n\nIn summary, the area of the set of complex numbers that remain bounded under iteration of the Mandelbrot set function up to 10 iterations can be approximated using numerical methods, but the exact area is not known."
