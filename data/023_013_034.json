Find the temperature at a distance of 50 cm from the heated end of the rod after 5 minutes assuming that the temperature distribution along the rod obeys the heat equation and can be described by the Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat equation and the Fourier transform. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the distance along the rod, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material (copper in this case).\n\nThe solution to the heat equation can be found using the Fourier transform. For a semi-infinite rod with one end kept at a constant temperature, the solution is given by:\n\nT(x, t) = T₀ + (T₁ - T₀) * erf(x / (2 * √(α * t)))\n\nwhere T₀ is the initial temperature of the rod, T₁ is the temperature at the heated end, erf is the error function, and α is the thermal diffusivity of copper.\n\nFor copper, the thermal diffusivity α is approximately 1.11 x 10⁻⁴ m²/s.\n\nGiven the problem statement, we have:\nT₀ = 0°C (assuming the initial temperature of the rod is 0°C)\nT₁ = 100°C\nx = 0.5 m (50 cm)\nt = 5 minutes = 300 seconds\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation to find the temperature at a distance of 50 cm from the heated end after 5 minutes:\n\nT(0.5, 300) = 0 + (100 - 0) * erf(0.5 / (2 * √(1.11 x 10⁻⁴ * 300)))\nT(0.5, 300) = 100 * erf(0.5 / (2 * √(3.33 x 10⁻²)))\nT(0.5, 300) = 100 * erf(0.5 / 0.577)\nT(0.5, 300) = 100 * erf(0.866)\n\nUsing a calculator or a table of error function values, we find that erf(0.866) ≈ 0.801.\n\nTherefore, the temperature at a distance of 50 cm from the heated end after 5 minutes is:\n\nT(0.5, 300) ≈ 100 * 0.801 = 80.1°C"
