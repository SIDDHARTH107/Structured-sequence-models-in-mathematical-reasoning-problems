    "message_2": "Let's first recall what an entire function is. An entire function is a function that is holomorphic (i.e., complex differentiable) on the entire complex plane. Now, we want to find all entire functions $f(z)$ such that for every $|z|=1$, $f(z)$ is a real number.\n\nLet's consider the conjugate function $\\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$. Since $f(z)$ is entire, it has a power series representation:\n\n$$f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$$\n\nwhere $a_n$ are complex coefficients. Now, let's write the power series representation for $\\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$:\n\n$$\\overline{f(\\overline{z})} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\overline{a_n} \\overline{z^n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\overline{a_n} z^{-n}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the function $g(z) = f(z) + \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$:\n\n$$g(z) = f(z) + \\overline{f(\\overline{z})} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n + \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\overline{a_n} z^{-n}$$\n\nNotice that $g(z)$ is also an entire function, as it is the sum of two entire functions. Moreover, when $|z|=1$, we have:\n\n$$g(z) = f(z) + \\overline{f(\\overline{z})} = f(z) + \\overline{f(z)}$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is real for $|z|=1$, we have $f(z) = \\overline{f(z)}$ on the unit circle, and thus $g(z) = 2f(z)$ for $|z|=1$. \n\nNow, let's consider the function $h(z) = f(z) - \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$:\n\n$$h(z) = f(z) - \\overline{f(\\overline{z})} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n - \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\overline{a_n} z^{-n}$$\n\nAgain, $h(z)$ is entire, as it is the difference of two entire functions. Moreover, when $|z|=1$, we have:\n\n$$h(z) = f(z) - \\overline{f(\\overline{z})} = f(z) - \\overline{f(z)} = 0$$\n\nSince $h(z)$ is an entire function that vanishes on the unit circle, by the Identity Theorem, it must vanish everywhere. Thus, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$$\n\nfor all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. This means that $f(z)$ is a real-analytic function, i.e., it can be represented by a power series with real coefficients:\n\n$$f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n$$\n\nwhere $b_n \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for all $n$. Since $f(z)$ is entire and real-analytic, it must be an even function, i.e., $f(z) = f(-z)$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. This implies that all odd-degree terms in the power series representation of $f(z)$ must have zero coefficients. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_{2n} z^{2n}$$\n\nwhere $b_{2n} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for all $n$. This is the general form of an entire function that satisfies the given condition."
