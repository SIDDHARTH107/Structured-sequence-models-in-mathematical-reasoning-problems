    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal that is created by iteratively replacing a straight line segment with two segments, each of which is 1/sqrt(2) times the length of the original segment, and joined at a right angle. \n\nAfter each iteration, the total arc length of the curve increases by a factor of 2/sqrt(2), which is equal to sqrt(2). \n\nIf the original line segment has a length of 1 unit, then after 8 iterations, the total arc length of the Lévy C curve will be:\n\nArc length = Original length * (sqrt(2))^n\nArc length = 1 * (sqrt(2))^8\nArc length = 1 * 2^4\nArc length = 1 * 16\nArc length = 16 units\n\nSo, the total arc length of the Lévy C curve after iterating 8 times is 16 units."
