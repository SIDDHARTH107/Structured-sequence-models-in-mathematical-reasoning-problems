    "message_2": "Since A and B are disjoint closed sets in X, their complements, A^c and B^c, are open sets in X. We will show that there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\nSince A and B are closed and every closed set in X is compact, A and B are compact sets. Now, for each point a in A, we can find an open neighborhood U_a of a and an open neighborhood V_a of B such that U_a ∩ V_a = ∅. This is possible because A and B are disjoint and their complements are open sets.\n\nConsider the open cover {U_a} of A. Since A is compact, there exists a finite subcover {U_a1, U_a2, ..., U_an} of A. Let U = U_a1 ∪ U_a2 ∪ ... ∪ U_an. Then U is an open set containing A.\n\nNow, let V = V_a1 ∩ V_a2 ∩ ... ∩ V_an. Then V is an open set containing B. We claim that U and V are disjoint. Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a point x in U ∩ V. Then x must be in some U_ai and V_ai for some i. But this contradicts the fact that U_ai ∩ V_ai = ∅. Therefore, U and V must be disjoint.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V."
