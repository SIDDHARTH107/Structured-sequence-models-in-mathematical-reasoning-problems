    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures of the surface given by the equation $z = x^2 + y^2$ at the point $(1,1,2)$, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$. Then, the gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n∇f = (2x, 2y)\n\nAt the point $(1,1,2)$, the gradient is:\n\n∇f(1,1) = (2, 2)\n\nNow, let's find the unit normal vector to the surface at the point $(1,1,2)$. The normal vector is given by:\n\nN = (2x, 2y, -1)\n\nAt the point $(1,1,2)$, the normal vector is:\n\nN(1,1) = (2, 2, -1)\n\nThe magnitude of N is:\n\n|N| = √(2^2 + 2^2 + (-1)^2) = √9 = 3\n\nThe unit normal vector is:\n\nn = (2/3, 2/3, -1/3)\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form. The second partial derivatives of $f$ are:\n\nf_xx = 2\nf_yy = 2\nf_xy = 0\n\nThe second fundamental form matrix is:\n\nH = | 2  0 |\n    | 0  2 |\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvalues of the second fundamental form matrix, which are the principal curvatures. The characteristic equation is:\n\n| H - λI | = | 2 - λ  0     |\n                  | 0      2 - λ |\n\n(2 - λ)^2 = 0\n\nλ = 2\n\nSince there is only one distinct eigenvalue, both principal curvatures are equal to 2. Therefore, the principal curvatures of the surface at the point $(1,1,2)$ are 2 and 2."
