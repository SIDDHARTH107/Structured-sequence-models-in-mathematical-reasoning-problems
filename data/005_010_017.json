    "message_1": "Suppose a factory produces light bulbs and the probability of any bulb being defective is 0.05. A quality control inspector selects a sample of 50 bulbs at random from a large shipment. What is the probability that less than 3 bulbs are defective?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective bulbs\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of bulbs in the sample (50 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective bulbs\n- p is the probability of a bulb being defective (0.05 in this case)\n\nWe want to find the probability that less than 3 bulbs are defective, which means we need to find the probability for 0, 1, and 2 defective bulbs and then sum those probabilities.\n\nP(X < 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)\n\nLet's calculate each probability:\n\n1. P(X = 0): This means no defective bulbs in the sample.\nC(50, 0) = 1 (there's only one way to choose 0 items from 50)\nP(X = 0) = 1 * (0.05)^0 * (1-0.05)^(50-0) = 1 * 1 * (0.95)^50 ≈ 0.0000\n\n2. P(X = 1): This means one defective bulb in the sample.\nC(50, 1) = 50 (there are 50 ways to choose 1 item from 50)\nP(X = 1) = 50 * (0.05)^1 * (1-0.05)^(50-1) = 50 * 0.05 * (0.95)^49 ≈ 0.1879\n\n3. P(X = 2): This means two defective bulbs in the sample.\nC(50, 2) = 1225 (there are 1225 ways to choose 2 items from 50)\nP(X = 2) = 1225 * (0.05)^2 * (1-0.05)^(50-2) = 1225 * 0.0025 * (0.95)^48 ≈ 0.3773\n\nNow, let's sum the probabilities:\n\nP(X < 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) ≈ 0.0000 + 0.1879 + 0.3773 ≈ 0.5652\n\nSo, the probability that less than 3 bulbs are defective in the sample of 50 bulbs is approximately 0.5652 or 56.52%."
