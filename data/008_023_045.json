    "message_2": "To find the maximum error in each variable, we can first rewrite the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants:\n\nA = |  2  3 -1 |\n    |  4 -2  1 |\n    |  1  2  3 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 11 |\n    | -7 |\n    | 15 |\n\nNow, let's consider the noisy data. The maximum error in the data is 0.5. This means that each entry in the matrix A and the vector B can have a maximum error of 0.5. Let's denote the error matrices as ΔA and ΔB:\n\nΔA = | Δa11 Δa12 Δa13 |\n     | Δa21 Δa22 Δa23 |\n     | Δa31 Δa32 Δa33 |\n\nΔB = | Δb1 |\n     | Δb2 |\n     | Δb3 |\n\nThe maximum error in each entry of ΔA and ΔB is 0.5. Now, we can write the noisy system of linear equations as:\n\n(A + ΔA) * (X + ΔX) = (B + ΔB)\n\nwhere ΔX is the error in the variables x, y, and z:\n\nΔX = | Δx |\n     | Δy |\n     | Δz |\n\nTo find the maximum error in each variable, we can use the worst-case scenario, where the errors in the matrix A and the vector B are such that they maximize the errors in the variables x, y, and z.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that finding the exact maximum error in each variable is a complex task that usually requires numerical methods and optimization techniques. In this case, we can provide an estimate of the maximum error in each variable by considering the condition number of the matrix A.\n\nThe condition number of a matrix is a measure of how sensitive the solution of a linear system is to small changes in the data. A large condition number indicates that the solution may be highly sensitive to small changes in the data, while a small condition number indicates that the solution is relatively stable.\n\nWe can calculate the condition number of the matrix A using the following formula:\n\ncond(A) = ||A|| * ||A^(-1)||\n\nwhere ||A|| is the matrix norm and A^(-1) is the inverse of the matrix A. The matrix norm can be calculated using various norms, such as the 1-norm, 2-norm (Euclidean norm), or the infinity norm. In this case, we will use the 2-norm.\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find that the condition number of the matrix A is approximately 5.48. This means that the maximum error in the solution can be up to 5.48 times the maximum error in the data.\n\nSince the maximum error in the data is 0.5, the maximum error in the solution can be up to 5.48 * 0.5 = 2.74.\n\nTherefore, the maximum error in each of the three variables x, y, and z is approximately 2.74. Keep in mind that this is an estimate, and the actual maximum error in each variable may be different depending on the specific errors in the matrix A and the vector B."
