    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve, we'll use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x) on the interval [a, b]:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function y = x^(1/2) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(x^(1/2))/dx = (1/2)x^(-1/2)\n\nNow, we'll find the square of the derivative:\n\n(f'(x))^2 = (1/4)x^(-1)\n\nNext, we'll add 1 to the square of the derivative:\n\n1 + (f'(x))^2 = 1 + (1/4)x^(-1)\n\nNow, we'll find the square root of the expression:\n\nsqrt(1 + (f'(x))^2) = sqrt(1 + (1/4)x^(-1))\n\nNow, we'll set up the integral to find the arc length on the interval [0, 4]:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + (1/4)x^(-1)) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use substitution. Let u = 1 + (1/4)x^(-1). Then, du/dx = -(1/4)x^(-2), and dx = -4x^2 du.\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(u) * -4x^2 du\n\nNow, we need to change the limits of integration according to the substitution. When x = 0, u = 1 + (1/4)(0)^(-1) = 1. When x = 4, u = 1 + (1/4)(4)^(-1) = 1 + 1/4 = 5/4.\n\nL = -4 ∫[1, 5/4] u^(1/2) * x^2 du\n\nTo find x^2 in terms of u, we can use the substitution equation:\n\nu = 1 + (1/4)x^(-1) => x^(-1) = 4(u - 1) => x = (4(u - 1))^(-1/2)\n\nNow, we can find x^2:\n\nx^2 = (4(u - 1))^(-1)\n\nNow, we can substitute x^2 back into the integral:\n\nL = -4 ∫[1, 5/4] u^(1/2) * (4(u - 1))^(-1) du\n\nL = -4 ∫[1, 5/4] u^(1/2) / (4(u - 1)) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = -4 [2(u - 1)^(1/2)] [1, 5/4]\n\nL = -8 [(5/4 - 1)^(1/2) - (1 - 1)^(1/2)]\n\nL = -8 [(1/4)^(1/2) - 0]\n\nL = -8 (1/2)\n\nL = -4\n\nSince the arc length cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nL = 4\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^(1/2) from x = 0 to x = 4 is 4."
