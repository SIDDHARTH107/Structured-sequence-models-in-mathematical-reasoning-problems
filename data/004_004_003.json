    "message_2": "To find the exact area bounded by the curve y = x^2 and the x-axis over the interval [1, 4], we will use integration. The area can be found by evaluating the definite integral of the function y = x^2 with respect to x from 1 to 4.\n\nThe integral of x^2 with respect to x is (1/3)x^3. Now we need to evaluate this antiderivative at the bounds 1 and 4:\n\nA = âˆ«(x^2)dx from 1 to 4 = (1/3)x^3 | from 1 to 4\n\nNow, we will substitute the bounds:\n\nA = ((1/3)(4)^3) - ((1/3)(1)^3)\nA = ((1/3)(64)) - ((1/3)(1))\nA = (64/3) - (1/3)\nA = 63/3\n\nSo, the exact area bounded by the curve y = x^2 and the x-axis over the interval [1, 4] is 63/3 square units."
