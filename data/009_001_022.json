    "message_1": "Consider a population of bacteria which grows at a rate proportional to its size, and that is initially 1000. Suppose that after 5 hours, the population has increased by 60%. How long will it take for the population to double in size?",
    "message_2": "Let P(t) be the population of bacteria at time t (in hours). We are given that the growth rate is proportional to the size of the population, which can be represented by the following differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nWe are also given that the initial population is P(0) = 1000, and after 5 hours, the population has increased by 60%, which means P(5) = 1000 + 0.6 * 1000 = 1600.\n\nTo solve the differential equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = k dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\nln(P) = kt + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. To find C, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 1000:\n\nln(1000) = k * 0 + C\nC = ln(1000)\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln(P) = kt + ln(1000)\n\nTo find k, we can use the condition P(5) = 1600:\n\nln(1600) = 5k + ln(1000)\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\nk = (ln(1600) - ln(1000)) / 5\nk ≈ 0.18232\n\nNow we have the equation:\n\nln(P) = 0.18232t + ln(1000)\n\nWe want to find the time it takes for the population to double, i.e., when P(t) = 2000:\n\nln(2000) = 0.18232t + ln(1000)\n\nSolving for t, we get:\n\nt = (ln(2000) - ln(1000)) / 0.18232\nt ≈ 6.93147\n\nSo it will take approximately 6.93 hours for the population to double in size."
