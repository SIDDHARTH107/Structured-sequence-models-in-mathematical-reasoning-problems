    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 7 vertices and the following edge set:\n\n{(1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7)}\n\nDetermine the minimum number of edges that must be removed in order to disconnect the graph into two disconnected components.",
    "message_2": "To disconnect the graph into two disconnected components, we need to find a cut that separates the graph into two parts. In this case, we can look for a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, will result in two disconnected components.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph:\n\n1. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2, 4, and 5.\n2. Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1, 3, and 5.\n3. Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 2, 6, and 7.\n4. Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 1 and 5.\n5. Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1, 2, 4, and 6.\n6. Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 3, 5, and 7.\n7. Vertex 7 is connected to vertices 3 and 6.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that vertex 5 has the most connections (degree 4). If we remove vertex 5 and its incident edges, we will have the following two disconnected components:\n\n1. {1, 2, 3, 4} with edges {(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)}\n2. {6, 7} with edges {(6, 7)}\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph into two disconnected components is 4, which are the edges incident to vertex 5: {(1, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6)}."
