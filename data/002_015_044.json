    "message_1": "A circular track has a radius of 50 meters. What is the perimeter of the track?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (or circumference) of a circular track, we use the formula:\n\nC = 2πr\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 50 meters. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nC = 2π(50)\nC = 100π\n\nUsing the approximate value of π as 3.14159, we can calculate the circumference:\n\nC ≈ 100 × 3.14159\nC ≈ 314.159 meters\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the circular track is approximately 314.159 meters."
