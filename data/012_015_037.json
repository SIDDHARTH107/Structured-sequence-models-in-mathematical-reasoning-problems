    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 10 vertices and 16 edges. Determine whether this graph is connected or disconnected.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph is connected or disconnected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 10, so the minimum number of edges required for the graph to be connected is 10 - 1 = 9 edges.\n\nSince the graph has 16 edges, which is greater than the minimum required number of edges (9), it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, this does not guarantee that the graph is connected, as the edges could be distributed in such a way that the graph remains disconnected.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively determine whether the graph is connected or disconnected."
