    "message_2": "The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors A and B can be found using the formula:\n\n|A x B| = |A| * |B| * sin(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, respectively, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nGiven the magnitudes |A| = 5 and |B| = 7, and the angle θ = 60 degrees, we can find the magnitude of their cross product:\n\nFirst, convert the angle from degrees to radians:\nθ = 60 * (π/180) = π/3 radians\n\nNow, calculate the magnitude of the cross product:\n|A x B| = 5 * 7 * sin(π/3)\n\n|A x B| = 35 * (√3/2)\n\n|A x B| = 35√3/2 ≈ 30.31\n\nSo, the magnitude of the cross product of vectors A and B is approximately 30.31."
