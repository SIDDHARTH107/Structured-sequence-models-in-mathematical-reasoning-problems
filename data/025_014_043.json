    "message_1": "Consider an elliptic curve given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$. Let $P = (-1, 0)$ and $Q = (0, 1)$ be two points on the curve. Find the theta function $\\theta_P(z)$ and $\\theta_Q(z)$ associated with $P$ and $Q$ respectively.",
    "message_2": "To find the theta functions associated with points $P$ and $Q$, we first need to find the Weierstrass $\\wp$-function and its derivative $\\wp'(z)$ associated with the given elliptic curve. The Weierstrass $\\wp$-function satisfies the differential equation:\n\n$(\\wp'(z))^2 = 4\\wp(z)^3 - g_2\\wp(z) - g_3$,\n\nwhere $g_2$ and $g_3$ are the invariants of the elliptic curve. To find $g_2$ and $g_3$, we need to transform the given elliptic curve equation into the Weierstrass normal form:\n\n$y^2 = 4x^3 - g_2x - g_3$.\n\nTo do this, we can perform the following change of variables:\n\n$x = X - \\frac{2}{3}$, $y = Y$.\n\nSubstituting this into the given equation, we get:\n\n$Y^2 = (X - \\frac{2}{3})^3 + 2(X - \\frac{2}{3})^2 + (X - \\frac{2}{3})$.\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we obtain:\n\n$Y^2 = 4X^3 - \\frac{20}{3}X - \\frac{32}{27}$.\n\nNow we can read off the invariants:\n\n$g_2 = \\frac{20}{3}$, $g_3 = \\frac{32}{27}$.\n\nNext, we need to find the periods of the elliptic curve. Since we are given two points $P$ and $Q$, we can use their coordinates to find the half-periods $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$. Recall that the Weierstrass $\\wp$-function has the property that:\n\n$\\wp(z + \\omega_i) = \\wp(z)$, $i = 1, 2$.\n\nUsing the addition formula for the Weierstrass $\\wp$-function, we can find the half-periods by solving the following system of equations:\n\n$\\wp(\\omega_1) = x_P + \\frac{2}{3}$, $\\wp(\\omega_2) = x_Q + \\frac{2}{3}$,\n\nwhere $x_P = -1$ and $x_Q = 0$ are the $x$-coordinates of points $P$ and $Q$ respectively. Solving this system, we obtain:\n\n$\\omega_1 = \\wp^{-1}(-\\frac{1}{3})$, $\\omega_2 = \\wp^{-1}(\\frac{2}{3})$.\n\nNow we can find the theta functions associated with points $P$ and $Q$. The theta function is defined as:\n\n$\\theta_P(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\pi(n + \\frac{1}{2})^2\\tau} e^{2i\\pi(n + \\frac{1}{2})(z + \\omega_1)}$,\n\n$\\theta_Q(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\pi(n + \\frac{1}{2})^2\\tau} e^{2i\\pi(n + \\frac{1}{2})(z + \\omega_2)}$,\n\nwhere $\\tau = \\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1}$.\n\nIn summary, we have found the invariants $g_2$ and $g_3$, the half-periods $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$, and the theta functions $\\theta_P(z)$ and $\\theta_Q(z)$ associated with points $P$ and $Q$ on the given elliptic curve."
