    "message_2": "To determine the Chern classes $c_1(E)$ and $c_2(E)$, we will first recall some basic facts about the cohomology of the torus $T^2$ and the relationship between the Euler class and the Chern classes.\n\nThe torus $T^2$ can be thought of as the product of two circles, $T^2 = S^1 \\times S^1$. The cohomology ring of the torus is given by $H^*(T^2) = \\mathbb{Z}[x, y]/(x^2, y^2)$, where $x$ and $y$ are the generators of $H^1(T^2)$, and $x^2 = y^2 = 0$ since the torus is a 2-dimensional manifold.\n\nNow, let's consider the Chern classes of the rank 2 vector bundle $E$. The total Chern class is given by $c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E)$. Since $E$ has rank 2, all higher Chern classes are zero. The Euler class of $E$ is related to the Chern classes by the following formula:\n\n$e(E) = c_2(E) - c_1(E)^2$.\n\nIn our case, we are given that $e(E) = 3$. Thus, we have:\n\n$3 = c_2(E) - c_1(E)^2$.\n\nSince $c_1(E)$ and $c_2(E)$ are elements of the cohomology ring $H^*(T^2)$, we know that $c_1(E) = ax + by$ for some integers $a$ and $b$, and $c_2(E) = cxy$ for some integer $c$. Substituting these expressions into the equation above, we get:\n\n$3 = cxy - (ax + by)^2$.\n\nNow, we need to find the integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy this equation. Note that the left-hand side is a 0-dimensional cohomology class, so the right-hand side must also be 0-dimensional. This means that the only possible non-zero term on the right-hand side is the one involving $x^2$ or $y^2$. However, we know that $x^2 = y^2 = 0$, so the equation simplifies to:\n\n$3 = cxy$.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are non-zero elements of the cohomology ring, we must have $c = 3$. Thus, we have found that $c_2(E) = 3xy$. To find $c_1(E)$, we can use the fact that $c_1(E)^2 = c_2(E) - 3$. Since $c_2(E) = 3xy$, we have:\n\n$c_1(E)^2 = 3xy - 3$.\n\nHowever, we know that $x^2 = y^2 = 0$, so the only possible non-zero term on the left-hand side is the one involving $x^2$ or $y^2$. This means that $c_1(E)^2 = 0$, and thus $c_1(E) = 0$.\n\nIn conclusion, the Chern classes of the rank 2 vector bundle $E$ over the torus $T^2$ with Euler class $e(E) = 3$ are given by:\n\n$c_1(E) = 0$ and $c_2(E) = 3xy$."
