    "message_2": "Let's consider the continuous function f: X × X → ℝ defined by f(x, y) = d(x, y), where d(x, y) is the Euclidean distance between points x and y in ℝ². Since X is compact, the function f attains its maximum on X × X. Let M be the maximum distance between any two points in X, i.e., M = max{d(x, y) | x, y ∈ X}. Since d(x, y) = 3, we have M ≥ 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the points x and y with d(x, y) = 3. We will construct a path in X connecting x and y with length at most 3.5.\n\nLet z be a point in X such that d(x, z) = M/2. Since X is connected, there exists a continuous path γ₁: [0, 1] → X connecting x and z, and a continuous path γ₂: [0, 1] → X connecting z and y. Let L₁ and L₂ be the lengths of the paths γ₁ and γ₂, respectively. Then, the length of the path γ₁ followed by γ₂, denoted by L, is given by L = L₁ + L₂.\n\nWe have d(x, z) + d(z, y) ≤ L, since the shortest path between x and y through z is given by the sum of the distances d(x, z) and d(z, y). By the triangle inequality, we have d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y), and thus 3 ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y) ≤ L.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when M/2 < 1.5. Since d(x, z) = M/2, we have d(x, z) < 1.5. Similarly, d(z, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(x, y) < 1.5 + 3 = 4.5. Therefore, L = L₁ + L₂ < 1.5 + 4.5 = 6. However, we know that L ≥ 3, so we have 3 ≤ L < 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when M/2 ≥ 1.5. In this case, we have d(x, z) = M/2 ≥ 1.5. Since d(x, y) = 3, we have d(z, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(x, y) ≤ M/2 + 3. Therefore, L = L₁ + L₂ ≤ M/2 + 3.\n\nSince M ≥ 3, we have M/2 ≥ 1.5, and thus L ≤ M/2 + 3 ≤ 1.5 + 3 = 4.5. However, we know that L ≥ 3, so we have 3 ≤ L ≤ 4.5.\n\nIn both cases, we have 3 ≤ L < 6. Therefore, there exists a path in X connecting x and y with length at most 3.5."
