    "message_1": "Consider the following types:\n\n- A is the type with a single element a.\n- B is the type with 3 elements b1, b2, and b3.\n- C is the type with 2 elements c1 and c2.\n\nDefine a function f that takes two arguments, the first of type A and the second of type (B -> C). What is the total number of possible functions f?",
    "message_2": "Since A has only one element, the first argument of the function f will always be 'a'. The second argument is a function of type (B -> C). There are 3 elements in B and 2 elements in C, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible functions of type (B -> C).\n\nNow, for each of these 8 possible functions of type (B -> C), we can define a function f that takes 'a' as the first argument and one of these 8 functions as the second argument. Therefore, there are 8 possible functions f."
