    "message_2": "Bell numbers are used to count the number of ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets. The Bell number B(n) represents the number of ways to partition a set of n distinct elements.\n\nThe first few Bell numbers are: B(0) = 1, B(1) = 1, B(2) = 2, B(3) = 5, B(4) = 15, B(5) = 52, B(6) = 203, and B(7) = 877.\n\nSo, there are 877 ways to partition a set of 7 distinct elements into non-empty subsets according to Bell numbers."
