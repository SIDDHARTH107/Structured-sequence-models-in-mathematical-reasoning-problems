    "message_1": "A math student needs to make a decision whether to invest in two different mutual funds or not. Fund A has a 30% chance of earning a 10% return, a 50% chance of earning a 5% return, and a 20% chance of earning a 1% return. Fund B has a 60% chance of earning a 4% return and a 40% chance of earning a 2% return. If the student wants to invest at least $10,000 to have a high probability of earning a 6% return, how much should they invest in Fund A and Fund B respectively? Round off your answers to the nearest dollar.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal investment amounts, we need to calculate the expected return for each fund and then find the proportion of the investment that will result in a 6% return.\n\nExpected return for Fund A:\n(0.3 * 10%) + (0.5 * 5%) + (0.2 * 1%) = 3% + 2.5% + 0.2% = 5.7%\n\nExpected return for Fund B:\n(0.6 * 4%) + (0.4 * 2%) = 2.4% + 0.8% = 3.2%\n\nNow, let x be the amount invested in Fund A and y be the amount invested in Fund B. We want to find x and y such that the total investment is at least $10,000 and the expected return is 6%.\n\nx + y >= 10,000\n(5.7% * x) + (3.2% * y) = 6% * (x + y)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the optimal investment amounts.\n\nFirst, we can express y in terms of x:\ny = 10,000 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the second equation:\n(5.7% * x) + (3.2% * (10,000 - x)) = 6% * (x + (10,000 - x))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n0.057x + 0.032(10,000 - x) = 0.06(10,000)\n\n0.057x + 320 - 0.032x = 600\n\nCombine like terms:\n0.025x = 280\n\nNow, solve for x:\nx = 280 / 0.025\nx ≈ 11,200\n\nNow, find y using the expression for y in terms of x:\ny = 10,000 - 11,200\ny ≈ -1,200\n\nSince it's not possible to invest a negative amount, the student should invest the entire $10,000 in Fund A to maximize their expected return. In this case, the expected return would be 5.7%, which is slightly below the desired 6% return. However, this allocation provides the highest possible expected return given the probabilities and returns of the two funds."
