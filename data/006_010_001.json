    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to know the probability of a man over the age of 50 being affected by the disease. Let's call this probability p. Without this information, we cannot calculate the probability of at least 5 men being affected in a random sample of 100 men over the age of 50. \n\nIf you provide the probability p, we can proceed with the calculation."
