    "message_2": "To find the volume of a sphere inscribed in the cube, we first need to find the diameter of the sphere, which is equal to the side length of the cube.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a cube is V = a^3, where V is the volume and a is the side length of the cube. We are given the volume of the cube as 343 cubic units.\n\n343 = a^3\n\nTo find the side length (a), we take the cube root of the volume:\n\na = ∛343\na ≈ 7 units\n\nNow that we have the side length of the cube, we can find the diameter of the inscribed sphere, which is equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 7 units.\n\nThe radius of the sphere is half of the diameter:\n\nr = 7/2\nr = 3.5 units\n\nNow we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is V = (4/3)πr^3:\n\nV = (4/3)π(3.5)^3\nV ≈ (4/3)π(42.875)\nV ≈ 180.96 cubic units\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube is approximately 180.96 cubic units, rounded to two decimal places."
