    "message_2": "First, let's find the complements of A and B. Since A and B are subsets of a universal set U, we need to define U. Let's assume U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} for simplicity.\n\nNow, we can find the complements:\nA^c = U - A = {4, 5}\nB^c = U - B = {1, 2}\n\nNext, we find the intersections:\nA ∩ B^c = {1, 2}\nA^c ∩ B = {4, 5}\n\nNow, we can find the Cartesian product of these intersections:\n(A ∩ B^c) x (A^c ∩ B) = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B:\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nTo find the complement of A x B, we need to find all possible pairs in U x U that are not in A x B:\n(A x B)^c = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n\nNow, we can compare (A ∩ B^c) x (A^c ∩ B) and (A x B)^c:\n(A ∩ B^c) x (A^c ∩ B) = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5)}\n(A x B)^c = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n\nAs we can see, (A ∩ B^c) x (A^c ∩ B) ≠ (A x B)^c. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement."
