    "message_2": "To prove that every group of order 13 is cyclic, we will use the fact that 13 is a prime number. Let G be a group of order 13, and let g be an element of G. Since G has 13 elements, the order of g (denoted as |g|) must divide 13, according to Lagrange's theorem.\n\nSince 13 is a prime number, the only divisors of 13 are 1 and 13. If |g| = 1, then g is the identity element of G. If |g| = 13, then g generates a subgroup of G with 13 elements. But G itself has 13 elements, so this subgroup must be the entire group G.\n\nNow, let's show that there exists an element in G with order 13. We know that G has 13 elements, and one of them is the identity element. The remaining 12 elements must have order 13, because if any of them had order 1, they would be the identity element, which is a contradiction.\n\nSo, there exists an element g in G with order 13. This means that G is generated by g, and therefore G is a cyclic group. In conclusion, every group of order 13 is cyclic."
