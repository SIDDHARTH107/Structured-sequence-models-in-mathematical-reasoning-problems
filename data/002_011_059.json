    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg that is 3 units long and the hypotenuse is 5 units long. How long is the other leg?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the length of the unknown leg b.\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nHere, a = 3 (the known leg), b = the unknown leg, and c = 5 (the hypotenuse).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for b:\n\n3^2 + b^2 = 5^2\n9 + b^2 = 25\n\nNow, subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:\n\nb^2 = 16\n\nFinally, take the square root of both sides:\n\nb = âˆš16\nb = 4\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 4 units."
