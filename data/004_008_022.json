    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point (3, 2), we need to find the derivative of the given equation with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 3.\n\nThe given equation is y = x^2 - 4x + 7.\n\nThe derivative of y with respect to x, denoted as dy/dx or y', is found by differentiating each term in the equation:\n\ny' = d(x^2)/dx - d(4x)/dx + d(7)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\ny' = 2x - 4\n\nNow, we need to evaluate y' at x = 3:\n\ny'(3) = 2(3) - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point (3, 2) is 2."
