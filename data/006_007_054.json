    "message_1": "What is the probability of a certain stock increasing by 10% or more in the next trading day given that the historical data shows that the stock price moves by 5% on average with a standard deviation of 2%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Z-score formula to standardize the 10% increase and then find the probability using the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe Z-score formula is:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for (10% increase), μ is the average (5%), and σ is the standard deviation (2%).\n\nZ = (10 - 5) / 2\nZ = 5 / 2\nZ = 2.5\n\nNow we have the Z-score, which is 2.5. We can use a standard normal distribution table (Z-table) or a calculator to find the probability. The Z-table gives us the probability of a value being less than the given Z-score. Since we want to find the probability of the stock increasing by 10% or more, we need to find the probability of the right tail (greater than 2.5).\n\nP(Z > 2.5) = 1 - P(Z < 2.5)\n\nUsing a Z-table or calculator, we find that P(Z < 2.5) ≈ 0.9938.\n\nP(Z > 2.5) = 1 - 0.9938\nP(Z > 2.5) ≈ 0.0062\n\nSo, the probability of the stock increasing by 10% or more in the next trading day is approximately 0.62%."
