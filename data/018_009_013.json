    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A x B:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A x B) x B:\n\n(A x B) x B = {((1, 3), 3), ((1, 3), 4), ((1, 4), 3), ((1, 4), 4), ((2, 3), 3), ((2, 3), 4), ((2, 4), 3), ((2, 4), 4)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B x B:\n\nB x B = {(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A x (B x B):\n\nA x (B x B) = {(1, (3, 3)), (1, (3, 4)), (1, (4, 3)), (1, (4, 4)), (2, (3, 3)), (2, (3, 4)), (2, (4, 3)), (2, (4, 4))}\n\nNow, we can see that the two Cartesian products are not the same. However, we can show that they are isomorphic, meaning that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two sets.\n\nDefine a function f: (A x B) x B â†’ A x (B x B) as follows:\n\nf(((a, b), c)) = (a, (b, c))\n\nNow, let's apply this function to each element of (A x B) x B:\n\nf(((1, 3), 3)) = (1, (3, 3))\nf(((1, 3), 4)) = (1, (3, 4))\nf(((1, 4), 3)) = (1, (4, 3))\nf(((1, 4), 4)) = (1, (4, 4))\nf(((2, 3), 3)) = (2, (3, 3))\nf(((2, 3), 4)) = (2, (3, 4))\nf(((2, 4), 3)) = (2, (4, 3))\nf(((2, 4), 4)) = (2, (4, 4))\n\nWe can see that the function f maps each element of (A x B) x B to a corresponding element in A x (B x B). Since this function is bijective (one-to-one and onto), we can say that the two sets are isomorphic.\n\nAlthough the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative in general, we have shown that the Cartesian product of A x B and B x B is isomorphic, which means that they have the same structure and can be considered equivalent in certain contexts."
