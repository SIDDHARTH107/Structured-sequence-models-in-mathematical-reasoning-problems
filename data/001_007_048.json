    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 3 > 9, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the inequality:\n   2x + 3 - 3 > 9 - 3\n   2x > 6\n\n2. Divide both sides of the inequality by 2:\n   2x/2 > 6/2\n   x > 3\n\nSo the solution to the inequality is x > 3, which means that any real number greater than 3 will satisfy the inequality."
