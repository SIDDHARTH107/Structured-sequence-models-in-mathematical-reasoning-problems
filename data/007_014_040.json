    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first five perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, 8128, and 33,550,336.\n\nThe sixth perfect number can be found using the formula for even perfect numbers, which is derived from the formula for Mersenne primes: 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1), where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers.\n\nThe first five pairs of (p, 2^p - 1) that produce perfect numbers are:\n(2, 3), (3, 7), (5, 31), (7, 127), and (13, 8191).\n\nThe sixth pair is (17, 131071), as both 17 and 131071 are prime numbers.\n\nUsing the formula, the sixth perfect number is:\n2^(17-1) * (2^17 - 1) = 2^16 * (131071) = 65,536 * 131071 = 8,589,869,056."
