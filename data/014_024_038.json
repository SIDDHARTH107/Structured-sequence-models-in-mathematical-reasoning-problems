    "message_2": "To find the key shift used in a Caesar Cipher, we can compare the positions of the letters in the plaintext message and the ciphertext.\n\nLet's take the first letter of the plaintext message (H) and the first letter of the ciphertext (M). The position of H in the alphabet is 8, and the position of M is 13. The key shift can be found by subtracting the position of the plaintext letter from the position of the ciphertext letter:\n\n13 (M) - 8 (H) = 5\n\nSo, the key shift used in this Caesar Cipher is 5."
