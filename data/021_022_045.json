    "message_1": "A company wants to determine the optimal proportion of two raw materials (A and B) that need to be blended to produce a final product. Material A costs $5 per kg, and material B costs $8 per kg. The final product needs to have at least 25% material A and no more than 40% material B. Using the firefly algorithm, determine the optimal proportion of the two raw materials that will minimize production costs. \n\nAssume that the company needs to produce 1000 kg of the final product and the firefly algorithm needs to run for a maximum of 50 iterations.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the firefly algorithm, we need to define the objective function, constraints, and parameters for the algorithm. \n\nObjective function: Minimize the cost of producing 1000 kg of the final product.\nCost = 5 * A + 8 * B\n\nConstraints:\n1. A + B = 1000 kg (total weight of the final product)\n2. A >= 250 kg (at least 25% material A)\n3. B <= 400 kg (no more than 40% material B)\n\nParameters for the firefly algorithm:\n1. Number of fireflies (n) = 50\n2. Maximum iterations (MaxIter) = 50\n3. Absorption coefficient (gamma) = 1\n4. Attraction coefficient (beta0) = 1\n5. Randomization parameter (alpha) = 0.2\n\nNow, we will implement the firefly algorithm to find the optimal proportion of raw materials A and B.\n\n1. Initialize the fireflies' positions randomly within the search space, satisfying the constraints.\n2. Evaluate the objective function for each firefly.\n3. Sort the fireflies based on the objective function values.\n4. For each iteration:\n   a. Update the attractiveness of each firefly based on the distance between fireflies.\n   b. Move the less attractive fireflies towards the more attractive ones.\n   c. Evaluate the objective function for each firefly.\n   d. Sort the fireflies based on the objective function values.\n   e. Update the global best solution if a better solution is found.\n5. Repeat steps 4a-4e for the maximum number of iterations (50).\n\nAfter running the firefly algorithm for 50 iterations, we will obtain the optimal proportion of raw materials A and B that minimizes the production cost while satisfying the constraints."
