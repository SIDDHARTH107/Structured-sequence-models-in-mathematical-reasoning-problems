    "message_1": "Consider a group G of order 40. Let H be a subgroup of G of order 5. Then, how many distinct subgroups of order 8 does G contain? Use this to determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C40, the dihedral group D20, or one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40.",
    "message_2": "Since G has order 40, by the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups is either 1 or 8. Since H is a subgroup of G of order 5, we know that there is at least one Sylow 5-subgroup, so there must be either 1 or 8 Sylow 5-subgroups in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups (subgroups of order 8) in G. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups divides the order of G/8 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is either 1 or 5.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C40, then G has a unique subgroup of order 8 (generated by an element of order 8) and a unique subgroup of order 5 (generated by an element of order 5). In this case, there would be 1 Sylow 5-subgroup and 1 Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D20, then G has 4 subgroups of order 8 (generated by rotations and reflections) and 2 subgroups of order 5 (generated by rotations). In this case, there would be 2 Sylow 5-subgroups and 4 Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G is one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40. In this case, G cannot have a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, as that would imply that G is a semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 5, which would be abelian. Therefore, G must have 8 Sylow 5-subgroups in this case. \n\nHowever, we know that G has either 1 or 5 Sylow 2-subgroups. Since none of the non-abelian groups of order 40 can have 8 Sylow 5-subgroups and 1 or 5 Sylow 2-subgroups simultaneously, we can conclude that G cannot be one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40.\n\nThus, we are left with two possibilities: G is isomorphic to C40 or D20. Since we are given that H is a subgroup of G of order 5, and we know that C40 has a unique subgroup of order 5 while D20 has 2 subgroups of order 5, we can conclude that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C40. In this case, G has 1 distinct subgroup of order 8."
