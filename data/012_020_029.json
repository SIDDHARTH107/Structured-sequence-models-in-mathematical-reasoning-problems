    "message_2": "The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all graph automorphisms (i.e., isomorphisms from the graph to itself). In other words, it is the set of all vertex permutations that preserve the adjacency relations of the graph.\n\nFor the given graph G with vertices V={1,2,3,4} and edges E={(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,1)}, we can identify the following automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself: (1,2,3,4) -> (1,2,3,4)\n2. A 90-degree clockwise rotation: (1,2,3,4) -> (4,1,2,3)\n3. A 180-degree rotation: (1,2,3,4) -> (3,4,1,2)\n4. A 270-degree clockwise rotation (or 90-degree counterclockwise rotation): (1,2,3,4) -> (2,3,4,1)\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms for this graph, as any other permutation of vertices would not preserve the adjacency relations. Therefore, the automorphism group of the graph G is:\n\nAut(G) = { (1,2,3,4), (4,1,2,3), (3,4,1,2), (2,3,4,1) }"
