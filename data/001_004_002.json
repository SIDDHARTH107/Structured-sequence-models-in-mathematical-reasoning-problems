    "message_2": "To factor the quadratic polynomial x² + 6x + 9, we look for two binomials of the form (x + a)(x + b) such that a * b = 9 and a + b = 6.\n\nIn this case, a = 3 and b = 3, since 3 * 3 = 9 and 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nSo, the factored form of the quadratic polynomial is:\n\n(x + 3)(x + 3) or (x + 3)²"
