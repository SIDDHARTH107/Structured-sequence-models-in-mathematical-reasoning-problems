    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a right circular cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral area (the area of the curved surface). The formula for the surface area of a cone is given by:\n\nSurface Area = Base Area + Lateral Area\n\nFirst, let's find the base area. The base of the cone is a circle with a radius of 5 cm. The formula for the area of a circle is:\n\nArea = π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius.\n\nBase Area = π * (5 cm)^2 = 25π square centimeters\n\nNow, let's find the lateral area. The formula for the lateral area of a cone is:\n\nLateral Area = π * r * l\n\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nLateral Area = π * (5 cm) * (10 cm) = 50π square centimeters\n\nNow, we can find the total surface area of the cone:\n\nSurface Area = Base Area + Lateral Area = 25π + 50π = 75π square centimeters\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is 75π square centimeters."
