    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation 2sin(3x) - 1 = 0 for values of x between 0 and 360 degrees, follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate the sine function:\n2sin(3x) - 1 = 0\n2sin(3x) = 1\nsin(3x) = 1/2\n\n2. Find the general solution for the sine function:\nSince sin(3x) = 1/2, we know that 3x = arcsin(1/2) + 2nπ or 3x = π - arcsin(1/2) + 2nπ, where n is an integer.\n\n3. Find the specific solutions for x between 0 and 360 degrees:\nFirst, convert the angles to degrees:\n3x = arcsin(1/2) * (180/π) + 360n or 3x = (180 - arcsin(1/2) * (180/π)) + 360n\n\nNow, find the arcsin(1/2) in degrees:\narcsin(1/2) = 30°\n\nSo, the equations become:\n3x = 30 + 360n or 3x = 150 + 360n\n\nNow, find the specific solutions for x between 0 and 360 degrees by plugging in different values of n:\n\nFor n = 0:\n3x = 30 => x = 10°\n3x = 150 => x = 50°\n\nFor n = 1:\n3x = 390 => x = 130°\n3x = 510 => x = 170°\n\nFor n = 2:\n3x = 750 => x = 250°\n3x = 870 => x = 290°\n\nFor n = 3:\n3x = 1110 => x = 370° (This value is outside the 0-360 degree range)\n\nSo, the specific solutions for x between 0 and 360 degrees are:\nx = 10°, 50°, 130°, 170°, 250°, and 290°."
