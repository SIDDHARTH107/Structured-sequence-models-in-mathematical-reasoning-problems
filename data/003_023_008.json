    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors in 3-dimensional space, we can use the following formula:\n\n    𝐀 × 𝐁 = (𝐀y * 𝐁z - 𝐀z * 𝐁y, 𝐀z * 𝐁x - 𝐀x * 𝐁z, 𝐀x * 𝐁y - 𝐀y * 𝐁x)\n\nPlugging in the values for 𝐀 and 𝐁:\n\n    𝐀 × 𝐁 = ((-2) * (-2) - (4) * (5), (4) * (1) - (3) * (-2), (3) * (5) - (-2) * (1))\n\nCalculating the values:\n\n    𝐀 × 𝐁 = (4 - 20, 4 + 6, 15 + 2)\n\n    𝐀 × 𝐁 = (-16, 10, 17)\n\nSo, the cross product of 𝐀 and 𝐁 is (-16, 10, 17)."
