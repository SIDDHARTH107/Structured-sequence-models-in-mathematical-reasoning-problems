    "message_2": "To find all integer pairs (x, y) that satisfy the Diophantine equation 2x + 3y = 9, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. First, we can rewrite the equation as 3y = 9 - 2x.\n2. Then, we can divide both sides by 3 to get y = (9 - 2x)/3.\n3. Now, we can look for integer values of x that make (9 - 2x) divisible by 3.\n\nLet's start by finding the smallest possible value of x:\n\nIf x = 0, then y = (9 - 2*0)/3 = 9/3 = 3. So, (x, y) = (0, 3) is a solution.\n\nNow, let's try increasing the value of x:\n\nIf x = 1, then y = (9 - 2*1)/3 = 7/3, which is not an integer.\n\nIf x = 2, then y = (9 - 2*2)/3 = 5/3, which is not an integer.\n\nIf x = 3, then y = (9 - 2*3)/3 = 3/3 = 1. So, (x, y) = (3, 1) is a solution.\n\nIf x = 4, then y = (9 - 2*4)/3 = 1/3, which is not an integer.\n\nIf x = 5, then y = (9 - 2*5)/3 = -1/3, which is not an integer.\n\nWe can see that as we increase the value of x, the value of y will continue to decrease and will not be an integer. Therefore, there are only two integer pairs (x, y) that satisfy the given Diophantine equation: (0, 3) and (3, 1)."
