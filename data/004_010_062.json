    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3 + 2x^2 - 6x + 7, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 4x^3 + 2x^2 - 6x + 7, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately and then combine them.\n\nAntiderivative of 4x^3:\nUsing the power rule, the antiderivative of x^3 is (x^(3+1))/(3+1) = x^4/4. So, the antiderivative of 4x^3 is 4(x^4/4) = x^4.\n\nAntiderivative of 2x^2:\nUsing the power rule, the antiderivative of x^2 is (x^(2+1))/(2+1) = x^3/3. So, the antiderivative of 2x^2 is 2(x^3/3) = (2/3)x^3.\n\nAntiderivative of -6x:\nUsing the power rule, the antiderivative of x is (x^(1+1))/(1+1) = x^2/2. So, the antiderivative of -6x is -6(x^2/2) = -3x^2.\n\nAntiderivative of 7:\nThe antiderivative of a constant is the constant times x. So, the antiderivative of 7 is 7x.\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^4 + (2/3)x^3 - 3x^2 + 7x + C"
