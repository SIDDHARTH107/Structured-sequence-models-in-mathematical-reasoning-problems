    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of a graph G with 9 vertices and 12 edges, we first need to know the structure of the graph. The Tutte polynomial is a graph invariant, meaning that it is unique for each graph structure. However, without knowing the specific structure of the graph, we can still provide a general formula for the Tutte polynomial.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial T_G(x, y) of a graph G is defined recursively as follows:\n\n1. If G has no edges, then T_G(x, y) = x^(number of isolated vertices in G).\n2. If G has a loop, then T_G(x, y) = T_(G - e)(x, y), where G - e is the graph obtained by deleting the loop.\n3. If G has a bridge, then T_G(x, y) = T_(G / e)(x, y), where G / e is the graph obtained by contracting the bridge.\n4. If G has no loops or bridges, then T_G(x, y) = T_(G - e)(x, y) + T_(G / e)(x, y), where G - e is the graph obtained by deleting an edge, and G / e is the graph obtained by contracting the same edge.\n\nSince we don't know the specific structure of the graph with 9 vertices and 12 edges, we can't provide the exact Tutte polynomial. However, if you provide the adjacency matrix or adjacency list of the graph, we can compute the Tutte polynomial for that specific graph."
