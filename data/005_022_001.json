    "message_2": "To find the median and interquartile range using Tukey's Five-Number Summary, we first need to find the five-number summary, which consists of the minimum value, the first quartile (Q1), the median (Q2), the third quartile (Q3), and the maximum value.\n\nStep 1: Arrange the data in ascending order:\n5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 100\n\nStep 2: Find the median (Q2):\nSince there are 8 data points, the median will be the average of the 4th and 5th values.\nMedian (Q2) = (15 + 20) / 2 = 35 / 2 = 17.5\n\nStep 3: Find the first quartile (Q1):\nQ1 is the median of the lower half of the data (excluding the median if there's an odd number of data points). In this case, the lower half is 5, 8, 10, and 15. Since there are 4 data points, the first quartile will be the average of the 2nd and 3rd values.\nQ1 = (8 + 10) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9\n\nStep 4: Find the third quartile (Q3):\nQ3 is the median of the upper half of the data (excluding the median if there's an odd number of data points). In this case, the upper half is 20, 30, 40, and 100. Since there are 4 data points, the third quartile will be the average of the 2nd and 3rd values.\nQ3 = (30 + 40) / 2 = 70 / 2 = 35\n\nStep 5: Find the minimum and maximum values:\nMinimum value = 5\nMaximum value = 100\n\nNow that we have the five-number summary, we can find the median and interquartile range.\n\nMedian (Q2) = 17.5\n\nInterquartile Range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1 = 35 - 9 = 26\n\nSo, the median is 17.5, and the interquartile range is 26."
