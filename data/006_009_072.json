    "message_2": "To find the expected number of patients with the condition, we can multiply the total number of patients by the probability of having the condition.\n\nExpected number of patients with the condition = Total number of patients × Probability of having the condition\n\nExpected number of patients with the condition = 400 × 0.15\n\nExpected number of patients with the condition = 60\n\nSo, 60 patients can be expected to have the medical condition in the hospital."
