    "message_1": "A steel rod of length 10 units is fixed at both ends. The initial temperature distribution of the rod is given by f(x) = x(10 - x). At time t=0, the temperature at each point on the rod is 0 except at x = 5 where it is 100 units. Use the Fourier transform to determine the temperature at each point on the rod for all times t > 0.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat equation and its solution using Fourier series. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u(x,t) / ∂t = k * ∂²u(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nThe initial temperature distribution is given by:\n\nu(x,0) = f(x) = x(10 - x)\n\nSince the rod is fixed at both ends, we have the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,t) = u(10,t) = 0\n\nWe will now find the Fourier series representation of the initial temperature distribution:\n\nf(x) = a₀ + Σ [aₙ * cos(nπx/L) + bₙ * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L = 10, and a₀, aₙ, and bₙ are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nSince f(x) is an even function, all bₙ coefficients will be zero. We can find the a₀ and aₙ coefficients using the following formulas:\n\na₀ = (2/L) * ∫[f(x)dx] from 0 to L\naₙ = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\na₀ = (1/5) * ∫[x(10 - x) dx] from 0 to 10\na₀ = (1/5) * [10x²/2 - x³/3] from 0 to 10\na₀ = (1/5) * (500 - 1000/3)\na₀ = 100/3\n\naₙ = (1/5) * ∫[x(10 - x) * cos(nπx/10) dx] from 0 to 10\n\nTo find aₙ, we can use integration by parts twice:\n\nLet u = x(10 - x) and dv = cos(nπx/10) dx\ndu = (10 - 2x) dx and v = (10/nπ) * sin(nπx/10)\n\nNow, we can integrate by parts:\n\naₙ = (1/5) * [(10/nπ) * x(10 - x) * sin(nπx/10) - (10/nπ) * ∫[(10 - 2x) * sin(nπx/10) dx] from 0 to 10\n\nLet u = (10 - 2x) and dv = sin(nπx/10) dx\ndu = -2 dx and v = -(10/n²π²) * cos(nπx/10)\n\nNow, we can integrate by parts again:\n\naₙ = (1/5) * [(10/nπ) * x(10 - x) * sin(nπx/10) + (10/n²π²) * (10 - 2x) * cos(nπx/10) + (20/n³π³) * ∫[cos(nπx/10) dx] from 0 to 10\n\naₙ = (1/5) * [(10/nπ) * x(10 - x) * sin(nπx/10) + (10/n²π²) * (10 - 2x) * cos(nπx/10) + (200/n³π³) * sin(nπx/10)] from 0 to 10\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits, we get:\n\naₙ = (200/n³π³) * (1 - (-1)ⁿ) - (100/n²π²) * (1 - (-1)ⁿ)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of the initial temperature distribution:\n\nu(x,0) = 100/3 + Σ [(200/n³π³) * (1 - (-1)ⁿ) - (100/n²π²) * (1 - (-1)ⁿ)] * cos(nπx/10)\n\nThe solution to the heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions is:\n\nu(x,t) = 100/3 + Σ [(200/n³π³) * (1 - (-1)ⁿ) - (100/n²π²) * (1 - (-1)ⁿ)] * cos(nπx/10) * exp(-k * (nπ/L)² * t)\n\nThis is the temperature distribution at each point on the rod for all times t > 0."
