    "message_2": "The Rail fence cipher with a key value of 3 means that the message was written in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows. To find the length of each rail, we need to determine how many characters are in each row.\n\nThe original message has 32 characters. In the zigzag pattern, the first and last rows contain the characters that are spaced two rows apart, while the middle row contains the characters that are spaced one row apart.\n\nLet's divide the message into segments, where each segment consists of one full cycle of the zigzag pattern (down and up). Each segment will have 4 characters (3 rows down and 1 row up, excluding the first and last characters of the segment).\n\n32 characters / 4 characters per segment = 8 segments\n\nNow, let's distribute the characters in the segments to the rows:\n\nRow 1: 1 character from each segment (1 * 8) = 8 characters\nRow 2: 2 characters from each segment (2 * 8) = 16 characters\nRow 3: 1 character from each segment (1 * 8) = 8 characters\n\nSo, the message was encrypted using 3 rows, and the length of each rail is 8, 16, and 8 characters, respectively."
