    "message_1": "What is the probability of a workplace accident occurring if 3 out of 10 employees have had a previous workplace accident?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a workplace accident occurring, we need more information about the conditions and factors that contribute to accidents. The given information only tells us the proportion of employees who have had a previous workplace accident, but it doesn't provide any information about the likelihood of an accident occurring in the future.\n\nIf we assume that the probability of an accident occurring is the same for all employees and that the past accident rate is indicative of future accident rates, we can estimate the probability of an accident occurring as follows:\n\nProbability of a workplace accident = (Number of employees with a previous accident) / (Total number of employees)\n\nProbability = 3 / 10\n\nProbability = 0.3 or 30%\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a very simplistic estimation and may not accurately represent the true probability of a workplace accident occurring. Factors such as safety measures, employee training, and workplace conditions should also be considered when assessing the risk of accidents."
