    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski triangle, is a fractal pattern that is formed by repeatedly removing smaller triangles from a larger triangle. After each stage, the perimeter of the remaining triangles increases.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the Sierpinski triangle after the nth stage as P(n). The perimeter after the 0th stage (the starting triangle) is P(0) = 3 * 4 = 12 cm, where 3 is the number of sides of the triangle and 4 cm is the length of each side.\n\nAfter each stage, the perimeter of the Sierpinski triangle is multiplied by a factor of 3/2. This is because, after each stage, each side of the triangle is divided into two segments, and three new triangles are formed, each with a side length equal to half of the original side length.\n\nSo, the perimeter after the 7th stage can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(7) = P(0) * (3/2)^7\nP(7) = 12 * (3/2)^7\nP(7) ≈ 12 * 21.65625\nP(7) ≈ 259.875 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the Sierpinski pyramid after the 7th stage is approximately 259.875 cm."
