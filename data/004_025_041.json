    "message_2": "To find the maximum height and the time it takes to reach it, we can use the following kinematic equations:\n\n1. v = u + at\n2. s = ut + (1/2)at^2\n3. v^2 = u^2 + 2as\n\nwhere:\n- v is the final velocity (0 m/s at the maximum height)\n- u is the initial velocity (25 m/s)\n- a is the acceleration due to gravity (-9.8 m/s^2)\n- t is the time\n- s is the displacement (maximum height)\n\nFirst, let's find the time (t) it takes to reach the maximum height using equation 1:\n\n0 = 25 + (-9.8)t\n9.8t = 25\nt = 25 / 9.8\nt ≈ 2.55 s\n\nNow, let's find the maximum height (s) using equation 2:\n\ns = 25t + (1/2)(-9.8)t^2\ns = 25(2.55) + (1/2)(-9.8)(2.55)^2\ns ≈ 63.78 m\n\nSo, the maximum height the ball reaches is approximately 63.78 meters, and it takes about 2.55 seconds to reach it."
