    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 25. Since 25 = 5^2, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G must divide 1 (since 25 = 1 * 5^2) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, there must be exactly one 5-Sylow subgroup in G, say H. Since H is the only 5-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIf G is cyclic, then there exists an element g in G such that G = ⟨g⟩, and the order of g is 25. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 25, Z_25.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\nIf G is not cyclic, then there is no element in G with order 25. Since H is a normal subgroup of G with order 5, H is isomorphic to Z_5, the cyclic group of order 5. Let h be a generator of H, i.e., H = ⟨h⟩.\n\nNow, let g be an element in G but not in H. Since H is normal in G, the set {gh : h ∈ H} is also a subgroup of G, say K. Note that K has order 5 since g is not in H and gh ≠ gk for distinct h, k ∈ H. Thus, K is also isomorphic to Z_5.\n\nNow, we claim that G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, i.e., G ≅ H × K. To show this, we need to show that every element in G can be written uniquely as a product of elements from H and K. Let x be an element in G. Since H is normal in G, we have xH = Hx. Thus, there exists h ∈ H such that xh = hx. Now, let y = xh^(-1). Then, y ∈ K since yh = x. So, x = yh, where y ∈ K and h ∈ H.\n\nTo show uniqueness, suppose x = y'h' where y' ∈ K and h' ∈ H. Then, y^(-1)y' = h'h^(-1). Since y^(-1)y' ∈ K and h'h^(-1) ∈ H, and H ∩ K = {e} (the identity element), we must have y^(-1)y' = h'h^(-1) = e. Thus, y = y' and h = h', which proves uniqueness.\n\nTherefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which are both cyclic groups of order 5. In other words, G ≅ Z_5 × Z_5.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 25 is either cyclic (isomorphic to Z_25) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5 (isomorphic to Z_5 × Z_5)."
