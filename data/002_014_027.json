    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is the total surface area of the prism in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length × width.\n\nThere are three pairs of opposite faces on a rectangular prism:\n\n1. Two faces with dimensions 6 cm × 4 cm (length × width)\n2. Two faces with dimensions 6 cm × 5 cm (length × height)\n3. Two faces with dimensions 4 cm × 5 cm (width × height)\n\nNow, we find the area of each pair of faces and add them together:\n\n1. 2 × (6 cm × 4 cm) = 2 × 24 cm² = 48 cm²\n2. 2 × (6 cm × 5 cm) = 2 × 30 cm² = 60 cm²\n3. 2 × (4 cm × 5 cm) = 2 × 20 cm² = 40 cm²\n\nTotal surface area = 48 cm² + 60 cm² + 40 cm² = 148 cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 148 square centimeters."
