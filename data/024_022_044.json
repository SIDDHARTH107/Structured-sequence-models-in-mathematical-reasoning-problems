    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points in the space. In this case, we are looking for isometries that preserve the metric $g(x, y) = dx^2 + dy^2$ on the unit circle $C = \\{(x, y) | x^2 + y^2 = 1\\}$.\n\nThere are four types of isometries in the Euclidean plane: translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections. However, since we are considering the unit circle, translations and glide reflections are not applicable. Thus, we only need to consider rotations and reflections.\n\n1. Rotations:\n\nA rotation is an isometry that rotates the unit circle around its center (0, 0) by an angle $\\theta$. The transformation can be represented as:\n\n$\\phi(x, y) = (x \\cos \\theta - y \\sin \\theta, x \\sin \\theta + y \\cos \\theta)$\n\nSince the unit circle is symmetric, any rotation by an angle $\\theta$ will map the circle onto itself, preserving the metric.\n\n2. Reflections:\n\nA reflection is an isometry that reflects the unit circle across a line passing through its center (0, 0). The transformation can be represented as:\n\n$\\phi(x, y) = (x \\cos 2\\alpha + y \\sin 2\\alpha, -x \\sin 2\\alpha + y \\cos 2\\alpha)$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the angle between the reflection line and the x-axis. Since the unit circle is symmetric, any reflection across a line passing through its center will map the circle onto itself, preserving the metric.\n\nIn conclusion, all isometries $\\phi: C \\rightarrow C$ that preserve the metric $g(x, y) = dx^2 + dy^2$ on the unit circle $C = \\{(x, y) | x^2 + y^2 = 1\\}$ are rotations and reflections as described above."
