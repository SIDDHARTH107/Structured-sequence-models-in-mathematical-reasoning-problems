    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 125. Since 125 = 5^3, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that G has a Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, of order 5^3 = 125. Let n be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G. By the Sylow Theorems, we have:\n\n1. n ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n divides 125\n\nSince 125 is a power of a prime, the only divisors of 125 are 1, 5, 25, and 125. From condition 1, we know that n cannot be 5, 25, or 125, so n must be 1. This means that there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, H, and it is normal in G.\n\nNow, consider the center of the group, Z(G). Since G is a p-group (a group of order p^n for some prime p and integer n), we know that Z(G) is nontrivial (i.e., it contains more than just the identity element). Let |Z(G)| = 5^k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 3.\n\nCase 1: k = 3\nIn this case, Z(G) = G, which means G is an abelian group. Since G is a group of order 125, it must be a direct product of cyclic groups of order 5. There are two possibilities: G is either a cyclic group of order 125 (C_125) or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25 (C_5 x C_25).\n\nCase 2: k = 1\nIn this case, |Z(G)| = 5. Consider the quotient group G/Z(G). This group has order 125/5 = 25. Since 25 is a square of a prime, G/Z(G) is abelian and must be either a cyclic group of order 25 (C_25) or the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5 (C_5 x C_5).\n\nIf G/Z(G) is isomorphic to C_25, then by the Fundamental Theorem of Group Homomorphisms, G must be isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25 (C_5 x C_25).\n\nIf G/Z(G) is isomorphic to C_5 x C_5, then G has a subgroup of order 25 that is normal in G. However, this contradicts the fact that G has a unique subgroup of order 125, which is H. Therefore, this case cannot occur.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 125 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
