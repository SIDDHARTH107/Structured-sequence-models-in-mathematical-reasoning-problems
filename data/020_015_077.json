    "message_1": "A farmer has a rectangular field of length 50 meters and width 30 meters. He wants to fence the field with the least amount of fencing material possible. What is the minimum length of fencing material required?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum length of fencing material required, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular field. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)\n\nIn this case, the length is 50 meters and the width is 30 meters. So, the perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = 2 × (50 + 30) = 2 × 80 = 160 meters\n\nThe minimum length of fencing material required is 160 meters."
