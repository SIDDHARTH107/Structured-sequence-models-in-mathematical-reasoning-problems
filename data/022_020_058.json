    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the differential equation, we first need to find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for the given differential equation is:\n\n$$r^2 - 6r + 9 = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n$$(r - 3)(r - 3) = 0$$\n\nSince both factors are the same, we have a repeated root, r = 3. In this case, the general solution of the differential equation is given by:\n\n$$y(t) = c_1 e^{3t} + c_2 te^{3t}$$\n\nNow, we need to use the boundary conditions to determine the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$. \n\nFor the first boundary condition, $y(0) = 1$, we have:\n\n$$1 = c_1 e^{3 \\cdot 0} + c_2 (0) e^{3 \\cdot 0}$$\n$$1 = c_1$$\n\nFor the second boundary condition, $y(\\pi) = 4$, we have:\n\n$$4 = c_1 e^{3\\pi} + c_2 \\pi e^{3\\pi}$$\n\nSince we already know that $c_1 = 1$, we can substitute it into the equation:\n\n$$4 = e^{3\\pi} + c_2 \\pi e^{3\\pi}$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $c_2$:\n\n$$c_2 \\pi e^{3\\pi} = 4 - e^{3\\pi}$$\n$$c_2 = \\frac{4 - e^{3\\pi}}{\\pi e^{3\\pi}}$$\n\nThus, the solution of the boundary value problem is:\n\n$$y(t) = e^{3t} + \\frac{4 - e^{3\\pi}}{\\pi e^{3\\pi}} te^{3t}$$"
