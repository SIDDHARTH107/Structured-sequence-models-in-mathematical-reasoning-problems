    "message_1": "What is the volume of a rectangular pyramid with a base that measures 10 cm by 6 cm and a height of 8 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, you can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid is the product of the length and width of the base:\n\nBase Area = Length * Width = 10 cm * 6 cm = 60 cm²\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 60 cm² * 8 cm = (1/3) * 480 cm³ = 160 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 160 cubic centimeters."
