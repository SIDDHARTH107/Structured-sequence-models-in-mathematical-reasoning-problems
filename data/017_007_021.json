    "message_2": "To find all possible Cayley tables for a group of order 6, we first need to know the properties of a group. A group must satisfy the following properties:\n\n1. Closure: The result of the operation on any two elements in the group must also be in the group.\n2. Associativity: For all elements a, b, and c in the group, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).\n3. Identity: There exists an identity element e in the group such that for all elements a in the group, a * e = e * a = a.\n4. Inverse: For every element a in the group, there exists an inverse element a^-1 such that a * a^-1 = a^-1 * a = e.\n\nSince the group has order 6, there are 6 elements in the group. Let's denote them as {e, a, b, c, d, f}. We will construct the Cayley table for the group, which is a 6x6 table with rows and columns labeled by the group elements, and the entry in the i-th row and j-th column is the result of the group operation on the i-th and j-th elements.\n\nThere are two non-isomorphic groups of order 6: the cyclic group C6 and the dihedral group D3. We will construct the Cayley tables for both groups and determine their properties.\n\n1. Cyclic group C6:\n\nThe cyclic group C6 is generated by a single element, say a, such that a^6 = e. The elements of C6 can be written as {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}. The Cayley table for C6 is:\n\n```\n   e  a  a^2  a^3  a^4  a^5\ne  e  a  a^2  a^3  a^4  a^5\na  a a^2  a^3  a^4  a^5  e\na^2 a^3  a^4  a^5  e  a  a^2\na^3 a^4  a^5  e  a^2  a^3  a^4\na^4 a^5  e  a^2  a^3  a^4  a^5\na^5 e  a  a^2  a^3  a^4  a^5\n```\n\n2. Dihedral group D3:\n\nThe dihedral group D3 consists of the symmetries of an equilateral triangle, which includes rotations and reflections. It can be generated by two elements, say r and s, with the relations r^3 = e, s^2 = e, and s * r = r^2 * s. The elements of D3 can be written as {e, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2}. The Cayley table for D3 is:\n\n```\n   e  r  r^2  s  sr  sr^2\ne  e  r  r^2  s  sr  sr^2\nr  r r^2  e  sr^2  s  sr\nr^2 r^2  e  r  sr  sr^2  s\ns  s  sr sr^2  e  r  r^2\nsr sr^2  s  r  r^2  e  sr\nsr^2 sr  sr^2  r^2  s  r  e\n```\n\nNow, let's determine if each table represents a cyclic group C6 or a dihedral group D3:\n\n1. Cyclic group C6:\n\nThe Cayley table for C6 shows that it is generated by a single element a, and all other elements can be obtained by repeated multiplication of a. Therefore, this table represents a cyclic group C6.\n\n2. Dihedral group D3:\n\nThe Cayley table for D3 shows that it is generated by two elements r and s, with the given relations. It is not generated by a single element, so it is not a cyclic group. This table represents a dihedral group D3.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found the Cayley tables for the two non-isomorphic groups of order 6: the cyclic group C6 and the dihedral group D3."
