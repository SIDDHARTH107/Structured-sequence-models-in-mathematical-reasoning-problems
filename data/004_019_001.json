    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the car, we can use the formula:\n\na = (v - u) / t\n\nwhere a is the acceleration, v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, and t is the time taken.\n\nIn this case, the final velocity (v) is 20 m/s, the initial velocity (u) is 0 m/s (since the car starts from rest), and the time taken (t) is 5 seconds.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\na = (20 - 0) / 5\na = 20 / 5\na = 4 m/s²\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car is 4 m/s²."
