    "message_2": "The intersection between a set A and its complement A' is the set of elements that are common to both A and A'. By definition, the complement of a set contains all the elements that are not in the set. Therefore, there are no elements common to both A and A'. \n\nSo, the intersection between A and A' is an empty set, denoted as âˆ… or {}."
