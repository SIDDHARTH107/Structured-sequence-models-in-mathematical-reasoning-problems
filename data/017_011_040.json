    "message_2": "To show that there are no non-isomorphic groups of order 12, we will use the given hint and analyze the possible structures of groups of order 12. Let G be a group of order 12. We know that the order of G is 12, so |G| = 12 = 2^2 * 3. Now, we consider the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. Sylow 1st theorem: There exists a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup in G.\n2. Sylow 2nd theorem: The number of Sylow p-subgroups divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nLet n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups (p = 2), we have:\n- n_2 divides 12, so n_2 can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n- n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2, so n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups (p = 3), we have:\n- n_3 divides 12, so n_3 can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n- n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Both of these subgroups are normal in G, and their intersection is trivial. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which means G is isomorphic to C_4 x C_3 = C_{12} (the cyclic group of order 12).\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G. G acts on this subgroup by conjugation, and this action is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group S_3. Since S_3 has only two subgroups of order 3 (up to isomorphism), the action of G on the Sylow 3-subgroup is either trivial or non-trivial. If the action is trivial, then G is isomorphic to C_2 x C_2 x C_3, which is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups and is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_6. If the action is non-trivial, then G is isomorphic to the alternating group A_4.\n\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal in G. However, this case is not possible because the Sylow 3-subgroups would have 2 elements in common with the Sylow 2-subgroup, which contradicts the fact that their intersection should be trivial.\n\nIn conclusion, any group of order 12 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C_{12}, the alternating group A_4, or the dihedral group D_6. There are no non-isomorphic groups of order 12."
