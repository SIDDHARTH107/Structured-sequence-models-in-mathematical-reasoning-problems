    "message_2": "Cauchy's theorem states that if a function is analytic (holomorphic) within and on a simple closed contour, then the integral of the function along that contour is zero. \n\nThe function f(z) = z^2 + 4z + 2 is a polynomial, and polynomials are analytic everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, f(z) is analytic within and on the circular contour |z - 3i| = 2.\n\nApplying Cauchy's theorem, the integral of f(z) along the contour is:\n\nâˆ®f(z) dz = 0"
