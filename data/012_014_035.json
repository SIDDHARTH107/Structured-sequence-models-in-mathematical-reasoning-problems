    "message_2": "Graph A and Graph B are isomorphic. We can find an isomorphism between the two graphs by mapping the vertices of Graph A to the vertices of Graph B in such a way that the adjacency relationships are preserved.\n\nOne possible isomorphism is:\n\n1 -> a\n2 -> b\n3 -> c\n4 -> d\n5 -> e\n\nUnder this mapping, the edges of Graph A correspond to the edges of Graph B as follows:\n\n(1, 2) -> (a, b)\n(1, 3) -> (a, c)\n(2, 3) -> (b, c)\n(2, 4) -> (b, d)\n(3, 5) -> (c, e)\n\nSince the adjacency relationships are preserved under this mapping, Graph A and Graph B are isomorphic."
