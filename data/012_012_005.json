A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, and it must have at least three distinct vertices along the way.",
    "message_2": "The girth of the given graph is 3.\n\nThere are four cycles of length 3 in the graph:\n\n1. Cycle 1-2-4-1\n2. Cycle 2-3-6-2\n3. Cycle 1-4-5-1\n4. Cycle 3-5-6-3\n\nSince these are the shortest cycles in the graph, the girth is 3."
