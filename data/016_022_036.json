    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron or Sierpinski triangle, is a fractal structure formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles. \n\nTo calculate the total number of triangles in a Sierpinski pyramid with a given number of levels, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal triangles = (4^levels - 1) / (4 - 1)\n\nIn this case, the pyramid has 5 levels, so we can plug that into the formula:\n\nTotal triangles = (4^5 - 1) / (4 - 1)\nTotal triangles = (1024 - 1) / 3\nTotal triangles = 1023 / 3\nTotal triangles = 341\n\nSo, there are 341 triangles in a Sierpinski pyramid with 5 levels and a base equilateral triangle with a side length of 6 cm."
