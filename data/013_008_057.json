    "message_1": "In a game where each player contributes money to a public goods fund, four players have agreed to invest $50 each. The total amount in the fund is used to buy books for a local library. The library can buy books at a total cost of $200, and each book costs $10. If each player contributed $60 instead of $50, how many additional books could the library buy with the increased funds?",
    "message_2": "If each player contributes $50, the total amount in the fund is 4 * $50 = $200. With this amount, the library can buy $200 / $10 = 20 books.\n\nIf each player contributes $60 instead, the total amount in the fund is 4 * $60 = $240. With this increased amount, the library can buy $240 / $10 = 24 books.\n\nThe library can buy 24 - 20 = <<24-20=4>>4 additional books with the increased funds."
