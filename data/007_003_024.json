    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 21^10 is divided by 5, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. \n\nFirst, let's find the remainder when 21 is divided by 5:\n\n21 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nNow, we can raise both sides of the congruence to the power of 10:\n\n(21^10) ≡ (1^10) (mod 5)\n\nSince 1 raised to any power is still 1, we have:\n\n21^10 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nSo, the remainder when 21^10 is divided by 5 is 1."
