The distance between the houses is given in the table below. What is the optimal route for the delivery person to take? \n\n|   | A | B | C | D | E | F |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A | 0 | 3 | 7 | 5 | 4 | 9 |\n| B | 3 | 0 | 5 | 8 | 2 | 10|\n| C | 7 | 5 | 0 | 6 | 1 | 8 |\n| D | 5 | 8 | 6 | 0 | 5 | 3 |\n| E | 4 | 2 | 1 | 5 | 0 | 6 |\n| F | 9 | 10| 8 | 3 | 6 | 0 | \n\nAssuming the delivery person starts and ends at house A, what is the shortest total distance that they need to travel to deliver all six pizzas?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest route, we can use the \"nearest neighbor\" method. Starting at house A, we will visit the nearest unvisited house and continue this process until all houses have been visited, and then return to house A.\n\n1. Start at house A. The nearest house is B (3 units away).\n2. From house B, the nearest unvisited house is E (2 units away).\n3. From house E, the nearest unvisited house is C (1 unit away).\n4. From house C, the nearest unvisited house is D (6 units away).\n5. From house D, the nearest unvisited house is F (3 units away).\n6. Finally, return to house A from house F (9 units away).\n\nThe shortest route is A → B → E → C → D → F → A.\n\nThe total distance traveled is 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 3 + 9 = 24 units."
