    "message_2": "To find the poles of the meromorphic function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator of the function becomes zero. In other words, we need to solve the equation:\n\nz^2 + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 0, and c = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (± √(-4)) / 2\n\nz = ± √(-1)\n\nz = ± i\n\nSo, the poles of f(z) are z = i and z = -i.\n\nNow, to determine the order of these poles, we need to find the smallest integer n such that the function (z - i)^n f(z) is analytic at z = i. We can do this by finding the limit as z approaches i:\n\nlim (z→i) (z - i)^n f(z)\n\nSince f(z) = (z^3 + 2z + 3)/(z^2 + 1), we can rewrite the limit as:\n\nlim (z→i) (z - i)^n (z^3 + 2z + 3) / (z^2 + 1)\n\nNow, let's find the limit as z approaches -i:\n\nlim (z→-i) (z + i)^n f(z)\n\nlim (z→-i) (z + i)^n (z^3 + 2z + 3) / (z^2 + 1)\n\nFor both poles, we can see that the numerator has no common factors with the denominator, and the numerator is not zero at the poles. Therefore, the order of both poles is 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the meromorphic function f(z) has two poles, z = i and z = -i, both of order 1."
