    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1, we will apply the power rule for integration, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1:\n\nThe antiderivative of 3x^2 is (3/3)x^(2+1) = x^3.\nThe antiderivative of 2x is (2/2)x^(1+1) = x^2.\nThe antiderivative of 1 is x (since the antiderivative of a constant is the constant times x).\n\nSo, the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1 is:\n\nF(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + C, where C is the constant of integration."
