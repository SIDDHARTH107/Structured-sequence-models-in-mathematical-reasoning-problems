    "message_2": "To estimate the expected value of winning per game using Monte Carlo simulation, we will simulate the game 10,000 times and calculate the average winnings per game.\n\nHere's the procedure:\n\n1. Initialize the total winnings to 0.\n2. For each game (10,000 times), roll two dice and calculate their sum.\n3. If the sum is 7, add $10 to the total winnings. Otherwise, subtract $5 from the total winnings.\n4. After all games are played, divide the total winnings by the number of games (10,000) to get the average winnings per game.\n\nLet's perform the simulation:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ntotal_winnings = 0\nnum_games = 10000\n\nfor _ in range(num_games):\n    die1 = random.randint(1, 6)\n    die2 = random.randint(1, 6)\n    total = die1 + die2\n\n    if total == 7:\n        total_winnings += 10\n    else:\n        total_winnings -= 5\n\naverage_winnings_per_game = total_winnings / num_games\n```\n\nAfter running the simulation, we get the average winnings per game. Note that the result may vary slightly each time the simulation is run due to the random nature of the dice rolls."
