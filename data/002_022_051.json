    "message_1": "A torus has a minor radius of 4 cm and a major radius of 10 cm. Find its volume to the nearest cubic centimeter.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nIn this case, the minor radius (r) is 4 cm and the major radius (R) is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (π * 4^2) * (2 * π * 10)\n\nVolume = (π * 16) * (20 * π)\n\nVolume = 320 * π^2\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14159:\n\nVolume ≈ 320 * (3.14159)^2\n\nVolume ≈ 320 * 9.8696\n\nVolume ≈ 3158.272\n\nRounding to the nearest cubic centimeter, the volume of the torus is approximately 3158 cm³."
