    "message_2": "Since $M$ is a smooth oriented 2-dimensional surface embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we can apply the Poincaré-Hopf theorem to relate the De Rham cohomology groups to the topology of $M$. In particular, we have the following isomorphisms:\n\n$H^0(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, which corresponds to the connectedness of $M$.\n\n$H^1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2g}$, where $g$ is the genus of $M$.\n\n$H^2(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, which is given in the problem statement.\n\nNow, we can use the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$ to relate the genus to the De Rham cohomology groups. For a compact oriented surface, the Euler characteristic is given by:\n\n$\\chi(M) = 2 - 2g$.\n\nBy the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, we have:\n\n$\\chi(M) = \\sum_{k=0}^2 (-1)^k \\dim H^k(M)$.\n\nPlugging in the dimensions of the De Rham cohomology groups, we get:\n\n$2 - 2g = \\dim H^0(M) - \\dim H^1(M) + \\dim H^2(M) = 1 - 2g + 1$.\n\nSolving for $g$, we find that the genus of $M$ is:\n\n$g = 1$.\n\nThus, the genus of the smooth oriented 2-dimensional surface $M$ embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is 1."
