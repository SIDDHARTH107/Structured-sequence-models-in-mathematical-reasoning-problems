Write the message in rows:\n\nH E L L\nO W O R\nL D\n\n2. Read the columns in the order specified by the key \"3142\":\n\n3rd column: L O L\n1st column: H E D\n4th column: L R\n2nd column: E W O\n\n3. Combine the columns to get the ciphertext:\n\nLOLHEDLR_EWO\n\nThe ciphertext is \"LOLHEDLR_EWO\" (with an underscore representing the blank space in the last row of the 2nd column)."
