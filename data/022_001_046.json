    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = (1+z)^3/(3+z) about the point z = -3, we first make a substitution to express the function in terms of (z+3). Let w = z + 3, then z = w - 3. Now, we can rewrite f(z) in terms of w:\n\nf(w) = ((1+(w-3))^3) / (3+(w-3))\nf(w) = (w-2)^3 / w\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion of f(w) using the geometric series formula:\n\n1/w = 1/(1 - (1 - w)) = sum((1 - w)^n, n=0 to infinity)\n\nNow, we can expand (w-2)^3 using the binomial theorem:\n\n(w-2)^3 = w^3 - 6w^2 + 12w - 8\n\nNow, we can multiply the two series term by term:\n\nf(w) = (w^3 - 6w^2 + 12w - 8) * sum((1 - w)^n, n=0 to infinity)\n\nNow, we can substitute back z = w - 3:\n\nf(z) = ((z-3)^3 - 6(z-3)^2 + 12(z-3) - 8) * sum((1 - (z-2))^n, n=0 to infinity)\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion of f(z) about the point z = -3.\n\nNow, we need to determine the largest annulus centered at z = -3 in which this series expansion converges. The convergence of the geometric series sum((1 - (z-2))^n, n=0 to infinity) depends on the absolute value of its ratio, which is |1 - (z-2)|. The series converges when |1 - (z-2)| < 1, which simplifies to:\n\n-1 < z - 3 < 1\n\nThis inequality implies that the largest annulus centered at z = -3 in which the Laurent series expansion converges is given by:\n\n1 < |z+3| < 3"
