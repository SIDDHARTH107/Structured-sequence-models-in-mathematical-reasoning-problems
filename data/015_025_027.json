    "message_2": "To find the maximum amplitude A of a damped forced Van der Pol oscillator, we need to consider the steady-state response of the system. The equation for a damped forced Van der Pol oscillator is given by:\n\nx''(t) - µ(1 - x(t)^2)x'(t) + ω^2x(t) = F*cos(ωt)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement, x'(t) is the velocity, x''(t) is the acceleration, µ is the damping constant, ω is the oscillator frequency, and F is the forcing amplitude.\n\nThe steady-state response of the system occurs when the transient response has decayed, and the system is only responding to the forcing function. In this case, the steady-state response can be approximated by:\n\nx(t) = A*cos(ωt - δ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, and δ is the phase shift.\n\nTo find the maximum amplitude A, we can use the formula for the amplitude of a damped forced oscillator:\n\nA = F / sqrt((ω^2 - ω_0^2)^2 + (2µω)^2)\n\nwhere ω_0 is the natural frequency of the oscillator. In this problem, we are given ω = 4, so we can assume that ω_0 is also 4 (since it is not specified otherwise).\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nA = 1.5 / sqrt((4^2 - 4^2)^2 + (2*0.5*4)^2)\nA = 1.5 / sqrt(0 + (4)^2)\nA = 1.5 / sqrt(16)\nA = 1.5 / 4\nA = 0.375\n\nSo, the maximum amplitude A that the damped forced Van der Pol oscillator can reach after being driven for 10 time units is 0.375."
