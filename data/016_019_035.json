    "message_2": "The Koch Island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the length of each side of the triangle is multiplied by 4/3. \n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of each side is 4/3 units. \nAfter the second iteration, the length of each side is (4/3)^2 units. \nAfter the third iteration, the length of each side is (4/3)^3 units. \n\nSince there are three sides in the equilateral triangle, the total length of the Koch Island after three iterations is:\n\n3 * (4/3)^3 = 3 * (64/27) = 192/27 â‰ˆ 7.111 units."
