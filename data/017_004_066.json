    "message_2": "To show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 25, which is a prime power (25 = 5^2), G is a p-group (p = 5 in this case). Now, let's find the Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, satisfies:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides the order of G, which is 25.\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. If n_5 = 1, then there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, and it is normal in G. Let's call this subgroup H. Since the order of H is 5 (a prime number), H is cyclic. Thus, G is a cyclic group in this case.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when n_5 = 25. In this case, there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups, each of order 5. Let H and K be two distinct Sylow 5-subgroups. Since H and K are both of order 5, they are cyclic. Moreover, since they are distinct, their intersection is trivial, i.e., H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the product HK. Since |H| = |K| = 5 and H ∩ K = {e}, we have |HK| = |H| * |K| = 25. Thus, HK = G. Moreover, since H and K are both normal in G (as they are the only Sylow 5-subgroups), the product HK is the direct product of H and K. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5 in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
