    "message_1": "A trucking company has 2 types of trucks: Type A has a capacity of 7 tons and type B has a capacity of 5 tons. The company needs to transport 80 tons of cargo. Type A truck costs $1000 to rent and can carry 28 tons of cargo. Type B truck costs $800 to rent and can carry 20 tons of cargo. What is the minimum cost to rent the trucks so that all the cargo is transported?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of Type A trucks rented as x and the number of Type B trucks rented as y. We need to find the minimum cost, so we need to minimize the cost function:\n\nCost = 1000x + 800y\n\nSubject to the constraint that the total capacity of the trucks is at least 80 tons:\n\n7x + 5y ≥ 80\n\nNow, we need to find the integer values of x and y that satisfy this constraint and minimize the cost function.\n\nFirst, let's solve the constraint inequality for y:\n\ny ≥ (80 - 7x) / 5\n\nSince x and y are integers, we can start by testing integer values of x and finding the corresponding minimum integer value of y that satisfies the constraint.\n\nx = 0: y ≥ 16 (not a minimum)\nx = 1: y ≥ 14.6 (y = 15)\nx = 2: y ≥ 13.2 (y = 14)\nx = 3: y ≥ 11.8 (y = 12)\nx = 4: y ≥ 10.4 (y = 11)\nx = 5: y ≥ 9 (y = 9)\nx = 6: y ≥ 7.6 (y = 8)\nx = 7: y ≥ 6.2 (y = 7)\nx = 8: y ≥ 4.8 (y = 5)\nx = 9: y ≥ 3.4 (y = 4)\nx = 10: y ≥ 2 (y = 2)\nx = 11: y ≥ 0.6 (y = 1)\nx = 12: y ≥ -0.8 (not a valid solution since y must be positive)\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost for each valid (x, y) pair:\n\n(x = 1, y = 15): Cost = 1000(1) + 800(15) = 13000\n(x = 2, y = 14): Cost = 1000(2) + 800(14) = 13200\n(x = 3, y = 12): Cost = 1000(3) + 800(12) = 12600\n(x = 4, y = 11): Cost = 1000(4) + 800(11) = 12800\n(x = 5, y = 9): Cost = 1000(5) + 800(9) = 12200\n(x = 6, y = 8): Cost = 1000(6) + 800(8) = 12400\n(x = 7, y = 7): Cost = 1000(7) + 800(7) = 12600\n(x = 8, y = 5): Cost = 1000(8) + 800(5) = 12000\n(x = 9, y = 4): Cost = 1000(9) + 800(4) = 12200\n(x = 10, y = 2): Cost = 1000(10) + 800(2) = 11600\n(x = 11, y = 1): Cost = 1000(11) + 800(1) = 11800\n\nThe minimum cost is $11,600 when renting 10 Type A trucks and 2 Type B trucks."
