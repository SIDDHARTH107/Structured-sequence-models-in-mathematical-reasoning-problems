    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a regular tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. After each iteration, the number of smaller tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nTo find the total number of smaller tetrahedra after the 7th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedra = (4^n - 1) / (4 - 1)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the 7th iteration:\n\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedra = (4^7 - 1) / (4 - 1)\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedra = (16384 - 1) / 3\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedra = 16383 / 3\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedra = 5461\n\nSo, there are 5461 smaller tetrahedra present in a Sierpinski tetrahedron after the 7th iteration."
