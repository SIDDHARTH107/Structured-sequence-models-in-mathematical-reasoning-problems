    "message_2": "To find the scalar product (also known as the dot product) of two vectors A and B, we can use the formula:\n\nA . B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nGiven the magnitudes of A and B are 5 and 7 respectively, and the angle between them is 60 degrees, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nA . B = 5 * 7 * cos(60°)\n\nSince cos(60°) = 1/2, we have:\n\nA . B = 5 * 7 * (1/2) = 35/2 = 17.5\n\nSo, the scalar product of vectors A and B is 17.5."
