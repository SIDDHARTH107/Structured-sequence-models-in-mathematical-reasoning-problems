    "message_2": "To show that $V$ is a non-singular curve, we need to check two things:\n\n1. $V$ is a curve, i.e., it is a one-dimensional variety.\n2. $V$ is non-singular, i.e., the partial derivatives of the defining polynomials do not simultaneously vanish at any point on $V$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the partial derivatives of the defining polynomials:\n\nFor $f_1 = x^3 - y^2z$, we have:\n$\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} = 3x^2$\n$\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} = -2yz$\n$\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial z} = -y^2$\n\nFor $f_2 = xz^2 - y^3$, we have:\n$\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} = z^2$\n$\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} = -3y^2$\n$\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial z} = 2xz$\n\nNow, let's consider a point $[a:b:c] \\in V$. Then, we have $a^3 - b^2c = 0$ and $ac^2 - b^3 = 0$. We want to show that there is no point on $V$ where all the partial derivatives vanish simultaneously.\n\nSuppose that $\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial z} = 0$ at $[a:b:c]$. Then, we have the following system of equations:\n\n1. $3a^2 = 0$\n2. $-2bc = 0$\n3. $-b^2 = 0$\n4. $c^2 = 0$\n5. $-3b^2 = 0$\n6. $2ac = 0$\n\nFrom equation (1), we have $a = 0$. From equation (3), we have $b = 0$. But this implies that $[a:b:c] = [0:0:c]$, which is not a valid point in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. Thus, there is no point on $V$ where all the partial derivatives vanish simultaneously, and $V$ is non-singular.\n\nNow, we need to compute the genus of the curve. Since $V$ is a curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, we can use the genus-degree formula:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$,\n\nwhere $g$ is the genus and $d$ is the degree of the curve. The degree of $V$ is the maximum of the degrees of the defining polynomials, which is $\\max\\{\\deg(x^3 - y^2z), \\deg(xz^2 - y^3)\\} = \\max\\{3, 3\\} = 3$. Plugging this into the genus-degree formula, we get:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the genus of the curve $V$ is 1."
