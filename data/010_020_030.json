    "message_2": "To compute the Floer homology group of the 2-torus X = S1 x S1, we first need to consider the Morse function on X. Let's denote this function as f: X → ℝ. Since X is a compact manifold, f will have a finite number of critical points, and we assume that they are all non-degenerate.\n\nThe Morse complex is given by the chain groups C_k = ⊕p∈Crit_k(f) ℤ, where Crit_k(f) is the set of critical points of index k, and the boundary operator ∂: C_k → C_(k-1) is defined using the negative gradient flow lines of f.\n\nFor the 2-torus, we have the following critical points:\n\n1. Two minima (index 0): These correspond to the two \"lowest\" points on the torus.\n2. Two saddle points (index 1): These correspond to the points where the torus \"bends\" in the middle.\n3. One maximum (index 2): This corresponds to the \"highest\" point on the torus.\n\nNow, we can compute the Morse homology groups H_k(X) as the homology of the Morse complex, i.e., H_k(X) = ker(∂_k) / im(∂_(k+1)).\n\nFor k = 0, we have ∂_0 = 0, so H_0(X) = ker(∂_0) / im(∂_1) = C_0 / im(∂_1) = ℤ^2 / im(∂_1). Since there are no gradient flow lines between the minima and the maximum, im(∂_1) = 0, and H_0(X) = ℤ^2.\n\nFor k = 1, we have H_1(X) = ker(∂_1) / im(∂_2). The boundary operator ∂_1 counts the number of gradient flow lines between the saddle points and the minima. Since there are two flow lines from each saddle point to each minimum, we have ∂_1 = 2. Thus, ker(∂_1) = ℤ^2. The boundary operator ∂_2 counts the number of gradient flow lines between the maximum and the saddle points. Since there are two flow lines from the maximum to each saddle point, we have ∂_2 = 2. Thus, im(∂_2) = ℤ^2. Therefore, H_1(X) = ker(∂_1) / im(∂_2) = ℤ^2 / ℤ^2 = ℤ.\n\nFor k = 2, we have ∂_2 = 2, so H_2(X) = ker(∂_2) / im(∂_3) = C_2 / im(∂_3) = ℤ / im(∂_3). Since there are no gradient flow lines between the maximum and any higher critical points, im(∂_3) = 0, and H_2(X) = ℤ.\n\nIn conclusion, the first non-zero Floer homology group of the 2-torus X = S1 x S1 is H_1(X) = ℤ."
