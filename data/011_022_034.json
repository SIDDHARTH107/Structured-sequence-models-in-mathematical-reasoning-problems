The weight and value of each item are listed below: \n\nItem 1: 2kg, $50 \nItem 2: 4kg, $70 \nItem 3: 5kg, $80 \nItem 4: 3kg, $60 \nItem 5: 1kg, $40 \n\nWhat is the optimal combination of items that the trader should select to maximize the total value while not exceeding the weight limit of the knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal combination of items, we can calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item and then try different combinations to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nValue-to-weight ratios:\nItem 1: $50/2kg = $25/kg\nItem 2: $70/4kg = $17.5/kg\nItem 3: $80/5kg = $16/kg\nItem 4: $60/3kg = $20/kg\nItem 5: $40/1kg = $40/kg\n\nNow we can try different combinations:\n\n1. Selecting items with the highest value-to-weight ratios (Item 5 and Item 1):\nTotal weight: 1kg + 2kg = 3kg\nTotal value: $40 + $50 = $90\n\n2. Selecting items with the next highest value-to-weight ratios (Item 5, Item 1, and Item 4):\nTotal weight: 1kg + 2kg + 3kg = 6kg\nTotal value: $40 + $50 + $60 = $150\n\n3. Selecting items with the next highest value-to-weight ratios (Item 5, Item 1, and Item 2):\nTotal weight: 1kg + 2kg + 4kg = 7kg\nTotal value: $40 + $50 + $70 = $160\n\n4. Selecting items with the next highest value-to-weight ratios (Item 5, Item 1, and Item 3):\nTotal weight: 1kg + 2kg + 5kg = 8kg\nTotal value: $40 + $50 + $80 = $170\n\n5. Selecting items with the next highest value-to-weight ratios (Item 5, Item 4, and Item 2):\nTotal weight: 1kg + 3kg + 4kg = 8kg\nTotal value: $40 + $60 + $70 = $170\n\n6. Selecting items with the next highest value-to-weight ratios (Item 5, Item 4, and Item 3):\nTotal weight: 1kg + 3kg + 5kg = 9kg\nTotal value: $40 + $60 + $80 = $180\n\n7. Selecting all items except Item 3:\nTotal weight: 1kg + 2kg + 4kg + 3kg = 10kg\nTotal value: $40 + $50 + $70 + $60 = $220\n\nThe optimal combination of items that the trader should select to maximize the total value while not exceeding the weight limit of the knapsack is Item 1, Item 2, Item 4, and Item 5, with a total weight of 10kg and a total value of $220."
