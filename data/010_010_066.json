    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x,y)$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is equal to the zero vector. The gradient of a function is given by the partial derivatives with respect to each variable. So, let's find the partial derivatives of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x - 4y\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 6y - 4x - 3\n$$\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of equations to find the critical points:\n\n$$\n2x - 4y = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n6y - 4x - 3 = 0\n$$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 and then adding the two equations:\n\n$$\n4x - 8y = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n6y - 4x - 3 = 0\n$$\n\nAdding the equations, we get:\n\n$$\n-2y - 3 = 0\n$$\n\nSolving for $y$, we find that $y = -\\frac{3}{2}$. Now, we can substitute this value of $y$ back into the first equation to find the value of $x$:\n\n$$\n2x - 4\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n2x + 6 = 0\n$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we find that $x = -3$. So, the critical point is $(-3, -\\frac{3}{2})$.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether this critical point corresponds to a maximum, minimum, or a saddle point. To do this, we will use the second derivative test. We need to find the second partial derivatives of $f(x,y)$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 6\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = -4\n$$\n\nNow, we will compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix, which is given by:\n\n$$\nD(x,y) = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= \\begin{vmatrix}\n2 & -4 \\\\\n-4 & 6\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= (2)(6) - (-4)(-4) = 12 - 16 = -4\n$$\n\nSince the determinant of the Hessian matrix is negative, the critical point $(-3, -\\frac{3}{2})$ corresponds to a saddle point."
