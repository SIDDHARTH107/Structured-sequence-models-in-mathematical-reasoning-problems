    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27, we will first analyze the structure of G using the Sylow theorems and then construct an isomorphism between G and the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nSince G has order 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G is either 1 or 27. If there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, then it is normal in G, and G is a p-group, which implies that the center of G is nontrivial. However, we are given that the center of G is trivial, so there must be 27 3-Sylow subgroups in G.\n\nLet P be a 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P has order 9, it is either isomorphic to Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3. If P is isomorphic to Z_9, then P has a unique subgroup of order 3, which is normal in P. Since P is normal in G, this subgroup of order 3 is also normal in G, which contradicts the fact that there are 27 3-Sylow subgroups in G. Therefore, P must be isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3.\n\nNow, let N be the normalizer of P in G. Since P is normal in N, we have a homomorphism φ: G → Aut(P) given by conjugation, where Aut(P) is the automorphism group of P. Note that Aut(P) is isomorphic to GL(2,3), the group of 2x2 invertible matrices over the field with 3 elements. The order of GL(2,3) is (3^2 - 1)(3^2 - 3) = 48.\n\nSince the center of G is trivial, the kernel of φ is trivial, and φ is an injective homomorphism. Thus, |G| divides |Aut(P)|, which implies that |G| = 27 divides 48, which is a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that the center of G is trivial must be false.\n\nNow, let's consider the non-abelian group of order 27, which can be represented as the group of upper triangular 3x3 matrices with 1's on the diagonal and elements from the field with 3 elements:\n\nH = {((1, a, b), (0, 1, c), (0, 0, 1)) | a, b, c ∈ F_3}\n\nThe group operation in H is matrix multiplication. It is easy to verify that H is a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nWe will now construct an isomorphism between G and H. Since G has a nontrivial center, there exists an element x in G of order 3 such that x is in the center of G. Let P = <x> be the cyclic subgroup generated by x. Since P is a normal subgroup of G, we can form the quotient group G/P.\n\nNow, consider the natural projection π: G → G/P. Since P is in the center of G, π induces an injective homomorphism ψ: G/P → Aut(P) by conjugation. Note that Aut(P) is isomorphic to Z_2, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\nSince G/P is a group of order 9, it is either isomorphic to Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3. If G/P is isomorphic to Z_9, then ψ(G/P) is a cyclic subgroup of Aut(P) of order 9, which is a contradiction since Aut(P) has order 2. Therefore, G/P must be isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3.\n\nNow, let y and z be elements in G such that their images in G/P under π form a basis for G/P as a vector space over F_3. Then, we can define an isomorphism Φ: G → H by sending x to the matrix ((1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)), y to the matrix ((1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 0, 1)), and z to the matrix ((1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)).\n\nIt is easy to verify that Φ is a homomorphism and is bijective, so G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27, as desired."
