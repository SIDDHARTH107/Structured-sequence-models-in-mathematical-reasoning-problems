    "message_2": "The area of the connected set of all points in the complex plane that remain bounded after applying the iterative function z_n+1 = z_n^2 + c, starting with z_0 = 0 and c being any point in the complex plane that lies within the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, is not known exactly. The Mandelbrot set is a fractal with a highly irregular boundary, which makes it difficult to calculate its area precisely.\n\nHowever, numerical approximations have been made to estimate the area of the Mandelbrot set. One such approximation is around 1.50659177 square units. This value is not exact and may vary depending on the level of precision used in the approximation method."
