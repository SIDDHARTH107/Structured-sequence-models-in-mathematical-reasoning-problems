    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to Analysis of variance (ANOVA):\n\nA researcher is studying the growth rate of three different types of plants (A, B, and C) under different light conditions. The researcher measures the height of 8 plants of each type under 3 different light conditions (low, medium, and high) and obtained the following data:\n\nType A: Low (15, 13, 14, 16, 12, 11, 14, 13), Medium (22, 24, 20, 23, 18, 21, 19, 20), High (30, 29, 31, 27, 32, 28, 26, 30)\nType B: Low (17, 20, 16, 19, 15, 18, 21, 20), Medium (25, 26, 24, 23, 27, 26, 26, 24), High (31, 32, 30, 33, 29, 30, 31, 33)\nType C: Low (20, 22, 21, 19, 18, 23, 20, 22), Medium (30, 28, 29, 31, 32, 30, 31, 29), High (35, 36, 34, 33, 35, 32, 36, 34)\n\nThe researcher wants to know if there is a significant difference in the growth rate of the three types of plants under different light conditions. Using ANOVA, determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the groups.",
    "message_2": "To perform an ANOVA test, we need to calculate the following values: total sum of squares (SST), sum of squares between groups (SSB), and sum of squares within groups (SSW). Then, we will calculate the F-statistic and compare it to the critical value from the F-distribution table to determine if there is a significant difference between the groups.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean of each group and the overall mean.\nType A: Low (µ_AL) = (15+13+14+16+12+11+14+13)/8 = 14\nType A: Medium (µ_AM) = (22+24+20+23+18+21+19+20)/8 = 21\nType A: High (µ_AH) = (30+29+31+27+32+28+26+30)/8 = 29.125\nType B: Low (µ_BL) = (17+20+16+19+15+18+21+20)/8 = 18.25\nType B: Medium (µ_BM) = (25+26+24+23+27+26+26+24)/8 = 25.125\nType B: High (µ_BH) = (31+32+30+33+29+30+31+33)/8 = 31.125\nType C: Low (µ_CL) = (20+22+21+19+18+23+20+22)/8 = 20.625\nType C: Medium (µ_CM) = (30+28+29+31+32+30+31+29)/8 = 30\nType C: High (µ_CH) = (35+36+34+33+35+32+36+34)/8 = 34.375\n\nOverall mean (µ) = (sum of all heights) / 72 = 24.875\n\nStep 2: Calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB).\nSSB = 8 * [ (µ_AL - µ)^2 + (µ_AM - µ)^2 + (µ_AH - µ)^2 + (µ_BL - µ)^2 + (µ_BM - µ)^2 + (µ_BH - µ)^2 + (µ_CL - µ)^2 + (µ_CM - µ)^2 + (µ_CH - µ)^2 ]\n\nSSB = 8 * [ (14 - 24.875)^2 + (21 - 24.875)^2 + (29.125 - 24.875)^2 + (18.25 - 24.875)^2 + (25.125 - 24.875)^2 + (31.125 - 24.875)^2 + (20.625 - 24.875)^2 + (30 - 24.875)^2 + (34.375 - 24.875)^2 ]\n\nSSB = 8 * [ 118.515625 + 15.015625 + 18.015625 + 43.890625 + 0.0625 + 39.015625 + 18.140625 + 26.265625 + 90.140625 ]\nSSB = 8 * 369.0625 = 2952.5\n\nStep 3: Calculate the sum of squares within groups (SSW).\nSSW = sum of (each height - corresponding group mean)^2\nFor example, for Type A Low group: (15-14)^2 + (13-14)^2 + ... + (13-14)^2\n\nSSW = 94 + 102 + 110.25 + 106 + 94.75 + 104.25 + 106.25 + 104.75\nSSW = 822.5\n\nStep 4: Calculate the degrees of freedom between groups (dfB) and within groups (dfW).\ndfB = number of groups - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8\ndfW = total number of observations - number of groups = 72 - 9 = 63\n\nStep 5: Calculate the mean square between groups (MSB) and within groups (MSW).\nMSB = SSB / dfB = 2952.5 / 8 = 369.0625\nMSW = SSW / dfW = 822.5 / 63 = 13.05556\n\nStep 6: Calculate the F-statistic.\nF = MSB / MSW = 369.0625 / 13.05556 = 28.27\n\nStep 7: Determine the critical value from the F-distribution table.\nUsing an alpha level of 0.05, we look up the critical value for F(8, 63) in the F-distribution table. The critical value is 2.15.\n\nStep 8: Compare the F-statistic to the critical value.\nSince the F-statistic (28.27) is greater than the critical value (2.15), we reject the null hypothesis. There is a statistically significant difference in the growth rate of the three types of plants under different light conditions."
