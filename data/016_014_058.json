    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal, and its length increases with each iteration. After each iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by a factor of √2.\n\nTo find the total length of the Lévy C curve after 5 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (√2)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we have 5 iterations:\n\nLength = 1 * (√2)^5\nLength ≈ 1 * 4.47214\nLength ≈ 4.47214 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Lévy C curve after 5 iterations is approximately 4.47214 units."
