    "message_1": "A company produces light bulbs that have an average life span of 1000 hours with a standard deviation of 100 hours. Assuming the life span follows a normal distribution, what percentage of the bulbs can be expected to last between 900 and 1100 hours?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of bulbs that can be expected to last between 900 and 1100 hours, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the values and then use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we'll find the z-scores for 900 and 1100 hours:\n\nz1 = (900 - 1000) / 100 = -1\nz2 = (1100 - 1000) / 100 = 1\n\nNow, we'll use the z-table to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores. The probability for z = -1 is 0.1587, and the probability for z = 1 is 0.8413.\n\nTo find the percentage of bulbs that last between 900 and 1100 hours, we'll subtract the probability for z = -1 from the probability for z = 1:\n\nPercentage = (0.8413 - 0.1587) * 100 = 68.26%\n\nSo, approximately 68.26% of the bulbs can be expected to last between 900 and 1100 hours."
