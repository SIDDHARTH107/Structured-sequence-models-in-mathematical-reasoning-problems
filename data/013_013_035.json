    "message_1": "Consider an auction where there are 3 bidders and 1 item for sale. The true valuations of the item for each bidder are as follows: \n\n- Bidder 1: $50\n- Bidder 2: $75\n- Bidder 3: $100\n\nAssuming the auction is a sealed-bid first-price auction, what is the optimal bidding strategy for each bidder and who will win the auction?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid first-price auction, bidders submit their bids secretly, and the highest bidder wins the item, paying the price they bid. The optimal bidding strategy for each bidder is to bid slightly higher than the highest valuation they believe their competitors might have, but lower than their own valuation to ensure they still gain some surplus from winning the auction.\n\nBidder 1's optimal strategy:\nSince Bidder 1's valuation is $50, they should bid slightly higher than what they think the highest valuation of the other bidders might be, but lower than $50. However, given the valuations of the other bidders, it is unlikely that Bidder 1 will win the auction.\n\nBidder 2's optimal strategy:\nBidder 2's valuation is $75. They should bid slightly higher than what they think the highest valuation of the other bidders might be, but lower than $75. If they believe Bidder 1's valuation is lower than theirs, they should focus on outbidding Bidder 3. For example, if they think Bidder 3's valuation is around $90, they could bid $91.\n\nBidder 3's optimal strategy:\nBidder 3's valuation is $100. They should bid slightly higher than what they think the highest valuation of the other bidders might be, but lower than $100. If they believe Bidder 2's valuation is around $75, they could bid $76.\n\nIn this scenario, Bidder 3 would win the auction with a bid of $76, assuming they have correctly estimated the valuations of the other bidders."
