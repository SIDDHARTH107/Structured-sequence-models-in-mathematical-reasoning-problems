    "message_1": "A company produces two types of lamps: desk lamps and floor lamps. The desk lamp requires 4 hours of assembly time and 2 hours of painting time, while the floor lamp requires 6 hours of assembly time and 3 hours of painting time. The company has 30 hours of assembly time and 18 hours of painting time available per day. The profit from a desk lamp is $20 and the profit from a floor lamp is $30. What is the maximum profit the company can earn in a day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of desk lamps and y be the number of floor lamps produced per day.\n\nThe constraints for the assembly and painting times can be represented as follows:\n\nAssembly time: 4x + 6y ≤ 30\nPainting time: 2x + 3y ≤ 18\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 20x + 30y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n4x + 6y ≤ 30\n2x + 3y ≤ 18\n\nDivide the first inequality by 2:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 15\n\nNow we have two inequalities:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 15\n2x + 3y ≤ 18\n\nSince the first inequality is more restrictive, we will use it to find the feasible region.\n\nTo find the feasible region, we will find the intercepts of the inequality:\n\nWhen x = 0:\n2(0) + 3y ≤ 15\ny ≤ 5\n\nWhen y = 0:\n2x + 3(0) ≤ 15\nx ≤ 7.5\n\nThe feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 5), and (7.5, 0).\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. Vertex (0, 0):\nProfit = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n\n2. Vertex (0, 5):\nProfit = 20(0) + 30(5) = $150\n\n3. Vertex (7.5, 0):\nProfit = 20(7.5) + 30(0) = $150\n\nThe maximum profit the company can earn in a day is $150."
