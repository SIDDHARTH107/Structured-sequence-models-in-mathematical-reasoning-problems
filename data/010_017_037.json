    "message_2": "To find the lower bound for the number of critical points of a smooth real-valued function f: X → R on a two-dimensional torus T²(r), we can use Morse inequalities. Morse inequalities relate the number of critical points of a smooth function to the topology of the underlying manifold.\n\nFor a two-dimensional torus, the Betti numbers are b₀ = 1, b₁ = 2, and b₂ = 1. The Betti numbers represent the ranks of the homology groups of the manifold, which give information about its topological structure.\n\nMorse inequalities state that for a smooth function f with a finite number of non-degenerate critical points, the number of critical points of index k (denoted by m_k) satisfies:\n\nm_k ≥ b_k\n\nwhere b_k is the k-th Betti number of the manifold.\n\nFor the two-dimensional torus T²(r), we have:\n\nm₀ ≥ b₀ = 1\nm₁ ≥ b₁ = 2\nm₂ ≥ b₂ = 1\n\nThe total number of critical points is given by the sum of the critical points of each index:\n\nm = m₀ + m₁ + m₂\n\nUsing the lower bounds from the Morse inequalities, we have:\n\nm ≥ 1 + 2 + 1 = 4\n\nTherefore, the lower bound for the number of critical points of a smooth real-valued function f: X → R on a two-dimensional torus T²(r) is 4."
