    "message_2": "To solve this system of equations with complex numbers, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the second equation by 2 and subtract the first equation from the result to eliminate x:\n\n2(x + 2y + 3z) - (2x + 3y + 4z) = 2(4 - i) - (5 + 3i)\n2x + 4y + 6z - 2x - 3y - 4z = 8 - 2i - 5 - 3i\ny + 2z = 3 - 5i\n\nNow, let's multiply the second equation by 4 and subtract the third equation from the result to eliminate x:\n\n4(x + 2y + 3z) - (4x + 5y + 6z) = 4(4 - i) - (7 + 2i)\n4x + 8y + 12z - 4x - 5y - 6z = 16 - 4i - 7 - 2i\n3y + 6z = 9 - 6i\n\nNow, let's divide the last equation by 3:\n\ny + 2z = 3 - 2i\n\nWe can see that this equation is the same as the one we got after eliminating x. So, we have two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\ny + 2z = 3 - 5i\ny + 2z = 3 - 2i\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate y:\n\n(3 - 2i) - (3 - 5i) = 0\n3i\n\nSince this equation is not true (3i â‰  0), we can conclude that there is no solution for this system of equations. The system is inconsistent."
