Evaluate the integral:\n\n∫C (z^2 + 1)/(z^2 - 2z + 2) dz\n\nwhere dz denotes the differential element of arc length on C, traversed in the counterclockwise sense.\n\nNote: The math student needs to apply the residue theorem in complex analysis to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the residue theorem from complex analysis. The residue theorem states that for a function with isolated singularities inside a simple closed contour, the integral of the function over the contour is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function at its singularities inside the contour.\n\nFirst, we need to find the singularities of the given function:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z^2 - 2z + 2)\n\nThe singularities occur when the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 - 2z + 2 = 0\n\nTo find the roots of this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = ( -b ± √(b^2 - 4ac) ) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = 2:\n\nz = ( 2 ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(2)) ) / 2(1)\nz = ( 2 ± √(4 - 8) ) / 2\nz = ( 2 ± √(-4) ) / 2\nz = ( 2 ± 2i ) / 2\n\nSo, the singularities are z = 1 + i and z = 1 - i.\n\nNow, we need to determine if these singularities are inside the unit circle. The distance from the origin to each singularity is:\n\n|1 + i| = √(1^2 + 1^2) = √2\n|1 - i| = √(1^2 + (-1)^2) = √2\n\nSince √2 > 1, both singularities are outside the unit circle. Therefore, there are no singularities of f(z) inside the unit circle.\n\nAccording to the residue theorem, the integral of f(z) over the unit circle is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function at its singularities inside the contour. Since there are no singularities inside the unit circle, the sum of the residues is zero, and the integral is:\n\n∫C (z^2 + 1)/(z^2 - 2z + 2) dz = 2πi * 0 = 0"
