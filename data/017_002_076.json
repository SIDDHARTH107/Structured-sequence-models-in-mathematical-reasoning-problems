    "message_2": "Since G is a cyclic group of order 24, there exists an element g in G such that G = ⟨g⟩, where ⟨g⟩ denotes the subgroup generated by g. The order of g is 24, which means g^24 = e (the identity element), and no smaller positive power of g is equal to e.\n\nNow, let H be a subgroup of G with order 8. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. Since the order of H is 8 and 8 divides 24, H is a valid subgroup of G.\n\nTo show that H is cyclic, we will use the fact that a group of order p^n, where p is a prime number, is always cyclic. In this case, the order of H is 8, which can be written as 2^3 (p^n form, with p = 2 and n = 3). Since 2 is a prime number, H must be a cyclic group.\n\nNow, we need to find a generator for H. Since H is a subgroup of G, there must be an element h in H such that h is a power of g. We will find the smallest positive integer k such that the order of g^k is 8.\n\nRecall that the order of an element in a cyclic group divides the order of the group. In this case, the order of g^k must divide 24. The possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. We are looking for an element with order 8, so we can eliminate the other possibilities.\n\nBy the formula for the order of powers of elements in a cyclic group, the order of g^k is 24/gcd(24, k), where gcd denotes the greatest common divisor. We want the order of g^k to be 8, so we need to find the smallest positive integer k such that 24/gcd(24, k) = 8.\n\nLet's test some values of k:\n\n1. gcd(24, 1) = 1, so the order of g^1 is 24/1 = 24.\n2. gcd(24, 2) = 2, so the order of g^2 is 24/2 = 12.\n3. gcd(24, 3) = 3, so the order of g^3 is 24/3 = 8.\n\nWe found that the smallest positive integer k such that the order of g^k is 8 is k = 3. Therefore, the generator for the subgroup H is g^3, and H = ⟨g^3⟩."
