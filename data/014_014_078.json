    "message_1": "In Playfair Cipher encryption, we use a 5x5 matrix to map each pair of letters from the plaintext to a pair of letters in the ciphertext. If the plaintext message is \"MATHS IS FUN\" and the key for the matrix is \"CRYPTO\", what is the ciphertext message?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to create the 5x5 matrix using the key \"CRYPTO\". We will remove any duplicate letters from the key and fill in the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding 'J', as it's combined with 'I' in the Playfair cipher).\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: \"CRYPTO\" -> \"CRYPTO\"\n2. Fill in the rest of the alphabet: \"CRYPTOABDFGHIKLMNQSUVWXZ\"\n\nNow, we create the 5x5 matrix:\n\nC R Y P T\nO A B D F\nG H I K L\nM N Q S U\nV W X Z\n\nNext, we need to divide the plaintext message \"MATHS IS FUN\" into pairs of letters. If a pair has the same letter, we insert an 'X' between them. Also, we remove spaces and add an 'X' at the end if the number of letters is odd.\n\nMATHSISFUN -> MATHSISFXUN\n\nNow, we divide the message into pairs: MA TH SI SF XU N\n\nNow, we apply the Playfair cipher rules to each pair:\n\n1. If both letters are in the same row, replace each with the letter to the right (wrap around if needed):\n   MA -> CR\n\n2. If both letters are in the same column, replace each with the letter below (wrap around if needed):\n   TH -> GS\n\n3. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each with the letter in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle:\n   SI -> YD\n   SF -> KI\n   XU -> AB\n\nNow, we combine the encrypted pairs: CR GS YD KI AB\n\nSo, the ciphertext message is \"CRGSYDKIAB\"."
