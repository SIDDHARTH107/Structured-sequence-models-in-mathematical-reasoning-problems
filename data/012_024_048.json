    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 10 and E = 15. We need to find the maximum number of faces F that can be formed in the graph G.\n\nAccording to the Handshaking lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges:\n\nÎ£(deg(v)) = 2E\n\nSince G is a simple graph, the maximum degree of any vertex is V - 1. Therefore, the maximum sum of degrees for all vertices is (V - 1) * V = 9 * 10 = 90.\n\nNow, we can find the maximum number of faces F:\n\n2E = 2 * 15 = 30\n\nSince each face must have at least 3 edges, the maximum number of faces F is:\n\nF_max = 30 / 3 = 10\n\nNow we can use Euler's formula to find the genus of the graph G:\n\n10 - 15 + F = 2 - 2g\n\nWe know that F <= 10, so we can find the minimum value of g:\n\n10 - 15 + 10 = 2 - 2g\n5 = 2 - 2g\ng = (2 - 5) / (-2)\ng = 3 / 2\n\nSince the genus must be an integer, we round up to the nearest integer:\n\ng = 2\n\nTherefore, the genus of the graph G is 2."
