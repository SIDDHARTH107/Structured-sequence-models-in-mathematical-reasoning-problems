    "message_2": "To find the order of the zero of f at z = i, we need to determine the smallest positive integer n such that the function f(z) can be written as (z - i)^n * g(z), where g(z) is a holomorphic function that is nonzero at z = i.\n\nLet's rewrite the function f(z) as follows:\n\nf(z) = z^3/(z-i)^5 = (z-i + i)^3/((z-i)^5)\n\nNow, let's expand the numerator using the binomial theorem:\n\n(z-i + i)^3 = (z-i)^3 + 3i(z-i)^2 + 3i^2(z-i) + i^3\n\nSince i^2 = -1 and i^3 = -i, we can simplify the expression:\n\n(z-i)^3 - 3i(z-i)^2 - 3(z-i) - i\n\nNow, let's rewrite f(z) using this expanded form:\n\nf(z) = ((z-i)^3 - 3i(z-i)^2 - 3(z-i) - i)/((z-i)^5)\n\nNow, we can factor out (z - i) from the numerator:\n\nf(z) = (z - i)((z-i)^2 - 3i(z-i) - 3 - i)/((z-i)^5)\n\nNow, let's define g(z) = (z-i)^2 - 3i(z-i) - 3 - i. We can see that g(i) = (i-i)^2 - 3i(i-i) - 3 - i = -3 - i, which is nonzero. Therefore, g(z) is a holomorphic function that is nonzero at z = i.\n\nThus, we can write f(z) as (z - i)^1 * g(z), and the order of the zero of f at z = i is 1."
