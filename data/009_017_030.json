    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the Maxwell's equations in a vacuum:\n\n1. Gauss's law for electric fields: ∇ • E = ρ/ε₀\n2. Gauss's law for magnetic fields: ∇ • B = 0\n3. Faraday's law: ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t\n4. Ampere's law with Maxwell's addition: ∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t\n\nSince we have a current source of 10 A located at the origin, we can assume that the current density J is in the form of a delta function:\n\nJ(r) = 10 * δ(r)\n\nNow, we need to find the electric and magnetic fields at the point (2,3,4) for a time interval of 0 to 5 seconds. Since the current is steady, the electric field E will be zero. Therefore, we only need to find the magnetic field B.\n\nUsing the Biot-Savart law, we can find the magnetic field B due to a current source:\n\nB(r) = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(J(r') × (r - r') / |r - r'|³) dr'\n\nSince J(r) is a delta function, the integral will only be non-zero at the origin:\n\nB(r) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (10 * (r × (-r) / |r|³))\n\nNow, we can plug in the coordinates of the point (2,3,4):\n\nr = (2,3,4)\n|r| = √(2² + 3² + 4²) = √29\n\nB(r) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (10 * ((2,3,4) × (-2,-3,-4) / (29)^(3/2)))\n\nB(r) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (10 * (0,0,0) / (29)^(3/2))\n\nB(r) = (0,0,0)\n\nSo, the magnetic field B at the point (2,3,4) is zero for the given time interval of 0 to 5 seconds.\n\nIn conclusion, the electric field E at the point (2,3,4) is zero, and the magnetic field B at the point (2,3,4) is also zero for the time interval of 0 to 5 seconds."
