    "message_2": "To show that there exists a section of L which does not vanish at p, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem for a non-singular projective curve X states that for any line bundle L on X,\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere h^i(X, L) denotes the dimension of the cohomology group H^i(X, L), deg(L) is the degree of L, and g is the genus of X.\n\nSince H^0(X, L) = H^1(X, L) = 0, we have h^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = 0. Therefore, by the Riemann-Roch theorem, we get\n\n0 = deg(L) + 1 - g.\n\nNow, let L' be the line bundle L(-p), which is the tensor product of L with the inverse of the line bundle associated to the divisor p. Then, deg(L') = deg(L) - 1.\n\nApplying the Riemann-Roch theorem to L', we have\n\nh^0(X, L') - h^1(X, L') = deg(L') + 1 - g = deg(L) - g.\n\nSince deg(L) = g - 1, we get h^0(X, L') - h^1(X, L') = 1. We know that h^1(X, L') = h^0(X, L(-p)) = 0, as L' is the dual of L(-p) and H^1(X, L) = 0. Therefore, h^0(X, L') = 1, which means there exists a non-zero global section s of L'.\n\nNow, consider the section s' = s ⊗ 1_p of L, where 1_p is the section of the line bundle associated to the divisor p that vanishes exactly at p. Since s is a non-zero section of L', s' is a non-zero section of L. Moreover, s'(p) = s(p) ⊗ 1_p(p) = s(p) ⊗ 0 = 0, so s' vanishes at p.\n\nFinally, let s'' be another non-zero global section of L. Then, s'' - s' is also a global section of L, and (s'' - s')(p) = s''(p) - s'(p) = s''(p) ≠ 0, since s'(p) = 0. Thus, there exists a section of L which does not vanish at p, as required."
