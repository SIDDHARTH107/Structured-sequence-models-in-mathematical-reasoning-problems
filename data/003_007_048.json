    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C, respectively. In this case, we have a = 6, b = 9, and c = 11. We want to find the smallest angle, which will be opposite the shortest side (a = 6). So, we need to find angle A.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc * cos(A)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for cos(A):\n\ncos(A) = (b^2 + c^2 - a^2) / (2bc)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ncos(A) = (9^2 + 11^2 - 6^2) / (2 * 9 * 11)\ncos(A) = (81 + 121 - 36) / (198)\ncos(A) = (166) / (198)\ncos(A) ≈ 0.8384\n\nNow, we need to find the angle A by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nA = arccos(0.8384)\nA ≈ 33.1°\n\nTherefore, the measure of the smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 33°."
