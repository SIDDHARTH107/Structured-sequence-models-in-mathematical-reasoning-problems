    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} and B = {3}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, then find the Cartesian product of B and A. Show that the union of the first product is not equal to the union of the second product.",
    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. \n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nThe Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B x A, is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A.\n\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of the first product (A x B) and the second product (B x A). The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either of the sets.\n\nUnion of (A x B) and (B x A) = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the union of the first product (A x B) is not equal to the union of the second product (B x A). The union of the first product contains the ordered pairs (1, 3) and (2, 3), while the union of the second product contains the ordered pairs (3, 1) and (3, 2)."
