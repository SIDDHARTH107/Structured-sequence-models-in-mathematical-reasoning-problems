    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B, each requiring different amounts of resources such as labor, raw material, and machine time. To maximize profit, the company wants to determine the optimal production quantities for both products that will yield the highest profit. The profit for product A is 20 dollars per unit and for product B is 30 dollars per unit. The company has 200 units of labor, 1000 units of raw material, and 150 units of machine time available for production. \n\nUsing Differential Evolution optimization technique, determine the optimal quantities of products A and B that will maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "Differential Evolution (DE) is an optimization technique that is used to find the global minimum or maximum of a function. It is a population-based algorithm that uses mutation, crossover, and selection to evolve the population towards the optimal solution. In this case, we want to maximize the profit function given the constraints on labor, raw material, and machine time.\n\nLet x be the quantity of product A and y be the quantity of product B. The profit function to be maximized is:\n\nP(x, y) = 20x + 30y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nLabor: L(x, y) = l1 * x + l2 * y <= 200\nRaw material: R(x, y) = r1 * x + r2 * y <= 1000\nMachine time: M(x, y) = m1 * x + m2 * y <= 150\n\nwhere l1, l2, r1, r2, m1, and m2 are the units of labor, raw material, and machine time required to produce one unit of product A and B, respectively.\n\nTo apply DE, we need to define the objective function, constraints, and the bounds for the decision variables. Let's assume the following values for the required resources:\n\nl1 = 2, l2 = 3\nr1 = 5, r2 = 10\nm1 = 1, m2 = 2\n\nNow, we can use a Python library called \"scipy\" to implement the DE algorithm and find the optimal solution.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import differential_evolution\n\ndef profit(x):\n    return -(20 * x[0] + 30 * x[1])\n\ndef labor_constraint(x):\n    return 200 - (2 * x[0] + 3 * x[1])\n\ndef raw_material_constraint(x):\n    return 1000 - (5 * x[0] + 10 * x[1])\n\ndef machine_time_constraint(x):\n    return 150 - (1 * x[0] + 2 * x[1])\n\nbounds = [(0, 100), (0, 100)]\n\nconstraints = (\n    {\"type\": \"ineq\", \"fun\": labor_constraint},\n    {\"type\": \"ineq\", \"fun\": raw_material_constraint},\n    {\"type\": \"ineq\", \"fun\": machine_time_constraint},\n)\n\nresult = differential_evolution(profit, bounds, constraints=constraints, seed=42)\n\noptimal_quantities = result.x\noptimal_profit = -result.fun\n\nprint(\"Optimal quantities of products A and B:\", optimal_quantities)\nprint(\"Maximum profit:\", optimal_profit)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the optimal quantities of products A and B and the maximum profit. Note that the actual values may vary depending on the DE algorithm's parameters and the random seed."
