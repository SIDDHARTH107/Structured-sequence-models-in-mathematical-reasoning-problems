    "message_2": "In fuzzy logic, the degree of membership represents the extent to which an element belongs to a fuzzy set. In this case, the fuzzy set is the acceptable range of widget weights, which is between 95 and 105 grams. The degree of membership ranges from 0 (completely outside the acceptable range) to 1 (completely within the acceptable range).\n\nTo determine the degree of membership for a widget with a weight of 92 grams, we can use a linear function that maps the widget weight to the degree of membership. Since the acceptable range is ±5 grams, we can define two points on this linear function:\n\n1. (95, 1) - A widget with a weight of 95 grams has a degree of membership of 1 (completely within the acceptable range).\n2. (90, 0) - A widget with a weight of 90 grams has a degree of membership of 0 (completely outside the acceptable range).\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the line that passes through these two points:\n\nSlope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (0 - 1) / (90 - 95) = 1 / 5\n\nUsing the point-slope form of a linear equation (y - y1 = m(x - x1)), we can plug in one of the points (95, 1) and the slope (m = 1/5) to find the equation:\n\ny - 1 = (1/5)(x - 95)\n\nNow, we can plug in the weight of the widget (92 grams) as x to find the degree of membership (y):\n\ny - 1 = (1/5)(92 - 95)\ny - 1 = (1/5)(-3)\ny - 1 = -3/5\ny = 1 - 3/5\ny = 2/5\n\nSo, the degree of membership for a widget with a weight of 92 grams is 2/5 or 0.4."
