    "message_2": "To find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0, we can use the factoring method.\n\nThe equation can be factored as (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0.\n\nNow, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\nx - 3 = 0 => x = 3\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 are x = 2 and x = 3."
