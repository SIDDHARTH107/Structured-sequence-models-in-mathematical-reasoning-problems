    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to one of the groups C8, Q8, or D4, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems and the properties of groups of order 8.\n\nFirst, we note that the order of G is 8, which is a power of a prime number (2^3). By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G (denoted by n_2) must divide the order of G and satisfy n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The only possibilities for n_2 are 1 and 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, then it must be normal in G. Let P be this normal Sylow 2-subgroup. Since the order of P is 2^3 = 8, we have that P = G. Thus, G is a p-group, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C8, C4 × C2, or C2 × C2 × C2.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to C8, then we are done. If G is isomorphic to C4 × C2 or C2 × C2 × C2, then G has an element of order 4. Let a be an element of order 4 in G. Then, the subgroup H = ⟨a⟩ has order 4 and is normal in G (since the index of H in G is 2). Let b be an element in G not in H. Then, G = H ∪ {b} and |G| = |H| + |{b}| = 4 + 1 = 5, which is a contradiction. Thus, G cannot be isomorphic to C4 × C2 or C2 × C2 × C2.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 4\nIf there are four Sylow 2-subgroups, then each of them has order 8/2 = 4. Let P1, P2, P3, and P4 be these Sylow 2-subgroups. Since the intersection of any two distinct Sylow p-subgroups is trivial, we have that |P1 ∩ P2| = 1 for any distinct P1 and P2. Thus, each Pi has 3 non-identity elements, and since there are 4 such subgroups, we have a total of 4 × 3 = 12 non-identity elements in these subgroups. However, G has only 8 - 1 = 7 non-identity elements, which is a contradiction. Thus, there cannot be four Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nSince neither case leads to a valid structure for G, we conclude that G must be isomorphic to C8.\n\nNow, we will show that G can also be isomorphic to Q8 or D4. The quaternion group Q8 has order 8 and is given by Q8 = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}, with the relations i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. The dihedral group D4 has order 8 and is given by D4 = {r^n s^m | n = 0, 1, 2, 3; m = 0, 1}, with the relations r^4 = s^2 = 1 and sr = r^3 s. Both Q8 and D4 are non-abelian groups of order 8, and they are not isomorphic to each other.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that G can be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C8, Q8, or D4."
