    "message_2": "First, we need to find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted by A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1, 2} (elements in A but not in B)\nB - A = {5, 6} (elements in B but not in A)\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2} ∪ {5, 6} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of (A ∆ B) and {3, 4}, which is denoted by (A ∆ B) ∩ {3, 4}. The intersection is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∩ {3, 4} = ∅\n\nThe intersection of (A ∆ B) and {3, 4} is the empty set, denoted by ∅, which means there are no common elements between these two sets."
