If $M$ is a sphere, then $H^2_{dR}(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$:\n\nIf $M$ is a sphere, then $M \\cong S^2$. We know that the De Rham cohomology groups of $S^2$ are given by:\n\n$H^0_{dR}(S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, $H^1_{dR}(S^2) \\cong 0$, and $H^2_{dR}(S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThus, if $M$ is a sphere, then $H^2_{dR}(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2. If $H^2_{dR}(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, then $M$ is a sphere:\n\nWe will use the fact that for a compact, connected, orientable surface $M$ embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$ is related to the De Rham cohomology groups by:\n\n$\\chi(M) = \\dim H^0_{dR}(M) - \\dim H^1_{dR}(M) + \\dim H^2_{dR}(M)$.\n\nSince $H^2_{dR}(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, we have $\\dim H^2_{dR}(M) = 1$. Also, as $M$ is connected, we have $\\dim H^0_{dR}(M) = 1$. Thus, the Euler characteristic is given by:\n\n$\\chi(M) = 1 - \\dim H^1_{dR}(M) + 1$.\n\nNow, we know that for a compact, connected, orientable surface, the Euler characteristic is related to the genus $g$ of the surface by $\\chi(M) = 2 - 2g$. Combining these equations, we get:\n\n$2 - 2g = 2 - \\dim H^1_{dR}(M)$.\n\nThis implies that $\\dim H^1_{dR}(M) = 2g$. Since $H^1_{dR}(M)$ is a vector space, its dimension must be non-negative. Thus, we have two cases:\n\na) $\\dim H^1_{dR}(M) = 0$: In this case, $g = 0$, and $M$ is a sphere.\n\nb) $\\dim H^1_{dR}(M) > 0$: In this case, $g > 0$, and $M$ is not a sphere.\n\nHowever, we are given that $H^2_{dR}(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, which implies that $\\dim H^2_{dR}(M) = 1$. This is only possible in case (a), where $M$ is a sphere.\n\nThus, if $H^2_{dR}(M) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, then $M$ is a sphere.\n\nIn conclusion, the De Rham cohomology group $H^2_{dR}(M)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ if and only if $M$ is a sphere."
