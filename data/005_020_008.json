    "message_2": "To estimate the expected value of X using Monte Carlo simulation, we will generate 10,000 random samples from the given probability density function f(x) = 2x for 0 < x < 1, and then calculate the average of these samples.\n\nFirst, we need to find the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of f(x). The CDF, F(x), is the integral of f(x) from 0 to x:\n\nF(x) = ∫(2x)dx from 0 to x = x^2, for 0 < x < 1\n\nNow, we will generate 10,000 random uniform samples (u_i) between 0 and 1, and then use the inverse of the CDF to find the corresponding x values (x_i):\n\nx_i = F^(-1)(u_i) = sqrt(u_i)\n\nFinally, we will calculate the average of these x_i values to estimate E(X):\n\nE(X) ≈ (1/10000) * Σ(x_i)\n\nHere's a Python code to perform the Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nn_samples = 10000\nu = np.random.uniform(0, 1, n_samples)\nx = np.sqrt(u)\nestimated_ex = np.mean(x)\n\nprint(\"Estimated E(X):\", estimated_ex)\n```\n\nRun the code to get the estimated expected value of X. Note that the true expected value of X can be calculated analytically as follows:\n\nE(X) = ∫(x * f(x))dx from 0 to 1 = ∫(2x^2)dx from 0 to 1 = (2/3)x^3 from 0 to 1 = 2/3\n\nThe Monte Carlo simulation should give an estimate close to the true value of 2/3."
