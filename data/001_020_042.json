    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |5x + 2| = 13, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The expression inside the absolute value is positive or zero, i.e., 5x + 2 â‰¥ 0.\nIn this case, we can directly write the equation as:\n5x + 2 = 13\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n5x = 13 - 2\n5x = 11\nx = 11/5\n\nSo, in this case, x = 11/5.\n\nCase 2: The expression inside the absolute value is negative, i.e., 5x + 2 < 0.\nIn this case, we can write the equation as:\n-(5x + 2) = 13\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n-5x - 2 = 13\n-5x = 13 + 2\n-5x = 15\nx = -15/5\nx = -3\n\nSo, in this case, x = -3.\n\nTherefore, the values of x that satisfy the equation |5x + 2| = 13 are x = 11/5 and x = -3."
