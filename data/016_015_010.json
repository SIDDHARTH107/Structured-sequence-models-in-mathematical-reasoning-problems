    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve that fills a square grid. The length of the Hilbert curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = n * 2^(n-1)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, we have a 2D space with a side of 4 units. To cover all points in this space, we need a Hilbert curve of order 2 (since 2^2 = 4). Now, we can calculate the length:\n\nLength = 2 * 2^(2-1)\nLength = 2 * 2^1\nLength = 2 * 2\nLength = 4\n\nSo, the total length of the Hilbert curve that passes through all points in a 2D space with a side of 4 units, including the starting and ending points, is 4 units."
