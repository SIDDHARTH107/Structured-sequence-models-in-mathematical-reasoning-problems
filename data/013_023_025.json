    "message_1": "In a Trust Game, Player 1 is given $10 and can choose to either keep it all or send some or all of it to Player 2. Whatever is sent to Player 2 is tripled. Player 2 then has the option to keep it all or send some or all of it back to Player 1. Determine the optimal strategy for both players to maximize their payoff. If both players follow their optimal strategy, what will be the final payouts for Player 1 and Player 2?",
    "message_2": "In the Trust Game, the optimal strategy for both players to maximize their payoff depends on their trust and cooperation. Assuming both players are rational and want to maximize their payoffs, the optimal strategy would be:\n\n1. Player 1 sends the entire $10 to Player 2. This is because Player 1 knows that the amount sent will be tripled, and if Player 2 is also rational and wants to maximize their payoff, they will send some of it back to Player 1.\n\n2. Player 2 receives the $10 from Player 1, which is tripled to $30. To maximize their payoff, Player 2 should send back an amount that is fair and encourages Player 1's trust. A common choice in this situation is to split the $30 evenly, sending $15 back to Player 1.\n\nIf both players follow this optimal strategy, the final payouts will be:\n\n- Player 1: $15\n- Player 2: $15"
