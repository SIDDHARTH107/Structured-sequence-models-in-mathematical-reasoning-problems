    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n110, 110, 112, 113, 115, 116, 118, 119, 120, 121\n\nNext, we find the median (Q2), lower quartile (Q1), and upper quartile (Q3):\n\nQ1: The median of the lower half (110, 110, 112, 113, 115) is 112.\nQ2: The median of the entire dataset (110, 110, 112, 113, 115, 116, 118, 119, 120, 121) is 115.5.\nQ3: The median of the upper half (116, 118, 119, 120, 121) is 119.\n\nNow, we calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 119 - 112 = 7\n\nNext, we find the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\n\nLower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 112 - 1.5 * 7 = 112 - 10.5 = 101.5\nUpper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 119 + 1.5 * 7 = 119 + 10.5 = 129.5\n\nFinally, we check if there are any outliers in the dataset:\n\nAll the weights (110, 110, 112, 113, 115, 116, 118, 119, 120, 121) are within the lower and upper bounds (101.5 and 129.5), so there are no outliers in the dataset."
