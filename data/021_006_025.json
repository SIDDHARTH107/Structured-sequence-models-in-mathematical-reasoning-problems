    "message_2": "To solve the given one-dimensional partial differential equation using the finite element method, we will discretize the spatial domain and time domain. Let's start by discretizing the spatial domain using a step size of h = 0.2. This will give us the following points:\n\nx = [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1]\n\nNow, let's discretize the time domain using a time step of k = 0.01 from time 0 to time 0.5. This will give us the following time steps:\n\nt = [0, 0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.5]\n\nNow, we will create a matrix U with dimensions (6, 51) to store the values of u(x,t) at each point in the spatial and time domains. We will initialize the matrix with the boundary conditions:\n\nU(1,:) = 0 and U(6,:) = 5\n\nNext, we will use the finite element method to approximate the solution at each time step. We will use the central difference method to approximate the second derivative of u with respect to x:\n\n∂²u/∂x² ≈ (u(x+h,t) - 2*u(x,t) + u(x-h,t))/h²\n\nNow, we will iterate through the time steps and update the values of u(x,t) using the given partial differential equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = 0.1 * ∂²u/∂x² - 2\n\nu(x,t+k) = u(x,t) + k * (0.1 * ∂²u/∂x² - 2)\n\nAfter iterating through all the time steps, we will have the approximate solution to the given partial differential equation at each point in the spatial and time domains. The final matrix U will contain the values of u(x,t) at each point."
