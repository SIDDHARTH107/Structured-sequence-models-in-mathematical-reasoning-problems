    "message_1": "A company has a production line that can produce 160 units per day. There are four different products that can be produced on this line, and they all have varying production times and profit margins. The production times and profit margins for each product are:\n\nProduct 1: Production time of 2 hours per unit, profit margin of $30 per unit. \nProduct 2: Production time of 1.5 hours per unit, profit margin of $45 per unit. \nProduct 3: Production time of 1 hour per unit, profit margin of $20 per unit. \nProduct 4: Production time of 3 hours per unit, profit margin of $50 per unit.\n\nAssuming that the company wants to maximize its profits, what is the optimal number of units of each product that should be produced in a day?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profits, we need to determine the profit per hour for each product. We can calculate this by dividing the profit margin by the production time for each product.\n\nProduct 1: $30 / 2 hours = $15 per hour\nProduct 2: $45 / 1.5 hours = $30 per hour\nProduct 3: $20 / 1 hour = $20 per hour\nProduct 4: $50 / 3 hours = $16.67 per hour\n\nNow, we need to prioritize the production of products based on their profit per hour. The order of priority is: Product 2, Product 3, Product 4, and Product 1.\n\nThe production line can produce 160 units per day, and there are 24 hours in a day. So, the total production time available per day is 160 units * 24 hours = 3840 hours.\n\nWe will now allocate the production time to each product based on their priority:\n\n1. Product 2: Since it has the highest profit per hour, we will produce as many units as possible. The production time for one unit is 1.5 hours. So, we can produce 3840 hours / 1.5 hours = 2560 units. However, the production line can only produce 160 units per day. So, we will produce 160 units of Product 2.\n\n2. Product 3: After producing 160 units of Product 2, there is no more capacity left on the production line for the day. Therefore, no units of Product 3, Product 4, or Product 1 will be produced.\n\nSo, the optimal number of units to produce for each product in a day is:\nProduct 1: 0 units\nProduct 2: 160 units\nProduct 3: 0 units\nProduct 4: 0 units"
