    "message_1": "A student standing 20 meters away from the base of a building looks up at an angle of elevation of 45 degrees to see the top of the building. What is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the student to the building (20 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (which we want to find).\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(45) = height / 20\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = height / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the building:\n\nheight = 20 * 1\n\nheight = 20 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is 20 meters."
