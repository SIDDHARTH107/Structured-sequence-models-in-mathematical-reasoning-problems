    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance between node A and node C using Dijkstra's algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every node: set it to zero for the initial node (A) and infinity for all other nodes (B, C, D, E, F).\n2. Set the initial node (A) as the current node.\n3. For the current node, consider all its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the new value if it is less than the current assigned value.\n4. When all neighbors of the current node have been considered, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will never be checked again.\n5. Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new current node, then go back to step 3. If all nodes have been visited, the algorithm has finished.\n\nApplying Dijkstra's algorithm to the given graph:\n\n1. Tentative distances: A=0, B=∞, C=∞, D=∞, E=∞, F=∞\n2. Current node: A\n3. Neighbors of A: B, D, E. Update tentative distances: B=5, D=3, E=2, C=∞, F=∞\n4. Mark A as visited.\n5. Smallest unvisited node: E. Set E as the current node.\n\n1. Tentative distances: A=0, B=5, C=∞, D=3, E=2, F=∞\n2. Current node: E\n3. Neighbors of E: A, D, F. Update tentative distances: B=5, D=3, C=∞, F=4\n4. Mark E as visited.\n5. Smallest unvisited node: D. Set D as the current node.\n\n1. Tentative distances: A=0, B=5, C=∞, D=3, E=2, F=4\n2. Current node: D\n3. Neighbors of D: A, B, E, C. Update tentative distances: B=5, C=6, F=4\n4. Mark D as visited.\n5. Smallest unvisited node: B. Set B as the current node.\n\n1. Tentative distances: A=0, B=5, C=6, D=3, E=2, F=4\n2. Current node: B\n3. Neighbors of B: A, D, C. Update tentative distances: C=6, F=4\n4. Mark B as visited.\n5. Smallest unvisited node: F. Set F as the current node.\n\n1. Tentative distances: A=0, B=5, C=6, D=3, E=2, F=4\n2. Current node: F\n3. Neighbors of F: E, C. Update tentative distances: C=6\n4. Mark F as visited.\n5. Smallest unvisited node: C. Set C as the current node.\n\n1. Tentative distances: A=0, B=5, C=6, D=3, E=2, F=4\n2. Current node: C\n4. Mark C as visited.\n5. All nodes have been visited.\n\nThe shortest distance between node A and node C is 6."
