    "message_2": "To find the expected number of accidents in a day, we can multiply the probability of an accident occurring by the number of cars passing through the intersection.\n\nExpected number of accidents = Probability of an accident * Number of cars\nExpected number of accidents = 0.32 * 5000\nExpected number of accidents = 1600\n\nSo, the expected number of accidents that will occur in a day at this intersection is 1600."
