    "message_1": "Suppose a company has two production plants, A and B, which can produce a maximum of 100 and 150 units respectively. The production cost per unit is $5 at plant A and $6 at plant B. The company has a total budget of $800 for production. How many units of each product should the company produce at each plant to minimize the production cost while staying within the budget?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units produced at plant A and y be the number of units produced at plant B. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x ≤ 100 (maximum production capacity of plant A)\n2. y ≤ 150 (maximum production capacity of plant B)\n3. 5x + 6y ≤ 800 (total budget constraint)\n\nThe objective is to minimize the production cost, which is given by the equation:\n\nCost = 5x + 6y\n\nWe will now solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x ≤ 100\n2. y ≤ 150\n3. 5x + 6y ≤ 800\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (100, 0), (0, 150), and (100, 116.67), where the last point is the intersection of the lines x = 100 and 5x + 6y = 800.\n\nNow we'll evaluate the cost function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. Cost at (0, 0) = 5(0) + 6(0) = $0\n2. Cost at (100, 0) = 5(100) + 6(0) = $500\n3. Cost at (0, 150) = 5(0) + 6(150) = $900\n4. Cost at (100, 116.67) = 5(100) + 6(116.67) ≈ $1200\n\nThe minimum cost is $0 at point (0, 0), but this means that the company is not producing any units. The next minimum cost is $500 at point (100, 0), which means the company should produce 100 units at plant A and 0 units at plant B to minimize the production cost while staying within the budget."
