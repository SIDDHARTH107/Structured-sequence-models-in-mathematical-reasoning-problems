    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between node 1 and node 6, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance of the starting node (node 1) to 0 and the distances of all other nodes to infinity.\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (node 1) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors. In this case, the neighbors are node 2 and node 3. The distance to node 2 is updated to 7, and the distance to node 3 is updated to 9.\n\n3. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 2) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (node 3 and node 4). The distance to node 3 is updated to 7 + 10 = 17, but since it's greater than the current distance (9), we don't update it. The distance to node 4 is updated to 7 + 15 = 22.\n\n4. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 3) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (node 4 and node 6). The distance to node 4 is updated to 9 + 11 = 20, which is smaller than the current distance (22), so we update it. The distance to node 6 is updated to 9 + 14 = 23.\n\n5. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 4) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (node 5 and node 6). The distance to node 5 is updated to 20 + 2 = 22. The distance to node 6 is updated to 20 + 9 = 29, but since it's greater than the current distance (23), we don't update it.\n\n6. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 5) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (node 6). The distance to node 6 is updated to 22 + 1 = 23, which is equal to the current distance, so we don't update it.\n\n7. Finally, select the last unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 6) and mark it as visited. Since this is the destination node, we can stop the algorithm.\n\nThe shortest path between node 1 and node 6 is 1 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6, with a total distance of 23."
