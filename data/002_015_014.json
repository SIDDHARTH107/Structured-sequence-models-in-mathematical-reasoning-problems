    "message_1": "A circular garden has a diameter of 28 meters. Find the perimeter of the garden, to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nC = πd\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter.\n\nIn this case, the diameter (d) is 28 meters. So, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π(28)\nC ≈ 3.14159(28)\nC ≈ 88.0\n\nSo, the perimeter of the garden is approximately 88 meters."
