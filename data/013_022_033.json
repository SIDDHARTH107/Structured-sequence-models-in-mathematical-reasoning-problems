    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to Game Theory and Dictator Game:\n\nIn a Dictator Game, Player A is given 10 coins and must decide how to split them with Player B. If Player A chooses to keep 8 coins for themselves and give 2 coins to Player B, what is the resulting payoff for each player according to Game Theory?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, the payoff for each player is simply the number of coins they end up with after Player A makes their decision. In this case, Player A chooses to keep 8 coins for themselves and give 2 coins to Player B. Therefore, the resulting payoff for Player A is 8 coins, and the resulting payoff for Player B is 2 coins."
