    "message_2": "In Pascal's Triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The 7th row of Pascal's Triangle starts with the numbers 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, and 1. To find the value of the 6th term in the 7th row, we can use the combination formula:\n\nnCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the row number (starting from 0), r is the term position (starting from 0), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 - 1 = 6 (since the row number starts from 0) and r = 6 - 1 = 5 (since the term position starts from 0).\n\n6C5 = 6! / (5!(6-5)!)\n\n6C5 = (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((5*4*3*2*1)*(1))\n\n6C5 = 720 / (120*1)\n\n6C5 = 720 / 120\n\n6C5 = 6\n\nSo, the value of the 6th term in the 7th row of Pascal's Triangle is 6."
