    "message_2": "Let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.\n\nThe total number of students registered for math or science is the sum of the number of students registered for each subject minus the number of students registered for both subjects.\n\nTotal students = students registered for math + students registered for science - students registered for both\n\nTotal students = 12 (math) + 10 (science) - 2 (both)\n\nTotal students = 20\n\nNow, we know that there are 20 students in the class, and we have found that 20 students are registered for either math or science. Therefore, there are 0 students registered for neither math nor science."
