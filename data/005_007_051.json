    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r) between mathematical aptitude and final exam scores, we need to have the standard deviations of both x (aptitude) and y (exam scores) as well as the slope of the regression line (b). Unfortunately, we cannot calculate the correlation coefficient with only the regression equation provided (y = 15x + 90).\n\nIf you can provide the standard deviations for x and y, we can calculate the correlation coefficient using the formula:\n\nr = b * (SD_x / SD_y)\n\nwhere SD_x is the standard deviation of x (aptitude) and SD_y is the standard deviation of y (exam scores)."
