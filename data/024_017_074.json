    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve C, we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve C. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the curve with respect to the parameter t:\n\nT(t) = (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt) = (2, 2t, 3).\n\nNow, we need to find the values of t corresponding to the points (2, 4, 6) and (4, 16, 12). From the curve equations, we have:\n\nFor (2, 4, 6): 2t = 2, t^2 = 4, and 3t = 6. Solving these equations, we get t = 1.\n\nFor (4, 16, 12): 2t = 4, t^2 = 16, and 3t = 12. Solving these equations, we get t = 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of the vector v from t = 1 to t = 2. To do this, we need to ensure that the vector v remains parallel to the tangent vector T(t) at each point along the curve. This means that the derivative of v with respect to t should be proportional to the tangent vector T(t).\n\nLet v(t) = (v1(t), v2(t), v3(t)). Then, the condition for parallel transport is:\n\ndv/dt = k * T(t), where k is a scalar function of t.\n\nThis gives us the following system of differential equations:\n\ndv1/dt = 2k,\ndv2/dt = 2tk,\ndv3/dt = 3k.\n\nNow, we need to solve this system of differential equations with the initial condition v(1) = (1, 2, 4). Integrating each equation, we get:\n\nv1(t) = 2kt + c1,\nv2(t) = kt^2 + c2,\nv3(t) = 3kt + c3.\n\nApplying the initial condition v(1) = (1, 2, 4), we get:\n\n1 = 2k + c1,\n2 = k + c2,\n4 = 3k + c3.\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of v at t = 2. Plugging t = 2 into the equations for v1(t), v2(t), and v3(t), we get:\n\nv1(2) = 4k + c1,\nv2(2) = 4k + c2,\nv3(2) = 6k + c3.\n\nSince the vector v remains parallel to the tangent vector T(t) at each point along the curve, we can find the proportionality constant k by taking the dot product of v(t) and T(t):\n\nv(t) · T(t) = (v1(t), v2(t), v3(t)) · (2, 2t, 3) = 2v1(t) + 2tv2(t) + 3v3(t).\n\nPlugging in the values of v1(2), v2(2), and v3(2), we get:\n\n2(4k + c1) + 4(4k + c2) + 3(6k + c3) = 2(1) + 4(2) + 3(4).\n\nSolving this equation, we get k = 0. Therefore, the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve C from the point (2, 4, 6) to the point (4, 16, 12) is:\n\nv(2) = (c1, c2, c3) = (1, 2, 4)."
