    "message_2": "To solve the given stochastic differential equation (SDE) using the Itô integral method, we first rewrite the SDE in the following form:\n\ndX(t) = X(t)(dt + 2 dW(t))\n\nNow, we apply the Itô formula to the function f(t, x) = ln(x), where x = X(t). The Itô formula states that for a twice continuously differentiable function f(t, x), we have:\n\ndf(t, X(t)) = (∂f/∂t) dt + (∂f/∂x) dX(t) + (1/2) (∂²f/∂x²) (dX(t))^2\n\nHere, ∂f/∂t = 0, ∂f/∂x = 1/x, and ∂²f/∂x² = -1/x^2. Substituting these values and the given SDE into the Itô formula, we get:\n\nd ln(X(t)) = (1/X(t)) dX(t) - (1/2) (1/X(t)^2) (dX(t))^2\n\nNow, we substitute the given SDE for dX(t):\n\nd ln(X(t)) = (1/X(t)) (X(t)(dt + 2 dW(t))) - (1/2) (1/X(t)^2) (X(t)(dt + 2 dW(t)))^2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nd ln(X(t)) = (dt + 2 dW(t)) - (1/2) (dt + 2 dW(t))^2\n\nNow, we can use the property (dW(t))^2 = dt to simplify further:\n\nd ln(X(t)) = (dt + 2 dW(t)) - (1/2) (dt^2 + 4 dt dW(t) + 4 (dW(t))^2)\nd ln(X(t)) = (dt + 2 dW(t)) - (1/2) (dt + 4 dt)\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to t from 0 to t:\n\n∫[0 to t] d ln(X(s)) = ∫[0 to t] (1/2 ds) + ∫[0 to t] 2 dW(s)\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\nln(X(t)) - ln(X(0)) = (1/2)t - 2 W(t)\n\nSince X(0) = 1, ln(X(0)) = 0. Therefore, we have:\n\nln(X(t)) = (1/2)t - 2 W(t)\n\nNow, we exponentiate both sides to get the solution X(t):\n\nX(t) = exp((1/2)t - 2 W(t))"
