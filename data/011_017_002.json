    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n × n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we have a 4x4 Latin square with numbers from 1 to 4.\n\nWe can solve this problem by counting the number of ways to fill the square row by row, taking into account the constraints of the Latin square.\n\n1. The first row can be filled in 4! (4 factorial) ways, which is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways.\n\n2. For the second row, there are 3 choices for the first cell, 2 choices for the second cell, and 1 choice for the third cell. The last cell is determined by the Latin square constraint. So, there are 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to fill the second row.\n\n3. For the third row, there are 2 choices for the first cell and 1 choice for the second cell. The last two cells are determined by the Latin square constraint. So, there are 2 × 1 = 2 ways to fill the third row.\n\n4. The fourth row is completely determined by the Latin square constraint, so there is only 1 way to fill it.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways to fill each row to get the total number of distinct 4x4 Latin squares:\n\n24 (first row) × 6 (second row) × 2 (third row) × 1 (fourth row) = 288\n\nSo, there are 288 distinct 4x4 Latin squares that can be created."
