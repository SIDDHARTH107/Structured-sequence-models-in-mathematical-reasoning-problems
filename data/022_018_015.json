    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) with the given initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\n$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) + 4X(x)Y(y) = 0$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} + 4 = 0$\n\nSince the left-hand side is a function of $x$ and $y$ independently, we can separate the variables by setting:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2$ and $\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = k^2 - 4$\n\nwhere $k$ is a separation constant. Now, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1. $X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0$\n2. $Y''(y) - (k^2 - 4)Y(y) = 0$\n\nSolving the first ODE, we get:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants. Using the initial condition $u(x, 0) = e^{-x^2}$, we have:\n\n$X(x)Y(0) = e^{-x^2}$\n\nSince $Y(0)$ cannot be zero, we have:\n\n$X(x) = e^{-x^2}$\n\nComparing this with the general solution of the first ODE, we can see that $A = 1$, $B = 0$, and $k = 0$. Thus, $X(x) = \\cos(0x) = 1$.\n\nNow, let's solve the second ODE:\n\n$Y''(y) - 4Y(y) = 0$\n\nThe general solution of this ODE is:\n\n$Y(y) = C\\cosh(2y) + D\\sinh(2y)$\n\nwhere $C$ and $D$ are constants. Using the initial condition $u_y(x, 0) = 0$, we have:\n\n$X(x)Y'(0) = 0$\n\nSince $X(x)$ is not zero, we must have $Y'(0) = 0$. Differentiating $Y(y)$ with respect to $y$, we get:\n\n$Y'(y) = 2C\\sinh(2y) + 2D\\cosh(2y)$\n\nSetting $y = 0$, we have:\n\n$Y'(0) = 2D\\cosh(0) = 2D = 0$\n\nThus, $D = 0$ and $Y(y) = C\\cosh(2y)$. The solution of the PDE is then:\n\n$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y) = \\cosh(2y)$\n\nFinally, we can find the value of $u(1, 1)$:\n\n$u(1, 1) = \\cosh(2(1)) = \\cosh(2) \\approx 3.7622$\n\nSo, the value of $u(1, 1)$ is approximately $3.7622$."
