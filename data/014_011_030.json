In this case, the key is 5, which means we will write the message in a grid with 5 columns and then read the message by columns.\n\nHere's the message \"HELLO WORLD\" written in a grid with 5 columns:\n\nH E L L O\nW O R L D\n\nNow, we read the message by columns:\n\nColumn 1: HW\nColumn 2: EO\nColumn 3: LR\nColumn 4: LL\nColumn 5: OD\n\nThe encoded message is \"HW EOLR LLOD\"."
