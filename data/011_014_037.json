    "message_2": "In a simple graph, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it. In this case, each of the 7 vertices has a degree of 4, meaning each vertex is connected to 4 other vertices by an edge.\n\nTo find the total number of edges in the graph, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In other words:\n\nÎ£(degrees of vertices) = 2 * number of edges\n\nSince there are 7 vertices, each with a degree of 4:\n\n7 * 4 = 2 * number of edges\n\n28 = 2 * number of edges\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nnumber of edges = 14\n\nSo, there are 14 edges in the graph."
