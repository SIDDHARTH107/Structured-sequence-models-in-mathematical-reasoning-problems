    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2, we first need to find its partial derivatives with respect to x and y.\n\nfx(x,y) = ∂f/∂x = 2x\nfy(x,y) = ∂f/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we need to find the points where both partial derivatives are equal to zero.\n\n2x = 0 => x = 0\n2y = 0 => y = 0\n\nThe only critical point is (0,0).\n\nNow, we need to classify this critical point as a minimum, maximum, or saddle point. To do this, we can use the second partial derivative test. We need to find the second partial derivatives of f:\n\nfxx(x,y) = ∂²f/∂x² = 2\nfyy(x,y) = ∂²f/∂y² = 2\nfxy(x,y) = ∂²f/∂x∂y = 0\nfyx(x,y) = ∂²f/∂y∂x = 0\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix:\n\nD(x,y) = fxx(x,y) * fyy(x,y) - fxy(x,y) * fyx(x,y)\nD(0,0) = 2 * 2 - 0 * 0 = 4\n\nSince D(0,0) > 0 and fxx(0,0) > 0, the critical point (0,0) is a local minimum."
