    "message_2": "It is not possible to draw this graph G with the given degree sequence. The reason is the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph must be even, as each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices.\n\nIn the given degree sequence 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, the sum of the degrees is:\n\n3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16\n\nSince 16 is an even number, the Handshaking Lemma does not immediately disprove the possibility of the graph. However, we can still show that it is not possible to draw this graph.\n\nLet's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, with degrees 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, and 1, respectively.\n\nVertices A, B, and C must have a degree of 3, meaning they must be connected to three other vertices. Since there are only three vertices with a degree of 1 (F, G, and H), A, B, and C must be connected to these vertices. However, this creates a problem: vertices D and E have a degree of 2, but there are no remaining vertices for them to connect to.\n\nIn other words, we cannot satisfy the degree requirements for all vertices simultaneously. Therefore, it is not possible to draw the graph G with the given degree sequence."
