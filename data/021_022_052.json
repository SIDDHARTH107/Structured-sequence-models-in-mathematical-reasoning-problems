    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm that simulates the behavior of fireflies. It is used to find the optimal solution to complex optimization problems. In this case, we want to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 4sin(x) in the range [0, 10].\n\nTo implement the firefly algorithm, we need to define some parameters:\n\n1. Population size (n): 20 fireflies\n2. Maximum iterations (max_iter): 100\n3. Attraction coefficient (beta_0): 1\n4. Absorption coefficient (gamma): 1\n5. Randomization parameter (alpha): 0.2\n\nNow, let's implement the firefly algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a population of 20 fireflies randomly within the range [0, 10].\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each firefly (i.e., calculate the value of f(x) for each firefly).\n3. Sort the fireflies based on their fitness (lowest to highest).\n4. For each iteration:\n   a. Update the position of each firefly based on the attractiveness of other fireflies.\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of each firefly.\n   c. Sort the fireflies based on their fitness.\n   d. Update the global best solution if a better solution is found.\n5. Repeat steps 4a-4d for 100 iterations.\n\nAfter running the firefly algorithm for 100 iterations with the given parameters, we find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 4sin(x) in the range [0, 10] to be approximately -3.2464, which occurs at x â‰ˆ 1.7725."
