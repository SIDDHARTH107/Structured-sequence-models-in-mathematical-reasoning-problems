    "message_2": "The Feigenbaum constant, denoted by Î´, is a universal constant that is independent of the bifurcation parameter r. It is approximately equal to 4.6692016091 and is used to describe the rate at which bifurcations occur in chaotic systems. The value of the Feigenbaum constant does not change based on the value of r, so even when r is equal to 3.2, the Feigenbaum constant remains approximately 4.6692016091."
