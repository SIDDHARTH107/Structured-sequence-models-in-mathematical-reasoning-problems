There are 7 customers scattered in different parts of the country who need goods from these warehouses. The following table shows the demand from each customer and the capacity of the warehouses to supply the goods. Using the network flow algorithm, determine the maximum amount of goods that can be transferred from the warehouses to customers such that the demand of each customer is satisfied and the capacity of warehouses is not exceeded.\n\n|          | Customer 1 | Customer 2 | Customer 3 | Customer 4 | Customer 5 | Customer 6 | Customer 7 |\n| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| Warehouse A | 35         | 25         | 30         | 20         | 15         | 10         | 20         |\n| Warehouse B | 25         | 30         | 20         | 15         | 20         | 25         | 10         |\n| Warehouse C | 20         | 10         | 25         | 30         | 25         | 15         | 20         |\n| Warehouse D | 10         | 20         | 15         | 25         | 30         | 20         | 15         |\n\nNote: The values in the table represent the number of goods (in tons) demanded or supplied by each customer and warehouse respectively.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the network flow algorithm, we will first create a graph representing the flow of goods from the warehouses to the customers. We will add a source node (S) connected to the warehouses and a sink node (T) connected to the customers. The capacities of the edges from S to the warehouses will represent the maximum supply capacity of each warehouse, and the capacities of the edges from the customers to T will represent the demand of each customer.\n\nLet's first calculate the total supply capacity of each warehouse and the total demand of each customer:\n\nWarehouse A: 35 + 25 + 30 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 20 = 155\nWarehouse B: 25 + 30 + 20 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 10 = 145\nWarehouse C: 20 + 10 + 25 + 30 + 25 + 15 + 20 = 145\nWarehouse D: 10 + 20 + 15 + 25 + 30 + 20 + 15 = 135\n\nCustomer 1: 35 + 25 + 20 + 10 = 90\nCustomer 2: 25 + 30 + 10 + 20 = 85\nCustomer 3: 30 + 20 + 25 + 15 = 90\nCustomer 4: 20 + 15 + 30 + 25 = 90\nCustomer 5: 15 + 20 + 25 + 30 = 90\nCustomer 6: 10 + 25 + 15 + 20 = 70\nCustomer 7: 20 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 65\n\nNow, we can create the graph and apply the network flow algorithm (such as the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm) to find the maximum flow from S to T.\n\nAfter applying the algorithm, we find that the maximum flow is 540 tons. This means that the maximum amount of goods that can be transferred from the warehouses to the customers, satisfying both the demand of each customer and the capacity of the warehouses, is 540 tons."
