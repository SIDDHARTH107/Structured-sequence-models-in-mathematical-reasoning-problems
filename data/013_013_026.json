    "message_1": "Suppose there are four bidders in an auction for a painting. Each bidder values the painting differently as follows: Bidder A values the painting at $500, Bidder B values it at $650, Bidder C values it at $800, and Bidder D values it at $950. Assuming the auction is second-price sealed-bid, if each bidder submits their bid in a sealed envelope and the envelopes are opened simultaneously, what is the winning bid and how much will the winning bidder pay?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid price. In this case, the bids are as follows:\n\nBidder A: $500\nBidder B: $650\nBidder C: $800\nBidder D: $950\n\nBidder D has the highest bid at $950, so they win the auction. However, they will pay the second-highest bid, which is $800 from Bidder C. Therefore, the winning bid is $950, and the winning bidder (Bidder D) will pay $800."
