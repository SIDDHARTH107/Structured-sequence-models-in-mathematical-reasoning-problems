    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic equation log2(x+1) - log2(x-1) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the quotient rule, which states that logb(a) - logb(c) = logb(a/c). Applying this rule to our equation, we get:\n\nlog2((x+1)/(x-1)) = 2\n\nNow, to remove the logarithm, we can use the property that if logb(a) = c, then a = b^c. In our case, this means:\n\n(x+1)/(x-1) = 2^2\n(x+1)/(x-1) = 4\n\nNow we can solve for x by cross-multiplying:\n\nx + 1 = 4(x - 1)\nx + 1 = 4x - 4\n\nNow, we can isolate x by subtracting x from both sides and adding 4 to both sides:\n\n1 + 4 = 4x - x\n5 = 3x\n\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 3 to find the value of x:\n\nx = 5/3\n\nSo, the value of x that satisfies the logarithmic equation is x = 5/3."
