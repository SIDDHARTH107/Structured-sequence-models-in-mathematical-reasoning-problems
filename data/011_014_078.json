    "message_1": "A group of 5 friends went to a restaurant and each of them ordered different items from the menu. They decided to pay separately and each one of them paid a different amount. How many different ways are there for them to pay if the total bill was $50? (Assume that there are no taxes or tips included)",
    "message_2": "Let's use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. We have 5 friends and 4 dividers to separate the amounts paid by each friend. Since each friend paid a different amount, we can represent the problem as distributing 50 dollars among 5 friends with the constraint that no two friends pay the same amount.\n\nFirst, let's assign each friend a minimum payment of $1 to ensure that they all pay different amounts. This leaves us with $45 to distribute among the 5 friends.\n\nNow, we have 45 dollars (stars) and 4 dividers (bars). We need to find the number of ways to arrange these stars and bars. The total number of objects to arrange is 45 + 4 = 49.\n\nWe can choose any 4 positions for the dividers out of the 49 positions, and the remaining positions will be filled with stars. So, the number of ways to arrange the stars and bars is the number of combinations of choosing 4 positions out of 49, which is:\n\nC(49, 4) = 49! / (4! * (49 - 4)!) = 49! / (4! * 45!) = 211876\n\nSo, there are 211,876 different ways for the 5 friends to pay separately with different amounts, given that the total bill is $50."
