    "message_2": "First, we note that the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2). According to the Sylow theorems, there must exist a subgroup of G of order 3, say H. Since the index of H in G is 3, which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G, H must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/H. Since the order of G is 9 and the order of H is 3, the order of G/H is 9/3 = 3. Since 3 is a prime number, G/H must be a cyclic group of order 3, say G/H = <xH>.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\nIn this case, G must be a direct product of its subgroups H and <x>. Since H is of order 3 and <x> is of order 3, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C9.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian.\nIn this case, we can find an element y in G such that y is not in H and y does not commute with some element in H. Let's consider the subgroup K generated by y and H, i.e., K = <y, H>. Since H is normal in G, K is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since y is not in H and y does not commute with some element in H, K cannot be a direct product of H and <y>. Thus, K must be a non-abelian group.\n\nNow, let's consider the order of K. Since H has order 3 and <y> has order 3, the order of K must be a multiple of 3. Moreover, since K is a subgroup of G, the order of K must divide the order of G, which is 9. Thus, the order of K must be either 3 or 9. However, we know that K is a non-abelian group, so the order of K cannot be 3 (as all groups of prime order are cyclic and hence abelian). Therefore, the order of K must be 9.\n\nSince K is a non-abelian group of order 9 and K is a subgroup of G, we conclude that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that if G is a group of order 9, then either G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9 (if G is abelian) or G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 9 (if G is non-abelian)."
