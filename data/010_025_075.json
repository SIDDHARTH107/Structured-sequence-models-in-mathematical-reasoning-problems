    "message_2": "The quaternion group, Q, is given by the following presentation:\n\nQ = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} with relations i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1.\n\nThe order of Q is 8, and the orders of its elements are:\n\n- |1| = 1\n- |-1| = 2\n- |i| = |j| = |k| = 4\n- |-i| = |-j| = |-k| = 4\n\nNow, let's consider the fact that X has the homotopy type of the 2-sphere, S^2. The fundamental group of S^2 is trivial, i.e., it has only one element, the identity element. However, we are given that the fundamental group of X is the quaternion group, Q, which is non-trivial. This is a contradiction, and therefore, the problem statement is incorrect.\n\nIn general, for the quaternion group Q, the exponent is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e for every element g in Q. Since the maximum order of any element in Q is 4 (for elements ±i, ±j, and ±k), the exponent of Q is 4."
