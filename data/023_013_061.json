    "message_1": "A metal plate of length 0.5 meters and width 0.4 meters has a temperature distribution given by T(x,y) = 100 cos(6πx)sin(4πy) at time t=0. Find the Fourier transform of the temperature distribution and then solve for the temperature distribution at time t=5 seconds if the plate is insulated at all boundaries and the thermal diffusivity is 0.1 m^2/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables and Fourier series. The temperature distribution T(x, y, t) can be represented as a product of three functions, X(x), Y(y), and T(t):\n\nT(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nThe heat equation for this problem is:\n\n∂T(x, y, t) / ∂t = α (∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂x² + ∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂y²)\n\nwhere α is the thermal diffusivity (0.1 m²/s).\n\nSubstituting the separated form of T(x, y, t) into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)dT(t)/dt = α (X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t))\n\nDividing both sides by αXYT, we get:\n\n(1/αT) dT(t)/dt = (1/X) X''(x) + (1/Y) Y''(y)\n\nSince the left side is a function of time only and the right side is a function of space only, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\n(1/αT) dT(t)/dt = -λ\n\n(1/X) X''(x) + (1/Y) Y''(y) = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λX(x) = 0\n\nY''(y) + λY(y) = 0\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n\nX(0) = X(0.5) = 0\n\nY(0) = Y(0.4) = 0\n\nThe solutions to these ODEs are:\n\nX(x) = C1 sin(√λ x)\n\nY(y) = C2 sin(√λ y)\n\nThe boundary conditions imply that:\n\n√λ = 2nπ for X(x) and √λ = 2mπ for Y(y)\n\nwhere n and m are integers.\n\nNow we can write the general solution for T(x, y, t) as a double Fourier series:\n\nT(x, y, t) = ∑∑ A_nm sin(2nπx) sin(2mπy) e^(-λt)\n\nwhere A_nm are the coefficients to be determined from the initial condition:\n\nT(x, y, 0) = 100 cos(6πx) sin(4πy)\n\nComparing the initial condition with the general solution, we can see that only the term with n=3 and m=2 will be nonzero:\n\nA_32 sin(6πx) sin(8πy) = 100 cos(6πx) sin(4πy)\n\nThus, A_32 = 100.\n\nNow we can write the temperature distribution at time t=5 seconds:\n\nT(x, y, 5) = 100 sin(6πx) sin(8πy) e^(-λ(5))\n\nwhere λ = (2nπ)² + (2mπ)² = (6π)² + (8π)² = 100π².\n\nSo, the temperature distribution at time t=5 seconds is:\n\nT(x, y, 5) = 100 sin(6πx) sin(8πy) e^(-100π²(5)(0.1))"
