    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we need to compute the first, second, and third derivatives of the given vector function r(t) with respect to t.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, r'(t):\nr'(t) = d(2t)i/dt + d(3sin(t))j/dt + d(3cos(t))k/dt\nr'(t) = 2i + 3cos(t)j - 3sin(t)k\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, r''(t):\nr''(t) = d(2)i/dt + d(3cos(t))j/dt + d(-3sin(t))k/dt\nr''(t) = -3sin(t)j - 3cos(t)k\n\nNext, let's find the third derivative, r'''(t):\nr'''(t) = d(-3sin(t))j/dt + d(-3cos(t))k/dt\nr'''(t) = -3cos(t)j + 3sin(t)k\n\nNow, we can find the curvature, κ(t), using the formula:\nκ(t) = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nFirst, let's compute the cross product r'(t) x r''(t):\nr'(t) x r''(t) = i(3cos^2(t) + 3sin^2(t)) - j(-6sin(t)cos(t)) + k(-6t)\n\nNow, let's compute the magnitude of r'(t) x r''(t):\n||r'(t) x r''(t)|| = √((3cos^2(t) + 3sin^2(t))^2 + (-6sin(t)cos(t))^2 + (-6t)^2)\n\nNext, let's compute the magnitude of r'(t):\n||r'(t)|| = √(2^2 + (3cos(t))^2 + (-3sin(t))^2)\n\nFinally, let's compute the curvature κ(t) at t = π/2:\nκ(π/2) = ||r'(π/2) x r''(π/2)|| / ||r'(π/2)||^3\nκ(π/2) = ||(3, 0, -3π)|| / ||(2, 0, -3)||^3\nκ(π/2) = √(9 + 9π^2) / (2^2 + 3^2)^3/2\nκ(π/2) = √(9 + 9π^2) / 13^3/2\n\nNow, let's find the torsion, τ(t), using the formula:\nτ(t) = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nFirst, let's compute the dot product (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t):\n(r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) = (3cos^2(t) + 3sin^2(t))(-3cos(t)) + (-6sin(t)cos(t))(-3sin(t)) + (-6t)(3sin(t))\n\nNow, let's compute the magnitude squared of r'(t) x r''(t):\n||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2 = (3cos^2(t) + 3sin^2(t))^2 + (-6sin(t)cos(t))^2 + (-6t)^2\n\nFinally, let's compute the torsion τ(t) at t = π/2:\nτ(π/2) = (r'(π/2) x r''(π/2)) • r'''(π/2) / ||r'(π/2) x r''(π/2)||^2\nτ(π/2) = (3, 0, -3π) • (0, -3, 3) / (9 + 9π^2)\nτ(π/2) = 9π / (9 + 9π^2)\n\nSo, the curvature κ(t) at t = π/2 is:\nκ(π/2) = √(9 + 9π^2) / 13^3/2\n\nAnd the torsion τ(t) at t = π/2 is:\nτ(π/2) = 9π / (9 + 9π^2)"
