    "message_1": "If there are 100 households in a community and the probability that a household attends a community event is 0.6, what is the probability that at least 50 households will attend the event?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 50 households will attend the event, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (households attending the event) out of n trials (total households)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (household attending the event)\n- n is the total number of trials (households)\n- k is the number of successes (households attending the event)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 50 households attending the event, we need to find the sum of probabilities from k = 50 to k = 100.\n\nP(X >= 50) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 50 to 100\n\nLet's calculate this sum:\n\nP(X >= 50) = P(X = 50) + P(X = 51) + ... + P(X = 100)\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula for each term in the sum:\n\nP(X = k) = C(100, k) * 0.6^k * 0.4^(100-k)\n\nNow, we can either calculate this sum manually or use a calculator or software that can handle binomial probability calculations. Many scientific calculators and statistical software packages have built-in functions for calculating binomial probabilities.\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find that:\n\nP(X >= 50) ≈ 0.996\n\nSo, the probability that at least 50 households will attend the event is approximately 0.996 or 99.6%."
