    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation 2x^3 - 12x^2 + 16x = 0, we can first factor out the common factor of x:\n\nx(2x^2 - 12x + 16) = 0\n\nNow we have a quadratic equation inside the parentheses. We can try to factor it further:\n\n2x^2 - 12x + 16 = 2(x^2 - 6x + 8)\n\nNow, let's factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 8 = (x - 2)(x - 4)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial equation is:\n\nx(2(x - 2)(x - 4)) = 0\n\nNow, we can find the solutions by setting each factor equal to zero:\n\n1) x = 0\n2) x - 2 = 0 => x = 2\n3) x - 4 = 0 => x = 4\n\nThus, the solutions to the polynomial equation 2x^3 - 12x^2 + 16x = 0 are x = 0, x = 2, and x = 4."
