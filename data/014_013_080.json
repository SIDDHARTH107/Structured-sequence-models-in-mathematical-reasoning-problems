    "message_1": "Suppose you want to encrypt the message \"MATH\" using the Hill cipher with a 2x2 matrix key. The corresponding numerical values for the letters are A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, and the message is split into blocks of two letters. If the key matrix is [5 8; 7 9], what is the encrypted form of the message?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH\" using the Hill cipher with the given 2x2 matrix key, we first convert the letters to their corresponding numerical values using the given mapping (A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, ...). For \"MATH\", we have:\n\nM = 12\nA = 0\nT = 19\nH = 7\n\nNow, we split the message into blocks of two letters: (M, A) and (T, H). We represent these blocks as column vectors:\n\n[M] = [12]\n[A]   [ 0]\n\n[T] = [19]\n[H]   [ 7]\n\nNext, we multiply each of these column vectors by the given key matrix:\n\n[5 8] [12]   [5*12 + 8*0]   [60]\n[7 9] [ 0] = [7*12 + 9*0] = [84]\n\n[5 8] [19]   [5*19 + 8*7]   [171]\n[7 9] [ 7] = [7*19 + 9*7] = [190]\n\nNow, we need to take the results modulo 26 (since there are 26 letters in the alphabet):\n\n[60]   [ 8]\n[84] = [10] (mod 26)\n\n[171]   [17]\n[190] = [ 0] (mod 26)\n\nFinally, we convert these numerical values back to letters using the given mapping:\n\n8  = I\n10 = K\n17 = R\n0  = A\n\nSo, the encrypted form of the message \"MATH\" using the Hill cipher with the given key matrix is \"IKRA\"."
