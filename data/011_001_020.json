    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose 5 friends out of 10 to form a committee, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of friends (10) and k is the number of friends to be chosen (5).\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nThere are 252 different ways to choose 5 friends out of 10 to form a committee."
