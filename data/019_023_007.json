    "message_2": "The given sequence is 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. We can observe that each term is double the previous term. Let's write this observation mathematically:\n\nTerm 2 = 2 * Term 1\nTerm 3 = 2 * Term 2\nTerm 4 = 2 * Term 3\nTerm 5 = 2 * Term 4\n\nUsing this pattern, we can find the next term in the sequence:\n\nTerm 6 = 2 * Term 5\n\nSince Term 5 is 32, we can calculate Term 6 as:\n\nTerm 6 = 2 * 32 = 64\n\nSo, the next term in the sequence is 64. This inductive logic is based on the observation that each term is double the previous term, which is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2."
