    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the curves y=x and y=x^2 on the interval [0,1], we need to find the integral of the difference between the two functions on that interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the points of intersection between the two curves:\nx = x^2\nx^2 - x = 0\nx(x-1) = 0\nx = 0, x = 1\n\nNow, we will integrate the difference between the two functions on the interval [0,1]:\n\nArea = ∫(x - x^2)dx from 0 to 1\n\nTo solve the integral, we will find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n\n∫(x - x^2)dx = (1/2)x^2 - (1/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, we will evaluate the antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\n[(1/2)(1)^2 - (1/3)(1)^3] - [(1/2)(0)^2 - (1/3)(0)^3] = (1/2 - 1/3) = 1/6\n\nSo, the area enclosed between the curves y=x and y=x^2 on the interval [0,1] is 1/6 square units."
