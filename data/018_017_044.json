This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference (Δ) between (A x B) and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either (A x B) or B, but not in both.\n\n(A x B) Δ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)} Δ {2, 3}\n\nSince none of the elements in B are in (A x B), the symmetric difference is just the union of the two sets:\n\n(A x B) Δ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference between B and itself:\n\nB Δ B = {2, 3} Δ {2, 3}\n\nSince all elements in B are also in B, the symmetric difference is the empty set:\n\nB Δ B = {}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product A x (B Δ B):\n\nA x (B Δ B) = A x {} = {}\n\nSince the empty set has no elements, the Cartesian product with any set is also the empty set.\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets we found:\n\n(A x B) Δ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\nA x (B Δ B) = {}\n\nThese two sets are not equal, as (A x B) Δ B has four elements while A x (B Δ B) has no elements."
