    "message_1": "Consider a group of 6 people. Each person wears either a red or blue shirt. What is the minimum number of people wearing the same color shirt must be present in this group so that there are either 3 people all wearing the same color shirt or 3 people all wearing different color shirts?",
    "message_2": "Since there are only two colors of shirts (red and blue), we can use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are n pigeonholes (in this case, shirt colors) and m > n pigeons (in this case, people), then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.\n\nIn this case, we have 6 people (pigeons) and 2 shirt colors (pigeonholes). To guarantee that there are either 3 people all wearing the same color shirt or 3 people all wearing different color shirts, we can divide the people into two groups based on their shirt color.\n\nIf there are 3 or more people wearing red shirts, then we have at least 3 people all wearing the same color shirt (red). If there are 3 or more people wearing blue shirts, then we have at least 3 people all wearing the same color shirt (blue).\n\nIf there are less than 3 people wearing red shirts and less than 3 people wearing blue shirts, then there must be exactly 2 people wearing red shirts and 4 people wearing blue shirts (or vice versa). In this case, we can still find 3 people all wearing different color shirts by selecting 1 person wearing a red shirt and 2 people wearing blue shirts (or vice versa).\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of people wearing the same color shirt must be present in this group so that there are either 3 people all wearing the same color shirt or 3 people all wearing different color shirts is 3."
