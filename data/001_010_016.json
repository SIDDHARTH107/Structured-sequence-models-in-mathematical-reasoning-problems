    "message_2": "First, we need to substitute the given values of x and y into the equation:\n\n3x² - 2y + 5 = 3(4)² - 2(6) + 5\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation step by step:\n\n3(16) - 12 + 5 = 48 - 12 + 5\n\nNext, we perform the addition and subtraction:\n\n48 - 12 + 5 = 36 + 5 = 41\n\nSo, the value of 3x² - 2y + 5 when x = 4 and y = 6 is 41."
