    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of sets A and B, denoted as A x B. The Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of A x B with the set {1}:\n\n(A x B) ∪ {1} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} ∪ {1} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 1}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of sets B and A, denoted as B x A:\n\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of B x A with the set {1}:\n\n(B x A) ∪ {1} = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)} ∪ {1} = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), 1}\n\nNow, we can see that (A x B) ∪ {1} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 1} and (B x A) ∪ {1} = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), 1}. These two sets are not equal, which means the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to union."
