    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve: \n\nA dairy farm produces two types of milk: whole and skim. Both types of milk contain the same productive costs, but the farm can sell whole milk for $5 per gallon and skim milk for $4 per gallon. The farm has a limited amount of storage capacity for milk and can store up to 1000 gallons. The farm also has limited milking resources and can produce up to 400 gallons of milk per day. The farm wants to maximize their profit. \n\nHow many gallons of whole and skim milk should the farm produce and sell to maximize their profit using linear programming methods?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using linear programming, we need to define the variables, objective function, and constraints.\n\nLet x be the number of gallons of whole milk and y be the number of gallons of skim milk produced and sold by the farm.\n\nObjective function (profit to be maximized):\nP = 5x + 4y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Storage capacity: x + y ≤ 1000\n2. Milking resources: x + y ≤ 400\n3. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and identifying the vertices of the feasible region.\n\n1. x + y = 1000 (storage capacity line)\n2. x + y = 400 (milking resources line)\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at:\nA: (0, 0)\nB: (0, 400)\nC: (400, 0)\nD: (200, 200)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 5(0) + 4(0) = 0\nP(B) = 5(0) + 4(400) = 1600\nP(C) = 5(400) + 4(0) = 2000\nP(D) = 5(200) + 4(200) = 1800\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex C, where the farm produces 400 gallons of whole milk and 0 gallons of skim milk. Thus, the farm should produce and sell 400 gallons of whole milk to maximize their profit, which will be $2000."
