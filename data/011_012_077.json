    "message_1": "A university has 2000 enrolled students. Of these, 1500 are taking a mathematics course, 800 are taking a physics course, and 400 are taking both courses. How many students are not taking either mathematics or physics courses?",
    "message_2": "To find out how many students are not taking either mathematics or physics courses, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal number of students taking either mathematics or physics courses = (Number of students taking mathematics courses) + (Number of students taking physics courses) - (Number of students taking both courses)\n\nTotal number of students taking either mathematics or physics courses = 1500 + 800 - 400 = 1900\n\nNow, to find the number of students not taking either of these courses, subtract the number of students taking either mathematics or physics courses from the total number of enrolled students:\n\nNumber of students not taking either mathematics or physics courses = (Total number of enrolled students) - (Total number of students taking either mathematics or physics courses)\n\nNumber of students not taking either mathematics or physics courses = 2000 - 1900 = 100\n\nSo, there are 100 students who are not taking either mathematics or physics courses."
