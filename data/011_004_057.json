    "message_1": "In a class of 20 students, there are 5 freshmen, 7 sophomores, 6 juniors, and 2 seniors. If a committee of 4 students is to be formed to represent the class, how many ways can this committee be comprised of 2 sophomores, 1 junior, and 1 senior? Use multinomial coefficients to solve.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using multinomial coefficients, we can use the formula:\n\nC(n; k1, k2, ..., kr) = n! / (k1! * k2! * ... * kr!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and k1, k2, ..., kr are the numbers of each type of item.\n\nIn this case, we want to form a committee of 4 students with 2 sophomores, 1 junior, and 1 senior. So, we have:\n\nn = 4 (total number of students in the committee)\nk1 = 2 (number of sophomores)\nk2 = 1 (number of juniors)\nk3 = 1 (number of seniors)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose these students from the class. We can use the binomial coefficient formula for each group:\n\nC(7,2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!) = 21 (ways to choose 2 sophomores from 7)\nC(6,1) = 6! / (1! * (6-1)!) = 6 (ways to choose 1 junior from 6)\nC(2,1) = 2! / (1! * (2-1)!) = 2 (ways to choose 1 senior from 2)\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways to choose students from each group to get the total number of ways to form the committee:\n\nTotal ways = C(7,2) * C(6,1) * C(2,1) = 21 * 6 * 2 = 252\n\nSo, there are 252 ways to form a committee of 4 students with 2 sophomores, 1 junior, and 1 senior."
