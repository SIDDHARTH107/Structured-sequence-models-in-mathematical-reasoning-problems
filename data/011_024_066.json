The capacity of each road is given in terms of the maximum amount of goods that can be transported through it. The table below shows the maximum capacities of the roads:\n\n| Source | Store 1 | Store 2 | Store 3 | Store 4 | Store 5 |\n|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n|    W   |    12   |    6    |    0    |    2    |    0    |\n|   S1   |    0    |    3    |    9    |    0    |    0    |\n|   S2   |    0    |    0    |    3    |    1    |    0    |\n|   S3   |    0    |    0    |    0    |    4    |    1    |\n|   S4   |    0    |    0    |    0    |    0    |    7    |\n\nWhat is the maximum amount of goods that the company can transport from the warehouse to the stores using this network of roads?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from the warehouse to the stores, we need to find the maximum flow through the network. We can do this by analyzing the capacities of the roads and determining the best path for transporting goods.\n\n1. From the warehouse (W) to Store 1 (S1): 12 units can be transported.\n2. From Store 1 (S1) to Store 3 (S3): 9 units can be transported (out of the 12 units received from W).\n3. From Store 1 (S1) to Store 2 (S2): 3 units can be transported (out of the remaining 3 units from W).\n4. From the warehouse (W) to Store 2 (S2): 6 units can be transported.\n5. From Store 2 (S2) to Store 3 (S3): 3 units can be transported (out of the 9 units received from W and S1).\n6. From Store 2 (S2) to Store 4 (S4): 1 unit can be transported (out of the remaining 2 units from W).\n7. From the warehouse (W) to Store 4 (S4): 2 units can be transported.\n8. From Store 3 (S3) to Store 4 (S4): 4 units can be transported (out of the 12 units received from W and S1).\n9. From Store 3 (S3) to Store 5 (S5): 1 unit can be transported (out of the remaining 1 unit from S1).\n10. From Store 4 (S4) to Store 5 (S5): 7 units can be transported (out of the 7 units received from W, S2, and S3).\n\nNow, let's sum up the goods transported to each store:\n\n- Store 1: 12 units (directly from W)\n- Store 2: 3 units (from S1) + 6 units (from W) = 9 units\n- Store 3: 9 units (from S1) + 3 units (from S2) = 12 units\n- Store 4: 1 unit (from S2) + 2 units (from W) + 4 units (from S3) = 7 units\n- Store 5: 1 unit (from S3) + 7 units (from S4) = 8 units\n\nThe maximum amount of goods that can be transported from the warehouse to the stores using this network of roads is 12 + 9 + 12 + 7 + 8 = 48 units."
