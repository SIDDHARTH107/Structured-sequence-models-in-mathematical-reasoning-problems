    "message_1": "Consider a 2-dimensional surface S which is a manifold. Suppose S has genus 2, which means that S contains 2 \"holes.\" If we cut S along a simple closed curve, then how many connected components will the resulting surface have?",
    "message_2": "If we cut a 2-dimensional surface S with genus 2 along a simple closed curve, the resulting surface will have two possible outcomes depending on the curve's position:\n\n1. If the simple closed curve passes through both holes, then cutting along this curve will result in a single connected component. This is because the cut will not separate the surface into two disjoint parts.\n\n2. If the simple closed curve passes through only one hole or encircles one hole without passing through it, then cutting along this curve will result in two connected components. This is because the cut will separate the surface into two disjoint parts, one containing the encircled hole and the other containing the remaining hole.\n\nSo, depending on the position of the simple closed curve, the resulting surface can have either one or two connected components."
