    "message_1": "In a restaurant, a customer wants to order a pizza with three toppings. If the restaurant offers a choice of eight possible toppings, how many different pizza orders can the customer make?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of different pizza orders the customer can make, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of toppings available (8 in this case), k is the number of toppings the customer wants to choose (3 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!5!)\n\nC(8, 3) = (8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(5*4*3*2*1))\n\nC(8, 3) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1)\n\nC(8, 3) = 336 / 6\n\nC(8, 3) = 56\n\nSo, the customer can make 56 different pizza orders with three toppings."
