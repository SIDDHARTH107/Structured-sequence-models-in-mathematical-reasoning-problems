    "message_2": "1. A × B and its complement\nA × B is the Cartesian product of sets A and B, which consists of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. So, A × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\nTo find the complement of A × B, we need to know the universal set U. Let's assume the universal set U is the Cartesian product of the sets {1, 2, 3, 4} × {1, 2, 3, 4}. Then, (A × B)' (the complement of A × B) consists of all elements in U that are not in A × B:\n\n(A × B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\n2. A' × B' and its complement\nA' is the complement of A in the universal set {1, 2, 3, 4}, so A' = {3, 4}.\nB' is the complement of B in the universal set {1, 2, 3, 4}, so B' = {1, 2}.\n\nNow, we find the Cartesian product of A' and B': A' × B' = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}.\n\nThe complement of A' × B' in the universal set U is:\n\n(A' × B')' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\n3. Show that (A × B)' is not equal to A' × B' by finding at least one element that is in one set but not in the other.\nComparing the two sets (A × B)' and (A' × B'), we can see that there are elements in one set that are not in the other. For example, the element (1, 1) is in (A × B)' but not in (A' × B'). Similarly, the element (3, 1) is in A' × B' but not in (A × B)'. Since there are elements that are not in both sets, we can conclude that (A × B)' is not equal to A' × B'."
