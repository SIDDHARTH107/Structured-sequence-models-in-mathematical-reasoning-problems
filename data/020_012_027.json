    "message_1": "A cable company is planning an optimal cable route to connect four cities. The distance between City A and City B is 10 miles, between City A and City C is 8 miles, between City A and City D is 12 miles, between City B and City C is 4 miles, between City B and City D is 6 miles, and between City C and City D is 10 miles. The cost of laying cable is $500 per mile. What is the minimum cost for connecting all four cities?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost for connecting all four cities, we can use Kruskal's algorithm, which is a minimum spanning tree algorithm. The algorithm works by sorting all the edges (distances between cities) in non-decreasing order of their weight (cost), and then adding the edges one by one to the spanning tree, making sure that adding the edge doesn't form a cycle.\n\n1. Sort the edges by their weight:\n   - City B to City C: 4 miles\n   - City B to City D: 6 miles\n   - City A to City C: 8 miles\n   - City A to City B: 10 miles\n   - City C to City D: 10 miles\n   - City A to City D: 12 miles\n\n2. Start adding edges to the minimum spanning tree:\n   - Add edge City B to City C (4 miles)\n   - Add edge City B to City D (6 miles)\n   - Add edge City A to City C (8 miles)\n\nNow, all four cities are connected, and adding any more edges would create a cycle. The total distance of the minimum spanning tree is 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 miles.\n\n3. Calculate the cost:\nThe cost of laying cable is $500 per mile, so the minimum cost for connecting all four cities is 18 miles * $500/mile = $9,000."
