    "message_2": "To compute the Fourier Transform of a 2D image with 512x512 pixels and pixel values ranging from 0 to 255, you would apply the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) formula to the image. The DFT is given by:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ[Σ[f(x, y) * e^(-j * 2 * π * (ux/M + vy/N))]], where the summations are from x=0 to M-1 and y=0 to N-1.\n\nIn this case, M = N = 512.\n\nHowever, without the actual pixel values of the image, it's impossible to provide a specific result for the Fourier Transform. The result would be a complex-valued matrix of the same size (512x512) representing the frequency components of the image.\n\nIn practice, you would use a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to compute the Fourier Transform more efficiently. Many programming languages and libraries, such as Python's NumPy or MATLAB, provide built-in functions to perform the FFT on a 2D image."
