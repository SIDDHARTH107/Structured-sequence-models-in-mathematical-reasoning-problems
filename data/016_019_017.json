(Note: Each iteration of the Koch island involves replacing each line segment with four segments of equal length, where the middle two segments form an equilateral triangle.)",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the Koch island after the 4th iteration, we first need to determine the length of each segment after each iteration and the number of segments.\n\n1. After the 1st iteration, each side of the original equilateral triangle is divided into 4 segments of equal length. So, the length of each segment is 1/3, and there are 3 sides * 4 segments = 12 segments in total.\n\n2. After the 2nd iteration, each of the 12 segments is divided into 4 segments of equal length. So, the length of each segment is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, and there are 12 sides * 4 segments = 48 segments in total.\n\n3. After the 3rd iteration, each of the 48 segments is divided into 4 segments of equal length. So, the length of each segment is (1/9) * (1/3) = 1/27, and there are 48 sides * 4 segments = 192 segments in total.\n\n4. After the 4th iteration, each of the 192 segments is divided into 4 segments of equal length. So, the length of each segment is (1/27) * (1/3) = 1/81, and there are 192 sides * 4 segments = 768 segments in total.\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the Koch island after the 4th iteration, we multiply the length of each segment (1/81) by the total number of segments (768):\n\nPerimeter = (1/81) * 768 = 768/81 = 8\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch island after the 4th iteration is 8 units."
