    "message_2": "To solve this semi-definite programming problem, we first need to analyze the semi-definite constraint:\n\n[x1  1.5\n 1.5 x2] ≥ 0\n\nFor a matrix to be positive semi-definite, all its eigenvalues must be non-negative. Let's find the eigenvalues of the matrix:\n\ndet(A - λI) = 0\n\n[(x1 - λ)  1.5\n  1.5  (x2 - λ)] = 0\n\n(x1 - λ)(x2 - λ) - (1.5)(1.5) = 0\nλ^2 - (x1 + x2)λ + (x1x2 - 2.25) = 0\n\nNow, we need to ensure that both eigenvalues are non-negative. We can use the quadratic formula to find the eigenvalues:\n\nλ = (x1 + x2 ± √((x1 + x2)^2 - 4(x1x2 - 2.25))) / 2\n\nSince we want the matrix to be positive semi-definite, both eigenvalues must be non-negative. This means that the discriminant (the value inside the square root) must be non-negative:\n\n(x1 + x2)^2 - 4(x1x2 - 2.25) ≥ 0\n\nNow, we have the following constraints:\n\n1. x1 + x2 ≤ 2\n2. x1 - x2 ≤ 1\n3. (x1 + x2)^2 - 4(x1x2 - 2.25) ≥ 0\n\nWe can solve this problem graphically by plotting the feasible region and finding the optimal solution. The feasible region is a triangle with vertices (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 0). The optimal solution occurs at the vertex (1, 1), which satisfies all the constraints.\n\nSo, the optimal values for x1 and x2 are:\n\nx1 = 1\nx2 = 1\n\nNow, we can find the optimal value of f(x):\n\nf(x) = 2x1 + 3x2 = 2(1) + 3(1) = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nThus, the optimal value of f(x) is 5, and the values of x1 and x2 that achieve it are both 1."
