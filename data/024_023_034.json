    "message_2": "To find the fixed points of the symmetry transformation T on the manifold M, we need to find the points (x, y, z) that satisfy both the equation of the manifold and the transformation equation. In other words, we need to find the points (x, y, z) such that:\n\n1. x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 (the equation of the manifold M)\n2. T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z) (the fixed points of the transformation)\n\nApplying the transformation T to (x, y, z), we get (-x, -y, z). So, we need to find the points (x, y, z) such that:\n\n(-x, -y, z) = (x, y, z)\n\nThis implies that:\n\n-x = x\n-y = y\nz = z\n\nThe first equation, -x = x, implies that x = 0. Similarly, the second equation, -y = y, implies that y = 0. The third equation, z = z, does not impose any constraint on z.\n\nNow, we need to check if the points (0, 0, z) satisfy the equation of the manifold M:\n\n(0)^2 + (0)^2 + z^2 = 1\nz^2 = 1\n\nThis equation has two solutions: z = 1 and z = -1.\n\nSo, there are two fixed points of the symmetry transformation T on the manifold M: (0, 0, 1) and (0, 0, -1)."
