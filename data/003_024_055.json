    "message_1": "A plane is flying towards the northeast direction with a velocity of 300 km/h. Another plane is flying towards the southeast direction with a velocity of 400 km/h. What is the component of the velocity of the first plane in the direction of the second plane, if the angle between their directions is 60 degrees? Round the answer to the nearest integer.",
    "message_2": "To find the component of the velocity of the first plane in the direction of the second plane, we can use the formula for the dot product of two vectors:\n\nA · B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere A and B are the magnitudes of the vectors (in this case, the velocities of the planes), and θ is the angle between them.\n\nIn this problem, |A| = 300 km/h, |B| = 400 km/h, and θ = 60 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 60 * (π / 180) = π / 3 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nA · B = 300 * 400 * cos(π / 3)\n\nA · B = 120000 * (1/2)\n\nA · B = 60000\n\nSo, the component of the velocity of the first plane in the direction of the second plane is 60,000 km/h. Since the problem asks for the answer to be rounded to the nearest integer, the final answer is 60,000 km/h."
