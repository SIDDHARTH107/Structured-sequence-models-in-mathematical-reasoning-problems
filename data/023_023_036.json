    "message_2": "To find the network's response to a sinusoidal input with frequency $f = 3 Hz$ and amplitude $A = 2V$, we first need to express the input signal in the Laplace domain. The input signal is given by $x(t) = 2\\sin(2\\pi(3)t)$. The Laplace transform of this signal is:\n\n$$X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{2\\sin(2\\pi(3)t)\\} = 2\\pi(3)\\frac{s}{s^2 + (2\\pi(3))^2}$$\n\nNow, we can find the output signal in the Laplace domain by multiplying the input signal by the impedance function:\n\n$$Y(s) = Z(s)X(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+1)(s+2)} \\cdot 2\\pi(3)\\frac{s}{s^2 + (2\\pi(3))^2}$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$Y(s) = \\frac{2\\pi(3)s}{(s+1)(s+2)(s^2 + (2\\pi(3))^2)}$$\n\nTo find the time-domain response, we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$. We can do this by performing partial fraction decomposition:\n\n$$Y(s) = \\frac{A}{s+1} + \\frac{B}{s+2} + \\frac{Cs + D}{s^2 + (2\\pi(3))^2}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator, we get:\n\n$$2\\pi(3)s = A(s+2)(s^2 + (2\\pi(3))^2) + B(s+1)(s^2 + (2\\pi(3))^2) + (Cs + D)(s+1)(s+2)$$\n\nNow, we can solve for the coefficients A, B, C, and D by equating the coefficients of the powers of s. After solving, we get:\n\n$$A = -\\frac{2\\pi(3)}{5}, \\quad B = \\frac{4\\pi(3)}{5}, \\quad C = 0, \\quad D = -\\frac{2\\pi(3)}{5}$$\n\nNow, we can write the inverse Laplace transform:\n\n$$y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Y(s)\\} = -\\frac{2\\pi(3)}{5}e^{-t} + \\frac{4\\pi(3)}{5}e^{-2t} - \\frac{2\\pi(3)}{5}\\sin(2\\pi(3)t)$$\n\nSo, the network's response to the sinusoidal input with frequency $f = 3 Hz$ and amplitude $A = 2V$ is:\n\n$$y(t) = -\\frac{2\\pi(3)}{5}e^{-t} + \\frac{4\\pi(3)}{5}e^{-2t} - \\frac{2\\pi(3)}{5}\\sin(2\\pi(3)t)$$"
