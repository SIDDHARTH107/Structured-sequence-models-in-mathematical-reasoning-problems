    "message_1": "A square and an equilateral triangle have the same perimeter. The perimeter of the square is 24 cm. What is the length of each side of the equilateral triangle?",
    "message_2": "If the perimeter of the square is 24 cm, then each side of the square is 24/4 = 6 cm.\n\nSince the square and the equilateral triangle have the same perimeter, the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is also 24 cm. An equilateral triangle has three equal sides, so to find the length of each side, we can divide the perimeter by 3.\n\nLength of each side of the equilateral triangle = 24/3 = 8 cm."
