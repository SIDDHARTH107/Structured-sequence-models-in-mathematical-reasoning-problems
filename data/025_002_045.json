    "message_2": "The intersection number of a line $\\ell$ and a non-singular curve $C$ of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ is equal to the degree of the curve, which is $d$. This is due to the fact that a curve of degree $d$ intersects a line in exactly $d$ points, counting multiplicities.\n\nIn this case, the line $\\ell$ intersects $C$ in $r$ distinct points, where $r < d$. However, we need to consider the intersection multiplicities to find the intersection number. Let $P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_r$ be the distinct points of intersection, and let $m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_r$ be their respective intersection multiplicities. Then, the intersection number is given by:\n\nIntersection number = $m_1 + m_2 + \\dots + m_r$\n\nSince the curve is non-singular, the intersection multiplicities at each point are at least 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n$r \\leq m_1 + m_2 + \\dots + m_r$\n\nSince the intersection number is equal to the degree of the curve, we have:\n\n$d = m_1 + m_2 + \\dots + m_r$\n\nThus, the intersection number of $\\ell$ and $C$ is $d$."
