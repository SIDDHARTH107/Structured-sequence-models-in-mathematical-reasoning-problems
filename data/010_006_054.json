    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X, Y)$, we first need to understand the topological spaces X and Y. \n\nX is the plane with the origin removed, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1. This is because we can contract the punctured plane to a circle by continuously shrinking the radial lines from the origin to the points in the plane. \n\nY is the unit circle centered at the origin, which is already a circle S^1.\n\nNow we want to compute the fundamental group of the pair (X, Y). Since X is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem to compute the fundamental group of X with respect to a basepoint on Y.\n\nLet's choose a basepoint y0 on Y. We can cover X with two open sets U and V such that U contains Y and V is an open set containing y0. Then, we have:\n\n$\\pi_1(X, y0) = \\pi_1(U, y0) *_{\\pi_1(U \\cap V, y0)} \\pi_1(V, y0)$\n\nSince U contains Y, which is a circle, the fundamental group of U is isomorphic to the fundamental group of a circle, which is the integers Z. The intersection U âˆ© V is homotopy equivalent to a circle with a point removed, so its fundamental group is also isomorphic to the integers Z. Finally, V is an open set containing y0, and its fundamental group is trivial.\n\nUsing the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, we get:\n\n$\\pi_1(X, y0) = \\mathbb{Z} *_{\\mathbb{Z}} 1$\n\nSince the amalgamated product of two groups with a common subgroup is isomorphic to the quotient of the direct product of the two groups by the normal subgroup generated by the common subgroup, we have:\n\n$\\pi_1(X, y0) = (\\mathbb{Z} \\times 1) / N(\\mathbb{Z})$\n\nThis is isomorphic to the integers Z, as the normal subgroup generated by the common subgroup is just the integers Z.\n\nThus, the fundamental group of the pair (X, Y) is isomorphic to the integers:\n\n$\\pi_1(X, Y) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$"
