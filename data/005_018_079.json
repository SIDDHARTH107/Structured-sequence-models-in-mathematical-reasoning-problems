    "message_1": "In a certain population, the survival times (in years) for a particular disease are found to be normally distributed with a mean of 8 years and a standard deviation of 2 years. \n\nWhat is the probability that a patient with this disease will survive:\n\na) Less than 5 years?\nb) Between 6 and 10 years?\nc) More than 12 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve these problems, we will use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table).\n\nThe z-score formula is: z = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\na) Less than 5 years:\n\nz = (5 - 8) / 2 = -3 / 2 = -1.5\n\nUsing the z-table, we find the probability for a z-score of -1.5 is 0.0668. So, the probability of a patient surviving less than 5 years is 6.68%.\n\nb) Between 6 and 10 years:\n\nFirst, we find the z-scores for 6 and 10 years:\n\nz1 = (6 - 8) / 2 = -2 / 2 = -1\nz2 = (10 - 8) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1\n\nUsing the z-table, we find the probabilities for z-scores of -1 and 1 are 0.1587 and 0.8413, respectively. To find the probability of a patient surviving between 6 and 10 years, we subtract the probability of z1 from the probability of z2:\n\nP(6 < X < 10) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826\n\nSo, the probability of a patient surviving between 6 and 10 years is 68.26%.\n\nc) More than 12 years:\n\nz = (12 - 8) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nUsing the z-table, we find the probability for a z-score of 2 is 0.9772. Since we want the probability of a patient surviving more than 12 years, we need to find the probability in the right tail of the distribution:\n\nP(X > 12) = 1 - P(z) = 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228\n\nSo, the probability of a patient surviving more than 12 years is 2.28%."
