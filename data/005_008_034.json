Use time series analysis to predict the number of customers expected to visit the store on the 8th day.",
    "message_2": "To predict the number of customers on the 8th day using time series analysis, we can use the simple moving average method. In this case, we will calculate the average number of customers for the past 7 days and use that as our prediction for the 8th day.\n\nHere's the data for the past 7 days: 25, 32, 28, 34, 37, 31, and 29.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the sum of the number of customers for the past 7 days.\nSum = 25 + 32 + 28 + 34 + 37 + 31 + 29 = 216\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average number of customers for the past 7 days.\nAverage = Sum / Number of days\nAverage = 216 / 7\nAverage â‰ˆ 30.86\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a customer, we can round the average to the nearest whole number.\n\nPrediction for the 8th day = 31 customers"
