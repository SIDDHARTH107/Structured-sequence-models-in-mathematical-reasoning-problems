We will start by finding the maximum possible value for x, which occurs when y = 1:\n\n2x + 3(1) = 35\n2x = 32\nx = 16\n\nSo, the maximum value for x is 16. Now, we will iterate through all possible values of x and find the corresponding values of y:\n\n1. x = 1:\n2(1) + 3y = 35\n3y = 33\ny = 11\n\n2. x = 2:\n2(2) + 3y = 35\n3y = 31 (No integer solution for y)\n\n3. x = 3:\n2(3) + 3y = 35\n3y = 29 (No integer solution for y)\n\n4. x = 4:\n2(4) + 3y = 35\n3y = 27\ny = 9\n\n5. x = 5:\n2(5) + 3y = 35\n3y = 25 (No integer solution for y)\n\n6. x = 6:\n2(6) + 3y = 35\n3y = 23 (No integer solution for y)\n\n7. x = 7:\n2(7) + 3y = 35\n3y = 21\ny = 7\n\n8. x = 8:\n2(8) + 3y = 35\n3y = 19 (No integer solution for y)\n\n9. x = 9:\n2(9) + 3y = 35\n3y = 17 (No integer solution for y)\n\n10. x = 10:\n2(10) + 3y = 35\n3y = 15\ny = 5\n\n11. x = 11:\n2(11) + 3y = 35\n3y = 13 (No integer solution for y)\n\n12. x = 12:\n2(12) + 3y = 35\n3y = 11 (No integer solution for y)\n\n13. x = 13:\n2(13) + 3y = 35\n3y = 9 (No integer solution for y)\n\n14. x = 14:\n2(14) + 3y = 35\n3y = 7 (No integer solution for y)\n\n15. x = 15:\n2(15) + 3y = 35\n3y = 5 (No integer solution for y)\n\n16. x = 16:\n2(16) + 3y = 35\n3y = 3\ny = 1\n\nSo, the positive integer solutions for the equation 6x + 9y = 105 are:\n\n(x, y) = (1, 11), (4, 9), (7, 7), (10, 5), and (16, 1)."
