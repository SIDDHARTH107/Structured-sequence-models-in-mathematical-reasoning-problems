    "message_2": "Yes, I can help. To find the average value of a function on a given interval, we use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = 3sin(2x), and the interval is [0, π]. So, a = 0 and b = π.\n\nAverage value = (1/(π-0)) * ∫[0, π] 3sin(2x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of 3sin(2x) with respect to x from 0 to π:\n\n∫ 3sin(2x) dx = (-3/2)cos(2x) + C\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral at the bounds of the interval:\n\n((-3/2)cos(2π) - (-3/2)cos(0))\n\n= (-3/2)(cos(2π) - cos(0))\n\n= (-3/2)(1 - 1) = 0\n\nNow, we'll plug this result back into the average value formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/π) * 0 = 0\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x) on the interval [0, π] is 0."
