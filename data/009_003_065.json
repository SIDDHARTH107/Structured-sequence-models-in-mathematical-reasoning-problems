    "message_1": "A one-dimensional rod with length 10 cm is initially at a temperature of 25°C. The left end of the rod is in thermal contact with an ice bath which is kept at 0°C while the right end of the rod is in contact with a heat source at 100°C. The rod has diffusivity 0.1 cm^2/s and is made of a material with specific heat 0.2 J/g°C and density 1 g/cm^3. Determine the temperature distribution in the rod after 10 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To determine the temperature distribution in the rod after 10 seconds, we can use the one-dimensional heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x, t) is the temperature at position x and time t, α is the thermal diffusivity, and ∂²u/∂x² is the second derivative of u with respect to x.\n\nWe are given the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0, t) = 0°C (left end in contact with ice bath)\nu(10, t) = 100°C (right end in contact with heat source)\n\nand the initial condition:\n\nu(x, 0) = 25°C (initial temperature of the rod)\n\nWe can solve this problem using the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = αX''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by αX(x)T(t):\n\nT'(t)/αT(t) = X''(x)/X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call -λ:\n\nT'(t)/αT(t) = X''(x)/X(x) = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λX(x) = 0\nT'(t) + αλT(t) = 0\n\nSolving the first equation for X(x), we get:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(√λx) + B*sin(√λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = 0 => A = 0\nX(10) = B*sin(√λ*10) = 100\n\nSince B ≠ 0, we have:\n\nsin(√λ*10) = 100/B\n\nNow, we need to find λ and B such that this equation is satisfied. This is an eigenvalue problem, and the solutions are given by:\n\nλ_n = (nπ/10)², n = 1, 2, 3, ...\nB_n = 100/sin(nπ)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for X(x) as a sum of these solutions:\n\nX(x) = Σ [B_n * sin(√λ_n * x)]\n\nSolving the second equation for T(t), we get:\n\nT(t) = C*exp(-αλ*t)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for T(t) as a sum of these solutions:\n\nT(t) = Σ [C_n * exp(-αλ_n*t)]\n\nThe final solution for u(x, t) is given by the product of X(x) and T(t):\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [B_n * sin(√λ_n * x) * C_n * exp(-αλ_n*t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients C_n, we need to apply the initial condition:\n\nu(x, 0) = 25 = Σ [B_n * sin(√λ_n * x) * C_n]\n\nSince the initial condition is independent of time, we can solve for C_n by using Fourier sine series:\n\nC_n = (2/L) * ∫[u(x, 0) * sin(nπx/L)] dx, from 0 to L (L = 10 cm)\n\nC_n = (1/5) * ∫[25 * sin(nπx/10)] dx, from 0 to 10\n\nC_n = (5/πn) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we can plug the C_n values back into the solution for u(x, t):\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [(5/πn) * (1 - (-1)^n) * sin(nπx/10) * exp(-(nπ/10)² * 0.1 * t)]\n\nThis is the temperature distribution in the rod after 10 seconds. Note that this is an infinite series, so to get an approximate solution, you can truncate the series after a certain number of terms. The more terms you include, the more accurate the solution will be."
