Let's denote the chromatic polynomial as P(G, k), where G is the graph and k is the number of colors.\n\n1. Choose an edge to apply the deletion-contraction algorithm. Let's choose the edge connecting vertices d and g.\n\n2. Delete the edge (d, g) from the graph and find the chromatic polynomial of the resulting graph, P(G - (d, g), k). The graph becomes:\n\n```\n   a---b\n  /|   |\\\n c d   e f\n    \\  |/\n     g-h\n```\n\n3.
