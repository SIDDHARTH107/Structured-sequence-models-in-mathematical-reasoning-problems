    "message_1": "There are 5 different types of candies in a jar, and you want to choose and eat 10 candies. How many different ways are there to choose the candies if you want to eat at least one candy of each type? (Hint: use multinomial coefficients)",
    "message_2": "Since you want to eat at least one candy of each type, let's first choose one candy of each type. Now, you have 5 candies chosen, and you need to choose 5 more candies from the 5 types.\n\nThis problem can be solved using the stars and bars method. Imagine you have 5 more candies to choose (5 stars) and you want to distribute them among the 5 types of candies (4 bars to separate the types).\n\nFor example, a possible distribution could look like this:\n\n**|*|***||\n\nThis means you chose 2 candies of the first type, 1 of the second type, 3 of the third type, and 1 each of the fourth and fifth types.\n\nSo, we have 5 stars and 4 bars, and we need to find the number of ways to arrange them. This is a combination problem, and the formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn our case, n = 5 stars + 4 bars = 9, and k = 4 bars. So, we have:\n\nC(9, 4) = 9! / (4!(9-4)!)\nC(9, 4) = 9! / (4!5!)\nC(9, 4) = 362880 / (24 * 120)\nC(9, 4) = 362880 / 2880\nC(9, 4) = 126\n\nSo, there are 126 different ways to choose the candies if you want to eat at least one candy of each type."
