    "message_2": "The overall probability that the stock price will either increase or decrease is the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring. In this case, the probability of the stock increasing by 2% is 0.4, and the probability of it decreasing by 3% is 0.6. \n\nTo find the overall probability, simply add the probabilities together:\n\n0.4 (probability of increasing) + 0.6 (probability of decreasing) = 1.0\n\nThe overall probability that the stock price will either increase or decrease is 1.0, or 100%."
