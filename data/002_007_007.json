    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 10 cm and bases of 8 cm and 12 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (sum of the bases) × height\n\nIn this case, the height is 10 cm, and the bases are 8 cm and 12 cm. So, we plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (8 + 12) × 10\n\nArea = (1/2) × 20 × 10\n\nArea = 10 × 10\n\nArea = 100 square centimeters\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 100 square centimeters."
