    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal, and its area after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (Initial line segment length)^2 * (1 - (2/3)^n) / (1 - 2/3)\n\nIn this case, the initial line segment length is 1 unit, and we want to find the area after 5 iterations.\n\nArea = (1)^2 * (1 - (2/3)^5) / (1 - 2/3)\nArea = (1) * (1 - 32/243) / (1/3)\nArea = (1) * (211/243) / (1/3)\nArea = (1) * (211/243) * 3\nArea = 211/81\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the Lévy C curve after 5 iterations is 211/81 square units."
