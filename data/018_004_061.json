    "message_2": "The complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set X that are not in set A. Since set A has 10 elements and the universal set X has 20 elements, there are 20 - 10 = 10 elements in the complement of set A.\n\nNow, let's prove that the complement of A is unique using set theory.\n\nAssume there are two complements of set A, A' and B, such that A' ≠ B. This means that there exists an element x in A' that is not in B, or an element y in B that is not in A'. Without loss of generality, let's consider the case where x ∈ A' and x ∉ B.\n\nSince x ∈ A', it means that x ∉ A (by definition of the complement). Also, since x ∉ B and B is a complement of A, it implies that x ∈ A (because B contains all elements not in A). This is a contradiction, as we have both x ∉ A and x ∈ A.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there are two different complements of set A is false, and the complement of A is unique."
