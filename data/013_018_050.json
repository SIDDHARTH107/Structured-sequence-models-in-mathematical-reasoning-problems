    "message_1": "In a Signaling Game, there are two types of players: Sender and Receiver. The Sender has two types, A and B, each type with an equal probability of being the Sender. The Receiver must guess the Sender's type and will receive a payoff of 2 if correct and 0 if incorrect. The Sender can choose to send a signal to help the Receiver guess correctly or not. If the Sender sends a signal, the Receiver must pay a cost of 1 to receive it. If the Sender does not send a signal, the Receiver makes a guess without any additional information.\n\nIf the Sender sends a signal, the Receiver's probability of guessing correctly increases from 0.5 to 0.75 if the Sender is type A, but only from 0.5 to 0.6 if the Sender is type B.\n\nWhat is the expected utility (payoff) for the Receiver if he or she chooses to pay for and receive the signal?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected utility for the Receiver, we need to consider the probabilities of each Sender type and the associated probabilities of guessing correctly.\n\n1. If the Sender is type A (probability = 0.5), the Receiver's probability of guessing correctly increases to 0.75. The payoff for a correct guess is 2, so the expected utility for this case is: 0.5 * 0.75 * 2 = 0.75\n\n2. If the Sender is type B (probability = 0.5), the Receiver's probability of guessing correctly increases to 0.6. The payoff for a correct guess is 2, so the expected utility for this case is: 0.5 * 0.6 * 2 = 0.6\n\nNow, we add the expected utilities for both cases: 0.75 + 0.6 = 1.35\n\nHowever, the Receiver has to pay a cost of 1 to receive the signal. So, the net expected utility for the Receiver if he or she chooses to pay for and receive the signal is: 1.35 - 1 = 0.35"
