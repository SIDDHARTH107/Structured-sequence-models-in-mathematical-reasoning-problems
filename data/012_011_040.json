    "message_2": "a) A cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In the given graph G, the cut vertices are B, C, and D. Removing any of these vertices will increase the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nb) A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In the given graph G, the bridges are the edges (B, C), (C, D), and (D, E). Removing any of these edges will increase the number of connected components in the graph."
