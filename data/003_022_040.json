    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the following formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √((-16)^2 + 8^2) = √(256 + 64) = √320 = 16√5\n|B| = √(12^2 + 5^2) = √(144 + 25) = √169 = 13\n\nNow, let's find the angle between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nTo find A · B, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = A_x * B_x + A_y * B_y\n\nA · B = (-16 * 12) + (8 * 5) = -192 + 40 = -152\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (-152) / (16√5 * 13)\nθ = arccos((-152) / (16√5 * 13))\n\nNow that we have the angle θ, we can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\nA · B = 16√5 * 13 * cos(θ)\n\nSince we already found A · B = -152, the dot product of the two vectors is -152."
