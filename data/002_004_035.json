    "message_2": "The perimeter of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula: P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nGiven the length (L) is 10 cm and the width (W) is 5 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = 2(10 + 5)\nP = 2(15)\nP = 30 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 30 cm."
