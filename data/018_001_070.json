    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set is a subset of a set A, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element in set A. \n\nBy definition, the empty set (denoted as âˆ… or {}) contains no elements. So, there are no elements in the empty set that we need to check for membership in set A.\n\nSet A = {2, 4, 6, 8} contains elements, but we don't need to check them since we are only concerned with the elements in the empty set.\n\nSince there are no elements in the empty set to contradict the statement that every element in the empty set is also an element in set A, we can conclude that the empty set is a subset of set A.\n\nIn general, the empty set is a subset of any set, because there are no elements in the empty set to contradict the subset condition."
