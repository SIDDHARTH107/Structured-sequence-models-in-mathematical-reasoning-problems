    "message_2": "To find the exact value of x in radians using inverse trigonometric functions, we can use the arcsin function, which is the inverse of the sine function. \n\nx = arcsin(0.5)\n\nSince we know that sin(π/6) = 0.5, we can say:\n\nx = π/6\n\nHowever, the sine function is also positive in the second quadrant. Therefore, another solution for x is:\n\nx = 5π/6\n\nSo, the exact values of x in radians are:\n\nx = π/6 and x = 5π/6"
