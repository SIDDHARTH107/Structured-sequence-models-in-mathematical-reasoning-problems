    "message_2": "Since H^*(X, Z) is isomorphic to the polynomial ring Z[x]/x^3, we know that the cohomology ring has only one generator x, and x^3 = 0. \n\nTo find the degree of the cohomology generator corresponding to x, we need to determine the degree of x in the cohomology ring. We can do this by looking at the degrees of the non-zero elements in the cohomology ring.\n\nThe cohomology ring H^*(X, Z) has the following non-zero elements:\n\n1. x^0 = 1, which is in degree 0.\n2. x^1 = x, which is in some degree n.\n3. x^2, which is in degree 2n.\n\nSince x^3 = 0, there are no non-zero elements in the cohomology ring with degree higher than 2n.\n\nNow, we know that the cohomology ring of a compact topological space is finitely generated and graded. Therefore, the degrees of the generators must be positive. Since x is a generator, its degree n must be positive.\n\nThus, the degree of the cohomology generator corresponding to x is n, where n is a positive integer."
