    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the sine formula for the area of a triangle: \n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nHowever, we don't have the angle between the base and the height. To find the angle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse and then use inverse trigonometric functions to find the angle.\n\nLet's call the base a, the height b, and the hypotenuse c. We have:\n\na = 8 cm\nb = 10 cm\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), we can find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\nc^2 = 8^2 + 10^2\nc^2 = 64 + 100\nc^2 = 164\nc = √164 ≈ 12.81 cm\n\nNow we can find the angle between the base and the height using the inverse tangent function:\n\nangle = arctan(opposite/adjacent)\nangle = arctan(b/a)\nangle = arctan(10/8)\nangle ≈ 51.34°\n\nNow we can use the sine formula for the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\nArea = (1/2) * 8 cm * 10 cm * sin(51.34°)\nArea ≈ 0.5 * 8 * 10 * 0.788\nArea ≈ 31.52 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 31.52 cm²."
