    "message_1": "A company produces three different products - product A, product B, and product C. Each product requires a certain number of labor hours as follows:\n\nProduct A: 2 labor hours\nProduct B: 3 labor hours\nProduct C: 4 labor hours\n\nThe company has 150 total labor hours available. How many of each product should the company produce in order to maximize their profit if the profit per unit is $10 for product A, $15 for product B, and $20 for product C?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we need to determine the profit per labor hour for each product:\n\nProfit per labor hour for Product A: $10 / 2 labor hours = $5 per labor hour\nProfit per labor hour for Product B: $15 / 3 labor hours = $5 per labor hour\nProfit per labor hour for Product C: $20 / 4 labor hours = $5 per labor hour\n\nSince all products have the same profit per labor hour, we can produce any combination of products as long as the total labor hours do not exceed 150.\n\nLet x, y, and z represent the number of units produced for Product A, Product B, and Product C, respectively. The constraint for the labor hours can be represented as:\n\n2x + 3y + 4z â‰¤ 150\n\nTo find a solution, we can choose any combination of x, y, and z that satisfies the constraint. For example, we can produce:\n\n1. 75 units of Product A (150 labor hours, $750 profit)\n2. 50 units of Product B (150 labor hours, $750 profit)\n3. 37.5 units of Product C (150 labor hours, $750 profit)\n4. A combination of all three products, such as 30 units of Product A, 20 units of Product B, and 10 units of Product C (150 labor hours, $750 profit)\n\nIn all cases, the maximum profit is $750."
