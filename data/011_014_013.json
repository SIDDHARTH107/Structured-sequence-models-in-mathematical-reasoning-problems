    "message_2": "To determine the number of connected components in a graph G with 7 vertices and 9 edges, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of connected components = (Number of vertices) - (Number of edges) + k\n\nwhere k is the number of isolated vertices (vertices with no edges connected to them).\n\nSince we don't have information about the isolated vertices, we can't determine the exact number of connected components. However, we can find the minimum and maximum number of connected components.\n\nMinimum number of connected components:\nIn this case, we assume that there are no isolated vertices (k = 0). The graph is connected, and all vertices are part of a single connected component.\n\nMinimum connected components = (7 vertices) - (9 edges) + 0 = -2 + 7 = 5\n\nHowever, since the number of connected components cannot be negative, the minimum number of connected components is 1.\n\nMaximum number of connected components:\nIn this case, we assume that there are as many isolated vertices as possible. Since the graph has 9 edges, the maximum number of isolated vertices is 2 (as the remaining 5 vertices can form a connected graph with 9 edges). So, k = 2.\n\nMaximum connected components = (7 vertices) - (9 edges) + 2 = -2 + 7 = 5\n\nTherefore, the graph G with 7 vertices and 9 edges can have between 1 and 5 connected components."
