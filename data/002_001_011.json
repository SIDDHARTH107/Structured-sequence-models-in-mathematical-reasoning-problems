    "message_2": "The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 4 cm and the height is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (4 * 6) / 2\nArea = 24 / 2\nArea = 12 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 12 square centimeters."
