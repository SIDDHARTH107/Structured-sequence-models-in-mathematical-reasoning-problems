    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first need to represent the given system as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the vector of variables, and b is the constant vector.\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 5  6  7 |\n    | 8  9 10 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 18 |\n    | 36 |\n    | 57 |\n\nNow, we can represent the matrix A as a sparse matrix. However, since there are no zero elements in the matrix A, it is not a sparse matrix. In this case, we can proceed to solve the system of linear equations using other methods, such as Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule.\n\nUsing Gaussian elimination, we can perform the following operations:\n\n1. Subtract 2.5 times the first row from the second row, and 4 times the first row from the third row:\n\nA = |  2   3   4  |\n    |  0  -1.5 -3  |\n    |  0  -3  -6  |\n\nb = | 18  |\n    |  9  |\n    | 21  |\n\n2. Multiply the second row by -2/3:\n\nA = |  2   3   4  |\n    |  0   1   2  |\n    |  0  -3  -6  |\n\nb = | 18  |\n    | -6  |\n    | 21  |\n\n3. Add the second row to the third row:\n\nA = |  2   3   4  |\n    |  0   1   2  |\n    |  0   0   0  |\n\nb = | 18  |\n    | -6  |\n    | 15  |\n\nFrom the last row, we have 0x + 0y + 0z = 15, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the given system of linear equations has no solution."
