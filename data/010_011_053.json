    "message_2": "To prove that $S^n$ is not homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \\geq 2$, we will show that they have different topological properties. Specifically, we will show that $S^n$ is compact while $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is not.\n\nRecall that a space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover. We will first show that $S^n$ is compact. Consider an arbitrary open cover $\\{U_\\alpha\\}$ of $S^n$. Since $S^n$ is a closed and bounded subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, it is compact by the Heine-Borel theorem. Therefore, there exists a finite subcover $\\{U_{\\alpha_1}, U_{\\alpha_2}, \\dots, U_{\\alpha_k}\\}$ that covers $S^n$. This shows that $S^n$ is compact.\n\nNow, we will show that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is not compact. Consider the open cover $\\{(-n, n)^n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This cover consists of open $n$-dimensional cubes centered at the origin with side length $2n$. Notice that for any finite subcollection of these cubes, there exists a point in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ that is not covered by the subcollection. Specifically, let $N$ be the largest integer such that $(-N, N)^n$ is in the subcollection. Then the point $(N+1, 0, \\dots, 0)$ is not covered by the subcollection. This shows that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is not compact.\n\nSince $S^n$ is compact and $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is not, they cannot be homeomorphic, as homeomorphisms preserve compactness. Therefore, $S^n$ is not homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \\geq 2$."
