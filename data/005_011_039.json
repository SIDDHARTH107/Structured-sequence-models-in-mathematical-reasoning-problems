They have two groups of tomato plants, one group will be treated with the new fertilizer and the other group with the old fertilizer. They randomly select 20 tomato plants for each group. After two months, they measure the height (in cm) of each plant. The data collected is shown below:\n\n| New Fertilizer | Old Fertilizer |\n| --- | --- |\n| 30 | 24 |\n| 28 | 22 |\n| 32 | 23 |\n| 34 | 26 |\n| 31 | 27 |\n| 33 | 25 |\n| 29 | 23 |\n| 30 | 21 |\n| 32 | 24 |\n| 31 | 22 |\n| 27 | 25 |\n| 33 | 23 |\n| 31 | 24 |\n| 30 | 22 |\n| 28 | 20 |\n| 29 | 24 |\n| 32 | 25 |\n| 33 | 22 |\n| 31 | 23 |\n| 29 | 26 |\n\nDetermine whether there is a significant difference in the mean height of tomato plants grown with the new fertilizer compared to the old fertilizer using a two-sample t-test with a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether there is a significant difference in the mean height of tomato plants grown with the new fertilizer compared to the old fertilizer, we will perform a two-sample t-test with a significance level of 0.05.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean and standard deviation for each group:\n\nNew Fertilizer:\nMean (M1) = (30+28+32+34+31+33+29+30+32+31+27+33+31+30+28+29+32+33+31+29)/20 = 620/20 = 31\nStandard Deviation (SD1) = √[(Σ(x - M1)^2) / (n-1)] = √[(2^2+3^2+1^2+3^2+0^2+2^2+1^2+2^2+1^2+0^2+4^2+2^2+0^2+1^2+3^2+1^2+1^2+2^2+0^2+2^2)/19] = √[104/19] ≈ 2.33\n\nOld Fertilizer:\nMean (M2) = (24+22+23+26+27+25+23+21+24+22+25+23+24+22+20+24+25+22+23+26)/20 = 480/20 = 24\nStandard Deviation (SD2) = √[(Σ(x - M2)^2) / (n-1)] = √[(0^2+2^2+1^2+2^2+3^2+1^2+1^2+3^2+0^2+2^2+1^2+1^2+0^2+2^2+4^2+0^2+1^2+2^2+1^2+2^2)/19] = √[84/19] ≈ 2.11\n\nNow, we can calculate the t-value using the formula:\n\nt = (M1 - M2) / √[(SD1^2/n1) + (SD2^2/n2)] = (31 - 24) / √[(2.33^2/20) + (2.11^2/20)] ≈ 7 / √[0.2701 + 0.2231] ≈ 7 / √[0.4932] ≈ 7 / 0.7023 ≈ 9.97\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n1 + n2 - 2 = 20 + 20 - 2 = 38. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately 2.024.\n\nSince our calculated t-value (9.97) is greater than the critical t-value (2.024), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the mean height of tomato plants grown with the new fertilizer compared to the old fertilizer. Therefore, there is a significant difference in the mean height of tomato plants grown with the new fertilizer compared to the old fertilizer at a significance level of 0.05."
