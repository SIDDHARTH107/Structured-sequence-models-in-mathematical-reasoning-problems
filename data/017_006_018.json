    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 35, we know that |G| = 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, a group of order p * q, where p and q are distinct prime numbers, is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders p and q.\n\nTherefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups, one of order 5 and the other of order 7."
