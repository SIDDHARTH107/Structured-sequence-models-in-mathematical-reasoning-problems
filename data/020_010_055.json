    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products P1 and P2. The production time for product P1 is 2 hours/unit and for P2 is 4 hours/unit. The total available production time is 120 hours per day. Each unit of P1 gives a profit of $100 and each unit of P2 gives a profit of $200. However, due to uncertainty in the supply of raw materials, there is a 20% chance that the production time for a unit of P2 may increase by 1 hour. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their expected profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product P1 and y be the number of units of product P2.\n\nThe production time constraint can be written as:\n2x + 4y ≤ 120\n\nThe expected profit function can be written as:\nE[Profit] = 100x + (1 - 0.2) * 200y + 0.2 * 200(y - 1)\n\nSimplifying the expected profit function:\nE[Profit] = 100x + 160y + 40y - 40\nE[Profit] = 100x + 200y - 40\n\nNow, we need to maximize the expected profit function subject to the production time constraint.\n\nFirst, let's solve the constraint for y:\ny ≤ (120 - 2x) / 4\ny ≤ 30 - 0.5x\n\nNow, we will use the graphical method to find the feasible region and corner points. The feasible region is the set of all points (x, y) that satisfy the constraint. In this case, the feasible region is a triangle with vertices A(0, 0), B(0, 30), and C(60, 0).\n\nLet's evaluate the expected profit function at each of these corner points:\n\nA(0, 0):\nE[Profit] = 100(0) + 200(0) - 40 = -$40\n\nB(0, 30):\nE[Profit] = 100(0) + 200(30) - 40 = $5,960\n\nC(60, 0):\nE[Profit] = 100(60) + 200(0) - 40 = $5,960\n\nThe maximum expected profit occurs at points B and C, with a value of $5,960. Therefore, the company can either produce 30 units of product P2 and no units of product P1, or produce 60 units of product P1 and no units of product P2 to maximize their expected profit."
