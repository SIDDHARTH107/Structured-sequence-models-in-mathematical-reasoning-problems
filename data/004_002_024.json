    "message_2": "To evaluate the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 1)/(x-1) as x approaches 1, we can first try to simplify the function. We can factor the numerator:\n\nx^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\n\nNow the function becomes:\n\nf(x) = ((x - 1)(x + 1))/(x - 1)\n\nWe can cancel out the (x - 1) terms in the numerator and denominator:\n\nf(x) = x + 1\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 1:\n\nlim (x -> 1) (x + 1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 1)/(x-1) as x approaches 1 is 2."
