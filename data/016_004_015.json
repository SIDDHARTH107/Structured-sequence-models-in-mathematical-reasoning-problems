    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can tell you that calculating the exact area of a filled-in Julia set is a highly complex task that cannot be easily done by hand or with a simple formula. The Julia set is a fractal, and its area depends on the intricate structure of the set, which is determined by the complex number given.\n\nThe filled-in Julia set is the set of all complex numbers z for which the sequence z, f(z), f(f(z)), ... remains bounded, where f(z) = z^2 + c, and c is the given complex number (-0.75 + 0.1i in this case).\n\nTo approximate the area of the filled-in Julia set, one would typically use numerical methods and computer algorithms, such as the escape-time algorithm. This involves iterating the function f(z) for each point in a grid of complex numbers and checking if the sequence remains bounded. The area can then be estimated by counting the number of grid points that are part of the filled-in Julia set and multiplying by the area of each grid cell.\n\nHowever, this estimation process requires specialized software and computational resources, which are beyond the scope of this platform. I recommend using a fractal-generating software or programming language with numerical libraries to perform this task."
