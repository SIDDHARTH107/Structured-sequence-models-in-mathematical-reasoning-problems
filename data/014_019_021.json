    "message_2": "To determine the number of rows used in the transposition matrix, we first need to find the length of the plaintext message and the possible factors of that length.\n\nThe plaintext message is \"INTERMEDIATECRYPTOGRAPHYTOOLS\" which has a length of 28 characters.\n\nNow, let's find the factors of 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28.\n\nSince the transposition matrix must have at least 2 rows and 2 columns, we can eliminate 1 and 28 as possible numbers of rows. This leaves us with the possible row numbers: 2, 4, 7, and 14.\n\nNow, let's try to decrypt the ciphertext using each of these possible row numbers and see if we get the original plaintext message.\n\n1. If the matrix has 2 rows, the decryption would look like this:\n\nI O T N R A\nZ A M O D A\nE G E S C L\nY O T O S R\nO I V T\n\nThe resulting plaintext would be \"IZOYEAOOGTMTNRAOESDACLIVTSOR\", which is not the original plaintext message.\n\n2. If the matrix has 4 rows, the decryption would look like this:\n\nI O T N R A\nZ A M O D A\nE G E S C L\nY O T O S R\nO I V T\n\nThe resulting plaintext would be \"INTERMEDIATECRYPTOGRAPHYTOOLS\", which is the original plaintext message.\n\nTherefore, the number of rows used in the transposition matrix for encryption is 4."
