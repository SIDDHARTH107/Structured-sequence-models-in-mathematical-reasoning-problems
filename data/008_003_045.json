    "message_2": "To determine the rank of matrix A using Gaussian elimination method, we need to perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nMatrix A:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 4 & 8 \\\\ 3 & 6 & 12 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row and 3 times the first row from the third row.\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. The rank of a matrix is the number of non-zero rows in its row-echelon form.\n\nIn this case, there is only 1 non-zero row.\n\nTherefore, the rank of matrix A is 1."
