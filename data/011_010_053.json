    "message_2": "Let's use the hint and solve this problem using Catalan numbers. We can model this problem as a sequence of 0s and 1s, where 0 represents an open entrance and 1 represents a closed entrance. We want to find the number of sequences of length 8 with no two consecutive 1s.\n\nLet C_n be the number of valid sequences of length n. The Catalan numbers can be defined using the following recurrence relation:\n\nC_0 = 1\nC_n = Î£ (C_i * C_(n-i-1)) for i = 0 to n-1, for n > 0\n\nWe want to find C_8. Using the recurrence relation, we can compute the first few Catalan numbers:\n\nC_0 = 1\nC_1 = C_0 * C_0 = 1\nC_2 = C_0 * C_1 + C_1 * C_0 = 1 + 1 = 2\nC_3 = C_0 * C_2 + C_1 * C_1 + C_2 * C_0 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5\nC_4 = C_0 * C_3 + C_1 * C_2 + C_2 * C_1 + C_3 * C_0 = 5 + 2 + 2 + 5 = 14\nC_5 = C_0 * C_4 + C_1 * C_3 + C_2 * C_2 + C_3 * C_1 + C_4 * C_0 = 14 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 14 = 42\nC_6 = C_0 * C_5 + C_1 * C_4 + C_2 * C_3 + C_3 * C_2 + C_4 * C_1 + C_5 * C_0 = 42 + 14 + 10 + 10 + 14 + 42 = 132\nC_7 = C_0 * C_6 + C_1 * C_5 + C_2 * C_4 + C_3 * C_3 + C_4 * C_2 + C_5 * C_1 + C_6 * C_0 = 132 + 42 + 28 + 25 + 28 + 42 + 132 = 429\n\nSo, there are C_8 = 429 ways to close the entrances so that no two adjacent entrances are closed."
