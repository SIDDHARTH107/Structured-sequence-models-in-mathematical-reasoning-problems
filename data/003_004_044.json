    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x in the equation:\n\ncos(x) + 0.5 = 1\n\nFirst, subtract 0.5 from both sides of the equation:\n\ncos(x) = 1 - 0.5\n\ncos(x) = 0.5\n\nNow, we need to find the angle x whose cosine is 0.5. Since x lies between 0 and 360 degrees, we can find the angles in the first and fourth quadrants where the cosine is positive.\n\nx = cos^(-1)(0.5)\n\nx = 60 degrees (in the first quadrant)\n\nFor the fourth quadrant, we can find the angle by subtracting 60 degrees from 360 degrees:\n\nx = 360 - 60\n\nx = 300 degrees (in the fourth quadrant)\n\nSo, the two possible values of x are:\n\nx = 60 degrees and x = 300 degrees"
