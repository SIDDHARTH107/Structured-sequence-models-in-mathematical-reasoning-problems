    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct proof terms for each formula, we will analyze each formula separately:\n\n1. A ⊸ B:\nThere is only one proof term for this formula, which is λx. B, where x is of type A. This term represents a function that takes an input of type A and returns a value of type B.\n\n2. (A ⊸ B) ⊗ B:\nThere are two proof terms for this formula, up to logical equivalence. The first one is (λx. B, B), which represents a pair of a function that takes an input of type A and returns a value of type B, and a value of type B. The second one is (λx. B, λy. B), which represents a pair of two functions that take inputs of types A and B, respectively, and both return a value of type B.\n\n3. A ⊕ B:\nThere are two proof terms for this formula, up to logical equivalence. The first one is inl, which represents a value of type A. The second one is inr, which represents a value of type B.\n\n4. !(A ⊸ B):\nThere is only one proof term for this formula, which is !λx. B, where x is of type A. This term represents a function that takes an input of type A and returns a value of type B, but with the additional property that it can be used multiple times (i.e., it is a \"persistent\" function).\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 distinct proof terms for these formulas, up to logical equivalence."
