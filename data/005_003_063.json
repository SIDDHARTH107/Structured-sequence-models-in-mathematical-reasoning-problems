Given the following data: \n\nAdvertising expenditure (X) (in thousands): 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 \nSales (Y) (in millions): 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\n\na) Find the equation of the regression line for predicting sales using advertising expenditure.\nb) If the company spends $35,000 on advertising, what is the predicted sales amount?\nc) Interpret the coefficient of determination (R²) obtained from the regression analysis.",
    "message_2": "a) To find the equation of the regression line, we first need to calculate the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a) using the given data.\n\nThe slope (b) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nb = Σ[(Xi - X_mean)(Yi - Y_mean)] / Σ(Xi - X_mean)²\n\nwhere Xi and Yi are the individual data points, and X_mean and Y_mean are the means of the X and Y data sets.\n\nX_mean = (10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50) / 5 = 30\nY_mean = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 5 = 6\n\nNow, we can calculate the slope (b):\n\nb = [(10-30)(2-6) + (20-30)(4-6) + (30-30)(6-6) + (40-30)(8-6) + (50-30)(10-6)] / [(10-30)² + (20-30)² + (30-30)² + (40-30)² + (50-30)²]\nb = [(-20)(-4) + (-10)(-2) + (0)(0) + (10)(2) + (20)(4)] / [(-20)² + (-10)² + (0)² + (10)² + (20)²]\nb = [80 + 20 + 0 + 20 + 80] / [400 + 100 + 0 + 100 + 400]\nb = 200 / 1000\nb = 0.2\n\nNext, we can calculate the y-intercept (a) using the formula:\n\na = Y_mean - b * X_mean\na = 6 - 0.2 * 30\na = 6 - 6\na = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the regression line is:\n\nY = 0.2X\n\nb) To predict the sales amount when the company spends $35,000 on advertising, we can plug the value of X = 35 into the regression equation:\n\nY = 0.2 * 35\nY = 7\n\nThe predicted sales amount is $7 million.\n\nc) Since the data points lie perfectly on a straight line, the coefficient of determination (R²) is 1. This means that 100% of the variation in sales can be explained by the variation in advertising expenditure. In other words, the regression model perfectly predicts the sales based on advertising expenditure."
