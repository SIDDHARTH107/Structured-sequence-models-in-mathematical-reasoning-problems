    "message_1": "A flagpole stands 20 feet high. At a certain time of day, the shadow of the flagpole is 25 feet long. What is the angle of elevation of the sun? Use trigonometry to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (the height of the flagpole) to the adjacent side (the length of the shadow).\n\nLet's denote the angle of elevation of the sun as θ. Then, we can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(θ) = height of flagpole / length of shadow\ntan(θ) = 20 feet / 25 feet\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ. To do this, we can use the inverse tangent function (arctan or tan^(-1)):\n\nθ = arctan(tan(θ))\nθ = arctan(20/25)\nθ = arctan(0.8)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 38.66 degrees\n\nSo, the angle of elevation of the sun is approximately 38.66 degrees."
