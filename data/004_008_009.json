    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = x^2 at the point (2, 4), we need to find the slope of the tangent line at that point. We can do this by finding the derivative of the function y = x^2 with respect to x, and then evaluating the derivative at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of y = x^2 with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = 2x\n\nNow, we evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\ndy/dx(2) = 2(2) = 4\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at the point (2, 4) is 4.\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line. The point-slope form is:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is the point on the line and m is the slope. In this case, (x1, y1) = (2, 4) and m = 4. Plugging these values into the point-slope form, we get:\n\ny - 4 = 4(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\ny - 4 = 4x - 8\n\ny = 4x - 4\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = x^2 at the point (2, 4) is y = 4x - 4."
