    "message_1": "A weather model predicts that a slight change in the initial air temperature will cause the temperature to rise by 1 degree Fahrenheit after 24 hours. If the initial temperature is 75 degrees Fahrenheit and the model is accurate, what will be the temperature after 10 days (240 hours)?",
    "message_2": "If the temperature rises by 1 degree Fahrenheit after 24 hours, then after 10 days (240 hours), the temperature will rise by 10 degrees Fahrenheit (since 240 hours is 10 times 24 hours). \n\nSo, if the initial temperature is 75 degrees Fahrenheit, after 10 days, the temperature will be:\n\n75 + 10 = 85 degrees Fahrenheit."
