    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root.\n\n$(\\sqrt{x+9})^2 = 5^2$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$x+9 = 25$\n\nNow, we will subtract 9 from both sides of the equation to isolate x:\n\n$x+9-9 = 25-9$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$x = 16$\n\nSo, the solution is $x = 16$."
