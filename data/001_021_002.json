    "message_2": "To find the roots of the polynomial equation 3x^3 + 5x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0, we can try to factor the polynomial or use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or synthetic division. However, factoring a cubic polynomial can be quite complex, and numerical methods may not provide exact solutions.\n\nIn this case, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial with integer coefficients, then p must be a factor of the constant term, and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nFor the given polynomial, the constant term is -8, and the leading coefficient is 3. The factors of -8 are ±1, ±2, ±4, and ±8, while the factors of 3 are ±1 and ±3. So, the possible rational roots are:\n\n±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±1/3, ±2/3, ±4/3, and ±8/3\n\nNow, we can test these possible roots by plugging them into the polynomial equation:\n\n3(1)^3 + 5(1)^2 - 2(1) - 8 = -2 (not a root)\n3(-1)^3 + 5(-1)^2 - 2(-1) - 8 = -6 (not a root)\n3(2)^3 + 5(2)^2 - 2(2) - 8 = 34 (not a root)\n3(-2)^3 + 5(-2)^2 - 2(-2) - 8 = -14 (not a root)\n3(4)^3 + 5(4)^2 - 2(4) - 8 = 212 (not a root)\n3(-4)^3 + 5(-4)^2 - 2(-4) - 8 = -44 (not a root)\n3(8)^3 + 5(8)^2 - 2(8) - 8 = 1664 (not a root)\n3(-8)^3 + 5(-8)^2 - 2(-8) - 8 = -1528 (not a root)\n\n3(1/3)^3 + 5(1/3)^2 - 2(1/3) - 8 = -7 (not a root)\n3(-1/3)^3 + 5(-1/3)^2 - 2(-1/3) - 8 = -7 (not a root)\n3(2/3)^3 + 5(2/3)^2 - 2(2/3) - 8 = -2 (not a root)\n3(-2/3)^3 + 5(-2/3)^2 - 2(-2/3) - 8 = -2 (not a root)\n3(4/3)^3 + 5(4/3)^2 - 2(4/3) - 8 = 22 (not a root)\n3(-4/3)^3 + 5(-4/3)^2 - 2(-4/3) - 8 = 10 (not a root)\n\n3(8/3)^3 + 5(8/3)^2 - 2(8/3) - 8 = 0 (root)\n3(-8/3)^3 + 5(-8/3)^2 - 2(-8/3) - 8 = 0 (root)\n\nSo, the rational roots of the polynomial equation are x = 8/3 and x = -8/3. The polynomial can be factored as:\n\n3x^3 + 5x^2 - 2x - 8 = (x - 8/3)(x + 8/3)(3x - 1)\n\nNow, we can find the remaining root by setting the last factor equal to zero:\n\n3x - 1 = 0\n3x = 1\nx = 1/3\n\nThus, the roots of the polynomial equation 3x^3 + 5x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0 are x = 8/3, x = -8/3, and x = 1/3."
