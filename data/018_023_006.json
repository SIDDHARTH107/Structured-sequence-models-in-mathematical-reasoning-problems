    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) and C, denoted as (A △ B) × C. The Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, c) where a is in A △ B and c is in C.\n\n(A △ B) × C = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and C, denoted as B △ C.\n\nB △ C = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and (B △ C), denoted as A × (B △ C).\n\nA × (B △ C) = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,5)}\n\nAs we can see, the results of (A △ B) × C and A × (B △ C) are different:\n\n(A △ B) × C = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)}\n\nA × (B △ C) = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,5)}\n\nThis shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product."
