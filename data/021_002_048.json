    "message_2": "To use the power iteration method, we first need to choose an initial vector. Let's choose the initial vector x0 = [1, 1]. Now, we will perform the power iteration method by repeatedly multiplying the matrix A by the current vector and normalizing the result.\n\n1. Multiply A by x0:\nA * x0 = [[3, 1], [2, 2]] * [1, 1] = [4, 4]\n\n2. Normalize the result:\nx1 = [4/√32, 4/√32] = [1/√2, 1/√2]\n\n3. Multiply A by x1:\nA * x1 = [[3, 1], [2, 2]] * [1/√2, 1/√2] = [2√2, 2√2]\n\n4. Normalize the result:\nx2 = [2√2/4, 2√2/4] = [1/√2, 1/√2]\n\nNotice that x2 is the same as x1. This means that we have converged to the dominant eigenvector. Now, we can find the dominant eigenvalue by multiplying A by the eigenvector and dividing the result by the eigenvector:\n\nA * x2 = [[3, 1], [2, 2]] * [1/√2, 1/√2] = [2√2, 2√2]\n\nDivide the result by x2:\n[2√2, 2√2] / [1/√2, 1/√2] = [4, 4]\n\nThe dominant eigenvalue is 4, and the corresponding eigenvector is [1/√2, 1/√2]."
