    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function over the interval [-2, 4], we need to find the critical points and endpoints of the function. \n\nFirst, let's find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 + 9(-2) + 2 = -8 - 24 - 18 + 2 = -48\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 2 = 1 - 6 + 9 + 2 = 6\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 2 = 27 - 54 + 27 + 2 = 2\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 6(4)^2 + 9(4) + 2 = 64 - 96 + 36 + 2 = 6\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical points and endpoints, we find that the maximum value is 6 and the minimum value is -48.\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function over the interval [-2, 4] is 6, and the minimum value is -48."
