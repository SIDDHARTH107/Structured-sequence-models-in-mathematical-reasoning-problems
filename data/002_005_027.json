    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 12 cm. What is the length of the diagonal that runs from one corner of the rectangular prism to the opposite corner?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nIn this case, the length is 8 cm, the width is 6 cm, and the height is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiagonal = √(8² + 6² + 12²)\nDiagonal = √(64 + 36 + 144)\nDiagonal = √244\nDiagonal ≈ 15.62 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal that runs from one corner of the rectangular prism to the opposite corner is approximately 15.62 cm."
