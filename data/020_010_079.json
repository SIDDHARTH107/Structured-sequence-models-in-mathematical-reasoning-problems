The actual volume of the mugs produced varies from 430 ml to 470 ml due to manufacturing variations. The cost of manufacturing a mug with a volume of \"v\" ml is given by C(v) = 0.002v^3 - 0.12v^2 + 4v + 500. Find the volume at which the manufacturing cost is minimum, and determine the minimum cost. Also, find the range of volumes for which the cost will not exceed $6 per mug.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume at which the manufacturing cost is minimum, we need to find the critical points of the cost function C(v) by taking its derivative and setting it equal to zero. \n\nC'(v) = dC(v)/dv = 0.006v^2 - 0.24v + 4\n\nNow, we set C'(v) = 0 and solve for v:\n\n0.006v^2 - 0.24v + 4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions:\n\nv = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 0.006, b = -0.24, and c = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nv = (0.24 ± √((-0.24)^2 - 4 * 0.006 * 4)) / (2 * 0.006)\n\nv = (0.24 ± √(0.0576 - 0.096)) / 0.012\n\nv = (0.24 ± √(-0.0384)) / 0.012\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for v. This means that the cost function C(v) does not have a minimum value within the given range of volumes (430 ml to 470 ml).\n\nNow, let's find the range of volumes for which the cost will not exceed $6 per mug. We need to solve the inequality:\n\nC(v) = 0.002v^3 - 0.12v^2 + 4v + 500 <= 506\n\n0.002v^3 - 0.12v^2 + 4v - 6 <= 0\n\nSince this is a cubic inequality, it is difficult to solve algebraically. We can use numerical methods or graphing to find the range of volumes that satisfy the inequality. By graphing the function, we can estimate the range of volumes to be approximately:\n\nv ≈ 438 ml to 462 ml\n\nSo, the range of volumes for which the cost will not exceed $6 per mug is approximately 438 ml to 462 ml."
