    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. A complete subgraph is a subset of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph:\n\nVertices 1, 2, and 3 form a complete subgraph, as all pairs of vertices are connected by edges {1, 2}, {1, 3}, and {2, 3}. Similarly, vertices 4, 5, and 6 also form a complete subgraph, as all pairs of vertices are connected by edges {4, 5}, {4, 6}, and {5, 6}.\n\nHowever, there is no complete subgraph with 4 or more vertices in the given graph. Therefore, the clique number of the graph is 3."
