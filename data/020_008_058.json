The cost of installing a cable between any two offices is shown in the table below:\n\n| From/To | Office 1 | Office 2 | Office 3 | Office 4 | Office 5 |\n|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Office 1|    0     |   50     |   70     |   90     |   120    |\n| Office 2|   50     |    0     |   60     |   80     |   100    |\n| Office 3|   70     |   60     |    0     |   40     |   80     |\n| Office 4|   90     |   80     |   40     |    0     |   50     |\n| Office 5|  120     |  100     |   80     |   50     |    0     |\n\nThe company wants to connect all the offices while minimizing the cost. What is the minimum total cost of installing the cables? Which offices are connected to each other directly?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum total cost of installing the cables, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. This algorithm works by sorting all the edges (cable connections) in increasing order of their weights (costs) and then adding the edges one by one to the minimum spanning tree while ensuring that adding the edge doesn't form a cycle.\n\nSorted edges by cost:\n1. Office 3 - Office 4 (40)\n2. Office 4 - Office 5 (50)\n3. Office 1 - Office 2 (50)\n4. Office 2 - Office 3 (60)\n5. Office 3 - Office 5 (80)\n6. Office 2 - Office 4 (80)\n7. Office 1 - Office 3 (70)\n8. Office 1 - Office 4 (90)\n9. Office 2 - Office 5 (100)\n10. Office 1 - Office 5 (120)\n\nNow, we add the edges one by one to the minimum spanning tree:\n\n1. Add edge Office 3 - Office 4 (40)\n2. Add edge Office 4 - Office 5 (50)\n3. Add edge Office 1 - Office 2 (50)\n4. Add edge Office 2 - Office 3 (60)\n\nAt this point, all offices are connected, and adding any more edges would create a cycle. So, we stop here.\n\nThe minimum total cost of installing the cables is 40 + 50 + 50 + 60 = 200.\n\nThe offices are connected directly as follows:\n- Office 1 is connected to Office 2\n- Office 2 is connected to Office 3\n- Office 3 is connected to Office 4\n- Office 4 is connected to Office 5"
