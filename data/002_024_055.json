    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm, a length of parallel sides 10 cm and 15 cm respectively. Find its perimeter.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the two non-parallel sides a and b.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of these sides. Since the height is perpendicular to the parallel sides, we can form two right triangles by drawing a line from the top vertex of the trapezium to the base.\n\nLet's consider the right triangle formed by the height, side a, and the portion of the base that is 10 cm long. Let's call the length of this portion x. Then, the other right triangle is formed by the height, side b, and the remaining portion of the base, which is (15 - x) cm long.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for the first right triangle:\na^2 = 8^2 + x^2\n\nAnd for the second right triangle:\nb^2 = 8^2 + (15 - x)^2\n\nWe don't have enough information to find the exact values of a and b, but we can express the perimeter of the trapezium in terms of x:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + 10 + 15\nPerimeter = sqrt(8^2 + x^2) + sqrt(8^2 + (15 - x)^2) + 25\n\nWithout additional information, this is the most simplified expression for the perimeter of the trapezium."
