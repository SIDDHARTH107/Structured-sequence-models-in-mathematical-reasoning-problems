    "message_2": "To prove this statement using intuitionistic logic, we will use the concept of constructive proofs. Intuitionistic logic requires that we provide an explicit construction or algorithm to find the desired object (in this case, the smallest prime number greater than n).\n\nLet n be any natural number. We will construct a number m that is the smallest prime number greater than n. \n\n1. Define the function P(x) to be true if x is prime and false otherwise.\n2. Define the function S(x) to be the smallest natural number greater than x such that P(S(x)) is true.\n3. We will now construct the number m = S(n).\n\nTo show that m is the smallest prime number greater than n, we need to prove two things:\n\nA. m is a prime number.\nB. There is no prime number between n and m.\n\nProof of A:\nBy the definition of the function S(x), P(S(n)) is true. Since m = S(n), P(m) is true, which means m is a prime number.\n\nProof of B:\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a prime number p such that n < p < m. Since p is greater than n and smaller than m, we can say that P(p) is true and p < S(n). But this contradicts the definition of S(x), which states that S(x) is the smallest natural number greater than x such that P(S(x)) is true. Therefore, there cannot be any prime number between n and m.\n\nThus, we have shown that m is the smallest prime number greater than n using intuitionistic logic."
