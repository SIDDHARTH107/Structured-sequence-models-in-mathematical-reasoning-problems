    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The total length of the Hilbert curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (2^n - 1) * a\n\nwhere n is the order of the curve and a is the length of one side of the square that the curve fills.\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 4, we have:\n\nLength = (2^4 - 1) * a\nLength = (16 - 1) * a\nLength = 15 * a\n\nHowever, without knowing the length of one side of the square (a), we cannot determine the exact total length of the Hilbert curve of order 4. If you provide the value of a, I can calculate the total length for you."
