Suppose that an image with intensity function u(x,y,0) is given as:\n\n u(x,y,0) = 10 for 2 ≤ x ≤ 4, 2 ≤ y ≤ 4\n u(x,y,0) = 0 elsewhere\n \nIf k = 0.5, find the image intensity function u(x,y,t) at t=2.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat (or in this case, image intensity) in a given region over time. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = k (∂^2u/∂x^2 + ∂^2u/∂y^2)\n\nwhere u(x,y,t) represents the image intensity function, k is a constant, and x and y represent the image coordinates. We are given the initial condition:\n\nu(x,y,0) = 10 for 2 ≤ x ≤ 4, 2 ≤ y ≤ 4\nu(x,y,0) = 0 elsewhere\n\nTo find the image intensity function u(x,y,t) at t=2, we need to solve the heat equation with the given initial condition and k = 0.5. We can do this by using the method of separation of variables. Let u(x,y,t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Then, the heat equation becomes:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = k(X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t))\n\nDivide both sides by kXYT:\n\nT'(t)/T(t) = (X''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y))/k\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t)/T(t) = -λ/k\nX''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -λ1\nY''(y)/Y(y) = -λ2\n\nwhere λ1 + λ2 = λ.\n\nSolving these ODEs, we get:\n\nX(x) = A1sin(√λ1x) + B1cos(√λ1x)\nY(y) = A2sin(√λ2y) + B2cos(√λ2y)\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions. Since u(x,y,0) = 0 for x < 2 and x > 4, we have:\n\nX(0) = B1 = 0\nX(4) = A1sin(2√λ1) = 0\n\nFor non-zero A1, sin(2√λ1) = 0, which implies that √λ1 = nπ/2 for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSimilarly, for y < 2 and y > 4, we have:\n\nY(0) = B2 = 0\nY(4) = A2sin(2√λ2) = 0\n\nFor non-zero A2, sin(2√λ2) = 0, which implies that √λ2 = mπ/2 for m = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, we have:\n\nX(x) = A1sin(nπx/2)\nY(y) = A2sin(mπy/2)\n\nThe general solution is given by:\n\nu(x,y,t) = ∑∑T(t)X(x)Y(y)\n\nwhere the summation is taken over all possible values of n and m.\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients A1 and A2 and the time-dependent part T(t). To do this, we use the initial condition u(x,y,0) = 10 for 2 ≤ x ≤ 4, 2 ≤ y ≤ 4. We can expand the initial condition in terms of the eigenfunctions:\n\nu(x,y,0) = ∑∑A1A2sin(nπx/2)sin(mπy/2)\n\nTo find the coefficients A1A2, we can use the orthogonality property of sine functions. Multiply both sides by sin(pπx/2)sin(qπy/2) and integrate over the region 2 ≤ x ≤ 4, 2 ≤ y ≤ 4:\n\n∫∫u(x,y,0)sin(pπx/2)sin(qπy/2)dxdy = ∑∑A1A2∫∫sin(nπx/2)sin(mπy/2)sin(pπx/2)sin(qπy/2)dxdy\n\nThe right side of the equation will be non-zero only when n = p and m = q. Therefore, we have:\n\nA1A2 = (1/4)∫∫u(x,y,0)sin(nπx/2)sin(mπy/2)dxdy\n\nNow, we can find the time-dependent part T(t) by solving the ODE:\n\nT'(t)/T(t) = -λ/k\n\nThis gives:\n\nT(t) = C1exp(-λt/k)\n\nFinally, the solution u(x,y,t) is given by:\n\nu(x,y,t) = ∑∑A1A2exp(-λt/k)sin(nπx/2)sin(mπy/2)\n\nTo find the image intensity function u(x,y,t) at t=2, we need to compute the coefficients A1A2 and substitute t=2 into the solution. However, this involves solving an infinite series, which is not possible to do analytically. Instead, we can use numerical methods or software to approximate the solution."
