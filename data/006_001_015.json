    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 100 heads in 200 flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (flips), which is 200 in this case\n- k is the number of successful outcomes (heads), which is 100 in this case\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (getting tails) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nSo, plugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 100) = (200C100) * (0.5^100) * (0.5^100)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate 200C100:\n\n200! / (100! * 100!) = 7843782015109251800\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 100) = 7843782015109251800 * (0.5^100) * (0.5^100) â‰ˆ 0.0104\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 100 heads in 200 flips of a fair coin is approximately 1.04%."
