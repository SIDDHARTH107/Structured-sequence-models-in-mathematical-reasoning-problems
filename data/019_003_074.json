    "message_2": "To find the number of possible models in which the formula p → (q ∧ r) is true, we need to consider all possible combinations of truth values for the propositional variables p, q, and r. Since each variable can be either true (T) or false (F), there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations:\n\n1. p = T, q = T, r = T\n2. p = T, q = T, r = F\n3. p = T, q = F, r = T\n4. p = T, q = F, r = F\n5. p = F, q = T, r = T\n6. p = F, q = T, r = F\n7. p = F, q = F, r = T\n8. p = F, q = F, r = F\n\nNow, let's evaluate the formula p → (q ∧ r) for each combination:\n\n1. T → (T ∧ T) = T\n2. T → (T ∧ F) = F\n3. T → (F ∧ T) = F\n4. T → (F ∧ F) = F\n5. F → (T ∧ T) = T\n6. F → (T ∧ F) = T\n7. F → (F ∧ T) = T\n8. F → (F ∧ F) = T\n\nThe formula p → (q ∧ r) is true for combinations 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Therefore, there are 5 possible models in which the formula p → (q ∧ r) is true."
