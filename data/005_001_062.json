    "message_1": "Suppose the average weight of 5th-grade students in a school is 80 pounds with a standard deviation of 10 pounds. If a random sample of 20 students from the school has an average weight of 85 pounds, can we conclude that the average weight of students in the school is now higher? Assume a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if we can conclude that the average weight of students in the school is now higher, we will perform a hypothesis test using the given information. \n\nStep 1: State the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1)\nH0: The average weight of students in the school is still 80 pounds (µ = 80)\nH1: The average weight of students in the school is higher than 80 pounds (µ > 80)\n\nStep 2: Determine the test statistic\nWe will use the t-test statistic since we are given the sample mean, population mean, standard deviation, and sample size. The formula for the t-test statistic is:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nt = (85 - 80) / (10 / sqrt(20))\nt = 5 / (10 / sqrt(20))\nt = 5 / (10 / 4.472)\nt = 5 / 2.236\nt ≈ 2.236\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value\nWe are given a significance level of 0.05, and since this is a one-tailed test (we are only interested in whether the average weight is higher), we will use a t-distribution table to find the critical value for a one-tailed test with 19 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1 = 20 - 1 = 19).\n\nLooking up the critical value in a t-distribution table, we find that the critical value for a one-tailed test with 19 degrees of freedom and a significance level of 0.05 is approximately 1.729.\n\nStep 4: Compare the test statistic to the critical value\nOur test statistic (t ≈ 2.236) is greater than the critical value (1.729). \n\nStep 5: Make a decision\nSince the test statistic is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis (H0) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H1). Therefore, we can conclude that there is evidence to suggest that the average weight of students in the school is now higher than 80 pounds at a significance level of 0.05."
