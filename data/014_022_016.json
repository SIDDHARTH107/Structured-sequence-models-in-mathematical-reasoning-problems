    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the Playfair cipher, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Break the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them. If the plaintext has an odd number of characters, add an 'X' at the end.\n   In this case, the plaintext is \"HELLO\", so the digraphs are \"HE\", \"LX\", and \"LO\".\n\n2. For each digraph, apply the following rules:\n   a) If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the letter to its right (wrapping around to the beginning of the row if necessary).\n   b) If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the letter below it (wrapping around to the top of the column if necessary).\n   c) If the letters form a rectangle in the matrix, replace each letter with the letter in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to our digraphs:\n\n- \"HE\": H is in row 2 and column 4, E is in row 2 and column 2. They are in the same row, so we replace each letter with the letter to its right. The new digraph is \"RI\".\n- \"LX\": L is in row 4 and column 2, X is in row 5 and column 3. They form a rectangle, so we replace each letter with the letter in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle. The new digraph is \"GM\".\n- \"LO\": L is in row 4 and column 2, O is in row 1 and column 5. They form a rectangle, so we replace each letter with the letter in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle. The new digraph is \"GS\".\n\nSo, the ciphertext for \"HELLO\" using the given Playfair cipher key matrix is \"RIGMGS\"."
