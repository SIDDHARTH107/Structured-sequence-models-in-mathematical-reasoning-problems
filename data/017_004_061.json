    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 49. Since 49 = 7^2, by the Sylow Theorems, there exists a Sylow 7-subgroup of G, say H. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups of G is equal to 1 mod 7 and divides 49, so there are either 1 or 7 Sylow 7-subgroups. \n\nCase 1: There is only one Sylow 7-subgroup.\nIn this case, H is the unique Sylow 7-subgroup, and thus it is normal in G. Since |H| = 7, H is a cyclic group generated by some element a with order 7. Now, G/H is a group of order 7, so it is also cyclic, generated by some coset bH with order 7. Then G is generated by a and b, and since H is normal in G, we have that G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and G/H, both of which are cyclic groups of order 7. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7.\n\nCase 2: There are 7 Sylow 7-subgroups.\nLet H and K be two distinct Sylow 7-subgroups of G. Since |H| = |K| = 7, both H and K are cyclic, generated by elements a and b, respectively, with order 7. The intersection of H and K is trivial, as their intersection would be a subgroup of both H and K, and since H and K are distinct and have prime order, their intersection must be the identity element. Thus, |HK| = |H||K|/|H ∩ K| = 7 * 7 / 1 = 49. Since |G| = 49, we have that G = HK. \n\nNow, we show that G is abelian. Let h ∈ H and k ∈ K. Since H and K are distinct Sylow 7-subgroups, hk ≠ kh implies that hk and kh are in different Sylow 7-subgroups. However, both hk and kh are in HK = G, and since there are only 7 Sylow 7-subgroups, one of them must be in H or K. Without loss of generality, assume hk ∈ H. Then kh = (hk)^(-1) ∈ H as well, which contradicts our assumption that hk ≠ kh. Therefore, hk = kh for all h ∈ H and k ∈ K, and G is abelian.\n\nSince G is abelian and generated by a and b, both of order 7, G is isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups generated by a and b, which are both of order 7. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 49 is either cyclic (in the case where there is only one Sylow 7-subgroup) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7 (in the case where there are 7 Sylow 7-subgroups)."
