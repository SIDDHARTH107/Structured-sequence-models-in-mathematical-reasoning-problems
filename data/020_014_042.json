    "message_1": "A manufacturing firm produces two products, A and B, using two machines, X and Y. Product A requires 3 hours on machine X and 2 hours on machine Y, while product B requires 1 hour on machine X and 4 hours on machine Y. The company has 240 hours of machine X time and 200 hours of machine Y time available per week. If the profit per unit of A is $50 and for B is $60, how many units of each product should the company produce in a week to maximize their profit? Note: This is a non-convex optimization problem because of the discrete nature of units that can be produced.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for machine hours are:\n3x + y <= 240 (Machine X)\n2x + 4y <= 200 (Machine Y)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 50x + 60y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n1. 3x + y <= 240\ny <= -3x + 240\n\n2. 2x + 4y <= 200\ny <= -0.5x + 50\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the constraints:\n\n1. Intersection of constraint 1 and constraint 2:\ny = -3x + 240\ny = -0.5x + 50\n\nSolving for x and y:\n-3x + 240 = -0.5x + 50\n2.5x = 190\nx = 76\n\ny = -3(76) + 240\ny = 12\n\nVertex 1: (76, 12)\n\n2. Intersection of constraint 1 and y-axis (x = 0):\ny = -3x + 240\ny = -3(0) + 240\ny = 240\n\nVertex 2: (0, 240)\n\n3. Intersection of constraint 2 and x-axis (y = 0):\ny = -0.5x + 50\n0 = -0.5x + 50\nx = 100\n\nVertex 3: (100, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(76, 12) = 50(76) + 60(12) = 3800 + 720 = 4520\n2. P(0, 240) = 50(0) + 60(240) = 0 + 14400 = 14400\n3. P(100, 0) = 50(100) + 60(0) = 5000 + 0 = 5000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex 2, where the company produces 0 units of product A and 240 units of product B. The maximum profit is $14,400 per week."
