    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 6 cm. What is the total surface area of the prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length × width.\n\nThere are three pairs of faces on a rectangular prism:\n\n1. Two faces with dimensions 8 cm (length) × 4 cm (width)\n2. Two faces with dimensions 8 cm (length) × 6 cm (height)\n3. Two faces with dimensions 4 cm (width) × 6 cm (height)\n\nNow, let's find the area of each pair of faces:\n\n1. Area of two faces with dimensions 8 cm × 4 cm: 2 × (8 × 4) = 2 × 32 = 64 cm²\n2. Area of two faces with dimensions 8 cm × 6 cm: 2 × (8 × 6) = 2 × 48 = 96 cm²\n3. Area of two faces with dimensions 4 cm × 6 cm: 2 × (4 × 6) = 2 × 24 = 48 cm²\n\nNow, add the areas of all the pairs of faces together:\n\nTotal surface area = 64 cm² + 96 cm² + 48 cm² = 208 cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 208 cm²."
