    "message_2": "To determine the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x on the interval [-1, 1], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n, b_n, and a_0. The Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L))\n\nFor the given function f(x) = x and interval [-1, 1], the period is L = 1. The Fourier coefficients are calculated as follows:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nFirst, let's calculate a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/1) * ∫[-1, 1] x dx = (x^2/2)|[-1, 1] = (1/2 - (-1/2)) = 0\n\nNow, let's calculate a_n:\n\na_n = (1/1) * ∫[-1, 1] x * cos(nπx) dx\n\nSince f(x) = x is an odd function and cos(nπx) is an even function, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's calculate b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/1) * ∫[-1, 1] x * sin(nπx) dx\n\nUsing integration by parts, let u = x and dv = sin(nπx) dx. Then, du = dx and v = (-1/nπ) * cos(nπx).\n\nb_n = uv|[-1, 1] - ∫[-1, 1] v du\nb_n = (-x/(nπ)) * cos(nπx)|[-1, 1] - ∫[-1, 1] (-1/nπ) * cos(nπx) dx\nb_n = (1/(nπ)) * (cos(nπ) - cos(-nπ)) - (1/nπ) * ∫[-1, 1] cos(nπx) dx\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and cos(-nπ) = (-1)^n, their sum is zero:\n\nb_n = 0 - (1/nπ) * ∫[-1, 1] cos(nπx) dx\n\nNow, integrating cos(nπx) with respect to x:\n\nb_n = (1/nπ) * (sin(nπx)/(nπ))|[-1, 1]\nb_n = (1/nπ) * (sin(nπ) - sin(-nπ))\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n:\n\nb_n = (1/nπ) * (0 - 0) = 0\n\nThus, all Fourier coefficients are zero, and the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x on the interval [-1, 1] is identically zero. This is because the Fourier series converges to the function f(x) = x only at points of continuity, and f(x) = x is not continuous at the endpoints of the interval [-1, 1]."
