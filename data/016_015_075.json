    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that increases in length as the order increases. The length of the Hilbert curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (2^n - 1) * sqrt(2)\n\nFor an order-5 Hilbert curve, we have n = 5. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = (2^5 - 1) * sqrt(2)\nLength = (32 - 1) * sqrt(2)\nLength = 31 * sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the length of the order-5 Hilbert curve is 31 * sqrt(2) units."
