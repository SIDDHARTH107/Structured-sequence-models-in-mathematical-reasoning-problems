    "message_2": "To choose three distinct numbers from the first ten positive integers, we can use the combination formula, which is represented in Pascal's Triangle. In this case, we are choosing 3 numbers (r) from a set of 10 numbers (n). The combination formula is:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere C(n, r) represents the number of combinations, n! is the factorial of n, and r! is the factorial of r.\n\nUsing the combination formula, we can find the number of ways to choose three distinct numbers from the first ten positive integers:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\n= 10! / (3!7!)\n= (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n= (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n= 720 / 6\n= 120\n\nSo, there are 120 ways to choose three distinct numbers from the first ten positive integers using Pascal's Triangle."
