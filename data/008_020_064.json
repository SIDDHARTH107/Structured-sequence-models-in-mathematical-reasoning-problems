    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix notation, we first represent the system as a matrix equation AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nIn this case, the matrix equation is:\n\n| 3  2 | | x |   |  8 |\n| 5  4 | | y | = | 15 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of matrix A and multiply both sides of the equation by the inverse to solve for X.\n\nMatrix A:\n| 3  2 |\n| 5  4 |\n\nTo find the inverse of matrix A, we first find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = (3 * 4) - (2 * 5) = 12 - 10 = 2\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of matrix A exists. Now, we can find the inverse using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere adj(A) is the adjugate of matrix A. To find the adjugate, we swap the diagonal elements and change the sign of the off-diagonal elements:\n\nadj(A) = |  4  -2 |\n         | -5   3 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/2) * |  4  -2 |\n                | -5   3 |\n\nA^(-1) = |  2  -1 |\n         | -5/2  3/2 |\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the matrix equation by the inverse of A to solve for X:\n\nA^(-1) * AX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  2  -1 | |  8 |\n    | -5/2  3/2 | | 15 |\n\nTo perform the matrix multiplication:\n\nx = (2 * 8) + (-1 * 15) = 16 - 15 = 1\ny = (-5/2 * 8) + (3/2 * 15) = -20 + 22.5 = 2.5\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is x = 1 and y = 2.5."
