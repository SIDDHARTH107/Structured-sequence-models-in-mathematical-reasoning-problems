    "message_2": "To prove that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Since the order of G is 35, we have n_5 divides 35 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibility for n_5 is 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. We have n_7 divides 35 and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7). The only possibility for n_7 is also 1.\n\nLet P be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G and Q be the unique Sylow 7-subgroup of G. Since both P and Q are unique, they are both normal subgroups of G (by the Sylow theorems). The orders of P and Q are 5 and 7, respectively, which are both prime numbers. Therefore, P and Q are both cyclic groups.\n\nNow, we will show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q. Since P and Q are normal subgroups of G, their intersection, P ∩ Q, is also a normal subgroup of G. However, the only common element of P and Q is the identity element, as their orders are coprime. Thus, P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNext, consider the product PQ = {pq | p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. Since the orders of P and Q are coprime, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 5 * 7 = 35, which is the order of G. Therefore, G = PQ.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1) G is cyclic: In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 35, and we are done.\n\n2) G is not cyclic: In this case, since G = PQ and P ∩ Q = {e}, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q by the internal direct product theorem. Since P and Q are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nThus, we have shown that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
