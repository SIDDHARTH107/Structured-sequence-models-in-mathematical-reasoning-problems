    "message_1": "The question for the math student to solve is:\n\nIn a certain region, the probability of a hurricane occurring in a given year is 0.05, and the probability of a wildfire occurring in the same year is 0.03. What is the probability of either a hurricane or a wildfire occurring in a given year in that region?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of either a hurricane or a wildfire occurring in a given year, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A is the event of a hurricane occurring, B is the event of a wildfire occurring, and A ∩ B is the event of both a hurricane and a wildfire occurring in the same year.\n\nWe are given P(A) = 0.05 and P(B) = 0.03. However, we don't have the information about the probability of both events happening in the same year, P(A ∩ B). If we assume that the events are independent (meaning the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other), then we can calculate P(A ∩ B) as:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.05 * 0.03 = 0.0015\n\nNow, we can find the probability of either event occurring:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.05 + 0.03 - 0.0015 = 0.0785\n\nSo, the probability of either a hurricane or a wildfire occurring in a given year in that region is 0.0785 or 7.85%."
