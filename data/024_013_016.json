    "message_2": "To find the volume form associated with the metric $g = dx^2 + 4 dy^2 + 9 dz^2$, we first need to find the determinant of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$. The metric tensor is a matrix representation of the metric, and in this case, it is a diagonal matrix:\n\n$$\ng_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 9\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we find the determinant of this matrix:\n\n$$\n\\det(g_{ij}) = 1(4 \\cdot 9 - 0 \\cdot 0) - 0(0 \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot 9) + 0(0 \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot 4) = 36\n$$\n\nThe volume form $\\Omega$ is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times the standard volume form in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which is $dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$:\n\n$$\n\\Omega = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = \\sqrt{36} \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = 6 \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the volume form at the point $p = (1, 2, 3)$. Since the volume form does not depend on the coordinates, its value is the same at any point in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, the volume form $\\Omega$ at point $p = (1, 2, 3)$ is:\n\n$$\n\\Omega(p) = 6 \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$"
