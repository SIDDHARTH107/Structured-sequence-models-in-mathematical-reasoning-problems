    "message_1": "Consider a situation where you have to form a committee of 5 students from a class of 10 students. How many different committees can be formed if you have to select the committee members from 3 boys and 7 girls?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students, k is the number of students to be selected, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, we need to form a committee of 5 students (k=5) from a class of 10 students (n=10), which consists of 3 boys and 7 girls.\n\nWe can break this problem down into two cases:\n\n1. Selecting 2 boys and 3 girls.\n2. Selecting 1 boy and 4 girls.\n\nCase 1: Selecting 2 boys and 3 girls\nTo select 2 boys from 3 boys, we use the combination formula:\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = 3! / (2!1!) = (3*2*1) / ((2*1)*(1)) = 3\n\nTo select 3 girls from 7 girls, we use the combination formula:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) = 7! / (3!4!) = (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(4*3*2*1)) = 35\n\nNow, we multiply the combinations of boys and girls to get the total combinations for case 1:\n\nTotal combinations for case 1 = C(3, 2) * C(7, 3) = 3 * 35 = 105\n\nCase 2: Selecting 1 boy and 4 girls\nTo select 1 boy from 3 boys, we use the combination formula:\n\nC(3, 1) = 3! / (1!(3-1)!) = 3! / (1!2!) = (3*2*1) / ((1)*(2*1)) = 3\n\nTo select 4 girls from 7 girls, we use the combination formula:\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4!(7-4)!) = 7! / (4!3!) = (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((4*3*2*1)*(3*2*1)) = 35\n\nNow, we multiply the combinations of boys and girls to get the total combinations for case 2:\n\nTotal combinations for case 2 = C(3, 1) * C(7, 4) = 3 * 35 = 105\n\nFinally, we add the total combinations for both cases to get the overall total combinations:\n\nTotal combinations = Total combinations for case 1 + Total combinations for case 2 = 105 + 105 = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 different committees that can be formed from 3 boys and 7 girls."
