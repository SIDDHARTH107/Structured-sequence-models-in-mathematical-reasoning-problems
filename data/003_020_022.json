    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on a hill. From a point on the hill which is 20 meters away from the flagpole, the angle of elevation to the top of the pole is 50 degrees. Find the height of the flagpole.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 50 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the point to the flagpole (20 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the flagpole (which we want to find).\n\nLet h be the height of the flagpole. We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(50°) = h / 20\n\nTo solve for h, multiply both sides of the equation by 20:\n\nh = 20 * tan(50°)\n\nNow, use a calculator to find the tangent of 50 degrees:\n\ntan(50°) ≈ 1.1918\n\nMultiply this value by 20:\n\nh ≈ 20 * 1.1918\nh ≈ 23.836\n\nTherefore, the height of the flagpole is approximately 23.836 meters."
