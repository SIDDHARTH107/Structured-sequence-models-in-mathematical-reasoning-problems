    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Prisoner's Dilemma:\n\nTwo prisoners, Adam and Bob, are individually given a chance to betray their partner or stay silent. If both stay silent, they each serve one year in prison. If one betrays the other, the betrayer goes free while the other serves three years in prison. If both betray each other, they each serve two years in prison. Assume that the game is played only once and Adam moves first, while Bob moves second. What should Adam do if he wants to minimize his time in prison, and what should Bob do if he wants to do the same?",
    "message_2": "To minimize their time in prison, both Adam and Bob should analyze the possible outcomes based on their decisions. Let's consider the following options:\n\n1. Adam stays silent (S) and Bob stays silent (S): Both serve 1 year in prison.\n2. Adam stays silent (S) and Bob betrays (B): Adam serves 3 years, Bob goes free.\n3. Adam betrays (B) and Bob stays silent (S): Adam goes free, Bob serves 3 years.\n4. Adam betrays (B) and Bob betrays (B): Both serve 2 years in prison.\n\nSince Adam moves first, he should consider the possible responses from Bob. If Adam stays silent, Bob can either stay silent and serve 1 year or betray and go free. Bob would choose to betray in this case, as it minimizes his time in prison. If Adam betrays, Bob can either stay silent and serve 3 years or betray and serve 2 years. In this case, Bob would choose to betray, as it minimizes his time in prison.\n\nKnowing that Bob will betray in either case, Adam should choose to betray as well. This way, both Adam and Bob betray each other, and they each serve 2 years in prison. This is the best outcome for both of them, given that they want to minimize their time in prison."
