    "message_1": "Sure, here's a math problem for a student to solve:\n\nOn a coordinate plane, graph the equation y = 2x + 3. Then, find the solution for y when x is equal to 5.",
    "message_2": "To graph the equation y = 2x + 3, we can start by finding the y-intercept and the slope.\n\nThe y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, which occurs when x = 0. Plugging x = 0 into the equation, we get:\n\ny = 2(0) + 3\ny = 3\n\nSo, the y-intercept is at the point (0, 3).\n\nThe slope of the line is the coefficient of x, which is 2 in this case. This means that for every 1 unit increase in x, y increases by 2 units. Starting from the y-intercept (0, 3), we can find another point on the line by moving 1 unit to the right (increasing x by 1) and 2 units up (increasing y by 2). This gives us the point (1, 5).\n\nNow that we have two points, (0, 3) and (1, 5), we can graph the line.\n\nTo find the solution for y when x is equal to 5, we can plug x = 5 into the equation:\n\ny = 2(5) + 3\ny = 10 + 3\ny = 13\n\nSo, when x = 5, y = 13. The point (5, 13) is on the line."
