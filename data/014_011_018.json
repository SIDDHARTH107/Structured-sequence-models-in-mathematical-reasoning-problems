    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using a transposition cipher with a block size of 4, we first divide the message into blocks of 4 characters each:\n\n1. HELL\n2. O WO\n3. RLD\n\nNow, we rearrange the letters within each block:\n\n1. EHL\n2. OOW\n3. DLR\n\nThe encrypted message is \"EHLOOWDLR\"."
