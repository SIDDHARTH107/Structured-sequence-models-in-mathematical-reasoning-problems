    "message_1": "Consider the elliptic curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 5x + 7$ and the line given by the equation $y = 2x + 1$. Let $P = (2,5)$ be a point on the elliptic curve. Find the coordinates of the point $Q$ on the line passing through $P$ that intersects the elliptic curve at $P$ and one other point.",
    "message_2": "To find the point Q, we first need to find the equation of the tangent line to the elliptic curve at point P. To do this, we will find the derivative of the elliptic curve with respect to x and then find the slope of the tangent line at P.\n\nThe equation of the elliptic curve is given by:\n$y^2 = x^3 - 5x + 7$\n\nImplicitly differentiate both sides with respect to x:\n$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 - 5$\n\nNow, we can find the slope of the tangent line at point P by plugging in the coordinates of P into the equation above:\n$2(5) \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3(2)^2 - 5$\n$10 \\frac{dy}{dx} = 12 - 5$\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{7}{10}$\n\nNow that we have the slope of the tangent line at P, we can find the equation of the tangent line using the point-slope form:\n$y - 5 = \\frac{7}{10}(x - 2)$\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of the tangent line and the elliptic curve. To do this, we will substitute the equation of the tangent line into the equation of the elliptic curve:\n$(2x + 1 - 5)^2 = x^3 - 5x + 7$\n$(2x - 4)^2 = x^3 - 5x + 7$\n\nExpand and simplify the equation:\n$4x^2 - 16x + 16 = x^3 - 5x + 7$\n\nRearrange the equation to find the intersection points:\n$x^3 - 4x^2 + 11x - 9 = 0$\n\nSince we know that P is an intersection point, we can factor out (x - 2) from the equation:\n$(x - 2)(x^2 - 2x + 3) = 0$\n\nWe already know the point P, so we need to find the other intersection point by solving the quadratic equation:\n$x^2 - 2x + 3 = 0$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n$x = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(3)}}{2(1)}$\n$x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 12}}{2}$\n$x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{-8}}{2}$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for x. This means that the tangent line intersects the elliptic curve only at point P, and there is no point Q on the line passing through P that intersects the elliptic curve at P and one other point."
