    "message_2": "The union of A and its complement (denoted as A') is the entire universal set U, since every element in U is either in A or in A'. Since A has 50 elements and its complement A' has 70 elements, the cardinality of the union of A and its complement (i.e., the cardinality of U) is 50 + 70 = 120."
