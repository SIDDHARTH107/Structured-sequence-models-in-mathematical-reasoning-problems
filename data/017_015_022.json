C3 × C2 × C2 × C2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and three cyclic groups of order 2.\n7. S4: The symmetric group on 4 elements.\n8. A4 × C2: The direct product of the alternating group on 4 elements and a cyclic group of order 2.\n9. SL(2,3): The special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field with 3 elements.\n10. D12: The dihedral group of order 12.\n11. Q24: The generalized quaternion group of order 24.\n12. D6 × C2: The direct product of the dihedral group of order 6 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n13. Q8 × C3: The direct product of the quaternion group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 3.\n14. D4 × C3: The direct product of the dihedral group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 3.\n15. D3 × C4: The direct product of the dihedral group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 4.\n\nNow, let's determine which of them are isomorphic to the cyclic group C24, the alternating group A5, or one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24 stated in the subtopic.\n\n- C24 is isomorphic to itself.\n- None of the groups of order 24 are isomorphic to A5 since A5 has order 60.\n- The five non-abelian groups of order 24 are S4, SL(2,3), D12, Q24, and D6 × C2.\n\nSo, out of the 15 non-isomorphic groups of order 24, one is isomorphic to C24, none are isomorphic to A5, and five are isomorphic to the non-abelian groups of order 24 stated in the subtopic."
