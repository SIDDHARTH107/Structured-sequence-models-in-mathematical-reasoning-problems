They collect data from 10 students and obtain the following results:\n\n| Hours Studied (x) | Exam Score (y) |\n|---|---|\n| 4 | 75 |\n| 5 | 89 |\n| 2 | 60 |\n| 6 | 94 |\n| 3 | 72 |\n| 7 | 98 |\n| 1 | 55 |\n| 8 | 97 |\n| 9 | 100 |\n| 10 | 95 |\n\nUsing correlation analysis, determine the correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied and the exam score. Then, interpret the correlation coefficient in terms of the strength and direction of the relationship between the two variables.",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r) between the number of hours studied and the exam score, we will first need to calculate the mean of x (hours studied) and y (exam score), the standard deviations of x and y, and the covariance between x and y.\n\nMean of x (hours studied):\n(4 + 5 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 7 + 1 + 8 + 9 + 10) / 10 = 55 / 10 = 5.5\n\nMean of y (exam score):\n(75 + 89 + 60 + 94 + 72 + 98 + 55 + 97 + 100 + 95) / 10 = 835 / 10 = 83.5\n\nNow, we will calculate the deviations from the mean for each data point:\n\n| x | y | x - mean(x) | y - mean(y) | (x - mean(x)) * (y - mean(y)) |\n|---|---|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| 4 | 75 | -1.5        | -8.5        | 12.75                         |\n| 5 | 89 | -0.5        | 5.5         | -2.75                         |\n| 2 | 60 | -3.5        | -23.5       | 82.25                         |\n| 6 | 94 | 0.5         | 10.5        | 5.25                          |\n| 3 | 72 | -2.5        | -11.5       | 28.75                         |\n| 7 | 98 | 1.5         | 14.5        | 21.75                         |\n| 1 | 55 | -4.5        | -28.5       | 128.25                        |\n| 8 | 97 | 2.5         | 13.5        | 33.75                         |\n| 9 | 100| 3.5         | 16.5        | 57.75                         |\n| 10| 95 | 4.5         | 11.5        | 51.75                         |\n\nNow, we will calculate the covariance between x and y:\n\nCov(x, y) = Σ((x - mean(x)) * (y - mean(y))) / (n - 1)\nCov(x, y) = (12.75 - 2.75 + 82.25 + 5.25 + 28.75 + 21.75 + 128.25 + 33.75 + 57.75 + 51.75) / 9\nCov(x, y) = 420 / 9 = 46.67\n\nNext, we will calculate the standard deviations of x and y:\n\nSD(x) = sqrt(Σ(x - mean(x))^2 / (n - 1))\nSD(x) = sqrt((-1.5^2 + -0.5^2 + -3.5^2 + 0.5^2 + -2.5^2 + 1.5^2 + -4.5^2 + 2.5^2 + 3.5^2 + 4.5^2) / 9)\nSD(x) = sqrt(60.5) ≈ 7.78\n\nSD(y) = sqrt(Σ(y - mean(y))^2 / (n - 1))\nSD(y) = sqrt((-8.5^2 + 5.5^2 + -23.5^2 + 10.5^2 + -11.5^2 + 14.5^2 + -28.5^2 + 13.5^2 + 16.5^2 + 11.5^2) / 9)\nSD(y) = sqrt(2037.5) ≈ 45.14\n\nFinally, we can calculate the correlation coefficient (r):\n\nr = Cov(x, y) / (SD(x) * SD(y))\nr = 46.67 / (7.78 * 45.14)\nr ≈ 0.145 / 1.00\nr ≈ 0.145\n\nThe correlation coefficient (r) is approximately 0.145, which indicates a weak positive relationship between the number of hours studied and the exam score. This means that as the number of hours studied increases, the exam score tends to increase, but the relationship is not very strong."
