    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the box be length (l), width (w), and height (h). The surface area (SA) and volume (V) of the box can be represented by the following equations:\n\nSA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 144\nV = lwh\n\nWe want to maximize the volume V, so we need to find the dimensions l, w, and h that satisfy the surface area equation and result in the maximum volume.\n\nFirst, we can solve the surface area equation for one of the variables, say h:\n\nh = (144 - 2lw) / (2w + 2l)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the volume equation:\n\nV = lw((144 - 2lw) / (2w + 2l))\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we can use the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality), which states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean:\n\nAM = (l + w + h) / 3 ≥ (lwh)^(1/3)\n\nSince the surface area is fixed, the sum (l + w + h) is also fixed. Therefore, to maximize the volume (lwh), we need to make the dimensions as equal as possible. In other words, the maximum volume will be achieved when the box is a cube (l = w = h).\n\nNow, let's find the dimensions of the cube. Since l = w = h, the surface area equation becomes:\n\n144 = 2l^2 + 2l^2 + 2l^2\n144 = 6l^2\nl^2 = 24\nl = √24\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that will achieve the maximum volume are:\n\nl = w = h = √24 ≈ 4.90 inches"
