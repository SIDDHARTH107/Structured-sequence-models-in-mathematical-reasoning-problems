    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k people affected by the disease\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the total number of people in the sample (100 in this case)\n- k is the number of people affected by the disease (we want at least 10)\n- p is the prevalence rate of the disease (0.05 or 5%)\n- (1-p) is the probability of not being affected by the disease (0.95 or 95%)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 10 people being affected, we need to find the sum of probabilities from k = 10 to k = 100:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 9\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for k = 0 to 9 and sum them up:\n\nΣ P(X = k) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9)\n\nAfter calculating the sum, subtract it from 1 to get the probability of at least 10 people being affected:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - Σ P(X = k)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the probabilities and sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) ≈ 0.9648\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 people out of a random sample of 100 from the demographic group will be affected by the disease with a prevalence rate of 5% is approximately 96.48%."
