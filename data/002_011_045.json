    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 10 cm and one leg of length 6 cm. What is the length of the other leg, rounded to the nearest tenth of a centimeter?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, we have:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nWe are given the length of the hypotenuse (c = 10 cm) and one leg (a = 6 cm). We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\n10^2 = 6^2 + b^2\n100 = 36 + b^2\n64 = b^2\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides:\n\nb = âˆš64\nb = 8\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 8 cm."
