    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone-shaped container, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 6 cm and the height (h) is 12 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * (6 cm)² * (12 cm)\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 36 cm² * 12 cm\n\nVolume = 3.14159 * 12 cm³\n\nVolume ≈ 452.389 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the cone-shaped container is approximately 452.389 cubic centimeters (cm³)."
