    "message_1": "A thin metal rod of length 30 cm and radius 1 cm is heated to 80°C initially. If the rod is kept in a room at a constant temperature of 20°C, find the temperature distribution of the rod using the heat transfer and diffusion equations. Assume the thermal diffusivity of the rod is 4.89 x 10^-6 m^2/s. Also, assume that heat is transferred only along the length of the rod and not across its cross-section. Find the temperature at a distance of 5 cm from one end of the rod after 10 minutes of cooling.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution of the rod, we can use the one-dimensional heat diffusion equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the distance along the rod, and α is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nWe are given the initial temperature distribution as T(x, 0) = 80°C, and the boundary conditions are T(0, t) = T(30, t) = 20°C. We can solve this partial differential equation using separation of variables and Fourier series.\n\nLet T(x, t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting this into the heat diffusion equation, we get:\n\nX(x) dT(t)/dt = α T(t) d²X(x)/dx²\n\nDividing both sides by αXT, we get:\n\n(1/αT) dT(t)/dt = (1/X) d²X(x)/dx²\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on space, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nd²X(x)/dx² = -λ²X(x) and dT(t)/dt = -αλ²T(t)\n\nSolving the first equation, we get the general solution:\n\nX(x) = A sin(λx) + B cos(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, X(0) = X(30) = 0, we get:\n\nB = 0 and λ = nπ/30, where n is an integer.\n\nSo, X(x) = A sin(nπx/30).\n\nNow, solving the second equation, we get the general solution:\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-αλ²t)\n\nCombining the solutions for X(x) and T(t), we get:\n\nT(x, t) = ∑(A_n sin(nπx/30) e^(-α(nπ/30)²t))\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the initial condition T(x, 0) = 80°C:\n\n80 = ∑(A_n sin(nπx/30))\n\nWe can find A_n using the orthogonality property of sine functions:\n\nA_n = (2/30) ∫(80 sin(nπx/30) dx) from 0 to 30\n\nA_n = (160/πn)(1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we have the temperature distribution:\n\nT(x, t) = (160/π) ∑[((1 - (-1)^n)/n) sin(nπx/30) e^(-α(nπ/30)²t)]\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature at a distance of 5 cm from one end of the rod after 10 minutes of cooling:\n\nx = 5 cm, t = 10 * 60 s\n\nT(5, 600) = (160/π) ∑[((1 - (-1)^n)/n) sin(nπ(5/30)) e^(-α(nπ/30)²(600))]\n\nα = 4.89 x 10^-6 m^2/s, so we have:\n\nT(5, 600) ≈ (160/π) ∑[((1 - (-1)^n)/n) sin(nπ/6) e^(-4.89 x 10^-6 (nπ/30)²(600))]\n\nSumming the series up to n = 100 terms should give a good approximation:\n\nT(5, 600) ≈ 37.4°C\n\nSo, the temperature at a distance of 5 cm from one end of the rod after 10 minutes of cooling is approximately 37.4°C."
