    "message_2": "An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices are adjacent. To find the maximum independent set, we need to select the maximum number of vertices such that no two vertices are connected by an edge.\n\nIn the given graph, we can choose the following vertices to form the maximum independent set: {1, 4, 5, 7}. No two of these vertices are connected by an edge, and it is not possible to add any more vertices to this set without violating the independence condition.\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set is 4."
