    "message_2": "To find the values of sine, cosine, and tangent for an angle of 60 degrees, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio of 1:√3:2, where the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 1, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is √3, and the hypotenuse is 2.\n\nFor an angle of 60 degrees:\n\n1. Sine (sin) is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. So, sin(60) = (√3)/2.\n\n2. Cosine (cos) is the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. So, cos(60) = 1/2.\n\n3. Tangent (tan) is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. So, tan(60) = (√3)/1 = √3.\n\nTherefore, the values of sine, cosine, and tangent for an angle of 60 degrees are:\n\nsin(60) = (√3)/2\ncos(60) = 1/2\ntan(60) = √3"
