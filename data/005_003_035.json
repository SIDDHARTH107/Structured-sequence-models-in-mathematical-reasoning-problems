    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line that best fits the data, we will use the least squares method to find the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) of the line y = mx + b.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of the ages (x) and the mean of the salaries (y):\n\nMean of ages (x̄) = (25 + 27 + 30 + 32 + 35 + 38 + 40 + 44 + 47 + 50) / 10 = 368 / 10 = 36.8\nMean of salaries (ȳ) = (35 + 40 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 60 + 70 + 75 + 80 + 85) / 10 = 595 / 10 = 59.5\n\nNext, we will calculate the slope (m):\n\nm = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2\n\nFor each data point, we will calculate (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) and (xi - x̄)^2:\n\n(25 - 36.8)(35 - 59.5) = -11.8 * -24.5 = 289.1\n(27 - 36.8)(40 - 59.5) = -9.8 * -19.5 = 191.1\n(30 - 36.8)(45 - 59.5) = -6.8 * -14.5 = 98.6\n(32 - 36.8)(50 - 59.5) = -4.8 * -9.5 = 45.6\n(35 - 36.8)(55 - 59.5) = -1.8 * -4.5 = 8.1\n(38 - 36.8)(60 - 59.5) = 1.2 * 0.5 = 0.6\n(40 - 36.8)(70 - 59.5) = 3.2 * 10.5 = 33.6\n(44 - 36.8)(75 - 59.5) = 7.2 * 15.5 = 111.6\n(47 - 36.8)(80 - 59.5) = 10.2 * 20.5 = 209.1\n(50 - 36.8)(85 - 59.5) = 13.2 * 25.5 = 336.6\n\nNow, sum the results:\n\nΣ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] = 289.1 + 191.1 + 98.6 + 45.6 + 8.1 + 0.6 + 33.6 + 111.6 + 209.1 + 336.6 = 1324\nΣ(xi - x̄)^2 = 139.24 + 96.04 + 46.24 + 23.04 + 3.24 + 1.44 + 10.24 + 51.84 + 104.04 + 174.24 = 699.6\n\nNow, we can calculate the slope (m):\n\nm = 1324 / 699.6 ≈ 1.893\n\nNext, we will calculate the y-intercept (b):\n\nb = ȳ - m * x̄ = 59.5 - 1.893 * 36.8 ≈ 59.5 - 69.65 ≈ -10.15\n\nNow we have the equation of the line:\n\ny = 1.893x - 10.15\n\nFinally, we can predict the salary for an employee who is 42 years old:\n\ny = 1.893 * 42 - 10.15 ≈ 79.51\n\nSo, the predicted salary for a 42-year-old employee is approximately $79,510."
