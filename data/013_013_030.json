    "message_1": "Consider an auction where three bidders are bidding for a painting. The painting is estimated to be worth $2,000. The bidders have valuations of $1,500, $1,800 and $2,200. What will be the outcome of this auction if it is conducted as a first-price sealed-bid auction?",
    "message_2": "In a first-price sealed-bid auction, each bidder submits a single bid in a sealed envelope, and the highest bidder wins the auction, paying the amount they bid.\n\nIn this scenario, the bidders have valuations of $1,500, $1,800, and $2,200. Each bidder wants to win the auction but also wants to pay as little as possible. They will likely bid slightly below their valuations to try to maximize their profit.\n\nAssuming each bidder bids below their valuation, the bids might look like this:\n\n- Bidder 1: $1,499\n- Bidder 2: $1,799\n- Bidder 3: $2,199\n\nIn this case, Bidder 3 would win the auction with a bid of $2,199, as it is the highest bid. The exact bids may vary, but the outcome will generally be the same: Bidder 3 will win the auction since their valuation is the highest."
