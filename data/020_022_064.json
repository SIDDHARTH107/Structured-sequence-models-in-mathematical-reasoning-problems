    "message_1": "A company has a budget of $10,000 to invest in two investment opportunities. The expected return of investment A is 8% per year and the expected return of investment B is 12% per year. However, the company can invest at most $6,000 in investment A due to regulatory restrictions. How much money should the company invest in each investment opportunity to maximize the total return on investment?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount invested in investment A and y be the amount invested in investment B. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y = $10,000 (total budget)\n2. x ≤ $6,000 (regulatory restriction on investment A)\n\nWe want to maximize the total return on investment, which can be represented by the following equation:\n\nTotal Return = 0.08x + 0.12y\n\nSince investment B has a higher expected return (12% vs 8%), the company should invest as much as possible in investment B while still meeting the constraints. \n\nFrom constraint 1, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = $10,000 - x\n\nNow, we need to consider constraint 2:\n\nx ≤ $6,000\n\nTo maximize the total return, the company should invest the maximum allowed amount in investment A, which is $6,000. Then, the remaining amount will be invested in investment B:\n\nx = $6,000\ny = $10,000 - $6,000 = $4,000\n\nNow, we can calculate the total return:\n\nTotal Return = 0.08($6,000) + 0.12($4,000) = $480 + $480 = $960\n\nSo, the company should invest $6,000 in investment A and $4,000 in investment B to maximize the total return on investment, which will be $960 per year."
