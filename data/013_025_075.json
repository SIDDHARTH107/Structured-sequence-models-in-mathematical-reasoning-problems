    "message_1": "Consider two travelers who have lost their luggage and are asked by the airline to declare the value of their lost items. They agree that the one with the lower declaration will be reimbursed by the airline, but the one with the higher declaration will receive nothing. Let's assume that the value of the lost items is an integer between 1 and 100.\n\nIf the two travelers use the strategy of the Traveler's Dilemma and are rational thinkers, what will be their optimal declaration for their lost items, and how much will they receive from the airline?",
    "message_2": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, both travelers are rational thinkers and want to maximize their own reimbursement. Let's denote the declarations of the two travelers as A and B.\n\nIf traveler A declares a value of 100, traveler B has two options: declare 100 or declare 99. If B declares 100, both will receive nothing. If B declares 99, B will receive 99. So, in this case, B will choose to declare 99.\n\nNow, if A declares 99, B has two options: declare 99 or declare 98. If B declares 99, both will receive nothing. If B declares 98, B will receive 98. So, B will choose to declare 98.\n\nThis pattern continues all the way down to the lowest possible declaration, which is 1. If A declares 1, B will also declare 1, and both will receive nothing.\n\nSince both travelers are rational thinkers, they will recognize this pattern and choose the optimal declaration, which is the lowest possible value, 1. Therefore, their optimal declaration for their lost items is 1, and they will receive nothing from the airline."
