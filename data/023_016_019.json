    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to determine if it's an even or odd function. Since f(x) is neither even nor odd, we will use the general Fourier series formula:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is the half-period of the function, a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nIn this case, the function has a period of 4 (from -2 to 2), so L = 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n.\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * 1]dx over the interval [-L, L]\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L)]dx over the interval [-L, L]\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)]dx over the interval [-L, L]\n\nLet's compute these coefficients:\n\na_0 = (1/2) * ∫[f(x)]dx from -2 to 2\nSince f(x) = 4 for 0 < x < 2 and f(x) = 0 elsewhere, we can rewrite the integral as:\na_0 = (1/2) * [∫(0)dx from -2 to 0 + ∫(4)dx from 0 to 2]\na_0 = (1/2) * [0 + 4x] evaluated from 0 to 2\na_0 = (1/2) * [8] = 4\n\na_n = (1/2) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/2)]dx from -2 to 2\nAgain, we can rewrite the integral as:\na_n = (1/2) * [∫(0)dx from -2 to 0 + ∫(4 * cos(nπx/2))dx from 0 to 2]\na_n = (1/2) * [0 + (8/πn) * sin(nπx/2)] evaluated from 0 to 2\na_n = (1/2) * [(8/πn) * sin(nπ)] = 0 (since sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n)\n\nb_n = (1/2) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/2)]dx from -2 to 2\nb_n = (1/2) * [∫(0)dx from -2 to 0 + ∫(4 * sin(nπx/2))dx from 0 to 2]\nb_n = (1/2) * [0 - (8/πn) * cos(nπx/2)] evaluated from 0 to 2\nb_n = (1/2) * [(-8/πn) * (cos(nπ) - 1)]\n\nNow, we can plug these coefficients into the general Fourier series formula:\n\nf(x) = 4/2 + Σ[0 * cos(nπx/2) + ((-8/πn) * (cos(nπ) - 1)) * sin(nπx/2)]\nf(x) = 2 + Σ[(-8/πn) * (cos(nπ) - 1) * sin(nπx/2)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given function f(x)."
