    "message_2": "To find the non-abelian groups of order 40, we first need to analyze the possible group structures. The order of a group is the number of its elements. Since 40 = 2^3 * 5, we have the following possibilities for the structure of a group of order 40:\n\n1. C_40 (cyclic group)\n2. C_2 x C_20\n3. C_4 x C_10\n4. C_8 x C_5\n5. C_2 x C_2 x C_10\n6. C_2 x C_4 x C_5\n\nThe first three possibilities are abelian groups, so we will focus on the last three possibilities, which are non-abelian groups.\n\n1. C_8 x C_5: There are two non-abelian groups in this case. They are the semidirect products of C_8 and C_5, where the action of C_5 on C_8 is non-trivial. These two groups are denoted by SD(C_8, C_5; 1) and SD(C_8, C_5; 3), where the numbers 1 and 3 represent the non-trivial actions.\n\n2. C_2 x C_2 x C_10: There are four non-abelian groups in this case. They are the semidirect products of C_2 x C_2 and C_10, where the action of C_10 on C_2 x C_2 is non-trivial. These four groups are denoted by SD(C_2 x C_2, C_10; 1), SD(C_2 x C_2, C_10; 3), SD(C_2 x C_2, C_10; 7), and SD(C_2 x C_2, C_10; 9), where the numbers 1, 3, 7, and 9 represent the non-trivial actions.\n\n3. C_2 x C_4 x C_5: There are two non-abelian groups in this case. They are the semidirect products of C_2 x C_4 and C_5, where the action of C_5 on C_2 x C_4 is non-trivial. These two groups are denoted by SD(C_2 x C_4, C_5; 1) and SD(C_2 x C_4, C_5; 3), where the numbers 1 and 3 represent the non-trivial actions.\n\nIn total, we have 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 non-abelian groups of order 40.\n\nTo determine which of these groups is isomorphic to a given group G of order 40, we would need more information about the structure of G. We could then compare the properties of G (such as its subgroups, normal subgroups, and quotient groups) with the properties of the eight non-abelian groups listed above to determine which group is isomorphic to G."
