    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem using complex analysis techniques, we will use the method of conformal mapping. The idea is to find a conformal map that transforms the given domain into a simpler domain, solve the problem in the simpler domain, and then map the solution back to the original domain.\n\nStep 1: Find a conformal map\n\nConsider the conformal map $f(z) = \\frac{z}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}$, where $z = x + iy$. This map transforms the rectangle $0 < x < 2$, $0 < y < 1$ into the unit square $0 < u < 1$, $0 < v < 1$, where $w = u + iv = f(z)$.\n\nStep 2: Solve the problem in the simpler domain\n\nIn the $w$-plane, the boundary value problem becomes:\n\n$u_{uu}(u,v) + u_{vv}(u,v) = 0$ , $0<u<1$ , $0<v<1$\n\n$u(u,0) = 0$ , $u(u,1) = 1$ , $u(0,v) = 0$ , $u(1,v) = v$\n\nWe can solve this problem using separation of variables. Assume that $u(u,v) = X(u)Y(v)$. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n$X''(u)Y(v) + X(u)Y''(v) = 0$\n\nDivide by $X(u)Y(v)$ to get:\n\n$\\frac{X''(u)}{X(u)} + \\frac{Y''(v)}{Y(v)} = 0$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $u$ and the right-hand side depends only on $v$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$X''(u) + \\lambda^2 X(u) = 0$\n\n$Y''(v) - \\lambda^2 Y(v) = 0$\n\nThe general solution for $X(u)$ is:\n\n$X(u) = A\\cos(\\lambda u) + B\\sin(\\lambda u)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $X(0) = 0$ and $X(1) = 0$, we get $A = 0$ and $\\lambda = n\\pi$, where $n$ is a positive integer. Thus, $X(u) = B\\sin(n\\pi u)$.\n\nThe general solution for $Y(v)$ is:\n\n$Y(v) = C\\cosh(\\lambda v) + D\\sinh(\\lambda v)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $Y(0) = 0$ and $Y(1) = 1$, we get $C = 0$ and $D = \\frac{1}{\\sinh(n\\pi)}$. Thus, $Y(v) = \\frac{\\sinh(n\\pi v)}{\\sinh(n\\pi)}$.\n\nThe solution in the $w$-plane is:\n\n$u(u,v) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin(n\\pi u) \\frac{\\sinh(n\\pi v)}{\\sinh(n\\pi)}$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $u(1,v) = v$, we get:\n\n$v = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin(n\\pi) \\frac{\\sinh(n\\pi v)}{\\sinh(n\\pi)}$\n\nSince $\\sin(n\\pi) = 0$ for all integer $n$, all the coefficients $B_n$ are zero. Thus, the solution in the $w$-plane is identically zero, i.e., $u(u,v) = 0$.\n\nStep 3: Map the solution back to the original domain\n\nSince the solution in the $w$-plane is identically zero, the solution in the $z$-plane is also identically zero. Thus, the solution to the boundary value problem is:\n\n$u(x,y) = 0$\n\nHowever, this solution does not satisfy the boundary condition $u(2,y) = y$. This indicates that the method of conformal mapping is not applicable to this problem, and a different method should be used to solve it."
