    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, our outer function is e^u and our inner function is u = sin(2x).\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the outer function with respect to u:\nd(e^u)/du = e^u\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the inner function with respect to x:\nu = sin(2x)\ndu/dx = d(sin(2x))/dx\n\nTo find the derivative of sin(2x), we'll use the chain rule again. The outer function is sin(v) and the inner function is v = 2x.\n\nThe derivative of the outer function with respect to v:\nd(sin(v))/dv = cos(v)\n\nThe derivative of the inner function with respect to x:\ndv/dx = d(2x)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of sin(2x) with respect to x:\nd(sin(2x))/dx = (cos(v)) * (dv/dx) = cos(2x) * 2 = 2cos(2x)\n\nNow that we have the derivatives of the outer and inner functions, we can find the derivative of y with respect to x using the chain rule:\ndy/dx = (d(e^u)/du) * (du/dx) = (e^u) * (2cos(2x)) = e^(sin(2x)) * 2cos(2x)\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = 2e^(sin(2x))cos(2x)"
