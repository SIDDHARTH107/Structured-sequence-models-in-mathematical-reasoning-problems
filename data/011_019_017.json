    "message_1": "A tire company is testing 4 different tire models and 3 different rim sizes for their cars. They want to run an experiment such that each tire model is tested with each rim size at least once. How many test runs do they need to conduct to satisfy this requirement using Orthogonal Arrays technique?",
    "message_2": "Orthogonal Arrays technique is a method used in experimental design to reduce the number of test runs needed while still maintaining the ability to analyze the effects of different factors on the outcome.\n\nIn this case, we have two factors: tire models (4 levels) and rim sizes (3 levels). To use Orthogonal Arrays technique, we need to find an array that has the smallest number of rows (test runs) while still satisfying the requirement that each tire model is tested with each rim size at least once.\n\nThe smallest orthogonal array that can accommodate these factors is the L12 array. The L12 array has 12 rows, which means that 12 test runs are needed to satisfy the requirement using Orthogonal Arrays technique.\n\nSo, the tire company needs to conduct 12 test runs to satisfy the requirement using Orthogonal Arrays technique."
