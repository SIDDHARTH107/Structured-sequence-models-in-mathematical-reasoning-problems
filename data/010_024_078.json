    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the angle sum of a triangle is always less than 180 degrees. To find the hyperbolic angle sum of a triangle \"ABC\" with angle measures 60 degrees, 80 degrees, and 40 degrees, we need to use the defect formula.\n\nThe defect of a triangle in hyperbolic geometry is given by:\n\nDefect = π - (A + B + C)\n\nwhere A, B, and C are the angles of the triangle in radians. First, we need to convert the angle measures from degrees to radians:\n\n60 degrees = (60 * π) / 180 = π/3 radians\n80 degrees = (80 * π) / 180 = 4π/9 radians\n40 degrees = (40 * π) / 180 = 2π/9 radians\n\nNow, we can find the defect:\n\nDefect = π - (π/3 + 4π/9 + 2π/9)\nDefect = π - (π/3 + 6π/9)\nDefect = π - (3π/9 + 6π/9)\nDefect = π - 9π/9\nDefect = π - π\nDefect = 0\n\nSince the defect is 0, the hyperbolic angle sum of the triangle is equal to π - Defect = π - 0 = π radians, which is approximately 180 degrees. However, this result contradicts the fact that the angle sum of a triangle in hyperbolic geometry should be less than 180 degrees.\n\nThe issue here is that the given angle measures (60, 80, and 40 degrees) actually form a triangle in Euclidean geometry, not hyperbolic geometry. In hyperbolic geometry, it is not possible to have a triangle with these angle measures."
