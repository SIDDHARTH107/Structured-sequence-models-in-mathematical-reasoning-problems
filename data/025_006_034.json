    "message_2": "To compute the second cohomology group H^2(X, Z), we will use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. Let's cover X with two open sets U and V, where U is the complement of the point (1, 0, 0) and V is the complement of the point (-1, 0, 0). Then, X = U ∪ V, and U ∩ V is the complement of the two points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0).\n\nNow, we will compute the cohomology groups of U, V, and U ∩ V. Since U and V are both homotopic to the 2-sphere S^2, their cohomology groups are the same as those of S^2:\n\nH^0(U, Z) = H^0(V, Z) = Z\nH^1(U, Z) = H^1(V, Z) = 0\nH^2(U, Z) = H^2(V, Z) = Z\n\nFor U ∩ V, we have a space homotopic to the 2-sphere S^2 with two points removed. This space is homotopic to a wedge sum of two circles, so its cohomology groups are:\n\nH^0(U ∩ V, Z) = Z\nH^1(U ∩ V, Z) = Z ⊕ Z\nH^2(U ∩ V, Z) = 0\n\nNow, we can write down the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the cohomology groups:\n\n→ H^0(U ∩ V, Z) → H^0(U, Z) ⊕ H^0(V, Z) → H^0(X, Z) → H^1(U ∩ V, Z) → H^1(U, Z) ⊕ H^1(V, Z) → H^1(X, Z) → H^2(U ∩ V, Z) → H^2(U, Z) ⊕ H^2(V, Z) → H^2(X, Z) → ...\n\nSince H^1(U, Z) = H^1(V, Z) = 0 and H^2(U ∩ V, Z) = 0, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence simplifies to:\n\n→ H^0(U ∩ V, Z) → H^0(U, Z) ⊕ H^0(V, Z) → H^0(X, Z) → H^1(U ∩ V, Z) → H^1(X, Z) → H^2(U, Z) ⊕ H^2(V, Z) → H^2(X, Z) → ...\n\nWe know that H^0(U ∩ V, Z) = Z, H^0(U, Z) ⊕ H^0(V, Z) = Z ⊕ Z, and H^0(X, Z) = Z. The map H^0(U ∩ V, Z) → H^0(U, Z) ⊕ H^0(V, Z) is an isomorphism, so the connecting homomorphism H^0(X, Z) → H^1(U ∩ V, Z) is the zero map. This implies that H^1(X, Z) = H^1(U ∩ V, Z) = Z ⊕ Z.\n\nFinally, we have the map H^1(X, Z) → H^2(U, Z) ⊕ H^2(V, Z) = Z ⊕ Z. Since H^1(X, Z) = Z ⊕ Z, this map is an isomorphism. Therefore, the connecting homomorphism H^2(U, Z) ⊕ H^2(V, Z) → H^2(X, Z) is the zero map, and we have H^2(X, Z) = H^2(U, Z) ⊕ H^2(V, Z) = Z ⊕ Z.\n\nSo, the second cohomology group H^2(X, Z) for X is Z ⊕ Z."
