    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, one of the equal angles is 60 degrees and the length of the equal sides is 4 cm. What is the length of the third side?",
    "message_2": "In an isosceles triangle, the two equal angles are opposite to the two equal sides. Since one of the equal angles is 60 degrees, the other equal angle is also 60 degrees. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so the third angle is 180 - 60 - 60 = 60 degrees.\n\nNow we have an equilateral triangle, where all angles are 60 degrees and two sides are 4 cm each. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so the length of the third side is also 4 cm."
