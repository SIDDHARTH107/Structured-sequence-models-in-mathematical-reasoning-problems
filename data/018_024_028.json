    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted by A Δ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the sets A' Δ B and A Δ B'. To do this, we first need to find the complements of A and B. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. Let's assume the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nA' = U - A = {4, 5, 6}\nB' = U - B = {1, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find A' Δ B and A Δ B':\n\nA' Δ B = (A' ∪ B) - (A' ∩ B)\nA' ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA' ∩ B = {4}\n\nA' Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}\n\nA Δ B' = (A ∪ B') - (A ∩ B')\nA ∪ B' = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}\nA ∩ B' = {1}\n\nA Δ B' = {2, 3, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find (A Δ B) Δ A' and A Δ (B Δ A'):\n\n(A Δ B) Δ A' = ({1, 4} Δ {4, 5, 6})\n(A Δ B) Δ A' = ({1, 4, 5, 6} - {4}) = {1, 5, 6}\n\nA Δ (B Δ A') = {1, 2, 3} Δ {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}\nA Δ (B Δ A') = ({1, 2, 3, 5, 6} - {1, 2, 3}) = {5, 6}\n\nSince (A Δ B) Δ A' ≠ A Δ (B Δ A'), we have shown that (A Δ B) Δ A' ≠ A Δ (B Δ A')."
