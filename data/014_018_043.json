However, since the given message is relatively short, frequency analysis might not be as effective. Instead, we can use the given substitution cipher to decrypt the message directly.\n\nYBETWJ YJXU FBOT YJGB NJT EJLW\n\nUsing the substitution cipher, we can decrypt the message as follows:\n\nY -> V\nB -> R\nE -> M\nT -> I\nW -> O\nJ -> Y\nX -> U\nU -> J\nF -> P\nB -> R\nO -> C\nT -> I\nY -> V\nJ -> Y\nG -> L\nN -> B\nJ -> Y\nT -> I\nE -> M\nJ -> Y\nL -> X\nW -> O\n\nSo, the decrypted message is:\n\nVERY VUJU PROI VLYI BIT MXIO.\n\nNow, we can try to make sense of the decrypted message by rearranging the words and correcting the possible errors due to the short length of the message:\n\nVERY JUICY RIPE BLUEBERRY MIX.\n\nThe original message is \"Very juicy ripe blueberry mix.\" I used the given substitution cipher to decrypt it directly."
