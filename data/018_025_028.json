Then, find the symmetric difference of B and A and the intersection of the symmetric difference with A. Show that the intersection of the symmetric difference with B is not equal to the intersection of the symmetric difference with A, proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∩ B = {2}\nA ∆ B = {1, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the symmetric difference with B.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {1, 4, 5, 6} ∩ {1, 2, 5} = {1, 5}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A.\n\nB ∆ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}\nB ∩ A = {2}\nB ∆ A = {1, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the symmetric difference with A.\n\n(B ∆ A) ∩ A = {1, 4, 5, 6} ∩ {2, 4, 6} = {4, 6}\n\nWe can see that the intersection of the symmetric difference with B is {1, 5}, and the intersection of the symmetric difference with A is {4, 6}.
