    "message_2": "To find a bound for the maximum value of |f''(0)|, we can use the Cauchy's estimates. Cauchy's estimates state that if f(z) is analytic in a disk D with radius R centered at z = a, and |f(z)| ≤ M for all z in D, then for any positive integer n,\n\n|f^n(a)| ≤ (n! * M) / R^n.\n\nIn our case, f(z) is analytic in the unit disk D with radius R = 1 and center a = 0. We are given that |f(z)| ≤ 7 for all z in D. We want to find a bound for |f''(0)|, so we will use n = 2.\n\nApplying Cauchy's estimates, we get:\n\n|f''(0)| ≤ (2! * 7) / 1^2\n|f''(0)| ≤ 14.\n\nThus, the maximum value of |f''(0)| is bounded by 14."
