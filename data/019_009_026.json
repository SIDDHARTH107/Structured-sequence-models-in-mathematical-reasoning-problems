However, I can provide a sample question for a math student to solve:\n\n\"Prove or disprove the statement: There exists a real number x such that x^2 = -1 using intuitionistic logic.\"",
    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, we focus on constructive proofs, meaning that we need to either provide an example of a real number x that satisfies x^2 = -1 or show that it is impossible to construct such a number.\n\nLet's try to prove or disprove the statement:\n\nAssume there exists a real number x such that x^2 = -1.\n\nNow, consider the properties of real numbers and their squares. For any real number x, if x is positive, then x^2 is positive. If x is negative, then x^2 is also positive (since a negative times a negative is a positive). If x is zero, then x^2 is zero.\n\nIn all cases, the square of a real number x is either positive or zero. It is never negative.\n\nSince -1 is a negative number, there is no real number x that can satisfy the equation x^2 = -1. Therefore, we have shown that it is impossible to construct such a number, and the statement is disproved using intuitionistic logic."
