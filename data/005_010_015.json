    "message_1": "A clothing company wants to predict the probability that a customer will buy a certain product. They know that only 25% of their customers are interested in this product. However, they also know that if a customer visits their website and searches for this product, the probability of them buying it increases to 50%. If a customer visits the website and doesn't search for the product, the probability remains at 25%.\n\nWhat is the probability that a customer who visited the website and searched for the product will buy it?",
    "message_2": "The problem already states that if a customer visits the website and searches for the product, the probability of them buying it increases to 50%. Therefore, the probability that a customer who visited the website and searched for the product will buy it is 50%."
