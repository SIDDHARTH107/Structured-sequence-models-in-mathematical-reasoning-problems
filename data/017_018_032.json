    "message_2": "Step 1: Sylow Theorems\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G, denoted by n_2, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides the order of G, which is 32.\n2. n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n\nFrom these conditions, we have that n_2 can be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.\n\nStep 2: Sylow 2-subgroups\n\nIf n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of G, which must be normal. Since the order of this subgroup is 32, it must be isomorphic to G itself. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 32, i.e., G is isomorphic to C32.\n\nStep 3: Considering other cases\n\nNow we consider the cases where n_2 > 1. In these cases, G cannot be cyclic, as a cyclic group has a unique subgroup of each order dividing the group order.\n\nIf n_2 = 2, 4, 8, or 16, then G must have at least one element of order 2 (by Cauchy's theorem). Let x be an element of order 2 in G. Then, the centralizer of x, denoted by C_G(x), must have order at least 4 (since it contains the identity element, x, and at least one other element of order 2).\n\nStep 4: Centralizer and quotient group\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/C_G(x). By the correspondence theorem, the subgroups of G/C_G(x) correspond to the subgroups of G containing C_G(x). Since G is non-abelian, G/C_G(x) must be non-abelian as well.\n\nStep 5: Possible structures\n\nNow we consider the possible structures of G/C_G(x). Since the order of G is 32 and the order of C_G(x) is at least 4, the order of G/C_G(x) must be a divisor of 8. Thus, G/C_G(x) can have order 2, 4, or 8.\n\nIf G/C_G(x) has order 2, then G is an extension of C_G(x) by a group of order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D16.\n\nIf G/C_G(x) has order 4 or 8, then G is an extension of C_G(x) by a group of order 4 or 8, respectively. In these cases, G must be one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32."
