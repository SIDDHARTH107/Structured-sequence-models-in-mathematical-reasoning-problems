    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron or Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each iteration, the number of triangles increases.\n\nIn the 0th iteration, there is 1 tetrahedron with 4 faces (triangles).\n\nIn the 1st iteration, there are 4 smaller tetrahedra, each with 4 faces, for a total of 4 * 4 = 16 triangles.\n\nIn general, the number of triangles in the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nT(n) = 4^n * 4\n\nwhere T(n) is the number of triangles in the nth iteration and n is the iteration number.\n\nSo, for the 5th iteration, the number of triangles is:\n\nT(5) = 4^5 * 4 = 1024 * 4 = 4096 triangles."
