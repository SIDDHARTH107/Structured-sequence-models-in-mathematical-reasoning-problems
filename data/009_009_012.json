    "message_2": "To find the energy levels of a particle in a 1-dimensional box, we can use the time-independent Schrödinger equation. For a particle in a box, the potential energy V(x) is zero inside the box (0 < x < L) and infinite outside the box. The Schrödinger equation for this system is:\n\n(-ħ²/2m)(d²ψ/dx²) = Eψ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h/2π ≈ 1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s), m is the mass of the particle, ψ is the wave function, and E is the energy of the particle.\n\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\nψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = √(2mE/ħ²).\n\nSince the potential is infinite outside the box, the wave function must be zero at the boundaries (x = 0 and x = L). Applying these boundary conditions, we get:\n\nψ(0) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0\nψ(L) = A sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the wave function would be trivially zero everywhere), we must have sin(kL) = 0. This implies that kL = nπ, where n is an integer. Therefore, the allowed values of k are:\n\nk_n = nπ/L\n\nNow we can find the corresponding energy levels E_n using the relation k = √(2mE/ħ²):\n\nE_n = (ħ²k_n²)/(2m) = (ħ²(nπ/L)²)/(2m)\n\nPlugging in the given values (m = 0.01 kg, L = 0.1 m) and the first three values of n (n = 1, 2, 3), we can calculate the first three energy levels:\n\nE_1 = (1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² * (1π/0.1 m)² / (2 * 0.01 kg) ≈ 6.024 x 10⁻³⁴ J\nE_2 = (1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² * (2π/0.1 m)² / (2 * 0.01 kg) ≈ 2.410 x 10⁻³³ J\nE_3 = (1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² * (3π/0.1 m)² / (2 * 0.01 kg) ≈ 5.418 x 10⁻³³ J\n\nSo, the first three energy levels of the particle are approximately 6.024 x 10⁻³⁴ J, 2.410 x 10⁻³³ J, and 5.418 x 10⁻³³ J."
