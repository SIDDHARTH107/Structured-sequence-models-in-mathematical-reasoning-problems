    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 1234 is divided by 9, we can use the divisibility rule for 9, which states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. \n\nSo, let's find the sum of the digits of 1234:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\n\nNow, we can see that 10 is not divisible by 9. To find the remainder, we can divide 10 by 9:\n\n10 รท 9 = 1 with a remainder of 1\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 1234 is divided by 9 is 1."
