    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)\n\nIn this case, the length is 15 centimeters and the width is 8 centimeters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPerimeter = 2(15 + 8)\nPerimeter = 2(23)\nPerimeter = 46 centimeters\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 46 centimeters."
