    "message_1": "A plumbing network has the following structure:\n\n- A water source connected to two pipes.\n- The two pipes converge onto a single pipe.\n- The single pipe then diverges onto three pipes.\n- Each of the three pipes ends at three separate water outlets.\n\nThe capacities of the pipes are as follows:\n\n- The two pipes connected to the water source can each carry up to 8 liters of water per minute.\n- The single pipe can carry up to 15 liters of water per minute.\n- The three pipes at the end of the single pipe can each carry up to 5 liters of water per minute.\n\nIf all the water outlets are open, what is the maximum amount of water that can flow through the network per minute?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum amount of water that can flow through the network per minute, we need to consider the capacities of the pipes at each stage.\n\n1. The two pipes connected to the water source can each carry up to 8 liters of water per minute, so they have a combined capacity of 8 + 8 = 16 liters per minute.\n\n2. The single pipe can carry up to 15 liters of water per minute. Since the combined capacity of the two pipes connected to the water source is 16 liters per minute, the single pipe becomes the bottleneck at this stage, limiting the flow to 15 liters per minute.\n\n3. The three pipes at the end of the single pipe can each carry up to 5 liters of water per minute, so they have a combined capacity of 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 liters per minute.\n\nSince the single pipe and the three pipes at the end have the same combined capacity of 15 liters per minute, this is the maximum amount of water that can flow through the network per minute."
