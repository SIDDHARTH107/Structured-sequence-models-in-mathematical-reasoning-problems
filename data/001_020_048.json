    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |2x + 3| = 9, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x + 3 = 9\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n2x = 6\nDivide by 2:\nx = 3\n\nCase 2: 2x + 3 = -9\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n2x = -12\nDivide by 2:\nx = -6\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation |2x + 3| = 9 are x = 3 and x = -6."
