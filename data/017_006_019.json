    "message_2": "To show that either G is cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers.\n\nBy the first Sylow theorem, there exist Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups in G.\n\nLet n_5 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups and n_7 be the number of Sylow 7-subgroups.\n\nBy the third Sylow theorem, we have:\n\n1. n_5 divides 7 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_7 divides 5 and n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nFrom the first condition, n_5 can only be 1 or 7. However, if n_5 = 7, then there would be 7 * (5 - 1) = 28 elements of order 5 in G, which is impossible since the order of G is 35. Therefore, n_5 = 1.\n\nFrom the second condition, n_7 can only be 1 or 5. However, if n_7 = 5, then there would be 5 * (7 - 1) = 30 elements of order 7 in G, which is also impossible. Therefore, n_7 = 1.\n\nSince n_5 = n_7 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 7-subgroup Q in G. The uniqueness of these subgroups implies that they are both normal in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the product PQ. Since P and Q are normal in G, the product PQ is a subgroup of G. The order of PQ is given by the product formula:\n\n|PQ| = (|P| * |Q|) / |P ∩ Q|\n\nSince P and Q are cyclic groups of prime orders 5 and 7, their intersection can only be the identity element. Therefore, |P ∩ Q| = 1, and we have:\n\n|PQ| = (5 * 7) / 1 = 35\n\nSince |PQ| = |G|, we have PQ = G. Thus, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, either G is cyclic (if there exists an element of order 35 in G) or G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
