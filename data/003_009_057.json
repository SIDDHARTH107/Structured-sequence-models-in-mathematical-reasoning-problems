    "message_2": "We are given a right-angled triangle with base length 5 cm and hypotenuse length 13 cm. Let's denote the base as a, the height as b, and the hypotenuse as c. We have:\n\na = 5 cm\nc = 13 cm\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height (b) of the triangle:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n(5)^2 + b^2 = (13)^2\n25 + b^2 = 169\n\nNow, solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 169 - 25\nb^2 = 144\nb = âˆš144\nb = 12 cm\n\nNow that we have the height (b), we can find the perimeter of the triangle. The perimeter (P) is the sum of all the sides:\n\nP = a + b + c\nP = 5 + 12 + 13\nP = 30 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is 30 cm."
