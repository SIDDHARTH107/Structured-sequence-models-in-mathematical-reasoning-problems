    "message_2": "To calculate the fundamental group of X at the point x, we will use the fact that the fundamental group of the base space X can be determined by the fundamental group of the covering space E and the action of the fundamental group of X on the fiber p^(-1)(x).\n\nSince E is path-connected and locally path-connected, we know that the fundamental group of E is well-defined. Let G = π_1(E, e) be the fundamental group of E at the point e.\n\nNow, consider the action of the fundamental group of X, π_1(X, x), on the fiber p^(-1)(x). This action is given by the monodromy action, which is defined as follows:\n\nFor each element [α] in π_1(X, x), where α is a loop in X based at x, and for each element e' in p^(-1)(x), there exists a unique lift α' of α to a path in E starting at e'. The endpoint of α' is then denoted by [α] * e'.\n\nSince p is a covering map, the monodromy action is well-defined and transitive. Moreover, since there exists a homeomorphism f: E -> p^(-1)(x) such that f(e) = e for all e in p^(-1)(x), we can identify the fiber p^(-1)(x) with E itself.\n\nNow, we can use the following theorem to determine the fundamental group of X at the point x:\n\nTheorem: Let p: E -> X be a covering map, where E is path-connected and locally path-connected. Then, the fundamental group of X at the point x is isomorphic to the quotient group G / H, where G is the fundamental group of E at the point e, and H is the subgroup of G consisting of elements that fix the fiber p^(-1)(x) under the monodromy action.\n\nIn our case, since the fiber p^(-1)(x) can be identified with E, the subgroup H consists of elements in G that fix all points in E under the monodromy action. However, since E is path-connected, the only element in G that fixes all points in E is the identity element. Therefore, H is the trivial subgroup {1}.\n\nThus, the fundamental group of X at the point x is isomorphic to the quotient group G / H, which is just G itself, since H is the trivial subgroup.\n\nSo, π_1(X, x) ≅ π_1(E, e)."
