    "message_2": "Let's consider the cross-sectional view of the sphere and the cylindrical rod. The sphere has a radius of 4 cm. We want to find the minimum radius of the cylindrical rod that can be moved under the sphere without touching it.\n\nImagine a right triangle formed by the center of the sphere, the point where the rod would touch the sphere, and the point where the rod would touch the flat surface. The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the radius of the sphere (4 cm), and one of the legs is the radius of the cylindrical rod (let's call it r). The other leg of the triangle is the distance between the center of the sphere and the point where the rod would touch the flat surface, which is equal to the difference between the radius of the sphere and the radius of the rod (4 - r).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can write the equation:\n\n(4 - r)^2 + r^2 = 4^2\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation:\n\n(16 - 8r + r^2) + r^2 = 16\n2r^2 - 8r = 0\n\nFactoring out 2r:\n\n2r(r - 4) = 0\n\nThe possible solutions for r are 0 and 4. However, a rod with a radius of 0 is not possible, so the minimum radius of the cylindrical rod that can be moved under the sphere without touching it is 4 cm."
