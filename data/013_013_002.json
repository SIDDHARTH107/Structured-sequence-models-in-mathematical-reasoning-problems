The valuations of the painting that each bidder has are as follows:\n\nBidder 1: $10,000 \nBidder 2: $8,000 \nBidder 3: $7,500 \nBidder 4: $6,000 \nBidder 5: $4,500 \n\nIf the auction is a second-price sealed-bid auction, what is the winning bid and who wins the painting?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the painting, but they pay the second-highest bid price. In this case, the bids are as follows:\n\nBidder 1: $10,000\nBidder 2: $8,000\nBidder 3: $7,500\nBidder 4: $6,000\nBidder 5: $4,500\n\nBidder 1 has the highest bid at $10,000, so they win the painting. However, they will pay the second-highest bid price, which is $8,000 from Bidder 2. So, the winning bid is $8,000, and Bidder 1 wins the painting."
