    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we'll first find the relationship between the volume of the water in the tank and the height of the water level. Then, we'll use the given rate of change of the height to find the rate of change of the volume.\n\nLet V be the volume of the water in the tank, h be the height of the water level, and r be the radius of the water surface. The volume of a cone is given by the formula:\n\nV = (1/3)πr^2h\n\nSince the tank is also a cone, we can find the relationship between r and h using similar triangles. The ratio of the radius to the height is constant for similar triangles, so we have:\n\nr/h = (1/2 * diameter of tank) / height of tank\nr/h = (1/2 * 8) / 12\nr/h = 4/12\nr = (1/3)h\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into the volume formula:\n\nV = (1/3)π((1/3)h)^2h\nV = (1/3)π(1/9)h^2h\nV = (1/27)πh^3\n\nNow we can differentiate V with respect to time t to find the rate of change of the volume:\n\ndV/dt = (1/27)π(3h^2)(dh/dt)\n\nWe are given that the height of the water level is decreasing at a rate of 0.5 feet per minute, so dh/dt = -0.5 ft/min. We want to find the rate of change of the volume when the water level is 6 feet high:\n\ndV/dt = (1/27)π(3(6)^2)(-0.5)\ndV/dt = (1/27)π(108)(-0.5)\ndV/dt = -54π ft³/min\n\nSo, the volume of water in the tank is decreasing at a rate of 54π cubic feet per minute when the water level is 6 feet high."
