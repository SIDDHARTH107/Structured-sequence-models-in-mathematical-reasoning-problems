    "message_2": "Let's call the two specific people A and B. Since they cannot serve as the committee chair, we need to choose the chair from the remaining 6 people. After choosing the chair, we have 1 spot left in the committee, which can be filled by any of the remaining 5 people (excluding A, B, and the chosen chair).\n\nSo, the number of different committees that can be formed is:\n\n6 (choices for the chair) * 5 (choices for the remaining member) = 30 different committees."
