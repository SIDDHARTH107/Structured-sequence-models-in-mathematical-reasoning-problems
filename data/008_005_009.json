    "message_2": "We will solve this system of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method.\n\nFirst, we write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -3 & 6 \\\\\n2 & -3 & 4 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -1 & -4\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Subtract the first row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -3 & 6 \\\\\n2 & -3 & 4 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 2 & -10\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nStep 2: Add twice the first row to the second row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -3 & 6 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -2 & -11 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 2 & -10\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nStep 3: Add the second row to the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -3 & 6 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -2 & -11 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -21\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form. Notice that the last row represents the equation $0x + 0y + 0z = -21$, which is a contradiction. This means that the given system of linear equations has no solution, and it is an inconsistent system."
