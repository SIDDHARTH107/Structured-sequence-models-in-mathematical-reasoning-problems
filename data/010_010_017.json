    "message_2": "(a) To find the critical points of $f(x, y) = x^2 - 2y^2$, we first compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -4y.\n$$\n\nA critical point occurs when both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n$$\n2x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0, \\quad -4y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0.\n$$\n\nThus, there is only one critical point, which is $(0, 0)$.\n\n(b) To compute the Morse index, we need to find the Hessian matrix of $f$:\n\n$$\nH(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -4\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. The eigenvalues of $H(f)$ are the diagonal elements, which are $2$ and $-4$. There is one negative eigenvalue, so the Morse index of the critical point $(0, 0)$ is $1$.\n\n(c) To find the number of critical points on the level set $f(x, y) = 1$, we need to solve the equation $x^2 - 2y^2 = 1$ for $x$ and $y$. However, since we have already found that the only critical point of $f$ is $(0, 0)$, and this point does not satisfy the equation $x^2 - 2y^2 = 1$, there are no critical points of $f$ on the level set $f(x, y) = 1$."
