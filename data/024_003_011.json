    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 - y^2 at the point (1, -1, 0), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - v^2)\n\nNow, we find the first partial derivatives:\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, -2v)\n\nNext, we find the second partial derivatives:\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, -2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 0\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\ne = r_uu • N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nf = r_uv • N = 0\ng = r_vv • N = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface, which is given by the cross product of r_u and r_v, and then normalized.\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (eg - f^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1, -1, 0), we have u = 1 and v = -1. Plugging these values into the coefficients, we get:\n\nE = 5, F = 0, G = 5\ne = 2 / sqrt(10), f = 0, g = -2 / sqrt(10)\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature:\n\nK = ((2 / sqrt(10))(-2 / sqrt(10)) - 0^2) / (5 * 5 - 0^2)\nK = (4 / 10) / 25\nK = 4 / 250\nK = 1 / 62.5\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 - y^2 at the point (1, -1, 0) is 1 / 62.5."
