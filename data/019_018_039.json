    "message_2": "To prove that there is no largest prime number, we can use a proof by contradiction. We will assume that there is a largest prime number and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\nSuppose there is a largest prime number, and let's call it P. Now, consider the number N which is the product of all prime numbers up to P, and then add 1 to it. So, N = (2 * 3 * 5 * ... * P) + 1.\n\nNow, let's examine the factors of N. Since N is one more than the product of all prime numbers up to P, it is not divisible by any of those prime numbers. If it were divisible by any of them, there would be a remainder of 1 when divided.\n\nThis means that N is either a prime number itself or has a prime factor greater than P. If N is a prime number, then it is a prime number larger than P, which contradicts our assumption that P is the largest prime number. If N has a prime factor greater than P, then there exists a prime number larger than P, which again contradicts our assumption.\n\nIn both cases, we reach a contradiction, which means our original assumption that there is a largest prime number must be false. Therefore, there is no largest prime number, and the set of prime numbers is infinite."
