    "message_1": "Suppose that a cryptographic hash function produces a hash value of length 256 bits. How many possible hash values can this function produce?",
    "message_2": "A cryptographic hash function that produces a hash value of length 256 bits can produce 2^256 possible hash values. This is because each bit can have 2 possible values (0 or 1), and there are 256 bits. So, the total number of possible hash values is 2 multiplied by itself 256 times, which is 2^256."
