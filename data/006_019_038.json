    "message_1": "What is the probability that in a particular country, at least 3 political parties win seats in a national election where there are 5 political parties contesting for the election? Assume that each party's chance of winning a seat is 0.6.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 3 political parties winning seats, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, political parties winning seats)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (0.6 in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (5 political parties)\n- k is the number of successes (3, 4, or 5 political parties winning seats)\n\nWe will calculate the probability for 3, 4, and 5 political parties winning seats and then sum these probabilities to find the probability of at least 3 political parties winning seats.\n\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * 0.6^3 * 0.4^2 = 10 * 0.216 * 0.16 = 0.3456\nP(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * 0.6^4 * 0.4^1 = 5 * 0.1296 * 0.4 = 0.2592\nP(X = 5) = C(5, 5) * 0.6^5 * 0.4^0 = 1 * 0.07776 * 1 = 0.07776\n\nNow, we sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X â‰¥ 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) = 0.3456 + 0.2592 + 0.07776 = 0.68256\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 political parties win seats in the national election is approximately 0.68256 or 68.256%."
