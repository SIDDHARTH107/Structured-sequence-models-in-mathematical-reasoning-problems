    "message_2": "Let's denote the odd number as n, and the Sophie Germain prime as p. According to the definition, p = 2n + 1, where p is prime.\n\nSince n is odd, we can write it as n = 2k + 1, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, let's substitute n into the equation for p:\n\np = 2(2k + 1) + 1 = 4k + 3\n\nWe are looking for the smallest Sophie Germain prime, so let's start with the smallest odd number, which is 1:\n\nn = 1\nk = (n - 1) / 2 = (1 - 1) / 2 = 0\n\nNow, let's find p:\n\np = 4k + 3 = 4(0) + 3 = 3\n\nSince 3 is a prime number, the smallest Sophie Germain prime is 3."
