    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\n\n$u(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$\n\nSubstitute this into the given partial differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^{2}u}{\\partial x^{2}} +\\frac{\\partial^{2}u}{\\partial y^{2}}= X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$\n\nNow, divide by $u(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-\\lambda$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$\n\n$\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n\n$Y''(y) - \\lambda Y(y) = 0$\n\nWe will solve these ODEs separately. For the X(x) equation, we have three cases depending on the value of $\\lambda$:\n\n1. $\\lambda > 0$: The solution is $X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$\n2. $\\lambda = 0$: The solution is $X(x) = Ax + B$\n3. $\\lambda < 0$: The solution is $X(x) = Ae^{\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x} + Be^{-\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x}$\n\nNow, let's apply the boundary conditions for x:\n\n$u(x,0) = X(x)Y(0) = x^2 \\Rightarrow Y(0) = 1$\n\n$u(x,1) = X(x)Y(1) = x^2 - 2x \\Rightarrow Y(1) = x^2 - 2x$\n\nSince $Y(0) = 1$, we can eliminate the cases $\\lambda = 0$ and $\\lambda < 0$. Therefore, we are left with the case $\\lambda > 0$. Now, let's solve the Y(y) equation:\n\n$Y''(y) - \\lambda Y(y) = 0$\n\nThe solution is $Y(y) = C\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y) + D\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y)$\n\nNow, apply the boundary conditions for y:\n\n$u(0,y) = X(0)Y(y) = y^4 - y \\Rightarrow X(0) = y^4 - y$\n\n$u(1,y) = X(1)Y(y) = y^3 \\Rightarrow X(1) = y^3$\n\nSince $X(0) = y^4 - y$ and $X(1) = y^3$, we can find the coefficients A and B:\n\n$A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = y^4 - y \\Rightarrow A = y^4 - y$\n\n$A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = y^3$\n\nNow, we have a system of equations for A and B:\n\n$A = y^4 - y$\n\n$A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = y^3$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations for A and B, and then substitute them back into the solution for X(x):\n\n$X(x) = (y^4 - y)\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$\n\nFinally, the solution for the boundary value problem is:\n\n$u(x,y) = X(x)Y(y) = [(y^4 - y)\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)][C\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y) + D\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y)]$\n\nHowever, this solution is not unique, as there are infinitely many values of $\\lambda$ that satisfy the boundary conditions. In practice, one would typically use a series solution (e.g., Fourier series) to approximate the solution for a given problem."
