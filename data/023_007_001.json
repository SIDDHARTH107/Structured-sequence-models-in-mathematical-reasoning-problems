    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series coefficients, we need to use the following formulas:\n\na_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(t) * cos(nωt) dt] from 0 to T\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(t) * sin(nωt) dt] from 0 to T\n\nwhere T is the period of the signal, ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2π/T), and n is the harmonic number.\n\nGiven the period T = 4 seconds, we can calculate the angular frequency ω:\n\nω = 2π/T = 2π/4 = π/2\n\nThe signal f(t) is given as a discrete set of values, so we can approximate the integrals using a Riemann sum. Since the signal is periodic, we can focus on one period (0 to 4 seconds) and divide it into 8 equal intervals, each with a duration of 0.5 seconds. The signal values for these intervals are:\n\nf(t) = {1, 2, 3, 0, -1, -2, -3, 0}\n\nNow, we can calculate the Fourier coefficients up to the fifth harmonic (n = 1 to 5):\n\na_n = (2/T) * Σ[f(t_i) * cos(nωt_i) * Δt] for i = 0 to 7\nb_n = (2/T) * Σ[f(t_i) * sin(nωt_i) * Δt] for i = 0 to 7\n\nwhere Δt = 0.5 seconds.\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\na_0 = (1/T) * Σ[f(t_i) * Δt] for i = 0 to 7\na_0 = (1/4) * (1 + 2 + 3 + 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 + 0) * 0.5 = 0\n\nFor n = 1 to 5:\n\na_n = (1/2) * (1 * cos(nπ/4) + 2 * cos(nπ/2) + 3 * cos(3nπ/4) - cos(5nπ/4) - 2 * cos(3nπ/2) - 3 * cos(7nπ/4))\nb_n = (1/2) * (1 * sin(nπ/4) + 2 * sin(nπ/2) + 3 * sin(3nπ/4) - sin(5nπ/4) - 2 * sin(3nπ/2) - 3 * sin(7nπ/4))\n\nCalculating the coefficients for n = 1 to 5:\n\na_1 = 0.5, b_1 = 1.5\na_2 = 0, b_2 = -1\na_3 = -0.5, b_3 = 0.5\na_4 = 0, b_4 = 0\na_5 = 0.5, b_5 = -0.5\n\nSo, the Fourier series coefficients up to the fifth harmonic are:\n\na_0 = 0\na_1 = 0.5, b_1 = 1.5\na_2 = 0, b_2 = -1\na_3 = -0.5, b_3 = 0.5\na_4 = 0, b_4 = 0\na_5 = 0.5, b_5 = -0.5"
