    "message_2": "To find the public key when Alice chooses a private key of 5, we need to perform scalar multiplication of the base point (2, 7) by the private key 5. In other words, we need to compute 5 * (2, 7) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 13 over the finite field GF(29).\n\nScalar multiplication on an elliptic curve involves point addition, which is performed using the following formulas:\n\n1. If P = (x1, y1) and Q = (x2, y2), then P + Q = (x3, y3), where:\n   x3 = (λ^2 - x1 - x2) mod p\n   y3 = (λ(x1 - x3) - y1) mod p\n\n2. λ is the slope of the line connecting P and Q. If P ≠ Q, then:\n   λ = (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1) mod p\n\n3. If P = Q, then:\n   λ = (3x1^2 + a) * (2y1)^(-1) mod p\n\nHere, a = 7 and p = 29. Let's compute 5 * (2, 7):\n\n1. First, compute 2 * (2, 7) = (2, 7) + (2, 7):\n   λ = (3 * 2^2 + 7) * (2 * 7)^(-1) mod 29\n   λ = (12 + 7) * 14^(-1) mod 29\n   λ = 19 * 14^(-1) mod 29\n   λ = 19 * 2 mod 29 (since 14^(-1) mod 29 = 2)\n   λ = 38 mod 29\n   λ = 9\n\n   x3 = (9^2 - 2 - 2) mod 29\n   x3 = (81 - 4) mod 29\n   x3 = 77 mod 29\n   x3 = 10\n\n   y3 = (9(2 - 10) - 7) mod 29\n   y3 = (-72 - 7) mod 29\n   y3 = -79 mod 29\n   y3 = 8\n\n   So, 2 * (2, 7) = (10, 8).\n\n2. Now, compute 4 * (2, 7) = 2 * (10, 8):\n   λ = (3 * 10^2 + 7) * (2 * 8)^(-1) mod 29\n   λ = (300 + 7) * 16^(-1) mod 29\n   λ = 307 * 16^(-1) mod 29\n   λ = 307 * 9 mod 29 (since 16^(-1) mod 29 = 9)\n   λ = 2763 mod 29\n   λ = 22\n\n   x3 = (22^2 - 10 - 10) mod 29\n   x3 = (484 - 20) mod 29\n   x3 = 464 mod 29\n   x3 = 6\n\n   y3 = (22(10 - 6) - 8) mod 29\n   y3 = (88 - 8) mod 29\n   y3 = 80 mod 29\n   y3 = 23\n\n   So, 4 * (2, 7) = (6, 23).\n\n3. Finally, compute 5 * (2, 7) = 4 * (2, 7) + (2, 7) = (6, 23) + (2, 7):\n   λ = (7 - 23) * (2 - 6)^(-1) mod 29\n   λ = (-16) * (-4)^(-1) mod 29\n   λ = (-16) * 7 mod 29 (since -4^(-1) mod 29 = 7)\n   λ = -112 mod 29\n   λ = 3\n\n   x3 = (3^2 - 6 - 2) mod 29\n   x3 = (9 - 8) mod 29\n   x3 = 1 mod 29\n   x3 = 1\n\n   y3 = (3(6 - 1) - 23) mod 29\n   y3 = (15 - 23) mod 29\n   y3 = -8 mod 29\n   y3 = 21\n\n   So, 5 * (2, 7) = (1, 21).\n\nThus, the public key when Alice chooses a private key of 5 is (1, 21)."
