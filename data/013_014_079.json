    "message_1": "Here's a possible question:\n\nSuppose you're organizing an auction for a valuable painting. There are two bidders, Alice and Bob, whose valuations for the painting are private information known only to themselves. Alice's valuation is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2000 (dollars), while Bob's valuation is uniformly distributed between 0 and 3000 (dollars). For simplicity, assume that the auction is sealed-bid, meaning that each bidder submits a single bid simultaneously without knowing the other's bid. You want to design a mechanism that maximizes your revenue (i.e., the price you get for the painting). \n\n(a) What is the expected value of Alice's valuation? What is the expected value of Bob's valuation?\n\n(b) Suppose you decide to use a second-price auction, meaning that the highest bidder wins the painting but pays the price of the second-highest bid. What is the expected revenue of this auction? What is the expected payment of the winner? What is the expected surplus of each bidder (i.e., the difference between their valuation and their payment)?\n\n(c) Suppose you decide to use a first-price auction, meaning that the highest bidder wins the painting and pays their bid. What is the expected revenue of this auction? What is the expected payment of the winner? What is the expected surplus of each bidder?\n\n(d) Which auction yields higher expected revenue? Which auction yields higher expected surplus for the winner? Explain your answers.",
    "message_2": "(a) The expected value of Alice's valuation is the average value of her uniform distribution between 0 and 2000. The expected value of a uniform distribution is the midpoint of the range, so for Alice, it is (0 + 2000)/2 = 1000 dollars. Similarly, the expected value of Bob's valuation is the midpoint of his range, which is (0 + 3000)/2 = 1500 dollars.\n\n(b) In a second-price auction, the expected revenue is the expected value of the second-highest bid. Since Alice's valuation range is a subset of Bob's, the second-highest bid will be Alice's bid with probability 2/3 (as Bob's valuation is higher with probability 2/3). The expected revenue is thus (2/3) * 1000 = 2000/3 ≈ 666.67 dollars. The expected payment of the winner is the same as the expected revenue in a second-price auction. The expected surplus for Alice is her expected valuation minus her expected payment, which is 1000 - 666.67 = 333.33 dollars. The expected surplus for Bob is his expected valuation minus his expected payment, which is 1500 - 666.67 = 833.33 dollars.\n\n(c) In a first-price auction, bidders will typically bid below their true valuation to avoid overpaying. However, for simplicity, let's assume that both Alice and Bob bid their true valuations. In this case, the expected revenue is the expected value of the highest bid. Since Bob's valuation is higher with probability 2/3, the expected revenue is (1/3) * 1000 + (2/3) * 1500 = 1000/3 + 3000/3 = 4000/3 ≈ 1333.33 dollars. The expected payment of the winner is the same as the expected revenue in a first-price auction. The expected surplus for Alice is her expected valuation minus her expected payment, which is 1000 - 1333.33 = -333.33 dollars. The expected surplus for Bob is his expected valuation minus his expected payment, which is 1500 - 1333.33 = 166.67 dollars.\n\n(d) Comparing the expected revenues, the first-price auction yields higher expected revenue (1333.33 dollars) than the second-price auction (666.67 dollars). Comparing the expected surpluses for the winner, the second-price auction yields a higher expected surplus for the winner (Alice: 333.33 dollars, Bob: 833.33 dollars) than the first-price auction (Alice: -333.33 dollars, Bob: 166.67 dollars). The first-price auction is more advantageous for the seller, while the second-price auction is more advantageous for the bidders in terms of surplus."
