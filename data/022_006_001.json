    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of |f(z)| on the boundary of the disc |z| = 1, we can use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that the maximum of |f(z)| on a closed and bounded domain occurs on the boundary of the domain.\n\nSince we are considering the boundary of the disc |z| = 1, we can let z = e^(iθ), where θ is a real number and 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π. Then, we can substitute z = e^(iθ) into the function f(z) and find the magnitude of the resulting expression:\n\nf(e^(iθ)) = (e^(iθ))^3 + 2(e^(iθ))^2 + 3(e^(iθ)) + 4\n= e^(3iθ) + 2e^(2iθ) + 3e^(iθ) + 4\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum value of |f(e^(iθ))|:\n\n|f(e^(iθ))| = |e^(3iθ) + 2e^(2iθ) + 3e^(iθ) + 4|\n\nTo find the maximum value of this expression, we can use the triangle inequality, which states that |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b| for any complex numbers a and b. Applying the triangle inequality, we get:\n\n|f(e^(iθ))| ≤ |e^(3iθ)| + |2e^(2iθ)| + |3e^(iθ)| + |4|\n= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n= 10\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of |f(z)| on the boundary of the disc |z| = 1 is 10."
