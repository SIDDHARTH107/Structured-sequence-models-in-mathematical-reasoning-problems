Apply principal component analysis to the matrix and determine the percentage of the total variance that can be explained by the first principal component.\n\nHere's the matrix: \n\n| Hours  | Age | Income |\n|-------|-----|--------|\n| 35    | 25  | $35,000 |\n| 45    | 32  | $50,000 |\n| 30    | 43  | $28,000 |",
    "message_2": "To apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the given matrix, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Standardize the data\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix\n3. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix\n4. Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and choose the first principal component\n5. Calculate the percentage of the total variance explained by the first principal component\n\nStep 1: Standardize the data\n\nFirst, we need to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each variable:\n\nMean of Hours: (35 + 45 + 30) / 3 = 36.67\nStandard deviation of Hours: sqrt(((35-36.67)^2 + (45-36.67)^2 + (30-36.67)^2) / 3) = 6.11\n\nMean of Age: (25 + 32 + 43) / 3 = 33.33\nStandard deviation of Age: sqrt(((25-33.33)^2 + (32-33.33)^2 + (43-33.33)^2) / 3) = 7.64\n\nMean of Income: (35000 + 50000 + 28000) / 3 = 37666.67\nStandard deviation of Income: sqrt(((35000-37666.67)^2 + (50000-37666.67)^2 + (28000-37666.67)^2) / 3) = 9128.65\n\nStandardized matrix:\n\n| Hours  | Age | Income |\n|-------|-----|--------|\n| -0.27 | -1.09 | -0.34 |\n| 1.36  | -0.17 | 1.35  |\n| -1.09 | 1.27  | -1.08 |\n\nStep 2: Calculate the covariance matrix\n\nCovariance matrix:\n\n| 1.00  | -0.01 | 0.99 |\n| -0.01 | 1.00  | -0.02|\n| 0.99  | -0.02 | 1.00 |\n\nStep 3: Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix\n\nEigenvalues: 位1 = 1.99, 位2 = 0.99, 位3 = 0.02\nEigenvectors: v1 = [0.71, -0.03, 0.71], v2 = [-0.71, -0.03, 0.71], v3 = [0.00, 1.00, 0.00]\n\nStep 4: Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and choose the first principal component\n\nThe first principal component corresponds to the largest eigenvalue (位1 = 1.99) and its corresponding eigenvector (v1 = [0.71, -0.03, 0.71]).\n\nStep 5: Calculate the percentage of the total variance explained by the first principal component\n\nThe total variance is the sum of all eigenvalues: 1.99 + 0.99 + 0.02 = 3.00\nThe percentage of the total variance explained by the first principal component is (1.99 / 3.00) * 100 = 66.33%\n\nThus, the first principal component explains 66.33% of the total variance in the data."
