    "message_1": "A student is standing 30 meters away from a tall building. If the student looks up at an angle of elevation of 60 degrees, what is the height of the building to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the student to the building (30 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (which we want to find).\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 30\n\nTo find the height, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nheight = 30 * tan(60°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 60 degrees:\n\ntan(60°) ≈ 1.732\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nheight ≈ 30 * 1.732\n\nheight ≈ 51.96\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the building is approximately 52 meters."
