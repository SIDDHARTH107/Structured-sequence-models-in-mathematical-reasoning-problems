    "message_2": "The dragon curve algorithm involves replacing a line segment with two segments of the same length, connected at a 90-degree angle. After each iteration, the total length of the curve increases by a factor of the square root of 2.\n\nLet's calculate the total length after the third iteration:\n\n1st iteration: Length = 1 * (√2) = √2\n2nd iteration: Length = √2 * (√2) = 2\n3rd iteration: Length = 2 * (√2) = 2√2\n\nSo, the total length of the resulting curve after the third iteration is 2√2."
