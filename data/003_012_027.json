    "message_1": "A cliff is located 200 meters away from the observer. If the angle of elevation from the observer's eye to the top of the cliff is 45 degrees, what is the height of the cliff? Round your answer to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the cliff, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and the distance from the observer to the cliff is 200 meters.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(45Â°) = height / 200\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = height / 200\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 200 * 1\nheight = 200 meters\n\nSo, the height of the cliff is approximately 200 meters."
