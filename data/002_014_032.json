    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 4 cm.  What is the surface area of the prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to calculate the area of each face and then add them together. There are 6 faces in total: 2 pairs of opposite faces with equal areas.\n\n1. The area of the front and back faces (length x height): 10 cm * 4 cm = 40 cm². Since there are 2 faces, the total area is 40 cm² * 2 = 80 cm².\n\n2. The area of the top and bottom faces (length x width): 10 cm * 6 cm = 60 cm². Since there are 2 faces, the total area is 60 cm² * 2 = 120 cm².\n\n3. The area of the left and right faces (width x height): 6 cm * 4 cm = 24 cm². Since there are 2 faces, the total area is 24 cm² * 2 = 48 cm².\n\nNow, add the areas of all the faces together: 80 cm² + 120 cm² + 48 cm² = 248 cm².\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 248 cm²."
