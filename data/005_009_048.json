Test the hypothesis at 5% significance level that the proportion of students preferring tea is equal to the proportion of students preferring coffee, using the chi-square goodness of fit test.",
    "message_2": "To test the hypothesis that the proportion of students preferring tea is equal to the proportion of students preferring coffee, we will use the chi-square goodness of fit test. \n\nStep 1: State the null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1)\nH0: The proportion of students preferring tea is equal to the proportion of students preferring coffee.\nH1: The proportion of students preferring tea is not equal to the proportion of students preferring coffee.\n\nStep 2: Determine the expected frequencies\nSince we are testing if the proportions are equal, we expect the same number of students to prefer tea and coffee. The total number of students preferring tea or coffee is 25 + 35 = 60. So, we expect 30 students to prefer tea and 30 students to prefer coffee.\n\nExpected frequencies:\nTea: 30\nCoffee: 30\nNeither: 40 (This remains the same as it is not part of the hypothesis)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the chi-square test statistic\nThe formula for the chi-square test statistic is:\nχ² = Σ [(O - E)² / E]\nwhere O is the observed frequency and E is the expected frequency.\n\nFor tea:\nχ²_tea = (25 - 30)² / 30 = 25 / 30\n\nFor coffee:\nχ²_coffee = (35 - 30)² / 30 = 25 / 30\n\nTotal χ² = χ²_tea + χ²_coffee = 25/30 + 25/30 = 50/30 = 5/3\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value\nThe chi-square distribution table is used to find the critical value. In this case, we have 1 degree of freedom (df = number of categories - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1) and a 5% significance level. \n\nLooking at the chi-square distribution table, the critical value for df = 1 and α = 0.05 is 3.841.\n\nStep 5: Compare the test statistic to the critical value\nOur test statistic (5/3 = 1.67) is less than the critical value (3.841). \n\nStep 6: Conclusion\nSince the test statistic (1.67) is less than the critical value (3.841), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of students preferring tea is not equal to the proportion of students preferring coffee at a 5% significance level."
