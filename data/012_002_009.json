    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph G, we can use the greedy coloring algorithm. We will color the vertices one by one, assigning the smallest available color that is not used by any of its adjacent vertices.\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color 1.\n2. Vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 1, so we color it with color 2.\n3. Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 2, so we color it with color 1.\n4. Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 3, so we color it with color 2.\n5. Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 1 and 4, so we color it with color 3.\n6. Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertices 1, 2, and 7, so we color it with color 3.\n7. Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertices 5 and 6, so we color it with color 1.\n\nThe resulting coloring is:\n\n1. Vertex 1: color 1\n2. Vertex 2: color 2\n3. Vertex 3: color 1\n4. Vertex 4: color 2\n5. Vertex 5: color 3\n6. Vertex 6: color 3\n7. Vertex 7: color 1\n\nWe used 3 colors in this coloring, and we can verify that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph G is 3."
