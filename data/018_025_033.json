    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Determine the symmetric difference of A and B, then find the intersection of A and the symmetric difference of B and A. Show that the result obtained is not equal to the intersection of B and the symmetric difference of A and B, hence proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted by A Δ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and the symmetric difference of B and A.\n\nA ∩ (A Δ B) = {1, 2, 3} ∩ {1, 4} = {1}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of B and the symmetric difference of A and B.\n\nB ∩ (A Δ B) = {2, 3, 4} ∩ {1, 4} = {4}\n\nAs we can see, the result obtained for A ∩ (A Δ B) is not equal to the result obtained for B ∩ (A Δ B). Specifically, we have:\n\nA ∩ (A Δ B) = {1} ≠ {4} = B ∩ (A Δ B)\n\nThis shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
