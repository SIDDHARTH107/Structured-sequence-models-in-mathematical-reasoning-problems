    "message_2": "Let g be a generator of G, so G = ⟨g⟩ and |G| = 16. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup H of G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of H are 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.\n\nNow, let's find the cyclic generator of H for each possible order:\n\n1. If |H| = 1, then H = {e}, where e is the identity element. In this case, the cyclic generator of H is e.\n\n2. If |H| = 2, then H = ⟨g^8⟩, since g^8 has order 2. In this case, the cyclic generator of H is g^8.\n\n3. If |H| = 4, then H = ⟨g^4⟩, since g^4 has order 4. In this case, the cyclic generator of H is g^4.\n\n4. If |H| = 8, then H = ⟨g^2⟩, since g^2 has order 8. In this case, the cyclic generator of H is g^2.\n\n5. If |H| = 16, then H = G = ⟨g⟩, since g has order 16. In this case, the cyclic generator of H is g.\n\nIn summary, the cyclic generator of H depends on the order of H and can be e, g^8, g^4, g^2, or g."
