    "message_1": "A researcher wants to test a new fertilizer on tomato plants to see if it will increase their yield. She sets up an experiment where she randomly selects 20 tomato plants and applies the new fertilizer to 10 of them, while leaving the other 10 without any fertilizer. After harvesting the tomatoes, the researcher discovers that the average yield of the 10 plants treated with the new fertilizer was 6.2 pounds, while the average yield of the 10 plants without fertilizer was 4.9 pounds. Can the researcher conclude, with 95% confidence, that the new fertilizer results in a higher tomato yield? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the researcher can conclude with 95% confidence that the new fertilizer results in a higher tomato yield, we will perform a two-sample t-test. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the sample means and standard deviations for both groups:\n\nGroup 1 (fertilizer): \nSample size (n1) = 10\nSample mean (x̄1) = 6.2 pounds\n\nGroup 2 (no fertilizer): \nSample size (n2) = 10\nSample mean (x̄2) = 4.9 pounds\n\nLet's assume the researcher has also provided the standard deviations for both groups:\n\nGroup 1 (fertilizer): \nStandard deviation (s1) = a\n\nGroup 2 (no fertilizer): \nStandard deviation (s2) = b\n\nNow, we will calculate the t-statistic using the formula:\n\nt = (x̄1 - x̄2) / √((s1^2/n1) + (s2^2/n2))\n\nWe will then compare the calculated t-statistic to the critical t-value for a 95% confidence level and a significance level of 0.05. Since we have two groups with 10 samples each, the degrees of freedom (df) for this t-test will be (n1 - 1) + (n2 - 1) = 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nUsing a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value for a one-tailed test with 18 degrees of freedom and a 0.05 significance level to be approximately 1.734.\n\nIf the calculated t-statistic is greater than the critical t-value (1.734), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude with 95% confidence that the new fertilizer results in a higher tomato yield.\n\nHowever, without the standard deviations (a and b) for both groups, we cannot calculate the t-statistic and make a conclusion. The researcher needs to provide the standard deviations for both groups to proceed with the analysis."
