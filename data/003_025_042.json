    "message_1": "A boat is moving southward at a speed of 20 km/hr, and the current is flowing towards east at a speed of 15 km/hr. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity of the boat. Round the answer to the nearest tenth.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity of the boat, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and the tangent function.\n\nLet Vb represent the velocity of the boat (20 km/hr) and Vc represent the velocity of the current (15 km/hr). The magnitude of the resultant velocity (Vr) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nVr = √(Vb^2 + Vc^2)\nVr = √((20 km/hr)^2 + (15 km/hr)^2)\nVr = √(400 + 225)\nVr = √625\nVr ≈ 25 km/hr\n\nNow, to find the direction of the resultant velocity, we can use the tangent function:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite/adjacent\ntan(θ) = Vc/Vb\ntan(θ) = 15/20\ntan(θ) = 0.75\n\nθ = arctan(0.75)\nθ ≈ 36.9°\n\nSince the boat is moving southward and the current is flowing eastward, the direction of the resultant velocity is southeast. The angle is measured counterclockwise from the south direction, so the direction is:\n\nDirection = 180° - 36.9°\nDirection ≈ 143.1° (measured counterclockwise from the east direction)\n\nSo, the magnitude of the resultant velocity of the boat is approximately 25 km/hr, and its direction is approximately 143.1° (southeast)."
