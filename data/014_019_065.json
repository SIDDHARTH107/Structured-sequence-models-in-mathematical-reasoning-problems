    "message_1": "A message was encrypted using a transposition cipher that uses a permutation of length 6. The message consists of 36 letters. After encryption, the length of the ciphertext is 42. What is the maximum number of possible permutation keys that could have been used to encrypt the message using the transposition cipher?",
    "message_2": "A transposition cipher that uses a permutation of length 6 means that the message is divided into blocks of 6 letters each, and the letters within each block are rearranged according to a specific permutation key. Since the message consists of 36 letters, there are 36/6 = 6 blocks of letters.\n\nAfter encryption, the length of the ciphertext is 42, which means that 42 - 36 = 6 extra characters were added during the encryption process. These extra characters could be padding characters added to the last block to make it a complete block of 6 characters.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of possible permutation keys that could have been used to encrypt the message. Since there are 6 positions in each block, there are 6! (6 factorial) possible permutations of these positions. Therefore, there are 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720 possible permutation keys that could have been used to encrypt the message using the transposition cipher."
