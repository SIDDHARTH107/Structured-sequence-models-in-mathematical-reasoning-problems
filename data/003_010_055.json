    "message_1": "An observer standing 30 meters away from the base of a building measures the angle of elevation to the top of the building as 45 degrees. What is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and the distance from the observer to the base of the building is 30 meters. We can represent the height of the building as the side opposite the angle (opposite side) and the distance from the observer to the base of the building as the side adjacent to the angle (adjacent side).\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(45Â°) = opposite side / adjacent side\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = opposite side / 30 meters\n\nTo find the height of the building (opposite side), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 30 meters:\n\nopposite side = 1 * 30 meters\nopposite side = 30 meters\n\nTherefore, the height of the building is 30 meters."
