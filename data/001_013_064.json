    "message_2": "To solve for $x$, we first square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n\n$(\\sqrt{2x+5})^2 = 7^2$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$2x+5 = 49$\n\nNow, we subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n$2x = 44$\n\nFinally, we divide by 2:\n\n$x = 22$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ is 22."
