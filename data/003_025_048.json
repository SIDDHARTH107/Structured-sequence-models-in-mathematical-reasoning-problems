    "message_2": "To determine the north and east components of the airplane's velocity, we can use the trigonometric functions sine and cosine. The north component (vertical) is given by the sine of the angle, while the east component (horizontal) is given by the cosine of the angle.\n\nGiven:\nSpeed (v) = 500 km/hr\nBearing (angle) = 60 degrees\n\nNorth component (v_north) = v × sin(angle)\nEast component (v_east) = v × cos(angle)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\nangle (in radians) = (60 × π) / 180 = π / 3\n\nNow, we can calculate the north and east components:\n\nv_north = 500 × sin(π / 3) = 500 × (√3 / 2) = 250√3 ≈ 433.01 km/hr\nv_east = 500 × cos(π / 3) = 500 × (1 / 2) = 250 km/hr\n\nSo, the north component of the airplane's velocity is approximately 433.01 km/hr, and the east component is 250 km/hr."
