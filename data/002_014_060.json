    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, width of 8 cm and height of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: top, bottom, front, back, left, and right.\n\n1. Top and bottom faces: Both are rectangles with dimensions 6 cm (length) and 8 cm (width). \nArea of top face = Area of bottom face = length × width = 6 × 8 = 48 cm²\nTotal area of top and bottom faces = 2 × 48 = 96 cm²\n\n2. Front and back faces: Both are rectangles with dimensions 6 cm (length) and 4 cm (height).\nArea of front face = Area of back face = length × height = 6 × 4 = 24 cm²\nTotal area of front and back faces = 2 × 24 = 48 cm²\n\n3. Left and right faces: Both are rectangles with dimensions 8 cm (width) and 4 cm (height).\nArea of left face = Area of right face = width × height = 8 × 4 = 32 cm²\nTotal area of left and right faces = 2 × 32 = 64 cm²\n\nNow, we add the total areas of all the faces together:\nSurface area = 96 cm² (top and bottom) + 48 cm² (front and back) + 64 cm² (left and right) = 208 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 208 cm²."
