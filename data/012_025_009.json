    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. In this graph, there is no Hamiltonian cycle. Here's why:\n\nConsider the vertices 1, 3, and 5. In any Hamiltonian cycle, each of these vertices must be visited exactly once. Since vertices 1 and 3 are only connected to vertex 2, and vertices 3 and 5 are only connected to vertex 4, any Hamiltonian cycle must pass through vertices 2 and 4.\n\nHowever, if we visit vertices 2 and 4, we cannot visit vertex 6 without breaking the cycle. This is because vertex 6 has a degree of 3, and in a Hamiltonian cycle, we can only enter and exit a vertex once. If we enter vertex 6 from vertex 4, we must exit to vertex 7, and then we cannot return to vertex 6 to complete the cycle.\n\nTherefore, there is no Hamiltonian cycle in this graph."
