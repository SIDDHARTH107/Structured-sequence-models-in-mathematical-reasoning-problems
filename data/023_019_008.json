    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system using Fourier analysis, we first need to find the general solution of the given differential equation. The given equation is a homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients:\n\ny'' + 4y = 0\n\nWe can solve this equation by assuming a solution of the form y(t) = e^(rt), where r is a constant. Substituting this into the differential equation, we get:\n\n(r^2 + 4)e^(rt) = 0\n\nSince e^(rt) is never zero, we can divide both sides by e^(rt) and obtain the characteristic equation:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = Â±2i\n\nSo, the general solution of the differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = C1 * cos(2t) + C2 * sin(2t)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants C1 and C2 using the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 2 => C1 * cos(0) + C2 * sin(0) = 2 => C1 = 2\n\ny'(t) = -2C1 * sin(2t) + 2C2 * cos(2t)\n\ny'(0) = 1 => -2C1 * sin(0) + 2C2 * cos(0) = 1 => C2 = 1/2\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\ny(t) = 2 * cos(2t) + (1/2) * sin(2t)\n\nNow, we analyze the stability of the system. A system is stable if its solutions do not grow unbounded as time goes to infinity. In this case, both the cosine and sine functions are bounded between -1 and 1, and their coefficients (2 and 1/2) are constants. Therefore, the solution y(t) will also be bounded and not grow unbounded as time goes to infinity.\n\nHence, the system is stable."
