    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4, we will first analyze the possible structures of G based on its order and then construct explicit isomorphisms between G and each of these groups.\n\nSince G is a group of order 8, by the Sylow theorems, it must have a subgroup of order 2. Let's denote this subgroup as H. There are three cases to consider:\n\n1. G has an element of order 8.\n2. G has an element of order 4 but no element of order 8.\n3. G has no elements of order 4 or 8.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 8.\nIn this case, G is a cyclic group generated by this element, and G is isomorphic to C8.\n\nCase 2: G has an element of order 4 but no element of order 8.\nLet x be an element of order 4 in G, so x^4 = e (identity element). Since G has order 8, there must be another element y in G that is not in the subgroup generated by x. We know that y^2 is in H, so y^2 = h for some h in H. Since h has order 2, we have (y^2)^2 = h^2 = e, which implies y^4 = e.\n\nNow, consider the element z = xy. We have z^2 = (xy)^2 = xyxy. Since x and y have order 4, we can rewrite this as z^2 = x^3yx^3y. We know that x^3 is the inverse of x, so z^2 = (x^3x)y(x^3x)y = eyey = y^2. Since y^2 is in H and has order 2, z^2 also has order 2.\n\nThus, G has the following presentation: G = {e, x, x^2, x^3, y, z, yz, x^2z} with x^4 = y^4 = z^2 = e and yx = x^3y. This is the presentation of the dihedral group D4, so G is isomorphic to D4.\n\nCase 3: G has no elements of order 4 or 8.\nIn this case, every non-identity element in G has order 2. Let x, y, z be three distinct non-identity elements in G. Since G has order 8, there must be another element w in G that is not in the subgroup generated by x, y, and z. We know that w^2 = e.\n\nNow, consider the element xy. Since x and y have order 2, we have (xy)^2 = x^2y^2 = e. Similarly, we can show that (xz)^2 = (yz)^2 = e. Thus, G has the following presentation: G = {e, x, y, z, w, xy, xz, yz} with x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = w^2 = (xy)^2 = (xz)^2 = (yz)^2 = e. This is the presentation of the quaternion group Q8, so G is isomorphic to Q8.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that a group G of order 8 must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, the dihedral group D4, or the quaternion group Q8."
