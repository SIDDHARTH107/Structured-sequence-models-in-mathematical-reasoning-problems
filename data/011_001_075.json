    "message_1": "How many ways can 4 students be chosen out of a class of 20 students to represent their school in a mathematics competition if only 3 of them can be chosen?",
    "message_2": "It seems there is a contradiction in the problem statement. If you want to choose 3 students out of 20, then the number of ways to do that is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (20 in this case) and k is the number of students to be chosen (3 in this case).\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3! * (20-3)!)\n= 20! / (3! * 17!)\n= (20 * 19 * 18) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n= 1140\n\nSo there are 1140 ways to choose 3 students out of a class of 20 students."
