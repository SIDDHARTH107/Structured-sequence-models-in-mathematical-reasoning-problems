    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. We are given the surface in cylindrical coordinates, so we will first find the parametric representation of the surface in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nGiven r = 2cos(θ) and z = 3sin(θ), we can express the Cartesian coordinates as follows:\n\nx = rcos(θ) = (2cos(θ))cos(θ) = 2cos^2(θ)\ny = rsin(θ) = (2cos(θ))sin(θ) = 2cos(θ)sin(θ)\nz = 3sin(θ)\n\nNow, we will find the partial derivatives of x, y, and z with respect to r and θ:\n\n∂x/∂r = 0\n∂x/∂θ = -4cos(θ)sin(θ)\n∂y/∂r = 0\n∂y/∂θ = 2cos^2(θ) - 2sin^2(θ)\n∂z/∂r = 0\n∂z/∂θ = 3cos(θ)\n\nNow, we will find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = (∂x/∂r)^2 + (∂y/∂r)^2 + (∂z/∂r)^2 = 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 0\nF = (∂x/∂r)(∂x/∂θ) + (∂y/∂r)(∂y/∂θ) + (∂z/∂r)(∂z/∂θ) = 0\nG = (∂x/∂θ)^2 + (∂y/∂θ)^2 + (∂z/∂θ)^2 = (-4cos(θ)sin(θ))^2 + (2cos^2(θ) - 2sin^2(θ))^2 + (3cos(θ))^2\n\nNow, we will find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = (∂^2x/∂r^2)(N) + (∂^2y/∂r^2)(N) + (∂^2z/∂r^2)(N) = 0\nM = (∂^2x/∂r∂θ)(N) + (∂^2y/∂r∂θ)(N) + (∂^2z/∂r∂θ)(N) = 0\nN = (∂^2x/∂θ^2)(N) + (∂^2y/∂θ^2)(N) + (∂^2z/∂θ^2)(N) = (8cos^2(θ)sin^2(θ) - 8cos^2(θ)sin^2(θ))(N) + (-12cos^2(θ)sin^2(θ) - 12cos^2(θ)sin^2(θ))(N) + (-9sin^2(θ))(N)\n\nNow, we will find the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2) = (0) / (G) = 0\n\nThe Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point (1, π/4, 3/√10) is 0."
