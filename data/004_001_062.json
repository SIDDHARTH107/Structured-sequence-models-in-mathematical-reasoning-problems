    "message_2": "To find the instantaneous velocity of the object at time t=4 seconds, we need to find the derivative of the displacement function f(x) with respect to time (x) and then evaluate it at x=4.\n\nThe displacement function is f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 1.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2 + 3x + 1)/dx = 4x + 3\n\nNow, we'll evaluate f'(x) at x=4:\n\nf'(4) = 4(4) + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19\n\nSo, the instantaneous velocity of the object at time t=4 seconds is 19 units per second."
