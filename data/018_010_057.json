    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of A and B. The union of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both.\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nTo verify that the Cartesian product of A and B is distributive over the union of A and B, we need to show that (A ∪ B) x C = (A x C) ∪ (B x C) for some set C.\n\nLet's choose C = {5}. Now, let's compute the Cartesian products and unions.\n\n(A ∪ B) x C = ({1, 2, 3, 4} x {5}) = {(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)}\n\nA x C = ({2, 3} x {5}) = {(2, 5), (3, 5)}\n\nB x C = ({1, 4} x {5}) = {(1, 5), (4, 5)}\n\n(A x C) ∪ (B x C) = {(2, 5), (3, 5)} ∪ {(1, 5), (4, 5)} = {(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)}\n\nSince (A ∪ B) x C = (A x C) ∪ (B x C), the Cartesian product of A and B is distributive over the union of A and B."
