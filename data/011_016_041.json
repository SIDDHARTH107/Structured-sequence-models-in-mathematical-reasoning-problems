    "message_2": "First, let's consider the groups of 3 books by each author as a single unit. We have 5 units (one for each author) that we need to arrange on the shelf. There are 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange these 5 units.\n\nNow, within each unit, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the 3 books by the same author. Since there are 5 units, we have a total of (3!)^5 ways to arrange the books within the units.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 15 books on the shelf such that there are exactly 3 books by each author next to each other is:\n\n5! × (3!)^5 = 120 × (6)^5 = 120 × 7776 = 933120"
