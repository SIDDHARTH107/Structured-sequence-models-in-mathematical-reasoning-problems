    "message_2": "The length of the Hilbert curve can be calculated using the formula L = N * S, where L is the length of the curve, N is the number of segments, and S is the length of each segment.\n\nIn each iteration, the number of segments in the Hilbert curve is multiplied by 4. So, for the 4th iteration, the number of segments will be:\n\nN = 4^(4) = 256\n\nSince each segment length is equal to 1, the length of the Hilbert curve in the 4th iteration will be:\n\nL = N * S = 256 * 1 = 256\n\nSo, the length of the Hilbert curve in the 4th iteration is 256."
