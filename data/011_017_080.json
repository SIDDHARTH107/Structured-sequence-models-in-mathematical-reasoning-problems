    "message_2": "There are 12 distinct 3x3 Latin squares possible.\n\nTo see why, let's fill in the Latin square row by row:\n\n1. For the first row, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the numbers 1, 2, and 3, which is 6 ways.\n2. For the second row, there are 2 possible ways to arrange the numbers, since the first number in the second row is determined by the first row, and then there are 2 options left for the second number in the second row, and the third number is determined.\n3. For the third row, there is only 1 way to arrange the numbers, since they are determined by the first two rows.\n\nSo, there are 6 ways for the first row * 2 ways for the second row * 1 way for the third row = 12 distinct 3x3 Latin squares."
