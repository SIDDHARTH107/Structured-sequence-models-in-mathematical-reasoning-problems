    "message_1": "A factory produces 5000 pencils every day. The probability of a pencil being defective is 0.02. What is the probability that in a given day, at least 100 pencils will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective pencils, n is the total number of pencils produced (5000), k is the number of defective pencils, p is the probability of a pencil being defective (0.02), and nCk is the number of combinations of choosing k defective pencils from n total pencils.\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of having at least 100 defective pencils, which means we need to find the probability of having 100, 101, 102, ..., up to 5000 defective pencils. To do this, we can find the complement probability, which is the probability of having less than 100 defective pencils, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, we want to find:\n\nP(X >= 100) = 1 - P(X < 100) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 99)]\n\nCalculating each of these probabilities individually would be very time-consuming, so we can use a cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the binomial distribution to find the sum of these probabilities more efficiently. Many statistical software packages and calculators have built-in functions to calculate the CDF of a binomial distribution.\n\nUsing a binomial CDF calculator or software, we can find:\n\nP(X < 100) ≈ 0.0144\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least 100 defective pencils:\n\nP(X >= 100) = 1 - P(X < 100) = 1 - 0.0144 ≈ 0.9856\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 100 defective pencils in a given day is approximately 0.9856, or 98.56%."
