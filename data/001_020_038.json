    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the graph, we need to find the x-coordinate that makes the expression inside the absolute value equal to zero. So, we set the expression inside the absolute value to zero:\n\n5x + 2 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n5x = -2\nx = -2/5\n\nSo, the x-coordinate of the vertex is -2/5. To find the corresponding y-coordinate, we plug this value back into the equation:\n\ny = |5(-2/5) + 2|\ny = |-2 + 2|\ny = |0|\n\nThe y-coordinate of the vertex is 0. Therefore, the vertex of the graph is (-2/5, 0).\n\nTo find the x-intercepts, we need to find the x-values that make y equal to zero:\n\n0 = |5x + 2|\n\nThis occurs when the expression inside the absolute value is equal to zero or its negative:\n\n5x + 2 = 0 (as we already found above)\nx = -2/5\n\nor\n\n5x + 2 = -(5x + 2)\n10x = -2\nx = -1/5\n\nSo, there are two x-intercepts: (-2/5, 0) and (-1/5, 0)."
