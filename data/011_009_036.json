    "message_2": "To form a committee with an odd number of members, the company can either form a committee of 3, 5, 7, or 9 employees. We will use the combination formula to find the number of ways to form a committee of each size, and then add them together.\n\nThe combination formula is: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nFor a committee of 3 employees:\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!(9-3)!) = 9! / (3!6!) = 84 ways\n\nFor a committee of 5 employees:\nC(9, 5) = 9! / (5!(9-5)!) = 9! / (5!4!) = 126 ways\n\nFor a committee of 7 employees:\nC(9, 7) = 9! / (7!(9-7)!) = 9! / (7!2!) = 36 ways\n\nFor a committee of 9 employees:\nC(9, 9) = 9! / (9!(9-9)!) = 9! / (9!0!) = 1 way\n\nNow, we add the number of ways for each committee size together:\n\n84 + 126 + 36 + 1 = 247 ways\n\nSo, there are 247 ways to form a committee with an odd number of members."
