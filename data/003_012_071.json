    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall. The bottom of the ladder is 6 feet away from the wall, and the ladder reaches a height of 8 feet on the wall. What is the angle of elevation of the ladder? Round your answer to the nearest degree.",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of elevation of the ladder, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the side opposite the angle is the height of the ladder on the wall (8 feet), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall (6 feet).\n\ntan(angle) = opposite/adjacent\ntan(angle) = 8/6\ntan(angle) = 4/3\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse tangent (arctangent) of 4/3 to find the angle:\n\nangle = arctan(4/3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nangle â‰ˆ 53.13 degrees\n\nRounding to the nearest degree, the angle of elevation of the ladder is approximately 53 degrees."
