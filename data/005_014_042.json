    "message_2": "To calculate the total variance explained by these four factors, we need to sum up the eigenvalues and divide by the total number of variables. \n\nEigenvalues: 6.2, 4.8, 2.5, 1.3\nTotal number of variables: 10\n\nStep 1: Sum up the eigenvalues\n6.2 + 4.8 + 2.5 + 1.3 = 14.8\n\nStep 2: Divide the sum of eigenvalues by the total number of variables\n14.8 / 10 = 1.48\n\nThe total variance explained by these four factors is 1.48."
