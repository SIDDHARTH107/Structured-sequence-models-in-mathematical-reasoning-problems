    "message_2": "To compute the Poincaré dual class of [H_i] for each 1 ≤ i ≤ r, we first need to understand the relationship between the homology and cohomology of M and the hypersurfaces H_i. Recall that the Poincaré dual of a homology class in H_k(M) is a cohomology class in H^{n-k}(M), where n is the dimension of M.\n\nSince H_i is a hypersurface in M, it has codimension 1, which means that its dimension is n-1. Let [H_i] be the homology class of H_i in H_{n-1}(M). We want to find the Poincaré dual class of [H_i] in H^{1}(M).\n\nConsider the short exact sequence of the pair (M, H_i):\n\n0 → H_{n-1}(H_i) → H_{n-1}(M) → H_{n-1}(M, H_i) → 0\n\nBy the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology, we have the following short exact sequence:\n\n0 → Hom(H_{n-1}(M), Z) → H^{1}(M) → Ext(H_{n-2}(M), Z) → 0\n\nSince M is a closed, orientable manifold, its top homology group H_n(M) is isomorphic to Z, and all other homology groups are finitely generated. Therefore, the Ext term in the above sequence is trivial, and we have an isomorphism:\n\nH^{1}(M) ≅ Hom(H_{n-1}(M), Z)\n\nNow, we can compute the Poincaré dual class of [H_i] by finding the corresponding element in H^{1}(M) under this isomorphism. Let φ_i be the homomorphism in Hom(H_{n-1}(M), Z) corresponding to [H_i]. Then, the Poincaré dual class of [H_i] is the cohomology class represented by φ_i.\n\nIn summary, to compute the Poincaré dual class of [H_i] for each 1 ≤ i ≤ r, we find the corresponding homomorphism φ_i in Hom(H_{n-1}(M), Z) under the isomorphism H^{1}(M) ≅ Hom(H_{n-1}(M), Z), and the Poincaré dual class is the cohomology class represented by φ_i."
