    "message_2": "(a) To find the Fourier Transform of x(t), we first need to express the given signal in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (e^(jθ) + e^(-jθ)) / 2\nsin(θ) = (e^(jθ) - e^(-jθ)) / 2j\n\nSo, x(t) can be rewritten as:\n\nx(t) = [e^(j5πt) + e^(-j5πt)] + 3[e^(j9πt) + e^(-j9πt)]/2 + [e^(j2πt) - e^(-j2πt)]/2j\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier Transform X(ω) of x(t) using the following formula:\n\nX(ω) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nBy plugging in the complex exponential form of x(t) and calculating the integral, we get:\n\nX(ω) = π[2δ(ω - 5π) + 2δ(ω + 5π) + 3δ(ω - 9π) + 3δ(ω + 9π) - jδ(ω - 2π) + jδ(ω + 2π)]\n\n(b) To plot the magnitude and phase spectra of the signal x(t), we need to find the magnitude and phase of X(ω):\n\nMagnitude: |X(ω)| = π[2δ(ω - 5π) + 2δ(ω + 5π) + 3δ(ω - 9π) + 3δ(ω + 9π) + δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)]\n\nPhase: ∠X(ω) = -π/2 * [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)]\n\nThe magnitude spectrum consists of spikes at ω = ±2π, ±5π, and ±9π, with corresponding magnitudes of π, 2π, and 3π. The phase spectrum has a phase shift of -π/2 at ω = ±2π.\n\n(c) The fundamental frequency of the signal x(t) can be found by determining the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the frequencies present in the signal:\n\nf1 = 5π/2π = 2.5 Hz\nf2 = 9π/2π = 4.5 Hz\nf3 = 2π/2π = 1 Hz\n\nThe GCD of 2.5, 4.5, and 1 is 0.5 Hz. Therefore, the fundamental frequency of the signal x(t) is 0.5 Hz."
