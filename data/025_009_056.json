    "message_2": "To determine the number of automorphisms of the curve $\\mathcal{C}$, we first need to understand the structure of the curve. Since $\\mathcal{C}$ has a $g_2^1$, it has a degree 2 map to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$. This means that $\\mathcal{C}$ is a double cover of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ branched at 4 points. \n\nNow, let's consider the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, which relates the genus of a covering curve to the genus of the base curve and the ramification points. The formula is given by:\n\n$2g_\\mathcal{C} - 2 = d(2g_{\\mathbb{P}^1} - 2) + \\sum_{i=1}^n (e_i - 1)$,\n\nwhere $g_\\mathcal{C}$ is the genus of the curve $\\mathcal{C}$, $g_{\\mathbb{P}^1}$ is the genus of the base curve $\\mathbb{P}^1$, $d$ is the degree of the covering map, $n$ is the number of ramification points, and $e_i$ is the ramification index at each point.\n\nIn our case, $g_\\mathcal{C} = 3$, $g_{\\mathbb{P}^1} = 0$, $d = 2$, and there are 4 ramification points. Since the covering is a double cover, the ramification index at each point is 2. Plugging these values into the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, we get:\n\n$2(3) - 2 = 2(2(0) - 2) + 4(2 - 1)$,\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n$4 = -4 + 4$.\n\nThis equation is satisfied, so our curve $\\mathcal{C}$ is indeed a double cover of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ branched at 4 points.\n\nNow, let's consider the automorphisms of $\\mathcal{C}$. An automorphism of $\\mathcal{C}$ induces an automorphism of the base curve $\\mathbb{P}^1$. The automorphism group of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ is PGL(2, $\\mathbb{C}$), which has order 6. However, not all of these automorphisms lift to automorphisms of $\\mathcal{C}$. In fact, only the identity and the hyperelliptic involution (which swaps the sheets of the double cover) lift to automorphisms of $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nTherefore, the number of automorphisms of the curve $\\mathcal{C}$ is 2."
