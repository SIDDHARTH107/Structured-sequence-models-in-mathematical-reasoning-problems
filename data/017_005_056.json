    "message_2": "The statement \"where 27 is a prime\" is incorrect, as 27 is not a prime number. 27 is a composite number, as it can be factored into 3^3. \n\nNow, considering the correct question: \"What is the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 27?\"\n\nUsing the Sylow theorems and the fact that 27 = 3^3, we can determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 27. There are three such groups:\n\n1. The cyclic group of order 27, denoted as C_27 or Z_27.\n2. The direct product of Z_9 and Z_3, denoted as Z_9 x Z_3.\n3. The Heisenberg group of order 27, which is a non-abelian group.\n\nSo, there are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 27."
