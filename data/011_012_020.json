    "message_2": "Let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.\n\nTotal number of students = Number of students taking math + Number of students taking science - Number of students taking both math and science\n\nTotal number of students = 40\n\nNumber of students taking math = 25\n\nNumber of students taking science = 20\n\nNumber of students taking both math and science = 15\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the formula:\n\n40 = 25 + 20 - 15\n\n40 = 30\n\nSo, there are 10 students who take neither math nor science."
