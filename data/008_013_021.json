    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the given matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. The matrix A and the vector b are as follows:\n\nA = | 1  1  1 |       b = |  6  |\n    | 2  3  4 |           | 20  |\n    | 4  5  6 |           | 37  |\n\nStep 1: LU Decomposition\nPerform Gaussian elimination to obtain the U matrix:\n\nFirst, eliminate the first element in the second and third rows:\n\nA = | 1  1   1 |       L = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 0  1   2 |           | 2  1  0 |\n    | 0  1   2 |           | 4  0  1 |\n\nNext, eliminate the second element in the third row:\n\nA = | 1  1   1 |       L = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 0  1   2 |           | 2  1  0 |\n    | 0  0  -1 |           | 4  1  1 |\n\nNow, we have the L and U matrices:\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 2  1  0 |\n    | 4  1  1 |\n\nU = | 1  1   1 |\n    | 0  1   2 |\n    | 0  0  -1 |\n\nStep 2: Solve the equation Ly = b for y:\n\n| 1  0  0 | | y1 |   |  6  |\n| 2  1  0 | | y2 | = | 20  |\n| 4  1  1 | | y3 |   | 37  |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 6\ny2 = 20 - 2 * y1 = 20 - 2 * 6 = 8\ny3 = 37 - 4 * y1 - y2 = 37 - 4 * 6 - 8 = 1\n\nSo, y = | 6 |\n        | 8 |\n        | 1 |\n\nStep 3: Solve the equation Ux = y for x:\n\n| 1  1   1 | | x1 |   |  6  |\n| 0  1   2 | | x2 | = |  8  |\n| 0  0  -1 | | x3 |   |  1  |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx3 = -1 * y3 = -1 * 1 = -1\nx2 = y2 - 2 * x3 = 8 - 2 * (-1) = 10\nx1 = y1 - x2 - x3 = 6 - 10 - (-1) = -3\n\nSo, x = | -3 |\n        | 10 |\n        | -1 |\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is x = -3, y = 10, and z = -1."
