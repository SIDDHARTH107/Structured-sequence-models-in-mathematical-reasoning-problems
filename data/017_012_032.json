    "message_2": "First, let's assume that G has an element of order 16. Let this element be g, so g^16 = e (where e is the identity element of G). Since the order of G is 16, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide 16. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. Since g has order 16, we know that g^k has order 16/gcd(16, k) for any integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 15). Thus, G can be generated by the powers of g, and we have:\n\nG = {e, g, g^2, g^3, ..., g^15}\n\nSince all these elements are distinct, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16.\n\nNow, let's assume that G does not have an element of order 16. Then, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 4, and 8. By Cauchy's theorem, there exists an element of order 2 in G. Let this element be x. Also, there exists an element of order 8 in G. Let this element be y. \n\nConsider the subgroup H generated by y. Since y has order 8, H is a cyclic group of order 8, and isomorphic to C8. Now, G has 16 elements, and H has 8 elements. Since H is a subgroup of G, there are 16/8 = 2 cosets of H in G. Let the other coset be xH. Then, G can be written as the union of these two cosets:\n\nG = H ∪ xH = {e, y, y^2, ..., y^7} ∪ {x, xy, xy^2, ..., xy^7}\n\nNow, we will consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: x^2 = e\nIn this case, we have x^2 = e and y^8 = e. We can verify that the group operation defined by (xy)^2 = x(yx)y = x^2y^2 = y^2 satisfies the dihedral group relations. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8.\n\nCase 2: x^2 ≠ e\nIn this case, x^2 must have order 2 or 4. If x^2 has order 2, then x has order 4, which contradicts our assumption that there is no element of order 16 in G. Therefore, x^2 must have order 4. We can verify that the group operation defined by (xy)^3 = x(yx)(yx)(yx) = x^2y^3 satisfies the non-abelian group of order 16 relations. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nIn conclusion, if G has an element of order 16, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16. Otherwise, G is isomorphic to either the dihedral group D8 or the non-abelian group of order 16."
