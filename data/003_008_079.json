    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the sine function. First, we need to find one of the angles of the triangle. Let's call the base angle A, the opposite angle B, and the right angle C. Since we have a right triangle, we can use the tangent function to find angle A.\n\ntan(A) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(A) = height / base\ntan(A) = 8 cm / 12 cm\ntan(A) = 2/3\n\nNow, we can find angle A by taking the inverse tangent (arctan) of 2/3.\n\nA = arctan(2/3) ≈ 33.69°\n\nNow that we have angle A, we can use the sine function to find the area of the triangle.\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\nArea = (1/2) * 12 cm * 8 cm * sin(33.69°)\n\nWe can now plug in the sine of the angle:\n\nArea ≈ (1/2) * 12 cm * 8 cm * 0.5556\nArea ≈ 26.67 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 26.67 cm²."
