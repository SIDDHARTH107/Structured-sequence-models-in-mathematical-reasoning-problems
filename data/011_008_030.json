    "message_1": "A math student wants to arrange 9 books on a shelf. How many ways are there to arrange the books if the student wants to group them into 3 stacks of books, each with 3 books? (Hint: use Stirling numbers of the second kind)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which are denoted by S(n, k), where n is the number of objects (in this case, books) and k is the number of non-empty sets (in this case, stacks of books) that the objects can be partitioned into.\n\nIn this problem, we have n = 9 books and k = 3 stacks. So, we need to find S(9, 3).\n\nUsing the Stirling numbers of the second kind formula:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe can compute the necessary values:\n\nS(9, 3) = 3 * S(8, 3) + S(8, 2)\n\nTo find S(8, 3) and S(8, 2), we can use the same formula:\n\nS(8, 3) = 3 * S(7, 3) + S(7, 2)\nS(8, 2) = 2 * S(7, 2) + S(7, 1)\n\nContinuing this process, we can compute the required Stirling numbers:\n\nS(7, 3) = 3 * S(6, 3) + S(6, 2)\nS(7, 2) = 2 * S(6, 2) + S(6, 1)\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)\nS(6, 2) = 2 * S(5, 2) + S(5, 1)\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\nS(5, 2) = 2 * S(4, 2) + S(4, 1)\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2)\nS(4, 2) = 2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1)\n\nNow, we can use the base cases:\n\nS(n, 1) = 1 for all n\nS(n, n) = 1 for all n\n\nSo, we have:\n\nS(3, 1) = 1\nS(3, 2) = 3\nS(3, 3) = 1\n\nNow, we can work our way back up:\n\nS(4, 2) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\nS(4, 3) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\nS(5, 2) = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15\nS(5, 3) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\nS(6, 2) = 2 * 15 + 1 = 31\nS(6, 3) = 3 * 25 + 15 = 90\nS(7, 2) = 2 * 31 + 1 = 63\nS(7, 3) = 3 * 90 + 31 = 301\nS(8, 2) = 2 * 63 + 1 = 127\nS(8, 3) = 3 * 301 + 127 = 1030\nS(9, 3) = 3 * 1030 + 127 = 3217\n\nSo, there are 3217 ways to arrange the 9 books into 3 stacks of 3 books each.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the arrangement of books within each stack. Since there are 3 books in each stack, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the books within a stack. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 9 books into 3 stacks of 3 books each, considering the arrangement within each stack, is:\n\n3217 * 6^3 = 3217 * 216 = 694,572 ways."
