    "message_1": "In an ultimatum game, player A proposes to split 100 dollars with player B. If player B accepts the offer, each player gets their agreed-upon share. However, if player B rejects the offer, neither player gets any money. If player A proposes a split of $70 for themselves and $30 for player B, what is the minimum amount player B would have to receive to accept the deal?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot determine the exact minimum amount player B would have to receive to accept the deal, as this depends on the individual preferences and rationality of the players involved. However, I can provide some insights.\n\nIn a purely rational scenario, player B should accept any amount greater than $0, as receiving something is better than receiving nothing. In this case, the minimum amount player B would have to receive to accept the deal would be $1, with player A receiving $99.\n\nHowever, in practice, people often exhibit fairness concerns and may reject offers they perceive as unfair. The minimum amount player B would accept could be higher than $1, depending on their preferences and perception of fairness. For example, they might only accept offers where they receive at least $30, $40, or even $50.\n\nUltimately, the minimum amount player B would have to receive to accept the deal depends on their individual preferences and how they weigh the potential monetary gain against their perception of fairness."
