    "message_1": "A magician has a deck of cards with 52 cards in it. He shuffles the deck and asks a volunteer to select a card at random. What is the probability that the volunteer selects a spade card?",
    "message_2": "There are 13 spade cards in a standard deck of 52 cards. To find the probability of selecting a spade card, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 13 (the number of spade cards) and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (the total number of cards in the deck).\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a spade card is:\n\nProbability = 13/52 = 1/4 or 0.25\n\nThere is a 0.25 or 25% chance that the volunteer selects a spade card."
