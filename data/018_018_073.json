In other words, it consists of the elements that are unique to each set.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nLet's find the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7}\nB = {2, 4, 6}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {} (intersection of A and B, since they have no common elements)\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's show that the symmetric difference is commutative:\n\nA Δ B = B Δ A\n\nWe already found A Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
