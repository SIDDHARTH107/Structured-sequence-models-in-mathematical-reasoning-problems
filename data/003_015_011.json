    "message_1": "Suppose there's a trigonometric function y = 5 sin (2x - π/4). Find the period and amplitude of the function.",
    "message_2": "The given function is y = 5 sin (2x - π/4).\n\nThe amplitude of the function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function, which in this case is 5. So, the amplitude is 5.\n\nTo find the period, we need to look at the coefficient of x inside the sine function. In this case, it's 2. The period of the basic sine function is 2π. To find the period of the given function, we divide the period of the basic sine function by the coefficient of x.\n\nPeriod = (2π) / 2 = π\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function is 5 and the period is π."
