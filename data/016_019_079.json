    "message_2": "A Koch Island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. In each iteration, every side of the triangle is divided into three equal parts, and a smaller equilateral triangle is added in the middle part. This process increases the perimeter of the Koch Island.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the Koch Island after the nth iteration as P_n. The perimeter of the original triangle is P_0 = 9 units.\n\nAfter the first iteration, each side of the triangle is replaced by four segments, each of which is 1/3 the length of the original side. So, the perimeter after the first iteration is P_1 = 4 * (1/3) * P_0 = 4 * (1/3) * 9 = 12 units.\n\nAfter the second iteration, each of the four segments is again replaced by four segments, each of which is 1/3 the length of the previous segment. So, the perimeter after the second iteration is P_2 = 4 * (1/3) * P_1 = 4 * (1/3) * 12 = 16 units.\n\nAfter the third iteration, each of the 16 segments is again replaced by four segments, each of which is 1/3 the length of the previous segment. So, the perimeter after the third iteration is P_3 = 4 * (1/3) * P_2 = 4 * (1/3) * 16 = 64/3 units.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the Koch Island after the 3rd iteration is 64/3 units."
