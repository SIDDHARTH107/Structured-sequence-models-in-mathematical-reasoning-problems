    "message_2": "In linear logic, the \"⊸\" symbol represents the linear implication. The formula A ⊸ (B ⊸ C) can be read as \"A implies (B implies C).\" \n\nGiven that A is true and C is false, we need to find the value of B such that the formula is true.\n\nRecall that an implication is false only when the antecedent (the part before the ⊸) is true, and the consequent (the part after the ⊸) is false. In all other cases, the implication is true.\n\nSince A is true, we need to make sure that (B ⊸ C) is true as well. For this to happen, we have two possibilities:\n\n1. B is false: If B is false, then the implication B ⊸ C is true, regardless of the value of C. In this case, the formula A ⊸ (B ⊸ C) is true.\n\n2. C is true: However, we are given that C is false, so this possibility is not applicable.\n\nTherefore, the value of B that makes the formula A ⊸ (B ⊸ C) true is false."
