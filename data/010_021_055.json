Since $H(x, 0) = f(x)$, we have $dH_x = df_x = 0$. Thus, $X_H(x) = 0$.\n\nLet $D_x X_H: T_x M \\to T_x M$ be the linearization of $X_H$ at $x$. We want to show that $D_x X_H$ has distinct non-zero eigenvalues. To do this, we will compute $D_x X_H$ and analyze its eigenvalues.\n\nBy definition, $D_x X_H$ is the linear map such that for any $v \\in T_x M$,\n$$\nD_x X_H(v) = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{1}{t} (X_H(\\exp_x(tv)) - X_H(x)),\n$$\nwhere $\\exp_x: T_x M \\to M$ is the exponential map at $x$. Since $X_H(x) = 0$, we have\n$$\nD_x X_H(v) = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{1}{t} X_H(\\exp_x(tv)).\n$$\nNow, let $v, w \\in T_x M$ be arbitrary. Then,\n$$\n\\omega(D_x X_H(v), w) = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{1}{t} \\omega(X_H(\\exp_x(tv)), w) = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{1}{t} dH_{\\exp_x(tv)}(w).\n$$\nSince $H(x, 0) = f(x)$ and $x$ is a critical point of $f$, we have $dH_x = df_x = 0$. Thus, by the chain rule,\n$$\ndH_{\\exp_x(tv)}(w) = \\frac{d}{dt} H(\\exp_x(tv), 0) = \\frac{d}{dt} f(\\exp_x(tv)).\n$$\nHence,\n$$\n\\omega(D_x X_H(v), w) = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{1}{t} \\frac{d}{dt} f(\\exp_x(tv)).\n$$\nNow, let $\\gamma(t) = \\exp_x(tv)$. Then, $\\gamma(0) = x$ and $\\gamma'(0) = v$. By the chain rule,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} f(\\exp_x(tv)) = df_{\\gamma(t)}(\\gamma'(t)) = df_{\\gamma(t)}(v).\n$$\nSince $x$ is a non-degenerate critical point of $f$, the Hessian of $f$ at $x$ is non-singular. Thus, there exists a unique symmetric bilinear form $B: T_x M \\times T_x M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n$$\ndf_{\\gamma(t)}(v) = B(v, \\gamma'(t)).\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\omega(D_x X_H(v), w) = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{1}{t} B(v, \\gamma'(t)) = B(v, v).\n$$\nSince $B$ is non-singular, we have $B(v, v) \\neq 0$ for all $v \\neq 0$. Thus, the eigenvalues of $D_x X_H$ are distinct and non-zero."
