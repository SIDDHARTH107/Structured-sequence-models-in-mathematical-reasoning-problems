    "message_2": "The smallest prime factor of 825 can be found by dividing 825 by the smallest prime numbers until we find a factor. \n\n825 รท 2 = 412.5 (not a whole number, so 2 is not a factor)\n\n825 รท 3 = 275 (whole number, so 3 is a factor)\n\nTherefore, the smallest prime factor of 825 is 3."
