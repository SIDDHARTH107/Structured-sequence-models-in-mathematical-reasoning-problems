    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question:\n\nYou are playing a game with your friend where you need to coordinate your actions to get the highest combined payoff. Your friend has two options: A or B. You also have two options: C or D. You both prefer to play C, but you cannot communicate directly. Instead, you can send one message to your friend either saying \"C\" or \"D\". However, your friend may not believe you and may think you are lying. If you both play C, you both get 5 points. If one player plays C and the other plays D, the player who played D gets 7 points and the other gets 1 point. If you both play D, you each get 3 points.\n\nWhat message should you send to your friend to convince them to play C?",
    "message_2": "In this situation, you should send the message \"C\" to your friend. This is because you both prefer to play C, and by sending the message \"C\", you are signaling your intention to play C. However, since there is a possibility that your friend may not believe you and think you are lying, there is no foolproof way to convince them to play C. But sending the message \"C\" is still the best option, as it indicates your preference and intention to play C, which has the highest combined payoff."
