    "message_2": "To find the minimal resolution of the singularity at p on X, we first need to determine if p is a singular point. A point is singular if the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to x and y both vanish at that point.\n\nThe given equation is y^2 = x^2(x+1). Let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 + 2x\n∂f/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, let's evaluate these partial derivatives at the point p = (1,1):\n\n∂f/∂x(1,1) = 3(1)^2 + 2(1) = 5\n∂f/∂y(1,1) = 2(1) = 2\n\nSince neither of the partial derivatives vanish at the point p = (1,1), the point is not a singular point. Therefore, there is no singularity at p on X, and the minimal resolution of the singularity at p on X is just the point itself, p = (1,1)."
