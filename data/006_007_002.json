    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a certain stock dropping in value on a given day is 0.3 (or 30%). If the stock price drops, there is a 60% chance that it will drop by $2, and a 40% chance that it will drop by $5. On the other hand, if the stock price doesn't drop, there is a 70% chance that it will remain unchanged and a 30% chance that it will rise by $3. What is the expected change in stock price on this day?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected change in stock price, we need to multiply the probability of each possible outcome by the corresponding change in stock price and then sum up these products.\n\nThere are four possible outcomes:\n\n1. The stock price drops by $2: The probability of the stock price dropping is 0.3, and the probability of it dropping by $2 given that it drops is 0.6. So, the probability of this outcome is 0.3 * 0.6 = 0.18.\n\n2. The stock price drops by $5: The probability of the stock price dropping is 0.3, and the probability of it dropping by $5 given that it drops is 0.4. So, the probability of this outcome is 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12.\n\n3. The stock price remains unchanged: The probability of the stock price not dropping is 0.7, and the probability of it remaining unchanged given that it doesn't drop is 0.7. So, the probability of this outcome is 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49.\n\n4. The stock price rises by $3: The probability of the stock price not dropping is 0.7, and the probability of it rising by $3 given that it doesn't drop is 0.3. So, the probability of this outcome is 0.7 * 0.3 = 0.21.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected change in stock price:\n\nExpected change = (0.18 * -$2) + (0.12 * -$5) + (0.49 * $0) + (0.21 * $3)\nExpected change = (-$0.36) + (-$0.60) + ($0) + ($0.63)\nExpected change = -$0.33\n\nSo, the expected change in stock price on this day is -$0.33."
