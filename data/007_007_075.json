    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions (x, y) for the Diophantine equation 2x + 5y = 103, we can first find a particular solution and then use the general form of Diophantine equations to find all other solutions.\n\nFirst, let's find a particular solution. We can start by finding a value of y such that 2x + 5y = 103 is divisible by 2. We can try different integer values of y and see if the equation holds true.\n\nFor y = 1, we have 2x + 5(1) = 103, which gives x = 49. So, one particular solution is (x, y) = (49, 1).\n\nNow, we can use the general form of Diophantine equations to find all other solutions. The general form for the equation ax + by = c, where a and b are coefficients and c is the constant term, is given by:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is a particular solution, d is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b, and n is an integer.\n\nIn our case, a = 2, b = 5, and d = GCD(2, 5) = 1. The particular solution we found is (x0, y0) = (49, 1). So, the general form of the solutions is:\n\nx = 49 + 5n\ny = 1 - 2n\n\nNow, we can find all integer solutions (x, y) by plugging in different integer values for n:\n\nn = 0: (x, y) = (49, 1)\nn = 1: (x, y) = (54, -1)\nn = -1: (x, y) = (44, 3)\nn = 2: (x, y) = (59, -3)\nn = -2: (x, y) = (39, 5)\n...\n\nWe can continue this process to find more integer solutions. However, it's important to note that there are infinitely many integer solutions for this Diophantine equation."
