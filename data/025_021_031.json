    "message_2": "To determine the Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}$ and $h^{2,1}$ for the given Calabi-Yau threefold using mirror symmetry, we first need to find the Hodge numbers for its mirror dual, the Fermat quintic in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$. The Fermat quintic is defined by the equation:\n\n$F(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) = x_1^5 + x_2^5 + x_3^5 + x_4^5 + x_5^5 = 0$\n\nThe Hodge numbers for the Fermat quintic are well-known and can be computed using the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem. The Hodge diamond for the Fermat quintic is:\n\n$\\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\n & & & & 1 & & & & \\\\\n & & & 0 & & 0 & & & \\\\\n & & 1 & & 101 & & 1 & & \\\\\n & 0 & & 0 & & 0 & & 0 & \\\\\n 1 & & 1 & & 1 & & 1 & & 1\n\\end{array}$\n\nFrom the Hodge diamond, we can see that the Hodge numbers for the Fermat quintic are $h^{1,1} = 1$ and $h^{2,1} = 101$.\n\nNow, we can use mirror symmetry to determine the Hodge numbers for the given Calabi-Yau threefold. Mirror symmetry states that the Hodge numbers of a Calabi-Yau threefold and its mirror dual are related as follows:\n\n$h^{1,1}(\\text{mirror}) = h^{2,1}(\\text{original})$\n\n$h^{2,1}(\\text{mirror}) = h^{1,1}(\\text{original})$\n\nApplying this to our problem, we get:\n\n$h^{1,1}(\\text{given Calabi-Yau}) = h^{2,1}(\\text{Fermat quintic}) = 101$\n\n$h^{2,1}(\\text{given Calabi-Yau}) = h^{1,1}(\\text{Fermat quintic}) = 1$\n\nThus, the Hodge numbers for the given Calabi-Yau threefold are $h^{1,1} = 101$ and $h^{2,1} = 1$."
