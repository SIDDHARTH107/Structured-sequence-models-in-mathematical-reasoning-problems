    "message_1": "Given a Feistel cipher with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits, if the plaintext message to be encrypted is \"1100111001011101\", what would be the resulting ciphertext message after a single round of encryption? Assume that the round function is a simple XOR operation.",
    "message_2": "To perform a single round of encryption using a Feistel cipher, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the plaintext message into two equal halves, L0 (left half) and R0 (right half).\n2. Apply the round function to R0, using a subkey derived from the main key.\n3. XOR the result of the round function with L0.\n4. Swap the two halves.\n\nHowever, the given plaintext message \"1100111001011101\" is only 16 bits long, while the block size of the Feistel cipher is specified as 64 bits. To proceed with the encryption, we need to pad the plaintext message to the required block size.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume we pad the plaintext message with zeros to the left, resulting in a 64-bit message:\n\nPlaintext: 000000000000000000000000000000001100111001011101\n\nNow, we can perform a single round of encryption:\n\n1. Divide the plaintext message into two equal halves:\n   L0 = 00000000000000000000000000000000\n   R0 = 1100111001011101\n\n2. Apply the round function to R0 using a subkey derived from the main key. Since the round function is a simple XOR operation and we don't have the actual key, we can represent the subkey as K1:\n\n   Round function: R0 XOR K1 = R1\n\n3. XOR the result of the round function with L0:\n\n   L1 = L0 XOR R1 = 00000000000000000000000000000000 XOR (R0 XOR K1)\n\n4. Swap the two halves:\n\n   L1 becomes the new right half, and R1 becomes the new left half.\n\nThe resulting ciphertext message after a single round of encryption would be:\n\nCiphertext: (R0 XOR K1) || L1\n\nSince we don't have the actual key, we cannot compute the exact ciphertext. However, the structure of the ciphertext message is given above."
