    "message_2": "To find a biholomorphic map f: D → D that sends 0 to 1/2, we can use the Möbius transformation. A Möbius transformation is a function of the form:\n\nf(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d)\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are complex numbers and ad - bc ≠ 0. Möbius transformations are biholomorphic maps between the Riemann sphere (the complex plane plus a point at infinity) and itself. In particular, they map circles and lines to circles and lines.\n\nWe want to find a Möbius transformation that maps the unit disk D to itself and sends 0 to 1/2. Since f(0) = b/d, we can set b = 1/2 and d = 1. Now we have:\n\nf(z) = (az + 1/2) / (cz + 1)\n\nWe also want f to map the boundary of D, which is the unit circle |z| = 1, to itself. This means that if |z| = 1, then |f(z)| = 1 as well. Let z = e^(iθ) be a point on the unit circle. Then:\n\n|f(e^(iθ))| = |(ae^(iθ) + 1/2) / (ce^(iθ) + 1)| = 1\n\nWe can simplify this expression by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n|f(e^(iθ))| = |(ae^(iθ) + 1/2)(1 - ce^(-iθ))| / |1 - ce^(iθ)||1 - ce^(-iθ)| = 1\n\nExpanding the numerator, we get:\n\n|f(e^(iθ))| = |ae^(iθ) - ace^(-iθ) + 1/2 - 1/2ce^(-iθ)| = 1\n\nNow, let's consider the case when θ = 0:\n\n|f(1)| = |a - ac + 1/2 - 1/2c| = 1\n\nSince f(1) is on the boundary of the unit disk, we must have |a - ac + 1/2 - 1/2c| = 1. We can rewrite this as:\n\n|a(1 - c) + 1/2(1 - c)| = 1\n\nNow, let's consider the case when θ = π:\n\n|f(-1)| = |-a - ac - 1/2 + 1/2c| = 1\n\nSince f(-1) is also on the boundary of the unit disk, we must have |-a - ac - 1/2 + 1/2c| = 1. We can rewrite this as:\n\n|-a(1 + c) - 1/2(1 - c)| = 1\n\nComparing the two equations, we can see that they are the same if we set c = -1. Then, the Möbius transformation becomes:\n\nf(z) = (az + 1/2) / (-z + 1)\n\nNow we need to find the value of a. Since f(0) = 1/2, we have:\n\n1/2 = (a * 0 + 1/2) / (-0 + 1)\n\nThis equation is already satisfied, so we don't need to change the value of a. Therefore, the biholomorphic map f: D → D that sends 0 to 1/2 is given by:\n\nf(z) = (az + 1/2) / (-z + 1)\n\nwith a = 1 and c = -1."
