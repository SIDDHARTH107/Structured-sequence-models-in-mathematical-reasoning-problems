    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian of the curve C at the point (-1, 1), we first need to find the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. Let F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 2x^2 - x. Then, the curve C is defined by the equation F(x, y) = 0.\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives of F:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 - 4x - 1\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNext, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (-1, 1):\n\n∂F/∂x(-1, 1) = -3(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0\n∂F/∂y(-1, 1) = 2(1) = 2\n\nFinally, we form the Jacobian matrix J_F(x, y) and evaluate it at the point (-1, 1):\n\nJ_F(x, y) = | ∂F/∂x  ∂F/∂y |\n                 |  0         2   |\n\nSo, the Jacobian of the curve C at the point (-1, 1) is:\n\nJ_F(-1, 1) = | 0  2 |"
