    "message_2": "To solve the exponential equation 2^x = 16, we need to find the value of x that makes the equation true.\n\nWe can rewrite 16 as a power of 2:\n\n16 = 2^4\n\nNow we have:\n\n2^x = 2^4\n\nSince the bases are the same (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx = 4\n\nSo the solution to the exponential equation 2^x = 16 is x = 4."
