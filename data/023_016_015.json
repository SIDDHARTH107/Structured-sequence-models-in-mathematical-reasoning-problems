    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to determine the coefficients a_n and b_n. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ(a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx))\n\nwhere the summation is from n=1 to infinity.\n\nThe coefficients a_n and b_n are given by the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * ∫(f(x) * 1) dx from 0 to 2π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * cos(nx)) dx from 0 to 2π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫(f(x) * sin(nx)) dx from 0 to 2π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * [∫(1) dx from 0 to π/2 + ∫(-1) dx from π/2 to π + ∫(0) dx from π to 2π]\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * [x | from 0 to π/2 - x | from π/2 to π + 0]\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * (π/2 - π/2) = 0\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫(1 * cos(nx)) dx from 0 to π/2 + ∫(-1 * cos(nx)) dx from π/2 to π + ∫(0 * cos(nx)) dx from π to 2π]\na_n = (1/π) * [∫(cos(nx)) dx from 0 to π/2 - ∫(cos(nx)) dx from π/2 to π]\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/n) * sin(nx) | from 0 to π/2 - (1/n) * sin(nx) | from π/2 to π]\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/n) * (sin(nπ/2) - 0) - (1/n) * (sin(nπ) - sin(nπ/2))]\na_n = (1/nπ) * (2 * sin(nπ/2) - sin(nπ))\n\nSince sin(nπ) is always 0 for integer values of n, we have:\n\na_n = (2/nπ) * sin(nπ/2)\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(1 * sin(nx)) dx from 0 to π/2 + ∫(-1 * sin(nx)) dx from π/2 to π + ∫(0 * sin(nx)) dx from π to 2π]\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(sin(nx)) dx from 0 to π/2 - ∫(sin(nx)) dx from π/2 to π]\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n) * cos(nx) | from 0 to π/2 + (1/n) * cos(nx) | from π/2 to π]\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n) * (cos(nπ/2) - 1) + (1/n) * (cos(nπ) - cos(nπ/2))]\nb_n = (1/nπ) * (cos(nπ) - cos(nπ/2) - cos(nπ/2) + 1)\n\nSince cos(nπ) is 1 for even n and -1 for odd n, we have:\n\nb_n = (1/nπ) * (2 - 2 * cos(nπ/2)) for even n\nb_n = (1/nπ) * (0) for odd n\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ[((2/nπ) * sin(nπ/2)) * cos(nx) + ((1/nπ) * (2 - 2 * cos(nπ/2))) * sin(nx) for even n] + [0 for odd n]\n\nThe Fourier series represents the given function f(x) with the discontinuities at x = π/2 and x = π."
