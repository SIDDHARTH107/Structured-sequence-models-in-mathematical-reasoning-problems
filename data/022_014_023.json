    "message_2": "Since f(z) is a harmonic function, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n(1) ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y\n(2) ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nWe are given f(2i) = 3 - i and f(√3i) = 5 - 2i. Let's write these in terms of u and v:\n\nf(2i) = u(0,2) + iv(0,2) = 3 - i\nf(√3i) = u(0,√3) + iv(0,√3) = 5 - 2i\n\nFrom these, we can deduce that:\n\nu(0,2) = 3, v(0,2) = -1\nu(0,√3) = 5, v(0,√3) = -2\n\nNow, let's use the Laplace equation, which is also satisfied by harmonic functions:\n\nΔu = ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0\nΔv = ∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y² = 0\n\nSince f(z) is harmonic in D, we can use the polar form of the Laplace equation:\n\n(1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂u/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²u/∂θ² = 0\n(1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂v/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²v/∂θ² = 0\n\nNow, let's use the Cauchy-Riemann equations in polar form:\n\n(3) ∂u/∂r = (1/r) ∂v/∂θ\n(4) ∂v/∂r = -(1/r) ∂u/∂θ\n\nWe can eliminate v by differentiating (3) with respect to θ and (4) with respect to r, and then subtracting the resulting equations:\n\n∂²u/∂r∂θ - (1/r²) ∂²u/∂θ² = 0\n\nNow, let's assume a solution of the form u(r,θ) = R(r)Θ(θ). Then, we can rewrite the above equation as:\n\nR'(r)Θ'(θ) - (1/r²) R(r)Θ''(θ) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by R(r)Θ(θ) to separate the variables:\n\n(1/R'(r)) ∂R/∂r = (r²/Θ''(θ)) ∂Θ/∂θ\n\nSince the left side depends only on r and the right side depends only on θ, both sides must be equal to a constant, say k:\n\n(1/R'(r)) ∂R/∂r = k\n(r²/Θ''(θ)) ∂Θ/∂θ = k\n\nNow, we can solve these two ordinary differential equations:\n\nR'(r) = kR(r) => R(r) = A*r^k\nΘ''(θ) = k*r²Θ'(θ) => Θ(θ) = B*cos(k*θ) + C*sin(k*θ)\n\nThus, the general solution for u(r,θ) is:\n\nu(r,θ) = (A*r^k)*(B*cos(k*θ) + C*sin(k*θ))\n\nNow, we can use the boundary conditions to find A, B, and C:\n\nu(0,2) = 3 => A*0^k*B = 3 => B = 3/A\nu(0,√3) = 5 => A*(√3)^k*C = 5 => C = 5/(A*(√3)^k)\n\nNow, we can write the real part of f(z) for all (x,y) in D:\n\nu(x,y) = (A*r^k)*(3*cos(k*θ) + (5/(√3)^k)*sin(k*θ))\n\nSince f(z) is harmonic, it is uniquely determined by its boundary values. Thus, this is the real part of f(z) for all (x,y) in D."
