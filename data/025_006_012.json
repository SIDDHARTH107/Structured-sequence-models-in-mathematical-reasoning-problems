    "message_2": "First, let's clarify that a smooth plane cubic curve is actually a one-dimensional projective variety, not two-dimensional as stated in the problem. This is because it is defined by a single homogeneous polynomial equation of degree 3 in three variables (x, y, z), not two variables.\n\nNow, let's consider the cohomology group H^1(X, ℤ). Since X is a smooth plane cubic curve, it is a non-singular projective curve of genus g. The genus of a smooth plane curve of degree d is given by the formula:\n\ng = (d-1)(d-2)/2\n\nFor a cubic curve (d = 3), the genus is:\n\ng = (3-1)(3-2)/2 = 2(1)/2 = 1\n\nNow, we can use the fact that for a smooth projective curve of genus g over the complex numbers, the Betti numbers b_i are given by:\n\nb_i = 0 if i is odd and i > 2g,\nb_i = 2g if i is even and i > 2g,\nb_0 = 1,\nb_1 = 0,\nb_2 = 2g.\n\nIn our case, g = 1, so the Betti numbers are:\n\nb_0 = 1,\nb_1 = 0,\nb_2 = 2.\n\nThe dimension of the cohomology group H^1(X, ℤ) is given by the first Betti number, b_1. Therefore, the dimension of H^1(X, ℤ) is 0."
