Prove that $p(z)$ has at least one root in the complex plane.",
    "message_2": "To show that $f(z)$ is constant, we can use Liouville's theorem, which states that any bounded entire function is constant. Since $|f(z)| \\leq M$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, $f(z)$ is bounded. As $f(z)$ is also entire, by Liouville's theorem, $f(z)$ must be constant.\n\nNow, let's prove that the polynomial $p(z) = a_n z^n + a_{n-1} z^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 z + a_0$ has at least one root in the complex plane. We will use the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every non-constant polynomial has at least one root in the complex plane.\n\nSince $p(z)$ is a polynomial of degree $n \\geq 1$ with complex coefficients and $a_n \\neq 0$, it is non-constant. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, $p(z)$ must have at least one root in the complex plane."
