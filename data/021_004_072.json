    "message_2": "To approximate the first derivative of f(x) at x=1 using the forward difference method with a step size of h=0.1, we will use the formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h\n\nFirst, let's calculate f(1) and f(1.1):\n\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 2(1)^2 + (1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 1 + 3 = 3\nf(1.1) = (1.1)^3 - 2(1.1)^2 + (1.1) + 3 ≈ 1.331 - 2.42 + 1.1 + 3 ≈ 3.011\n\nNow, we can use the forward difference formula:\n\nf'(1) ≈ (f(1.1) - f(1)) / 0.1 ≈ (3.011 - 3) / 0.1 ≈ 0.11 / 0.1 = 1.1\n\nSo, the approximate value of the first derivative of f(x) at x=1 using the forward difference method with a step size of h=0.1 is 1.1."
