    "message_2": "To solve the exponential equation 3^(x+1) = 27^(x-2), we can rewrite the equation using the same base for both sides. Since 27 is 3^3, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n3^(x+1) = (3^3)^(x-2)\n\nNow, we can use the property of exponents that states (a^m)^n = a^(m*n) to simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n3^(x+1) = 3^(3*(x-2))\n\nNow that both sides of the equation have the same base, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx + 1 = 3*(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx + 1 = 3x - 6\n\nAdd -x to both sides:\n\n1 = 2x - 6\n\nAdd 6 to both sides:\n\n7 = 2x\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx = 7/2\n\nSo, the solution to the exponential equation 3^(x+1) = 27^(x-2) is x = 7/2."
