    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (circle) and the lateral surface area (the curved part of the cone). The formula for the surface area of a cone is:\n\nSurface Area = Base Area + Lateral Surface Area\n\nThe base area (A_base) is the area of the circle, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA_base = π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base.\n\nThe lateral surface area (A_lateral) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA_lateral = π * r * l\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base and l is the slant height of the cone.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (l). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find it, since the radius, height, and slant height form a right triangle:\n\nl^2 = r^2 + h^2\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and l is the slant height.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 6 cm and the height (h) is 10 cm, we can find the slant height (l):\n\nl^2 = 6^2 + 10^2\nl^2 = 36 + 100\nl^2 = 136\nl = √136\nl ≈ 11.66 cm\n\nNow we can find the base area (A_base):\n\nA_base = π * 6^2\nA_base = π * 36\nA_base ≈ 113.1 cm^2\n\nNext, we can find the lateral surface area (A_lateral):\n\nA_lateral = π * 6 * 11.66\nA_lateral ≈ 219.8 cm^2\n\nFinally, we can find the total surface area of the cone:\n\nSurface Area = A_base + A_lateral\nSurface Area ≈ 113.1 + 219.8\nSurface Area ≈ 332.9 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cone is approximately 332.9 square centimeters."
