    "message_2": "To find the eigenvalues of the matrix A, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[5 - λ, 2], [2, 3 - λ]]\n\nNow, we compute the determinant:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (5 - λ)(3 - λ) - (2)(2) = λ^2 - 8λ + 15 - 4 = λ^2 - 8λ + 11\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we set the determinant equal to zero and solve for λ:\n\nλ^2 - 8λ + 11 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots (eigenvalues):\n\nλ = (8 ± √(8^2 - 4(11))) / 2 = (8 ± √(64 - 44)) / 2 = (8 ± √20) / 2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are:\n\nλ1 = (8 + √20) / 2\nλ2 = (8 - √20) / 2\n\nNow, we will find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. We'll start with λ1:\n\n(A - λ1I) * x = 0\n([[5 - (8 + √20) / 2, 2], [2, 3 - (8 + √20) / 2]]) * x = 0\n\nSimplifying the matrix:\n\n[[-(√20) / 2, 2], [2, -(√20) / 2]] * x = 0\n\nLet x = [x1, x2]. We can write the system of linear equations:\n\n(-√20 / 2) * x1 + 2 * x2 = 0\n2 * x1 - (√20 / 2) * x2 = 0\n\nWe can solve for x1 in terms of x2 from the first equation:\n\nx1 = (2 / (√20 / 2)) * x2 = (2√20 / 20) * x2 = (√20 / 10) * x2\n\nThe eigenvector corresponding to λ1 is:\n\nx1 = k * (√20 / 10, 1), where k is a scalar.\n\nNow, we'll find the eigenvector for λ2:\n\n(A - λ2I) * x = 0\n([[5 - (8 - √20) / 2, 2], [2, 3 - (8 - √20) / 2]]) * x = 0\n\nSimplifying the matrix:\n\n[(√20) / 2, 2], [2, (√20) / 2]] * x = 0\n\nLet x = [x1, x2]. We can write the system of linear equations:\n\n(√20 / 2) * x1 + 2 * x2 = 0\n2 * x1 + (√20 / 2) * x2 = 0\n\nWe can solve for x1 in terms of x2 from the first equation:\n\nx1 = (-2 / (√20 / 2)) * x2 = (-2√20 / 20) * x2 = (-√20 / 10) * x2\n\nThe eigenvector corresponding to λ2 is:\n\nx2 = k * (-√20 / 10, 1), where k is a scalar.\n\nIn conclusion, the eigenvalues of the matrix A are λ1 = (8 + √20) / 2 and λ2 = (8 - √20) / 2, and their corresponding eigenvectors are x1 = k * (√20 / 10, 1) and x2 = k * (-√20 / 10, 1), respectively, where k is a scalar."
