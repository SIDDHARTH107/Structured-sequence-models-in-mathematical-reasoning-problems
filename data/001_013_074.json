    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to get rid of the square root. We can do this by squaring both sides of the equation:\n\n(√(4x - 3))^2 = 5^2\n\nNow, we can simplify:\n\n4x - 3 = 25\n\nNext, we need to isolate x. To do this, we'll first add 3 to both sides of the equation:\n\n4x = 28\n\nFinally, we'll divide both sides by 4:\n\nx = 7\n\nSo, the solution for x is 7."
