    "message_1": "What is the probability of exactly 4 burglaries occurring in a certain neighborhood within a month, given that the average number of burglaries in that neighborhood is 3 per month and the standard deviation is 1.5? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is appropriate for modeling the number of events (in this case, burglaries) that occur in a fixed interval of time (a month) with a known average rate (3 burglaries per month).\n\nThe probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere X is the random variable representing the number of events (burglaries), k is the number of events we are interested in (4 burglaries), λ is the average number of events (3 burglaries per month), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 4) = (3^4 * e^(-3)) / 4!\nP(X = 4) = (81 * e^(-3)) / 24\nP(X = 4) = (81 * 0.049787) / 24\nP(X = 4) = 4.034 / 24\nP(X = 4) ≈ 0.1681\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the probability of exactly 4 burglaries occurring in the neighborhood within a month is approximately 0.17."
