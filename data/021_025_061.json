    "message_1": "A company produces two products, X and Y, and has a daily production capacity of 150 units. Product X requires 3 hours of production time and product Y requires 5 hours. The profit for each unit of X is $10 and for each unit of Y is $15. The company wants to maximize its daily profit. Use whale optimization algorithm to determine how many units of each product the company should produce per day to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. However, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute the WOA directly. Instead, I will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to use the WOA to solve this problem.\n\n1. Define the objective function: The objective function represents the profit that the company wants to maximize. In this case, the profit is given by:\n\nProfit = 10 * X + 15 * Y\n\n2. Define the constraints: The company has a daily production capacity of 150 units and a limited amount of production time. The constraints are:\n\nX + Y ≤ 150 (production capacity constraint)\n3X + 5Y ≤ T (time constraint, where T is the total available production time)\n\n3. Initialize the whale population: Generate a random initial population of whales (solutions) within the search space. Each whale represents a possible solution, with X and Y values.\n\n4. Determine the best initial whale: Evaluate the objective function for each whale in the population and select the whale with the highest profit.\n\n5. Set the maximum number of iterations: Choose a maximum number of iterations for the WOA to run. This will determine how long the algorithm will search for the optimal solution.\n\n6. Perform the WOA: For each iteration, update the position of each whale in the population using the WOA equations. This involves mimicking the hunting behavior of humpback whales, including encircling prey, bubble-net attacking, and spiral movement.\n\n7. Update the best whale: After updating the positions of the whales, evaluate the objective function for each whale again. If a whale has a higher profit than the current best whale, update the best whale.\n\n8. Check for convergence: If the algorithm has reached the maximum number of iterations or the best whale's profit has not improved significantly, stop the algorithm. Otherwise, return to step 6.\n\n9. Obtain the optimal solution: The best whale represents the optimal solution, which includes the optimal number of units of products X and Y to maximize the daily profit.\n\nPlease note that the WOA is a complex algorithm that requires programming skills to implement. There are libraries available in Python, such as \"PyWhale,\" which can help you implement the WOA more easily."
