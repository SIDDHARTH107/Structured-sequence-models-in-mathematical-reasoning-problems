    "message_1": "Suppose a pizza parlor claims that the average diameter of their large pizza is 14 inches. To test this claim, a random sample of 25 large pizzas was selected and their diameters were measured. The mean diameter of the sample was found to be 13.5 inches with a standard deviation of 1.8 inches. \n\nCan you determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the pizza parlor's claim at 5% level of significance?",
    "message_2": "To determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the pizza parlor's claim at a 5% level of significance, we will perform a one-sample t-test.\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The average diameter of the large pizzas is 14 inches (µ = 14).\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The average diameter of the large pizzas is not 14 inches (µ ≠ 14).\n\nGiven information:\nSample size (n) = 25\nSample mean (x̄) = 13.5 inches\nSample standard deviation (s) = 1.8 inches\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - µ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (13.5 - 14) / (1.8 / √25)\nt = (-0.5) / (1.8 / 5)\nt = -0.5 / 0.36\nt = -1.39\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24) and a significance level of 0.05. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.064.\n\nSince the calculated t-score (-1.39) is within the range of the critical t-values (-2.064 to 2.064), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to reject the pizza parlor's claim that the average diameter of their large pizza is 14 inches at a 5% level of significance."
