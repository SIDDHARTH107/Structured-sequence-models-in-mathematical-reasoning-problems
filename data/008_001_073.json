    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the matrix method, we first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  1 |  7 ]\n[ 3 -2 | -1 ]\n```\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have the largest absolute value in the first column:\n\n```\n[ 3 -2 | -1 ]\n[ 2  1 |  7 ]\n```\n\n2. Multiply Row 1 by 2/3 and subtract it from Row 2 to eliminate the x term in Row 2:\n\n```\n[ 3 -2 | -1 ]\n[ 0  5/3 | 25/3 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. We can solve for y by dividing Row 2 by 5/3:\n\n```\n[ 3 -2 | -1 ]\n[ 0  1 |  5 ]\n```\n\nSo, y = 5.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of y back into the equation in Row 1 to solve for x:\n\n3x - 2(5) = -1\n\n3x - 10 = -1\n\n3x = 9\n\nx = 3\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3 and y = 5."
