    "message_2": "The logistic growth model is not applicable in this case since the problem states that the population of rabbits doubles every year. The logistic growth model is used when a population grows exponentially but has a carrying capacity, which limits its growth. In this case, we can use the exponential growth model instead.\n\nLet P(t) be the population of rabbits at the beginning of year t. According to the exponential growth model, the population doubles every year. Therefore, we can write the formula as:\n\nP(t) = P(0) * 2^t\n\nWhere P(0) is the initial population (100 rabbits) and t is the number of years.\n\nWe want to find the population at the beginning of year 5, so we need to calculate P(5):\n\nP(5) = 100 * 2^5\nP(5) = 100 * 32\nP(5) = 3200\n\nSo, there will be 3,200 rabbits at the beginning of year 5, assuming the exponential growth model."
