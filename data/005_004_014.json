    "message_2": "To calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB), we can use the following formula:\n\nSSB = Î£(n_i * (M_i - M_total)^2)\n\nwhere n_i is the sample size of each group, M_i is the mean of each group, and M_total is the overall mean.\n\nIn this case, we have 4 groups with sample sizes of 6 each, group means of 10, 12, 8, and 9, and an overall mean of 9.5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSSB = (6 * (10 - 9.5)^2) + (6 * (12 - 9.5)^2) + (6 * (8 - 9.5)^2) + (6 * (9 - 9.5)^2)\n\nSSB = (6 * (0.5)^2) + (6 * (2.5)^2) + (6 * (-1.5)^2) + (6 * (-0.5)^2)\n\nSSB = (6 * 0.25) + (6 * 6.25) + (6 * 2.25) + (6 * 0.25)\n\nSSB = 1.5 + 37.5 + 13.5 + 1.5\n\nSSB = 54\n\nSo, the sum of squares between groups for this data set is 54."
