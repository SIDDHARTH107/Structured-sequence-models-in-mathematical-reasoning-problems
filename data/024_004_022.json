    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,2), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms. Let the surface be parametrized by the position vector r(u,v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2). Then, we can compute the partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 2uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNext, we compute the second derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 2)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = r_uu • N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nM = r_uv • N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nN = r_vv • N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nFinally, we can compute the mean curvature H using the formula:\n\nH = (EG - F^2)(LN + MN - 2MM) - (EL - 2FM + GN)(LN - 2LM + MN) / 2(EG - F^2)^2\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have u=1 and v=1:\n\nE = 5, F = 2, G = 5\nL = 2 / sqrt(9), M = 2 / sqrt(9), N = 2 / sqrt(9)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula for H, we get:\n\nH = (25 - 4)(4/9 + 4/9 - 4/9) - (10 - 12 + 10)(4/9 - 4/9 + 4/9) / 2(21)^2\n\nH = (21)(4/9) / (2 * 21^2)\n\nH = 4 / (2 * 21)\n\nH = 1/21\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,2) is 1/21."
