    "message_2": "In the given graph G, a maximum independent set is a set of vertices with no two vertices being adjacent, and it is the largest such set. \n\nOne possible maximum independent set for this graph is {A, D, F}. There are no edges between these vertices, and it is not possible to add any more vertices to this set without creating an edge between two vertices in the set. Therefore, the maximum independent set in this graph is {A, D, F}."
