The given surface has the following equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4\n\nThe student is asked to show their work and provide the final answer in decimal form, rounded to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures of the surface, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms. The given surface is a sphere with radius 2, and its equation is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4\n\nLet's parameterize the surface using spherical coordinates:\n\nx = 2sin(θ)cos(ϕ)\ny = 2sin(θ)sin(ϕ)\nz = 2cos(θ)\n\nNow, we need to find the first fundamental form. We compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂x/∂θ = 2cos(θ)cos(ϕ)\n∂x/∂ϕ = -2sin(θ)sin(ϕ)\n∂y/∂θ = 2cos(θ)sin(ϕ)\n∂y/∂ϕ = 2sin(θ)cos(ϕ)\n∂z/∂θ = -2sin(θ)\n∂z/∂ϕ = 0\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\n[ (∂x/∂θ)^2 + (∂y/∂θ)^2 + (∂z/∂θ)^2, (∂x/∂θ)(∂x/∂ϕ) + (∂y/∂θ)(∂y/∂ϕ) + (∂z/∂θ)(∂z/∂ϕ) ]\n[ (∂x/∂θ)(∂x/∂ϕ) + (∂y/∂θ)(∂y/∂ϕ) + (∂z/∂θ)(∂z/∂ϕ), (∂x/∂ϕ)^2 + (∂y/∂ϕ)^2 + (∂z/∂ϕ)^2 ]\n\nPlugging in the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n[ 4, 0 ]\n[ 0, 4 ]\n\nNow, we need to find the second fundamental form. We compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂^2x/∂θ^2 = -4sin(θ)cos(ϕ)\n∂^2x/∂θ∂ϕ = -4cos(θ)sin(ϕ)\n∂^2x/∂ϕ^2 = -4sin(θ)cos(ϕ)\n∂^2y/∂θ^2 = -4sin(θ)sin(ϕ)\n∂^2y/∂θ∂ϕ = 4cos(θ)cos(ϕ)\n∂^2y/∂ϕ^2 = -4sin(θ)sin(ϕ)\n∂^2z/∂θ^2 = -4cos(θ)\n∂^2z/∂θ∂ϕ = 0\n∂^2z/∂ϕ^2 = 0\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\n[ (∂^2x/∂θ^2)(∂x/∂θ) + (∂^2y/∂θ^2)(∂y/∂θ) + (∂^2z/∂θ^2)(∂z/∂θ), (∂^2x/∂θ∂ϕ)(∂x/∂ϕ) + (∂^2y/∂θ∂ϕ)(∂y/∂ϕ) + (∂^2z/∂θ∂ϕ)(∂z/∂ϕ) ]\n[ (∂^2x/∂θ∂ϕ)(∂x/∂θ) + (∂^2y/∂θ∂ϕ)(∂y/∂θ) + (∂^2z/∂θ∂ϕ)(∂z/∂θ), (∂^2x/∂ϕ^2)(∂x/∂ϕ) + (∂^2y/∂ϕ^2)(∂y/∂ϕ) + (∂^2z/∂ϕ^2)(∂z/∂ϕ) ]\n\nPlugging in the second partial derivatives, we get:\n\n[ -8, 0 ]\n[ 0, -8 ]\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures k1 and k2 by solving the following equation:\n\ndet(First fundamental form * k - Second fundamental form) = 0\n\nIn our case, the equation becomes:\n\ndet([ 4k + 8, 0 ]\n      [ 0, 4k + 8 ]) = 0\n\n(4k + 8)^2 = 0\n\nk = -2\n\nSo, the principal curvatures are k1 = k2 = -2. In decimal form, rounded to two decimal places, the principal curvatures are -2.00."
