    "message_2": "To analyze the singularities of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 3)/(z-2), we first need to find the points where the function is not defined. These points occur when the denominator is equal to zero.\n\nThe denominator is z-2, so we set it equal to zero and solve for z:\n\nz - 2 = 0\nz = 2\n\nSo, the function has a singularity at z = 2.\n\nNow, we need to determine the type of singularity. There are three types of singularities: poles, essential singularities, and removable singularities.\n\n1. Poles: A function has a pole of order n at z = z0 if it can be written as f(z) = g(z)/(z-z0)^n, where g(z) is analytic and nonzero at z = z0.\n\n2. Essential Singularities: A function has an essential singularity at z = z0 if it cannot be written as a pole or a removable singularity.\n\n3. Removable Singularities: A function has a removable singularity at z = z0 if it can be redefined at z = z0 to make it analytic.\n\nIn our case, f(z) = (z^2 + 3)/(z-2). We can rewrite this function as:\n\nf(z) = g(z)/(z-2)^1\n\nwhere g(z) = z^2 + 3. g(z) is analytic and nonzero at z = 2, so the function has a pole of order 1 at z = 2. This is also called a simple pole.\n\nFinally, we need to determine if the singularity is isolated or non-isolated. A singularity is isolated if there exists a neighborhood around the singularity where the function is analytic except at the singularity itself.\n\nIn our case, f(z) is analytic everywhere except at z = 2. Therefore, the singularity at z = 2 is an isolated singularity.\n\nIn summary, the function f(z) = (z^2 + 3)/(z-2) has a simple pole (pole of order 1) at z = 2, and this singularity is isolated."
