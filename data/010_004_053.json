If A is compact in the subspace topology, then for every open cover {Uα}α∈I of A, there exists a finite subcover {Uα1, Uα2, ..., Uαn} of A.\n2. If for every open cover {Uα}α∈I of A, there exists a finite subcover {Uα1, Uα2, ..., Uαn} of A, then A is compact in the subspace topology.\n\n(1) Suppose A is compact in the subspace topology. Let {Uα}α∈I be an open cover of A. Since A is compact, there exists a finite subcover {Uα1, Uα2, ..., Uαn} of A. This shows the necessary condition.\n\n(2) Conversely, suppose that for every open cover {Uα}α∈I of A, there exists a finite subcover {Uα1, Uα2, ..., Uαn} of A. We want to show that A is compact in the subspace topology. Let {Vα}α∈I be an open cover of A in the subspace topology. Then, for each α ∈ I, there exists an open set Uα in X such that Vα = Uα ∩ A. The collection {Uα}α∈I is an open cover of A in X. By assumption, there exists a finite subcover {Uα1, Uα2, ..., Uαn} of A. Then, {Vα1, Vα2, ..., Vαn} = {Uα1 ∩ A, Uα2 ∩ A, ..., Uαn ∩ A} is a finite subcover of A in the subspace topology. This shows the sufficient condition.\n\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for A ⊆ X to be compact in the subspace topology is that for every open cover {Uα}α∈I of A, there exists a finite subcover {Uα1, Uα2, ..., Uαn} of A."
