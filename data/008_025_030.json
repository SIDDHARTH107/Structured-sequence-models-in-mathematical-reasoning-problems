    "message_2": "First, let's try to simplify the system of linear equations. We can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 6\n\nNow we have:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n2x + 3y = 6\n\nSince both equations are equal to each other, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n(2x + 3y) - (2x + 3y) = 8 - 6\n0 = 2\n\nSince 0 â‰  2, this system of linear equations has no solution."
