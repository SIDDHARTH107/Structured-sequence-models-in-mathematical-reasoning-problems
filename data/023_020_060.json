    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x/(1+x^2) over the interval -π to π, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is odd, we only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe Fourier series for an odd function is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑[b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x)]dx from -L to L\n\nFor our function, L = π. So, we need to find b_n:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[x/(1+x^2) * sin(n * x)]dx from -π to π\n\nTo find the integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = sin(n * x)/(1+x^2)dx\nThen, du = dx and v = ∫sin(n * x)/(1+x^2)dx\n\nThe integral of sin(n * x)/(1+x^2) is not elementary, so we'll use a substitution:\n\nLet x = tan(θ), then dx = sec^2(θ)dθ\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nv = ∫sin(n * tan(θ)) * sec^2(θ)dθ\n\nThis integral can be solved using the identity sin(a * tan(θ)) = (sin(a * sin(θ))) / cos(θ):\n\nv = ∫(sin(n * sin(θ)) * sec(θ))dθ\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts again:\n\nLet u = sin(n * sin(θ)) and dv = sec(θ)dθ\nThen, du = (n * cos(n * sin(θ)) * cos(θ))dθ and v = ln|sec(θ) + tan(θ)|\n\nNow, we can find the integral:\n\n∫[x/(1+x^2) * sin(n * x)]dx = uv - ∫vdu\n\nAfter finding the integral, we can plug it back into the b_n formula and find the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = x/(1+x^2) over the interval -π to π."
