    "message_1": "Sorry, it's not possible to provide a precise numerical problem related to paraconsistent logic as this field of logic deals with reasoning in situations where contradictions are possible. It does not involve numerical computations or equations. Is there any other topic or subtopic related to mathematics that you would like me to suggest a question for?",
    "message_2": "Of course! Here are a few mathematical topics and sample problems for each:\n\n1. Algebra:\nSolve the equation: 3x - 7 = 2x + 5\n\n2. Geometry:\nFind the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 6 units.\n\n3. Calculus:\nFind the derivative of the function: f(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 1\n\n4. Probability:\nA fair six-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of rolling an even number?\n\n5. Trigonometry:\nFind the sine, cosine, and tangent of a 30-degree angle.\n\nPlease let me know which topic you would like to explore, or if you have a specific problem you'd like me to solve."
