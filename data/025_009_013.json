Let $\\mathcal{M}_g$ be the moduli space of smooth algebraic curves of genus $g \\geq 2$. Prove that the family of elliptic curves is not parameterized by a connected component of $\\mathcal{M}_g$ for any $g$.",
    "message_2": "To prove that the family of elliptic curves is not parameterized by a connected component of $\\mathcal{M}_g$ for any $g$, we will show that the genus of an elliptic curve is always 1, which is less than 2.\n\nRecall that the genus of a smooth algebraic curve can be computed using the formula:\n\n$g = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$,\n\nwhere $n$ is the degree of the curve. In the case of elliptic curves given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$, the degree is 3. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$.\n\nSince the genus of an elliptic curve is always 1, it cannot be parameterized by a connected component of $\\mathcal{M}_g$ for any $g \\geq 2$."
