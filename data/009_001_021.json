    "message_1": "A population of rabbits grows at a rate proportional to its current size. If the initial population is 1000, and the population doubles in 4 months, find the differential equation for the population growth and find the population after 2 years.",
    "message_2": "To find the differential equation for the population growth, we can use the exponential growth model, which is given by:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere dP/dt is the rate of change of the population (P) with respect to time (t), and k is the proportionality constant.\n\nWe are given that the initial population is 1000 and it doubles in 4 months. Let's find the value of k using this information.\n\nWhen the population doubles, P = 2000. Since the population doubles in 4 months, we'll convert this time to years by dividing by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):\n\nt = 4/12 = 1/3 years\n\nNow, we can use the exponential growth formula:\n\nP(t) = P₀ * e^(kt)\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, P₀ is the initial population, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nWe can plug in the values we know:\n\n2000 = 1000 * e^(k * 1/3)\n\nDivide both sides by 1000:\n\n2 = e^(k * 1/3)\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = ln(e^(k * 1/3))\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, we can simplify the right side:\n\nln(2) = (k * 1/3) * ln(e)\n\nSince ln(e) = 1:\n\nln(2) = k * 1/3\n\nNow, solve for k:\n\nk = 3 * ln(2)\n\nNow that we have the value of k, we can find the population after 2 years. Plug the values into the exponential growth formula:\n\nP(t) = P₀ * e^(kt)\n\nP(2) = 1000 * e^(3 * ln(2) * 2)\n\nP(2) = 1000 * e^(6 * ln(2))\n\nUsing the property of exponentials, we can simplify:\n\nP(2) = 1000 * (e^(ln(2)))^6\n\nSince e^(ln(2)) = 2:\n\nP(2) = 1000 * 2^6\n\nP(2) = 1000 * 64\n\nP(2) = 64000\n\nSo, the population after 2 years will be 64,000 rabbits."
