    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = t^2e^(2t), we use the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nF(z) = L{f(t)} = ∫(0 to ∞) f(t)e^(-zt) dt\n\nSo, for f(t) = t^2e^(2t), we have:\n\nF(z) = ∫(0 to ∞) t^2e^(2t)e^(-zt) dt\n\nNow, combine the exponentials:\n\nF(z) = ∫(0 to ∞) t^2e^((2-z)t) dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice. Let's start by setting:\n\nu = t^2, dv = e^((2-z)t) dt\ndu = 2t dt, v = (1/(2-z))e^((2-z)t)\n\nNow, apply integration by parts:\n\nF(z) = [t^2(1/(2-z))e^((2-z)t)](0 to ∞) - ∫(0 to ∞) (2t(1/(2-z))e^((2-z)t)) dt\n\nThe first term in the brackets vanishes as t goes to infinity and is zero when t=0. So, we are left with:\n\nF(z) = - ∫(0 to ∞) (2t(1/(2-z))e^((2-z)t)) dt\n\nNow, we apply integration by parts again:\n\nu = t, dv = (1/(2-z))e^((2-z)t) dt\ndu = dt, v = (1/((2-z)^2))e^((2-z)t)\n\nF(z) = - [t(1/((2-z)^2))e^((2-z)t)](0 to ∞) + ∫(0 to ∞) (1/((2-z)^2))e^((2-z)t) dt\n\nAgain, the first term in the brackets vanishes as t goes to infinity and is zero when t=0. We are left with:\n\nF(z) = ∫(0 to ∞) (1/((2-z)^2))e^((2-z)t) dt\n\nNow, this is a simple exponential integral:\n\nF(z) = (1/((2-z)^2)) ∫(0 to ∞) e^((2-z)t) dt\n\nF(z) = (1/((2-z)^2)) * (-1/(2-z)) * [e^((2-z)t)](0 to ∞)\n\nF(z) = (1/((2-z)^3)) * (e^(-(2-z)∞) - e^0)\n\nF(z) = (1/((2-z)^3))\n\nNow, we have the complex analytic function F(z) associated with the Laplace transform. To find the poles and residues, we look for the singularities of F(z):\n\nPoles: The function F(z) has a pole of order 3 at z = 2.\n\nResidues: To find the residue at z = 2, we can use the formula for residues of a pole of order 3:\n\nRes(f, 2) = (1/2!)lim_(z->2) d^2/dz^2((z-2)^3 F(z))\n\nTaking the second derivative of (z-2)^3 F(z) = (z-2)^3(1/((2-z)^3)):\n\nd^2/dz^2((z-2)^3(1/((2-z)^3))) = 12\n\nSo, the residue at z = 2 is 12/2! = 6.\n\nIn conclusion, the complex analytic function associated with the Laplace transform is F(z) = 1/((2-z)^3), with a pole of order 3 at z = 2 and a residue of 6 at z = 2."
