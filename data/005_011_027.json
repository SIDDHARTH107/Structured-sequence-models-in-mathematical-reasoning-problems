    "message_1": "A beverage company wants to test two different flavors of drink to determine which one is more preferred by their customers. In total, 100 customers were randomly chosen to participate in the taste test. 50 customers were given drink A and 50 customers were given drink B. Out of the 50 customers who tried drink A, 25 rated it as their favorite. Out of the 50 customers who tried drink B, 32 rated it as their favorite. Based on this experiment, can we conclude that drink B is preferred over drink A by the customers? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in preference between drink A and drink B, we can perform a hypothesis test using the proportions of customers who rated each drink as their favorite. We will use a two-proportion z-test for this purpose.\n\nLet p1 be the proportion of customers who prefer drink A, and p2 be the proportion of customers who prefer drink B.\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): p1 = p2 (There is no difference in preference between drink A and drink B)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): p1 ≠ p2 (There is a difference in preference between drink A and drink B)\n\nWe are given:\nn1 = 50 (number of customers who tried drink A)\nx1 = 25 (number of customers who preferred drink A)\np1_hat = x1 / n1 = 25 / 50 = 0.5\n\nn2 = 50 (number of customers who tried drink B)\nx2 = 32 (number of customers who preferred drink B)\np2_hat = x2 / n2 = 32 / 50 = 0.64\n\nNow, we calculate the pooled proportion:\np_pool = (x1 + x2) / (n1 + n2) = (25 + 32) / (50 + 50) = 57 / 100 = 0.57\n\nNext, we calculate the standard error (SE):\nSE = sqrt(p_pool * (1 - p_pool) * (1/n1 + 1/n2)) = sqrt(0.57 * 0.43 * (1/50 + 1/50)) ≈ 0.1407\n\nNow, we calculate the z-score:\nz = (p1_hat - p2_hat) / SE = (0.5 - 0.64) / 0.1407 ≈ -0.9972\n\nUsing a significance level of 0.05 (α = 0.05), we find the critical z-scores for a two-tailed test:\nz_critical = ±1.96\n\nSince -1.96 < -0.9972 < 1.96, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nAt a 0.05 significance level, we do not have enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in preference between drink A and drink B."
