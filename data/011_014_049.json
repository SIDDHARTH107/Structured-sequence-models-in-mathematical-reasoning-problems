    "message_1": "A group of 8 friends decided to play a game. They each wrote down the names of all the other friends on a sheet of paper to form a complete graph of 8 vertices. What is the total number of edges in this graph?",
    "message_2": "In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge. To find the total number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of edges = n * (n - 1) / 2\n\nIn this case, n = 8 (since there are 8 friends). Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\nNumber of edges = 8 * (8 - 1) / 2\nNumber of edges = 8 * 7 / 2\nNumber of edges = 56 / 2\nNumber of edges = 28\n\nSo, there are a total of 28 edges in this complete graph."
