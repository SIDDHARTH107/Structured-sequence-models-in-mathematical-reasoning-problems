    "message_1": "In a statistics class of 40 students, their marks in three exams (A, B, and C) were recorded. The marks are normally distributed with a mean of 75 and a standard deviation of 10 for exam A, a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 8 for exam B, and a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 12 for exam C. Find the following:\n\n1. The correlation coefficient between exam A and B.\n2. The multiple correlation coefficient between all three exams.\n3. The probability that a student scored above 80 in exam A and exam B but below 60 in exam C.",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient between exam A and B, we need the covariance between the two exams and the product of their standard deviations. However, we don't have enough information to find the covariance or the correlation coefficient between exam A and B. We need more data, such as the joint distribution of the scores or the actual scores of the students in both exams.\n\nFor the multiple correlation coefficient between all three exams, we again need more information. The multiple correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between a variable (in this case, exam scores) and a set of other variables (the other two exams). We need more data, such as the joint distribution of the scores or the actual scores of the students in all three exams, to calculate the multiple correlation coefficient.\n\nTo find the probability that a student scored above 80 in exam A and exam B but below 60 in exam C, we can use the individual probabilities for each exam and assume that the scores in the three exams are independent.\n\nFor exam A:\nP(A > 80) = 1 - P(A ≤ 80)\nTo find P(A ≤ 80), we can use the z-score formula:\nz = (X - μ) / σ\nz = (80 - 75) / 10 = 0.5\nUsing a z-table, we find that P(A ≤ 80) ≈ 0.6915\nSo, P(A > 80) ≈ 1 - 0.6915 = 0.3085\n\nFor exam B:\nP(B > 80) = 1 - P(B ≤ 80)\nz = (80 - 80) / 8 = 0\nP(B ≤ 80) = 0.5 (from the z-table)\nSo, P(B > 80) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nFor exam C:\nP(C < 60) = P(C ≤ 59)\nz = (59 - 70) / 12 ≈ -0.917\nUsing the z-table, we find that P(C ≤ 59) ≈ 0.1790\n\nAssuming independence between the exams, we can find the joint probability:\nP(A > 80, B > 80, C < 60) = P(A > 80) * P(B > 80) * P(C < 60)\nP(A > 80, B > 80, C < 60) ≈ 0.3085 * 0.5 * 0.1790 ≈ 0.0276\n\nSo, the probability that a student scored above 80 in exam A and exam B but below 60 in exam C is approximately 0.0276 or 2.76%."
