    "message_2": "A simplicial complex K is a collection of simplices that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. Every face of a simplex in K is also in K.\n2. The intersection of any two simplices in K is a face of both of them.\n\nA 2-dimensional simplex is a triangle, and we want to find the minimum number of triangles that K must contain.\n\nLet's consider the number of edges in K. Since K has 5 vertices and 9 edges, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees of the 5 vertices is 2 * 9 = 18.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of triangles in K. Each triangle contributes 3 edges to the total count of edges. However, since K is a simplicial complex, any two triangles that share an edge must also share a vertex. Therefore, each shared edge is counted twice in the total count of edges.\n\nLet t be the number of triangles in K. Then, the total number of edges in K can be expressed as 3t - s, where s is the number of shared edges between triangles. Since the sum of the degrees of the vertices is 18, we have:\n\n18 = 3t - s\n\nWe want to minimize the number of triangles, so we want to minimize t. To do this, we need to maximize the number of shared edges, s. The maximum number of shared edges occurs when all triangles share edges with each other, forming a complete graph on the 5 vertices. In this case, each vertex is connected to every other vertex, and there are 5 choose 2 = 10 possible edges. However, we are given that K has only 9 edges, so we must remove one edge from the complete graph.\n\nRemoving one edge breaks one of the triangles, leaving us with a graph that has 4 triangles and 8 shared edges. In this case, the equation becomes:\n\n18 = 3t - s\n18 = 3(4) - 8\n18 = 12 - 8\n18 = 4\n\nThus, the minimum number of 2-dimensional simplices (triangles) that K must contain is 4."
