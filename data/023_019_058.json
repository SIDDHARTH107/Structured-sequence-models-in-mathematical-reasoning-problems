    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system using Fourier transform analysis, we first need to find the characteristic equation of the given differential equation:\n\ny''(t) + 4y'(t) + 13y(t) = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\nλ^2 + 4λ + 13 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this equation. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nλ = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 13:\n\nλ = (-4 ± √(4^2 - 4(1)(13))) / 2(1)\nλ = (-4 ± √(16 - 52)) / 2\nλ = (-4 ± √(-36)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we have complex roots:\n\nλ = -2 ± 3i\n\nThe general solution of the differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = e^(-2t) (A * cos(3t) + B * sin(3t))\n\nNow, we need to apply the initial conditions to find the constants A and B:\n\ny(0) = 3\ny'(0) = -2\n\nApplying the first initial condition:\n\n3 = e^(0) (A * cos(0) + B * sin(0))\n3 = A\nA = 3\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of y(t):\n\ny'(t) = -2 * e^(-2t) (3 * cos(3t) + B * sin(3t)) + e^(-2t) (-3 * sin(3t) + 3B * cos(3t))\n\nApplying the second initial condition:\n\n-2 = -2 * e^(0) (3 * cos(0) + B * sin(0)) + e^(0) (-3 * sin(0) + 3B * cos(0))\n-2 = 3B\nB = -2/3\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\ny(t) = e^(-2t) (3 * cos(3t) - (2/3) * sin(3t))\n\nNow, we analyze the stability of the system. The stability is determined by the real part of the complex roots of the characteristic equation. In this case, the real part is -2, which is negative. Therefore, the system is stable.\n\nIn conclusion, the system described by the given differential equation is stable."
