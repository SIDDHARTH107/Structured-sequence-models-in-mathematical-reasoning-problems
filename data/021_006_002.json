    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Discretize the domain\n2. Define the basis functions\n3. Formulate the weak form of the PDE\n4. Assemble the global stiffness matrix and load vector\n5. Solve the linear system\n6. Compute the approximate solution\n\nStep 1: Discretize the domain\n\nWe will discretize the unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1] into an 8 × 8 mesh. Each element will have a size of 1/8 × 1/8. \n\nStep 2: Define the basis functions\n\nWe will use bilinear quadrilateral elements as our basis functions. Each element will have four nodes, and the basis functions will be defined as:\n\nϕ1(x, y) = (1 - x)(1 - y)\nϕ2(x, y) = x(1 - y)\nϕ3(x, y) = xy\nϕ4(x, y) = (1 - x)y\n\nStep 3: Formulate the weak form of the PDE\n\nWe will multiply the PDE by a test function v(x, y) and integrate over the domain:\n\n∫∫( - u_xx * v + u_yy * v + u * v) dxdy = 0\n\nWe will then substitute the basis functions into the weak form and integrate over each element:\n\n∫∫( - (ϕ_i)_xx * ϕ_j + (ϕ_i)_yy * ϕ_j + ϕ_i * ϕ_j) dxdy = 0\n\nStep 4: Assemble the global stiffness matrix and load vector\n\nWe will assemble the global stiffness matrix K and the load vector F by summing the contributions from each element:\n\nK = ∑ K_e\nF = ∑ F_e\n\nwhere K_e and F_e are the element stiffness matrix and load vector, respectively.\n\nStep 5: Solve the linear system\n\nWe will solve the linear system Ku = F for the unknown coefficients u.\n\nStep 6: Compute the approximate solution\n\nWe will compute the approximate solution u(x, y) as a linear combination of the basis functions:\n\nu(x, y) ≈ ∑ u_i * ϕ_i(x, y)\n\nwhere u_i are the coefficients obtained in Step 5.\n\nNote that this is a general outline of the finite element method for solving the given PDE. To obtain a numerical solution, you would need to implement these steps in a programming language or use specialized software like FEniCS, COMSOL, or ANSYS."
