    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The perimeter of a Hilbert curve increases with each order. To find the perimeter of a 3rd order Hilbert curve, we need to understand how the curve evolves with each order.\n\nFor a 0th order Hilbert curve, it's just a square with side length 1 unit, so the perimeter is 4 units.\n\nWhen we move to the 1st order Hilbert curve, each side of the 0th order curve is divided into two equal parts, and a new segment is added between them, forming a U-shape. So, for each side of the 0th order curve, we now have 3 segments of length 1/2. Since there are 4 sides, the total number of segments in the 1st order curve is 4 * 3 = 12. The perimeter of the 1st order curve is 12 * (1/2) = 6 units.\n\nFor the 2nd order Hilbert curve, the same process is repeated. Each side of the 1st order curve is divided into two equal parts, and a new segment is added between them. Now, for each side of the 1st order curve, we have 3 segments of length 1/4. Since there are 12 sides, the total number of segments in the 2nd order curve is 12 * 3 = 36. The perimeter of the 2nd order curve is 36 * (1/4) = 9 units.\n\nFinally, for the 3rd order Hilbert curve, we repeat the process again. Each side of the 2nd order curve is divided into two equal parts, and a new segment is added between them. Now, for each side of the 2nd order curve, we have 3 segments of length 1/8. Since there are 36 sides, the total number of segments in the 3rd order curve is 36 * 3 = 108. The perimeter of the 3rd order curve is 108 * (1/8) = 13.5 units.\n\nSo, the perimeter of a 3rd order Hilbert curve with each side of the first square (order 0) having a length of 1 unit is 13.5 units."
