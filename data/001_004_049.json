These numbers are 2 and 1.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the quadratic expression as:\nx^2 + 2x + x + 2\n\nStep 4: Group the terms and factor by grouping.\n(x^2 + 2x) + (x + 2)\n\nNow, factor out the common factors from each group:\nx(x + 2) + 1(x + 2)\n\nStep 5: Factor out the common binomial factor (x + 2).\n(x + 2)(x + 1)\n\nStep 6: Multiply the factored quadratic expression by the GCF that was factored out in Step 2.\n4(x + 2)(x + 1)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial expression 4x^2 + 12x + 8 is 4(x + 2)(x + 1)."
