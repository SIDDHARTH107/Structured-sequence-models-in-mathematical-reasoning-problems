    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 5 > 15, we need to isolate x:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality:\n2x + 5 - 5 > 15 - 5\n2x > 10\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the inequality by 2:\n2x / 2 > 10 / 2\nx > 5\n\nSo the solution to the inequality is x > 5.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line:\n\n1. Draw a number line with numbers from 0 to 10 (you can include more numbers if you want).\n2. Locate the number 5 on the number line.\n3. Since x > 5, we want all the numbers greater than 5. Make an open circle at 5 (to indicate that 5 is not included in the solution) and draw an arrow pointing to the right (towards the greater numbers).\n\nThe graph will look like this:\n\n<----0----1----2----3----4----(5)----6----7----8----9----10---->\n\nThe open circle at 5 and the arrow pointing to the right represent the solution x > 5."
