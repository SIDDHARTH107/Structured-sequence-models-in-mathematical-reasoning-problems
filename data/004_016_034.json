    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at that point, f'(c), is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, let f(x) represent the position of the car on the straight road at time x, where x is measured in hours. The car travels 50 miles in 1 hour, so we have the following information:\n\n- The function f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [0, 1] (since the car is always on the road).\n- The function f(x) is differentiable on the open interval (0, 1) (since the car's position is changing smoothly over time).\n\nNow, we want to find the average rate of change of the car's position over the interval [0, 1]. This is given by:\n\n(Change in position) / (Change in time) = (f(1) - f(0)) / (1 - 0)\n\nSince the car travels 50 miles in 1 hour, we have:\n\nf(1) - f(0) = 50 miles\n\nSo the average rate of change is:\n\n(50 miles) / (1 hour) = 50 miles per hour\n\nNow, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem. Since f(x) is continuous on [0, 1] and differentiable on (0, 1), there must exist a point c in the interval (0, 1) such that:\n\nf'(c) = 50 miles per hour\n\nf'(c) represents the instantaneous rate of change of the car's position at time c, which is the car's speed at that moment. Therefore, at some point during the trip (at time c), the car must have been traveling at exactly 50 miles per hour."
