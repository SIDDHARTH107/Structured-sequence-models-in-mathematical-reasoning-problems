    "message_1": "Using a simple substitution cipher where each letter of the alphabet is replaced by a different letter of the alphabet, if the letter \"A\" is replaced by the letter \"T\", what letter is \"C\" replaced with?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the pattern of the substitution cipher. Since \"A\" is replaced by \"T\", we can see that the substitution is shifting the letters by 19 positions forward in the alphabet (T is the 20th letter, and A is the 1st letter, so 20 - 1 = 19).\n\nNow, we need to find the letter that \"C\" is replaced with. C is the 3rd letter of the alphabet. Adding the shift of 19 positions, we get 3 + 19 = 22. The 22nd letter of the alphabet is \"V\". Therefore, \"C\" is replaced with the letter \"V\" in this substitution cipher."
