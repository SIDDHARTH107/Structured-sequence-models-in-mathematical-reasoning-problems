    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n6x^3 + 12x^2 = 6x^2(x + 2)\n\nDenominator:\n3x^2 + 15x = 3x(x + 5)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the rational expression as:\n\n(6x^2(x + 2)) / (3x(x + 5))\n\nNext, we can simplify by canceling out the common factors:\n\n(2x(x + 2)) / (x + 5)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n2x(x + 2) / (x + 5)"
