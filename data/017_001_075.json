    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 4. By the Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 4. Since there must be an identity element, let e be the identity element of G with order 1. Now, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nLet a be an element in G with order 4. Then, the powers of a are distinct and form a set {e, a, a^2, a^3}. Since G has 4 elements, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}. The group G is cyclic, generated by a, and is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4.\n\nCase 2: G has no elements of order 4.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let a and b be two distinct non-identity elements in G. Then, a^2 = e and b^2 = e. Since G has 4 elements, the last element must be the product of a and b, denoted by c = ab. Note that c cannot be equal to e, a, or b, otherwise, it would contradict the assumption that a and b have order 2. Now, we have G = {e, a, b, c}.\n\nWe will show that G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4 = {e, a, b, c} with the operation defined as the product of elements, where e is the identity, and a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e.\n\nFirst, we show that c^2 = e. Since a^2 = e and b^2 = e, we have (ab)^2 = a^2 * b^2 = e * e = e. Thus, c^2 = e.\n\nNext, we show that G is closed under the operation. We have the following products:\n- a * b = c (by definition)\n- b * a = ab (we need to show that this is equal to c)\n- a * c = a(ab) = a^2 * b = e * b = b\n- b * c = b(ab) = ba^2 = b * a (we need to show that this is equal to c)\n- c * a = (ab)a = a(ba) = a^2 * a = a\n- c * b = (ab)b = a(bb) = a * e = a\n\nNow, we show that ba = ab = c. Since a, b, and c have order 2, we have (ba)^2 = e. Thus, (ba)(ba) = e. We also know that a^2 = b^2 = e. Multiplying both sides by a, we get (ba)(ba)a = ea = a. Then, multiplying both sides by b, we get (ba)(ba)ab = ab. Thus, (ba)^2 = (ab)^2, and since both have order 2, ba = ab = c.\n\nNow, we have shown that G is closed under the operation, and all non-identity elements have order 2. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 4 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
