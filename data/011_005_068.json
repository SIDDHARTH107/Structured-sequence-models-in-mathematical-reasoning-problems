    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combinations formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of elements in the set and k is the number of elements we want to choose. However, in this case, we need to find the combinations that add up to 10.\n\nWe can list out the possible combinations of 3 integers that add up to 10:\n\n1. {1, 2, 7}\n2. {1, 3, 6}\n3. {1, 4, 5}\n4. {2, 3, 5}\n\nThere are 4 ways to select 3 different integers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} such that the sum of the three integers is 10."
