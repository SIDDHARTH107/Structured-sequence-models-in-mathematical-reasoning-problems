    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance between the ship and the shoreline as x meters. We can use the Law of Cosines to find the distance between the ship and the lighthouse when the ship is 400 meters away from the lighthouse.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, we have a triangle with sides a = 500 meters (distance from the lighthouse to the shoreline), b = x meters (distance from the ship to the shoreline), and c = 400 meters (distance between the ship and the lighthouse). The angle C is 30 degrees.\n\nWe can plug these values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\n400^2 = 500^2 + x^2 - 2 * 500 * x * cos(30)\n\n160000 = 250000 + x^2 - 1000x * (sqrt(3)/2)\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\nx^2 - 500 * sqrt(3) * x + 90000 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -500 * sqrt(3), and c = 90000.\n\nx = (500 * sqrt(3) ± sqrt((-500 * sqrt(3))^2 - 4 * 90000)) / 2\n\nx = (500 * sqrt(3) ± sqrt(750000 * 3 - 360000)) / 2\n\nx = (500 * sqrt(3) ± sqrt(2250000 - 360000)) / 2\n\nx = (500 * sqrt(3) ± sqrt(1890000)) / 2\n\nx ≈ (500 * sqrt(3) ± 1374.77) / 2\n\nThere are two possible values for x:\n\nx1 ≈ (500 * sqrt(3) + 1374.77) / 2 ≈ 1299.77 meters\nx2 ≈ (500 * sqrt(3) - 1374.77) / 2 ≈ -74.77 meters\n\nSince the distance cannot be negative, we can discard the second solution. Therefore, the distance between the ship and the shoreline when the ship is 400 meters away from the lighthouse is approximately 1299.77 meters."
