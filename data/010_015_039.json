    "message_2": "The de Rham cohomology groups of the unit sphere $S^2$ are given by:\n\n$H^0_{\\text{dR}}(S^2) = \\mathbb{R}$, $H^1_{\\text{dR}}(S^2) = 0$, and $H^2_{\\text{dR}}(S^2) = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTo find the dimension and basis of the second de Rham cohomology group $H^2_{\\text{dR}}(S^2)$, we can use the fact that the unit sphere $S^2$ can be covered by two coordinate charts, say the stereographic projections from the north and south poles. In each chart, we can find a non-vanishing 2-form, which is closed but not exact.\n\nFor example, in the chart around the north pole, we can use the spherical coordinates $(\\theta, \\phi)$, and the 2-form $\\omega = \\sin \\theta d\\theta \\wedge d\\phi$. This form is closed, as $d\\omega = 0$, but it is not exact, as its integral over the sphere is non-zero:\n\n$\\int_{S^2} \\omega = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin \\theta d\\theta d\\phi = 4\\pi \\neq 0$.\n\nThus, the dimension of $H^2_{\\text{dR}}(S^2)$ is 1, and a basis for this cohomology group is given by the equivalence class of the 2-form $\\omega = \\sin \\theta d\\theta \\wedge d\\phi$."
