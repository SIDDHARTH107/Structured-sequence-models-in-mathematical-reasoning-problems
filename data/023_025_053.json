    "message_2": "To find the Fourier Transform of the electron density function, we first need to define the electron density function itself. Since the electron density is given as a constant value (0.0025 electrons per cubic angstrom), the electron density function can be represented as a constant function:\n\nρ(x, y, z) = 0.0025 electrons/Å³\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier Transform of this constant function. The Fourier Transform of a function f(x, y, z) is given by:\n\nF(kx, ky, kz) = ∫∫∫ f(x, y, z) * exp(-2πi(kx*x + ky*y + kz*z)) dx dy dz\n\nwhere kx, ky, and kz are the spatial frequencies in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nSince the electron density function is a constant, the Fourier Transform becomes:\n\nF(kx, ky, kz) = 0.0025 * ∫∫∫ exp(-2πi(kx*x + ky*y + kz*z)) dx dy dz\n\nThis integral is separable into three integrals:\n\nF(kx, ky, kz) = 0.0025 * (∫ exp(-2πi*kx*x) dx) * (∫ exp(-2πi*ky*y) dy) * (∫ exp(-2πi*kz*z) dz)\n\nEach of these integrals is a sinc function:\n\nF(kx, ky, kz) = 0.0025 * sinc(π*kx) * sinc(π*ky) * sinc(π*kz)\n\nNow, we want to find the highest frequency present in the material. The highest frequency corresponds to the point where the sinc function goes to zero for the first time. The sinc function goes to zero when its argument is equal to π:\n\nπ*kx = π\nπ*ky = π\nπ*kz = π\n\nSolving for kx, ky, and kz, we get:\n\nkx = 1\nky = 1\nkz = 1\n\nThus, the highest frequency present in the material is (1, 1, 1) in reciprocal angstrom units."
