    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. To find the edge connectivity, we can use the following formula:\n\nEdge connectivity = min(λ(G), δ(G))\n\nwhere λ(G) is the minimum size of an edge cut (a set of edges whose removal disconnects the graph), and δ(G) is the minimum degree of the vertices in the graph.\n\nFirst, let's find the minimum degree δ(G). Since the graph has 8 vertices and 14 edges, the average degree of a vertex is (2 * 14) / 8 = 3.5. Since the degree of a vertex must be an integer, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or less. Therefore, δ(G) ≤ 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum size of an edge cut λ(G). Since the graph has 8 vertices, the maximum number of edges it can have without being disconnected is 8 * (8 - 1) / 2 = 28. However, our graph has only 14 edges, which is less than half of the maximum possible number of edges. This means that there must be at least one vertex whose removal would disconnect the graph. In other words, there must be at least one cut vertex. Removing the edges connected to this cut vertex would disconnect the graph, and since the minimum degree is at most 3, we can remove at most 3 edges to disconnect the graph.\n\nTherefore, λ(G) ≤ 3.\n\nNow, we can find the edge connectivity of the graph G:\n\nEdge connectivity = min(λ(G), δ(G)) = min(3, 3) = 3.\n\nSo, the edge connectivity of the graph G is 3."
