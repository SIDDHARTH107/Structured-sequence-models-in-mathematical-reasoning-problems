Find the divisors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n3. Determine the number of groups of each order using the formula n(G) = (number of groups of order G)\n\nFor each divisor d of 72, we need to find the number of groups of order d. We can use the following results from group theory:\n\n- For a prime power p^n, there are n(G) = 1 if n = 1, and n(G) = 2 if n = 2.\n- For a product of two distinct primes p and q, there are n(G) = 1 if p does not divide q-1, and n(G) = 2 if p divides q-1.\n\nUsing these results, we can find the number of groups of each order:\n\n- Order 1: n(G) = 1 (trivial group)\n- Order 2: n(G) = 1 (Z_2)\n- Order 3: n(G) = 1 (Z_3)\n- Order 4: n(G) = 2 (Z_4 and Z_2 x Z_2)\n- Order 6: n(G) = 2 (Z_6 and S_3)\n- Order 8: n(G) = 5 (Z_8, Z_2 x Z_4, Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2, D_4, and Q_8)\n- Order 9: n(G) = 2 (Z_9 and Z_3 x Z_3)\n- Order 12: n(G) = 5 (Z_12, Z_3 x Z_4, Z_2 x Z_6, A_4, and D_6)\n- Order 18: n(G) = 5 (Z_18, Z_3 x Z_6, Z_9 x Z_2, D_9, and S_3 x Z_3)\n- Order 24: n(G) = 15 (Z_24, Z_3 x Z_8, Z_4 x Z_6, Z_2 x Z_12, A_4 x Z_2, S_4, D_8 x Z_3, Q_8 x Z_3, D_12, Z_2 x A_4, Z_4 x S_3, Z_2 x D_6, Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_6, Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3 x Z_3, and Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3)\n- Order 36: n(G) = 14 (Z_36, Z_4 x Z_9, Z_3 x Z_12, Z_2 x Z_18, Z_6 x Z_6, Z_3 x Z_4 x Z_3, Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_9, Z_2 x Z_3 x Z_6, Z_2 x D_9, Z_2 x Z_3 x Z_3 x Z_2, Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3 x Z_3, Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3 x Z_2, Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3 x Z_2 x Z_2, and Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3)\n- Order 72: n(G) = 50 (too many to list)\n\nAdding up the number of groups of each order, we get:\n\n1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 15 + 14 + 50 = 103\n\nSo, there are 103 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
