    "message_2": "To find the number of students who play either football or basketball, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle states that to find the number of elements in the union of two sets, we need to add the number of elements in each set and subtract the number of elements in their intersection.\n\nIn this case, the number of students who play football is 40, the number of students who play basketball is 30, and the number of students who play both sports is 20.\n\nSo, the number of students who play either football or basketball is:\n\n40 (football) + 30 (basketball) - 20 (both) = 50 students."
