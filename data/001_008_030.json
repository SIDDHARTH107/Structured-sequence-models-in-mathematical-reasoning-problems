    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 5 < 22, we'll first isolate the variable x by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality:\n3x + 5 - 5 < 22 - 5\n3x < 17\n\n2. Divide both sides of the inequality by 3:\n3x/3 < 17/3\nx < 17/3\n\nSo the solution set to the inequality is x < 17/3.\n\nTo graph the solution on the number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a number line and mark the point 17/3 on it.\n\n2. Since the inequality is \"less than\" (x < 17/3), we'll use an open circle at the point 17/3 to indicate that the value 17/3 is not included in the solution set.\n\n3. Shade the region to the left of the open circle, indicating that all values of x less than 17/3 are part of the solution set.\n\nThe graph of the solution set on the number line will have an open circle at 17/3 and the region to the left of the open circle will be shaded."
