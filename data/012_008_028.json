    "message_2": "To determine if a graph G is planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nWe are given that the graph G has 10 vertices (v = 10) and 15 edges (e = 15). We can also use the inequality for planar graphs, which states that for a simple, connected, planar graph with at least 3 vertices:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for v and e:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nThe inequality holds true, so it is possible that the graph G is planar. However, this inequality is not a guarantee, so we cannot definitively conclude that the graph is planar without further information or a specific drawing of the graph."
