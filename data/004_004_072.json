    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x^2 between the values x = 1 and x = 3, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe integral of x^2 with respect to x is:\n\nâˆ«(x^2) dx = (x^3)/3 + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral at the limits x = 1 and x = 3:\n\n[(3^3)/3 - (1^3)/3] = [27/3 - 1/3] = 26/3\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = x^2 between x = 1 and x = 3 is 26/3 square units."
