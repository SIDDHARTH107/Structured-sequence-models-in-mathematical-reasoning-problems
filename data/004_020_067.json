    "message_2": "To calculate the work done by the crane, we need to find the force exerted by the crane in the direction of the displacement (vertical direction) and then multiply it by the displacement.\n\nFirst, let's find the gravitational force acting on the block:\nF_gravity = mass × g\nF_gravity = 100 kg × 9.8 m/s²\nF_gravity = 980 N\n\nNow, let's find the net force exerted by the crane in the vertical direction:\nF_net = F_crane - F_gravity\nF_net = 500 N - 980 N\nF_net = -480 N\n\nSince the net force is negative, it means that the crane is not able to lift the block. Therefore, the work done by the crane is 0 Joules."
