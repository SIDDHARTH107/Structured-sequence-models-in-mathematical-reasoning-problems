    "message_2": "To represent the height of a passenger on a Ferris wheel using a sinusoidal function, we can use the sine function. The general form of a sine function is:\n\nh(t) = A * sin(B(t - C)) + D\n\nwhere h(t) is the height of the passenger at time t, A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn this case, the Ferris wheel has a radius of 30 meters, so the amplitude A is equal to the radius, which is 30 meters. This is because the height of the passenger will oscillate between 0 and 60 meters, with the maximum height difference being 60 meters.\n\nThe period of the Ferris wheel is the time it takes to complete one full rotation, which is given as 60 seconds. The period is related to the frequency B by the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / B\n\nSo, we can find the frequency B as follows:\n\nB = 2π / Period = 2π / 60 = π / 30\n\nSince the passenger gets on at the bottom of the wheel, there is no phase shift (C = 0).\n\nThe vertical shift D is equal to the radius of the Ferris wheel because the height of the passenger oscillates around the center of the wheel, which is at a height of 30 meters.\n\nPutting all these values together, we get the sinusoidal function representing the height of the passenger over time:\n\nh(t) = 30 * sin(π/30 * t) + 30"
