    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\n\"An automotive company wants to maximize its profit by determining the optimal combination of two car models: Model X and Model Y. Model X has a profit of $15,000 per car sold, while Model Y has a profit of $12,000 per car sold. The company has a manufacturing capacity of 500 cars per month. Model X requires 12 labor hours and 8 mechanical hours to be produced, while Model Y requires 8 labor hours and 6 mechanical hours. To ensure quality production, labor hours cannot exceed 4,000 hours per month, and mechanical hours cannot exceed 2,800 hours per month. Using the Whale Optimization Algorithm, determine the number of cars of each model that should be produced to maximize the company's profit.\"",
    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm is a complex optimization algorithm that is not easily implemented in a text-based environment. However, we can solve this problem using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of Model X cars and y be the number of Model Y cars produced.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit):\nP = 15000x + 12000y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Manufacturing capacity: x + y <= 500\n2. Labor hours: 12x + 8y <= 4000\n3. Mechanical hours: 8x + 6y <= 2800\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method or by using a linear programming solver.\n\nGraphical method:\n1. Plot the constraints on a graph.\n2. Identify the feasible region.\n3. Find the vertices of the feasible region.\n4. Evaluate the objective function at each vertex.\n5. Choose the vertex with the highest objective function value.\n\nVertices of the feasible region:\nA: (0, 0)\nB: (0, 500)\nC: (250, 250)\nD: (333.33, 0)\n\nObjective function values:\nP(A) = 15000(0) + 12000(0) = $0\nP(B) = 15000(0) + 12000(500) = $6,000,000\nP(C) = 15000(250) + 12000(250) = $6,750,000\nP(D) = 15000(333.33) + 12000(0) = $5,000,000\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at vertex C, where 250 Model X cars and 250 Model Y cars are produced, resulting in a profit of $6,750,000."
