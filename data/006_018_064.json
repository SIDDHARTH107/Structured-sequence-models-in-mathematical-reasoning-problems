    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a certain type of financial fraud occurring in a company is 0.05. If an auditor randomly selects 10 companies to audit, what is the probability that at least one of them has had this type of financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one company has had this type of financial fraud, we can first find the probability that none of them have had this type of financial fraud and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single company has not had this type of financial fraud is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the auditor randomly selects 10 companies, the probability that none of them have had this type of financial fraud is 0.95^10.\n\n0.95^10 ≈ 0.5987\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that at least one company has had this type of financial fraud:\n\n1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the 10 companies has had this type of financial fraud is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
