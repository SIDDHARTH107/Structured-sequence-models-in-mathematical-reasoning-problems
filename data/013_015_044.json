    "message_1": "Suppose a company hires a manager to run their business. The company wants the manager to work diligently to maximize profits, but the manager may have their own goals and interests that don't align with those of the company. One way to align their interests is to provide a performance bonus to the manager.\n\nSuppose the company wants to incentivize the manager to increase profits by offering a bonus equal to 10% of the total profits if the profits exceed a certain threshold. The company estimates that if the manager puts in high effort, the profits will be $1,000,000, but if the manager puts in low effort, the profits will only be $500,000.\n\nIf the manager's high-effort cost is $500,000 and their low-effort cost is $250,000, what level of profits would the manager choose to maximize their expected payoff, assuming they are risk-neutral?",
    "message_2": "To find the level of profits the manager would choose to maximize their expected payoff, we need to compare the expected payoff for both high-effort and low-effort scenarios.\n\n1. High-effort scenario:\nExpected profits: $1,000,000\nManager's cost: $500,000\nBonus: 10% of profits if profits exceed the threshold\n\n2. Low-effort scenario:\nExpected profits: $500,000\nManager's cost: $250,000\nBonus: 10% of profits if profits exceed the threshold\n\nLet's denote the threshold as T. The manager will choose high-effort if the expected payoff from high-effort is greater than the expected payoff from low-effort.\n\nExpected payoff from high-effort = (Profits - Manager's cost + Bonus) = ($1,000,000 - $500,000 + 0.1 * ($1,000,000 - T)) = $500,000 + 0.1 * ($1,000,000 - T)\n\nExpected payoff from low-effort = (Profits - Manager's cost + Bonus) = ($500,000 - $250,000 + 0.1 * ($500,000 - T)) = $250,000 + 0.1 * ($500,000 - T)\n\nThe manager will choose high-effort if:\n\n$500,000 + 0.1 * ($1,000,000 - T) > $250,000 + 0.1 * ($500,000 - T)\n\nSimplifying the inequality:\n\n$250,000 > 0.1 * (T - $500,000)\n\nNow, we solve for T:\n\n$250,000 > 0.1 * (T - $500,000)\n$2,500,000 > T - $500,000\nT > $3,000,000\n\nSo, the manager will choose high-effort if the threshold is greater than $3,000,000. However, this threshold is not realistic, as the maximum profit in the high-effort scenario is $1,000,000. Therefore, the company should set the threshold at the maximum profit level of $1,000,000 to ensure the manager chooses the high-effort scenario to maximize their expected payoff."
