    "message_2": "To prove that G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (9 = 3^2), we know that G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, say P. By the Sylow theorems, P is normal in G. The order of P is 3^2 = 9.\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is abelian.\nIf G is abelian, then G is isomorphic to a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Since G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P, G is isomorphic to P. Since P has order 9, it must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C9.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian.\nIf G is non-abelian, then there must exist some element g in G that does not commute with all elements of P. Let H be the subgroup generated by g. Since g is not in P, the order of H must be a divisor of 9 that is not 1 or 9. The only possibility is that the order of H is 3.\n\nNow, consider the product set PH = {ph | p in P, h in H}. Since P and H are both normal in G, the product set PH is a subgroup of G. Furthermore, the order of PH is |P||H|/|P âˆ© H|, and since P and H have relatively prime orders, their intersection must be the identity element. Thus, |PH| = 9 * 3 / 1 = 27, which is not possible since the order of G is 9.\n\nThis contradiction implies that there is no non-abelian group of order 9. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C9.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9. However, we have shown that the non-abelian group of order 9 does not exist, so G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C9."
