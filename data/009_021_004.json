    "message_2": "Given the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = sin(πx)sin(πy), we can see that the solution u(x, y, t) at t = 0 is:\n\nu(x, y, 0) = sin(πx)sin(πy)\n\nNow, we need to find the solution at t = 0.25 seconds. To do this, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution u(x, y, t) can be written as a product of three functions:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nSubstitute this into the given partial differential equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = k (∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nX(x)Y(y)∂T(t)/∂t = k (X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t))\n\nNow, divide both sides by X(x)Y(y)T(t):\n\n(1/T(t)) ∂T(t)/∂t = k (X''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y))\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ:\n\n(1/T(t)) ∂T(t)/∂t = -λ\nX''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y) = -λ/k\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -λ₁\nY''(y)/Y(y) = -λ₂\n\nwhere λ₁ + λ₂ = λ/k.\n\nSolving these ODEs, we get:\n\nX(x) = A₁sin(√λ₁x) + B₁cos(√λ₁x)\nY(y) = A₂sin(√λ₂y) + B₂cos(√λ₂y)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0, y, t) = u(1, y, t) = 0\nu(x, 0, t) = u(x, 1, t) = 0\n\nWe get:\n\nB₁ = 0, A₁ ≠ 0, λ₁ = (nπ)² for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\nB₂ = 0, A₂ ≠ 0, λ₂ = (mπ)² for m = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSo, the solution takes the form:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑∑(A_nm sin(nπx)sin(mπy)T_nm(t))\n\nNow, we need to find T_nm(t) and the coefficients A_nm. Using the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = sin(πx)sin(πy), we can see that A_11 = 1 and all other A_nm = 0.\n\nThe equation for T(t) is:\n\n(1/T(t)) ∂T(t)/∂t = -λ\n\nFor n = 1, m = 1, we have λ = (π² + π²)/k = 2π². Thus:\n\n(1/T_11(t)) ∂T_11(t)/∂t = -2π²\n\nSolving this ODE, we get:\n\nT_11(t) = C₁e^(-2π²t)\n\nSince T_11(0) = 1, we have C₁ = 1. Therefore, the solution u(x, y, t) is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = sin(πx)sin(πy)e^(-2π²t)\n\nFinally, we can find the solution at t = 0.25 seconds:\n\nu(x, y, 0.25) = sin(πx)sin(πy)e^(-2π²(0.25))"
