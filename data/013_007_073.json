    "message_1": "A field has 100 acres of land that is shared by 10 farmers. Each farmer can graze a maximum of 20 cows and each cow needs 2 acres of land to graze. If each farmer decides to graze as many cows as possible, what is the tragedy of the commons and how many cows will be grazing in total?",
    "message_2": "The tragedy of the commons is an economic problem in which every individual tries to reap the greatest benefit from a shared resource. As a result, the shared resource is depleted, leading to a decrease in overall benefit for the group.\n\nIn this case, the shared resource is the 100 acres of land. If each farmer decides to graze as many cows as possible (20 cows per farmer), they would need 2 acres of land per cow, which means each farmer would need 40 acres of land (20 cows * 2 acres per cow). However, there are only 100 acres available, and 10 farmers would need a total of 400 acres (10 farmers * 40 acres per farmer) to graze their cows.\n\nSince there are not enough acres for each farmer to graze 20 cows, they will have to share the available land. The 100 acres can support a total of 50 cows (100 acres / 2 acres per cow). If the farmers evenly distribute the land, each farmer can graze 5 cows (50 cows / 10 farmers).\n\nThe tragedy of the commons in this situation is that the farmers, by trying to graze as many cows as possible, end up depleting the shared resource (land) and reducing the overall benefit for the group. In this case, the total number of cows that can graze is 50, which is less than the maximum possible number of cows (20 cows per farmer * 10 farmers = 200 cows) if there were enough land for each farmer to graze their maximum number of cows."
