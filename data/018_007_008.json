    "message_2": "The power set of S, denoted as P(S), is the set of all possible subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself. To find the power set of S, we can list all the possible subsets:\n\n1. The empty set: {}\n2. Single-element subsets: {1}, {2}, {3}\n3. Two-element subsets: {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}\n4. The entire set S: {1, 2, 3}\n\nSo, the power set of S is P(S) = { {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3} }.\n\nNow, let's prove that the power set of S is always larger than S itself. \n\nFor any set S with n elements, the power set P(S) will have 2^n elements. This is because each element in S can either be included or not included in a subset, resulting in 2 possibilities for each element. Therefore, there are 2^n possible subsets in the power set.\n\nSince 2^n is always greater than n for any positive integer n, the power set P(S) will always be larger than S itself. In our example, S has 3 elements, so the power set P(S) has 2^3 = 8 elements, which is indeed larger than the size of S."
