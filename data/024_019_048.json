    "message_2": "To find the total Gaussian curvature of the surface S using the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, we first need to compute the Gaussian curvature K at each point on the surface. Then, we'll integrate K over the given domain.\n\nThe Gaussian curvature K is given by the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2),\n\nwhere E, F, G, L, M, and N are coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nFirst, we need to find the coefficients of the first fundamental form. Let's parameterize the surface S by the map:\n\nφ(u, v) = (u, v, 3u^2 + 2v^2),\n\nwhere u = x and v = y.\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\nφ_u = ∂φ/∂u = (1, 0, 6u),\nφ_v = ∂φ/∂v = (0, 1, 4v).\n\nThen, we can find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = <φ_u, φ_u> = 1 + 36u^2,\nF = <φ_u, φ_v> = 24uv,\nG = <φ_v, φ_v> = 1 + 16v^2.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficients of the second fundamental form. We compute the unit normal vector N:\n\nN = φ_u × φ_v / ||φ_u × φ_v|| = (-6u, -4v, 1) / sqrt(1 + 36u^2 + 16v^2).\n\nNow, we compute the second derivatives:\n\nφ_uu = ∂^2φ/∂u^2 = (0, 0, 6),\nφ_uv = ∂^2φ/∂u∂v = (0, 0, 0),\nφ_vv = ∂^2φ/∂v^2 = (0, 0, 4).\n\nThen, we can find the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = <φ_uu, N> = 6 / sqrt(1 + 36u^2 + 16v^2),\nM = <φ_uv, N> = 0,\nN = <φ_vv, N> = 4 / sqrt(1 + 36u^2 + 16v^2).\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2) = (24 / (1 + 36u^2 + 16v^2)) / ((1 + 36u^2)(1 + 16v^2) - (24uv)^2).\n\nFinally, we integrate K over the given domain:\n\nTotal Gaussian curvature = ∬_D K dA = ∬_(u=-1)^(1) ∬_(v=-2)^(2) K du dv.\n\nUsing a symbolic computation tool or numerical integration methods, we can approximate the total Gaussian curvature over the given domain."
