    "message_2": "A standard deck of cards has 52 cards, with 13 cards in each of the four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades). To find the probability that all three cards drawn are diamonds, we can use the formula for probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw three diamonds from the 13 diamonds in the deck. This can be calculated using combinations:\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * (13-3)!) = 286\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw any three cards from the 52-card deck:\n\nC(52, 3) = 52! / (3! * (52-3)!) = 22100\n\nNow, we can find the probability:\n\nProbability = 286 / 22100 â‰ˆ 0.01294\n\nSo, the probability that all three cards drawn are diamonds is approximately 1.29%."
