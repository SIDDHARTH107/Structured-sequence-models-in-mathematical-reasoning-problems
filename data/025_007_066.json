For a compact Riemann surface of genus g, we have the following formula for the dimension of the first cohomology group with coefficients in the sheaf of holomorphic functions:\n\n$\\dim H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}) = g$\n\nIn our case, since the genus g is 0, we have:\n\n$\\dim H^1(\\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}, \\mathcal{O}) = 0$\n\nThis means that $H^1(\\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}, \\mathcal{O})$ is the trivial group, and there are no non-zero elements in this cohomology group."
