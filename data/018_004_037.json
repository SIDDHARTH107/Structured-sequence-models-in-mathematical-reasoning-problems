    "message_1": "Let A be a set with 10 elements and its complement is denoted by A'. If B is another set with 10 elements such that B' is the complement of A, what is the relationship between A and B? Can A and B be different sets or they must be identical? Justify your answer using the concept of the uniqueness of the complement of a set.",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. A is a set with 10 elements.\n2. A' is the complement of A.\n3. B is another set with 10 elements.\n4. B' is the complement of A.\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer that A and B have the same number of elements (10 elements each). Also, since B' is the complement of A, it means that B' and A' are the same set. \n\nNow, let's use the concept of the uniqueness of the complement of a set. The uniqueness of the complement of a set states that a set can have only one unique complement. In other words, if two sets have the same complement, then the two sets must be identical.\n\nSince A' and B' are the same set (complement of A), it implies that A and B must be identical sets. Therefore, A and B cannot be different sets, and they must be identical."
