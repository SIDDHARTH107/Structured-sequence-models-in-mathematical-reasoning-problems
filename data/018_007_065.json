    "message_1": "Let A be a set, and let n be the number of elements in A. Calculate the number of elements in the power set of A, and show that this number is always greater than n.",
    "message_2": "The power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. To calculate the number of elements in the power set of A, we can think of each element in A as having two possibilities: either it is included in a subset or it is not included. Therefore, for each of the n elements in A, there are 2 choices. \n\nSo, the total number of subsets (i.e., the number of elements in the power set of A) is given by the product of these choices: 2 * 2 * ... * 2 (n times), which is equal to 2^n.\n\nNow, we want to show that 2^n is always greater than n. We can prove this by induction.\n\nBase case: n = 1\n2^1 = 2, which is greater than 1.\n\nInductive step:\nAssume that 2^k > k for some positive integer k.\nNow, we want to show that 2^(k+1) > (k+1).\n\n2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k (by the properties of exponents)\nSince 2^k > k (by our assumption), we have:\n2 * 2^k > 2 * k\n\nNow, we need to show that 2 * k > k + 1. This is true if k > 1, because:\n2 * k > k + 1\nk > 1\n\nSince our base case covered n = 1, and our inductive step showed that the statement holds for all k > 1, we can conclude that 2^n is always greater than n for all positive integers n.\n\nThus, the number of elements in the power set of A, which is 2^n, is always greater than the number of elements in A, which is n."
