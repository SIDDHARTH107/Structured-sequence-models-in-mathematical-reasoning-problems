    "message_2": "To find the order of the elliptic curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over the finite field F(17), we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Count the number of points on the curve, including the point at infinity.\n2. Apply Hasse's theorem to verify the result.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of points on the curve. We will iterate through all possible x and y values in F(17) and check if they satisfy the equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2.\n\nHere's a table of the points on the curve:\n\nx | y\n--|--\n0 | 6, 11\n1 | 3, 14\n2 | 1, 16\n3 | 6, 11\n4 | 4, 13\n5 | 7, 10\n6 | 2, 15\n7 | 3, 14\n8 | 5, 12\n9 | 1, 16\n10 | 7, 10\n11 | 5, 12\n12 | 4, 13\n13 | 2, 15\n14 | 6, 11\n15 | 1, 16\n16 | 3, 14\n\nThere are 17 pairs of (x, y) points on the curve, plus the point at infinity. So, there are 18 points in total.\n\nNow, let's apply Hasse's theorem, which states that the order of an elliptic curve over a finite field F(p) is bounded by the following inequality:\n\np + 1 - 2√p ≤ order ≤ p + 1 + 2√p\n\nIn our case, p = 17. So, we have:\n\n17 + 1 - 2√17 ≤ order ≤ 17 + 1 + 2√17\n2.56 ≤ order ≤ 31.44\n\nSince the order must be an integer, we have:\n\n3 ≤ order ≤ 31\n\nWe found that the order of the elliptic curve is 18, which is within the bounds given by Hasse's theorem. Therefore, the order of the elliptic curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over the finite field F(17) is 18."
