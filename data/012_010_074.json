    "message_2": "A minimum vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set, and the set has the smallest possible number of vertices.\n\nWe can find a minimum vertex cover for this graph using the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the vertices with the highest degree (most connected edges). In this case, vertices 2, 3, and 5 have the highest degree (4, 3, and 3, respectively).\n\n2. Add the vertex with the highest degree to the vertex cover set. If there is a tie, choose any of them. Let's choose vertex 2.\n\n3. Remove all edges connected to the chosen vertex (vertex 2). The remaining edges are:\n\n   3 -- 6\n\n   5 -- 6\n\n   6 -- 7\n\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the remaining edges. Now, vertex 6 has the highest degree (3). Add vertex 6 to the vertex cover set and remove its connected edges. There are no remaining edges.\n\nThe minimum vertex cover for this graph is {2, 6}."
