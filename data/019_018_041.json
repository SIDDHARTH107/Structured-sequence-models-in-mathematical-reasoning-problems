    "message_2": "To prove that the square root of 2 is an irrational number, we will use proof by contradiction. We will assume that the square root of 2 is a rational number and show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssume that the square root of 2 is a rational number. Then, it can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1 (i.e., a and b are coprime), and b is not equal to 0.\n\n(√2 = a/b)\n\nNow, let's square both sides of the equation:\n\n(√2)^2 = (a/b)^2\n2 = a^2 / b^2\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate a^2:\n\n2 * b^2 = a^2\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that a^2 is an even number (since it is equal to 2 times another integer). Therefore, a must also be an even number (since the square of an odd number is always odd). Let's say a = 2k, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, substitute a = 2k back into the equation:\n\n2 * b^2 = (2k)^2\n2 * b^2 = 4 * k^2\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nb^2 = 2 * k^2\n\nNow, we see that b^2 is also an even number (since it is equal to 2 times another integer). Therefore, b must also be an even number (since the square of an odd number is always odd).\n\nHowever, we initially assumed that a and b have no common factors other than 1 (i.e., they are coprime). But now we have shown that both a and b are even numbers, which means they have a common factor of 2. This is a contradiction.\n\nSince our assumption that the square root of 2 is a rational number led to a contradiction, we can conclude that the square root of 2 is an irrational number."
