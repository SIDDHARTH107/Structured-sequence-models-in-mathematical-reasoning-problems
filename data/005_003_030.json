They collect the following data:\n\n| Hours studied per day | Test score |\n|----------------------|------------|\n| 2                    | 75         |\n| 1                    | 60         |\n| 3                    | 85         |\n| 4                    | 95         |\n\nThe researcher wants to know the equation of the regression line that can be used to predict the test score based on the number of hours studied per day. What is the equation of the regression line?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the regression line, we will use the least squares method. First, we need to find the means of the x (hours studied) and y (test score) values:\n\nx_mean = (2 + 1 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5\ny_mean = (75 + 60 + 85 + 95) / 4 = 315 / 4 = 78.75\n\nNext, we need to find the slope (b1) and the y-intercept (b0) of the regression line using the following formulas:\n\nb1 = Σ[(xi - x_mean) * (yi - y_mean)] / Σ(xi - x_mean)^2\nb0 = y_mean - b1 * x_mean\n\nCalculating b1:\n\nΣ[(xi - x_mean) * (yi - y_mean)] = (2 - 2.5) * (75 - 78.75) + (1 - 2.5) * (60 - 78.75) + (3 - 2.5) * (85 - 78.75) + (4 - 2.5) * (95 - 78.75) = -1.875 + 28.125 + 6.25 + 40.625 = 73.125\n\nΣ(xi - x_mean)^2 = (2 - 2.5)^2 + (1 - 2.5)^2 + (3 - 2.5)^2 + (4 - 2.5)^2 = 0.25 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 = 5\n\nb1 = 73.125 / 5 = 14.625\n\nCalculating b0:\n\nb0 = y_mean - b1 * x_mean = 78.75 - 14.625 * 2.5 = 78.75 - 36.5625 = 42.1875\n\nSo, the equation of the regression line is:\n\ny = 14.625x + 42.1875"
