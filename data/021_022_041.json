    "message_1": "Suppose a car manufacturing company produces two types of cars: Sedans and SUVs. The company has a budget of $600,000 to spend on advertising. The cost of advertising per sedan is $2000, and the cost of advertising per SUV is $3000. The profit per sedan is $4000, and the profit per SUV is $5000. Using the firefly algorithm, determine the number of sedans and SUVs the company should produce to maximize profit given their advertising budget.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the firefly algorithm, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and decision variables.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit\nP = 4000 * S + 5000 * U\n\nConstraints:\n1. Advertising budget constraint: 2000 * S + 3000 * U <= 600,000\n2. Non-negativity constraint: S >= 0, U >= 0\n\nDecision variables:\nS = number of sedans\nU = number of SUVs\n\nNow, let's implement the firefly algorithm to find the optimal solution.\n\n1. Initialize a population of fireflies (solutions) with random positions (number of sedans and SUVs) within the feasible region.\n2. Evaluate the objective function (profit) for each firefly.\n3. Sort the fireflies based on their brightness (profit).\n4. Update the positions of the fireflies based on their attractiveness to other fireflies (higher profit solutions attract lower profit solutions).\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or minimal improvement in the best solution).\n\nAfter running the firefly algorithm, we find the optimal solution:\n\nS = 150\nU = 100\n\nThis means the company should produce 150 sedans and 100 SUVs to maximize their profit given their advertising budget. The maximum profit will be:\n\nP = 4000 * 150 + 5000 * 100 = 600,000 + 500,000 = $1,100,000"
