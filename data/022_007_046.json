    "message_2": "To show that f is a polynomial of degree at most 1, we will use Liouville's theorem, which states that every bounded entire function is constant.\n\nFirst, note that f(0) = 0, since |f(0)| ≤ |0| implies f(0) = 0.\n\nNow, consider the function g(z) = f(z)/z for z ≠ 0 and g(0) = f'(0). Since f is entire, g is also analytic on ℂ except possibly at z = 0. We will show that g has a removable singularity at z = 0, which will imply that g is entire.\n\nTo show that g has a removable singularity at z = 0, we need to show that the limit of g(z) as z approaches 0 exists. By the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the fact that f is entire, f'(z) exists for all z ∈ ℂ. Thus, we have:\n\nlim (z -> 0) g(z) = lim (z -> 0) f(z)/z = f'(0).\n\nSince f'(0) is a complex number, the limit exists, and g has a removable singularity at z = 0. Therefore, g is entire.\n\nNow, we have |g(z)| = |f(z)/z| ≤ 1 for all z ∈ ℂ. By Liouville's theorem, g must be constant, say g(z) = c for all z ∈ ℂ. Then, f(z) = c * z for all z ∈ ℂ, which means f is a polynomial of degree at most 1.\n\nFor the alternative statement, let f(z) be a non-constant polynomial in ℂ[z] such that f(z) = 0 has no solutions in ℂ. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, every non-constant polynomial has at least one root in ℂ. This contradicts the assumption that f(z) = 0 has no solutions in ℂ. Therefore, there exist no non-constant polynomials f(z) ∈ ℂ[z] such that f(z) = 0 has no solutions in ℂ."
