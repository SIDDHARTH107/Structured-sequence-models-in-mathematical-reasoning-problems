    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly three heads when flipping a fair coin six times, we can use Pascal's Triangle. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The rows of Pascal's Triangle represent the coefficients of the binomial expansion, which can be used to calculate probabilities.\n\nHere's Pascal's Triangle up to the 6th row:\n\n```\n          1\n         1 1\n        1 2 1\n       1 3 3 1\n      1 4 6 4 1\n     1 5 10 10 5 1\n```\n\nThe 6th row represents the coefficients for the binomial expansion of (H + T)^6, where H represents heads and T represents tails. Since we want to find the probability of getting exactly three heads, we can look at the coefficient for the H^3 * T^3 term, which is 20.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the probability. Since the coin is fair, the probability of getting heads (H) is 1/2, and the probability of getting tails (T) is also 1/2. So, the probability of getting exactly three heads in six flips is:\n\nP(3H, 3T) = (20) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^3 = 20 * (1/8) * (1/8) = 20/64 = 5/16\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting exactly three heads when flipping a fair coin six times is 5/16 or approximately 0.3125."
