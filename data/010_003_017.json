If A is a closed subset of X and U is an open set containing A, prove that there is an open set V containing A such that the closure of V is contained in U. \n\nAdditionally, provide an example where X is a topological space that satisfies the given condition.",
    "message_2": "Proof:\n\nSince A is a closed subset of X, by the given condition, there exists a metric space Y and a closed set B in Y such that A = X ∩ B. Let d be the metric on Y. Now, U is an open set containing A, so for each point x ∈ A, there exists an open ball B(x, r_x) in X with radius r_x > 0 such that x ∈ B(x, r_x) ⊆ U. \n\nDefine V = ⋃_{x ∈ A} B(x, r_x/2). V is an open set containing A, as it is a union of open balls. We will now show that the closure of V, denoted by cl(V), is contained in U.\n\nLet y ∈ cl(V). Then, for each open neighborhood W of y, W ∩ V ≠ ∅. In particular, for each x ∈ A, consider the open ball B(x, r_x/2) in Y. Since y ∈ cl(V), there exists z ∈ B(x, r_x/2) ∩ V. Thus, d(x, z) < r_x/2 and d(z, y) < r_x/2 (as z ∈ B(x, r_x/2) and y ∈ B(z, r_x/2)).\n\nBy the triangle inequality, d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y) < r_x/2 + r_x/2 = r_x. Therefore, y ∈ B(x, r_x) ⊆ U for each x ∈ A. Since A is closed and y is an arbitrary point in cl(V), we have cl(V) ⊆ U.\n\nExample:\n\nConsider the subspace X of the Euclidean plane ℝ² consisting of all points (x, y) such that either x = 0 or y = 0. X is a topological space with the subspace topology inherited from ℝ². Every closed set in X is the intersection of X with a closed set in ℝ², which is a metric space. Thus, X satisfies the given condition."
