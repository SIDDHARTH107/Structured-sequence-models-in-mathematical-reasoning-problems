The composite material has a thickness of 2 cm and a length of 50 cm. Find the Fourier series representation of the temperature distribution along the composite material when a temperature difference of 100°C is maintained along the length of the material.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of the temperature distribution along the composite material, we first need to determine the heat transfer through the composite material. We can do this by applying Fourier's law of heat conduction, which states that the rate of heat transfer (Q) through a material is proportional to the temperature gradient and the material's thermal conductivity (k).\n\nFor a composite material, the equivalent thermal conductivity (k_eq) can be found using the formula:\n\n1/k_eq = (t_1/k_1) + (t_2/k_2)\n\nwhere t_1 and t_2 are the thicknesses of the two materials, and k_1 and k_2 are their respective thermal conductivities.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nt_1 = t_2 = 1 cm (assuming equal thicknesses for both materials)\nk_1 = 20 W/mK\nk_2 = 5 W/mK\n\nConverting the thicknesses to meters:\n\nt_1 = t_2 = 0.01 m\n\nNow, we can find the equivalent thermal conductivity:\n\n1/k_eq = (0.01/20) + (0.01/5)\n1/k_eq = 0.0005 + 0.002\nk_eq = 1/0.0025\nk_eq = 400 W/mK\n\nNow that we have the equivalent thermal conductivity, we can find the heat transfer (Q) using Fourier's law:\n\nQ = -k_eq * A * (dT/dx)\n\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the composite material, dT is the temperature difference, and dx is the length of the material.\n\nGiven:\n\nA = 0.02 m * 0.5 m = 0.01 m^2 (assuming the thickness is 2 cm and the width is 50 cm)\ndT = 100°C\ndx = 0.5 m\n\nNow, we can find the heat transfer:\n\nQ = -400 * 0.01 * (100/0.5)\nQ = -400 * 0.01 * 200\nQ = -800 W\n\nNow that we have the heat transfer, we can find the temperature distribution along the composite material using the Fourier series representation:\n\nT(x) = T_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * π * x / L) + b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere T_0 is the average temperature, a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and L is the length of the material.\n\nSince the temperature difference is maintained along the length of the material, the temperature distribution will be linear. Therefore, the Fourier series representation will only have the first term (n = 1) with a non-zero coefficient:\n\nT(x) = T_0 + a_1 * cos(π * x / L)\n\nTo find the coefficient a_1, we can use the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0) = T_0 + a_1 * cos(0) = T_0 + a_1\nT(L) = T_0 + a_1 * cos(π) = T_0 - a_1\n\nSince the temperature difference is 100°C, we have:\n\nT_0 - a_1 - (T_0 + a_1) = 100\n-2 * a_1 = 100\n\nSolving for a_1:\n\na_1 = -50\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of the temperature distribution along the composite material:\n\nT(x) = T_0 - 50 * cos(π * x / L)\n\nThis equation represents the temperature distribution along the composite material when a temperature difference of 100°C is maintained along the length of the material."
