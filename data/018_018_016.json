    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection: A Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nGiven A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B.\n\nFirst, we find the union of A and B:\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNext, we find the intersection of A and B:\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we subtract the intersection from the union to find the symmetric difference:\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of A and B is {1, 4}.\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference is commutative. To do this, we need to show that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nWe already found A Δ B = {1, 4}. Now let's find B Δ A:\n\nFirst, we find the union of B and A:\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNext, we find the intersection of B and A:\nB ∩ A = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we subtract the intersection from the union to find the symmetric difference:\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nSo, B Δ A = {1, 4}.\n\nSince A Δ B = {1, 4} and B Δ A = {1, 4}, we can conclude that the symmetric difference is commutative."
