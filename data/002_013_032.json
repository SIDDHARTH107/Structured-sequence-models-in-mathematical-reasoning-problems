    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base that measures 6 meters by 8 meters and a height of 10 meters. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × Base Area × Height\n\nThe base area of the pyramid is the area of the rectangle, which can be found using the formula:\n\nBase Area = Length × Width\n\nIn this case, the length is 6 meters and the width is 8 meters. So, the base area is:\n\nBase Area = 6 m × 8 m = 48 m²\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the pyramid using the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × Base Area × Height\nVolume = (1/3) × 48 m² × 10 m\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 480 m³\nVolume = 160 m³\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 160 cubic meters."
