    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 6 cm and two parallel sides measuring 10 cm and 15 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height\n\nIn this case, the parallel sides are 10 cm and 15 cm, and the height is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (10 + 15) * 6\nArea = (1/2) * 25 * 6\nArea = 12.5 * 6\nArea = 75 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 75 square centimeters."
