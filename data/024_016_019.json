    "message_2": "To find the covariant derivative of the smooth tensor field S along the vector field V, we will use the following formula:\n\n∇_V(S) = V^i ∇_i(S)\n\nwhere ∇_i is the covariant derivative with respect to the coordinate basis vector ∂/∂x^i, and V^i are the components of the vector field V.\n\nGiven V(x,y,z) = xi + yj + zk, we have:\n\nV^1 = x\nV^2 = y\nV^3 = z\n\nNow, we need to compute the covariant derivatives of S with respect to the coordinate basis vectors. Since S is a smooth tensor field, we can write it as:\n\nS = S^ij ∂/∂x^i ⊗ ∂/∂x^j\n\nwhere S^ij are the components of the tensor field S. We are given that (S(JK)) = 8xy, which means that S^12 = S^21 = 4xy (since S(JK) = 2S^12). All other components of S are zero.\n\nNow, let's compute the covariant derivatives of S with respect to the coordinate basis vectors:\n\n∇_1(S) = ∂(S^12)/∂x^1 ∂/∂x^1 ⊗ ∂/∂x^2 + ∂(S^21)/∂x^1 ∂/∂x^2 ⊗ ∂/∂x^1\n       = (4y) ∂/∂x^1 ⊗ ∂/∂x^2 + (4y) ∂/∂x^2 ⊗ ∂/∂x^1\n\n∇_2(S) = ∂(S^12)/∂x^2 ∂/∂x^1 ⊗ ∂/∂x^2 + ∂(S^21)/∂x^2 ∂/∂x^2 ⊗ ∂/∂x^1\n       = (4x) ∂/∂x^1 ⊗ ∂/∂x^2 + (4x) ∂/∂x^2 ⊗ ∂/∂x^1\n\n∇_3(S) = 0 (since S has no components in the z direction)\n\nNow, we can compute the covariant derivative of S along the vector field V:\n\n∇_V(S) = V^i ∇_i(S) = x ∇_1(S) + y ∇_2(S) + z ∇_3(S)\n       = x(4y) ∂/∂x^1 ⊗ ∂/∂x^2 + x(4y) ∂/∂x^2 ⊗ ∂/∂x^1 + y(4x) ∂/∂x^1 ⊗ ∂/∂x^2 + y(4x) ∂/∂x^2 ⊗ ∂/∂x^1\n\nAt the point (1,2,3), we have:\n\n∇_V(S) = 1(8) ∂/∂x^1 ⊗ ∂/∂x^2 + 1(8) ∂/∂x^2 ⊗ ∂/∂x^1 + 2(4) ∂/∂x^1 ⊗ ∂/∂x^2 + 2(4) ∂/∂x^2 ⊗ ∂/∂x^1\n       = 8 ∂/∂x^1 ⊗ ∂/∂x^2 + 8 ∂/∂x^2 ⊗ ∂/∂x^1 + 8 ∂/∂x^1 ⊗ ∂/∂x^2 + 8 ∂/∂x^2 ⊗ ∂/∂x^1\n       = 16 ∂/∂x^1 ⊗ ∂/∂x^2 + 16 ∂/∂x^2 ⊗ ∂/∂x^1\n\nSo, the covariant derivative of S along the vector field V at the point (1,2,3) is:\n\n∇_V(S) = 16 ∂/∂x^1 ⊗ ∂/∂x^2 + 16 ∂/∂x^2 ⊗ ∂/∂x^1\n\nExpressed in terms of the Levi-Civita connection of M, this is:\n\n∇_V(S) = 16 Γ^1_12 ∂/∂x^1 ⊗ ∂/∂x^2 + 16 Γ^2_21 ∂/∂x^2 ⊗ ∂/∂x^1"
