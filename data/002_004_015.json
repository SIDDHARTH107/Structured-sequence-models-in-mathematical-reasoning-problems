    "message_1": "A rectangular shaped tennis court measures 78 feet in length and 27 feet in width. What is the perimeter of the tennis court?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you can use the formula P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, the length (L) is 78 feet and the width (W) is 27 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 2(78 + 27)\nP = 2(105)\nP = 210\n\nThe perimeter of the tennis court is 210 feet."
