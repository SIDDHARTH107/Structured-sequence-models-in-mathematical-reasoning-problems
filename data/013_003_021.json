    "message_1": "In an ultimatum game involving two players A and B, A proposes to split $10 between them. If B accepts the proposal, they each get their share, but if B rejects, neither player gets anything. What is the most rational way for A to propose the split, assuming that B will only accept a proposal that gives them at least $4?",
    "message_2": "Since B will only accept a proposal that gives them at least $4, the most rational way for A to propose the split is to offer B $4 and keep $6 for themselves. This way, B gets the minimum amount they are willing to accept, and A maximizes their own share of the money. The proposal would be: A gets $6 and B gets $4."
