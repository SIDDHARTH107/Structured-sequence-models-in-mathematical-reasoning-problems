    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer x such that 3^x ≡ 12 (mod 17), we can use the method of successive squaring and modular exponentiation. We will calculate the powers of 3 modulo 17 until we find one that is congruent to 12.\n\n1. 3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 17)\n2. 3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n3. 3^3 ≡ 27 ≡ 10 (mod 17)\n4. 3^4 ≡ 81 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n5. 3^5 ≡ 243 ≡ 12 (mod 17)\n\nWe found that 3^5 ≡ 12 (mod 17). Therefore, the smallest positive integer x is 5."
