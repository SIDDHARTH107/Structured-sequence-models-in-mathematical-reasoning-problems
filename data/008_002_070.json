    "message_2": "To find the inverse of matrix A, we first need to find the determinant of A. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix is calculated as follows:\n\ndet(A) = ad - bc, where A = [[a, b], [c, d]]\n\nIn our case, A = [[3, 7], [2, 5]], so:\n\ndet(A) = (3 * 5) - (2 * 7) = 15 - 14 = 1\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix is given by:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * [[d, -b], [-c, a]]\n\nSo, the inverse of A is:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/1) * [[5, -7], [-2, 3]] = [[5, -7], [-2, 3]]\n\nNow, we can use the inverse of A to solve the system of linear equations. The system can be represented as a matrix equation:\n\nA * X = B\n\nWhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables [x, y], and B is the column matrix of constants. In our case:\n\nA = [[3, 7], [2, 5]]\nX = [[x], [y]]\nB = [[2], [3]]\n\nTo solve for X, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the inverse of A:\n\nA^(-1) * A * X = A^(-1) * B\n\nSince A^(-1) * A is the identity matrix I, we get:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nNow, we can multiply the inverse of A by B:\n\nX = [[5, -7], [-2, 3]] * [[2], [3]]\n\nTo perform matrix multiplication, we get:\n\nx = (5 * 2) + (-7 * 3) = 10 - 21 = -11\ny = (-2 * 2) + (3 * 3) = -4 + 9 = 5\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -11 and y = 5."
