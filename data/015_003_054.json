    "message_2": "The logistic map is defined by the equation:\n\nx(n+1) = r * x(n) * (1 - x(n))\n\nGiven r = 2.5 and x(0) = 0.5, we can find the first value of the logistic map, x(1), using the equation:\n\nx(1) = 2.5 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5)\n\nx(1) = 2.5 * 0.5 * 0.5\n\nx(1) = 1.25 * 0.5\n\nx(1) = 0.625\n\nSo, the first value of the logistic map when r = 2.5 and x = 0.5 is 0.625."
