    "message_2": "To partition a set of 7 elements into subsets of sizes 2, 2, and 3, we can use the following method:\n\n1. Choose 3 elements out of 7 for the subset of size 3. This can be done in C(7,3) ways, where C(n,k) denotes the number of combinations of choosing k elements from a set of n elements. C(7,3) = 7! / (3! * (7-3)!) = 35 ways.\n\n2. Now, we have 4 elements left. Choose 2 elements out of these 4 for the first subset of size 2. This can be done in C(4,2) ways. C(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6 ways.\n\n3. The remaining 2 elements will form the second subset of size 2.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to partition the set of 7 elements into subsets of sizes 2, 2, and 3 is:\n\n35 (ways to choose the subset of size 3) * 6 (ways to choose the first subset of size 2) = 210 ways."
