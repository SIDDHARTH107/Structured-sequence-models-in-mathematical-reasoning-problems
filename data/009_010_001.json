    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the math student to solve: \n\nSuppose that you are an options trader and you are interested in pricing a call option on a stock with a current price of $100. The option has a strike price of $105, an expiration date of 6 months, and a volatility of 20% per year. Using the Black-Scholes equation, what is the price of this call option assuming an interest rate of 5% per year? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Black-Scholes equation for pricing a call option:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC = price of the call option\nS = current stock price\nX = strike price\nT = time to expiration (in years)\nr = interest rate (as a decimal)\nN(d) = cumulative standard normal distribution function\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nσ = volatility (as a decimal)\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n\nS = 100\nX = 105\nT = 6 months = 0.5 years\nr = 5% per year = 0.05\nσ = 20% per year = 0.20\n\nNow, we can calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/105) + (0.05 + (0.20^2)/2) * 0.5) / (0.20 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 ≈ -0.1061\n\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nd2 ≈ -0.3061\n\nNext, we need to find the cumulative standard normal distribution function values for d1 and d2:\n\nN(-0.1061) ≈ 0.4576\nN(-0.3061) ≈ 0.3797\n\nFinally, we can calculate the price of the call option:\n\nC = 100 * 0.4576 - 105 * e^(-0.05 * 0.5) * 0.3797\nC ≈ 45.76 - 105 * 0.9753 * 0.3797\nC ≈ 45.76 - 39.25\nC ≈ 6.51\n\nSo, the price of the call option is approximately $6.51 when rounded to two decimal places."
