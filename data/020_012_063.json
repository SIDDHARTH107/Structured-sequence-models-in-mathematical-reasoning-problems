    "message_2": "Let the length of the field be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter of the field is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2(L + W)\n\nSince the perimeter is fixed at 500 meters, we have:\n\n500 = 2(L + W)\n=> L + W = 250\n=> W = 250 - L\n\nThe area of the field is given by the formula:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nSubstitute W from the perimeter equation:\n\nArea = L * (250 - L)\n\nNow we have the area as a function of L:\n\nArea(L) = 250L - L^2\n\nTo maximize the area, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the area function with respect to L and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(Area)/dL = 250 - 2L = 0\n=> 2L = 250\n=> L = 125\n\nNow, find the width using the perimeter equation:\n\nW = 250 - L\nW = 250 - 125\nW = 125\n\nSo, the dimensions that maximize the area of the field are 125 meters by 125 meters, which is a square."
