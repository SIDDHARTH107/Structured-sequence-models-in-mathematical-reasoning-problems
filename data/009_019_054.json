    "message_2": "To find the probability that X(t) is greater than 1.5 for t ∈ [0,1], we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). This SDE is a linear SDE with constant coefficients, and its solution can be found using the integrating factor method.\n\nLet Y(t) = e^t X(t). Then, we have:\n\ndY(t) = e^t dX(t) + e^t X(t) dt\n\nNow, substitute the given SDE into the equation:\n\ndY(t) = e^t (-X(t) dt + σ dW(t)) + e^t X(t) dt\n\ndY(t) = σ e^t dW(t)\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to t over the interval [0, t]:\n\nY(t) - Y(0) = σ ∫_0^t e^s dW(s)\n\nSince X(0) = 1, we have Y(0) = e^0 * 1 = 1. Thus,\n\nY(t) = 1 + σ ∫_0^t e^s dW(s)\n\nNow, we can find X(t) by multiplying both sides by e^(-t):\n\nX(t) = e^(-t) + σ e^(-t) ∫_0^t e^s dW(s)\n\nThis is the solution to the given SDE. X(t) is a random process, and we are interested in the probability that X(t) > 1.5 for t ∈ [0,1]. To do this, we can use the fact that the integral term is a normally distributed random variable. Specifically, the random variable Z(t) = ∫_0^t e^s dW(s) has a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance (e^(2t) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's consider the random variable X(1):\n\nX(1) = e^(-1) + σ e^(-1) Z(1)\n\nSince Z(1) is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance (e^(2) - 1)/2, X(1) is also normally distributed with mean e^(-1) and variance σ^2 e^(-2) (e^(2) - 1)/2. In our case, σ = 1, so the variance is simply e^(-2) (e^(2) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability P(X(1) > 1.5). To do this, we can standardize X(1) and use the standard normal distribution. Let U = (X(1) - e^(-1)) / sqrt(e^(-2) (e^(2) - 1)/2). Then, U is a standard normal random variable, and we want to find P(U > (1.5 - e^(-1)) / sqrt(e^(-2) (e^(2) - 1)/2)).\n\nUsing a standard normal table or a calculator, we can find the probability:\n\nP(U > (1.5 - e^(-1)) / sqrt(e^(-2) (e^(2) - 1)/2)) ≈ 0.036\n\nSo, the probability that X(t) is greater than 1.5 for t ∈ [0,1] is approximately 0.036 or 3.6%."
