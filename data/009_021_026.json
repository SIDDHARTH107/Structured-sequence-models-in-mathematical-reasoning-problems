    "message_1": "Consider the following partial differential equation: \n\nu_t = k (u_xx + u_yy)\n\nwhere u(x,y,t) represents the temperature distribution of an image over time, k is a constant, and subscripts denote partial derivatives with respect to that variable. \n\nIf a square image of size 100 x 100 pixels has an initial temperature distribution given by u(x,y,0) = sin(x/10) * cos(y/10), and is surrounded by a frame of pixels kept at zero temperature, and the constant k = 0.1, what is the temperature distribution u(x,y,t) after 10 seconds?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Substituting this into the given partial differential equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = k(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y))T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by kXYT:\n\nT'(t) / (kT(t)) = (X''(x) / X(x)) + (Y''(y) / Y(y))\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / (kT(t)) = -λ\nX''(x) / X(x) = -λ - Y''(y) / Y(y)\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) = (-λ - Y''(y) / Y(y))X(x)\nY''(y) = (-λ - X''(x) / X(x))Y(y)\n\nLet μ = -λ - Y''(y) / Y(y), then X''(x) = μX(x) and Y''(y) = (μ - λ)Y(y). Now, we solve these two ODEs with the boundary conditions X(0) = X(100) = 0 and Y(0) = Y(100) = 0.\n\nThe solutions to these ODEs are:\n\nX(x) = sin(πnx / 100)\nY(y) = sin(πmy / 100)\n\nwhere n and m are integers. The eigenvalues λ and μ are:\n\nλ = (πn)^2 / 100^2\nμ = (πm)^2 / 100^2\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for u(x, y, t) as:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑∑A_nm * sin(πnx / 100) * sin(πmy / 100) * e^(-k(λ + μ)t)\n\nTo find the coefficients A_nm, we use the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = sin(x/10) * cos(y/10):\n\nsin(x/10) * cos(y/10) = ∑∑A_nm * sin(πnx / 100) * sin(πmy / 100)\n\nWe can find A_nm by taking the inner product of both sides with respect to sin(πnx / 100) * sin(πmy / 100) and using orthogonality:\n\nA_nm = (4 / 100^2) * ∫∫sin(x/10) * cos(y/10) * sin(πnx / 100) * sin(πmy / 100) dx dy\n\nAfter evaluating the integral, we find that only A_1,1 is non-zero:\n\nA_1,1 = 200 / (π^2)\n\nNow, we can write the temperature distribution u(x, y, t) after 10 seconds:\n\nu(x, y, 10) = (200 / π^2) * sin(πx / 100) * sin(πy / 100) * e^(-0.1 * (2π^2 / 100^2) * 10)\n\nThis is the temperature distribution of the image after 10 seconds."
