    "message_2": "To find the discrete logarithm of 7 to the base 3 modulo 19, we are looking for an integer x such that:\n\n3^x ≡ 7 (mod 19)\n\nWe can use the brute force method to find the value of x by calculating the powers of 3 modulo 19 until we find the one that is congruent to 7.\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 19)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 19)\n3^3 ≡ 8 (mod 19)\n3^4 ≡ 5 (mod 19)\n3^5 ≡ 15 (mod 19)\n3^6 ≡ 7 (mod 19)\n\nSo, the discrete logarithm of 7 to the base 3 modulo 19 is x = 6."
