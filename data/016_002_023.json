    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal that begins with an equilateral triangle and adds a smaller equilateral triangle to each of its sides at each iteration. The perimeter of the Koch snowflake after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (initial side length) * (number of sides) * (scaling factor)^n\n\nIn this case, the initial side length is 1 unit, and the number of sides of the equilateral triangle is 3. The scaling factor is 4/3, as each side of the triangle is divided into 4 segments of 1/3 the original length at each iteration.\n\nAfter 5 iterations, the perimeter can be calculated as:\n\nPerimeter = 1 * 3 * (4/3)^5\nPerimeter = 3 * (1024/243)\nPerimeter â‰ˆ 12.615\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after 5 iterations is approximately 12.615 units."
