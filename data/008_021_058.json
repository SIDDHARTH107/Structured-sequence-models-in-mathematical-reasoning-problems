    "message_2": "This system of linear equations has a singular matrix, which means that the determinant of the matrix is zero. In this case, the system of equations may have either no solution or infinitely many solutions.\n\nFirst, let's write down the augmented matrix for this system:\n\n| 2  3 -1 |  4 |\n| 4  6 -2 |  8 |\n| 6  9 -3 | 12 |\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination to see if we can find a unique solution, no solution, or infinitely many solutions.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2:\n\n| 1  1.5 -0.5 |  2 |\n| 4  6   -2  |  8 |\n| 6  9   -3  | 12 |\n\nStep 2: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row and 6 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  1.5 -0.5 |  2  |\n| 0  0    0   |  0  |\n| 0  0    0   |  0  |\n\nAt this point, we can see that the second and third rows are all zeros. This means that the system of equations is dependent, and there are infinitely many solutions. To find the general solution, we can express one variable in terms of the other two variables.\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\nx + 1.5y - 0.5z = 2\n\nNow, let's express x in terms of y and z:\n\nx = 2 - 1.5y + 0.5z\n\nThis is the general solution for the system of linear equations, where y and z can be any real numbers."
