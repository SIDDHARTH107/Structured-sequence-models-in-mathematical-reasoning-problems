    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12, 30, and 48, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of each number:\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n30 = 2 * 3 * 5\n48 = 2^4 * 3\n\n2. Identify the highest power of each prime factor in the factorizations:\n2^4, 3, and 5\n\n3. Multiply the highest powers of each prime factor together:\n2^4 * 3 * 5 = 16 * 3 * 5 = 240\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 12, 30, and 48 is 240."
