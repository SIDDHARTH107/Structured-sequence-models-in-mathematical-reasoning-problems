    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer N such that any graph of order N contains either a complete subgraph of order m or an empty subgraph of order n. In this case, we are looking for R(3, 3), which is the smallest integer N such that any graph of order N contains either a complete subgraph K3 or an empty subgraph K3.\n\nR(3, 3) is known to be equal to 6. This means that in any graph with 6 vertices, there must be either a complete subgraph K3 or an empty subgraph K3.\n\nNow, let's consider a complete graph K5. It has 5 vertices and 10 edges. Since R(3, 3) = 6, we know that K5 already contains a complete subgraph K3 or an empty subgraph K3. In fact, K5 contains multiple complete subgraphs K3, as any 3 vertices in K5 form a complete subgraph K3. Therefore, there is no need to add any edges to K5 to guarantee the existence of either a complete subgraph K3 or an empty subgraph K3. The minimum number of edges needed to be added is 0."
