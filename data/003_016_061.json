    "message_2": "The phase shift of a sinusoidal function is the horizontal shift applied to the function. In the given function f(x) = 2sin(3x - pi/2), we can see that the phase shift is represented by the term inside the sine function, which is (3x - pi/2).\n\nTo find the phase shift, we need to set the term inside the sine function equal to zero:\n\n3x - pi/2 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n3x = pi/2\nx = pi/6\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function f(x) = 2sin(3x - pi/2) is pi/6."
