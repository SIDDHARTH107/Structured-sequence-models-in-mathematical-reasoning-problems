    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression $3^4 \\div 3^2$, we can use the quotient rule of exponents, which states that $a^m \\div a^n = a^{m-n}$, where a is the base and m and n are the exponents.\n\nIn this case, the base is 3, and the exponents are 4 and 2. So, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n$3^{4-2} = 3^2$\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of $3^2$:\n\n$3^2 = 3 \\times 3 = 9$\n\nSo, the simplified exponential expression is:\n\n$3^4 \\div 3^2 = 9$"
