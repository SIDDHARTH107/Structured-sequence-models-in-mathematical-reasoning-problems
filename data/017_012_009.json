    "message_2": "To prove that there are no other groups of order 16 besides the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, and the non-abelian group of order 16, we will use the Sylow theorems and the classification of groups of order p^2 and p^3, where p is a prime number.\n\nLet G be a group of order 16. Since 16 = 2^4, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_2, must divide 16 and satisfy n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 16.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIf there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let P be the unique 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Then, |P| = 2^4 = 16, and G has a normal subgroup of order 16. Since G has order 16, we have G ≅ P, and G is a p-group. By the classification of groups of order p^2 and p^3, G must be either C16 (cyclic group) or D8 (dihedral group).\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 16\nIf there are 16 2-Sylow subgroups, then G must act on the set of its 2-Sylow subgroups by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism φ: G → S_{16}. Since G has order 16, the image of φ, denoted by Im(φ), is a 2-group. By the classification of groups of order p^2 and p^3, Im(φ) must be either C2, C4, C8, C16, or D8.\n\nHowever, since G has 16 elements and each 2-Sylow subgroup has order 16, the intersection of any two distinct 2-Sylow subgroups must have order 2^3 = 8. Therefore, the action of G on its 2-Sylow subgroups is not transitive, and Im(φ) cannot be S_{16}. This leaves us with the possibility that Im(φ) is a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nNow, let's consider the kernel of φ, denoted by Ker(φ). Since φ is a homomorphism, Ker(φ) is a normal subgroup of G. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have G/Ker(φ) ≅ Im(φ), which implies that |Ker(φ)| = |G|/|Im(φ)|. Since |G| = 16 and |Im(φ)| = 16, we have |Ker(φ)| = 1, which means that Ker(φ) is the trivial subgroup.\n\nThus, G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 16, which is unique up to isomorphism.\n\nIn conclusion, there are no other groups of order 16 besides the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, and the non-abelian group of order 16."
