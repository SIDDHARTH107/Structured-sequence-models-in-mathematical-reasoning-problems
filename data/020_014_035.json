    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. Each unit of A requires 3 hours of machine time and 5 hours of labor, while each unit of B requires 5 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor. The profit obtained by selling each unit of A is $10 and each unit of B is $8. If the factory has 450 hours of machine time and 400 hours of labor available, how many units of A and B should be produced to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for machine time and labor are:\n3x + 5y ≤ 450 (machine time)\n5x + 2y ≤ 400 (labor)\n\nThe objective function to maximize profit is:\nP = 10x + 8y\n\nTo find the feasible region, we first find the intercepts of the constraint equations:\n\nFor the machine time constraint:\nx = 0: 3(0) + 5y = 450 => y = 90\ny = 0: 3x + 5(0) = 450 => x = 150\n\nFor the labor constraint:\nx = 0: 5(0) + 2y = 400 => y = 200\ny = 0: 5x + 2(0) = 400 => x = 80\n\nNow we find the intersection point of the two constraint lines:\n3x + 5y = 450\n5x + 2y = 400\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. We will use elimination:\n\nMultiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 5 to eliminate y:\n6x + 10y = 900\n25x + 10y = 2000\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n19x = 1100\nx = 1100 / 19 ≈ 57.89\n\nNow substitute x back into one of the original equations to find y:\n3(57.89) + 5y = 450\n173.67 + 5y = 450\n5y = 276.33\ny ≈ 55.27\n\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a product, we need to check the integer values around these numbers for the maximum profit:\n\nCase 1: x = 57, y = 55\nP = 10(57) + 8(55) = 570 + 440 = 1010\n\nCase 2: x = 58, y = 55\nP = 10(58) + 8(55) = 580 + 440 = 1020\n\nCase 3: x = 57, y = 56\nP = 10(57) + 8(56) = 570 + 448 = 1018\n\nCase 4: x = 58, y = 56\nP = 10(58) + 8(56) = 580 + 448 = 1028\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved when producing 58 units of product A and 56 units of product B, with a total profit of $1028."
