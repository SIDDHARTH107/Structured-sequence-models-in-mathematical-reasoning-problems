Find the fundamental group of X relative to the base point (1,1) and show that p is a regular covering space.",
    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of X relative to the base point (1,1), we first need to identify the space X. Since X is a square, we can think of it as a quotient space obtained by identifying the opposite edges of the square. Specifically, we can identify the points (0,y) with (1,y) and the points (x,0) with (x,1) for 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1. This identification gives us a torus, which is the space X.\n\nNow, let's find the fundamental group of the torus. We can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem to compute the fundamental group. Divide the torus into two open sets U and V such that U is the torus with a small disk removed around the base point (1,1), and V is an open disk around the base point (1,1). Then, U is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of two circles, and V is contractible. The intersection U ∩ V is also contractible.\n\nUsing the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, we have:\n\nπ1(X) = π1(U) * π1(V) / π1(U ∩ V)\n\nSince π1(U) is the free group on two generators a and b (corresponding to the two loops around the two holes of the torus), π1(V) is trivial, and π1(U ∩ V) is trivial, we get:\n\nπ1(X) = π1(U) = <a, b>\n\nSo the fundamental group of X relative to the base point (1,1) is the free group on two generators, <a, b>.\n\nNow, let's show that p is a regular covering space. A covering space p : Y → X is regular if the action of the fundamental group of X on the fiber p^(-1)(x) is transitive for all x in X. In our case, the fiber p^(-1)(x) consists of precisely two points for every x in X.\n\nConsider an element g in the fundamental group π1(X) = <a, b>. Since the action of the fundamental group on the fiber is free, g acts on p^(-1)(x) without fixed points. Therefore, g must permute the two points in the fiber. Since there are only two points, this action is transitive.\n\nThus, the covering space p : Y → X is regular."
