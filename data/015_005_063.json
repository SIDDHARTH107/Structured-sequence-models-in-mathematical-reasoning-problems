    "message_2": "The Rössler system is a system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations, which is defined as follows:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nGiven the parameter values a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7, we have:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + 0.2y\ndz/dt = 0.2 + z(x - 5.7)\n\nTo find the x-coordinate of a periodic orbit of period 3, we need to find the points where the system returns to the same state after three iterations. This can be done numerically using a method such as the Poincaré section, which involves finding the intersection points of the trajectory with a specific plane in the phase space.\n\nHowever, finding the exact x-coordinate value for the periodic orbit of period 3 is a complex task that requires advanced numerical methods and simulations. It is beyond the scope of a simple text-based response.\n\nTo find the x-coordinate value, you can use specialized software or programming languages such as Python with libraries like SciPy or MATLAB to numerically integrate the Rössler system and analyze the resulting trajectory to find the periodic orbit of period 3."
