    "message_1": "A factory wants to produce two products - product A and product B. The production cost per unit of A is $10 and that of B is $15. The factory has a budget of $1200 for production. The factory can produce a maximum of 100 units of A and 80 units of B. The profit per unit of A is $20 and that of B is $25. How many units of each product should the factory produce to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 25y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. Production cost constraint: 10x + 15y ≤ 1200\n2. Maximum units of A constraint: x ≤ 100\n3. Maximum units of B constraint: y ≤ 80\n4. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we'll solve the production cost constraint for y:\n\n10x + 15y ≤ 1200\ny ≤ (1200 - 10x) / 15\n\nNow we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints. The feasible region is the set of all points (x, y) that satisfy all the constraints. In this case, the feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 80), (100, 0), and (60, 40).\n\nTo maximize the profit function, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex of the feasible region:\n\nP(0, 0) = 20(0) + 25(0) = 0\nP(0, 80) = 20(0) + 25(80) = 2000\nP(100, 0) = 20(100) + 25(0) = 2000\nP(60, 40) = 20(60) + 25(40) = 2200\n\nThe maximum profit of $2200 is achieved when the factory produces 60 units of product A and 40 units of product B."
