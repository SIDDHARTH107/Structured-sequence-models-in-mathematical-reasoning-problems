    "message_1": "A radioactive element has a half-life of 30 years. If its initial mass is 500 grams, how much of it will be left after 90 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the half-life formula:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 500 grams, the time elapsed is 90 years, and the half-life is 30 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/2)^(90 / 30)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of half-lives that have passed:\n\n90 years / 30 years/half-life = 3 half-lives\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/8)\n\nFinal mass = 62.5 grams\n\nSo, after 90 years, there will be 62.5 grams of the radioactive element left."
