    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player A is given 100 units of money to split with Player B, but Player B must agree to the split or both players get nothing. If Player A proposes a split of 70/30, what is the minimum amount that Player B would need to receive for them to accept the split?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the minimum amount that Player B would need to receive for them to accept the split depends on their preferences and how they value the money. There is no fixed minimum amount that can be determined mathematically, as it depends on the individual's personal decision-making process and their willingness to accept a certain share.\n\nHowever, if we assume that Player B is rational and prefers to receive any amount of money over nothing, then the minimum amount they would accept is 1 unit of money, as it is still better than receiving nothing. In the proposed split of 70/30, Player B would receive 30 units of money, which is greater than the minimum amount they would accept if they are rational."
