In this case, let's use the substitution method.\n\nFirst, let's solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 5 - 2y + z\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the second and third equations:\n\n2(5 - 2y + z) + 3y + 4z = 2 + 3i\n(5 - 2y + z) - y + iz = -1 - 2i\n\nSimplify the equations:\n\n10 - 4y + 2z + 3y + 4z = 2 + 3i\n-2y + z - y + iz = -1 - 2i\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n10 - y + 6z = 2 + 3i\n-z + iz = -1 - 2i\n\nNow, let's solve the second equation for z:\n\nz = -1 - 2i + iz\n\nNow, substitute this expression for z into the first equation:\n\n10 - y + 6(-1 - 2i + iz) = 2 + 3i\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n10 - y - 6 - 12i + 6iz = 2 + 3i\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4 - y + 6iz = 2 + 3i\n\nNow, let's solve this equation for y:\n\ny = 4 - 2 - 3i - 6iz\ny = 2 - 3i - 6iz\n\nNow we have expressions for x, y, and z in terms of i:\n\nx = 5 - 2y + z\ny = 2 - 3i - 6iz\nz = -1 - 2i + iz\n\nSubstitute the expressions for y and z back into the expression for x:\n\nx = 5 - 2(2 - 3i - 6iz) + (-1 - 2i + iz)\nx = 5 - 4 + 6i + 12iz - 1 - 2i + iz\nx = 12iz + 7i + iz^2\n\nNow we have expressions for x, y, and z in terms of i:\n\nx = 12iz + 7i + iz^2\ny = 2 - 3i - 6iz\nz = -1 - 2i + iz\n\nThese expressions represent the general solution to the given system of equations."
