    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an efficient method for finding nontrivial factors of a composite number. Here, we will apply the algorithm to find a nontrivial factor of n = 561.\n\n1. Choose a random starting point x_0 and a function f(x). For simplicity, we will use x_0 = 2 and f(x) = x^2 + 1 (mod 561).\n\n2. Initialize two pointers, x and y, both starting at x_0. We will iteratively update these pointers using the function f(x).\n\n3. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between x and y, and the number n. If the GCD is greater than 1 and less than n, we have found a nontrivial factor.\n\n4. Update the pointers: x = f(x) and y = f(f(y)). This \"tortoise and hare\" approach helps detect cycles in the sequence of numbers generated by f(x).\n\nLet's start the iteration:\n\n1st iteration:\nx = f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5 (mod 561)\ny = f(f(2)) = f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26 (mod 561)\nGCD(|5 - 26|, 561) = GCD(21, 561) = 3\n\nWe found a nontrivial factor: 3. Thus, one nontrivial factor of 561 is 3."
