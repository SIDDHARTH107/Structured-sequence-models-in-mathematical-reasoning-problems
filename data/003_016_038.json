    "message_2": "To find the equation of the sinusoidal function, we can use either the sine or cosine function. Let's use the sine function for this problem. The general form of a sine function is:\n\ny = A * sin(B(x - C)) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift. In this problem, we are given the amplitude (A = 3), the period (T = 6), and the phase shift (C = 1). We are not given any information about the vertical shift, so we can assume that D = 0.\n\nTo find the frequency (B), we can use the formula:\n\nB = 2π / T\n\nwhere T is the period. In this case, T = 6, so:\n\nB = 2π / 6 = π / 3\n\nNow we have all the necessary information to write the equation of the sinusoidal function:\n\ny = 3 * sin((π / 3)(x - 1))"
