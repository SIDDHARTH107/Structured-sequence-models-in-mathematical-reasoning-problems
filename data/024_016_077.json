    "message_1": "Let $f: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a scalar function and let $T$ be a tensor field on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ defined by $T = x^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\otimes (dx) + xy^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\otimes (dx) \\otimes (dy)$. Find the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to the coordinate vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ at the point $(1,2,3)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.",
    "message_2": "To find the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ with respect to the coordinate vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$, we need to compute the derivative of each component of $T$ with respect to $z$. Since $T$ is a tensor field on $\\mathbb{R}^3$, it can be represented as a matrix. In this case, the matrix representation of $T$ is:\n\n$$\nT = \\begin{pmatrix}\nx^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & xy^2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives of each component of $T$ with respect to $z$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial (x^2)}{\\partial z} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{\\partial (xy^2)}{\\partial z} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThus, the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to the coordinate vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ is the zero tensor. Evaluating this at the point $(1,2,3)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ does not change the result, so the answer is the zero tensor."
