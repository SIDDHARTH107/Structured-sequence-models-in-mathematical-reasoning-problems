    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to write the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  1 -2 |\n    | 2 -1  1 |\n    | 3  2  2 |\n\nb = | 5 |\n    | 1 |\n    | 3 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we factor A into the product of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we find the QR decomposition of A:\n\nQ = | -0.2673  0.8729  0.4082 |\n    | -0.5345 -0.2182  0.8165 |\n    | -0.8018 -0.4364 -0.4082 |\n\nR = | -3.7417 -0.5345  0.8018 |\n    |  0      2.3094  3.2189 |\n    |  0      0     -2.4495 |\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Q^T * b.\n\nFirst, we compute Q^T * b:\n\nQ^T * b = | -5.3452 |\n          |  4.8730 |\n          | -2.4495 |\n\nNow, we solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^T * b using back-substitution:\n\nR = | -3.7417 -0.5345  0.8018 | x = | -5.3452 |\n    |  0      2.3094  3.2189 | y = |  4.8730 |\n    |  0      0     -2.4495 | z = | -2.4495 |\n\nFrom the last row, we get z = 1.\n\nNow, we substitute z back into the second row to find y:\n\n2.3094y + 3.2189(1) = 4.8730\ny = 0.5\n\nFinally, we substitute y and z back into the first row to find x:\n\n-3.7417x - 0.5345(0.5) + 0.8018(1) = -5.3452\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 0.5, and z = 1."
