If not, find an isomorphism between G and either the cyclic group C60 or the direct product of the alternating group A5 and the cyclic group C2.",
    "message_2": "Let's first consider the case where the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G is greater than 1. By Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Since the order of G is 60, the possible numbers of Sylow 5-subgroups are 1 and 6. Since we are given that there is more than 1 Sylow 5-subgroup, there must be 6 of them. Let P be one of these Sylow 5-subgroups. The order of P is 5, so P is cyclic and isomorphic to C5.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups of G. By Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are 1, 3, 5, 15. Let Q be one of these Sylow 2-subgroups. The order of Q is 4, so Q is either isomorphic to C4 or to the Klein four-group V.\n\nIf Q is isomorphic to C4, then G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, and G is a semidirect product of P and Q. Since there are 6 Sylow 5-subgroups, the action of G on the set of Sylow 5-subgroups by conjugation is a homomorphism from G to S6. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all the normalizers of the Sylow 5-subgroups, which is a normal subgroup of G. Since G is non-abelian, this kernel is nontrivial, and G is isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nIf Q is isomorphic to V, then G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, and G is a semidirect product of P and Q. Since there are 6 Sylow 5-subgroups, the action of G on the set of Sylow 5-subgroups by conjugation is a homomorphism from G to S6. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all the normalizers of the Sylow 5-subgroups, which is a normal subgroup of G. Since G is non-abelian, this kernel is nontrivial, and G is isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where there is only 1 Sylow 5-subgroup. In this case, the Sylow 5-subgroup P is normal in G. Since the order of P is 5, P is cyclic and isomorphic to C5. Let Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since the order of Q is 3, Q is cyclic and isomorphic to C3. Since P and Q are both normal in G and their intersection is trivial, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is isomorphic to C15. Since G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup and a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, G is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A5 and the cyclic group C2."
