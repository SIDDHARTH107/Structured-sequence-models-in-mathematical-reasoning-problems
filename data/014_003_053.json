    "message_2": "To encrypt a message using the ElGamal encryption system, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random number k (1 < k < p-1). Let's choose k=6 for this example.\n2. Compute C1 = g^k mod p. In this case, C1 = 5^6 mod 17.\n3. Compute C2 = (message * A^k) mod p. In this case, C2 = (9 * 11^6) mod 17.\n\nNow let's compute C1 and C2:\n\nC1 = 5^6 mod 17 = 15625 mod 17 = 4\n\nC2 = (9 * 11^6) mod 17 = (9 * 1771561) mod 17 = 1594329 mod 17 = 16\n\nSo the ciphertext (C1, C2) is (4, 16)."
