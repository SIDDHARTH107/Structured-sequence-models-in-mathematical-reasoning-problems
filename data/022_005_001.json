    "message_1": "A math student is asked to find the residues of the function f(z) = (z^2-2)/(z^2-1)^2 at each of its singularities and evaluate the integral of the function around a closed contour that encloses the singularities. \n\nLet the contour C be the unit circle centered at the origin. What is the value of the integral, with positive orientation, around C?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 2) / (z^2 - 1)^2. The singularities occur when the denominator is equal to zero. So, we need to solve the equation (z^2 - 1)^2 = 0. This simplifies to (z - 1)(z + 1) = 0, which has two singularities: z = 1 and z = -1.\n\nNow, we need to find the residues of the function at each singularity. We can do this using the formula for the residue of a function with a simple pole:\n\nRes(f, z0) = lim (z -> z0) [(z - z0) * f(z)]\n\nFor z = 1:\n\nRes(f, 1) = lim (z -> 1) [(z - 1) * (z^2 - 2) / (z^2 - 1)^2]\n\nTo evaluate this limit, we can use L'Hopital's rule. Differentiating the numerator and denominator with respect to z, we get:\n\nNumerator: d/dz (z^2 - 2) = 2z\nDenominator: d/dz (z^2 - 1)^2 = 4(z^2 - 1)(2z)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limit:\n\nRes(f, 1) = lim (z -> 1) [(z - 1) * (2z) / (4(z^2 - 1)(2z))] = lim (z -> 1) [1 / (4(z + 1))] = 1/8\n\nFor z = -1:\n\nRes(f, -1) = lim (z -> -1) [(z + 1) * (z^2 - 2) / (z^2 - 1)^2]\n\nAgain, we can use L'Hopital's rule:\n\nRes(f, -1) = lim (z -> -1) [(z + 1) * (2z) / (4(z^2 - 1)(2z))] = lim (z -> -1) [1 / (4(z - 1))] = -1/8\n\nNow that we have the residues, we can evaluate the integral of the function around the contour C using the residue theorem:\n\n∮C f(z) dz = 2πi * (Res(f, 1) + Res(f, -1)) = 2πi * (1/8 - 1/8) = 0\n\nSo, the value of the integral around the contour C is 0."
