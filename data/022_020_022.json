    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y:\n\n$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$\n\nSubstituting this into the given partial differential equation, we get:\n\n$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. We can set:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$\n\n$\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda^2$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$\n\n$Y''(y) - \\lambda^2 Y(y) = 0$\n\nWe can solve these ODEs using the boundary conditions:\n\n$u(0, y) = u(1, y) = X(0)Y(y) = X(1)Y(y) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$\n\n$u(x, 0) = X(x)Y(0) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$\n\n$u(x, 1) = X(x)Y(1) = 0$\n\nThe boundary conditions imply that $X(0) = X(1) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $Y(1) = 0$. The ODE for X(x) has the general solution:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) + B\\sin(\\lambda x)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions for X(x), we get:\n\n$X(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = \\sin(2\\pi x)$\n\n$X(1) = A\\cos(\\lambda) + B\\sin(\\lambda) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$\n\nSince $A = \\sin(2\\pi x)$, we have:\n\n$X(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)\\cos(\\lambda x)$\n\nNow, we can solve the ODE for Y(y):\n\n$Y''(y) - \\lambda^2 Y(y) = 0$\n\nThe general solution for Y(y) is:\n\n$Y(y) = C\\cosh(\\lambda y) + D\\sinh(\\lambda y)$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $Y(1) = 0$, we get:\n\n$0 = C\\cosh(\\lambda) + D\\sinh(\\lambda)$\n\nSince $C\\cosh(\\lambda) \\neq 0$, we must have $D\\sinh(\\lambda) = 0$. This implies that $D = 0$ and:\n\n$Y(y) = C\\cosh(\\lambda y)$\n\nNow, we can write the solution for u(x, y) as:\n\n$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y) = \\sin(2\\pi x)\\cos(\\lambda x)C\\cosh(\\lambda y)$\n\nTo satisfy the remaining boundary condition $u(x, 0) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$, we must have:\n\n$\\sin(2\\pi x)\\cos(\\lambda x)C\\cosh(0) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$\n\nThis implies that $\\cos(\\lambda x)C = 1$. Since $\\cos(\\lambda x)$ cannot be equal to 1 for all x, we must have $C = 1$ and $\\lambda = 2\\pi n$ for some integer n. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n$u(x, y) = \\sin(2\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi nx)\\cosh(2\\pi ny)$\n\nThis is the solution to the given boundary value problem."
