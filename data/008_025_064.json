    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n3x - 2y = 7.5\n\nNow we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n3x - 2y = 7\n3x - 2y = 7.5\n\nNotice that both equations have the same left side (3x - 2y) but different right sides (7 and 7.5). This means that the two lines are parallel and will never intersect. Therefore, there is no solution for this system of linear equations."
