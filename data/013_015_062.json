    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example numerical problem related to the Principal-Agent Problem in Game Theory:\n\nAn agent is tasked with choosing one of two projects (project A or project B) to work on. Project A has a 40% chance of success, and if successful, will generate a profit of $120,000. Project B has a 70% chance of success, and if successful, will generate a profit of $80,000. The agent's utility function is U(W) = sqrt(W), where W is the agent's wealth. If the agent has a base salary of $50,000, and the principal offers a performance-based bonus of 20% of the profit generated by the chosen project, which project should the agent choose to maximize their expected pay (salary plus bonus)?",
    "message_2": "To determine which project the agent should choose to maximize their expected pay, we need to calculate the expected utility for each project.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the bonus the agent would receive for each project if successful:\n\nProject A bonus: $120,000 * 20% = $24,000\nProject B bonus: $80,000 * 20% = $16,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the agent's total wealth for each project if successful:\n\nProject A wealth: $50,000 (base salary) + $24,000 (bonus) = $74,000\nProject B wealth: $50,000 (base salary) + $16,000 (bonus) = $66,000\n\nNext, we'll calculate the agent's utility for each project if successful:\n\nProject A utility: U($74,000) = sqrt($74,000) ≈ 271.93\nProject B utility: U($66,000) = sqrt($66,000) ≈ 256.97\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected utility for each project:\n\nProject A expected utility: 0.4 (probability of success) * 271.93 (utility if successful) + 0.6 (probability of failure) * sqrt($50,000) ≈ 0.4 * 271.93 + 0.6 * 223.61 ≈ 108.77 + 134.17 ≈ 242.94\n\nProject B expected utility: 0.7 (probability of success) * 256.97 (utility if successful) + 0.3 (probability of failure) * sqrt($50,000) ≈ 0.7 * 256.97 + 0.3 * 223.61 ≈ 179.88 + 67.08 ≈ 246.96\n\nSince the expected utility for Project B (246.96) is higher than the expected utility for Project A (242.94), the agent should choose Project B to maximize their expected pay (salary plus bonus)."
