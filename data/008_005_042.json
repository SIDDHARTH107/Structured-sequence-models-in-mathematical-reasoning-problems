    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n|  2  3  1 | 12\n|  4 -2  5 |  1\n| -6  4 -3 | -6\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we can multiply the first row by 2 and subtract it from the second row. Also, we can multiply the first row by 3 and add it to the third row.\n\nFirst row * 2:\n|  4  6  2 | 24\n\nSecond row - first row * 2:\n|  4 -2  5 |  1\n- |  4  6  2 | 24\n-------------------\n|  0 -8  3 | -23\n\nFirst row * 3:\n|  6  9  3 | 36\n\nThird row + first row * 3:\n| -6  4 -3 | -6\n+ |  6  9  3 | 36\n-------------------\n|  0 13  0 | 30\n\nNow our matrix looks like this:\n\n|  2  3  1 | 12\n|  0 -8  3 | -23\n|  0 13  0 | 30\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo do this, we can multiply the second row by 13/8 and add it to the third row.\n\nSecond row * (13/8):\n|  0 -13  13/8 | -299/8\n\nThird row + second row * (13/8):\n|  0 13  0 |  30\n+ |  0 -13  13/8 | -299/8\n-------------------\n|  0  0  13/8 | -19/8\n\nNow our matrix looks like this:\n\n|  2  3  1 | 12\n|  0 -8  3 | -23\n|  0  0  13/8 | -19/8\n\nStep 3: Solve for z, y, and x.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n(13/8)z = -19/8\nz = -19/13\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n-8y + 3(-19/13) = -23\n-8y - 57/13 = -23\n-8y = -23 + 57/13\n-8y = -240/13\ny = 30/13\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n2x + 3(30/13) - 19/13 = 12\n2x + 90/13 - 19/13 = 12\n2x = 12 - 71/13\n2x = 85/13\nx = 85/26\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 85/26\ny = 30/13\nz = -19/13"
