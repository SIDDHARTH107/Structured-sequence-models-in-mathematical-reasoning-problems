    "message_2": "Since there are 10 choices for each of the 3 numbers (0 to 9), we can calculate the total number of combinations by multiplying the number of choices for each number together.\n\n10 choices for the first number × 10 choices for the second number × 10 choices for the third number = 10 × 10 × 10 = 1000\n\nSo, there are 1000 different combinations of numbers that can be formed."
