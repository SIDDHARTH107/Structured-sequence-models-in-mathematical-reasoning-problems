    "message_2": "The conjugate gradient method is typically used for solving large sparse linear systems, not for finding the minimum of a function. However, we can find the minimum of the function using calculus and the first and second derivative tests.\n\nGiven the function f(x) = x^2 + 4x - 5, we first find the first derivative, f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 4\n\nNow, we set the first derivative to zero and solve for x to find the critical points:\n\n2x + 4 = 0\n2x = -4\nx = -2\n\nThere is only one critical point, x = -2. Now, we find the second derivative, f''(x), to determine if this critical point is a minimum:\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince the second derivative is positive for all x, the critical point x = -2 is a minimum.\n\nNow, we find the minimum value of the function by plugging the value of x back into the original function:\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^2 + 4(-2) - 5\nf(-2) = 4 - 8 - 5\nf(-2) = -9\n\nThus, the minimum value of the function is -9, and it occurs at x = -2."
