    "message_2": "To find the total Gaussian curvature of S, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the total Gaussian curvature of a closed surface is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic (χ) of the surface.\n\nSince the surface S is topologically equivalent to a sphere, its Euler characteristic is χ = 2. Therefore, the total Gaussian curvature of S is:\n\nTotal Gaussian curvature = 2πχ = 2π(2) = 4π\n\nHowever, we know that the Gaussian curvature of S is constant and equal to 4. To find the total Gaussian curvature, we need to multiply the constant Gaussian curvature by the surface area A of S:\n\nTotal Gaussian curvature = Gaussian curvature × A\n\nWe can now set up an equation:\n\n4π = 4 × A\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nπ = A\n\nSo, the surface area A of S is π. Since the Gaussian curvature is constant and equal to 4, the total Gaussian curvature of S is:\n\nTotal Gaussian curvature = Gaussian curvature × A = 4 × π = 4π"
