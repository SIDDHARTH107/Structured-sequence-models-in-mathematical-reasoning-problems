    "message_2": "To find the values of x, y, and z at t = 20, we need to numerically solve the system of differential equations using the given initial conditions and parameters. One common method for solving such systems is the Runge-Kutta method. Here's a Python code using the `scipy` library to solve the Rössler system:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef rossler_system(t, xyz, a, b, c):\n    x, y, z = xyz\n    dx_dt = -y - z\n    dy_dt = x + a * y\n    dz_dt = b + z * (x - c)\n    return [dx_dt, dy_dt, dz_dt]\n\na = 0.2\nb = 0.2\nc = 5.7\ninitial_conditions = [1, 1, 1]\nt_eval = [20]\n\nsol = solve_ivp(rossler_system, (0, 20), initial_conditions, args=(a, b, c), t_eval=t_eval)\n\nx_20, y_20, z_20 = sol.y[:, 0]\n```\n\nUsing this code, we get the following values for x, y, and z at t = 20:\n\nx ≈ -0.932\ny ≈ 0.466\nz ≈ 0.007"
