    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the definition of odd numbers. An odd number can be represented as 2k + 1, where k is an integer.\n\nLet n be an odd number. Then, n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nNow, we want to show that n + 2 is also odd. To do this, we will add 2 to n:\n\nn + 2 = (2k + 1) + 2 = 2k + 3\n\nNow, we want to show that 2k + 3 is also an odd number. We can rewrite 2k + 3 as 2(k + 1) + 1, where k + 1 is an integer since the sum of two integers is also an integer.\n\nTherefore, n + 2 = 2(k + 1) + 1, which is an odd number by definition.\n\nHence, we have proved that if n is an odd number, then n + 2 is also an odd number."
