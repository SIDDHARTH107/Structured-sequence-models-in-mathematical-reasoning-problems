    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 10 cm and an opposite side of length 6 cm. What is the length of the adjacent side?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the length of the adjacent side \"a\".\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nwhere c is the length of the hypotenuse, a is the length of one side (adjacent side), and b is the length of the other side (opposite side).\n\nWe know the length of the hypotenuse (c) is 10 cm, and the length of the opposite side (b) is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n10² = a² + 6²\n\n100 = a² + 36\n\nNow, we can solve for a²:\n\na² = 100 - 36\na² = 64\n\nFinally, we find the square root of 64 to get the length of the adjacent side:\n\na = √64\na = 8 cm\n\nSo, the length of the adjacent side is 8 cm."
