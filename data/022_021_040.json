    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of the given function f(t) = 3t - 2sin(2t), we use the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * f(t)) dt, where the integral is from 0 to infinity.\n\nIn our case, f(t) = 3t - 2sin(2t). So, we need to find the Laplace transform of each term separately and then combine the results.\n\n1) L{3t}:\nF1(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * 3t) dt, from 0 to infinity\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\nLet u = 3t, dv = e^(-st) dt\nThen, du = 3 dt, v = -1/s * e^(-st)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\nF1(s) = [-1/s * e^(-st) * 3t] - ∫[-1/s * e^(-st) * 3] dt, from 0 to infinity\nF1(s) = -3/s * [∫(e^(-st) * t) dt - ∫(e^(-st))] dt, from 0 to infinity\n\nNow, we have already solved the first integral, which is F1(s). The second integral can be solved as follows:\n\n∫(e^(-st)) dt = -1/s * e^(-st), from 0 to infinity\n\nPlugging the limits, we get:\n-1/s * [e^(-s*∞) - e^(0)] = -1/s * [0 - 1] = 1/s\n\nNow, substituting this result back into the F1(s) equation:\n\nF1(s) = -3/s * [F1(s) - 1/s]\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\nF1(s) * (1 + 3/s) = 3/s^2\n\nSo, F1(s) = 3/s^2\n\n2) L{-2sin(2t)}:\nF2(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * -2sin(2t)) dt, from 0 to infinity\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\nLet u = -2sin(2t), dv = e^(-st) dt\nThen, du = -4cos(2t) dt, v = -1/s * e^(-st)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\nF2(s) = [-1/s * e^(-st) * -2sin(2t)] - ∫[-1/s * e^(-st) * -4cos(2t)] dt, from 0 to infinity\n\nNow, we need to solve the second integral. We can use integration by parts again:\nLet u = -4cos(2t), dv = e^(-st) dt\nThen, du = 8sin(2t) dt, v = -1/s * e^(-st)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\nThe second integral becomes:\n∫[-1/s * e^(-st) * -4cos(2t)] dt = [-1/s * e^(-st) * -4cos(2t)] - ∫[-1/s * e^(-st) * 8sin(2t)] dt, from 0 to infinity\n\nNow, we have a similar integral to the one we started with, but with a different coefficient. We can represent this integral as a constant times F2(s):\n\n∫[-1/s * e^(-st) * -4cos(2t)] dt = -4/s * F2(s)\n\nSubstituting this result back into the F2(s) equation:\n\nF2(s) = [-1/s * e^(-st) * -2sin(2t)] - (-4/s * F2(s)), from 0 to infinity\n\nPlugging the limits, we get:\nF2(s) = 2/s * [0 - 0] + 4/s * F2(s)\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\nF2(s) * (1 - 4/s) = 0\n\nSince the right side is 0, we have:\nF2(s) = 0\n\nNow, combining the results of F1(s) and F2(s), we get the Laplace transform of the given function:\n\nF(s) = F1(s) + F2(s) = 3/s^2 + 0 = 3/s^2\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of f(t) = 3t - 2sin(2t) is F(s) = 3/s^2."
