    "message_2": "To find the projection of the force vector F onto the displacement vector D, we can use the formula:\n\nProjection = |F| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere |F| is the magnitude of the force vector (20 N), and θ is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector (30 degrees).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 30 degrees * (π / 180) = π / 6 radians\n\nNow, we can find the projection:\n\nProjection = 20 N * cos(π / 6) = 20 N * (√3 / 2) = 10√3 N\n\nSo, the projection of the force vector F onto the displacement vector D is 10√3 N."
