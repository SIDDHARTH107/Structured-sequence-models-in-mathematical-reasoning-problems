    "message_2": "To find the number of elements in the set {(n,m) | n, m in N and n + m = 10}, we need to find the number of pairs (n, m) of natural numbers that satisfy the condition n + m = 10.\n\nWe can list out the possible pairs:\n\n(1, 9)\n(2, 8)\n(3, 7)\n(4, 6)\n(5, 5)\n(6, 4)\n(7, 3)\n(8, 2)\n(9, 1)\n\nThere are 9 pairs of natural numbers (n, m) that satisfy the condition n + m = 10. Therefore, there are 9 elements in the set."
