    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 5 cm and a minor radius of 2 cm. What is the volume of the torus?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2π * major_radius)\n\nIn this case, the major radius (R) is 5 cm and the minor radius (r) is 2 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (π * 2^2) * (2π * 5)\nVolume = (π * 4) * (10π)\nVolume = 40π^2\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is 40π^2 cubic centimeters."
