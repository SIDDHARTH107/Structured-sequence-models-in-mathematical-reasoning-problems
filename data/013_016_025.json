    "message_1": "Suppose you are playing a game where you are the principal and your employee is the agent. You need to choose the employee's incentive scheme for her project work. You have two options: one where the employee gets $1000 in salary, and one where the employee gets $700 in salary and a bonus of $400 if the project is successful. The probability of the project being successful is 60%. What should be the minimum value of the bonus to induce your employee to choose the option with lower salary but higher expected payoff?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the bonus that would make the employee choose the option with a lower salary but higher expected payoff, we need to compare the expected payoffs of both options.\n\nOption 1: $1000 in salary\nExpected payoff = $1000 (since the salary is guaranteed)\n\nOption 2: $700 in salary and a bonus of B if the project is successful\nThe probability of the project being successful is 60% (0.6), and the probability of the project not being successful is 40% (0.4).\n\nExpected payoff = (0.6 * ($700 + B)) + (0.4 * $700)\n\nTo make the employee choose Option 2, the expected payoff of Option 2 must be greater than the expected payoff of Option 1.\n\n(0.6 * ($700 + B)) + (0.4 * $700) > $1000\n\nSolving for B:\n\n0.6 * $700 + 0.6B + 0.4 * $700 > $1000\n420 + 0.6B + 280 > $1000\n0.6B > $1000 - 700\n0.6B > $300\nB > $300 / 0.6\nB > $500\n\nSo, the minimum value of the bonus to induce your employee to choose the option with lower salary but higher expected payoff should be greater than $500."
