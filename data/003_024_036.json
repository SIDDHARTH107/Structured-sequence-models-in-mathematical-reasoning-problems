    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector u onto vector v using trigonometry, we first need to find the angle between the two vectors. We can do this using the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe dot product of u and v is:\n\nu · v = (2 * 8) + (5 * -3) = 16 - 15 = 1\n\nThe magnitudes of u and v are:\n\n||u|| = √(2^2 + 5^2) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n||v|| = √(8^2 + (-3)^2) = √(64 + 9) = √73\n\nNow we can find the cosine of the angle θ between the two vectors using the dot product formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (||u|| ||v||) = 1 / (√29 * √73)\n\nNow we can find the projection of u onto v:\n\nproj_v(u) = ||u|| * cos(θ) * (v / ||v||)\n\nThe unit vector of v is:\n\nv / ||v|| = [8/√73, -3/√73]\n\nNow we can find the projection:\n\nproj_v(u) = (√29 * (1 / (√29 * √73))) * [8/√73, -3/√73]\nproj_v(u) = [8/73, -3/73]\n\nSo the projection of vector u onto vector v is [8/73, -3/73]."
