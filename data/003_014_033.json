    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the given trigonometric function y = 3sin(2x - π/6), we can compare it to the general form of a sinusoidal function: y = A sin(B(x - C)).\n\nAmplitude (A):\nThe amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = 3. So, the amplitude is 3.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a sinusoidal function is the length of one complete cycle. For a sine function, the period is given by the formula P = 2π/B, where B is the coefficient of x inside the sine function. In this case, B = 2. Therefore, the period P = 2π/2 = π.\n\nPhase Shift (C):\nThe phase shift is the horizontal shift of the function, which is given by the value of C in the general form. In this case, C = π/6. Since the function is in the form y = A sin(B(x - C)), the phase shift is positive, meaning the function is shifted to the right by π/6.\n\nIn summary, the amplitude is 3, the period is π, and the phase shift is π/6 to the right."
