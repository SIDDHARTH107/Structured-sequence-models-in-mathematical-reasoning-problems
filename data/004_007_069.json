    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the composite function h(x) = f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, multiplied by the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is f(u) = sin(5u) and the inner function is g(x) = cos(2x).\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of f(u) and g(x) with respect to their respective variables:\n\nf'(u) = d(sin(5u))/du = 5cos(5u)\ng'(x) = d(cos(2x))/dx = -2sin(2x)\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule to find h'(x):\n\nh'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for f'(u) and g'(x) that we found earlier:\n\nh'(x) = (5cos(5g(x))) * (-2sin(2x))\n\nNow, we substitute g(x) = cos(2x) back into the expression:\n\nh'(x) = 5cos(5cos(2x)) * (-2sin(2x))\n\nFinally, we evaluate h'(x) at x = π/4:\n\nh'(π/4) = 5cos(5cos(2(π/4))) * (-2sin(2(π/4)))\n\nh'(π/4) = 5cos(5cos(π/2)) * (-2sin(π))\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π) = 0:\n\nh'(π/4) = 5cos(0) * (-2 * 0)\n\nh'(π/4) = 5 * 1 * 0\n\nh'(π/4) = 0\n\nSo, the derivative of the composite function h(x) = f(g(x)) at x = π/4 is 0."
