    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\n```\n|  3    5  | | x |   | 17 |\n| 12  20.001 | | y | = | 70 |\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to find the values of x and y.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 3 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n|  1    5/3  | | x |   | 17/3 |\n| 12  20.001 | | y | = |  70  |\n```\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with the second row minus 12 times the first row to eliminate the leading 12:\n\n```\n|  1    5/3  | | x |   | 17/3  |\n|  0  0.001  | | y | = | -2/3  |\n```\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 0.001 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n```\n|  1    5/3  | | x |   | 17/3  |\n|  0    1    | | y | = |  2    |\n```\n\nStep 4: Replace the first row with the first row minus (5/3) times the second row to eliminate the 5/3 in the first row:\n\n```\n|  1    0    | | x |   |  3  |\n|  0    1    | | y | = |  2  |\n```\n\nNow, we can read the solution directly from the matrix: x = 3 and y = 2.\n\nAs for the condition of the matrix, the original matrix was close to being singular (i.e., having no unique solution) because the second equation was nearly a multiple of the first equation. However, due to the slight difference in the coefficients (20.001 instead of 20), the matrix was not singular, and we were able to find a unique solution."
