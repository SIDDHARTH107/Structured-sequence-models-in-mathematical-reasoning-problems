    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the third equation by 3 to make the coefficients of x in the first and third equations the same:\n\n3(x + 2y + z) = 3(2+3i)\n3x + 6y + 3z = 6+9i\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the new third equation:\n\n(3x + 6y + 3z) - (3x + 4y + 2z) = (6+9i) - (7+4i)\n2y + z = -1+5i\n\nNow, let's multiply the third equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y in the second and third equations the same:\n\n2(2y + z) = 2(-1+5i)\n4y + 2z = -2+10i\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the new third equation:\n\n(4y + 2z) - (-5y + 6z) = (-2+10i) - (-6+5i)\n9y - 4z = 4+5i\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables:\n\n2y + z = -1+5i\n9y - 4z = 4+5i\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 4 to make the coefficients of z the same:\n\n4(2y + z) = 4(-1+5i)\n8y + 4z = -4+20i\n\nNow, add the second equation to the new first equation:\n\n(8y + 4z) + (9y - 4z) = (-4+20i) + (4+5i)\n17y = 25i\n\nNow, divide by 17 to get the value of y:\n\ny = 25i/17\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the equation 2y + z = -1+5i:\n\n2(25i/17) + z = -1+5i\n50i/17 + z = -1+5i\n\nNow, subtract 50i/17 from both sides to get the value of z:\n\nz = -1+5i - 50i/17\nz = -1+5i - (50/17)i\nz = -1 + (85/17)i\n\nNow, substitute the values of y and z back into the equation x + 2y + z = 2+3i:\n\nx + 2(25i/17) + (-1 + (85/17)i) = 2+3i\nx + 50i/17 - 1 + 85i/17 = 2+3i\nx - 1 + (135/17)i = 2+3i\n\nNow, add 1 to both sides and subtract (135/17)i from both sides to get the value of x:\n\nx = 2+3i + 1 - (135/17)i\nx = 3+3i - (135/17)i\nx = 3 + (6/17)i\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 3 + (6/17)i\ny = 25i/17\nz = -1 + (85/17)i"
