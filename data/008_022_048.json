    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations in the form of an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2   3   |  6.2 ]\n[ 4  6.2  | 12.4 ]\n```\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to obtain the row-echelon form. We can start by dividing the first row by 2:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5  |  3.1 ]\n[ 4  6.2  | 12.4 ]\n```\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the 4 in the second row by subtracting 4 times the first row from the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5  |  3.1 ]\n[ 0  0    |  0   ]\n```\n\nThe resulting row-echelon form indicates that the second equation is a multiple of the first equation, and they represent the same line. Therefore, the system has infinitely many solutions and is dependent.\n\nTo determine if the coefficient matrix is ill-conditioned, we can calculate its condition number. The condition number is the product of the matrix's norm and its inverse's norm. A high condition number indicates that the matrix is ill-conditioned, which means that small changes in the input can lead to large changes in the output.\n\nFirst, let's find the norm of the coefficient matrix A:\n\n```\nA = [ 2   3   ]\n    [ 4  6.2 ]\n```\n\nWe'll use the infinity norm, which is the maximum absolute row sum:\n\n```\n||A||âˆž = max( |2| + |3|, |4| + |6.2| ) = max( 5, 10.2 ) = 10.2\n```\n\nNow, let's find the inverse of the matrix A. Since the determinant of A is zero (2 * 6.2 - 3 * 4 = 0), the matrix A is singular and doesn't have an inverse. In this case, the condition number is undefined, and the matrix is considered ill-conditioned. This is consistent with the fact that the system has infinitely many solutions and is dependent."
