    "message_2": "To find the conformal map that transforms the unit circle |z|<1 in the z-plane to the annulus 1<|w|<2 in the w-plane, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Map the unit circle |z|<1 to the upper half-plane Im(z)>0 using the Möbius transformation T1(z) = (z - i)/(z + i).\n2. Map the upper half-plane Im(z)>0 to the strip 0<Re(z)<π using the exponential function T2(z) = e^(πz).\n3. Map the strip 0<Re(z)<π to the annulus 1<|w|<2 using the transformation T3(z) = e^z + 1.\n\nNow, let's find the image of the point z=1/2 in the z-plane under this mapping:\n\n1. Apply T1(z) to z=1/2:\n   T1(1/2) = ((1/2) - i)/((1/2) + i) = (1 - 2i)/(5/2)\n   T1(1/2) = (2/5) - (4/5)i\n\n2. Apply T2(z) to T1(1/2):\n   T2((2/5) - (4/5)i) = e^(π((2/5) - (4/5)i))\n   T2((2/5) - (4/5)i) = e^(2π/5) * e^(-4πi/5)\n\n3. Apply T3(z) to T2((2/5) - (4/5)i):\n   T3(e^(2π/5) * e^(-4πi/5)) = e^(e^(2π/5) * e^(-4πi/5)) + 1\n\nThe image of the point z=1/2 in the z-plane under this mapping is w = e^(e^(2π/5) * e^(-4πi/5)) + 1."
