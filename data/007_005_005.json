    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12, 16, and 30, we first need to find the prime factors of each number.\n\nPrime factors of 12: 2 × 2 × 3 (2^2 × 3^1)\nPrime factors of 16: 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 (2^4)\nPrime factors of 30: 2 × 3 × 5 (2^1 × 3^1 × 5^1)\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor present in the numbers and multiply them together:\n\nLCM = 2^4 × 3^1 × 5^1 = 16 × 3 × 5 = 240\n\nSo, the LCM of 12, 16, and 30 is 240."
