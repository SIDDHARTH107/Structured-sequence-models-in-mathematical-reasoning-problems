    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron or Sierpinski triangle, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles. In a 7-layered Sierpinski pyramid, the number of small equilateral triangles can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nwhere n is the number of layers.\n\nFor a 7-layered Sierpinski pyramid:\n\nNumber of triangles = (4^7 - 1) / 3\nNumber of triangles = (16384 - 1) / 3\nNumber of triangles = 16383 / 3\nNumber of triangles = 5461\n\nSo, there are 5461 small equilateral triangles excluding the base triangles in a 7-layered Sierpinski pyramid."
