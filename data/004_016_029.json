    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum height the ball reaches before it starts coming down. We can use the mean value theorem to find the time when the ball reaches its maximum height.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation for the height (h) of the ball as a function of time (t). We know that the initial velocity (v0) is 48 feet per second, and the acceleration (a) due to gravity is -32 feet per second squared (since it's acting downward). The equation for height as a function of time is:\n\nh(t) = v0*t + (1/2)*a*t^2\n\nPlugging in the values for v0 and a, we get:\n\nh(t) = 48*t - (1/2)*32*t^2\nh(t) = 48*t - 16*t^2\n\nNow, let's find the velocity (v) as a function of time:\n\nv(t) = dh/dt = 48 - 32*t\n\nAccording to the mean value theorem, there exists a time 'c' in the interval [0, t] such that the derivative of the height function is equal to the average rate of change of the height function on that interval. In this case, we want to find the time when the velocity is 0 (i.e., when the ball reaches its maximum height and starts coming down). So, we set v(t) to 0:\n\n0 = 48 - 32*t\n\nSolving for t, we get:\n\n32*t = 48\nt = 48/32 = 1.5 seconds\n\nNow that we have the time when the ball reaches its maximum height, we can plug this value back into the height function to find the maximum height:\n\nh(1.5) = 48*1.5 - 16*(1.5)^2\nh(1.5) = 72 - 36\nh(1.5) = 36 feet\n\nSo, the maximum height the ball reaches before it starts coming down is 36 feet."
