    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using block matrices, we first write the system in matrix form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & 3 & -2 \\\\\n    4 & 5 & -4 \\\\\n    -2 & 2 & 3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    x_1 \\\\\n    x_2 \\\\\n    x_3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    10 \\\\\n    20 \\\\\n    5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we can use Gaussian elimination to find the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of the augmented matrix:\n\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n    2 & 3 & -2 & 10 \\\\\n    4 & 5 & -4 & 20 \\\\\n    -2 & 2 & 3 & 5\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\n\nFirst, we'll divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n    1 & \\frac{3}{2} & -1 & 5 \\\\\n    4 & 5 & -4 & 20 \\\\\n    -2 & 2 & 3 & 5\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the first column below the first row. We can do this by subtracting 4 times the first row from the second row and adding 2 times the first row to the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n    1 & \\frac{3}{2} & -1 & 5 \\\\\n    0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 5 & 1 & 15\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we'll multiply the second row by -1 to get a leading 1:\n\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n    1 & \\frac{3}{2} & -1 & 5 \\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 5 & 1 & 15\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the second column below and above the second row. We can do this by subtracting $\\frac{3}{2}$ times the second row from the first row and subtracting 5 times the second row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n    1 & 0 & -1 & 5 \\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1 & 15\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\n\nFinally, we'll eliminate the third column above the third row by adding the third row to the first row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n    1 & 0 & 0 & 20 \\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1 & 15\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we can read off the solution from the RREF of the augmented matrix:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    x_1 \\\\\n    x_2 \\\\\n    x_3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    20 \\\\\n    0 \\\\\n    15\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is $x_1 = 20$, $x_2 = 0$, and $x_3 = 15$."
