Write the message in rows with the number of columns equal to the length of the key (4 in this case).\n\nM A T H\nE M A T\nI C S\n\n2. Rearrange the columns based on the key. The key \"3142\" means that the first column should be the 3rd column, the second column should be the 1st column, the third column should be the 4th column, and the fourth column should be the 2nd column.\n\nA M H T\nM E T A\nC I S\n\n3. Read the encrypted message by columns from top to bottom and left to right:\n\nAMHTMETAIC\n\nSo, the encrypted text is \"AMHTMETAIC\"."
