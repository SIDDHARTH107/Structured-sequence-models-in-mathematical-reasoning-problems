    "message_1": "The self-similar Gosper curve starts with an equilateral triangle with side length $1$. At each iteration, each line segment is replaced with two segments, each connecting two points that are at a distance of $\\frac{1}{4}$ times the length of the original segment from the ends. What is the total length of the curve after 4 iterations? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "At each iteration, the length of each segment is multiplied by $\\frac{3}{2}$, since two segments of length $\\frac{1}{4}$ are added to the original segment. After 4 iterations, the length of each segment will be $(\\frac{3}{2})^4 = \\frac{81}{16}$ times the original length.\n\nThe initial equilateral triangle has 3 sides, and at each iteration, the number of segments is doubled. So after 4 iterations, there will be $3 \\times 2^4 = 48$ segments.\n\nThe total length of the curve after 4 iterations is the product of the length of each segment and the number of segments: $\\frac{81}{16} \\times 48 = \\frac{81}{16} \\times \\frac{48}{1} = \\frac{3888}{16} = 243$.\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the total length of the curve after 4 iterations is 243.00."
