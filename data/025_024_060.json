Suppose that two points $P_1=(1,1,0)$ and $P_2=(0,1,1)$ on this plane are acted upon by the group $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, generated by the involution $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(-x,-y,z)$. Find the equations of the closure of the orbits of $P_1$ and $P_2$, respectively.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the images of $P_1$ and $P_2$ under the action of the involution. Applying the involution to $P_1=(1,1,0)$, we get $(-1,-1,0)$. Similarly, applying the involution to $P_2=(0,1,1)$, we get $(0,-1,-1)$. Now, we have two pairs of points: $(1,1,0)$ and $(-1,-1,0)$ for the orbit of $P_1$, and $(0,1,1)$ and $(0,-1,-1)$ for the orbit of $P_2$.\n\nTo find the closure of the orbit of $P_1$, we need to find the equation of the line passing through $(1,1,0)$ and $(-1,-1,0)$. The direction vector of this line is given by the difference of the two points: $(-1,-1,0)-(1,1,0)=(-2,-2,0)$. We can write the parametric equations of the line as:\n\n$x = 1 - 2t$\n$y = 1 - 2t$\n$z = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of this line with the projective plane $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$. Substituting the parametric equations into the equation of the plane, we get:\n\n$(1-2t)^2+(1-2t)^2+0^2=1$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$8t^2-8t=0$\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n$8t(t-1)=0$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for $t$: $t=0$ and $t=1$. For $t=0$, we get the point $(1,1,0)$, and for $t=1$, we get the point $(-1,-1,0)$. Thus, the closure of the orbit of $P_1$ is the line segment connecting $(1,1,0)$ and $(-1,-1,0)$, which lies on the projective plane.\n\nSimilarly, to find the closure of the orbit of $P_2$, we need to find the equation of the line passing through $(0,1,1)$ and $(0,-1,-1)$. The direction vector of this line is given by the difference of the two points: $(0,-1,-1)-(0,1,1)=(0,-2,-2)$. We can write the parametric equations of the line as:\n\n$x = 0$\n$y = 1 - 2t$\n$z = 1 - 2t$\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of this line with the projective plane $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$. Substituting the parametric equations into the equation of the plane, we get:\n\n$0^2+(1-2t)^2+(1-2t)^2=1$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$8t^2-8t=0$\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n$8t(t-1)=0$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for $t$: $t=0$ and $t=1$. For $t=0$, we get the point $(0,1,1)$, and for $t=1$, we get the point $(0,-1,-1)$. Thus, the closure of the orbit of $P_2$ is the line segment connecting $(0,1,1)$ and $(0,-1,-1)$, which lies on the projective plane.\n\nIn conclusion, the equations of the closure of the orbits of $P_1$ and $P_2$ are given by the line segments connecting $(1,1,0)$ and $(-1,-1,0)$, and $(0,1,1)$ and $(0,-1,-1)$, respectively."
