    "message_1": "Let X be the projective curve defined by the homogeneous equation Y^2Z = X(X-Z)(X-\\lambda Z), where Œª is a nonzero complex number. Suppose D is an effective divisor on X consisting of m points. \n\nIf m = 3, with D supported at distinct points P_1, P_2, P_3 on X, determine the dimension of the vector space H^0(X, ùí™_X(D)) of holomorphic functions on X with poles only at the points P_i.",
    "message_2": "To determine the dimension of the vector space H^0(X, ùí™_X(D)), we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for the curve X. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor D on a curve X of genus g:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the vector space H^0(X, ùí™_X(D)), K is the canonical divisor, and deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D.\n\nIn our case, the curve X is defined by the equation Y^2Z = X(X-Z)(X-ŒªZ), which is a smooth plane curve of degree 3. By the genus-degree formula, the genus g of X is given by:\n\ng = (d-1)(d-2)/2,\n\nwhere d is the degree of the curve. In our case, d = 3, so:\n\ng = (3-1)(3-2)/2 = 2(1)/2 = 1.\n\nNow, let's compute the degree of the divisor D. Since D consists of 3 distinct points P_1, P_2, and P_3 on X, the degree of D is:\n\ndeg(D) = m = 3.\n\nNext, we need to find the canonical divisor K. For a smooth plane curve of degree d, the canonical divisor K has degree:\n\ndeg(K) = (d-1)(d-2) = (3-1)(3-2) = 2.\n\nNow we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g\nl(D) - l(K - D) = 3 + 1 - 1\nl(D) - l(K - D) = 3\n\nSince K has degree 2 and D has degree 3, the divisor K - D has degree -1. A divisor of negative degree has no holomorphic functions associated with it, so l(K - D) = 0. Therefore:\n\nl(D) = 3\n\nSo the dimension of the vector space H^0(X, ùí™_X(D)) of holomorphic functions on X with poles only at the points P_i is 3."
