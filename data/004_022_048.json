    "message_1": "A rectangular box has a total surface area of 150 square inches. What are the dimensions of the box with the maximum volume, if the height must be twice the width of the base? Use calculus to solve this optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "Let the width of the base be x, the length be y, and the height be 2x (since the height is twice the width). The surface area (SA) of the box can be expressed as:\n\nSA = 2(xy + x(2x) + y(2x)) = 150\n\nNow, we need to find the volume (V) of the box:\n\nV = x * y * 2x = 2x^2y\n\nOur goal is to maximize the volume, so we need to find the critical points of V with respect to x and y. To do this, we will first eliminate one of the variables by solving the surface area equation for y:\n\ny = (150 - 6x^2) / (4x)\n\nNow substitute this expression for y in the volume equation:\n\nV(x) = 2x^2 * ((150 - 6x^2) / (4x))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nV(x) = (300x - 12x^3) / 4\n\nNow, find the first derivative of V(x) with respect to x:\n\nV'(x) = d/dx((300x - 12x^3) / 4)\n\nV'(x) = (300 - 36x^2)\n\nTo find the critical points, set V'(x) to 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 300 - 36x^2\n36x^2 = 300\nx^2 = 300 / 36\nx^2 = 25 / 3\nx = sqrt(25 / 3)\nx ≈ 2.886\n\nNow, find the value of y using the expression we found earlier:\n\ny = (150 - 6(2.886)^2) / (4 * 2.886)\ny ≈ 4.324\n\nFinally, find the height:\n\nh = 2x = 2 * 2.886 ≈ 5.772\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box with the maximum volume are approximately width = 2.886 inches, length = 4.324 inches, and height = 5.772 inches."
