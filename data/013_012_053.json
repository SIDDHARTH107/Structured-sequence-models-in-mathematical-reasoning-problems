The demand curve is given by Q = 120 - P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price charged.\n\nFirm A has a constant marginal cost of $20 per unit, while Firm B has a marginal cost of $40 per unit. Assume both firms produce identical products.\n\na) If Firm A announces a quantity of 60, what quantity will Firm B produce in the Stackelberg equilibrium?\n\nb) What price will Firm A charge in the Stackelberg equilibrium?\n\nc) What will be the profit of both firms in the Stackelberg equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "a) To find the quantity Firm B will produce in the Stackelberg equilibrium, we first need to find the residual demand curve for Firm B. Since Firm A is producing 60 units, the residual demand curve for Firm B is:\n\nQ_B = 120 - P - 60 = 60 - P\n\nNow, we need to find the reaction function for Firm B. Firm B's profit function is given by:\n\nπ_B = (P - MC_B) * Q_B = (P - 40) * Q_B\n\nSubstitute the residual demand curve into the profit function:\n\nπ_B = (60 - P - 40) * Q_B = 20 * Q_B\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm B will produce where its marginal revenue (MR_B) equals its marginal cost (MC_B). The marginal revenue for Firm B can be found by differentiating the profit function with respect to Q_B:\n\nMR_B = d(π_B) / dQ_B = 20\n\nSince Firm B's marginal cost is $40 per unit, it will produce where MR_B = MC_B:\n\n20 = 40\n\nHowever, this equation does not hold. This means that Firm B will not produce any units in the Stackelberg equilibrium, as its marginal cost is higher than the price it can charge. So, Q_B = 0.\n\nb) To find the price Firm A will charge in the Stackelberg equilibrium, we can use the demand curve:\n\nQ = 120 - P\n\nSince Firm A is producing 60 units and Firm B is producing 0 units, the total quantity demanded is 60:\n\n60 = 120 - P\n\nSolving for P, we get:\n\nP = 120 - 60 = 60\n\nSo, Firm A will charge a price of $60 in the Stackelberg equilibrium.\n\nc) To find the profit of both firms in the Stackelberg equilibrium, we can use their respective profit functions:\n\nπ_A = (P - MC_A) * Q_A = (60 - 20) * 60 = 40 * 60 = $2400\n\nπ_B = (P - MC_B) * Q_B = (60 - 40) * 0 = 0\n\nSo, in the Stackelberg equilibrium, Firm A will make a profit of $2400, and Firm B will make a profit of $0."
