    "message_2": "To find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of this graph, we can use Kruskal's algorithm, which involves sorting the edges by weight and adding them to the tree in increasing order, as long as they do not create a cycle.\n\nSince there are 8 vertices, the minimum spanning tree will have 7 edges. We will start by adding the edges with the smallest weights.\n\n1. Add the 6 edges with weight 2. The total weight is now 6 * 2 = 12.\n2. We need one more edge to complete the tree. The next smallest weight is 4, so we add one edge with weight 4. The total weight is now 12 + 4 = 16.\n\nTherefore, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of this graph is 16."
