    "message_2": "Since a, b, c, and d commute with each other, we can treat G as a direct product of cyclic groups generated by a, b, c, and d. Let's find the orders of these cyclic groups:\n\n- The order of the cyclic group generated by a is 4, since a^4 = e.\n- The order of the cyclic group generated by b is 2, since b^2 = e.\n- The order of the cyclic group generated by c is 2, since c^2 = e.\n- The order of the cyclic group generated by d is 2, since d^2 = e.\n\nNow, we can express G as a direct product of these cyclic groups: G = C_4 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2, where C_n denotes a cyclic group of order n.\n\nThe order of G is |G| = |C_4| × |C_2| × |C_2| × |C_2| = 4 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 40.\n\nNow, let's find the non-abelian group of order 40. Since 40 = 2^3 × 5, there are two possible groups of order 40 up to isomorphism: the direct product of the cyclic groups of orders 8 and 5 (C_8 × C_5) and the semidirect product of the cyclic groups of orders 8 and 5 (C_8 ⋊ C_5).\n\nThe group C_8 × C_5 is abelian, so we can rule it out. The group C_8 ⋊ C_5 is non-abelian, so it is the only candidate for being isomorphic to G.\n\nTo show that G is isomorphic to C_8 ⋊ C_5, we can define an isomorphism φ: G → C_8 ⋊ C_5 as follows:\n\nφ(a) = (1, 0), φ(b) = (0, 1), φ(c) = (0, 2), φ(d) = (0, 3)\n\nIt is easy to verify that φ is a homomorphism, and since it is bijective, it is an isomorphism.\n\nThus, the non-abelian group of order 40 that is isomorphic to G is C_8 ⋊ C_5."
