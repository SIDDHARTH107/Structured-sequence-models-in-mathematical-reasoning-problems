    "message_1": "A factory manager is trying to decide whether to purchase a new machine for production. The new machine costs $50,000 and is expected to have a useful life of 5 years. The old machine currently in use has 3 years remaining useful life and can be sold for $20,000. The expected revenue the new machine would generate is $18,000 per year, while the old machine generates $12,000 per year. If the interest rate is 6%, should the factory manager purchase the new machine?",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the factory manager should purchase the new machine, we need to compare the net present value (NPV) of both options: keeping the old machine and purchasing the new machine.\n\n1. Calculate the NPV of keeping the old machine:\nThe cash inflows from keeping the old machine are the annual revenues generated by the machine, which is $12,000 per year for the next 3 years. We need to discount these cash inflows to find their present value.\n\nPV = CF / (1 + r)^n\nwhere PV is the present value, CF is the cash flow, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of years.\n\nYear 1: PV = $12,000 / (1 + 0.06)^1 = $11,320.75\nYear 2: PV = $12,000 / (1 + 0.06)^2 = $10,679.38\nYear 3: PV = $12,000 / (1 + 0.06)^3 = $10,075.84\n\nTotal present value of cash inflows from the old machine = $11,320.75 + $10,679.38 + $10,075.84 = $32,075.97\n\nSince the old machine can be sold for $20,000, the total NPV of keeping the old machine is:\n\nNPV_old = $32,075.97 + $20,000 = $52,075.97\n\n2. Calculate the NPV of purchasing the new machine:\nThe initial cost of the new machine is $50,000. The cash inflows from the new machine are the annual revenues generated by the machine, which is $18,000 per year for the next 5 years. We need to discount these cash inflows to find their present value.\n\nYear 1: PV = $18,000 / (1 + 0.06)^1 = $16,981.13\nYear 2: PV = $18,000 / (1 + 0.06)^2 = $16,025.59\nYear 3: PV = $18,000 / (1 + 0.06)^3 = $15,113.19\nYear 4: PV = $18,000 / (1 + 0.06)^4 = $14,245.46\nYear 5: PV = $18,000 / (1 + 0.06)^5 = $13,422.89\n\nTotal present value of cash inflows from the new machine = $16,981.13 + $16,025.59 + $15,113.19 + $14,245.46 + $13,422.89 = $75,788.26\n\nThe NPV of purchasing the new machine is:\n\nNPV_new = $75,788.26 - $50,000 (cost of new machine) + $20,000 (sale of old machine) = $45,788.26\n\n3. Compare the NPVs:\n\nNPV_old = $52,075.97\nNPV_new = $45,788.26\n\nSince the NPV of keeping the old machine is higher than the NPV of purchasing the new machine, the factory manager should not purchase the new machine."
