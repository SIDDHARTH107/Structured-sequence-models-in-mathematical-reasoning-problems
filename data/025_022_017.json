    "message_2": "To find the value of D.C^2, we can use the intersection theory on the smooth projective variety X. We are given that D^3 = 2 and D^2.C = 5. Let's use the following notation:\n\n- D^3 = D.D.D\n- D^2.C = D.D.C\n\nNow, we want to find the value of D.C^2, which can be written as D.(C.C). To do this, we can use the associativity property of intersection numbers, which states that (A.B.C) = (A.C.B) for any divisors A, B, and C on X.\n\nUsing this property, we can rewrite D.(C.C) as (D.C).C. Since we know that D^2.C = 5, we can substitute this value into the expression:\n\n(D.C).C = 5.C\n\nNow, we need to find the value of C.C (the self-intersection number of the curve C). Since X is a smooth projective variety of dimension 3, we know that the self-intersection number of a curve in X is non-negative. Therefore, we can assume that C.C ≥ 0.\n\nNow, we have the following inequality:\n\n5.C ≥ 0\n\nSince C is a curve on X, it must have a non-zero intersection number with D. Therefore, we can conclude that the intersection number 5.C is positive. The smallest positive integer value that satisfies this inequality is 1. Thus, we have:\n\n5.C = 1\n\nFinally, we can find the value of D.C^2:\n\nD.C^2 = D.(C.C) = (D.C).C = 5.C = 5 * 1 = 5\n\nSo, the value of D.C^2 is 5."
