    "message_1": "What is the period of oscillation of a double pendulum with lengths 2 meters and 3 meters, starting from an initial angle of 30 degrees for each pendulum, and assuming negligible friction and air resistance?",
    "message_2": "The period of oscillation for a double pendulum is a complex problem that cannot be solved using a simple formula. The motion of a double pendulum is chaotic and highly sensitive to the initial conditions. However, we can approximate the period of oscillation using numerical methods or simulations.\n\nTo get an approximate value for the period of oscillation, you can use a numerical method like the Runge-Kutta method to solve the equations of motion for the double pendulum. The equations of motion for a double pendulum can be derived using the Lagrangian method, which involves the kinetic and potential energies of the system.\n\nIf you are looking for an exact analytical solution, unfortunately, there isn't one for the double pendulum system. Numerical methods or simulations are the best way to approach this problem."
