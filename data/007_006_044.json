    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 84 and 99 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (99) by the smaller number (84) and find the remainder.\n   99 ÷ 84 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 15.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (99) with the smaller number (84) and the smaller number with the remainder (15) from the previous step.\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n\n   84 ÷ 15 = 5 (quotient) with a remainder of 9.\n\n   Now, replace 84 with 15 and 15 with 9.\n\n   15 ÷ 9 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 6.\n\n   Now, replace 15 with 9 and 9 with 6.\n\n   9 ÷ 6 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 3.\n\n   Now, replace 9 with 6 and 6 with 3.\n\n   6 ÷ 3 = 2 (quotient) with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 3.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 84 and 99 is 3."
