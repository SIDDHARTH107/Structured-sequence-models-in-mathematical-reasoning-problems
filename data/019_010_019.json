I will provide the derivation for this corrected problem statement.\n\nGiven the linear formula (A ⊸ B) & (A ⊸ C) and a proposition A, we want to derive (B & C) using the rules of linear logic.\n\n1. (A ⊸ B) & (A ⊸ C) (Given)\n2. A (Given)\n\nNow, we will use the rules of linear logic to derive (B & C).\n\n3. A ⊸ B (from 1, using the &-elimination rule)\n4. A ⊸ C (from 1, using the &-elimination rule)\n5. B (from 2 and 3, using the ⊸-elimination rule)\n6. C (from 2 and 4, using the ⊸-elimination rule)\n7. B & C (from 5 and 6, using the &-introduction rule)\n\nSo, we have derived the formula (B & C) from the given linear formula (A ⊸ B) & (A ⊸ C) and a proposition A using the rules of linear logic."
