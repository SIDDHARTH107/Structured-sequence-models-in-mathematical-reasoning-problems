    "message_2": "To show that X has a minimal model, we will use the Minimal Model Program (MMP), which is a powerful tool in birational geometry. The MMP is a sequence of birational transformations that simplifies the geometry of an algebraic variety while preserving its birational class.\n\nFirst, let's recall some definitions:\n\n1. A minimal model of a smooth projective variety X is a smooth projective variety X' with a birational morphism π: X → X' such that the canonical divisor K_X' is nef (numerically effective), i.e., its intersection number with any curve is non-negative.\n\n2. A birational contraction is a birational morphism f: X → Y between smooth varieties such that the exceptional locus Exc(f) is a divisor on X, and f_*O_X = O_Y.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the proof:\n\nSince X is a smooth projective variety, we can run the MMP on X. The MMP consists of a sequence of flips and divisorial contractions. A flip is a birational transformation that replaces a curve C on X with negative intersection with K_X by a curve C' with positive intersection with K_X. A divisorial contraction contracts a divisor E on X to a point or a curve on Y.\n\nBy assumption, we have a birational contraction f: X → Y with Y smooth. Since Y is not projective, there exists an ample divisor A on Y such that f^*A is not ample on X. Let H be an ample divisor on X. Then, by the Cone Theorem, there exists an extremal ray R in the Mori cone NE(X) such that (K_X + f^*A + H).R < 0.\n\nBy the MMP, we can contract R to obtain a birational morphism g: X → Z with Z smooth. Since (K_X + f^*A + H).R < 0, we have (K_Z + g^*A + H).R = 0, which implies that K_Z + g^*A + H is numerically trivial. In particular, K_Z is numerically equivalent to -g^*A - H, which is nef.\n\nThus, Z is a minimal model of X, and we have shown that X has a minimal model."
