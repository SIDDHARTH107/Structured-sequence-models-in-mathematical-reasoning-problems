    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n[ 2  3  4 | 10 ]\n[ 3  4  5 | 14 ]\n[ 4  5  6 | 18 ]\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to obtain the row echelon form:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 1.5 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 2 times the first row from the third row:\n\n[ 2   3   4 | 10 ]\n[ 0  -0.5 -1 | -1 ]\n[ 0  -1  -2 | -2 ]\n\nStep 2: Multiply the second row by -2 to make the pivot element 1:\n\n[ 2  3   4 | 10 ]\n[ 0  1   2 |  2 ]\n[ 0 -1  -2 | -2 ]\n\nStep 3: Add the second row to the third row:\n\n[ 2  3   4 | 10 ]\n[ 0  1   2 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0   0 |  0 ]\n\nNow we have the row echelon form of the augmented matrix:\n\n[ 2  3   4 | 10 ]\n[ 0  1   2 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0   0 |  0 ]\n\nSince the last row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 0, it doesn't provide any new information, and we can ignore it. The remaining system of equations is:\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 10\ny + 2z = 2\n\nNow we can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nFrom the second equation, we have y = 2 - 2z. Now we can substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n2x + 3(2 - 2z) + 4z = 10\n2x + 6 - 6z + 4z = 10\n2x - 2z = 4\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx - z = 2\n\nAt this point, we can see that there is no unique solution for this system of linear equations. Instead, we have a family of solutions parameterized by z. To express the solution in terms of z, we can write:\n\nx = 2 + z\ny = 2 - 2z\n\nSo the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 2 + z\ny = 2 - 2z\nz = z\n\nwhere z can be any real number."
