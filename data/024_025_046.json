    "message_2": "Let X be the complex projective plane, denoted as CP^2. The complex projective plane is a compact complex manifold of complex dimension 2. Its holomorphic tangent bundle is given by the dual of the tautological line bundle, denoted as O(-1).\n\nThe first Chern class c_1 of X is the first Chern class of the holomorphic tangent bundle, which is given by the first Chern class of O(-1) dual. Using the property that the first Chern class of a dual bundle is the negative of the original bundle, we have c_1 = -c_1(O(-1)). Since the first Chern class of O(1) is 1, we have c_1(O(-1)) = -1. Therefore, c_1 = 1.\n\nThe second Chern class c_2 of X is the second Chern class of the holomorphic tangent bundle. Using the splitting principle, we can write the holomorphic tangent bundle as a direct sum of line bundles, say L_1 and L_2. Then, c_2 = c_1(L_1)L_1 + c_1(L_2)L_2 + c_1(L_1)c_1(L_2). Since c_1 = 1, we have c_2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\nNow we can compute the required values:\n\nc_1^2 = (1)^2 = 1,\nc_2^2 = (3)^2 = 9,\nc_1.c_2 = 1 * 3 = 3.\n\nSo, for the complex projective plane CP^2, we have c_1^2 = 1, c_2^2 = 9, and c_1.c_2 = 3."
