    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit for each unit of A is $10 and for each unit of B is $15. The production of A requires one machine and one worker in 4 hours, while the production of B requires two machines and two workers in 6 hours. The company has 10 machines and 20 workers and can work up to 60 hours per week. What is the maximum profit the company can make per week?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nThe constraints for the machines and workers are as follows:\n\nMachines: 1x + 2y ≤ 10 * 60 (since there are 10 machines and they can work up to 60 hours per week)\nWorkers: 1x + 2y ≤ 20 * 60 (since there are 20 workers and they can work up to 60 hours per week)\n\nThe constraints for the production time are as follows:\n\nProduction time for A: 4x ≤ 60\nProduction time for B: 6y ≤ 60\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the constraints:\n\n1. 4x ≤ 60 => x ≤ 15\n2. 6y ≤ 60 => y ≤ 10\n3. 1x + 2y ≤ 600 => x ≤ 600 - 2y\n4. 1x + 2y ≤ 1200 => x ≤ 1200 - 2y\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the intersection of these constraints. The corner points of the feasible region are (0,0), (0,10), (15,0), and (15,5).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n1. Profit at (0,0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0,10) = 10(0) + 15(10) = $150\n3. Profit at (15,0) = 10(15) + 15(0) = $150\n4. Profit at (15,5) = 10(15) + 15(5) = $225\n\nThe maximum profit is $225 per week, which occurs when the company produces 15 units of product A and 5 units of product B."
