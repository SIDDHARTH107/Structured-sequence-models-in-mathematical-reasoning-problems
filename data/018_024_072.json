    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1, 3, 5} ∪ {2, 4, 6, 8} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference. To do this, we need to know the universal set U. Since it's not given, let's assume U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nThe complement of the symmetric difference is the set of elements in U but not in the symmetric difference:\n\n(U - (A ∆ B)) = {7, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is distributive over complement. To do this, we need to show that:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = A' ∆ B'\n\nWe already found (A ∆ B)' = {7, 9, 10}. Now let's find A' and B':\n\nA' = U - A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}\nB' = U - B = {1, 3, 5, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A' and B':\n\nA' ∆ B' = (A' - B') ∪ (B' - A') = {2, 4, 6, 8} ∪ {1, 3, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}\n\nWe can see that (A ∆ B)' = {7, 9, 10} ≠ A' ∆ B' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}. Therefore, the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement using this example."
