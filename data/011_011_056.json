    "message_2": "To divide the soccer team into 2 groups of 7 players each, we first need to choose 7 players out of the 14 players to form the first group. This can be done using combinations, which is denoted as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\", where n is the total number of players and k is the number of players we want to choose.\n\nC(14, 7) = 14! / (7! * (14-7)!)\n\nNow, we need to choose a captain for each group. There are 7 players in each group, so there are 7 ways to choose a captain for the first group and 7 ways to choose a captain for the second group.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to divide the team and choose captains is:\n\nC(14, 7) * 7 * 7\n\nLet's calculate the combinations and the final result:\n\n14! = 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 87,178,291,200\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5,040\n(14-7)! = 7! = 5,040\n\nC(14, 7) = 87,178,291,200 / (5,040 * 5,040) = 3,432\n\nNow, let's multiply by the number of ways to choose captains:\n\n3,432 * 7 * 7 = 167,310\n\nSo, there are 167,310 different ways to divide the soccer team into 2 groups of 7 players each and choose captains for each group."
