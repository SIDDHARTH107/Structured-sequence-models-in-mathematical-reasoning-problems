Define a function $f:S^3 \\rightarrow S^2$ by $f(w)=(w\\cdot i)w^{-1}$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit in $\\mathbb{C}$. Show that $f$ is constant on orbits of the $S^1$-action and induces a bijection between $S^3/S^1$ (the orbit space of the action) and $S^2$.",
    "message_2": "First, let's show that $f$ is constant on orbits of the $S^1$-action. Let $z \\in S^1$ and $w \\in S^3$. Then, consider the action of $z$ on $w$:\n\n$$f(zw) = (zw \\cdot i)(zw)^{-1} = (zwi)(w^{-1}z^{-1}) = z(w \\cdot i)w^{-1}z^{-1} = zf(w)z^{-1}.$$\n\nSince $z$ and $z^{-1}$ are elements of $S^1$, the result $zf(w)z^{-1}$ is in the same orbit as $f(w)$. Therefore, $f$ is constant on orbits of the $S^1$-action.\n\nNow, let's show that $f$ induces a bijection between $S^3/S^1$ and $S^2$. Define a function $g: S^3/S^1 \\rightarrow S^2$ by $g([w]) = f(w)$, where $[w]$ denotes the orbit of $w$ under the $S^1$-action. Since $f$ is constant on orbits, $g$ is well-defined.\n\nTo show that $g$ is injective, suppose $g([w_1]) = g([w_2])$ for some $w_1, w_2 \\in S^3$. Then $f(w_1) = f(w_2)$, which implies\n\n$$w_1 \\cdot i \\cdot w_1^{-1} = w_2 \\cdot i \\cdot w_2^{-1}.$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $w_1$ on the left and $w_1^{-1}$ on the right, we get\n\n$$w_1w_2^{-1} \\cdot i = i \\cdot w_1w_2^{-1}.$$\n\nSince $w_1w_2^{-1} \\in S^3$, this means that $w_1w_2^{-1}$ commutes with $i$. However, the only elements in $S^3$ that commute with $i$ are those in $S^1$. Thus, $w_1w_2^{-1} \\in S^1$, which implies that $w_1$ and $w_2$ are in the same orbit, so $[w_1] = [w_2]$. This shows that $g$ is injective.\n\nTo show that $g$ is surjective, let $x \\in S^2$. We can write $x$ as a unit quaternion of the form $x = a + bi + cj + dk$, where $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1$. Define $w = a + bi + cj - dk \\in S^3$. Then,\n\n$$f(w) = (w \\cdot i)w^{-1} = (ai - b + ck + dj)(a - bi - cj + dk) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 2bi + 2cj - 2dk = x.$$\n\nThus, $g([w]) = f(w) = x$, which shows that $g$ is surjective.\n\nSince $g$ is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection between $S^3/S^1$ and $S^2$."
