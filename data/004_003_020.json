    "message_1": "An apple orchard has a fence on three sides and is bordered on the fourth side by a straight river. If the length of the fence is 300 meters, what is the maximum area that can be enclosed by the fence?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the fence parallel to the river as x meters, and the length of the two other fences perpendicular to the river as y meters each. We are given that the total length of the fence is 300 meters, so we can write the equation:\n\nx + 2y = 300\n\nWe want to find the maximum area enclosed by the fence, which can be represented as A = xy. To find the maximum area, we need to express the area in terms of one variable. We can do this by solving the equation above for x or y and substituting it into the area equation.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 300 - 2y\n\nNow, substitute this into the area equation:\n\nA = (300 - 2y)y\nA = 300y - 2y^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to y and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dy = 300 - 4y = 0\n\nSolving for y:\n\n4y = 300\ny = 75\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 300 - 2(75)\nx = 300 - 150\nx = 150\n\nSo, the maximum area enclosed by the fence is:\n\nA = xy\nA = 150 * 75\nA = 11,250 square meters"
