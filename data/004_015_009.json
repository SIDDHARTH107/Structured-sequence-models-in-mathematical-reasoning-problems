    "message_2": "To find the inflection point, we need to find the second derivative of the function and set it equal to zero. \n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9) = 6x - 12\n\nTo find the inflection point, we set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = a = 2\n\nNow, we have the inflection point at x = a = 2. To determine whether it's a maximum or minimum point, we need to analyze the concavity of the function around this point. If the second derivative is positive, the function is concave up, and if it's negative, the function is concave down.\n\nLet's analyze the concavity around x = 2:\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nFor x < 2:\nf''(x) < 0, which means the function is concave down.\n\nFor x > 2:\nf''(x) > 0, which means the function is concave up.\n\nSince the function changes concavity at x = 2, it is an inflection point. However, an inflection point is neither a maximum nor a minimum point. It is a point where the function changes its concavity."
