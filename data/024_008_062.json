    "message_2": "To compute the Ricci curvature tensor, we first need to find the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, which are given by:\n\nΓᵢⱼᵏ = 1/2 * (gᵢₖ,ⱼ + gⱼₖ,ᵢ - gᵢⱼ,ₖ)\n\nwhere the commas denote partial derivatives. Since the metric tensor g is diagonal, we have:\n\ng₁₁ = 1, g₂₂ = 2, g₃₃ = 3, and gᵢⱼ = 0 for i ≠ j.\n\nNow, we can compute the Christoffel symbols. Since the metric tensor components are constants, their partial derivatives are all zero. Therefore, all the Christoffel symbols are also zero:\n\nΓᵢⱼᵏ = 0 for all i, j, k.\n\nNext, we compute the Riemann curvature tensor, which is given by:\n\nRᵢⱼₖₗ = ∂ₖΓᵢⱼₗ - ∂ₗΓᵢⱼₖ + ΓᵢₘₗΓₘⱼₖ - ΓᵢₘₖΓₘⱼₗ\n\nSince all the Christoffel symbols are zero, the Riemann curvature tensor is also zero:\n\nRᵢⱼₖₗ = 0 for all i, j, k, l.\n\nFinally, we compute the Ricci curvature tensor, which is given by contracting the Riemann curvature tensor:\n\nRᵢⱼ = Rₖᵢₖⱼ\n\nSince the Riemann curvature tensor is zero, the Ricci curvature tensor is also zero:\n\nRᵢⱼ = 0 for all i, j.\n\nSo, the Ricci curvature tensor at the point (1, 1, 1) on M is identically zero."
