    "message_1": "A company wants to construct a cylindrical can with a volume of 500 cubic centimeters. The material for the bottom of the can is 4 times as expensive per square centimeter as the material for the sides of the can. Determine the dimensions of the cheapest can if the company wants to minimize the cost of the material. (Round your answers to two decimal places.)",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the radius of the base of the cylindrical can as r and the height as h. The volume of the cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h. We are given that the volume is 500 cubic centimeters, so we have:\n\n500 = πr^2h\n\nNow, let's denote the cost per square centimeter of the material for the sides as C. Then, the cost per square centimeter of the material for the bottom is 4C. The surface area of the sides of the can is given by the formula A_sides = 2πrh, and the surface area of the bottom is given by the formula A_bottom = πr^2.\n\nThe total cost of the material for the can is given by the sum of the cost of the material for the sides and the bottom:\n\nTotal_cost = C * A_sides + 4C * A_bottom\nTotal_cost = C(2πrh) + 4C(πr^2)\n\nWe want to minimize the total cost, so we need to find the dimensions r and h that minimize this expression. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we need to express h in terms of r using the volume constraint:\n\nh = 500 / (πr^2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the total cost expression:\n\nTotal_cost = C(2πr * (500 / (πr^2))) + 4C(πr^2)\nTotal_cost = 1000C/r + 4Cπr^2\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points of this expression by taking the derivative with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(Total_cost)/dr = -1000C/r^2 + 8Cπr = 0\n\nTo solve for r, we can multiply both sides by r^2:\n\n-1000C + 8Cπr^3 = 0\n\nNow, isolate r^3:\n\n8Cπr^3 = 1000C\nr^3 = 1000 / (8π)\n\nNow, take the cube root of both sides to find r:\n\nr = (1000 / (8π))^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can find h using the expression for h in terms of r:\n\nh = 500 / (πr^2)\n\nSubstitute the value of r:\n\nh = 500 / (π((1000 / (8π))^(1/3))^2)\n\nNow, we can calculate the values of r and h:\n\nr ≈ 3.03 cm\nh ≈ 5.47 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions of the cheapest can are approximately r = 3.03 cm and h = 5.47 cm."
