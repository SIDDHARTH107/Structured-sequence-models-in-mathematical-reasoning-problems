The distances between each location are as follows:\n\n- Location 1 to Location 2: 5 km\n- Location 1 to Location 3: 8 km\n- Location 1 to Location 4: 10 km\n- Location 1 to Location 5: 15 km\n- Location 2 to Location 3: 3 km\n- Location 2 to Location 4: 6 km\n- Location 2 to Location 5: 11 km\n- Location 3 to Location 4: 4 km\n- Location 3 to Location 5: 9 km\n- Location 4 to Location 5: 5 km\n\nWhat is the optimal route plan for the drivers to deliver all packages while minimizing the total distance traveled?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route plan for the drivers to deliver all packages while minimizing the total distance traveled, we can use the nearest neighbor algorithm. The algorithm starts at a location and moves to the nearest unvisited location until all locations have been visited.\n\nDriver 1 Route:\n1. Start at Location 1\n2. Move to Location 2 (5 km)\n3. Move to Location 3 (3 km)\n4. Move to Location 4 (4 km)\n5. Return to Location 1 (10 km)\nTotal distance: 22 km\n\nDriver 2 Route:\n1. Start at Location 1\n2. Move to Location 2 (5 km)\n3. Move to Location 5 (11 km)\n4. Return to Location 1 (15 km)\nTotal distance: 31 km\n\nDriver 3 Route:\n1. Start at Location 1\n2. Move to Location 3 (8 km)\n3. Move to Location 5 (9 km)\n4. Return to Location 1 (15 km)\nTotal distance: 32 km\n\nThe optimal route plan for the drivers is as follows:\n- Driver 1: Location 1 -> Location 2 -> Location 3 -> Location 4 -> Location 1 (22 km)\n- Driver 2: Location 1 -> Location 2 -> Location 5 -> Location 1 (31 km)\n- Driver 3: Location 1 -> Location 3 -> Location 5 -> Location 1 (32 km)\n\nTotal distance traveled by all drivers: 22 km + 31 km + 32 km = 85 km"
