    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the structure of the graph. Since the graph is not specified, we will consider a general case: a cycle graph with 7 vertices (C7). This is because a cycle graph is the most restrictive in terms of coloring adjacent vertices, and any other graph with 7 vertices will have at least one vertex with a lower degree, making it easier to color.\n\nLet's use the chromatic polynomial to find the number of ways to color the graph with 3 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. The chromatic polynomial for a cycle graph Cn is given by:\n\nP(Cn, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1)\n\nwhere k is the number of colors and n is the number of vertices.\n\nIn our case, n = 7 and k = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(C7, 3) = (3-1)^7 + (-1)^7 (3-1)\nP(C7, 3) = 2^7 - 2\nP(C7, 3) = 128 - 2\nP(C7, 3) = 126\n\nSo there are 126 ways for the student to paint the 7-vertex graph using 3 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Note that this is for a cycle graph, and other graph structures with 7 vertices may have more possible colorings."
