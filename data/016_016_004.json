    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Peano-Gosper curve or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve constructed using a set of substitution rules. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of the square root of 7.\n\nAfter the 4th iteration, the length of the Gosper curve will be:\n\nInitial length * (sqrt(7))^4\n\nSince the initial length is 1 unit, the total length after the 4th iteration will be:\n\n(1) * (sqrt(7))^4 = (7)^2 = 49 units"
