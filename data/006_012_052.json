    "message_1": "What is the probability of a robbery occurring in a specific neighborhood, given that there have been 5 robberies in the past month and the neighborhood has a population of 10,000 households?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a robbery occurring in a specific neighborhood, we can use the following formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of successful outcomes is the number of robberies (5), and the total number of possible outcomes is the number of households (10,000).\n\nProbability = 5 / 10,000 = 0.0005\n\nSo, the probability of a robbery occurring in a specific neighborhood is 0.0005 or 0.05%. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified calculation and doesn't take into account other factors that could influence the probability of a robbery, such as location, time of day, and security measures."
