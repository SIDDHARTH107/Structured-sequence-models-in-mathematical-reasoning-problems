    "message_1": "In a basketball game, a player makes 80% of his free throw attempts. If he is given 5 free throws, what is the probability that he will make all of them?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the player makes all 5 free throws, we need to multiply the probability of making each individual free throw together. Since the player makes 80% of his free throw attempts, the probability of making each free throw is 0.8.\n\nProbability of making all 5 free throws = (0.8) * (0.8) * (0.8) * (0.8) * (0.8) = 0.8^5 = 0.32768\n\nSo, the probability that the player will make all 5 free throws is approximately 32.77%."
