    "message_2": "To find the length of the Peano curve at the nth iteration, where n is an even number, we can use the given formula:\n\nL(n) = (4^(n/2))/3\n\nSince n is an even number, we can represent it as n = 2k, where k is an integer. Now, we can substitute this into the formula:\n\nL(2k) = (4^(2k/2))/3\n\nL(2k) = (4^k)/3\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve at the nth iteration, where n is an even number, is given by L(2k) = (4^k)/3, where k is an integer."
