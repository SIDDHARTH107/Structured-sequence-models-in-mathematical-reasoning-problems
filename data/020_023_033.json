They have chosen five assets to invest in, each with the following expected returns and standard deviations:\n\n| Asset | Expected Return (%) | Standard Deviation (%) |\n|-------|-----------------------|------------------------------|\n| A       | 8                            | 15                                |\n| B       | 10                          | 12                                |\n| C       | 12                          | 16                                |\n| D      | 9                            | 18                                |\n| E       | 11                          | 20                                |\n\nThe student wants to find the optimal allocation of funds among the five assets to maximize the portfolio's expected return while minimizing the portfolio's risk. What should be the allocation of funds among these assets to achieve the objective?",
    "message_2": "To optimize the investment portfolio, we need to consider the expected return, risk (standard deviation), and correlations between the assets. However, the correlation information is missing in the given data. Without the correlation information, we cannot provide the exact optimal allocation of funds among these assets.\n\nHowever, we can provide some general guidelines for optimizing the portfolio:\n\n1. Diversification: Spread the investment across multiple assets to reduce the overall risk. This can be achieved by investing in assets with low or negative correlations.\n\n2. Risk-Return Trade-off: Consider the risk and return of each asset. Higher expected return usually comes with higher risk (standard deviation). The investor should decide their risk tolerance and allocate funds accordingly.\n\n3. Efficient Frontier: In the context of the Modern Portfolio Theory, the optimal portfolio lies on the efficient frontier, which is a curve that represents the highest expected return for a given level of risk. To find the optimal portfolio, the investor should identify their desired risk level and find the portfolio with the highest expected return on the efficient frontier.\n\nIn summary, without the correlation information, we cannot provide the exact optimal allocation of funds among these assets. However, the investor should consider diversification, risk-return trade-off, and the efficient frontier when making their investment decisions."
