They take a random sample of 50 widgets and weigh them, getting a mean of 12 oz with a standard deviation of 0.5 oz. What is the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean weight of the widgets?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean weight of the widgets, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nx̄ = sample mean = 12 oz\nZ = Z-score for a 95% confidence interval = 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table)\nσ = sample standard deviation = 0.5 oz\nn = sample size = 50\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n = 0.5 / √50 ≈ 0.0707107\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error (ME):\n\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * 0.0707107 ≈ 0.138592\n\nFinally, we can find the 95% confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± ME = 12 ± 0.138592 = (11.861408, 12.138592)\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean weight of the widgets is approximately (11.861 oz, 12.139 oz)."
