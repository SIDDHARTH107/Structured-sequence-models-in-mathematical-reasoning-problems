    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a rectangular base measuring 12 cm by 8 cm and a height of 10 cm. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base_area * height\n\nThe base area can be found by multiplying the length and width of the rectangular base:\n\nbase_area = 12 cm * 8 cm = 96 cm²\n\nNow, we can plug the base_area and height into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 96 cm² * 10 cm = 32 cm³ * 10 cm = 320 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 320 cm³."
