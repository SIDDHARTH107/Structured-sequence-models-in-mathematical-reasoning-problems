Express the following statement in higher-order logic: \"For every two people, there is another person who is a parent of both of them.\"",
    "message_2": "To express the given statement in higher-order logic, we can use the following formula:\n\n∀x, y ∃z (P(x, z) ∧ P(y, z)) \n\nThis formula states that for every two people x and y, there exists another person z such that z is a parent of both x and y."
