    "message_2": "To find the smallest three-digit number divisible by both 9 and 11, we need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 9 and 11. \n\nThe prime factorization of 9 is 3^2, and the prime factorization of 11 is 11^1 (since 11 is a prime number). \n\nTo find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor and multiply them together: \n\nLCM(9, 11) = 3^2 * 11^1 = 9 * 11 = 99\n\nHowever, 99 is not a three-digit number. To find the smallest three-digit number divisible by both 9 and 11, we can simply multiply the LCM by 2:\n\n2 * 99 = 198\n\nSo, the smallest three-digit number that is divisible by both 9 and 11 is 198."
