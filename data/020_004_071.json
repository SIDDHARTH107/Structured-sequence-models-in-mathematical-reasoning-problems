    "message_1": "A manufacturing company needs to produce 500 units of a product using two machines. Machine 1 can produce 2 units in 1 hour and Machine 2 can produce 5 units in 1 hour. Each unit of the product requires 1 hour of processing time on Machine 1 and 0.5 hours on Machine 2. The company has only 700 hours of available processing time on Machine 1 and 400 hours of available processing time on Machine 2. The profit for each unit of the product is $10. How many units should the company produce on each machine to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units produced by Machine 1 and y be the number of units produced by Machine 2. We need to find the values of x and y that maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 10y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 500 (total units produced)\n2. x ≤ 700 (available processing time on Machine 1)\n3. 0.5y ≤ 400 (available processing time on Machine 2)\n\nFirst, we can solve the constraint 1 for y: y = 500 - x.\n\nNext, we can substitute this expression for y into the profit function: P(x) = 10x + 10(500 - x) = 10x + 5000 - 10x = 5000.\n\nSince the profit function is constant, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy the constraints 2 and 3.\n\nFrom constraint 2, x ≤ 700, so the maximum value of x is 700. However, if x = 700, then y = 500 - 700 = -200, which is not possible.\n\nFrom constraint 3, 0.5y ≤ 400, so the maximum value of y is 800. However, if y = 800, then x = 500 - 800 = -300, which is also not possible.\n\nWe need to find a combination of x and y that satisfies both constraints 2 and 3. Let's try the maximum value of x that still allows for a positive value of y:\n\nx = 700 - 2y (from constraint 1)\nx = 700 - 2(400/0.5) = 700 - 1600 = -900, which is not possible.\n\nNow let's try the maximum value of y that still allows for a positive value of x:\n\n0.5y = 400 - x (from constraint 3)\ny = 2(400 - x) = 800 - 2x\n\nSubstitute this expression for y into constraint 1:\n\nx + (800 - 2x) = 500\nx - 2x = 500 - 800\n-x = -300\nx = 300\n\nNow we can find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny = 800 - 2(300) = 800 - 600 = 200\n\nSo, the company should produce 300 units on Machine 1 and 200 units on Machine 2 to maximize profit. The total profit will be P(300, 200) = 10(300) + 10(200) = 3000 + 2000 = $5000."
