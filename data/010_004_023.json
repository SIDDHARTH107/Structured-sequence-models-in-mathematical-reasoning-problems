Define a collection K = {C ⊂ A : C is finite or C is the complement of a finite set}, and let Y = ∪ C∈K C. Show that Y is compact. \n\nFor instance, prove that the open cover {Uα} of Y has a finite subcover.",
    "message_2": "To show that Y is compact, we need to prove that every open cover of Y has a finite subcover. Let {Uα} be an arbitrary open cover of Y. Since Y = ∪ C∈K C, we have that for each C ∈ K, there exists an α(C) such that C ⊆ Uα(C). We will consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: C is finite.\nSince C is finite, there are only finitely many elements in C, say {c1, c2, ..., cn}. For each ci, there exists an α(ci) such that ci ∈ Uα(ci). Thus, the finite subcover {Uα(c1), Uα(c2), ..., Uα(cn)} covers C.\n\nCase 2: C is the complement of a finite set.\nLet F be the finite set such that C = A \\ F. Since F is finite, there are only finitely many elements in F, say {f1, f2, ..., fn}. For each fi, there exists an α(fi) such that fi ∈ Uα(fi). Now, consider the set A \\ {Uα(f1), Uα(f2), ..., Uα(fn)}. This set is a subset of C, so there exists an α(C) such that A \\ {Uα(f1), Uα(f2), ..., Uα(fn)} ⊆ Uα(C). Thus, the finite subcover {Uα(f1), Uα(f2), ..., Uα(fn), Uα(C)} covers C.\n\nIn both cases, we have found a finite subcover of {Uα} that covers C. Since this holds for every C ∈ K, we can take the union of these finite subcovers to obtain a finite subcover of {Uα} that covers Y. Therefore, Y is compact."
