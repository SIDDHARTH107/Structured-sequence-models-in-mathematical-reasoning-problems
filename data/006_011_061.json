    "message_1": "If the probability of an accident occurring in a workplace is 0.12, and there are 550 employees working in the workplace, how many accidents can be expected to occur in a month?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of accidents in a month, we can multiply the probability of an accident occurring by the number of employees.\n\nExpected number of accidents = Probability of accident * Number of employees\nExpected number of accidents = 0.12 * 550\nExpected number of accidents = 66\n\nSo, we can expect 66 accidents to occur in a month in the workplace."
