    "message_2": "To find the genus of the graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nIn the given graph G, we have:\nV = 10 (vertices)\nE = 11 (edges)\n\nTo determine if the graph is planar, we can use the inequality for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\n11 ≤ 3(10) - 6\n11 ≤ 24\n\nSince the inequality holds, the graph might be planar. Now we need to check if we can draw the graph without any edge crossings. After trying to draw the graph, we can see that it is indeed possible to draw it without any edge crossings. Therefore, the graph is planar.\n\nSince the graph is planar, the genus g is 0."
