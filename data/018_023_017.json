    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's calculate the Cartesian products:\n\n1.

Associativity means that for any sets A, B, and C, (A ∆ B) ∆ C = A ∆ (B ∆ C).\n\nLet's consider a set C = {3, 4, 5}. Then,\n\nA ∆ C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {3} = {1, 2, 4, 5}\nB ∆ C = {2, 3, 4, 5} - {3, 4} = {2, 5}\n\nNow, let's calculate the symmetric differences:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ C = {1, 4} ∆ {1, 2, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 4, 5} - {1, 4} = {2, 5}\nA ∆ (B ∆ C) = {1, 2, 3} ∆ {2, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 5} - {2} = {1, 3, 5}\n\nSince (A ∆ B) ∆ C ≠ A ∆ (B ∆ C), the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product."
