    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a given space, in this case, the unit square. It was first introduced by Giuseppe Peano in 1890. Since the Peano curve is a fractal, it has a non-integer dimension, and its length is theoretically infinite.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for the length of a simpler curve that connects the points (0,0) and (1,1) in the unit square, you can use the Pythagorean theorem for a straight line:\n\nLength = √((1-0)² + (1-0)²) = √(1² + 1²) = √2 ≈ 1.414\n\nIn this case, the length of the straight line connecting (0,0) and (1,1) is approximately 1.414. But for the Peano curve, the length is infinite."
