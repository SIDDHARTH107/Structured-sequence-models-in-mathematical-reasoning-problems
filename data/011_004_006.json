    "message_2": "To distribute the 15 students among the 3 groups using the multinomial coefficients formula, we need to first determine the number of students in each group. Let's denote the number of students in Group A as x, in Group B as y, and in Group C as z.\n\nThe equation representing the total number of students is:\n\nx + y + z = 15\n\nTo find the total possible ways of distributing the students among the 3 groups, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula:\n\nMultinomial Coefficient = (n!)/(x! * y! * z!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (15 in this case), and x, y, and z are the number of students in each group.\n\nHowever, since we don't have specific values for x, y, and z, we need to consider all possible combinations of x, y, and z that satisfy the equation x + y + z = 15.\n\nTo find all possible combinations, we can use the stars and bars method. We have 15 students (stars) and need to divide them into 3 groups (2 bars). The total number of ways to arrange the stars and bars is:\n\n(15 + 2)! / (15! * 2!)\n\n= 17! / (15! * 2!)\n\n= (17 * 16) / (2)\n\n= 17 * 8\n\n= 136\n\nSo there are 136 possible ways to distribute the 15 students among the 3 groups using the multinomial coefficients formula."
