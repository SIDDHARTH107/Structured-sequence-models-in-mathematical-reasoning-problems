    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we'll first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x using the chain rule.\n\nGiven equation: x^(2/3) - y^(3/2) = 9\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\n(d/dx)(x^(2/3)) - (d/dx)(y^(3/2)) = (d/dx)(9)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n\n(2/3)x^(-1/3) - (3/2)y^(1/2) * (dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y when x = 27. We can plug x = 27 into the original equation:\n\n(27)^(2/3) - y^(3/2) = 9\n\n9 - y^(3/2) = 9\n\ny^(3/2) = 0\n\ny = 0\n\nNow, we can plug x = 27 and y = 0 back into the differentiated equation:\n\n(2/3)(27)^(-1/3) - (3/2)(0)^(1/2) * (dy/dx) = 0\n\n(2/3)(3)^(-1) - 0 * (dy/dx) = 0\n\n(2/3)(1/3) = dy/dx\n\n(2/9) = dy/dx\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x at the point where x = 27 is dy/dx = 2/9."
