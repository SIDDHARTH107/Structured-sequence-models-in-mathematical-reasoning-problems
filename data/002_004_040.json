    "message_1": "A rectangular room has a length of 15 meters and a width of 8 meters. What is the perimeter of the room in meters?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)\n\nIn this case, the length is 15 meters and the width is 8 meters. So, we plug these values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2(15 + 8)\nPerimeter = 2(23)\nPerimeter = 46 meters\n\nThe perimeter of the room is 46 meters."
