    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 8 cm. What is the length of its longest diagonal?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the longest diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the longest diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the length (l), width (w), and height (h) of the prism:\n\nd^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2\n\nIn this case, the length (l) is 10 cm, the width (w) is 5 cm, and the height (h) is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nd^2 = (10)^2 + (5)^2 + (8)^2\nd^2 = 100 + 25 + 64\nd^2 = 189\n\nNow, to find the length of the longest diagonal (d), we take the square root of 189:\n\nd = √189 ≈ 13.75 cm\n\nSo, the length of the longest diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 13.75 cm."
