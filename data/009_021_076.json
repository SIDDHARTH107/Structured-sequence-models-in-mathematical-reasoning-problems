    "message_1": "A 2D heat distribution system can be modeled using the partial differential equation \n\n∂u/∂t = k (∂^2u/∂x^2 + ∂^2u/∂y^2)\n\nwhere u(x, y, t) is the temperature at position (x, y) and time t, and k is a constant based on the properties of the material being studied.\n\nSuppose a metal plate of dimensions 1m x 1m is heated from below, with u(0, y, t) = 100°C for all y and u(x, 0, t) = u(x, 1, t) = u(1, y, t) = 0°C for all x and y. Initially, the temperature is zero everywhere, so u(x, y, 0) = 0°C.\n\nIf k = 0.2 and we want to find the temperature distribution after 20 seconds, what is the solution of the partial differential equation at this time?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution u(x, y, t) can be written as a product of three functions, one for each variable: u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t).\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)dT(t)/dt = k(X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t))\n\nDividing both sides by kXYT, we get:\n\n(1/kT)dT/dt = X''/X + Y''/Y\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call -λ:\n\n(1/kT)dT/dt = -λ\nX''/X = -μ\nY''/Y = -ν\n\nwhere λ = μ + ν.\n\nNow, we solve each of these ordinary differential equations (ODEs) separately:\n\n1. (1/kT)dT/dt = -λ => dT/dt = -kλT => T(t) = A*exp(-kλt) for some constant A.\n\n2. X''/X = -μ => X'' + μX = 0. This is an ODE with boundary conditions X(0) = X(1) = 0. The non-trivial solutions are given by X_n(x) = sin(nπx) with μ_n = (nπ)^2 for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n3. Y''/Y = -ν => Y'' + νY = 0. This is an ODE with boundary conditions Y(0) = Y(1) = 100. The non-trivial solutions are given by Y_m(y) = B_m*cos(mπy) + C_m*sin(mπy) with ν_m = (mπ)^2 for m = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as a sum of products of these functions:\n\nu(x, y, t) = Σ_(n, m) A_nm * sin(nπx) * (B_m*cos(mπy) + C_m*sin(mπy)) * exp(-k(n^2 + m^2)π^2t)\n\nTo find the coefficients A_nm, B_m, and C_m, we use the initial and boundary conditions:\n\nu(x, y, 0) = 0 => Σ_(n, m) A_nm * sin(nπx) * (B_m*cos(mπy) + C_m*sin(mπy)) = 0\n\nu(0, y, t) = 100 => Σ_(n, m) A_nm * (B_m*cos(mπy) + C_m*sin(mπy)) * exp(-k(n^2 + m^2)π^2t) = 100\n\nu(x, 0, t) = u(x, 1, t) = u(1, y, t) = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we find that B_0 = 100, C_m = 0 for all m, and A_nm = 0 for all n and m except for n = 1 and m = 0, in which case A_10 = 400/π^3. Thus, the solution is given by:\n\nu(x, y, t) = (400/π^3) * sin(πx) * 100 * exp(-kπ^2t)\n\nFor k = 0.2 and t = 20 seconds, the temperature distribution is:\n\nu(x, y, 20) = (400/π^3) * sin(πx) * 100 * exp(-0.2π^2*20)"
