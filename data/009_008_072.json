    "message_1": "A wave in a stretched string is described by the wave equation: \n\n$$u_{xx} = \\frac{1}{c^2}u_{tt},$$\n\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the transverse displacement of the string at position $x$ and time $t$, and $c$ is the speed of propagation of the wave. \n\nSuppose the string is fixed at both ends ($x=0$ and $x=L$) and is initially at rest, i.e., $u(x,0) = 0$ and $u_t(x,0) = 0$ for all $0 \\leq x \\leq L$. \n\nAt time $t=0$, a disturbance is introduced at $x=L/2$ such that the initial displacement of the string is described by: \n\n$$u(x,0) = \\begin{cases} kx/L & \\text{if } 0 \\leq x \\leq L/2 \\\\ k(1-x/L) & \\text{if } L/2 \\leq x \\leq L \\end{cases} $$\n\nwhere $k$ is a constant that measures the magnitude of the disturbance. \n\nDetermine the transverse displacement $u(x,t)$ of the string for all $0 \\leq x \\leq L$ and $t \\geq 0$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$:\n\n$$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t).$$\n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$$X''(x)T(t) = \\frac{1}{c^2}X(x)T''(t).$$\n\nDividing both sides by $X(x)T(t)$, we obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = \\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)}.$$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $x$ and the right-hand side depends only on $t$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = \\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = -\\lambda^2.$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0,$$\n$$T''(t) + c^2\\lambda^2 T(t) = 0.$$\n\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) + B\\sin(\\lambda x).$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $X(0) = X(L) = 0$, we get:\n\n$$A = 0,$$\n$$B\\sin(\\lambda L) = 0.$$\n\nSince $B$ cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have $\\sin(\\lambda L) = 0$. This implies that $\\lambda L = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$, so $\\lambda_n = n\\pi/L$. The solution for $X(x)$ is then:\n\n$$X_n(x) = B_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right).$$\n\nThe general solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$$T(t) = C\\cos(c\\lambda t) + D\\sin(c\\lambda t).$$\n\nSince the string is initially at rest, we have $u_t(x,0) = 0$, which implies $D = 0$. Thus, the solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$$T_n(t) = C_n\\cos\\left(\\frac{cn\\pi t}{L}\\right).$$\n\nThe general solution for $u(x,t)$ is a sum of the product of these functions:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{cn\\pi t}{L}\\right).$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $C_n$, we use the initial displacement condition:\n\n$$u(x,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) = \\begin{cases} kx/L & \\text{if } 0 \\leq x \\leq L/2 \\\\ k(1-x/L) & \\text{if } L/2 \\leq x \\leq L \\end{cases}.$$\n\nWe can find $C_n$ by multiplying both sides by $\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ and integrating from $0$ to $L$:\n\n$$C_m = \\frac{2}{L}\\left[\\int_0^{L/2} \\frac{kx}{L}\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx + \\int_{L/2}^L \\frac{k(1-x/L)}{L}\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx\\right].$$\n\nSolving these integrals, we get:\n\n$$C_m = \\frac{8k}{m^2\\pi^2}\\left[1 - (-1)^m\\right].$$\n\nFinally, the transverse displacement $u(x,t)$ of the string for all $0 \\leq x \\leq L$ and $t \\geq 0$ is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{8k}{n^2\\pi^2}\\left[1 - (-1)^n\\right]\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{cn\\pi t}{L}\\right).$$"
