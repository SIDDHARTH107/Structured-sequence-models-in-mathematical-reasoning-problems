    "message_2": "The Bat Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization method inspired by the echolocation behavior of microbats. It is used to find the global minimum of a function. Here, we will apply the Bat Algorithm to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 in the range [0, 10].\n\n1. Initialize the bat population:\n   - Choose a population size, N (e.g., N = 20).\n   - Randomly generate N bats with positions (x_i) and velocities (v_i) within the range [0, 10].\n   - Set the initial loudness (A_0) and pulse emission rate (r_0) for each bat.\n\n2. Define the objective function:\n   - f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6\n\n3. Set algorithm parameters:\n   - Choose the frequency range (f_min, f_max) (e.g., f_min = 0, f_max = 2).\n   - Set the loudness and pulse rate update parameters (α, γ) (e.g., α = 0.9, γ = 0.9).\n\n4. Start the iterative process:\n   - For each bat i in the population:\n     a. Update the frequency (f_i) using f_min, f_max, and a random value.\n     b. Update the velocity (v_i) using the current position (x_i), the global best position (x_best), and the frequency (f_i).\n     c. Update the position (x_i) using the current position (x_i) and the velocity (v_i).\n     d. Apply a random walk with the current best solution if a random value is greater than the pulse emission rate (r_i).\n     e. Evaluate the objective function (f(x_i)) and update the best solution if a random value is less than the loudness (A_i) and the new solution is better than the current best solution.\n     f. Update the loudness (A_i) and pulse emission rate (r_i) using α and γ.\n\n5. Repeat step 4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a desired level of accuracy).\n\n6. Return the global best solution (x_best) and the minimum value of the function (f(x_best)).\n\nBy applying the Bat Algorithm, we can find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 within the range [0, 10]. Note that the actual minimum value of the function can be found analytically by completing the square or using calculus. The Bat Algorithm is more useful for complex functions where an analytical solution is not available."
