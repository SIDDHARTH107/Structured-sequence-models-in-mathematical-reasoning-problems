    "message_1": "Given that A and B are sets in intuitionistic logic, prove that A ∩ B ⊆ B ∩ A.\n\nNote: Rather than a numerical problem, this is a logical problem that involves proving a set theory statement. The notation A ∩ B denotes the intersection of sets A and B, and A ⊆ B represents the subset relation between sets A and B.",
    "message_2": "To prove that A ∩ B ⊆ B ∩ A, we need to show that for any element x, if x ∈ A ∩ B, then x ∈ B ∩ A.\n\nLet x be an arbitrary element. We will use the definition of intersection and subset to prove the statement.\n\nAssume x ∈ A ∩ B. By the definition of intersection, this means that x ∈ A and x ∈ B.\n\nNow, since x ∈ B and x ∈ A, this satisfies the definition of intersection for B ∩ A. Therefore, x ∈ B ∩ A.\n\nSince x was an arbitrary element, this holds for all elements in A ∩ B. Thus, we have shown that if x ∈ A ∩ B, then x ∈ B ∩ A, which means A ∩ B ⊆ B ∩ A."
