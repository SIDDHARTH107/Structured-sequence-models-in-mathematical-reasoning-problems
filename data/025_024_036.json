    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the equation of the affine algebraic set X as F(x, y, z) = xy - z^2 = 0. To find the tangent vector fields, we need to compute the gradient of F, which is given by:\n\n∇F(x, y, z) = (dF/dx, dF/dy, dF/dz) = (y, x, -2z).\n\nNow, let's consider the constraints given by the surfaces z = 0 and y = 0.\n\n1. For z = 0, we have:\n\n∇F(x, y, 0) = (y, x, 0).\n\nSince we are looking for linearly independent vector fields, we can choose one vector field V1 = (1, 0, 0) which is tangent to the surface z = 0.\n\n2. For y = 0, we have:\n\n∇F(x, 0, z) = (0, x, -2z).\n\nAgain, we can choose one vector field V2 = (0, 1, 0) which is tangent to the surface y = 0.\n\nNow, let's check if these vector fields V1 and V2 are linearly independent. The determinant of the matrix formed by V1 and V2 is:\n\n|V1 V2| = | 1  0 |\n          | 0  1 |\n          | 0  0 |\n\nThe determinant is 1, which is nonzero. Therefore, V1 and V2 are linearly independent.\n\nSo, the maximum number of linearly independent vector fields of X that are tangent to the surfaces z = 0 and y = 0, respectively, is 2."
