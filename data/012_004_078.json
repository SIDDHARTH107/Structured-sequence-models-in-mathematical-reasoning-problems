    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n1. Sort the edges:\n\n   Edge | Weight\n   A-D  | 1\n   B-D  | 2\n   D-E  | 3\n   B-E  | 4\n   A-C  | 5\n   C-D  | 6\n\n2. Start with an empty graph.\n\n3. Add the edges one by one:\n\n   - Add edge A-D (weight 1). The minimum spanning tree now contains edge A-D.\n   - Add edge B-D (weight 2). The minimum spanning tree now contains edges A-D and B-D.\n   - Add edge D-E (weight 3). The minimum spanning tree now contains edges A-D, B-D, and D-E.\n   - Edge B-E (weight 4) would form a cycle with the existing edges, so we skip it.\n   - Add edge A-C (weight 5). The minimum spanning tree now contains edges A-D, B-D, D-E, and A-C.\n   - Edge C-D (weight 6) would form a cycle with the existing edges, so we skip it.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is now complete and contains the edges A-D, B-D, D-E, and A-C. The total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11."
