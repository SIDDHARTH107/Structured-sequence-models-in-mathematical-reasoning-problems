    "message_1": "Suppose there is a population of 500 rabbits on a farm, and their population grows at a rate proportional to their current population. It is observed that the population doubles in size every 5 years. Write a differential equation to model the population growth of rabbits, and use it to find the population after 15 years.",
    "message_2": "To model the population growth of rabbits, we can use the exponential growth equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population of rabbits, t is time in years, and k is the proportionality constant.\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of k. We know that the population doubles every 5 years, so:\n\nP(t=5) = 2 * P(t=0)\n\nLet P(t=0) = P0, which is the initial population of 500 rabbits. Then:\n\n2 * P0 = P0 * e^(5k)\n\nDivide both sides by P0:\n\n2 = e^(5k)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = 5k\n\nNow, solve for k:\n\nk = ln(2) / 5 ≈ 0.1386\n\nNow that we have the value of k, we can use the exponential growth equation to find the population after 15 years:\n\nP(t=15) = P0 * e^(15k)\n\nP(t=15) = 500 * e^(15 * 0.1386) ≈ 500 * e^2.079 ≈ 500 * 7.999 ≈ 3999.5\n\nAfter 15 years, the population of rabbits will be approximately 4000."
