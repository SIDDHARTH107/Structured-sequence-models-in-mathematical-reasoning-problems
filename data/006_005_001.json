    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces light bulbs, and they receive an average of five defective bulbs per day. What is the probability that they will receive at least one defective bulb in a given week (7 days)?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of receiving at least one defective bulb in a week, we can first find the probability of receiving no defective bulbs in a week and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe average number of defective bulbs per day is 5. So, for a week (7 days), the average number of defective bulbs is 5 * 7 = 35.\n\nWe can model this situation using the Poisson distribution. The probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of defective bulbs, λ is the average number of defective bulbs (35 in this case), k is the desired number of defective bulbs, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nWe want to find the probability of receiving no defective bulbs in a week, which means k = 0. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-35) * 35^0) / 0!\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-35) * 1) / 1\nP(X = 0) = e^(-35)\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of receiving at least one defective bulb, which is the complement of receiving no defective bulbs:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - e^(-35)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 1 - 6.1442 × 10^(-16)\n\nSo, the probability of receiving at least one defective bulb in a given week is approximately 0.9999999999999994, or 99.99999999999994%."
