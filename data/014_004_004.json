    "message_2": "To find the order of the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 over the finite field with 17 elements (denoted as F_17), we will use the Hasse's theorem. Hasse's theorem states that the order of an elliptic curve over a finite field F_q lies in the interval [q + 1 - 2√q, q + 1 + 2√q]. In our case, q = 17.\n\nFirst, let's find the interval:\nLower bound = 17 + 1 - 2√17 ≈ 17 - 8.246 = 8.754 (round up to 9)\nUpper bound = 17 + 1 + 2√17 ≈ 17 + 8.246 = 25.246 (round down to 25)\n\nNow, we need to count the number of points on the curve over F_17. We will do this by iterating through all the possible x values (0 to 16) and checking if there is a corresponding y value in F_17 that satisfies the curve equation.\n\nFor each x value, we will calculate the right-hand side of the equation (x^3 + 7x + 10) modulo 17 and check if it is a quadratic residue (i.e., if there exists a y in F_17 such that y^2 is congruent to the calculated value modulo 17). If it is a quadratic residue, there will be two points on the curve for that x value (one for each of the two possible y values). If it is not a quadratic residue, there are no points on the curve for that x value. Additionally, we need to account for the point at infinity, which is always included in the order of an elliptic curve.\n\nLet's calculate the number of points:\n\nPoints = 1 (point at infinity)\n\nFor x in [0, 16]:\n1. Calculate RHS = (x^3 + 7x + 10) % 17\n2. Check if RHS is a quadratic residue in F_17\n3. If yes, add 2 to the number of points\n\nHere are the calculations for each x value:\n\nx = 0: RHS = (0^3 + 7*0 + 10) % 17 = 10 (quadratic residue, add 2 points)\nx = 1: RHS = (1^3 + 7*1 + 10) % 17 = 18 % 17 = 1 (quadratic residue, add 2 points)\nx = 2: RHS = (2^3 + 7*2 + 10) % 17 = 30 % 17 = 13 (quadratic residue, add 2 points)\nx = 3: RHS = (3^3 + 7*3 + 10) % 17 = 52 % 17 = 1 (quadratic residue, add 2 points)\nx = 4: RHS = (4^3 + 7*4 + 10) % 17 = 90 % 17 = 5 (quadratic residue, add 2 points)\nx = 5: RHS = (5^3 + 7*5 + 10) % 17 = 150 % 17 = 11 (quadratic residue, add 2 points)\nx = 6: RHS = (6^3 + 7*6 + 10) % 17 = 244 % 17 = 2 (not a quadratic residue, add 0 points)\nx = 7: RHS = (7^3 + 7*7 + 10) % 17 = 383 % 17 = 16 (quadratic residue, add 2 points)\nx = 8: RHS = (8^3 + 7*8 + 10) % 17 = 586 % 17 = 4 (not a quadratic residue, add 0 points)\nx = 9: RHS = (9^3 + 7*9 + 10) % 17 = 871 % 17 = 1 (quadratic residue, add 2 points)\nx = 10: RHS = (10^3 + 7*10 + 10) % 17 = 1240 % 17 = 5 (quadratic residue, add 2 points)\nx = 11: RHS = (11^3 + 7*11 + 10) % 17 = 1691 % 17 = 11 (quadratic residue, add 2 points)\nx = 12: RHS = (12^3 + 7*12 + 10) % 17 = 2234 % 17 = 16 (quadratic residue, add 2 points)\nx = 13: RHS = (13^3 + 7*13 + 10) % 17 = 2889 % 17 = 2 (not a quadratic residue, add 0 points)\nx = 14: RHS = (14^3 + 7*14 + 10) % 17 = 3674 % 17 = 13 (quadratic residue, add 2 points)\nx = 15: RHS = (15^3 + 7*15 + 10) % 17 = 4601 % 17 = 1 (quadratic residue, add 2 points)\nx = 16: RHS = (16^3 + 7*16 + 10) % 17 = 5706 % 17 = 10 (quadratic residue, add 2 points)\n\nTotal points = 1 (point at infinity) + 2 * 14 (quadratic residues) = 1 + 28 = 29\n\nThe order of the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 over the field with 17 elements is 29."
