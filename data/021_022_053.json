    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has to schedule its production in a way that maximizes its profit. The company can produce two types of vehicles, Truck and Car. Each truck earns a profit of $8000 while each Car earns a profit of $6000. The manufacturing process requires four units of steel and three units of aluminum for each truck, while it requires three units of steel and two units of aluminum for each car. The company has 30 units of steel and 24 units of aluminum available to use every day. Using the firefly algorithm, determine how many trucks and how many cars the company should produce to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is not easily applied to this problem directly. Instead, we can solve this problem using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of Trucks and y be the number of Cars produced.\n\nObjective function (to maximize profit):\nP = 8000x + 6000y\n\nConstraints (based on available resources):\n4x + 3y ≤ 30 (steel constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 24 (aluminum constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Steel constraint:\ny ≤ (30 - 4x) / 3\n\n2. Aluminum constraint:\ny ≤ (24 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of steel and aluminum constraints:\n4x + 3y = 30\n3x + 2y = 24\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\nx = 3, y = 4\n\n2. Intersection of steel constraint with x-axis (y = 0):\n4x + 3(0) = 30\nx = 7.5\n\n3. Intersection of aluminum constraint with y-axis (x = 0):\n3(0) + 2y = 24\ny = 12\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are (0, 12), (7.5, 0), and (3, 4).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function P = 8000x + 6000y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 12) = 8000(0) + 6000(12) = $72,000\n2. P(7.5, 0) = 8000(7.5) + 6000(0) = $60,000\n3. P(3, 4) = 8000(3) + 6000(4) = $48,000\n\nSince the objective is to maximize the profit, the company should produce 0 Trucks and 12 Cars to achieve a maximum profit of $72,000."
