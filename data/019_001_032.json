    "message_2": "To write the truth table for the given statements, let's use the following symbols:\n\n- R: It is raining\n- I: I will stay indoors\n\nThe given statements can be represented as:\n\n1. If it is raining, then I will stay indoors: R → I\n2. Either it is not raining or I will stay indoors: ¬R ∨ I\n\nNow, let's create the truth table:\n\n| R | I | ¬R | R → I | ¬R ∨ I |\n|---|---|----|-------|--------|\n| T | T | F  |   T   |   T    |\n| T | F | F  |   F   |   F    |\n| F | T | T  |   T   |   T    |\n| F | F | T  |   T   |   T    |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the columns for R → I and ¬R ∨ I are identical, which means the two statements are logically equivalent."
