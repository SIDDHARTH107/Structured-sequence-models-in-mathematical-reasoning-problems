    "message_2": "The minimum initial angle required for a double pendulum system to exhibit chaotic behavior cannot be determined precisely as a numerical value. The onset of chaos in a double pendulum system depends on various factors, such as the lengths and masses of the pendulum rods, as well as the initial conditions of the angles and angular velocities.\n\nHowever, it is known that even small initial angles can lead to chaotic behavior in a double pendulum system. The chaotic behavior arises from the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions, which means that even tiny differences in the initial angles can lead to drastically different outcomes."
