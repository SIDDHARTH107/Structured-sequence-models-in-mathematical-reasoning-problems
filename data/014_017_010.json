    "message_1": "A ciphertext has been encrypted using a Caesar cipher which involves shifting the letter positions by a certain number. The frequency analysis of the ciphertext shows that the letter \"e\" appears the most frequently, representing 12.5% of the total letters in the ciphertext. What is the number of letter positions that the message has been shifted by?",
    "message_2": "In a Caesar cipher, the most common letter in the English language is \"e.\" If the frequency analysis shows that \"e\" is the most frequent letter in the ciphertext, it is likely that \"e\" has been shifted to the position of the most common letter in the plaintext. The most common letter in English is \"e\" as well, so it is likely that the message has not been shifted at all, or has been shifted by 26 positions (which is equivalent to no shift since there are 26 letters in the alphabet). Therefore, the number of letter positions that the message has been shifted by is 0 or 26."
