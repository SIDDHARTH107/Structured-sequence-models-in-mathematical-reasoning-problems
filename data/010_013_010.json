    "message_2": "To find the degree of the map induced by the global section s on the first cohomology group with real coefficients, we first need to understand the cohomology of the real projective plane RP^2.\n\nThe cohomology ring of RP^2 is given by H^*(RP^2; R) = R[a]/(a^3), where |a| = 1, i.e., a is a generator of H^1(RP^2; R). The first cohomology group H^1(RP^2; R) is thus generated by a.\n\nNow, let's consider the global section s. Since the zero set of s is a circle, it is a smooth submanifold of RP^2. Let's denote this circle by C. The inclusion map i: C → RP^2 induces a map on cohomology groups i*: H^1(RP^2; R) → H^1(C; R).\n\nThe circle C is homotopy equivalent to the real projective line RP^1, which is also homotopy equivalent to the circle S^1. The first cohomology group of S^1 is generated by a single element, say b, i.e., H^1(S^1; R) = R[b].\n\nNow, we want to find the degree of the map induced by s on the first cohomology group with real coefficients, i.e., the degree of the map i*: H^1(RP^2; R) → H^1(C; R). To do this, we need to find the integer n such that i*(a) = n * b.\n\nSince C is a circle, it has a non-trivial fundamental group, and thus, the map i* is non-trivial. This means that i*(a) is a non-zero multiple of b. Moreover, since the circle C is a submanifold of RP^2, the map i* is injective, so the degree of i* must be 1.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the map induced by s on the first cohomology group with real coefficients is 1."
