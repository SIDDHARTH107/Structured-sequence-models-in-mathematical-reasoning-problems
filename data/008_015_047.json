    "message_2": "First, we need to write the given system of linear equations in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the variable matrix, and b is the constant matrix.\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 2  5 -4 |\n    |-2 -4  1 |\n\nb = |  5 |\n    |  7 |\n    | -8 |\n\nNow, we need to find the Cholesky decomposition of the matrix A. The Cholesky decomposition is a lower triangular matrix L such that A = L * L^T, where L^T is the transpose of L.\n\nL = | l11  0   0  |\n    | l21 l22  0  |\n    | l31 l32 l33 |\n\nWe can find the elements of L using the following formulas:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(1) = 1\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 2 / 1 = 2\nl31 = a31 / l11 = -2 / 1 = -2\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(5 - 2^2) = sqrt(1) = 1\nl32 = (a32 - l31 * l21) / l22 = (-4 - (-2) * 2) / 1 = 0\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = sqrt(1 - (-2)^2 - 0^2) = sqrt(5)\n\nSo, the Cholesky decomposition L is:\n\nL = |  1  0    0   |\n    |  2  1    0   |\n    | -2  0  sqrt(5)|\n\nNow, we need to solve the system L * y = b for y:\n\n|  1  0    0   | | y1 |   |  5 |\n|  2  1    0   | | y2 | = |  7 |\n| -2  0  sqrt(5)| | y3 |   |-8  |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 5\ny2 = 7 - 2 * y1 = 7 - 2 * 5 = -3\ny3 = (-8 - (-2) * y1) / sqrt(5) = (-8 + 10) / sqrt(5) = 2 / sqrt(5)\n\nNow, we need to solve the system L^T * x = y for x:\n\n|  1  2 -2 | | x1 |   |  5          |\n|  0  1  0  | | x2 | = | -3          |\n|  0  0  sqrt(5)| | x3 |   | 2 / sqrt(5) |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx3 = (2 / sqrt(5)) / sqrt(5) = 2 / 5\nx2 = -3\nx1 = 5 - 2 * x2 + 2 * x3 = 5 + 6 + 0.8 = 11.8\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx1 ≈ 11.80\nx2 ≈ -3.00\nx3 ≈ 0.40"
