    "message_2": "To solve the equation 3x ≡ 27 (mod 10), we first simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n27 (mod 10) is congruent to 7 (mod 10) since 27 - 7 = 20, which is a multiple of 10.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n3x ≡ 7 (mod 10)\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverse of 3 (mod 10). The modular inverse of a number a (mod m) is a number x such that ax ≡ 1 (mod m).\n\nIn this case, we are looking for a number x such that 3x ≡ 1 (mod 10). By trying different values of x, we find that x = 7 satisfies this condition:\n\n3 * 7 = 21 ≡ 1 (mod 10)\n\nSo, the modular inverse of 3 (mod 10) is 7.\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation 3x ≡ 7 (mod 10) by the modular inverse of 3 (mod 10), which is 7:\n\n7 * 3x ≡ 7 * 7 (mod 10)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx ≡ 49 (mod 10)\n\nFinally, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n49 (mod 10) is congruent to 9 (mod 10) since 49 - 9 = 40, which is a multiple of 10.\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is:\n\nx ≡ 9 (mod 10)"
