    "message_1": "A salesperson wants to visit 5 cities in a specific order and then return to the starting city. The distances (in miles) between the cities are given below: \n\nCity  | A | B | C | D | E |\n------|---|---|---|---|---|\nA     | 0 | 10| 8 | 9 | 7 |\nB     |10 | 0 | 5 | 6 | 8 |\nC     | 8 | 5 | 0 | 7 | 6 |\nD     | 9 | 6 | 7 | 0 | 4 |\nE     | 7 | 8 | 6 | 4 | 0 |\n\nWhat is the shortest possible distance that the salesperson can travel to visit all 5 cities and return to the starting city?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance, we need to add the distances between the cities in the specific order and then add the distance from the last city back to the starting city.\n\nLet's say the salesperson starts at city A and visits the cities in the order B, C, D, and E. The total distance would be:\n\nA to B: 10 miles\nB to C: 5 miles\nC to D: 7 miles\nD to E: 4 miles\nE to A: 7 miles\n\nTotal distance = 10 + 5 + 7 + 4 + 7 = 33 miles\n\nSo, the shortest possible distance that the salesperson can travel to visit all 5 cities and return to the starting city is 33 miles."
