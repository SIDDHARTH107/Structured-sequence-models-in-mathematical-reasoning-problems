    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, width of 3 cm and height of 4 cm. What is the length of its diagonal?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal (D) can be found using the formula:\n\nD = √(L^2 + W^2 + H^2)\n\nwhere L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height of the rectangular prism.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: L = 5 cm, W = 3 cm, and H = 4 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = √(5^2 + 3^2 + 4^2)\nD = √(25 + 9 + 16)\nD = √50\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √50 cm, or approximately 7.07 cm."
