    "message_1": "If the probability of a certain political event occurring on any given day in a country is 0.15, what is the probability of this event occurring exactly 3 times in a week (7 days)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of the event occurring exactly k times\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 7 days)\n- k is the number of successful trials (in this case, 3 days)\n- p is the probability of success on any given day (0.15)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure on any given day (1 - 0.15 = 0.85)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 3) = (7C3) * (0.15^3) * (0.85^4)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 7C3:\n\n7C3 = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) = 7! / (3!4!) = (7*6*5) / (3*2*1) = 35\n\nNow, let's calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = 35 * (0.15^3) * (0.85^4) ≈ 35 * 0.003375 * 0.52200625 ≈ 0.216\n\nSo, the probability of the political event occurring exactly 3 times in a week is approximately 0.216 or 21.6%."
