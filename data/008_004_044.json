Let's write the system of linear equations:\n\nx + 3y + 2z = 0\n-y - z = 0\nz = 0\n\nFrom the last equation, we have z = 0. Now, we can use back-substitution to find the other variables:\n\n-y - z = 0\n-y = 0\ny = 0\n\nx + 3y + 2z = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo, the solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
