    "message_1": "In a population of 5000 people, the probability of having a certain medical condition is 0.06. What is the expected number of people who have the condition in this population?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of people with the condition, we can multiply the population size by the probability of having the condition.\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = Population size × Probability of having the condition\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = 5000 × 0.06\n\nExpected number of people with the condition = 300\n\nSo, in this population of 5000 people, we can expect that around 300 people have the medical condition."
