    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, player A is given $10 and must decide how much of it to give to player B. Player B then receives the amount given by player A and must decide how much of it to return to player A. If player B decides to return 50% of what he/she received, how much money did player A end up with?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount of money player A gives to player B. Since player B returns 50% of what he/she received, player B will return 0.5x to player A. \n\nPlayer A initially had $10 and gave x to player B, so player A has $10 - x left. After receiving 0.5x back from player B, player A's total amount of money is:\n\n$10 - x + 0.5x = 10 - 0.5x\n\nTo find the exact amount player A ends up with, we need to know the value of x (the amount given to player B)."
