    "message_2": "To apply the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 5x + 3. The derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 5\n\nThe Newton-Raphson formula is:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nWe are given the initial approximation x0 = 1.5. Let's apply the Newton-Raphson method iteratively until we reach the desired accuracy of four decimal places.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = 1.5 - (1.5^3 - 5(1.5) + 3) / (3(1.5)^2 - 5)\nx1 = 1.5 - (3.375 - 7.5 + 3) / (6.75 - 5)\nx1 = 1.5 - (-1.125) / 1.75\nx1 ≈ 2.1429\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = 2.1429 - (2.1429^3 - 5(2.1429) + 3) / (3(2.1429)^2 - 5)\nx2 ≈ 2.0946\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = 2.0946 - (2.0946^3 - 5(2.0946) + 3) / (3(2.0946)^2 - 5)\nx3 ≈ 2.0946\n\nSince x3 and x2 are the same up to four decimal places, we can conclude that the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 5x + 3, using the Newton-Raphson method with an initial approximation of x0 = 1.5, is approximately x ≈ 2.0946."
