    "message_2": "To prove that there are no non-isomorphic groups of order 12 other than the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, and the dihedral group D6, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 12.\n\nFirst, we note that 12 = 2^2 * 3, so by the Sylow theorems, there exist Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Let n_2 and n_3 denote the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G, respectively.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we have:\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have two possibilities for n_2 and n_3: (n_2, n_3) = (1, 1) or (n_2, n_3) = (3, 4).\n\nCase 1: (n_2, n_3) = (1, 1)\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Since both P and Q are normal in G, we have G = PQ. Since |P| = 4 and |Q| = 3, we have |P ∩ Q| = 1, and thus G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q. If P is cyclic, then P ≅ C4, and if Q is cyclic, then Q ≅ C3. In this case, G ≅ C4 × C3 ≅ C12, which is the cyclic group of order 12.\n\nCase 2: (n_2, n_3) = (3, 4)\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Since there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, and each has order 4, the total number of elements of order 2 in G is 3 * (4 - 1) = 9. Therefore, there are only three elements left in G, which must be of order 3. This means that there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q, which is normal in G.\n\nNow, consider the action of G on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation. This action gives a homomorphism φ: G → S_3. Since Q is normal in G, it is in the kernel of φ. If φ is trivial, then G is a direct product of P and Q, and we have G ≅ C4 × C3 ≅ C12, which is the cyclic group of order 12. However, we have already considered this case, so we assume φ is nontrivial.\n\nSince φ is nontrivial, its image must be a nontrivial subgroup of S_3. The only possibilities for the image of φ are A_3 or S_3. If the image of φ is A_3, then G/Q ≅ A_3, and G is an extension of Q by A_3. In this case, G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4.\n\nIf the image of φ is S_3, then G/Q ≅ S_3, and G is an extension of Q by S_3. In this case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that there are no non-isomorphic groups of order 12 other than the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, and the dihedral group D6."
