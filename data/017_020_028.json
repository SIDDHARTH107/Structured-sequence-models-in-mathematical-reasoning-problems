    "message_2": "To determine the number of subgroups of order 5 in group G, we can use Sylow's Theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 40, we can write it as a product of its prime factors: 40 = 2^3 * 5^1.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 5-subgroups of G. According to Sylow's First Theorem, there exists at least one subgroup of order 5 (since 5 is a prime factor of 40). Let n_5 denote the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G. By Sylow's Third Theorem, we know that n_5 must divide the index of the 5-Sylow subgroup in G, which is 40/5 = 8. Therefore, n_5 must be a divisor of 8. The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8.\n\nSylow's Third Theorem also states that n_5 must be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Among the divisors of 8, only 1 satisfies this condition (since 1 â‰¡ 1 (mod 5)). Therefore, there is only 1 Sylow 5-subgroup in G, and thus G has exactly 1 subgroup of order 5."
