    "message_2": "The Menger Sponge is a fractal created by iteratively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube and the six cubes that share a face with the central cube are removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nIn level 3 of the Menger Sponge, this process has been applied three times. To find the total number of smaller cubes in level 3, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of smaller cubes = (20^n)\n\nwhere n is the level of the Menger Sponge.\n\nFor level 3, n = 3, so:\n\nTotal number of smaller cubes = (20^3) = 8000"
