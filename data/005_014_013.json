    "message_2": "In factor analysis, factor loadings represent the relationship between each variable and the extracted factors. In this scenario, we have 10 variables and want to extract 3 factors. \n\nTo calculate the number of unique factor loadings, we simply multiply the number of variables by the number of factors:\n\n10 variables * 3 factors = 30 unique factor loadings"
