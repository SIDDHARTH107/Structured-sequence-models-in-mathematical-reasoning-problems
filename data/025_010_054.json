    "message_1": "Consider the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let $K$ be the field generated by the $x$-coordinate of the point $P = (0, 1)$. Determine the degree of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and compute the genus of the curve $E$ over $K$.",
    "message_2": "Since the point $P = (0, 1)$ is on the curve $E: y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1$, we can plug in the coordinates of $P$ into the equation of the curve:\n\n$1^2 = 0^3 + 2(0) + 1$\n\n$1 = 1$\n\nThis confirms that $P$ is indeed a point on the curve. Now, we are asked to find the degree of the field extension $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, where $K$ is generated by the $x$-coordinate of $P$. Since the $x$-coordinate of $P$ is $0$, which is already an element of $\\mathbb{Q}$, the field $K$ is just $\\mathbb{Q}$ itself. Therefore, the degree of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[K : \\mathbb{Q}] = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to compute the genus of the curve $E$ over $K$. For an elliptic curve, the genus is always equal to $1$. This is because an elliptic curve is a smooth projective curve of degree $3$, and the genus can be computed using the formula:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the curve. In this case, $d = 3$, so the genus is:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$\n\nThus, the genus of the curve $E$ over $K$ is $1$."
