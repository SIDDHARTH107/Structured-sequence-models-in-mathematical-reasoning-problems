    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a regular tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. After each iteration, the number of tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nLet's denote the number of tetrahedra at each iteration as T(n), where n is the iteration number. At the first iteration (n=1), there are 4 tetrahedra.\n\nFor the subsequent iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nT(n) = 4 * T(n-1)\n\nWe want to find the total number of tetrahedra after 4 iterations. So, we can calculate T(4) as follows:\n\nT(1) = 4\nT(2) = 4 * T(1) = 4 * 4 = 16\nT(3) = 4 * T(2) = 4 * 16 = 64\nT(4) = 4 * T(3) = 4 * 64 = 256\n\nSo, there are 256 tetrahedra in the Sierpinski tetrahedron after 4 iterations."
