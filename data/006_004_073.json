    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting a sum of 7 on two rolls of a fair six-sided die, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a 7) and divide that by the total number of possible outcomes (all possible rolls).\n\nThere are 6 sides on each die, so there are 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice. \n\nNow let's find the number of favorable outcomes. There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7:\n1. Roll a 1 on the first die and a 6 on the second die (1, 6)\n2. Roll a 2 on the first die and a 5 on the second die (2, 5)\n3. Roll a 3 on the first die and a 4 on the second die (3, 4)\n4. Roll a 4 on the first die and a 3 on the second die (4, 3)\n5. Roll a 5 on the first die and a 2 on the second die (5, 2)\n6. Roll a 6 on the first die and a 1 on the second die (6, 1)\n\nThere are 6 favorable outcomes.\n\nThe probability of getting a sum of 7 on two rolls of a fair six-sided die is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 6 / 36 = 1 / 6\n\nSo the probability of getting a sum of 7 on two rolls of a fair six-sided die is 1/6 or approximately 0.1667."
