Also, find the percentage of the total stock price variance explained by each component.",
    "message_2": "The given function is already in the form of a Fourier series, which is a sum of sine and/or cosine functions with different frequencies and amplitudes. In this case, we have three sine functions with different frequencies and amplitudes.\n\nComponent 1:\nAmplitude: 10\nFrequency: 2π (1 cycle per year)\n\nComponent 2:\nAmplitude: 5\nFrequency: 6π (3 cycles per year)\n\nComponent 3:\nAmplitude: 3\nFrequency: 10π (5 cycles per year)\n\nTo find the percentage of the total stock price variance explained by each component, we first need to find the total variance. The variance of a sine function with amplitude A is given by the formula:\n\nVariance = (A^2) / 2\n\nTotal Variance = Variance of Component 1 + Variance of Component 2 + Variance of Component 3\n\nTotal Variance = (10^2)/2 + (5^2)/2 + (3^2)/2\nTotal Variance = 100/2 + 25/2 + 9/2\nTotal Variance = 50 + 12.5 + 4.5\nTotal Variance = 67\n\nNow, we can find the percentage of the total variance explained by each component:\n\nPercentage of Component 1 = (Variance of Component 1 / Total Variance) * 100\nPercentage of Component 1 = (50 / 67) * 100 ≈ 74.63%\n\nPercentage of Component 2 = (Variance of Component 2 / Total Variance) * 100\nPercentage of Component 2 = (12.5 / 67) * 100 ≈ 18.66%\n\nPercentage of Component 3 = (Variance of Component 3 / Total Variance) * 100\nPercentage of Component 3 = (4.5 / 67) * 100 ≈ 6.72%\n\nSo, the percentages of the total stock price variance explained by each component are approximately 74.63% for Component 1, 18.66% for Component 2, and 6.72% for Component 3."
