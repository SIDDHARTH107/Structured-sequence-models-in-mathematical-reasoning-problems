The coffee shop owner randomly selects 20 customers and records their total spending. The data collected are as follows: \n\n$10, 12, 8, 16, 14, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 10, 7, 12, 14, 8, 9, 15, 11, 13, 16$\n\nFind the sample mean, sample standard deviation, and the 95% confidence interval for the population mean spending by the customers in the coffee shop.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the sample mean (x̄) by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values (n = 20).\n\nx̄ = (10 + 12 + 8 + 16 + 14 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 10 + 7 + 12 + 14 + 8 + 9 + 15 + 11 + 13 + 16) / 20\nx̄ = 248 / 20\nx̄ = 12.4\n\nNext, let's find the sample standard deviation (s). First, we need to find the sum of the squared differences between each value and the sample mean.\n\nΣ(xi - x̄)² = (10-12.4)² + (12-12.4)² + ... + (13-12.4)² + (16-12.4)²\nΣ(xi - x̄)² = 1.96 + 0.16 + ... + 0.36 + 12.96\nΣ(xi - x̄)² = 130.8\n\nNow, we can find the sample standard deviation (s) by dividing the sum of squared differences by (n-1) and taking the square root.\n\ns = √(Σ(xi - x̄)² / (n-1))\ns = √(130.8 / 19)\ns ≈ 2.63\n\nFinally, let's find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean (μ). We will use the t-distribution since the population standard deviation is unknown. For a 95% confidence interval and 19 degrees of freedom (n-1), the t-value is approximately 2.093.\n\nMargin of error (ME) = t * (s / √n)\nME = 2.093 * (2.63 / √20)\nME ≈ 1.22\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the population mean is:\n\nLower limit = x̄ - ME = 12.4 - 1.22 ≈ 11.18\nUpper limit = x̄ + ME = 12.4 + 1.22 ≈ 13.62\n\nSo, the sample mean is 12.4, the sample standard deviation is approximately 2.63, and the 95% confidence interval for the population mean spending by the customers in the coffee shop is approximately $11.18 to $13.62."
