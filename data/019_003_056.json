    "message_2": "In modal logic, the modal formula that expresses \"p is necessarily true\" is denoted by the symbol \"□p\" (read as \"box p\" or \"necessarily p\"). However, in the given scenario, p is not true in all possible worlds (it is false in w2). Therefore, it is not correct to say that p is necessarily true in this case. If p were true in all possible worlds, then the modal formula □p would accurately represent \"p is necessarily true.\""
