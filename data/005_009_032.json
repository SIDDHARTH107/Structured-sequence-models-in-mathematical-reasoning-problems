    "message_1": "A medical study wants to test whether a certain medication increases the average survival time of patients with a specific disease. The researchers do not know the distribution of survival times in the population, so they decide to use a non-parametric test. \n\nThe survival times (in months) of a random sample of 12 patients who receive the medication are:\n\n{5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 12, 13, 16, 21, 23, 25, 30}\n\nThe survival times (in months) of a random sample of 10 patients who do not receive the medication are:\n\n{4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25}\n\nCan you conduct a two-sample non-parametric test to determine whether the medication increases the average survival time of patients (at 5% significance level)?",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the medication increases the average survival time of patients, we can use the Mann-Whitney U test, which is a non-parametric test that compares the distributions of two independent samples.\n\nFirst, let's combine and rank the data:\n\nCombined data: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 25, 30}\n\nRanks: \nMedication group (12 patients): {2, 4, 6.5, 8.5, 10, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19, 20.5, 22}\nControl group (10 patients): {1, 3, 5, 6.5, 8.5, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20.5}\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of ranks for each group:\n\nSum of ranks for medication group: 2 + 4 + 6.5 + 8.5 + 10 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 17 + 19 + 20.5 + 22 = 135.5\nSum of ranks for control group: 1 + 3 + 5 + 6.5 + 8.5 + 13 + 15 + 16 + 18 + 20.5 = 106.5\n\nNext, we calculate the Mann-Whitney U statistic for each group:\n\nU1 = n1 * n2 + (n1 * (n1 + 1)) / 2 - R1\nU2 = n1 * n2 + (n2 * (n2 + 1)) / 2 - R2\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the sample sizes of the medication and control groups, and R1 and R2 are the sum of ranks for each group.\n\nU1 = 12 * 10 + (12 * 13) / 2 - 135.5 = 120 + 78 - 135.5 = 62.5\nU2 = 12 * 10 + (10 * 11) / 2 - 106.5 = 120 + 55 - 106.5 = 68.5\n\nNow, we take the smaller U value (U1 = 62.5) and compare it to the critical value for a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level. For a sample size of 12 and 10, the critical value can be found in the Mann-Whitney U test table, which is 40.\n\nSince our U value (62.5) is greater than the critical value (40), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, at a 5% significance level, we cannot conclude that the medication increases the average survival time of patients with the specific disease."
