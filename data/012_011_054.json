    "message_1": "Consider a connected undirected graph with 9 vertices and 12 edges. How many cut vertices and bridges does the graph have?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of cut vertices and bridges in the graph, we need to analyze its structure. However, since the specific structure of the graph is not provided, we cannot give an exact number of cut vertices and bridges. \n\nIn general, a cut vertex is a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nThe number of cut vertices and bridges depends on the specific arrangement of vertices and edges in the graph. For example, if the graph is a tree (i.e., a connected graph with no cycles), then there will be more bridges, as every edge is a bridge. On the other hand, if the graph has cycles, then there will be fewer bridges, as removing an edge within a cycle will not necessarily disconnect the graph.\n\nIn summary, without knowing the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact number of cut vertices and bridges."
