They can be described using their group presentation or by their Small Group label in the format SmallGroup(n, k), where n is the order of the group and k is the index in the list of non-isomorphic groups of that order.\n\n1. C96 (Cyclic group of order 96)\n2. C48 x C2\n3. C32 x C3\n4. C32 : C3 (Semidirect product of C32 and C3)\n5. C16 x C6\n6. C16 : C6 (Semidirect product of C16 and C6)\n7. C8 x C12\n8. C8 x (C4 x C3)\n9. C8 : C12 (Semidirect product of C8 and C12)\n10. C4 x C4 x C6\n11. C4 x (C4 : C6) (Semidirect product of C4 and C6)\n12. (C4 x C4) : C6 (Semidirect product of C4 x C4 and C6)\n13.

(C2 x C2 x C2 x C2) : C6 (Semidirect product of C2 x C2 x C2 x C2 and C6)\n\nThese groups can be further analyzed using their group presentation or by examining their properties, such as their subgroups, normal subgroups, and quotient groups."
