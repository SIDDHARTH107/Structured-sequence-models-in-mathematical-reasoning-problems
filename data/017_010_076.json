    "message_2": "A group of order 10 has a total of 10 elements. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. Therefore, the possible orders of subgroups for a group of order 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n\n1. There is always one trivial subgroup of order 1, which contains only the identity element.\n\n2. For subgroups of order 2, we are looking for elements of order 2. In a group of order 10, there must be at least one element of order 2 (by Cauchy's theorem). Let's denote this element as x. Then, the subgroup {e, x} has order 2, where e is the identity element.\n\n3. For subgroups of order 5, we are looking for elements of order 5. In a group of order 10, there must be at least one element of order 5 (by Cauchy's theorem). Let's denote this element as y. Then, the subgroup {e, y, y^2, y^3, y^4} has order 5.\n\n4. There is always one subgroup of order 10, which is the group itself.\n\nIn summary, a group of order 10 has at least four subgroups: one of order 1, one of order 2, one of order 5, and one of order 10. The structures of these subgroups are {e}, {e, x}, {e, y, y^2, y^3, y^4}, and the group itself, respectively. Note that there could be more subgroups depending on the specific group, but these are the minimum number of subgroups for a group of order 10."
