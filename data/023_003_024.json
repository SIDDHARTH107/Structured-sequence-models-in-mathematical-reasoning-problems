    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x is the position along the rod.\n\nSince the ends of the rod are maintained at a fixed temperature of 10°C, we have the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0, t) = T(L, t) = 10°C\n\nwhere L is the length of the rod (10 cm in this case).\n\nThe initial condition is that the rod is at a uniform temperature of 20°C:\n\nT(x, 0) = 20°C\n\nWe can solve this problem using the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat conduction equation, we get:\n\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = α T(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nDividing both sides by αXT, we get:\n\n(1/αT) ∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X) ∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on position, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ²:\n\n(1/αT) ∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²\n(1/X) ∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1. ∂²X(x)/∂x² + λ²X(x) = 0, with boundary conditions X(0) = X(L) = 0\n2. ∂T(t)/∂t + αλ²T(t) = 0\n\nThe first equation is an eigenvalue problem, and its solutions are given by:\n\nX_n(x) = sin(nπx/L), with λ_n = nπ/L\n\nThe second equation is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is given by:\n\nT_n(t) = exp(-αλ_n²t)\n\nThe temperature distribution can be represented as a sum of these solutions:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ [A_n sin(nπx/L) exp(-αλ_n²t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the initial condition T(x, 0) = 20°C:\n\n20 = Σ [A_n sin(nπx/L)]\n\nWe can determine the coefficients A_n by using the orthogonality property of sine functions and integrating over the length of the rod:\n\nA_n = (2/L) ∫[0,L] T(x, 0) sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nFor n = 0, A_0 = 0 since the integral evaluates to 0.\n\nFor n > 0, we have:\n\nA_n = (2/L) ∫[0,L] 20 sin(nπx/L) dx\nA_n = (40/nπ) [1 - (-1)^n]\n\nNow we can write the temperature distribution as:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ [(40/nπ) [1 - (-1)^n] sin(nπx/L) exp(-αλ_n²t)]\n\nWe want to find the temperature distribution after 0.1 seconds. Plugging in the given values (L = 10 cm, α = 2 cm²/s, and t = 0.1 s), we get:\n\nT(x, 0.1) = Σ [(40/nπ) [1 - (-1)^n] sin(nπx/10) exp(-2(nπ/10)²*0.1)]\n\nTo get an accurate approximation, we can sum the first few terms of the series (e.g., n = 1 to 10):\n\nT(x, 0.1) ≈ Σ [(40/nπ) [1 - (-1)^n] sin(nπx/10) exp(-2(nπ/10)²*0.1)] for n = 1 to 10\n\nThis expression gives the temperature distribution in the rod after 0.1 seconds."
