    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of the population of apples, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √Sample Size\n\nGiven the information provided:\nMean = 150 grams\nStandard Deviation = 10 grams\nSample Size = 30\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 10 / √30 ≈ 1.826\n\nNow, let's calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 1.826 ≈ 3.579\n\nFinally, let's calculate the confidence interval:\n\nLower Limit = 150 - 3.579 ≈ 146.421 grams\nUpper Limit = 150 + 3.579 ≈ 153.579 grams\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of the population of apples is approximately (146.421 grams, 153.579 grams)."
