    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2 cos(2x) = 1, we first need to isolate the cosine function:\n\ncos(2x) = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the angles whose cosine is 1/2. Since the range of x is between 0 and π, we need to consider the range of 2x, which is between 0 and 2π. \n\nIn this range, there are two angles whose cosine is 1/2:\n\n2x = π/3 (60°) and 2x = 5π/3 (300°)\n\nNow, we need to solve for x in each case:\n\nCase 1: 2x = π/3\nx = (π/3) / 2\nx = π/6\n\nCase 2: 2x = 5π/3\nx = (5π/3) / 2\nx = 5π/6\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the given range are x = π/6 and x = 5π/6."
