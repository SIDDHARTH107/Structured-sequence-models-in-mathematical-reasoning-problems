    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, let's rewrite the constraints as equalities:\n\n1) x^2 + y^2 = 4\n2) x + y = 1\n\nNow, define the Lagrangian function L(x, y, λ, μ):\n\nL(x, y, λ, μ) = x + 2y + λ(4 - x^2 - y^2) + μ(1 - x - y)\n\nNext, we will find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, λ, and μ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x = 1 - 2λx - μ = 0\n∂L/∂y = 2 - 2λy - μ = 0\n∂L/∂λ = 4 - x^2 - y^2 = 0\n∂L/∂μ = 1 - x - y = 0\n\nNow we have a system of four equations with four unknowns (x, y, λ, μ):\n\n1) 1 - 2λx - μ = 0\n2) 2 - 2λy - μ = 0\n3) 4 - x^2 - y^2 = 0\n4) 1 - x - y = 0\n\nFrom equation (4), we can express x as x = 1 - y. Substituting this into equation (3), we get:\n\n4 - (1 - y)^2 - y^2 = 0\n4 - (1 - 2y + y^2) - y^2 = 0\n4 - 1 + 2y - y^2 - y^2 = 0\n3 + 2y - 2y^2 = 0\n\nDivide by -1:\n\n2y^2 - 2y - 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(2y + 1)(y - 3) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible values for y: y = -1/2 and y = 3. However, since x^2 + y^2 <= 4, the value y = 3 is not possible. Therefore, y = -1/2.\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding value of x:\n\nx = 1 - y = 1 - (-1/2) = 3/2\n\nNow we can find the values of λ and μ using equations (1) and (2):\n\n1) 1 - 2λ(3/2) - μ = 0\n2) 2 - 2λ(-1/2) - μ = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we get λ = 1/4 and μ = 1/2.\n\nFinally, we can find the maximum value of the objective function:\n\nx + 2y = (3/2) + 2(-1/2) = 3/2 - 1 = 1/2\n\nThus, the maximum value of the objective function is 1/2."
