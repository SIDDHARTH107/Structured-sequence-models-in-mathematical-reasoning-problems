    "message_1": "Given that there are 50 students in a classroom, and each student can opt for either Mathematics, Science, or Arts, and 20 students have opted for Mathematics and 25 students have opted for Science, how many students have opted for Arts? Using abductive logic, provide a possible explanation as to why this many students have opted for Arts.",
    "message_2": "To find out how many students have opted for Arts, we can subtract the number of students who have opted for Mathematics and Science from the total number of students.\n\nTotal students = 50\nMathematics students = 20\nScience students = 25\n\nArts students = Total students - (Mathematics students + Science students)\nArts students = 50 - (20 + 25)\nArts students = 50 - 45\nArts students = 5\n\nSo, 5 students have opted for Arts.\n\nUsing abductive logic, a possible explanation for why only 5 students have opted for Arts could be that the school has a strong emphasis on STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), which may have influenced the students' choices. Additionally, the school might have more experienced or popular teachers in Mathematics and Science, leading to more students choosing those subjects over Arts."
