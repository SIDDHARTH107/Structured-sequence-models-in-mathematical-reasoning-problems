    "message_2": "The poles of a complex function are the values of z for which the function becomes infinite, i.e., the values of z that make the denominator equal to zero. In this case, we need to find the values of z that satisfy the equation:\n\n$$(z-3)^3(z^2+2) = 0$$\n\nThis equation has two factors: $(z-3)^3$ and $(z^2+2)$. \n\nFor the first factor, $(z-3)^3 = 0$, we have a pole at z = 3. Since the exponent is 3, this is a pole of order 3.\n\nFor the second factor, $z^2+2 = 0$, we need to solve for z:\n\n$$z^2 = -2$$\n\nThis equation has two complex solutions: \n\n$$z = \\pm \\sqrt{-2} = \\pm i\\sqrt{2}$$\n\nThese are both simple poles since the exponent is 1.\n\nIn summary, the poles of the complex function are:\n\n- z = 3 (pole of order 3)\n- z = i√2 (simple pole)\n- z = -i√2 (simple pole)"
