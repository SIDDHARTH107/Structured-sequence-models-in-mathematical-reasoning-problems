    "message_2": "To find the center and radius of the sphere that best approximates the surface near the point (2, -1, 1), we first need to rewrite the given equation in the standard form of an ellipsoid equation:\n\n4x^2 + y^2 + 9z^2 - 24x - 6y + 27 = 0\n\nWe can complete the square for each variable to rewrite the equation in the standard form:\n\n(4x^2 - 24x) + (y^2 - 6y) + (9z^2) + 27 = 0\n\nFor x, we take half of the coefficient of x (-24) and square it: (-12)^2 = 144. We add and subtract 144 inside the parenthesis:\n\n(4x^2 - 24x + 144) - 144 + (y^2 - 6y) + (9z^2) + 27 = 0\n\nFor y, we take half of the coefficient of y (-6) and square it: (-3)^2 = 9. We add and subtract 9 inside the parenthesis:\n\n(4x^2 - 24x + 144) - 144 + (y^2 - 6y + 9) - 9 + (9z^2) + 27 = 0\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n4(x - 3)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + 9z^2 = 144 - 27 + 9 = 126\n\nDivide by 126 to get the standard form of an ellipsoid equation:\n\n(x - 3)^2 / (126/4) + (y + 3)^2 / (126/1) + z^2 / (126/9) = 1\n\nNow, we have the standard form of an ellipsoid equation:\n\n(x - 3)^2 / 31.5 + (y + 3)^2 / 126 + z^2 / 14 = 1\n\nThe center of the ellipsoid is (3, -3, 0). Since we want to find the sphere that best approximates the surface near the point (2, -1, 1), we can calculate the average of the semi-axes of the ellipsoid:\n\nAverage radius = (sqrt(31.5) + sqrt(126) + sqrt(14)) / 3 â‰ˆ 4.27\n\nNow, we have the center and radius of the sphere that best approximates the surface near the point (2, -1, 1):\n\nCenter: (3, -3, 0)\nRadius: 4.27"
