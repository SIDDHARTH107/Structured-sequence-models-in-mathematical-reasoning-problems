    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 120. We first determine the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups that G can have.\n\nThe order of G is 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, denoted by n_2, must divide 3 * 5 = 15 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 15. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, denoted by n_3, must divide 2^3 * 5 = 40 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be either 1, 4, or 10.\n\nNow, we consider the possible structures of G based on the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, both of which are normal in G. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C120.\n\n2. If n_2 = 15 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup, say N. Since the index of N in G is 40, by the action of G on the cosets of N, we have a homomorphism from G to S40. However, the order of G is 120, which is not divisible by the order of S40. Thus, the image of G under this homomorphism must be a subgroup of A5, the alternating group of degree 5. In this case, G is isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2.\n\n3. If n_2 = 15 and n_3 = 4 or 10, then G has 15 Sylow 2-subgroups and either 4 or 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, G is one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nTherefore, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C120, the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2, or one of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120."
