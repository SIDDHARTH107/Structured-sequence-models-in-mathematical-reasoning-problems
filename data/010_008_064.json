    "message_2": "A simplicial complex X is a collection of simplices (vertices, edges, and higher-dimensional faces) that satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. Every face of a simplex in X is also in X.\n2. The intersection of any two simplices in X is a face of both.\n\nIn this problem, we have a simplicial complex X with 8 vertices and 20 edges. We want to find the maximum possible number of faces of X.\n\nFirst, let's consider the maximum number of 2-dimensional faces (triangles) that can be formed using the 8 vertices. This can be achieved by forming a complete graph on 8 vertices, which is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. In a complete graph, the number of triangles can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = C(n, 3) = n! / (3!(n-3)!)\n\nwhere n is the number of vertices and C(n, 3) is the number of combinations of n vertices taken 3 at a time. In our case, n = 8.\n\nNumber of triangles = C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 56\n\nSo, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the 8 vertices is 56.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of 1-dimensional faces (edges) in X. We are given that there are 20 edges in X. Since every triangle has 3 edges, and we want to maximize the number of triangles, we should try to distribute these 20 edges among the triangles as evenly as possible.\n\nLet's assume that X has t triangles. Then, the total number of edges in X can be calculated as:\n\n3t - (t-1) = 20\n\nwhere (t-1) accounts for the fact that each additional triangle shares an edge with a previous triangle.\n\nSolving for t, we get:\n\n2t = 21\nt = 10.5\n\nSince the number of triangles must be an integer, we can have at most t = 10 triangles in X.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of faces in X:\n\n- 0-dimensional faces (vertices): 8\n- 1-dimensional faces (edges): 20\n- 2-dimensional faces (triangles): 10\n\nThe maximum possible number of faces of X is 8 + 20 + 10 = 38."
