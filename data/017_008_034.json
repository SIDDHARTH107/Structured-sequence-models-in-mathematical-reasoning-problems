For a prime p, if p^k divides the order of a group G, then G has a subgroup of order p^k.\n2. All subgroups of order p^k are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of subgroups of order p^k in G divides the order of G, and is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of G:\n\n1. G has an element of order 8: In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 8, and is isomorphic to C8.\n\n2. G does not have an element of order 8, but has an element of order 4: Let x be an element of order 4 in G. Then, the subgroup H generated by x has order 4. By the Sylow theorems, the number of subgroups of order 4 in G divides the order of G (which is 8), and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, there can be either 1 or 4 subgroups of order 4 in G. \n\nIf there is only one subgroup of order 4, then it is a normal subgroup of G. Let y be an element of G not in H. Then, the order of y must be 2 (since it cannot be 1, 4, or 8). The group G can be generated by x and y, and since H is normal in G, we have that G is a semidirect product of H and the subgroup generated by y. In this case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4.\n\nIf there are 4 subgroups of order 4, then G must have an element z of order 2 not in H. Since the order of xz is not 1, 2, or 4, it must be 8, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\n3. G does not have elements of order 8 or 4: In this case, all non-identity elements of G have order 2. Let x, y, and z be three distinct elements of order 2 in G. Then, the subgroup H generated by x and y has order 4, and is a normal subgroup of G (since all its elements have order 2). The group G can be generated by H and z, and since H is normal in G, we have that G is a semidirect product of H and the subgroup generated by z. In this case, G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 8, it must be isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4."
