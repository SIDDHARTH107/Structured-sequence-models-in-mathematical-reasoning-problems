    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using a Caesar Cipher with a key shift of 3, you shift each letter in the message 3 positions forward in the alphabet. If the shift goes beyond 'Z', it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.\n\nHere's the encryption process for each letter in \"HELLO\":\n\nH -> K (shifted 3 positions forward)\nE -> H (shifted 3 positions forward)\nL -> O (shifted 3 positions forward)\nL -> O (shifted 3 positions forward)\nO -> R (shifted 3 positions forward)\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"KHOOR\"."
