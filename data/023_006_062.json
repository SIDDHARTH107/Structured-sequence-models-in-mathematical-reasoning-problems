    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the continuous-time signal x(t) = e^(-2t)u(t), where u(t) is the unit step function, we use the following formula:\n\nX(jω) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nHowever, since u(t) is the unit step function, x(t) is zero for all t < 0. Therefore, we can change the limits of integration to 0 to +∞:\n\nX(jω) = ∫[e^(-2t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken from 0 to +∞.\n\nNow, combine the exponential terms:\n\nX(jω) = ∫[e^(-2t - jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken from 0 to +∞.\n\nLet's integrate with respect to t:\n\nX(jω) = (-1/(2 + jω)) * e^(-2t - jωt) | evaluated from 0 to +∞.\n\nNow, evaluate the limits:\n\nAs t approaches +∞, the exponential term e^(-2t - jωt) approaches 0.\n\nAs t approaches 0, the exponential term e^(-2t - jωt) approaches 1.\n\nSo, X(jω) = (-1/(2 + jω)) * (0 - 1) = 1 / (2 + jω).\n\nThus, the Fourier transform of the continuous-time signal x(t) = e^(-2t)u(t) is X(jω) = 1 / (2 + jω)."
