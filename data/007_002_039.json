    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 987654321 is divided by 9, we can use the divisibility rule for 9. The rule states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n\nSo, let's find the sum of the digits of 987654321:\n\n9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 45\n\nNow, 45 is divisible by 9 (45 = 9 * 5), which means 987654321 is also divisible by 9. Therefore, the remainder when 987654321 is divided by 9 is 0."
