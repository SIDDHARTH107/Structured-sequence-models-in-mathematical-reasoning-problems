    "message_1": "Consider two algebraic curves defined by the equations: \n\nC1: x² + y² - 4 = 0\nC2: x - y - 1 = 0\n\nUsing Bezout's theorem, determine the number of intersection points of these two curves in the complex projective plane.",
    "message_2": "To apply Bezout's theorem, we first need to find the degrees of the two curves. The degree of a curve is the highest total degree of any term in the equation.\n\nFor C1: x² + y² - 4 = 0, the highest total degree is 2 (from the x² and y² terms).\nFor C2: x - y - 1 = 0, the highest total degree is 1 (from the x and y terms).\n\nNow, we can apply Bezout's theorem, which states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves in the complex projective plane is equal to the product of their degrees, counting multiplicities and including complex and points at infinity.\n\nSo, the number of intersection points is the product of the degrees of C1 and C2: 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, there are 2 intersection points of the two curves in the complex projective plane."
