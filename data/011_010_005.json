    "message_2": "Let's use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let dp[i][j] be the number of ways to arrange i books such that the last book has color j (0 for the first color, 1 for the second color). We want to find dp[8][0] + dp[8][1].\n\nBase case:\ndp[1][0] = 1 (1 book with color 0)\ndp[1][1] = 1 (1 book with color 1)\n\nRecurrence relation:\ndp[i][0] = dp[i-1][1] (the last book has color 0, so the previous book must have color 1)\ndp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0] (the last book has color 1, so the previous book must have color 0)\n\nNow, we can compute dp[8][0] and dp[8][1] using the recurrence relation:\n\ndp[2][0] = dp[1][1] = 1\ndp[2][1] = dp[1][0] = 1\n\ndp[3][0] = dp[2][1] = 1\ndp[3][1] = dp[2][0] = 1\n\ndp[4][0] = dp[3][1] = 1\ndp[4][1] = dp[3][0] = 1\n\ndp[5][0] = dp[4][1] = 1\ndp[5][1] = dp[4][0] = 1\n\ndp[6][0] = dp[5][1] = 1\ndp[6][1] = dp[5][0] = 1\n\ndp[7][0] = dp[6][1] = 1\ndp[7][1] = dp[6][0] = 1\n\ndp[8][0] = dp[7][1] = 1\ndp[8][1] = dp[7][0] = 1\n\nThe total number of ways to arrange the 8 books is dp[8][0] + dp[8][1] = 1 + 1 = 2."
