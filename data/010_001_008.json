Determine whether the following statements are true or false:\n\n1. {c} is an open set.\n2. {a,b,c} is a closed set.\n3. {b} is an isolated point.\n4. {a,b} and {a,c} are both clopen sets.\n5. The set of limit points of {a} is {a,b,c}.",
    "message_2": "1. False. {c} is not an open set because it is not an element of the topology T.\n\n2. True. {a,b,c} is a closed set because its complement, the empty set ∅, is an open set (an element of T).\n\n3. True. {b} is an isolated point because there exists an open set {a, b} containing b that does not contain any other points of the set {b}.\n\n4. True. {a,b} is a clopen set because it is both open (an element of T) and closed (its complement {c} is an open set). {a,c} is also a clopen set because it is the union of two open sets {a} and {c} (which is the complement of {b}, an open set).\n\n5. False. The set of limit points of {a} is {b}, not {a,b,c}. A limit point of a set is a point such that every open set containing the point contains at least one other point of the set. In this case, the open set {a, b} contains both a and b, so b is a limit point of {a}. However, neither a nor c are limit points of {a} because there exist open sets {a} and {c} containing a and c, respectively, that do not contain any other points of the set {a}."
