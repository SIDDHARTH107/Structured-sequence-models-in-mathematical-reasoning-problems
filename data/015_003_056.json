    "message_2": "To find the bifurcation points, we first need to find the fixed points of the logistic map equation. Fixed points are the values of $x$ for which $x_{n+1} = x_n$. So, we have:\n\n$x = rx(1-x)$\n\nNow, we can find the fixed points by solving this equation for $x$:\n\n1. $x = 0$, which is a fixed point for all values of $r$.\n2. $x = 1 - \\frac{1}{r}$, which is a fixed point for $r \\in [1, 4]$.\n\nNext, we need to find the stability of these fixed points. To do this, we'll find the derivative of the logistic map equation with respect to $x$:\n\n$\\frac{dx_{n+1}}{dx_n} = r - 2rx_n$\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the derivative at the fixed points:\n\n1. At $x = 0$, we have $\\frac{dx_{n+1}}{dx_n} = r$. The fixed point is stable if $|r| < 1$ and unstable if $|r| > 1$.\n2. At $x = 1 - \\frac{1}{r}$, we have $\\frac{dx_{n+1}}{dx_n} = 2 - r$. The fixed point is stable if $|2 - r| < 1$ and unstable if $|2 - r| > 1$.\n\nNow, we can find the bifurcation points by finding the values of $r$ for which the fixed points change stability:\n\n1. For $x = 0$, the fixed point changes stability at $r = 1$.\n2. For $x = 1 - \\frac{1}{r}$, the fixed point changes stability at $r = 3$.\n\nSo, the bifurcation points are $r = 1$ and $r = 3$.\n\nTo draw the bifurcation diagram, we'll iterate the logistic map equation for various values of $r$ and plot the stable fixed points:\n\n1. For $r \\in [0, 1]$, the only stable fixed point is $x = 0$.\n2. For $r \\in (1, 3]$, the stable fixed points are $x = 0$ and $x = 1 - \\frac{1}{r}$.\n3. For $r \\in (3, 4]$, the system exhibits period-doubling bifurcations, leading to chaotic behavior.\n\nThe bifurcation diagram will show a stable fixed point at $x = 0$ for $r \\in [0, 1]$, a stable fixed point at $x = 1 - \\frac{1}{r}$ for $r \\in (1, 3]$, and a series of period-doubling bifurcations followed by chaotic behavior for $r \\in (3, 4]$."
