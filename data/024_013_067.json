    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the given metric, we first need to write down the metric tensor. The metric tensor is a symmetric matrix that can be obtained from the given metric. In this case, the metric tensor is:\n\n$$\ng = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 7\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe volume form is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by the standard volume form in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, which is $dV = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$. The determinant of the metric tensor is:\n\n$$\n\\det(g) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 7\n\\end{pmatrix} = 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 63\n$$\n\nSo, the volume form is:\n\n$$\ndV = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = \\sqrt{63} \\, dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz\n$$"
