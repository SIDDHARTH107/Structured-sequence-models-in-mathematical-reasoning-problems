    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLOWORLD\" using the Rail fence cipher with a key of 3, we arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, we read the letters in each row from left to right to get the encrypted message:\n\nHOLEWREDLO\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"HOLEWREDLO\"."
