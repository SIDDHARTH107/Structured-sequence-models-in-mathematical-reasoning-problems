    "message_2": "To find the rank of the matrix, we need to perform row operations to get it in its row-echelon form and then count the number of non-zero rows.\n\nLet's perform row operations:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & -3 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 3 & -6 & -9 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n2. Subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & -3 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow the matrix is in row-echelon form. There is only one non-zero row, so the rank of the matrix is 1."
