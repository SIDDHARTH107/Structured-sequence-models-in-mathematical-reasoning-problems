    "message_2": "To solve this system of congruences, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The theorem states that if the moduli are pairwise coprime, then there exists a unique solution modulo the product of the moduli.\n\nIn this case, the moduli are 2, 5, and 7, which are pairwise coprime. Let's denote their product as $M = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 70$. Now, we can find the partial products $M_1 = M/2 = 35$, $M_2 = M/5 = 14$, and $M_3 = M/7 = 10$.\n\nNext, we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products. We are looking for integers $y_i$ such that $M_i \\cdot y_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m_i}$, where $i = 1, 2, 3$.\n\n1. For $M_1 = 35$, we need to find $y_1$ such that $35y_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. Since $35 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, we can choose $y_1 = 1$.\n\n2. For $M_2 = 14$, we need to find $y_2$ such that $14y_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. We can choose $y_2 = 3$ because $14 \\cdot 3 = 42 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n3. For $M_3 = 10$, we need to find $y_3$ such that $10y_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. We can choose $y_3 = 3$ because $10 \\cdot 3 = 30 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nNow, we can find the solution to the system of congruences:\n\n$$\nx \\equiv a_1M_1y_1 + a_2M_2y_2 + a_3M_3y_3 \\pmod{M}\n$$\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$$\nx \\equiv 1 \\cdot 35 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 3 \\pmod{70}\n$$\n\n$$\nx \\equiv 35 + 126 + 60 \\pmod{70}\n$$\n\n$$\nx \\equiv 221 \\pmod{70}\n$$\n\nThe smallest positive integer $x$ that satisfies the congruences is $x \\equiv 221 \\pmod{70} \\Rightarrow x = 51$."
