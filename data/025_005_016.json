The given equation is:\n\n$$y^2 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 8x^2$$\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (y^2 - x^4 + 4x^3 - 8x^2) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (y^2 - x^4 + 4x^3 - 8x^2) = 0$$\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$$-4x^3 + 12x^2 - 16x = 0$$\n$$2y = 0$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n\n$$y = 0$$\n\nNow, let's plug this value of y back into the first equation and solve for x:\n\n$$-4x^3 + 12x^2 - 16x = 0$$\n\nWe can factor out x:\n\n$$x(-4x^2 + 12x - 16) = 0$$\n\nNow, let's factor the quadratic:\n\n$$x(-4x^2 + 12x - 16) = x(4x^2 - 12x + 16) = x(2x - 4)(x - 2) = 0$$\n\nThis gives us three possible values for x:\n\n$$x = 0$$\n$$x = 2$$\n$$x = 4$$\n\nSo, we have three singular points on the algebraic curve:\n\n$$(0, 0)$$\n$$(2, 0)$$\n$$(4, 0)$$"
