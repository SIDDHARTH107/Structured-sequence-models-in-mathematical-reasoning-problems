    "message_2": "First, we will prove that H is a normal subgroup of G. Since the order of G is 9, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which is a subgroup of order 3. Let H be such a subgroup. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G is equal to 1 mod 3 and divides 9, so the possibilities are 1 or 3. \n\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then H is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup, and it is normal in G by the Sylow theorems. \n\nIf there are three Sylow 3-subgroups, let H1, H2, and H3 be these subgroups. Note that the intersection of any two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups must be the identity element, since their orders are prime. Therefore, the union of H1, H2, and H3 contains 3 * 2 = 6 non-identity elements. Since G has 9 elements, there are only 3 elements left in G that are not in any of the Sylow 3-subgroups. These 3 elements together with the identity element form a subgroup of order 4, which is impossible since 4 does not divide 9. Therefore, there cannot be three Sylow 3-subgroups, and H must be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup, making it normal in G.\n\nNow we will show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9. Since H is normal in G, we can form the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is |G|/|H| = 9/3 = 3, so G/H is isomorphic to the cyclic group C3.\n\nLet K be a subgroup of G such that G/H is isomorphic to K. Then, K has order 3, and G is the internal direct product of H and K. The elements of H and K commute if and only if G is abelian. If G is abelian, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which is C3 x C3, and since the order of G is 9, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9.\n\nIf G is non-abelian, then the elements of H and K do not commute. In this case, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 9, which is the semidirect product of H and K. This group has the presentation ⟨a, b | a^3 = b^3 = 1, bab^(-1) = a^2⟩.\n\nIn conclusion, H is a normal subgroup of G, and G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9."
