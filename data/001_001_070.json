    "message_2": "To solve the linear equation 3x - 5 = 7x + 9 for the variable x, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Move all terms with x to one side of the equation and all constants to the other side. To do this, subtract 3x from both sides and subtract 9 from both sides:\n\n3x - 5 - 3x = 7x + 9 - 3x\n-5 = 4x + 9 - 9\n\nStep 2: Simplify the equation:\n\n-5 = 4x\n\nStep 3: Solve for x by dividing both sides by 4:\n\n-5/4 = x\n\nSo, x = -5/4."
