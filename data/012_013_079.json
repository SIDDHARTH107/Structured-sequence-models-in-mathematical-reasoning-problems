    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can use the deletion-contraction method. The graph can be represented as:\n\n```\n     A - B\n     | X |\n     C - D\n```\n\nwhere X represents the edge between nodes B and C.\n\nNow, we will perform the deletion and contraction operations on edge X:\n\n1. Deletion: Remove edge X from the graph. The resulting graph is a cycle graph with 4 nodes (A, B, C, D). The chromatic polynomial for a cycle graph with an even number of nodes is P(k) = (k-1)^n - (-1)^n(k-1), where n is the number of nodes and k is the number of colors. In this case, n = 4, so the chromatic polynomial for the deletion is P(k) = (k-1)^4 - (k-1).\n\n2. Contraction: Contract edge X by merging nodes B and C into a single node (call it E). The resulting graph is a triangle with nodes A, D, and E. The chromatic polynomial for a triangle is P(k) = k(k-1)(k-2), as each node must have a different color. In this case, the chromatic polynomial for the contraction is P(k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial for the original graph by subtracting the contraction polynomial from the deletion polynomial:\n\nP(k) = [(k-1)^4 - (k-1)] - [k(k-1)(k-2)]\n\nExpanding and simplifying the expression, we get:\n\nP(k) = k^4 - 4k^3 + 6k^2 - 4k + 1 - k^3 + 3k^2 - 2k\n\nCombining like terms, we obtain the chromatic polynomial for the given graph:\n\nP(k) = k^4 - 5k^3 + 9k^2 - 6k + 1"
