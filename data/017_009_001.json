    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2), G must be a p-group. According to the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, every finite abelian group is a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime power order. In this case, G can be either a direct sum of two cyclic groups of order 3 (C3 x C3) or a cyclic group of order 9 (C9).\n\nHowever, we can rule out the possibility of G being isomorphic to C3 x C3. The reason is that C3 x C3 is an abelian group, and every non-identity element in C3 x C3 has order 3. In contrast, a non-abelian group of order 9 must have at least one element of order 9, which is not possible in C3 x C3.\n\nTherefore, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C9. There is no non-abelian group of order 9, since all groups of order p^2 (where p is a prime) are abelian."
