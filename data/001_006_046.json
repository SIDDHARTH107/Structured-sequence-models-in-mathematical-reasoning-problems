    "message_2": "To find the x-intercept(s) of a quadratic function, we need to set y to 0 and solve for x. So, we have:\n\n0 = 2x^2 - 8x + 6\n\nNow, we can try to factor the quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first:\n\n0 = 2(x^2 - 4x + 3)\n\nNow, we need to factor the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n0 = 2(x - 3)(x - 1)\n\nNow, we set each factor to 0 and solve for x:\n\nx - 3 = 0 => x = 3\nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the quadratic function are x = 1 and x = 3."
