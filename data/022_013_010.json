    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) in powers of (z+1), we first rewrite f(z) as a function of (z+1). Let w = z+1, then z = w-1. We can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(w-1) = (3(w-1)^2 + 2)/(w)\n\nNow, we expand the numerator:\n\nf(w-1) = (3(w^2 - 2w + 1) + 2)/w\n\nf(w-1) = (3w^2 - 6w + 3 + 2)/w\n\nf(w-1) = (3w^2 - 6w + 5)/w\n\nNow we perform long division to find the Laurent series expansion:\n\n          3w - 6 + 5/w\n        __________________\nw | 3w^2 - 6w + 5\n\n        - 3w^2 + 6w\n        __________________\n                   5\n\nSo, the Laurent series expansion of f(z) in powers of (z+1) is:\n\nf(w-1) = 3w - 6 + 5/w\n\nNow, we substitute back z+1 for w:\n\nf(z) = 3(z+1) - 6 + 5/(z+1)\n\nf(z) = 3z + 3 - 6 + 5/(z+1)\n\nf(z) = 3z - 3 + 5/(z+1)\n\nThe principal part of the Laurent series is the term with the negative power of z, which is 5/(z+1)."
