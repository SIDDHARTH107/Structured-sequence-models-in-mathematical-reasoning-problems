    "message_2": "To find all meromorphic functions $f(z)$ satisfying the given functional equation, let's first rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n$f(z+1) = \\frac{1}{z} - f(z-1)$.\n\nNow, let's apply the shift operator $T$ such that $Tf(z) = f(z+1)$. Applying the shift operator multiple times, we get:\n\n$T^2f(z) = Tf(z+1) = \\frac{1}{z+1} - f(z)$,\n$T^3f(z) = Tf(z+2) = \\frac{1}{z+2} - f(z+1)$,\n$T^4f(z) = Tf(z+3) = \\frac{1}{z+3} - f(z+2)$,\nand so on.\n\nAdding all these equations, we get:\n\n$T^2f(z) + T^3f(z) + T^4f(z) + \\cdots = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{z+n} - \\frac{1}{z+n-1}\\right)$.\n\nNotice that the right-hand side is a telescoping series, which simplifies to:\n\n$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{z+n} - \\frac{1}{z+n-1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{z} - \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{z+n} = \\frac{1}{z}$.\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$T^2f(z) + T^3f(z) + T^4f(z) + \\cdots = \\frac{1}{z}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $g(z) = f(z) - \\frac{1}{z}$. Then, we have:\n\n$T^2g(z) + T^3g(z) + T^4g(z) + \\cdots = 0$.\n\nThis implies that $g(z)$ is a periodic function with period 1. Therefore, $g(z) = g(z+1)$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Since $f(z)$ is meromorphic, so is $g(z)$. Thus, $g(z)$ is a meromorphic function with period 1.\n\nNow, we can write the original function $f(z)$ as:\n\n$f(z) = g(z) + \\frac{1}{z}$.\n\nSince $g(z)$ is a meromorphic function with period 1, it can be expressed as a sum of a constant and the Weierstrass ℘-function with periods 1 and some complex number $\\omega$:\n\n$g(z) = C + \\wp(z; 1, \\omega)$.\n\nTherefore, the general solution for the meromorphic function $f(z)$ is:\n\n$f(z) = C + \\wp(z; 1, \\omega) + \\frac{1}{z}$,\n\nwhere $C$ is a constant and $\\omega$ is a complex number such that the Weierstrass ℘-function has periods 1 and $\\omega$."
