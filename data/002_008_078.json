    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 8 cm and the height (h) is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * (8²) * 12\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 64 * 12\n\nVolume = 3.14159 * 256\n\nVolume ≈ 804.25 cubic centimeters"
