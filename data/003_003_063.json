    "message_2": "To find the exact value of sin(π/3) using the unit circle, we first need to convert π/3 to degrees. Since π radians is equal to 180 degrees, we can find the degree measure of π/3 as follows:\n\n(π/3) * (180/π) = 60 degrees\n\nNow, we can use the unit circle to find the coordinates of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the circle. For a 60-degree angle, the coordinates are (1/2, √3/2).\n\nThe sine function represents the y-coordinate of the point on the unit circle, so sin(π/3) is equal to the y-coordinate of the point:\n\nsin(π/3) = √3/2"
