    "message_2": "First, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors 𝑎 and 𝑏:\n\n|𝑎| = √(2² + 3² + (-1)²) = √(4 + 9 + 1) = √14\n|𝑏| = √(4² + (-2)² + 0²) = √(16 + 4) = √20\n\nNext, let's find the dot product of the vectors 𝑎 and 𝑏:\n\n𝑎 ⋅ 𝑏 = (2 * 4) + (3 * -2) + (-1 * 0) = 8 - 6 = 2\n\nNow, we can find the angle between the vectors using the dot product formula:\n\ncos(θ) = 𝑎 ⋅ 𝑏 / (|𝑎| |𝑏|)\ncos(θ) = 2 / (√14 * √20)\ncos(θ) = 2 / (√280)\nθ = arccos(2 / √280)\n\nNow, let's find the cross product 𝑎 × 𝑏:\n\n𝑎 × 𝑏 = |𝑎| |𝑏| sin(θ) 𝑛\n\nWe need to find the unit vector 𝑛 that is perpendicular to both 𝑎 and 𝑏. We can do this by finding the cross product of 𝑎 and 𝑏 using the determinant method:\n\n𝑎 × 𝑏 = [(3 * 0 - (-1) * (-2)), (-1 * 4 - 2 * 0), (2 * (-2) - 3 * 4)] = [-6, -4, -14]\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the cross product:\n\n|𝑎 × 𝑏| = √((-6)² + (-4)² + (-14)²) = √(36 + 16 + 196) = √248\n\nTo find the unit vector 𝑛, we divide the cross product by its magnitude:\n\n𝑛 = [-6/√248, -4/√248, -14/√248]\n\nFinally, we can find the cross product 𝑎 × 𝑏 using the formula:\n\n𝑎 × 𝑏 = |𝑎| |𝑏| sin(θ) 𝑛\n𝑎 × 𝑏 = (√14)(√20)sin(arccos(2 / √280))[-6/√248, -4/√248, -14/√248]\n\nSince it is difficult to simplify this expression further, we can use the determinant method result as the cross product:\n\n𝑎 × 𝑏 = [-6, -4, -14]"
