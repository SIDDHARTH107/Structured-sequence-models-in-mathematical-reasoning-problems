    "message_2": "A group of order 25 has the order $5^2$. By Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in a group of order 25 must divide 25 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal. Let's denote this normal subgroup as N.\n\nSince N is a normal subgroup of order 5, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 5, i.e., N ≅ C_5. Now, we consider the factor group G/N. Since the order of G is 25 and the order of N is 5, the order of G/N is 25/5 = 5. Thus, G/N is a group of order 5, which means G/N ≅ C_5.\n\nNow, we have two possibilities for the structure of G:\n\n1. G is a direct product of N and G/N, i.e., G ≅ C_5 × C_5. In this case, G is an abelian group.\n2. G is a semidirect product of N and G/N, i.e., G ≅ C_5 ⋊ C_5. In this case, G is a non-abelian group.\n\nHowever, since G/N is abelian, it turns out that the semidirect product is actually a direct product in this case. Therefore, there is only one possible structure for a group of order 25, which is G ≅ C_5 × C_5, an abelian group. This group is isomorphic to the group of order $5^2$."
