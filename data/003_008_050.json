    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides of length 5 cm and 7 cm, and the angle between them is 60 degrees. What is the area of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * a * b * sin(c)\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the two sides, and c is the angle between them.\n\nIn this case, a = 5 cm, b = 7 cm, and c = 60 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nc (in radians) = (60 * π) / 180 = π / 3\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 5 * 7 * sin(π / 3)\n\nThe sine of π / 3 (60 degrees) is √3 / 2:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 5 * 7 * (√3 / 2)\n\nArea = (35 / 4) * √3\n\nThe area of the triangle is approximately 15.16 square centimeters."
