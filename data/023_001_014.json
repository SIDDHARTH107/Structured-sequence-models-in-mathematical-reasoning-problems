    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x) = x for -π < x < π, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a₀ + Σ[aₙ * cos(nx) + bₙ * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nThe Fourier coefficients are given by the following formulas:\n\na₀ = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * 1]dx, integrated from -L to L\naₙ = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx)]dx, integrated from -L to L\nbₙ = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx)]dx, integrated from -L to L\n\nFor the given function, the period is 2π, so L = π.\n\nLet's compute the coefficients:\n\n1. a₀:\n\na₀ = (1/π) * ∫[x]dx, integrated from -π to π\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [x²/2] | from -π to π\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [(π²/2) - (-π²/2)]\n\na₀ = (1/π) * (π²)\n\na₀ = 0\n\n2. aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * ∫[x * cos(nx)]dx, integrated from -π to π\n\nTo compute this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = cos(nx)dx\ndu = dx, v = (1/n)sin(nx)\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(x * (1/n)sin(nx)) | from -π to π - ∫[(1/n)sin(nx)]dx, integrated from -π to π]\n\nThe first term (x * (1/n)sin(nx)) evaluates to 0 at both -π and π.\n\nNow, let's compute the second term:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [-∫[(1/n)sin(nx)]dx, integrated from -π to π]\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(-1/n²)cos(nx)] | from -π to π\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(-1/n²)(cos(nπ) - cos(-nπ))]\n\nSince cos(-nπ) = cos(nπ), the expression simplifies to:\n\naₙ = 0\n\n3. bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * ∫[x * sin(nx)]dx, integrated from -π to π\n\nUsing integration by parts again:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(nx)dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1/n)cos(nx)\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(-x * (1/n)cos(nx)) | from -π to π + ∫[(1/n)cos(nx)]dx, integrated from -π to π]\n\nThe first term (-x * (1/n)cos(nx)) evaluates to:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(-π * (1/n)cos(nπ) + π * (1/n)cos(-nπ))]\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(-1/n)(πcos(nπ) - πcos(-nπ))]\n\nNow, let's compute the second term:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(-1/n)(πcos(nπ) - πcos(-nπ)) + (1/n) * ∫[cos(nx)]dx, integrated from -π to π]\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(-1/n)(πcos(nπ) - πcos(-nπ)) + (1/n) * [sin(nx)/n] | from -π to π]\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(-1/n)(πcos(nπ) - πcos(-nπ)) + (1/n²)(sin(nπ) - sin(-nπ))]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = sin(-nπ) = 0, the expression simplifies to:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(-1/n)(πcos(nπ) - πcos(-nπ))]\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(-1/n)(2π(-1)^n)]\n\nbₙ = (-1/n)(2(-1)^n)\n\nNow, we have all the coefficients:\n\na₀ = 0\naₙ = 0\nbₙ = (-1/n)(2(-1)^n)\n\nSo, the Fourier series for the given function is:\n\nf(x) = Σ[(-1/n)(2(-1)^n) * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity."
