    "message_2": "To find the smallest 3-digit number that is divisible by both 6 and 7, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 7. \n\nThe prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factor of 7 is 7. The LCM of 6 and 7 is the product of the highest powers of all the prime factors present in both numbers, which is 2 × 3 × 7 = 42.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest 3-digit number that is a multiple of 42. To do this, divide 100 (the smallest 3-digit number) by 42:\n\n100 ÷ 42 = 2 with a remainder of 16.\n\nTo find the next multiple of 42, add the difference between 42 and the remainder:\n\n100 + (42 - 16) = 100 + 26 = 126.\n\nSo, the smallest 3-digit number that is divisible by both 6 and 7 is 126."
