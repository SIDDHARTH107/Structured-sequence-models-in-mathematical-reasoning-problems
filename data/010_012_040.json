    "message_2": "To show that f is a smooth function, we need to prove that all its derivatives exist and are continuous on the interval A.\n\nFirst, let's find the first few derivatives of f(x) = x²:\n\nf'(x) = 2x\nf''(x) = 2\nf'''(x) = 0\nf^(4)(x) = 0\n...\n\nAs we can see, after the second derivative, all higher-order derivatives are equal to 0.\n\nNow, let's analyze the continuity of these derivatives:\n\n1. f(x) = x² is a polynomial function, and polynomial functions are continuous everywhere, including on the interval A.\n\n2. f'(x) = 2x is also a polynomial function, and thus continuous everywhere, including on the interval A.\n\n3. f''(x) = 2 is a constant function, and constant functions are continuous everywhere, including on the interval A.\n\n4. All higher-order derivatives are equal to 0, which is a constant function, and thus continuous everywhere, including on the interval A.\n\nSince all the derivatives of f(x) = x² exist and are continuous on the interval A, we can conclude that f is a smooth function on A."
