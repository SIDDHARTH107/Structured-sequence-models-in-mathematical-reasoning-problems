    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 125, which is a prime power (5^3), we can apply the Sylow theorems to analyze the structure of G. Let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G.\n\nBy the third Sylow theorem, n_5 (the number of Sylow 5-subgroups) must divide the order of G, which is 125, and n_5 must be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. However, if n_5 = 25, then there would be 25 distinct Sylow 5-subgroups, each of order 5, and their intersection would be trivial. This would mean that there are at least 25 * 4 = 100 distinct non-identity elements in G, which is a contradiction since G has only 125 elements. Therefore, n_5 = 1, and G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, of order 5^2 = 25.\n\nSince H is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup, it is normal in G. Now, consider the quotient group G/H. This group has order 125/25 = 5, which is prime, so G/H is cyclic. Let K be a subgroup of G such that K/H is a generator of G/H. Then, K is a subgroup of G of order 5.\n\nNow, we have two subgroups H and K of G, with orders 25 and 5, respectively. Since the orders of H and K are relatively prime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element. Thus, the product of their orders, |H||K| = 25 * 5 = 125, is equal to the order of G.\n\nBy the product formula for the order of the product of two subgroups, |HK| = |H||K| / |H ∩ K|. Since |H ∩ K| = 1, we have |HK| = |H||K| = 125. Therefore, HK = G, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which are cyclic groups of orders 25 and 5, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
