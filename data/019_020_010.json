    "message_2": "To determine the time complexity, we can compare the time it takes to sort the two different input sizes and find the relationship between them.\n\nLet T(n) be the time it takes to sort an array of size n. We are given:\n\nT(1000) = 10 seconds\nT(10000) = 100 seconds\n\nNow, let's assume the time complexity is of the form T(n) = k * n^p, where k is a constant and p is the exponent representing the time complexity.\n\nWe can set up two equations:\n\n10 = k * 1000^p\n100 = k * 10000^p\n\nDivide the second equation by the first equation:\n\n10 = (10000^p) / (1000^p)\n\nSimplify:\n\n10 = 10^p\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides (base 10):\n\nlog10(10) = log10(10^p)\n\n1 = p\n\nSo, the time complexity is T(n) = k * n^1, or simply T(n) = k * n, which is a linear time complexity, O(n)."
