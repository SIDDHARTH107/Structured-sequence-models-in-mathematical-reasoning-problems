    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x), we first need to find the first derivative f'(x) using the power rule of derivatives. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n*x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(x^3) - d/dx(6x^2) + d/dx(9x)\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative f''(x) by applying the power rule again to f'(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx(3x^2) - d/dx(12x) + d/dx(9)\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) is f''(x) = 6x - 12."
