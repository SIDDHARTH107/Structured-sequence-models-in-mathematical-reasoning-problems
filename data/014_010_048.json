If your key swaps the letter \"a\" for the letter \"h\", and the letter \"r\" for the letter \"w\", what would be the encrypted form of the word \"mathematics\"?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the word \"mathematics\" using the given key, we need to know the substitution for each letter in the word. However, we are only provided with the substitutions for the letters \"a\" and \"r\". Without the complete key, we cannot fully encrypt the word \"mathematics\". \n\nWith the given information, we can only partially encrypt the word as follows:\n\nm_hthem_htics (where \"_\" represents the unknown substitution for the respective letters)."
