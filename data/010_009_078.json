    "message_2": "Let's use Euler's formula for planar graphs, which states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (in this case, triangles).\n\nWe are given that there are 10 vertices (V = 10), and each vertex has degree 3. The sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges, since each edge is counted twice (once for each vertex it connects). Therefore:\n\n3 * V = 2 * E\n\nSubstituting the given value of V:\n\n3 * 10 = 2 * E\n30 = 2 * E\nE = 15\n\nNow we have the number of edges (E = 15). We can use Euler's formula to find the number of faces (triangles):\n\nV - E + F = 2\n10 - 15 + F = 2\nF = 7\n\nSo, this triangulation has 15 edges and 7 triangles."
