    "message_2": "To calculate the Euler characteristic of M, we will use the formula:\n\nχ(M) = χ₀ - χ₁ + χ₂ - χ₃\n\nwhere χ₀, χ₁, χ₂, and χ₃ are the Betti numbers of M for dimensions 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\nSince M is a connected 3-manifold, we have χ₀ = 1 (there is only one connected component). We are given that the first Betti number χ₁ and the second Betti number χ₂ are both equal to 1.\n\nThe third Betti number, χ₃, is not given. However, since M is a compact 3-manifold, we know that χ₃ is a non-negative integer. In this case, we can't determine the exact value of χ₃ without more information about M.\n\nHowever, we can still express the Euler characteristic in terms of χ₃:\n\nχ(M) = 1 - 1 + 1 - χ₃ = 1 - χ₃\n\nWithout more information about M, we can't determine the exact value of the Euler characteristic. It will be 1 - χ₃, where χ₃ is the third Betti number of M."
