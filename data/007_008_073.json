    "message_2": "To prove that a^p - a is divisible by p, we can use mathematical induction.\n\nBase case: Let a = 1. Then, a^p - a = 1^p - 1 = 0, which is divisible by p.\n\nInductive step: Assume that a^p - a is divisible by p for some positive integer a. We want to show that (a+1)^p - (a+1) is also divisible by p.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, we can expand (a+1)^p as:\n\n(a+1)^p = a^p + C(p,1)a^(p-1) + C(p,2)a^(p-2) + ... + C(p,p-1)a + 1\n\nwhere C(p,k) denotes the binomial coefficient \"p choose k\".\n\nNow, subtract (a+1) from the expanded form:\n\n(a+1)^p - (a+1) = a^p - a + C(p,1)a^(p-1) + C(p,2)a^(p-2) + ... + C(p,p-1)a\n\nNotice that each term C(p,k)a^(p-k) is divisible by p for k = 1, 2, ..., p-1, because p is prime and C(p,k) has a factor of p in its numerator.\n\nThus, the entire expression is divisible by p, completing the inductive step.\n\nBy mathematical induction, a^p - a is divisible by p for any positive integer a.\n\nNow, let's use Fermat's Little Theorem to solve the second problem. Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) â‰¡ 1 (mod p).\n\nSo, when a^p-1 is divided by p, the remainder is 1."
