    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of these groups, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 60, which can be factored as 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 15 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, or 15. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 20 and be congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1, 4, or 10. Finally, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 12 and be congruent to 1 mod 5, so n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities for G:\n\n1. If G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C60, then G has a unique Sylow p-subgroup for each prime p dividing the order of G. In this case, n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1. If this is the case, then G is isomorphic to C60.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2, then G has 6 Sylow 5-subgroups (since A5 has 6 Sylow 5-subgroups), 4 Sylow 3-subgroups (since A5 has 4 Sylow 3-subgroups), and 3 Sylow 2-subgroups (since C2 has 1 Sylow 2-subgroup and A5 has 5 Sylow 2-subgroups). If this is the case, then G is isomorphic to A5 × C2.\n\n3. If G is isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, then G has n_2 = 3 or 15, n_3 = 4 or 10, and n_5 = 6. We can check that there are indeed 32 such groups with these Sylow subgroup counts.\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these possibilities holds for G. To do this, we can examine the structure of G's Sylow subgroups.\n\nIf G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, then G is isomorphic to C60, as discussed above. If G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup or a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, then G is also isomorphic to C60, since a group with a unique Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p is necessarily cyclic.\n\nIf G has 6 Sylow 5-subgroups, 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, then G is isomorphic to A5 × C2, as discussed above.\n\nFinally, if G has n_2 = 3 or 15, n_3 = 4 or 10, and n_5 = 6, then G is isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nIn conclusion, by examining the structure of G's Sylow subgroups, we can determine whether G is isomorphic to C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. If G does not have the Sylow subgroup structure of any of these groups, then G cannot be isomorphic to them."
