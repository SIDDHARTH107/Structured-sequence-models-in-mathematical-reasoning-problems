    "message_1": "What is the scaling factor used in the Barnsley fern fractal, if the first stem segment starts at (0,0) and grows to a length of 1, and each subsequent segment is scaled down by a factor of 0.33 and rotated 70 degrees counterclockwise from the previous segment?",
    "message_2": "The scaling factor used in the Barnsley fern fractal for each subsequent segment is 0.33. This means that each new segment is 33% the size of the previous segment. The rotation of 70 degrees counterclockwise is applied to each segment as well, but the question specifically asks for the scaling factor, which is 0.33."
