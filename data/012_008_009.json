    "message_2": "According to Kuratowski's theorem, a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 3+3 vertices). Euler's formula for planar graphs states that for any connected planar graph with V vertices, E edges, and F faces, the following relationship holds:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nTo find the maximum number of edges in a planar graph with 10 vertices, we can use the inequality derived from Euler's formula:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices.\n\nIn this case, V = 10, so:\n\nE ≤ 3(10) - 6\nE ≤ 30 - 6\nE ≤ 24\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of edges in a planar graph with 10 vertices is 24."
