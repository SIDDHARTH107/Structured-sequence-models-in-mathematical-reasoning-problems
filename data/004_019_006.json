    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car, we need to find the first derivative of the position function with respect to time, which represents the velocity function:\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(2t^3 - 3t^2 + 4t + 1)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n$v(t) = 6t^2 - 6t + 4$\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at $t = 2$ seconds by plugging in the value of $t$ into the velocity function:\n\n$v(2) = 6(2)^2 - 6(2) + 4 = 6(4) - 12 + 4 = 24 - 12 + 4 = 16$\n\nSo, the velocity of the car at $t = 2$ seconds is 16 meters per second.\n\nNext, to find the acceleration of the car, we need to find the second derivative of the position function with respect to time, which represents the acceleration function:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(2t^3 - 3t^2 + 4t + 1)$\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the velocity function:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(6t^2 - 6t + 4)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\n$a(t) = 12t - 6$\n\nNow, we can find the acceleration at $t = 2$ seconds by plugging in the value of $t$ into the acceleration function:\n\n$a(2) = 12(2) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18$\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car at $t = 2$ seconds is 18 meters per second squared.\n\nIn conclusion, the velocity of the car at $t = 2$ seconds is 16 meters per second, and the acceleration is 18 meters per second squared."
