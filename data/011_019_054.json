    "message_1": "Suppose you are designing a survey to test the preferences of customers for four different flavors of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and mint. To create a balanced design, you decide to use an orthogonal array of the size OA(16,4,2,2). How many rows will your survey consist of?",
    "message_2": "An orthogonal array OA(n, k, s, t) has the following parameters:\n\n- n: the number of rows (runs)\n- k: the number of columns (factors)\n- s: the number of levels for each factor\n- t: the strength of the array\n\nIn this case, you have an orthogonal array of size OA(16, 4, 2, 2). The number of rows in the array is represented by the first parameter, n. Therefore, your survey will consist of 16 rows."
