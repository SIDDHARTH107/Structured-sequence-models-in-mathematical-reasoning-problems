    "message_2": "To calculate the Alexander polynomial of a trefoil knot, we first need to set up a matrix based on the knot diagram. We will use the following convention:\n\n1. Label the arcs in the knot diagram with integers from 1 to n, where n is the number of crossings.\n2. For each crossing, create a row in the matrix with n columns.\n3. In each row, put a -t in the column corresponding to the overcrossing arc, a 1 in the column corresponding to the undercrossing arc entering the crossing, and a (t-1) in the column corresponding to the undercrossing arc leaving the crossing. All other entries in the row should be 0.\n\nFor a trefoil knot, we have three crossings, so we will have a 3x3 matrix. Let's label the arcs as follows:\n\n1. Arc from crossing 1 to crossing 2 (overcrossing at crossing 1)\n2. Arc from crossing 2 to crossing 3 (overcrossing at crossing 2)\n3. Arc from crossing 3 to crossing 1 (overcrossing at crossing 3)\n\nNow, we can set up the matrix:\n\n```\n| -t    1  t-1 |\n|  1  -t   t-1 |\n| t-1   1  -t  |\n```\n\nTo find the Alexander polynomial, we need to compute the determinant of this matrix. Using the cofactor expansion method, we have:\n\nΔ(t) = det(-t, 1, t-1) = -t * det(-t, t-1) - 1 * det(1, t-1) + (t-1) * det(1, -t)\n\nNow, we compute the 2x2 determinants:\n\ndet(-t, t-1) = -t * (-t) - (t-1) * 1 = t^2 - (t-1)\ndet(1, t-1) = 1 * 1 - (-t) * (t-1) = 1 - t^2 + t\ndet(1, -t) = 1 * (-t) - 1 * 1 = -t - 1\n\nNow, substitute these back into the expression for Δ(t):\n\nΔ(t) = -t * (t^2 - (t-1)) - 1 * (1 - t^2 + t) + (t-1) * (-t - 1)\n     = -t^3 + t^2 + t - 1 - t^2 + t - 1 + t^2 - t^3 - t + 1\n     = -2t^3\n\nThe Alexander polynomial of the trefoil knot is Δ(t) = -2t^3. However, since the Alexander polynomial is only defined up to multiplication by a power of t, we can simplify this to:\n\nΔ(t) = t^3"
