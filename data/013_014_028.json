    "message_1": "In a sealed bid auction, three bidders submit their bids in sealed envelopes. The auctioneer opens the envelopes and awards the object to the highest bidder. If two or more bids tie as the highest, the object is awarded to one of the tying bidders at random. Suppose the bidders have the following valuations for the object:\n\nBidder 1: $100\nBidder 2: $80\nBidder 3: $120\n\nWhat is the expected revenue for the auctioneer from this sealed bid auction?",
    "message_2": "To determine the expected revenue for the auctioneer, we need to consider the possible bidding strategies of the bidders. Since we don't have information about their bidding strategies, we will assume that each bidder bids their true valuation for the object.\n\nIn this case, the bids would be:\n\nBidder 1: $100\nBidder 2: $80\nBidder 3: $120\n\nSince Bidder 3 has the highest valuation, they would win the auction with a bid of $120. There are no ties in this scenario, so the expected revenue for the auctioneer would be the winning bid, which is $120."
