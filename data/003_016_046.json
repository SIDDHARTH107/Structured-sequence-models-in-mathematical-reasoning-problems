    "message_2": "The general form of a sinusoidal function is f(x) = A*sin(Bx + C), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift. In this case, the given function is f(x) = 3sin(4x + π/3).\n\nTo find the phase shift, we need to look at the value of C. In this case, C = π/3. The phase shift is the horizontal shift of the function, and it can be found by dividing C by the frequency B:\n\nPhase shift = C/B = (π/3) / 4 = π/12\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function is π/12."
