What dimensions of the field will give the maximum area, and what is the maximum area? \n\nThe student must use calculus concepts to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the area of the rectangular field, we can use calculus concepts. Let the length of the field be x meters and the width be y meters. Since the perimeter is fixed at 300 meters, we can write the equation for the perimeter as:\n\n2x + 2y = 300\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = (300 - 2x) / 2\ny = 150 - x\n\nThe area of the rectangle is given by:\n\nA(x) = x * y\nA(x) = x * (150 - x)\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum area. To do this, we will find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the area function with respect to x and setting it to zero:\n\nA'(x) = d(A(x))/dx = d(x * (150 - x))/dx\n\nUsing the product rule:\n\nA'(x) = (1)*(150 - x) + (x)*(-1)\nA'(x) = 150 - x - x\nA'(x) = 150 - 2x\n\nNow, set A'(x) to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 150 - 2x\n2x = 150\nx = 75\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny = 150 - x\ny = 150 - 75\ny = 75\n\nSo, the dimensions that give the maximum area are 75 meters by 75 meters. Now, we can find the maximum area:\n\nA(x) = x * y\nA(75) = 75 * 75\nA(75) = 5625\n\nThe maximum area of the rectangular field is 5625 square meters."
