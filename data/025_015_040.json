    "message_2": "To find the equation of a cubic surface, we can use the following general form:\n\nF(x, y, z) = ax^3 + by^3 + cz^3 + dx^2y + ex^2z + fxy^2 + gyz^2 + hxz^2 + ixyz + jx^2 + ky^2 + lz^2 + mx + ny + pz + q = 0\n\nWe have 3 points and 2 tangent planes, which give us 5 equations to solve for the coefficients a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, p, and q.\n\n1. F(3,1,0) = 0\n2. F(1,0,-2) = 0\n3. F(2,2,2) = 0\n4. ∇F(2,2,2) · (1, -1, 1) = 0 (tangent plane at (2,2,2))\n5. ∇F(1,0,-2) · (0, 1, -2) = 0 (tangent plane at (1,0,-2))\n\nHere, ∇F(x, y, z) is the gradient of F, which is the vector of partial derivatives (∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y, ∂F/∂z).\n\nSolving these 5 equations simultaneously is a complex task and may not have a unique solution. However, we can simplify the problem by assuming that the cubic surface has a specific form, such as a polynomial in x, y, and z. For example, we can assume the following form:\n\nF(x, y, z) = ax^3 + by^3 + cz^3 + jx^2 + ky^2 + lz^2 + mx + ny + pz + q = 0\n\nNow, we have 6 unknowns (a, b, c, j, k, l, m, n, p, and q) and 5 equations. We can solve this system of equations using various methods, such as substitution or matrix inversion. However, this still may not have a unique solution, and the actual cubic surface may have a more complex form.\n\nIn summary, finding the equation of a cubic surface given the provided data is a challenging task that may not have a unique solution. Further simplifications or assumptions may be necessary to obtain a specific equation."
