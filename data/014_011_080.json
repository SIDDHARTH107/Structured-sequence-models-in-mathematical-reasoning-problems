    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using the transposition cipher with a key of 3, we need to reverse the encryption process. We will arrange the ciphertext into columns based on the key and then read the message row by row.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of rows needed. The length of the ciphertext is 20 characters, so we will have 20 / 3 = 6.67. Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we round up to 7 rows.\n\nNow, let's arrange the ciphertext into columns:\n\nE M T\nT E H\nR A E\nR T E\nE F T\nE Y A\nP R\n\nNow, read the message row by row:\n\n\"MEET ME AFTER THE PARTY\"\n\nSo, the plaintext message that was encrypted using the given key and transposition cipher method is \"MEET ME AFTER THE PARTY\"."
