    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given system of linear equations:\n\n(1) x + 2y + 3z = 4 + 3i\n(2) 3x - y + 4z = 1 - 4i\n(3) 2x + 4y + 2z = 2 + 2i\n\nNow, let's eliminate x from equations (2) and (3). To do this, we will multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (3) by -1:\n\n(1') 3x + 6y + 9z = 12 + 9i\n(3') -2x - 4y - 2z = -2 - 2i\n\nNow, add equations (1') and (3'):\n\n(4) x + 5z = 10 + 7i\n\nNext, let's eliminate y from equations (2) and (3). To do this, we will multiply equation (1) by -2 and add it to equation (3):\n\n(1'') -2x - 4y - 6z = -8 - 6i\n(5) -z = -6 - 4i\n\nNow, we can solve equation (5) for z:\n\nz = 6 + 4i\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into equation (4) to find the value of x:\n\nx + 5(6 + 4i) = 10 + 7i\nx + 30 + 20i = 10 + 7i\nx = -20 + 13i\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of x and z back into equation (1) to find the value of y:\n\n(-20 + 13i) + 2y + 3(6 + 4i) = 4 + 3i\n-20 + 13i + 2y + 18 + 12i = 4 + 3i\n2y = 6 - 10i\ny = 3 - 5i\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -20 + 13i\ny = 3 - 5i\nz = 6 + 4i"
