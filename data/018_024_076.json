    "message_1": "Let A, B, and C be sets such that A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, and C = {1, 2, 5, 6}. \n\nFind the symmetric difference of A and B, then find the complement of that result. Next, find the symmetric difference of A and C, then find the complement of that result. Finally, compare the two complements and show that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in both. \n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} Δ {3, 4, 5, 6} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B. The complement of a set is the set of elements not in the given set. We'll assume the universal set U contains all the elements in A, B, and C. \n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n(A Δ B)' = {1, 2, 5, 6}' = {3, 4}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of A and C.\n\nA Δ C = {1, 2, 3, 4} Δ {1, 2, 5, 6} = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference of A and C.\n\n(A Δ C)' = {3, 4, 5, 6}' = {1, 2}\n\nNow, let's compare the two complements:\n\n(A Δ B)' = {3, 4}\n(A Δ C)' = {1, 2}\n\nThese two complements are not equal. This shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement. In other words, (A Δ B)' ≠ (A Δ C)'."
