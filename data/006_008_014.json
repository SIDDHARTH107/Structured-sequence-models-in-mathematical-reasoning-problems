    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (x!(n-x)!)) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (in this case, heavy rain) in n trials (days)\n- n is the number of trials (days in a week)\n- x is the number of successes (heavy rain days)\n- p is the probability of success (heavy rain) on a single trial (day)\n- q is the probability of failure (no heavy rain) on a single trial (day)\n\nIn this case, n = 7 (days in a week), x = 2 (we want exactly 2 days of heavy rain), p = 1/4 (heavy rain occurs one day out of every four), and q = 1 - p = 3/4 (no heavy rain occurs three days out of every four).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(2) = (7! / (2!(7-2)!)) * (1/4)^2 * (3/4)^(7-2)\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the binomial coefficient (7! / (2!(7-2)!)):\n\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040\n2! = 2 * 1 = 2\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n\nBinomial coefficient = 5040 / (2 * 120) = 5040 / 240 = 21\n\nNow, we'll calculate the rest of the formula:\n\n(1/4)^2 = 1/16\n(3/4)^5 = 243/1024\n\nP(2) = 21 * (1/16) * (243/1024) = 21 * (243/16384) = 5103/16384 â‰ˆ 0.3115\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain exactly twice in a 7-day week is approximately 0.3115 or 31.15%."
