    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nFirst, let's find A x B:\n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find B x A:\n\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, A x B and B x A are not equal because the ordered pairs in each set are different. In A x B, the first element of each ordered pair comes from set A, while in B x A, the first element of each ordered pair comes from set B."
