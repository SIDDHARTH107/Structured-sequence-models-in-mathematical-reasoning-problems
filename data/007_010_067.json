    "message_1": "A math student needs to find the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, a remainder of 2 when divided by 7, and a remainder of 5 when divided by 11 using the Chinese remainder theorem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we first set up the system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 3 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n\nNext, we find the product of the moduli: N = 5 * 7 * 11 = 385.\n\nNow, we compute the partial products:\nN1 = N/5 = 385/5 = 77\nN2 = N/7 = 385/7 = 55\nN3 = N/11 = 385/11 = 35\n\nNext, we find the modular inverses:\ny1 = N1^(-1) (mod 5) = 77^(-1) (mod 5) = 3\ny2 = N2^(-1) (mod 7) = 55^(-1) (mod 7) = 1\ny3 = N3^(-1) (mod 11) = 35^(-1) (mod 11) = 9\n\nNow, we can find the solution x:\nx = (3 * 77 * 3) + (2 * 55 * 1) + (5 * 35 * 9)\nx = 693 + 110 + 1575\nx = 2378\n\nFinally, we find the smallest positive integer solution by taking the remainder when divided by N:\nx = 2378 (mod 385)\nx = 123\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is 123."
