    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector of a circle, we need to calculate the arc length and add it to the two radii.\n\nThe formula for the arc length is:\n\nArc length = (central angle / 360) * 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 8 cm and the central angle is 45 degrees.\n\nArc length = (45 / 360) * 2π(8)\nArc length = (1/8) * 16π\nArc length = 2π cm\n\nNow, add the arc length to the two radii:\n\nPerimeter = arc length + 2r\nPerimeter = 2π + 2(8)\nPerimeter = 2π + 16\n\nThe perimeter of the sector is 2π + 16 cm."
