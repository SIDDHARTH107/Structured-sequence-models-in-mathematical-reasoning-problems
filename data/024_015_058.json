    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative of the differential 1-form $df$, we first need to find the gradient of $f$. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla f = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right) = (2x, 2y, 2z)$.\n\nNow, we can write the differential 1-form $df$ as:\n\n$df = 2x\\,dx + 2y\\,dy + 2z\\,dz$.\n\nNext, we compute the exterior derivative $d(df)$. Recall that the exterior derivative of a 1-form is a 2-form, and it can be computed using the following rules:\n\n$d(fg) = f\\,dg + g\\,df$ and $d^2 = 0$.\n\nApplying these rules, we get:\n\n$d(df) = d(2x\\,dx + 2y\\,dy + 2z\\,dz) = 2\\,d(x\\,dx) + 2\\,d(y\\,dy) + 2\\,d(z\\,dz)$.\n\nNow, we compute the exterior derivatives of each term:\n\n$d(x\\,dx) = dx\\wedge dx = 0$,\n\n$d(y\\,dy) = dy\\wedge dy = 0$,\n\n$d(z\\,dz) = dz\\wedge dz = 0$.\n\nThus, the exterior derivative of the differential 1-form $df$ on $M$ is:\n\n$d(df) = 2(0) + 2(0) + 2(0) = 0$.\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of $df$ on the manifold $M$ is the zero 2-form."
