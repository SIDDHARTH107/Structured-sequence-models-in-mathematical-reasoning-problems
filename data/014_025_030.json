    "message_2": "The SHA-1 algorithm generates a hash value of 160 bits. To convert bits to bytes, you need to divide the number of bits by 8, as there are 8 bits in a byte.\n\n160 bits / 8 = 20 bytes\n\nSo, the size of the hash output using the SHA-1 algorithm for a 20-character message will be 20 bytes."
