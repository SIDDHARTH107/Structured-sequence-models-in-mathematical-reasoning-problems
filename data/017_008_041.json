    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4, we will analyze the properties of each group and compare them to the properties of G.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cyclic group C8. A group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. If G is isomorphic to C8, then G must have an element of order 8. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a subgroup of order 2, and since the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group, G must have an element of order 2. If G has an element of order 8, then G is isomorphic to C8.\n\nNow, let's consider the quaternion group Q8. Q8 has the following presentation: Q8 = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}, where i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. If G is isomorphic to Q8, then G must have exactly 6 elements of order 4 and one element of order 2 (besides the identity element). If G has an element of order 4, then G cannot be isomorphic to C8, since C8 has only one element of order 2. If G has 6 elements of order 4 and one element of order 2, then G is isomorphic to Q8.\n\nFinally, let's consider the dihedral group D4. D4 has the following presentation: D4 = {r^n s^m | n = 0, 1, 2, 3; m = 0, 1}, where r is a rotation and s is a reflection, with r^4 = s^2 = 1 and sr = r^(-1)s. If G is isomorphic to D4, then G must have 4 elements of order 2 and one element of order 4 (besides the identity element). If G has 4 elements of order 2 and one element of order 4, then G is isomorphic to D4.\n\nIn summary, to determine whether G is isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4, we need to analyze the orders of the elements in G:\n\n1. If G has an element of order 8, then G is isomorphic to C8.\n2. If G has 6 elements of order 4 and one element of order 2, then G is isomorphic to Q8.\n3. If G has 4 elements of order 2 and one element of order 4, then G is isomorphic to D4.\n\nWithout more information about the group G, we cannot definitively determine which group it is isomorphic to."
