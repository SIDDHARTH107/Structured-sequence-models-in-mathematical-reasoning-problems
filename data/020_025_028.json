    "message_1": "A truck driver needs to deliver a shipment of goods to five different locations in a city. Each location has a different demand for goods and there are different distances between each location. The driver's objective is to find the shortest overall distance and satisfy the demand at each location. \n\nThe following table shows the demand at each location and the distance between them: \n\n| Locations       | Demand | A     | B     | C     | D     |\n|-----------------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Start (S)       | -      | 15 km | 20 km | 10 km | 25 km |\n| Location 1 (L1) | 400 kg | -     | 35 km | 42 km | 27 km |\n| Location 2 (L2) | 200 kg | 35 km | -     | 20 km | 33 km |\n| Location 3 (L3) | 300 kg | 42 km | 20 km | -     | 37 km |\n| Location 4 (L4) | 250 kg | 27 km | 33 km | 37 km | -     |\n\nWhat is the optimal delivery route for the truck driver that minimizes the total distance traveled while satisfying the demand at each location?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal delivery route, we can use the nearest neighbor algorithm. Starting from the initial location (S), we will visit the nearest unvisited location until all locations have been visited, and then return to the starting point.\n\n1. From Start (S), the nearest location is Location 3 (L3) with a distance of 10 km.\n2. From Location 3 (L3), the nearest unvisited location is Location 2 (L2) with a distance of 20 km.\n3. From Location 2 (L2), the nearest unvisited location is Location 1 (L1) with a distance of 35 km.\n4. From Location 1 (L1), the nearest unvisited location is Location 4 (L4) with a distance of 27 km.\n5. Finally, return to Start (S) from Location 4 (L4) with a distance of 25 km.\n\nThe optimal delivery route is: S → L3 → L2 → L1 → L4 → S\n\nThe total distance traveled is: 10 km + 20 km + 35 km + 27 km + 25 km = 117 km."
