    "message_2": "To solve this integral using the Schwarz reflection principle, we first consider the function:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z^2}{(z^2 + 1)^3}$$\n\nNow, let's find the poles of this function. The poles occur when the denominator is equal to zero:\n\n$$z^2 + 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow z^2 = -1 \\Rightarrow z = \\pm i$$\n\nSince the degree of the denominator is 6 and the degree of the numerator is 2, we have a pole of order 4 at both $z = i$ and $z = -i$. Now, we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral. We will integrate along a semicircular contour in the upper half-plane, with a radius R that goes to infinity.\n\nThe integral along the semicircle goes to zero as R goes to infinity, so we are left with the integral along the real axis plus the integral around the pole at $z = i$. The integral around the pole at $z = -i$ is not included because it is not in the upper half-plane.\n\nNow, we need to find the residue of the function at $z = i$. Since the pole is of order 4, we need to find the third derivative of the function with respect to z:\n\n$$f'(z) = \\frac{-6z(z^2+1)^2 - 4z^3(z^2+1)}{(z^2+1)^6}$$\n$$f''(z) = \\frac{6(z^2+1)^2 + 12z^2(z^2+1) - 12z^4}{(z^2+1)^6}$$\n$$f'''(z) = \\frac{-24z(z^2+1) - 48z^3}{(z^2+1)^6}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the third derivative at $z = i$:\n\n$$f'''(i) = \\frac{-24i(0) - 48i^3}{(i^2+1)^6} = \\frac{48i}{(0)^6} = 48i$$\n\nThe residue of the function at $z = i$ is given by:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), z=i) = \\frac{1}{3!} f'''(i) = \\frac{1}{6} (48i) = 8i$$\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{x^2}{(x^2 + 1)^3}dx = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\text{Res}(f(z), z=i) = 2\\pi i (8i) = -16\\pi$$\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{x^2}{(x^2 + 1)^3}dx = -16\\pi$$"
