    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we need to find the coefficients a_n, b_n, and a_0. The general formula for the Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\n\nSince f(x) = 0 for -π ≤ x < 0 and f(x) = 1 for 0 ≤ x < π, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * [∫[-π, 0] 0 dx + ∫[0, π] 1 dx]\n\nThe first integral is 0, and the second integral is x evaluated from 0 to π, so:\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * [0 + π] = 1\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nAgain, we split the integral into two parts:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [∫[-π, 0] 0 * cos(n * x) dx + ∫[0, π] 1 * cos(n * x) dx]\n\nThe first integral is 0, and the second integral is (1 / n) * sin(n * x) evaluated from 0 to π, so:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [0 + (1 / n) * (sin(n * π) - sin(0))] = 0\n\nThe sin(n * π) term is 0 for all integer values of n, so a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nSplitting the integral again:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [∫[-π, 0] 0 * sin(n * x) dx + ∫[0, π] 1 * sin(n * x) dx]\n\nThe first integral is 0, and the second integral is (-1 / n) * cos(n * x) evaluated from 0 to π, so:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [0 + (-1 / n) * (cos(n * π) - cos(0))] = (-1 / n) * (cos(n * π) - 1)\n\nNow we have all the coefficients, so the Fourier series of the given function is:\n\nf(x) = 1 + Σ [0 * cos(n * x) + (-1 / n) * (cos(n * π) - 1) * sin(n * x)]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nf(x) = 1 - Σ [(-1 / n) * (cos(n * π) - 1) * sin(n * x)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given function f(x)."
