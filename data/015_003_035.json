    "message_2": "The logistic map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the equation:\n\nx(n+1) = r * x(n) * (1 - x(n))\n\nwhere x(n) is the population at time n, and r is the growth parameter.\n\nFor a given value of r, the logistic map can have multiple equilibria, which are the fixed points of the system where x(n+1) = x(n). To find the equilibria, we can set x(n+1) = x(n) and solve for x(n):\n\nx = r * x * (1 - x)\n\nx = r * x - r * x^2\n\nx * (r - r * x - 1) = 0\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that there are two possible equilibria:\n\n1. x = 0\n2. r * x - 1 = 0, which gives x = 1 - 1/r\n\nFor r = 3.5, the second equilibrium point is:\n\nx = 1 - 1/3.5 = 1 - 2/7 = 5/7 ≈ 0.7143\n\nSo, for r = 3.5, there are two equilibria in the logistic map: x = 0 and x ≈ 0.7143."
