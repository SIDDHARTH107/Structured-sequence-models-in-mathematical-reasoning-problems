    "message_2": "First, let's recall some definitions and facts:\n\n1. A group G is cyclic if there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be written as a power of g.\n2. The dihedral group D_n is the group of symmetries of a regular n-sided polygon, and has order 2n.\n3. A group is abelian if its operation is commutative, i.e., for all elements a, b in G, ab = ba.\n4. The non-abelian group of order 10 is a group with 10 elements that is not abelian.\n5. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of a group G must divide the order of G.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given group G of order 10. Since 10 = 2 * 5, the prime factors of the order of G are 2 and 5. By Sylow's theorems, there must exist a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 5-subgroup in G. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 5-subgroup. Then, |P| = 2 and |Q| = 5.\n\nSince 5 is prime, Q must be cyclic, and thus isomorphic to C5. Similarly, P must be cyclic and isomorphic to C2. Now, we know that the intersection of P and Q is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. This is because the orders of P and Q are coprime (2 and 5 are prime and distinct).\n\nWe can now use the fact that the product of the orders of P and Q is equal to the order of G: |P||Q| = |G|. Since |P| = 2, |Q| = 5, and |G| = 10, we have:\n\n2 * 5 = 10\n\nNow, we can apply the internal direct product theorem, which states that if a group G has subgroups P and Q such that |P||Q| = |G| and P ∩ Q = {e}, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q. In our case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of C2 and C5.\n\nThe direct product of C2 and C5 is C10, which is the cyclic group of order 10. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C10.\n\nSince G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10, it cannot be isomorphic to the dihedral group D5 or the non-abelian group of order 10, as those groups are not cyclic. Thus, we have proven that G is isomorphic to C10 and not to D5 or the non-abelian group of order 10."
