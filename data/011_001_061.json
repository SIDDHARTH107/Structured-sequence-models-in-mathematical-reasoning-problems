    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to select a committee of 3 students from a class of 20 students, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (20), k is the number of students to be selected (3), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!(20-3)!)\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!17!)\n\nC(20, 3) = (20 × 19 × 18 × 17!)/(3 × 2 × 1 × 17!)\n\nC(20, 3) = (20 × 19 × 18) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(20, 3) = 6840 / 6\n\nC(20, 3) = 1140\n\nSo there are 1140 ways to select a committee of 3 students from a class of 20 students if the order of selection does not matter."
