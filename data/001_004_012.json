    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial 4x^2 - 12x + 6, we can first find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the coefficients, which is 2. We can then factor out the GCF:\n\n2(2x^2 - 6x + 3)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. We are looking for two binomials of the form (ax + b)(cx + d) such that:\n\n1. a * c = 2 (coefficient of x^2 term)\n2. b * d = 3 (constant term)\n3. a * d + b * c = -6 (coefficient of x term)\n\nThe possible factor pairs for 2 are (1, 2) and (2, 1), and the possible factor pairs for 3 are (1, 3) and (3, 1). After trying different combinations, we find that the correct factorization is:\n\n(2x - 3)(x - 1)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial is:\n\n2(2x - 3)(x - 1)"
