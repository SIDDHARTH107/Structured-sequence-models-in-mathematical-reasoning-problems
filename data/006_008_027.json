    "message_1": "Suppose the probability of snowfall in a particular town on a given day in December is 0.4. What is the probability that it will not snow on that day?",
    "message_2": "The probability of an event not occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event occurring. In this case, the probability of snowfall is 0.4. Therefore, the probability of no snowfall on that day is:\n\n1 - 0.4 = 0.6\n\nSo, the probability that it will not snow on that day is 0.6 or 60%."
