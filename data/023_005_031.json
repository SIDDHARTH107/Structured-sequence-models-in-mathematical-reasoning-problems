    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using Fourier Transform, we first need to find the Fourier Transform of the given equation and then solve for Y(s), the Fourier Transform of y(t). Finally, we will find the inverse Fourier Transform of Y(s) to get the solution y(t).\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n\ny''(t) - 4y'(t) + 5y(t) = 0\n\nTaking the Fourier Transform of the equation, we get:\n\n(s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)) - 4(sY(s) - y(0)) + 5Y(s) = 0\n\nNow, we plug in the initial conditions y(0) = 3 and y'(0) = 1:\n\n(s^2Y(s) - s(3) - 1) - 4(sY(s) - 3) + 5Y(s) = 0\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nY(s)[s^2 - 4s + 5] = 3s + 4 - 3s + 12\n\nY(s) = (3s + 4 - 3s + 12) / (s^2 - 4s + 5)\n\nY(s) = (16) / (s^2 - 4s + 5)\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier Transform of Y(s) to get y(t):\n\ny(t) = F^(-1)[Y(s)]\n\ny(t) = F^(-1)[16 / (s^2 - 4s + 5)]\n\nTo find the inverse Fourier Transform, we can use the method of completing the square for the denominator:\n\n(s^2 - 4s + 5) = (s - 2)^2 + 1\n\nNow, Y(s) becomes:\n\nY(s) = 16 / ((s - 2)^2 + 1)\n\nThe inverse Fourier Transform of Y(s) is:\n\ny(t) = 16 * e^(2t) * sin(t)\n\nSo, the solution of the given differential equation with the initial conditions y(0) = 3 and y'(0) = 1 is:\n\ny(t) = 16 * e^(2t) * sin(t)"
