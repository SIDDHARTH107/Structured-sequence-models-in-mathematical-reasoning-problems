    "message_2": "To divide the square into equally sized triangles using a triangle subdivision, we can start by drawing a diagonal from one corner to the opposite corner, say from (0,0) to (2,2). This will create two right triangles, each with an area of half the square's area.\n\nNow, to further subdivide these triangles, we can draw the midpoints of the sides of the square, which are (0,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (1,0). Then, connect these midpoints to create a smaller square inside the original square.\n\nThis will result in the square being divided into 4 congruent right triangles. To further subdivide these triangles, draw a diagonal in each of these triangles, connecting the midpoint of the hypotenuse to the opposite vertex.\n\nNow, the square is divided into 8 equally sized triangles."
