    "message_1": "Suppose you are given a ciphertext that was encrypted using a substitution cipher on a 26-letter alphabet. You are told that the most common letter in the ciphertext corresponds to the letter 'E' in the English language. What letter in the ciphertext corresponds to the letter 'Q'?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the frequency of letters in the English language and determine the shift used in the substitution cipher.\n\nThe most common letter in the English language is 'E,' and we are told that the most common letter in the ciphertext corresponds to 'E.' Let's assume that the most common letter in the ciphertext is 'X.' Now, we need to find the shift between 'E' and 'X.'\n\nThe shift can be calculated as follows:\n\nShift = (position of 'X' in the alphabet) - (position of 'E' in the alphabet)\n\nShift = (24) - (5) = 19\n\nNow that we know the shift, we can find the letter in the ciphertext that corresponds to 'Q.' The position of 'Q' in the alphabet is 17. To find the corresponding letter in the ciphertext, we add the shift and wrap around the alphabet if necessary:\n\nCiphertext position = (position of 'Q' + shift) % 26\nCiphertext position = (17 + 19) % 26 = 36 % 26 = 10\n\nThe 10th letter in the alphabet is 'K.' Therefore, the letter 'Q' in the plaintext corresponds to the letter 'K' in the ciphertext."
