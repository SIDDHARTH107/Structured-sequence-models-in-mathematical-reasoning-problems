Calculate the correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result. The data is as follows: \n\nStudy time: 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 60, 120, 100, 75, 90\nExam score: 70, 80, 85, 90, 95, 80, 95, 90, 75, 85\"",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) between the two variables, we'll first need to compute the mean and standard deviation for each set of data, and then use the formula for Pearson's r:\n\nr = Σ((xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)) / (n * sx * sy)\n\nwhere xi and yi are the individual data points, x_mean and y_mean are the means of the respective data sets, n is the number of data points, and sx and sy are the standard deviations of the respective data sets.\n\n1. Calculate the mean for each set of data:\n\nStudy time mean (x_mean) = (30 + 45 + 60 + 75 + 90 + 60 + 120 + 100 + 75 + 90) / 10 = 745 / 10 = 74.5 minutes\n\nExam score mean (y_mean) = (70 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 80 + 95 + 90 + 75 + 85) / 10 = 845 / 10 = 84.5 points\n\n2. Calculate the standard deviation for each set of data:\n\nFirst, find the sum of squared differences from the mean for each data set:\n\nStudy time: Σ(xi - x_mean)^2 = (30-74.5)^2 + (45-74.5)^2 + ... + (90-74.5)^2 = 6170.5\n\nExam score: Σ(yi - y_mean)^2 = (70-84.5)^2 + (80-84.5)^2 + ... + (85-84.5)^2 = 2127.5\n\nNow, divide each sum by the number of data points (n - 1) and take the square root:\n\nStudy time standard deviation (sx) = √(6170.5 / 9) ≈ 27.46\n\nExam score standard deviation (sy) = √(2127.5 / 9) ≈ 16.25\n\n3. Calculate the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r):\n\nr = Σ((xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)) / (n * sx * sy)\n\nFirst, find the sum of the product of the differences from the mean for each data point:\n\nΣ((xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)) = (30-74.5)(70-84.5) + (45-74.5)(80-84.5) + ... + (90-74.5)(85-84.5) = 3372.5\n\nNow, divide this sum by the product of the number of data points, and the standard deviations:\n\nr = 3372.5 / (10 * 27.46 * 16.25) ≈ 0.77\n\nThe correlation coefficient is approximately 0.77, which indicates a strong positive correlation between the amount of time spent studying for the math exam and the score on that exam. This means that, in general, students who spent more time studying tended to score higher on the exam."
