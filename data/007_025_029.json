    "message_2": "To calculate the shared secret key in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we first need to calculate the public keys for Alice and Bob.\n\nAlice's public key (A) is calculated as follows:\nA = g^a mod p\nA = 3^5 mod 17\nA = 243 mod 17\nA = 11\n\nBob's public key (B) is calculated as follows:\nB = g^b mod p\nB = 3^7 mod 17\nB = 2187 mod 17\nB = 10\n\nNow, to calculate the shared secret key (S), both Alice and Bob will use each other's public keys and their own secret integers.\n\nAlice calculates the shared secret key using Bob's public key (B) and her secret integer (a):\nS_Alice = B^a mod p\nS_Alice = 10^5 mod 17\nS_Alice = 100000 mod 17\nS_Alice = 3\n\nBob calculates the shared secret key using Alice's public key (A) and his secret integer (b):\nS_Bob = A^b mod p\nS_Bob = 11^7 mod 17\nS_Bob = 19487171 mod 17\nS_Bob = 3\n\nAs we can see, both Alice and Bob have calculated the same shared secret key (S = 3). This is the shared secret key in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange."
