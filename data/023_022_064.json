    "message_2": "To find the dominant oscillatory component, we need to identify the term with the highest amplitude in the given function. The function f(t) is given by:\n\nf(t) = 5cos(4πt) + 3sin(8πt) + 2cos(12πt)\n\nWe can see that the amplitudes of the three terms are 5, 3, and 2. The highest amplitude is 5, which corresponds to the term 5cos(4πt). \n\nNow, let's find the frequency of this dominant term. The general form of a cosine function is A*cos(ωt), where A is the amplitude and ω is the angular frequency. In our case, the dominant term is 5cos(4πt), so the angular frequency ω is 4π. To find the regular frequency (f), we can use the formula:\n\nf = ω / (2π)\n\nFor the dominant term, the frequency is:\n\nf = (4π) / (2π) = 2\n\nSo, the dominant oscillatory component in the stock price has an amplitude of 5 and a frequency of 2."
