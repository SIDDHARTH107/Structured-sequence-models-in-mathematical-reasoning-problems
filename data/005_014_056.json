    "message_1": "Suppose a researcher is interested in understanding the relationship between job satisfaction and work environment. They surveyed 100 employees and asked them to rate their job satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10 and their work environment on a scale of 1 to 5. The researcher ran a factor analysis and found that job satisfaction and work environment loaded on the same factor. The factor loading for job satisfaction was 0.8 and for work environment was 0.6. Calculate the variance explained by this factor.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the variance explained by this factor, we need to square the factor loadings and sum them up. This is because the squared factor loadings represent the proportion of variance in each variable that is explained by the factor.\n\nVariance explained by the factor = (factor loading for job satisfaction)^2 + (factor loading for work environment)^2\n\nVariance explained by the factor = (0.8)^2 + (0.6)^2\nVariance explained by the factor = 0.64 + 0.36\nVariance explained by the factor = 1\n\nSo, the variance explained by this factor is 1, which means that the factor accounts for 100% of the variance in both job satisfaction and work environment."
