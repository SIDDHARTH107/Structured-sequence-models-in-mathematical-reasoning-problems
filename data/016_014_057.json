Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "To find the fractal dimension of the Lévy C curve, we can use the similarity dimension formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the fractal dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Lévy C curve, there are N = 2 self-similar pieces, and the scaling factor is s = 1/3 (from the iterative function system).\n\nSo, the fractal dimension D is:\n\nD = log(2) / log(1/3)\n\nD ≈ 1.585\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the fractal dimension of the Lévy C curve is approximately 1.59."
