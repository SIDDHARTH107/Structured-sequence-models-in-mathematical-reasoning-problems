    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base area * Height\n\nThe base area of the rectangular pyramid can be found by multiplying the length and width of the base:\n\nBase area = Length * Width\nBase area = 6 cm * 8 cm\nBase area = 48 cm²\n\nNow, we can plug the base area and height into the volume formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 48 cm² * 4 cm\nVolume = (1/3) * 192 cm³\nVolume = 64 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 64 cubic centimeters."
