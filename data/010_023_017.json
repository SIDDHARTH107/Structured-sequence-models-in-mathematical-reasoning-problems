    "message_1": "What is the minimum number of crossings for an unknot of given topological type?\n\nSuppose we have a knot with 8 crossings. In order to find out if it is an unknot or not, we can apply a topological transformation called \"Flyping\" which replaces two strands of the knot crossing over each other with the opposite configuration (one strand over the other). We can repeat this process until we obtain either the unknot (a simple loop) or a knot that cannot be unknotted in this way. If we obtain the unknot, then the original knot was also an unknot. Otherwise, the original knot was not an unknot. The question is, what is the minimum number of crossings that the original knot must have in order for this method to work?",
    "message_2": "The minimum number of crossings for an unknot of a given topological type is 0. An unknot is a simple loop without any crossings, and it is already in its simplest form. Any knot with a non-zero number of crossings is not an unknot, and flyping may or may not help in simplifying it to an unknot. However, if a knot can be reduced to an unknot through a series of flypings, it is considered equivalent to an unknot."
