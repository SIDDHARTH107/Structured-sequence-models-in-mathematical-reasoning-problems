    "message_1": "Here's an example problem for a math student studying Regression analysis:\n\nSuppose a company wants to find the relationship between the number of years of experience (X) an employee has and their yearly salary (Y). They collected data from 10 employees and obtained the following output for the regression line:\n\nY = 5X + 15\n\nWhat is the predicted salary of an employee who has 7 years of experience according to this regression line?",
    "message_2": "To find the predicted salary of an employee with 7 years of experience, we can plug in the value of X (years of experience) into the regression equation:\n\nY = 5X + 15\n\nFor X = 7:\n\nY = 5(7) + 15\nY = 35 + 15\nY = 50\n\nSo, the predicted salary of an employee with 7 years of experience is $50,000 per year."
