    "message_2": "To find the rate at which the water level is rising, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = πr²h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height (or water level in this case). We are given the radius (r = 5 meters) and the rate at which the volume is increasing (dV/dt = 4 cubic meters per minute). We want to find the rate at which the height (water level) is increasing (dh/dt).\n\nFirst, we can differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:\n\ndV/dt = d(πr²h)/dt\n\nSince the radius is constant, we can treat πr² as a constant:\n\ndV/dt = πr²(dh/dt)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for dh/dt:\n\n4 = π(5²)(dh/dt)\n\n4 = 25π(dh/dt)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 25π:\n\ndh/dt = 4 / (25π)\n\ndh/dt ≈ 0.051 m/min\n\nSo, the water level is rising at a rate of approximately 0.051 meters per minute."
