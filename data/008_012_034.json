    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the matrix of variables (x and y), and B is the matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2 -3 |\n    | 5  4 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 7 |\n    | 1 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant(A) = (2 * 4) - (-3 * 5) = 8 + 15 = 23\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find the inverse of A using the formula A^(-1) = (1/determinant(A)) * adjoint(A), where adjoint(A) is the matrix obtained by swapping the diagonal elements of A and changing the signs of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nAdjoint(A) = |  4  3 |\n             | -5  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = (1/23) * |  4  3 |\n                  | -5  2 |\n\nNow, we multiply A^(-1) by B to find the matrix X.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = (1/23) * |  4  3 | * | 7 |\n             | -5  2 |   | 1 |\n\nX = (1/23) * | 4*7 + 3*1 |\n             |-5*7 + 2*1 |\n\nX = (1/23) * | 31 |\n             |-33 |\n\nX = | 31/23 |\n    |-33/23 |\n\nSo, the values of x and y are:\n\nx = 31/23\ny = -33/23"
