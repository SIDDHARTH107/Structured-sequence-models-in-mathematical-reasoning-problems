    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. The maximum independent set is the largest independent set in the graph.\n\nTo find the maximum independent set in G, we can start by identifying the connected components of the graph. In this case, there are two connected components:\n\n1. The subgraph with vertices {1, 2, 3} and edges {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}\n2. The subgraph with vertices {4, 5, 6, 7} and edges {(4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 7)}\n\nFor the first connected component, we can see that the maximum independent set is {1} or {2} or {3}, as any two of these vertices are adjacent. So, the size of the maximum independent set in this subgraph is 1.\n\nFor the second connected component, we can see that the maximum independent set is {4, 7} or {5, 7}. In either case, the size of the maximum independent set in this subgraph is 2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum independent set in G is the union of the maximum independent sets in the connected components, which is {1, 4, 7} or {1, 5, 7} or {2, 4, 7} or {2, 5, 7} or {3, 4, 7} or {3, 5, 7}. The size of the maximum independent set in G is 3."
