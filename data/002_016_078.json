    "message_1": "A ladder is resting against an equilateral triangular wall with a height of 9 meters. If the length of the ladder is 15 meters, how far is the base of the ladder from the wall?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall as x meters. Since the ladder is resting against the wall, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for x.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the ladder with a length of 15 meters, one side is the height of the triangular wall (9 meters), and the other side is the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall (x meters).\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem equation is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nwhere c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n15² = 9² + x²\n225 = 81 + x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x²:\n\nx² = 225 - 81\nx² = 144\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find the value of x:\n\nx = √144\nx = 12\n\nSo, the base of the ladder is 12 meters away from the wall."
