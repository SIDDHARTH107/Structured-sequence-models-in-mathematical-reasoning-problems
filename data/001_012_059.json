    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common factors in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: $9x^2 + 12x = 3x(3x + 4)$\n\nDenominator: $15x^2 - 18x = 3x(5x - 6)$\n\nNow, substitute the factored expressions back into the rational expression:\n\n$\\frac{9x^2+12x}{15x^2-18x} = \\frac{3x(3x + 4)}{3x(5x - 6)}$\n\nNext, we can cancel out the common factor of $3x$ in both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n$\\frac{3x(3x + 4)}{3x(5x - 6)} = \\frac{3x}{3x} \\cdot \\frac{3x + 4}{5x - 6} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{3x + 4}{5x - 6}$\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n$\\frac{3x + 4}{5x - 6}$"
