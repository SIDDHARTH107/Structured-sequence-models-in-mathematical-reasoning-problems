    "message_1": "Suppose there are 5 individuals who are members of a community. They are given $10 each to contribute towards a public project. The project requires a total of $50 to be completed. Each individual also has the option to keep their money and not contribute.\n\nAssuming that the individuals act rationally, how much money should each person contribute to maximize their own utility? What is the total amount of money contributed towards the project?",
    "message_2": "To determine how much money each person should contribute to maximize their own utility, we need to consider the benefits and costs of contributing to the project. Let's assume that the benefit of the completed project is equally shared among the 5 individuals, and the cost of contributing is the amount of money each person gives up.\n\nIf all individuals contribute $10 each, the project will be completed, and each person will receive the full benefit of the project. In this case, the cost of contributing is equal to the benefit received, so the net utility for each person is 0.\n\nIf an individual decides to keep their money and not contribute, they will still receive the benefit of the project if the other 4 individuals contribute the full amount. In this case, the net utility for the non-contributing individual is $10 (the money they kept) plus the benefit of the project. However, this scenario is unlikely, as the other individuals would also be acting rationally and may choose not to contribute as well.\n\nIn a scenario where all individuals act rationally and seek to maximize their own utility, it is likely that each person will contribute some amount less than $10, hoping that the others will make up the difference. However, this could lead to a situation where the project is not fully funded, and no one receives the benefit.\n\nIn conclusion, it is difficult to determine the exact amount each person should contribute to maximize their own utility, as it depends on the actions of the other individuals and the perceived benefit of the project. However, if all individuals contribute $10 each, the project will be completed, and the total amount of money contributed towards the project will be $50."
