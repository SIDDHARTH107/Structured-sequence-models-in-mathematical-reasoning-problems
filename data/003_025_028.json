    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the displacement vector, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry.\n\nLet's denote the eastward displacement as A and the northward displacement as B. The displacement vector can be represented as the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides A and B.\n\nA = 10 meters (eastward)\nB = 8 meters (northward)\n\nMagnitude:\nTo find the magnitude of the displacement vector, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nC = √(A^2 + B^2)\nC = √(10^2 + 8^2)\nC = √(100 + 64)\nC = √164\nC ≈ 12.81 meters\n\nDirection:\nTo find the direction of the displacement vector, we can use the tangent function:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite/adjacent\ntan(θ) = B/A\ntan(θ) = 8/10\nθ = arctan(8/10)\nθ ≈ 38.66 degrees\n\nSince the student is walking eastward and then northward, the angle is measured counterclockwise from the east direction. Therefore, the direction of the displacement vector is approximately 38.66 degrees north of east.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the displacement vector is approximately 12.81 meters, and its direction is approximately 38.66 degrees north of east."
