    "message_1": "Suppose two players, A and B, are playing a Dictator Game where Player A is the proposer and Player B is the recipient. Player A has $10 and must decide how much to give to Player B. If Player A offers x amount of money, Player B will receive 3x dollars. Find the value of x that maximizes the total money earned by both players.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the amount of money Player A offers as x. Since Player A has $10, the remaining amount of money for Player A after offering x dollars will be 10 - x. Player B will receive 3x dollars.\n\nThe total money earned by both players is the sum of the money Player A has left and the money Player B receives, which can be represented as:\n\nTotal money = (10 - x) + 3x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nTotal money = 10 - x + 3x\nTotal money = 10 + 2x\n\nTo maximize the total money earned by both players, we need to find the maximum value of the equation 10 + 2x. Since there is no constraint on x, the equation will keep increasing as x increases. However, we know that Player A has only $10 to offer, so the maximum value of x is 10.\n\nWhen x = 10, the total money earned by both players is:\n\nTotal money = 10 + 2(10)\nTotal money = 10 + 20\nTotal money = 30\n\nSo, the value of x that maximizes the total money earned by both players is x = 10. In this case, Player A offers all $10 to Player B, and Player B receives 3x = 3(10) = $30."
