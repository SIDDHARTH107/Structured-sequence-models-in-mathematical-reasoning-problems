    "message_2": "An isometry of the Euclidean plane is a transformation that preserves distances between points. In the context of this problem, we are looking for orientation-preserving isometries, which are also known as direct isometries. There are three types of direct isometries in the Euclidean plane: translations, rotations, and reflections through a line followed by a translation parallel to that line (also known as glide reflections).\n\n1. Translations: A translation is a transformation that moves every point in the plane by a fixed vector. If we denote the translation vector by $\\mathbf{v} = (a, b)$, then the translation map $f$ is given by\n\\[ f(x, y) = (x + a, y + b). \\]\n\n2. Rotations: A rotation is a transformation that rotates every point in the plane around a fixed point (called the center of rotation) by a fixed angle. If we denote the center of rotation by $(x_0, y_0)$ and the angle of rotation by $\\theta$, then the rotation map $f$ is given by\n\\[ f(x, y) = \\left( x_0 + (x - x_0)\\cos\\theta - (y - y_0)\\sin\\theta, y_0 + (x - x_0)\\sin\\theta + (y - y_0)\\cos\\theta \\right). \\]\n\n3. Glide reflections: A glide reflection is a transformation that reflects every point in the plane through a fixed line and then translates the result by a fixed vector parallel to the line. However, glide reflections do not preserve the orientation of the plane, so they are not included in the set of isometries we are looking for.\n\nThus, the set of all orientation-preserving isometries of the Euclidean plane consists of translations and rotations."
