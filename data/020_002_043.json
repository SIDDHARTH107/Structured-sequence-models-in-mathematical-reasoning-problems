    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products A and B. The profit margins for each unit of product A and B are $5 and $8, respectively. The company has 50 units of labor hours, 60 units of raw material, and 30 units of machine hours per day. The production process for product A requires 2 hours of labor, 3 units of raw material, and 1 unit of machine time. The production process for product B requires 1 hour of labor, 2 units of raw material, and 3 units of machine time.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can earn per day, and how many units of products A and B should they produce to achieve this maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 5x + 8y\n\nThe constraints for labor, raw material, and machine hours are as follows:\n\nLabor: 2x + y ≤ 50\nRaw material: 3x + 2y ≤ 60\nMachine hours: x + 3y ≤ 30\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y = 50 -> y = 50 - 2x\n2. 3x + 2y = 60 -> y = 30 - 1.5x\n3. x + 3y = 30 -> y = 10 - x/3\n\nThe feasible region is the area enclosed by the intersection of these lines and the non-negativity constraints. The corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 10), (10, 10), and (20, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each of these corner points:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 10) = 5(0) + 8(10) = $80\n3. P(10, 10) = 5(10) + 8(10) = $130\n4. P(20, 0) = 5(20) + 8(0) = $100\n\nThe maximum profit is $130 per day, which occurs when the company produces 10 units of product A and 10 units of product B."
