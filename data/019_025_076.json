    "message_1": "A factory produces 2000 shirts per day. The factory manager decides to increase the wages of the workers by 10% to improve their productivity. As a result, the production of shirts increased by 120 per day. What is the causal logic behind this increase in production?",
    "message_2": "The causal logic behind the increase in production can be explained as follows:\n\n1. The factory manager increases the wages of the workers by 10%.\n2. The workers, in response to the wage increase, feel more motivated and satisfied with their jobs.\n3. This increased motivation and job satisfaction lead to higher productivity among the workers.\n4. As a result of the higher productivity, the factory's daily production of shirts increases by 120.\n\nSo, the increase in wages is the primary cause that leads to the increase in production through the intermediate steps of improved motivation and productivity among the workers."
