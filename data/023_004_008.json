However, these integrals do not converge for all values of ω. Instead, we'll use the Dirac delta function, δ(ω), which is defined as:\n\nδ(ω) = ∞ for ω = 0\nδ(ω) = 0 for ω ≠ 0\n\nUsing the Dirac delta function, we can represent the Fourier transform F(ω) as:\n\nF(ω) = 5δ(ω-4) + 3δ(ω-7)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the given function f(t) = 5cos(4t) + 3sin(7t) is F(ω) = 5δ(ω-4) + 3δ(ω-7)."
