    "message_2": "To prove that the statement is a tautology, we will use the rules of higher-order logic and show that the statement is true for all possible values of P, Q, and R.\n\nLet's break down the statement:\n\n1. (P → Q) means \"If P is true, then Q is true.\"\n2. (Q → R) means \"If Q is true, then R is true.\"\n3. (P → R) means \"If P is true, then R is true.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the given statement:\n\n∀ P,Q,R. ((P → Q) ∧ (Q → R)) → (P → R)\n\nThis statement can be read as \"For all propositions P, Q, and R, if (P → Q) and (Q → R) are both true, then (P → R) is also true.\"\n\nWe will now prove this statement using a proof by cases:\n\nCase 1: P is true\n- If P is true and (P → Q) is true, then Q must also be true.\n- If Q is true and (Q → R) is true, then R must also be true.\n- Since P is true and R is true, (P → R) is true.\n\nCase 2: P is false\n- If P is false, then (P → Q) is vacuously true, regardless of the truth value of Q.\n- If P is false, then (P → R) is also vacuously true, regardless of the truth value of R.\n- Since (P → R) is true in this case, the statement holds.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that if (P → Q) and (Q → R) are true, then (P → R) is also true. Therefore, the statement is a tautology, as it is true for all possible values of P, Q, and R."
