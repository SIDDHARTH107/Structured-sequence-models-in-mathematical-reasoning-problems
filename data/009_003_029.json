    "message_1": "A metal rod is 10 cm long, and its initial temperature is 100°C. The two ends of the rod are kept at constant temperatures of 60°C and 40°C respectively. The rod is heated at a rate of 5°C/s from one end. If the thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.01 cm^2/s, use the heat transfer and diffusion equation to find the temperature of the rod after 10 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature of the rod after 10 seconds, we can use the heat transfer and diffusion equation, also known as the one-dimensional heat equation:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the metal.\n\nFirst, let's set up the boundary conditions:\n\n1. T(0,t) = 60°C (left end)\n2. T(10,t) = 40°C (right end)\n3. T(x,0) = 100°C (initial temperature)\n\nSince the rod is heated at a rate of 5°C/s from one end, we can modify the first boundary condition:\n\n1. T(0,t) = 60°C + 5t\n\nNow, we need to solve the heat equation with these boundary conditions. To do this, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other only on t:\n\nT(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = αX''(x)T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by αXT, we get:\n\nT'(t)/αT(t) = X''(x)/X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\nT'(t)/αT(t) = -λ²\nX''(x)/X(x) = -λ²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1. T'(t) = -αλ²T(t)\n2. X''(x) = -λ²X(x)\n\nThe general solution for the first equation is:\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-αλ²t)\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nThe general solution for the second equation is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants.\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions to find the constants A, B, C, and λ. Applying the first boundary condition:\n\n60 + 5t = T(0,t) = X(0)T(t) = (A*cos(0) + B*sin(0))Ce^(-αλ²t) = ACe^(-αλ²t)\n\nSince this must hold for all t, we have:\n\nA = 60\n\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n\n40 = T(10,t) = X(10)T(t) = (60*cos(λ*10) + B*sin(λ*10))Ce^(-αλ²t)\n\nSince this must hold for all t, we have:\n\n60*cos(λ*10) + B*sin(λ*10) = 40\n\nNow, we need to find λ and B that satisfy this equation. This is a transcendental equation and cannot be solved analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to find an approximate solution.\n\nUsing a numerical solver, we find that:\n\nλ ≈ 0.287\nB ≈ -46.97\n\nNow, we can write the solution as:\n\nT(x,t) = 60Ce^(-αλ²t)cos(λx) - 46.97Ce^(-αλ²t)sin(λx)\n\nFinally, we need to apply the initial condition to find the constant C:\n\n100 = T(x,0) = 60C*cos(λx) - 46.97C*sin(λx)\n\nThis equation must hold for all x, so we can choose x = 0:\n\n100 = 60C\n\nC = 100/60 = 5/3\n\nNow, we have the complete solution:\n\nT(x,t) = (5/3)e^(-αλ²t)(60cos(λx) - 46.97sin(λx))\n\nTo find the temperature of the rod after 10 seconds, plug in t = 10:\n\nT(x,10) = (5/3)e^(-0.01*0.287²*10)(60cos(0.287x) - 46.97sin(0.287x))\n\nThis equation gives the temperature distribution along the rod after 10 seconds. To find the temperature at a specific location, plug in the desired value of x."
