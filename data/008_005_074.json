    "message_1": "Solve the following non-homogeneous system of linear equations using the appropriate techniques from linear algebra:\n\n4x + 2y + z = 10\n\n3x − y + 2z = 5\n\n−2x + 3y − z = 0\n\nProvide the solution for x, y, and z in the system of equations.",
    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we can write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n|  4   2   1 | 10\n|  3  -1   2 |  5\n| -2   3  -1 |  0\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2:\n\n|  3  -1   2 |  5\n|  4   2   1 | 10\n| -2   3  -1 |  0\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-4/3)Row 1 + Row 2:\n\n|  3  -1   2 |  5\n|  0   2   1 | 10\n| -2   3  -1 |  0\n\n3. Replace Row 3 with (-2/3)Row 1 + Row 3:\n\n|  3  -1   2 |  5\n|  0   2   1 | 10\n|  0   1   1 | 10\n\n4. Replace Row 3 with (-1/2)Row 2 + Row 3:\n\n|  3  -1   2 |  5\n|  0   2   1 | 10\n|  0   0   1 |  5\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 5.\n\nFrom the second row, we have 2y + z = 10, so 2y + 5 = 10, which gives y = 2.5.\n\nFrom the first row, we have 3x - y + 2z = 5, so 3x - 2.5 + 10 = 5, which gives x = -0.5.\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = -0.5, y = 2.5, and z = 5."
