    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the system, we first need to find the Laplace transform of the input signal u(t) = 5sin(2πt). The Laplace transform of a sine function is given by:\n\nL{sin(at)} = a / (s^2 + a^2)\n\nIn our case, a = 2π. So, the Laplace transform of u(t) is:\n\nU(s) = 2π / (s^2 + (2π)^2)\n\nNow, we can find the output in the frequency domain by multiplying the transfer function G(s) with the Laplace transform of the input signal U(s):\n\nY(s) = G(s) * U(s) = (100 / (s^2 + 10s + 100)) * (2π / (s^2 + (2π)^2))\n\nTo find the steady-state response, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s). However, this can be quite complex, so we will use the Final Value Theorem to find the steady-state response directly from Y(s). The Final Value Theorem states:\n\ny_ss(t) = lim (t->∞) y(t) = lim (s->0) s * Y(s)\n\nApplying the Final Value Theorem:\n\ny_ss(t) = lim (s->0) s * (100 / (s^2 + 10s + 100)) * (2π / (s^2 + (2π)^2))\n\ny_ss(t) = lim (s->0) (100 * 2π * s) / ((s^2 + 10s + 100) * (s^2 + (2π)^2))\n\nSince the numerator has a single s term and the denominator has s^2 terms, the limit as s approaches 0 will be:\n\ny_ss(t) = 0\n\nSo, the steady-state response of the system is 0."
