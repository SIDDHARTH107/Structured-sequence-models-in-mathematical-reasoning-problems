    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5}. Determine if the following equation holds true: \n\n(AxB)' = A' x B' \n\nwhere ' denotes the complement and x denotes the Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the equation (AxB)' = A' x B' holds true, we first need to find the Cartesian product AxB, and then find its complement. After that, we will find the complements of A and B, and then find their Cartesian product. Finally, we will compare the two results to see if they are equal.\n\n1. Find AxB:\nAxB = {(1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5)}\n\n2. Find (AxB)':\nSince we are not given a universal set, we cannot find the exact complement of AxB. However, we can still proceed with the next steps and compare the structure of the sets.\n\n3. Find A' and B':\nAgain, we cannot find the exact complements of A and B without a universal set, but we can denote them as A' and B' respectively.\n\n4. Find A' x B':\nA' x B' = { (a', b') | a' ∈ A', b' ∈ B' }\n\n5. Compare (AxB)' and A' x B':\nWe cannot directly compare the two sets since we do not have the exact elements of A', B', and (AxB)'. However, we can observe that the equation (AxB)' = A' x B' holds true in general, as the complement of the Cartesian product of two sets is equal to the Cartesian product of their complements.\n\nIn conclusion, without a universal set, we cannot determine the exact elements of the sets, but the equation (AxB)' = A' x B' holds true in general."
