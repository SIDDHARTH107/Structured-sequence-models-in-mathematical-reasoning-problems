    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using Ramsey's Theory. In particular, we are looking for the smallest number R(4,3), which is the smallest number of vertices in a graph that guarantees either a complete graph of size 4 (K4) or an independent set of size 3 (I3).\n\nTo find R(4,3), we can use the inequality R(m,n) ≤ R(m-1,n) + R(m,n-1) for m, n ≥ 2. \n\nWe know that R(3,3) = 6. Now, we can find R(4,3) using the inequality:\n\nR(4,3) ≤ R(3,3) + R(4,2)\n\nSince R(4,2) is trivially 4 (as any graph with 4 vertices will have either a complete graph of size 4 or an independent set of size 2), we have:\n\nR(4,3) ≤ 6 + 4\n\nR(4,3) ≤ 10\n\nNow, we need to show that there exists a graph with 9 vertices that does not contain a complete graph of size 4 or an independent set of size 3. We can construct such a graph using three disjoint complete graphs of size 3 (K3). Each K3 has 3 vertices and 3 edges, and there are no edges between the K3s.\n\nIn this graph, there is no complete graph of size 4, as the largest complete graph is K3. Additionally, there is no independent set of size 3, as each vertex is connected to two other vertices within its K3, and there are no connections between the K3s.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of vertices that a graph must have in order to guarantee that it contains either a complete graph of size 4 or an independent set of size 3 is R(4,3) = 10."
