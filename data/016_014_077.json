    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal that can be constructed using a recursive process. At each iteration, the curve's length increases by a factor of √2, while the area enclosed by the curve increases by a factor of 2.\n\nLet's denote the length of the curve at the 0th iteration as L0 and the area enclosed by the curve at the 0th iteration as A0. Then, the length and area at the 8th iteration can be represented as:\n\nL8 = L0 * (√2)^8\nA8 = A0 * 2^8\n\nNow, we want to find the ratio of the perimeter (length) to the area at the 8th iteration:\n\nRatio = L8 / A8\n\nSubstitute the expressions for L8 and A8:\n\nRatio = (L0 * (√2)^8) / (A0 * 2^8)\n\nSince L0 and A0 are constants, we can simplify the expression by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by L0 * A0:\n\nRatio = (√2)^8 / 2^8\n\nNow, we can simplify further by noting that (√2)^8 = 2^4:\n\nRatio = 2^4 / 2^8\n\nSubtract the exponents:\n\nRatio = 2^(4-8)\n\nRatio = 2^(-4)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the perimeter to the area of the Lévy C curve at the 8th iteration is 1/16 or 0.0625."
