    "message_2": "A Gosper curve is a fractal curve, and its length increases with each increase in order. The length of a Gosper curve of order n is given by the formula:\n\nLength = (previous length) * (7/3)\n\nSo, to find the length of a Gosper curve of order 5, we can use the given length of the order 4 curve:\n\nLength of order 5 curve = (2187 units) * (7/3)\nLength of order 5 curve = 5103 units\n\nTherefore, the new total length of the Gosper curve of order 5 is 5103 units."
