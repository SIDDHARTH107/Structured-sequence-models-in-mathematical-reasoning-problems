    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the matrix method, we first need to write the given system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nGiven system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 4y - z = 10\n6x - 3y + 2z = 4\n\nMatrix A (coefficients):\n[ 2,  4, -1]\n[ 6, -3,  2]\n\nMatrix X (variables):\n[ x]\n[ y]\n[ z]\n\nMatrix B (constants):\n[10]\n[ 4]\n\nNow, we have AX = B:\n\n[ 2,  4, -1] [ x]   [10]\n[ 6, -3,  2] [ y] = [ 4]\n             [ z]\n\nTo find the solution, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (A_inv) and then multiply it by matrix B:\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nHowever, since matrix A is not a square matrix (it has 2 rows and 3 columns), we cannot find its inverse directly. Instead, we can use the least squares method to find an approximate solution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the transpose of matrix A (A_T):\n\nA_T:\n[ 2,  6]\n[ 4, -3]\n[-1,  2]\n\nNow, we can find the product of A_T and A:\n\nA_T * A:\n[ 2,  6] [ 2,  4, -1]   [ 40, -14,  10]\n[ 4, -3] [ 6, -3,  2] = [-14,  25,  -7]\n[-1,  2]              [ 10,  -7,   5]\n\nNext, we find the inverse of the resulting matrix (A_T * A)_inv:\n\n(A_T * A)_inv:\n[ 1/30,  7/150, -1/10]\n[ 7/150,  1/25,  1/5 ]\n[-1/10,   1/5,   1/2 ]\n\nNow, we can find the product of (A_T * A)_inv and A_T:\n\n(A_T * A)_inv * A_T:\n[ 1/30,  7/150, -1/10] [ 2,  6]   [ 1/15,  1/5 ]\n[ 7/150,  1/25,  1/5 ] [ 4, -3] = [ 3/25, -1/5 ]\n[-1/10,   1/5,   1/2 ] [-1,  2]   [-1/2,   1/2 ]\n\nFinally, we can find the approximate solution X by multiplying the result by matrix B:\n\nX = (A_T * A)_inv * A_T * B:\n[ 1/15,  1/5 ] [10]   [ 2]\n[ 3/25, -1/5 ] [ 4] = [ 1]\n[-1/2,   1/2 ]\n\nSo, the approximate solution for the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx ≈ 2\ny ≈ 1\n\nNote that this is an approximate solution because the given system of linear equations has more variables than equations, which means it has infinitely many solutions. The least squares method provides an approximation that minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals (the differences between the actual and predicted values)."
