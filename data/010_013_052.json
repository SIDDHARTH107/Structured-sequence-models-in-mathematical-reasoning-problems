    "message_2": "To determine the total Chern class $c(E)$ of the vector bundle $E \\rightarrow M$ with rank $n=3$ over a sphere $S^2$, we first need to recall some basic facts about Chern classes and their properties.\n\nThe total Chern class $c(E)$ of a rank $n$ complex vector bundle $E$ is given by the product of its individual Chern classes $c_i(E)$, where $i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$. The Chern classes are elements of the cohomology ring $H^*(M; \\mathbb{Z})$, and they satisfy the following properties:\n\n1. $c_0(E) = 1$.\n2. $c(E \\oplus F) = c(E) \\cdot c(F)$ for any two vector bundles $E$ and $F$.\n3. If $E$ is a line bundle, then $c_1(E)$ generates the cohomology group $H^2(M; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nNow, let's consider the sphere $S^2$. The cohomology ring of $S^2$ is given by $H^*(S^2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^3)$, where $x$ is a generator of $H^2(S^2; \\mathbb{Z})$ and has degree 2. Since $E$ has rank 3, we can write the total Chern class as:\n\n$$c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E) + c_3(E).$$\n\nHowever, since $E$ is a rank 3 vector bundle over $S^2$, we know that $c_i(E) = 0$ for $i > 2$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E).$$\n\nNow, we need to determine $c_1(E)$ and $c_2(E)$. Since $E$ is a rank 3 vector bundle, we can write it as a direct sum of three line bundles, say $E = L_1 \\oplus L_2 \\oplus L_3$. Using property 2 of Chern classes, we have:\n\n$$c(E) = c(L_1) \\cdot c(L_2) \\cdot c(L_3).$$\n\nFor each line bundle $L_i$, we have $c(L_i) = 1 + c_1(L_i)$. Therefore,\n\n$$c(E) = (1 + c_1(L_1))(1 + c_1(L_2))(1 + c_1(L_3)).$$\n\nExpanding this product, we get:\n\n$$c(E) = 1 + (c_1(L_1) + c_1(L_2) + c_1(L_3)) + (c_1(L_1)c_1(L_2) + c_1(L_1)c_1(L_3) + c_1(L_2)c_1(L_3)) + c_1(L_1)c_1(L_2)c_1(L_3).$$\n\nComparing this with the expression for $c(E)$ above, we can identify:\n\n$$c_1(E) = c_1(L_1) + c_1(L_2) + c_1(L_3)$$\n$$c_2(E) = c_1(L_1)c_1(L_2) + c_1(L_1)c_1(L_3) + c_1(L_2)c_1(L_3).$$\n\nSince $S^2$ is simply connected, all line bundles over $S^2$ are trivial, which means that $c_1(L_i) = 0$ for $i = 1, 2, 3$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$c_1(E) = 0$$\n$$c_2(E) = 0.$$\n\nThus, the total Chern class of the rank 3 vector bundle $E$ over $S^2$ is:\n\n$$c(E) = 1.$$"
