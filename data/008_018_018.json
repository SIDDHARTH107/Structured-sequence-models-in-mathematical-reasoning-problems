    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using block matrices, we first represent the system as a matrix equation AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables, and B is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  1  1  2 |\n    | 2  4  2  4 |\n    | 3  2  2  1 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n    | w |\n\nB = | 13 |\n    | 26 |\n    | 10 |\n\nNow, we can use Gaussian elimination to find the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of the augmented matrix [A|B]:\n\n| 1  1  1  2 | 13 |\n| 2  4  2  4 | 26 |\n| 3  2  2  1 | 10 |\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row and 3 times the first row from the third row.\n\n| 1  1  1  2 | 13 |\n| 0  2  0  0 |  0 |\n| 0 -1 -1 -5 | -29 |\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by 2 and add the third row to the first row.\n\n| 1  0  0 -3 | -16 |\n| 0  1  0  0 |  0  |\n| 0 -1 -1 -5 | -29 |\n\nStep 3: Add the second row to the third row.\n\n| 1  0  0 -3 | -16 |\n| 0  1  0  0 |  0  |\n| 0  0 -1 -5 | -29 |\n\nStep 4: Multiply the third row by -1.\n\n| 1  0  0 -3 | -16 |\n| 0  1  0  0 |  0  |\n| 0  0  1  5 |  29 |\n\nStep 5: Add 3 times the third row to the first row.\n\n| 1  0  0  0 |  3  |\n| 0  1  0  0 |  0  |\n| 0  0  1  5 |  29 |\n\nNow we have the RREF of the augmented matrix, and we can read the solution directly:\n\nx = 3\ny = 0\nz = 29 - 5w\nw = free variable\n\nSince w is a free variable, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations, depending on the value of w."
