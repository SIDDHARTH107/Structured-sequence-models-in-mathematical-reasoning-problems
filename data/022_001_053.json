    "message_2": "To analytically continue the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{1-z}$ to the entire complex plane, we can first rewrite it as a geometric series. Recall that for $|z| < 1$, we have the geometric series formula:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1-z} = 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + \\cdots$$\n\nNow, we want to determine the value of the function at $z = i$. Since $|i| = 1$, the geometric series formula is not directly applicable. However, we can rewrite the function as follows:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{1-z} = \\frac{1}{(1+i)(1-i)} = \\frac{1}{2}(1+i)\\frac{1}{1-i}$$\n\nNow, we can apply the geometric series formula to the term $\\frac{1}{1-i}$, since $|i| < 1$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1-i} = 1 + i + i^2 + i^3 + \\cdots$$\n\nSubstituting the powers of $i$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1-i} = 1 + i - 1 - i + 1 + i - 1 - i + \\cdots$$\n\nThis series converges to $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}i$. Therefore, the value of the function at $z = i$ is:\n\n$$f(i) = \\frac{1}{2}(1+i)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}i\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}(1+i)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(1 + 2i + i^2) = \\frac{1}{4}(1 + 2i - 1) = \\frac{1}{2}i$$\n\nSo, the analytically continued function $f(z)$ at $z = i$ is $f(i) = \\frac{1}{2}i$."
