    "message_1": "A manufacturing plant has three machines labeled A, B, and C, which can produce 300, 400, and 500 units per hour, respectively. The plant needs to produce at least 2000 units per hour. Each machine can operate up to 8 hours per day. How many hours should each machine be used to meet the production target while minimizing the total operating cost? The cost per hour for each machine is $20 for machine A, $25 for machine B, and $30 for machine C.",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z be the number of hours machines A, B, and C are used, respectively. We want to minimize the total operating cost while meeting the production target of at least 2000 units per hour.\n\nObjective function (total cost): C = 20x + 25y + 30z\n\nConstraints:\n1. Production target: 300x + 400y + 500z ≥ 2000\n2. Maximum hours per day: x ≤ 8, y ≤ 8, z ≤ 8\n3. Non-negative hours: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, z ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region that satisfies all constraints. We can start by finding the minimum number of hours for each machine to meet the production target.\n\n300x + 400y + 500z ≥ 2000\n\nLet's try to minimize the use of machine A (x = 0):\n400y + 500z ≥ 2000\ny + 1.25z ≥ 5\n\nNow, let's minimize the use of machine B (y = 0):\n300x + 500z ≥ 2000\nx + 1.67z ≥ 6.67\n\nNow, let's minimize the use of machine C (z = 0):\n300x + 400y ≥ 2000\nx + 1.33y ≥ 6.67\n\nWe can now analyze the feasible region:\n1. y + 1.25z ≥ 5, x = 0\n2. x + 1.67z ≥ 6.67, y = 0\n3. x + 1.33y ≥ 6.67, z = 0\n\nWe can find the intersection points of these lines:\n1. y = 5 - 1.25z\n2. x = 6.67 - 1.67z\n3. x = 6.67 - 1.33y\n\nSubstitute (1) into (3):\nx = 6.67 - 1.33(5 - 1.25z)\nx = 6.67 - 6.65 + 1.66z\nx = 1.66z\n\nSubstitute (2) into (3):\n6.67 - 1.67z = 6.67 - 1.33y\n1.67z = 1.33y\ny = 1.25z\n\nNow we have:\nx = 1.66z\ny = 1.25z\n\nSince x, y, and z are all less than or equal to 8, we can find the maximum value of z that satisfies these conditions:\nx = 1.66z ≤ 8\nz ≤ 8/1.66\nz ≤ 4.82\n\ny = 1.25z ≤ 8\nz ≤ 8/1.25\nz ≤ 6.4\n\nSince z ≤ 4.82 is the most restrictive constraint, we can use that value:\nz = 4.82\nx = 1.66 * 4.82 ≈ 8\ny = 1.25 * 4.82 ≈ 6\n\nSo, the optimal solution is to use machine A for 8 hours, machine B for 6 hours, and machine C for 4.82 hours. This will minimize the total operating cost while meeting the production target of at least 2000 units per hour."
