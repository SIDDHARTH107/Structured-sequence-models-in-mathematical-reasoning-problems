    "message_2": "To prove that there cannot exist a group of order 12 that is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group, we will first look at the properties of the Klein 4-group and then show that a group of order 12 cannot have these properties.\n\nThe Klein 4-group, denoted as V_4, is a group with the following properties:\n1. It has order 4, meaning it has 4 elements.\n2. It is abelian, meaning that its operation is commutative (i.e., a * b = b * a for all elements a, b in the group).\n3. All of its non-identity elements have order 2, meaning that for any non-identity element a in the group, a * a = e (the identity element).\n\nNow, let's assume for contradiction that there exists a group G of order 12 that is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group. This means that there exists a bijective function f: G -> V_4 such that f(ab) = f(a)f(b) for all elements a, b in G.\n\n1. Since G is isomorphic to V_4, it must have the same order as V_4, which is 4. However, we are given that G has order 12, which is a contradiction.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to V_4, it must also be abelian. However, there exist non-abelian groups of order 12, such as the alternating group A_4. This means that G cannot be isomorphic to V_4 in general.\n\n3. If G is isomorphic to V_4, all non-identity elements in G must have order 2. However, by the Sylow theorems, a group of order 12 must have a subgroup of order 3, and thus must have an element of order 3. This contradicts the requirement that all non-identity elements in G have order 2.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that there cannot exist a group of order 12 that is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group."
