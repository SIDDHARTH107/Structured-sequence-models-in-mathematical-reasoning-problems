The company's production capacity is limited to 300 units for X and 200 units for Y. It is known that each product requires 2 hours of labor for X and 3 hours for Y, and the total labor hours available are 700. What should the company produce to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal combination of products X and Y that the company should produce, given the constraints on production capacity and labor hours.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y.\n\nThe profit function P(x, y) can be represented as:\nP(x, y) = 8x + 12y\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n1. Production capacity constraint for X: x ≤ 300\n2. Production capacity constraint for Y: y ≤ 200\n3. Labor hours constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 700\n\nWe will use the method of Linear Programming to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x = 300 (vertical line)\n2. y = 200 (horizontal line)\n3. 2x + 3y = 700 (solve for y: y = (700 - 2x) / 3)\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices A(0, 0), B(300, 0), C(300, 100), and D(200, 200).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nA(0, 0): P(0, 0) = 8(0) + 12(0) = $0\nB(300, 0): P(300, 0) = 8(300) + 12(0) = $2400\nC(300, 100): P(300, 100) = 8(300) + 12(100) = $4800\nD(200, 200): P(200, 200) = 8(200) + 12(200) = $4000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex C(300, 100), with a profit of $4800.\n\nTherefore, the company should produce 300 units of product X and 100 units of product Y to maximize the profit."
