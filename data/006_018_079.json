    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one company experiencing financial fraud, we can first find the probability that none of the companies experience financial fraud and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a company not experiencing financial fraud is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince there are 20 companies, the probability that none of them experience financial fraud is (0.95)^20 ≈ 0.3585.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one company experiencing financial fraud by subtracting the probability of none of them experiencing financial fraud from 1:\n\n1 - 0.3585 ≈ 0.6415.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one company will experience a financial fraud is approximately 0.6415 or 64.15%."
