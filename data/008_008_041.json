    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products, Product A and Product B.Each unit of Product A requires 1 hour of assembly time and 2 hours of painting time while each unit of Product B requires 2 hours of assembly time and 1 hour of painting time. The profit earned by selling one unit of Product A is $60 and that of Product B is $70. If the total assembly time available is 400 hours and the total painting time available is 500 hours, determine the number of units of each product that should be produced to maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the assembly and painting times are:\n\n1x + 2y ≤ 400 (assembly time)\n2x + 1y ≤ 500 (painting time)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 60x + 70y\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1x + 2y ≤ 400\n2y ≤ 400 - x\ny ≤ 200 - 0.5x\n\n2x + 1y ≤ 500\ny ≤ 500 - 2x\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. We also need to consider the non-negativity constraints x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.\n\n1. Intersection of x-axis and the line y = 200 - 0.5x:\nx = 0, y = 200\n\n2. Intersection of y-axis and the line y = 500 - 2x:\nx = 250, y = 0\n\n3. Intersection of the lines y = 200 - 0.5x and y = 500 - 2x:\n200 - 0.5x = 500 - 2x\n1.5x = 300\nx = 200\n\ny = 500 - 2(200) = 100\n\nSo, the intersection point is (200, 100).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 60x + 70y at each of the vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 200) = 60(0) + 70(200) = $14,000\n2. P(250, 0) = 60(250) + 70(0) = $15,000\n3. P(200, 100) = 60(200) + 70(100) = $19,000\n\nThe maximum profit of $19,000 is achieved when producing 200 units of Product A and 100 units of Product B."
