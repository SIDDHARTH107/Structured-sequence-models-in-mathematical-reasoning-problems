    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted by A △ B. Then find the complement of A, which is Ac = {0, 4, 5, 6, ...}. Finally, calculate the symmetric difference of Ac and B, denoted by Ac △ B. Verify that (A △ B) ∪ Ac is not equal to Ac △ B.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted by A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A, denoted by Ac. The complement of A is the set of all elements that are not in A. Since no upper limit is given, we will consider the complement in the context of natural numbers.\n\nAc = {0, 4, 5, 6, ...}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of Ac and B, denoted by Ac △ B.\n\nAc △ B = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, ...}\n\nNow, let's find the union of (A △ B) and Ac, denoted by (A △ B) ∪ Ac.\n\n(A △ B) ∪ Ac = {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, ...}\n\nWe can see that (A △ B) ∪ Ac is not equal to Ac △ B, as the former contains the element 1, while the latter does not."
