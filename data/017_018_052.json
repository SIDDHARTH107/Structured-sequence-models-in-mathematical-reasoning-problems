    "message_2": "1. The group of symmetries of a regular octagon:\nThis group is the dihedral group D16, which has order 16, not 32. So it is not isomorphic to any of the groups of order 32.\n\n2. The group of invertible 4x4 matrices over the field F2:\nThis group is the general linear group GL(4, F2). The order of this group is (2^4 - 1)(2^4 - 2)(2^4 - 2^1)(2^4 - 2^2) = 15 * 14 * 12 * 8 = 20160, which is not 32. So it is not isomorphic to any of the groups of order 32.\n\n3. The group of units of the ring Z/32Z:\nThis group is the multiplicative group of units modulo 32, denoted as (Z/32Z)^*. The order of this group is given by Euler's totient function, φ(32) = 32 * (1 - 1/2) = 16. So it is not isomorphic to any of the groups of order 32.\n\n4. The semi-direct product of the cyclic group C8 and the cyclic group C4:\nThe semi-direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 8 and 4 can have order 32. However, the semi-direct product of C8 and C4 is isomorphic to the dihedral group D16, which has order 16, not 32. So it is not isomorphic to any of the groups of order 32.\n\n5. The group of automorphisms of the cyclic group C8:\nThe automorphism group of a cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to the group of units of the ring Z/nZ. In this case, the automorphism group of C8 is isomorphic to (Z/8Z)^*. The order of this group is given by Euler's totient function, φ(8) = 8 * (1 - 1/2) = 4. So it is not isomorphic to any of the groups of order 32.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the given groups are isomorphic to the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32."
