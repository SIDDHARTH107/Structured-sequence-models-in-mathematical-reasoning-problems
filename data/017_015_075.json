    "message_2": "To find the possible number of non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3^1. Let G be a group of order 24.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we consider the possible cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Both P and Q are normal in G, and G is the internal direct product of P and Q. Since P is of order 8 and Q is of order 3, G is isomorphic to Z_8 × Z_3, which is an abelian group.\n\n2. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and four Sylow 3-subgroups. P is normal in G, but the Sylow 3-subgroups are not. G is a semidirect product of P and a Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Since P is of order 8, it is either isomorphic to Z_8 or Z_2 × Z_4. The automorphism group of Z_8 is isomorphic to Z_4, and the automorphism group of Z_2 × Z_4 is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_4. In both cases, there is a nontrivial homomorphism from Q to the automorphism group of P, so we have two non-isomorphic non-abelian groups in this case: a semidirect product of Z_8 and Z_3, and a semidirect product of Z_2 × Z_4 and Z_3.\n\n3. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Q is normal in G, but the Sylow 2-subgroups are not. G is a semidirect product of a Sylow 2-subgroup P and Q. Since Q is of order 3, its automorphism group is isomorphic to Z_2. There is a nontrivial homomorphism from P to the automorphism group of Q, so we have one non-isomorphic non-abelian group in this case: a semidirect product of Z_2^3 and Z_3.\n\n4. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4: In this case, both the Sylow 2-subgroups and the Sylow 3-subgroups are not normal in G. The group G must be a semidirect product of a Sylow 2-subgroup P and a Sylow 3-subgroup Q. However, this case is not possible because there is no nontrivial homomorphism from Q to the automorphism group of P that would give a non-abelian group.\n\nIn summary, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 24: one abelian (Z_8 × Z_3) and four non-abelian (two semidirect products of Z_8 and Z_3, one semidirect product of Z_2 × Z_4 and Z_3, and one semidirect product of Z_2^3 and Z_3). Every group of order 24 is isomorphic to one of these groups."
