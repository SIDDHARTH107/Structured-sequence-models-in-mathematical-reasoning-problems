    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape created by iteratively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the entire larger cube are removed. This leaves 20 smaller cubes.\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the volume of the Menger sponge can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nVolume = (initial volume) * (20/27)^iterations\n\nIn this case, the initial cube has a side length of 3 cm, so its volume is 3^3 = 27 cubic centimeters. After 4 iterations, the volume of the Menger sponge is:\n\nVolume = 27 * (20/27)^4\nVolume ≈ 27 * 0.1602\nVolume ≈ 4.3254 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the Menger sponge after 4 iterations is approximately 4.3254 cubic centimeters."
