    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA manufacturing company has two production lines, A and B, that produce the same product. The company wants to maximize its profit by determining the optimal allocation of resources for each line. The company has a total of 400 units of resource available per day. Line A requires 20 units of resource per product and produces products that sell for $50 each. Line B requires 30 units of resource per product and produces products that sell for $80 each. Using the simulated annealing method, determine the optimal allocation of resources for each line to maximize the company's profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function: In this case, the objective function is the profit function, which we want to maximize. The profit function is given by:\n\nProfit = 50 * (number of products produced by line A) + 80 * (number of products produced by line B)\n\n2. Define the constraints: The constraints are given by the available resources and the resource requirements of each production line. We have:\n\n20 * (number of products produced by line A) + 30 * (number of products produced by line B) <= 400\n\n3. Initialize the solution: Start with an initial allocation of resources, for example, allocate all resources to line A.\n\n4. Generate a neighboring solution: Randomly change the allocation of resources between the two production lines.\n\n5. Calculate the change in profit: Determine the difference in profit between the current solution and the neighboring solution.\n\n6. Accept or reject the neighboring solution: If the neighboring solution has a higher profit, accept it. If the neighboring solution has a lower profit, accept it with a probability that depends on the temperature parameter.\n\n7. Update the temperature: Decrease the temperature parameter according to a cooling schedule.\n\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 until the temperature is sufficiently low or a stopping criterion is met.\n\nAfter performing the simulated annealing method, we will obtain the optimal allocation of resources for each production line that maximizes the company's profit. Due to the stochastic nature of the simulated annealing method, the results may vary between different runs. However, the method will generally converge to a near-optimal solution."
