    "message_1": "In a game of Stag Hunt, two hunters have a choice to either hunt a stag or a hare. If they hunt a stag together, they both get a reward of 10. If one hunter hunts a hare and the other hunts a stag, the hunter who hunts the hare gets a reward of 1, and the other hunter gets nothing. If both hunters hunt a hare, they each get a reward of 5.\n\nSuppose the two hunters coordinate their actions perfectly and always hunt together. What is the best strategy for each hunter to maximize their reward and which animal should they hunt?",
    "message_2": "Since the two hunters coordinate their actions perfectly and always hunt together, the best strategy for each hunter to maximize their reward is to hunt a stag. When they both hunt a stag, they each get a reward of 10, which is the highest possible reward for each hunter. If they both hunt a hare, they would only get a reward of 5 each, which is lower than the reward for hunting a stag together. Therefore, they should both hunt a stag to maximize their reward."
