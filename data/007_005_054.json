    "message_2": "The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two prime numbers p and q is the product of the two primes since they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, we have:\n\np * q = 935\n\nSince 935 is the product of two prime numbers, we need to find the prime factors of 935. The prime factors of 935 are 5 and 187. However, 187 is not a prime number as it can be further factored into 11 and 17, both of which are prime numbers. So, the prime factors of 935 are 5, 11, and 17.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of p and q are:\n\np = 5, q = 11 * 17 = 187\nor\np = 11, q = 5 * 17 = 85\nor\np = 17, q = 5 * 11 = 55"
