    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the LU decomposition method, we first need to decompose the given matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nMatrix A:\n|  3   2  -1 |\n|  2  -4   4 |\n| -1  0.5 -1 |\n\nStep 1: Decompose matrix A into L and U matrices.\n\nMatrix L:\n| 1   0   0 |\n| l21 1   0 |\n| l31 l32 1 |\n\nMatrix U:\n| u11 u12 u13 |\n|  0  u22 u23 |\n|  0   0  u33 |\n\nStep 2: Perform forward substitution to solve Ly = b.\n\nMatrix L:\n| 1   0   0 | | y1 |   |  1  |\n| l21 1   0 | | y2 | = | -2  |\n| l31 l32 1 | | y3 |   | 0.5 |\n\nStep 3: Perform backward substitution to solve Ux = y.\n\nMatrix U:\n| u11 u12 u13 | | x1 |   | y1 |\n|  0  u22 u23 | | x2 | = | y2 |\n|  0   0  u33 | | x3 |   | y3 |\n\nLet's perform the LU decomposition:\n\n1. For the first row of U, we have:\nu11 = 3, u12 = 2, u13 = -1\n\n2. For the first column of L, we have:\nl21 = 2/3, l31 = -1/3\n\n3. For the second row of U, we have:\nu22 = -4 - (2/3 * 2) = -4 - 4/3 = -16/3\nu23 = 4 - (2/3 * -1) = 4 + 2/3 = 14/3\n\n4. For the second column of L, we have:\nl32 = (0.5 - (-1/3 * 2)) / (-16/3) = (0.5 + 2/3) / (-16/3) = 7/48\n\n5. For the third row of U, we have:\nu33 = -1 - (-1/3 * -1) - (7/48 * 14/3) = -1 - 1/3 - 7/8 = -8/3\n\nNow we have the L and U matrices:\n\nMatrix L:\n|  1    0    0  |\n| 2/3   1    0  |\n| -1/3 7/48  1  |\n\nMatrix U:\n|  3   2   -1  |\n|  0 -16/3 14/3|\n|  0   0  -8/3 |\n\nNext, we perform forward substitution to solve Ly = b:\n\n1. y1 = 1\n2. y2 = -2 - (2/3 * 1) = -2 - 2/3 = -8/3\n3. y3 = 0.5 - (-1/3 * 1) - (7/48 * -8/3) = 0.5 + 1/3 + 7/18 = 3/2\n\nNow we have the y values:\n\ny1 = 1\ny2 = -8/3\ny3 = 3/2\n\nFinally, we perform backward substitution to solve Ux = y:\n\n1. x3 = (3/2) / (-8/3) = -9/8\n2. x2 = (-8/3 - 14/3 * -9/8) / (-16/3) = 1\n3. x1 = (1 - 2 * 1 + 1 * -9/8) / 3 = 1/8\n\nSo the solutions are:\n\nx1 = 0.13 (rounded to two decimal places)\nx2 = 1.00 (rounded to two decimal places)\nx3 = -1.12 (rounded to two decimal places)"
