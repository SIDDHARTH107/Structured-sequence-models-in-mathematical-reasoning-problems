We have already found AxB and BxA for the given sets A = {1,2} and B = {2,3}:\n\nAxB = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}\nBxA = {(2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)}\n\nAs we can see, AxB and BxA are not equal, since they have different elements. Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to the intersection."
