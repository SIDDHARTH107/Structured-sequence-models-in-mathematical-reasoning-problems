    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, two players are given a sum of money to divide between themselves. Player 1 proposes a split, say (x,y), where x is the amount they will keep and y is the amount they will offer to player 2. Player 2 can either accept or reject the offer. In case of acceptance, the money is divided as proposed. In case of rejection, neither player receives any money.\n\nLet's assume the sum of money is $100. Player 1 proposes (60,40). If Player 2 is considered a \"rational\" player (i.e., only concerned with maximizing their own payoff), what would be the minimum amount offered by Player 1 such that Player 2 would still accept the proposal?",
    "message_2": "If Player 2 is a rational player, they would accept any offer that gives them a positive amount of money, as it is better than getting nothing in case of rejection. Therefore, the minimum amount Player 1 can offer to Player 2 and still have them accept the proposal is $1. In this case, the split would be (99,1)."
