The processing times (in minutes/unit) are given in the matrix below:\n\n| Product | X | Y |\n|---------|---|---|\n| A       | 2 | 3 |\n| B       | 1 | 2 |\n\nMachine X is available for 120 hours and machine Y is available for 100 hours each week. The profit per unit is $10 for product A and $15 for product B. What is the maximum profit the company can make each week?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let's denote the number of units of product A produced as x and the number of units of product B produced as y. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + y <= 120 * 60 (Machine X's available time in minutes)\n3x + 2y <= 100 * 60 (Machine Y's available time in minutes)\nx >= 0\ny >= 0\n\nFirst, we will convert the constraints into inequalities:\n\n2x + y <= 7200\n3x + 2y <= 6000\nx >= 0\ny >= 0\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the inequalities:\n\n1. 2x + y = 7200 => y = -2x + 7200\n2. 3x + 2y = 6000 => y = -1.5x + 3000\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all the inequalities are satisfied. By graphing the inequalities, we find that the feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 3000), (2400, 0), and (1200, 2400).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of the vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 3000) = 10(0) + 15(3000) = $45,000\n3. P(2400, 0) = 10(2400) + 15(0) = $24,000\n4. P(1200, 2400) = 10(1200) + 15(2400) = $48,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $48,000, which occurs when the company produces 1200 units of product A and 2400 units of product B each week."
