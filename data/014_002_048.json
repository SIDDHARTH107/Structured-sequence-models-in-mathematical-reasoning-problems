    "message_2": "To compute the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a prime number (p) and a primitive root modulo p (g). In this case, p = 23.\n\n2. Alice and Bob choose their private keys (a and b). In this case, a = 7 and b = 16.\n\n3. Alice computes her public key (A) using the formula A = g^a mod p. Bob computes his public key (B) using the formula B = g^b mod p.\n\n4. Alice and Bob exchange their public keys.\n\n5. Alice computes the shared secret key (s) using the formula s = B^a mod p. Bob computes the shared secret key (s) using the formula s = A^b mod p.\n\nFirst, we need to find a primitive root modulo 23. Let's use g = 5, which is a primitive root modulo 23.\n\nNow, let's compute the public keys for Alice and Bob:\n\nA = 5^7 mod 23 = 3\nB = 5^16 mod 23 = 19\n\nNow, let's compute the shared secret key for Alice and Bob:\n\ns_Alice = 19^7 mod 23 = 2\ns_Bob = 3^16 mod 23 = 2\n\nThe shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for communication is 2."
