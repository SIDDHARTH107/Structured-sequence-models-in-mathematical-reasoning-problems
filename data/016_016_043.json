    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that is generated by repeatedly replacing a straight line segment with a specific pattern of smaller line segments. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nAfter each iteration, the length of the Gosper curve is multiplied by a factor of (√7). So, after the 5th iteration, the total length of the curve will be:\n\nInitial length × (√7)^5 = 1 × (√7)^5 ≈ 1 × 168.053\n\nThe total length of the Gosper curve after the 5th iteration is approximately 168.053 units."
