    "message_2": "To find the displacement of the particle during the time interval $t=1$ to $t=4$ seconds, we need to find the integral of the velocity function $v(t)$ with respect to time $t$ and then evaluate it at the given time interval.\n\nThe integral of the velocity function $v(t) = 3t^2 + 2t - 1$ with respect to $t$ is:\n\n$$s(t) = \\int v(t) dt = \\int (3t^2 + 2t - 1) dt$$\n\nNow, we integrate each term:\n\n$$s(t) = \\int 3t^2 dt + \\int 2t dt - \\int 1 dt$$\n\n$$s(t) = 3 \\int t^2 dt + 2 \\int t dt - \\int 1 dt$$\n\nUsing the power rule for integration, we get:\n\n$$s(t) = 3\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}t^3 + 2\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}t^2 - t + C$$\n\n$$s(t) = t^3 + t^2 - t + C$$\n\nNow, we need to find the displacement during the time interval $t=1$ to $t=4$ seconds. Displacement is the difference in position, so we will evaluate the integral at $t=4$ and $t=1$ and subtract the results:\n\n$$\\Delta s = s(4) - s(1)$$\n\nFirst, let's find $s(4)$:\n\n$$s(4) = (4)^3 + (4)^2 - (4) + C = 64 + 16 - 4 + C = 76 + C$$\n\nNow, let's find $s(1)$:\n\n$$s(1) = (1)^3 + (1)^2 - (1) + C = 1 + 1 - 1 + C = 1 + C$$\n\nNow, we can find the displacement:\n\n$$\\Delta s = s(4) - s(1) = (76 + C) - (1 + C) = 76 - 1 = 75$$\n\nSo, the displacement of the particle during the time interval $t=1$ to $t=4$ seconds is 75 meters."
