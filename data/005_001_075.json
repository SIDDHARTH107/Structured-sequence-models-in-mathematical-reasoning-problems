    "message_1": "Here's a practice problem for Hypothesis Testing:\n\nA soft drink company claims that their cans contain 12 ounces of soda. A consumer watchdog group suspects that the cans actually contain less than the advertised amount. They take a random sample of 50 cans and measure the amount of soda in each can. The sample mean is 11.9 ounces and the sample standard deviation is 0.5 ounces. \n\nAssuming a significance level of 0.05, test the null hypothesis that the mean amount of soda in the cans is equal to 12 ounces against the alternative hypothesis that it is less than 12 ounces. \n\nWhat is the test statistic, critical value and p-value? Would you reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis?",
    "message_2": "To perform the hypothesis test, we will use a one-sample t-test since we are comparing the sample mean to a known population mean and we have the sample standard deviation.\n\nStep 1: State the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1).\nH0: μ = 12 ounces\nH1: μ < 12 ounces\n\nStep 2: Calculate the test statistic.\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\nt = (11.9 - 12) / (0.5 / sqrt(50))\nt = -0.1 / (0.5 / 7.071)\nt ≈ -1.414\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value.\nSince we are using a one-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and 49 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1), we can find the critical value from the t-distribution table or using software. The critical value is approximately -1.677.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the p-value.\nUsing a t-distribution calculator or software, we can find the p-value associated with our test statistic of -1.414 and 49 degrees of freedom. The p-value is approximately 0.082.\n\nStep 5: Compare the test statistic to the critical value and the p-value to the significance level.\nOur test statistic (-1.414) is greater than the critical value (-1.677), and the p-value (0.082) is greater than the significance level (0.05).\n\nConclusion: We fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to support the claim that the mean amount of soda in the cans is less than 12 ounces at a 0.05 significance level."
