    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of f(x), we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x).\n\nf(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x\n\nTo find the first derivative, we apply the power rule: d/dx (x^n) = nx^(n-1).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^3) + d/dx (5x^2) - d/dx (3x)\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x - 3\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative, f''(x).\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x - 3\n\nTo find the second derivative, we apply the power rule again:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (6x^2) + d/dx (10x) - d/dx (3)\nf''(x) = 12x + 10\n\nNow, we need to solve for x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 12(2) + 10\nf''(2) = 24 + 10\nf''(2) = 34\n\nSo, the second derivative of f(x) at x = 2 is 34."
