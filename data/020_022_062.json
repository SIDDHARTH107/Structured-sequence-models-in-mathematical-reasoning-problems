    "message_1": "A company is trying to maximize its profit by producing two types of products A and B. The profit earned by selling one unit of A and B are $8 and $10 respectively. Each unit of product A requires 1 hour of production time and 2 hours of assembly time, while each unit of product B requires 3 hours of production time and 1 hour of assembly time. The company has a total of 60 hours of production time and 48 hours of assembly time available. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can earn by producing and selling products A and B, and what is the optimal allocation of resources between the two products?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The profit function can be represented as:\n\nProfit = 8x + 10y\n\nThe constraints for production and assembly time are:\n\n1x + 3y ≤ 60 (production time constraint)\n2x + 1y ≤ 48 (assembly time constraint)\n\nWe need to find the values of x and y that maximize the profit function while satisfying the constraints.\n\nFirst, we'll find the corner points of the feasible region by solving the constraint equations:\n\n1. x = 0, y = 0 (origin)\n2. x = 0, 3y = 60 => y = 20\n3. 2x + y = 48, x = 0 => y = 48\n4. 1x + 3y = 60, 2x + y = 48 => x = 12, y = 16\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function at each corner point:\n\n1. Profit(0, 0) = 8(0) + 10(0) = $0\n2. Profit(0, 20) = 8(0) + 10(20) = $200\n3. Profit(0, 48) = 8(0) + 10(48) = $480 (not feasible, as it doesn't satisfy the assembly time constraint)\n4. Profit(12, 16) = 8(12) + 10(16) = $256\n\nThe maximum profit is $256, which occurs when the company produces 12 units of product A and 16 units of product B."
