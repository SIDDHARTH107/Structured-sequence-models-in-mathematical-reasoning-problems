    "message_2": "To form a committee of 4 people with 1 representative from each class, we need to choose 1 freshman, 1 sophomore, and 2 juniors. We can use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose the representatives from each class.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 freshman: C(10,1) = 10! / (1! * (10-1)!) = 10\nNumber of ways to choose 1 sophomore: C(8,1) = 8! / (1! * (8-1)!) = 8\nNumber of ways to choose 2 juniors: C(7,2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!) = 21\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways to choose the representatives from each class to find the total number of ways to form the committee:\n\nTotal number of ways = 10 * 8 * 21 = 1680\n\nSo, there are 1680 ways to form a committee of 4 people with 1 representative from each class."
