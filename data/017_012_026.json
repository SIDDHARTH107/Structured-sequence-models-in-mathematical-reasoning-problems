    "message_2": "To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we will analyze the given presentation and compare it to the properties of the three possible groups of order 16: C16 (cyclic group), D8 (dihedral group), and the non-abelian group.\n\n1. C16: The cyclic group of order 16 has a single generator, say x, and can be represented as {1, x, x^2, ..., x^15}. The presentation of C16 is <x | x^16 = 1>. Since G has two generators (a and b), it cannot be isomorphic to C16.\n\n2. D8: The dihedral group of order 16 has two generators, say r and s, with the presentation <r, s | r^8 = s^2 = 1, sr = r^(-1)s>. Comparing this to the presentation of G, we see that a^8 = r^8 and b^2 = s^2. However, the relation bab = a^3 does not match the relation sr = r^(-1)s. Therefore, G is not isomorphic to D8.\n\n3. Non-abelian group: Since G is not isomorphic to C16 or D8, it must be isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 16. To confirm this, we can check if G is non-abelian. The relation bab = a^3 implies that ba = a^3b, which shows that G is non-abelian since a and b do not commute.\n\nThus, the group G with the presentation <a, b | a^8 = b^2 = 1, bab = a^3> is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 16."
