    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 5 > 13, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality:\n   2x + 5 - 5 > 13 - 5\n   2x > 8\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\n   2x/2 > 8/2\n   x > 4\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x > 4.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a number line and label it with numbers. Be sure to include the number 4.\n2. Place an open circle at 4 on the number line, since the inequality is \"greater than\" and not \"greater than or equal to.\"\n3. Shade the region to the right of the open circle at 4, indicating that all numbers greater than 4 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph of the solution on the number line will have an open circle at 4 and the region to the right of the open circle shaded."
