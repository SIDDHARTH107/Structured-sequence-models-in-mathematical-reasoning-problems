    "message_1": "A group of students were asked to take a math test using one of three different pencils (A, B, or C). The scores for each pencil type are shown below:\n\nPencil A: 85, 75, 90, 88, 92 \nPencil B: 80, 82, 78, 85, 88 \nPencil C: 92, 90, 94, 88, 85 \n\nIs there any significant difference in the scores obtained using each pencil type? Use ANOVA to test the hypothesis at the 5% significance level.",
    "message_2": "To perform an ANOVA test, we first need to calculate the means, sum of squares, and other necessary values. Let's start with the means:\n\nPencil A mean: (85 + 75 + 90 + 88 + 92) / 5 = 86\nPencil B mean: (80 + 82 + 78 + 85 + 88) / 5 = 82.6\nPencil C mean: (92 + 90 + 94 + 88 + 85) / 5 = 89.8\n\nGrand mean: (86 + 82.6 + 89.8) / 3 = 86.1333\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of squares:\n\nSum of squares between groups (SSB):\nSSB = 5 * ( (86 - 86.1333)^2 + (82.6 - 86.1333)^2 + (89.8 - 86.1333)^2 ) = 214.0665\n\nSum of squares within groups (SSW):\nFor Pencil A: (85 - 86)^2 + (75 - 86)^2 + (90 - 86)^2 + (88 - 86)^2 + (92 - 86)^2 = 366\nFor Pencil B: (80 - 82.6)^2 + (82 - 82.6)^2 + (78 - 82.6)^2 + (85 - 82.6)^2 + (88 - 82.6)^2 = 84.8\nFor Pencil C: (92 - 89.8)^2 + (90 - 89.8)^2 + (94 - 89.8)^2 + (88 - 89.8)^2 + (85 - 89.8)^2 = 84.8\nSSW = 366 + 84.8 + 84.8 = 535.6\n\nNow, we can calculate the mean squares:\n\nMean square between groups (MSB) = SSB / (k - 1) = 214.0665 / (3 - 1) = 107.03325\nMean square within groups (MSW) = SSW / (N - k) = 535.6 / (15 - 3) = 44.6333\n\nFinally, we can calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW = 107.03325 / 44.6333 = 2.3987\n\nNow, we need to compare the F-statistic with the critical value from the F-distribution table. For a 5% significance level, and degrees of freedom (df1 = k - 1 = 2, df2 = N - k = 12):\n\nF_critical â‰ˆ 3.89\n\nSince our F-statistic (2.3987) is less than the critical value (3.89), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is no significant difference in the scores obtained using each pencil type at the 5% significance level."
