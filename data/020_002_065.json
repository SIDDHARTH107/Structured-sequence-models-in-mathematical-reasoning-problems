    "message_1": "Sure, here is a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA manufacturing company produces two products A and B. The profit per unit for product A is $5 and for product B is $8. The production process takes two resources R1 and R2. The total availability of resources R1 and R2 are 3000 and 4000 respectively. The production of product A requires 3 units of resource R1 and 4 units of resource R2, and the production of product B requires 2 units of resource R1 and 5 units of resource R2.\n\nThe company wants to maximize its profit while utilizing its resources efficiently. What should be the production quantities of product A and B to achieve the maximum profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 8y\n\nThe constraints are given by the resource limitations:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 3000 (Resource R1 constraint)\n4x + 5y ≤ 4000 (Resource R2 constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraints)\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 2y = 3000\n   y = (3000 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. 4x + 5y = 4000\n   y = (4000 - 4x) / 5\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. By graphing the constraints, we find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nA(0, 0)\nB(0, 800)\nC(600, 600)\nD(1000, 0)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0\nP(B) = 5(0) + 8(800) = 6400\nP(C) = 5(600) + 8(600) = 7800\nP(D) = 5(1000) + 8(0) = 5000\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at point C with a profit of $7800. Therefore, the company should produce 600 units of product A and 600 units of product B to maximize its profit."
