    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms. Let the surface be given by the function F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - 4 = 0. We can write this as a level set function, G(x, y, z) = (x, y, z) such that F(x, y, z) = 0.\n\nNow, let's find the gradient of F, which is the normal vector N to the surface at the point (1, 1, 2):\n\n∇F = (dF/dx, dF/dy, dF/dz) = (2x, 2y, -2z)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), the gradient is:\n\n∇F(1, 1, 2) = (2, 2, -4)\n\nNow, let's find the first fundamental form, which is given by the matrix:\n\nI = [dot(N_x, N_x)  dot(N_x, N_y);\n     dot(N_y, N_x)  dot(N_y, N_y)]\n\nwhere N_x and N_y are the partial derivatives of N with respect to x and y, respectively.\n\nN_x = (d^2F/dx^2, d^2F/dxdy, d^2F/dxdz) = (2, 0, 0)\nN_y = (d^2F/dydx, d^2F/dy^2, d^2F/dydz) = (0, 2, 0)\n\nNow, let's compute the first fundamental form:\n\nI = [dot(N_x, N_x)  dot(N_x, N_y);\n     dot(N_y, N_x)  dot(N_y, N_y)]\n\nI = [dot((2, 0, 0), (2, 0, 0))  dot((2, 0, 0), (0, 2, 0));\n     dot((0, 2, 0), (2, 0, 0))  dot((0, 2, 0), (0, 2, 0))]\n\nI = [4  0;\n     0  4]\n\nNext, let's find the second fundamental form, which is given by the matrix:\n\nII = [-dot(N_x, N_z)  -dot(N_x, N_w);\n      -dot(N_y, N_z)  -dot(N_y, N_w)]\n\nwhere N_z and N_w are the partial derivatives of N with respect to z and w, respectively.\n\nN_z = (d^2F/dzdx, d^2F/dzdy, d^2F/dz^2) = (0, 0, -2)\nN_w = (0, 0, 0) (since F does not depend on w)\n\nNow, let's compute the second fundamental form:\n\nII = [-dot(N_x, N_z)  -dot(N_x, N_w);\n      -dot(N_y, N_z)  -dot(N_y, N_w)]\n\nII = [-dot((2, 0, 0), (0, 0, -2))  -dot((2, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0));\n      -dot((0, 2, 0), (0, 0, -2))  -dot((0, 2, 0), (0, 0, 0))]\n\nII = [0  0;\n      0  0]\n\nFinally, let's find the mean curvature H, which is given by the formula:\n\nH = (1/2) * trace(I^(-1) * II)\n\nSince II is a zero matrix, the mean curvature H will be zero:\n\nH = (1/2) * trace(I^(-1) * II) = (1/2) * trace(0) = 0\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1, 1, 2) is 0."
