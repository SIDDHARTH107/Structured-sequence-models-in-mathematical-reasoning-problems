They have 5 items to choose from, which have weights of 2kg, 3kg, 4kg, 5kg, and 6kg respectively. Assuming the backpack cannot be partially filled with items, what is the maximum weight the student can pack in their backpack?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the weight in the backpack without exceeding the 10kg limit, the student should choose the items with weights 2kg, 3kg, and 5kg. This will result in a total weight of 2kg + 3kg + 5kg = 10kg."
