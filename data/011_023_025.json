    "message_1": "A school wants to set up a committee of 7 students to plan a math competition. However, the school must ensure that no two students who dislike each other will be on the same committee. If there are 9 pairs of students who dislike each other, what is the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph where each student represents a vertex and the edges represent the pairs of students who dislike each other?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of graph theory and graph coloring. The minimum number of colors needed to color a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is called the chromatic number of the graph.\n\nSince there are 9 pairs of students who dislike each other, we need to find a graph with 9 edges where the chromatic number is minimized. The worst-case scenario is when the graph is a complete graph, meaning every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. In this case, the chromatic number is equal to the number of vertices.\n\nA complete graph with 4 vertices (K4) has 6 edges, and a complete graph with 5 vertices (K5) has 10 edges. Since we have 9 pairs of students who dislike each other, the graph must have at least 5 vertices. However, we can try to find a graph with 5 vertices and 9 edges that is not a complete graph, which would require fewer colors.\n\nConsider a graph with 5 vertices (A, B, C, D, and E) and the following edges: AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, and CE. This graph has 9 edges, and each vertex is connected to every other vertex except for one. We can color this graph using the following scheme:\n\n1. Color A with color 1.\n2. Color B with color 2.\n3. Color C with color 3.\n4. Color D with color 1 (since it is not connected to A).\n5. Color E with color 2 (since it is not connected to B).\n\nThis coloring scheme ensures that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, and it uses only 3 colors. Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph is 3."
