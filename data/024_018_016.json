    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,1), we first need to compute the first and second partial derivatives of the given equation with respect to x and y.\n\nThe given equation is:\nz = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy\n\nFirst partial derivatives:\n∂z/∂x = 3x^2 - 3y\n∂z/∂y = 3y^2 - 3x\n\nSecond partial derivatives:\n∂²z/∂x² = 6x\n∂²z/∂y² = 6y\n∂²z/∂x∂y = -3\n\nNow, we evaluate these derivatives at the point (1,1,1):\n∂z/∂x(1,1,1) = 0\n∂z/∂y(1,1,1) = 0\n∂²z/∂x²(1,1,1) = 6\n∂²z/∂y²(1,1,1) = 6\n∂²z/∂x∂y(1,1,1) = -3\n\nNext, we compute the Gaussian curvature (K) using the formula:\n\nK = ( ∂²z/∂x² * ∂²z/∂y² - (∂²z/∂x∂y)^2 ) / (1 + (∂z/∂x)^2 + (∂z/∂y)^2)^2\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nK = (6 * 6 - (-3)^2) / (1 + 0^2 + 0^2)^2\nK = (36 - 9) / 1\nK = 27\n\nThus, the sectional curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,1) is 27."
