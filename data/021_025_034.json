    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit earned per unit of product A is $5 and for product B, it is $10. To meet the increasing demand, the company wants to maximize profit by producing at least 120 units of product A and 80 units of product B. The average time required to produce unit A and unit B are 25 minutes and 30 minutes respectively. If the company has 600 minutes for production, how many units of product A and B should be produced to maximize the profit using whale optimization algorithm?",
    "message_2": "The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of humpback whales. It is used to solve optimization problems, but it is not suitable for solving this specific problem directly. Instead, we can solve this problem using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 10y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. x >= 120 (at least 120 units of product A)\n2. y >= 80 (at least 80 units of product B)\n3. 25x + 30y <= 600 (total production time)\n\nFirst, we can find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph. Then, we can find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the profit function at each vertex. The vertex with the highest profit value will be the optimal solution.\n\nVertices of the feasible region:\n1. (120, 80)\n2. (120, 100/3) - Intersection of 25x + 30y = 600 and x = 120\n3. (8, 100/3) - Intersection of 25x + 30y = 600 and y = 80\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(120, 80) = 5(120) + 10(80) = 600 + 800 = 1400\nP(120, 100/3) = 5(120) + 10(100/3) = 600 + 1000/3 ≈ 1333.33\nP(8, 100/3) = 5(8) + 10(100/3) = 40 + 1000/3 ≈ 373.33\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at the vertex (120, 80) with a profit of $1400. Therefore, the company should produce 120 units of product A and 80 units of product B to maximize the profit."
