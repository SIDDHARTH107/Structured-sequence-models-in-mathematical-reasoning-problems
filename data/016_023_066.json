    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Vicsek fractal, the square is divided into 9 equal squares, and the central one is removed, leaving N = 5 self-similar pieces. The scaling factor s is 3 since each side of the smaller squares is 1/3 the length of the original square's side.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.46497\n\nTherefore, the exact Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is approximately 1.46497."
