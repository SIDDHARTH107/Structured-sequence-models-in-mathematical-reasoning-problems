    "message_1": "A company produces two products: Product A and Product B. It takes 2 hours and 3 hours to produce one unit of Product A and B respectively. The revenue generated from the sale of one unit of Product A and B is $50 and $80 respectively. The company has 8 hours of production time available each day. What is the optimal number of units of Product A and B the company should produce to maximize their revenue?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe total production time constraint is:\n2x + 3y ≤ 8\n\nThe revenue function to maximize is:\nR(x, y) = 50x + 80y\n\nTo find the optimal number of units of Product A and B, we need to find the integer values of x and y that satisfy the constraint and maximize the revenue function.\n\nFirst, let's find the possible values of x and y that satisfy the constraint:\n\nIf x = 0:\n2(0) + 3y ≤ 8\ny ≤ 8/3\nThe maximum integer value for y is 2.\n\nIf y = 0:\n2x + 3(0) ≤ 8\nx ≤ 4\nThe maximum integer value for x is 4.\n\nNow, let's check the revenue for each combination of x and y:\n\n1. x = 0, y = 2:\nR(0, 2) = 50(0) + 80(2) = $160\n\n2. x = 4, y = 0:\nR(4, 0) = 50(4) + 80(0) = $200\n\n3. x = 2, y = 1:\n2x + 3y = 2(2) + 3(1) = 7, which is less than or equal to 8, so this combination is valid.\nR(2, 1) = 50(2) + 80(1) = $180\n\nComparing the revenues for each combination, the maximum revenue is $200 when producing 4 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B. Therefore, the company should produce 4 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B to maximize their revenue."
