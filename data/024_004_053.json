    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 - y^2 at the point (1, 1, 0), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parametrize the surface as follows:\nS(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - v^2)\n\nNow, we find the first partial derivatives:\nS_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nS_v = (0, 1, -2v)\n\nNext, we find the second partial derivatives:\nS_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nS_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nS_vv = (0, 0, -2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\nE = <S_u, S_u> = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <S_u, S_v> = 0\nG = <S_v, S_v> = 1 + 4v^2\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\ne = <S_uu, N> = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nf = <S_uv, N> = 0\ng = <S_vv, N> = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface, which is given by the cross product of S_u and S_v, normalized:\nN = (S_u × S_v) / ||S_u × S_v|| = (-2u, -2v, 1) / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature H using the formula:\nH = (eG - 2fF + gE) / (2(EG - F^2))\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 0), we have u = 1 and v = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 0\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\ne = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2) = 2 / 3\nf = 0\ng = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2) = -2 / 3\n\nNow, we can compute the mean curvature H:\nH = (eG - 2fF + gE) / (2(EG - F^2)) = (2/3 * 5 - 0 + (-2/3) * 5) / (2(5 * 5 - 0^2)) = (10/3 - 10/3) / 50 = 0 / 50 = 0\n\nThe mean curvature at the point (1, 1, 0) on the surface z = x^2 - y^2 is 0."
