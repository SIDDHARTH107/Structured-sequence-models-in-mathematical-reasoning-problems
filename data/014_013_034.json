    "message_1": "Sure. \n\nIn the Hill Cipher encryption algorithm, the key matrix K is a 3x3 matrix with integer values. Encrypt the message \"MATH\" using the key matrix K = [5 8 11; 7 9 2; 6 4 3].",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH\" using the Hill Cipher with the given key matrix K, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the message into numerical values using the alphabetical index (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).\n2. Break the message into blocks of size 3 (since K is a 3x3 matrix). If the message length is not a multiple of 3, we can pad it with a filler letter, such as \"X\".\n3. Multiply each block by the key matrix K modulo 26.\n4. Convert the resulting numerical values back into letters to obtain the encrypted message.\n\nLet's perform these steps for the message \"MATH\":\n\n1. Convert \"MATH\" into numerical values: M=12, A=0, T=19, H=7. So, we have the vector [12, 0, 19, 7].\n2. Break the message into blocks of size 3: [12, 0, 19] and [7]. We need to pad the second block with \"X\" (X=23): [7, 23].\n3. Multiply each block by the key matrix K modulo 26:\n\n   For the first block [12, 0, 19]:\n   [5  8 11]   [12]   [ 12*5 + 0*8 + 19*11]   [ 227]   [ 3]\n   [7  9  2] * [ 0] = [ 12*7 + 0*9 + 19*2 ] = [  94] = [16]\n   [6  4  3]   [19]   [ 12*6 + 0*4 + 19*3 ] = [  99] = [21]\n   (All calculations are done modulo 26)\n\n   For the second block [7, 23]:\n   We need to pad this block with another letter to make it a 3-element block. Let's pad it with \"X\" (X=23): [7, 23, 23].\n   [5  8 11]   [ 7]   [  7*5 + 23*8 + 23*11]   [ 526]   [ 0]\n   [7  9  2] * [23] = [  7*7 + 23*9 + 23*2 ] = [  14] = [14]\n   [6  4  3]   [23]   [  7*6 + 23*4 + 23*3 ] = [  21] = [21]\n   (All calculations are done modulo 26)\n\n4. Convert the resulting numerical values back into letters: [3, 16, 21, 0, 14, 21] corresponds to \"DQVAOU\".\n\nSo, the encrypted message for \"MATH\" using the given key matrix K is \"DQVAOU\"."
