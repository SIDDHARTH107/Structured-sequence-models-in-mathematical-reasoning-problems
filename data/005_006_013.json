    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution. In this case, we have a sample size of 36 adult males.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (also known as the standard error). The formula for the standard error is:\n\nStandard Error (SE) = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n\nSE = 6 cm / √36 = 6 cm / 6 = 1 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range of heights (174 cm and 176 cm). The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = (X - μ) / SE\n\nwhere X is the value of interest, μ is the population mean, and SE is the standard error.\n\nFor 174 cm:\n\nz1 = (174 - 175) / 1 = -1\n\nFor 176 cm:\n\nz2 = (176 - 175) / 1 = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the average height of a sample of 36 adult males is between these z-scores. We can use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nFor z1 = -1, the probability is 0.1587 (or 15.87%).\nFor z2 = 1, the probability is 0.8413 (or 84.13%).\n\nTo find the probability that the average height is between 174 cm and 176 cm, we need to find the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(174 cm < X < 176 cm) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826\n\nSo, the probability that the average height of a sample of 36 adult males is between 174 cm and 176 cm is approximately 0.6826, or 68.26%."
