    "message_2": "To find the length of the sides of the right-angled triangle, we can use the sine and cosine functions of the 30° angle.\n\nLet's denote the side opposite to the 30° angle as \"a\" and the adjacent side as \"b\".\n\nWe know that:\n\nsin(30°) = a / 10\ncos(30°) = b / 10\n\nWe also know that sin(30°) = 1/2 and cos(30°) = √3/2.\n\nNow, we can solve for a and b:\n\na / 10 = 1/2\na = 10 * (1/2)\na = 5 cm\n\nb / 10 = √3/2\nb = 10 * (√3/2)\nb = 5√3 cm\n\nSo, the side opposite to the 30° angle (a) is 5 cm, and the adjacent side (b) is 5√3 cm."
