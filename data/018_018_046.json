    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it consists of elements that are unique to each set.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nSet A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nSet B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nFirst, let's find the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {4, 5}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference of sets A and B (A Δ B):\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} - {4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of sets A and B is:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference is commutative. This means that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince the union and intersection of sets are commutative (A ∪ B = B ∪ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A), we can rewrite this as:\n\nB Δ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nComparing this with the expression for A Δ B:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nWe can see that A Δ B = B Δ A, which proves that the symmetric difference is commutative."
