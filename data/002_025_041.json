    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the length of two sides is 8 cm each. The height from the apex to the base measures 6 cm. What is the length of the third side in centimeters?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the isosceles triangle as ABC, where A is the apex and B and C are the base vertices. Since the triangle is isosceles, AB = AC = 8 cm. Let's denote the height from A to the base BC as AD, where D is the point on the base BC. Since AD is the height, angle BAD and angle CAD are right angles.\n\nNow, we have two right triangles ABD and ADC. In both triangles, AD = 6 cm. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BD and CD.\n\nIn triangle ABD,\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\n8^2 = 6^2 + BD^2\n64 = 36 + BD^2\nBD^2 = 64 - 36\nBD^2 = 28\nBD = √28\n\nSimilarly, in triangle ADC,\nAC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2\n8^2 = 6^2 + CD^2\n64 = 36 + CD^2\nCD^2 = 64 - 36\nCD^2 = 28\nCD = √28\n\nSince BD and CD are the two halves of the base BC, we can find the length of the third side (BC) by adding BD and CD.\n\nBC = BD + CD\nBC = √28 + √28\nBC = 2√28\n\nSo, the length of the third side (BC) is 2√28 cm."
