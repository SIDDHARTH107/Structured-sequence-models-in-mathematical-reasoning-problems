    "message_2": "To find the wavelength and frequency of the wave, we need to analyze the given equation:\n\n$y = 0.05\\sin(2\\pi(0.3t - 2x))$\n\nThis equation is in the form of a sinusoidal function:\n\n$y = A\\sin(2\\pi(ft - kx))$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude, $f$ is the frequency, and $k$ is the wave number. \n\nComparing the given equation with the sinusoidal function, we can identify the values of $f$ and $k$:\n\n$f = 0.3$ (Hz) - This is the frequency of the wave.\n$k = 2$ (m⁻¹) - This is the wave number.\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength using the relationship between wave number and wavelength:\n\n$k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$\n\nSolving for the wavelength ($\\lambda$):\n\n$\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{k} = \\frac{2\\pi}{2} = \\pi$ (m)\n\nSo, the wavelength of the wave is $\\pi$ meters, and the frequency is $0.3$ Hz."
