    "message_2": "To identify the cut vertices and bridges in the graph G, we first need to understand the definitions of these terms:\n\n- A cut vertex (or articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n- A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nNow, let's analyze the graph G:\n\n1. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2, 5, and 6. If we remove vertex 1, the graph remains connected, so vertex 1 is not a cut vertex.\n2. Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1, 3, and 6. If we remove vertex 2, the graph is split into two connected components: {1, 5, 6} and {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}. So, vertex 2 is a cut vertex.\n3. Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 2, 4, and 7. If we remove vertex 3, the graph is split into two connected components: {1, 2, 5, 6} and {4, 7, 8, 9}. So, vertex 3 is a cut vertex.\n4. Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 3 and 5. If we remove vertex 4, the graph remains connected, so vertex 4 is not a cut vertex.\n5. Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1, 4, and 6. If we remove vertex 5, the graph remains connected, so vertex 5 is not a cut vertex.\n6. Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 1, 2, 5, and 7. If we remove vertex 6, the graph remains connected, so vertex 6 is not a cut vertex.\n7. Vertex 7 is connected to vertices 3, 6, and 8. If we remove vertex 7, the graph remains connected, so vertex 7 is not a cut vertex.\n8. Vertex 8 is connected to vertices 7 and 9. If we remove vertex 8, the graph is split into two connected components: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and {9}. So, vertex 8 is a cut vertex.\n9. Vertex 9 is connected to vertex 8. If we remove vertex 9, the graph remains connected, so vertex 9 is not a cut vertex.\n\nCut vertices: {2, 3, 8}\n\nNow, let's identify the bridges:\n\n1. Edge (1,2) is not a bridge, as its removal does not increase the number of connected components.\n2. Edge (2,3) is a bridge, as its removal splits the graph into two connected components.\n3. Edge (3,4) is not a bridge, as its removal does not increase the number of connected components.\n4. Edge (4,5) is not a bridge, as its removal does not increase the number of connected components.\n5. Edge (5,6) is not a bridge, as its removal does not increase the number of connected components.\n6. Edge (6,7) is not a bridge, as its removal does not increase the number of connected components.\n7. Edge (7,8) is not a bridge, as its removal does not increase the number of connected components.\n8. Edge (8,9) is a bridge, as its removal splits the graph into two connected components.\n9. Edge (1,5) is not a bridge, as its removal does not increase the number of connected components.\n10. Edge (1,6) is not a bridge, as its removal does not increase the number of connected components.\n11. Edge (2,6) is not a bridge, as its removal does not increase the number of connected components.\n12. Edge (3,7) is not a bridge, as its removal does not increase the number of connected components.\n\nBridges: {(2,3), (8,9)}\n\nIn summary, the cut vertices in the graph G are {2, 3, 8}, and the bridges are {(2,3), (8,9)}."
