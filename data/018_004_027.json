The universal set in this case is the set of all numbers less than 10, which is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n\nX = A' (complement of A) = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nY = B' (complement of B) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of X and Y:\n\nX ∩ Y = { }\n\nThere are no elements in common between X and Y, so the intersection is an empty set.\n\nTherefore, |X ∩ Y| = 0."
