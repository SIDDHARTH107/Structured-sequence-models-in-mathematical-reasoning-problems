    "message_2": "First, we want to isolate the square root term. To do this, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n$\\sqrt{4x+5} = 8 - 3$\n\n$\\sqrt{4x+5} = 5$\n\nNow, we want to get rid of the square root. We can do this by squaring both sides of the equation:\n\n$(\\sqrt{4x+5})^2 = 5^2$\n\n$4x + 5 = 25$\n\nNext, we want to solve for x. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n$4x = 25 - 5$\n\n$4x = 20$\n\nFinally, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find the value of x:\n\n$x = \\frac{20}{4}$\n\n$x = 5$\n\nSo, the solution for x is 5."
