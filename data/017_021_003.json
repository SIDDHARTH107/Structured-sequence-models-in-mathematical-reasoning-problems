    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we first find the prime factorization of 48, which is 2^4 * 3^1. Now, we use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is given by the product of one more than each of the prime factors in the factorization.\n\nIn this case, the formula is (4+1)(1+1) = 5 * 2 = 10. However, this formula gives us an upper bound on the number of groups, so there might be fewer than 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 48.\n\nTo find the actual number of non-isomorphic groups, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the possible numbers of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor p.\n2. Determine the possible isomorphism types of the Sylow p-subgroups.\n3. Combine the isomorphism types of the Sylow p-subgroups to form groups of order 48.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities are 1 and 3. If there is only 1 Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be normal. The possible isomorphism types for a group of order 16 are Z_16, Z_8 x Z_2, Z_4 x Z_4, Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2, and Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_4.\n\nFor the prime factor 3, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility is 1, so there is a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be isomorphic to Z_3.\n\nNow we combine the isomorphism types of the Sylow p-subgroups to form groups of order 48. Since the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, we can take the direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. This gives us the following groups:\n\n1. Z_16 x Z_3\n2. Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_3\n3. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_3\n4. Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3\n5. Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_4 x Z_3\n\nIf there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, they cannot all be normal, so we need to consider semidirect products. However, in this case, there are no nontrivial actions of Z_3 on any of the Sylow 2-subgroups, so there are no additional groups to consider.\n\nThus, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 48:\n\n1. Z_16 x Z_3\n2. Z_8 x Z_2 x Z_3\n3. Z_4 x Z_4 x Z_3\n4. Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_3\n5. Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_4 x Z_3"
