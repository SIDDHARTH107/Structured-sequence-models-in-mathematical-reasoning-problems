    "message_2": "In the given higher-order logic statement, we cannot directly find a specific value for the variable x. The statement asserts the existence of functions f, g, and h with certain properties, but it does not provide enough information to determine a unique value for x. \n\nThe statement says that there exists a function f such that for all functions g, there exists a function h with the following properties:\n\n1. For all x, f(g(x)) = h(x)\n2. h(3) = 5\n3. f(4) = x\n\nSince we don't have specific definitions for the functions f, g, and h, we cannot determine a specific value for x. The statement only asserts the existence of such functions and relationships, but it does not uniquely define them."
