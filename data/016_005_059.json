    "message_1": "How many subsets are there in the Cantor set after the $n^{th}$ iteration?\n\nFor instance, after the first iteration, the Cantor set has 2 subsets (the interval removed and the remaining interval). After the second iteration, there are four subsets (three disjoint intervals and the middle point). After the third iteration, there are eight subsets, and so on.",
    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each interval. After the first iteration, there are 2 disjoint intervals. After the second iteration, there are 2^2 = 4 disjoint intervals, and after the third iteration, there are 2^3 = 8 disjoint intervals. In general, after the n-th iteration, there are 2^n disjoint intervals in the Cantor set.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of subsets, not the number of disjoint intervals. A subset is a collection of elements from a set, and the number of subsets of a set with n elements is given by the formula 2^n.\n\nSince there are 2^n disjoint intervals in the Cantor set after the n-th iteration, there are 2^(2^n) subsets in the Cantor set after the n-th iteration."
