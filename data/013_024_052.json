    "message_1": "In a group of five volunteers, each volunteer must contribute a certain amount of money towards a charity fundraiser. However, if one of the volunteers decides not to contribute, the fundraiser will fail and all contributions will be lost. Each volunteer has a 50/50 chance of deciding to contribute or not, and if two or more volunteers decide not to contribute, then the fundraiser will fail. \n\nAssuming each volunteer has an equal willingness to contribute, what is the probability that the fundraiser will be successful?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the fundraiser will be successful, we need to consider the cases where either all five volunteers contribute or only one volunteer does not contribute.\n\n1. All five volunteers contribute: The probability of each volunteer contributing is 1/2. So, the probability of all five contributing is (1/2)^5 = 1/32.\n\n2. Only one volunteer does not contribute: There are 5 ways to choose which volunteer does not contribute (5C1). The probability of the chosen volunteer not contributing is 1/2, and the probability of the other four contributing is (1/2)^4 = 1/16. So, the probability of only one volunteer not contributing is 5C1 * (1/2)^5 = 5 * 1/32 = 5/32.\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of these two cases to find the total probability of the fundraiser being successful:\n\nP(success) = P(all five contribute) + P(only one does not contribute) = 1/32 + 5/32 = 6/32 = 3/16.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the fundraiser will be successful is 3/16 or 18.75%."
