Determine a bijective analytic function which maps $D$ onto the unit disk $U=\\{z:|z|<1\\}$, and such that $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)>0$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Riemann Mapping Theorem, which states that for any simply connected region D in the complex plane that is not the whole plane, there exists a unique bijective analytic function f that maps D onto the unit disk U, such that f(0) = 0 and f'(0) > 0.\n\nSince D is simply connected and not the whole plane, we can apply the Riemann Mapping Theorem. Let f be the unique bijective analytic function that maps D onto the unit disk U, with f(0) = 0 and f'(0) > 0.\n\nWe have found the function f that satisfies the given conditions. However, we cannot provide an explicit formula for f, as it depends on the specific region D. The Riemann Mapping Theorem guarantees the existence and uniqueness of such a function, but it does not provide a general formula for it."
