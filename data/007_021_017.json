    "message_2": "Pollard's Rho algorithm is an efficient probabilistic method for finding a non-trivial factor of a composite number. Here, we will use Pollard's Rho algorithm to find a factor of the number 135259.\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) modulo n, where n is the number we want to factorize. A common choice is f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod n.\n\n2. Initialize two variables x and y with random values, usually x = y = 2.\n\n3. Iterate the following steps until a non-trivial factor is found:\n   a. Update x using the function f(x): x = f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod n\n   b. Update y using the function f(f(y)): y = f(f(y)) = (y^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod n\n   c. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between x and y and the number n: d = GCD(|x - y|, n)\n\n   If d is not equal to 1 and not equal to n, then d is a non-trivial factor of n.\n\nLet's apply Pollard's Rho algorithm to find a factor of 135259:\n\n1. Choose f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 135259.\n\n2. Initialize x = 2 and y = 2.\n\n3. Iterate the following steps:\n\n   a. x = (2^2 + 1) mod 135259 = 5\n   b. y = (((2^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod 135259 = 26\n   c. d = GCD(|5 - 26|, 135259) = GCD(21, 135259) = 1\n\nSince d = 1, we continue the iteration:\n\n   a. x = (5^2 + 1) mod 135259 = 26\n   b. y = (((26^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod 135259 = 677\n   c. d = GCD(|26 - 677|, 135259) = GCD(651, 135259) = 1\n\nContinue the iteration:\n\n   a. x = (26^2 + 1) mod 135259 = 677\n   b. y = (((677^2 + 1)^2 + 1) mod 135259 = 16928\n   c. d = GCD(|677 - 16928|, 135259) = GCD(16251, 135259) = 3\n\nNow, d = 3, which is a non-trivial factor of 135259. So, we have found a factorization of 135259 as 3 * 45086."
