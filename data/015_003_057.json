    "message_2": "To find the values of r where the system transitions from a single stable equilibrium point to two stable equilibrium points, we need to analyze the stability of the fixed points of the logistic map.\n\nFirst, let's find the fixed points by setting x(n+1) = x(n) = x:\n\nx = r * x * (1 - x)\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\nx - r * x^2 = 0\n\nx(1 - r * x) = 0\n\nThe fixed points are x = 0 and x = 1 - 1/r.\n\nNext, we need to analyze the stability of these fixed points. To do this, we'll find the derivative of the logistic map with respect to x(n):\n\ndx(n+1)/dx(n) = r - 2 * r * x(n)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the derivative at each fixed point:\n\n1. At x = 0:\ndx(n+1)/dx(n) = r\n\n2. At x = 1 - 1/r:\ndx(n+1)/dx(n) = r - 2 * r * (1 - 1/r) = 2 - r\n\nFor a fixed point to be stable, the absolute value of the derivative must be less than 1. So, we have two conditions:\n\n1. |r| < 1 for x = 0\n2. |2 - r| < 1 for x = 1 - 1/r\n\nThe first condition is always true for r in the interval (0, 1). The second condition is true for r in the interval (1, 3). The system transitions from a single stable equilibrium point to two stable equilibrium points when both conditions are true, which occurs when r = 1.\n\nSo, the value of r where the system transitions from a single stable equilibrium point to two stable equilibrium points is r = 1."
