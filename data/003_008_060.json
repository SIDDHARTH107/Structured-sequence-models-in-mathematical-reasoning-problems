    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we first need to find the lengths of the other two sides. We can use the sine and cosine functions to do this.\n\nLet's denote the side opposite the 30-degree angle as \"a\" and the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle as \"b\". The hypotenuse is 13 cm.\n\nUsing the sine function:\nsin(30) = a / 13\n\nsin(30) = 1/2 (since sine of 30 degrees is 0.5)\nSo, a = 13 * 1/2 = 6.5 cm\n\nUsing the cosine function:\ncos(30) = b / 13\n\ncos(30) = √3/2 (since cosine of 30 degrees is approximately 0.866)\nSo, b = 13 * √3/2 ≈ 11.258 cm\n\nNow that we have the lengths of the other two sides, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * a * b\nArea = (1/2) * 6.5 * 11.258\nArea ≈ 36.612 cm²\n\nThe area of the triangle is approximately 36.612 square centimeters."
