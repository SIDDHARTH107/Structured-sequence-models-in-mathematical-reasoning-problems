    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext for the message \"HELLO\" using the one-time pad encryption with the key \"WLMYK\", we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Convert the message and the key to their numerical equivalents using the given mapping (A=0, B=1, C=2, ...).\n   HELLO -> 7 4 11 11 14\n   WLMYK -> 22 11 12 24 10\n\n2. Add the numerical equivalents of the message and the key element-wise modulo 26 (since there are 26 letters in the alphabet).\n   (7+22) mod 26 = 3\n   (4+11) mod 26 = 15\n   (11+12) mod 26 = 23\n   (11+24) mod 26 = 9\n   (14+10) mod 26 = 24\n\n3. Convert the resulting numbers back to letters using the given mapping.\n   3 15 23 9 24 -> D P X J Y\n\nSo, the ciphertext for the message \"HELLO\" using the one-time pad encryption with the key \"WLMYK\" is \"DPXJY\"."
