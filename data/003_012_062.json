    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the hill as H, the distance between the base of the hill and the base of the flag post as D, and the distance between the top of the hill and the top of the flag post as L.\n\nFrom the base of the hill, we can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation, the height of the flag post, and the distance D:\n\ntan(35) = (H + 9) / D\n\nFrom the top of the hill, we can use the tangent function to relate the angle of depression, the height of the hill, and the distance L:\n\ntan(25) = H / L\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate D, H, and L:\n\nD^2 + H^2 = L^2\n\nNow we have a system of three equations with three unknowns:\n\n1) tan(35) = (H + 9) / D\n2) tan(25) = H / L\n3) D^2 + H^2 = L^2\n\nWe can solve this system of equations step by step:\n\nFirst, we can solve equation 1 for D:\n\nD = (H + 9) / tan(35)\n\nNext, we can solve equation 2 for L:\n\nL = H / tan(25)\n\nNow we can substitute these expressions for D and L into equation 3:\n\n((H + 9) / tan(35))^2 + H^2 = (H / tan(25))^2\n\nNow we can solve for H:\n\nH^2 + 18H / tan(35) + 81 / tan^2(35) = H^2 / tan^2(25)\n\nTo eliminate the fractions, we can multiply both sides by tan^2(35) * tan^2(25):\n\nH^2 * tan^2(25) + 18H * tan(25) * tan^2(35) + 81 * tan^2(25) = H^2 * tan^2(35)\n\nNow we can solve for H:\n\nH^2 * (tan^2(25) - tan^2(35)) = -18H * tan(25) * tan^2(35) - 81 * tan^2(25)\n\nH^2 = (18H * tan(25) * tan^2(35) + 81 * tan^2(25)) / (tan^2(35) - tan^2(25))\n\nH = sqrt((18H * tan(25) * tan^2(35) + 81 * tan^2(25)) / (tan^2(35) - tan^2(25)))\n\nWe can use a calculator to find the numerical values of the tangent functions:\n\ntan(25) ≈ 0.4663\ntan(35) ≈ 0.7002\n\nPlugging these values into the equation for H:\n\nH = sqrt((18H * 0.4663 * 0.7002^2 + 81 * 0.4663^2) / (0.7002^2 - 0.4663^2))\n\nNow we can solve for H numerically:\n\nH ≈ 5.94 meters\n\nSo, the height of the hill is approximately 5.94 meters."
