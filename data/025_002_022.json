    "message_1": "Suppose we have two algebraic curves defined in $\\mathbb{C}^2$ by $C_1 = V(x^2+y^2-1)$ and $C_2 = V(x^2-y^2),$ where $V(\\cdot)$ denotes the zero locus of a polynomial. Find the intersection number of $C_1$ and $C_2$ at the origin.",
    "message_2": "To find the intersection number of $C_1$ and $C_2$ at the origin, we first need to check if the origin is a point of intersection. Note that the origin $(0,0)$ does not satisfy the equation of $C_1$, since $0^2 + 0^2 - 1 = -1 \\neq 0$. Therefore, the origin is not a point on $C_1$, and the intersection number of $C_1$ and $C_2$ at the origin is 0."
