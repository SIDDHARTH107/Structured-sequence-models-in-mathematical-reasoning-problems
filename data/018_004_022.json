    "message_2": "To determine the complement of set A and set B, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Let's assume the universal set U is the set of integers from 1 to 6, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nNow, the complement of set A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. Similarly, the complement of set B, denoted by B', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set B.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A} = {2, 4, 6}\nB' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ B} = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNow, to show that the complement of set A and the complement of set B are unique sets, we need to prove that A' ≠ B'. We can do this by showing that there exists at least one element in A' that is not in B', and vice versa.\n\nLet's take the element 2. We can see that 2 ∈ A' but 2 ∉ B'. Similarly, let's take the element 1. We can see that 1 ∈ B' but 1 ∉ A'. Since there are elements in A' that are not in B' and elements in B' that are not in A', we can conclude that A' and B' are unique sets."
