    "message_1": "Given two algebraic curves in the plane, $C_1$ defined by $y=x^2$ and $C_2$ defined by $y=-2x^2+6x-1$, find the number of intersection points of the two curves.",
    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of the two curves, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n$$y = x^2$$\n$$y = -2x^2 + 6x - 1$$\n\nSince both equations are equal to $y$, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n$$x^2 = -2x^2 + 6x - 1$$\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for $x$. First, move all terms to one side:\n\n$$3x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, so we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for $x$:\n\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nIn this case, $a = 3$, $b = -6$, and $c = 1$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(3)(1)}}{2(3)}$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 12}}{6}$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{24}}{6}$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the square root:\n\n$$\\sqrt{24} = 2\\sqrt{6}$$\n\nSo the two possible values for $x$ are:\n\n$$x_1 = \\frac{6 + 2\\sqrt{6}}{6} = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$$\n$$x_2 = \\frac{6 - 2\\sqrt{6}}{6} = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$$\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding $y$ values by plugging these $x$ values back into either of the original equations. We'll use the first equation, $y = x^2$:\n\n$$y_1 = x_1^2 = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right)^2$$\n$$y_2 = x_2^2 = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right)^2$$\n\nSo the two intersection points are:\n\n$$(x_1, y_1) = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}, \\left(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right)^2\\right)$$\n$$(x_2, y_2) = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}, \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right)^2\\right)$$\n\nThus, there are 2 intersection points of the two curves."
