    "message_1": "In a small village, there are 10 farmers who each own land adjacent to a common grazing area. Each farmer needs to decide whether to graze their own cows or not. If a farmer grazes their cows, they receive a profit of $30 per cow. However, if all farmers graze their cows, the village's common grazing area will become depleted, resulting in a total loss of $500 to the village. Assuming that each farmer only takes into account their own profit in their decision-making, how many cows will each farmer graze to maximize their own profit, and what will the total profit of the village be?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation for each farmer. If a farmer grazes their cows, they receive a profit of $30 per cow. However, if all farmers graze their cows, the village's common grazing area will become depleted, resulting in a total loss of $500 to the village. Since each farmer is only concerned about their own profit, they will graze their cows to maximize their individual profit.\n\nIf all 10 farmers graze their cows, the total profit for the village would be 10 * $30 = $300 per cow. However, the depletion of the common grazing area would result in a loss of $500. So, the net profit for the village would be $300 - $500 = -$200, which is a loss.\n\nTo maximize their own profit, each farmer will graze their cows, as they receive a profit of $30 per cow. Therefore, each farmer will graze one cow, resulting in a total of 10 cows being grazed in the village.\n\nThe total profit of the village will be the sum of the profit from each farmer, minus the loss due to the depletion of the common grazing area:\n\nTotal profit = (10 * $30) - $500 = $300 - $500 = -$200\n\nSo, each farmer will graze one cow to maximize their own profit, and the total profit of the village will be a loss of $200."
