    "message_2": "First, let's find the equation of the quarter-circle. Since it's a quarter-circle with radius 2, we can write the equation as:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 = 4$\n\nNow, we are given the heat density function as:\n\n$T(x, y) = 4 - x^2 - y^2$\n\nWe are given that the wire is heated until its temperature is 60 degrees. So, we can set the heat density function equal to 60:\n\n$60 = 4 - x^2 - y^2$\n\nNow, we need to find the temperature $T(0, 2)$ at the highest point of the wire. Since the wire is a quarter-circle with radius 2, the highest point of the wire is at $(0, 2)$. We can plug these coordinates into the heat density function:\n\n$T(0, 2) = 4 - (0)^2 - (2)^2 = 4 - 0 - 4 = 0$\n\nSo, the temperature at the highest point of the wire $(0, 2)$ is 0 degrees."
