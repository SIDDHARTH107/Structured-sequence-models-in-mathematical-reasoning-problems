    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem related to Diffie-Hellman key exchange:\n\nSuppose Alice and Bob want to communicate securely. Alice generates a random number and chooses a primitive root modulo 23. She calculates 24 mod 23 = 1, 21 mod 23 = 21, and 22 mod 23 = 4. Alice's private key is 6, and so her public key is 46 mod 23 = 16. Bob generates a random number and chooses the same primitive root modulo 23 as Alice. He calculates 23 mod 23 = 1, 21 mod 23 = 21, and 24 mod 23 = 4. Bob's private key is 15, and so his public key is 415 mod 23 = 8. Using these values, what is the secret key that Alice and Bob will use for their communication?",
    "message_2": "To find the secret key, Alice and Bob will use each other's public keys and their own private keys. \n\nAlice computes the secret key as follows:\nSecret key = (Bob's public key)^Alice's private key mod 23\nSecret key = 8^6 mod 23\n\nBob computes the secret key as follows:\nSecret key = (Alice's public key)^Bob's private key mod 23\nSecret key = 16^15 mod 23\n\nNow, let's calculate the secret key for both Alice and Bob:\n\nFor Alice:\n8^6 mod 23 = 262144 mod 23 = 2\n\nFor Bob:\n16^15 mod 23 = 1152921504606846976 mod 23 = 2\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have calculated the same secret key, which is 2. They will use this secret key for their secure communication."
