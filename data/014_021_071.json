    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted a Hill Cipher message \"RLOQ\" and you know that the key used for encryption is a 2x2 matrix with the form of \n[ a b ]\n[ c d ] \nin modulo 26, what is the message in its decrypted form?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message \"RLOQ\" using the Hill Cipher with a 2x2 key matrix, we first need to find the inverse of the key matrix. However, since we don't have the exact values of a, b, c, and d, we cannot find the inverse matrix and decrypt the message.\n\nIf you can provide the values of a, b, c, and d, we can proceed with the decryption process."
