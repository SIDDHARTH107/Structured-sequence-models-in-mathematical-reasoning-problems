    "message_1": "A company produces two products: Product A and Product B. The production of Product A requires 1 hour of machine time and 2 hours of labor time, and the production of Product B requires 2 hours of machine time and 1 hour of labor time. The company has a total of 100 hours of machine time and 80 hours of labor time available per week. The profit from the sale of one unit of Product A is $10 and the profit from the sale of one unit of Product B is $12. Assuming all products can be sold, what is the optimal production quantity of each product per week to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced and y be the number of units of Product B produced. We have the following constraints based on the available machine and labor time:\n\n1x + 2y ≤ 100 (machine time constraint)\n2x + 1y ≤ 80 (labor time constraint)\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit function:\n\nProfit = 10x + 12y\n\nTo find the optimal production quantity, we can use the graphical method to solve this linear programming problem. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. For the machine time constraint (1x + 2y ≤ 100), the boundary line is x + 2y = 100. Solving for y, we get y = (100 - x)/2. The feasible region is below this line.\n2. For the labor time constraint (2x + 1y ≤ 80), the boundary line is 2x + y = 80. Solving for y, we get y = 80 - 2x. The feasible region is below this line.\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both constraints are satisfied. The corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 50), (40, 0), and (20, 40). We'll now evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0): 10(0) + 12(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0, 50): 10(0) + 12(50) = $600\n3. Profit at (40, 0): 10(40) + 12(0) = $400\n4. Profit at (20, 40): 10(20) + 12(40) = $680\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (20, 40), with a profit of $680. Therefore, the optimal production quantity is 20 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B per week."
