    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of 5 cm and a height of 12 cm. What is the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, a = 5 cm and b = 12 cm. The formula is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nc² = (5 cm)² + (12 cm)²\n\nc² = 25 cm² + 144 cm²\n\nc² = 169 cm²\n\nTo find the length of the hypotenuse (c), take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = √(169 cm²)\n\nc = 13 cm\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse is 13 cm."
