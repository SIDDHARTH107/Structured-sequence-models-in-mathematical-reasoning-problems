The winner of the game will be the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all the numbers chosen by everyone. If two players choose numbers equally close to the target value, the player who chose the lower number will be declared the winner. \n\nAssuming that all players are rational and want to win the game, what number should you choose to maximize your chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize your chances of winning, you should try to predict the choices of the other players and choose a number that is 2/3 of their expected average. Since all players are rational, they will also be thinking in the same way.\n\nLet's start with the first level of reasoning. If all players choose a number randomly between 0 and 100, the average would be 50. In this case, you should choose 2/3 * 50 = 33.33.\n\nHowever, since all players are rational, they will also think about choosing 33.33. So, in the second level of reasoning, you should choose 2/3 * 33.33 = 22.22.\n\nContinuing this process, we get the following sequence of choices:\n\n1st level: 33.33\n2nd level: 22.22\n3rd level: 14.81\n4th level: 9.87\n...\n\nAs we iterate through the levels of reasoning, the chosen numbers get closer and closer to 0. In practice, it's unlikely that all players will go through many levels of reasoning, so choosing a number around 14.81 (3rd level) or 9.87 (4th level) might be a good strategy to maximize your chances of winning."
