    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + 2 over the interval [-1, 4], we first need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to 0.\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 5\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 8x + 5 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -8, and c = 5:\n\nx = (8 ± √((-8)^2 - 4(3)(5))) / (2(3))\nx = (8 ± √(64 - 60)) / 6\nx = (8 ± √4) / 6\nx = (8 ± 2) / 6\n\nThere are two solutions:\n\nx1 = (8 + 2) / 6 = 10 / 6 = 5/3\nx2 = (8 - 2) / 6 = 6 / 6 = 1\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval to find the minimum value:\n\nf(-1) = (-1)^3 - 4(-1)^2 + 5(-1) + 2 = -1 - 4 - 5 + 2 = -8\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 4(1)^2 + 5(1) + 2 = 1 - 4 + 5 + 2 = 4\nf(5/3) = (5/3)^3 - 4(5/3)^2 + 5(5/3) + 2 ≈ -0.1852\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 4(4)^2 + 5(4) + 2 = 64 - 64 + 20 + 2 = 22\n\nThe minimum value occurs at x = 5/3, and the minimum value of the function is approximately -0.1852."
