    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform method, we first need to take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. Recall that the Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-iωt)] dt\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency and i is the imaginary unit. \n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides of the given differential equation y'' + 4y = 0, we get:\n\nF{y''}(ω) + 4F{y}(ω) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transforms of y'' and y. We know that the Fourier transform of the second derivative is given by:\n\nF{y''}(ω) = (iω)^2 * Y(ω)\n\nwhere Y(ω) is the Fourier transform of y(t). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n(iω)^2 * Y(ω) + 4Y(ω) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(-ω^2 + 4)Y(ω) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to get the solution y(t). Since the equation (-ω^2 + 4)Y(ω) = 0 has a simple structure, we can guess the form of the solution. The given differential equation is a second-order linear homogeneous equation with constant coefficients, which has the general solution:\n\ny(t) = A * cos(2t) + B * sin(2t)\n\nwhere A and B are constants. To find these constants, we use the initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = -3.\n\nApplying the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 2 = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0) => A = 2\n\ny'(t) = -2A * sin(2t) + 2B * cos(2t)\n\ny'(0) = -3 = -2A * sin(0) + 2B * cos(0) => B = -3/2\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = 2 * cos(2t) - (3/2) * sin(2t)"
