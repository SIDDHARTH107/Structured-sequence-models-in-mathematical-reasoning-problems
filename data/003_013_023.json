    "message_2": "To find the length of the supporting cable, we can use the sine function in trigonometry. We are given the angle (60°) and the height of the flagpole (18 meters). We can use the sine function to find the length of the supporting cable (hypotenuse) as follows:\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side (height) / hypotenuse (cable length)\n\nsin(60°) = 18 / cable length\n\nWe know that sin(60°) = √3 / 2, so:\n\n(√3 / 2) = 18 / cable length\n\nNow, we can solve for the cable length:\n\ncable length = 18 / ( √3 / 2)\n\ncable length = 18 * (2 / √3)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\n\ncable length = (18 * 2 * √3) / ( √3 * √3)\n\ncable length = (36 * √3) / 3\n\ncable length = 12 * √3\n\nSo, the length of the supporting cable is 12 * √3 meters.\n\nNow, to find the maximum height the flag can reach, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na² + b² = c²\n\nwhere a is the height of the flagpole, b is the horizontal distance from the base of the flagpole to the point where the cable is attached to the ground, and c is the length of the supporting cable.\n\nWe know the height of the flagpole (a = 18 meters) and the length of the supporting cable (c = 12 * √3 meters). We can solve for the horizontal distance (b):\n\n18² + b² = (12 * √3)²\n\n324 + b² = 432\n\nb² = 432 - 324\n\nb² = 108\n\nb = √108\n\nNow, we can find the maximum height the flag can reach by using the angle between the ground and the cable supporting the flagpole (60°) and the horizontal distance (b = √108 meters). We can use the tangent function:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side (height) / adjacent side (horizontal distance)\n\ntan(60°) = maximum height / √108\n\nWe know that tan(60°) = √3, so:\n\n√3 = maximum height / √108\n\nNow, we can solve for the maximum height:\n\nmaximum height = √3 * √108\n\nmaximum height = √(3 * 108)\n\nmaximum height = √324\n\nmaximum height = 18 meters\n\nSo, the maximum height the flag can reach is 18 meters."
