    "message_2": "To find the second Chern class c₂(L²), we first need to find the first Chern class of L². Since L is a complex line bundle, L² is the tensor product of L with itself. The first Chern class of a tensor product of line bundles is the sum of the first Chern classes of the individual line bundles. In this case, we have:\n\nc₁(L²) = c₁(L) + c₁(L) = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nNow, we can use the Whitney sum formula to find the second Chern class c₂(L²). The Whitney sum formula states that for two complex vector bundles E and F, the total Chern class of their direct sum is the product of their total Chern classes:\n\nc(E ⊕ F) = c(E) * c(F).\n\nIn our case, we have a complex line bundle L, so we can consider E = L and F = L². Then, the total Chern class of L ⊕ L² is:\n\nc(L ⊕ L²) = c(L) * c(L²).\n\nThe total Chern class of a complex line bundle is given by:\n\nc(L) = 1 + c₁(L).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nc(L ⊕ L²) = (1 + c₁(L)) * (1 + c₁(L²)) = (1 + 3) * (1 + 6) = 4 * 7 = 28.\n\nNow, we can expand the total Chern class of L ⊕ L²:\n\nc(L ⊕ L²) = 1 + c₁(L ⊕ L²) + c₂(L ⊕ L²).\n\nSince we know that c(L ⊕ L²) = 28, we can solve for c₂(L ⊕ L²):\n\n28 = 1 + c₁(L ⊕ L²) + c₂(L ⊕ L²).\n\nHowever, we cannot determine c₁(L ⊕ L²) and c₂(L ⊕ L²) uniquely from the given information. The second Chern class c₂(L²) depends on the specific complex manifold X and the complex line bundle L, and more information is needed to find its exact value."
