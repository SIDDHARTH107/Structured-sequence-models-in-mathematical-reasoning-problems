    "message_1": "Suppose you have 6 identical beads of different colors and you want to string them together to make a necklace. How many distinct necklaces can you make if rotations and reflections are considered equivalent? (Use Polya's enumeration theorem to solve the problem.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Polya's enumeration theorem, we need to find the cycle index of the group acting on the beads. In this case, the group is the dihedral group D_6, which consists of 6 rotations and 6 reflections.\n\nFirst, let's consider the rotations:\n1. Identity rotation (no rotation): There is only 1 cycle, which includes all 6 beads. The cycle structure is (a^6).\n2. Rotation by 60 degrees: There are 2 cycles, each with 3 beads. The cycle structure is (a^3)^2.\n3. Rotation by 120 degrees: Same as rotation by 60 degrees, the cycle structure is (a^3)^2.\n4. Rotation by 180 degrees: There are 3 cycles, each with 2 beads. The cycle structure is (a^2)^3.\n5. Rotation by 240 degrees: Same as rotation by 120 degrees, the cycle structure is (a^3)^2.\n6. Rotation by 300 degrees: Same as rotation by 60 degrees, the cycle structure is (a^3)^2.\n\nNow, let's consider the reflections:\n1. Reflection through a line passing through two opposite beads: There are 3 cycles, each with 2 beads. The cycle structure is (a^2)^3.\n2. Reflection through a line passing through the midpoints of two opposite edges: There are 2 cycles, one with 4 beads and one with 2 beads. The cycle structure is (a^4)(a^2).\n\nNow, we can compute the cycle index of the dihedral group D_6:\nP(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_6) = (1/12)[(a^6) + 3(a^3)^2 + 2(a^2)^3 + 3(a^2)^3 + (a^4)(a^2)]\n\nNow, we can use Polya's enumeration theorem to find the number of distinct necklaces. We substitute a_i = 6 for each i in the cycle index:\nN = (1/12)[(6^6) + 3(6^3)^2 + 2(6^2)^3 + 3(6^2)^3 + (6^4)(6^2)]\n\nN = (1/12)[46656 + 3(216)^2 + 2(36)^3 + 3(36)^3 + (1296)(36)]\n\nN = (1/12)[46656 + 3(46656) + 2(46656) + 3(46656) + (46656)]\n\nN = (1/12)(46656 * 10)\n\nN = 3888\n\nSo, there are 3888 distinct necklaces that can be made with 6 identical beads of different colors, considering rotations and reflections as equivalent."
