    "message_2": "Since the function $f(z)$ is analytic in the open unit disc $D$ and extends to $z=1$ with $f(1)=2$, we can evaluate the function at $z=1$:\n\n$$f(1) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n 1^n = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = 2$$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $a_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ that satisfy this equation. We can start by looking at the first few terms:\n\n$$a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \\cdots = 2$$\n\nSince the series converges to 2, we can deduce that $a_0 = 2$ and all other coefficients $a_n$ for $n \\geq 1$ must be equal to 0. This is because if any of the other coefficients were non-zero, the series would not converge to 2.\n\nTherefore, the values of $a_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ are:\n\n$$a_n = \\begin{cases}\n2 & \\text{if } n = 0 \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } n \\geq 1\n\\end{cases}$$"
