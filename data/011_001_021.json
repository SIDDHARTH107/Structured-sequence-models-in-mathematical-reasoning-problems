    "message_2": "To form a committee of 5 people from a group of 10 individuals, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items, n! is the factorial of n (n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*1), and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (the number of individuals) and k = 5 (the number of people in the committee).\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((5*4*3*2*1)*(5*4*3*2*1))\n\nC(10, 5) = (10*9*8*7*6) / (5*4*3*2*1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 30240 / 120\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo, there are 252 ways to form a committee of 5 people from a group of 10 individuals."
