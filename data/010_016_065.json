    "message_2": "To compute the intersection number of A and B in X, we will use Poincaré duality and the cup product in cohomology. Let's denote the cohomology classes of A and B by [A] and [B] respectively, which are elements of H^k(X; Z), where Z denotes the integers.\n\nBy Poincaré duality, there is an isomorphism PD: H^k(X; Z) -> H_{n-k}(X; Z) for all 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Let [A'] and [B'] be the images of [A] and [B] under this isomorphism, i.e., [A'] = PD([A]) and [B'] = PD([B]). These are elements of H_{n-k}(X; Z).\n\nNow, we can use the cap product to compute the intersection number. The cap product is a bilinear map:\n\n∧: H^k(X; Z) × H_{n-k}(X; Z) -> H_n(X; Z),\n\nwhich is defined by [α] ∧ [β] = [α] ∪ PD([β]), where ∪ denotes the cup product.\n\nThe intersection number of A and B in X is given by the evaluation of the cap product of their cohomology classes on the fundamental class [X] ∈ H_n(X; Z):\n\nI(A, B) = ⟨[A] ∧ [B'], [X]⟩,\n\nwhere ⟨ , ⟩ denotes the Kronecker pairing, which is an evaluation of a cohomology class on a homology class.\n\nNow, we can compute the intersection number using the given information:\n\nI(A, B) = ⟨[A] ∧ [B'], [X]⟩ = ⟨[A] ∪ PD([B']), [X]⟩.\n\nSince [B'] = PD([B]), we have PD([B']) = PD^2([B]) = [B] (because PD is an isomorphism and PD^2 is the identity map). Therefore,\n\nI(A, B) = ⟨[A] ∪ [B], [X]⟩.\n\nThis is the intersection number of A and B in X. Note that this number is an integer, and it is a topological invariant of the pair (A, B) in X. It can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the relative orientations of A and B in X."
