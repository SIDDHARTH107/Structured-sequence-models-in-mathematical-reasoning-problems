    "message_2": "A x B, also known as the Cartesian product of A and B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. \n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB x A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A.\n\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A x B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B x A. For example, (1, 3) is in A x B but not in B x A, and (3, 1) is in B x A but not in A x B. Therefore, A x B is not equal to B x A."
