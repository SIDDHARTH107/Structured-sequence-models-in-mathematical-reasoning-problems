    "message_2": "To find the value of f(z) for z = 1+i using analytic continuation, we first need to express the complex logarithm function in its polar form. The polar form of a complex number z = x + yi is given by z = r(cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)), where r = |z| and θ is the argument of z.\n\nFor z = 1+i, we have x = 1 and y = 1. Thus, we can find r and θ as follows:\n\nr = |z| = √(x^2 + y^2) = √(1^2 + 1^2) = √2\n\nNow, we need to find the argument θ. Since x > 0 and y > 0, we are in the first quadrant, and we can use the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(y/x) = arctan(1/1) = arctan(1) = π/4\n\nNow, we can express z = 1+i in its polar form:\n\nz = √2(cos(π/4) + i*sin(π/4))\n\nNow, we can find the complex logarithm of z:\n\nf(z) = log(z) = log(√2(cos(π/4) + i*sin(π/4)))\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\nf(z) = log(√2) + log(cos(π/4) + i*sin(π/4))\n\nThe first term, log(√2), is the real part of the complex logarithm. The second term, log(cos(π/4) + i*sin(π/4)), can be simplified using Euler's formula:\n\nlog(cos(π/4) + i*sin(π/4)) = log(e^(i*(π/4)))\n\nNow, we can use the property of logarithms that log(a^b) = b*log(a):\n\nlog(e^(i*(π/4))) = (i*(π/4))*log(e)\n\nSince log(e) = 1, we have:\n\n(i*(π/4))*log(e) = i*(π/4)\n\nNow, we can combine the real and imaginary parts to find the complex logarithm of z = 1+i:\n\nf(z) = log(√2) + i*(π/4)\n\nSo, the value of f(z) for z = 1+i using analytic continuation is:\n\nf(1+i) = log(√2) + i*(π/4)"
