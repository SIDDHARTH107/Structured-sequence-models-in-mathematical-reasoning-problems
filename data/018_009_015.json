    "message_2": "First, let's find (A x B) x C:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, we'll find (A x B) x C:\n\n(A x B) x C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}\n\nNext, let's find A x (B x C):\n\nB x C = {(3, 5), (4, 5)}\n\nNow, we'll find A x (B x C):\n\nA x (B x C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nNow, let's rewrite the elements of both sets to make them look more similar:\n\n(A x B) x C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 4), 5), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 4), 5)}\n\nA x (B x C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (4, 5)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (4, 5))}\n\nAs we can see, the elements of both sets are not exactly the same. However, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two sets:\n\n((1, 3), 5) ↔ (1, (3, 5))\n((1, 4), 5) ↔ (1, (4, 5))\n((2, 3), 5) ↔ (2, (3, 5))\n((2, 4), 5) ↔ (2, (4, 5))\n\nSo, while the Cartesian product of two sets is not strictly associative, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of (A x B) x C and A x (B x C). This means that the two sets have the same cardinality and can be considered equivalent in some contexts."
