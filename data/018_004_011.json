    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define a universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of set A, denoted as A', consists of all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A.\n\nLet's assume that U is a finite set with n elements, where n > 10. Then, the complement of set A, A', will have (n - 10) elements.\n\nNow, we need to prove that the complement A' is unique. To do this, we will use proof by contradiction.\n\nSuppose there exists another set B such that B ≠ A' and B is also a complement of A. This means that B contains all the elements in U that are not in A, and A' contains all the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nSince B and A' are both complements of A, they must have the same elements. However, we assumed that B ≠ A', which means there must be at least one element that is in B but not in A', or vice versa.\n\nLet x be an element in B but not in A'. Since B is a complement of A, x cannot be in A. But this contradicts the definition of A', which contains all the elements in U that are not in A. Therefore, our assumption that B ≠ A' must be false.\n\nHence, the complement of set A, A', is unique."
