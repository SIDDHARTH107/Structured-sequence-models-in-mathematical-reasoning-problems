    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 5 cm, we can calculate the surface area as follows:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (5 cm)²\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 25 cm²\nSurface Area = 100π cm²\n\nThe surface area of the sphere with radius 5 cm is approximately 314.16 cm² (using π ≈ 3.1416)."
