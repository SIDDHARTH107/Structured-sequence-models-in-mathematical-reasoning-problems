If the characteristic polynomial of $E$ is given by $\\chi_E(t) = (t - \\lambda_1)(t - \\lambda_2)(t - \\lambda_3)$, then what is the Euler class of $E$?",
    "message_2": "The Euler class of a vector bundle is a cohomology class that measures the obstruction to the existence of a non-vanishing section. In the case of a rank $3$ vector bundle $E$ over a compact Hausdorff space $X$, the Euler class is an element of the third cohomology group $H^3(X; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nTo compute the Euler class, we can use the top Chern class of the bundle, which is defined in terms of the characteristic polynomial of the bundle. In our case, the characteristic polynomial is given by $\\chi_E(t) = (t - \\lambda_1)(t - \\lambda_2)(t - \\lambda_3)$. The top Chern class, denoted $c_3(E)$, is the coefficient of $t^3$ in the polynomial $\\chi_E(t)$.\n\nExpanding the characteristic polynomial, we get:\n\n$\\chi_E(t) = t^3 - (\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3)t^2 + (\\lambda_1\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_1\\lambda_3 + \\lambda_2\\lambda_3)t - \\lambda_1\\lambda_2\\lambda_3$.\n\nThus, the top Chern class $c_3(E)$ is equal to $-\\lambda_1\\lambda_2\\lambda_3$.\n\nNow, the Euler class of the vector bundle $E$ is equal to the top Chern class, i.e.,\n\n$e(E) = c_3(E) = -\\lambda_1\\lambda_2\\lambda_3$.\n\nSo, the Euler class of the given vector bundle $E$ is $-\\lambda_1\\lambda_2\\lambda_3$."
