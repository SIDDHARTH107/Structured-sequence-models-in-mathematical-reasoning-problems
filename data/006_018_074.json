    "message_1": "A certain type of financial fraud occurs in 5% of all companies. If an investor is considering investing in a portfolio of 50 companies, what is the probability that at least one of those companies experiences this type of fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complement probability. The complement of the event \"at least one company experiences fraud\" is \"none of the companies experience fraud.\" \n\nThe probability of a single company not experiencing fraud is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor all 50 companies to not experience fraud, the probability is (0.95)^50.\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least one company experiencing fraud, we subtract the probability of none of the companies experiencing fraud from 1:\n\nP(at least one company experiences fraud) = 1 - P(none of the companies experience fraud)\nP(at least one company experiences fraud) = 1 - (0.95)^50 â‰ˆ 0.923\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the 50 companies experiences this type of financial fraud is approximately 92.3%."
