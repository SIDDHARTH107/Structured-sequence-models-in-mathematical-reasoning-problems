    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation, and multiply the first equation by 4 and subtract it from the third equation.\n\nFirst equation * 2:\n2x + 4y + 6z = 14\n\nSubtract from the second equation:\n(2x + 3y - z) - (2x + 4y + 6z) = -2 - 14\n-y - 7z = -16\n\nFirst equation * 4:\n4x + 8y + 12z = 28\n\nSubtract from the third equation:\n(4x + 9y + 6z) - (4x + 8y + 12z) = 25 - 28\ny - 6z = -3\n\nNow we have two new equations:\n\n1) -y - 7z = -16\n2) y - 6z = -3\n\nAdd equation 1 and 2 to eliminate y:\n\n(-y - 7z) + (y - 6z) = -16 + (-3)\n-z = -19\n\nNow we can find the value of z:\n\nz = 19\n\nNow, substitute the value of z back into equation 2 to find the value of y:\n\ny - 6(19) = -3\ny - 114 = -3\ny = 111\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z back into the first equation to find the value of x:\n\nx + 2(111) + 3(19) = 7\nx + 222 + 57 = 7\nx = -272\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -272, y = 111, and z = 19."
