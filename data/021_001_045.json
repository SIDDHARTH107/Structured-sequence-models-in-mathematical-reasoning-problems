    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. Then, we will use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  7 |\n| 2 -1  3 | -11|\n| 3 -1  2 | -5 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1:\n| 1  2 -1 |  7 |\n| 0 -5  5 | -25|\n| 3 -1  2 | -5 |\n\nR3 = R3 - 3 * R1:\n| 1  2 -1 |  7 |\n| 0 -5  5 | -25|\n| 0 -5  5 | -26 |\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -5 to get a leading 1.\n\nR2 = R2 / -5:\n| 1  2 -1 |  7 |\n| 0  1 -1 |  5 |\n| 0 -5  5 | -26 |\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the second element in the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 + 5 * R2:\n| 1  2 -1 |  7 |\n| 0  1 -1 |  5 |\n| 0  0  0 |  -1 |\n\nSince we have a row with all zeros except for the last element, this system of equations is inconsistent and has no solution."
