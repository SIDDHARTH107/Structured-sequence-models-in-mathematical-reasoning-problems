    "message_1": "A company produces and sells widgets at a cost of $10 per widget. They estimate that the demand for the widgets is given by the equation: \n\nD(p) = 2000 - 50p\n\nwhere p is the price per widget in dollars and D(p) is the quantity demanded.\n\nWhat price should the company charge in order to maximize their revenue?",
    "message_2": "To maximize revenue, we need to find the price at which the product of price (p) and quantity demanded (D(p)) is maximized. Revenue (R) can be expressed as:\n\nR(p) = p * D(p)\n\nSubstitute the given demand function into the revenue function:\n\nR(p) = p * (2000 - 50p)\n\nNow, expand the revenue function:\n\nR(p) = 2000p - 50p^2\n\nTo find the maximum revenue, we need to find the critical points of the revenue function. We do this by taking the first derivative of R(p) with respect to p and setting it equal to 0:\n\nR'(p) = dR(p)/dp = 2000 - 100p\n\nNow, set R'(p) = 0 and solve for p:\n\n0 = 2000 - 100p\n100p = 2000\np = 20\n\nSo, the company should charge $20 per widget to maximize their revenue."
