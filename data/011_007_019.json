    "message_2": "Let's denote the terms of the sequence as a_n, where n is the position of the term in the sequence. We are given that a_1 = 1, a_2 = 3, and a_3 = 7. The rule for generating the sequence is a_n = a_(n-1) + a_(n-2) + a_(n-3).\n\nWe want to find the value of a_10. Let's first find the values of a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, and a_9.\n\na_4 = a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11\na_5 = a_4 + a_3 + a_2 = 11 + 7 + 3 = 21\na_6 = a_5 + a_4 + a_3 = 21 + 11 + 7 = 39\na_7 = a_6 + a_5 + a_4 = 39 + 21 + 11 = 71\na_8 = a_7 + a_6 + a_5 = 71 + 39 + 21 = 131\na_9 = a_8 + a_7 + a_6 = 131 + 71 + 39 = 241\n\nNow, we can find the value of a_10:\n\na_10 = a_9 + a_8 + a_7 = 241 + 131 + 71 = 443\n\nSo, the value of the 10th term in this sequence is 443."
