If both players confess, they will each receive a sentence of 5 years in prison. If both players remain silent, they will each receive a sentence of 1 year in prison. However, if one player confesses while the other remains silent, the player who confesses will receive no sentence and the one who remains silent will receive a sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\nIf Player 1 confesses and Player 2 remains silent, what is the minimum sentence Player 1 will receive?",
