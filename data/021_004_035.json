    "message_2": "To find the numerical value of the definite integral using the forward difference method with a step size of 0.1, we will approximate the area under the curve by summing the areas of rectangles. The width of each rectangle is 0.1, and the height is the value of the function at the left endpoint of each interval.\n\nThe function is f(x) = x^3 + 2x. We will evaluate the function at the points 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9.\n\nf(0.2) = (0.2)^3 + 2(0.2) = 0.008 + 0.4 = 0.408\nf(0.3) = (0.3)^3 + 2(0.3) = 0.027 + 0.6 = 0.627\nf(0.4) = (0.4)^3 + 2(0.4) = 0.064 + 0.8 = 0.864\nf(0.5) = (0.5)^3 + 2(0.5) = 0.125 + 1 = 1.125\nf(0.6) = (0.6)^3 + 2(0.6) = 0.216 + 1.2 = 1.416\nf(0.7) = (0.7)^3 + 2(0.7) = 0.343 + 1.4 = 1.743\nf(0.8) = (0.8)^3 + 2(0.8) = 0.512 + 1.6 = 2.112\nf(0.9) = (0.9)^3 + 2(0.9) = 0.729 + 1.8 = 2.529\n\nNow, we will sum the areas of the rectangles:\n\nArea ≈ 0.1 * (0.408 + 0.627 + 0.864 + 1.125 + 1.416 + 1.743 + 2.112 + 2.529)\nArea ≈ 0.1 * (9.824)\nArea ≈ 0.9824\n\nSo, the numerical value of the definite integral using the forward difference method with a step size of 0.1 is approximately 0.9824."
