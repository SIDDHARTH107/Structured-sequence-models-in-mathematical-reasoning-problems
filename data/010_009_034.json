    "message_2": "Yes, you can subdivide each face into three new faces to get a new mesh with 31 faces. Here's how:\n\n1. Start with the original mesh with 10 vertices, 17 faces, and E edges. According to Euler's formula for polyhedra, we have:\n\n   V - E + F = 2\n   10 - E + 17 = 2\n   E = 25 edges\n\n2. Now, subdivide each of the 17 faces into three new faces by adding a new vertex at the midpoint of each edge and connecting these new vertices. This will create three new faces for each original face.\n\n3. For each original face, we add 3 new vertices (one at the midpoint of each edge) and 3 new edges (connecting the new vertices). So, for 17 faces, we add:\n\n   - 17 * 3 = 51 new vertices\n   - 17 * 3 = 51 new edges\n\n4. However, each new vertex and new edge is shared by two adjacent faces, so we have counted them twice. Therefore, we need to divide the number of new vertices and new edges by 2:\n\n   - 51 / 2 = 25.5 new vertices (rounded up to 26 since we can't have half a vertex)\n   - 51 / 2 = 25.5 new edges (rounded up to 26 since we can't have half an edge)\n\n5. Now, we can calculate the total number of vertices, edges, and faces in the new mesh:\n\n   - Total vertices: 10 (original) + 26 (new) = 36 vertices\n   - Total edges: 25 (original) + 26 (new) = 51 edges\n   - Total faces: 17 (original) * 3 (subdivided) = 51 faces\n\nSo, the new mesh will have 36 vertices, 51 edges, and 51 faces."
