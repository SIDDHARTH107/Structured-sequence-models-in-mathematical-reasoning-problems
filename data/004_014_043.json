    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the cone about its axis of symmetry, we can use the method of integration. We'll integrate the cross-sectional area of the cone along its height.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of the line that represents the radius of the cone at any height. The base radius is 3 cm and the height is 6 cm. We can use these two points (0, 3) and (6, 0) to find the equation of the line in the form y = mx + b.\n\nUsing the two points, we can find the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b):\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (0 - 3) / (6 - 0) = -3 / 6 = -1/2\n\nNow, we can find the y-intercept (b) using one of the points, for example (0, 3):\n\n3 = (-1/2) * 0 + b\nb = 3\n\nSo, the equation of the line is y = -1/2 * x + 3.\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the cone using integration. We'll integrate the cross-sectional area (A) of the cone along its height (x):\n\nA(x) = π * (radius at height x)^2 = π * (-1/2 * x + 3)^2\n\nNow, integrate A(x) with respect to x from 0 to 6:\n\nV = ∫[0, 6] π * (-1/2 * x + 3)^2 dx\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use substitution. Let u = -1/2 * x + 3, then du = -1/2 dx, and dx = -2 du:\n\nV = ∫[3, 0] π * u^2 * (-2) du\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\nV = -2π * ∫[3, 0] u^2 du = -2π * [u^3/3] | [3, 0]\n\nV = -2π * [(0^3/3) - (3^3/3)] = -2π * [-27/3] = 18π\n\nThe volume of the solid obtained by rotating the cone about its axis of symmetry is approximately:\n\nV ≈ 18π ≈ 56.55 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the solid is approximately 56.55 cm³, rounded to two decimal places."
