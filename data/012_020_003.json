    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. In other words, an automorphism maps the graph onto itself. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms.\n\nFor the given graph, we can find the automorphisms by considering the possible permutations of vertices that preserve adjacency. We can start by noting that vertex A can only be mapped to vertices A, B, C, D, E, or F.\n\n1. If A is mapped to A, then B must be mapped to B, C, D, or E. We can consider each case:\n   a. If B is mapped to B, then the remaining vertices must be mapped to themselves (identity automorphism).\n   b. If B is mapped to C, then C must be mapped to B, D to F, E to E, and F to D (a 180-degree rotation around the center of the graph).\n   c. If B is mapped to D, then C must be mapped to E, D to B, E to C, and F to F (a reflection across the vertical axis).\n   d. If B is mapped to E, then C must be mapped to F, D to C, E to D, and F to B (a reflection across the horizontal axis).\n\n2. If A is mapped to B, then B must be mapped to A, C to F, D to E, and E to D (a reflection across the diagonal from A to F).\n\n3. If A is mapped to C, then B must be mapped to F, C to A, D to E, E to D, and F to B (a reflection across the diagonal from D to C).\n\n4. If A is mapped to D, then B must be mapped to E, C to F, D to A, E to B, and F to C (a 180-degree rotation followed by a reflection across the vertical axis).\n\n5. If A is mapped to E, then B must be mapped to D, C to F, D to B, E to A, and F to C (a reflection across the center of the graph).\n\n6. If A is mapped to F, then B must be mapped to E, C to D, D to C, E to B, and F to A (a 180-degree rotation followed by a reflection across the horizontal axis).\n\nIn total, we have found 8 automorphisms for the given graph:\n\n1. Identity: (A)(B)(C)(D)(E)(F)\n2. 180-degree rotation: (A)(B↔C)(D↔F)\n3. Vertical reflection: (A)(B↔D)(C↔F)\n4. Horizontal reflection: (A)(B↔E)(C↔F)\n5. Diagonal reflection (A to F): (A↔B)(C↔F)(D↔E)\n6. Diagonal reflection (D to C): (A↔C)(B↔F)(D↔E)\n7. 180-degree rotation + vertical reflection: (A↔D)(B↔E)(C↔F)\n8. Center reflection: (A↔E)(B↔D)(C↔F)\n\nThus, the automorphism group of the given graph has 8 elements."
