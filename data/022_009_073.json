    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of a series is less than 1, then the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{(n+1)^2+1}{(n+1)!}\\cdot\\frac{n!}{n^2+1}\\right|$\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{(n+1)^2+1}{(n+1)n!}\\cdot\\frac{n!}{n^2+1}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{(n+1)^2+1}{(n+1)(n^2+1)}\\right|$\n\nNow, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by n^2 to make it easier to find the limit:\n\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{1+\\frac{2}{n}+\\frac{1}{n^2}}{1+\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{1}{n^2}}\\right|$\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the terms with n in the denominator approach 0:\n\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{1+0+0}{1+0+0}\\right| = 1$\n\nSince the limit is equal to 1, the Ratio Test is inconclusive. However, we can use the Root Test instead. The Root Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the nth root of the absolute value of the nth term of a series is less than 1, then the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sqrt[n]{\\left|\\frac{n^2+1}{n!}z^n\\right|} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{(n^2+1)^{1/n}}{n!^{1/n}}z\\right|$\n\nNow, we can use the fact that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}(1+\\frac{a}{n})^n = e^a$ and $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{n!^{1/n}}{n} = e$:\n\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{e^2}{e}z\\right| = |z|$\n\nFor the series to converge, we need the limit to be less than 1:\n\n$|z| < 1$\n\nThus, the radius of convergence is 1.\n\nThe interval of convergence is the set of all z values for which the series converges. Since the radius of convergence is 1, the interval of convergence is:\n\n$-1 < z < 1$\n\nIn conclusion, the radius of convergence is 1, and the interval of convergence is $(-1, 1)$."
