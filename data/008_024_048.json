    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the system of linear equations:\n\nx + 2y - z = 7 (1)\n\n2x - 4y + 2z = -14 (2)\n\n3x + 6y - 3z = 21 (3)\n\nNow, let's divide equation (2) by 2 and equation (3) by 3:\n\nx - 2y + z = -7 (2')\n\nx + 2y - z = 7 (3')\n\nNow we have:\n\nx + 2y - z = 7 (1)\n\nx - 2y + z = -7 (2')\n\nx + 2y - z = 7 (3')\n\nWe can see that equation (1) and equation (3') are the same, so we can eliminate one of them. We are left with:\n\nx + 2y - z = 7 (1)\n\nx - 2y + z = -7 (2')\n\nNow, let's add equation (1) and equation (2'):\n\nx + 2y - z + x - 2y + z = 7 - 7\n\n2x = 0\n\nx = 0\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into equation (1) to find the relationship between y and z:\n\n0 + 2y - z = 7\n\n2y - z = 7\n\nz = 2y - 7\n\nSince there are multiple solutions, we can express the solution in terms of a parameter, let's say t:\n\ny = t\n\nz = 2t - 7\n\nThe general solution for this system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 0\ny = t\nz = 2t - 7\n\nwhere t can be any real number."
