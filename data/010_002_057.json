    "message_2": "In the given topological space X, we have the sequence (1/n) for n going to infinity. As n approaches infinity, the value of 1/n approaches 0. However, we need to verify if 0 is indeed the limit in this specific topology.\n\nRecall the definition of a limit in a topological space: A point x in X is the limit of a sequence (x_n) if for every open neighborhood U of x, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, x_n belongs to U.\n\nIn our topology, the open sets containing 0 are {0}, {0,1,2}, and {0,1,2,3,4}. Let's check if 0 is the limit of the sequence (1/n) with respect to these open sets.\n\n1. For the open set {0}, there is no natural number N such that for all n > N, 1/n belongs to {0}, since 1/n is never equal to 0 for any natural number n. Thus, 0 is not the limit of the sequence (1/n) in this topology.\n\nSince 0 is not the limit of the sequence (1/n) in this topology, there is no limit for the sequence (1/n) in the given topological space X."
