    "message_2": "To show that $Z(\\Sigma)$ is a direct sum of $d^{2g}$ one-dimensional vector spaces, we will use the properties of topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) and the structure of closed Riemann surfaces.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case of a torus, which is a closed Riemann surface of genus $g=1$. According to the axioms of TQFT, the vector space associated with a torus is $Z(T^2)$. Since a torus can be obtained by gluing two cylinders along their boundaries, we can write $Z(T^2) = Z(C_1) \\otimes Z(C_2)$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are cylinders. \n\nNow, consider the case of a closed Riemann surface of genus $g=2$. This surface can be obtained by gluing two tori along a cylinder. Using the axioms of TQFT, we can write $Z(\\Sigma_2) = Z(T^2_1) \\otimes Z(T^2_2)$. Since we already know the structure of $Z(T^2)$, we can write $Z(\\Sigma_2) = (Z(C_1) \\otimes Z(C_2))^2$.\n\nIn general, for a closed Riemann surface of genus $g$, we can obtain the surface by gluing $g$ tori along cylinders. Therefore, we can write $Z(\\Sigma_g) = (Z(C_1) \\otimes Z(C_2))^g$. \n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of the vector space associated with a cylinder. Since a cylinder can be obtained by gluing two circles along their boundaries, we can write $Z(C) = Z(S^1) \\otimes Z(S^1)$. According to the axioms of TQFT, the vector space associated with a circle is a direct sum of $d$ one-dimensional vector spaces, i.e., $Z(S^1) = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^d \\mathbb{C}$. Therefore, we can write $Z(C) = (\\bigoplus_{i=1}^d \\mathbb{C})^2 = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^{d^2} \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nFinally, we can write the vector space associated with a closed Riemann surface of genus $g$ as $Z(\\Sigma_g) = (\\bigoplus_{i=1}^{d^2} \\mathbb{C})^g = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^{d^{2g}} \\mathbb{C}$, which is a direct sum of $d^{2g}$ one-dimensional vector spaces, as required."
