The scores are not normally distributed, so the student decides to use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the groups. \n\nThe test scores for the first group are: 59, 71, 82, 63, 68, 54, 91, 72, 77, 86, 68, 69, 61, 76, 80, 74, 63, 78, 52, 75.\n\nThe test scores for the second group are: 76, 56, 88, 69, 53, 62, 94, 72, 71, 82, 55, 70, 64, 83, 91, 63, 78, 69, 77, 66, 63, 74, 79, 75, 62.\n\nWhat is the probability of getting a score at least as extreme as the one for the second group, assuming that the samples come from the same continuous distribution?",

Combined and ranked test scores:\n52(1), 53(2), 54(3), 55(4), 56(5), 59(6), 61(7), 62(8), 62(9), 63(10), 63(11), 63(12), 64(13), 66(14), 68(15), 68(16), 69(17), 69(18), 69(19), 70(20), 71(21), 71(22), 72(23), 72(24), 74(25), 74(26), 75(27), 75(28), 76(29), 76(30), 77(31), 77(32), 78(33), 78(34), 79(35), 80(36), 82(37), 82(38), 83(39), 86(40), 88(41), 91(42), 91(43), 94(44)\n\n2. Sum of ranks for each group:\nGroup 1: 6+7+10+11+15+16+17+21+23+29+30+31+33+36+37+40+42+43 = 430\nGroup 2: 1+2+3+4+5+8+9+12+13+14+18+19+20+22+24+25+26+27+28+32+34+35+38+39+41+44 = 595\n\n3. Test statistic W for the second group: W = 595\n\n4. To determine the critical value for the test statistic W, we need to find the critical value for the Wilcoxon rank-sum test at a specific significance level (e.g., 0.05). However, since we have a large sample size (20 and 25), we can use the normal approximation to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We need to calculate the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the distribution of W under the null hypothesis:\n\nμ = n1 * (n1 + n2 + 1) / 2 = 20 * (20 + 25 + 1) / 2 = 20 * 46 / 2 = 460\nσ = sqrt(n1 * n2 * (n1 + n2 + 1) / 12) = sqrt(20 * 25 * 46 / 12) = sqrt(23000 / 3) ≈ 27.67\n\n5. Calculate the z-score and the probability of getting a score at least as extreme as the one for the second group:\n\nz = (W - μ) / σ = (595 - 460) / 27.67 ≈ 4.88\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the probability of getting a z-score of 4.88 or more extreme is very close to 0 (less than 0.0001). This means that there is a very low probability of getting a score at least as extreme as the one for the second group, assuming that the samples come from the same continuous distribution."
