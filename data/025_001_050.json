    "message_1": "A student is trying to find the intersection points of two polynomial curves using Bezout's theorem. The equations of the curves are:\n\n$y=2x^3 - 4x^2 -4x+4$ \n\nand \n\n$y=4x^2-4x+3$\n\nWhat are the number of intersection points between these curves if we consider complex plane?",
    "message_2": "To find the intersection points of the two curves, we need to set their equations equal to each other:\n\n$2x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4x^2 - 4x + 3$\n\nNow, we need to solve for $x$. Rearrange the equation:\n\n$2x^3 - 8x^2 + 4x - 1 = 0$\n\nThis is a cubic equation. According to Bezout's theorem, the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees. In this case, the degree of the first curve is 3 (since it's a cubic equation) and the degree of the second curve is 2 (since it's a quadratic equation).\n\nTherefore, the number of intersection points between these curves in the complex plane is:\n\n$3 \\times 2 = 6$\n\nSo, there are 6 intersection points between these curves in the complex plane."
