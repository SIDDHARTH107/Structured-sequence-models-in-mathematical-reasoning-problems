    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 7 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 9 cm. What is the total surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism is:\n\nSurface Area = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we have:\n\nl = 7 cm\nw = 4 cm\nh = 9 cm\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2(7)(4) + 2(7)(9) + 2(4)(9)\nSurface Area = 2(28) + 2(63) + 2(36)\nSurface Area = 56 + 126 + 72\n\nAdding these values together, we get:\n\nSurface Area = 254 cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of the rectangular prism is 254 cm²."
