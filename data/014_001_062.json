    "message_1": "Suppose that you want to use RSA public key encryption system to send a message, and the public key is (n, e) = (3233, 17). If you want to send the message M = 1234, then what is the corresponding ciphertext C? (Hint: In RSA encryption, C = M^e mod n)",
    "message_2": "To compute the ciphertext C, we use the formula C = M^e mod n, where M is the message, e is the public exponent, and n is the modulus.\n\nIn this case, M = 1234, e = 17, and n = 3233.\n\nC = 1234^17 mod 3233\n\nTo calculate this, you can use a calculator or a programming language that supports large numbers, such as Python.\n\nUsing Python:\n\nC = pow(1234, 17, 3233)\nC = 855\n\nSo, the corresponding ciphertext C is 855."
