    "message_1": "The problem is: Find all the possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 32, and determine which of the six non-abelian groups of order 32 each of those isomorphism classes contains.",
    "message_2": "To find all the possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 32, we will use the fact that the order of a group is equal to the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. Since 32 = 2^5, we are looking for groups with a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32.\n\nWe will use the following notation: C_n denotes the cyclic group of order n, and C_n × C_m denotes the direct product of cyclic groups of order n and m.\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 32: There is only one such group, which is C_32.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: There is only one possibility, C_16 × C_2. This group is abelian.\n\n3. Direct product of three cyclic groups: There are two possibilities, C_8 × C_4 × C_2 and C_8 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2. Both of these groups are abelian.\n\n4. Direct product of four cyclic groups: There is only one possibility, C_4 × C_4 × C_2 × C_2. This group is abelian.\n\n5. Direct product of five cyclic groups: There is only one possibility, C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2. This group is abelian.\n\nNow, we have found all the abelian groups of order 32. There are six non-abelian groups of order 32, and we need to determine which isomorphism classes they belong to.\n\n1. The dihedral group D_32: This group has a presentation ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, bab = a^(-1)⟩. It is non-abelian and has an element of order 16, so it cannot be a direct product of smaller cyclic groups. Thus, it is not isomorphic to any of the abelian groups we found.\n\n2. The quaternion group Q_32: This group has a presentation ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^4 = 1, bab = a^(-1)⟩. It is non-abelian and has an element of order 16, so it cannot be a direct product of smaller cyclic groups. Thus, it is not isomorphic to any of the abelian groups we found.\n\n3. The semidirect product of C_16 and C_2: This group has a presentation ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, bab = a^9⟩. It is non-abelian and has an element of order 16, so it cannot be a direct product of smaller cyclic groups. Thus, it is not isomorphic to any of the abelian groups we found.\n\n4. The semidirect product of C_8 × C_2 and C_2: This group has a presentation ⟨a, b, c | a^8 = b^2 = c^2 = 1, ab = ba, ac = ca, bc = a^(-1)bc⟩. It is non-abelian and has an element of order 8, so it cannot be a direct product of smaller cyclic groups. Thus, it is not isomorphic to any of the abelian groups we found.\n\n5. The semidirect product of C_4 × C_4 and C_2: This group has a presentation ⟨a, b, c | a^4 = b^4 = c^2 = 1, ab = ba, ac = a^(-1)ca, bc = b^(-1)cb⟩. It is non-abelian and has an element of order 4, so it cannot be a direct product of smaller cyclic groups. Thus, it is not isomorphic to any of the abelian groups we found.\n\n6. The semidirect product of C_2 × C_2 × C_2 and C_2: This group has a presentation ⟨a, b, c, d | a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = d^2 = 1, ab = ba, ac = ca, ad = da, bc = cb, bd = a^(-1)cb, cd = ab^(-1)c⟩. It is non-abelian and has an element of order 2, so it cannot be a direct product of smaller cyclic groups. Thus, it is not isomorphic to any of the abelian groups we found.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found 5 abelian isomorphism classes of groups of order 32: C_32, C_16 × C_2, C_8 × C_4 × C_2, C_8 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2, and C_4 × C_4 × C_2 × C_2. The six non-abelian groups of order 32 are not isomorphic to any of these abelian groups."
