    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = t^2 * e^(-3t), we use the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * f(t)) dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nIn this case, f(t) = t^2 * e^(-3t), so we have:\n\nF(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * t^2 * e^(-3t)) dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nCombine the exponential terms:\n\nF(s) = ∫(t^2 * e^(-(s+3)t)) dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts to solve this integral. Integration by parts states that:\n\n∫(u * dv) = uv - ∫(v * du)\n\nLet's choose u = t^2 and dv = e^(-(s+3)t) dt. Then, we have:\n\ndu = 2t dt\nv = -1/(s+3) * e^(-(s+3)t)\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\nF(s) = -t^2/(s+3) * e^(-(s+3)t) | from 0 to ∞ - ∫(-2t/(s+3) * e^(-(s+3)t)) dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nThe first term goes to 0 as t goes to infinity, so we are left with:\n\nF(s) = 2/(s+3) * ∫(t * e^(-(s+3)t)) dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we need to apply integration by parts again. Let's choose u = t and dv = e^(-(s+3)t) dt. Then, we have:\n\ndu = dt\nv = -1/(s+3) * e^(-(s+3)t)\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\nF(s) = 2/(s+3) * (-t/(s+3) * e^(-(s+3)t) | from 0 to ∞ + ∫(1/(s+3) * e^(-(s+3)t)) dt, from 0 to ∞)\n\nThe first term goes to 0 as t goes to infinity, so we are left with:\n\nF(s) = 2/(s+3) * (1/(s+3) * ∫(e^(-(s+3)t)) dt, from 0 to ∞)\n\nNow, we can integrate the remaining exponential term:\n\nF(s) = 2/(s+3) * (1/(s+3) * (-1/(s+3) * e^(-(s+3)t)) | from 0 to ∞)\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\nF(s) = 2/(s+3) * (1/(s+3) * (-1/(s+3) * (0 - 1)))\n\nF(s) = 2/(s+3) * (1/(s+3) * (1/(s+3)))\n\nF(s) = 2/((s+3)^3)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = t^2 * e^(-3t) is:\n\nF(s) = 2/((s+3)^3)"
