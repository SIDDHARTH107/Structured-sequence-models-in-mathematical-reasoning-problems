    "message_1": "What is the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism with a length of 12 cm, a width of 8 cm, and a height of 10 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nIn this case, the length is 12 cm, the width is 8 cm, and the height is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiagonal length = √(12² + 8² + 10²)\nDiagonal length = √(144 + 64 + 100)\nDiagonal length = √(308)\nDiagonal length ≈ 17.54 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 17.54 cm."
