    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon curve is a fractal curve that is created by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold makes a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nAfter each iteration, the number of segments in the curve doubles, and the length of each segment is divided by the square root of 2. This is because each segment is now part of a right-angled triangle with the original segment as the hypotenuse.\n\nAfter 10 iterations, the number of segments is 2^10 = 1024. The length of each segment after 10 iterations is (1/sqrt(2))^10 = (1/2^5) = 1/32.\n\nThe total length of the Heighway Dragon curve after 10 iterations is the product of the number of segments and the length of each segment:\n\nTotal length = (number of segments) * (length of each segment)\nTotal length = 1024 * (1/32)\nTotal length = 32 units."
