    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I must clarify that the concept of an integer that cannot be computed by any algorithm is not well-defined. Algorithms are designed to compute or solve specific problems, and any integer can be represented and manipulated within the framework of mathematics and computer science.\n\nHowever, there is a concept in computer science called \"uncomputable numbers\" or \"non-computable numbers,\" which refers to real numbers that cannot be precisely computed by any algorithm. These numbers are usually related to problems that are undecidable or have no algorithmic solution. One famous example is the halting problem, which is a decision problem that cannot be solved by an algorithm.\n\nIn summary, there is no smallest possible integer that cannot be computed by any algorithm, as integers can be represented and manipulated within the framework of mathematics and computer science. The concept of uncomputable numbers applies to real numbers, not integers."
