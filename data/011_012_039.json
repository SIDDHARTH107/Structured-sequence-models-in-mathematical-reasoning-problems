    "message_2": "Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can find the number of students taking at least one language course by adding the number of students taking each language course and then subtracting the number of students taking both courses (to avoid double-counting).\n\nSo, the number of students taking at least one language course is:\n\n(Number of students taking Spanish) + (Number of students taking French) - (Number of students taking both Spanish and French)\n\n= 20 + 30 - 15\n\n= 35\n\nTherefore, 35 students take at least one language course."
