    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg of length 9 cm and the hypotenuse of length 15 cm. Find the length of the other leg using the Pythagorean theorem.",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's denote the length of the unknown leg as \"a\" and the given leg as 9 cm and the hypotenuse as 15 cm. The theorem can be written as:\n\na^2 + 9^2 = 15^2\n\nNow, we can solve for \"a\":\n\na^2 + 81 = 225\n\nSubtract 81 from both sides:\n\na^2 = 144\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\na = âˆš144\n\na = 12\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 12 cm."
