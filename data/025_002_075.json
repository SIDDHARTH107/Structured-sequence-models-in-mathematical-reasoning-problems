    "message_2": "To find the degree of the curve $C$ in $V$, we first need to find the intersection of $V$ with the plane $x=1$. Substitute $x=1$ into the equations defining $V$:\n\n1. $1^2 + y^2 - 4z = 1 + y^2 - 4z = 0$\n2. $1 + y + z - 1 = y + z = 0$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables, $y$ and $z$:\n\n1. $y^2 - 4z = -1$\n2. $y + z = 0$\n\nFrom equation (2), we have $z = -y$. Substitute this into equation (1):\n\n$y^2 - 4(-y) = -1$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$y^2 + 4y = -1$\n\nNow complete the square:\n\n$(y + 2)^2 - 4 = -1$\n\n$(y + 2)^2 = 3$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in $y$, which means that the degree of the curve $C$ in $V$ is 2."
