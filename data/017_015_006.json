    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 24: 24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n2. List all possible divisors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n\nNow, we will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of groups of order 24.\n\n3. Determine the number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime divisor:\n   - For p = 2, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is denoted by n_2, and n_2 must divide 3^1 (the power of the other prime in the factorization) and n_2 must be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3.\n   - For p = 3, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is denoted by n_3, and n_3 must divide 2^3 (the power of the other prime in the factorization) and n_3 must be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible group structures based on the Sylow p-subgroups:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\n- This case corresponds to a group with a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal, and the group is a direct product of these subgroups. This gives us one group, which is isomorphic to Z_8 x Z_3 (the direct product of the cyclic groups of order 8 and 3).\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\n- This case corresponds to a group with a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. The unique Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, and we can form a semidirect product with one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. This gives us one group, which is isomorphic to Z_8 ⋊ Z_3 (the semidirect product of the cyclic groups of order 8 and 3).\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\n- This case corresponds to a group with three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. The unique Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, and we can form a semidirect product with one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. There are two possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup: Z_8 or Z_4 x Z_2. This gives us two groups: Z_3 ⋊ Z_8 and Z_3 ⋊ (Z_4 x Z_2).\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\n- This case corresponds to a group with three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. There are no normal subgroups in this case, so we cannot form a direct or semidirect product. However, we can still have a group with this structure, which is the symmetric group S_4.\n\nIn total, we have found 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 24:\n\n1. Z_8 x Z_3\n2. Z_8 ⋊ Z_3\n3. Z_3 ⋊ Z_8\n4. Z_3 ⋊ (Z_4 x Z_2)\n5. S_4"
