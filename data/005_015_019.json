Using cluster analysis, the company has identified three clusters of customers with the following average spending per month: \n\n- Cluster 1: $250\n- Cluster 2: $450\n- Cluster 3: $600\n\nIf a new customer has a monthly spending of $500, which cluster does he/she belong to?",
    "message_2": "To determine which cluster the new customer belongs to, we can calculate the difference between the new customer's monthly spending and the average spending of each cluster. The new customer will belong to the cluster with the smallest difference.\n\nDifference with Cluster 1: |$500 - $250| = $250\nDifference with Cluster 2: |$500 - $450| = $50\nDifference with Cluster 3: |$500 - $600| = $100\n\nThe smallest difference is with Cluster 2, so the new customer belongs to Cluster 2."
