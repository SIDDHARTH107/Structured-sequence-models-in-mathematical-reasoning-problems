    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2, we first need to find the first derivative of the function with respect to x.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points of the function.\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first factor out the greatest common divisor, which is 3:\n\n3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n3(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\nThe critical points are the values of x that make this equation true:\n\nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\nx - 3 = 0 => x = 3\n\nThus, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 are x = 1 and x = 3."
