    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 48 and 60, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (60) by the smaller number (48) and find the remainder.\n60 รท 48 = 1 with a remainder of 12.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (60) with the smaller number (48) and the smaller number with the remainder (12).\nNow we need to find the GCD of 48 and 12.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (48) by the smaller number (12) and find the remainder.\n48 รท 12 = 4 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 12. So, the GCD of 48 and 60 is 12."
