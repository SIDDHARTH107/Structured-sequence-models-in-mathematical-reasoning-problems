    "message_1": "A delivery truck can take two different routes to deliver 10 packages: Route A takes 3 hours to complete with a cost of $50 for gas, while Route B takes 4 hours to complete with a cost of $40 for gas. The company charges a delivery fee of $2 per package. Assuming the truck can carry all 10 packages at once, which route should the driver take to minimize the cost per package?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost per package, we need to calculate the total cost for each route and then divide it by the number of packages (10). \n\nFor Route A:\nTime: 3 hours\nGas cost: $50\nDelivery fee: $2 per package * 10 packages = $20\nTotal cost for Route A: $50 (gas) + $20 (delivery fee) = $70\n\nCost per package for Route A: $70 / 10 packages = $7 per package\n\nFor Route B:\nTime: 4 hours\nGas cost: $40\nDelivery fee: $2 per package * 10 packages = $20\nTotal cost for Route B: $40 (gas) + $20 (delivery fee) = $60\n\nCost per package for Route B: $60 / 10 packages = $6 per package\n\nSince the cost per package for Route B ($6) is less than the cost per package for Route A ($7), the driver should take Route B to minimize the cost per package."
