    "message_2": "To solve the integral ∫cos(2x) dx from 0 to π/4, we can use the substitution method and the double angle formula for cosine. The double angle formula for cosine is:\n\ncos(2x) = 2cos^2(x) - 1\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n∫(2cos^2(x) - 1) dx\n\nNext, we can find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n\n∫(2cos^2(x) - 1) dx = 2∫cos^2(x) dx - ∫1 dx\n\nTo find the antiderivative of cos^2(x), we can use the power reduction formula:\n\ncos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\n2∫(1 + cos(2x))/2 dx - ∫1 dx\n\nSimplify and integrate:\n\n∫(1 + cos(2x)) dx - ∫1 dx\n\nNow, find the antiderivative of each term:\n\nx + (1/2)∫cos(2x) dx - x\n\nTo find the antiderivative of cos(2x), we can use substitution. Let u = 2x, so du/dx = 2, and dx = du/2:\n\n(1/2)∫cos(u) (du/2)\n\nIntegrate:\n\n(1/4)(sin(u)) + C\n\nNow, substitute back for x:\n\n(1/4)(sin(2x)) + C\n\nSo, the antiderivative of the original integrand is:\n\nx + (1/4)(sin(2x)) - x\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral from 0 to π/4:\n\n[(π/4) + (1/4)sin(2(π/4))] - [(0) + (1/4)sin(2(0))]\n\nSimplify:\n\n(π/4) + (1/4)sin(π/2) - 0\n\nSince sin(π/2) = 1, the integral evaluates to:\n\n(π/4) + (1/4)\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n(π + 1)/4\n\nSo, the integral value of ∫cos(2x) dx from 0 to π/4 is (π + 1)/4."
