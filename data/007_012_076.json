    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p). In other words, (p-1)! + 1 is a multiple of p.\n\nWe are looking for the smallest integer greater than 1 whose factorial equals 1 more than a multiple of 41. Let's denote this integer as n. So, we have:\n\n(n-1)! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 41)\n\nSince 41 is a prime number, we can apply Wilson's theorem:\n\n(41-1)! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 41)\n\n40! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 41)\n\nSo, the smallest integer greater than 1 whose factorial equals 1 more than a multiple of 41 is n = 41."
