    "message_1": "A ship is sailing from port A to port B, which are 100 km apart. The ship's captain wants to know the distance the ship has traveled if he sailed due west for 40 km, then turned 60 degrees north of west and sailed another 60 km. What is the distance the ship traveled?",
    "message_2": "To find the total distance the ship traveled, we need to break down the second part of the journey into its westward and northward components. \n\nSince the ship turned 60 degrees north of west, we can use the sine and cosine functions to find the westward and northward components of the 60 km journey.\n\nWestward component = 60 * cos(60°) = 60 * (1/2) = 30 km\nNorthward component = 60 * sin(60°) = 60 * (√3/2) = 30√3 km\n\nNow, we can find the total westward and northward distances traveled:\n\nTotal westward distance = 40 km (initial westward journey) + 30 km (westward component of the second part) = 70 km\nTotal northward distance = 30√3 km (northward component of the second part)\n\nTo find the total distance traveled, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nTotal distance = √(total westward distance² + total northward distance²)\nTotal distance = √(70² + (30√3)²)\nTotal distance = √(4900 + 2700)\nTotal distance = √7600 ≈ 87.18 km\n\nSo, the ship traveled approximately 87.18 km."
