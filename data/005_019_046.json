    "message_1": "A factory produces three types of products: A, B, and C. On any given day, the probability of producing product A is 0.4, the probability of producing product B is 0.3, and the probability of producing product C is 0.3. If today's production is product A, what is the probability that tomorrow's production will be product B? Assume that the probability of tomorrow's production depends only on today's production.",
    "message_2": "Since the problem states that the probability of tomorrow's production depends only on today's production, we can assume that the probabilities remain constant. Therefore, if today's production is product A, the probability that tomorrow's production will be product B is still 0.3."
