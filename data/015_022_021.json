    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a nonlinear delay differential equation given by:\n\ndx(t)/dt = α * x(t-τ) / (1 + x(t-τ)^n) - β * x(t)\n\nwhere α, β, τ, and n are positive parameters, and x(t) is the state variable. The equation is known for exhibiting chaotic behavior for certain parameter values.\n\nThe smallest positive value of the parameter α for which the Mackey-Glass equation exhibits chaotic behavior depends on the values of the other parameters (β, τ, and n). However, it is widely known that chaotic behavior occurs for α > 0.5 when τ = 2 and n = 10, keeping β = 0.1. \n\nIt is important to note that the exact threshold for chaotic behavior may vary depending on the specific values of the other parameters and initial conditions."
