    "message_1": "A furniture manufacturer wants to make a dining table with a maximum of 10 feet long and 6 feet wide. There are two models available, Model A and Model B, each made of oak or maple wood. Model A requires 5 hours of labor to produce and Model B requires 7 hours of labor. The manufacturer only has 30 labor hours available. The profit for each table produced with Model A is $500 and for Model B is $700. The manufacturer wants to know how many of each model to produce to maximize the profit.\n\nThe mathematical formulation of this problem corresponds to a mixed-integer linear program that the student needs to solve.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Model A tables produced and y be the number of Model B tables produced.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit = 500x + 700y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Size constraint: x <= 10 (Model A) and y <= 6 (Model B)\n2. Labor constraint: 5x + 7y <= 30\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x, y >= 0\n\nTo solve this mixed-integer linear program, we can use the graphical method.\n\nFirst, let's plot the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. x <= 10: This is a vertical line at x = 10.\n2. y <= 6: This is a horizontal line at y = 6.\n3. 5x + 7y <= 30: This is a line that passes through the points (0, 30/7) and (6, 0).\n\nThe feasible region is the area enclosed by these lines and the axes. We can find the corner points of the feasible region by finding the intersections of the constraint lines:\n\n1. (0, 0): Intersection of x-axis and y-axis.\n2. (0, 6): Intersection of y-axis and y <= 6.\n3. (10, 0): Intersection of x-axis and x <= 10.\n4. (10, 6): Intersection of x <= 10 and y <= 6.\n5. (6, 2): Intersection of 5x + 7y <= 30, x <= 10, and y <= 6.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the objective function at each corner point:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0) = 500(0) + 700(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0, 6) = 500(0) + 700(6) = $4,200\n3. Profit at (10, 0) = 500(10) + 700(0) = $5,000\n4. Profit at (10, 6) = 500(10) + 700(6) = $9,200 (not feasible because it doesn't satisfy the labor constraint)\n5. Profit at (6, 2) = 500(6) + 700(2) = $5,200\n\nThe maximum profit is $5,200, which is achieved by producing 6 Model A tables and 2 Model B tables."
