    "message_1": "A teacher has 30 students in a class. 20 students like pizza, 18 students like hamburgers, and 12 students like both pizza and hamburgers. \n\nWhat is the number of students who do not like pizza or hamburgers?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe number of students who like pizza or hamburgers (or both) is the sum of the number of students who like pizza and the number of students who like hamburgers, minus the number of students who like both (to avoid double-counting).\n\nSo, the number of students who like pizza or hamburgers is:\n\n20 (pizza) + 18 (hamburgers) - 12 (both) = 26 students\n\nNow, we know there are 30 students in total. To find the number of students who do not like pizza or hamburgers, we subtract the number of students who like pizza or hamburgers from the total number of students:\n\n30 (total students) - 26 (students who like pizza or hamburgers) = 4 students\n\nTherefore, 4 students do not like pizza or hamburgers."
