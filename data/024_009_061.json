    "message_2": "The scalar curvature of a 2-dimensional surface, also known as Gaussian curvature, can be calculated using the formula:\n\nK = R / A\n\nwhere K is the scalar curvature, R is the radius of the sphere, and A is the area of the sphere.\n\nFor a sphere, the area A can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA = 4πR^2\n\nNow, let's plug in the given radius R = 5 units:\n\nA = 4π(5^2) = 100π\n\nNow, we can find the scalar curvature K:\n\nK = R / A = 5 / (100π) = 1 / (20π)\n\nSo, the scalar curvature of the sphere at any point on its surface is:\n\nK = 1 / (20π) units^(-1)"
