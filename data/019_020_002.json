    "message_2": "To prove that the language L is not regular using the pumping lemma, we will assume that L is regular and derive a contradiction.\n\nLet L be a regular language. According to the pumping lemma, there exists a pumping length p such that any string w in L with length |w| ≥ p can be divided into three parts, w = xyz, where:\n\n1. |y| > 0\n2. |xy| ≤ p\n3. For all i ≥ 0, the string xy^iz is also in L.\n\nNow, let's choose a string w = 0^p1^p, which is in L and has a length |w| = 2p ≥ p. According to the pumping lemma, we can divide w into three parts w = xyz, satisfying the conditions above.\n\nSince |xy| ≤ p, both x and y consist only of 0's. Let x = 0^a and y = 0^b, where a ≥ 0, b > 0, and a + b ≤ p. Then, z = 0^(p-a-b)1^p.\n\nNow, let's consider the string w' = xy^2z. This means we have:\n\nw' = xyyz = 0^a(0^b)(0^b)0^(p-a-b)1^p = 0^(a+2b)0^(p-a-b)1^p = 0^(p+b)1^p\n\nIn w', the number of 0's is p + b, and the number of 1's is p. Since b > 0, we have p + b > p, which means the number of 0's in w' is greater than the number of 1's. Therefore, w' is not in L.\n\nHowever, this contradicts the pumping lemma's statement that for all i ≥ 0, the string xy^iz is in L. This contradiction implies that our initial assumption that L is regular is false.\n\nHence, we have proven that the language L is not regular using the pumping lemma for regular languages."
