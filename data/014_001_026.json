    "message_1": "In RSA encryption, Bob uses the public key (91, 5) and Alice's message to him is 22. The encryption formula is C = M^e mod n, where C is the ciphertext, M is the original message, e is the public key exponent, and n is the modulus. What is the ciphertext that Bob will receive?",
    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext, we will use the encryption formula C = M^e mod n with the given values.\n\nM = 22 (Alice's message)\ne = 5 (public key exponent)\nn = 91 (modulus)\n\nC = 22^5 mod 91\n\nFirst, calculate 22^5:\n22^5 = 5,153,632\n\nNow, find the remainder when dividing by 91:\n5,153,632 mod 91 = 63\n\nSo, the ciphertext C that Bob will receive is 63."
