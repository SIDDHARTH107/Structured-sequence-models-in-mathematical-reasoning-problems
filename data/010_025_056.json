    "message_1": "A 2-dimensional closed surface S can be decomposed into two connected components N and M. If the fundamental group of N is isomorphic to Z (i.e., the group of integers), and the fundamental group of M is isomorphic to Z/3Z (i.e., the cyclic group of order 3), what is the fundamental group of S?",
    "message_2": "To determine the fundamental group of S, we need to consider the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which states that if a space X can be decomposed into two connected open sets U and V, then the fundamental group of X, denoted π₁(X), can be computed as the free product of the fundamental groups of U and V, with an amalgamation along their intersection.\n\nIn this case, let U = N and V = M, with their respective fundamental groups π₁(N) ≅ Z and π₁(M) ≅ Z/3Z. Since N and M are connected components of S, their intersection is non-empty, and we can assume it is connected as well. Let W = N ∩ M, and let π₁(W) be its fundamental group.\n\nNow, we need to consider the inclusion maps i: W → N and j: W → M. The Seifert-van Kampen theorem states that π₁(S) ≅ π₁(N) * π₁(M) / N(i,j), where N(i,j) is the normal subgroup generated by elements of the form i(w)j(w)⁻¹ for w in π₁(W).\n\nSince N and M are connected components of a 2-dimensional closed surface, it is reasonable to assume that their intersection W is a 1-dimensional circle. In this case, the fundamental group of W is also isomorphic to Z, i.e., π₁(W) ≅ Z.\n\nNow, we need to determine the normal subgroup N(i,j). Since π₁(N) ≅ Z and π₁(M) ≅ Z/3Z, we can represent elements of these groups as integers and integers modulo 3, respectively. Let w be an element of π₁(W), then i(w) = n and j(w) = m (mod 3) for some integers n and m.\n\nThe normal subgroup N(i,j) is generated by elements of the form i(w)j(w)⁻¹ = nm⁻¹ (mod 3), where m⁻¹ is the modular inverse of m modulo 3. Since m can only take values 1, 2, or 3 (mod 3), and their modular inverses are 1, 2, and 1, respectively, the normal subgroup N(i,j) is generated by elements of the form nm⁻¹ (mod 3) for n in Z.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of S is given by π₁(S) ≅ Z * Z/3Z / N(i,j) ≅ Z * Z/3Z / Z ≅ Z/3Z.\n\nIn conclusion, the fundamental group of the 2-dimensional closed surface S is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3, i.e., π₁(S) ≅ Z/3Z."
