    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of x, y, and z with respect to u and v.\n\nx_u = ∂x/∂u = cos v\nx_v = ∂x/∂v = -u sin v\n\ny_u = ∂y/∂u = sin v\ny_v = ∂y/∂v = u cos v\n\nz_u = ∂z/∂u = 2u\nz_v = ∂z/∂v = 0\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form (E, F, and G).\n\nE = <(x_u, y_u, z_u), (x_u, y_u, z_u)> = (cos v)^2 + (sin v)^2 + (2u)^2 = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <(x_u, y_u, z_u), (x_v, y_v, z_v)> = -u sin v cos v + u sin v cos v = 0\nG = <(x_v, y_v, z_v), (x_v, y_v, z_v)> = (u sin v)^2 + (u cos v)^2 = u^2\n\nNext, we compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form (L, M, and N).\n\nL = <(x_uu, y_uu, z_uu), N> = 0\nM = <(x_uv, y_uv, z_uv), N> = <(-sin v, cos v, 0), N> = 0\nN = <(x_vv, y_vv, z_vv), N> = <(-u cos v, -u sin v, 0), N> = -u\n\nHere, N is the normal vector to the surface.\n\nFinally, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nK = (0 * (-u) - 0^2) / ((1 + 4u^2) * u^2 - 0^2)\n\nAt the point u = 2 and v = π/4, we have:\n\nK = (0 * (-2) - 0^2) / ((1 + 4(2)^2) * (2)^2 - 0^2)\nK = 0 / (17 * 4)\nK = 0\n\nThe Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point (u, v) = (2, π/4) is 0."
