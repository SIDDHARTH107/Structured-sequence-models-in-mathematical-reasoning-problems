    "message_2": "To maximize the number of disconnected components, we need to minimize the number of edges in each component. A graph with the fewest edges is a tree, which has n-1 edges for n vertices. \n\nLet's consider the case where we have two disconnected components. One component will have 6 vertices (and thus 5 edges), and the other will have 1 vertex (and 0 edges). In this case, we only have 5 edges, which is less than the 10 edges given.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where we have three disconnected components. One component will have 5 vertices (and thus 4 edges), another will have 2 vertices (and 1 edge), and the last will have 1 vertex (and 0 edges). In this case, we have a total of 5 edges, which is still less than the 10 edges given.\n\nFinally, let's consider the case where we have four disconnected components. One component will have 4 vertices (and thus 3 edges), another will have 2 vertices (and 1 edge), and the last two will have 1 vertex each (and 0 edges). In this case, we have a total of 4 edges, which is still less than the 10 edges given.\n\nSince we cannot create more disconnected components without having fewer than 10 edges, the maximum number of disconnected components in a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges is not possible. The graph must be connected."
