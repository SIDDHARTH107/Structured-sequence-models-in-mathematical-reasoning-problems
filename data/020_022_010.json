    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The factory has 60 units of raw materials and 40 units of labor available. Each unit of Product A requires 2 units of raw materials and 1 unit of labor. Each unit of Product B requires 1 unit of raw materials and 2 units of labor. If the profit per unit of Product A is $20 and the profit per unit of Product B is $30, how many units of each type of product should the factory produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for raw materials and labor can be written as:\n\n2x + y ≤ 60 (raw materials constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 40 (labor constraint)\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 20x + 30y\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 60\ny ≤ -2x + 60\n\n2. x + 2y ≤ 40\ny ≤ -0.5x + 20\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. We will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:\n\n1. Intersection of 2x + y = 60 and x + 2y = 40:\nx = 20, y = 10\n\n2. Intersection of 2x + y = 60 and y = 0:\nx = 30, y = 0\n\n3. Intersection of x + 2y = 40 and x = 0:\nx = 0, y = 20\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit(20, 10) = 20(20) + 30(10) = 400 + 300 = $700\n2. Profit(30, 0) = 20(30) + 30(0) = 600 + 0 = $600\n3. Profit(0, 20) = 20(0) + 30(20) = 0 + 600 = $600\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the factory produces 20 units of Product A and 10 units of Product B, with a total profit of $700."
