    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on the ground. A person standing some distance away from the pole observes that the angle of elevation from his eye to the top of the pole is 60 degrees. The person then walks 20 meters closer to the pole, and the angle of elevation from his eye to the top of the pole becomes 75 degrees. How tall is the flagpole, to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the flagpole as h, the initial distance from the person to the flagpole as x, and the distance after the person walks 20 meters closer as x-20. We can use the tangent function to set up two equations:\n\n1) tan(60°) = h/x\n2) tan(75°) = h/(x-20)\n\nNow, we can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can solve equation (1) for h:\n\nh = x * tan(60°)\n\nNext, we can substitute this expression for h into equation (2):\n\ntan(75°) = (x * tan(60°)) / (x-20)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx * tan(75°) = x * tan(60°) - 20 * tan(60°)\n\nx * (tan(75°) - tan(60°)) = -20 * tan(60°)\n\nx = (-20 * tan(60°)) / (tan(75°) - tan(60°))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nx ≈ 39.97 meters\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the height of the flagpole by substituting x back into the expression for h:\n\nh = 39.97 * tan(60°)\n\nh ≈ 69.28 meters\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is approximately 69 meters to the nearest meter."
