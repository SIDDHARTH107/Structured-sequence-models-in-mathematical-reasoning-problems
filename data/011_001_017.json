    "message_1": "A hockey team has 15 players on their roster, but only 6 players can be on the ice at once. How many different lineups can the coach put together if they want to have different players on the ice each time?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of different lineups the coach can put together, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of players (15 in this case), k is the number of players on the ice at once (6 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(15, 6) = 15! / (6!(15-6)!)\n\nC(15, 6) = 15! / (6!9!)\n\nC(15, 6) = (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) × (9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(15, 6) = (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10) / (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(15, 6) = 5,005\n\nSo, the coach can put together 5,005 different lineups with different players on the ice each time."
