    "message_1": "Suppose a principal hires an agent to perform a task. The agent can choose between two effort levels: low effort with a cost of $10 and high effort with a cost of $25. The principal values high effort twice as much as low effort, and the agent's effort choice is unobservable by the principal. If the agent exerts high effort, the task is completed with probability 0.9. If the agent exerts low effort, the task is only completed with probability 0.5. If the task is not completed, both the principal and the agent receive a payoff of zero. If the task is completed, the principal receives a payoff of $100, and the agent receives a payoff of $50. \n\nWhat effort level should the principal offer the agent to incentivize high effort? Show your work.",
    "message_2": "To incentivize high effort, the principal needs to offer a contract that makes the agent's expected payoff from high effort greater than the expected payoff from low effort. Let's denote the payment for successful completion of the task as P.\n\nThe agent's expected payoff from high effort (E_high) is:\nE_high = 0.9 * (P - 25) + 0.1 * 0 - 25\n\nThe agent's expected payoff from low effort (E_low) is:\nE_low = 0.5 * (P - 10) + 0.5 * 0 - 10\n\nTo incentivize high effort, we need E_high > E_low. Let's set up the inequality and solve for P:\n\n0.9 * (P - 25) - 25 > 0.5 * (P - 10) - 10\n\n0.9P - 22.5 - 25 > 0.5P - 5 - 10\n\n0.4P > 12.5\n\nP > 31.25\n\nSo, the principal should offer the agent a payment of at least $31.25 for the successful completion of the task to incentivize high effort."
