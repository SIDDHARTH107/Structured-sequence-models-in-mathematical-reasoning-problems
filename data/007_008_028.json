    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, we have a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nIn this case, p = 19 (which is a prime number) and a = 7 (which is not divisible by 19). So, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n7^(19-1) ≡ 1 (mod 19)\n7^18 ≡ 1 (mod 19)\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when 7^17 is divided by 19. We can rewrite 7^17 as:\n\n7^17 = 7^(18-1) = 7^18 * 7^(-1)\n\nSince we know that 7^18 ≡ 1 (mod 19), we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n7^17 ≡ 1 * 7^(-1) (mod 19)\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverse of 7 modulo 19, which is the number x such that 7x ≡ 1 (mod 19). We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or trial and error to find this inverse. In this case, the modular inverse of 7 modulo 19 is 11, since 7 * 11 ≡ 77 ≡ 1 (mod 19).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n7^17 ≡ 1 * 11 (mod 19)\n7^17 ≡ 11 (mod 19)\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 7^17 is divided by 19 is 11."
