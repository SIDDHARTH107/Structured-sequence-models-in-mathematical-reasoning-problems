A random sample of 50 tires was taken and the mean lifespan was found to be 42,000 miles with a standard deviation of 2,500 miles. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifespan of the tires.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifespan of the tires, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence interval = x̄ ± (z * (s / √n))\n\nwhere:\nx̄ = sample mean = 42,000 miles\nz = z-score for a 95% confidence interval = 1.96 (from a standard normal distribution table)\ns = sample standard deviation = 2,500 miles\nn = sample size = 50 tires\n\nFirst, we will calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = s / √n = 2,500 / √50 ≈ 353.55\n\nNow, we will calculate the margin of error (ME):\n\nME = z * SE = 1.96 * 353.55 ≈ 692.96\n\nFinally, we will calculate the confidence interval:\n\nLower limit = x̄ - ME = 42,000 - 692.96 ≈ 41,307.04 miles\nUpper limit = x̄ + ME = 42,000 + 692.96 ≈ 42,692.96 miles\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifespan of the tires is approximately (41,307.04 miles, 42,692.96 miles)."
