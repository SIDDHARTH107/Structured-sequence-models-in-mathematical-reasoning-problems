    "message_1": "A company has a manufacturing plant in Boston that needs to ship goods to three different cities: New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. The cost of shipping one unit of goods from Boston to each of these cities is given in the following table:\n\n| Destination | Cost per unit |\n| ----------- | ------------- |\n| New York    | $10           |\n| Philadelphia | $15        |\n| Washington D.C. | $16     |\n\nThe manufacturing plant in Boston produces 70 units of goods. What is the optimal way to distribute these goods among the three cities in order to minimize the total shipping cost?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total shipping cost, the company should send as many units as possible to the city with the lowest shipping cost per unit. In this case, that city is New York with a cost of $10 per unit.\n\nSince the manufacturing plant produces 70 units of goods, the optimal way to distribute these goods is to send all 70 units to New York. This will result in a total shipping cost of 70 units * $10/unit = $700."
