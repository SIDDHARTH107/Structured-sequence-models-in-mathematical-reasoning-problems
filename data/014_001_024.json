    "message_2": "To find the private key (d, n) in RSA encryption, we need to know the values of p and q, where n = p * q. Since we only have the value of n (437), we need to find the prime factors of 437.\n\nThe prime factors of 437 are 19 and 23. So, p = 19 and q = 23.\n\nNext, we need to compute the Euler's totient function, φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1):\n\nφ(437) = (19 - 1) * (23 - 1) = 18 * 22 = 396\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverse of e (23) modulo φ(n) (396). In other words, we need to find a value of d such that:\n\ne * d ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n23 * d ≡ 1 (mod 396)\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find the modular inverse of 23 modulo 396:\n\nd = 167\n\nSo, the private key is (d, n) = (167, 437)."
