    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p. \n\nIn this problem, we have a = 7 and p = 13. According to Fermat's Little Theorem, 7^13 ≡ 7 (mod 13). \n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when 7^59 is divided by 13. We can rewrite 7^59 as (7^13)^4 * 7^3. Since 7^13 ≡ 7 (mod 13), we can replace 7^13 with 7 in the expression:\n\n(7^13)^4 * 7^3 ≡ (7)^4 * 7^3 (mod 13)\n\nNow, we just need to compute (7^4 * 7^3) mod 13:\n\n7^4 = 2401 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\n7^3 = 343 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\nSo, (7^4 * 7^3) mod 13 = (3 * 1) mod 13 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 7^59 is divided by 13 is 3."
