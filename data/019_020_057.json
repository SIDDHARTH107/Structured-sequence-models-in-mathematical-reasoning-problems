Assume that each step takes a constant time \"c\" and that n is a power of 2.\n\nFor example, if n is 8, how many steps will it take to sort the elements?",
    "message_2": "The Merge Sort algorithm works by recursively dividing the input array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves back together. The time complexity of the Merge Sort algorithm can be determined using the recurrence relation:\n\nT(n) = 2 * T(n/2) + n\n\nHere, T(n) represents the time complexity of sorting n elements, and n is the number of elements. Since each step takes a constant time \"c\", we can rewrite the recurrence relation as:\n\nT(n) = 2 * T(n/2) + c * n\n\nTo solve this recurrence relation, we can use the Master Theorem, which states that for a recurrence relation of the form:\n\nT(n) = a * T(n/b) + f(n)\n\nwhere a ≥ 1, b > 1, and f(n) is an asymptotically positive function, the time complexity can be determined based on the comparison between f(n) and n^(log_b(a)).\n\nIn our case, a = 2, b = 2, and f(n) = c * n. Therefore, n^(log_b(a)) = n^(log_2(2)) = n. Since f(n) = c * n, we have f(n) = Θ(n), which means f(n) and n^(log_b(a)) have the same growth rate.\n\nAccording to the Master Theorem, when f(n) = Θ(n^(log_b(a))), the time complexity is T(n) = Θ(n^(log_b(a)) * log(n)). In our case, this means:\n\nT(n) = Θ(n * log(n))\n\nSo, the time complexity of sorting n elements using the Merge Sort algorithm is Θ(n * log(n)).\n\nNow, let's find the number of steps it takes to sort 8 elements (n = 8):\n\nT(8) = c * 8 * log_2(8) = c * 8 * 3 = 24c\n\nIt will take 24 steps (with each step taking a constant time \"c\") to sort 8 elements using the Merge Sort algorithm."
