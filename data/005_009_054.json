    "message_2": "To find the median of a set of data, we first need to arrange the data in ascending order, which is already done in this case. Then, we find the middle value(s). If there is an odd number of data points, the median is the middle value. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\nIn this case, there are 8 data points, which is an even number. The two middle values are 30 and 40. To find the median, we take the average of these two values:\n\nMedian = (30 + 40) / 2 = 70 / 2 = 35\n\nSo, the median of this set of data is 35."
