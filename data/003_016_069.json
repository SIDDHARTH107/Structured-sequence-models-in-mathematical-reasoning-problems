    "message_2": "The given function is y = 2sin(3x - π/4). To find the phase shift, we need to look at the term inside the sine function, which is (3x - π/4).\n\nThe general form of a sine function with phase shift is y = A*sin(B(x - C)), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our case, we have A = 2, B = 3, and we need to find C. To do this, we can rewrite the term inside the sine function as follows:\n\n3x - π/4 = 3(x - C)\n\nNow, we can see that the term inside the sine function is in the form B(x - C), so we can equate the coefficients:\n\n3 = 3\n-π/4 = -3C\n\nNow, we can solve for C:\n\n-π/4 = -3C\nC = (π/4) / 3\nC = π/12\n\nSo, the phase shift is π/12 units. Since the phase shift is positive, the function has been horizontally shifted to the right by π/12 units."
