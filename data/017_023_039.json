    "message_2": "There are 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 72. One example of a non-abelian group of order 72 that is not isomorphic to either the cyclic group C72 or the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2 is the semidirect product of C9 and C8, denoted as C9 ⋊ C8.\n\nTo construct this group, let α be a generator of C9 and β be a generator of C8. Define the action of β on α as follows:\n\nβ(α) = α^2\n\nThen, the semidirect product C9 ⋊ C8 can be represented as the set of elements {α^i β^j | 0 ≤ i ≤ 8, 0 ≤ j ≤ 7} with the following multiplication rule:\n\n(α^i β^j)(α^k β^l) = α^i β^j α^k β^l = α^i α^(2j * k) β^j β^l = α^(i + 2j * k) β^(j + l)\n\nThis group is non-abelian and not isomorphic to either C72 or A4 × C3 × C2."
