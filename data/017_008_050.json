    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct groups of order 8, we will first look at the possible structures of these groups based on the Sylow theorems. Since 8 = 2^3, we know that the groups we are considering have a p-group structure for p = 2.\n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in a group of order 8 must divide the order of the group (8) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibilities are 1 and 4. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be normal, and the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. In this case, the group is a direct product of a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C8.\n\nIf there are four Sylow 2-subgroups, we can analyze the structure of the group further. Let G be a group of order 8 with four Sylow 2-subgroups. Let P be one of these subgroups. Since the order of P is 4, P is either isomorphic to C4 (cyclic group of order 4) or V4 (Klein four-group). \n\n1. If P is isomorphic to C4, then P has an element of order 4. Let x be an element of order 4 in G. Then, the subgroup generated by x, ⟨x⟩, has order 4. Since G has order 8, there must be another element y in G not in ⟨x⟩. The order of y must divide the order of G, so the order of y is either 2 or 4. If the order of y is 4, then ⟨y⟩ is another subgroup of order 4, and G is the dihedral group D4. If the order of y is 2, then the group generated by x and y, ⟨x, y⟩, has order 8, and G is the quaternion group Q8.\n\n2. If P is isomorphic to V4, then P has three elements of order 2. Let x, y, and z be these elements. Since G has order 8, there must be another element w in G not in P. The order of w must divide the order of G, so the order of w is either 2 or 4. If the order of w is 2, then G has five elements of order 2, which contradicts the fact that a group of order 8 can have at most four elements of order 2. Therefore, the order of w must be 4. In this case, G is the direct product of P and the cyclic group generated by w, which is isomorphic to C8.\n\nIn summary, there are three distinct groups of order 8: the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, and the dihedral group D4. Each of these groups is isomorphic to one of the groups described above."
