    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given system of equations:\n\n(1) 3x + 2y + iz = 5 + 4i\n(2) 2x - y - 4iz = -3 - 4i\n(3) 4x + 3y + (1 + i)z = 7 - i\n\nWe will eliminate x from equations (2) and (3). To do this, we will multiply equation (2) by 2 and equation (3) by -1:\n\n(2') 4x - 2y - 8iz = -6 - 8i\n(3') -4x - 3y - (1 + i)z = -7 + i\n\nNow, we will add equations (2') and (3'):\n\n(-5y - 7iz) = -13 - 7i\n(4) y = (13 + 7i)/5 + (7/5)iz\n\nNow, we will eliminate x from equations (1) and (3). To do this, we will multiply equation (1) by -4/3 and equation (3) by 3:\n\n(1') -4x - 8/3y - (4/3)iz = -20/3 - 16i/3\n(3'') 12x + 9y + 3(1 + i)z = 21 - 3i\n\nNow, we will add equations (1') and (3''):\n\n(5) y + (5/3 + 3i)z = 1 - 5i/3\n\nNow, we have two equations for y:\n\n(4) y = (13 + 7i)/5 + (7/5)iz\n(5) y = 1 - 5i/3 - (5/3 + 3i)z\n\nWe will equate the right-hand sides of equations (4) and (5):\n\n(13 + 7i)/5 + (7/5)iz = 1 - 5i/3 - (5/3 + 3i)z\n\nNow, we will solve for z:\n\n(7/5)iz + (5/3 + 3i)z = (8 - 12i)/15\nz(7i/5 + 5/3 + 3i) = (8 - 12i)/15\nz = (8 - 12i)/15 / (7i/5 + 5/3 + 3i)\nz = (8 - 12i) / (21 + 51i)\nz = (8 - 12i)(21 - 51i) / (21^2 + 51^2)\nz = (1008 + 420 - 648i - 102i^2) / (441 + 2601)\nz = (1008 + 420 + 648i + 102) / 3042\nz = (1530 + 648i) / 3042\nz = (255 + 108i) / 507\nz = 1/3 + 2i/3\n\nNow, we will substitute z back into equation (4) to find y:\n\ny = (13 + 7i)/5 + (7/5)i(1/3 + 2i/3)\ny = (13 + 7i)/5 + (7i/5)(1/3) + (7i/5)(2i/3)\ny = (13/5 + 7i/5) + (7i/15) + (14i^2/15)\ny = (13/5 + 7i/5) + (7i/15) - (14/15)\ny = (13 - 14 + 7i + 7i)/15\ny = (-1 + 14i)/15\ny = -1/15 + 14i/15\n\nNow, we will substitute y and z back into equation (1) to find x:\n\n3x + 2(-1/15 + 14i/15) + i(1/3 + 2i/3) = 5 + 4i\n3x - 2/15 + 28i/15 + 1/3i - 2/3 = 5 + 4i\n3x = 5 + 4i + 2/15 - 28i/15 - 1/3i + 2/3\n3x = 5 + 4i + 2/15 - 28i/15 - 5i/15 + 10/15\n3x = 5 + 4i - 26i/15 + 12/15\n3x = 5 + 4i - 26i/15 + 4/5\nx = (5/3) + (4 - 26/15)i\nx = (5/3) + (46/15)i\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations with complex coefficients is:\n\nx = (5/3) + (46/15)i\ny = -1/15 + 14i/15\nz = 1/3 + 2i/3"
