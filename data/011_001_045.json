    "message_2": "Since two specific students must be included in the committee, we need to choose the remaining 3 members from the 10 remaining students (12 - 2 = 10). This is a combination problem, as the order of the members does not matter.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 members from a group of 10 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n = 10 (total number of remaining students) and k = 3 (number of members to be chosen).\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\n= 10! / (3!7!)\n= (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n= 720 / 6\n= 120\n\nSo, there are 120 ways to form the committee with the two specific students included."
