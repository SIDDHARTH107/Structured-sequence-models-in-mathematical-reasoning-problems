    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting 3 heads in a row, you simply multiply the probability of getting a head on each individual flip. Since the probability of getting a head is 60% (0.6), the calculation is:\n\n0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.216\n\nSo, the probability of getting 3 heads in a row is 21.6%."
