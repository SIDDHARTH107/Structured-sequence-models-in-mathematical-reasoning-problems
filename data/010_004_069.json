    "message_2": "To determine whether this topology is compact, we need to check if every open cover of X has a finite subcover.\n\nThe given topology is the discrete topology, where every subset of X is open. Let's consider an open cover of X, which consists of the singletons {1}, {2}, {3}, and {4}. This open cover is already finite, and it covers the entire set X.\n\nSince every open cover of X has a finite subcover (in this case, the open cover itself), the topology on X is compact."
