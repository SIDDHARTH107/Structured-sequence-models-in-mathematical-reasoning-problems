    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$, we first need to compute its gradient, which consists of the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nA critical point occurs when the gradient is equal to the zero vector, i.e., when both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n$2x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n\n$2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nThus, there is only one critical point, $(0, 0)$.\n\nNow, we will use Morse theory to classify this critical point. To do so, we need to compute the Hessian matrix of $f$, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe Hessian matrix is constant, so it is the same at every point, including the critical point $(0, 0)$. To classify the critical point, we need to analyze the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. The eigenvalues of $H(f)$ are the solutions to the characteristic equation:\n\n$|H(f) - \\lambda I| = \\begin{vmatrix}\n2 - \\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2 - \\lambda\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= (2 - \\lambda)^2$\n\nThis equation has a double root at $\\lambda = 2$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, the Hessian matrix is positive definite, which means that the critical point $(0, 0)$ is a local minimum.\n\nIn conclusion, the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$ has one critical point at $(0, 0)$, which is a local minimum."
