    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it is not possible to write a precise numerical problem related to paraconsistent logic as it deals with concepts that do not involve numerical problems. Paraconsistent logic is a non-classical logic that deals with reasoning when contradictory information is present. It is concerned with identifying inconsistencies in reasoning and developing approaches to handle them. Instead, a question related to paraconsistent logic might be in the form of a logical puzzle or a scenario where conflicting information is presented, and the student is asked to come up with a strategy to handle it.",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are looking for a problem related to paraconsistent logic. Here is a logical puzzle that involves paraconsistent reasoning:\n\nScenario: You are a detective investigating a crime scene. You have three suspects: Alice, Bob, and Carol. You know that at least one of them is lying, but you don't know who. They each give you the following statements:\n\n1. Alice: \"Bob is guilty.\"\n2. Bob: \"Alice and Carol are both innocent.\"\n3. Carol: \"I am guilty.\"\n\nUsing paraconsistent logic, determine who is guilty and who is innocent.\n\nSolution: In paraconsistent logic, we can accept that some contradictions may exist. In this case, we have contradictory statements. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If Alice is lying, then Bob is innocent. Bob's statement would be true, meaning Alice and Carol are both innocent. But this would mean that Alice's statement is true, which is a contradiction.\n- If Bob is lying, then Alice or Carol (or both) are guilty. Since Bob's statement is false, it means at least one of them is guilty. If Alice is guilty, her statement would be true, which means Bob is also guilty. If Carol is guilty, her statement would be true, which means Alice is innocent.\n\nSo, using paraconsistent logic, we can conclude that the most plausible scenario is that Bob is lying, Alice is innocent, and Carol is guilty. This allows for the existence of contradictory statements without leading to an explosion of contradictions."
