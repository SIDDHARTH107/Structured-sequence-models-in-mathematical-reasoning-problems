    "message_2": "To analyze the stability of the system, we first find the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. Let Y(ω) be the Fourier transform of y(t), then the Fourier transform of y''(t) is (iω)^2 Y(ω). So, we have:\n\n(iω)^2 Y(ω) = -4Y(ω)\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = 0 if ω = 0\nY(ω) = - (iω)^2 / 4 if ω ≠ 0\n\nNow, let's find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to get the solution y(t):\n\ny(t) = F^(-1)[Y(ω)]\n\nSince Y(ω) is a piecewise function, we can find the inverse Fourier transform for each case:\n\nFor ω = 0, Y(ω) = 0, so the inverse Fourier transform is also 0.\n\nFor ω ≠ 0, Y(ω) = - (iω)^2 / 4, so the inverse Fourier transform is:\n\ny(t) = F^(-1)[- (iω)^2 / 4]\n\nNow, we know that the inverse Fourier transform of (iω)^2 is the second derivative of the delta function, δ''(t). So, we have:\n\ny(t) = -1/4 δ''(t)\n\nNow, we need to apply the initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = -1. Since y(t) = -1/4 δ''(t), we have:\n\ny(0) = -1/4 δ''(0) = 2\ny'(t) = 1/4 δ'(t)\ny'(0) = 1/4 δ'(0) = -1\n\nHowever, the initial conditions cannot be satisfied by the given solution y(t) = -1/4 δ''(t). This is because the delta function and its derivatives are not well-defined at t = 0. Therefore, we cannot determine the stability of the system using the Fourier transform method in this case."
