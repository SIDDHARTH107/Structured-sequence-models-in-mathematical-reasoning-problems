    "message_2": "The Dragon Curve is a fractal pattern that can be created by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The length of each stage of the Dragon Curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength of Stage n = Length of Stage 0 * (sqrt(2))^n\n\nIn this case, the length of Stage 0 is given as 1 unit, and we want to find the length of Stage 5.\n\nLength of Stage 5 = Length of Stage 0 * (sqrt(2))^5\nLength of Stage 5 = 1 * (sqrt(2))^5\nLength of Stage 5 = (2^(5/2))\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can first calculate the exponent:\n\n5/2 = 2.5\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the expression:\n\nLength of Stage 5 = 2^2.5\n\nUsing a calculator, we can find the value of 2^2.5:\n\n2^2.5 â‰ˆ 5.656854249\n\nTherefore, the length of Stage 5 of the Dragon Curve is approximately 5.656854249 units."
