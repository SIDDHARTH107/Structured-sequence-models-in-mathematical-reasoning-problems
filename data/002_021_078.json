    "message_1": "A circle has a radius of 5cm. Find the area of the sector if the central angle of the sector is 60 degrees.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) * π * r^2\n\nwhere the central angle is given as 60 degrees and the radius (r) is 5 cm.\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) * π * 5^2\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) * π * 25\n\nArea of sector = 25π/6\n\nTherefore, the area of the sector is 25π/6 square centimeters."
