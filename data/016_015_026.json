Each second-order Hilbert curve is formed by connecting four first-order Hilbert curves together. A first-order Hilbert curve consists of 4 line segments, each with a length of 1 unit.\n\nTo find the total length of a third-order Hilbert curve, we can calculate the total length of a second-order curve and then multiply it by 4.\n\nLength of a first-order Hilbert curve = 4 line segments * 1 unit = 4 units\n\nLength of a second-order Hilbert curve = 4 * (length of a first-order Hilbert curve) = 4 * 4 units = 16 units\n\nLength of a third-order Hilbert curve = 4 * (length of a second-order Hilbert curve) = 4 * 16 units = 64 units\n\nSo, the total length of a third-order Hilbert curve is 64 units."
