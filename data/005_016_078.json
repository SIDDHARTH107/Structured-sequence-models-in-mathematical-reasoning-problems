    "message_1": "Suppose you have a dataset that consists of 100 observations, each with two variables: X and Y. You want to classify these observations into two groups. You believe that the variable X is more important than the variable Y in making this classification.\n\nTo test your hypothesis, you decide to perform linear discriminant analysis using only the variable X. The mean of X for the first group is 5 and the mean of X for the second group is 10. The standard deviation of X for both groups is 3. \n\nIf you observe a new value of X=8, which group would you classify it in?",
    "message_2": "To classify the new observation with X=8, we can calculate the Mahalanobis distance for each group and choose the group with the smallest distance.\n\nThe Mahalanobis distance is given by the formula:\n\nD = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere D is the Mahalanobis distance, X is the observed value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFor the first group (mean = 5, standard deviation = 3):\n\nD1 = (8 - 5) / 3 = 1\n\nFor the second group (mean = 10, standard deviation = 3):\n\nD2 = (8 - 10) / 3 = -2/3 ≈ -0.67\n\nSince the Mahalanobis distance is smaller for the first group (D1 = 1) than for the second group (D2 ≈ -0.67), we would classify the new observation with X=8 into the first group."
