    "message_2": "To find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix A, we can use the following formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of A and adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = (1 * 4) - (2 * 3) = 4 - 6 = -2\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of A. To do this, we swap the elements in the main diagonal and change the sign of the other two elements:\n\nadj(A) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & -2 \\\\\n-3 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of A by multiplying the adjugate of A by the reciprocal of the determinant:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-2) * adj(A) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-2 & 1 \\\\\n1.5 & -0.5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nSo, the inverse of matrix A is:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-2 & 1 \\\\\n1.5 & -0.5\n\\end{bmatrix}"
