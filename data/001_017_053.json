    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x+3) - 2log(x) = log(x-2) for x, we will use the properties of logarithms to simplify and solve for x.\n\nStep 1: Combine the logarithms using the properties of logarithms.\nlog(x+3) - 2log(x) = log(x-2)\nlog(x+3) - log(x^2) = log(x-2) (using the property log(a^b) = b*log(a))\n\nStep 2: Use the property log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b) to combine the logarithms on the left side of the equation.\nlog((x+3)/x^2) = log(x-2)\n\nStep 3: Since the logarithms are equal, their arguments must also be equal.\n(x+3)/x^2 = x-2\n\nStep 4: Clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by x^2.\nx^2 * ((x+3)/x^2) = x^2 * (x-2)\nx+3 = x^3 - 2x^2\n\nStep 5: Rearrange the equation to form a polynomial.\nx^3 - 2x^2 - x - 3 = 0\n\nStep 6: Solve the polynomial equation for x.\nUnfortunately, this polynomial does not have a simple algebraic solution. We can use numerical methods (such as the Newton-Raphson method) or graphing techniques to approximate the solutions for x. Alternatively, you can use a calculator or computer software to find the approximate solutions.\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that the approximate real solution for x is:\nx â‰ˆ 3.2956"
