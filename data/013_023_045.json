    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player 1 is given $10 and can choose to send any amount to Player 2. This amount is then tripled, and Player 2 has the option to send any portion of the tripled amount back to Player 1. What amount should Player 1 send to maximize their earnings if the game is played only once?",
    "message_2": "In the Trust Game, the optimal amount for Player 1 to send depends on the behavior of Player 2. If Player 2 is completely trustworthy and will return the maximum possible amount, then Player 1 should send the entire $10. This would result in Player 2 receiving $30 (3 * $10) and then returning as much as possible to Player 1.\n\nHowever, if Player 2 is not trustworthy and will not return any money, then Player 1 should send nothing to maximize their earnings, keeping the entire $10.\n\nIn a single play of the game, without any information about Player 2's behavior, it is impossible to determine the optimal amount for Player 1 to send. The best strategy would be for Player 1 to make an educated guess based on their knowledge of Player 2 or the general population's behavior in similar situations."
