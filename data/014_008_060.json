    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot perform encryption directly. However, I can guide you through the process of encrypting the plaintext \"MATHISFUN\" with the key \"SECRETKEY1234\" using AES-128.\n\n1. Convert the plaintext and key to hexadecimal format.\n2. Perform key expansion to generate the round keys.\n3. Perform the initial round of AddRoundKey.\n4. Perform 9 main rounds, which include SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey.\n5. Perform the final round, which includes SubBytes, ShiftRows, and AddRoundKey.\n6. Convert the resulting state back to text format.\n\nTo perform these steps, you can use an AES-128 encryption tool or library in a programming language like Python. Here's an example using Python's `cryptography` library:\n\n```python\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives import padding\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend\nimport base64\n\nkey = b'SECRETKEY1234'\nplaintext = b'MATHISFUN'\n\n# Pad the plaintext to fit the block size\npadder = padding.PKCS7(128).padder()\npadded_plaintext = padder.update(plaintext) + padder.finalize()\n\n# Encrypt the plaintext using AES-128 in ECB mode\ncipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.ECB(), backend=default_backend())\nencryptor = cipher.encryptor()\nciphertext = encryptor.update(padded_plaintext) + encryptor.finalize()\n\n# Encode the ciphertext in base64 for easier display\nencoded_ciphertext = base64.b64encode(ciphertext)\n\nprint(encoded_ciphertext)\n```\n\nPlease note that using ECB mode is not recommended for real-world applications due to its security weaknesses. Use a more secure mode like CBC or GCM instead."
