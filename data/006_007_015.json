    "message_1": "A math student is analyzing the probability of a certain stock price change. They are learning that the probability of a stock price increase is 0.6 and the probability of a decrease is 0.4. If the current stock price is $1000, what is the probability that the stock price will increase by $200?",
    "message_2": "The problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact probability of the stock price increasing by $200. We know the probability of the stock price increasing is 0.6 and the probability of it decreasing is 0.4, but we don't know the distribution of the possible price changes or the magnitude of the increases and decreases. \n\nTo find the probability of the stock price increasing by $200, we would need more information about the possible price changes and their associated probabilities."
