    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$, we first need to find its partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3y^2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -6xy\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y)$ where both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n$$\n3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n-6xy = 0\n$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have either $x = 0$ or $y = 0$. If $x = 0$, the first equation becomes $-3y^2 = 0$, which implies $y = 0$. So, we have a critical point at $(0, 0)$.\n\nIf $y = 0$, the first equation becomes $3x^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 0$. So, we have the same critical point at $(0, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the second partial derivatives of $f$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = -6x\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = -6y\n$$\n\nAt the critical point $(0, 0)$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}(0, 0) = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}(0, 0) = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y}(0, 0) = 0\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the Hessian matrix of $f$ at $(0, 0)$:\n\n$$\nH_f(0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nSince the Hessian matrix is singular (i.e., its determinant is zero), we cannot use the second derivative test to classify the critical point. Instead, we will use Morse theory.\n\nConsider the Morse function $g(x, y) = f(x, y) - f(0, 0) = x^3 - 3xy^2$. The critical point $(0, 0)$ is non-degenerate for $g$, as its Hessian matrix is the same as that of $f$. The index of the critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. Since the Hessian matrix has all zero eigenvalues, the index is 0.\n\nAccording to Morse theory, a critical point with index 0 is a local minimum. Therefore, the critical point $(0, 0)$ is a local minimum of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$."
