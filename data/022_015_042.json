    "message_2": "To find the image of the lower half plane under the Schwarz reflection of f(z) across the real axis, we first need to find the inverse of f(z). Let w = f(z), then we have:\n\nw = (z - 3) / (z + 2)\n\nNow, we solve for z in terms of w:\n\nz - 3 = w(z + 2)\nz - 3 = wz + 2w\nz(1 - w) = 2w + 3\nz = (2w + 3) / (1 - w)\n\nNow, let's find the Schwarz reflection of f(z) across the real axis. To do this, we replace z with its complex conjugate z*:\n\nz* = (2w + 3) / (1 - w*)\n\nNow, we want to find the image of the lower half plane Im(z) < 0. Since z* is the complex conjugate of z, we have Im(z*) = -Im(z). Therefore, we want to find the set of w such that Im(z*) > 0.\n\nLet w = u + iv, where u and v are real numbers. Then w* = u - iv, and we have:\n\nz* = (2(u + iv) + 3) / (1 - (u - iv))\nz* = (2u + 3 + 2iv) / (1 - u + iv)\n\nNow, let's find the imaginary part of z*:\n\nIm(z*) = Im((2u + 3 + 2iv) / (1 - u + iv))\n\nTo find the imaginary part, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\nIm(z*) = Im(((2u + 3 + 2iv)(1 - u - iv)) / ((1 - u + iv)(1 - u - iv)))\nIm(z*) = Im((2u + 3 + 2iv - 2u^2 - 2uv + 2u^2v - 2uv^2 - 2iv^2) / (1 - 2u + u^2 + v^2))\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nIm(z*) = Im((2u + 3 - 2u^2 - 2uv + 2u^2v - 2uv^2 + 2v^2) / (1 - 2u + u^2 + v^2))\n\nNow, we only need the imaginary part:\n\nIm(z*) = (2v - 2uv^2 + 2v^3) / (1 - 2u + u^2 + v^2)\n\nWe want Im(z*) > 0, so:\n\n(2v - 2uv^2 + 2v^3) / (1 - 2u + u^2 + v^2) > 0\n\nSince the denominator is always positive, we can focus on the numerator:\n\n2v - 2uv^2 + 2v^3 > 0\n\nFactoring out 2v, we get:\n\n2v(1 - uv + v^2) > 0\n\nSince v is the imaginary part of w, for the lower half plane, we have v < 0. Therefore, 2v < 0. To satisfy the inequality, we need the other factor to be negative:\n\n1 - uv + v^2 < 0\n\nThis inequality represents the image of the lower half plane Im(z) < 0 under the Schwarz reflection of f(z) across the real axis."
