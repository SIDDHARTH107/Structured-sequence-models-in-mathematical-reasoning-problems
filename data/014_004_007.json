    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a confidential message to Bob using elliptic curve cryptography. The elliptic curve equation used is y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 5 over a prime field with modulo 23. Alice chooses her private key as 7 and her public key as (14, 16). Bob chooses his private key as 3 and his public key as (15, 7). If Alice wants to send the message \"HELLO\", what is the encoded message that she will send to Bob?",
    "message_2": "To send a message using elliptic curve cryptography, Alice will first need to encode the message \"HELLO\" into numerical form. One common method is to use the ASCII values of the characters, subtracting 64 to get the numerical values in the range of 1-26 for A-Z. In this case, the numerical values for \"HELLO\" are:\n\nH -> 8\nE -> 5\nL -> 12\nL -> 12\nO -> 15\n\nNow, Alice will use elliptic curve cryptography to encrypt these numerical values. To do this, she will perform the following steps for each value:\n\n1. Multiply Bob's public key by the numerical value of the message.\n2. Multiply her private key by the base point (the generator point) of the elliptic curve.\n3. Add the results from steps 1 and 2.\n\nLet's denote the base point as G. The elliptic curve equation is y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 5 (mod 23). We need to find the generator point G for this elliptic curve. However, the problem statement does not provide the generator point G. Without the generator point, we cannot proceed with the encryption process.\n\nIf the generator point G was provided, we would perform the encryption steps for each numerical value and obtain the encoded message as a series of points on the elliptic curve."
