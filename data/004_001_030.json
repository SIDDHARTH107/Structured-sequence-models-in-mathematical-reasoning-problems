    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x - 1, we will apply the power rule for each term. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nFor the first term, 2x^3:\nThe derivative is 3 * 2x^(3-1) = 6x^2.\n\nFor the second term, -6x^2:\nThe derivative is 2 * -6x^(2-1) = -12x.\n\nFor the third term, 4x:\nThe derivative is 1 * 4x^(1-1) = 4.\n\nFor the last term, -1:\nSince it's a constant, its derivative is 0.\n\nNow, we add up the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 12x + 4."
