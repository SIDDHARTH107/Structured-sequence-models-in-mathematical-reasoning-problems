    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node A to node E, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will start by initializing the flow in each edge to 0 and iteratively find augmenting paths to increase the flow until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Initialize flow in each edge to 0.\n2. Find an augmenting path from A to E using DFS or BFS.\n3. Update the flow along the augmenting path.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nLet's find the augmenting paths:\n\n1. Path: A -> B -> E\n   Flow: 5 (minimum capacity along the path)\n   Update flow: AB = 5, BE = 5\n\n2. Path: A -> C -> E\n   Flow: 5 (minimum capacity along the path)\n   Update flow: AC = 5, CE = 5\n\n3. Path: A -> D -> E\n   Flow: 5 (minimum capacity along the path)\n   Update flow: AD = 5, DE = 5\n\nNow, all paths from A to E are saturated, and no more augmenting paths can be found. The maximum flow from node A to node E is the sum of the flows in the edges leading to E:\n\nMax flow = BE + CE + DE = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15"
