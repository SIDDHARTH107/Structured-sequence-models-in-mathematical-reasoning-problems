The cost of producing each soap bar is $2, and the cost of producing each bath bomb is $4. Sarah has at most 30 units of raw materials and can spend at most $140 on production costs. She wants to make a profit of at least $150.\n\nFormulate this problem as a nonlinear program to maximize Sarah's profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of soap bars and y be the number of bath bombs Sarah produces.\n\nObjective function (Profit): Maximize P = 4x + 4y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Raw materials constraint: x + y ≤ 30\n2. Production cost constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 140\n3. Profit constraint: 4x + 4y ≥ 150\n\nThe problem can be formulated as a nonlinear program as follows:\n\nMaximize P(x, y) = 4x + 4y\n\nSubject to:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 30\n2. 2x + 4y ≤ 140\n3. 4x + 4y ≥ 150\n4. x ≥ 0\n5. y ≥ 0"
