    "message_2": "To calculate the Tutte polynomial of a simple graph with 6 vertices and 8 edges, we need to know the specific structure of the graph. The Tutte polynomial, T(x, y), is a two-variable polynomial that depends on the number of connected components, the number of vertices, and the number of edges in the graph.\n\nIn general, the Tutte polynomial can be calculated recursively using the following rules:\n\n1. T(G) = T(G - e) + T(G / e) if e is not a loop or a bridge (where G - e is the graph obtained by deleting edge e, and G / e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e).\n2. T(G) = x * T(G - e) if e is a bridge.\n3. T(G) = y * T(G - e) if e is a loop.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific structure of the graph, we cannot apply these rules to calculate the Tutte polynomial. Please provide the adjacency matrix or adjacency list of the graph, or a description of the graph's structure, so that we can calculate the Tutte polynomial for the given graph."
