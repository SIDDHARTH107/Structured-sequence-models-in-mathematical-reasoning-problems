    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem related to using Fourier Transform to solve heat transfer problems in Mathematics:\n\nA metal rod of length L = 20 cm and thermal conductivity k = 60 W/mK is initially at a temperature of uniform 150 °C. At time t = 0, both ends of the rod are placed in contact with ice, which is held essentially at 0°C. The resulting temperature distribution u(x,t) throughout the rod at any time t is given by the following equation,\n\nu(x,t) = 300 / π * (1 - e^(-π²kt/L²)*cos(πx/L)) * e^(-π²kt/L²)\n\nFind the temperature distribution u(x,t) throughout the rod at 2 seconds, given that the rod has a cross-sectional area of A = 4 cm² and a heat capacity of c = 0.2 J/gK. The density of the metal is 8000 kg/m³.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution u(x,t) throughout the rod at 2 seconds, we need to plug in the given values into the equation:\n\nu(x,t) = 300 / π * (1 - e^(-π²kt/L²)*cos(πx/L)) * e^(-π²kt/L²)\n\nGiven values:\nL = 20 cm = 0.2 m (converting to meters)\nk = 60 W/mK\nt = 2 seconds\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nu(x,t) = 300 / π * (1 - e^(-π² * 60 * 2 / 0.2²) * cos(πx/0.2)) * e^(-π² * 60 * 2 / 0.2²)\n\nu(x,t) = 300 / π * (1 - e^(-π² * 600) * cos(5πx)) * e^(-π² * 600)\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution u(x,t) for different values of x (in meters) along the length of the rod. For example, we can find the temperature at x = 0, x = 0.1, and x = 0.2:\n\nu(0,2) = 300 / π * (1 - e^(-π² * 600) * cos(0)) * e^(-π² * 600) ≈ 0 °C\nu(0.1,2) = 300 / π * (1 - e^(-π² * 600) * cos(5π * 0.1)) * e^(-π² * 600) ≈ 75 °C\nu(0.2,2) = 300 / π * (1 - e^(-π² * 600) * cos(5π * 0.2)) * e^(-π² * 600) ≈ 0 °C\n\nSo, at 2 seconds, the temperature distribution along the rod is approximately 0 °C at both ends (x = 0 and x = 0.2) and 75 °C at the middle (x = 0.1)."
