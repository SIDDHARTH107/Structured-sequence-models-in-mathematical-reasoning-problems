    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct groups of order 40 up to isomorphism, we first find the prime factorization of 40. We have 40 = 2^3 * 5^1. Now, we use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is the product of the number of partitions of each of the prime powers in the factorization.\n\nFor 2^3, there are two partitions: (3) and (2, 1).\nFor 5^1, there is only one partition: (1).\n\nNow, we find the product of the number of partitions: 2 * 1 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 distinct groups of order 40 up to isomorphism.\n\n1. Cyclic group: There is one cyclic group of order 40, denoted by C_40 or Z_40. This group is abelian.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: The second group is the direct product of two cyclic groups, one of order 8 (2^3) and one of order 5 (5^1). This group is denoted by C_8 x C_5 or Z_8 x Z_5. This group is also abelian.\n\nThere are no dihedral groups of order 40, as dihedral groups have orders that are twice the number of sides of the polygon they represent (i.e., even orders). Since 40 is not twice an integer, there is no dihedral group of order 40.\n\nIn summary, there are 2 distinct groups of order 40 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. C_40 (cyclic, abelian)\n2. C_8 x C_5 (abelian)\n\nBoth groups are abelian, and there are no non-abelian or dihedral groups of order 40."
