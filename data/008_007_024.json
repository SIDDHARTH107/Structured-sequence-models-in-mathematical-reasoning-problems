    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D that is similar to A and the matrix P that diagonalizes A, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues of matrix A.\n2. Find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n3. Form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns.\n4. Compute the diagonal matrix D using the formula D = P^(-1) * A * P.\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues of matrix A:\nThe characteristic equation of A is given by det(A - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [3-λ 5; 1 4-λ]\n\ndet(A - λI) = (3-λ)(4-λ) - (5)(1) = λ^2 - 7λ + 7\n\nThe eigenvalues are the roots of this equation:\n\nλ^2 - 7λ + 7 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nλ = (7 ± √(49 - 4*7))/2 = (7 ± √33)/2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = (7 + √33)/2 and λ2 = (7 - √33)/2.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue:\n\nFor λ1:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n\n[3 - (7 + √33)/2  5; 1  4 - (7 + √33)/2] * [x1; x2] = [0; 0]\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nv1 = [1; (3 - (7 + √33)/2)/5]\n\nFor λ2:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n\n[3 - (7 - √33)/2  5; 1  4 - (7 - √33)/2] * [x1; x2] = [0; 0]\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nv2 = [1; (3 - (7 - √33)/2)/5]\n\n3. Form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = [1  1; (3 - (7 + √33)/2)/5  (3 - (7 - √33)/2)/5]\n\n4. Compute the diagonal matrix D using the formula D = P^(-1) * A * P:\n\nD = [λ1 0; 0 λ2] = [(7 + √33)/2 0; 0 (7 - √33)/2]\n\nSo, the diagonal matrix D is:\n\nD = [(7 + √33)/2  0; 0  (7 - √33)/2]\n\nAnd the matrix P that diagonalizes A is:\n\nP = [1  1; (3 - (7 + √33)/2)/5  (3 - (7 - √33)/2)/5]"
