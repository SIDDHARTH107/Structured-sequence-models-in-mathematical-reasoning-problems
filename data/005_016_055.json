    "message_2": "To perform discriminant analysis, we first need to know the gender of the individuals in the dataset. However, since the gender information is not provided, we cannot perform discriminant analysis to determine whether weight or height is a better predictor of gender.\n\nIf the gender information was provided, we could perform linear discriminant analysis (LDA) or quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) to determine which variable (weight or height) is a better predictor of gender. The one with the higher discriminant function score would be considered the better predictor."
