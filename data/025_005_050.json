    "message_2": "A singular point on a curve is a point where the curve is not smooth, i.e., the tangent is either undefined or vertical. To find the singular points, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the given equation with respect to x and y.\n\nLet F(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy. Then the partial derivatives are:\n\nF_x = ∂F/∂x = 3x^2 - 3y\nF_y = ∂F/∂y = 3y^2 - 3x\n\nA singular point occurs when both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero:\n\n3x^2 - 3y = 0\n3y^2 - 3x = 0\n\nDivide both equations by 3:\n\nx^2 - y = 0\ny^2 - x = 0\n\nNow, solve the first equation for y:\n\ny = x^2\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\n(x^2)^2 - x = 0\nx^4 - x = 0\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx(x^3 - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = 0\nx^3 - 1 = 0 => x = 1\n\nNow, find the corresponding y values:\n\nFor x = 0:\ny = (0)^2 = 0\n\nFor x = 1:\ny = (1)^2 = 1\n\nSo, the singular points are (0, 0) and (1, 1)."
