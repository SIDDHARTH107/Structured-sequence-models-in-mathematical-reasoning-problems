    "message_1": "Suppose in a dataset the mean is 30 and the standard deviation is 5. If a data point has a value of 50, is it an outlier? Provide a reason for your answer using the 1.5 × IQR rule.",
    "message_2": "To determine if a data point is an outlier using the 1.5 × IQR rule, we first need to calculate the Interquartile Range (IQR). However, we are only given the mean and standard deviation of the dataset, which is not enough information to calculate the IQR directly. The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3), which represent the 25th and 75th percentiles of the data, respectively.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to calculate the IQR, we can't use the 1.5 × IQR rule to determine if the data point with a value of 50 is an outlier. However, we can use the mean and standard deviation to get an idea of how unusual the data point is.\n\nThe mean is 30, and the standard deviation is 5. A data point with a value of 50 is 20 units away from the mean. This is 4 standard deviations away from the mean (20/5 = 4). In a normal distribution, about 99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean. Since the data point is 4 standard deviations away from the mean, it is quite unusual and could be considered an outlier. However, this conclusion is based on the assumption of a normal distribution and not the 1.5 × IQR rule."
