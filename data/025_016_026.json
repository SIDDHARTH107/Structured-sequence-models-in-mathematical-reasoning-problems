    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line that passes through the point (2, 1) and intersects the curve y = x^2 at exactly one point, we can use the slope-point form of a linear equation: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is the point (2, 1) and m is the slope of the line.\n\nLet's denote the point of intersection between the line and the curve as (x0, y0), where y0 = x0^2. Since the line intersects the curve at exactly one point, the line must be tangent to the curve at that point. The derivative of the curve y = x^2 is dy/dx = 2x, which represents the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve. Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at the point (x0, y0) is m = 2x0.\n\nNow we can write the equation of the line as:\n\ny - 1 = 2x0(x - 2)\n\nSince the line intersects the curve at (x0, y0), we can substitute y0 for y and x0 for x:\n\ny0 - 1 = 2x0(x0 - 2)\n\nNow we can substitute y0 = x0^2:\n\nx0^2 - 1 = 2x0(x0 - 2)\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation:\n\nx0^2 - 1 = 2x0^2 - 4x0\nx0^2 - 2x0^2 + 4x0 - 1 = 0\n-x0^2 + 4x0 - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and since the line intersects the curve at exactly one point, there must be only one solution for x0. For a quadratic equation to have only one solution, its discriminant (Δ) must be equal to 0. The discriminant is given by the formula Δ = b^2 - 4ac, where a = -1, b = 4, and c = -1 in our case:\n\nΔ = 4^2 - 4(-1)(-1) = 16 - 4 = 12\n\nSince the discriminant is not equal to 0, there is an error in the problem statement or it is not possible to find a line that intersects the curve y = x^2 at exactly one point and passes through the point (2, 1)."
