    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider a fluid with dynamic viscosity of 0.1 Pa*s and density of 1.2 kg/m^3 flowing through a pipe with a diameter of 0.1 m. The velocity profile is given by u(r) = 2V[1-(r/R)^2] where V is the maximum velocity and R is the radius of the pipe. Use Navier-Stokes equations to find the average velocity of the fluid over the cross-section of the pipe.",
    "message_2": "To find the average velocity of the fluid over the cross-section of the pipe, we need to integrate the velocity profile over the area of the pipe and divide by the total area. The area of the pipe is given by A = πR^2, where R is the radius of the pipe. In this case, R = 0.1 m / 2 = 0.05 m.\n\nThe average velocity (U_avg) can be calculated as follows:\n\nU_avg = (1/A) * ∫∫ u(r) * dA\n\nSince the velocity profile is axisymmetric, we can use polar coordinates to simplify the integration. In polar coordinates, dA = r * dr * dθ, and the limits of integration are r from 0 to R and θ from 0 to 2π.\n\nU_avg = (1/πR^2) * ∫(0 to 2π) dθ * ∫(0 to R) 2V[1-(r/R)^2] * r * dr\n\nFirst, we integrate with respect to r:\n\n∫(0 to R) 2V[1-(r/R)^2] * r * dr = 2V * ∫(0 to R) (r - r^3/R^2) dr\n\n= 2V * [1/2 * r^2 - 1/4 * r^4/R^2] evaluated from 0 to R\n\n= 2V * [1/2 * R^2 - 1/4 * R^4/R^2]\n\n= 2V * R^2 * (1/2 - 1/4)\n\nNow, we integrate with respect to θ:\n\n∫(0 to 2π) dθ = 2π\n\nSo, the average velocity is:\n\nU_avg = (1/πR^2) * 2π * 2V * R^2 * (1/2 - 1/4)\n\nU_avg = 2V * (1/2 - 1/4)\n\nU_avg = V * (1/2)\n\nSince we don't have the value of the maximum velocity (V), the average velocity (U_avg) is equal to V/2."
