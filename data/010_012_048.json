    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x) = e^x \\sin(x)$, we first need to find its first and second derivatives.\n\nFirst derivative:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(e^x \\sin(x))$\n\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n$f'(x) = e^x \\sin(x) + e^x \\cos(x)$\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero:\n$0 = e^x \\sin(x) + e^x \\cos(x)$\n\nFactor out $e^x$:\n$0 = e^x(\\sin(x) + \\cos(x))$\n\nSince $e^x$ is never equal to zero, we only need to find the values of $x$ for which $\\sin(x) + \\cos(x) = 0$. This occurs when $\\sin(x) = -\\cos(x)$. The solutions to this equation are $x = 2n\\pi + \\frac{3\\pi}{4}$ and $x = 2n\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, where $n$ is an integer.\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative to determine the nature of these critical points:\n$f''(x) = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(e^x \\sin(x))$\n\nUsing the product rule again, we get:\n$f''(x) = e^x \\sin(x) + 2e^x \\cos(x) - e^x \\sin(x)$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n$f''(x) = 2e^x \\cos(x)$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n\n1. $x = 2n\\pi + \\frac{3\\pi}{4}$:\n$f''(2n\\pi + \\frac{3\\pi}{4}) = 2e^{2n\\pi + \\frac{3\\pi}{4}} \\cos(2n\\pi + \\frac{3\\pi}{4})$\n\nSince $\\cos(2n\\pi + \\frac{3\\pi}{4}) < 0$, the second derivative is negative, which means that these critical points are local maxima.\n\n2. $x = 2n\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{4}$:\n$f''(2n\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{4}) = 2e^{2n\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\cos(2n\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{4})$\n\nSince $\\cos(2n\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{4}) > 0$, the second derivative is positive, which means that these critical points are local minima.\n\nIn conclusion, the critical points of the function $f(x) = e^x \\sin(x)$ are $x = 2n\\pi + \\frac{3\\pi}{4}$ (local maxima) and $x = 2n\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ (local minima), where $n$ is an integer. There are no saddle points for this function."
