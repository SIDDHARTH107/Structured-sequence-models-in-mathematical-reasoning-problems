    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x + 2) + log(x - 3) = log(28), we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nStep 1: Combine the logarithms on the left side using the product rule, which states that log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b).\n\nlog((x + 2)(x - 3)) = log(28)\n\nStep 2: Since the logarithms are equal, we can set their arguments equal to each other.\n\n(x + 2)(x - 3) = 28\n\nStep 3: Expand the expression on the left side.\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2x - 6 = 28\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation.\n\nx^2 - x - 6 = 28\n\nStep 5: Move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero.\n\nx^2 - x - 34 = 0\n\nStep 6: Factor the quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula. In this case, the equation does not factor easily, so we will use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 1, b = -1, and c = -34.\n\nx = (1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(1)(-34))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (1 ± √(1 + 136)) / 2\n\nx = (1 ± √137) / 2\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = (1 + √137) / 2 and x = (1 - √137) / 2\n\nHowever, we must check if these solutions are valid, as the arguments of the logarithms must be positive.\n\nFor x = (1 + √137) / 2:\n\nx + 2 > 0 and x - 3 > 0\n\n(1 + √137) / 2 + 2 > 0 and (1 + √137) / 2 - 3 > 0\n\nBoth conditions are true, so this solution is valid.\n\nFor x = (1 - √137) / 2:\n\nx + 2 > 0 and x - 3 > 0\n\n(1 - √137) / 2 + 2 > 0 and (1 - √137) / 2 - 3 > 0\n\nThe second condition is false, so this solution is not valid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution for x is:\n\nx = (1 + √137) / 2"
