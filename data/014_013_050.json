    "message_1": "Suppose you want to encrypt the message \"MATH\" using a Hill cipher with a 2x2 key matrix [5, 7; 2, 3]. Convert the letters of the message to their corresponding numerical values (A=0, B=1, etc.) and then group them into pairs: (12,0) and (19,7). Find the encrypted message using the formula C = K * P, where C is the ciphertext matrix, K is the key matrix, and P is the plaintext matrix. Convert the resulting numerical values back to their corresponding letters to obtain the encrypted message.",
    "message_2": "First, let's convert the letters of the message \"MATH\" to their corresponding numerical values using A=0, B=1, etc.:\nM = 12, A = 0, T = 19, H = 7\n\nNow, let's group them into pairs:\n(12, 0) and (19, 7)\n\nThe key matrix K is given as:\n[5, 7]\n[2, 3]\n\nNow, let's find the encrypted message using the formula C = K * P, where C is the ciphertext matrix, K is the key matrix, and P is the plaintext matrix.\n\nFor the first pair (12, 0), the plaintext matrix P is:\n[12]\n[ 0]\n\nNow, multiply K * P:\n[5, 7] * [12] = [5*12 + 7*0] = [60]\n[2, 3]   [ 0]   [2*12 + 3*0]   [24]\n\nSo, the first pair of the ciphertext matrix C is (60, 24).\n\nFor the second pair (19, 7), the plaintext matrix P is:\n[19]\n[ 7]\n\nNow, multiply K * P:\n[5, 7] * [19] = [5*19 + 7*7] = [168]\n[2, 3]   [ 7]   [2*19 + 3*7]   [ 55]\n\nSo, the second pair of the ciphertext matrix C is (168, 55).\n\nNow, let's convert the resulting numerical values back to their corresponding letters. Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, we need to take the modulo 26 of the numerical values:\n\n60 mod 26 = 8, which corresponds to the letter I\n24 mod 26 = 24, which corresponds to the letter Y\n168 mod 26 = 14, which corresponds to the letter O\n55 mod 26 = 3, which corresponds to the letter D\n\nThus, the encrypted message is \"IYOD\"."
