    "message_2": "The main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set can be parameterized by the following equation:\n\nc(t) = (1/2) * (1 - cos(t)) * e^(it), where t is in the range [0, 2π].\n\nTo find the area of the main cardioid, we can use the polar coordinate system. The area of a region in polar coordinates is given by the integral:\n\nA = (1/2) * ∫(r(t))^2 dt, where r(t) is the radial distance from the origin to the boundary of the region.\n\nIn our case, r(t) = |c(t)| = (1/2) * (1 - cos(t)). Therefore, the area of the main cardioid is:\n\nA = (1/2) * ∫((1/2) * (1 - cos(t)))^2 dt, where the integral is taken over the range [0, 2π].\n\nNow, we can simplify the integrand:\n\n((1/2) * (1 - cos(t)))^2 = (1/4) * (1 - 2cos(t) + cos^2(t))\n\nWe can use the double-angle formula for cosine to simplify further:\n\ncos^2(t) = (1 + cos(2t))/2\n\nSo, the integrand becomes:\n\n(1/4) * (1 - 2cos(t) + (1 + cos(2t))/2) = (1/8) - (1/2)cos(t) + (1/8)cos(2t)\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to t:\n\nA = (1/2) * ∫((1/8) - (1/2)cos(t) + (1/8)cos(2t)) dt, over [0, 2π]\n\nA = (1/2) * [(1/8)t - (1/2)sin(t) + (1/16)sin(2t)] evaluated from 0 to 2π\n\nSince sin(0) = sin(2π) = sin(4π) = 0, the area becomes:\n\nA = (1/2) * [(1/8)(2π) - 0 + 0] = (1/8) * 2π = π/4\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is π/4."
