    "message_1": "A cable with a length of 200 meters is suspended between two poles. The cable has a mass of 5 kg/m and is under a tension of 50 N at each end. After a disturbance, the cable is set in motion and the resulting wave travels along the cable with a speed of 14 m/s. Find the wave equation for the cable and determine the amplitude, wavelength, and frequency of the wave.",
    "message_2": "To find the wave equation for the cable, we can use the general wave equation:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin(kx - ωt + φ)\n\nwhere y(x, t) is the displacement of the cable at position x and time t, A is the amplitude of the wave, k is the wave number, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase constant.\n\nFirst, we need to find the linear mass density (μ) of the cable, which is given by the mass per unit length:\n\nμ = mass / length = 5 kg/m\n\nNext, we can find the wave speed (v) using the tension (T) and the linear mass density (μ):\n\nv = sqrt(T / μ)\n\nWe are given the wave speed (v) as 14 m/s and the tension (T) as 50 N. Plugging these values into the equation, we can solve for the linear mass density (μ):\n\n14 = sqrt(50 / μ)\n196 = 50 / μ\nμ = 50 / 196\nμ ≈ 0.255 kg/m\n\nNow that we have the linear mass density, we can find the wave number (k) and the angular frequency (ω) using the wave speed (v):\n\nk = 2π / λ\nω = 2πf\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength and f is the frequency.\n\nWe are not given the amplitude (A), wavelength (λ), or frequency (f) of the wave, so we cannot determine the exact wave equation. However, we can write the general wave equation using the wave speed (v):\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin(kx - ωt + φ)\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine the amplitude, wavelength, and frequency of the wave, we cannot find the exact values for A, λ, and f. However, the general wave equation provided can be used to describe the motion of the cable once those values are known."
