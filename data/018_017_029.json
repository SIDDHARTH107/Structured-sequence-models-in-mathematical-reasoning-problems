    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A × B) and B, denoted as (A × B) △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\n(A × B) △ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B × A.\n\nB × A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (B × A) and B, denoted as (B × A) △ B.\n\n(B × A) △ B = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two symmetric differences:\n\n(A × B) △ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n(B × A) △ B = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) △ B and (B × A) △ B are not equal, which shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
