    "message_2": "Let X be a compact connected topological space homeomorphic to a surface of genus 2. We will determine the intersection pairing on H^2(X) using Poincaré duality.\n\nFirst, recall that the homology groups of a surface of genus g are given by:\n\nH_0(X) = Z\nH_1(X) = Z^{2g}\nH_2(X) = Z\n\nNow, using Poincaré duality, we have that the cohomology groups are isomorphic to the homology groups with dual dimensions:\n\nH^0(X) = H_2(X) = Z\nH^1(X) = H_1(X) = Z^{2g}\nH^2(X) = H_0(X) = Z\n\nThe intersection pairing is a bilinear form on H^2(X) that is given by the cup product followed by the evaluation of the fundamental class:\n\n⟨α, β⟩ = ∫_X α ∪ β\n\nSince H^2(X) = Z, the intersection pairing is determined by the self-intersection of the generator of H^2(X). Let x be a generator of H^2(X). Then the intersection pairing is given by:\n\n⟨x, x⟩ = ∫_X x ∪ x\n\nNow, the cup product of x with itself is a multiple of the generator of H^2(X), say nx. Thus, we have:\n\n⟨x, x⟩ = ∫_X nx = n ∫_X x\n\nSince x is the generator of H^2(X), ∫_X x = 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n⟨x, x⟩ = n\n\nThe intersection pairing on H^2(X) is determined by the integer n. In the case of a surface of genus 2, the intersection form is known to be non-degenerate and have signature (1, -1). This means that the intersection form can be represented by the matrix:\n\n[ 0  1 ]\n[ 1  0 ]\n\nThus, the intersection pairing on H^2(X) for a surface of genus 2 is given by this matrix, and the self-intersection of the generator of H^2(X) is 0."
