    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH\" using the Hill cipher with the given 2x2 matrix key, we first need to convert the letters to their corresponding numbers in the alphabet (A=0, B=1, C=2, ...).\n\nM = 12\nA = 0\nT = 19\nH = 7\n\nNow, we need to arrange these numbers into a 2x2 matrix, with the first two letters in the first column and the second two letters in the second column:\n\nP = | 12 19 |\n    |  0  7 |\n\nNext, we multiply the key matrix (K) by the plaintext matrix (P):\n\nK = | 3 5 |\n    | 7 2 |\n\nC = K * P\n\nC = | 3 5 | * | 12 19 |\n    | 7 2 |   |  0  7 |\n\nC = | (3*12 + 5*0)  (3*19 + 5*7)  |\n    | (7*12 + 2*0)  (7*19 + 2*7)  |\n\nC = | 36  66 |\n    | 84 147 |\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder of each element in the matrix C when divided by 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet):\n\nC = | 36 % 26  66 % 26 |\n    | 84 % 26 147 % 26 |\n\nC = | 10  14 |\n    |  6  21 |\n\nFinally, we convert these numbers back to their corresponding letters in the alphabet:\n\n10 = K\n14 = O\n6 = G\n21 = V\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"KOGV\"."
