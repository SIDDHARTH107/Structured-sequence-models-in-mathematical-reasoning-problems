Write an equation to represent the height of the Ferris wheel as a function of time and find the maximum and minimum heights reached by the Ferris wheel during one revolution.",
    "message_2": "Let h(t) represent the height of the Ferris wheel as a function of time t (in minutes). Since the Ferris wheel oscillates between its maximum and minimum heights, we can model its height using a sinusoidal function.\n\nThe amplitude of the function is half the difference between the maximum and minimum heights: (50 - 10) / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20 meters.\n\nThe vertical shift (or the average height) is the average of the maximum and minimum heights: (50 + 10) / 2 = 60 / 2 = 30 meters.\n\nThe period of the function is the time it takes for the Ferris wheel to complete one full revolution, which is 5 minutes. To find the angular frequency (ω), we use the formula:\n\nω = 2π / period\n\nω = 2π / 5\n\nNow we can write the height function h(t) as a sinusoidal function:\n\nh(t) = amplitude × sin(ωt) + vertical shift\n\nh(t) = 20 × sin((2π / 5)t) + 30\n\nThe maximum height is reached when the sine function is at its maximum value, which is 1:\n\nmax height = 20 × 1 + 30 = 20 + 30 = 50 meters\n\nThe minimum height is reached when the sine function is at its minimum value, which is -1:\n\nmin height = 20 × (-1) + 30 = -20 + 30 = 10 meters\n\nSo, the equation representing the height of the Ferris wheel as a function of time is:\n\nh(t) = 20 × sin((2π / 5)t) + 30\n\nAnd the maximum and minimum heights reached by the Ferris wheel during one revolution are 50 meters and 10 meters, respectively."
