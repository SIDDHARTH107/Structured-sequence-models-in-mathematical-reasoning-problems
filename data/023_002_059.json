    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series approximation of the given function f(x) = 5x - x^2 on the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n, b_n, and a_0.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nThe formulas for the coefficients are:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nLet's calculate the coefficients:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (5x - x^2) dx\na_0 = (1/π) * [5x^2/2 - x^3/3] | from -π to π\na_0 = (1/π) * [(5π^2/2 - π^3/3) - (-5π^2/2 + π^3/3)]\na_0 = (10π^2/2) / π\na_0 = 5π\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (5x - x^2) * cos(nx) dx\na_n = (1/π) * [(5x/n) * sin(nx) + (x^2/n^2) * cos(nx) - (2/n^3) * sin(nx)] | from -π to π\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, the first and third terms will be zero. The second term will also be zero because cos(nπ) = 1 for even n and -1 for odd n, so the sum will be zero.\n\na_n = 0\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] (5x - x^2) * sin(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-5/n) * cos(nx) - (2x/n^2) * sin(nx) - (2/n^3) * cos(nx)] | from -π to π\n\nThe first term will be zero because cos(nπ) = 1 for even n and -1 for odd n, so the sum will be zero. The second term will also be zero because sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n.\n\nb_n = (1/π) * (-2/n^3) * [cos(nπ) - cos(-nπ)]\nb_n = (2/πn^3) * [1 - (-1)^n]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series approximation for f(x):\n\nf(x) = 5π + Σ [(2/πn^3) * [1 - (-1)^n] * sin(nx)]\n\nThe Fourier series converges to the given function f(x) = 5x - x^2 for all x in the interval [-π, π] because f(x) is continuous and piecewise smooth on this interval."
