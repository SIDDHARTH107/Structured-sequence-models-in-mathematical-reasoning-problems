    "message_2": "To determine the genus of a simple connected graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the inequality for non-planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for a connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, we have V = 10 and E = 15. We need to check if G is planar or not. A graph is planar if it can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. A graph is non-planar if it cannot be drawn on a plane without edges crossing.\n\nFor a simple connected graph, the inequality for non-planar graphs states that:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nSince the inequality is not satisfied (15 > 24), the graph G is non-planar.\n\nNow, we need to find the genus of the graph. The genus of a graph is the minimum number of handles that need to be added to a sphere to embed the graph without edge crossings. We can use the following formula to find the genus:\n\nE ≤ 3V + 6g - 6\n\nwhere g is the genus.\n\nWe need to find the smallest integer value of g that satisfies the inequality:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 + 6g - 6\n\nSolving for g:\n\n15 ≤ 30 + 6g - 6\n-9 ≤ 6g\ng ≥ 1.5\n\nSince g must be an integer, the smallest integer value that satisfies the inequality is g = 2.\n\nTherefore, the genus of the simple connected graph G with 10 vertices and 15 edges is 2."
