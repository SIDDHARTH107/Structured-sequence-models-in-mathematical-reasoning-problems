    "message_2": "To decrypt the Rail Fence cipher with 3 rails, we need to arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern and then read the message row by row. The encrypted message \"HELLO WORLD\" has 11 characters. Let's arrange them in a zigzag pattern:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, let's read the message row by row:\n\nHORELWLDLO\n\nThe decrypted message is \"HORELWLDLO\"."
