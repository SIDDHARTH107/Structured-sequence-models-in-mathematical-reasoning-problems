    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected or not, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, we have 7 vertices, so a connected graph must have at least 6 edges. Since our graph has 10 edges, it is possible for the graph to be connected.\n\nHowever, having more than the minimum number of edges does not guarantee that the graph is connected. To determine the number of connected components, we can use the inequality:\n\nnumber of connected components ≤ (number of edges - number of vertices + 2)\n\nIn this case:\n\nnumber of connected components ≤ (10 - 7 + 2) = 5\n\nSo, the graph can have at most 5 connected components. Since the graph has more than the minimum number of edges required for a connected graph, it is possible that it has only one connected component, making it a connected graph.\n\nWithout more information about the specific connections between vertices, we cannot definitively say if the graph is connected or not, nor can we determine the exact number of connected components."
