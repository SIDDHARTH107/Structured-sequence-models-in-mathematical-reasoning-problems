    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 5, we first need to find its derivative f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 5)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points.\n\n4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x - 4 = 0\n\nWe can factor out a 4 from the equation:\n\nx^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be challenging. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient, which in this case are ±1.\n\nLet's try x = 1:\n\n(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 + 3(1) - 1 = 1 - 3 + 3 - 1 = 0\n\nSo, x = 1 is a root of the equation. Now, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n      ______________________\n1  |  1   -3    3    -1\n         1   -2     0\n      ______________________\n          1   -5    3\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor is x^2 - 5x + 3. To find the other roots, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = 3:\n\nx = [5 ± sqrt((-5)^2 - 4(1)(3))] / 2(1)\nx = [5 ± sqrt(25 - 12)] / 2\nx = [5 ± sqrt(13)] / 2\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 5 are x = 1, x = (5 + sqrt(13))/2, and x = (5 - sqrt(13))/2."
