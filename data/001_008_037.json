    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 5 < 16 - 2x, follow these steps:\n\n1. Add 2x to both sides of the inequality to isolate the x terms on one side:\n   3x + 2x + 5 < 16 - 2x + 2x\n   5x + 5 < 16\n\n2. Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality to isolate the x term:\n   5x + 5 - 5 < 16 - 5\n   5x < 11\n\n3. Divide both sides of the inequality by 5 to solve for x:\n   5x/5 < 11/5\n   x < 11/5\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is x < 11/5."
