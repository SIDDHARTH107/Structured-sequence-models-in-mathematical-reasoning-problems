    "message_2": "To create the box, we will cut out squares of side length x from each corner of the cardboard. After folding up the sides, the dimensions of the box will be:\n\nLength: 30 - 2x\nWidth: 20 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume of the box, V, can be calculated as the product of its length, width, and height:\n\nV(x) = (30 - 2x)(20 - 2x)x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points of the volume function by taking its derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndV/dx = (30 - 2x)(20 - 2x) - 2x(20 - 2x) - 2x(30 - 2x)\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting dV/dx = 0:\n\n0 = (30 - 2x)(20 - 2x) - 2x(20 - 2x) - 2x(30 - 2x)\n\nThis equation can be simplified to:\n\n0 = 4x^3 - 100x^2 + 600x\n\nTo find the critical points, we can factor out 4x:\n\n0 = 4x(x^2 - 25x + 150)\n\nNow, we can find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 25x + 150:\n\nx^2 - 25x + 150 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nx = (25 ± √(25^2 - 4(150)))/2 = (25 ± √625 - 600)/2 = (25 ± √25)/2\n\nThe two possible values for x are:\n\nx = (25 + 5)/2 = 15\nx = (25 - 5)/2 = 10\n\nHowever, since the width of the cardboard is 20 cm, x cannot be greater than 10 cm. Therefore, x = 10 cm is the only valid critical point.\n\nNow, we can find the maximum volume of the box by plugging x = 10 cm back into the volume function:\n\nV(10) = (30 - 2(10))(20 - 2(10))(10) = (10)(0)(10) = 1000 cm³\n\nSo, the maximum volume of the box that can be obtained is 1000 cm³."
