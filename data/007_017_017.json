    "message_2": "A twin prime pair consists of two prime numbers that differ by 2. To find the smallest twin prime pair whose sum is greater than 100, we can start by checking prime numbers slightly above 50 (since 50 + 50 = 100).\n\nThe first prime number above 50 is 53. However, 53 + 2 = 55, which is not prime (divisible by 5). The next prime number is 59. In this case, 59 + 2 = 61, which is also a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the smallest twin prime pair whose sum is greater than 100 is (59, 61)."
