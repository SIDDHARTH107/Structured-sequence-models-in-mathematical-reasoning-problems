The student has five items to choose from, each with a different weight and value:\n\nItem 1: 2 pounds, value of $10\nItem 2: 3 pounds, value of $12\nItem 3: 5 pounds, value of $20\nItem 4: 7 pounds, value of $25\nItem 5: 9 pounds, value of $30\n\nWhat combination of items should the student choose to maximize the total value they can carry in their backpack?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total value the student can carry in their backpack, we need to find the combination of items that gives the highest value per pound without exceeding the 15-pound weight limit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value per pound for each item:\n\nItem 1: $10 / 2 lbs = $5/lb\nItem 2: $12 / 3 lbs = $4/lb\nItem 3: $20 / 5 lbs = $4/lb\nItem 4: $25 / 7 lbs = $3.57/lb\nItem 5: $30 / 9 lbs = $3.33/lb\n\nNow, let's try to fit the items with the highest value per pound into the backpack:\n\n1. Start with Item 1 (2 lbs, $5/lb): 2 lbs used, 13 lbs remaining\n2. Add Item 2 (3 lbs, $4/lb): 5 lbs used, 10 lbs remaining\n3. Add Item 3 (5 lbs, $4/lb): 10 lbs used, 5 lbs remaining\n\nAt this point, we cannot add Item 4 or Item 5 without exceeding the 15-pound weight limit. The remaining 5 pounds can be filled with another Item 1 (2 lbs) and another Item 2 (3 lbs), which will maximize the value.\n\nSo, the student should choose the following combination of items:\n\n- 2x Item 1 (2 lbs each, $10 each)\n- 2x Item 2 (3 lbs each, $12 each)\n- 1x Item 3 (5 lbs, $20)\n\nTotal weight: 2(2) + 2(3) + 5 = 15 pounds\nTotal value: 2($10) + 2($12) + $20 = $64"
