    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted the following Playfair cipher encrypted message: \"DEFENDTHECASTLE\" and you know that the key used for encryption is \"CRYPTO\". Decrypt the message and find the original plaintext.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Playfair cipher encrypted message, we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the key \"CRYPTO\". \n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: \"CRYPTO\" becomes \"CRYPTO\".\n2. Fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet in the matrix (excluding 'J', as it is combined with 'I' in the Playfair cipher): \"CRYPTOABDFGHIKLMNQSUVWXZ\".\n\nThe matrix looks like this:\n\nC R Y P T\nO A B D F\nG H I K L\nM N Q S U\nV W X Z\n\nNow, we will decrypt the message \"DEFENDTHECASTLE\" using the Playfair matrix:\n\n1. Break the ciphertext into digraphs: DE FE ND TH EC AS TL E\n2. For each digraph, locate the letters in the matrix and apply the decryption rules:\n\n   - DE: D is in row 1, column 4 and E is in row 1, column 5. They are in the same row, so we replace each letter with the one to its left: C (row 1, column 3) and D (row 1, column 4). The decrypted digraph is CD.\n   - FE: F is in row 1, column 5 and E is in row 1, column 4. They are in the same row, so we replace each letter with the one to its left: E (row 1, column 3) and D (row 1, column 4). The decrypted digraph is ED.\n   - ND: N is in row 3, column 4 and D is in row 1, column 4. They are in the same column, so we replace each letter with the one above it: M (row 2, column 4) and C (row 0, column 4). The decrypted digraph is MC.\n   - TH: T is in row 0, column 4 and H is in row 2, column 2. They are in different rows and columns, so we replace T with the letter in its row and H's column: A (row 0, column 2), and replace H with the letter in its row and T's column: I (row 2, column 4). The decrypted digraph is AI.\n   - EC: E is in row 1, column 4 and C is in row 0, column 0. They are in different rows and columns, so we replace E with the letter in its row and C's column: R (row 1, column 0), and replace C with the letter in its row and E's column: T (row 0, column 4). The decrypted digraph is RT.\n   - AS: A is in row 1, column 1 and S is in row 3, column 3. They are in different rows and columns, so we replace A with the letter in its row and S's column: B (row 1, column 3), and replace S with the letter in its row and A's column: O (row 3, column 1). The decrypted digraph is BO.\n   - TL: T is in row 0, column 4 and L is in row 2, column 5. They are in different rows and columns, so we replace T with the letter in its row and L's column: X (row 0, column 5), and replace L with the letter in its row and T's column: Q (row 2, column 4). The decrypted digraph is XQ.\n   - E: Since there's only one letter left, we can assume it was padded during encryption. We can ignore it for decryption.\n\n3. Combine the decrypted digraphs: CD ED MC AI RT BO XQ\n\nThe decrypted message is \"CDEDMCAIRTBOXQ\"."
