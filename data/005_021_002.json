    "message_1": "A study was conducted among 100 students to find out their average daily screen time. The collected data had a mean of 4.5 hours and a standard deviation of 1.2 hours. Using bootstrapping technique with a sample size of 50, estimate the standard error of the mean for the given data.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the standard error of the mean using the bootstrapping technique, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a random sample of size 50 from the original data (with replacement).\n2. Calculate the mean of the random sample.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 a large number of times (e.g., 1000 times) to create a distribution of sample means.\n4. Calculate the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means, which is the standard error of the mean.\n\nHowever, since we don't have the original data, we can't perform the bootstrapping technique directly. Instead, we can use the formula for the standard error of the mean, which is:\n\nStandard Error (SE) = Standard Deviation (SD) / sqrt(Sample Size (n))\n\nGiven the standard deviation (SD) is 1.2 hours and the sample size (n) is 50, we can calculate the standard error (SE) as follows:\n\nSE = 1.2 / sqrt(50)\nSE ≈ 1.2 / 7.071\nSE ≈ 0.17 hours\n\nSo, the estimated standard error of the mean for the given data using the bootstrapping technique with a sample size of 50 is approximately 0.17 hours."
