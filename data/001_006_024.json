    "message_2": "To find the vertex of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex: x = -b / 2a. Then, we can plug this value back into the equation to find the y-coordinate.\n\nIn this case, the equation is y = -2x^2 + 8x - 3, so a = -2, b = 8, and c = -3.\n\nFirst, let's find the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n\nx = -b / 2a\nx = -8 / (2 * -2)\nx = -8 / -4\nx = 2\n\nNow, let's plug this value back into the equation to find the y-coordinate:\n\ny = -2(2)^2 + 8(2) - 3\ny = -2(4) + 16 - 3\ny = -8 + 16 - 3\ny = 5\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation y = -2x^2 + 8x - 3 is at the coordinates (2, 5)."
