Suppose that for some integer k, the intersection number of a cycle $\\alpha$ representing a generator of $H_k(X)$ and a fundamental class $[X]$ of X is 5. Compute the intersection number of $\\alpha$ with any other cycle in $H_k(X)$.",
    "message_2": "Let $\\beta$ be any other cycle in $H_k(X)$. Since $\\alpha$ is a generator of $H_k(X)$, we can write $\\beta = n\\alpha + \\partial \\gamma$ for some integer $n$ and some $(k+1)$-chain $\\gamma$. Now, we want to compute the intersection number of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, which is given by $\\langle \\alpha, \\beta \\rangle$.\n\nUsing the definition of the intersection number, we have:\n\n$\\langle \\alpha, \\beta \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha, n\\alpha + \\partial \\gamma \\rangle = n\\langle \\alpha, \\alpha \\rangle + \\langle \\alpha, \\partial \\gamma \\rangle$\n\nSince $\\alpha$ is a cycle, it has no self-intersections, which implies that $\\langle \\alpha, \\alpha \\rangle = 0$. Also, by the properties of the intersection number, we have $\\langle \\alpha, \\partial \\gamma \\rangle = -\\langle \\partial \\alpha, \\gamma \\rangle$. However, $\\alpha$ is a cycle, so $\\partial \\alpha = 0$, and thus $\\langle \\alpha, \\partial \\gamma \\rangle = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the intersection number of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is:\n\n$\\langle \\alpha, \\beta \\rangle = n\\langle \\alpha, \\alpha \\rangle + \\langle \\alpha, \\partial \\gamma \\rangle = 0 + 0 = 0$\n\nSo, the intersection number of $\\alpha$ with any other cycle in $H_k(X)$ is 0."
