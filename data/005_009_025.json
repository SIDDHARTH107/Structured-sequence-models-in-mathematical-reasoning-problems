The results are as follows:\n\n- Red: 24 students\n- Blue: 28 students\n- Green: 22 students\n- Yellow: 18 students\n- Other: 8 students\n\nUsing the Wilcoxon signed-rank test at a significance level of 0.05, test the hypothesis that the median favorite color is not blue.",
    "message_2": "The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is not appropriate for this problem, as it is a non-parametric test used to compare two related samples or repeated measurements on a single sample. In this case, we have a single sample with categorical data.\n\nInstead, we can use the Chi-square test for goodness-of-fit to test the hypothesis that the median favorite color is not blue. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the distribution of favorite colors is equal among all colors, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the distribution is not equal.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected frequencies for each color if the distribution was equal:\n\nTotal students = 100\nNumber of colors = 5\nExpected frequency for each color = 100 / 5 = 20\n\nNow, we can calculate the Chi-square statistic:\n\nχ² = Σ [(Observed frequency - Expected frequency)² / Expected frequency]\n\nχ² = [(24 - 20)² / 20] + [(28 - 20)² / 20] + [(22 - 20)² / 20] + [(18 - 20)² / 20] + [(8 - 20)² / 20]\nχ² = (16 / 20) + (64 / 20) + (4 / 20) + (4 / 20) + (144 / 20)\nχ² = 0.8 + 3.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 7.2\nχ² = 11.6\n\nNow, we need to find the critical value for the Chi-square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom (5 colors - 1) and a significance level of 0.05. Using a Chi-square table or calculator, we find the critical value to be 9.488.\n\nSince our calculated Chi-square statistic (11.6) is greater than the critical value (9.488), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that the median favorite color is not blue at a significance level of 0.05."
