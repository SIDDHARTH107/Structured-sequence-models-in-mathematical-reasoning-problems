    "message_1": "A flagpole is standing vertically on a ground. The flag on the top of the pole is at an angle of elevation of 60 degrees from a point 20 meters away from the base of the pole. Find the height of the flagpole.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the height of the flagpole (opposite side) and the distance from the base of the pole (adjacent side).\n\nLet h be the height of the flagpole. We have:\n\ntan(60°) = h / 20\n\nSince tan(60°) = √3, we can write:\n\n√3 = h / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh = 20 * √3\n\nh ≈ 20 * 1.732\n\nh ≈ 34.64 meters\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is approximately 34.64 meters."
