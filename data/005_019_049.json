    "message_1": "A company conducted a study of employee job satisfaction and classified them as either \"satisfied\" or \"dissatisfied\". From the study, they found that 60% of satisfied employees remained satisfied in the following year, while 40% of them became dissatisfied. Similarly, 50% of dissatisfied employees remained dissatisfied in the following year, while 50% of them became satisfied. \n\nIf the company currently has 1000 satisfied employees, how many of them can be expected to remain satisfied in the following year?",
    "message_2": "If the company currently has 1000 satisfied employees and 60% of them are expected to remain satisfied in the following year, we can calculate the number of employees who will remain satisfied by multiplying the total number of satisfied employees by the percentage that remains satisfied:\n\n1000 satisfied employees * 60% = 600 employees\n\nSo, 600 employees can be expected to remain satisfied in the following year."
