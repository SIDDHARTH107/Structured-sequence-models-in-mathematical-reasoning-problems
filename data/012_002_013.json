    "message_2": "To find the chromatic number of the graph, we need to color the vertices using the minimum number of colors such that no adjacent vertices have the same color. Let's try to color the graph:\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A.\n2. Since vertex 2 is connected to vertex 1, we need to use a different color for vertex 2. Color vertex 2 with color B.\n3. Vertex 3 is connected to both vertices 1 and 2, so we need a third color for vertex 3. Color vertex 3 with color C.\n4. Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 1, 2, and 3. However, since it is not connected to vertex 1 directly, we can use color A for vertex 4.\n5. Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1 and 4, so we need to use a different color for vertex 5. Color vertex 5 with color B.\n6. Finally, vertex 6 is connected to vertices 2, 4, and 5. Since it is not directly connected to vertex 3, we can use color C for vertex 6.\n\nWe have successfully colored the graph using 3 colors (A, B, and C), and no adjacent vertices have the same color. Therefore, the chromatic number of the given graph is 3."
