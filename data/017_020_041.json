    "message_2": "There are eight non-abelian groups of order 40, but not all of them are isomorphic to the dihedral group D20. The dihedral group D20 is one of the non-abelian groups of order 40. The eight non-abelian groups of order 40 are:\n\n1. D20: The dihedral group of order 40, which is the group of symmetries of a regular 20-gon. It has 20 rotational symmetries and 20 reflectional symmetries. It can be represented as D20 = ⟨r, s | r^20 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(-1)⟩.\n\n2. Q20: The generalized quaternion group of order 40. It can be represented as Q20 = ⟨a, b | a^20 = 1, b^2 = a^10, b^(-1)ab = a^(-1)⟩.\n\n3. C2 × D10: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 2 and the dihedral group of order 20. It can be represented as C2 × D10 = ⟨x, r, s | x^2 = r^10 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(-1), xr = rx, xs = sx⟩.\n\n4. C4 × D5: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 4 and the dihedral group of order 10. It can be represented as C4 × D5 = ⟨x, r, s | x^4 = r^5 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(-1), xr = rx, xs = sx⟩.\n\n5. C5 ⋊ C8: The semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 5 and the cyclic group of order 8, where the action of C8 on C5 is non-trivial. It can be represented as C5 ⋊ C8 = ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^8 = 1, bab^(-1) = a^2⟩.\n\n6. C5 ⋊ C4: The semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 5 and the cyclic group of order 4, where the action of C4 on C5 is non-trivial. It can be represented as C5 ⋊ C4 = ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^4 = 1, bab^(-1) = a^2⟩.\n\n7. C5 ⋊ C2: The semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 5 and the cyclic group of order 2, where the action of C2 on C5 is non-trivial. It can be represented as C5 ⋊ C2 = ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^2 = 1, bab^(-1) = a^2⟩.\n\n8. C5 ⋊ Q8: The semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 5 and the quaternion group of order 8, where the action of Q8 on C5 is non-trivial. It can be represented as C5 ⋊ Q8 = ⟨a, b, c | a^5 = b^4 = c^2 = 1, bab^(-1) = a^2, bc = cb, ac = ca⟩.\n\nOut of these eight non-abelian groups of order 40, only D20 is isomorphic to the dihedral group D20, as it is the dihedral group D20 itself. The other groups have different structures and properties, and thus are not isomorphic to D20."
