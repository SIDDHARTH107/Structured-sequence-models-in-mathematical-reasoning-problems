    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the truth value of the given expression [(p ⇒ q) & (q ⇒ p)] based on the given values of p and q.\n\nGiven: p is true, and q is false.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the individual implications:\n\n1. (p ⇒ q): Since p is true and q is false, this implication is false. This is because an implication is only false when the antecedent (p) is true and the consequent (q) is false.\n\n2. (q ⇒ p): Since q is false and p is true, this implication is true. This is because an implication is true when the antecedent (q) is false, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (p).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conjunction of the two implications:\n\n[(p ⇒ q) & (q ⇒ p)] = [False & True]\n\nA conjunction is true only when both of its components are true. In this case, one component is false, so the conjunction is false.\n\nTherefore, the truth value for the expression [(p ⇒ q) & (q ⇒ p)] is False."
