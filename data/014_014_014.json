    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHISFUN\" using a Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTO\", we first need to create a 5x5 Playfair square using the key.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key and write the remaining letters from left to right, top to bottom in a 5x5 grid.\n2. Fill the remaining spaces in the grid with the rest of the alphabet (excluding J, which is combined with I in the Playfair cipher) in alphabetical order.\n\nThe Playfair square using the key \"CRYPTO\" will look like this:\n\nC R Y P T\nO A B D E\nF G H I K\nL M N S U\nV W X Z Q\n\nNow, we can encrypt the message \"MATHISFUN\" using the following rules:\n\n1. If both letters are the same, insert an 'X' between them (if the repeated letter is X, use Q instead). In this case, there are no repeated letters.\n2. If the letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the letter to its right (wrapping around to the beginning of the row if necessary). If the letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the letter below it (wrapping around to the top of the column if necessary).\n3. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the letter in its own row but in the column of the other letter.\n\nNow, we can encrypt the message:\n\nM A  T H  I S  F U  N\nL M  R Y  H I  G U  S\n\nEncrypted message: LMRYGUHIS\n\nSo, the encrypted message using the Playfair cipher with the key \"CRYPTO\" is \"LMRYGUHIS\"."
