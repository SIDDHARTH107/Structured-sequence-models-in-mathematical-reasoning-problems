    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we will use the concept of group theory and factorization. The order of a group is the number of its elements. In this case, the order is 96. First, we need to find the prime factorization of 96.\n\nPrime factorization of 96: 2^5 * 3^1\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order:\n\nn(G) = (p^(k+1) - 1) / (p - 1)\n\nwhere n(G) is the number of non-isomorphic groups of order G, p is a prime factor, and k is the exponent of the prime factor in the factorization.\n\nFor the prime factor 2:\n\nn(2^5) = (2^(5+1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = (2^6 - 1) / 1 = 63\n\nFor the prime factor 3:\n\nn(3^1) = (3^(1+1) - 1) / (3 - 1) = (3^2 - 1) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^a * q^b:\n\nn(G) = n(p^a) * n(q^b)\n\nn(96) = n(2^5) * n(3^1) = 63 * 4 = 252\n\nTherefore, there are 252 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
