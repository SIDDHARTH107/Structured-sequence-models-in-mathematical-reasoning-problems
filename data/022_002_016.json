    "message_1": "A math student is asked to solve the following question related to Conformal Mapping:\n\nFind the conformal mapping of the region defined by $Re(z)>0$ and $0 < Im(z) < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ onto the unit disc $|w|<1$. Also, find the image of the points $z = i$ and $z = 1 + i$ under this mapping.",
    "message_2": "To find the conformal mapping of the given region onto the unit disc, we can use a series of transformations. Let's denote the given region as $R$.\n\n1. First, we map the region $R$ to the upper half-plane. We can achieve this by applying the exponential function $w_1 = e^z$. The region $R$ is then transformed to the region where $Re(w_1) > 0$ and $0 < Im(w_1) < \\infty$.\n\n2. Next, we map the upper half-plane to the unit disc. We can use the MÃ¶bius transformation $w_2 = \\frac{w_1 - i}{w_1 + i}$. This transformation maps the upper half-plane to the unit disc $|w_2| < 1$.\n\nNow, let's find the image of the points $z = i$ and $z = 1 + i$ under this mapping.\n\nFor $z = i$:\n\n1. Apply the exponential function: $w_1 = e^z = e^i = \\cos(1) + i\\sin(1)$.\n2. Apply the MÃ¶bius transformation: $w_2 = \\frac{w_1 - i}{w_1 + i} = \\frac{(\\cos(1) + i\\sin(1)) - i}{(\\cos(1) + i\\sin(1)) + i} = \\frac{\\cos(1) + i(\\sin(1) - 1)}{\\cos(1) + i(\\sin(1) + 1)}$.\n\nFor $z = 1 + i$:\n\n1. Apply the exponential function: $w_1 = e^z = e^{1+i} = e(\\cos(1) + i\\sin(1))$.\n2. Apply the MÃ¶bius transformation: $w_2 = \\frac{w_1 - i}{w_1 + i} = \\frac{e(\\cos(1) + i\\sin(1)) - i}{e(\\cos(1) + i\\sin(1)) + i}$.\n\nSo, the conformal mapping of the region $R$ onto the unit disc is given by the composition of the exponential function and the MÃ¶bius transformation:\n\n$$w(z) = \\frac{e^z - i}{e^z + i}$$\n\nAnd the images of the points $z = i$ and $z = 1 + i$ under this mapping are:\n\n$$w(i) = \\frac{\\cos(1) + i(\\sin(1) - 1)}{\\cos(1) + i(\\sin(1) + 1)}$$\n\n$$w(1+i) = \\frac{e(\\cos(1) + i\\sin(1)) - i}{e(\\cos(1) + i\\sin(1)) + i}$$"
