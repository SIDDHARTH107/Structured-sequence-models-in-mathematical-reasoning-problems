    "message_1": "Suppose that on a family trip, the probability of a car breaking down is 0.15 and the probability of encountering heavy traffic is 0.35. What is the probability that the family has encountered heavy traffic or their car has broken down?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of encountering heavy traffic or the car breaking down, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nIn this case, A represents the event of the car breaking down, and B represents the event of encountering heavy traffic. We are given P(A) = 0.15 and P(B) = 0.35. However, we don't have the probability of both events happening simultaneously, P(A ∩ B). \n\nIf we assume that the events are independent (meaning the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other), then we can calculate P(A ∩ B) as follows:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.15 * 0.35 = 0.0525\n\nNow, we can find the probability of encountering heavy traffic or the car breaking down:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.15 + 0.35 - 0.0525 = 0.4475\n\nSo, the probability that the family encounters heavy traffic or their car breaks down is 0.4475 or 44.75%."
