    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product A × B, we form ordered pairs with the elements of A as the first element and the elements of B as the second element. \n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product B × A, where the elements of B are the first element and the elements of A are the second element.\n\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nComparing A × B and B × A, we can see that the ordered pairs are different. For example, (1, 4) is in A × B but not in B × A, and (4, 1) is in B × A but not in A × B. Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative, as A × B ≠ B × A."
