    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(3, 4) is the smallest number of vertices needed to guarantee that either a triangle (a group of 3 vertices all connected to each other) or a group of 4 vertices all not connected to each other exists in the graph.\n\nTo find R(3, 4), we can use the recursive formula for Ramsey numbers:\n\nR(m, n) = R(m-1, n) + R(m, n-1) - 1\n\nFirst, we need to find the base cases R(2, 4) and R(3, 3):\n\nR(2, n) = n, because a graph with n vertices and no edges will have a group of n vertices all not connected to each other.\n\nR(3, 3) = 6, because the smallest complete graph that guarantees a triangle is K_6, which has 6 vertices.\n\nNow we can find R(3, 4):\n\nR(3, 4) = R(2, 4) + R(3, 3) - 1\nR(3, 4) = 4 + 6 - 1\nR(3, 4) = 9\n\nSo the Ramsey number R(3, 4) is 9, which means that in a graph with 9 vertices, you are guaranteed to find either a triangle or a group of 4 vertices all not connected to each other."
