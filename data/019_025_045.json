    "message_2": "To find the total amount of sugar used in a year, first find the amount of sugar used per month by multiplying the number of boxes produced per month by the amount of sugar used per box:\n\n16,000 boxes/month * 341 pounds/box = 5,456,000 pounds/month\n\nNow, multiply this amount by the number of months in a year to find the total amount of sugar used in a year:\n\n5,456,000 pounds/month * 12 months/year = 65,472,000 pounds/year\n\nSo, the factory uses 65,472,000 pounds of sugar in a year."
