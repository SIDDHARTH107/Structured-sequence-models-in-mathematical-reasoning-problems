    "message_2": "To graph the inequality 3x + 4 < 10 on the number line, we first need to solve for x:\n\n1. Subtract 4 from both sides of the inequality:\n3x < 6\n\n2. Divide both sides by 3:\nx < 2\n\nNow we can graph the inequality on the number line. Since x is less than 2, we will use an open circle at 2 to indicate that 2 is not included in the solution set. Then, draw an arrow pointing to the left of the number line to show that all values less than 2 are part of the solution set.\n\nHere's a representation of the graph on the number line:\n\n<---( )---->\n    2"
