    "message_1": "Suppose there are two companies, A and B, competing in the same market with identical products. Company A is the leader in this market and has a production capacity of 200 units per month, while company B's production capacity is 150 units per month. Both companies sell their products at the same price of $10 per unit.\n\nHowever, company A can observe company B's production before deciding on its own production level. If company A produces more than company B, it will force company B out of the market entirely. If company A produces less than or equal to company B, both companies will split the market equally.\n\nAssuming both companies act rationally, what production levels will company A and company B choose? And what will be the profits for each company under these choices?",
    "message_2": "In this scenario, both companies will act rationally to maximize their profits. Company B knows that if it produces more than 150 units, it will be forced out of the market by company A. Therefore, company B will choose to produce at its maximum capacity of 150 units.\n\nCompany A, being able to observe company B's production, will choose to produce the same amount as company B, which is 150 units. This is because if company A produces more than 150 units, it will force company B out of the market, but it will also have excess production that it cannot sell. By producing 150 units, company A ensures that it sells all its production and splits the market equally with company B.\n\nUnder these choices, the profits for each company will be:\n\nCompany A: 150 units * $10 per unit = $1,500\nCompany B: 150 units * $10 per unit = $1,500\n\nBoth companies will have equal profits of $1,500."
