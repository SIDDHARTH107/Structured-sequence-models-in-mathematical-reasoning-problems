    "message_1": "Suppose a survey found that in a particular country, 25% of eligible voters identify as members of Party A and 18% identify as members of Party B. What is the probability that a randomly selected eligible voter in that country does not identify as a member of either Party A or Party B?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected eligible voter does not identify as a member of either Party A or Party B, we can first find the combined percentage of voters who identify as members of Party A or Party B, and then subtract that percentage from 100%.\n\nThe combined percentage of voters who identify as members of Party A or Party B is 25% + 18% = 43%.\n\nNow, subtract this percentage from 100% to find the percentage of voters who do not identify as members of either party:\n\n100% - 43% = 57%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected eligible voter in that country does not identify as a member of either Party A or Party B is 57%."
