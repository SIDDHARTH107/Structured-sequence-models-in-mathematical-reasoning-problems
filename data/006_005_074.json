    "message_1": "A company produces 5000 cell phone batteries in a day at its facility. Out of these, 150 batteries are found to be defective on average in a given day. What is the probability that in a given day, less than 100 batteries will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, defective batteries) in a fixed interval (in this case, a day). The Poisson distribution is given by the formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events (defective batteries)\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of events (defective batteries) per interval (day)\n- k is the number of events we are interested in (less than 100 defective batteries)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to 2.71828\n\nIn this case, λ = 150 defective batteries per day on average. We want to find the probability that less than 100 batteries will be defective, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 99:\n\nP(X < 100) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 99)\n\nWe can calculate each individual probability using the Poisson distribution formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 100) = Σ [(e^(-150) * 150^k) / k!] for k = 0 to 99\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X < 100) ≈ 1.43 × 10^(-9)\n\nSo the probability that less than 100 batteries will be defective in a given day is approximately 1.43 × 10^(-9), or 0.00000000143."
