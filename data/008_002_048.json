    "message_2": "To find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we will use the following formula:\n\nInverse(A) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of the matrix A and adj(A) is the adjugate of the matrix A.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of the given matrix:\n\ndet(A) = (5 * 3) - (7 * 1) = 15 - 7 = 8\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of the matrix:\n\nTo find the adjugate, we will swap the elements in the main diagonal and change the sign of the off-diagonal elements:\n\nadj(A) = | 3 -7 |\n         | -1  5 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse by multiplying the adjugate by the reciprocal of the determinant:\n\nInverse(A) = (1/8) * | 3 -7 |\n                     | -1  5 |\n\nInverse(A) = |  3/8  -7/8 |\n             | -1/8   5/8 |\n\nSo, the inverse of the given matrix is:\n\n|  3/8  -7/8 |\n| -1/8   5/8 |"
