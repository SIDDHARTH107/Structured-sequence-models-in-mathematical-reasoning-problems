    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices will contain either a clique of size m (a complete subgraph with m vertices) or an independent set of size n (a set of n vertices with no edges between them). In the case of R(3,4), we are looking for the smallest number of vertices in a graph that guarantees either a triangle (a clique of size 3) or an independent set of size 4.\n\nThe Ramsey number R(3,4) is known to be 9. This means that in any graph with 9 vertices, there will always be either a triangle or an independent set of size 4."
