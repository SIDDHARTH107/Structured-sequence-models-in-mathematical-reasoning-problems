    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4 at the point (1, 1, sqrt(2)), we first need to find the gradient (normal vector) of the surface at that point.\n\nThe gradient of a scalar function F(x, y, z) is given by the vector (∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y, ∂F/∂z). In this case, F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 4. So, we have:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n∂F/∂z = 2z\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the gradient at the point (1, 1, sqrt(2)):\n\n∂F/∂x(1, 1, sqrt(2)) = 2(1) = 2\n∂F/∂y(1, 1, sqrt(2)) = 2(1) = 2\n∂F/∂z(1, 1, sqrt(2)) = 2(sqrt(2)) = 2sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the gradient (normal vector) at the point (1, 1, sqrt(2)) is (2, 2, 2sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, we can use the point-normal form of the equation of a plane, which is given by:\n\nA(x - x₀) + B(y - y₀) + C(z - z₀) = 0\n\nwhere (A, B, C) is the normal vector and (x₀, y₀, z₀) is the point on the plane. In this case, (A, B, C) = (2, 2, 2sqrt(2)) and (x₀, y₀, z₀) = (1, 1, sqrt(2)). Plugging in these values, we get:\n\n2(x - 1) + 2(y - 1) + 2sqrt(2)(z - sqrt(2)) = 0\n\nThis is the equation of the tangent plane to the surface x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4 at the point (1, 1, sqrt(2))."
