    "message_2": "To determine the treewidth of the given graph, we will first find a tree decomposition of the graph and then compute the width of that tree decomposition. The treewidth is the minimum width over all possible tree decompositions of the graph.\n\nStep 1: Identify a tree decomposition\nA tree decomposition of a graph is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices from the graph, and the tree satisfies the following properties:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices of the graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there is a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the graph, the set of bags containing v forms a connected subtree.\n\nWe will now find a tree decomposition for the given graph:\n\n1. Bag 1: {1, 2, 3}\n2. Bag 2: {2, 3, 4}\n3. Bag 3: {3, 4, 5}\n4. Bag 4: {4, 5, 6}\n5. Bag 5: {5, 6, 7}\n\nThe tree decomposition can be visualized as follows:\n\n```\nBag 1 -- Bag 2 -- Bag 3 -- Bag 4 -- Bag 5\n```\n\nStep 2: Compute the width of the tree decomposition\nThe width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus 1. In our tree decomposition, the largest bag has 3 vertices. Therefore, the width of this tree decomposition is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nStep 3: Determine the treewidth\nThe treewidth of a graph is the minimum width over all possible tree decompositions of the graph. In this case, we have found a tree decomposition with width 2. It is not possible to find a tree decomposition with a smaller width, as the graph contains a cycle of length 4 (1-2-4-3-1), and any tree decomposition of a graph with a cycle of length k must have width at least k-1.\n\nTherefore, the treewidth of the given graph is 2."
