    "message_1": "In a Bertrand competition between two firms, both firms have identical constant marginal costs of $4. The market demand curve is given by Q = 80 - P, where Q is the total quantity demanded in the market and P is the price charged by each firm. What will be the equilibrium price and quantity in the market?",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition, firms compete by setting prices, and consumers buy from the firm with the lowest price. If both firms set the same price, they will split the market demand equally. Since both firms have identical constant marginal costs of $4, they will set their prices equal to their marginal costs to maximize their profits.\n\nLet's find the equilibrium price and quantity in the market:\n\n1. Market demand curve: Q = 80 - P\n2. Both firms set prices equal to their marginal costs: P = $4\n3. Substitute the price into the demand curve to find the equilibrium quantity: Q = 80 - 4 = 76\n\nSo, the equilibrium price in the market is $4, and the equilibrium quantity is 76 units."
