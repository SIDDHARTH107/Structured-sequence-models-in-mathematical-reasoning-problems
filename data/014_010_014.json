    "message_1": "Suppose a substitution cipher is used to encrypt a message by replacing each letter of the alphabet with another letter. If the replacement letter for the letter \"A\" is \"D\", find the number of possible substitution keys for this cipher.",
    "message_2": "Since we know that the letter \"A\" is replaced by the letter \"D\", we have 25 remaining letters to assign to the other 25 letters of the alphabet. For each of the remaining 25 letters, we can choose any of the 25 unassigned letters as their replacement.\n\nFor the first unassigned letter (B), we have 25 choices. After assigning a letter to B, we have 24 choices for the next unassigned letter (C), then 23 choices for the next letter (E), and so on. We continue this process until we have assigned a replacement letter to each of the remaining 25 letters.\n\nThe total number of possible substitution keys can be calculated using the factorial function, which is the product of all positive integers up to a given number. In this case, we want to find the factorial of 25 (denoted as 25!).\n\n25! = 25 × 24 × 23 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 15,511,210,043,330,985,984,000\n\nSo, there are 15,511,210,043,330,985,984,000 possible substitution keys for this cipher."
