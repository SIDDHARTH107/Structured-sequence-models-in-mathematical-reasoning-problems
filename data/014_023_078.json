    "message_2": "To encrypt the plain text \"MATHEMATICS\" using a rail fence cipher with a key of height 3, we arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows:\n\nM   E   A   S\n A T M T I C\n  T   H   T\n\nNow, we read the letters from left to right and top to bottom to obtain the encrypted text:\n\nMEASATMTICTHT\n\nSo, the encrypted text is \"MEASATMTICTHT\"."
