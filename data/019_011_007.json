    "message_2": "In relevance logic, the relevance operator \"⊗\" is used to connect two statements or propositions in such a way that the truth of one is relevant to the truth of the other. However, the given statement \"P = 3 ⊗ 4\" is not well-formed, as it involves numbers (3 and 4) rather than propositions or statements. \n\nRelevance logic typically deals with statements like \"A ⊗ B\" where A and B are propositions (e.g., \"it is raining\" or \"the door is open\"). In this case, since 3 and 4 are not propositions, the statement \"P = 3 ⊗ 4\" is not meaningful in the context of relevance logic, and thus, we cannot assign a truth value to it."
