    "message_1": "Consider two hunters hunting stags. Each can hunt either a stag or a rabbit. If both hunt a stag, they can sell its meat for a profit of 15. If one hunts a stag and the other hunts a rabbit, the one who hunted the stag gets nothing, and the one who hunted the rabbit gets a profit of 5. If both hunt rabbits, they each get a profit of 2. \n\nAssuming both hunters are rational, what is the Nash equilibrium of this stag hunt game?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to analyze the possible outcomes and determine which strategy is best for each hunter, given the other hunter's choice. Let's represent the strategies as follows:\n\nS = Hunt a stag\nR = Hunt a rabbit\n\nWe can create a payoff matrix to represent the possible outcomes:\n\n          Hunter 2\n          S    R\n        --------\nHunter 1 S |15,15| 0,5|\n        --------\n        R | 5, 0| 2,2|\n\nNow, let's find the best response for each hunter given the other hunter's choice:\n\n- If Hunter 2 hunts a stag (S), the best response for Hunter 1 is to also hunt a stag (S) since 15 > 5.\n- If Hunter 2 hunts a rabbit (R), the best response for Hunter 1 is to hunt a rabbit (R) since 2 > 0.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- If Hunter 1 hunts a stag (S), the best response for Hunter 2 is to also hunt a stag (S) since 15 > 5.\n- If Hunter 1 hunts a rabbit (R), the best response for Hunter 2 is to hunt a rabbit (R) since 2 > 0.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when both hunters choose a strategy that is the best response to the other's choice. In this case, there are two Nash equilibria:\n\n1. Both hunters hunt a stag (S, S) with a payoff of (15, 15).\n2. Both hunters hunt a rabbit (R, R) with a payoff of (2, 2)."
