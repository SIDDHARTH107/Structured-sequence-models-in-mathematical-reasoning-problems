    "message_1": "A transposition cipher uses a keyword \"MATH\" to encrypt a message. If the plaintext message is \"SOLVE THIS MATH PROBLEM\", what is the ciphertext produced by the transposition cipher? Assume that the message is written in blocks of five letters per group.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using a transposition cipher with the keyword \"MATH\", we first need to arrange the keyword alphabetically and assign a number to each letter based on its position in the alphabetized keyword. The keyword \"MATH\" becomes \"AHMT\" when arranged alphabetically, so we assign the numbers as follows:\n\nA - 1\nH - 2\nM - 3\nT - 4\n\nNow, we write the plaintext message in blocks of five letters per group:\n\nSOLVE\nTHISM\nATHPR\nOBLEM\n\nNext, we rearrange the columns of the message based on the assigned numbers:\n\n1 - A: STAOB\n2 - H: OVHLE\n3 - M: LTMRE\n4 - T: EISPM\n\nFinally, we read the ciphertext from left to right and top to bottom:\n\nCiphertext: STAOBOVHLELTMREEISPM"
