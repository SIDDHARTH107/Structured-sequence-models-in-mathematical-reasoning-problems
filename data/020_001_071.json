    "message_1": "A soft drink company produces two types of drinks: cola and orange. Each drink requires syrup and water in a specific ratio. The cola drink requires 2 oz of syrup and 4 oz of water, while the orange drink requires 1 oz of syrup and 5 oz of water. The company has 300 oz of syrup and 900 oz of water available each day. If the company makes a profit of $0.20 on each cola drink and $0.15 on each orange drink, how many bottles of each drink should the company produce each day to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of cola drinks and y be the number of orange drinks produced each day.\n\nThe constraints for the available syrup and water are:\n2x + y ≤ 300 (syrup constraint)\n4x + 5y ≤ 900 (water constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP(x, y) = 0.20x + 0.15y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Syrup constraint:\ny ≤ -2x + 300\n\n2. Water constraint:\ny ≤ (-4/5)x + 180\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 180), (150, 0), and (100, 100).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 0.20(0) + 0.15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 180) = 0.20(0) + 0.15(180) = $27\n3. P(150, 0) = 0.20(150) + 0.15(0) = $30\n4. P(100, 100) = 0.20(100) + 0.15(100) = $35\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 100 bottles of cola and 100 bottles of orange drinks each day, resulting in a profit of $35."
