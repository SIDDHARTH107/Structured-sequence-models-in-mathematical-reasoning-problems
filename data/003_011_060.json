    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet's denote the height of the building as h meters, and the height from the person's eyes to the top of the building as x meters. Then, the height from the ground to the top of the building will be (x + 1.6) meters.\n\nSince the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, we can write the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(45) = x / 60\n\nWe know that the tangent of 45 degrees is 1, so:\n\n1 = x / 60\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 60 * 1\nx = 60 meters\n\nNow, we can find the height of the building from the ground:\n\nh = x + 1.6\nh = 60 + 1.6\nh = 61.6 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is 61.6 meters."
