    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2x + 3y = 12 given that x = 4, we will substitute the value of x into the equation.\n\n2(4) + 3y = 12\n\nNow, we will simplify and solve for y:\n\n8 + 3y = 12\n\nNext, we will subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:\n\n3y = 4\n\nFinally, we will divide both sides by 3 to find the value of y:\n\ny = 4/3\n\nSo, the solution of the equation 2x + 3y = 12 given that x = 4 is y = 4/3."
