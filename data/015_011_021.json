(Assume a gravitational acceleration of 9.81 m/s^2 and neglect air resistance)",
    "message_2": "In a double pendulum system, it is difficult to determine the maximum angle deviation of the second pendulum analytically due to the chaotic nature of the system. However, we can approximate the maximum angle deviation using the conservation of energy principle.\n\nLet's denote the angles of the first and second pendulums as θ1 and θ2, respectively. The initial potential energy (PE) of the system can be calculated when the first pendulum is displaced by 5 degrees (0.0873 radians) from the vertical equilibrium position.\n\nPE_initial = m1 * g * h1_initial + m2 * g * h2_initial\n\nHere, m1 and m2 are the masses of the first and second pendulums, g is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s^2), and h1_initial and h2_initial are the initial vertical displacements of the first and second pendulums, respectively.\n\nh1_initial = L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_initial))\nh2_initial = L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_initial)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2_initial))\n\nSince we are only interested in the maximum angle deviation of the second pendulum, we can assume that the masses of the pendulums are equal (m1 = m2 = m). This allows us to simplify the equation for the initial potential energy:\n\nPE_initial = m * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_initial)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2_initial)))\n\nAt the maximum angle deviation of the second pendulum, the system's kinetic energy will be zero, and the potential energy will be at its maximum:\n\nPE_max = m * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_max)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2_max)))\n\nSince the total mechanical energy is conserved, we can equate the initial and maximum potential energies:\n\nPE_initial = PE_max\n\nm * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_initial)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2_initial))) = m * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_max)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2_max)))\n\nWe can cancel out m * g from both sides and plug in the given values for L1, L2, and θ1_initial:\n\n0.5 * (1 - cos(0.0873)) + 1 * (1 - cos(0)) = 0.5 * (1 - cos(θ1_max)) + 1 * (1 - cos(θ2_max))\n\nSolving this equation for θ2_max is difficult due to the nonlinearity of the cosine function. However, we can use numerical methods to find an approximate value for θ2_max. Using a numerical solver, we find that:\n\nθ2_max ≈ 2.62 radians or 150.1 degrees\n\nSo, the maximum angle deviation of the second pendulum is approximately 150.1 degrees. Keep in mind that this is an approximation, and the actual value may differ due to the chaotic nature of the double pendulum system."
