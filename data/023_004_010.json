    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^(-t)u(t), we will use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt from -∞ to ∞\n\nSince u(t) = 0 for t < 0, we can change the limits of integration to 0 and ∞:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-t) * e^(-jωt)] dt from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-t(1 + jω))] dt from 0 to ∞\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by substitution. Let x = (1 + jω)t, so dx = (1 + jω)dt. Then, dt = dx / (1 + jω). The new limits of integration are x = 0 (when t = 0) and x = ∞ (when t = ∞).\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-x) * (dx / (1 + jω))] from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we can take the constant factor (1 + jω) out of the integral:\n\nF(ω) = (1 / (1 + jω)) * ∫[e^(-x)] dx from 0 to ∞\n\nThe integral of e^(-x) is -e^(-x), so we can evaluate the integral:\n\nF(ω) = (1 / (1 + jω)) * [-e^(-x)] from 0 to ∞\n\nF(ω) = (1 / (1 + jω)) * [-e^(-∞) + e^(0)]\n\nF(ω) = (1 / (1 + jω)) * [1]\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^(-t)u(t) is:\n\nF(ω) = 1 / (1 + jω)"
