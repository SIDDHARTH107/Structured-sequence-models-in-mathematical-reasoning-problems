    "message_2": "First, let's note that the order of A5 is 5! / 2 = 60, so G cannot be isomorphic to A5 since their orders are different.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities for G. The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is n_2 = 1, which means there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P of order 8. Since P is unique, it must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nSimilarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 4. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup Q of order 3, which is also normal in G.\n\nIf both P and Q are normal in G, then their product PQ is a subgroup of G with order |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 8 * 3 / 1 = 24, so PQ = G. Since P and Q are both abelian (as they have prime order), G is also abelian in this case. The only abelian group of order 24 is the cyclic group C24, so G is isomorphic to C24.\n\nIf n_3 = 4, there are four 3-Sylow subgroups, and none of them are normal in G. In this case, we can use the semidirect product to construct non-abelian groups of order 24. There are five possible non-abelian groups of order 24 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. The dihedral group D12 of order 24.\n2. The semidirect product of Z8 and Z3, where Z3 acts on Z8 by inverting elements.\n3. The semidirect product of Z4 × Z2 and Z3, where Z3 acts on Z4 × Z2 by inverting elements in Z4 and fixing Z2.\n4. The semidirect product of Z4 × Z2 and Z3, where Z3 acts on Z4 × Z2 by inverting elements in both Z4 and Z2.\n5. The semidirect product of Z2 × Z2 × Z2 and Z3, where Z3 acts on Z2 × Z2 × Z2 by permuting the three Z2 factors.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 24, it is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C24 or one of the five non-abelian groups listed above. It cannot be isomorphic to the alternating group A5, as its order is different."
