Person A knows that there is at least one liar among B and C, person B knows that there is at least one liar among A and C, and person C knows that there is at least one liar among A and B. If we know that exactly two out of the three people are liars, then who are the liars?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. If A and B are liars:\n   - A's statement is false, meaning there is no liar among B and C. This contradicts the assumption that A is a liar.\n   - B's statement is false, meaning there is no liar among A and C. This contradicts the assumption that B is a liar.\n\n2. If A and C are liars:\n   - A's statement is false, meaning there is no liar among B and C. This is consistent with the assumption that A is a liar.\n   - C's statement is false, meaning there is no liar among A and B. This contradicts the assumption that A is a liar.\n\n3. If B and C are liars:\n   - B's statement is false, meaning there is no liar among A and C. This is consistent with the assumption that B is a liar.\n   - C's statement is false, meaning there is no liar among A and B. This is consistent with the assumption that C is a liar.\n\nFrom the analysis above, the only consistent scenario is that B and C are the liars."
