    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, there are N = 4 self-similar pieces, and the scaling factor is s = √2.\n\nD = log(4) / log(√2) ≈ 2 / log(√2)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nD ≈ 2 / 0.5 = 4\n\nHowever, this is not the correct Hausdorff dimension for the Lévy C curve. The actual Hausdorff dimension is approximately 1.934, which can be found using more advanced techniques and calculations.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve is approximately 1.93 when rounded to two decimal places."
