    "message_1": "A double pendulum consists of two pendulums attached to each other. Consider a double pendulum system with masses and lengths of the pendulums are given as m1=1 kg, m2=2 kg, l1=1 m and l2=0.5 m respectively. If the initial angles between the pendulums and the vertical are 30° and 45° and the initial angular velocities are zero, find the angular displacement of the second pendulum after 10 seconds. Assume no frictional force acts on the system.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Lagrangian mechanics approach. The Lagrangian L is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy T and the potential energy U of the system:\n\nL = T - U\n\nFirst, let's find the expressions for the kinetic and potential energies of the double pendulum system. Let θ1 and θ2 be the angles between the first and second pendulums and the vertical, respectively.\n\nThe positions of the two masses are given by:\n\nx1 = l1 * sin(θ1)\ny1 = -l1 * cos(θ1)\nx2 = l1 * sin(θ1) + l2 * sin(θ2)\ny2 = -l1 * cos(θ1) - l2 * cos(θ2)\n\nThe velocities of the two masses are given by the time derivatives of the positions:\n\nv1x = l1 * θ1_dot * cos(θ1)\nv1y = l1 * θ1_dot * sin(θ1)\nv2x = l1 * θ1_dot * cos(θ1) + l2 * θ2_dot * cos(θ2)\nv2y = l1 * θ1_dot * sin(θ1) + l2 * θ2_dot * sin(θ2)\n\nThe kinetic energy T is given by:\n\nT = 0.5 * m1 * (v1x^2 + v1y^2) + 0.5 * m2 * (v2x^2 + v2y^2)\n\nThe potential energy U is given by:\n\nU = m1 * g * y1 + m2 * g * y2\n\nNow we can write the Lagrangian L:\n\nL = T - U\n\nTo find the equations of motion, we will use the Euler-Lagrange equations:\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂θ1_dot) - ∂L/∂θ1 = 0\nd/dt(∂L/∂θ2_dot) - ∂L/∂θ2 = 0\n\nSolving these equations for the double pendulum system is quite complex and typically requires numerical methods. However, we can use the initial conditions to simplify the problem. Since the initial angular velocities are zero (θ1_dot(0) = 0 and θ2_dot(0) = 0), we can use the small-angle approximation for the initial angles (sin(θ) ≈ θ and cos(θ) ≈ 1 for small θ). This allows us to linearize the equations of motion and find an approximate solution.\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation and the initial angles, we can write the linearized equations of motion as:\n\nθ1_double_dot ≈ -g/l1 * θ1\nθ2_double_dot ≈ -g/l2 * θ2\n\nThese are simple harmonic oscillators with angular frequencies:\n\nω1 = sqrt(g/l1)\nω2 = sqrt(g/l2)\n\nThe general solutions for θ1(t) and θ2(t) are:\n\nθ1(t) = A1 * cos(ω1 * t + φ1)\nθ2(t) = A2 * cos(ω2 * t + φ2)\n\nUsing the initial conditions (θ1(0) = 30°, θ2(0) = 45°, θ1_dot(0) = 0, θ2_dot(0) = 0), we can find the amplitudes and phases:\n\nA1 = 30°, φ1 = 0\nA2 = 45°, φ2 = 0\n\nNow we can find the angular displacement of the second pendulum after 10 seconds:\n\nθ2(10) = A2 * cos(ω2 * 10)\n\nFirst, let's find ω2:\n\nω2 = sqrt(g/l2) = sqrt(9.81/0.5) ≈ 4.43 rad/s\n\nNow we can find θ2(10):\n\nθ2(10) = 45° * cos(4.43 * 10) ≈ 45° * cos(44.3) ≈ -29.5°\n\nSo, the angular displacement of the second pendulum after 10 seconds is approximately -29.5°. Keep in mind that this is an approximate solution based on the small-angle approximation and the initial conditions."
