    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and M is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, after each iteration, each line segment is replaced by 4 new segments, so N = 4. The scaling factor is the length of each new segment, which is 1/3 of the original length, so M = 3.\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.261\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after iterating the process infinitely many times is approximately 1.261 (rounded to three decimal places)."
