    "message_2": "The Koch island is a fractal formed by applying the Koch curve construction to a closed loop, such as an equilateral triangle. The fractal dimension, D, of the Koch island can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, after each iteration, each line segment is replaced by 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original. So, N = 4 and S = 3.\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe fractal dimension of the Koch island remains the same after any number of iterations, including 5 iterations. So, the fractal dimension of the Koch island after 5 iterations is approximately 1.2619, regardless of the original line segment's length."
