If A is replaced by D, B is replaced by F, and C is replaced by H, what is the ciphertext for the message \"MATHEMATICS\"?",

Since A is replaced by D, we can infer that the substitution pattern follows a shift of 3 positions forward in the alphabet.\n\nSo, the substitution pattern would be:\n\nA -> D, B -> F, C -> H, D -> G, E -> I, F -> J, G -> K, H -> L, I -> M, J -> N, K -> O, L -> P, M -> R, N -> S, O -> T, P -> U, Q -> V, R -> W, S -> X, T -> Y, U -> Z, V -> A, W -> B, X -> C, Y -> D, Z -> E\n\nNow, let's encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using this substitution pattern:\n\nM -> R\nA -> D\nT -> Y\nH -> L\nE -> I\nM -> R\nA -> D\nT -> Y\nI -> M\nC -> H\nS -> X\n\nThe ciphertext for the message \"MATHEMATICS\" is \"RDYLIYRDMHX\"."
