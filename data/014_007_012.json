    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext using a stream cipher with the given secret key and initial vector, we first need to generate a keystream. In this case, we will use a simple linear feedback shift register (LFSR) to generate the keystream. The LFSR will use the secret key as the initial state and the IV as the feedback coefficients.\n\n1. Initialize the LFSR with the secret key \"1101\".\n2. For each bit of the plaintext, shift the LFSR and XOR the output with the plaintext bit.\n\nLFSR steps:\nInitial state: 1101\nStep 1: 1011 (XOR 1 and 1 with IV 0110)\nStep 2: 0111 (XOR 1 and 0 with IV 0110)\nStep 3: 1010 (XOR 0 and 1 with IV 0110)\nStep 4: 0101 (XOR 1 and 0 with IV 0110)\nStep 5: 0010 (XOR 0 and 1 with IV 0110)\nStep 6: 1001 (XOR 1 and 0 with IV 0110)\nStep 7: 1100 (XOR 0 and 1 with IV 0110)\nStep 8: 1110 (XOR 1 and 1 with IV 0110)\nStep 9: 1111 (XOR 1 and 1 with IV 0110)\nStep 10: 1111 (XOR 1 and 1 with IV 0110)\nStep 11: 1111 (XOR 1 and 1 with IV 0110)\nStep 12: 1111 (XOR 1 and 1 with IV 0110)\n\nKeystream: 1011 0111 0101\n\nNow, XOR the plaintext with the keystream:\n\nPlaintext:  1010 0111 0001\nKeystream:  1011 0111 0101\nCiphertext: 0001 0000 0100\n\nSo, the output of the stream cipher is the ciphertext \"0001 0000 0100\"."
