    "message_2": "Using the Law of Sines, we have:\n\n(sin C) / c = (sin A) / a = (sin B) / b\n\nWe are given a, b, and angle C. We need to find the length of side c. We can rearrange the formula to solve for c:\n\nc = (sin C) * b / sin B = (sin C) * a / sin A\n\nFirst, we need to find either angle A or angle B. We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so:\n\nA + B + C = 180\nA + B = 180 - C\nA + B = 180 - 30\nA + B = 150\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Sines to find either angle A or angle B. Let's find angle A:\n\n(sin A) / a = (sin C) / c\nsin A = (a * sin C) / c\n\nWe know a = 10 and C = 30 degrees. We can plug these values into the equation:\n\nsin A = (10 * sin(30)) / c\n\nNow, we know that sin(30) = 0.5, so:\n\nsin A = (10 * 0.5) / c\nsin A = 5 / c\n\nNow, we can use the sum of angles A and B to find angle B:\n\nB = 150 - A\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Sines to find c:\n\nc = (sin C) * b / sin B = (sin C) * a / sin A\n\nWe know b = 15 and C = 30 degrees. We can plug these values into the equation:\n\nc = (sin(30) * 15) / sin(150 - A)\n\nWe know that sin(30) = 0.5, so:\n\nc = (0.5 * 15) / sin(150 - A)\nc = 7.5 / sin(150 - A)\n\nNow, we can use the sin A value we found earlier:\n\nsin(150 - A) = sin(150) * cos(A) - cos(150) * sin(A)\n\nWe know that sin(150) = 0.5 and cos(150) = -√3/2. We can plug these values into the equation:\n\nsin(150 - A) = 0.5 * cos(A) + (√3/2) * (5 / c)\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Sines to find c:\n\nc = (0.5 * 15) / (0.5 * cos(A) + (√3/2) * (5 / c))\n\nWe can simplify the equation:\n\nc = 7.5 / (0.5 * cos(A) + (√3/2) * (5 / c))\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by (0.5 * cos(A) + (√3/2) * (5 / c)) to get rid of the denominator:\n\nc * (0.5 * cos(A) + (√3/2) * (5 / c)) = 7.5\n\nNow, we can distribute c:\n\n0.5 * c * cos(A) + (√3/2) * 5 = 7.5\n\nNow, we can use the fact that cos(A) = √(1 - sin^2(A)):\n\n0.5 * c * √(1 - (5/c)^2) + (√3/2) * 5 = 7.5\n\nNow, we can square both sides to get rid of the square root:\n\n(0.5 * c * √(1 - (5/c)^2))^2 + 2 * (0.5 * c * √(1 - (5/c)^2)) * (√3/2) * 5 + ((√3/2) * 5)^2 = 7.5^2\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\n0.25 * c^2 * (1 - (5/c)^2) + 5 * √3 * c * √(1 - (5/c)^2) + 75/4 = 56.25\n\nNow, we can use a numerical method, such as the Newton-Raphson method or a calculator, to find the value of c:\n\nc ≈ 11.59\n\nSo, the length of side c is approximately 11.59 units."
