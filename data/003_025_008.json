    "message_1": "A boat has sailed 10 km north and 15 km east. Find the magnitude and direction of the boat's resulting displacement from its original position using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the boat's displacement, we can use the Pythagorean theorem since the boat's movement forms a right triangle with the north and east displacements as legs.\n\nLet R be the magnitude of the resulting displacement. Then,\n\nR^2 = (10 km)^2 + (15 km)^2\nR^2 = 100 km^2 + 225 km^2\nR^2 = 325 km^2\nR = √325 km ≈ 18.03 km\n\nSo, the magnitude of the boat's displacement is approximately 18.03 km.\n\nNow, let's find the direction of the displacement. We can use the tangent function to find the angle θ between the north direction and the displacement vector.\n\ntan(θ) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(θ) = (15 km) / (10 km)\ntan(θ) = 1.5\n\nθ = arctan(1.5) ≈ 56.31°\n\nThe direction of the boat's displacement is approximately 56.31° east of north."
