    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 5 ≤ 11, we first need to isolate x:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality:\n2x ≤ 6\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\nx ≤ 3\n\nSo the solution set of the inequality is x ≤ 3. On the coordinate plane, this would be represented by a solid line at x = 3 and shading to the left of the line, indicating that all values of x less than or equal to 3 are part of the solution set."
