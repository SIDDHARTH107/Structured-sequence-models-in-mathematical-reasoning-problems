    "message_1": "What is the time complexity of a mathematical algorithm that sorts an array of n integers using QuickSort?",
    "message_2": "The time complexity of QuickSort algorithm depends on the choice of the pivot element and the partitioning of the array. In the best case, when the pivot element divides the array into two equal halves, the time complexity is O(n*log(n)). In the worst case, when the pivot element is the smallest or largest element, the time complexity is O(n^2). However, the average case time complexity of QuickSort is O(n*log(n)), which makes it an efficient sorting algorithm for most practical scenarios."
