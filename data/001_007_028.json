    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 3 < 7 - x, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Add x to both sides of the inequality to isolate the x terms on one side.\n2x + x + 3 < 7 - x + x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n3x + 3 < 7\n\nStep 2: Subtract 3 from both sides of the inequality to isolate the x term.\n3x + 3 - 3 < 7 - 3\n\nThis simplifies to:\n3x < 4\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the inequality by 3 to solve for x.\n3x / 3 < 4 / 3\n\nThis simplifies to:\nx < 4/3\n\nSo the solution to the inequality is x < 4/3."
