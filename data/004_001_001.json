    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x + 7, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(x^3)/dx + d(2x^2)/dx - d(4x)/dx + d(7)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 3(2)^2 + 4(2) - 4\nf'(2) = 3(4) + 8 - 4\nf'(2) = 12 + 8 - 4\nf'(2) = 16\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x + 7 at x = 2 is 16."
