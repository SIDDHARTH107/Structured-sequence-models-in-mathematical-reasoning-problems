    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve can be determined using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, at each iteration, the number of segments (N) increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment (s) is reduced to 1/3 of the previous length.\n\nSo, in this case, N = 4 and s = 1/3.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is approximately 1.2619."
