    "message_1": "In a beauty contest game, there are 100 players. Each player is asked to select a number between 0 and 100. The winner is the player who selects the number that is closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers selected. \n\nWhat number should each player choose to have the best chance of winning?",
    "message_2": "Let's assume that all players are rational and will try to choose the best number to maximize their chances of winning. \n\nLet x be the average of all numbers selected by the players. Then, the target number to win the game is (2/3)x. \n\nSince all players are rational, they will also assume that the other players will choose numbers close to the target number. Therefore, they will choose numbers close to (2/3)x.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum possible value of x. Since the maximum number that can be chosen is 100, the maximum possible average x is 100 (if all players choose 100). In this case, the target number would be (2/3)(100) = 200/3 ≈ 66.67.\n\nHowever, since all players are rational, they will realize that the average cannot be 100, as everyone would choose a number close to 66.67. So, the average x will be lower than 100.\n\nLet's assume that all players choose numbers close to 66.67. In this case, the average x would be around 66.67, and the target number would be (2/3)(66.67) ≈ 44.44.\n\nAgain, since all players are rational, they will realize that the average cannot be 66.67, as everyone would choose a number close to 44.44. So, the average x will be lower than 66.67.\n\nThis process of iteratively lowering the average and the target number will continue until the target number converges to a stable value.\n\nIn this game, the target number converges to 0. To see why, let's assume that all players choose numbers close to 0. In this case, the average x would be around 0, and the target number would be (2/3)(0) = 0. Since the target number is already 0, there is no need to lower the average further.\n\nTherefore, to have the best chance of winning, each player should choose the number 0."
