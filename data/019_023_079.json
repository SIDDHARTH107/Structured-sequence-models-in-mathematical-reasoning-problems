    "message_2": "To find the 10th term in the sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence:\n\nan = a1 * r^(n-1)\n\nwhere an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.\n\nIn this case, a1 = 2, r = 3, and n = 10.\n\na10 = 2 * 3^(10-1)\na10 = 2 * 3^9\na10 = 2 * 19683\na10 = 39366\n\nSo, the 10th term in the sequence is 39,366."
