    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the algebraic curve given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - x^2$, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 2x$\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nA point on the curve is a singularity if both partial derivatives are zero at that point. So we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$3x^2 - 2x = 0$\n$2y = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $y = 0$. Now, substitute this into the curve equation:\n\n$0 = x^3 - x^2$\n\nFactor out x:\n\n$x(x^2 - x) = 0$\n\nSo we have two possible values for x: $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. Thus, we have two singular points: $(0, 0)$ and $(1, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the type of singularity at each point. To do this, we will compute the discriminant of the curve:\n\n$\\Delta = 4(\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2})^2 - 27(\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2})^2$\n\nFirst, find the second partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x - 2$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 0$\n\nNow, compute the discriminant:\n\n$\\Delta = 4(6x - 2)^2 - 27(0)^2 = 4(6x - 2)^2$\n\nFor the point $(0, 0)$:\n\n$\\Delta(0, 0) = 4(6(0) - 2)^2 = 16$\n\nSince $\\Delta > 0$, the singularity at $(0, 0)$ is a node.\n\nFor the point $(1, 0)$:\n\n$\\Delta(1, 0) = 4(6(1) - 2)^2 = 64$\n\nSince $\\Delta > 0$, the singularity at $(1, 0)$ is also a node.\n\nIn conclusion, the algebraic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x^2$ has two singular points: $(0, 0)$ and $(1, 0)$. Both singularities are nodes."
