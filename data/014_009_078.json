    "message_1": "Consider a Feistel cipher structure with 16 rounds of encryption, where the block size is 64 bits and the key size is 128 bits. If the round function uses a substitution table of size 8 bits and a permutation table of size 16 bits, how many bits does the ciphertext block contain?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, the block size of the plaintext remains the same after encryption. Since the block size is 64 bits, the ciphertext block will also contain 64 bits."
