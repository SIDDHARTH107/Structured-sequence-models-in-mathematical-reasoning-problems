    "message_1": "Suppose you are a thief planning on stealing some valuable items from a house. There are five items with a value and weight as follows:\n\nItem 1 - Value $50, Weight 3 kg\nItem 2 - Value $80, Weight 4 kg\nItem 3 - Value $110, Weight 5 kg\nItem 4 - Value $60, Weight 2 kg\nItem 5 - Value $70, Weight 3 kg\n\nYou need to carry all the items that you are stealing in a knapsack with a maximum capacity of 10 kg. What is the maximum total value of items that you can steal?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum total value of items that can be stolen, we can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this 0/1 knapsack problem. We will create a table to store the maximum value that can be obtained with a certain weight limit and considering a certain number of items.\n\nLet's create a table with 6 rows (including 0 items) and 11 columns (including 0 kg capacity). We will fill the table row by row, considering one more item at each step.\n\nFor each cell, we have two options:\n1. Exclude the current item and take the value from the cell above (same weight, one less item).\n2. Include the current item and take the value from the cell with the remaining weight and one less item, and add the value of the current item.\n\nWe will choose the maximum of these two options for each cell.\n\nAfter filling the table, the bottom-right cell will contain the maximum total value that can be stolen.\n\nHere's the filled table:\n\n```\n  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10\n0  0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n1  0   0   0  50  50  50  50  50  50  50  50\n2  0   0   0  50  80  80  80 130 130 130 130\n3  0   0   0  50  80 110 110 130 160 190 190\n4  0   0  60  60  80 140 140 170 200 200 230\n5  0   0  60  70  80 140 150 170 200 210 230\n```\n\nThe maximum total value that can be stolen is $230, which can be achieved by taking items 2, 4, and 5 (total weight 4 + 2 + 3 = 9 kg)."
