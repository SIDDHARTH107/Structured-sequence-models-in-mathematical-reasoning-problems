    "message_1": "Suppose the current price of ABC stock is $50, and the probability of a price increase in the next month is 60% and the probability of a price decrease is 40%. What is the probability that the stock price will increase to $60?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the stock price increasing to $60, we need more information about the potential price changes. The given probabilities only tell us the likelihood of a price increase or decrease, but not the specific amounts by which the price could change.\n\nIf we had information about the distribution of potential price changes, we could calculate the probability of the stock price reaching $60. For example, if we knew that a price increase would always result in a $10 increase, then the probability of the stock price reaching $60 would be 60% (the probability of a price increase). However, without more information about the potential price changes, we cannot determine the probability of the stock price increasing to $60."
