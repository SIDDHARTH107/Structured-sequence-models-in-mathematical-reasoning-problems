    "message_1": "A group of 6 friends want to sit at a circular table such that no 3 friends sit together. How many ways can they be seated?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to arrange the 6 friends around the circular table. Since there is no starting point in a circle, we consider one person fixed, and arrange the remaining 5 friends. So, there are 5! = 120 ways to arrange them.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways in which at least one group of 3 friends sit together. We can treat the group of 3 friends as a single entity, so we have 4 entities to arrange around the table (3 individual friends and 1 group of 3 friends). There are 4! = 24 ways to arrange these entities. However, within the group of 3 friends, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange them. So, there are 24 * 6 = 144 ways to arrange the friends with at least one group of 3 friends sitting together.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways in which at least two groups of 3 friends sit together. Since there are only 6 friends, this situation is not possible.\n\nUsing the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we can find the number of ways to arrange the friends such that no 3 friends sit together:\n\nTotal ways - Ways with at least one group of 3 friends sitting together = 120 - 144 = -24\n\nHowever, we have a negative value, which indicates that we have overcounted some arrangements. This is because when we calculated the number of ways in which at least one group of 3 friends sit together, we also counted the cases where all 6 friends sit together (which is not allowed). There is only 1 way in which all 6 friends can sit together (in a circle), so we need to add this back to our calculation:\n\nTotal ways - Ways with at least one group of 3 friends sitting together + Ways with all 6 friends sitting together = -24 + 1 = -23\n\nSince the number of ways cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement or the conditions are contradictory. In this case, it seems that the condition \"no 3 friends sit together\" is too restrictive for a group of 6 friends sitting around a circular table."
