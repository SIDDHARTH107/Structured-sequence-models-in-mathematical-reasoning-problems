    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A x B:\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find (A x B) ∩ B. Since B contains only single elements and A x B contains ordered pairs, there are no common elements between the two sets. Therefore, the intersection is an empty set:\n(A x B) ∩ B = ∅\n\nNext, let's find B ∩ {3}. The only element that is common between B and {3} is 3, so:\nB ∩ {3} = {3}\n\nNow, let's find A x (B ∩ {3}):\nA x {3} = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, we can see that (A x B) ∩ B = ∅ and A x (B ∩ {3}) = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}. Since these two results are not equal, this demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
