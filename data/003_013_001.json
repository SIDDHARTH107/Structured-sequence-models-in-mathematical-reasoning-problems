    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = sin(x) + 2cos(x) on the interval [0, π], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (sin(x) + 2cos(x))\nf'(x) = cos(x) - 2sin(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x where f'(x) = 0:\n\ncos(x) - 2sin(x) = 0\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1\n\nWe can rewrite the equation in terms of sin(x) or cos(x):\n\ncos(x) = 2sin(x)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\ncos^2(x) = 4sin^2(x)\n\nNow, substitute the trigonometric identity:\n\n1 - sin^2(x) = 4sin^2(x)\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n5sin^2(x) = 1\n\nDivide by 5:\n\nsin^2(x) = 1/5\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nsin(x) = ±√(1/5)\n\nSince we are looking for the critical points in the interval [0, π], we only consider the positive value:\n\nsin(x) = √(1/5)\n\nNow, find the corresponding value of x:\n\nx = arcsin(√(1/5))\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function f(x) at the critical point x and at the endpoints of the interval [0, π]:\n\nf(0) = sin(0) + 2cos(0) = 0 + 2 = 2\nf(arcsin(√(1/5))) = sin(arcsin(√(1/5))) + 2cos(arcsin(√(1/5)))\nf(π) = sin(π) + 2cos(π) = 0 - 2 = -2\n\nThe maximum value of the function on the interval [0, π] is 2, which occurs at x = 0.\nThe minimum value of the function on the interval [0, π] is -2, which occurs at x = π."
