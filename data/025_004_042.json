Let's use elimination:\n\nSubtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n3(-2 + d) + 1(1 + d) = 4a - 2b + c - a - b - c\n3d - 6 + d + 1 = 3a - b\n4d - 5 = 3a - b  (4)\n\nSubtract equation (2) from equation (3):\n\n5(4 + d) + 1(1 + d) = 16a + 4b + c - a - b - c\n5d + 20 + d + 1 = 15a + 3b\n6d + 21 = 15a + 3b  (5)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:\n\n4) 4d - 5 = 3a - b\n5) 6d + 21 = 15a + 3b\n\nMultiply equation (4) by 3 and equation (5) by -1 to eliminate b:\n\n12d - 15 = 9a - 3b\n-6d - 21 = -15a - 3b\n\nAdd the two equations:\n\n6d - 36 = -6a\nd - 6 = -a\n\nNow we can find the value of d:\n\nd = -a + 6\n\nSubstitute the value of d in equation (4):\n\n4(-a + 6) - 5 = 3a - b\n-4a + 24 - 5 = 3a - b\n-7a + 19 = -b\n\nNow we have the values of a and d in terms of b:\n\na = -d + 6\nd = -a + 6\nb = -7a + 19\n\nWe can't find the exact values of a, b, c, and d without more information, but we can express the equation of the rational curve in terms of a:\n\ny = (a(x^2 - x + 6) - 7ax + 19) / (x - a + 6)\n\nThis equation represents a family of rational curves that pass through the points (-2, 3), (1, -1), and (4, 5)."
