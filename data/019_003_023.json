    "message_2": "In modal logic, we use the symbols ◊ (diamond) for \"possibly\" and □ (box) for \"necessarily.\" Let's represent the given statement using these symbols:\n\n\"If it is possible that it is sunny today and not raining today, then it is necessarily not snowing today.\"\n\nThis can be written as: (◊(S ∧ ¬R)) → (□¬S)\n\nWe are given that S = true and R = false. Therefore, ¬R = true. Now, let's evaluate the statement:\n\n(◊(S ∧ ¬R)) → (□¬S)\n(◊(true ∧ true)) → (□false)\n\nSince (true ∧ true) is true, we have:\n\n(◊true) → (□false)\n\nIn modal logic, \"possibly true\" is always true, so we have:\n\ntrue → (□false)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \"necessarily not snowing today\" is true or false. Since we don't have any information about snowing, we cannot determine the truth value of (□¬S). Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of the entire statement."
