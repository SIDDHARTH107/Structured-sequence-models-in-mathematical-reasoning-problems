    "message_1": "In a company, the probability of any employee committing financial fraud is 0.05. If the company has 200 employees, what is the probability that at least 10 employees have committed financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k employees committing financial fraud\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k employees from n employees (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of an employee committing financial fraud (0.05)\n- n is the total number of employees (200)\n- k is the number of employees committing financial fraud (we want at least 10)\n\nSince we want the probability of at least 10 employees committing financial fraud, we need to find the probability of 10, 11, 12, ..., 200 employees committing financial fraud and sum them up. However, it's easier to find the complementary probability (the probability of 0 to 9 employees committing financial fraud) and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 9:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 9\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = Σ C(200, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(200-k) for k = 0 to 9\n\nAfter calculating the sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) ≈ 0.8648\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9) = 1 - 0.8648 ≈ 0.1352\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 employees have committed financial fraud is approximately 0.1352 or 13.52%."
