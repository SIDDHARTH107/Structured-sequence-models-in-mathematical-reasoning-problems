    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 30 is 2 × 3 × 5. \n\nLet G be a group of order 30. By Sylow theorems, we know the following:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) divides 15 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. So, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 10 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. So, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) divides 6 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. So, n_5 can only be 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. If n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5. In this case, G is the direct product of P_2, P_3, and P_5, which means G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 30, Z_30.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 10, then G has 3 Sylow 2-subgroups and 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, G cannot be a simple group, as there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup. Let N be the normalizer of a Sylow 2-subgroup P_2. Then, |G:N| = n_2 = 3, so |N| = 10. Since N has order 10, it is either isomorphic to Z_10 or D_10 (the dihedral group of order 10). If N is isomorphic to Z_10, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Z_5 and Z_6, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 30, D_30. If N is isomorphic to D_10, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Z_5 and D_10, which is a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nThus, there are two distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30: the cyclic group Z_30 and the dihedral group D_30."
