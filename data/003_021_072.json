    "message_1": "A plane is flying at a velocity of 300 km/h towards the north, while the wind is blowing at a velocity of 50 km/h towards the east. Find the angle between the plane's velocity and the resultant velocity of the plane with respect to the ground, using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between the plane's velocity and the resultant velocity, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. Let's denote the angle we want to find as θ.\n\nFirst, we need to find the magnitude of the resultant velocity. We can do this using the Pythagorean theorem, since the plane's velocity and the wind's velocity are perpendicular to each other:\n\nResultant velocity (Vr) = √(Vp^2 + Vw^2)\nwhere Vp is the plane's velocity and Vw is the wind's velocity.\n\nVr = √(300^2 + 50^2)\nVr = √(90000 + 2500)\nVr = √92500\nVr ≈ 304.14 km/h\n\nNow, we can use the tangent function to find the angle θ:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(θ) = Vw / Vp\ntan(θ) = 50 / 300\n\nθ = arctan(50 / 300)\nθ ≈ 9.46°\n\nSo, the angle between the plane's velocity and the resultant velocity with respect to the ground is approximately 9.46°."
