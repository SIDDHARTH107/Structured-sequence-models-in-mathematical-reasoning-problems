    "message_2": "To determine the minimal value of $k$ for which the vector bundle $E$ is trivial, we need to consider the topological properties of the sphere $S^n$. In particular, we will use the fact that the sphere has a nontrivial fundamental group for $n = 1$ and trivial fundamental groups for $n > 1$.\n\nFor $n = 1$, the sphere $S^1$ is a circle, and its fundamental group is $\\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, there exist nontrivial line bundles (i.e., bundles with rank $k=1$) over $S^1$, such as the Möbius strip. Therefore, the minimal value of $k$ for which the vector bundle $E$ is trivial is $k = 2$. This is because the Whitney sum of two Möbius strips gives a trivial bundle, which can be seen as the product bundle $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nFor $n > 1$, the sphere $S^n$ has a trivial fundamental group, which implies that all vector bundles over $S^n$ are trivial. In this case, the minimal value of $k$ for which the vector bundle $E$ is trivial is $k = 1$. This is because any line bundle (i.e., a bundle with rank $k=1$) over $S^n$ is already trivial and isomorphic to the product bundle $S^n \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIn summary, the minimal value of $k$ for which the vector bundle $E$ is trivial depends on the dimension $n$ of the sphere $S^n$. For $n = 1$, the minimal value is $k = 2$, and for $n > 1$, the minimal value is $k = 1$."
