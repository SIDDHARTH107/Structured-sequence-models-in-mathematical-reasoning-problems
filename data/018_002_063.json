The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {2} (since 2 is the only element that is common to both A and B)\n\nNow, let's check if A ∩ B is a subset of A and B respectively. By definition, a set C is a subset of a set D (denoted as C ⊆ D) if every element of C is also an element of D.\n\n1. Checking if A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nSince A ∩ B = {2} and A = {2, 4, 6, 8}, we can see that the only element in A ∩ B (which is 2) is also an element of A. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of A (A ∩ B ⊆ A).\n\n2. Checking if A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nSimilarly, since A ∩ B = {2} and B = {2, 3, 5, 7}, we can see that the only element in A ∩ B (which is 2) is also an element of B. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of B (A ∩ B ⊆ B).\n\nIn conclusion, A ∩ B is a subset of both A and B."
