    "message_2": "To find the homology group H_1(X x S^2), we will use the Künneth formula. The Künneth formula states that for topological spaces X and Y, and for any non-negative integer k, the homology group H_k(X x Y) is given by the direct sum of the tensor product and the Tor functor applied to the homology groups of X and Y:\n\nH_k(X x Y) = ⊕ (H_i(X) ⊗ H_{k-i}(Y)) ⊕ Tor(H_i(X), H_{k-i-1}(Y))\n\nIn our case, X has homology groups H_1(X) = Z and H_2(X) = 0, and S^2 has homology groups H_0(S^2) = Z, H_2(S^2) = Z, and H_i(S^2) = 0 for i ≠ 0, 2. We want to find H_1(X x S^2), so we will set k = 1 in the Künneth formula:\n\nH_1(X x S^2) = ⊕ (H_i(X) ⊗ H_{1-i}(S^2)) ⊕ Tor(H_i(X), H_{1-i-1}(S^2))\n\nNow, we will compute the direct sum by considering the possible values of i:\n\nFor i = 0:\nH_0(X) ⊗ H_1(S^2) = Z ⊗ 0 = 0\nTor(H_0(X), H_0(S^2)) = Tor(Z, Z) = 0\n\nFor i = 1:\nH_1(X) ⊗ H_0(S^2) = Z ⊗ Z = Z\nTor(H_1(X), H_{-1}(S^2)) = Tor(Z, 0) = 0\n\nFor i > 1, both H_i(X) and H_{1-i}(S^2) are zero, so their tensor product and Tor functor will also be zero.\n\nTherefore, the direct sum has only one non-zero term:\n\nH_1(X x S^2) = Z\n\nSo, the first homology group of the product space X x S^2 is isomorphic to Z."
