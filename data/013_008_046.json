    "message_1": "Suppose there are 4 players in a Public Goods Game, each with an initial endowment of $10. The players can choose to either contribute $2 to a common pot or keep the money for themselves. The total amount in the common pot is then multiplied by a factor of 1.8 and divided equally among all players, including those who did not contribute. If all players contribute equally, what will be their final payout?",
    "message_2": "If all players contribute equally, each player will contribute $2 to the common pot. Since there are 4 players, the total amount in the common pot will be 4 * $2 = $8. \n\nThe total amount in the common pot is then multiplied by a factor of 1.8: $8 * 1.8 = $14.4.\n\nThis amount is then divided equally among all 4 players: $14.4 / 4 = $3.6.\n\nSince each player contributed $2 to the common pot and received $3.6 from the pot, their final payout will be their initial endowment of $10 minus their $2 contribution plus the $3.6 they received from the pot: $10 - $2 + $3.6 = $11.6.\n\nSo, if all players contribute equally, their final payout will be $11.6 each."
