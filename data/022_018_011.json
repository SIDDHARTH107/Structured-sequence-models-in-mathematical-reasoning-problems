    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) with the given boundary conditions, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y:\n\n$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$\n\nNow, substitute this into the PDE:\n\n$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$\n\nNext, we'll separate the variables by dividing both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2 - \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1) $X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0$\n2) $Y''(y) - k^2Y(y) = 0$\n\nLet's solve the ODEs subject to the boundary conditions.\n\nFor the X equation, we have the boundary conditions $u(1, y) = 0$. So, $X(1)Y(y) = 0$. Since $Y(y)$ is nonzero, we have $X(1) = 0$. The general solution of the X equation is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $X(1) = 0$, we get:\n\n$A\\cos(k) + B\\sin(k) = 0$\n\nSince this must hold for all values of k, we have $B\\sin(k) = -A\\cos(k)$. Thus, the X equation becomes:\n\n$X(x) = A(\\cos(kx) - \\sin(kx))$\n\nFor the Y equation, we have the boundary conditions $u(x, 0) = u(x, 1) = 0$. So, $X(x)Y(0) = X(x)Y(1) = 0$. Since $X(x)$ is nonzero, we have $Y(0) = Y(1) = 0$. The general solution of the Y equation is:\n\n$Y(y) = C\\cosh(ky) + D\\sinh(ky)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $Y(0) = Y(1) = 0$, we get:\n\n$C\\cosh(0) + D\\sinh(0) = 0 \\Rightarrow C = 0$\n$C\\cosh(k) + D\\sinh(k) = 0 \\Rightarrow D\\sinh(k) = 0$\n\nSince $\\sinh(k) \\neq 0$, we have $D = 0$. Thus, the Y equation becomes:\n\n$Y(y) = \\sinh(ky)$\n\nNow, we can write the solution of the PDE as:\n\n$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y) = A(\\cos(kx) - \\sin(kx))\\sinh(ky)$\n\nTo satisfy the boundary condition $u(0, y) = \\sin(\\pi y)$, we can use a Fourier sine series:\n\n$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n(\\cos(n\\pi x) - \\sin(n\\pi x))\\sinh(n\\pi y)$\n\nComparing the boundary condition with the series, we have:\n\n$\\sin(\\pi y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sinh(n\\pi y)$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, we can use the orthogonality property of the sine function:\n\n$A_n = 2\\int_0^1 \\sin(\\pi y)\\sin(n\\pi y) dy$\n\nSolving the integral, we get:\n\n$A_n = \\frac{2(1 - (-1)^n)}{n\\pi}$\n\nFinally, the solution of the PDE subject to the given boundary conditions is:\n\n$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2(1 - (-1)^n)}{n\\pi}(\\cos(n\\pi x) - \\sin(n\\pi x))\\sinh(n\\pi y)$"
