    "message_2": "To find the scalar curvature of a 2-dimensional sphere, we can use the formula:\n\nScalar curvature (K) = 2/R^2\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the radius (R) is given as 3 units. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nK = 2/(3^2)\nK = 2/9\n\nTherefore, the scalar curvature of the sphere at any point on the surface is 2/9."
