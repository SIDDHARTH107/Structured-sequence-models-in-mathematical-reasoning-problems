    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 12 cm. What is the surface area of the cone? (Round your answer to two decimal places)",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (circle) and the lateral surface area (the curved part of the cone). The formula for the surface area of a cone is:\n\nSurface Area = πr² + πr * l\n\nwhere r is the radius, and l is the slant height of the cone.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (l) using the Pythagorean theorem, since we have a right triangle formed by the height (h), radius (r), and slant height (l):\n\nl² = r² + h²\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 12 cm:\n\nl² = (5 cm)² + (12 cm)²\nl² = 25 cm² + 144 cm²\nl² = 169 cm²\nl = √169 cm²\nl = 13 cm\n\nNow we can find the surface area:\n\nSurface Area = π(5 cm)² + π(5 cm)(13 cm)\nSurface Area = 25π cm² + 65π cm²\nSurface Area = 90π cm²\n\nTo round the answer to two decimal places, we can approximate π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 90 * 3.14 cm²\nSurface Area ≈ 282.6 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 282.6 cm²."
