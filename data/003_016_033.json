    "message_1": "A possible question related to finding the phase shift of a trigonometric function could be:\n\nGiven the equation y = 2 sin(3x - π/4), find the phase shift in radians and degrees.\n\nTo solve this question, the student would need to recognize that the general form of a sinusoidal function is y = a sin(bx - c) + d, where a is the amplitude, b is the frequency, c is the phase shift, and d is the vertical shift. By comparing the given equation to this form, they would find that a = 2, b = 3, c = π/12, and d = 0. Then, they would determine that the phase shift is equal to c/b, which in this case is π/12 / 3 = π/36 radians or 5 degrees and 28.6 minutes (rounded to one decimal place).",
    "message_2": "I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. Here is the correct solution:\n\nGiven the equation y = 2 sin(3x - π/4), we need to find the phase shift in radians and degrees.\n\nThe general form of a sinusoidal function is y = a sin(bx - c) + d, where a is the amplitude, b is the frequency, c is the phase shift, and d is the vertical shift. By comparing the given equation to this form, we find that a = 2, b = 3, c = π/4, and d = 0.\n\nTo find the phase shift, we need to determine the value of c/b. In this case, the phase shift is equal to (π/4) / 3 = π/12 radians.\n\nTo convert the phase shift from radians to degrees, we can use the conversion factor 180°/π:\n\n(π/12) * (180°/π) = 15°\n\nSo, the phase shift is π/12 radians or 15 degrees."
