    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of a smooth function f along a vector field X, we need to apply the vector field X to the function f. In this case, the vector field X is given by (x+y, y). \n\nRecall that applying a vector field to a function is the same as taking the directional derivative of the function in the direction of the vector field. So, we have:\n\nL_X f = X(f) = (x+y) ∂f/∂x + y ∂f/∂y\n\nHere, ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y are the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y, respectively."
