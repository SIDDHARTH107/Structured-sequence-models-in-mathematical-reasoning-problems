The forcing function is:\n\nf(t) = 5sin(10t)\n\nThe displacement x(t) of the mass is governed by the system's Poincaré map. If the initial conditions at t = 0 are x(0) = 0 and dx/dt(0) = 0.5 m/s, what is the value of x(1) in meters?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the particular solution x_p(t) and the homogeneous solution x_h(t) of the given differential equation. Then, we can find the general solution x(t) by adding x_p(t) and x_h(t). Finally, we can use the initial conditions to find the constants in the general solution and evaluate x(1).\n\n1. Find the particular solution x_p(t):\n\nSince the forcing function is f(t) = 5sin(10t), we can assume a particular solution of the form x_p(t) = A*sin(10t) + B*cos(10t). Taking the first and second derivatives:\n\ndx_p/dt = 10A*cos(10t) - 10B*sin(10t)\nd^2x_p/dt^2 = -100A*sin(10t) - 100B*cos(10t)\n\nSubstitute x_p(t), dx_p/dt, and d^2x_p/dt^2 into the given differential equation:\n\n-100A*sin(10t) - 100B*cos(10t) + 10A*cos(10t) - 10B*sin(10t) + 10(A*sin(10t) + B*cos(10t)) = 5sin(10t)\n\nComparing the coefficients of sin(10t) and cos(10t):\n\n-100A - 10B + 10A = 5  => -90A - 10B = 5\n10A - 100B + 10B = 0  => 10A - 90B = 0\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get A = 1/9 and B = 1/9. So, the particular solution is:\n\nx_p(t) = (1/9)*sin(10t) + (1/9)*cos(10t)\n\n2. Find the homogeneous solution x_h(t):\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n\nd^2x_h/dt^2 + dx_h/dt + 10x_h = 0\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. We can assume a solution of the form x_h(t) = e^(rt) and substitute it into the homogeneous equation to get the characteristic equation:\n\nr^2 + r + 10 = 0\n\nThis equation has complex roots r = -1/2 ± i*(3√39)/2. So, the homogeneous solution is:\n\nx_h(t) = e^(-t/2) * (C1*cos((3√39/2)*t) + C2*sin((3√39/2)*t))\n\n3. Find the general solution x(t):\n\nx(t) = x_p(t) + x_h(t)\nx(t) = (1/9)*sin(10t) + (1/9)*cos(10t) + e^(-t/2) * (C1*cos((3√39/2)*t) + C2*sin((3√39/2)*t))\n\n4. Use the initial conditions to find C1 and C2:\n\nx(0) = 0 => (1/9) + C1 = 0 => C1 = -1/9\ndx/dt(0) = 0.5 => 10*(1/9) + (3√39/2)*C2 = 0.5 => C2 = -1/(3√39)\n\n5. Evaluate x(1):\n\nx(1) = (1/9)*sin(10) + (1/9)*cos(10) + e^(-1/2) * ((-1/9)*cos((3√39/2)) - (1/(3√39))*sin((3√39/2)))\n\nx(1) ≈ -0.099 meters"
