    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first five perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, 8128, and 33,550,336.\n\nThe sixth perfect number can be found using the formula for even perfect numbers, which is given by (2^(p-1)) * (2^p - 1), where p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers. This formula is derived from the work of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid and later extended by the Swiss mathematician Euler.\n\nTo find the sixth perfect number, we need to find the next prime number p for which 2^p - 1 is also prime. The first five such prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 13, which correspond to the first five perfect numbers. The next prime number that satisfies this condition is 17.\n\nSo, the sixth perfect number is (2^(17-1)) * (2^17 - 1) = 131,072 * 131,071 = 8,589,869,056."
