    "message_1": "A rectangular box of length 10 cm, width 6 cm, and height 4 cm needs to be designed with the constraint that the volume of the box cannot exceed 240 cubic cm. The material to make the box costs $0.50 per square centimeter for the top, bottom, and sides, and $1.00 per square centimeter for the front and back. Find the dimensions of the box that minimize the total cost of the material.",
    "message_2": "Let the length, width, and height of the box be L, W, and H, respectively. The volume constraint is given by:\n\nL * W * H ≤ 240\n\nThe cost of the material for the box is given by:\n\nCost = 0.5 * (2 * L * W + 2 * L * H) + 1 * (2 * W * H)\n\nWe want to minimize the cost while satisfying the volume constraint. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's introduce a Lagrange multiplier λ and form the Lagrangian function:\n\nLagrangian = 0.5 * (2 * L * W + 2 * L * H) + 1 * (2 * W * H) + λ * (L * W * H - 240)\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian function with respect to L, W, H, and λ and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂Lagrangian/∂L = W + H + λ * W * H = 0\n∂Lagrangian/∂W = L + 2 * H + λ * L * H = 0\n∂Lagrangian/∂H = L + 2 * W + λ * L * W = 0\n∂Lagrangian/∂λ = L * W * H - 240 = 0\n\nWe have a system of four equations with four unknowns (L, W, H, and λ). Solving this system, we get:\n\nL = 10, W = 6, H = 4, λ = -1/40\n\nThese dimensions satisfy the volume constraint (10 * 6 * 4 = 240) and minimize the total cost of the material. The minimum cost is:\n\nCost = 0.5 * (2 * 10 * 6 + 2 * 10 * 4) + 1 * (2 * 6 * 4) = 60 + 40 + 48 = $148"
