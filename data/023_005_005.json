    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to recall the definition of the Fourier transform and its properties.\n\nThe Fourier transform of a function f(x) is defined as:\n\n$$ F(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i k x} dx $$\n\nAnd the inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\n$$ f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(k) e^{2\\pi i k x} dk $$\n\nNow, let's consider the given differential equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 4y = 0 $$\n\nWe will apply the Fourier transform to both sides of the equation. Let Y(k) be the Fourier transform of y(x), i.e., Y(k) = F{y(x)}. Then, using the property of the Fourier transform for the second derivative, we have:\n\n$$ F\\left\\{\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\\right\\} = (2\\pi i k)^2 Y(k) $$\n\nSo, the transformed equation becomes:\n\n$$ (2\\pi i k)^2 Y(k) + 4Y(k) = 0 $$\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(k):\n\n$$ Y(k) [(2\\pi i k)^2 + 4] = 0 $$\n\nSince Y(k) is not identically zero, we have:\n\n$$ (2\\pi i k)^2 + 4 = 0 $$\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\n$$ k = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\pi} i $$\n\nNow, we can use the inverse Fourier transform to find the general solution y(x):\n\n$$ y(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} Y(k) e^{2\\pi i k x} dk $$\n\nSince we have two values for k, we can write the general solution as a linear combination of the inverse Fourier transforms corresponding to each value of k:\n\n$$ y(x) = A e^{2\\pi i (\\frac{1}{\\pi} i) x} + B e^{2\\pi i (-\\frac{1}{\\pi} i) x} $$\n\nSimplifying the exponents, we get:\n\n$$ y(x) = A e^{-2x} + B e^{2x} $$\n\nSo, the general solution to the given differential equation is:\n\n$$ y(x) = A e^{-2x} + B e^{2x} $$\n\nwhere A and B are arbitrary constants."
