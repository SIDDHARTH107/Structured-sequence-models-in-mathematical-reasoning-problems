    "message_2": "The given proposition can be written in modal logic as: □(P(x) → Q). To find the negation of this proposition, we negate the entire statement:\n\n¬□(P(x) → Q)\n\nBy applying the rule that ¬□A is equivalent to ◊¬A, we get:\n\n◊¬(P(x) → Q)\n\nNow, we can apply De Morgan's law to the implication inside the diamond (◊):\n\n◊(P(x) ∧ ¬Q)\n\nSo, the negation of the given proposition is: \"It is possible that x is a prime number and 2+2 is not equal to 4.\""
