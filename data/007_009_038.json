    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, denoted as $\\phi(n)$, counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. In other words, it counts the number of integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq n$ and $\\gcd(n, k) = 1$.\n\nTo find $\\phi(10)$, we need to count the number of positive integers less than or equal to $10$ that are relatively prime to $10$. Since $10 = 2 \\times 5$, the numbers that are relatively prime to $10$ are those that are not divisible by $2$ or $5$. \n\nThe numbers from $1$ to $10$ are: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10$. \n\nRemoving the numbers divisible by $2$ or $5$, we are left with: $1, 3, 7, 9$. \n\nThere are $4$ numbers in this list, so $\\phi(10) = 4$."
