Compute the totient function φ(n): φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\n3. Compute the modular multiplicative inverse of the public key exponent e (13 in this case) modulo φ(n).\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. n = 13 * 17 = 221 (which is already given in the public key)\n2. φ(n) = (13 - 1) * (17 - 1) = 12 * 16 = 192\n3. Now we need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of e (13) modulo φ(n) (192). This can be done using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n\nWe want to find d such that:\n\ne * d ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n\n13 * d ≡ 1 (mod 192)\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 61. So, the private key is (61, 221)."
