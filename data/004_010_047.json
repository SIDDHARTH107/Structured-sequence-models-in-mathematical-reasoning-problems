    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 5x^4 + 3x^2 - 2x + 7, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor the given function, we have:\n\nAntiderivative of 5x^4: (5x^(4+1))/(4+1) = (5x^5)/5 = x^5\nAntiderivative of 3x^2: (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3\nAntiderivative of -2x: (-2x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (-2x^2)/2 = -x^2\nAntiderivative of 7: 7x (since the antiderivative of a constant is the constant times x)\n\nNow, we combine all the antiderivatives and add the constant of integration C:\n\nF(x) = x^5 + x^3 - x^2 + 7x + C"
