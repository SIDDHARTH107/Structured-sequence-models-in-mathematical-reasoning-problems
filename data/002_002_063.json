    "message_2": "The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π is approximately 3.14159.\n\nFor a sphere with a radius of 5 cm:\n\nV = (4/3) * 3.14159 * (5³)\nV = (4/3) * 3.14159 * 125\nV = 1.33333 * 3.14159 * 125\nV ≈ 523.598 cm³\n\nThe volume of the sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 523.598 cubic centimeters."
