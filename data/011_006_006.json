    "message_2": "To find the generating function for the number of ways to roll a 6-sided dice to obtain a sum of 10 or less, we first need to find the generating function for a single roll of the dice. The generating function for a single roll of a 6-sided dice is given by:\n\nG(x) = x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6\n\nThis is because there is one way to roll each of the numbers 1 through 6.\n\nNow, since we want to find the generating function for the number of ways to obtain a sum of 10 or less, we need to consider the generating function for rolling the dice multiple times. Let's say we roll the dice n times. The generating function for rolling the dice n times is given by:\n\nG_n(x) = (x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)^n\n\nTo find the generating function for the number of ways to obtain a sum of 10 or less, we need to find the coefficient of x^k in G_n(x) for k = 1, 2, ..., 10. This can be done using the multinomial theorem, which states that:\n\n(x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)^n = Î£ (n! / (a_1! a_2! ... a_6!)) x^(a_1 + 2a_2 + 3a_3 + 4a_4 + 5a_5 + 6a_6)\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all non-negative integer solutions (a_1, a_2, ..., a_6) to the equation:\n\na_1 + 2a_2 + 3a_3 + 4a_4 + 5a_5 + 6a_6 = k\n\nFor k = 1, 2, ..., 10, we can find the coefficient of x^k in G_n(x) by finding all non-negative integer solutions to the above equation for each value of k and summing the multinomial coefficients.\n\nHowever, since we are interested in the generating function for the number of ways to obtain a sum of 10 or less, we can simply find the generating function for the number of ways to obtain a sum of 10 and subtract it from the generating function for the number of ways to obtain a sum of 11 or more.\n\nThe generating function for the number of ways to obtain a sum of 10 is given by:\n\nG_10(x) = (x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)^10\n\nThe generating function for the number of ways to obtain a sum of 11 or more is given by:\n\nG_11+(x) = 1 - G_10(x)\n\nTherefore, the generating function for the number of ways to obtain a sum of 10 or less is given by:\n\nG_10-(x) = G_10(x) - G_11+(x) = G_10(x) - (1 - G_10(x)) = 2G_10(x) - 1\n\nSo, the generating function for the number of ways to roll a 6-sided dice to obtain a sum of 10 or less is:\n\nG_10-(x) = 2(x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)^10 - 1"
