    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 5, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives. The power rule states that the antiderivative of x^n, where n is a constant, is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor f(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 5, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the first term, 3x^2:\nThe antiderivative is (3/3)(x^(2+1))/(2+1) = x^3.\n\nFor the second term, -8x:\nThe antiderivative is (-8/2)(x^(1+1))/(1+1) = -4x^2.\n\nFor the third term, 5:\nSince 5 is a constant, its antiderivative is 5x.\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + C."
