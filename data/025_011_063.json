    "message_1": "Let $E$ be an elliptic curve given by the equation $y^2=x^3+ax+b$, where $a=1$ and $b=6$. The group law on $E$ can be defined geometrically using a line that intersects $E$ at three points. Let $P=(1,2)$ and $Q=(4,8)$. Find the coordinates of the point $R=P+Q$.",
    "message_2": "To find the coordinates of the point $R = P + Q$, we need to find the third point of intersection of the line passing through $P$ and $Q$ with the elliptic curve $E$. Then, we will reflect this point across the x-axis to obtain the point $R$.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope of the line passing through $P$ and $Q$. We have:\n\n$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{8 - 2}{4 - 1} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2$\n\nNow, let's find the equation of the line passing through $P$ and $Q$. We have:\n\n$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$\n\n$y - 2 = 2(x - 1)$\n\n$y = 2x$\n\nNow, let's find the third point of intersection of this line with the elliptic curve $E$. We will substitute the equation of the line into the equation of the curve:\n\n$(2x)^2 = x^3 + x + 6$\n\n$4x^2 = x^3 + x + 6$\n\n$x^3 - 4x^2 + x + 6 = 0$\n\nWe know that $x = 1$ and $x = 4$ are roots of this polynomial (corresponding to the points $P$ and $Q$), so we can factor the polynomial as follows:\n\n$(x - 1)(x - 4)(x - r) = 0$\n\nwhere $r$ is the x-coordinate of the third point of intersection. Expanding the left-hand side, we get:\n\n$x^3 - (1 + 4 + r)x^2 + (1 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot r + 4 \\cdot r)x - 1 \\cdot 4 \\cdot r = 0$\n\nComparing the coefficients, we have:\n\n$- (1 + 4 + r) = -4$\n\n$r = -1$\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the third point of intersection by substituting $x = -1$ into the equation of the line:\n\n$y = 2(-1) = -2$\n\nSo, the third point of intersection is $(-1, -2)$. Reflecting this point across the x-axis, we obtain the point $R = (-1, 2)$. Therefore, the coordinates of the point $R = P + Q$ are $(-1, 2)$."
