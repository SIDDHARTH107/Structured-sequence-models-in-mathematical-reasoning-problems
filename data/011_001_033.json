    "message_2": "To determine the number of different lineups the coach can make with 5 players on the court at a time, we can use the combination formula. The combination formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of players (10 in this case), k is the number of players on the court (5 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) × (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 30240 / 120\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo, the coach can make 252 different lineups with 5 players on the court at a time."
