    "message_1": "Consider a commutative ring $R$ and its polynomial ring $R[x_i]$ in $n$ variables $x_1, \\dots, x_n.$ Let $I$ be an ideal of $R[x_i].$ \n\nSuppose $R = \\mathbb{C}$ and $I = (x_1 - 2)(x_2 - 3)(x_3 - 4) + (x_1 - 2)(x_2 - 5)(x_3 - 6),$ find the number of points in the affine space $\\mathbb{A}^3(\\mathbb{C})$ that the ideal $I$ vanishes at.",
    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the ideal $I$ as a sum of its generators:\n\n$I = (x_1 - 2)(x_2 - 3)(x_3 - 4) + (x_1 - 2)(x_2 - 5)(x_3 - 6)$\n\nNow, let's factor out the common term $(x_1 - 2)$:\n\n$I = (x_1 - 2)[(x_2 - 3)(x_3 - 4) + (x_2 - 5)(x_3 - 6)]$\n\nNow, let's expand the terms inside the brackets:\n\n$I = (x_1 - 2)[x_2x_3 - 4x_2 - 3x_3 + 12 + x_2x_3 - 6x_2 - 5x_3 + 30]$\n\n$I = (x_1 - 2)[2x_2x_3 - 10x_2 - 8x_3 + 42]$\n\nNow, we want to find the points in $\\mathbb{A}^3(\\mathbb{C})$ where the ideal $I$ vanishes. This means we want to find the points $(x_1, x_2, x_3) \\in \\mathbb{A}^3(\\mathbb{C})$ such that:\n\n$(x_1 - 2)(2x_2x_3 - 10x_2 - 8x_3 + 42) = 0$\n\nThis equation is satisfied if either $(x_1 - 2) = 0$ or $(2x_2x_3 - 10x_2 - 8x_3 + 42) = 0$.\n\nFor the first case, $(x_1 - 2) = 0$, we have $x_1 = 2$. Since $x_2$ and $x_3$ can be any complex number, there are infinitely many points in $\\mathbb{A}^3(\\mathbb{C})$ that satisfy this condition.\n\nFor the second case, $(2x_2x_3 - 10x_2 - 8x_3 + 42) = 0$, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\n$2x_2x_3 - 10x_2 - 8x_3 + 42 = 2(x_2 - 4)(x_3 - 3) - 6(x_2 - 4) - 4(x_3 - 3) = 0$\n\nNow, let's factor out the common terms:\n\n$2(x_2 - 4)(x_3 - 3) - 6(x_2 - 4) - 4(x_3 - 3) = 2(x_2 - 4)(x_3 - 3) - 2(x_2 - 4)(3) - 2(x_3 - 3)(2)$\n\n$= 2(x_2 - 4)((x_3 - 3) - 3) - 2(x_3 - 3)((x_2 - 4) - 2)$\n\n$= 2(x_2 - 4)(x_3 - 6) - 2(x_3 - 3)(x_2 - 6)$\n\nNow, we have two possibilities:\n\n1. $x_2 - 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow x_2 = 4$. In this case, $x_1$ and $x_3$ can be any complex number, so there are infinitely many points in $\\mathbb{A}^3(\\mathbb{C})$ that satisfy this condition.\n\n2. $x_3 - 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow x_3 = 6$. In this case, $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be any complex number, so there are infinitely many points in $\\mathbb{A}^3(\\mathbb{C})$ that satisfy this condition.\n\nSince there are infinitely many points in $\\mathbb{A}^3(\\mathbb{C})$ that satisfy either $(x_1 - 2) = 0$, $(x_2 - 4) = 0$, or $(x_3 - 6) = 0$, there are infinitely many points in $\\mathbb{A}^3(\\mathbb{C})$ where the ideal $I$ vanishes."
