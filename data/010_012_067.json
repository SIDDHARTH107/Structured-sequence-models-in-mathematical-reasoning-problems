    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = e^{(x+1)(y-2)}$, we need to find the first partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$, and then set them equal to zero.\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = (y-2)e^{(x+1)(y-2)}$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = (x+1)e^{(x+1)(y-2)}$\n\nNow, let's set these partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$(y-2)e^{(x+1)(y-2)} = 0$\n\n$(x+1)e^{(x+1)(y-2)} = 0$\n\nSince $e^{(x+1)(y-2)}$ is never equal to zero, we can divide both equations by it:\n\n$y-2 = 0$\n\n$x+1 = 0$\n\nSolving these equations, we get the critical point $(x, y) = (-1, 2)$.\n\nNow, let's find the second partial derivatives to determine the nature of this critical point:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = (y-2)^2e^{(x+1)(y-2)}$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = (x+1)^2e^{(x+1)(y-2)}$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = (x+1)(y-2)e^{(x+1)(y-2)}$\n\nNow, let's evaluate these second partial derivatives at the critical point $(-1, 2)$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}(-1, 2) = (2-2)^2e^{(-1+1)(2-2)} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}(-1, 2) = (-1+1)^2e^{(-1+1)(2-2)} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y}(-1, 2) = (-1+1)(2-2)e^{(-1+1)(2-2)} = 0$\n\nSince all the second partial derivatives are zero at the critical point, we cannot use the second derivative test to determine the nature of the critical point. However, we can analyze the function around the critical point to determine its nature.\n\nNotice that the function $f(x, y) = e^{(x+1)(y-2)}$ is always positive, since the exponential function is always positive. This means that there is no local maximum or minimum at the critical point, as the function value can always be increased or decreased by moving away from the critical point in the appropriate direction. Therefore, the critical point $(x, y) = (-1, 2)$ is a saddle point."
