    "message_2": "To find the rank of matrix A, we need to find the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by performing Gaussian elimination to obtain the row echelon form of the matrix.\n\nMatrix A:\n[[3, 6, 7],\n [1, -2, 4],\n [2, 4, 4]]\n\nStep 1: Subtract (1/3) * Row 1 from Row 2 and (2/3) * Row 1 from Row 3 to eliminate the first element in Row 2 and Row 3.\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - (1/3) * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - (2/3) * Row 1\n\nMatrix A:\n[[3, 6, 7],\n [0, -4, 2.333],\n [0, -0, -1.333]]\n\nStep 2: Divide Row 2 by -4 to make the leading element in Row 2 equal to 1.\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 / -4\n\nMatrix A:\n[[3, 6, 7],\n [0, 1, -0.583],\n [0, -0, -1.333]]\n\nStep 3: Add (6) * Row 2 to Row 1 and (0) * Row 2 to Row 3 to eliminate the second element in Row 1 and Row 3.\n\nRow 1 = Row 1 - 6 * Row 2\nRow 3 = Row 3 + 0 * Row 2\n\nMatrix A:\n[[3, 0, 10.5],\n [0, 1, -0.583],\n [0, 0, -1.333]]\n\nNow, the matrix is in row echelon form. We can see that there are three non-zero rows, which means there are three linearly independent rows. Therefore, the rank of matrix A is 3."
