    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B, and wants to maximize its profits. The profit per unit of A is $8 and the profit per unit of B is $10. The production of product A requires 3 units of resource X and 2 units of resource Y, while the production of product B requires 2 units of resource X and 4 units of resource Y. The company has at most 240 units of resource X and 180 units of resource Y available for production. What is the optimal production plan for the company that maximizes its total profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production plan, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 8x + 10y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 240 (resource X constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 180 (resource Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 240 => y ≤ (240 - 3x) / 2\n2x + 4y ≤ 180 => y ≤ (180 - 2x) / 4\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect:\n\n(0, 0) - origin\n(0, 45) - intersection of y-axis and resource Y constraint\n(40, 30) - intersection of resource X and resource Y constraints\n(80, 0) - intersection of x-axis and resource X constraint\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\nP(0, 0) = 8(0) + 10(0) = $0\nP(0, 45) = 8(0) + 10(45) = $450\nP(40, 30) = 8(40) + 10(30) = $620\nP(80, 0) = 8(80) + 10(0) = $640\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (80, 0), with a profit of $640. Therefore, the optimal production plan is to produce 80 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
