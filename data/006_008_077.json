    "message_2": "The probability of the city not having rain on a given day is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n\nSince we want to find the probability of the city not having rain on two consecutive days, we can multiply the probabilities of not having rain on each day.\n\nProbability (no rain on two consecutive days) = Probability (no rain on day 1) * Probability (no rain on day 2)\n\n= 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49\n\nSo, the probability of the city not having rain on the next two consecutive days is 0.49 or 49%."
