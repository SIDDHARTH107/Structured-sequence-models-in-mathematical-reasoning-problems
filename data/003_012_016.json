    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on the ground. If the angle of elevation to the top of the pole from a point on the ground is 60° and the distance from the point to the base of the pole is 20 meters, what is the height of the flagpole in meters?",
    "message_2": "We can use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (height of the flagpole) and the adjacent side (distance from the point to the base of the pole) in a right triangle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 60° and the distance from the point to the base of the pole is 20 meters. Let h be the height of the flagpole. We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(60°) = h / 20\n\nThe tangent of 60° is equal to the square root of 3:\n\n√3 = h / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for h by multiplying both sides of the equation by 20:\n\nh = 20 * √3\n\nh ≈ 20 * 1.732\n\nh ≈ 34.64\n\nThe height of the flagpole is approximately 34.64 meters."
