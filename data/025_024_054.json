    "message_2": "First, we need to find the midpoint of AB. The midpoint formula is given by:\n\nMidpoint M = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n\nFor points A(2, 3) and B(5, 1), we have:\n\nM = ((2 + 5)/2, (3 + 1)/2) = (7/2, 4/2) = (3.5, 2)\n\nNow, we have the midpoint M(3.5, 2) and the point (7, 5). We can find the slope of the line passing through these two points using the slope formula:\n\nSlope m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nFor points M(3.5, 2) and (7, 5), we have:\n\nm = (5 - 2) / (7 - 3.5) = 3 / 3.5 = 6/7\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nUsing the point (7, 5) and the slope 6/7:\n\ny - 5 = (6/7)(x - 7)\n\nNow, we can distribute the slope and simplify the equation:\n\ny - 5 = (6/7)x - 6\n\nTo get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 7:\n\n7(y - 5) = 7((6/7)x - 6)\n\n7y - 35 = 6x - 42\n\nRearrange the equation to the standard form:\n\n6x - 7y = -7\n\nThis is the equation of the line passing through the midpoint of AB and the point (7, 5)."
