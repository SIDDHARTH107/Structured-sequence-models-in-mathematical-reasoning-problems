Then, use proof techniques such as natural deduction to derive a contradiction, showing that $q$ cannot be true.",
    "message_2": "We will use proof by contradiction. Let's assume that $q$ is true.\n\n1. $(p \\rightarrow q)$ (Given)\n2. $(q \\rightarrow \\neg p)$ (Given)\n3. $q$ (Assumption)\n\nNow, since we assumed $q$ is true, we can use Modus Ponens on statement 2:\n\n4. $\\neg p$ (From 2 and 3, Modus Ponens)\n\nNow, we have $\\neg p$ and $(p \\rightarrow q)$. We can use the contrapositive of statement 1, which is:\n\n5. $(\\neg q \\rightarrow \\neg p)$ (Contrapositive of 1)\n\nSince we have $\\neg p$ from statement 4, we can use Modus Ponens on statement 5:\n\n6. $\\neg q$ (From 4 and 5, Modus Ponens)\n\nNow, we have a contradiction: we assumed $q$ is true (statement 3), but we derived that $\\neg q$ is true (statement 6). Therefore, our assumption that $q$ is true must be false, and $q$ must be false."
