    "message_2": "To find the area between the two curves, we need to first find the points of intersection between the curves. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 - 1 = -x^2 + 5\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2x^2 = 6\nx^2 = 3\nx = ±√3\n\nSince we are only interested in the interval between x = 1 and x = 2, we will only consider the positive value of x, which is x = √3.\n\nNow, we will find the corresponding y-values for each curve at x = √3:\n\ny1 = (√3)^2 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\ny2 = -(√3)^2 + 5 = -3 + 5 = 2\n\nSince the y-values are the same, the two curves intersect at the point (√3, 2).\n\nNow, we need to find the area between the curves. We can do this by integrating the difference of the two functions over the interval [1, 2]:\n\nArea = ∫[(-x^2 + 5) - (x^2 - 1)] dx from 1 to 2\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\nArea = ∫[-2x^2 + 6] dx from 1 to 2\n\nNow, integrate:\n\nArea = [-2(x^3)/3 + 6x] evaluated from 1 to 2\n\nPlug in the limits of integration:\n\nArea = ([-2(2^3)/3 + 6(2)] - [-2(1^3)/3 + 6(1)])\n\nArea = ([-16/3 + 12] - [-2/3 + 6])\n\nArea = [(20/3) - (16/3)]\n\nArea = 4/3 square units\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 - 1 and y = -x^2 + 5 between the values of x = 1 and x = 2 is 4/3 square units."
