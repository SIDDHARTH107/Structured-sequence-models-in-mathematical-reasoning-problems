    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the substitution method. First, we'll solve one of the equations for one variable, and then substitute that expression into the other equation.\n\nFrom the second equation, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 5 - y\n\nNow, we'll substitute this expression for x into the first equation:\n\n2(5 - y) - 3y = 8\n\nDistribute the 2:\n\n10 - 2y - 3y = 8\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n10 - 5y = 8\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n-5y = -2\n\nDivide by -5:\n\ny = 2/5\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the expression we found for x:\n\nx = 5 - y\nx = 5 - 2/5\n\nTo subtract, we need a common denominator, which is 5:\n\nx = 25/5 - 2/5\n\nSubtract:\n\nx = 23/5\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 23/5 and y = 2/5."
