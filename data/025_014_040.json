Here's an example problem:\n\nLet $\\mathrm{\\Theta}(z)$ be a Riemann theta function, defined by the series:\n\n$$\\mathrm{\\Theta}(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\pi i n^2 z}$$\n\nwhere $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is a complex number. Find the value of $\\mathrm{\\Theta}(\\frac{1}{2})$.\n",
    "message_2": "To find the value of $\\mathrm{\\Theta}(\\frac{1}{2})$, we will substitute $z = \\frac{1}{2}$ into the series definition:\n\n$$\\mathrm{\\Theta}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\pi i n^2 \\frac{1}{2}}$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the exponent:\n\n$$\\mathrm{\\Theta}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\frac{\\pi i n^2}{2}}$$\n\nNotice that the series is symmetric around $n = 0$. For every positive $n$, there is a corresponding negative $n$ such that their sum is zero. Therefore, we can rewrite the series as:\n\n$$\\mathrm{\\Theta}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 + 2\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} e^{\\frac{\\pi i n^2}{2}}$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the summand. For any integer $n$, $n^2$ is always even. Therefore, the exponent $\\frac{\\pi i n^2}{2}$ is always an integer multiple of $\\pi i$. This means that the summand is always a root of unity, i.e., a complex number with magnitude 1.\n\nThe sum converges because the terms oscillate and their magnitudes decrease as $n$ increases. However, finding an exact closed-form expression for the sum is challenging and may not be possible. The value of $\\mathrm{\\Theta}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ can be approximated numerically by summing a finite number of terms in the series."
