    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can factor the numerator:\n\n$\\dfrac{x^2 - 4}{x-2} = \\dfrac{(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2}$\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common factor $(x-2)$ from the numerator and the denominator:\n\n$\\dfrac{(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2} = x+2$\n\nSo, the simplified expression is $x+2$. However, we need to state the restrictions on the value of $x$. Since the original expression had a denominator of $(x-2)$, we must exclude the value of $x$ that makes the denominator equal to zero:\n\n$x-2 \\neq 0$\n\n$x \\neq 2$\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is $x+2$ with the restriction that $x \\neq 2$."
