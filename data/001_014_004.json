    "message_2": "To simplify the expression $\\sqrt{48}$, we can find the prime factorization of 48 and then look for pairs of the same factors. \n\nThe prime factorization of 48 is $2^4 \\cdot 3$. \n\nNow, we can group the factors into pairs: $(2^2) \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 3)$. \n\nTaking the square root of each pair, we get: \n\n$\\sqrt{48} = \\sqrt{2^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3} = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{12}$.\n\nSo, the simplified expression is $2\\sqrt{12}$."
