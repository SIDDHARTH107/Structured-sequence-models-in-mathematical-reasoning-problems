    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z^3)/(z^2+1), we first need to find the points where the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 0, and c = 1:\n\nz = (± √(-4)) / 2\n\nz = ± i\n\nSo, the singularities of f(z) are at z = i and z = -i.\n\nNow, we need to classify these singularities as poles or removable singularities. A singularity is a pole if the order of the zero in the denominator is greater than the order of the zero in the numerator at that point. A singularity is removable if the order of the zero in the denominator is equal to or less than the order of the zero in the numerator at that point.\n\nLet's consider the singularity at z = i:\n\nf(z) = (z^3) / (z^2 + 1)\n\nThe order of the zero in the denominator at z = i is 1, since (z - i) is a factor of (z^2 + 1) and (z - i)^2 is not a factor of (z^2 + 1).\n\nThe order of the zero in the numerator at z = i is 0, since (z - i) is not a factor of z^3.\n\nSince the order of the zero in the denominator is greater than the order of the zero in the numerator at z = i, the singularity at z = i is a pole.\n\nNow let's consider the singularity at z = -i:\n\nThe order of the zero in the denominator at z = -i is 1, for the same reasons as above.\n\nThe order of the zero in the numerator at z = -i is 0, since (z + i) is not a factor of z^3.\n\nSince the order of the zero in the denominator is greater than the order of the zero in the numerator at z = -i, the singularity at z = -i is also a pole.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(z) = (z^3)/(z^2+1) has two singularities, at z = i and z = -i, and both of them are poles."
