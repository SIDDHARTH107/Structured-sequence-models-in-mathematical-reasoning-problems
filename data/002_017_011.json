    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon with side length 8 cm, we can use the following formula:\n\nArea = (3 * √3 * s^2) / 2\n\nwhere s is the side length.\n\nPlugging in the given side length:\n\nArea = (3 * √3 * 8^2) / 2\nArea = (3 * √3 * 64) / 2\nArea = (192 * √3) / 2\nArea = 96 * √3\n\nThe area of the regular hexagon is 96√3 square centimeters."
