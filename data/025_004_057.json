    "message_2": "A rational curve can be parameterized by a map (x(t), y(t)) = (p(t)/q(t), r(t)/s(t)), where p(t), q(t), r(t), and s(t) are polynomials. The degree of a rational curve is the maximum of the degrees of p(t), q(t), r(t), and s(t).\n\nLet's consider the curve to be given by (x(t), y(t)) = (p(t)/q(t), r(t)/s(t)), where p(t), q(t), r(t), and s(t) are polynomials of degrees m, n, k, and l, respectively. Then, the degree of the curve is max(m, n, k, l).\n\nNow, let's consider the nine points in general position. Since the curve passes through these points, we can write the following equations:\n\nx(t_i) = p(t_i)/q(t_i) = x_i, for i = 1, 2, ..., 9\ny(t_i) = r(t_i)/s(t_i) = y_i, for i = 1, 2, ..., 9\n\nWe have 18 equations in total. To ensure that the curve passes through all nine points, we need to have enough degrees of freedom in the polynomials p(t), q(t), r(t), and s(t) to satisfy these equations.\n\nThe number of degrees of freedom is given by the total number of coefficients in the polynomials, which is (m+1) + (n+1) + (k+1) + (l+1) = m+n+k+l+4.\n\nTo satisfy the 18 equations, we need at least 18 degrees of freedom, i.e., m+n+k+l+4 â‰¥ 18.\n\nNow, we want to minimize the degree of the curve, which is max(m, n, k, l). We can achieve this by choosing m=n=k=l=3, which gives us a total of 16 degrees of freedom. However, this is not enough to satisfy the 18 equations.\n\nTo satisfy the 18 equations, we need to increase the degree of at least one of the polynomials. The smallest increase that will give us enough degrees of freedom is to set m=4 and keep n=k=l=3. This gives us a total of 20 degrees of freedom, which is enough to satisfy the 18 equations.\n\nTherefore, the degree of a rational curve that passes through nine points in general position is max(4, 3, 3, 3) = 4."
