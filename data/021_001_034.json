    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n| 2 -3  4 |  8 |\n| 1  5 -2 |  1 |\n| 4 -1  1 |  5 |\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1 -1.5  2 |  4 |\n| 1  5  -2 |  1 |\n| 4  -1  1 |  5 |\n\nStep 2: Subtract the first row from the second and fourth times the first row from the third to eliminate the leading coefficients in the second and third rows:\n\n| 1 -1.5  2 |  4 |\n| 0  6.5 -4 | -3 |\n| 0  5  -7 | -11 |\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 6.5 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1 -1.5  2  |  4  |\n| 0  1   -4/6.5 | -3/6.5 |\n| 0  5   -7  | -11 |\n\nStep 4: Add 1.5 times the second row to the first and subtract 5 times the second row from the third to eliminate the coefficients in the first and third rows:\n\n| 1  0  1.769 |  6.769 |\n| 0  1  -0.615 | -0.462 |\n| 0  0  -0.692 | -9.308 |\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by -0.692 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  0  1.769 |  6.769 |\n| 0  1  -0.615 | -0.462 |\n| 0  0   1     | 13.462 |\n\nStep 6: Subtract 1.769 times the third row from the first and add 0.615 times the third row to the second to eliminate the coefficients in the first and second rows:\n\n| 1  0  0 | -16.154 |\n| 0  1  0 |   7.692 |\n| 0  0  1 |  13.462 |\n\nThe row-echelon form of the augmented matrix corresponds to the following system of equations:\n\nx = -16.154\ny = 7.692\nz = 13.462\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -16.154, y = 7.692, and z = 13.462."
