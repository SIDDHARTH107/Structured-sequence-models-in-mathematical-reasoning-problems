    "message_1": "In a magic show, the magician has prepared 10 different tricks. The probability that the audience will see a card trick is 0.4, the probability that they will see a coin trick is 0.3, and the probability that they will see a disappearing trick is 0.2. What is the probability that the audience will see a trick which is not a card, coin, or disappearing trick?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the audience seeing a trick that is not a card, coin, or disappearing trick, we can add the probabilities of the three mentioned tricks and subtract the result from 1.\n\nThe probability of seeing a card, coin, or disappearing trick is 0.4 (card) + 0.3 (coin) + 0.2 (disappearing) = 0.9.\n\nNow, subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of seeing a trick that is not one of these three types:\n\n1 - 0.9 = 0.1\n\nSo, the probability that the audience will see a trick which is not a card, coin, or disappearing trick is 0.1 or 10%."
