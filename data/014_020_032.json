    "message_2": "A Vigenere cipher with a key length of 5 means that there are 5 characters in the key. Since each character can be any letter of the alphabet, and there are 26 letters in the alphabet, the number of possible keys can be calculated as follows:\n\n26 (possible choices for the first character) * 26 (possible choices for the second character) * 26 (possible choices for the third character) * 26 (possible choices for the fourth character) * 26 (possible choices for the fifth character)\n\nSo, the total number of possible keys is:\n\n26^5 = 11,881,376"
