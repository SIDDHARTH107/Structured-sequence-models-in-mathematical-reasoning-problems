    "message_1": "Here's a possible numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\n\"Suppose that the probability of a burglary occurring in a certain neighborhood is 0.05. If there are 500 houses in the neighborhood, what is the expected number of houses that will experience a burglary?\"\n\nThe solution to this problem involves using the formula for expected value, which is:\n\nExpected value = probability x number of trials\n\nIn this case, the probability is 0.05 and the number of trials is 500 (since there are 500 houses). Therefore, the expected value is:\n\nExpected value = 0.05 x 500 = 25\n\nSo, the student can conclude that, on average, 25 houses in that neighborhood will experience a burglary. However, it's worth noting that this is only a theoretical calculation based on the given probability and assumptions, and that the actual number of burglaries may vary depending on various factors.",
    "message_2": "You have already provided the correct solution to the problem. To reiterate:\n\nThe formula for expected value is:\n\nExpected value = probability x number of trials\n\nIn this case, the probability of a burglary occurring is 0.05, and there are 500 houses in the neighborhood. Therefore, the expected value is:\n\nExpected value = 0.05 x 500 = 25\n\nSo, on average, 25 houses in that neighborhood will experience a burglary. As mentioned earlier, this is a theoretical calculation based on the given probability and assumptions, and the actual number of burglaries may vary depending on various factors."
