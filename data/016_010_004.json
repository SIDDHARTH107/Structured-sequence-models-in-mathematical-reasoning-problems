    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by filling the space between three tangent circles with a fourth tangent circle, then recursively filling the spaces between the new circles with more tangent circles.\n\nThe curvatures (k) of the circles are related to their radii (r) by the formula:\n\nk = 1/r\n\nFor the initial three tangent circles, we have curvatures k1, k2, and k3:\n\nk1 = 1/2\nk2 = 1/3\nk3 = 1/4\n\nThe curvature of the fourth circle (k4) can be found using Descartes' Circle Theorem, which states that for four mutually tangent circles, the sum of the squares of their curvatures is equal to half the square of the sum of their curvatures:\n\n(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2) = (1/2 * (k1 + k2 + k3 + k4))^2\n\nWe can solve for k4:\n\nk4 = (k1 + k2 + k3) ± 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1)\n\nPlugging in the values for k1, k2, and k3:\n\nk4 = (1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4) ± 2 * sqrt((1/2 * 1/3) + (1/3 * 1/4) + (1/4 * 1/2))\nk4 = (13/12) ± 2 * sqrt(1/24 + 1/36 + 1/48)\nk4 = (13/12) ± 2 * sqrt(1/8)\n\nThere are two possible values for k4, but since we are looking for the largest circles, we will take the smaller curvature:\n\nk4 = (13/12) - 2 * sqrt(1/8)\nk4 ≈ 0.1547\n\nNow, we have the curvatures of the four largest circles in the Apollonian gasket:\n\nk1 = 1/2\nk2 = 1/3\nk3 = 1/4\nk4 ≈ 0.1547\n\nThe sum of their curvatures is:\n\nsum = k1 + k2 + k3 + k4\nsum = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 0.1547\nsum ≈ 0.5 + 0.3333 + 0.25 + 0.1547\nsum ≈ 1.238"
