    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 49, we know that |G| = 49 = 7^2. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_7, must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_7 divides the order of G, so n_7 divides 49.\n2. n_7 is congruent to 1 modulo 7.\n\nThe only possibilities for n_7 are 1 and 49. However, since n_7 must be congruent to 1 modulo 7, we can eliminate 49 as a possibility. Therefore, n_7 = 1.\n\nThis means that there is a unique 7-Sylow subgroup in G, which we will call H. Since H is unique, it must be a normal subgroup of G. Now, let K be another 7-Sylow subgroup of G. Then, |K| = 7, and K is also a normal subgroup of G.\n\nSince H and K are both normal subgroups of G, their intersection H âˆ© K is also a normal subgroup of G. However, since |H| = |K| = 7 and H and K are both subgroups of G, their intersection can either be the identity element or the entire group H (or K). Since H and K are distinct subgroups, their intersection must be the identity element.\n\nNow, consider the product HK of the elements in H and K. Since the intersection of H and K is the identity element, every element in HK is uniquely represented as a product of an element from H and an element from K. Therefore, |HK| = |H| * |K| = 7 * 7 = 49.\n\nSince |HK| = |G|, we can conclude that G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which are both cyclic groups of order 7. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7."
