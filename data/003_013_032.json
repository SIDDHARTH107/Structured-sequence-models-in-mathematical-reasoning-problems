    "message_1": "A tower stands 50 meters tall. From a point on the ground, you want to find the angle of elevation to the top of the tower. What is the maximum angle of elevation to the nearest degree?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum angle of elevation, we need to assume that the observer is standing at the base of the tower. In this case, the distance between the observer and the tower is 0 meters. \n\nWe can use the tangent function to find the angle of elevation:\n\ntan(angle) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\n\nIn this case, the opposite side is the height of the tower (50 meters), and the adjacent side is the distance between the observer and the tower (0 meters). However, dividing by 0 is undefined in mathematics. \n\nAs the observer gets closer and closer to the base of the tower, the angle of elevation approaches 90 degrees. Therefore, the maximum angle of elevation to the nearest degree is 90 degrees."
