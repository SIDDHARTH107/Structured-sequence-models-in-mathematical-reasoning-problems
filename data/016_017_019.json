    "message_2": "The length of the Heighway dragon curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2^(n/2))\n\nIn this case, the initial line segment has a length of 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 10 iterations. So, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(10/2))\n\nLength = 1 * (2^5)\n\nLength = 1 * 32\n\nLength = 32 units\n\nSo, the length of the Heighway dragon curve after 10 iterations is 32 units."
