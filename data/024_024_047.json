Let ω be the 1-form on M defined by:\nω = (2x + y)dx + (2y + z)dy + (2z + x)dz\nCalculate the Cartan connection 1-forms ωᵢⱼ on M with respect to the standard basis {∂/∂x,∂/∂y,∂/∂z} of the tangent space at each point.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Cartan connection 1-forms ωᵢⱼ, we first need to find a local frame (orthonormal basis) for the tangent space of M at each point. Since M is a sphere of radius 1, we can use the standard basis vectors of the tangent space at each point, which are given by the gradients of the coordinate functions with respect to the constraint equation:\n\n∇x = ∂/∂x - (2x)(∂/∂x) = (1 - 2x)∂/∂x\n∇y = ∂/∂y - (2y)(∂/∂y) = (1 - 2y)∂/∂y\n∇z = ∂/∂z - (2z)(∂/∂z) = (1 - 2z)∂/∂z\n\nNow, we can compute the Cartan connection 1-forms ωᵢⱼ by taking the inner product of the given 1-form ω with the basis vectors:\n\nω₁₂ = ⟨ω, ∇x ∧ ∇y⟩ = ((2x + y)(1 - 2x) + (2y + z)(1 - 2y))dx ∧ dy\nω₁₃ = ⟨ω, ∇x ∧ ∇z⟩ = ((2x + y)(1 - 2x) + (2z + x)(1 - 2z))dx ∧ dz\nω₂₃ = ⟨ω, ∇y ∧ ∇z⟩ = ((2y + z)(1 - 2y) + (2z + x)(1 - 2z))dy ∧ dz\n\nThus, the Cartan connection 1-forms ωᵢⱼ on M with respect to the standard basis {∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z} of the tangent space at each point are:\n\nω₁₂ = (2x² - 3x + 2y² - 3y)dx ∧ dy\nω₁₃ = (2x² - 3x + 2z² - 3z)dx ∧ dz\nω₂₃ = (2y² - 3y + 2z² - 3z)dy ∧ dz"
