    "message_2": "To determine the type and order of the singularity at z = 3, we first need to simplify the function f(z) and find its limit as z approaches 3.\n\nWe can factor the denominator of the function:\n\nz^3 - 27 = (z - 3)(z^2 + 3z + 9)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(z) = (z - 3)/((z - 3)(z^2 + 3z + 9))\n\nWe can cancel out the (z - 3) terms:\n\nf(z) = 1/(z^2 + 3z + 9)\n\nNow, let's find the limit as z approaches 3:\n\nlim (z -> 3) f(z) = lim (z -> 3) 1/(z^2 + 3z + 9)\n\nPlugging in z = 3:\n\nlim (z -> 3) f(z) = 1/(3^2 + 3*3 + 9) = 1/27\n\nSince the limit exists and is finite, the singularity at z = 3 is a removable singularity. The order of a removable singularity is 0."
