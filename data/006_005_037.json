    "message_2": "To find the probability of exactly 15 defective items out of 50, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k defective items\n- n is the total number of items (50 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective items (15 in this case)\n- p is the probability of a single item being defective (0.3 in this case)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 15) = (50C15) * (0.3^15) * (0.7^35)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 50C15:\n\n50C15 = 50! / (15!(50-15)!)\n= 50! / (15!35!)\n= 3,268,760 (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nNow, let's calculate (0.3^15) * (0.7^35):\n\n(0.3^15) * (0.7^35) ≈ 1.302e-5\n\nFinally, multiply the two results:\n\nP(X = 15) = 3,268,760 * 1.302e-5 ≈ 0.0426\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 15 of the 50 items produced in a day will be defective is approximately 0.0426 or 4.26%."
