    "message_2": "To disconnect a complete graph with 7 vertices into two disconnected graphs, we need to remove all the edges connected to a single vertex. In a complete graph, each vertex is connected to every other vertex. So, for a graph with 7 vertices, each vertex has 6 edges connected to it.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph into two disconnected graphs is 6."
