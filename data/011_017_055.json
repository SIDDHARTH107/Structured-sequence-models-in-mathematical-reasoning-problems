    "message_1": "Suppose you have a 4x4 Latin square where each row, column, and diagonal contains distinct integers from 1 to 4. What is the minimum number of entries you must fix in order for the Latin square to be uniquely determined?",
    "message_2": "To uniquely determine a 4x4 Latin square, we need to fix at least 9 entries. Here's why:\n\nConsider a 4x4 Latin square with the following structure:\n\n1 2 3 4\n2 1 4 3\n3 4 1 2\n4 3 2 1\n\nWe can see that the first row and first column are fixed. Now, let's look at the second row and second column. We can swap the 3 and 4 in the second row and the 3 and 4 in the second column, and we still have a valid Latin square:\n\n1 2 3 4\n2 1 4 3\n3 4 1 2\n4 3 2 1\n\nNow, let's swap the 3 and 4:\n\n1 2 4 3\n2 1 3 4\n3 4 1 2\n4 3 2 1\n\nWe can see that we have a different Latin square, but we only fixed 8 entries (the first row and first column). To uniquely determine the Latin square, we need to fix at least one more entry. For example, fixing the entry in the second row and second column:\n\n1 2 3 4\n2 1 4 3\n3 4 1 2\n4 3 2 1\n\nNow, the Latin square is uniquely determined, and we have fixed a total of 9 entries."
