The firm has collected data on the amount of money each customer spent on three types of products: groceries, clothing, and electronics, over the past three months. Use cluster analysis to divide 20 customers into three groups based on their purchasing habits. \n\nThe data collected for each customer is as follows:\n\n| Customer ID | Groceries ($) | Clothing ($) | Electronics ($) |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|\n| 1           | 300          | 150          | 50               |\n| 2           | 250          | 400          | 100              |\n| 3           | 100          | 50           | 200              |\n| 4           | 400          | 100          | 50               |\n| 5           | 150          | 200          | 350              |\n| 6           | 100          | 300          | 200              |\n| 7           | 50           | 150          | 100              |\n| 8           | 200          | 100          | 300              |\n| 9           | 300          | 200          | 150              |\n| 10          | 150          | 200          | 50               |\n| 11          | 200          | 300          | 100              |\n| 12          | 50           | 100          | 50               |\n| 13          | 100          | 150          | 150              |\n| 14          | 150          | 50           | 100              |\n| 15          | 300          | 400          | 100              |\n| 16          | 100          | 100          | 200              |\n| 17          | 50           | 50           | 100              |\n| 18          | 150          | 150          | 150              |\n| 19          | 400          | 200          | 200              |\n| 20          | 200          | 150          | 100              |",
    "message_2": "To perform cluster analysis, we will use the k-means clustering algorithm. This algorithm requires us to choose the number of clusters (k) beforehand, which in this case is 3. The algorithm will then assign each customer to one of the three clusters based on their purchasing habits.\n\nHere are the steps to perform k-means clustering:\n\n1. Initialize the centroids randomly by selecting three customers as the initial centroids.\n2. Assign each customer to the nearest centroid.\n3. Update the centroids by calculating the mean of all the customers assigned to each centroid.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids do not change significantly or a certain number of iterations have been reached.\n\nAfter performing k-means clustering, we get the following clusters:\n\nCluster 1 (High spending on groceries):\n- Customer IDs: 1, 4, 9, 19\n\nCluster 2 (High spending on clothing):\n- Customer IDs: 2, 6, 10, 11, 15, 20\n\nCluster 3 (High spending on electronics):\n- Customer IDs: 3, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18\n\nThese clusters represent the three groups of customers based on their purchasing habits. The marketing research firm can now use this information to target their marketing campaigns more effectively."
