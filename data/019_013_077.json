Define a second-order logic formula Φ(x) as follows: Φ(x) = \"for every subset S of Q, there exists a prime number p ∈ S such that p + x is also in S.\" Determine whether Φ(x) is true or false for x = 5.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether Φ(5) is true or false, we need to check if for every subset S of Q (the set of all prime numbers), there exists a prime number p ∈ S such that p + 5 is also in S.\n\nLet's consider some subsets of Q and see if we can find a counterexample:\n\n1. S = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...} (the set of all prime numbers)\nIn this case, we can choose p = 2, since 2 + 5 = 7, which is also in S.\n\n2. S = {3, 5, 7, 11, ...} (the set of all prime numbers except 2)\nIn this case, we can choose p = 3, since 3 + 5 = 8, which is not in S. This is a counterexample.\n\nSince we found a counterexample, Φ(5) is false."
