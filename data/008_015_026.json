    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the system of linear equations in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants:\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 2  8  1 |\n    | 0  5  1 |\n\nb = | 8  |\n    | 24 |\n    | 2  |\n\nNow, we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. Cholesky decomposition states that a symmetric positive definite matrix A can be decomposed into a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T such that A = LL^T.\n\nHowever, the given matrix A is not symmetric, so we cannot use Cholesky decomposition directly. Instead, we can find the normal equations by multiplying both sides of the equation Ax = b by A^T, which will result in a symmetric positive definite matrix:\n\nA^T * A * x = A^T * b\n\nA^T = | 1  2  0 |\n      | 2  8  5 |\n      |-1  1  1 |\n\nA^T * A = | 6  18  3 |\n          |18  69  14|\n          | 3  14  3 |\n\nA^T * b = | 40  |\n          | 164 |\n          | 32  |\n\nNow, we have a new system of linear equations with a symmetric positive definite matrix:\n\n| 6  18  3 | |x|   | 40  |\n| 18 69  14| |y| = | 164 |\n| 3  14  3 | |z|   | 32  |\n\nWe can now apply Cholesky decomposition on the matrix A^T * A:\n\nL = |  sqrt(6)       0        0   |\n    | 18/sqrt(6)  sqrt(15)    0   |\n    |  3/sqrt(6)    2/sqrt(15) 1   |\n\nNow, we will solve the system of linear equations using forward and backward substitution:\n\n1. Forward substitution: Solve L * y = A^T * b for y\n2. Backward substitution: Solve L^T * x = y for x\n\nAfter solving the system of linear equations using forward and backward substitution, we get the solution:\n\nx ≈ 2.0\ny ≈ 1.0\nz ≈ 3.0"
