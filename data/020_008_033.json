    "message_1": "A company has four factories located at points A(6,2), B(2,6), C(6,10), and D(10,6) in a coordinate grid. The company wants to transport goods from these factories to three warehouses located at points E(2,2), F(2,10), and G(10,6). The transportation cost per unit distance for each factory-warehouse pair is given in the following table:\n\n|        | E | F | G |\n|--------|---|---|---|\n| A      | 4 | 6 | 5 |\n| B      | 7 | 9 | 8 |\n| C      | 8 | 7 | 6 |\n| D      | 6 | 8 | 7 |\n\nHow many units should the company transport from each factory to each warehouse to minimize the total transportation cost, and what is that minimum cost?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total transportation cost, we need to find the shortest distance between each factory and warehouse, and then multiply that distance by the corresponding transportation cost per unit distance.\n\nFirst, let's find the distances between each factory and warehouse using the distance formula: √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nDistances:\nAE = √((2 - 6)^2 + (2 - 2)^2) = 4\nAF = √((2 - 6)^2 + (10 - 2)^2) = 8\nAG = √((10 - 6)^2 + (6 - 2)^2) = 4√2\n\nBE = √((2 - 2)^2 + (2 - 6)^2) = 4\nBF = √((2 - 2)^2 + (10 - 6)^2) = 4\nBG = √((10 - 2)^2 + (6 - 6)^2) = 8\n\nCE = √((2 - 6)^2 + (2 - 10)^2) = 8\nCF = √((2 - 6)^2 + (10 - 10)^2) = 4\nCG = √((10 - 6)^2 + (6 - 10)^2) = 4√2\n\nDE = √((2 - 10)^2 + (2 - 6)^2) = 8\nDF = √((2 - 10)^2 + (10 - 6)^2) = 8\nDG = √((10 - 10)^2 + (6 - 6)^2) = 0\n\nNow, let's multiply the distances by the corresponding transportation cost per unit distance:\n\nCosts:\nAE = 4 * 4 = 16\nAF = 8 * 6 = 48\nAG = 4√2 * 5 = 20√2\n\nBE = 4 * 7 = 28\nBF = 4 * 9 = 36\nBG = 8 * 8 = 64\n\nCE = 8 * 8 = 64\nCF = 4 * 7 = 28\nCG = 4√2 * 6 = 24√2\n\nDE = 8 * 6 = 48\nDF = 8 * 8 = 64\nDG = 0 * 7 = 0\n\nNow, let's find the minimum cost for each warehouse:\n\nWarehouse E: min(AE, BE, CE, DE) = min(16, 28, 64, 48) = 16 (from factory A)\nWarehouse F: min(AF, BF, CF, DF) = min(48, 36, 28, 64) = 28 (from factory C)\nWarehouse G: min(AG, BG, CG, DG) = min(20√2, 64, 24√2, 0) = 0 (from factory D)\n\nSo, the company should transport goods as follows:\n- From factory A to warehouse E: 1 unit\n- From factory C to warehouse F: 1 unit\n- From factory D to warehouse G: 1 unit\n\nThe minimum total transportation cost is 16 + 28 + 0 = 44."
