    "message_2": "To find the number of items produced on Day 5, we can use the formula:\n\nItems on Day N = Items on Day 1 * (Production multiplier)^(N-1)\n\nIn this case, the production multiplier is 3, and we want to find the number of items produced on Day 5. So, we can plug in the values:\n\nItems on Day 5 = 500 * (3)^(5-1)\n\nItems on Day 5 = 500 * (3)^4\n\nItems on Day 5 = 500 * 81\n\nItems on Day 5 = 40,500\n\nThe factory will produce 40,500 items on Day 5."
