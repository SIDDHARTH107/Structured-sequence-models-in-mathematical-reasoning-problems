    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and the surface area of each face can be found by squaring the side length. \n\nSurface area of one face = side length × side length = 5 cm × 5 cm = 25 cm²\n\nSince there are 6 faces, the total surface area of the cube is:\n\nTotal surface area = 6 × surface area of one face = 6 × 25 cm² = 150 cm²"
