    "message_2": "To find the dot product of vectors v and u using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nv • u = ||v|| ||u|| cos(θ)\n\nwhere ||v|| and ||u|| are the magnitudes of vectors v and u, respectively, and θ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors v and u:\n\n||v|| = √(3² + 5²) = √(9 + 25) = √34\n||u|| = √(7² + 2²) = √(49 + 4) = √53\n\nNow, let's find the angle between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (v • u) / (||v|| ||u||)\n\nTo find the dot product (v • u) using the given coordinates, we can use the formula:\n\nv • u = (3 * 7) + (5 * 2) = 21 + 10 = 31\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = 31 / (√34 * √53)\n\nWe can't simplify this expression further, so we'll leave it as is. Now, we can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nv • u = ||v|| ||u|| cos(θ) = (√34)(√53)(31 / (√34 * √53))\n\nThe (√34) and (√53) terms cancel out:\n\nv • u = 31\n\nSo, the dot product of vectors v and u is 31."
