    "message_1": "A wheel has a radius of 10 centimeters. What is the circumference of the wheel in centimeters?",
    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 10 centimeters. So, the circumference (C) can be calculated as follows:\n\nC = 2π(10 cm)\nC = 20π cm\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.14, we get:\n\nC ≈ 20 * 3.14 cm\nC ≈ 62.8 cm\n\nSo, the circumference of the wheel is approximately 62.8 centimeters."
