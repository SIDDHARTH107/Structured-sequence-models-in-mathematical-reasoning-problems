How many minutes will it take for John and Jane to finish the race together if they start at the same time and if they run at a constant pace? What is the LCM of 24 and 30?",
    "message_2": "To find out how many minutes it will take for John and Jane to finish the race together, we need to find their combined rate.\n\nJohn's rate: 4 miles / 24 minutes = 1/6 mile/minute\nJane's rate: 4 miles / 30 minutes = 1/7.5 mile/minute\n\nCombined rate: (1/6 + 1/7.5) mile/minute = (1/6 + 2/15) mile/minute = (5/30) mile/minute\n\nNow, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for them to complete the 4-mile race together.\n\nTime = Distance / Combined rate\nTime = 4 miles / (5/30 mile/minute) = 4 * (30/5) = 24 minutes\n\nSo, it will take John and Jane 24 minutes to finish the race together if they start at the same time and run at a constant pace.\n\nNow, let's find the LCM of 24 and 30.\n\nPrime factors of 24: 2^3 * 3\nPrime factors of 30: 2 * 3 * 5\n\nLCM(24, 30) = 2^3 * 3 * 5 = 8 * 3 * 5 = 120\n\nThe LCM of 24 and 30 is 120."
