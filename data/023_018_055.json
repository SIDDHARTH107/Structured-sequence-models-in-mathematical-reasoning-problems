    "message_2": "To find the steady-state output of the system, we first need to find the Laplace Transform of the input signal u(t) = 2cos(3t) + 3sin(5t).\n\nThe Laplace Transform of cos(at) is s / (s^2 + a^2) and the Laplace Transform of sin(at) is a / (s^2 + a^2). Therefore, the Laplace Transform of u(t) is:\n\nU(s) = 2 * (s / (s^2 + 3^2)) + 3 * (5 / (s^2 + 5^2))\n\nU(s) = 2s / (s^2 + 9) + 15 / (s^2 + 25)\n\nNow, we can find the output Y(s) in the Laplace domain by multiplying the transfer function G(s) with the input U(s):\n\nY(s) = G(s) * U(s)\n\nY(s) = (1 / (s^3 + 2s^2 + 3s + 4)) * (2s / (s^2 + 9) + 15 / (s^2 + 25))\n\nTo find the steady-state output, we need to apply the Inverse Laplace Transform to Y(s). However, finding the Inverse Laplace Transform of Y(s) analytically is quite complex and might not be possible in some cases. Instead, we can use the Final Value Theorem to find the steady-state output.\n\nThe Final Value Theorem states that:\n\nlim (t -> âˆž) y(t) = lim (s -> 0) s * Y(s)\n\nBefore applying the Final Value Theorem, we need to check if the poles of s * Y(s) have negative real parts. The poles of Y(s) are the roots of the denominator:\n\ns^3 + 2s^2 + 3s + 4 = 0\n\nThe poles of s * Y(s) are the poles of Y(s) and an additional pole at s = 0. Since the transfer function G(s) is a third-order system, it has three poles, and the additional pole at s = 0 makes it four poles. We can see that the real parts of the poles are negative, so we can apply the Final Value Theorem.\n\nNow, let's find the limit:\n\nlim (s -> 0) s * Y(s) = lim (s -> 0) s * (1 / (s^3 + 2s^2 + 3s + 4)) * (2s / (s^2 + 9) + 15 / (s^2 + 25))\n\nlim (s -> 0) (2s^2 / ((s^2 + 9)(s^3 + 2s^2 + 3s + 4)) + 15s / ((s^2 + 25)(s^3 + 2s^2 + 3s + 4)))\n\nAs s approaches 0, the limit becomes:\n\nlim (s -> 0) (0 + 0) = 0\n\nSo, the steady-state output of the system for the given input is 0."
