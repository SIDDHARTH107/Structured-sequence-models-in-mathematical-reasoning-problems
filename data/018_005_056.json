    "message_2": "To find the intersection of set A and its complement, we first need to define the universal set U and the complement of set A.\n\nLet U be the universal set that contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of set A, denoted as A', consists of all elements in U that are not in set A.\n\nNow, we want to find the intersection of set A and its complement A', which is denoted as A ∩ A'. By definition, the intersection of a set and its complement contains elements that are both in the set and its complement. However, since the complement of a set consists of elements that are not in the set, there cannot be any elements that are both in the set and its complement.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of set A and its complement A' is an empty set, denoted as ∅ or {}."
