    "message_2": "The center of the Mandelbrot set is located at the origin (0, 0). To find the distance between the center and the given point (-0.726895347709114071439, 0.188887129043845954792), we can use the distance formula:\n\nDistance = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nIn this case, x1 = 0, y1 = 0, x2 = -0.726895347709114071439, and y2 = 0.188887129043845954792.\n\nDistance = √((-0.726895347709114071439 - 0)^2 + (0.188887129043845954792 - 0)^2)\nDistance = √((-0.726895347709114071439)^2 + (0.188887129043845954792)^2)\n\nCalculating the distance:\n\nDistance ≈ √(0.528632955531 + 0.035677937904)\nDistance ≈ √(0.564310893435)\n\nDistance ≈ 0.751206516\n\nSo, the distance from the center of the Mandelbrot set to the given point is approximately 0.751206516."
