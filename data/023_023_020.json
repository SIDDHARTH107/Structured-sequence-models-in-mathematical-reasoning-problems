    "message_2": "To calculate the Fourier transform of the given network signal f(t), we'll first express the signal in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\nsin(θ) = (e^(jθ) - e^(-jθ)) / (2j)\ncos(θ) = (e^(jθ) + e^(-jθ)) / 2\n\nSo, the given signal can be written as:\n\nf(t) = 3(sin(2πt)) + 2(cos(4πt))\n     = 3((e^(j2πt) - e^(-j2πt)) / (2j)) + 2((e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt)) / 2)\n     = (3/2j)(e^(j2πt) - e^(-j2πt)) + (1)(e^(j4πt) + e^(-j4πt))\n\nNow, we can calculate the Fourier transform F(ω) of f(t):\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t)e^(-jωt)dt] from -∞ to ∞\n\nSince f(t) is a linear combination of complex exponentials, we can find the Fourier transform of each term separately and then add them up.\n\nLet's find the Fourier transform of each term:\n\n1. (3/2j)e^(j2πt)\nF1(ω) = ∫[((3/2j)e^(j2πt))e^(-jωt)dt] from -∞ to ∞\n      = (3/2j)∫[e^(j(2π-ω)t)dt] from -∞ to ∞\n\n2. -(3/2j)e^(-j2πt)\nF2(ω) = ∫[((-3/2j)e^(-j2πt))e^(-jωt)dt] from -∞ to ∞\n      = (-3/2j)∫[e^(-j(2π+ω)t)dt] from -∞ to ∞\n\n3. e^(j4πt)\nF3(ω) = ∫[(e^(j4πt))e^(-jωt)dt] from -∞ to ∞\n      = ∫[e^(j(4π-ω)t)dt] from -∞ to ∞\n\n4. e^(-j4πt)\nF4(ω) = ∫[(e^(-j4πt))e^(-jωt)dt] from -∞ to ∞\n      = ∫[e^(-j(4π+ω)t)dt] from -∞ to ∞\n\nEach of these integrals results in a Dirac delta function:\n\nF1(ω) = (3/2j)δ(ω - 2π)\nF2(ω) = (-3/2j)δ(ω + 2π)\nF3(ω) = δ(ω - 4π)\nF4(ω) = δ(ω + 4π)\n\nNow, we can add them up to get the Fourier transform of f(t):\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω) + F3(ω) + F4(ω)\n     = (3/2j)δ(ω - 2π) - (3/2j)δ(ω + 2π) + δ(ω - 4π) + δ(ω + 4π)\n\nThe amplitude and frequency of the network signal's components can be determined from the Fourier transform:\n\n1. Component 1: Amplitude = 3/2, Frequency = 2π rad/s (or 1 Hz)\n2. Component 2: Amplitude = 2, Frequency = 4π rad/s (or 2 Hz)"
