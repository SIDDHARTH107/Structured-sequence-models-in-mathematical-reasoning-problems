    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of the space obtained by deleting a point from the torus, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The Seifert-van Kampen theorem states that if a space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected sets A and B such that their intersection A ∩ B is also path-connected, then the fundamental group of X, denoted π₁(X), can be computed as the free product of the fundamental groups of A and B, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form i_A(γ) * i_B(γ)^(-1), where i_A and i_B are the inclusion maps of A ∩ B into A and B, respectively, and γ is an element of π₁(A ∩ B).\n\nLet X be the torus with a point removed, and let A and B be two open, path-connected sets that cover X, such that their intersection A ∩ B is also path-connected. We can choose A to be the torus with a small open disk removed around the deleted point, and B to be an open disk that contains the deleted point. Then, A is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of two circles (since it deformation retracts onto the two generating loops of the torus), and B is homotopy equivalent to a punctured disk, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle. Thus, we have:\n\nπ₁(A) = π₁(S¹ ∨ S¹) = Z * Z (the free product of two copies of the integers)\nπ₁(B) = π₁(S¹) = Z\n\nNow, we need to compute the fundamental group of the intersection A ∩ B. Since A ∩ B is an annulus with a point removed, it is homotopy equivalent to a circle. Therefore, π₁(A ∩ B) = Z.\n\nNext, we need to compute the inclusion maps i_A and i_B. Since A ∩ B is homotopy equivalent to a circle, we can choose a generator γ of π₁(A ∩ B) that corresponds to a loop going around the annulus. This loop can be deformed into a loop in A that goes around one of the generating loops of the torus, and into a loop in B that goes around the punctured disk. Therefore, we have:\n\ni_A(γ) = (1,0) (in the Z * Z notation)\ni_B(γ) = 1 (in the Z notation)\n\nNow, we can compute the fundamental group of X using the Seifert-van Kampen theorem:\n\nπ₁(X) = (π₁(A) * π₁(B)) / <(i_A(γ) * i_B(γ)^(-1))>\n      = (Z * Z * Z) / <((1,0) * 1^(-1))>\n      = (Z * Z * Z) / <(1,0)>\n\nThus, the fundamental group of the space obtained by deleting a point from the torus is isomorphic to the free product of two copies of the integers and one copy of the integers modulo the normal subgroup generated by (1,0), which is isomorphic to Z * Z."
