    "message_1": "A group of 6 friends wants to go on a road trip together and visit 5 different cities. They plan to split into 2 groups of 3 and each group will visit 3 of the cities. How many different ways can they split into groups and visit the cities?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the number of ways to split the 6 friends into 2 groups of 3.\n\nThere are 6 friends, so there are 6! (6 factorial) ways to arrange them in a line. However, we need to divide by 3! for each group since the order within each group doesn't matter, and then divide by 2! because the order of the groups doesn't matter either.\n\nSo the number of ways to split the friends into groups is:\n\n(6!) / (3! * 3! * 2!) = 720 / (6 * 6 * 2) = 720 / 72 = 10 ways.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to visit the cities.\n\nThere are 5 cities, and each group will visit 3 of them. We can use combinations to find the number of ways to choose 3 cities out of 5 for the first group:\n\nC(5,3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 5! / (3! * 2!) = 120 / (6 * 2) = 10 ways.\n\nOnce the first group has chosen their 3 cities, the second group will visit the remaining 2 cities plus 1 city that the first group is also visiting. There are 3 ways to choose this additional city (since the first group is visiting 3 cities).\n\nSo, the total number of ways for the groups to visit the cities is:\n\n10 (ways to choose cities for the first group) * 3 (ways to choose the additional city for the second group) = 30 ways.\n\nFinally, we need to multiply the number of ways to split the friends into groups by the number of ways to visit the cities:\n\n10 (ways to split friends) * 30 (ways to visit cities) = 300 ways.\n\nTherefore, there are 300 different ways for the friends to split into groups and visit the cities."
