    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (also known as the fractal dimension) of the Cantor set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor set, at each step, the number of self-similar pieces (N) is 2, as each segment is divided into two equal parts. The scaling factor (s) is 3, as each segment is one-third the length of the previous segment.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Cantor set is:\n\nD = log(2) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is approximately 0.6309."
