The following data were collected:\n\n- 10 patients survived for less than 50 days\n- 15 patients survived between 50 and 100 days\n- 12 patients survived between 100 and 150 days\n- 8 patients survived more than 150 days\n- 5 patients discontinued treatment before 50 days\n\nWhat is the percentage of patients who survived more than 100 days?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of patients who survived more than 100 days, we need to consider the number of patients who survived between 100 and 150 days and those who survived more than 150 days. \n\nThere were 12 patients who survived between 100 and 150 days and 8 patients who survived more than 150 days. So, a total of 12 + 8 = 20 patients survived more than 100 days.\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of these 20 patients out of the total 50 patients. \n\nPercentage = (Number of patients who survived more than 100 days / Total number of patients) * 100\n\nPercentage = (20 / 50) * 100 = 0.4 * 100 = 40%\n\nSo, 40% of the patients survived more than 100 days."
