    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 800 hours, and the population standard deviation (σ) is 50 hours. We have a sample size (n) of 100 light bulbs.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\n\nσ_sample_mean = 50 / √100\nσ_sample_mean = 50 / 10\nσ_sample_mean = 5 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 790 hours. The z-score is given by the formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\n\nz = (790 - 800) / 5\nz = -10 / 5\nz = -2\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean is less than 790 hours, which is equivalent to finding the area to the left of the z-score of -2 in the standard normal distribution table.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the area to the left of z = -2 is approximately 0.0228.\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean lifetime of the light bulbs is less than 790 hours is approximately 0.0228 or 2.28%."
