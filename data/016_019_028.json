    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the Koch island after the 6th iteration, we need to understand how the perimeter changes with each iteration.\n\nIn the first iteration, the initial line segment is divided into 4 equal parts, and the middle 2 segments are replaced with an equilateral triangle. This means that the length of each segment in the first iteration is 1/3 of the original length. However, there are now 4 segments instead of 1, so the total length of the first iteration is 4 * (1/3) = 4/3.\n\nWith each subsequent iteration, the same process is applied to each segment, so the length of each segment is divided by 3, and the number of segments is multiplied by 4. Therefore, the perimeter of the Koch island after the nth iteration can be calculated as:\n\nPerimeter = (4^n / 3^(n-1)) * initial length\n\nFor the 6th iteration, we have:\n\nPerimeter = (4^6 / 3^5) * 1 = (4096 / 243) * 1 â‰ˆ 16.84 units"
