    "message_1": "Suppose you have collected data on the heights (in inches) and weights (in pounds) of 50 male students in a college. You want to use discriminant analysis to see if you can predict whether a male student plays basketball or not based on his height and weight. The mean height and weight of male students who play basketball are 75 inches and 190 pounds, respectively, while the mean height and weight of male students who do not play basketball are 70 inches and 160 pounds, respectively. The covariance matrix for height and weight of basketball players is [[36, 42], [42, 196]] and that for non-basketball players is [[16, 24], [24, 144]]. Using this information, find the equation of the discriminant function that can be used to predict whether a male student plays basketball or not based on his height and weight.",
    "message_2": "To find the discriminant function, we first need to calculate the pooled covariance matrix. The pooled covariance matrix is the weighted average of the two covariance matrices, where the weights are the proportions of basketball players and non-basketball players in the sample.\n\nLet p1 be the proportion of basketball players and p2 be the proportion of non-basketball players. Since we don't have the exact numbers of basketball and non-basketball players, we can assume equal proportions for simplicity: p1 = p2 = 0.5.\n\nPooled covariance matrix = p1 * Covariance matrix of basketball players + p2 * Covariance matrix of non-basketball players\n\nPooled covariance matrix = 0.5 * [[36, 42], [42, 196]] + 0.5 * [[16, 24], [24, 144]]\nPooled covariance matrix = [[26, 33], [33, 170]]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of the pooled covariance matrix:\n\nPooled covariance matrix inverse = [[a, b], [c, d]]\n\nTo find the inverse, we use the formula:\n\nInverse = (1 / determinant) * [[d, -b], [-c, a]]\n\nDeterminant = (26 * 170) - (33 * 33) = 4400 - 1089 = 3311\n\nPooled covariance matrix inverse = (1 / 3311) * [[170, -33], [-33, 26]]\nPooled covariance matrix inverse = [[0.0513, -0.00996], [-0.00996, 0.00785]]\n\nNow, we can find the discriminant function using the formula:\n\nD(x) = (x - mean1) * Pooled covariance matrix inverse * (mean2 - mean1)\n\nwhere x is the vector of height and weight, mean1 is the mean vector of basketball players, and mean2 is the mean vector of non-basketball players.\n\nD(x) = (x - [75, 190]) * [[0.0513, -0.00996], [-0.00996, 0.00785]] * ([70, 160] - [75, 190])\nD(x) = (x - [75, 190]) * [[0.0513, -0.00996], [-0.00996, 0.00785]] * [-5, -30]\n\nNow, we can multiply the matrices:\n\nD(x) = (x - [75, 190]) * [[0.2565, 0.298], [0.0498, 0.2355]]\n\nFinally, we can write the discriminant function as:\n\nD(x) = (x1 - 75) * 0.2565 + (x2 - 190) * 0.298 + (x1 - 75) * 0.0498 + (x2 - 190) * 0.2355\n\nwhere x1 is the height and x2 is the weight of a male student.\n\nThis is the discriminant function that can be used to predict whether a male student plays basketball or not based on his height and weight."
