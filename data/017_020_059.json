    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of subgroups of order 5 as n. Each subgroup of order 5 is cyclic, since 5 is prime. Therefore, each subgroup of order 5 has exactly 4 non-identity elements of order 5 (since the order of an element divides the order of the group, and the only divisors of 5 are 1 and 5).\n\nNow, we know that G has 12 elements of order 5. Since each subgroup of order 5 contains 4 non-identity elements of order 5, and each element of order 5 belongs to exactly one such subgroup, we have:\n\n4n = 12\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n\nn = 3\n\nThus, there are 3 subgroups of G of order 5."
