    "message_1": "A principal hires an agent to perform a task, but the agent's effort level is not directly observable. The principal believes that the agent's effort level is either high (with probability 0.6) or low (with probability 0.4), and that the task is worth either $100 or $50 depending on the effort level. Suppose the agent's effort level is observable by paying a cost of $20. Should the principal observe the effort level of the agent? If yes, what effort level should the principal choose to incentivize the agent to work harder? Assume that the agent's cost of high effort is $40 and the cost of low effort is $20.",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the expected value of the task without observing the agent's effort level:\n\nExpected value = (probability of high effort * value of high effort) + (probability of low effort * value of low effort)\nExpected value = (0.6 * $100) + (0.4 * $50)\nExpected value = $60 + $20\nExpected value = $80\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected value of the task if the principal observes the agent's effort level and pays the $20 cost:\n\nExpected value (observed) = (probability of high effort * (value of high effort - cost of observation)) + (probability of low effort * (value of low effort - cost of observation))\nExpected value (observed) = (0.6 * ($100 - $20)) + (0.4 * ($50 - $20))\nExpected value (observed) = (0.6 * $80) + (0.4 * $30)\nExpected value (observed) = $48 + $12\nExpected value (observed) = $60\n\nComparing the expected values, we can see that the expected value without observing the agent's effort level ($80) is higher than the expected value with observation ($60). Therefore, the principal should not observe the agent's effort level.\n\nHowever, if the principal wants to incentivize the agent to work harder, they can offer a performance-based contract. To do this, the principal should set a payment that compensates the agent for the additional cost of high effort and makes the agent prefer high effort over low effort.\n\nLet P_high be the payment for high effort and P_low be the payment for low effort. The agent will prefer high effort if:\n\n(P_high - cost of high effort) > (P_low - cost of low effort)\n(P_high - $40) > (P_low - $20)\n\nTo incentivize high effort, the principal can set P_high and P_low such that the inequality holds. For example, the principal can set P_high = $70 and P_low = $30. In this case:\n\n($70 - $40) > ($30 - $20)\n$30 > $10\n\nThe inequality holds, so the agent will prefer high effort."
