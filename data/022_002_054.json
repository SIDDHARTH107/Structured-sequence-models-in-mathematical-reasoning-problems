    "message_2": "Let's start by writing the equation of the unit circle in the z-plane. The unit circle is given by the equation:\n\n$|z| = 1$\n\nNow, we want to find the image of this curve under the conformal map $w(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$. To do this, we can substitute $z = \\frac{1}{w}$ into the equation for the unit circle:\n\n$| \\frac{1}{w} | = 1$\n\nNow, we can manipulate this equation to find the equation of the image curve in the w-plane. First, we can take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\n$|w| = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$\n\nThis tells us that the image curve in the w-plane is also a unit circle. The equation of the image curve in the w-plane is:\n\n$|w| = 1$"
