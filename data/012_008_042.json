    "message_2": "To determine if a graph G is planar or non-planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nWe are given that G has 8 vertices (v = 8) and 12 edges (e = 12). We can also use the inequality for planar graphs:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nLet's check if the inequality holds for our graph:\n\n12 ≤ 3 * 8 - 6\n12 ≤ 24 - 6\n12 ≤ 18\n\nThe inequality holds, so it is possible that the graph is planar. However, this is not a guarantee, so we need to check further.\n\nWe can also use Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph with 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph with 3 vertices in each partition). In our case, since the graph has only 8 vertices, it cannot contain a subdivision of K5, as K5 has 5 vertices. Similarly, it cannot contain a subdivision of K3,3, as K3,3 has 6 vertices.\n\nSince the graph does not contain a subdivision of K5 or K3,3, and the inequality for planar graphs holds, we can conclude that the graph G is planar."
