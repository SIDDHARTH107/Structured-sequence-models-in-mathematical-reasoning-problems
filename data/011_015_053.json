What is the minimum number of guests who must be friends with each other or at least strangers with each other, in order to guarantee that there are 3 guests who are all friends or 3 guests who are all strangers?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's consider one guest, say guest A. There are 5 other guests, so guest A must either be friends with at least 3 of them or be strangers with at least 3 of them. Without loss of generality, let's assume guest A is friends with at least 3 other guests.\n\nNow, let's consider the 3 guests that are friends with guest A: B, C, and D. If any one of these 3 guests (B, C, or D) is friends with another one among them, then we have a group of 3 friends (A, and the two friends among B, C, and D). If none of them are friends with each other, then B, C, and D form a group of 3 strangers.\n\nIn either case, we are guaranteed to have a group of 3 guests who are all friends or 3 guests who are all strangers. Therefore, the minimum number of guests who must be friends with each other or at least strangers with each other is 3."
