    "message_1": "Suppose that a company produces two types of cell phones. To test the battery lives of these cell phones, a researcher randomly selects 20 cell phones of each type from the company's inventory (40 total cell phones) and records the battery life for each one. The battery lives (in hours) are shown below:\n\nType A: 15, 18, 22, 16, 20, 14, 19, 20, 17, 21, 23, 22, 19, 18, 16, 20, 21, 20, 16, 22\n\nType B: 17, 20, 12, 15, 18, 16, 21, 19, 14, 18, 20, 21, 22, 17, 15, 19, 16, 18, 21, 20\n\nCompute the sample mean and sample standard deviation of battery life for both cell phone types, and determine which type, if any, has a longer average battery life.",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute the sample mean for both cell phone types.\n\nType A:\nMean = (15 + 18 + 22 + 16 + 20 + 14 + 19 + 20 + 17 + 21 + 23 + 22 + 19 + 18 + 16 + 20 + 21 + 20 + 16 + 22) / 20\nMean = 383 / 20\nMean = 19.15 hours\n\nType B:\nMean = (17 + 20 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 16 + 21 + 19 + 14 + 18 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 17 + 15 + 19 + 16 + 18 + 21 + 20) / 20\nMean = 350 / 20\nMean = 17.5 hours\n\nNow, let's compute the sample standard deviation for both cell phone types.\n\nType A:\n1. Calculate the squared difference between each value and the mean: (15-19.15)^2, (18-19.15)^2, ..., (22-19.15)^2\n2. Sum the squared differences: 17.2225 + 1.3225 + ... + 8.1025 = 131.15\n3. Divide the sum by (n-1): 131.15 / (20-1) = 131.15 / 19 = 6.902631\n4. Take the square root: √6.902631 = 2.6277 (approximately)\n\nType A sample standard deviation ≈ 2.6277 hours\n\nType B:\n1. Calculate the squared difference between each value and the mean: (17-17.5)^2, (20-17.5)^2, ..., (20-17.5)^2\n2. Sum the squared differences: 0.25 + 6.25 + ... + 6.25 = 104.5\n3. Divide the sum by (n-1): 104.5 / (20-1) = 104.5 / 19 = 5.5\n4. Take the square root: √5.5 = 2.3452 (approximately)\n\nType B sample standard deviation ≈ 2.3452 hours\n\nComparing the sample means, we can see that Type A cell phones have a longer average battery life (19.15 hours) than Type B cell phones (17.5 hours)."
