    "message_2": "First, we will solve one of the equations for one of the variables. We can choose either equation, but let's solve the second equation for y:\n\n2x - y = 3\n\nAdd y to both sides:\n2x = y + 3\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\ny = 2x - 3\n\nNow that we have y in terms of x, we can substitute this expression into the first equation:\n\n5x + 3(2x - 3) = 11\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n5x + 6x - 9 = 11\n\nCombine like terms:\n11x - 9 = 11\n\nAdd 9 to both sides:\n11x = 20\n\nDivide by 11:\nx = 20/11\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into the expression we found for y:\n\ny = 2(20/11) - 3\n\nMultiply:\ny = 40/11 - 3\n\nTo subtract, we need a common denominator, which is 11:\n\ny = 40/11 - 33/11\n\nSubtract:\ny = 7/11\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 20/11 and y = 7/11"
