    "message_2": "To find the expected value and variance of X(2), we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The SDE is a linear SDE of the form:\n\ndX(t) = a(X(t), t)dt + b(X(t), t)dW(t)\n\nwhere a(X(t), t) = 2X(t) + 1 and b(X(t), t) = 3.\n\nWe can rewrite the SDE as:\n\ndX(t) - (2X(t) + 1)dt = 3dW(t)\n\nNow, we can apply the integrating factor method. The integrating factor is given by:\n\nμ(t) = exp(-∫2dt) = exp(-2t)\n\nMultiply both sides of the SDE by the integrating factor:\n\nμ(t)dX(t) - 2μ(t)X(t)dt = 3μ(t)dW(t)\n\nNow, the left-hand side is the differential of the product of X(t) and the integrating factor:\n\nd(μ(t)X(t)) = 3μ(t)dW(t)\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t from 0 to 2:\n\n∫₀² d(μ(t)X(t)) = ∫₀² 3μ(t)dW(t)\n\nμ(2)X(2) - μ(0)X(0) = ∫₀² 3μ(t)dW(t)\n\nNow, we can find the expected value and variance of X(2). The expected value is given by:\n\nE[X(2)] = E[μ(0)X(0)/μ(2) + (1/μ(2))∫₀² 3μ(t)dW(t)]\n\nSince X(0) = 1 and μ(0) = exp(-2*0) = 1, we have:\n\nE[X(2)] = E[1/exp(-2*2) + (1/exp(-2*2))∫₀² 3μ(t)dW(t)]\n\nThe expected value of the stochastic integral is zero, so:\n\nE[X(2)] = 1/exp(-4) = e^4\n\nNow, let's find the variance of X(2). The variance is given by:\n\nVar[X(2)] = E[X(2)^2] - E[X(2)]^2\n\nWe already found E[X(2)] = e^4. Now we need to find E[X(2)^2]:\n\nE[X(2)^2] = E[((1/exp(-4)) + (1/exp(-4))∫₀² 3μ(t)dW(t))^2]\n\nUsing the Ito isometry property, we have:\n\nE[((1/exp(-4))∫₀² 3μ(t)dW(t))^2] = (1/exp(-8))∫₀² (3μ(t))^2 dt\n\nEvaluate the integral:\n\n(1/exp(-8))∫₀² (9exp(-2t)) dt = (1/exp(-8))[-(9/2)exp(-2t)]₀² = (9/2)(1 - exp(-4))\n\nNow, we can find E[X(2)^2]:\n\nE[X(2)^2] = (1/exp(-4))^2 + 2(1/exp(-4))(9/2)(1 - exp(-4))\n\nE[X(2)^2] = e^8 + 9(e^4 - 1)\n\nFinally, we can find the variance:\n\nVar[X(2)] = E[X(2)^2] - E[X(2)]^2 = (e^8 + 9(e^4 - 1)) - (e^4)^2\n\nVar[X(2)] = e^8 - e^8 + 9(e^4 - 1) = 9(e^4 - 1)\n\nSo, the expected value of X(2) is e^4 and the variance of X(2) is 9(e^4 - 1)."
