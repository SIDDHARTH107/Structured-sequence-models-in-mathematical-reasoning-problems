    "message_2": "Goldbach's Conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. To find the smallest even number that can be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers, we can start by examining the even numbers greater than 2.\n\nThe smallest even number greater than 2 is 4. However, 4 cannot be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers because the only way to express 4 as the sum of two numbers is 2 + 2, and 2 is not an odd prime number.\n\nThe next smallest even number is 6. We can express 6 as the sum of two odd prime numbers: 3 + 3. Both 3 and 3 are odd prime numbers, so 6 is the smallest even number that can be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers according to Goldbach's Conjecture.\n\nProof:\n\nTo prove that 6 is the smallest even number that can be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers, we can use proof by contradiction.\n\nAssume that there exists an even number smaller than 6 that can be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers. The only even number smaller than 6 and greater than 2 is 4. However, we have already shown that 4 cannot be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers. This contradicts our assumption, so our assumption must be false.\n\nTherefore, 6 is the smallest even number that can be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers according to Goldbach's Conjecture."
