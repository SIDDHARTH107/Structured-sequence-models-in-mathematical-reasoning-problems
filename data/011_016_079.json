    "message_1": "A designer wants to create a football schedule for a tournament where 10 teams are participating. Each team must play against every other team exactly once. How many matches should be played in total for the tournament?",
    "message_2": "To determine the total number of matches to be played in the tournament, we can use the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of teams and k is the number of teams playing in each match (which is 2 in this case).\n\nSo, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9 * 8!)/(2 * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9)/2\n\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nTherefore, a total of 45 matches should be played in the tournament."
