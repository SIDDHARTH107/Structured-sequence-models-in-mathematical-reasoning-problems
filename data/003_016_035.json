    "message_1": "A sine function with a period of 6 has a phase shift of 1.5 units to the right. Write the equation of the function in the form y = A sin (Bx - C) and determine the amplitude A, frequency B, and phase shift C.",
    "message_2": "To write the equation of the sine function in the form y = A sin(Bx - C), we need to determine the amplitude A, frequency B, and phase shift C.\n\n1. Amplitude (A): Since no information is given about the amplitude, we can assume that the amplitude is 1. So, A = 1.\n\n2. Period: The problem states that the period of the sine function is 6. The period of a sine function is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / B\n\nWe can solve for B:\n\n6 = (2π) / B\nB = (2π) / 6\nB = π / 3\n\n3. Phase Shift: The problem states that there is a phase shift of 1.5 units to the right. This means that the value of C in the equation y = A sin(Bx - C) is positive. To find the value of C, we can use the formula:\n\nPhase Shift = C / B\n\nWe can solve for C:\n\n1.5 = C / (π / 3)\nC = 1.5 * (π / 3)\nC = 0.5π\n\nNow that we have the values for A, B, and C, we can write the equation of the sine function:\n\ny = A sin(Bx - C)\ny = 1 sin((π / 3)x - 0.5π)\n\nSo, the equation of the sine function is y = sin((π / 3)x - 0.5π) with amplitude A = 1, frequency B = π / 3, and phase shift C = 0.5π."
