    "message_1": "A lighthouse is located 120 meters from the coastline. A sailor on the coast is looking up at the lighthouse at an angle of elevation of 35 degrees. How tall is the lighthouse (to the nearest meter)?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the lighthouse, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 35 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the coastline to the lighthouse (120 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the lighthouse (which we want to find).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(35°) = height / 120\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 120:\n\nheight = 120 * tan(35°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 35 degrees and then multiply it by 120:\n\nheight ≈ 120 * 0.7002\nheight ≈ 84.024\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the lighthouse is approximately 84 meters."
