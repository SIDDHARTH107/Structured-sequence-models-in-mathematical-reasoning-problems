    "message_2": "To minimize the amount of metal used for the construction of the box, we need to minimize its surface area. Let the dimensions of the box be length (L), width (W), and height (H). The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = L * W * H = 500 cm³\n\nThe surface area of the box is given by:\n\nA = 2(LW + WH + LH)\n\nWe need to minimize A while keeping the volume constant at 500 cm³. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we express W and H in terms of L and the volume:\n\nW = V / (L * H)\nH = V / (L * W)\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the surface area equation:\n\nA = 2(L * (V / (L * H)) + (V / (L * W)) * H + L * (V / (L * W)))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nA = 2(V / H + V / W + V / L)\n\nNow, differentiate A with respect to L, W, and H:\n\n∂A/∂L = -2V / L²\n∂A/∂W = -2V / W²\n∂A/∂H = -2V / H²\n\nSet these derivatives equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n-2V / L² = 0\n-2V / W² = 0\n-2V / H² = 0\n\nSince V ≠ 0, we have:\n\nL² = W² = H²\n\nThis implies that L = W = H. So, the box is a cube. Now, substitute this back into the volume equation:\n\nL³ = 500 cm³\n\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\nL = (500)^(1/3) ≈ 7.937 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular box that will minimize the amount of metal used for its construction are approximately 7.937 cm × 7.937 cm × 7.937 cm."
