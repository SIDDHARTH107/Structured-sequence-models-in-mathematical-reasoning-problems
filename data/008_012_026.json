    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to represent the system in matrix form. We can write the system as AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x and y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = |  7  |\n    | -13 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix can be found using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of A and adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nThe determinant of A is:\n\ndet(A) = (2 * -5) - (3 * 4) = -10 - 12 = -22\n\nThe adjugate of A is found by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements:\n\nadj(A) = | -5 -3 |\n         | -4  2 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of A:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-22) * | -5 -3 |\n                  | -4  2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 5/22  3/22 |\n         | 4/22 -2/22 |\n\nNow, to find the values of x and y, we can multiply A^(-1) by B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  5/22  3/22 | * |  7  |\n    |  4/22 -2/22 |   | -13 |\n\nX = | (5/22)*7 + (3/22)*(-13) |\n    | (4/22)*7 + (-2/22)*(-13) |\n\nX = | 1 |\n    | 2 |\n\nSo, the values of x and y are:\n\nx = 1\ny = 2"
