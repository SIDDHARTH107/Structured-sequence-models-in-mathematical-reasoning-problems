    "message_2": "First, let's translate the given statement into logical notation using predicate logic. The statement is: \"There exists a prime number that is also a multiple of 3.\"\n\nIn logical notation, this can be written as:\n∃x (P(x) ∧ Q(x))\n\nNow, we need to negate this statement. The negation of an existential quantifier (∃) is a universal quantifier (∀), and we also need to negate the expression inside the parentheses. The negation of a conjunction (AND, ∧) is a disjunction (OR, ∨) with negated operands.\n\nSo, the negation of the given statement is:\n∀x (¬P(x) ∨ ¬Q(x))\n\nThis translates back to: \"For all numbers x, either x is not a prime number or x is not a multiple of 3.\""
