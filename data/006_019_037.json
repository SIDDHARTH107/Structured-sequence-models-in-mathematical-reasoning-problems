    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a presidential candidate winning the election, we need to consider the approval rating, confidence level, and margin of error. \n\nThe approval rating is 65%, which means that 65% of registered voters support the candidate. The margin of error is Â±3.5%, which means that the actual approval rating could be as low as 61.5% (65% - 3.5%) or as high as 68.5% (65% + 3.5%). \n\nThe 95% confidence level among pollsters means that they are 95% confident that the true approval rating lies within the margin of error. In other words, there is a 95% chance that the true approval rating is between 61.5% and 68.5%.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly calculate the probability of the candidate winning the election based on this information alone. This is because the probability of winning depends on various factors such as the approval ratings of other candidates, the electoral system, and voter turnout, among others.\n\nIn summary, while we know that there is a 95% confidence level that the candidate's approval rating lies between 61.5% and 68.5%, we cannot determine the exact probability of the candidate winning the election without more information."
