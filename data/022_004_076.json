    "message_2": "To determine the type of singularities, we first need to find the singular points of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)/(z - i)^2.\n\nSingular points occur when the denominator of the function is equal to zero. In this case, the denominator is (z - i)^2. Setting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n(z - i)^2 = 0\nz - i = 0\nz = i\n\nSo, the function has a singularity at z = i. Since the denominator has a power of 2, this singularity is a pole. The order of the pole is the power of the denominator, which is 2 in this case. Therefore, f(z) has a pole of order 2 at z = i.\n\nNow, let's consider the point at infinity. To analyze the behavior of the function at infinity, we can use the substitution w = 1/z, and analyze the behavior of the function as w approaches 0. The function becomes:\n\nf(w) = ((1/w)^2 - 1)/((1/w) - i)^2\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by w^4, we get:\n\nf(w) = (w^4 - w^2)/(1 - iw)^2\n\nAs w approaches 0, the function f(w) approaches 0. This means that f(z) has a removable singularity at z = infinity.\n\nIn summary, f(z) has a pole of order 2 at z = i and a removable singularity at z = infinity."
