    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 5, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by this quadratic function. The vertex of a parabola in the form of f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c is given by the formula:\n\nx_vertex = -b / (2a)\n\nIn our case, a = 1 and b = -3, so:\n\nx_vertex = -(-3) / (2 * 1) = 3 / 2 = 1.5\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging x_vertex back into the function:\n\nf(1.5) = (1.5)^2 - 3(1.5) + 5 = 2.25 - 4.5 + 5 = 2.75\n\nHowever, since x is a random variable with a normal distribution having a mean of 2 and a standard deviation of 0.5, the minimum value of the function will not necessarily occur at x = 1.5. The probability of x being exactly 1.5 is very low. Nonetheless, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 5 given the normal distribution of x is approximately 2.75."
