    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a compact surface S with boundary curve C, we have:\n\n∫∫_S K dA + ∫_C k_g ds = 2πχ(S)\n\nwhere K is the Gaussian curvature of the surface, k_g is the geodesic curvature of the boundary curve, and χ(S) is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nIn this case, we are given K = 2 and χ(S) = 1. We want to find the total geodesic curvature of the boundary curve, which is given by:\n\n∫_C k_g ds\n\nUsing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n∫∫_S 2 dA + ∫_C k_g ds = 2π(1)\n\nNow, let A be the total area of the surface S. Then, we have:\n\n2A + ∫_C k_g ds = 2π\n\nWe want to find the total geodesic curvature of the boundary curve, which is given by:\n\n∫_C k_g ds = 2π - 2A\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine the area A of the surface S, we cannot find the exact value of the total geodesic curvature of the boundary curve. However, we can express it in terms of the area A as:\n\n∫_C k_g ds = 2π - 2A"
