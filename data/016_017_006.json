    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. After each iteration, the total length of the curve doubles.\n\nLet's calculate the total length after 10 iterations:\n\n1. Initial length: 1 unit\n2. After 1st iteration: 1 * 2 = 2 units\n3. After 2nd iteration: 2 * 2 = 4 units\n4. After 3rd iteration: 4 * 2 = 8 units\n5. After 4th iteration: 8 * 2 = 16 units\n6. After 5th iteration: 16 * 2 = 32 units\n7. After 6th iteration: 32 * 2 = 64 units\n8. After 7th iteration: 64 * 2 = 128 units\n9. After 8th iteration: 128 * 2 = 256 units\n10. After 9th iteration: 256 * 2 = 512 units\n11. After 10th iteration: 512 * 2 = 1024 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve after 10 iterations is 1024 units."
