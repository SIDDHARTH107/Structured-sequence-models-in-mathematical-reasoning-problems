If they are isomorphic, provide an isomorphism between the two graphs. If they are not isomorphic, explain why.",
    "message_2": "The two graphs are isomorphic. An isomorphism between the two graphs can be established by mapping the vertices of Graph 1 to the vertices of Graph 2 as follows:\n\nA -> P\nB -> Q\nC -> R\nD -> S\n\nThis mapping preserves the adjacency of the vertices, as the edges in Graph 1 (A-B, A-C, B-D, and C-D) correspond to the edges in Graph 2 (P-Q, P-R, Q-S, and R-S) under this mapping. Since the adjacency of the vertices is preserved, the two graphs are isomorphic."
