    "message_2": "To find the prime factorization of 135 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random starting point x0 and a function f(x) (usually f(x) = x^2 + c, where c is a constant). For simplicity, let's choose x0 = 2 and f(x) = x^2 + 1.\n\n2. Generate a sequence of numbers using the function f(x) and the previous number in the sequence. We will also compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difference between the current number and the previous number with 135.\n\nHere's the sequence and GCD calculations:\n\nx0 = 2\nx1 = f(x0) = 2^2 + 1 = 5, GCD(5 - 2, 135) = GCD(3, 135) = 3\nx2 = f(x1) = 5^2 + 1 = 26, GCD(26 - 5, 135) = GCD(21, 135) = 3\nx3 = f(x2) = 26^2 + 1 = 677, GCD(677 - 26, 135) = GCD(651, 135) = 3\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor, 3. Now we can divide 135 by 3 to get the remaining factor:\n\n135 / 3 = 45\n\nNow we need to factor 45 using the same method:\n\nx0 = 2\nx1 = f(x0) = 2^2 + 1 = 5, GCD(5 - 2, 45) = GCD(3, 45) = 3\nx2 = f(x1) = 5^2 + 1 = 26, GCD(26 - 5, 45) = GCD(21, 45) = 3\n\nWe found another non-trivial factor, 3. Now we can divide 45 by 3 to get the remaining factor:\n\n45 / 3 = 15\n\nFinally, we need to factor 15 using the same method:\n\nx0 = 2\nx1 = f(x0) = 2^2 + 1 = 5, GCD(5 - 2, 15) = GCD(3, 15) = 3\n\nWe found the last non-trivial factor, 3. Now we can divide 15 by 3 to get the remaining factor:\n\n15 / 3 = 5\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 135 using Pollard's rho algorithm is:\n\n135 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 3^3 × 5"
