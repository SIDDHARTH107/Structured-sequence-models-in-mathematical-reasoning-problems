If the student has 5 items to pack with weights of 2 kg, 4 kg, 6 kg, 7 kg, and 8 kg. What is the maximum weight the student can pack in their backpack using the Knapsack problem algorithm?",
    "message_2": "The Knapsack problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We will create a table to store the maximum value that can be obtained with the given weights and backpack capacity.\n\nLet's create a table dp[i][j], where i represents the number of items considered, and j represents the capacity of the backpack. The value of dp[i][j] will be the maximum weight that can be obtained considering the first i items and a backpack capacity of j.\n\nFirst, initialize the table with all 0s, with dimensions (number of items + 1) x (backpack capacity + 1). In this case, it will be a 6x16 table.\n\nNow, fill the table using the following rules:\n1. If i = 0 or j = 0, dp[i][j] = 0 (no items or no capacity)\n2. If the weight of the ith item (weights[i-1]) is less than or equal to j (backpack capacity), then dp[i][j] = max(value obtained by including the ith item, value obtained by not including the ith item)\n   In this case, dp[i][j] = max(weights[i-1] + dp[i-1][j-weights[i-1]], dp[i-1][j])\n3. If the weight of the ith item (weights[i-1]) is greater than j (backpack capacity), then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] (do not include the ith item)\n\nAfter filling the table, the value at dp[number of items][backpack capacity] will be the maximum weight that can be obtained. In this case, it will be dp[5][15].\n\nHere's the filled table for the given problem:\n\n   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n1  0  0  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2\n2  0  0  2  2  4  4  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6\n3  0  0  2  2  4  4  6  6  8  8 10 10 12 12 12 12\n4  0  0  2  2  4  4  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 14\n5  0  0  2  2  4  4  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n\nThe maximum weight the student can pack in their backpack is 15 kg (dp[5][15])."
