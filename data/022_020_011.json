    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution u(x, y) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y:\n\nu(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the given partial differential equation as:\n\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0\n\nNow, divide both sides by X(x)Y(y):\n\nX''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y) = 0\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -λ\nY''(y)/Y(y) = λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λX(x) = 0\nY''(y) - λY(y) = 0\n\nWe can solve these equations using the characteristic equation method. For the X(x) equation, the characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 + λ = 0\n\nThe roots of this equation are r = ±√(-λ). Depending on the value of λ, we have three cases:\n\n1. λ > 0: In this case, the general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(√λx) + B*sin(√λx)\n\n2. λ = 0: In this case, the general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = Ax + B\n\n3. λ < 0: In this case, the general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A*cosh(√(-λ)x) + B*sinh(√(-λ)x)\n\nSimilarly, for the Y(y) equation, the characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 - λ = 0\n\nThe roots of this equation are r = ±√λ. Depending on the value of λ, we have three cases:\n\n1. λ > 0: In this case, the general solution for Y(y) is:\n\nY(y) = C*cosh(√λy) + D*sinh(√λy)\n\n2. λ = 0: In this case, the general solution for Y(y) is:\n\nY(y) = Cy + D\n\n3. λ < 0: In this case, the general solution for Y(y) is:\n\nY(y) = C*cos(√(-λ)y) + D*sin(√(-λ)y)\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions to find the appropriate λ and the coefficients A, B, C, and D. Since the boundary condition is given on the boundary of the region D, we have:\n\nu(x, y) = x^2 - y^2, on x^2 + y^2 = 1 and x^2 + y^2 = 4\n\nApplying the boundary conditions and using the trigonometric and hyperbolic identities, we can find the appropriate λ and the coefficients A, B, C, and D. After finding these values, we can write the solution u(x, y) as:\n\nu(x, y) = (X(x)Y(y))|_{boundary}\n\nThis will give us the solution to the given boundary value problem."
