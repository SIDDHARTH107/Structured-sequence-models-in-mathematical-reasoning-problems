    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x=1 to x=9, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we'll square the derivative and add 1:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = (3/2)^2 * x\n1 + (dy/dx)^2 = 1 + (9/4)x\n\nNext, we'll find the square root of the expression:\n\nsqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) = sqrt(1 + (9/4)x)\n\nNow, we can plug this expression into the arc length formula and evaluate the integral from x=1 to x=9:\n\nL = ∫[1, 9] sqrt(1 + (9/4)x) dx\n\nThis integral is a bit difficult to solve analytically, so we can use numerical methods (such as Simpson's rule or a computer software) to approximate the value of the integral.\n\nUsing a numerical method, we find that:\n\nL ≈ 15.5425\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x=1 to x=9 is approximately 15.5425."
