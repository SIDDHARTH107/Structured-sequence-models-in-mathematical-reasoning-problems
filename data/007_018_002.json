    "message_2": "A prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest prime gap between two consecutive primes greater than 100,000, we need to find the first pair of primes that are closest together beyond 100,000.\n\nUsing a prime number calculator or programming tool, we can find the following consecutive prime numbers:\n\n100,300 and 100,313\n\nThe difference between these two prime numbers is:\n\n100,313 - 100,300 = 13\n\nTherefore, the smallest prime gap between two consecutive primes greater than 100,000 is 13."
