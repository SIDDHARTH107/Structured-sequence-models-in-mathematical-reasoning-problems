Determine the possible group structures based on the prime factorization.\n\nFor each prime factor p^k, we can have the following possibilities:\n\nFor 2^3:\n- One group of order 8 (C_8)\n- Two groups of order 4 (C_4 x C_2)\n\nFor 3^1:\n- One group of order 3 (C_3)\n\n3. Combine the possible structures and determine the number of non-isomorphic groups.\n\nWe can have the following combinations:\n\n- C_8 x C_3: One non-isomorphic group\n- (C_4 x C_2) x C_3: Two non-isomorphic groups (C_4 x C_6 and C_2 x C_12)\n\nSo, there are 1 + 2 = 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 24."
