    "message_2": "Unfortunately, I cannot see the graph you are referring to. However, I can explain the steps to solve the problem using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. Once you provide the graph or the capacities of the edges, I can help you find the maximum flow from node A to node J.\n\nThe Edmonds-Karp algorithm is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method, which is used to find the maximum flow in a flow network. The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Initialize the flow in all edges to 0.\n2. Find an augmenting path in the residual graph using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The residual graph is a graph that shows the remaining capacity of each edge after considering the current flow.\n3. If there is no augmenting path, the algorithm terminates, and the current flow is the maximum flow.\n4. Otherwise, find the bottleneck capacity along the augmenting path, which is the minimum capacity of the edges in the path.\n5. Update the flow along the augmenting path by adding the bottleneck capacity to the flow of each edge in the path.\n6. Update the residual graph and go back to step 2.\n\nPlease provide the graph or the capacities of the edges, and I will help you find the maximum flow from node A to node J using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm."
