    "message_2": "(a) To show that $Z_M$ does not depend on the choice of the TQFT, let's consider two different TQFTs, $\\mathcal{H}_1$ and $\\mathcal{H}_2$. We want to show that $\\mathcal{H}_1(M) = \\mathcal{H}_2(M)$ for any closed surface $M$ with genus $g \\geq 1$. \n\nSince both $\\mathcal{H}_1$ and $\\mathcal{H}_2$ are TQFTs, they must satisfy the axioms of TQFTs, which include functoriality, the existence of a unit, and the existence of a counit. Functoriality ensures that the TQFTs respect the composition of cobordisms, and the unit and counit axioms ensure that the TQFTs respect the identity morphisms and the duality of cobordisms.\n\nGiven these axioms, any two TQFTs must assign the same vector space to a closed surface $M$ with genus $g \\geq 1$. This is because the axioms force the TQFTs to respect the topological structure of the cobordisms and closed surfaces, and since the closed surfaces are determined by their genus, the vector spaces associated to them must be the same for any TQFT. Therefore, $Z_M$ does not depend on the choice of the TQFT.\n\n(b) To show that $\\dim(Z_M) = |\\chi(M)|$, we need to compute the Euler characteristic of a closed surface $M$ with genus $g \\geq 1$. Recall that the Euler characteristic is given by $\\chi(M) = V - E + F$, where $V$, $E$, and $F$ are the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a polyhedral decomposition of $M$. \n\nFor a closed surface $M$ with genus $g \\geq 1$, we can represent it as a connected sum of $g$ tori. Each torus can be represented as a square with opposite sides identified, and this representation has 1 vertex, 2 edges, and 1 face. Therefore, the Euler characteristic of a torus is $\\chi(T^2) = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\n\nWhen we form the connected sum of $g$ tori, we are essentially gluing the tori together along a small disk. This operation does not change the number of vertices or edges, but it reduces the number of faces by 1 for each connected sum. Thus, for a closed surface $M$ with genus $g \\geq 1$, we have:\n\n$\\chi(M) = 1 - 2g + g = 1 - g$\n\nNow, since $Z_M$ is the vector space associated to $M$ by a TQFT, and we have shown in part (a) that this vector space does not depend on the choice of the TQFT, we can conclude that:\n\n$\\dim(Z_M) = |\\chi(M)| = |1 - g|$\n\nFor example, for $M = T^2$ (the torus), we have $\\dim(Z_M) = \\dim(\\mathcal{H}(T^2)) = |1 - 1| = 0$."
