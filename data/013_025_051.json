    "message_1": "Two travelers have checked identical bags at an airport. The bags are valuable and they're willing to pay to have them back. They separately try to convince the airline to compensate them for the lost bags. The airline knows that the bags are identical and therefore can't tell which traveler's belongs to whom. The airline offers $100 to each traveler if neither of them demands more than $150. If one traveler demands more than $150, the other traveler will receive nothing and the airline will give the demanding traveler $150. If both demand more than $150, their compensation will be based on the lowest demand which both demanded. What amount should each traveler ask for to maximize their compensation?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation using game theory. We have two travelers, A and B, and they have the following options:\n\n1. Both demand $150 or less: Both receive $100.\n2. A demands more than $150, B demands $150 or less: A receives $150, B receives $0.\n3. B demands more than $150, A demands $150 or less: B receives $150, A receives $0.\n4. Both demand more than $150: Both receive the lowest demand which both demanded.\n\nIn this situation, both travelers should try to maximize their compensation. If both demand $150 or less, they will receive $100 each. However, if one of them demands more than $150, they have the chance to receive $150, while the other receives nothing. \n\nSince both travelers are rational and want to maximize their compensation, they will both choose to demand more than $150. In this case, the compensation will be based on the lowest demand which both demanded. To maximize their compensation, both travelers should demand just above $150 (e.g., $150.01) to ensure that they receive the highest possible compensation without risking getting nothing.\n\nSo, each traveler should ask for just above $150 to maximize their compensation."
