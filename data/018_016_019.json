    "message_1": "Suppose set A has 3 elements and set B has 4 elements. Find the cardinality of A x B and the cardinality of B x A, then show that the union of A x B and B x A is not equal.",
    "message_2": "The cardinality of a Cartesian product of two sets is the product of the cardinalities of the sets. So, the cardinality of A x B is |A| * |B| = 3 * 4 = 12, and the cardinality of B x A is |B| * |A| = 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow let's consider the union of A x B and B x A. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either of the sets. In this case, the elements of A x B are ordered pairs of the form (a, b) where a is from set A and b is from set B. Similarly, the elements of B x A are ordered pairs of the form (b, a) where b is from set B and a is from set A.\n\nSince the elements of A x B and B x A have different orders, they are not equal. For example, if we have a set A = {1, 2, 3} and set B = {4, 5, 6, 7}, the ordered pair (1, 4) is in A x B, but not in B x A. Similarly, the ordered pair (4, 1) is in B x A, but not in A x B.\n\nTherefore, the union of A x B and B x A is not equal to either A x B or B x A, as the union will contain elements from both sets, and the elements in each set have different orders."
