    "message_2": "We will use the Poincaré-Hopf theorem to solve this problem. The Poincaré-Hopf theorem states that for a smooth vector field $X$ on a compact, oriented, smooth manifold $M$ with boundary, the sum of the indices of the zeros of $X$ is equal to the Euler characteristic of $M$.\n\nLet $X$ be the gradient vector field of the function $f$, i.e., $X = \\nabla f$. The critical points of $f$ correspond to the zeros of the gradient vector field $X$. Since $S^2$ is a compact, oriented, smooth manifold without boundary, we can apply the Poincaré-Hopf theorem.\n\nThe Euler characteristic of the sphere $S^2$ is 2. Therefore, the sum of the indices of the critical points of $f$ on $S^2$ is 2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible indices of the critical points of $f$. Since no critical point of $f$ has a value that lies between 3 and 6, we can divide the critical points into two groups:\n\n1. Critical points with $f(x) \\leq 3$: These critical points can have index +1 (local minima) or -1 (saddle points).\n\n2. Critical points with $f(x) \\geq 6$: These critical points can have index +1 (saddle points) or -1 (local maxima).\n\nIn order to satisfy the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, we need at least one critical point with index +1 and one critical point with index -1. Therefore, there must be at least two critical points of $f$ on the sphere $S^2$."
