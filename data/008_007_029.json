    "message_2": "To find a matrix S such that S^(-1)AS is diagonal, we need to diagonalize matrix A. We will first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.\n\nMatrix A = [[2, 3], [-1, 4]]\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues (λ) by solving the characteristic equation: det(A - λI) = 0\n   det([[2 - λ, 3], [-1, 4 - λ]]) = (2 - λ)(4 - λ) - (-1) * 3 = 0\n   λ^2 - 6λ + 5 = 0\n   (λ - 1)(λ - 5) = 0\n   λ1 = 1, λ2 = 5\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue:\n\nFor λ1 = 1:\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n([[1, 3], [-1, 3]])v1 = 0\nv1 = [3, 1]\n\nFor λ2 = 5:\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n([[-3, 3], [-1, -1]])v2 = 0\nv2 = [1, -1]\n\n3. Form the matrix S using the eigenvectors as columns:\nS = [[3, 1], [1, -1]]\n\nNow, we have found the matrix S such that S^(-1)AS is diagonal."
