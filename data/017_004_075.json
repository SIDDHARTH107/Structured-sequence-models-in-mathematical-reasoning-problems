    "message_2": "To show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. If a group G has order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer, then G has a subgroup of order p^i for each i, 0 ≤ i ≤ n.\n2. If a group G has order p^2, where p is a prime number, then G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n\nSince G has order 9, which is 3^2, we can apply these facts to G.\n\nFirst, we will show that G has an element of order 3. By fact 1, G has a subgroup H of order 3. Since the order of H is prime, H must be cyclic, so H is generated by an element a with order 3. Thus, G has an element of order 3.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 9.\nIf G has an element of order 9, then G is cyclic, generated by that element. In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 9.\n\nCase 2: G does not have an element of order 9.\nIn this case, every non-identity element of G must have order 3, since the order of an element must divide the order of the group. Let a and b be two distinct non-identity elements of G. Since both a and b have order 3, their cyclic subgroups generated by them, <a> and <b>, have order 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the set H = {ab : a ∈ <a>, b ∈ <b>}. We will show that H is a subgroup of G. Since the identity element e is in both <a> and <b>, e = aa = bb is in H. If x = ab and y = a'b' are in H, then xy = ab(a'b') = a(ba')b' is also in H, since ba' is in <a> or <b> (as the order of a and b is 3). Finally, if x = ab is in H, then x^(-1) = (ab)^(-1) = b^(-1)a^(-1) is also in H, since a^(-1) is in <a> and b^(-1) is in <b>. Thus, H is a subgroup of G.\n\nSince H has 3 * 3 = 9 elements, and G has order 9, H = G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3, as <a> and <b> are cyclic groups of order 3.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3."
