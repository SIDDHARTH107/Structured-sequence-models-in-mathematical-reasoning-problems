    "message_1": "A math student wants to cluster a dataset of 20 points into three distinct groups. The student decides to use the k-means clustering algorithm. After running the algorithm, the student finds that the sum of squared distances between the points and their respective cluster centers is 150. What is the average of the sum of squared distances within each cluster?",
    "message_2": "To find the average of the sum of squared distances within each cluster, we need to divide the total sum of squared distances by the number of clusters.\n\nTotal sum of squared distances = 150\nNumber of clusters = 3\n\nAverage of the sum of squared distances within each cluster = (Total sum of squared distances) / (Number of clusters) = 150 / 3 = 50.\n\nSo, the average of the sum of squared distances within each cluster is 50."
