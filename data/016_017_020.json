    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon curve is a fractal that is created by iteratively folding a strip of paper in half, and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The total length of the curve at each stage can be found using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Segment Length * 2^(Stage Number)\n\nIn this case, the initial segment has a length of 1, and we want to find the total length at stage 10.\n\nLength = 1 * 2^(10) = 1 * 1024 = 1024\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway Dragon curve at stage 10 is 1024."
