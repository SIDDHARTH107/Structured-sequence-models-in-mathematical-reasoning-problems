    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we first find the prime factorization of 120. We have 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5. Now, we use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is given by:\n\nn(G) = (p^(k-1) * (p-1)) * (q^(l-1) * (q-1)) * (r^(m-1) * (r-1)) * ...\n\nwhere G is the group of order n, p, q, r are distinct prime factors of n, and k, l, m are the highest powers of the respective prime factors dividing n.\n\nFor our case, we have:\n\nn(G) = (2^(3-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(1-1) * (3-1)) * (5^(1-1) * (5-1))\nn(G) = (2^2 * 1) * (3^0 * 2) * (5^0 * 4)\nn(G) = (4) * (2) * (4)\nn(G) = 32\n\nSo there are 32 non-isomorphic groups of order 120.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many of them are non-abelian. We know that all cyclic groups of order 120 are abelian. There is only one cyclic group of order 120, which is the group Z_120. \n\nTo find the number of abelian groups, we use the fact that the number of abelian groups of order n is equal to the number of partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization of n. In our case, the exponents are 3, 1, and 1. The partitions of these exponents are:\n\n(3), (2, 1), and (1, 1, 1)\n\nThere are 3 partitions, which means there are 3 abelian groups of order 120. Since there are 32 non-isomorphic groups of order 120 in total, the number of non-abelian groups is:\n\n32 - 3 = 29\n\nSo there are 29 non-abelian groups of order 120."
