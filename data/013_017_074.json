    "message_1": "Consider a used car market where there are two types of cars: high-quality cars worth $10,000 with probability 0.6 and low-quality cars worth $3,000 with probability 0.4. Buyers value a high-quality car at $9,000 and a low-quality car at $2,000. The seller knows the type of car being sold, but the buyer does not. What is the probability that a car offered for sale is a high-quality car if the seller asks for a price of $7,000?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that:\n\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability that a car is high-quality (A) given that the seller asks for a price of $7,000 (B). We can break this down into the following probabilities:\n\nP(A) = Probability of a high-quality car = 0.6\nP(B|A) = Probability of the seller asking for $7,000 given that the car is high-quality\n\nTo find P(B|A), we need to consider the seller's incentives. Since the seller knows the type of car being sold, they will try to maximize their profit. If the seller has a high-quality car, they know that the buyer values it at $9,000. Therefore, they would not ask for a price lower than $9,000. Similarly, if the seller has a low-quality car, they know that the buyer values it at $2,000, so they would not ask for a price higher than $2,000. Thus, P(B|A) = 0, as the seller would not ask for $7,000 for a high-quality car.\n\nSince P(B|A) = 0, the probability that a car offered for sale is a high-quality car if the seller asks for a price of $7,000 is also 0."
