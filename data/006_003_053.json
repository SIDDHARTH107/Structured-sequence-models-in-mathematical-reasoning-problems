    "message_1": "A standard deck of cards contains 52 cards with four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. What is the probability of drawing an ace of spades from a well-shuffled deck of cards?",
    "message_2": "There is only 1 ace of spades in a standard deck of 52 cards. To find the probability of drawing the ace of spades, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (drawing the ace of spades), and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (total number of cards in the deck).\n\nProbability = 1/52 â‰ˆ 0.01923\n\nSo, the probability of drawing an ace of spades from a well-shuffled deck of cards is approximately 0.01923 or 1.923%."
