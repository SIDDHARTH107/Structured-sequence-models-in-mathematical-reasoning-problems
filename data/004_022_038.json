The material for the base costs $1 per square inch, and the material for the four sides costs $0.50 per square inch. Find the dimensions of the box such that the cost of the materials used is minimized.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square base and y be the height of the box. The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = x^2 * y = 400\n\nWe need to minimize the cost of the materials used, which is the sum of the cost of the base and the cost of the four sides. The cost function is given by:\n\nC(x, y) = x^2 * $1 + 4 * x * y * $0.50\n\nWe can rewrite the cost function as:\n\nC(x, y) = x^2 + 2xy\n\nNow, we need to express y in terms of x using the volume equation:\n\ny = 400 / x^2\n\nSubstitute this expression for y into the cost function:\n\nC(x) = x^2 + 2x(400 / x^2)\n\nSimplify the cost function:\n\nC(x) = x^2 + 800 / x\n\nTo minimize the cost function, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of C(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nC'(x) = 2x - 800 / x^2\n\n2x - 800 / x^2 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by x^2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n2x^3 - 800 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx^3 = 400\n\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\nx = 4∛(25)\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny = 400 / (4∛(25))^2\n\ny = 400 / (4∛(625))\n\ny = 4∛(25)\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that minimize the cost of materials are x = 4∛(25) inches for the side length of the square base and y = 4∛(25) inches for the height."
