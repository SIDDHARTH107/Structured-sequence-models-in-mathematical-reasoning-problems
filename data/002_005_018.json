    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, width of 5 cm and height of 6 cm. What is the length of its longest diagonal?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the longest diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nIn this case, the length is 8 cm, the width is 5 cm, and the height is 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiagonal length = √(8² + 5² + 6²) = √(64 + 25 + 36) = √125\n\nThe length of the longest diagonal is √125 cm, which is approximately 11.18 cm."
