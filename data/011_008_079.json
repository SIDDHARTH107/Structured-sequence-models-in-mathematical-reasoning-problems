    "message_1": "How many ways are there to arrange 5 red balls and 3 white balls in a straight line if all the red balls should be adjacent to one another?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can think of the 5 red balls as a single entity, which we'll call R. So now we have 1 R and 3 white balls (W). We need to arrange these 4 entities (R, W, W, W) in a straight line.\n\nThere are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange these 4 entities:\n\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n\nSo there are 24 ways to arrange the 5 red balls and 3 white balls in a straight line with all the red balls adjacent to one another."
