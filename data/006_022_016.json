    "message_1": "Suppose a certain school has 500 students, out of which 350 students passed their math exam, 150 passed their science exam, and 100 passed both exams. What is the probability that a randomly selected student from this school passed at least one exam?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected student passed at least one exam, we first need to find the total number of students who passed at least one exam. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.\n\nThe number of students who passed at least one exam is equal to the sum of the number of students who passed the math exam and the number of students who passed the science exam, minus the number of students who passed both exams (since we don't want to double-count these students).\n\nSo, the number of students who passed at least one exam is:\n\n350 (passed math) + 150 (passed science) - 100 (passed both) = 400 students\n\nNow, we can find the probability that a randomly selected student passed at least one exam by dividing the number of students who passed at least one exam by the total number of students:\n\nProbability = (Number of students who passed at least one exam) / (Total number of students)\nProbability = 400 / 500\nProbability = 0.8 or 80%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student from this school passed at least one exam is 80%."
