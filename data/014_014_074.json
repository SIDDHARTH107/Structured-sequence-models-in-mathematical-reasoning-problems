    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\", we first need to create a 5x5 Playfair square using the key.\n\n1. Remove any duplicate letters from the key and write the remaining letters from left to right, top to bottom in a 5x5 grid.\n2. Fill in the remaining spaces in the grid with the rest of the alphabet, excluding the letter 'J' (since 'I' and 'J' are considered the same in the Playfair cipher).\n\nThe resulting Playfair square is:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we can encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using the following rules:\n\n1. If both letters are the same, add an 'X' between them. In this case, we have \"HELXLO WORLD\".\n2. If the letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the letter to its right (wrapping around if necessary). If they are in the same column, replace each letter with the letter below it (again, wrapping around if necessary).\n3. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the letter in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle.\n\nApplying these rules, we get the following ciphertext:\n\nH -> S, E -> F, L -> L, X -> X, L -> L, O -> O, W -> Y, O -> O, R -> R, L -> L, D -> E\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"SFLLXLOOYRLE\"."
