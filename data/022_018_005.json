    "message_2": "To find the harmonic conjugate of the given function, we need to find a function $v(x, y)$ such that $f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$ is an analytic function. The Cauchy-Riemann equations must be satisfied for $f(z)$ to be analytic. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$\n\nGiven the partial differential equation $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\overline{z}} = z$, we can rewrite it in terms of $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = x - iy$\n\nComparing the real and imaginary parts, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = x$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -y$\n\nNow, we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to find $v(x, y)$:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = x$\n2. $-\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = -y$\n\nIntegrating the first equation with respect to $y$, we get:\n\n$v(x, y) = xy + g(x)$, where $g(x)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$.\n\nNow, differentiating $v(x, y)$ with respect to $x$ and using the second equation, we get:\n\n$-\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = -y = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(xy + g(x))$\n\n$-y = -y - g'(x)$\n\nComparing the coefficients, we get $g'(x) = 0$. Thus, $g(x)$ is a constant, say $C$.\n\nSo, the harmonic conjugate of $u(x, y)$ is:\n\n$v(x, y) = xy + C$\n\nThe function $f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$ is analytic, and $v(x, y)$ is the harmonic conjugate of $u(x, y)$."
