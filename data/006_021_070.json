    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, rainy days) in a fixed interval (in this case, a month) when the events occur independently and at an average rate of λ events per interval.\n\nIn this problem, λ = 5 (the average number of rainy days per month).\n\nThe probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (rainy days), k is the desired number of events (3 rainy days), e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 3) = (e^(-5) * 5^3) / 3!\n\nP(X = 3) = (0.0067 * 125) / 6\n\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.1404\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain on exactly 3 days in the next month is approximately 14.04%."
