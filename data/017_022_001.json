    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways a group of order 60 can be isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, we first need to understand the structure of these non-abelian groups.\n\nA group of order 60 has the form G = P x Q, where P and Q are Sylow subgroups of G. The Sylow theorems tell us that the number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order 60 is congruent to 1 mod p and divides 60. \n\nFor a group of order 60, we have the prime factorization 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. Thus, we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow p-subgroups:\n\n- n_2 (number of Sylow 2-subgroups) ∈ {1, 3, 5, 15}\n- n_3 (number of Sylow 3-subgroups) ∈ {1, 4, 10}\n- n_5 (number of Sylow 5-subgroups) ∈ {1, 6, 12}\n\nNow, we need to consider the non-abelian groups. A group is non-abelian if it is not commutative, meaning that there exists at least one pair of elements (a, b) in the group such that ab ≠ ba.\n\nFor a group of order 60 to be non-abelian, at least one of its Sylow subgroups must be non-abelian. The only Sylow subgroups that can be non-abelian are those of order 4 (Sylow 2-subgroups), since the Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups have prime order and are thus cyclic and abelian.\n\nThere are two non-abelian groups of order 4: the dihedral group D_4 and the quaternion group Q_8. However, the quaternion group cannot be a Sylow 2-subgroup of a group of order 60, as it would force the group to have a normal 5-subgroup, which would make the group abelian. Therefore, the non-abelian Sylow 2-subgroup must be isomorphic to D_4.\n\nNow, we need to consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups that can form non-abelian groups of order 60. We have the following cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1: In this case, there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, each isomorphic to D_4. The Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup are unique and normal in G. The group G can be constructed as the semidirect product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup, with the action of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the product. There are 2 possible actions for each Sylow 2-subgroup, giving a total of 2^3 = 8 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n2. n_2 = 5, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1: In this case, there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, each isomorphic to D_4. The Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup are unique and normal in G. The group G can be constructed as the semidirect product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup, with the action of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the product. There are 2 possible actions for each Sylow 2-subgroup, giving a total of 2^5 = 32 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted some isomorphic groups, as there are some groups that can be constructed in both cases. To correct for this overcounting, we need to subtract the number of groups that can be constructed in both cases. There are 4 such groups, corresponding to the 4 possible actions of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup that can be realized in both cases.\n\nThus, the total number of non-abelian groups of order 60 is 8 + 32 - 4 = 36.\n\nHowever, this includes 4 groups that are isomorphic to the alternating group A_5, which is a simple group and not isomorphic to any of the other non-abelian groups of order 60. Therefore, the number of ways a group of order 60 can be isomorphic to one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60 (excluding A_5) is 36 - 4 = 32."
