    "message_1": "Consider linear logic with two resources, A and B. If we have 3 copies of resource A and 2 copies of resource B, how many ways can we use all the resources?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways to use all the resources, we can think of this as a permutation problem. We have a total of 5 resources (3 copies of A and 2 copies of B). We want to arrange these resources in a sequence.\n\nThe number of permutations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nn! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of resources, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the number of each type of resource.\n\nIn this case, n = 5 (3 copies of A and 2 copies of B), n1 = 3 (number of A resources), and n2 = 2 (number of B resources).\n\nSo the number of permutations is:\n\n5! / (3! * 2!) = 120 / (6 * 2) = 120 / 12 = 10\n\nThere are 10 different ways to use all the resources."
