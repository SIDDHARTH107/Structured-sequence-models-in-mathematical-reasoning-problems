    "message_1": "A certain type of machine has a 3% chance of failing in any given hour. What is the probability that the machine will fail at least once in a 12-hour shift?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the machine will fail at least once in a 12-hour shift, we can first find the probability that the machine will not fail at all during the shift, and then subtract that probability from 1.\n\nThe probability that the machine will not fail in any given hour is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.\n\nFor the machine to not fail at all during a 12-hour shift, it must not fail in each of the 12 hours. The probability of this happening is the product of the probabilities of not failing in each hour:\n\n0.97^12 ≈ 0.6394\n\nNow, to find the probability that the machine will fail at least once during the 12-hour shift, we subtract the probability of not failing at all from 1:\n\n1 - 0.6394 ≈ 0.3606\n\nSo, the probability that the machine will fail at least once in a 12-hour shift is approximately 36.06%."
