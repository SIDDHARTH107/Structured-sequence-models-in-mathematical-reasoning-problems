Label the x and y-intercepts, the maximum and minimum points, and the points where the function intersects the x-axis.",
    "message_2": "To graph the function y = 2sin(3x) in the interval [0, 2π], we'll first identify the key features of the graph, such as amplitude, period, and phase shift.\n\nAmplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function, which in this case is 2. This means the graph will oscillate between -2 and 2.\n\nPeriod (T): The period of the sine function is 2π divided by the absolute value of the coefficient of x, which in this case is 3. So, the period T = 2π/3.\n\nPhase Shift: There is no phase shift in this function since there is no constant added or subtracted inside the sine function.\n\nNow, let's find the x and y-intercepts, maximum and minimum points, and the points where the function intersects the x-axis.\n\n1. X-intercepts: To find the x-intercepts, we set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = 2sin(3x)\nsin(3x) = 0\n\nThe sine function is 0 at integer multiples of π. So, 3x = nπ, where n is an integer. Therefore, x = nπ/3. In the interval [0, 2π], the x-intercepts are x = 0, π/3, 2π/3, π, 4π/3, 5π/3, and 2π.\n\n2. Y-intercept: To find the y-intercept, we set x = 0.\n\ny = 2sin(3(0))\ny = 2sin(0)\ny = 0\n\nThe y-intercept is at the point (0, 0).\n\n3. Maximum and minimum points: The maximum value of the sine function is 1, and the minimum value is -1. Since the amplitude is 2, the maximum value of the function is 2(1) = 2, and the minimum value is 2(-1) = -2. \n\nThe maximum points occur when sin(3x) = 1, which means 3x = (2n + 1)π/2, where n is an integer. So, x = [(2n + 1)π/2]/3. In the interval [0, 2π], the maximum points are x = π/6 and x = 7π/6. The maximum points are (π/6, 2) and (7π/6, 2).\n\nThe minimum points occur when sin(3x) = -1, which means 3x = (2n - 1)π/2, where n is an integer. So, x = [(2n - 1)π/2]/3. In the interval [0, 2π], the minimum points are x = 5π/6 and x = 11π/6. The minimum points are (5π/6, -2) and (11π/6, -2).\n\nNow, we can graph the function y = 2sin(3x) in the interval [0, 2π] with the identified features:\n\n- Amplitude: 2\n- Period: 2π/3\n- X-intercepts: 0, π/3, 2π/3, π, 4π/3, 5π/3, and 2π\n- Y-intercept: (0, 0)\n- Maximum points: (π/6, 2) and (7π/6, 2)\n- Minimum points: (5π/6, -2) and (11π/6, -2)"
