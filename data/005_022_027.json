The results of the test were as follows:\n\n50, 70, 60, 62, 65, 80, 85, 90, 88, 55, 75, 68, 70, 85, 80, 75, 100, 78, 79, 40.\n\nCalculate the median and median absolute deviation (MAD) of this data set using the robust statistics method.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the data in ascending order:\n\n40, 50, 55, 60, 62, 65, 68, 70, 70, 75, 75, 78, 79, 80, 80, 85, 85, 88, 90, 100\n\nTo find the median, we need to find the middle value(s) of the data set. Since there are 20 values (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values (10th and 11th values):\n\nMedian = (75 + 75) / 2 = 150 / 2 = 75\n\nNow, we need to calculate the median absolute deviation (MAD). To do this, we first find the absolute deviation of each value from the median:\n\n10, 25, 20, 15, 13, 10, 7, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 4, 5, 5, 10, 10, 13, 15, 25\n\nNext, we arrange the absolute deviations in ascending order:\n\n0, 0, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 10, 10, 10, 13, 13, 15, 15, 20, 25, 25, 25\n\nSince there are 20 values, the median absolute deviation (MAD) will be the average of the two middle values (10th and 11th values):\n\nMAD = (10 + 10) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10\n\nSo, the median of the data set is 75, and the median absolute deviation (MAD) is 10."
