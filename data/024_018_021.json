    "message_1": "A saddle-shaped surface has sectional curvature K at a point P equal to -1.2. If two geodesics that start at P are orthogonal and have lengths of 4 units and 6 units, what is the angle between them when they meet again after traveling along their respective geodesics? Round your answer to the nearest degree.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the two geodesics as g1 and g2, and their lengths as L1 = 4 units and L2 = 6 units, respectively. Since the geodesics start at point P and are orthogonal, the angle between them at P is 90 degrees.\n\nThe geodesic curvature, k_g, is related to the sectional curvature, K, by the formula:\n\nk_g = sqrt(-K)\n\nIn this case, K = -1.2, so:\n\nk_g = sqrt(1.2)\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the angle between two geodesics after they have traveled along their respective lengths:\n\nangle = k_g * L1 * L2\n\nangle = sqrt(1.2) * 4 * 6\n\nangle ≈ 8.37 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, we use the formula:\n\ndegrees = radians * (180 / pi)\n\nangle ≈ 8.37 * (180 / pi)\n\nangle ≈ 480 degrees\n\nHowever, we are interested in the angle between the geodesics when they meet again, which means we need to find the smallest positive angle that is equivalent to 480 degrees. Since angles are periodic with a period of 360 degrees, we can subtract 360 degrees from the angle until we get an angle between 0 and 360 degrees:\n\n480 - 360 = 120 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the two geodesics when they meet again after traveling along their respective geodesics is approximately 120 degrees."
