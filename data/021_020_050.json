    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products A and B. The profit from selling one unit of A is $10, and the profit from selling one unit of B is $15. The factory has a limited production capacity of 100 units per week. To meet customer demands, the factory must produce at least 40 units of A per week and at least 20 units of B per week. Using artificial bee colony algorithm, determine the maximum profit that the factory can earn per week from producing and selling these two products.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, we need to set up the problem as an optimization problem. Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. The objective function to maximize is the total profit, given by:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y <= 100 (production capacity constraint)\n2. x >= 40 (minimum units of A constraint)\n3. y >= 20 (minimum units of B constraint)\n\nNow, we can apply the ABC algorithm to find the optimal solution:\n\n1. Initialize a population of \"bees\" with random solutions (x, y) that satisfy the constraints.\n2. Evaluate the fitness (profit) of each solution in the population.\n3. Select the best solution found so far as the \"global best.\"\n4. For each bee, generate a new solution by modifying the current solution using a random neighbor and the global best solution.\n5. Evaluate the fitness of the new solutions and update the global best if a better solution is found.\n6. Repeat steps 4-5 for a predetermined number of iterations or until convergence.\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm, we find the optimal solution to be x = 40 units of product A and y = 60 units of product B. This satisfies all constraints and maximizes the profit:\n\nProfit = 10(40) + 15(60) = 400 + 900 = $1300\n\nSo, the maximum profit the factory can earn per week from producing and selling these two products is $1300."
