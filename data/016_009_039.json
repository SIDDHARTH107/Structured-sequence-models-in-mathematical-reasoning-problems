    "message_1": "Let the initial segment of the Dragon Curve be of length 1. If, at each iteration, the length of each new segment is halved and angled at 45 degrees to the previous segment, how long will the Dragon Curve be after 10 iterations?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the Dragon Curve after n iterations as L(n). After the first iteration, there will be two segments, each of length 1/2. So, L(1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the number of segments doubles, and the length of each new segment is half the length of the segments in the previous iteration. Therefore, the total length added in each iteration is equal to the total length of the previous iteration.\n\nSo, we can find the length of the Dragon Curve after 10 iterations using the following formula:\n\nL(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-1)\n\nSince L(1) = 1, we can find L(10) as follows:\n\nL(2) = L(1) + L(1) = 1 + 1 = 2\nL(3) = L(2) + L(2) = 2 + 2 = 4\nL(4) = L(3) + L(3) = 4 + 4 = 8\nL(5) = L(4) + L(4) = 8 + 8 = 16\nL(6) = L(5) + L(5) = 16 + 16 = 32\nL(7) = L(6) + L(6) = 32 + 32 = 64\nL(8) = L(7) + L(7) = 64 + 64 = 128\nL(9) = L(8) + L(8) = 128 + 128 = 256\nL(10) = L(9) + L(9) = 256 + 256 = 512\n\nSo, the length of the Dragon Curve after 10 iterations is 512."
