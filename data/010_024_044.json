    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hyperbolic polygon in hyperbolic geometry, we can use the following formula:\n\nArea = (n - 2π) * R^2\n\nwhere n is the number of sides of the polygon, R is the hyperbolic radius, and π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159).\n\nFirst, we need to find the hyperbolic radius R. We can use the formula for the side length of a regular hyperbolic polygon:\n\ncosh(R) = 1 / (cos(π/n) - 1)\n\nwhere n is the number of sides (7 in this case) and cosh is the hyperbolic cosine function. \n\ncos(π/7) = 0.6234898018587336\n1 / (0.6234898018587336 - 1) = 2.246979603717467\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse hyperbolic cosine (arcosh) of 2.246979603717467 to get the hyperbolic radius R:\n\narcosh(2.246979603717467) = 1.447078750260292\n\nNow that we have the hyperbolic radius R, we can find the area of the polygon:\n\nArea = (7 - 2π) * (1.447078750260292)^2\nArea = (7 - 6.28318) * 2.094395102393196\nArea ≈ 1.497 * 2.094\nArea ≈ 3.135\n\nSo, the area of the regular hyperbolic polygon with 7 sides and each side of length 4.5 in hyperbolic space is approximately 3.135 square units."
