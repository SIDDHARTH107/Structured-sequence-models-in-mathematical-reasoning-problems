    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created through a recursive process. With each iteration, the length of the curve increases. Specifically, the length of the curve doubles with each iteration.\n\nIf the first iteration starts with a line segment of length 1 unit, then after 10 iterations, the length of the curve will be:\n\nLength = Initial length * 2^(Number of iterations)\nLength = 1 * 2^10\nLength = 1 * 1024\nLength = 1024 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after 10 iterations is 1024 units."
