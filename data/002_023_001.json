    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius (r) is 7 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (7 cm)^2\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 49 cm^2\n\nSurface Area = 196π cm^2\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.14159, we get:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 196 * 3.14159 cm^2\n\nSurface Area ≈ 615.75236 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 615.75 square centimeters."
