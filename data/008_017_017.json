    "message_1": "A chemical plant produces three types of fertilizers A, B and C with respective costs of 25, 30, and 35 dollars per ton. To fulfill the requirements, a minimum of 8,000 tons of A, 9,000 tons of B, and 10,000 tons of C are required. The plant has a maximum monthly production capacity of 30,000 tons. The demand of A and B are 12,000 and 10,000 tons respectively, whereas the demand of C is unlimited. Use the sparse matrix method to determine the optimal quantity to produce of each fertilizer to minimize the cost while satisfying the requirements and demands.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x1, x2, and x3 represent the production quantities of fertilizers A, B, and C, respectively. We want to minimize the cost function:\n\nCost = 25x1 + 30x2 + 35x3\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Minimum production requirements:\nx1 >= 8000\nx2 >= 9000\nx3 >= 10000\n\n2. Maximum production capacity:\nx1 + x2 + x3 <= 30000\n\n3. Maximum demand for A and B:\nx1 <= 12000\nx2 <= 10000\n\nSince the demand for C is unlimited, there is no constraint for x3.\n\nWe can represent the constraints as a sparse matrix:\n\n```\n| 1  0  0 | | x1 |   |  8000 |\n| 0  1  0 | | x2 |   |  9000 |\n| 0  0  1 | | x3 |   | 10000 |\n| 1  1  1 | | x1 |   | 30000 |\n| 1  0  0 | | x2 |   | 12000 |\n| 0  1  0 | | x3 |   | 10000 |\n```\n\nNow, we can use a linear programming solver to find the optimal solution. There are various solvers available, such as the simplex method or interior point methods. For this problem, we will use the simplex method.\n\nAfter solving the linear programming problem using the simplex method, we get the optimal solution:\n\nx1 = 8000 tons of fertilizer A\nx2 = 10000 tons of fertilizer B\nx3 = 12000 tons of fertilizer C\n\nThe minimum cost is:\n\nCost = 25(8000) + 30(10000) + 35(12000) = $1,190,000"
