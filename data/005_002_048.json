    "message_1": "A car manufacturing company claims that their latest model can travel 500 kilometers on a full tank of gas. To test their claim, a group of researchers randomly selected 25 cars and measured the distance they travelled on a full tank of gas. The mean distance travelled was found to be 480 kilometers with a standard deviation of 30 kilometers. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean distance travelled by all the cars of this model.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean distance travelled by all the cars of this model, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence interval = Mean ± (t-score * (Standard deviation / √Sample size))\n\nIn this case, the mean distance travelled is 480 kilometers, the standard deviation is 30 kilometers, and the sample size is 25 cars. Since we are looking for a 95% confidence interval and the sample size is 25, we will use a t-score of 2.064 (which corresponds to a 95% confidence level and 24 degrees of freedom).\n\nConfidence interval = 480 ± (2.064 * (30 / √25))\n\nFirst, calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard error = 30 / √25 = 30 / 5 = 6\n\nNext, multiply the t-score by the standard error:\n\nMargin of error = 2.064 * 6 = 12.384\n\nFinally, calculate the confidence interval:\n\nLower limit = 480 - 12.384 = 467.616\nUpper limit = 480 + 12.384 = 492.384\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the mean distance travelled by all the cars of this model is approximately (467.616, 492.384) kilometers."
