    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student:\n\nIn a Prisoner's Dilemma game between two players, player A has two options: cooperate or defect, and player B has the same two options. If both players cooperate, each receives a payoff of 3. If both players defect, each receives a payoff of 1. If one player defects and the other cooperates, the defector receives a payoff of 5 and the cooperator receives a payoff of 0. \n\nSuppose player A knows that player B will cooperate with probability p. What should player A's strategy be to maximize their expected payoff, and what is their expected payoff in this case?",
    "message_2": "To find the best strategy for player A, we need to compare the expected payoffs for both options: cooperate and defect.\n\n1. If player A cooperates:\n- Player B cooperates with probability p, so the payoff is 3p.\n- Player B defects with probability (1-p), so the payoff is 0(1-p).\nThe total expected payoff for player A when cooperating is 3p.\n\n2. If player A defects:\n- Player B cooperates with probability p, so the payoff is 5p.\n- Player B defects with probability (1-p), so the payoff is 1(1-p).\nThe total expected payoff for player A when defecting is 5p + 1 - p.\n\nNow, we compare the expected payoffs for both options:\n- Cooperate: 3p\n- Defect: 5p + 1 - p\n\nTo maximize their expected payoff, player A should choose the option with the higher expected payoff. Since 5p + 1 - p > 3p, player A should always choose to defect, regardless of the value of p.\n\nThe expected payoff for player A when defecting is 5p + 1 - p = 4p + 1."
