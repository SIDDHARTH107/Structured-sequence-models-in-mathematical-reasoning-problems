    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate y from the second and third equations. Notice that the third equation is just twice the second equation, so we can subtract 2 times the second equation from the third equation:\n\n4x - 2y + 6z - 2(2x - y + 3z) = 0\n4x - 2y + 6z - 4x + 2y - 6z = 0\n0 = 0\n\nSince we got 0 = 0, it means that the third equation is dependent on the second equation and does not provide any new information. So, we can ignore the third equation and work with the first two equations:\n\nx + y - z = 0\n2x - y + 3z = 0\n\nNow, let's solve the first equation for y:\n\ny = z - x\n\nSubstitute this expression for y into the second equation:\n\n2x - (z - x) + 3z = 0\n2x - z + x + 3z = 0\n3x + 2z = 0\n\nNow, let's solve this equation for x:\n\nx = (-2/3)z\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = z - (-2/3)z\ny = z + (2/3)z\ny = (3/3)z + (2/3)z\ny = (5/3)z\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = (-2/3)z\ny = (5/3)z\n\nSince there is no unique solution for x, y, and z, the system has infinitely many solutions, and they are dependent on the value of z."
