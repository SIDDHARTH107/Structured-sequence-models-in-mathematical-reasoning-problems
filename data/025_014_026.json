    "message_2": "First, let's find all the points on the elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{F}_7$. We can do this by plugging in all possible values of $x$ and checking if the right-hand side of the equation is a quadratic residue modulo 7.\n\n1. For $x = 0$, we have $y^2 = -3x \\equiv 4x \\pmod{7}$. The possible values for $y$ are 2 and 5, so we have two points: $(0, 2)$ and $(0, 5)$.\n\n2. For $x = 1$, we have $y^2 = 1 + 3 - 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. The possible values for $y$ are 1 and 6, so we have two points: $(1, 1)$ and $(1, 6)$.\n\n3. For $x = 2$, we have $y^2 = 8 + 12 - 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. The possible values for $y$ are 1 and 6, so we have two points: $(2, 1)$ and $(2, 6)$.\n\n4. For $x = 3$, we have $y^2 = 27 + 27 - 9 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. There is no $y$ such that $y^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, so there are no points for $x = 3$.\n\n5. For $x = 4$, we have $y^2 = 64 + 48 - 12 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$. The possible values for $y$ are 2 and 5, so we have two points: $(4, 2)$ and $(4, 5)$.\n\n6. For $x = 5$, we have $y^2 = 125 + 75 - 15 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$. There is no $y$ such that $y^2 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$, so there are no points for $x = 5$.\n\n7. For $x = 6$, we have $y^2 = 216 + 108 - 18 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. The only value for $y$ is 0, so we have one point: $(6, 0)$.\n\nSo, the points on the elliptic curve are: $(0, 2)$, $(0, 5)$, $(1, 1)$, $(1, 6)$, $(2, 1)$, $(2, 6)$, $(4, 2)$, $(4, 5)$, and $(6, 0)$.\n\nNow, let's find the divisor of the function $\\theta_2(x+y)\\theta_2(x-y)$ on the curve. Recall that the divisor of a function on an elliptic curve is the formal sum of its zeros minus the sum of its poles.\n\nThe function $\\theta_2(x+y)\\theta_2(x-y)$ has zeros when $x+y$ or $x-y$ is a multiple of 2, and poles when $x+y$ or $x-y$ is a multiple of 7. We can check each point on the curve to see if it satisfies either of these conditions:\n\n1. $(0, 2)$: $x+y = 2$, $x-y = -2$. This point is a zero.\n2. $(0, 5)$: $x+y = 5$, $x-y = -5$. This point is neither a zero nor a pole.\n3. $(1, 1)$: $x+y = 2$, $x-y = 0$. This point is a zero.\n4. $(1, 6)$: $x+y = 7$, $x-y = -5$. This point is a pole.\n5. $(2, 1)$: $x+y = 3$, $x-y = 1$. This point is neither a zero nor a pole.\n6. $(2, 6)$: $x+y = 8$, $x-y = -4$. This point is a zero.\n7. $(4, 2)$: $x+y = 6$, $x-y = 2$. This point is a zero.\n8. $(4, 5)$: $x+y = 9$, $x-y = -1$. This point is neither a zero nor a pole.\n9. $(6, 0)$: $x+y = 6$, $x-y = 6$. This point is neither a zero nor a pole.\n\nThus, the divisor of the function $\\theta_2(x+y)\\theta_2(x-y)$ on the curve is $(0, 2) + (1, 1) + (2, 6) + (4, 2) - (1, 6)$."
