    "message_2": "To find the probability of finding the particle between x=1 and x=3 at time t=0, we need to calculate the integral of the square of the magnitude of the wave function over the given interval. The square of the magnitude of the wave function represents the probability density function.\n\nFirst, let's plug in t=0 into the wave function:\n\nψ(x,0) = (1/√2)*(e^(-x/3) - e^(x/3))\n\nNow, we need to find the square of the magnitude of ψ(x,0):\n\n|ψ(x,0)|^2 = (1/2)*(e^(-x/3) - e^(x/3))*(e^(-x/3) - e^(x/3))*\n\n*Note that we don't need to take the complex conjugate of ψ(x,0) since it has no imaginary part when t=0.\n\nExpanding the product, we get:\n\n|ψ(x,0)|^2 = (1/2)*(e^(-2x/3) - 2 + e^(2x/3))\n\nNow, we need to integrate |ψ(x,0)|^2 from x=1 to x=3:\n\nP(1 ≤ x ≤ 3) = ∫[|ψ(x,0)|^2 dx] from x=1 to x=3\n\nP(1 ≤ x ≤ 3) = (1/2) * ∫[e^(-2x/3) - 2 + e^(2x/3) dx] from x=1 to x=3\n\nTo solve this integral, we can integrate each term separately:\n\n∫[e^(-2x/3) dx] = (-3/2) * e^(-2x/3)\n∫[-2 dx] = -2x\n∫[e^(2x/3) dx] = (3/2) * e^(2x/3)\n\nNow, we can plug in the limits of integration:\n\nP(1 ≤ x ≤ 3) = (1/2) * [(-3/2) * e^(-2x/3) - 2x + (3/2) * e^(2x/3)] evaluated from x=1 to x=3\n\nP(1 ≤ x ≤ 3) = (1/2) * [((-3/2) * e^(-2*3/3) - 2*3 + (3/2) * e^(2*3/3)) - ((-3/2) * e^(-2*1/3) - 2*1 + (3/2) * e^(2*1/3))]\n\nP(1 ≤ x ≤ 3) = (1/2) * [((-3/2) * e^(-2) - 6 + (3/2) * e^(2)) - ((-3/2) * e^(-2/3) - 2 + (3/2) * e^(2/3))]\n\nP(1 ≤ x ≤ 3) ≈ 0.315\n\nSo, the probability of finding the particle between x=1 and x=3 at time t=0 is approximately 0.315 or 31.5%."
