    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set with 50 elements, and A be any subset of U with 30 elements. What is the cardinality of the union of A and its complement?",
    "message_2": "The complement of A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A. Since A has 30 elements, its complement A' has 20 elements (50 - 30 = 20).\n\nThe union of A and its complement A' is the set of all elements that are either in A or in A'. Since A and A' together contain all the elements of the universal set U, their union is equal to U.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the union of A and its complement is equal to the cardinality of the universal set U, which is 50 elements."
