    "message_2": "The probability of a burglary occurring in the neighborhood can be calculated by dividing the number of houses burglarized by the total number of houses in the neighborhood. In this case, historical data shows that 1 out of every 50 houses are burglarized each month. \n\nSo, the probability of a burglary occurring in the neighborhood is:\n\n1 (number of houses burglarized) / 50 (total number of houses) = 0.02\n\nTherefore, the probability of a burglary occurring in the neighborhood is 0.02 or 2%."
