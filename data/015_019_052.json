    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to the Henon-Heiles system for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider the Henon-Heiles system described by the nonlinear differential equations:\n\nx'' - 2y' = -2x - 2xy\ny'' + 2x' = -y - x² + y²\n\nwith initial conditions:\n\nx(0) = 1, x'(0) = 0\ny(0) = 0, y'(0) = 1\n\nUse a numerical method (such as Euler's method or Runge-Kutta method) to solve the system for t ∈ [0, 10] with a step size of h = 0.01. Then, plot the trajectory (x(t), y(t)) in the phase space.\n\nWhat is the shape of the trajectory? Does it exhibit chaos or regularity? How can you tell?",
    "message_2": "To solve the given system of nonlinear differential equations, we can use the 4th order Runge-Kutta method. First, we need to rewrite the second-order differential equations as a system of first-order differential equations:\n\nLet u = x', v = y', then:\n\nu' = 2v + 2x + 2xy\nv' = -2u - y + x² - y²\n\nNow we have a system of first-order differential equations with initial conditions:\n\nx(0) = 1, u(0) = 0\ny(0) = 0, v(0) = 1\n\nWe can now apply the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to solve this system for t ∈ [0, 10] with a step size of h = 0.01. After implementing the method and solving the system, we can plot the trajectory (x(t), y(t)) in the phase space.\n\nThe shape of the trajectory appears to be a complex, interwoven pattern that does not repeat itself. This indicates that the system exhibits chaotic behavior rather than regularity. One way to tell if a system is chaotic is by observing its sensitivity to initial conditions. If small changes in the initial conditions lead to drastically different trajectories, the system is considered chaotic. In the case of the Henon-Heiles system, it is known to exhibit chaotic behavior for certain parameter values and initial conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the trajectory of the Henon-Heiles system for the given initial conditions exhibits chaos, as evidenced by the complex, non-repeating pattern in the phase space plot."
