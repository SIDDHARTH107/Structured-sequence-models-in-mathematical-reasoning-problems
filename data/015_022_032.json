    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a delay differential equation given by:\n\ndx(t)/dt = (beta * x(t-tau)) / (1 + x(t-tau)^n) - gamma * x(t)\n\nwhere x(t) is the variable of interest, beta, gamma, tau, and n are parameters, and t is the time.\n\nTo find the maximum value of x(t) for a given set of parameters and initial condition x(0) = 1, we need to solve the equation numerically over the time span from 0 to 1000. The maximum value will depend on the specific values of beta, gamma, tau, and n.\n\nPlease provide the values of beta, gamma, tau, and n for which you want to find the maximum value of the Mackey-Glass equation."
