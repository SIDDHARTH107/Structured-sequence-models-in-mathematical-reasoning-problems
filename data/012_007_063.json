    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node A to node E using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, we will iteratively find augmenting paths and update the residual graph until no more augmenting paths can be found. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Initialize the flow in each edge to 0.\n\n2. Find an augmenting path in the residual graph. An augmenting path is a path from the source (A) to the sink (E) in which all edges have a residual capacity greater than 0. The residual capacity of an edge is the original capacity minus the current flow.\n\n3. Update the flow along the augmenting path by the minimum residual capacity found in the path.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\nStep 1: Initialize the flow in each edge to 0.\n\nStep 2: Find an augmenting path in the residual graph. One possible path is A -> B -> C -> E. The minimum residual capacity along this path is min(5, 4, 3) = 3.\n\nStep 3: Update the flow along the augmenting path. The new flow values are AB (3/5), AC (0/3), BC (3/4), CE (3/3), and the other edges remain unchanged.\n\nStep 2: Find another augmenting path in the residual graph. One possible path is A -> B -> D -> E. The minimum residual capacity along this path is min(2, 2, 5) = 2.\n\nStep 3: Update the flow along the augmenting path. The new flow values are AB (5/5), AC (0/3), BD (2/2), DE (2/5), and the other edges remain unchanged.\n\nStep 2: Find another augmenting path in the residual graph. One possible path is A -> C -> D -> E. The minimum residual capacity along this path is min(3, 2, 3) = 2.\n\nStep 3: Update the flow along the augmenting path. The new flow values are AC (2/3), CD (2/2), DE (4/5), and the other edges remain unchanged.\n\nStep 2: No more augmenting paths can be found in the residual graph.\n\nThe maximum flow from node A to node E is the sum of the flow values in the edges leaving A, which is 5 (AB) + 2 (AC) = 7."
