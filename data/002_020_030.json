    "message_1": "A sector of a circle has a radius of 8 cm and an angle of 45 degrees. What is the perimeter of the sector?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (angle/360) * 2πr\n\nwhere angle is the measure of the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the angle is 45 degrees and the radius is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (45/360) * 2 * 3.14159 * 8\nArc length = (1/8) * 2 * 3.14159 * 8\nArc length = 0.125 * 16 * 3.14159\nArc length ≈ 6.28318 cm\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2 * radius\nPerimeter = 6.28318 + 2 * 8\nPerimeter = 6.28318 + 16\nPerimeter ≈ 22.28318 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 22.28 cm."
