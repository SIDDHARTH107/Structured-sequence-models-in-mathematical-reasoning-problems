    "message_2": "The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 24 and 32 is the smallest number that both numbers can divide into evenly. To find the LCM, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of 24: 2^3 * 3^1\nPrime factorization of 32: 2^5\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor found in both numbers:\n2^5 * 3^1\n\nMultiply these prime factors together:\n32 * 3 = 96\n\nSo, the LCM of 24 and 32 is 96."
