    "message_2": "An elliptic curve defined over the complex numbers can be viewed as a compact Riemann surface of genus 1. To compute the Hodge numbers, we first need to find the dimension of the space of holomorphic differential forms on the elliptic curve.\n\nUsing the Riemann-Roch theorem for a compact Riemann surface of genus g, we have:\n\ndim(L(D)) - dim(L(K-D)) = deg(D) + 1 - g\n\nHere, L(D) is the space of meromorphic functions with poles only at the points in the divisor D, K is the canonical divisor, and deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D.\n\nFor an elliptic curve, we are interested in the space of holomorphic 1-forms, which corresponds to the case when D = K. In this case, the Riemann-Roch theorem simplifies to:\n\ndim(L(K)) - dim(L(0)) = deg(K) + 1 - g\n\nSince dim(L(0)) = 1 (it consists only of the constant functions), we have:\n\ndim(L(K)) = deg(K) + 1 - g + 1\n\nNow, we need to find the degree of the canonical divisor K. For a compact Riemann surface of genus g, we have deg(K) = 2g - 2. For an elliptic curve (genus 1), this gives deg(K) = 2(1) - 2 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the space of holomorphic 1-forms on the elliptic curve is:\n\ndim(L(K)) = 0 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 1\n\nNow, we use the Hodge decomposition theorem to determine the Hodge numbers. The Hodge decomposition theorem states that for a compact Kähler manifold (which includes compact Riemann surfaces), the cohomology groups can be decomposed into the direct sum of the Hodge components:\n\nH^k(M, C) = ⊕_{p+q=k} H^{p,q}(M)\n\nFor an elliptic curve, we are interested in the Hodge numbers h^{p,q}, which are the dimensions of the Hodge components H^{p,q}(M). In particular, we want to find h^{1,0} and h^{0,1}.\n\nSince we already found that the dimension of the space of holomorphic 1-forms on the elliptic curve is 1, we have h^{1,0} = 1.\n\nBy the complex conjugation symmetry of the Hodge decomposition, we have h^{p,q} = h^{q,p}. Therefore, h^{0,1} = h^{1,0} = 1.\n\nSo, the Hodge numbers for an elliptic curve defined over the complex numbers are h^{1,0} = h^{0,1} = 1."
