    "message_1": "Solve for x in the equation:\nsin²(3x) + cos²(3x) = 1",
    "message_2": "This equation is an application of the Pythagorean identity for trigonometric functions, which states that:\n\nsin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1\n\nIn this case, θ = 3x. Since the equation is already in the form of the Pythagorean identity, it is true for all values of x. Therefore, there is no need to solve for x, as the equation holds true for all x."
