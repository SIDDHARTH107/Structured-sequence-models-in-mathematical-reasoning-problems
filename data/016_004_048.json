    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a fractal, and its area cannot be calculated directly using standard geometry. However, we can approximate the area of the largest connected component after a certain number of iterations.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. After 9 iterations, the function becomes f(z) = (((((((z^2 + c)^2 + c)^2 + c)^2 + c)^2 + c)^2 + c)^2 + c)^2 + c.\n\nTo approximate the area of the largest connected component, we can use a numerical method such as the Monte Carlo method. This involves generating a large number of random points in the complex plane and checking whether they belong to the Mandelbrot set after 9 iterations. The ratio of points inside the set to the total number of points can be used to estimate the area.\n\nHowever, this method requires significant computational resources and is beyond the scope of this platform. It is recommended to use specialized software or programming languages like Python with libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib to perform such calculations."
