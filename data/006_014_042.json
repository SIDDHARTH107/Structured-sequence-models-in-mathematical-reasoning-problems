    "message_1": "A company has an inventory system that is known to have a 2% chance of failing at any given time. If the system is used continuously for 500 hours, what is the probability that it will fail at least once during this time period?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability that the system will fail at least once, we can find the probability that the system will not fail at all during the 500 hours and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet P(F) be the probability of the system failing at any given time, and P(NF) be the probability of the system not failing at any given time. We are given that P(F) = 0.02, so P(NF) = 1 - P(F) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the system will not fail at all during the 500 hours. Since the system has a 0.98 probability of not failing at any given time, the probability of it not failing for 500 consecutive hours is P(NF)^500.\n\nP(NF)^500 = (0.98)^500 ≈ 0.00657\n\nNow, we can find the probability that the system will fail at least once during the 500 hours by subtracting the probability of it not failing at all from 1.\n\nP(at least one failure) = 1 - P(NF)^500 ≈ 1 - 0.00657 ≈ 0.99343\n\nSo, the probability that the system will fail at least once during the 500 hours is approximately 0.99343 or 99.343%."
