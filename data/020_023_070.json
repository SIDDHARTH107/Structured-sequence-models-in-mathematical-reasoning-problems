The expected returns and risks of these assets are:\n\n- Stock fund: expected return of 10% with a risk (standard deviation) of 20%\n- Bond fund: expected return of 5% with a risk (standard deviation) of 8%\n- REIT: expected return of 12% with a risk (standard deviation) of 25%\n\nWhat is the optimal portfolio for this investor if they want to:\n\n- Maximize their expected return while keeping the risk below 15%\n- Maximize their expected return while keeping the risk at 20%\n- Minimize their risk while achieving an expected return of at least 8%? \n\nRound the weights of each asset to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal portfolio for each scenario, we will use the concept of efficient frontier, which is a set of portfolios that provide the highest expected return for a given level of risk. We will also use the concept of portfolio variance, which is a measure of the dispersion of the returns of a portfolio. The portfolio variance can be calculated as follows:\n\nPortfolio Variance = w1^2 * σ1^2 + w2^2 * σ2^2 + w3^2 * σ3^2 + 2 * w1 * w2 * Cov(1,2) + 2 * w1 * w3 * Cov(1,3) + 2 * w2 * w3 * Cov(2,3)\n\nwhere w1, w2, and w3 are the weights of the stock fund, bond fund, and REIT, respectively, σ1, σ2, and σ3 are the standard deviations of the stock fund, bond fund, and REIT, respectively, and Cov(1,2), Cov(1,3), and Cov(2,3) are the covariances between the returns of the assets.\n\nSince we don't have information about the covariances between the assets, we will assume that they are uncorrelated, which means that the covariances are equal to zero. This simplifies the portfolio variance formula to:\n\nPortfolio Variance = w1^2 * σ1^2 + w2^2 * σ2^2 + w3^2 * σ3^2\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio can be calculated as follows:\n\nExpected Portfolio Return = w1 * R1 + w2 * R2 + w3 * R3\n\nwhere R1, R2, and R3 are the expected returns of the stock fund, bond fund, and REIT, respectively.\n\nNow, let's solve the problem for each scenario:\n\n1. Maximize expected return while keeping the risk below 15%:\n\nWe will use the efficient frontier concept to find the portfolio with the highest expected return for a given level of risk. Since we don't have information about the covariances between the assets, we will use trial and error to find the optimal weights for each asset.\n\nAfter trying different combinations of weights, we find that the optimal portfolio is:\n\n- Stock fund: 40% (w1 = 0.40)\n- Bond fund: 60% (w2 = 0.60)\n- REIT: 0% (w3 = 0.00)\n\nThe portfolio risk is 14.42% and the expected return is 7.00%.\n\n2. Maximize expected return while keeping the risk at 20%:\n\nWe will use the same approach as in the first scenario. After trying different combinations of weights, we find that the optimal portfolio is:\n\n- Stock fund: 100% (w1 = 1.00)\n- Bond fund: 0% (w2 = 0.00)\n- REIT: 0% (w3 = 0.00)\n\nThe portfolio risk is 20% and the expected return is 10%.\n\n3. Minimize risk while achieving an expected return of at least 8%:\n\nWe will use the same approach as in the first two scenarios. After trying different combinations of weights, we find that the optimal portfolio is:\n\n- Stock fund: 60% (w1 = 0.60)\n- Bond fund: 40% (w2 = 0.40)\n- REIT: 0% (w3 = 0.00)\n\nThe portfolio risk is 14.42% and the expected return is 8.00%.\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal portfolios for each scenario are:\n\n1. Maximize expected return while keeping the risk below 15%: Stock fund (40%), Bond fund (60%), REIT (0%)\n2. Maximize expected return while keeping the risk at 20%: Stock fund (100%), Bond fund (0%), REIT (0%)\n3. Minimize risk while achieving an expected return of at least 8%: Stock fund (60%), Bond fund (40%), REIT (0%)"
