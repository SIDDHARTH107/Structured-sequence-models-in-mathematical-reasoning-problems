    "message_1": "A question related to RSA encryption could be:\n\nAssume that p = 61 and q = 53 are two prime numbers. Use RSA encryption to encrypt the message m = 19. Choose e = 17 as the public key. Find the private key d and the encrypted message c.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n and φ(n):\nn = p * q = 61 * 53 = 3233\nφ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = (61 - 1) * (53 - 1) = 60 * 52 = 3120\n\n2. Choose the public key e:\ne = 17 (given)\n\n3. Compute the private key d:\nTo find d, we need to solve the equation (e * d) % φ(n) = 1.\nIn this case, (17 * d) % 3120 = 1.\nBy trying different values, we find that d = 2753 satisfies this equation.\n\n4. Encrypt the message m using the public key (e, n):\nc = m^e % n = 19^17 % 3233 = 2790\n\nSo, the private key d is 2753, and the encrypted message c is 2790."
