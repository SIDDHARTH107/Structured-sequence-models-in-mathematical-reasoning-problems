    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nWe are given the hypotenuse (10 cm) and the adjacent side (7 cm) to the 45-degree angle. We can use the sine and cosine functions to find the base and height of the triangle.\n\nLet's call the base \"b\" and the height \"h\".\n\nSince we know the adjacent side and the hypotenuse, we can use the cosine function to find the base:\n\ncos(45) = adjacent / hypotenuse\ncos(45) = 7 / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for the base:\n\nb = 10 * cos(45)\nb ≈ 7.071 cm\n\nNext, we can use the sine function to find the height:\n\nsin(45) = opposite / hypotenuse\nsin(45) = h / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nh = 10 * sin(45)\nh ≈ 7.071 cm\n\nNow that we have the base and height, we can find the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * 7.071 * 7.071\nArea ≈ 25 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 25 cm²."
