    "message_2": "To evaluate the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^(-|t|), we need to use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken from -∞ to +∞.\n\nSince f(t) = e^(-|t|), we can split the integral into two parts, one for t < 0 and one for t ≥ 0:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(-|t|) * e^(-jωt)] dt = ∫[e^(-t) * e^(-jωt)] dt (for t ≥ 0) + ∫[e^(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt (for t < 0)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the two integrals separately:\n\nFor t ≥ 0:\nF1(ω) = ∫[e^(-t) * e^(-jωt)] dt from 0 to ∞\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\nLet u = e^(-t) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt\nThen, du = -e^(-t) dt and v = (-1/jω) * e^(-jωt)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\nF1(ω) = uv | from 0 to ∞ - ∫ v du\nF1(ω) = [(-1/jω) * e^(-t) * e^(-jωt)] | from 0 to ∞ + (1/jω) * ∫ e^(-t) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nEvaluating the first term:\nlim (t -> ∞) [(-1/jω) * e^(-t) * e^(-jωt)] = 0\nAt t = 0: [(-1/jω) * e^(0) * e^(0)] = -1/jω\n\nSo, F1(ω) = -1/jω + (1/jω) * ∫ e^(-t) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nNow, we have the same integral on the right side as before. We can rewrite it as:\nF1(ω) = -1/jω + (1/jω) * F1(ω)\n\nSolving for F1(ω):\nF1(ω) = 1/(1 + jω)\n\nFor t < 0:\nF2(ω) = ∫[e^(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt from -∞ to 0\nSimilar to the previous case, we can use integration by parts:\nLet u = e^(t) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt\nThen, du = e^(t) dt and v = (-1/jω) * e^(-jωt)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\nF2(ω) = uv | from -∞ to 0 - ∫ v du\nF2(ω) = [(-1/jω) * e^(t) * e^(-jωt)] | from -∞ to 0 + (1/jω) * ∫ e^(t) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nEvaluating the first term:\nlim (t -> -∞) [(-1/jω) * e^(t) * e^(-jωt)] = 0\nAt t = 0: [(-1/jω) * e^(0) * e^(0)] = -1/jω\n\nSo, F2(ω) = -1/jω + (1/jω) * ∫ e^(t) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nNow, we have the same integral on the right side as before. We can rewrite it as:\nF2(ω) = -1/jω + (1/jω) * F2(ω)\n\nSolving for F2(ω):\nF2(ω) = 1/(1 - jω)\n\nFinally, we can add F1(ω) and F2(ω) to get the Fourier transform of f(t):\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω) = 1/(1 + jω) + 1/(1 - jω)\n\nTo simplify, we can find a common denominator:\n\nF(ω) = [(1 - jω) + (1 + jω)] / [(1 + jω)(1 - jω)]\nF(ω) = [2] / [1 + ω^2]\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of f(t) = e^(-|t|) is:\n\nF(ω) = 2 / (1 + ω^2)"
