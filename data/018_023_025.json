    "message_2": "First, let's find A△B (the symmetric difference of A and B). The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA△B = {1, 3} (since 1 is in A but not in B, and 3 is in B but not in A)\n\nNow, let's find (A△B)△B:\n\n(A△B)△B = {1, 3}△{2, 3} = {1, 2} (since 1 is in (A△B) but not in B, 2 is in B but not in (A△B), and 3 is in both (A△B) and B)\n\nNext, let's find B△B. Since the symmetric difference of a set with itself is the empty set, we have:\n\nB△B = ∅\n\nNow, let's find A△(B△B):\n\nA△(B△B) = A△∅ = A = {1, 2} (since the symmetric difference of a set with the empty set is the set itself)\n\nFinally, let's find the Cartesian products of (A△B)△B and A△(B△B):\n\n(A△B)△B = {1, 2}\nA△(B△B) = {1, 2}\n\nCartesian product of (A△B)△B: {1, 2} × {1, 2} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}\n\nCartesian product of A△(B△B): {1, 2} × {1, 2} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}\n\nThe Cartesian products of (A△B)△B and A△(B△B) are equal:\n\n{(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}\n\nHowever, the original problem statement asked to show that they are not equal. It appears that there was a mistake in the problem statement, as the Cartesian products of (A△B)△B and A△(B△B) are indeed equal."
