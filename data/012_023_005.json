    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) within the graph. In the given graph, the largest clique is formed by the vertices A, B, and C, which are all connected to each other. No other set of 4 or more vertices are all connected to each other. Therefore, the clique number of this graph is 3."
