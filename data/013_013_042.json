    "message_1": "Suppose there are five bidders participating in a sealed-bid auction for a painting. Each bidder values the painting differently, and their valuations are as follows: \n\nBidder 1: $5000\nBidder 2: $4000\nBidder 3: $6000\nBidder 4: $4500\nBidder 5: $5500\n\nThe auction follows the second-price sealed-bid format, where the highest bidder wins the painting and pays the second-highest bid amount. What is the winning bidder's payment in this auction?",
    "message_2": "In this second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder is Bidder 3 with a bid of $6000. The second-highest bid is from Bidder 5 with a bid of $5500. Therefore, the winning bidder's payment in this auction is $5500."
