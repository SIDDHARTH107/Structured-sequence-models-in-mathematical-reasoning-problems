    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle with the given information, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C)\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the two given sides, and C is the included angle between them.\n\nIn this case, a = 8 cm, b = 12 cm, and C = 60 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (60 * π) / 180 = π / 3\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 8 * 12 * sin(π / 3)\n\nThe sine of π/3 (or 60 degrees) is √3/2:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 8 * 12 * (√3/2)\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nArea = 4 * 12 * (√3/2)\n\nArea = 48 * (√3/2)\n\nArea = 24√3 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 24√3 cm²."
