    "message_2": "We can use the property of modular arithmetic to solve this problem. First, let's find the remainder of 37 when divided by 9:\n\n37 ≡ 1 (mod 9)\n\nNow, we can raise both sides of the congruence to the power of 4:\n\n(37^4) ≡ (1^4) (mod 9)\n\nSince 1 raised to any power is still 1, we have:\n\n37^4 ≡ 1 (mod 9)\n\nSo, the remainder when 37^4 is divided by 9 is 1."
