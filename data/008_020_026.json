    "message_2": "To solve the given system of equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its reduced row-echelon form (RREF). The given system of equations can be represented as the following augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  3  5 | 14 |\n| 3  2  4 | 12 |\n| 4  5  3 | 17 |\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to get the largest pivot in the first column.\n\n| 3  2  4 | 12 |\n| 2  3  5 | 14 |\n| 4  5  3 | 17 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element of Row 2 and Row 3. To do this, we will perform the following row operations: R2 = R2 - (2/3)R1 and R3 = R3 - (4/3)R1.\n\n| 3    2    4 | 12  |\n| 0    5/3  7/3| 2  |\n| 0    7/3  1/3| 1  |\n\nStep 3: Multiply Row 2 by 3/5 to make the pivot in the second column equal to 1.\n\n| 3    2    4 | 12  |\n| 0    1    7/5| 6/5 |\n| 0    7/3  1/3| 1  |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second element of Row 3. To do this, we will perform the following row operation: R3 = R3 - (7/3)R2.\n\n| 3    2    4 | 12  |\n| 0    1    7/5| 6/5 |\n| 0    0   -8/5| 1/5 |\n\nStep 5: Multiply Row 3 by -5/8 to make the pivot in the third column equal to 1.\n\n| 3    2    4 | 12  |\n| 0    1    7/5| 6/5 |\n| 0    0    1  | -1/8|\n\nStep 6: Eliminate the third element of Row 1 and Row 2. To do this, we will perform the following row operations: R1 = R1 - 4R3 and R2 = R2 - (7/5)R3.\n\n| 3    2    0 | 12 + 1/2 |\n| 0    1    0 | 6/5 + 7/40 |\n| 0    0    1 | -1/8      |\n\nStep 7: Eliminate the second element of Row 1. To do this, we will perform the following row operation: R1 = R1 - 2R2.\n\n| 3    0    0 | 25/2 - 12/5 |\n| 0    1    0 | 6/5 + 7/40 |\n| 0    0    1 | -1/8        |\n\nStep 8: Divide Row 1 by 3 to make the pivot in the first column equal to 1.\n\n| 1    0    0 | (25/2 - 12/5)/3 |\n| 0    1    0 | 6/5 + 7/40      |\n| 0    0    1 | -1/8            |\n\nNow, we can read the solution from the augmented matrix:\n\nx = (25/2 - 12/5)/3 = 1\ny = 6/5 + 7/40 = 2\nz = -1/8\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = -1/8."
