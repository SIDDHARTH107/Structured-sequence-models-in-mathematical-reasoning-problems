    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 3, we get:\n\n3(x + 2y) = 3(5)\n3x + 6y = 15\n\nNow we have:\n\n3x + 6y = 15\n3x + 6y = 10\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n(3x + 6y) - (3x + 6y) = 15 - 10\n0 = 5\n\nSince 0 â‰  5, we have a contradiction. This means that the system of linear equations has no solution."
