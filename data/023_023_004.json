    "message_1": "Suppose we have a network with an input signal that is a square wave with a period of 10 seconds and an amplitude of 5 volts. If the network's output signal is given by the Fourier transform of the input signal, what is the amplitude of the first harmonic of the output signal, assuming the frequency of the first harmonic is 0.1 Hz?",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude of the first harmonic of the output signal, we need to calculate the Fourier series coefficients for the input square wave signal. The general formula for the Fourier series of a periodic function is:\n\nf(t) = a0 + Σ[an * cos(nωt) + bn * sin(nωt)]\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2π/T, T is the period), n is the harmonic number, and an and bn are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nFor a square wave with amplitude A and period T, the Fourier coefficients are given by:\n\na0 = 0 (since the square wave is an odd function)\n\nan = 0 (since the square wave is an odd function)\n\nbn = (2A/nπ) * (1 - cos(nπ)) for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nIn our case, the amplitude A = 5 volts, and the period T = 10 seconds. Therefore, the angular frequency ω = 2π/T = 2π/10 = π/5.\n\nNow, we want to find the amplitude of the first harmonic (n = 1). Since an = 0, we only need to calculate the bn coefficient for n = 1:\n\nb1 = (2 * 5) / (1 * π) * (1 - cos(1 * π)) = 10/π * (1 - (-1)) = 20/π\n\nThe amplitude of the first harmonic (0.1 Hz) of the output signal is 20/π volts."
