    "message_1": "An experiment is conducted to test the effectiveness of a new fertilizer on growing roses. Two groups of roses are selected, with 15 roses in each group. Group A is treated with the new fertilizer and Group B is not treated. After one month, the heights of the roses in both groups are measured. The results are:\n\nGroup A: mean height = 18 inches, standard deviation = 2 inches\nGroup B: mean height = 12 inches, standard deviation = 3 inches\n\nIs the new fertilizer effective in increasing the height of roses? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the new fertilizer is effective in increasing the height of roses, we can perform a two-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no difference in the mean heights of the two groups, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a significant difference in the mean heights.\n\nGiven data:\nn1 = n2 = 15 (sample size for both groups)\nMean1 (Group A) = 18 inches\nMean2 (Group B) = 12 inches\nStandard deviation1 (Group A) = 2 inches\nStandard deviation2 (Group B) = 3 inches\nSignificance level (alpha) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the pooled variance:\ns_p^2 = [(n1 - 1) * s1^2 + (n2 - 1) * s2^2] / (n1 + n2 - 2)\ns_p^2 = [(15 - 1) * 2^2 + (15 - 1) * 3^2] / (15 + 15 - 2)\ns_p^2 = [56 + 168] / 28\ns_p^2 = 224 / 28\ns_p^2 = 8\n\nNext, we calculate the standard error (SE) of the difference in means:\nSE = sqrt[(s_p^2 / n1) + (s_p^2 / n2)]\nSE = sqrt[(8 / 15) + (8 / 15)]\nSE = sqrt[0.5333 + 0.5333]\nSE = sqrt[1.0666]\nSE ≈ 1.033\n\nNow, we calculate the t-value:\nt = (Mean1 - Mean2) / SE\nt = (18 - 12) / 1.033\nt ≈ 5.806\n\nNext, we find the degrees of freedom (df):\ndf = n1 + n2 - 2\ndf = 15 + 15 - 2\ndf = 28\n\nUsing a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with df = 28 and alpha = 0.05:\nt_critical ≈ 2.048\n\nSince the calculated t-value (5.806) is greater than the critical t-value (2.048), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean heights of the two groups.\n\nTherefore, the new fertilizer is effective in increasing the height of roses at a significance level of 0.05."
