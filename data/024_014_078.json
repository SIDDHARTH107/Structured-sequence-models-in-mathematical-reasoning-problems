    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of $X$ along the vector field $Y$, we use the Lie bracket of vector fields, denoted as $[Y, X]$. The Lie bracket is defined as:\n\n$[Y, X] = (YX^i - XY^i)\\partial_i$\n\nwhere $X^i$ and $Y^i$ are the components of the vector fields $X$ and $Y$, respectively, and $\\partial_i$ are the coordinate basis vectors.\n\nFirst, let's compute the action of $Y$ on the components of $X$:\n\n$Y(x^2) = (xy\\partial_x + x^3\\partial_y)(x^2) = xy(2x) + x^3(0) = 2x^3y$\n\n$Y(y^2) = (xy\\partial_x + x^3\\partial_y)(y^2) = xy(0) + x^3(2y) = 2x^3y$\n\nNow, let's compute the action of $X$ on the components of $Y$:\n\n$X(xy) = (x^2\\partial_x + y^2\\partial_y)(xy) = x^2(y) + y^2(x) = x^3y + xy^3$\n\n$X(x^3) = (x^2\\partial_x + y^2\\partial_y)(x^3) = x^2(3x^2) + y^2(0) = 3x^4$\n\nNow we can compute the Lie bracket $[Y, X]$:\n\n$[Y, X] = (YX^i - XY^i)\\partial_i = (Y(x^2) - X(xy))\\partial_x + (Y(y^2) - X(x^3))\\partial_y$\n\n$[Y, X] = (2x^3y - (x^3y + xy^3))\\partial_x + (2x^3y - 3x^4)\\partial_y$\n\n$[Y, X] = (x^3y - xy^3)\\partial_x + (2x^3y - 3x^4)\\partial_y$\n\nSo, the Lie derivative of $X$ along the vector field $Y$ is:\n\n$\\mathcal{L}_Y X = [Y, X] = (x^3y - xy^3)\\partial_x + (2x^3y - 3x^4)\\partial_y$"
