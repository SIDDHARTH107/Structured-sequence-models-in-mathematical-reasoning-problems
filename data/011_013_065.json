    "message_1": "A student has 9 different colored beads and wants to make a necklace using 3 beads. How many different necklaces can be made if the necklace must have at least one red bead? (Hint: Use Polya's enumeration theorem)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Polya's enumeration theorem, we first need to find the cycle index polynomial for the necklace. Since the necklace has 3 beads, we consider the group of rotations of a 3-bead necklace, which is the cyclic group C3. The cycle index polynomial for C3 is given by:\n\nP_C3 = (1/3) * (p1^3 + 2*p3)\n\nNow, we need to substitute the number of available colors (9) into the cycle index polynomial. Since there must be at least one red bead, we have 8 other colors to choose from for the remaining beads. So, we substitute 8 for p1 and 1 for p3 (since there is only one way to choose a red bead):\n\nP_C3(8, 1) = (1/3) * (8^3 + 2*1^3) = (1/3) * (512 + 2) = 514/3\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of necklaces that have no red beads. To do this, we substitute 8 for p1 and 0 for p3 (since there are no red beads):\n\nP_C3(8, 0) = (1/3) * (8^3 + 2*0^3) = (1/3) * (512) = 512/3\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of necklaces with no red beads from the total number of necklaces:\n\nNumber of necklaces with at least one red bead = P_C3(8, 1) - P_C3(8, 0) = (514/3) - (512/3) = 2/3\n\nHowever, this result is not an integer, which means we made a mistake in our calculations. The mistake was in substituting 8 for p1 and 1 for p3. We should have substituted 9 for p1 (since there are 9 colors in total) and 1 for p3 (since there is only one way to choose a red bead):\n\nP_C3(9, 1) = (1/3) * (9^3 + 2*1^3) = (1/3) * (729 + 2) = 731/3\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of necklaces that have no red beads. To do this, we substitute 8 for p1 and 0 for p3 (since there are no red beads):\n\nP_C3(8, 0) = (1/3) * (8^3 + 2*0^3) = (1/3) * (512) = 512/3\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of necklaces with no red beads from the total number of necklaces:\n\nNumber of necklaces with at least one red bead = P_C3(9, 1) - P_C3(8, 0) = (731/3) - (512/3) = 219/3 = 73\n\nSo, there are 73 different necklaces that can be made with at least one red bead."
