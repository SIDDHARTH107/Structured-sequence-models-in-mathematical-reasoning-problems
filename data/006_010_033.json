    "message_2": "To find the most likely number of people affected by the disease in the age group 20-30 years, we can multiply the total number of people in this age group by the probability of a person being affected by the disease.\n\nTotal number of people in the age group 20-30 years = 1000\nProbability of a person being affected by the disease = 0.05\n\nMost likely number of people affected by the disease = Total number of people × Probability of being affected\n= 1000 × 0.05\n= 50\n\nSo, the most likely number of people affected by the disease in the age group 20-30 years is 50."
