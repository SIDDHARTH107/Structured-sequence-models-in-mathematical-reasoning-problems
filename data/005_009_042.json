    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we first need to rank the data from smallest to largest, ignoring which lake the data came from. Here are the ranks:\n\nLake 7: 5 (1)\nLake 10: 6 (2)\nLake 5: 7 (3)\nLake 2: 8 (4)\nLake 8: 9 (5)\nLake 4: 10 (6)\nLake 1: 12 (7)\nLake 9: 14 (8)\nLake 3: 15 (9)\nLake 6: 18 (10)\n\nNow, let's say we randomly choose two lakes, Lake A and Lake B. We will calculate the rank sum for each lake and compare them using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\n\nFor example, let's choose Lake 1 and Lake 6:\n\nRank sum for Lake 1: 7\nRank sum for Lake 6: 10\n\nThe critical value for the Wilcoxon rank-sum test at a 0.05 significance level with a sample size of 10 is 8. Since the rank sum for both lakes is greater than the critical value, we cannot conclude that there is a significant difference in the number of fish between these two lakes.\n\nHowever, this is just one example. To determine if there is a significant difference in the number of fish between two lakes chosen at random, we would need to perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for all possible pairs of lakes and see if any of them show a significant difference. There are 45 possible pairs of lakes, so this would be a lengthy process.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the example we calculated, we cannot conclude that there is a significant difference in the number of fish between the two lakes chosen. However, to make a more general statement about any two lakes chosen at random, we would need to perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for all possible pairs of lakes."
