    "message_2": "To find the definite integral of sin(x) from x=0 to x=π/2, we need to find the antiderivative of sin(x) and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe antiderivative of sin(x) is -cos(x). Now, we will evaluate -cos(x) at the given limits:\n\n∫(sin(x)dx) from 0 to π/2 = [-cos(x)] from 0 to π/2\n\n= -cos(π/2) - (-cos(0))\n\n= -0 - (-1)\n\n= 1\n\nSo, the definite integral of sin(x) from x=0 to x=π/2 is 1."
