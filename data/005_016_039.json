    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to classify their products into two categories based on two variables - variable X and variable Y. The company randomly selected 40 products and analyzed both variables. Out of 40 products, 20 were classified as Category 1 and the remaining 20 as Category 2. The mean and standard deviation for both variables are provided below:\n\nVariable X:\nMean for Category 1: 15\nMean for Category 2: 10\nStandard deviation for Category 1: 2\nStandard deviation for Category 2: 3\n\nVariable Y:\nMean for Category 1: 25\nMean for Category 2: 30\nStandard deviation for Category 1: 5\nStandard deviation for Category 2: 4\n\nIf a new product with variable X = 12 and variable Y = 28 is analyzed, which category will it belong to? Use discriminant analysis to classify the new product.",
    "message_2": "To perform discriminant analysis, we will calculate the discriminant score for each category using the given means, standard deviations, and the new product's variable values. The discriminant score formula is:\n\nD = (X - mean_X) / SD_X + (Y - mean_Y) / SD_Y\n\nFor Category 1:\nD1 = (12 - 15) / 2 + (28 - 25) / 5\nD1 = (-3 / 2) + (3 / 5)\nD1 = -1.5 + 0.6\nD1 = -0.9\n\nFor Category 2:\nD2 = (12 - 10) / 3 + (28 - 30) / 4\nD2 = (2 / 3) + (-2 / 4)\nD2 = 0.67 - 0.5\nD2 = 0.17\n\nNow, we compare the discriminant scores. The new product will belong to the category with the higher discriminant score.\n\nSince D2 (0.17) is greater than D1 (-0.9), the new product will belong to Category 2."
