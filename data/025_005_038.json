    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - x^2$, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ and find the points where both partial derivatives are zero.\n\nLet $f(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + x^2$. Then, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 + 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y)$ where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0 \\Rightarrow -3x^2 + 2x = 0 \\Rightarrow x(2 - 3x) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for $x$: $x = 0$ and $x = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nNext, we find the corresponding $y$ values:\n\n1. For $x = 0$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0 \\Rightarrow 2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nSo, one possible singular point is $(0, 0)$.\n\n2. For $x = \\frac{2}{3}$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0 \\Rightarrow 2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nSo, another possible singular point is $(\\frac{2}{3}, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to check if these points are indeed singular points by computing the determinant of the Hessian matrix of $f(x, y)$:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -6x + 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe determinant of the Hessian matrix is:\n\n$\\det(H(f)) = (-6x + 2)(2) = -12x + 4$\n\nNow, we evaluate the determinant at the two possible singular points:\n\n1. For $(0, 0)$:\n\n$\\det(H(f)) = -12(0) + 4 = 4$\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, $(0, 0)$ is a non-singular point.\n\n2. For $(\\frac{2}{3}, 0)$:\n\n$\\det(H(f)) = -12(\\frac{2}{3}) + 4 = -8 + 4 = -4$\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, $(\\frac{2}{3}, 0)$ is a non-singular point.\n\nTherefore, there are no singular points for the algebraic variety defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - x^2$."
