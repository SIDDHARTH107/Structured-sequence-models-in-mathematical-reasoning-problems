    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces light bulbs and claims that the average lifespan of their product is 1000 hours. A sample of 50 light bulbs was randomly selected and their lifespans were recorded. The sample mean was found to be 950 hours with a standard deviation of 50 hours. Can the manufacturer's claim be supported? Use a confidence level of 95%.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the manufacturer's claim can be supported, we will perform a hypothesis test using a t-distribution since the population standard deviation is unknown. We will use a 95% confidence level.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 1000 hours (The manufacturer's claim is true.)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 1000 hours (The manufacturer's claim is not true.)\n\nStep 2: Determine the t-score.\nWe will use the formula for the t-score: t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nt = (950 - 1000) / (50 / √50)\nt = (-50) / (50 / √50)\nt = -50 / (50 / 7.071)\nt = -50 / 7.071\nt ≈ -7.07\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical t-value.\nSince we are using a 95% confidence level and have a two-tailed test (because the alternative hypothesis is μ ≠ 1000), we will use a 0.025 significance level in each tail. The degrees of freedom (df) for this test is n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49.\n\nUsing a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value for a 95% confidence level and 49 degrees of freedom to be approximately ±2.009.\n\nStep 4: Compare the t-score to the critical t-value.\nOur t-score is -7.07, and our critical t-value is ±2.009. Since -7.07 < -2.009, our t-score falls in the rejection region.\n\nStep 5: Make a decision.\nSince our t-score falls in the rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis. There is significant evidence to suggest that the manufacturer's claim of an average lifespan of 1000 hours is not true at a 95% confidence level."
