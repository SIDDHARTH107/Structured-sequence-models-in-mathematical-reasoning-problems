    "message_1": "In a factory, it is estimated that the probability of a worker getting injured in an accident is 0.2. If there are 50 workers in the factory, what is the probability that at least 8 workers will be injured in accidents in a given year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, workers getting injured) out of n trials (workers)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, a worker getting injured)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of workers)\n- k is the number of successes we're interested in\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 8 workers will be injured, which means we need to find the probability of 8, 9, 10, ..., 50 workers being injured. We can find this by summing the probabilities for each of these cases and then subtracting from 1 (since the sum of all probabilities is 1):\n\nP(at least 8 injured) = 1 - P(0 injured) - P(1 injured) - ... - P(7 injured)\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for 0 to 7 injured workers:\n\nn = 50 (number of workers)\np = 0.2 (probability of a worker getting injured)\n\nP(X = k) = C(50, k) * 0.2^k * (1-0.2)^(50-k)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for k = 0 to 7:\n\nP(0) = C(50, 0) * 0.2^0 * 0.8^50 ≈ 1.427e-10\nP(1) = C(50, 1) * 0.2^1 * 0.8^49 ≈ 7.135e-9\nP(2) = C(50, 2) * 0.2^2 * 0.8^48 ≈ 1.607e-7\nP(3) = C(50, 3) * 0.2^3 * 0.8^47 ≈ 1.807e-6\nP(4) = C(50, 4) * 0.2^4 * 0.8^46 ≈ 1.352e-5\nP(5) = C(50, 5) * 0.2^5 * 0.8^45 ≈ 6.760e-5\nP(6) = C(50, 6) * 0.2^6 * 0.8^44 ≈ 2.256e-4\nP(7) = C(50, 7) * 0.2^7 * 0.8^43 ≈ 5.641e-4\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of at least 8 workers being injured:\n\nP(at least 8 injured) = 1 - (P(0) + P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + P(4) + P(5) + P(6) + P(7))\nP(at least 8 injured) = 1 - (1.427e-10 + 7.135e-9 + 1.607e-7 + 1.807e-6 + 1.352e-5 + 6.760e-5 + 2.256e-4 + 5.641e-4)\nP(at least 8 injured) ≈ 1 - 0.000980\nP(at least 8 injured) ≈ 0.999020\n\nSo, the probability that at least 8 workers will be injured in accidents in a given year is approximately 0.999 or 99.9%."
