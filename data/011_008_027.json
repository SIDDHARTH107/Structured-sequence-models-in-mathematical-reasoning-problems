    "message_2": "Using Stirling numbers of the second kind is not the appropriate method to solve this problem. Instead, we can use combinations to find the number of ways to choose 5 students from a class of 10.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 students from a class of 10 can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (10 in this case) and k is the number of students to be chosen (5 in this case).\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo, there are 252 ways to choose a group of 5 students from a class of 10 to participate in a math competition."
