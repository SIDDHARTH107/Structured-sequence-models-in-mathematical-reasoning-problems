    "message_2": "To compute the ciphertext for the given plaintext and key using a Feistel cipher, we need to know the specific round function (F function) used in the cipher. The Feistel cipher is a general structure for symmetric key block ciphers, and different ciphers may use different round functions.\n\nHowever, I can provide a general outline of the encryption process:\n\n1. Divide the 64-bit plaintext block into two 32-bit halves, L0 and R0.\n2. For each round i (1 to 16), perform the following steps:\n   a. Compute the round key Ki from the 128-bit key using a key schedule algorithm.\n   b. Apply the round function F to the right half Ri-1 and the round key Ki: F(Ri-1, Ki).\n   c. XOR the result of the round function with the left half Li-1: Li = Ri-1 XOR F(Ri-1, Ki).\n   d. Set the new right half Ri equal to the previous left half Li-1: Ri = Li-1.\n3. After the 16th round, combine the final left and right halves L16 and R16 to form the 64-bit ciphertext block.\n\nWithout knowing the specific round function and key schedule algorithm, we cannot compute the exact ciphertext. If you can provide more information about the Feistel cipher being used, I can help you further."
