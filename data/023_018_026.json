    "message_1": "A control system is represented by a differential equation:\n\ny''(t) + 2y'(t) + 5y(t) = 10u(t)\n\nwhere y(t) is the output and u(t) is the input to the system. If the input signal u(t) is a cosine wave with amplitude 4 and frequency 2 Hz, find the amplitude and phase angle of the output signal y(t) at steady-state. Use Fourier analysis to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Given the input signal u(t) is a cosine wave with amplitude 4 and frequency 2 Hz, we can represent it as:\n\nu(t) = 4cos(4πt)\n\nNow, we need to find the steady-state output y(t) for the given differential equation. Since the input is a cosine function, we can assume the output will also be a cosine function with the same frequency:\n\ny(t) = Ycos(4πt + φ)\n\nwhere Y is the amplitude and φ is the phase angle of the output signal.\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives of y(t):\n\ny'(t) = -4πYsin(4πt + φ)\ny''(t) = -16π²Ycos(4πt + φ)\n\nNow, substitute y(t), y'(t), and y''(t) into the given differential equation:\n\n-16π²Ycos(4πt + φ) - 2(4π)Ysin(4πt + φ) + 5Ycos(4πt + φ) = 10(4cos(4πt))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n(5Y - 16π²Y)cos(4πt + φ) - 8πYsin(4πt + φ) = 40cos(4πt)\n\nNow, we can equate the coefficients of the cosine and sine terms:\n\n5Y - 16π²Y = 40  (1)\n-8πY = 0         (2)\n\nFrom equation (2), we have two possibilities: either Y = 0 or the sine term is zero. Since Y = 0 would mean no output, we can ignore that case. So, we consider the sine term to be zero:\n\nsin(4πt + φ) = 0\n\nThis implies that (4πt + φ) is a multiple of π:\n\n4πt + φ = nπ, where n is an integer\n\nNow, we need to find the amplitude Y. From equation (1):\n\n5Y - 16π²Y = 40\n\nY(5 - 16π²) = 40\n\nY = 40 / (5 - 16π²)\n\nNow, we have the amplitude Y and the phase angle φ:\n\nAmplitude Y = 40 / (5 - 16π²)\nPhase angle φ = nπ - 4πt, where n is an integer\n\nThe steady-state output y(t) is given by:\n\ny(t) = (40 / (5 - 16π²))cos(4πt + nπ - 4πt)\n\ny(t) = (40 / (5 - 16π²))cos(nπ)\n\nSince n is an integer, the phase angle will be either 0 or π, depending on the value of n. The output signal y(t) will have an amplitude of 40 / (5 - 16π²) and a phase angle of either 0 or π."
