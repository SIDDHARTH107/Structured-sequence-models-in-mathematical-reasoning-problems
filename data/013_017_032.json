    "message_1": "Suppose there are two sellers who are selling used cars. Seller A has a 2010 Toyota while Seller B has a 2014 Mercedes. Both sellers know the true condition of their respective cars, but the buyers are not aware of this information. \n\nSeller A believes that the probability of his car having mechanical issues is 0.4 whereas Seller B believes that the probability of his car having mechanical issues is 0.2. The buyers are willing to pay $10,000 for a car that is in good condition, but would only pay $5,000 for a car with mechanical issues.\n\nAssuming that the buyers have perfect information on prices, determine the prices Seller A and Seller B should quote for their cars to avoid adverse selection.",
    "message_2": "To avoid adverse selection, both sellers should quote a price that reflects the expected value of their cars given the probability of having mechanical issues. \n\nFor Seller A (2010 Toyota):\nThe expected value of the car can be calculated as follows:\nE(A) = P(Good Condition) * Price(Good Condition) + P(Mechanical Issues) * Price(Mechanical Issues)\n\nThe probability of the car being in good condition is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So,\nE(A) = 0.6 * $10,000 + 0.4 * $5,000\nE(A) = $6,000 + $2,000\nE(A) = $8,000\n\nSeller A should quote a price of $8,000 for their car.\n\nFor Seller B (2014 Mercedes):\nSimilarly, we can calculate the expected value of the car as follows:\nE(B) = P(Good Condition) * Price(Good Condition) + P(Mechanical Issues) * Price(Mechanical Issues)\n\nThe probability of the car being in good condition is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. So,\nE(B) = 0.8 * $10,000 + 0.2 * $5,000\nE(B) = $8,000 + $1,000\nE(B) = $9,000\n\nSeller B should quote a price of $9,000 for their car.\n\nBy quoting these prices, both sellers are reflecting the expected value of their cars given the probability of having mechanical issues, which helps to avoid adverse selection."
