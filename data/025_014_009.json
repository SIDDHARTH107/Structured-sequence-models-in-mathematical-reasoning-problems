Let K be the function field of C, and let g be the genus of C. Consider the divisors\n\n    D = (1/2)(P+Q),\n    E = (1/2)(P'+Q'),\n    \nwhere P, Q, P', and Q' are four distinct points on C. Compute the dimension of the space of holomorphic functions on C whose zeroes and poles are restricted to the divisors D and E, respectively, in terms of the Riemann theta function.",
    "message_2": "The Riemann-Roch theorem for a compact Riemann surface (or algebraic curve) C of genus g states that for any divisor D on C, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the space of holomorphic functions on C with poles only at the points of D, K is the canonical divisor, and deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D.\n\nIn our case, we have a genus 2 curve, so g = 2. We are interested in the space of holomorphic functions with zeroes at divisor D and poles at divisor E. Let F = D - E, then we want to compute l(F). \n\nFirst, we need to find the degree of F:\n\ndeg(F) = deg(D) - deg(E) = (1/2)(deg(P) + deg(Q)) - (1/2)(deg(P') + deg(Q')) = 0.\n\nNow we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nl(F) - l(K - F) = deg(F) + 1 - g = 0 + 1 - 2 = -1.\n\nSince l(K - F) is a non-negative integer, we must have l(F) = 0. This means that there are no non-constant holomorphic functions on C with zeroes at divisor D and poles at divisor E.\n\nAs for the relation to the Riemann theta function, the Riemann theta function is used to parametrize the Jacobian variety of the curve, which is the space of degree 0 divisors modulo linear equivalence. In this case, since l(F) = 0, the divisors D and E are linearly equivalent, and their difference does not contribute to the Riemann theta function."
