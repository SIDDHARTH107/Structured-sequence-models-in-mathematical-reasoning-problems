    "message_1": "A trapezium has a shorter base of 5 cm, a longer base of 12 cm, and a height of 8 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the left side \"a\" and the length of the right side \"b\".\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of these sides. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the horizontal distance between the two bases. Since the trapezium is symmetrical, this distance is equal to (12 - 5) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5 cm.\n\nNow, we can create two right-angled triangles: one with the height, the left side (a), and the horizontal distance (3.5 cm), and another with the height, the right side (b), and the horizontal distance (3.5 cm).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for both triangles:\n\na^2 = 8^2 + 3.5^2\na^2 = 64 + 12.25\na^2 = 76.25\na = √76.25\na ≈ 8.73 cm\n\nb^2 = 8^2 + 3.5^2\nb^2 = 64 + 12.25\nb^2 = 76.25\nb = √76.25\nb ≈ 8.73 cm\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all four sides, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = 5 + 12 + 8.73 + 8.73 ≈ 34.46 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 34.46 cm."
