    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). We can rewrite the SDE as follows:\n\n$dX_t = -2X_t dt + 3dB_t$\n\nUsing the integrating factor method, we multiply both sides by $e^{2t}$:\n\n$e^{2t}dX_t = -2X_t e^{2t} dt + 3e^{2t} dB_t$\n\nNow, we can take the differential of the product $Y_t = X_t e^{2t}$:\n\n$dY_t = d(X_t e^{2t}) = e^{2t}dX_t + 2X_t e^{2t} dt$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $e^{2t}dX_t$ from the SDE:\n\n$dY_t = -2X_t e^{2t} dt + 3e^{2t} dB_t + 2X_t e^{2t} dt$\n\nThe $-2X_t e^{2t} dt$ and $2X_t e^{2t} dt$ terms cancel out, leaving:\n\n$dY_t = 3e^{2t} dB_t$\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides over the interval $[0, t]$:\n\n$Y_t - Y_0 = \\int_0^t 3e^{2s} dB_s$\n\nSince $Y_0 = X_0 e^{2\\cdot0} = 1$, we have:\n\n$Y_t - 1 = \\int_0^t 3e^{2s} dB_s$\n\nNow, we can find $X_t$ by dividing both sides by $e^{2t}$:\n\n$X_t = \\frac{Y_t - 1}{e^{2t}} = \\frac{1}{e^{2t}} + \\frac{1}{e^{2t}}\\int_0^t 3e^{2s} dB_s$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $X_t$ is negative for some $t \\in [0,1]$. Since $X_t$ is a continuous process, we can use the reflection principle for Brownian motion. Let $T = \\inf\\{t \\in [0,1] : X_t < 0\\}$. Then, the probability we are looking for is:\n\n$P(T \\leq 1) = P(\\exists t \\in [0,1] : X_t < 0)$\n\nUsing the reflection principle, we can write:\n\n$P(T \\leq 1) = P(\\exists t \\in [0,1] : B_t - B_T \\geq \\frac{1}{e^{2t}})$\n\nSince $B_t - B_T$ is a Brownian motion independent of $B_T$, we can write:\n\n$P(T \\leq 1) = P(\\exists t \\in [0,1] : B_t \\geq \\frac{1}{e^{2t}})$\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the maximum of a Brownian motion on the interval $[0,1]$ has the same distribution as the absolute value of a Brownian motion at time $1$, i.e., $|B_1|$:\n\n$P(T \\leq 1) = P(\\max_{t \\in [0,1]} B_t \\geq \\frac{1}{e^2})$\n\nSince $|B_1|$ has a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $1$, we can write:\n\n$P(T \\leq 1) = P(|B_1| \\geq \\frac{1}{e^2}) = 2\\Phi\\left(-\\frac{1}{e^2}\\right)$\n\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Therefore, the probability that $X_t$ is negative for some $t \\in [0,1]$ is:\n\n$P(T \\leq 1) = 2\\Phi\\left(-\\frac{1}{e^2}\\right)$"
