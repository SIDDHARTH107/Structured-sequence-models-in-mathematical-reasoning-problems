    "message_2": "In this problem, we are given that p implies q (p → q) and q is not true (¬q). We want to determine the truth value of p.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we can rewrite the given statement p → q as ¬q → ¬p. Since we know that ¬q is true, we can conclude that ¬p is also true, which means p is false.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nb) p is false"
