    "message_1": "Let A = {1,2,3,4} and B = {4,5,6,7}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, and then find the intersection of A and B. Finally, show that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the intersection of A and B.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nSymmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B, can be found using the formula: A Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nA ∩ B = {4}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} - {4} = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nIntersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B:\n\nA ∩ B = {4}\n\nNow, we need to show that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the intersection of A and B. The distributive property states that for any sets A, B, and C:\n\nA Δ (B ∩ C) = (A Δ B) ∩ (A Δ C)\n\nHowever, this property is not applicable in this case, as we only have two sets A and B. The distributive property requires three sets to be demonstrated. Therefore, we cannot show that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the intersection of A and B with the given information."
