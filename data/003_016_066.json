    "message_1": "A sinusoidal wave is represented by the equation y = 2sin(2x - pi/4). What is the phase shift of this wave?",
    "message_2": "The general equation for a sinusoidal wave is y = A*sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn the given equation, y = 2sin(2x - pi/4), we can see that A = 2, B = 2, and C = pi/4. The phase shift of this wave is C, which is pi/4 or Ï€/4."
