    "message_1": "A simple problem that would help a math student understand how to use Fourier transform to analyze the stability of systems is:\n\nGiven a differential equation of motion for an undamped spring-mass system as: \n\n$m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + kx = 0$\n\nwhere, m = 2kg, k = 5N/m, and the initial displacement and velocity are $x(0) = 5m$ and $\\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = 2m/s$\n\nUsing the Fourier transform, determine the stability of the system by calculating the amplitude ratio and phase angle.",
    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the given differential equation in terms of the angular frequency $\\omega$:\n\n$\\omega^2 = \\frac{k}{m}$\n\nGiven the values for m and k, we can find the angular frequency:\n\n$\\omega^2 = \\frac{5}{2} \\Rightarrow \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}$\n\nNow, let's assume a solution of the form:\n\n$x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$\n\nWe can find the initial conditions:\n\n$x(0) = A\\cos(\\phi) = 5$\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = -A\\omega\\sin(\\phi) = 2$\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, A and $\\phi$:\n\n$A\\cos(\\phi) = 5$\n\n$-A\\omega\\sin(\\phi) = 2$\n\nWe can solve for the amplitude ratio A and phase angle $\\phi$:\n\nDivide the second equation by the first equation:\n\n$-\\omega\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac{2}{5}$\n\n$\\tan(\\phi) = -\\frac{2}{5\\omega}$\n\n$\\phi = \\arctan\\left(-\\frac{2}{5\\omega}\\right)$\n\nNow, we can find A using the first equation:\n\n$A = \\frac{5}{\\cos(\\phi)}$\n\nNow that we have the amplitude ratio A and the phase angle $\\phi$, we can analyze the stability of the system. Since the system is undamped, it will oscillate indefinitely with a constant amplitude A. Therefore, the system is stable but not asymptotically stable."
