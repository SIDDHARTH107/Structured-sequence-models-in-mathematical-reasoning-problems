    "message_2": "To show that f(z) is an analytic function, we need to show that it is differentiable in the complex plane. We can do this by finding the partial derivatives with respect to the real and imaginary parts of z and checking if they satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations.\n\nLet z = x + iy, where x and y are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit. Then we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = 3(x + iy)^2 - 2i(x + iy) = 3(x^2 + 2ixy - y^2) - 2ix - 2y\n     = (3x^2 - 6xy + 3y^2) + i(6xy - 2y - 2x)\n\nNow we can find the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∂f/∂x = ∂u/∂x + i ∂v/∂x = (6x - 6y) + i(6y - 2)\n∂f/∂y = ∂u/∂y + i ∂v/∂y = (6y - 6x) + i(6x + 2)\n\nNow we check if the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y => 6x - 6y = 6x + 2\n∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x => 6y - 6x = 6y - 2\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so f(z) is an analytic function.\n\nNow we can find the derivative f'(z) using the partial derivatives:\n\nf'(z) = ∂f/∂x = (6x - 6y) + i(6y - 2)\n\nIn terms of z, we can rewrite f'(z) as:\n\nf'(z) = 6(x - y + i(y - 1/3))\n\nSo, f'(z) = 6(z - 1/3i)."
