    "message_2": "To solve this system of modular equations using the Chinese remainder theorem, we first find the product of the moduli: N = 3 * 5 * 7 = 105.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products:\nN1 = N/3 = 105/3 = 35\nN2 = N/5 = 105/5 = 21\nN3 = N/7 = 105/7 = 15\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products:\ny1 ≡ N1^(-1) (mod 3) => 35^(-1) (mod 3)\ny2 ≡ N2^(-1) (mod 5) => 21^(-1) (mod 5)\ny3 ≡ N3^(-1) (mod 7) => 15^(-1) (mod 7)\n\nBy trying out different values, we find the modular inverses:\ny1 = 2 (since 35 * 2 ≡ 1 (mod 3))\ny2 = 1 (since 21 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\ny3 = 1 (since 15 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\n\nNow, we can compute the solution x:\nx = (a1 * N1 * y1) + (a2 * N2 * y2) + (a3 * N3 * y3)\nx = (1 * 35 * 2) + (2 * 21 * 1) + (4 * 15 * 1)\nx = 70 + 42 + 60\nx = 172\n\nSince 172 is larger than the product of the moduli (105), we need to find the smallest positive integer that is congruent to 172 modulo 105:\nx ≡ 172 (mod 105)\nx = 172 - 105\nx = 67\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies all three congruences is 67."
