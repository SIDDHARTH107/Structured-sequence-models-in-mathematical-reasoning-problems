    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order differential equation y' = 2xy, we can use the method of separation of variables. We rewrite the equation as:\n\ndy/dx = 2xy\n\nNow, we separate the variables:\n\ndy/y = 2x dx\n\nNext, we integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/y) dy = ∫(2x) dx\n\nln|y| = x^2 + C₁\n\nTo solve for y, we take the exponent of both sides:\n\ny = e^(x^2 + C₁)\n\nNow, we can rewrite e^(C₁) as a constant C:\n\ny = Ce^(x^2)\n\nWe are given the initial condition y(0) = 1. We can use this to find the value of C:\n\n1 = Ce^(0^2)\n\n1 = C\n\nSo, our particular solution is:\n\ny = e^(x^2)\n\nNow, we can find the value of y when x = 1:\n\ny(1) = e^(1^2)\n\ny(1) = e\n\nThus, the value of y when x = 1 is y(1) = e."
