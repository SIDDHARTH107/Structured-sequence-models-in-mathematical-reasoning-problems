    "message_2": "The given partial differential equation is:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\bar{z}} = 0$$\n\nThis equation states that the derivative of the function u with respect to the complex conjugate of z, $\\bar{z}$, is zero. In other words, the function u does not change with respect to $\\bar{z}$. Therefore, u must be a function of z only, and not of $\\bar{z}$. We can write this as:\n\n$$u = f(z)$$\n\nwhere f is an arbitrary function of z. Now, we need to find the specific function f(z) that satisfies the initial condition:\n\n$$u(0,z) = e^{-|z|^2}$$\n\nSince u is a function of z only, we can write the initial condition as:\n\n$$f(z) = e^{-|z|^2}$$\n\nThus, the solution to the partial differential equation is:\n\n$$u(z, \\bar{z}) = e^{-|z|^2}$$"
