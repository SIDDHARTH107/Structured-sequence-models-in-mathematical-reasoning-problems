    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer value of x that satisfies both congruences, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. \n\nLet's consider the given congruences:\n1) x ≡ 3 (mod 5)\n2) x ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n\nFirst, find the product of the moduli: N = 5 * 7 = 35\n\nNext, calculate N_i for each congruence, where N_i = N / n_i:\nN_1 = 35 / 5 = 7\nN_2 = 35 / 7 = 5\n\nNow, find the modular inverse of each N_i (mod n_i):\n1) y_1 ≡ N_1^(-1) (mod 5) => 7y_1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2) y_2 ≡ N_2^(-1) (mod 7) => 5y_2 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSolving these congruences, we get:\n1) y_1 ≡ 3 (mod 5)\n2) y_2 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can find the solution for x:\nx = (a_1 * N_1 * y_1) + (a_2 * N_2 * y_2) (mod N)\nx = (3 * 7 * 3) + (4 * 5 * 3) (mod 35)\nx = 63 + 60 (mod 35)\nx = 123 (mod 35)\nx ≡ 18 (mod 35)\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer value of x that satisfies both congruences is x = 18."
