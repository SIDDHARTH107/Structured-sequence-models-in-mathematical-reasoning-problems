    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a right circular cone, we need to calculate the lateral surface area and the base area, and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's find the slant height (l) of the cone. We can use the Pythagorean theorem since we have a right triangle formed by the height, base radius, and slant height. Let h be the height, r be the base radius, and l be the slant height.\n\nh^2 + r^2 = l^2\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n16^2 + 8^2 = l^2\n256 + 64 = l^2\n320 = l^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the slant height:\n\nl = √320 ≈ 17.89 cm\n\nNow, let's find the lateral surface area (LSA) of the cone. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cone is:\n\nLSA = π * r * l\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nLSA ≈ 3.14 * 8 * 17.89 ≈ 450.24 cm^2\n\nNext, let's find the base area (BA) of the cone. The formula for the area of a circle is:\n\nBA = π * r^2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nBA ≈ 3.14 * 8^2 ≈ 3.14 * 64 ≈ 201.06 cm^2\n\nFinally, let's find the total surface area (SA) of the cone by adding the lateral surface area and the base area:\n\nSA = LSA + BA\nSA ≈ 450.24 + 201.06 ≈ 651.30 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 651.30 cm^2, correct to two decimal places."
