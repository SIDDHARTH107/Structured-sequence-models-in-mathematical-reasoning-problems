    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph G, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color its edges, meaning that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the graph G, denoted by Δ(G). Since there are 13 edges and 8 vertices, the maximum degree cannot be more than 13/4 = 3.25. Therefore, Δ(G) must be either 3 or 4.\n\nNow, let's use Vizing's theorem, which states that for any graph G, Δ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1.\n\nCase 1: Δ(G) = 3\nIn this case, Vizing's theorem tells us that 3 ≤ χ'(G) ≤ 4. Since the graph has an odd degree, it cannot be 3-regular (meaning all vertices have degree 3), so it must have at least one vertex with degree 4. Therefore, χ'(G) cannot be 3, and we conclude that χ'(G) = 4.\n\nCase 2: Δ(G) = 4\nIn this case, Vizing's theorem tells us that 4 ≤ χ'(G) ≤ 5. Since the graph has an even degree, it could be 4-regular, meaning all vertices have degree 4. In this case, χ'(G) = 4.\n\nIn both cases, the chromatic index of graph G is 4."
