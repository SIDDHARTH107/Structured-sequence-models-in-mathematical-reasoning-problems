(Hint: The area under the curve can be represented by the definite integral of the function of the tank's cross-sectional area with respect to the height of the water.)",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of water required to fill the tank to a depth of 8 meters, we can use the formula for the volume of a cone: V = (1/3)πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius of the water-filled cone at a depth of 8 meters. Since the tank is an inverted cone, the radius decreases linearly with the height. We can set up a proportion to find the radius at a depth of 8 meters:\n\n(5 meters) / (10 meters) = r / (8 meters)\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = (5 meters) * (8 meters) / (10 meters)\nr = 4 meters\n\nNow we can find the volume of the water-filled cone with a height of 8 meters and a radius of 4 meters:\n\nV = (1/3)π(4 meters)^2(8 meters)\nV = (1/3)π(16 square meters)(8 meters)\nV = (128/3)π cubic meters\n\nTherefore, the volume of water required to fill the tank to a depth of 8 meters is (128/3)π cubic meters."
