    "message_2": "A topological space X is said to be connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. In other words, X is connected if the only subsets of X that are both open and closed are the empty set and X itself.\n\nLet's examine the given topology on X:\n\nT = {∅, {0}, {2, 3}, {0, 2, 3}, {0, 1, 2, 3}}\n\nWe can see that the sets {0} and {2, 3} are both open in this topology. Additionally, their complements in X are also open:\n\nX \\ {0} = {1, 2, 3} is not in T, but X \\ {2, 3} = {0, 1} is not in T either.\n\nHowever, we can express X as the union of two disjoint non-empty sets, where one set is open and the other is closed:\n\nX = {0} ∪ {1, 2, 3}\n\nHere, {0} is open in T and {1, 2, 3} is the complement of the open set {0} in X, so it is closed. Since we can represent X as the union of two disjoint non-empty sets, one open and one closed, the space X is not connected."
