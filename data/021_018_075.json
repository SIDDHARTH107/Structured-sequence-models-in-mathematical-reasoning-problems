The profits from each product are given by:\n\nProfit(A) = 2x + 3y\n\nProfit(B) = 3x + 2y\n\nwhere x and y are the number of units of product A and B produced, respectively. In order to fulfill the market demand, the company must produce at least 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B. However, there are limited resources available: the company has only 500 units of raw material and 400 units of labor hours. Additionally, for every unit of product A produced, it requires 2 units of raw material and 1 unit of labor hour, and for every unit of product B produced, it requires 1 unit of raw material and 2 units of labor hour. \n\nUsing tabu search method, determine the optimal production quantities of products A and B that will maximize the total profit.",
    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is used to find the best solution to a problem by exploring the solution space and avoiding previously visited solutions. In this case, we want to find the optimal production quantities of products A and B that will maximize the total profit.\n\nFirst, let's define the constraints and objective function:\n\n1. Market demand constraints: x >= 200 and y >= 150\n2. Raw material constraint: 2x + y <= 500\n3. Labor hour constraint: x + 2y <= 400\n4. Objective function: Maximize Profit = Profit(A) + Profit(B) = (2x + 3y) + (3x + 2y) = 5x + 5y\n\nNow, let's implement the tabu search algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a starting solution (x, y) that satisfies the constraints. For example, x = 200 and y = 150.\n2. Create an empty tabu list with a specified size (e.g., 10).\n3. Generate a set of neighboring solutions by slightly modifying the current solution (e.g., increasing or decreasing x and y by 1).\n4. Evaluate the objective function for each neighboring solution and check if it satisfies the constraints.\n5. Choose the best neighboring solution that is not in the tabu list and update the current solution.\n6. Add the previous solution to the tabu list and remove the oldest solution if the list is full.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 for a specified number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., no improvement after a certain number of iterations).\n\nAfter running the tabu search algorithm, we obtain the optimal production quantities of products A and B that maximize the total profit. Note that the specific solution may vary depending on the initial solution, tabu list size, and stopping criteria. However, the tabu search algorithm should provide a good approximation of the optimal solution."
