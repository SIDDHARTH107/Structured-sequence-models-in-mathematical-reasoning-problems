    "message_2": "To solve the equation (4 - 3i)x - (1 + i) = (3 + 2i)x + (10 - i) for x, we first move all the terms containing x to one side of the equation and all the constant terms to the other side.\n\n(4 - 3i)x - (3 + 2i)x = (10 - i) + (1 + i)\n\nNow, we factor out x from the left side of the equation:\n\nx[(4 - 3i) - (3 + 2i)] = 11\n\nNow, we simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n\nx[(4 - 3i) - (3 + 2i)] = 11\nx[(4 - 3i - 3 - 2i)] = 11\nx[(1 - 5i)] = 11\n\nNow, we divide both sides of the equation by (1 - 5i) to solve for x:\n\nx = 11 / (1 - 5i)\n\nTo get x in the form of a + bi, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is (1 + 5i):\n\nx = (11 * (1 + 5i)) / ((1 - 5i) * (1 + 5i))\n\nNow, we multiply the numerators and denominators:\n\nx = (11 + 55i) / (1 + 25)\n\nx = (11 + 55i) / 26\n\nFinally, we have x in the form of a + bi:\n\nx = (11/26) + (55/26)i"
