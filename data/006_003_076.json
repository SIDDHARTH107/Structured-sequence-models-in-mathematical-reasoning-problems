    "message_2": "To find the probability of drawing a king from a standard deck of 52 cards when drawing three cards one after the other without replacement, we can use the complementary probability. That is, we will find the probability of not drawing any king in the three cards and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThere are 4 kings in a standard deck of 52 cards, so there are 48 cards that are not kings.\n\nThe probability of not drawing a king on the first draw is 48/52 (since there are 48 non-king cards and 52 total cards).\n\nAfter drawing one card, there are 51 cards left in the deck. The probability of not drawing a king on the second draw is 47/51 (since there are 47 non-king cards left and 51 total cards left).\n\nAfter drawing two cards, there are 50 cards left in the deck. The probability of not drawing a king on the third draw is 46/50 (since there are 46 non-king cards left and 50 total cards left).\n\nNow, we multiply these probabilities together to find the probability of not drawing any king in the three cards:\n\n(48/52) * (47/51) * (46/50) ≈ 0.6588\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of drawing at least one king in the three cards:\n\n1 - 0.6588 ≈ 0.3412\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a king from a standard deck of 52 cards when drawing three cards one after the other without replacement is approximately 0.3412 or 34.12%."
