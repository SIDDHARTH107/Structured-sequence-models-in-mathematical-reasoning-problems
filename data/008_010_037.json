And we will multiply the first row by -1 and subtract it from the third row.\n\nFirst row * 2: |  4   6  -2 |  2 |\nFirst row * -1: | -2  -3   1 | -1 |\n\nNew augmented matrix:\n\n|  2   3  -1 |  1 |\n|  0  -8   5 | -8 |\n|  0   0   1 |  6 |\n\nStep 2: Now we will eliminate y from the second row.\n\nTo do this, we will divide the second row by -8.\n\nSecond row / -8: |  0   1  -5/8 | 1 |\n\nNew augmented matrix:\n\n|  2   3  -1 |  1 |\n|  0   1  -5/8 | 1 |\n|  0   0   1 |  6 |\n\nStep 3: Now we will back-substitute to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 6.\n\nNow, we will substitute z into the second row to find y:\n\ny - 5/8 * 6 = 1\ny - 15/4 = 1\ny = 1 + 15/4\ny = 4 + 3/4\ny = 19/4\n\nFinally, we will substitute y and z into the first row to find x:\n\n2x + 3 * 19/4 - 6 = 1\n2x + 57/4 - 6 = 1\n2x + 57/4 - 24/4 = 1\n2x + 33/4 = 1\n2x = 1 - 33/4\n2x = -29/4\nx = -29/8\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -29/8\ny = 19/4\nz = 6"
