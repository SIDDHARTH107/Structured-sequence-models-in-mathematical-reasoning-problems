So, we are looking for the smallest prime number p such that (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p.\n\nLet's check the smallest prime numbers:\n\nFor p = 2, (2-1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is divisible by 2.\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer n such that (n-1)! + 1 is divisible by n, according to Wilson's Theorem, is n = 2."
