    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 7^20 is divided by 11, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. We will find the remainder of 7^20 modulo 11.\n\nFirst, let's find the remainders of the powers of 7 modulo 11:\n\n7^1 ≡ 7 (mod 11)\n7^2 ≡ 49 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n7^3 ≡ 7 * 5 ≡ 35 ≡ 2 (mod 11)\n7^4 ≡ 7 * 2 ≡ 14 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n7^5 ≡ 7 * 3 ≡ 21 ≡ 10 (mod 11)\n7^6 ≡ 7 * 10 ≡ 70 ≡ 6 (mod 11)\n7^7 ≡ 7 * 6 ≡ 42 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n7^8 ≡ 7 * 9 ≡ 63 ≡ 8 (mod 11)\n7^9 ≡ 7 * 8 ≡ 56 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nNotice that 7^9 ≡ 1 (mod 11). This means that every 9th power of 7 will have a remainder of 1 when divided by 11.\n\nNow, we can write 7^20 as (7^9)^2 * 7^2. Since 7^9 ≡ 1 (mod 11), we have:\n\n(7^9)^2 * 7^2 ≡ 1^2 * 5 ≡ 1 * 5 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^20 is divided by 11 is 5."
