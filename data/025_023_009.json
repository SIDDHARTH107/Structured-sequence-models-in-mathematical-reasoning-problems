This can be done by intersecting $Y$ with the $(n-k)$-fold intersection product of $L$ on $X$. More precisely, we want to compute the intersection number $Y \\cdot L^{n-k}$.\n\n3. The degree of the class $[Y]$ in $IH^{2k}(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is given by the self-intersection number computed in step 2.\n\nLet's go through these steps in more detail.\n\n1. Choose an ample line bundle $L$ on $X$. By the ampleness of $L$, the intersection product $L^{n-k}$ is well-defined and gives a homology class in $H_{2(n-k)}(X, \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n2. Compute the self-intersection number of $Y$ with respect to $L$. Since $Y$ is a smooth subvariety of dimension $k$, the intersection product $Y \\cdot L^{n-k}$ is well-defined and gives a homology class in $H_{2k}(X, \\mathbb{Q})$. By the Poincar√© duality, this homology class corresponds to a cohomology class in $H^{2k}(X, \\mathbb{Q})$. By the Gysin map, this cohomology class is the image of the fundamental class $[Y]$ under the pushforward map $p_*: IH^{2k}(Y, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to IH^{2k}(X, \\mathbb{Q})$. Therefore, the self-intersection number $Y \\cdot L^{n-k}$ is equal to the degree of the class $[Y]$ in $IH^{2k}(X, \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n3. The degree of the class $[Y]$ in $IH^{2k}(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is given by the self-intersection number computed in step 2. This is the desired result.\n\nIn summary, to determine the degree of the class $[Y]$ in the intersection cohomology group $IH^{2k}(X, \\mathbb{Q})$, we can compute the self-intersection number of $Y$ with respect to an ample line bundle $L$ on $X$. This self-intersection number is equal to the degree of the class $[Y]$ in $IH^{2k}(X, \\mathbb{Q})$."
