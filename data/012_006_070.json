    "message_2": "To determine whether there exists an Eulerian path in G, we need to check the degrees of the vertices. An Eulerian path exists if and only if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree, and all other vertices have an even degree.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information about the specific graph G to determine the degrees of its vertices. Therefore, we cannot determine whether there exists an Eulerian path in G or provide one.\n\nAs for the Hamiltonian path, it is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. Unfortunately, determining whether a Hamiltonian path exists in a general graph is an NP-complete problem, meaning there is no known efficient algorithm to solve it. Without more information about the specific graph G, we cannot determine whether there exists a Hamiltonian path in G or provide one."
