    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two models of smartphones: Model X and Model Y. Each Model X smartphone generates $40 in profit while each Model Y smartphone generates $60 in profit. The production process involves the use of two machines: Machine A and Machine B. Each Model X smartphone requires 2 hours of Machine A and 1 hour of Machine B, while each Model Y smartphone requires 1 hour of Machine A and 2 hours of Machine B.\n\nMachine A operates for a maximum of 60 hours per week, while Machine B operates for a maximum of 50 hours per week. The company wants to maximize its profit.\n\nWhat is the optimal number of Model X and Model Y smartphones that the company should produce each week to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Model X smartphones produced and y be the number of Model Y smartphones produced. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 40x + 60y, subject to the constraints of the machines' operating hours.\n\nThe constraints are:\n2x + y ≤ 60 (Machine A)\nx + 2y ≤ 50 (Machine B)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negative production)\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints as:\ny ≤ -2x + 60\ny ≤ -0.5x + 25\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the graphical method by plotting these constraints on a graph and finding the feasible region. The vertices of the feasible region are the points where the constraints intersect. We then evaluate the profit function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\nA: (0, 0)\nB: (0, 25)\nC: (20, 20)\nD: (30, 0)\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\nP(A) = 40(0) + 60(0) = $0\nP(B) = 40(0) + 60(25) = $1500\nP(C) = 40(20) + 60(20) = $2000\nP(D) = 40(30) + 60(0) = $1200\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex C, with the production of 20 Model X smartphones and 20 Model Y smartphones. The maximum profit is $2000 per week."
