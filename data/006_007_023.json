    "message_2": "To find the expected change in the stock price, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected Change = (Probability of Increase * Increase Amount) + (Probability of Decrease * Decrease Amount)\n\nIn this case, the probability of increase is 0.4 and the increase amount is $10. The probability of decrease is 0.6 and the decrease amount is -$10.\n\nExpected Change = (0.4 * $10) + (0.6 * -$10)\nExpected Change = ($4) + (-$6)\nExpected Change = -$2\n\nSo, the expected change in the stock price in the next month is -$2."
