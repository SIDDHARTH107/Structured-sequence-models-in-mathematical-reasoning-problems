    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle/360) × π × radius²\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 5 cm and the central angle is 60 degrees, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (60/360) × π × 5²\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 25\n\nArea of sector = (25π)/6\n\nThe area of the sector is (25π)/6 square centimeters."
