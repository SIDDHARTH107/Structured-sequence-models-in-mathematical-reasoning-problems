    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral ∫C sinz/(z-π) dz, we can use the residue theorem. The residue theorem states that for a function f(z) that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C, the integral of f(z) around C is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues of f(z) at its poles inside C.\n\nIn this case, f(z) = sinz/(z-π). The function sinz has zeros at z = nπ, where n is an integer, and the function (z-π) has a pole at z = π. Since the contour C is a unit circle centered at the origin, it encloses the origin but does not enclose the pole at z = π. Therefore, there are no poles of f(z) inside the contour C.\n\nSince there are no poles of f(z) inside the contour C, the sum of the residues of f(z) at its poles inside C is zero. According to the residue theorem, the integral of f(z) around C is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues, which is 2πi times 0.\n\nThus, the integral ∫C sinz/(z-π) dz = 0."
