    "message_2": "To partition the number 10 into positive integers, we can use the partition function, which is denoted as p(n). The partition function p(n) represents the number of ways to partition the integer n into positive integers. \n\nFor the number 10, p(10) = 42. \n\nSo, there are 42 ways to partition the number 10 into positive integers."
