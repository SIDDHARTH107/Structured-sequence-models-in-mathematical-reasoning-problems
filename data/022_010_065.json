    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion for the function f(z) = 1/(z+2) centered at z = 1, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z-1) and then use the geometric series formula.\n\nLet's make a substitution: w = z - 1, so z = w + 1. Then, the function becomes:\n\nf(w) = 1/((w+1)+2) = 1/(w+3)\n\nNow, we want to rewrite the denominator in the form of 1 - (-x), where x is a function of w:\n\n1/(w+3) = 1/(1 - (-w-2))\n\nNow we can use the geometric series formula:\n\n1/(1-x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...\n\nIn our case, x = -w-2:\n\n1/(1 - (-w-2)) = 1 + (-w-2) + (-w-2)^2 + (-w-2)^3 + ...\n\nNow, we substitute back z = w + 1:\n\n1/(1 - (-(z-1)-2)) = 1 + (-(z-1)-2) + (-(z-1)-2)^2 + (-(z-1)-2)^3 + ...\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion for the function f(z) = 1/(z+2) centered at z = 1:\n\n1 + (-(z-1)-2) + (-(z-1)-2)^2 + (-(z-1)-2)^3 + ...\n\nNow, let's determine the largest annulus in which the series converges. The geometric series converges when |x| < 1. In our case, x = -(z-1)-2:\n\n|- (z-1) - 2| < 1\n\n|-z + 1 - 2| < 1\n\n|-z - 1| < 1\n\nSince the center of the annulus is at z = 1, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n0 < |z - 1| < 2\n\nThis inequality represents the largest annulus with center at z = 1 in which the Laurent series converges. The annulus is given by 0 < |z - 1| < 2."
