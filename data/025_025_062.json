    "message_2": "First, let's find a basis for A and B as k-vector spaces.\n\nA = R/(xy) = k[x, y]/(x^2, y^2, xy)\nA basis for A as a k-vector space is {1, x, y}, since x^2, y^2, and xy are all zero in A.\n\nB = R/(x + y) = k[x, y]/(x^2, y^2, x + y)\nTo find a basis for B, we can make a substitution: let z = x + y. Then, x = z - y and y = z - x. We can rewrite the relations in terms of z:\nx^2 = (z - y)^2 = z^2 - 2zy + y^2 = 0\ny^2 = (z - x)^2 = z^2 - 2zx + x^2 = 0\nx + y = z = 0\n\nNow, B = k[x, y]/(z^2 - 2zy, z^2 - 2zx, z)\nA basis for B as a k-vector space is {1, z}.\n\nNow we want to find the dimension of Hom(A, B) over k. A homomorphism f: A -> B is determined by its action on the basis elements of A. Since f is a k-linear map, we have:\n\nf(1) = a1 * 1 + a2 * z for some a1, a2 in k\nf(x) = b1 * 1 + b2 * z for some b1, b2 in k\nf(y) = c1 * 1 + c2 * z for some c1, c2 in k\n\nWe need to find the conditions on a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, and c2 for f to be a homomorphism. Since f is a homomorphism, we have:\n\nf(xy) = f(0) = 0\nf(x^2) = f(0) = 0\nf(y^2) = f(0) = 0\n\nNow, f(xy) = f(x)f(y) = (b1 * 1 + b2 * z)(c1 * 1 + c2 * z) = (b1c1) * 1 + (b1c2 + b2c1) * z + b2c2 * z^2. Since z^2 = 2zx in B, we have:\n\n(b1c1) * 1 + (b1c2 + b2c1) * z + b2c2 * 2zx = 0\n\nThis implies that b1c1 = 0, b1c2 + b2c1 = 0, and b2c2 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, f(x^2) = f(x)f(x) = (b1 * 1 + b2 * z)^2 = b1^2 * 1 + 2b1b2 * z + b2^2 * z^2 = b1^2 * 1 + 2b1b2 * z + b2^2 * 2zx = 0, which implies that b1^2 = 0, 2b1b2 = 0, and b2^2 = 0.\n\nAnd, f(y^2) = f(y)f(y) = (c1 * 1 + c2 * z)^2 = c1^2 * 1 + 2c1c2 * z + c2^2 * z^2 = c1^2 * 1 + 2c1c2 * z + c2^2 * 2zy = 0, which implies that c1^2 = 0, 2c1c2 = 0, and c2^2 = 0.\n\nSince k is a field, the only solutions to these equations are:\n\nb1 = b2 = c1 = c2 = 0\n\nThis means that f(x) = f(y) = 0, and f is determined by its action on the basis element 1:\n\nf(1) = a1 * 1 + a2 * z\n\nSo, there are two degrees of freedom in choosing a1 and a2. Therefore, the dimension of Hom(A, B) over k is 2."
