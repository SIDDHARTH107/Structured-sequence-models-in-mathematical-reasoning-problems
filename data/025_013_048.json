    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian of the curve C, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. Let F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 2x - 1. Then, the Jacobian matrix J is given by:\n\nJ = [∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y]\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 - 2\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix J is:\n\nJ = [-3x^2 - 2, 2y]\n\nNow, let's analyze the properties of the Jacobian:\n\n1. Singular points: Singular points on the curve C are the points where the Jacobian matrix has rank less than the dimension of the curve (which is 1 in this case). This occurs when both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n-3x^2 - 2 = 0 => x^2 = -2/3 (no real solutions)\n2y = 0 => y = 0\n\nSince there are no real solutions for x, there are no singular points on the curve C.\n\n2. Smooth points: Smooth points on the curve C are the points where the Jacobian matrix has full rank (which is 1 in this case). This occurs when at least one of the partial derivatives is non-zero. Since we have already determined that there are no singular points, all points on the curve C are smooth points.\n\nIn conclusion, the Jacobian of the curve C is given by J = [-3x^2 - 2, 2y], and the curve has no singular points. All points on the curve are smooth points."
