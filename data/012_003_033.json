    "message_2": "An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. To find the maximum number of vertices that can be included in an independent set in G, we can use a greedy algorithm.\n\nFirst, let's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, corresponding to the rows and columns of the adjacency matrix.\n\n1. Start with an empty set, and add vertex A to the set.\n2. Move to vertex B. Since B is adjacent to A, we cannot add B to the set.\n3. Move to vertex C. C is adjacent to A, so we cannot add C to the set.\n4. Move to vertex D. D is not adjacent to A, so we can add D to the set.\n5. Move to vertex E. E is adjacent to both A and D, so we cannot add E to the set.\n6. Move to vertex F. F is adjacent to A and D, so we cannot add F to the set.\n7. Move to vertex G. G is not adjacent to A or D, so we can add G to the set.\n\nThe maximum independent set we found is {A, D, G}, which has 3 vertices. Therefore, the maximum number of vertices that can be included in an independent set in G is 3."
