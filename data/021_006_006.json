    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM) with a uniform mesh size of h = 0.25, we first need to discretize the domain and create a mesh. The domain is a square with side length 1, so we will have 5 nodes in each direction (x and y), resulting in a total of 25 nodes. The nodes are numbered from left to right and bottom to top.\n\nNow, we need to define the basis functions. Since we are using linear elements, we will use the hat functions as basis functions. The hat function corresponding to node i is denoted by N_i(x,y), and it is equal to 1 at node i and 0 at all other nodes.\n\nThe weak form of the given PDE is obtained by multiplying the PDE by a test function v(x,y) and integrating over the domain:\n\n∫∫(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)v dxdy = ∫∫4v dxdy\n\nWe approximate the solution u(x,y) as a linear combination of the basis functions:\n\nu(x,y) ≈ ΣU_i * N_i(x,y)\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the weak form and applying the Galerkin method, we get:\n\nΣU_i * ∫∫(∂²N_i/∂x² + ∂²N_i/∂y²)v dxdy = ∫∫4v dxdy\n\nThis equation must hold for all test functions v(x,y). We choose v(x,y) = N_j(x,y) for j = 1, 2, ..., 25. This gives us a system of linear equations:\n\nΣU_i * K_ij = F_j\n\nwhere K_ij = ∫∫(∂²N_i/∂x² + ∂²N_i/∂y²)N_j dxdy and F_j = ∫∫4N_j dxdy.\n\nWe can assemble the stiffness matrix K and the load vector F by calculating the integrals for each pair of nodes (i, j). Note that the stiffness matrix K will be sparse, as the basis functions have compact support.\n\nSince the boundary conditions are homogeneous (u(x,0) = u(x,1) = u(0,y) = u(1,y) = 0), we can eliminate the boundary nodes from the system of equations. This leaves us with a smaller system of equations for the interior nodes.\n\nAfter solving the reduced system of equations, we can find the numerical solution for u(0.5,0.5) by evaluating the approximation at that point:\n\nu(0.5,0.5) ≈ ΣU_i * N_i(0.5,0.5)\n\nThe exact values of the stiffness matrix K and load vector F depend on the specific basis functions used, and their calculation involves integration over the elements. This can be done using numerical integration techniques, such as the Gaussian quadrature. Once the stiffness matrix and load vector are computed, the linear system can be solved using standard techniques, such as the conjugate gradient method or direct solvers like LU decomposition.\n\nIn summary, the finite element method involves the following steps:\n\n1. Discretize the domain and create a mesh.\n2. Define the basis functions and approximate the solution.\n3. Derive the weak form of the PDE and apply the Galerkin method.\n4. Assemble the stiffness matrix and load vector.\n5. Apply the boundary conditions and solve the reduced system of equations.\n6. Evaluate the numerical solution at the desired point."
