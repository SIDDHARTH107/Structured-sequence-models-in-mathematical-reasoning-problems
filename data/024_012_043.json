    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star operator of the given 2-form $\\omega$, we first need to recall the definition of the Hodge star operator. For a k-form $\\alpha$ on an n-dimensional manifold M with a metric g, the Hodge star operator is defined as:\n\n$*(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\wedge \\beta$,\n\nwhere $\\beta$ is the unique (n-k)-form such that\n\n$\\alpha \\wedge \\beta = \\langle \\alpha, \\alpha \\rangle \\mathrm{vol}_g$,\n\nand $\\mathrm{vol}_g$ is the volume form associated with the metric g.\n\nIn our case, we have a 2-form $\\omega$ on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with the standard Euclidean metric. The volume form for the standard Euclidean metric is $\\mathrm{vol}_g = dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$. Since we are working with a 2-form in a 3-dimensional space, the Hodge star operator will map $\\omega$ to a 1-form.\n\nNow, let's compute the Hodge star of $\\omega$. We want to find a 1-form $\\beta$ such that\n\n$\\omega \\wedge \\beta = \\langle \\omega, \\omega \\rangle \\mathrm{vol}_g$.\n\nWe can write $\\beta = A dx + B dy + C dz$ for some functions A, B, and C. Then,\n\n$\\omega \\wedge \\beta = (x^2\\,dy\\wedge dz + y^2\\,dx\\wedge dz) \\wedge (A dx + B dy + C dz)$.\n\nUsing the properties of the wedge product, we get\n\n$\\omega \\wedge \\beta = (x^2 C - y^2 A) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$.\n\nNow, we need to compute the inner product $\\langle \\omega, \\omega \\rangle$. Since the metric is Euclidean, this is simply the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the 2-form:\n\n$\\langle \\omega, \\omega \\rangle = x^4 + y^4$.\n\nThus, we want to find A, B, and C such that\n\n$(x^2 C - y^2 A) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz = (x^4 + y^4) dx \\wedge dy \\wedge dz$.\n\nComparing coefficients, we see that\n\n$A = -y^2$,\n$B = 0$, and\n$C = x^2$.\n\nTherefore, the Hodge star of $\\omega$ is given by\n\n$*\\omega = -y^2 dx + x^2 dz$."
