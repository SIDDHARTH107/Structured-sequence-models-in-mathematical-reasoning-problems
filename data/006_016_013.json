    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces 500 light bulbs per day. The probability that any given light bulb will be defective is 0.05. What is the probability that at most 25 light bulbs in a given day will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of light bulbs produced), k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of defective light bulbs), p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a light bulb being defective), and (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nWe want to find the probability that at most 25 light bulbs will be defective, which means we need to find the sum of the probabilities for 0 defective light bulbs, 1 defective light bulb, 2 defective light bulbs, ..., up to 25 defective light bulbs.\n\nMathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nP(X ≤ 25) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 25\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for n, p, and k into the binomial probability formula and calculate the sum:\n\nP(X ≤ 25) = Σ [(500 choose k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(500-k)] for k = 0 to 25\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so it's best to use a calculator or software that can handle binomial probability calculations. Using such a tool, we find that:\n\nP(X ≤ 25) ≈ 0.8912\n\nSo, the probability that at most 25 light bulbs in a given day will be defective is approximately 0.8912 or 89.12%."
