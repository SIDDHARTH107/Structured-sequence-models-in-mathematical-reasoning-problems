Find the rate of heat flow through the plate if the thermal conductivity of the metal is 100 W/mK.",
    "message_2": "To find the rate of heat flow through the plate, we need to use Fourier's Law of heat conduction, which states that the rate of heat flow (Q) is proportional to the temperature gradient (dT/dx) and the thermal conductivity (k) of the material:\n\nQ = -k * (dT/dx)\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the temperature distribution function T(x) with respect to x:\n\nT(x) = 50e^(-x/10) * cos(10πx)\n\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n\ndT/dx = d(50e^(-x/10))/dx * cos(10πx) + 50e^(-x/10) * d(cos(10πx))/dx\n\nNow, we find the derivatives of the individual functions:\n\nd(50e^(-x/10))/dx = -5e^(-x/10)\n\nd(cos(10πx))/dx = -10πsin(10πx)\n\nNow, substitute these derivatives back into the expression for dT/dx:\n\ndT/dx = -5e^(-x/10) * cos(10πx) - 50e^(-x/10) * 10πsin(10πx)\n\nNow, we can plug this expression for dT/dx into Fourier's Law:\n\nQ = -k * (dT/dx)\n\nGiven the thermal conductivity k = 100 W/mK, we have:\n\nQ = -100 * (-5e^(-x/10) * cos(10πx) - 50e^(-x/10) * 10πsin(10πx))\n\nQ = 500e^(-x/10) * cos(10πx) + 50000πe^(-x/10) * sin(10πx)\n\nThis is the rate of heat flow through the plate as a function of x, in watts per square meter (W/m²)."
