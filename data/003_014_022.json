    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2 cos(x) + 1 = 0, we first isolate the cosine function:\n\n2 cos(x) = -1\n\nNow, divide by 2:\n\ncos(x) = -1/2\n\nNow, we need to find all the values of x between 0 and 2π that satisfy this equation. The cosine function is negative in the second and third quadrants. The reference angle for cos(x) = 1/2 is π/3. So, the angles in the second and third quadrants that have a cosine of -1/2 are:\n\nx = 2π/3 (in the second quadrant)\nx = 4π/3 (in the third quadrant)\n\nSo, the values of x between 0 and 2π that satisfy the equation 2 cos(x) + 1 = 0 are x = 2π/3 and x = 4π/3."
