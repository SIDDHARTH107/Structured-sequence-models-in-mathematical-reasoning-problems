    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface Z = 3X² + 2Y² at the point (1,3,29), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. \n\nLet's parametrize the surface as follows:\nr(u,v) = (u, v, 3u^2 + 2v^2)\n\nNow, we find the first partial derivatives:\nr_u = (1, 0, 6u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 4v)\n\nNext, we find the second partial derivatives:\nr_uu = (0, 0, 6)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 4)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 36u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 0\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 16v^2\n\nAt the point (1,3,29), we have u=1 and v=3, so:\nE = 37\nF = 0\nG = 145\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\ne = r_uu • N = 6N_z\nf = r_uv • N = 0\ng = r_vv • N = 4N_z\n\nTo find the normal vector N, we compute the cross product of r_u and r_v:\nN = r_u × r_v = (-6u, -4v, 1)\n\nAt the point (1,3,29), we have N = (-6, -12, 1). We normalize N to get the unit normal vector:\n|N| = sqrt((-6)^2 + (-12)^2 + 1^2) = 13\nn = (-6/13, -12/13, 1/13)\n\nNow, we can find e, f, and g:\ne = 6(1/13) = 6/13\nf = 0\ng = 4(1/13) = 4/13\n\nFinally, we compute the mean curvature H:\nH = (1/(2*EG - 2*F^2)) * (eG + gE - 2fF)\nH = (1/(2*37*145)) * (6/13*145 + 4/13*37)\nH = (1/10730) * (870 + 148)\nH = 1018/10730\nH = 509/5365\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface Z = 3X² + 2Y² at the point (1,3,29) is H = 509/5365."
