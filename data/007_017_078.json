    "message_2": "Twin prime numbers are pairs of prime numbers that have a difference of 2. To find the first five pairs of twin prime numbers greater than 30, we can start by listing prime numbers greater than 30 and checking if they form twin prime pairs.\n\n1. (41, 43): Both 41 and 43 are prime numbers, and their difference is 2.\n2. (59, 61): Both 59 and 61 are prime numbers, and their difference is 2.\n3. (71, 73): Both 71 and 73 are prime numbers, and their difference is 2.\n4. (101, 103): Both 101 and 103 are prime numbers, and their difference is 2.\n5. (107, 109): Both 107 and 109 are prime numbers, and their difference is 2.\n\nSo, the first five pairs of twin prime numbers greater than 30 are (41, 43), (59, 61), (71, 73), (101, 103), and (107, 109)."
