The recorded speeds are:\n\n4.5, 4.7, 4.9, 5.2, 5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.8, 6.0\n\nUsing the bootstrapping method, estimate the 95% confidence interval for the mean running speed of all players on the soccer team.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the mean running speed using the bootstrapping method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the original sample.\n2. Generate a large number of bootstrap samples by resampling with replacement from the original sample.\n3. Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample.\n4. Find the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap sample means, which will give us the 95% confidence interval.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean of the original sample\nMean = (4.5 + 4.7 + 4.9 + 5.2 + 5.1 + 5.3 + 5.4 + 5.5 + 5.8 + 6.0) / 10 = 51.4 / 10 = 5.14 m/s\n\nStep 2: Generate a large number of bootstrap samples (let's say 1000) by resampling with replacement from the original sample. We will not actually list all 1000 samples here, but this would be done in practice using a computer program.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample. Again, we will not list all 1000 means here, but this would be done in practice using a computer program.\n\nStep 4: Find the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap sample means. Let's assume that after calculating the means of all 1000 bootstrap samples and sorting them in ascending order, we find that the 2.5th percentile is 4.95 m/s and the 97.5th percentile is 5.35 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the 95% confidence interval for the mean running speed of all players on the soccer team is approximately (4.95, 5.35) m/s."
