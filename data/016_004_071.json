    "message_2": "The main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is the largest bulb connected to the main body of the set. The equation for the cardioid is given by:\n\nr(θ) = 1 - cos(θ)\n\nTo find the area of the main cardioid, we can use the polar coordinate system and integrate the square of the radius function with respect to the angle θ from 0 to 2π:\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫[r(θ)]^2 dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫(1 - cos(θ))^2 dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nLet's expand the square:\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫(1 - 2cos(θ) + cos^2(θ)) dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, we can use the double-angle identity for cosine: cos^2(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫(1 - 2cos(θ) + (1 + cos(2θ))/2) dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫(2 - 2cos(θ) + 1 + cos(2θ))/2 dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫(3 + cos(2θ) - 2cos(θ))/2 dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\nArea = 1/2 * [3/2 * (θ - 0) + 1/4 * sin(2θ) - sin(θ)] from 0 to 2π\n\nArea = 1/2 * [3/2 * (2π - 0) + 1/4 * (sin(4π) - sin(0)) - (sin(2π) - sin(0))]\n\nArea = 1/2 * [3π + 0 - 0]\n\nArea = 3/2 * π\n\nArea ≈ 4.71\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is approximately 4.71 square units, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
