    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company has limited resources and can only produce a maximum of 500 units overall. The profit for each unit of Product A is $3, and the profit for each unit of Product B is $5.\n\nHowever, due to safety regulations, the production of Product A requires a special material that is limited to a maximum of 350 units. Additionally, the production of Product B requires a special machine that is only available for a maximum of 400 units. \n\nHow many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 3x + 5y, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 500 (total production constraint)\n2. x ≤ 350 (special material constraint for Product A)\n3. y ≤ 400 (special machine constraint for Product B)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 500 is the equation of a line with slope -1 and y-intercept 500. When x = 0, y = 500; when y = 0, x = 500.\n2. x = 350 is a vertical line at x = 350.\n3. y = 400 is a horizontal line at y = 400.\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 400), (350, 400), (350, 150), and (500, 0).\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 400) = 3(0) + 5(400) = 0 + 2000 = $2000\n2. P(350, 400) = 3(350) + 5(400) = 1050 + 2000 = $3050\n3. P(350, 150) = 3(350) + 5(150) = 1050 + 750 = $1800\n4. P(500, 0) = 3(500) + 5(0) = 1500 + 0 = $1500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 350 units of Product A and 400 units of Product B, resulting in a profit of $3050."
