    "message_2": "To determine the degree of the curve $C$, we need to find the degree of the homogeneous polynomial that defines it in the projective plane. To do this, we first homogenize the parametric equations of the curve.\n\nLet $x = X/Z$, $y = Y/Z$, and $t = T/Z$. Then, we have the following system of equations:\n\n$$x = \\frac{t^2 - 1}{1} = \\frac{T^2 - Z^2}{Z}$$\n$$y = \\frac{t^3 - t}{1} = \\frac{T^3 - T Z^2}{Z^2}$$\n\nNow, we can eliminate $t$ by solving the first equation for $t$ and substituting it into the second equation:\n\n$$t = \\frac{x + 1}{1 - x} = \\frac{T + Z}{Z - T}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n$$y = \\frac{((T + Z)/(Z - T))^3 - (T + Z)/(Z - T)}{1}$$\n\nNow, we need to clear the denominators and simplify the equation to obtain a homogeneous polynomial in $X, Y, Z$. After simplification, we get:\n\n$$Y(Z - T)^3 = (T^3 - T Z^2)(Z^2 - 2TZ + T^2)$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we obtain the homogeneous polynomial:\n\n$$F(X, Y, Z) = X^3 - 3X^2Z + 3XZ^2 - Y^2Z = 0$$\n\nThe degree of this polynomial is 3, so the degree of the curve $C$ is 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the genus of the curve. For a non-singular projective curve of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, the genus $g$ is given by the formula:\n\n$$g = \\frac{(d - 1)(d - 2)}{2}$$\n\nHowever, our curve is singular since it is a rational curve. In this case, we can use the Pl√ºcker formula, which takes into account the singularities of the curve:\n\n$$g = \\frac{(d - 1)(d - 2)}{2} - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_i$$\n\nwhere $\\delta_i$ are the delta invariants of the singular points of the curve. Since our curve is a rational curve, it has a unique singular point at infinity, which is a cusp. The delta invariant of a cusp is 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$g = \\frac{(3 - 1)(3 - 2)}{2} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$$\n\nSo, the genus of the curve $C$ is 0."
