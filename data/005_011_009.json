    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to test two different blends of coffee to determine which one is more popular among customers. They conduct an experiment and serve sample cups of each blend to 50 customers. 34 customers preferred blend A, while 16 customers preferred blend B. What is the relative frequency of customers who preferred blend A?",
    "message_2": "To find the relative frequency of customers who preferred blend A, divide the number of customers who preferred blend A by the total number of customers.\n\nRelative frequency of blend A = (Number of customers who preferred blend A) / (Total number of customers)\n\nRelative frequency of blend A = 34 / 50\n\nRelative frequency of blend A = 0.68\n\nSo, the relative frequency of customers who preferred blend A is 0.68 or 68%."
