    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 12. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 3-Sylow subgroups divides 4 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, there can be either 1 or 4 such subgroups. Similarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups divides 3 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2, so there can be either 1 or 3 such subgroups.\n\nCase 1: G has a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P.\nSince P is unique, it is normal in G. Let Q be any 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Then, |P ∩ Q| divides gcd(3, 4) = 1, so P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element. Thus, we have |PQ| = |P||Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 3 * 4 = 12, where PQ is the set of products pq for p in P and q in Q. Since |PQ| = |G|, we have PQ = G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the internal direct product P ⋊ Q, which is isomorphic to C3 ⋊ C4 (since P and Q are cyclic of orders 3 and 4, respectively). This is isomorphic to the cyclic group C12.\n\nCase 2: G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup Q.\nThis case is analogous to Case 1. We find that G is isomorphic to the internal direct product P ⋊ Q, where P is any 3-Sylow subgroup of G. This is isomorphic to C2 ⋊ C6, which is the dihedral group D6.\n\nCase 3: G has 4 3-Sylow subgroups and 3 2-Sylow subgroups.\nIn this case, let P be any 3-Sylow subgroup of G and Q be any 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Since there are 4 3-Sylow subgroups, there are 4 * 2 = 8 elements of order 3 in G. Similarly, since there are 3 2-Sylow subgroups, there are 3 * 2 = 6 elements of order 2 in G. In total, there are 8 + 6 = 14 elements of order 2 or 3 in G, but this is impossible since G has only 12 elements.\n\nThus, we have shown that G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the dihedral group D6, or the alternating group A4 (which is the only group of order 12 with 4 3-Sylow subgroups and 3 2-Sylow subgroups)."
