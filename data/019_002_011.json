    "message_2": "The statement \"All prime numbers are odd\" is false.\n\nThe given statement can be represented in predicate logic as:\n\n∀x(p(x) → q(x))\n\nHowever, the prime number 2 is an exception, as it is the only even prime number. Since 2 is a prime number and it is not odd, the statement is false."
