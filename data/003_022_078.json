    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3² + 5²) = √(9 + 25) = √34\n|B| = √(7² + (-2)²) = √(49 + 4) = √53\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B. To find A · B, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = (3 * 7) + (5 * -2) = 21 - 10 = 11\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = 11 / (√34 * √53)\n\nFinally, we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(11 / (√34 * √53))\n\nNow that we have the angle θ, we can find the dot product of the two vectors using the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ) = √34 * √53 * cos(θ)\n\nHowever, since we already found the dot product A · B = 11, we don't need to compute the angle θ and the trigonometric function. The dot product of the two vectors A and B is 11."
