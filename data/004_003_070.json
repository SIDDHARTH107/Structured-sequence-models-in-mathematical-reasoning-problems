    "message_2": "Let's first find the dimensions of the cylinder after cutting out the square corners and folding up the sides. The height of the cylinder will be equal to the side length of the square corners, which is x cm. The circumference of the cylinder will be equal to the remaining length of the longer side of the rectangle, which is 14 - 2x cm. The radius of the cylinder can be found by dividing the circumference by 2π, so the radius is (14 - 2x) / (2π) cm.\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height. In this case, we have:\n\nV = π((14 - 2x) / (2π))^2 * x\nV = ((14 - 2x)^2 * x) / 4\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the value of x that maximizes the volume function. To do this, we can take the derivative of the volume function with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\ndV/dx = (1/4) * (2(14 - 2x)(-2) * x + (14 - 2x)^2)\n\nSetting dV/dx = 0 and solving for x:\n\n0 = (-4x(14 - 2x) + (14 - 2x)^2)\n0 = -56x + 16x^2 + 196 - 56x + 4x^2\n0 = 20x^2 - 112x + 196\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of x that make the derivative equal to 0:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nx = (112 ± √(112^2 - 4(20)(196))) / (2 * 20)\nx = (112 ± √(12544 - 15680)) / 40\nx = (112 ± √(-3136)) / 40\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for x. However, we can still find the maximum volume by considering the critical points of the function. The critical points occur when the derivative is either 0 or undefined. In this case, the derivative is never undefined, so we only need to consider the endpoints of the domain of x.\n\nThe domain of x is determined by the dimensions of the rectangular piece of metal. Since the metal is 14 cm by 10 cm, the maximum value of x is half the length of the shorter side, which is 5 cm. The minimum value of x is 0 cm. However, x = 0 cm would result in a cylinder with no height, so we can disregard this value.\n\nNow, we can find the maximum volume by plugging x = 5 cm into the volume function:\n\nV = ((14 - 2(5))^2 * 5) / 4\nV = ((14 - 10)^2 * 5) / 4\nV = (4^2 * 5) / 4\nV = (16 * 5) / 4\nV = 80 / 4\nV = 20 cm^3\n\nSo, the maximum volume of the cylinder that can be formed in this way is 20 cubic centimeters."
