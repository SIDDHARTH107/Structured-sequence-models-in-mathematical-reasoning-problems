    "message_2": "To maximize the retailer's profit, we need to find the price that maximizes the profit function. The profit function is given by:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nRevenue is given by the product of price (P) and quantity demanded (Q), which is P * Q. The cost is given by the product of cost per unit ($60) and quantity demanded (Q), which is 60 * Q.\n\nSo, the profit function is:\n\nProfit = P * Q - 60 * Q\n\nWe are given the demand function Q = 1000 - 10P. We can substitute this into the profit function:\n\nProfit = P * (1000 - 10P) - 60 * (1000 - 10P)\n\nNow, we need to find the price (P) that maximizes this profit function. To do this, we can take the derivative of the profit function with respect to P and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Profit)/dP = 0\n\nFirst, let's expand the profit function:\n\nProfit = 1000P - 10P^2 - 60000 + 600P\n\nNow, let's take the derivative with respect to P:\n\nd(Profit)/dP = 1000 - 20P + 600\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for P:\n\n1000 - 20P + 600 = 0\n1600 = 20P\nP = 80\n\nSo, the optimal price to maximize the retailer's profit is $80."
