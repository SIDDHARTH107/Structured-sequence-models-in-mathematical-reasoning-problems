    "message_2": "Since G has order 27, we know that |G| = 27 = 3^3. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which we will call P. The Sylow Theorems also tell us that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility for the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is 1, which means that P is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G.\n\nNow, let H be a non-trivial subgroup of G. Since the order of H must divide the order of G, we know that |H| = 3^k for some 1 ≤ k ≤ 3. If k = 1, then |H| = 3, and by Lagrange's Theorem, the order of any element in H must divide the order of H. Thus, any non-identity element in H has order 3, and H is cyclic.\n\nIf k = 2, then |H| = 9. In this case, H is a subgroup of P, since P is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since P is a p-group (a group of order p^n for some prime p and integer n), it has a non-trivial center by the center theorem for p-groups. Let Z(P) be the center of P. Then, Z(P) is a non-trivial subgroup of P, so |Z(P)| = 3^m for some 1 ≤ m ≤ 3. Since Z(P) is a proper subgroup of P, we have m < 3, so m = 1 or m = 2.\n\nIf |Z(P)| = 3, then Z(P) is a subgroup of H, since H has order 9. But this would mean that H has a subgroup of order 3, which implies that H is not cyclic, contradicting the fact that H is a subgroup of the cyclic group P. Therefore, |Z(P)| = 9, which means that Z(P) = P. Since the center of a group is always an abelian subgroup, P is abelian. In particular, H is abelian as well.\n\nNow, consider the elements of H. By Lagrange's Theorem, the order of any element in H must divide the order of H. Thus, the possible orders of elements in H are 1, 3, and 9. Since H is non-trivial, it contains an element of order 3 or 9. If it contains an element of order 9, then H is cyclic. If it contains an element of order 3 but not 9, then H must have at least two distinct elements of order 3, say a and b. But since H is abelian, the element ab has order lcm(3, 3) = 3, which means that H has at least three distinct elements of order 3. This is a contradiction, since a group of order 9 can have at most two elements of order 3 (otherwise, it would have at least 1 + 2*3 = 7 elements, which is impossible for a group of order 9). Therefore, H must contain an element of order 9, and H is cyclic.\n\nIn summary, H is a cyclic subgroup of G, and its order is either 3 or 9."
