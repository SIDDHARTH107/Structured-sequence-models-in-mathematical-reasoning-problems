    "message_2": "First, we will write the given system of linear equations in the form of an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[  2   3  -1 |  6 ]\n[  4  -2   3 |  7 ]\n[ -3   4   2 | -10]\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo eliminate x from the second row, we can subtract twice the first row from the second row:\n\n```\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\n```\n\n```\n[  2   3  -1 |   6 ]\n[  0  -8   5 |  -5 ]\n[ -3   4   2 | -10 ]\n```\n\nTo eliminate x from the third row, we can add 1.5 times the first row to the third row:\n\n```\nR3 = R3 + 1.5 * R1\n```\n\n```\n[  2   3  -1 |   6 ]\n[  0  -8   5 |  -5 ]\n[  0   8.5 -0.5|   1 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo eliminate y from the third row, we can add 1.0625 times the second row to the third row:\n\n```\nR3 = R3 + 1.0625 * R2\n```\n\n```\n[  2   3  -1 |   6 ]\n[  0  -8   5 |  -5 ]\n[  0   0   4.625 | -4.3125 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nNow, we can solve for z by dividing the third row by 4.625:\n\n```\nR3 = R3 / 4.625\n```\n\n```\n[  2   3  -1 |   6 ]\n[  0  -8   5 |  -5 ]\n[  0   0   1 |  -0.9375 ]\n```\n\nSo, z = -0.9375.\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nNow, we can solve for y by substituting z back into the second row and dividing by -8:\n\n```\nR2 = (R2 - 5 * R3) / -8\n```\n\n```\n[  2   3  -1 |   6 ]\n[  0   1  -0.625 |  0.484375 ]\n[  0   0   1 |  -0.9375 ]\n```\n\nSo, y = 0.484375.\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nFinally, we can solve for x by substituting y and z back into the first row and dividing by 2:\n\n```\nR1 = (R1 + R3 + 3 * R2) / 2\n```\n\n```\n[  1   0   0 |   1.21875 ]\n[  0   1  -0.625 |  0.484375 ]\n[  0   0   1 |  -0.9375 ]\n```\n\nSo, x = 1.21875.\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1.21875\ny = 0.484375\nz = -0.9375"
