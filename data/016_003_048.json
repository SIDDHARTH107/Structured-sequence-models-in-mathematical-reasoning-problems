    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. A point is considered to escape to infinity if its magnitude (|z|) becomes greater than the escape radius (in this case, 2) after a certain number of iterations.\n\nFor a point on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, it takes an infinite number of iterations to escape to infinity. However, in practice, we often set a maximum number of iterations to determine if a point is in the Mandelbrot set or not. If a point does not escape within the maximum number of iterations, it is considered to be in the Mandelbrot set.\n\nSo, for a point on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, it would take an infinite number of iterations to escape to infinity when the escape radius is set to be 2."
