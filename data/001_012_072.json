    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 4x^2 - 12x\nFactor out the common term 4x:\n4x(x - 3)\n\nDenominator: 6x^2 - 18x\nFactor out the common term 6x:\n6x(x - 3)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(4x(x - 3)) / (6x(x - 3))\n\nSince (x - 3) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out:\n\n(4x) / (6x)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2x:\n\n(4x / 2x) / (6x / 2x)\n\n2 / 3\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n2/3"
