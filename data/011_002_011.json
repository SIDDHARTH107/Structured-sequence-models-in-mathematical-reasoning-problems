    "message_2": "We can use the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of the $x^4$ term in the expansion of $(x+2)^6$. The binomial theorem states that for any non-negative integer $n$ and any real numbers $a$ and $b$:\n\n$(a+b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k} a^{n-k} b^k$\n\nIn our case, $a = x$, $b = 2$, and $n = 6$. We want to find the coefficient of the $x^4$ term, which means we need to find the term with $k = 2$:\n\n${6 \\choose 2} x^{6-2} 2^2 = {6 \\choose 2} x^4 4$\n\nNow, we need to calculate the binomial coefficient ${6 \\choose 2}$:\n\n${6 \\choose 2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2!4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4!}{2 \\times 4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 3 \\times 5 = 15$\n\nSo, the coefficient of the $x^4$ term in the expansion of $(x+2)^6$ is:\n\n$15 \\times 4 = \\boxed{60}$."
