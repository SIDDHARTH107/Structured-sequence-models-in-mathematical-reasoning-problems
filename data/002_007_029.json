    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm and two bases that measure 12 cm and 16 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height\n\nIn this case, base1 is 12 cm, base2 is 16 cm, and the height is 8 cm. Plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (12 + 16) * 8\n\nArea = (1/2) * (28) * 8\n\nArea = 14 * 8\n\nArea = 112 cmÂ²\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 112 square centimeters."
