    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 7 cm and a slant height of 12 cm. What is its surface area, rounded to the nearest hundredth?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nIn this case, r = 7 cm and l = 12 cm.\n\nSurface Area = π(7)(7 + 12)\nSurface Area = π(7)(19)\nSurface Area ≈ 3.14 × 7 × 19\nSurface Area ≈ 419.46 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 419.46 cm², rounded to the nearest hundredth."
