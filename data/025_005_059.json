    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the curve defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz, we need to find the points where the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z are all zero.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 3xyz. We will find the partial derivatives of F with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x - 3yz\n∂F/∂y = 2y - 3xz\n∂F/∂z = 2z - 3xy\n\nNow we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n2x - 3yz = 0\n2y - 3xz = 0\n2z - 3xy = 0\n\nWe can see that (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) is a solution, but it's trivial. To find non-trivial solutions, let's assume that at least one of x, y, or z is non-zero. We can divide each equation by the corresponding variable:\n\n2 - 3y = x(0)\n2 - 3x = y(0)\n2 - 3y = z(0)\n\nNow we can add the first and second equations:\n\n4 - 3x - 3y = 0\n\nFrom this equation, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = (4 - 3x) / 3\n\nNow substitute this expression for y into the third equation:\n\n2 - 3((4 - 3x) / 3) = z(0)\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 - 4 + 3x = z(0)\n3x - 2 = z(0)\n\nNow we have expressions for y and z in terms of x:\n\ny = (4 - 3x) / 3\nz = 3x - 2\n\nSubstitute these expressions back into the original equation:\n\nx^2 + ((4 - 3x) / 3)^2 + (3x - 2)^2 = 3x((4 - 3x) / 3)(3x - 2)\n\nSimplify:\n\nx^2 + (4 - 3x)^2 / 9 + (3x - 2)^2 = 3x(4 - 3x)(3x - 2)\n\nNow we can see that x = 0, x = 4/3, and x = 2/3 are the possible solutions for x. For each value of x, we can find the corresponding values of y and z:\n\n1. For x = 0:\ny = (4 - 3*0) / 3 = 4/3\nz = 3*0 - 2 = -2\nSo, one singular point is (0, 4/3, -2).\n\n2. For x = 4/3:\ny = (4 - 3*(4/3)) / 3 = 0\nz = 3*(4/3) - 2 = 2\nSo, another singular point is (4/3, 0, 2).\n\n3. For x = 2/3:\ny = (4 - 3*(2/3)) / 3 = 2/3\nz = 3*(2/3) - 2 = -2/3\nSo, the last singular point is (2/3, 2/3, -2/3).\n\nTherefore, the singular points of the curve defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz are (0, 4/3, -2), (4/3, 0, 2), and (2/3, 2/3, -2/3)."
