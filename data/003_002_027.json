    "message_1": "The angle of depression from a tower to a boat in the water is 30 degrees. If the tower is 50 meters tall, how far is the boat from the base of the tower?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. We have a right triangle with the tower as one side, the distance from the base of the tower to the boat as the other side, and the line of sight from the top of the tower to the boat as the hypotenuse. The angle of depression is 30 degrees, which means the angle between the tower and the line of sight is also 30 degrees.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to find the distance from the base of the tower to the boat. The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side (the tower's height) to the adjacent side (the distance from the base of the tower to the boat).\n\ntan(30°) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(30°) = 50 meters / distance to the boat\n\nTo find the distance to the boat, we can rearrange the equation:\n\ndistance to the boat = 50 meters / tan(30°)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of tan(30°), which is approximately 0.577:\n\ndistance to the boat = 50 meters / 0.577 ≈ 86.6 meters\n\nSo, the boat is approximately 86.6 meters away from the base of the tower."
