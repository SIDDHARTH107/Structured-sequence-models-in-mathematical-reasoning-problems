    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two products A and B. The production of A requires 4 machine hours and 2 labor hours while the production of B requires 3 machine hours and 5 labor hours. Product A generates a profit of $80 per unit while the profit for product B is $100 per unit. If the company has 800 machine hours and 1200 labor hours available per week, how many units of each product should they produce in order to maximize their profit using the cuckoo search algorithm?",
    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. It is used to find the optimal solution for complex optimization problems. In this case, we will use the cuckoo search algorithm to find the optimal production quantities of products A and B to maximize the profit.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (profit to be maximized): P = 80x + 100y\n\nConstraints:\n1. 4x + 3y ≤ 800 (machine hours constraint)\n2. 2x + 5y ≤ 1200 (labor hours constraint)\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow, let's implement the cuckoo search algorithm to find the optimal solution:\n\n1. Initialize a population of \"nests\" (potential solutions) with random values for x and y.\n2. Evaluate the fitness (profit) of each nest.\n3. Choose a nest randomly and generate a new solution by modifying its x and y values using a Levy flight (a random walk with step sizes drawn from a Levy distribution).\n4. If the new solution has a better fitness (higher profit) and satisfies the constraints, replace the original nest with the new solution.\n5. Perform a fraction \"pa\" of the worst nests to be replaced by new nests with random x and y values.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for a predefined number of iterations or until a convergence criterion is met.\n\nAfter running the cuckoo search algorithm, we will obtain the optimal values for x and y that maximize the profit while satisfying the constraints. The optimal solution will provide the number of units of products A and B that the company should produce to maximize their profit."
