    "message_2": "To find the degree of the curve $C$, we look at the highest total degree of the monomials in the equation. In this case, we have $t^2s$, $tsv^2$, and $s^3$. The highest total degree is 3, so the degree of the curve $C$ is 3.\n\nNow, let's consider a general line $L$ in the projective plane with equation $ax + by + cz = 0$. In homogeneous coordinates, we can write this as $at + bs + cv = 0$. We want to find the number of intersections of $C$ and $L$.\n\nTo find the intersections, we substitute the equation of the line $L$ into the equation of the curve $C$. We have:\n\n$$C: t^2s + tsv^2 + s^3 = 0$$\n$$L: at + bs + cv = 0$$\n\nSubstituting $s = -\\frac{at + cv}{b}$ into the equation of $C$, we get:\n\n$$t^2(-\\frac{at + cv}{b}) + t(-\\frac{at + cv}{b})v^2 + (-\\frac{at + cv}{b})^3 = 0$$\n\nMultiplying through by $b^3$, we get:\n\n$$-b^2t^3 - 2abt^2v - a^3t - 3a^2ct^2v - 3ab^2tv^2 - 3abcv^3 - c^3v^3 = 0$$\n\nThis is a cubic equation in $t$ and $v$. Since $C$ has degree 3 and $L$ has degree 1, by BÃ©zout's theorem, the number of intersections of $C$ and $L$ is equal to the product of their degrees, which is $3 \\times 1 = 3$. Therefore, there are 3 intersections of $C$ and $L$ in the projective plane, provided that $L$ is not contained in the curve $C$."
