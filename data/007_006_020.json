    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 54 and 72 using the Euclidean algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (72) by the smaller number (54) and find the remainder.\n   72 รท 54 = 1 with a remainder of 18.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (72) with the smaller number (54) and the smaller number with the remainder (18).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 54 and 18.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (54) by the smaller number (18) and find the remainder.\n   54 รท 18 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 18.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of 54 and 72 is 18."
