    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation, we first need to find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for the given differential equation is:\n\n$m^2 - 4 = 0$\n\nSolving for m, we get:\n\n$m^2 = 4$\n\n$m = \\pm 2$\n\nNow we have two distinct real roots, $m_1 = 2$ and $m_2 = -2$. Therefore, the general solution for the given differential equation is:\n\n$y(x) = C_1 e^{2x} + C_2 e^{-2x}$\n\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are arbitrary complex constants."
