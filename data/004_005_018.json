    "message_1": "A tank initially contains 100 liters of water. Water is poured into the tank at a rate of 3 liters per minute. The water is mixed and drained from the tank at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Write a differential equation and find the solution for the volume of water in the tank as a function of time.",
    "message_2": "To find the differential equation, we need to determine the rate of change of the volume of water in the tank with respect to time. Let V(t) be the volume of water in the tank at time t (in minutes). The rate of change of the volume is the difference between the rate at which water is poured into the tank and the rate at which it is drained.\n\ndV/dt = rate in - rate out\ndV/dt = 3 - 2\n\nSo, the differential equation is:\n\ndV/dt = 1\n\nNow, we need to solve this differential equation to find the volume of water in the tank as a function of time. To do this, we can integrate both sides of the equation with respect to time:\n\n∫(dV/dt) dt = ∫1 dt\nV(t) = t + C\n\nTo find the constant of integration C, we can use the initial condition that the tank contains 100 liters of water at time t = 0:\n\nV(0) = 100\n100 = 0 + C\nC = 100\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\nV(t) = t + 100\n\nThis equation represents the volume of water in the tank as a function of time."
