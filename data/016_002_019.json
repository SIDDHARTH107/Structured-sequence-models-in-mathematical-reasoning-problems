    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then recursively adding smaller equilateral triangles to each side. After each iteration, the number of sides of the Koch snowflake increases, and the length of each side decreases.\n\nLet's denote the initial side length as s, the number of iterations as n, and the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after n iterations as P(n).\n\nFor the first iteration (n = 1), we replace each side of the equilateral triangle with 4 sides, each of which is 1/3 the length of the original side. So, the perimeter after the first iteration is:\n\nP(1) = 3 * 4 * (s/3) = 4s\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, we replace each side with 4 sides that are 1/3 the length of the previous side. Therefore, the perimeter after n iterations is:\n\nP(n) = 4^n * s\n\nIn this problem, we are given s = 5 units and n = 4 iterations. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(4) = 4^4 * 5 = 256 * 5 = 1280 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve with a side length of 5 units after 4 iterations is 1280 units."
