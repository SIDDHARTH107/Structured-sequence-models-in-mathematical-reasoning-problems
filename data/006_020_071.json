    "message_2": "To find the probability of a randomly chosen family having a pet, we need to divide the number of families with pets by the total number of families in the community.\n\nProbability = (Number of families with pets) / (Total number of families)\n\nProbability = 300 / 500\n\nProbability = 0.6 or 60%\n\nSo, there is a 60% chance that a randomly chosen family in the community has a pet."
