    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. In this case, we need to find the largest set of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's analyze the adjacency matrix:\n\n```\n0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 0 0 1 0 1 0\n```\n\nWe can see that vertices 1, 2, and 6 form a complete subgraph (clique) of size 3, as they are all connected to each other:\n\n```\n1 - 2\n1 - 6\n2 - 6\n```\n\nSimilarly, vertices 2, 3, and 5 also form a complete subgraph (clique) of size 3:\n\n```\n2 - 3\n2 - 5\n3 - 5\n```\n\nThere is no larger clique in this graph. Therefore, the clique number of G is 3."
