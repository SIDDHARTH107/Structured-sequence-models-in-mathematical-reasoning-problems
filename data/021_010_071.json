    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem:\n\nA company manufactures two products, X and Y. The profit per unit sold of X is $20 and that of Y is $30. The company has 200 units of raw material A, 150 units of raw material B, and 200 units of raw material C. Product X requires 3 units of A, 2 units of B, and 4 units of C to make, while product Y requires 2 units of A, 4 units of B, and 3 units of C to make. What is the maximum profit the company can make, and how many units of X and Y should it produce to achieve this profit? Use Newton's method to solve the optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "Newton's method is not the appropriate method to solve this optimization problem, as it is a linear programming problem. Instead, we can use the simplex method or graphical method to solve it. In this case, we will use the graphical method.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is:\nP = 20x + 30y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n3x + 2y ≤ 200 (raw material A)\n2x + 4y ≤ 150 (raw material B)\n4x + 3y ≤ 200 (raw material C)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 200\n   y ≤ (200 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. 2x + 4y ≤ 150\n   y ≤ (150 - 2x) / 4\n\n3. 4x + 3y ≤ 200\n   y ≤ (200 - 4x) / 3\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of linear equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:\n\n1. Intersection of constraint 1 and 2:\n   3x + 2y = 200\n   2x + 4y = 150\n   Solving this system, we get x = 20 and y = 30.\n\n2. Intersection of constraint 1 and 3:\n   3x + 2y = 200\n   4x + 3y = 200\n   Solving this system, we get x = 40 and y = 20.\n\n3. Intersection of constraint 2 and 3:\n   2x + 4y = 150\n   4x + 3y = 200\n   Solving this system, we get x = 10 and y = 35.\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(20, 30) = 20(20) + 30(30) = 400 + 900 = 1300\n2. P(40, 20) = 20(40) + 30(20) = 800 + 600 = 1400\n3. P(10, 35) = 20(10) + 30(35) = 200 + 1050 = 1250\n\nThe maximum profit is $1400 when producing 40 units of product X and 20 units of product Y."
