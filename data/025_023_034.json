    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the intersection cohomology groups of X, we first need to analyze the given equations. We have:\n\n1) x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\n2) x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 1\n3) y^2 + z^2 = 1\n\nLet's subtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n(1) - (2): 2z^2 = 0 => z^2 = 0 => z = 0\n\nNow, we can substitute z = 0 into equations (1) and (3):\n\n1) x^2 + y^2 = 1\n3) y^2 = 1 - z^2 = 1\n\nFrom equation (3), we have two possible solutions for y: y = 1 or y = -1.\n\nCase 1: y = 1\nSubstitute y = 1 into equation (1): x^2 + 1 = 1 => x^2 = 0 => x = 0\nSo, we have one solution (x, y, z) = (0, 1, 0)\n\nCase 2: y = -1\nSubstitute y = -1 into equation (1): x^2 + 1 = 1 => x^2 = 0 => x = 0\nSo, we have another solution (x, y, z) = (0, -1, 0)\n\nNow, let's compute the intersection cohomology groups of X. Since X is defined by three equations in three variables, we expect the cohomology groups to be concentrated in degree 0, 1, and 2.\n\nH^0(X): This is the space of constant functions on X. Since X is non-empty (we found two points above), H^0(X) has dimension 1.\n\nH^1(X): This is the space of closed 1-forms on X modulo exact 1-forms. Since X is a 0-dimensional variety (it consists of isolated points), there are no non-trivial 1-forms on X. Therefore, H^1(X) has dimension 0.\n\nH^2(X): This is the space of closed 2-forms on X modulo exact 2-forms. Again, since X is a 0-dimensional variety, there are no non-trivial 2-forms on X. Therefore, H^2(X) has dimension 0.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the intersection cohomology groups of X are:\n\ndim H^0(X) = 1\ndim H^1(X) = 0\ndim H^2(X) = 0"
