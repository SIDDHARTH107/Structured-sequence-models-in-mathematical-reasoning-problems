    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as AΔB. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nAΔB = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (AΔB) with the set {2, 3, 5}:\n\n(AΔB) ∩ {2, 3, 5} = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 5} = {}\n\nNow let's find the intersections of A and B with the set {2, 3, 5}:\n\nA ∩ {2, 3, 5} = {2, 3}\nB ∩ {2, 3, 5} = {2, 3}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of these two intersections:\n\n(A ∩ {2, 3, 5}) Δ (B ∩ {2, 3, 5}) = {2, 3} Δ {2, 3} = {}\n\nSince both (AΔB) ∩ {2, 3, 5} and (A ∩ {2, 3, 5}) Δ (B ∩ {2, 3, 5}) are equal to the empty set, the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over intersection in this specific case. However, this does not prove that it is always distributive over intersection for all sets."
