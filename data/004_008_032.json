    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at a specific point, we need to find the derivative of the function y with respect to x, and then evaluate it at the given x value.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 - 3x + 5.\n\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of y with respect to x (dy/dx) is:\n\ndy/dx = 2x - 3\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the derivative at the point where x = 2:\n\ndy/dx(2) = 2(2) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 2 is 1."
