    "message_1": "Suppose you have a dataset of 50 observations and you wish to estimate the mean. Using bootstrapping, resample with replacement from the original dataset and calculate the mean for each sample. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the bootstrapped means, and use this information to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true mean.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the mean using bootstrapping, follow these steps:\n\n1. Resample with replacement from the original dataset of 50 observations. This means creating a new sample of 50 observations by randomly selecting from the original dataset, allowing for the same observation to be selected multiple times.\n\n2. Calculate the mean of each resampled dataset.\n\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 a large number of times, say 1000 or more, to generate a distribution of bootstrapped means.\n\n4. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the bootstrapped means. This will give you an estimate of the true mean and its variability.\n\n5. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true mean using the mean and standard deviation of the bootstrapped means. To do this, find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the bootstrapped means. This interval will contain the true mean with 95% confidence.\n\nNote that without the actual dataset or any information about the data, it's not possible to provide specific numerical results. However, the steps outlined above can be applied to any dataset to estimate the mean and construct a 95% confidence interval using bootstrapping."
