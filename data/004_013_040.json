    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5 on the interval [-1, 5], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx = 1, 3\n\nNow, we have two critical points: x = 1 and x = 3. We also need to evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval, which are x = -1 and x = 5.\n\nLet's evaluate the function at these four points:\n\nf(-1) = (-1)^3 - 6(-1)^2 + 9(-1) + 5 = -1 - 6 - 9 + 5 = -11\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 5 = 1 - 6 + 9 + 5 = 9\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 5 = 27 - 54 + 27 + 5 = 5\nf(5) = (5)^3 - 6(5)^2 + 9(5) + 5 = 125 - 150 + 45 + 5 = 25\n\nNow, let's compare the values of the function at these points:\n\nf(-1) = -11\nf(1) = 9\nf(3) = 5\nf(5) = 25\n\nThe maximum value of the function on the interval [-1, 5] is 25, which occurs at x = 5. The minimum value of the function on the interval [-1, 5] is -11, which occurs at x = -1."
