    "message_2": "A Latin square of order 4 is a 4x4 grid filled with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 such that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. To count the number of distinct Latin squares of order 4, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Fill in the first row and first column with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in their natural order. This is because any Latin square can be transformed into another Latin square by permuting rows and columns, so we can fix the first row and column without loss of generality.\n\n2. There are 2 possible ways to fill in the second row and second column, as shown below:\n\n   (a) 1 2 3 4\n       2 1 4 3\n       3 4 ? ?\n       4 3 ? ?\n\n   (b) 1 2 3 4\n       2 1 4 3\n       3 4 ? ?\n       4 3 ? ?\n\n3. Now, we need to fill in the remaining 2x2 grid in the bottom right corner. For each of the two cases above, there is only one way to fill in the remaining grid:\n\n   (a) 1 2 3 4\n       2 1 4 3\n       3 4 1 2\n       4 3 2 1\n\n   (b) 1 2 3 4\n       2 1 4 3\n       3 4 2 1\n       4 3 1 2\n\nThus, there are 2 distinct Latin squares of order 4 using the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4."
