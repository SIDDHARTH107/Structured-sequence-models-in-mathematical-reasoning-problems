    "message_2": "To simplify the given radical expression √(27/243), we first need to simplify the fraction inside the square root.\n\n27/243 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 27.\n\n27 ÷ 27 = 1\n243 ÷ 27 = 9\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 1/9.\n\nNow, we have the expression √(1/9).\n\nWe can rewrite this expression as the square root of the numerator divided by the square root of the denominator:\n\n√(1)/√(9)\n\nThe square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 9 is 3:\n\n1/3\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is 1/3."
