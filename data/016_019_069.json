    "message_2": "The Koch Island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the perimeter of the Koch Island increases by a factor of 4/3. \n\nTo find the total perimeter after the fifth iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial Perimeter * (4/3)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial perimeter is 200 meters, and we want to find the perimeter after the fifth iteration (n = 5).\n\nPerimeter = 200 * (4/3)^5\nPerimeter ≈ 200 * 1024/243\nPerimeter ≈ 842.105 meters\n\nSo, the total perimeter of the Koch Island after the fifth iteration is approximately 842.105 meters."
