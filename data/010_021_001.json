    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem for the student to solve:\n\nWhat is the area enclosed by the curve x^2 + y^2 = 1 in the plane R^2 equipped with the standard symplectic form ω = dx ∧ dy?\n\nHint: The symplectic area of a curve in R^2 is given by integrating its differential form ω over the region enclosed by the curve. In this case, we have ω = dx ∧ dy, so the symplectic area is just the usual area of the region.",
    "message_2": "The given curve is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. To find the area enclosed by this curve, we can use the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nArea = π * r^2\n\nSince the radius (r) is 1, the area enclosed by the curve is:\n\nArea = π * 1^2 = π\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the curve x^2 + y^2 = 1 in the plane R^2 equipped with the standard symplectic form ω = dx ∧ dy is π square units."
