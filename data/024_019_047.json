    "message_2": "To find the total integral of the Gaussian curvature over the surface, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a closed surface, the total integral of the Gaussian curvature is related to the Euler characteristic (χ) of the surface:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ\n\nwhere K is the Gaussian curvature, dA is the area element, and χ is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nSince we know that the Gaussian curvature K is -4 everywhere on the surface, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n∫∫_S (-4) dA = 2πχ\n\nNow, we need to find the Euler characteristic of the surface. For a closed surface, the Euler characteristic is given by:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. However, we don't have enough information about the surface to determine the Euler characteristic directly.\n\nInstead, we can use the fact that the surface is closed and has a constant Gaussian curvature. This means that the surface must be a surface of constant negative curvature, such as a hyperbolic surface. For a closed hyperbolic surface, the Euler characteristic is always negative.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of the Euler characteristic, we can't find the exact total integral of the Gaussian curvature over the surface. However, we can say that the total integral will be a multiple of 2π, and it will be negative due to the negative Gaussian curvature and the negative Euler characteristic."
