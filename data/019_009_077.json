    "message_2": "Given the information:\n\n1. A → (B ∨ C)\n2. B → D\n3. C → D\n\nWe want to prove (A → D).\n\nProof:\n\nAssume A is true. From (1), we know that A → (B ∨ C), so either B or C must be true.\n\nCase 1: B is true.\nFrom (2), we know that B → D, so if B is true, then D must be true.\n\nCase 2: C is true.\nFrom (3), we know that C → D, so if C is true, then D must be true.\n\nIn both cases, if A is true, then D is true. Therefore, we can conclude that A → D."
