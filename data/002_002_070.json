    "message_2": "The volume V of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 5 cm, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (5 cm)^3\nV = (4/3) * π * 125 cm^3\nV = 500/3 * π cm^3\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.14159, we get:\n\nV ≈ 500/3 * 3.14159 cm^3\nV ≈ 523.59833 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 523.6 cubic centimeters."
