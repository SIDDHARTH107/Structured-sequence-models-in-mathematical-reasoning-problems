    "message_1": "Consider a group of five students who can either choose to work on a group project or work on an individual project. Let's assume that each student will receive a grade of 85% for the group project if everybody works together, but only 70% if anyone chooses to work individually. Also, each student has a private valuation of $10 for working on their own project, and $20 for working in the group project. Using mechanism design theory, design a payment scheme that will incentivize all five students to work together on the group project. Your payment scheme should maximize the total payoff of the students while ensuring that they have no incentive to deviate from the group project.",
    "message_2": "To design a payment scheme that incentivizes all five students to work together on the group project, we can use the concept of a \"transfer payment\" that rewards students for choosing the group project and penalizes them for choosing the individual project. The payment scheme should be designed such that the net payoff for each student is higher when they choose the group project over the individual project.\n\nLet's denote the transfer payment as T. The net payoff for each student when they choose the group project will be:\n\nPayoff_group = Valuation_group + T + Grade_group\n\nSimilarly, the net payoff for each student when they choose the individual project will be:\n\nPayoff_individual = Valuation_individual - T + Grade_individual\n\nTo ensure that all students choose the group project, we need to make sure that the net payoff for the group project is higher than the individual project:\n\nPayoff_group > Payoff_individual\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n(20 + T + 0.85) > (10 - T + 0.7)\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum value of T that satisfies this inequality:\n\nT > -10 + 0.15 + T\n\nT > 5\n\nSo, the minimum transfer payment required to incentivize all students to work together on the group project is $5. The payment scheme will be as follows:\n\n1. If a student chooses the group project, they will receive a transfer payment of $5.\n2. If a student chooses the individual project, they will have to pay a penalty of $5.\n\nThis payment scheme ensures that the total payoff for each student is maximized while also ensuring that they have no incentive to deviate from the group project."
