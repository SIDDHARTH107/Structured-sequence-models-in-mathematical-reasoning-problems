    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity relative to the north direction, we can use the concept of vector components. Since the boat is traveling in the northeast direction, its velocity can be divided into two components: one in the north direction and one in the east direction.\n\nLet Vn be the north component of the velocity and Ve be the east component of the velocity. Since the boat is traveling at a 45-degree angle between the north and east directions (as northeast is exactly between north and east), we can use trigonometry to find the components of the velocity.\n\nVn = V * cos(45°)\nVe = V * sin(45°)\n\nWhere V is the magnitude of the boat's velocity (15 m/s) and 45° is the angle between the north direction and the northeast direction.\n\nVn = 15 * cos(45°)\nVe = 15 * sin(45°)\n\nSince cos(45°) = sin(45°) = √2 / 2:\n\nVn = 15 * (√2 / 2) = 15√2 / 2 ≈ 10.61 m/s\nVe = 15 * (√2 / 2) = 15√2 / 2 ≈ 10.61 m/s\n\nNow we have the north and east components of the velocity. Since we want to find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity relative to the north direction, we only need the north component of the velocity.\n\nThe magnitude of the boat's velocity relative to the north direction is 10.61 m/s.\n\nThe direction of the boat's velocity relative to the north direction is simply the north direction, as the boat is moving towards the northeast and the north component represents the portion of the velocity in the north direction."
