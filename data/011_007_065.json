    "message_1": "A factory produces a new type of product each month. In the first month, they produce 100 units. From the second month onwards, the production rate increases by 20% every month. How many units will be produced in the eighth month?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of units produced in the eighth month, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is:\n\nFinal Amount = Initial Amount * (1 + Rate of Increase)^Number of Periods\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is the number of units produced in the first month (100 units), the rate of increase is 20% (0.20), and the number of periods is the difference between the first month and the eighth month (8 - 1 = 7).\n\nFinal Amount = 100 * (1 + 0.20)^7\nFinal Amount = 100 * (1.20)^7\nFinal Amount = 100 * 3.58318649 (rounded to 8 decimal places)\n\nFinal Amount â‰ˆ 358.32 units\n\nSince the factory can only produce whole units, they will produce approximately 358 units in the eighth month."
