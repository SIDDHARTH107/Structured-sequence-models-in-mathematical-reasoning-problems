    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can only provide the probability based on the information given. If the polls suggest that the political candidate has a 60% chance of winning, then the probability of them winning the election is 60% or 0.6. However, it's important to note that polls can be inaccurate and may not fully represent the actual outcome of an election."
