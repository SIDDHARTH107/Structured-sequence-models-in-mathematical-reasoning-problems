    "message_1": "A water fountain creates a parabolic stream of water that reaches a maximum height of 12 meters and is 18 meters wide at the base. The stream is modeled by the function h(x) = -0.2xÂ² + 12, where h(x) represents the height (in meters) of the stream at a horizontal distance x (in meters) from the center of the fountain. What is the maximum height of the stream and at what horizontal distance from the center of the fountain does it occur?",
    "message_2": "The given function is a quadratic function in the form of h(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, where a = -0.2, b = 0, and c = 12. Since the coefficient of the x^2 term (a) is negative, the parabola opens downward, and the vertex of the parabola represents the maximum height of the stream.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola in the form h(x) = ax^2 + bx + c can be found using the formula x = -b / 2a for the x-coordinate of the vertex. In this case, b = 0 and a = -0.2, so:\n\nx = -0 / (2 * -0.2) = 0\n\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex is 0, which means the maximum height occurs at the center of the fountain. Now, we can find the maximum height by plugging this x-coordinate back into the function h(x):\n\nh(0) = -0.2(0)^2 + 12 = 12\n\nThe maximum height of the stream is 12 meters, and it occurs at a horizontal distance of 0 meters from the center of the fountain."
