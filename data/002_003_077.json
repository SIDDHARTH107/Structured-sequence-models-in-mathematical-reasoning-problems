    "message_1": "A cube has a length of 5 cm. What is the total surface area of the cube?",
    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the surface area of a cube, we need to find the area of one face and then multiply it by 6.\n\nThe area of a square is found by multiplying the length of one side by itself. In this case, the length of one side is 5 cm.\n\nArea of one face = side × side = 5 cm × 5 cm = 25 square centimeters\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one face by the number of faces (6) to find the total surface area of the cube.\n\nTotal surface area = 6 × 25 square centimeters = 150 square centimeters\n\nThe total surface area of the cube is 150 square centimeters."
