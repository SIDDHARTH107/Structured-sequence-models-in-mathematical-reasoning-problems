    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (-3,5) and (4,-2) using slope-intercept form, we first need to find the slope (m) of the line. The formula for finding the slope between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nPlugging in the given points (-3,5) and (4,-2):\n\nm = (-2 - 5) / (4 - (-3))\nm = (-7) / (7)\nm = -1\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the slope-intercept form equation, which is:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nWe can plug in one of the points and the slope to find the y-intercept (b). Let's use the point (-3,5):\n\n5 = -1(-3) + b\n5 = 3 + b\nb = 2\n\nNow we have both the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b), so we can write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form:\n\ny = -1x + 2\n\nor simply:\n\ny = -x + 2"
