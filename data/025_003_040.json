    "message_2": "The given equation is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. The projective variety defined by this equation is a quadric surface. Since it is a surface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, its dimension is 2.\n\nTo find the singular points, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to each variable and set them equal to zero:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2z-y^2w) = 2xz = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2z-y^2w) = -2yw = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x^2z-y^2w) = x^2 = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}(x^2z-y^2w) = -y^2 = 0$\n\nFrom the third equation, we have $x = 0$. Then, from the first equation, we get $z = 0$. Similarly, from the fourth equation, we have $y = 0$. Then, from the second equation, we get $w = 0$. However, in projective space, the point $(0,0,0,0)$ is not allowed.\n\nThus, there are no singular points on this quadric surface."
