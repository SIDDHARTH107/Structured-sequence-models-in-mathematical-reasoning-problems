    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of factors needed to explain at least 70% of the total variance, we first need to calculate the total variance and then find the cumulative proportion of variance explained by each factor.\n\n1. Calculate the total variance:\nThe total variance is the sum of all eigenvalues:\n2.7 + 2.1 + 1.9 + 1.5 + 1.3 + 1.1 + 1.0 + 0.8 + 0.6 + 0.4 = 13.4\n\n2. Calculate the proportion of variance explained by each factor:\nDivide each eigenvalue by the total variance to find the proportion of variance explained by each factor:\n2.7/13.4 = 0.2015\n2.1/13.4 = 0.1567\n1.9/13.4 = 0.1418\n1.5/13.4 = 0.1119\n1.3/13.4 = 0.0970\n1.1/13.4 = 0.0821\n1.0/13.4 = 0.0746\n0.8/13.4 = 0.0597\n0.6/13.4 = 0.0448\n0.4/13.4 = 0.0299\n\n3. Find the cumulative proportion of variance explained:\nCalculate the cumulative proportion of variance explained by each factor by adding the proportions sequentially:\n0.2015 (Factor 1)\n0.2015 + 0.1567 = 0.3582 (Factor 2)\n0.3582 + 0.1418 = 0.5000 (Factor 3)\n0.5000 + 0.1119 = 0.6119 (Factor 4)\n0.6119 + 0.0970 = 0.7089 (Factor 5)\n\n4. Determine the minimum number of factors needed to explain at least 70% of the total variance:\nWe can see that the cumulative proportion of variance explained reaches 70% (0.7089) with 5 factors. Therefore, the minimum number of factors needed to explain at least 70% of the total variance is 5."
