    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n    4x - 6y = 14\n\nThis is the same as the second equation. Since both equations represent the same line, the system has infinitely many solutions. The two lines are identical, so every point on the line is a solution to the system."
