    "message_2": "To find the signal x(t) in the time domain, we need to apply the inverse Fourier Transform. The inverse Fourier Transform is given by:\n\nx(t) = ∫[X(f) * e^(j2πft)] df, where the integral is from -∞ to ∞.\n\nWe can break down the integral into three parts corresponding to the three terms in X(f):\n\nx(t) = ∫[2δ(f-5) * e^(j2πft)] df + ∫[3δ(f+5) * e^(j2πft)] df - ∫[jπδ(f) * e^(j2πft)] df\n\nNow, we can use the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, which states that:\n\n∫[f(x) * δ(x-a)] dx = f(a)\n\nApplying the sifting property to each integral, we get:\n\nx(t) = 2 * e^(j2π(5)t) + 3 * e^(-j2π(5)t) - jπ\n\nSo, the signal x(t) in the time domain is:\n\nx(t) = 2e^(j10πt) + 3e^(-j10πt) - jπ"
