    "message_2": "To find the intersection of set A and set B, we look for the elements that are common to both sets. In this case, the elements 2 and 3 are present in both set A and set B. Therefore, the intersection of set A and set B is:\n\nIntersection(A, B) = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we need to prove that this intersection is a subset of each of the sets A and B. A subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. In other words, if all elements of the intersection are also elements of set A and set B, then the intersection is a subset of both sets.\n\nFor set A, we can see that both elements 2 and 3 are members of set A:\n\n2 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A\n\nFor set B, we can also see that both elements 2 and 3 are members of set B:\n\n2 ∈ B and 3 ∈ B\n\nSince all elements of the intersection are members of both sets A and B, we can conclude that the intersection is a subset of each of the sets:\n\nIntersection(A, B) ⊆ A and Intersection(A, B) ⊆ B"
