    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 7x + 9y = 335, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7 and 9, and then find a particular solution for x and y. After that, we can find the general solution for x and y.\n\nStep 1: Find the GCD of 7 and 9 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm\n7 = 1 * 9 + (-1) * 2\n9 = 1 * 7 + 2\n\nThe GCD of 7 and 9 is 1.\n\nStep 2: Find a particular solution for x and y\nSince the GCD of 7 and 9 is 1, there exists a solution for the Diophantine equation. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n335 = 1 * 7x + 1 * 9y\n\nNow, we can find a particular solution for x and y:\n\nx = 335 * 1 = 335\ny = 335 * (-1) = -335\n\nStep 3: Find the general solution for x and y\nSince we have found a particular solution (x, y) = (335, -335), we can find the general solution for x and y by adding multiples of the coefficients of the other variable:\n\nx = 335 + 9t\ny = -335 - 7t\n\nwhere t is an integer.\n\nNow, we can find integer solutions for x and y by plugging in different values of t. For example, if we plug in t = 1:\n\nx = 335 + 9(1) = 344\ny = -335 - 7(1) = -342\n\nSo, one solution for the Diophantine equation 7x + 9y = 335 is (x, y) = (344, -342). There are infinitely many solutions for x and y, and they can be found by plugging in different integer values for t."
