One end of the rod is kept at a temperature of 100°C and the other end is kept at a temperature of 50°C. Find the temperature distribution throughout the rod after 30 seconds have elapsed, assuming that the initial temperature is uniformly 75°C throughout the rod.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nWe are given the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0,t) = 100°C\nT(20,t) = 50°C\n\nAnd the initial condition:\n\nT(x,0) = 75°C\n\nWe can solve this problem using the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution can be written as the product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nT(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = α X''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by αXT:\n\nT'(t)/αT(t) = X''(x)/X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\nT'(t)/αT(t) = X''(x)/X(x) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nT'(t) = -αλT(t)\nX''(x) = -λX(x)\n\nSolving the equation for X(x), we get the general solution:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(√λx) + B*sin(√λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions for X(x):\n\nX(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = 100\nX(20) = A*cos(√λ*20) + B*sin(√λ*20) = 50\n\nSince sin(0) = 0 and cos(0) = 1, we have A = 100. Now, we need to find B and λ such that the second boundary condition is satisfied. This is a transcendental equation and cannot be solved analytically. However, we can use a numerical method, such as the shooting method, to find the values of B and λ that satisfy the boundary condition.\n\nOnce we have the values of A, B, and λ, we can find the solution for T(t) using the equation:\n\nT'(t) = -αλT(t)\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, which can be solved using an integrating factor. The general solution for T(t) is:\n\nT(t) = C*exp(-αλt)\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition T(x,0) = 75°C. Plugging this into the equation for T(x,t), we get:\n\n75 = X(x)T(0)\n\nSince T(0) = C, we have:\n\nC = 75/X(x)\n\nNow, we have the complete solution for the temperature distribution throughout the rod:\n\nT(x,t) = (A*cos(√λx) + B*sin(√λx)) * exp(-αλt)\n\nPlugging in the values of A, B, λ, and α, we can find the temperature distribution throughout the rod after 30 seconds have elapsed."
