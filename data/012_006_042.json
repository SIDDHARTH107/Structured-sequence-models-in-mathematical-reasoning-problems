    "message_2": "This graph is Hamiltonian. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once, except for the starting and ending vertex, which is the same. Here's a Hamiltonian cycle for the given graph:\n\nA -> B -> C -> F -> E -> D -> A\n\nThe graph is not Eulerian because an Eulerian graph requires that all vertices have an even degree. In this graph, all vertices have a degree of 2, except for B and F, which have a degree of 3. Therefore, it is not Eulerian."
