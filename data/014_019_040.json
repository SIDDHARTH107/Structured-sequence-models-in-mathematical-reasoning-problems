If the original block of letters was \"MATHEMATICS IS FUN\", and the cipher text is \"STAEIHNU FISMCTAM\", what is the number of column shifts used in the encryption?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the dimensions of the block of letters. The original message has 17 characters (excluding spaces). We can try different dimensions to see which one gives us the correct ciphertext.\n\nLet's try a 3x6 block:\n\nM A T H E M\nA T I C S I\nS F U N\n\nReading the columns top to bottom, we get: \"MASATFUTHICNEUMS\", which is not the correct ciphertext.\n\nLet's try a 4x5 block:\n\nM A T H E\nM A T I C\nS I S F U\nN\n\nReading the columns top to bottom, we get: \"MMSSAAATITHCIEFNU\", which is not the correct ciphertext either.\n\nNow let's try a 2x9 block:\n\nM A T H E M A T I\nC S I S F U N\n\nReading the columns top to bottom, we get: \"MCATSHESIIFUMANT\", which is not the correct ciphertext.\n\nFinally, let's try a 1x17 block:\n\nM A T H E M A T I C S I S F U N\n\nReading the columns top to bottom, we get: \"MATHEMATICSISFUN\", which is the original message.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of column shifts used in the encryption. We know that the ciphertext is \"STAEIHNU FISMCTAM\". Let's try shifting the columns of the 1x17 block:\n\n1 shift:\n\nS M A T H E M A T I C S I S F U N\n\n2 shifts:\n\nS T A E I H N U M A T I C S I S F\n\n3 shifts:\n\nS T A E I H N U F I S M C T A M\n\nWe can see that it took 3 column shifts to obtain the correct ciphertext. Therefore, the number of column shifts used in the encryption is 3."
