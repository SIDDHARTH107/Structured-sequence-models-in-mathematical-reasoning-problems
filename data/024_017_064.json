    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector $\\vec{v} = (1, 0, 0)$ along the curve $C(t)$, we first need to find the tangent vector to the curve at each point. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the curve with respect to the parameter $t$:\n\n$$\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = (-2\\sin t, 2\\cos t, 3)$$\n\nNow, we need to find a vector that is parallel to the tangent vector and has the same direction as $\\vec{v}$. To do this, we can use the covariant derivative. The covariant derivative of a vector field $\\vec{V}(t)$ along the curve $C(t)$ is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{D\\vec{V}}{dt} = \\frac{d\\vec{V}}{dt} - \\langle \\frac{d\\vec{V}}{dt}, \\frac{dC}{dt} \\rangle \\frac{dC}{dt}$$\n\nwhere $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the inner product. In our case, $\\vec{V}(t) = (1, 0, 0)$, so its derivative with respect to $t$ is $\\frac{d\\vec{V}}{dt} = (0, 0, 0)$. Thus, the covariant derivative is:\n\n$$\\frac{D\\vec{V}}{dt} = (0, 0, 0) - \\langle (0, 0, 0), (-2\\sin t, 2\\cos t, 3) \\rangle (-2\\sin t, 2\\cos t, 3) = (0, 0, 0)$$\n\nSince the covariant derivative is zero, the vector $\\vec{v} = (1, 0, 0)$ is parallel-transported along the curve $C(t)$. Therefore, the parallel transport of the vector $\\vec{v}$ along the curve $C(t)$ is simply $\\vec{v} = (1, 0, 0)$."
