    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A × B and B, denoted as (A × B) ∩ B. This is the set of elements that are common to both A × B and B.\n\n(A × B) ∩ B = ∅ (empty set, since there are no common elements)\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B × A. This is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A.\n\nB × A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of B × A and B, denoted as (B × A) ∩ B. This is the set of elements that are common to both B × A and B.\n\n(B × A) ∩ B = ∅ (empty set, since there are no common elements)\n\nNow, let's compare (A × B) ∩ B and (B × A) ∩ B:\n\n(A × B) ∩ B = ∅\n(B × A) ∩ B = ∅\n\nSince both (A × B) ∩ B and (B × A) ∩ B are equal to the empty set, they are equal. However, this does not prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is associative with respect to intersection, as the original statement asked to show that they are not equal.\n\nIt seems there was a misunderstanding in the original statement. The Cartesian product is not associative in general, but the example given does not demonstrate this. The Cartesian product is not associative, meaning that (A × B) × C ≠ A × (B × C) for some sets A, B, and C. The intersection operation is not relevant to the non-associativity of the Cartesian product."
