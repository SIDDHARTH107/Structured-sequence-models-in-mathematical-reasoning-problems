    "message_1": "A company hires two types of employees: high productivity (HP) and low productivity (LP). HP employees produce $100/hour, and LP employees produce only $50/hour. However, the company cannot observe an employee's productivity before hiring them. The company can offer a wage of $60/hour or $80/hour. HP employees are willing to accept the lower wage, but LP employees will only accept the higher wage. The employees know their own productivity type but the company does not.\n \nSuppose that a new employee signals their productivity type by choosing whether to wear a red shirt (HP) or a blue shirt (LP). If the company sees a red shirt, they will offer $60/hour, and if they see a blue shirt, they will offer $80/hour. \n\n1) If the employee is an HP, what is their expected hourly wage?\n2) If the employee is an LP, what is their expected hourly wage?\n3) Is there a pooling equilibrium in which both types of employees wear the same shirt color? If so, what color do they wear and what wage do they receive? If not, explain why not.",
    "message_2": "1) If the employee is an HP, they will choose to wear a red shirt to signal their productivity type. In this case, the company will offer them a wage of $60/hour. Therefore, their expected hourly wage is $60.\n\n2) If the employee is an LP, they will choose to wear a blue shirt to signal their productivity type. In this case, the company will offer them a wage of $80/hour. Therefore, their expected hourly wage is $80.\n\n3) There is no pooling equilibrium in which both types of employees wear the same shirt color. If both types wore the same color, the company would not be able to distinguish between HP and LP employees and would have to offer the same wage to both types. However, this would not be a stable equilibrium, as HP employees would have an incentive to deviate and wear a different color to signal their higher productivity and receive a higher wage. Similarly, if the company offered the same wage to both types, LP employees would not accept the lower wage, and HP employees would have no incentive to signal their productivity. Therefore, there is no pooling equilibrium in this scenario."
