    "message_2": "A 2-dimensional simplex is a triangle formed by connecting three vertices. In the given simplicial complex, we can count the number of 2-dimensional simplices (triangles) as follows:\n\n1. The large outer triangle formed by vertices A, B, and C.\n2. The triangle formed by vertices A, B, and D.\n3. The triangle formed by vertices A, C, and E.\n4. The triangle formed by vertices B, C, and F.\n\nThere are no other triangles in the simplicial complex. Therefore, there are a total of 4 two-dimensional simplices in this simplicial complex."
