    "message_2": "To find the percentage of students who do not play either soccer or basketball, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe percentage of students who play soccer or basketball is the sum of the percentage of students who play each sport minus the percentage of students who play both sports:\n\n(Soccer) + (Basketball) - (Both) = 45% + 35% - 20% = 60%\n\nSince the total percentage of students is 100%, the percentage of students who do not play either soccer or basketball is:\n\n100% - 60% = 40%\n\nSo, 40% of the students in the school do not play either soccer or basketball."
