If you know that the plaintext message contains the word \"CRYPTANALYSIS\", what is the letter-to-letter mapping for this cipher?",
    "message_2": "To find the letter-to-letter mapping for this cipher, we first need to identify where the word \"CRYPTANALYSIS\" appears in the ciphertext. We can see that the ciphertext has the same length as the word \"CRYPTANALYSIS\", so it is likely that the entire ciphertext corresponds to the plaintext word.\n\nCiphertext: KGVVKPIGCEJGTU\nPlaintext:  CRYPTANALYSIS\n\nNow, we can create the letter-to-letter mapping based on this correspondence:\n\nK -> C\nG -> R\nV -> Y\nP -> P\nI -> T\nC -> A\nE -> N\nJ -> L\nT -> S\nU -> I\n\nSo, the letter-to-letter mapping for this cipher is:\n\nA -> N\nC -> A\nE -> N\nG -> R\nI -> T\nJ -> L\nK -> C\nP -> P\nT -> S\nU -> I\nV -> Y"
