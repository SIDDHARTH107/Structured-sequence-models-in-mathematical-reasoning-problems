    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2cos²x - 3cosx + 1 = 0, we can first try to factor the quadratic equation.\n\nLet y = cosx. Then the equation becomes:\n\n2y² - 3y + 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can try to factor this equation:\n\n(2y - 1)(y - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for y:\n\n2y - 1 = 0 => y = 1/2\ny - 1 = 0 => y = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding values of x for each value of y:\n\n1) y = cosx = 1/2\n\nx = arccos(1/2)\nx = 60° and x = 360° - 60° = 300° (since cosine is positive in both the first and fourth quadrants)\n\n2) y = cosx = 1\n\nx = arccos(1)\nx = 0°\n\nSo, the solutions for x between 0 and 360 degrees are:\n\nx = 0°, 60°, and 300°."
