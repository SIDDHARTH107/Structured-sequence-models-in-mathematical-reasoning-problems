    "message_1": "A student is standing at point A (3,4) and she aims to throw a ball towards point B (8,10). If the initial velocity of the ball is 16 meters per second, what is the projection of the velocity vector of the ball onto the line connecting points A and B? Use trigonometry to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the projection of the velocity vector onto the line connecting points A and B, we first need to find the angle between the velocity vector and the line connecting points A and B.\n\nLet's find the slope of the line connecting points A and B:\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\nm = (10 - 4) / (8 - 3)\nm = 6 / 5\n\nNow, let's find the angle θ between the line connecting points A and B and the x-axis:\ntan(θ) = m\nθ = arctan(m)\nθ = arctan(6/5)\n\nNow, let's find the angle α between the velocity vector and the x-axis. Since the initial velocity is horizontal, α is equal to θ:\nα = θ\n\nNow, we can find the projection of the velocity vector onto the line connecting points A and B using the dot product formula:\nprojection = |v| * cos(α)\n\nwhere |v| is the magnitude of the velocity vector (16 m/s) and α is the angle between the velocity vector and the line connecting points A and B.\n\nprojection = 16 * cos(arctan(6/5))\n\nTo find the cosine of the arctan(6/5), we can use the following trigonometric identity:\ncos(arctan(x)) = 1 / sqrt(1 + x^2)\n\nIn our case, x = 6/5, so:\ncos(arctan(6/5)) = 1 / sqrt(1 + (6/5)^2)\ncos(arctan(6/5)) = 1 / sqrt(1 + 36/25)\ncos(arctan(6/5)) = 1 / sqrt(61/25)\ncos(arctan(6/5)) = 5 / sqrt(61)\n\nNow, we can find the projection of the velocity vector:\nprojection = 16 * (5 / sqrt(61))\nprojection ≈ 16 * 0.6396\nprojection ≈ 10.23 m/s\n\nThe projection of the velocity vector of the ball onto the line connecting points A and B is approximately 10.23 meters per second."
