    "message_2": "To show that $f(\\overline{z}) = \\overline{f(z)}$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, we first consider the function $g(z) = f(z) - \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$. Since $f(z)$ is entire, it has a power series representation:\n\n$$f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$$\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$$g(z) = f(z) - \\overline{f(\\overline{z})} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n - \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\overline{a_n \\overline{z}^n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (a_n - \\overline{a_n})z^n$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is real on the real axis, we have $f(x) = \\overline{f(x)}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This implies that $a_n = \\overline{a_n}$ for all $n$, and hence $g(z) = 0$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Therefore, $f(\\overline{z}) = \\overline{f(z)}$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nNow, we use the Schwarz reflection principle. Consider the function $h(z) = f(z)f(-z)$. This function is entire and non-negative on the real axis. Since $f(z)$ is bounded, we have $|h(z)| \\leq M^2$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. By the maximum modulus principle, $h(z)$ is constant, say $h(z) = C$ for some constant $C \\geq 0$. Then, we have $f(z)f(-z) = C$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nAs $y \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty$, we have $|f(iy)|^2 = C$, and since $f(z)$ is bounded, we must have $C = 0$. Thus, $f(iy) \\rightarrow 0$ as $y \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty$.\n\nFinally, we want to find the largest possible constant $C$ such that $|f(z)|\\le C \\frac{\\cosh b}{\\cosh a}$ for all $z=x+iy$ where $0\\leq a$, $0\\leq b\\leq a+\\pi$. Since $f(z)$ is bounded, we have $|f(z)| \\leq M$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Therefore, we can choose $C = M$ as the largest possible constant, and we have:\n\n$$|f(z)| \\leq M \\frac{\\cosh b}{\\cosh a}$$\n\nfor all $z = x + iy$ where $0 \\leq a$, $0 \\leq b \\leq a + \\pi$."
