    "message_1": "Suppose Bob wants to send an encrypted email to Alice using the RSA algorithm with a public key (n, e) = (3233, 17) and his own private key d = 2753. If Bob's message is encoded as the integer M = 1234, what is the corresponding digital signature that Bob should attach to the encrypted email?",
    "message_2": "To create a digital signature using the RSA algorithm, Bob needs to use his private key d. The digital signature S can be computed as follows:\n\nS ≡ M^d (mod n)\n\nwhere M is the message, d is the private key, and n is part of the public key.\n\nIn this case, M = 1234, d = 2753, and n = 3233. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nS ≡ 1234^2753 (mod 3233)\n\nTo calculate this, we can use the fast exponentiation method (also known as exponentiation by squaring). This method involves breaking down the exponent into powers of 2 and then combining the results.\n\n1234^2753 (mod 3233) = 1234^(2048 + 512 + 128 + 64 + 1) (mod 3233)\n\nNow, we calculate the powers of 1234 modulo 3233:\n\n1234^1 (mod 3233) = 1234\n1234^2 (mod 3233) = 699\n1234^4 (mod 3233) = 1691\n1234^8 (mod 3233) = 3218\n1234^16 (mod 3233) = 2038\n1234^32 (mod 3233) = 3014\n1234^64 (mod 3233) = 1754\n1234^128 (mod 3233) = 2896\n1234^256 (mod 3233) = 3159\n1234^512 (mod 3233) = 2201\n1234^1024 (mod 3233) = 2790\n1234^2048 (mod 3233) = 2401\n\nNow, we multiply the relevant powers together and take the result modulo 3233:\n\nS = (1234^2048 * 1234^512 * 1234^128 * 1234^64 * 1234^1) (mod 3233)\nS = (2401 * 2201 * 2896 * 1754 * 1234) (mod 3233)\nS = 8551972404 (mod 3233)\nS = 855\n\nSo, the digital signature that Bob should attach to the encrypted email is 855."
