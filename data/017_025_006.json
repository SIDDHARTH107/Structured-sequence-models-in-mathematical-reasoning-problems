Determine the possible group structures.\n3. Count the number of non-isomorphic groups for each structure.\n\nStep 1: Prime factorization of 120\n120 = 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1\n\nStep 2: Possible group structures\nUsing the prime factorization, we can determine the possible group structures by considering the divisors of 120. The divisors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.\n\nStep 3: Counting non-isomorphic groups\nWe can use the following rules to count the number of non-isomorphic groups for each structure:\n\n- There is always one abelian group for each order.\n- For non-abelian groups, we can use the Sylow theorems to determine the number of non-isomorphic groups.\n\nFor order 120, we have the following non-isomorphic groups:\n\n1. C_120 (cyclic group of order 120)\n2. C_2 x C_60 (direct product of cyclic groups of order 2 and 60)\n3. C_3 x C_40 (direct product of cyclic groups of order 3 and 40)\n4. C_5 x C_24 (direct product of cyclic groups of order 5 and 24)\n5. A_5 (alternating group of degree 5)\n\nIn total, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
