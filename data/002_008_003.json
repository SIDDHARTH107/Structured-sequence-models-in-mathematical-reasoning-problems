    "message_1": "A cone has a height of 8 cm and a radius of 4 cm. What is the volume of the cone?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 4 cm and the height (h) is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(4²)(8)\nVolume = (1/3)π(16)(8)\nVolume = (1/3)π(128)\n\nNow, we can multiply the numbers:\n\nVolume ≈ (1/3)(3.14159)(128)\nVolume ≈ (1.047197)(128)\nVolume ≈ 134.041286 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is approximately 134.04 cm³."
