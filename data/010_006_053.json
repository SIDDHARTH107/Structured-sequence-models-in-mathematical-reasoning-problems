Calculate the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X,f(\\ast))$ of X based at the point $f(\\ast)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of X, we will use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. First, we need to choose two open sets U and V such that their union covers X, and their intersection is simply connected.\n\nLet U be the interior of the square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ along with a small neighborhood of the boundary, and let V be a small neighborhood of the identified boundary point in X. Then, U is homeomorphic to an open disk, and V is homeomorphic to an open cylinder. Their intersection U ∩ V is homeomorphic to an annulus, which is simply connected.\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. Since U is homeomorphic to an open disk, its fundamental group is trivial, i.e., $\\pi_1(U) = 0$. V is homeomorphic to an open cylinder, so its fundamental group is isomorphic to the fundamental group of a circle, i.e., $\\pi_1(V) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The intersection U ∩ V is simply connected, so its fundamental group is trivial, i.e., $\\pi_1(U ∩ V) = 0$.\n\nAccording to the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, the fundamental group of X is the free product of the fundamental groups of U and V, with the fundamental group of their intersection factored out:\n\n$\\pi_1(X) \\cong (\\pi_1(U) * \\pi_1(V)) / \\pi_1(U ∩ V) \\cong (0 * \\mathbb{Z}) / 0 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSo, the fundamental group of X based at the point $f(\\ast)$ is isomorphic to the integers, i.e., $\\pi_1(X, f(\\ast)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
