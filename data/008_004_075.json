    "message_2": "First, we can write the system of equations in matrix form:\n\n```\n| 2  4  6 | |x|   |0|\n| 4  5  4 | |y| = |0|\n| 8  4  2 | |z|   |0|\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the matrix:\n\n1. Divide the first row by 2:\n\n```\n| 1  2  3 | |x|   |0|\n| 4  5  4 | |y| = |0|\n| 8  4  2 | |z|   |0|\n```\n\n2. Replace the second row with (-4 * first row + second row) and the third row with (-8 * first row + third row):\n\n```\n| 1  2  3 | |x|   |0|\n| 0 -3 -8 | |y| = |0|\n| 0 -12 -22| |z|   |0|\n```\n\n3. Divide the second row by -3:\n\n```\n| 1  2   3 | |x|   |0|\n| 0  1  8/3| |y| = |0|\n| 0 -12 -22| |z|   |0|\n```\n\n4. Replace the first row with (-2 * second row + first row) and the third row with (12 * second row + third row):\n\n```\n| 1  0  -1 | |x|   |0|\n| 0  1  8/3| |y| = |0|\n| 0  0   0 | |z|   |0|\n```\n\nNow, we have the row echelon form of the matrix. The third row represents the equation 0 = 0, which is always true and does not provide any information about the variables. The first two rows represent the following system of equations:\n\n```\nx - z = 0\ny + (8/3)z = 0\n```\n\nWe can express x and y in terms of z:\n\n```\nx = z\ny = -(8/3)z\n```\n\nThe general solution of the system is given by:\n\n```\n(x, y, z) = z(1, -8/3, 1)\n```\n\nwhere z is a free variable."
