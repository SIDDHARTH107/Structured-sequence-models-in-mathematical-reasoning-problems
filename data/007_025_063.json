    "message_2": "In a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we have a prime number (p) and a primitive root modulo p (g). In this case, p = 23. However, the primitive root modulo p (g) is not provided. Let's assume g = 5, which is a common choice for this type of problem.\n\nNow, we can calculate the public keys for both parties:\n\nParty A (private key a = 11):\nA = g^a mod p\nA = 5^11 mod 23\nA = 161051 mod 23\nA = 6\n\nParty B (private key b = 7):\nB = g^b mod p\nB = 5^7 mod 23\nB = 78125 mod 23\nB = 10\n\nNow, both parties can compute the shared secret key (s) using the other party's public key:\n\nParty A:\ns = B^a mod p\ns = 10^11 mod 23\ns = 25937424601 mod 23\ns = 9\n\nParty B:\ns = A^b mod p\ns = 6^7 mod 23\ns = 279936 mod 23\ns = 9\n\nBoth parties have derived the same shared secret key, s = 9."
