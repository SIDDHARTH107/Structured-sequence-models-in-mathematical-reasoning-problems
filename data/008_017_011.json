    "message_2": "The given system of linear equations is not sparse, as there are no zero elements in the coefficient matrix. However, we can still solve the system using Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion methods.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n|  2  3  4 | 10 |\n|  5  6  7 | 20 |\n|  8  9 10 | 30 |\n\nNow, perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2.5 times the first row from the second row, and 4 times the first row from the third row:\n\n|  2   3   4 | 10 |\n|  0  -1.5 -3 | -5 |\n|  0  -3  -6 | -10 |\n\nStep 2: Multiply the second row by -2/3:\n\n|  2   3    4 |  10 |\n|  0   1    2 |  10/3 |\n|  0  -3  -6 | -10 |\n\nStep 3: Add 3 times the second row to the third row:\n\n|  2   3   4 |  10  |\n|  0   1   2 |  10/3 |\n|  0   0   0 |   0  |\n\nThe third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 0, which is always true. Therefore, we have an underdetermined system with infinitely many solutions. To find the general solution, we can express z as a free variable t:\n\nz = t\n\nNow, substitute z back into the second equation:\n\ny + 2t = 10/3\n\ny = 10/3 - 2t\n\nFinally, substitute y and z back into the first equation:\n\n2x + 3(10/3 - 2t) + 4t = 10\n\n2x + 10 - 6t + 4t = 10\n\n2x = 6t\n\nx = 3t\n\nThe general solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 3t\ny = 10/3 - 2t\nz = t\n\nwhere t is any real number."
