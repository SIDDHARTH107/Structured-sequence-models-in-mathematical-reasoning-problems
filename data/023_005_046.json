    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. Let Y(w) be the Fourier transform of y(x), and let F{f(x)} denote the Fourier transform of a function f(x).\n\nGiven: y'' + 4y' + 4y = 4cos(2x)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of both sides:\n\nF{y''} + 4F{y'} + 4F{y} = 4F{cos(2x)}\n\nUsing the properties of the Fourier transform, we have:\n\n(-w^2)Y(w) + 4(-iw)Y(w) + 4Y(w) = 4[π(δ(w - 2) + δ(w + 2))]\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(w):\n\nY(w) = 4[π(δ(w - 2) + δ(w + 2))] / (w^2 - 4iw + 4)\n\nNext, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(w) to obtain y(x):\n\ny(x) = F^{-1}{Y(w)}\n\ny(x) = F^{-1}{4[π(δ(w - 2) + δ(w + 2))] / (w^2 - 4iw + 4)}\n\nTo find the inverse Fourier transform, we can use the convolution theorem, which states that the inverse Fourier transform of a product of two functions is the convolution of their inverse Fourier transforms. Let's denote the inverse Fourier transforms as follows:\n\nh(x) = F^{-1}{4π(δ(w - 2) + δ(w + 2))}\ng(x) = F^{-1}{1 / (w^2 - 4iw + 4)}\n\nNow, we need to find h(x) and g(x):\n\nh(x) = 2cos(2x)\ng(x) = e^{-2x}u(x), where u(x) is the unit step function (u(x) = 1 for x >= 0, and u(x) = 0 for x < 0)\n\nNow, we can find y(x) by convolving h(x) and g(x):\n\ny(x) = (h * g)(x) = ∫ h(t)g(x - t) dt, where the integral is taken over all t\n\ny(x) = ∫ 2cos(2t)e^{-2(x - t)}u(x - t) dt\n\nTo satisfy the initial conditions y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 0, we can differentiate y(x) and set x = 0:\n\ny'(x) = ∫ [-4sin(2t)e^{-2(x - t)} + 2cos(2t)(-2)e^{-2(x - t)}]u(x - t) dt\n\ny'(0) = ∫ [-4sin(2t)e^{2t} + 4cos(2t)e^{2t}]u(-t) dt\n\nSince u(-t) = 0 for t > 0, the integral is zero, and y'(0) = 0.\n\nThus, the solution to the given differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = ∫ 2cos(2t)e^{-2(x - t)}u(x - t) dt"
