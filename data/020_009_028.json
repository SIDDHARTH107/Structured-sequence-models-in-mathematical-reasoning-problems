    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. Each product passes through two machines, X and Y. The time required to process each unit of product A on machines X and Y is 3 and 5 minutes, respectively. The time required to process each unit of product B on machines X and Y is 2 and 4 minutes, respectively. The factory has 5 hours of machine time available on machine X and 7 hours of machine time available on machine Y for producing the two products. If the profit per unit of product A is $10 and per unit of product B is $15, how many units of each product should the factory produce to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for the machine time available are:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 5 * 60 (Machine X constraint, in minutes)\n5x + 4y ≤ 7 * 60 (Machine Y constraint, in minutes)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 300\n5x + 4y ≤ 420\n\nWe can find the boundary points by setting the inequalities as equalities:\n\n3x + 2y = 300\n5x + 4y = 420\n\nSolving these equations, we get the following points:\n\n(0, 0) - When x = 0 and y = 0\n(100, 0) - When x = 100 and y = 0\n(0, 150) - When x = 0 and y = 150\n(60, 90) - When x = 60 and y = 90 (Intersection of the two lines)\n\nNow we will evaluate the objective function P at each of these points:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\nP(100, 0) = 10(100) + 15(0) = $1000\nP(0, 150) = 10(0) + 15(150) = $2250\nP(60, 90) = 10(60) + 15(90) = $600 + $1350 = $1950\n\nThe maximum profit is $2250, which occurs when the factory produces 0 units of product A and 150 units of product B."
