    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, individuals with the medical condition) in n trials (the sample size)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of having the medical condition, 0.5% or 0.005)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the sample size of 2000 people)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of individuals with the medical condition)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 10 individuals will have the medical condition, which means we need to find the probability of having 10 or more successes. To do this, we can find the probability of having fewer than 10 successes and subtract that from 1:\n\nP(X >= 10) = 1 - P(X < 10)\n\nWe need to calculate the probability of having 0 to 9 successes:\n\nP(X < 10) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9)\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate each probability and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 10) = Σ [C(2000, k) * (0.005)^k * (0.995)^(2000-k)] for k = 0 to 9\n\nAfter calculating each probability and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X < 10) ≈ 0.5833\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least 10 individuals with the medical condition:\n\nP(X >= 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - 0.5833 ≈ 0.4167\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 individuals in the sample of 2000 people will have the medical condition is approximately 41.67%."
