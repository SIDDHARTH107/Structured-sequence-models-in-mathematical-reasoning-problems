    "message_1": "A company wants to organize a team-building exercise for 10 employees. They plan to split the employees into teams of 2 for various activities. In how many ways can the company create the teams if each employee must be paired with exactly one other employee?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways to create teams of 2 from 10 employees, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of employees (10 in this case) and k is the size of the teams (2 in this case).\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9 * 8!)/(2 * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 90/2\n\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nSo, there are 45 ways to create teams of 2 from 10 employees."
