    "message_1": "There are 15 students in a math club, and the club wants to form discussion groups with 5 students each. How many different groups can be formed?\n\nHint: This problem involves finding the number of combinations of 5 students that can be selected from a set of 15 students.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of combinations of selecting 5 students from a set of 15 students, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (15), k is the number of students in each group (5), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5!(15-5)!)\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5!10!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n15! = 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n\nNow, plug the factorials back into the combination formula:\n\nC(15, 5) = (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can cancel out the common factors in the numerator and denominator:\n\nC(15, 5) = (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(15, 5) = (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11) / (120)\n\nNow, perform the multiplication and division:\n\nC(15, 5) = 45,045 / 120\n\nC(15, 5) = 3003\n\nSo, there are 3003 different groups of 5 students that can be formed from a set of 15 students."
