    "message_1": "A block cipher operates on blocks of n bits. If a block cipher uses a 128-bit block size and has a key length of 256 bits, how many distinct keys can be generated for this cipher?",
    "message_2": "For a block cipher with a key length of 256 bits, there are 2^256 distinct keys that can be generated. This is because each bit can have 2 possible values (0 or 1), and there are 256 bits in the key. So, the total number of distinct keys is:\n\n2^256 = 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,936"
