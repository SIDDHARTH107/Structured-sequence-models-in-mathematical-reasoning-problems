    "message_2": "To find the Euler characteristic of a closed surface with genus 2, we can use the formula for the Euler characteristic of a closed surface of genus g:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nIn this case, the genus g is 2, so we can plug that into the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(2) = 2 - 4 = -2\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of a closed surface with genus 2 is -2.\n\nIn the context of topological quantum field theory, the Euler characteristic is related to the partition function of the theory on the surface. The partition function is a topological invariant, meaning it does not depend on the specific details of the surface, only its topology. In this case, the partition function would be invariant under continuous deformations of the genus 2 surface, and its value would be related to the Euler characteristic -2."
