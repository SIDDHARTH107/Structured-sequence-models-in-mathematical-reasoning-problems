    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext message \"101101\" using a Feistel cipher structure with two rounds and the given keys and S-boxes, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the plaintext into two equal parts: L0 = \"101\" and R0 = \"101\".\n2. Perform the first round with key K1 = \"010101\".\n3. Perform the second round with key K2 = \"001100\".\n4. Combine the results to get the ciphertext.\n\nFirst Round:\n1. Calculate the function F(R0, K1).\n   - XOR R0 with K1: \"101\" XOR \"010\" = \"111\" (we only need the first 3 bits of K1)\n   - Apply S-box 1 to each bit: \"000\"\n2. XOR the result with L0: \"101\" XOR \"000\" = \"101\"\n3. Swap L0 and R0: L1 = \"101\" and R1 = \"101\"\n\nSecond Round:\n1. Calculate the function F(R1, K2).\n   - XOR R1 with K2: \"101\" XOR \"001\" = \"100\" (we only need the first 3 bits of K2)\n   - Apply S-box 2 to each bit: \"110\"\n2. XOR the result with L1: \"101\" XOR \"110\" = \"011\"\n3. Swap L1 and R1: L2 = \"011\" and R2 = \"101\"\n\nCombine L2 and R2 to get the ciphertext: \"011101\"\n\nSo, the ciphertext produced by the Feistel cipher structure is \"011101\"."
