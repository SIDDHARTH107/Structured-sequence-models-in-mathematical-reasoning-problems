    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set with 100 elements. If set A contains 30 elements, what is the number of elements in A's complement? Verify that the union of set A and its complement is equal to the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "Let A' be the complement of set A. Since the universal set U contains 100 elements and set A contains 30 elements, the number of elements in A's complement (A') is the difference between the total elements in U and the elements in A. \n\nSo, the number of elements in A' is:\n\n|A'| = |U| - |A| = 100 - 30 = 70\n\nNow, let's verify that the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements that are in either of the two sets. Since A and A' are complementary sets, their union will contain all the elements in the universal set U.\n\nA âˆª A' = U\n\nIn this case, the union of set A and its complement A' contains all 100 elements of the universal set U, which confirms that the union of set A and its complement is equal to the universal set U."
