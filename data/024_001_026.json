    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we need to compute the first, second, and third derivatives of the position vector $r(t)$, and then use the formulas for curvature and torsion.\n\nFirst, let's find the first, second, and third derivatives of $r(t)$:\n\n$r(t) = 2ti + (t^2 - 1)j + 2t^2k$\n\n$r'(t) = \\frac{dr}{dt} = 2i + 2tj + 4tk$\n\n$r''(t) = \\frac{d^2r}{dt^2} = 2j + 4k$\n\n$r'''(t) = \\frac{d^3r}{dt^3} = 0$\n\nNow, let's find the curvature, which is given by the formula:\n\n$κ(t) = \\frac{\\lVert r'(t) \\times r''(t) \\rVert}{\\lVert r'(t) \\rVert^3}$\n\nAt time $t=1$, we have:\n\n$r'(1) = 2i + 2j + 4k$\n\n$r''(1) = 2j + 4k$\n\nNow, let's compute the cross product $r'(1) \\times r''(1)$:\n\n$r'(1) \\times r''(1) = \\begin{vmatrix} i & j & k \\\\ 2 & 2 & 4 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 4 \\end{vmatrix} = 8i - 8j + 4k$\n\nNow, let's compute the magnitudes of $r'(1)$ and $r'(1) \\times r''(1)$:\n\n$\\lVert r'(1) \\rVert = \\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{24}$\n\n$\\lVert r'(1) \\times r''(1) \\rVert = \\sqrt{8^2 + (-8)^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{144} = 12$\n\nNow, we can find the curvature at time $t=1$:\n\n$κ(1) = \\frac{12}{(\\sqrt{24})^3} = \\frac{12}{24\\sqrt{24}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{24}}$\n\nNow, let's find the torsion, which is given by the formula:\n\n$τ(t) = \\frac{(r'(t) \\times r''(t)) \\cdot r'''(t)}{\\lVert r'(t) \\times r''(t) \\rVert^2}$\n\nSince $r'''(t) = 0$, the torsion at any time $t$ is:\n\n$τ(t) = \\frac{(r'(t) \\times r''(t)) \\cdot 0}{\\lVert r'(t) \\times r''(t) \\rVert^2} = 0$\n\nSo, the curvature at time $t=1$ is $κ(1) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{24}}$, and the torsion is $τ(1) = 0$."
