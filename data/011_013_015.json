    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Polya Enumeration Theorem (PET), which is a combinatorial method for counting objects under a group action. In this case, the group action is the rotation of the necklace.\n\nLet's denote the number of blue beads as B and the number of red beads as R. We want to form a necklace of length 5 with 3 blue beads and 2 red beads (B=3, R=2).\n\nAccording to PET, the number of distinct necklaces can be calculated as follows:\n\n(1) Calculate the number of necklaces for each possible rotation (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).\n(2) Add up the results and divide by the total number of rotations (5).\n\nFor each rotation, we can use the following formula:\n\n(B^a * R^b + B^c * R^d + ...)/5\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are the number of cycles of each color in the rotation.\n\n(1) For rotation 0 (no rotation), there is only one cycle for each color:\n(B^1 * R^1)/5 = (3^1 * 2^1)/5 = 6/5\n\n(2) For rotation 1, there are two cycles for blue and one cycle for red:\n(B^2 * R^1)/5 = (3^2 * 2^1)/5 = 18/5\n\n(3) For rotation 2, there is one cycle for each color:\n(B^1 * R^1)/5 = (3^1 * 2^1)/5 = 6/5\n\n(4) For rotation 3, there are two cycles for blue and one cycle for red:\n(B^2 * R^1)/5 = (3^2 * 2^1)/5 = 18/5\n\n(5) For rotation 4, there is one cycle for each color:\n(B^1 * R^1)/5 = (3^1 * 2^1)/5 = 6/5\n\nNow, add up the results and divide by the total number of rotations (5):\n\n(6/5 + 18/5 + 6/5 + 18/5 + 6/5) / 5 = (54/5) / 5 = 54/25\n\nSo, there are 54/25 distinct necklaces of length 5 that can be formed with 3 blue beads and 2 red beads. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a necklace, we must have made an error in our calculations.\n\nLet's try another approach using simple combinatorics:\n\nWe have 5 positions in the necklace, and we need to place 2 red beads. We can do this in the following ways:\n\n1. R R B B B\n2. R B R B B\n3. R B B R B\n4. R B B B R\n\nNote that the last two cases are rotations of each other, so they are considered the same. Therefore, there are only 3 distinct necklaces of length 5 that can be formed with 3 blue beads and 2 red beads."
