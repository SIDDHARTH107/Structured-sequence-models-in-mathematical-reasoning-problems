    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of the tetrahedron after it has been subdivided, we first need to find the side length of the smaller congruent tetrahedra.\n\nConsider the original tetrahedron with side length 2. When it is subdivided into 8 smaller congruent tetrahedra, the side length of each smaller tetrahedron is half the side length of the original tetrahedron. Therefore, the side length of each smaller tetrahedron is 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the surface area of one of these smaller tetrahedra and then multiply it by 8 to find the total surface area.\n\nThe surface area of a regular tetrahedron can be found using the formula:\n\nSurface area = √3 * (side length)^2\n\nFor the smaller tetrahedra with side length 1, the surface area is:\n\nSurface area = √3 * (1)^2 = √3\n\nNow, we multiply the surface area of one smaller tetrahedron by 8 to find the total surface area:\n\nTotal surface area = 8 * √3 ≈ 13.8564\n\nSo, the total surface area of the tetrahedron after it has been subdivided into 8 smaller congruent tetrahedra is approximately 13.8564 square units."
