Draw a number line with the numbers 7, 8, and 9 marked on it.\n2. Place an open circle at 8, since x > 8 does not include the value 8.\n3. Draw an arrow pointing to the right from the open circle at 8, indicating that all values greater than 8 are part of the solution set.\n\nThe number line representation shows that the solution set includes all values greater than 8."
