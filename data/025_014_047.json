    "message_1": "What is the Riemann-Roch theorem for a genus 2 hyperelliptic curve and how many linearly independent holomorphic differentials does this curve have?\n\nLet C be a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 and L be a line bundle over C such that deg(L) = 2g - 2 + n, for some non-negative integer n. Using the Riemann-Roch theorem, find the dimension of the space of global sections of L, i.e., show that h0(L) - h1(L) = deg(L) + 1 and determine the number of linearly independent holomorphic differentials on C.",
    "message_2": "The Riemann-Roch theorem for a compact Riemann surface C of genus g and a line bundle L over C is given by:\n\nh0(L) - h1(L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nIn our case, C is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2, so g = 2. We are given that deg(L) = 2g - 2 + n = 2(2) - 2 + n = 2 + n for some non-negative integer n. Plugging these values into the Riemann-Roch theorem, we get:\n\nh0(L) - h1(L) = (2 + n) + 1 - 2 = n + 1\n\nNow, let's determine the number of linearly independent holomorphic differentials on C. A holomorphic differential on C corresponds to a global section of the canonical bundle K_C. Since C is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2, we have deg(K_C) = 2g - 2 = 2. Applying the Riemann-Roch theorem to K_C, we get:\n\nh0(K_C) - h1(K_C) = deg(K_C) + 1 - g = 2 + 1 - 2 = 1\n\nSince h1(K_C) = 0 for a hyperelliptic curve, we have h0(K_C) = 1. This means that there is only one linearly independent holomorphic differential on C."
