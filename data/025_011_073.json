    "message_1": "Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2$ and let $P = (-1,1)$ and $Q = (0,\\sqrt{2})$ be two points on $E$. Here $\\sqrt{2}$ denotes the positive square root of 2. Compute the coordinates of $P + Q$ on $E$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the sum of two points $P$ and $Q$ on an elliptic curve, we need to find the line that passes through $P$ and $Q$, and then find the third point of intersection of this line with the curve, and finally reflect this point over the x-axis to obtain $P+Q$.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope of the line passing through $P$ and $Q$. Since $P=(-1,1)$ and $Q=(0,\\sqrt{2})$, the slope $m$ is given by:\n\n$m = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{0 - (-1)} = \\sqrt{2} - 1$\n\nNow, let's find the equation of the line passing through $P$ and $Q$. Using the point-slope form, we have:\n\n$y - 1 = (\\sqrt{2} - 1)(x + 1)$\n\nNow, we need to find the third point of intersection of this line with the elliptic curve $E$. To do this, we substitute the expression for $y$ from the line equation into the curve equation:\n\n$(1 + (\\sqrt{2} - 1)(x + 1))^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$x^3 + 2x + 2 - (1 + 2(\\sqrt{2} - 1)x + (2 - 2\\sqrt{2} + 1)x^2) = 0$\n\n$x^3 - (2 - 2\\sqrt{2} + 1)x^2 + (2\\sqrt{2} - 2)x = 0$\n\n$x^3 - x^2(3 - 2\\sqrt{2}) + x(2\\sqrt{2} - 2) = 0$\n\nNow, we know that this cubic equation has three roots, corresponding to the x-coordinates of the three points of intersection of the line and the curve. Since we already know that $x=-1$ and $x=0$ are two of these roots (corresponding to points $P$ and $Q$), we can find the third root by dividing the cubic polynomial by $(x+1)x$:\n\n$(x^3 - x^2(3 - 2\\sqrt{2}) + x(2\\sqrt{2} - 2)) / (x(x+1)) = x^2 - (1 - 2\\sqrt{2})x + 2\\sqrt{2} - 2$\n\nSetting this quadratic equation to zero, we can find the third x-coordinate:\n\n$x^2 - (1 - 2\\sqrt{2})x + 2\\sqrt{2} - 2 = 0$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{(2\\sqrt{2} - 1) \\pm \\sqrt{((1 - 2\\sqrt{2})^2 - 4(2\\sqrt{2} - 2))}}{2}$\n\nSince we are looking for the third x-coordinate, we should take the root that is different from the x-coordinates of $P$ and $Q$. In this case, it is:\n\n$x = \\frac{(2\\sqrt{2} - 1) - \\sqrt{((1 - 2\\sqrt{2})^2 - 4(2\\sqrt{2} - 2))}}{2}$\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding y-coordinate by substituting this x-coordinate back into the line equation:\n\n$y = 1 + (\\sqrt{2} - 1)\\left(\\frac{(2\\sqrt{2} - 1) - \\sqrt{((1 - 2\\sqrt{2})^2 - 4(2\\sqrt{2} - 2))}}{2} + 1\\right)$\n\nFinally, we reflect this point over the x-axis to obtain the coordinates of $P+Q$:\n\n$P+Q = \\left(\\frac{(2\\sqrt{2} - 1) - \\sqrt{((1 - 2\\sqrt{2})^2 - 4(2\\sqrt{2} - 2))}}{2}, -\\left(1 + (\\sqrt{2} - 1)\\left(\\frac{(2\\sqrt{2} - 1) - \\sqrt{((1 - 2\\sqrt{2})^2 - 4(2\\sqrt{2} - 2))}}{2} + 1\\right)\\right)\\right)$\n\nThis is the final answer for the coordinates of $P + Q$ on the elliptic curve $E$."
