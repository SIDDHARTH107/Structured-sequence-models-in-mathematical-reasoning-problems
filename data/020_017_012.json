    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of products, A and B. The profit per unit of A is $20, and for B it is $30. The production process for each product requires some raw materials. The total of available raw materials is 400. The requirements for A and B are 2 and 3 units of raw materials, respectively. The manufacturer has to produce at least 10 units of product A, and the maximum number of units of B they can produce is 80. How many units of A and B should the manufacturer produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. Raw materials: 2x + 3y ≤ 400\n2. Minimum units of A: x ≥ 10\n3. Maximum units of B: y ≤ 80\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y = 400 is the equation of a line. To find the intercepts, set x = 0 and solve for y: 3y = 400, y = 400/3 ≈ 133.33. Then set y = 0 and solve for x: 2x = 400, x = 200. So the line passes through the points (0, 133.33) and (200, 0). Since we want the inequality 2x + 3y ≤ 400, the feasible region will be below this line.\n\n2. x ≥ 10 is a vertical line at x = 10. The feasible region is to the right of this line.\n\n3. y ≤ 80 is a horizontal line at y = 80. The feasible region is below this line.\n\nNow we need to find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 10 and y = 80: (10, 80)\n2. Intersection of x = 10 and 2x + 3y = 400: (10, 400/3 - 20/3) = (10, 120)\n3. Intersection of y = 80 and 2x + 3y = 400: (80, 80)\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(10, 80) = 20(10) + 30(80) = 200 + 2400 = 2600\n2. P(10, 120) = 20(10) + 30(120) = 200 + 3600 = 3800\n3. P(80, 80) = 20(80) + 30(80) = 1600 + 2400 = 4000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (80, 80), with a profit of $4000. Therefore, the manufacturer should produce 80 units of product A and 80 units of product B to maximize their profit."
