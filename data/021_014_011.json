    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The cost of producing one unit of each product is given in the table below:\n\n| Product   | Cost/Unit |\n| --------- | --------- |\n| Product A | $20       |\n| Product B | $30       |\n\nThe company has 100 units of raw material and 80 hours of production time available each day. Product A requires 2 units of raw material and 4 hours of production time per unit while Product B requires 4 units of raw material and 5 hours of production time per unit.\n\nUsing genetic algorithms, find the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B the company should produce each day to maximize profit if the selling prices of Product A and Product B are $50 and $70 per unit, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using a genetic algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the problem: Maximize profit by finding the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B to produce each day, given the constraints on raw materials and production time.\n\n2. Encode the solution: Represent the solution as a pair of integers (x, y), where x is the number of units of Product A and y is the number of units of Product B.\n\n3. Create an initial population: Generate a random set of solutions (pairs of integers) that satisfy the constraints on raw materials and production time.\n\n4. Define a fitness function: Calculate the profit for each solution in the population.\n\n5. Perform selection: Select a subset of the population based on their fitness values.\n\n6. Perform crossover: Combine pairs of selected solutions to create new solutions.\n\n7. Perform mutation: Randomly modify some solutions in the population.\n\n8. Evaluate the new population: Calculate the fitness of the new solutions.\n\n9. Repeat steps 5-8 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a sufficiently high fitness value).\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the genetic algorithm:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_initial_population(population_size):\n    population = []\n    for _ in range(population_size):\n        x = random.randint(0, 50)\n        y = random.randint(0, 25)\n        while 2 * x + 4 * y > 100 or 4 * x + 5 * y > 80:\n            x = random.randint(0, 50)\n            y = random.randint(0, 25)\n        population.append((x, y))\n    return population\n\ndef fitness(solution):\n    x, y = solution\n    profit_a = (50 - 20) * x\n    profit_b = (70 - 30) * y\n    return profit_a + profit_b\n\ndef selection(population, num_parents):\n    fitness_values = [fitness(solution) for solution in population]\n    parents = sorted(population, key=lambda x: fitness(x), reverse=True)[:num_parents]\n    return parents\n\ndef crossover(parents, num_offspring):\n    offspring = []\n    for _ in range(num_offspring):\n        parent1 = random.choice(parents)\n        parent2 = random.choice(parents)\n        crossover_point = random.randint(1, len(parent1) - 1)\n        child = parent1[:crossover_point] + parent2[crossover_point:]\n        offspring.append(child)\n    return offspring\n\ndef mutation(offspring, mutation_rate):\n    mutated_offspring = []\n    for child in offspring:\n        if random.random() < mutation_rate:\n            index = random.randint(0, len(child) - 1)\n            new_value = random.randint(0, 50 if index == 0 else 25)\n            child = tuple(new_value if i == index else val for i, val in enumerate(child))\n        mutated_offspring.append(child)\n    return mutated_offspring\n\ndef genetic_algorithm(population_size, num_generations, num_parents, num_offspring, mutation_rate):\n    population = generate_initial_population(population_size)\n    for _ in range(num_generations):\n        parents = selection(population, num_parents)\n        offspring = crossover(parents, num_offspring)\n        mutated_offspring = mutation(offspring, mutation_rate)\n        population = parents + mutated_offspring\n    best_solution = max(population, key=lambda x: fitness(x))\n    return best_solution\n\n# Example usage:\npopulation_size = 100\nnum_generations = 100\nnum_parents = 20\nnum_offspring = 80\nmutation_rate = 0.1\n\nbest_solution = genetic_algorithm(population_size, num_generations, num_parents, num_offspring, mutation_rate)\nprint(\"Optimal number of units of Product A and Product B:\", best_solution)\n```\n\nThis implementation is a simple example and may not find the optimal solution in every run. You can experiment with different parameter values and improve the algorithm to increase its performance."
