    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of y(t), we first need to solve the given differential equation. The given differential equation is a homogeneous linear second-order differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation for this differential equation is:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = ±2i\n\nSince we have complex roots, the general solution for y(t) is given by:\n\ny(t) = A*cos(2t) + B*sin(2t)\n\nNow, we need to use the initial conditions to find the values of A and B.\n\n1) y(0) = 0:\n\n0 = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0)\n0 = A\nA = 0\n\n2) y'(0) = 1:\n\ny'(t) = -2A*sin(2t) + 2B*cos(2t)\n\n1 = -2A*sin(0) + 2B*cos(0)\n1 = 2B\nB = 1/2\n\nSo, the particular solution for y(t) is:\n\ny(t) = (1/2)*sin(2t)\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of y(t). The Fourier transform of a function y(t) is defined as:\n\nY(ω) = ∫[y(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nFor our function y(t) = (1/2)*sin(2t), we have:\n\nY(ω) = ∫[((1/2)*sin(2t)) * e^(-jωt)] dt (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let:\n\nu = (1/2)*sin(2t)\ndv = e^(-jωt) dt\n\nThen, we have:\n\ndu = cos(2t) dt\nv = (-1/jω) * e^(-jωt)\n\nNow, we can apply integration by parts:\n\nY(ω) = uv |(-∞ to ∞) - ∫[v * du]\n\nY(ω) = [(-1/2jω) * sin(2t) * e^(-jωt)] |(-∞ to ∞) - ∫[(-1/jω) * e^(-jωt) * cos(2t) dt]\n\nThe first term, [(-1/2jω) * sin(2t) * e^(-jωt)] |(-∞ to ∞), goes to zero as t goes to ±∞. So, we are left with:\n\nY(ω) = ∫[(1/jω) * e^(-jωt) * cos(2t) dt]\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts again. Let:\n\nu = cos(2t)\ndv = (1/jω) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nThen, we have:\n\ndu = -2*sin(2t) dt\nv = (-1/ω^2) * e^(-jωt)\n\nNow, we can apply integration by parts:\n\nY(ω) = uv |(-∞ to ∞) - ∫[v * du]\n\nY(ω) = [(-1/ω^2) * cos(2t) * e^(-jωt)] |(-∞ to ∞) - ∫[(-1/ω^2) * e^(-jωt) * (-2*sin(2t)) dt]\n\nThe first term, [(-1/ω^2) * cos(2t) * e^(-jωt)] |(-∞ to ∞), goes to zero as t goes to ±∞. So, we are left with:\n\nY(ω) = ∫[(2/ω^2) * e^(-jωt) * sin(2t) dt]\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the integral of the product of an even function and an odd function is zero. Since e^(-jωt) is an even function and sin(2t) is an odd function, their product is an odd function. Therefore, the integral is zero for all ω except ω = ±2. \n\nFor ω = ±2, we can use the Dirac delta function, δ(ω - 2) and δ(ω + 2), to represent the Fourier transform:\n\nY(ω) = (1/2) * [δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)]\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of y(t) = (1/2)*sin(2t) is:\n\nY(ω) = (1/2) * [δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)]"
