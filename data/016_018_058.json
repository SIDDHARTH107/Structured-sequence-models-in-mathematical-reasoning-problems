    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor dust, at each iteration, the line segment is divided into 3 equal parts and the middle one-third is removed, leaving 2 self-similar pieces (N = 2). The scaling factor is the length of each remaining piece, which is 1/3 (s = 1/3).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust is:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(1/3) â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust is approximately 0.6309."
