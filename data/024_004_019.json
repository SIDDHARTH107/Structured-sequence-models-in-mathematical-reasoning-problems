    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface by setting x = u and y = v. Then, the parameterization is given by:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 2uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = r_uu • n = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nM = r_uv • n = 0\nN = r_vv • n = -2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nHere, n is the unit normal vector to the surface, which can be found by taking the cross product of r_u and r_v and dividing by its magnitude:\n\nn = (r_u x r_v) / ||r_u x r_v|| = (-2u, -2v, 1) / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nNow, we can compute the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (E * N + G * L - 2 * F * M) / (2 * (E * G - F^2))\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1. Plugging these values into the expressions for E, F, G, L, N, and H, we get:\n\nE = 5\nF = 2\nG = 5\nL = -2 / sqrt(9) = -2 / 3\nN = -2 / sqrt(9) = -2 / 3\n\nH = (5 * (-2/3) + 5 * (-2/3) - 2 * 2 * 0) / (2 * (5 * 5 - 2^2)) = (-20/3) / (2 * 21) = -10 / 21\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2) is H = -10 / 21."
