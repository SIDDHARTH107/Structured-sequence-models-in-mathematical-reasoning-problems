    "message_2": "To find the point where the tangent line to the curve y = x^2 - 2x + 1 has a slope of 4, we first need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x. The derivative represents the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 - 2x + 1.\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\ndy/dx = 2x - 2\n\nNow, we want to find the point where the slope (dy/dx) is equal to 4:\n\n4 = 2x - 2\n\nNow, we'll solve for x:\n\n4 + 2 = 2x\n6 = 2x\nx = 3\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate, we can find the corresponding y-coordinate by plugging x back into the original function:\n\ny = (3)^2 - 2(3) + 1\ny = 9 - 6 + 1\ny = 4\n\nSo, the point where the tangent line to the curve y = x^2 - 2x + 1 has a slope of 4 is (3, 4)."
