    "message_2": "To find the slope-intercept form of the equation of the line passing through the points (-3, 4) and (2, -1), we first need to find the slope (m) of the line using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) = (-3, 4) and (x2, y2) = (2, -1).\n\nm = (-1 - 4) / (2 - (-3)) = (-5) / (5) = -1\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nPlugging in the slope and one of the points, let's use (-3, 4):\n\ny - 4 = -1(x - (-3))\n\ny - 4 = -1(x + 3)\n\nNow, we can convert this equation to the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n\ny = -1(x + 3) + 4\n\ny = -x - 3 + 4\n\ny = -x + 1\n\nSo, the slope-intercept form of the equation of the line passing through the points (-3, 4) and (2, -1) is:\n\ny = -x + 1"
