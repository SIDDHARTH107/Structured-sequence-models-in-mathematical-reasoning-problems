    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the wave, we need to determine the phase speed. The phase speed is the speed at which a particular phase of the wave (e.g., crest or trough) travels through space. The general form of a sinusoidal wave equation is:\n\ny(x, t) = A sin(kx - ωt)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, ω is the angular frequency, and (kx - ωt) is the phase.\n\nIn the given wave equation, y = 0.02sin(100πt - 5πx), we can identify the following:\n\nω = 100π (angular frequency)\nk = 5π (wave number)\n\nThe phase speed (v) of a wave can be calculated using the formula:\n\nv = ω / k\n\nSubstituting the values of ω and k, we get:\n\nv = (100π) / (5π)\n\nThe π terms cancel out:\n\nv = 100 / 5\n\nv = 20\n\nSo, the velocity of the wave is 20 units (the units depend on the units used for x and t in the problem)."
