    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are 5 self-similar pieces (the central square and the 4 corner squares), and the scaling factor is 3 (since each side of the square is divided into 3 equal parts).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal when the radius of each square is 1 can be calculated as:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal with a radius of 1 is approximately 1.465."
