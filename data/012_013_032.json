    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial for the given graph, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. Let P(G, k) denote the chromatic polynomial of graph G with k colors. We will use the edge {1, 2} for our deletion and contraction steps.\n\n1. Delete the edge {1, 2} from the graph, resulting in graph G'. The edges in G' are: {1,3}, {1,5}, {2,4}, {3,5}, {4,5}.\n2. Contract the edge {1, 2} in the graph, resulting in graph G''. This means we merge vertices 1 and 2 into a single vertex, say vertex 6, and remove any duplicate edges. The edges in G'' are: {6,3}, {6,5}, {6,4}, {3,5}, {4,5}.\n\nNow we have two simpler graphs, G' and G'', and we can find their chromatic polynomials.\n\nFor G', we have a graph with no triangles or cycles, which means it is a tree. The chromatic polynomial of a tree with n vertices is k(k-1)^(n-1). In this case, n = 5, so the chromatic polynomial of G' is P(G', k) = k(k-1)^4.\n\nFor G'', we have a graph with 4 vertices and a single cycle of length 4. The chromatic polynomial of a cycle of length 4 is k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + (k-1)(k-2)(k-3). In this case, the chromatic polynomial of G'' is P(G'', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + (k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\nNow we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm to find the chromatic polynomial of the original graph G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^4 - [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + (k-1)(k-2)(k-3)]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) - (k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nThis is the chromatic polynomial for the given graph."
