    "message_2": "To find the degree of the divisor of the rational function $f(x:y) = y/x^2$ on $C$, we first need to express $f$ in terms of the parameterization of $C$. \n\nRecall that $C$ is parameterized by $(x(t), y(t)) = (t^2 - 1, t^3 - t)$. Then, we can write $f$ as a function of $t$:\n\n$$f(t) = \\frac{y(t)}{x(t)^2} = \\frac{t^3 - t}{(t^2 - 1)^2}.$$\n\nNow, we need to find the zeros and poles of $f(t)$ and their multiplicities. \n\nZeros: The zeros of $f(t)$ are the values of $t$ for which $t^3 - t = 0$. This occurs when $t = 0, 1, -1$. The multiplicities of these zeros are given by the multiplicities of the corresponding factors in the numerator of $f(t)$. Since $t^3 - t = t(t^2 - 1)$, the multiplicities of the zeros are $1$ for $t = 0$, $1$ for $t = 1$, and $1$ for $t = -1$. \n\nPoles: The poles of $f(t)$ are the values of $t$ for which the denominator $(t^2 - 1)^2$ is zero. This occurs when $t = 1, -1$. The multiplicities of these poles are given by the multiplicities of the corresponding factors in the denominator of $f(t)$. Since $(t^2 - 1)^2 = (t - 1)^2(t + 1)^2$, the multiplicities of the poles are $2$ for $t = 1$ and $2$ for $t = -1$. \n\nNow, we can compute the degree of the divisor of $f$ on $C$ as the sum of the multiplicities of the zeros minus the sum of the multiplicities of the poles:\n\n$$\\text{degree} = (1 + 1 + 1) - (2 + 2) = 3 - 4 = -1.$$\n\nHowever, the degree of a divisor is always non-negative. In this case, the degree of the divisor of the rational function $f(x:y) = y/x^2$ on $C$ is actually $0$. This is because the zeros and poles of $f(t)$ cancel each other out when considering the curve $C$."
