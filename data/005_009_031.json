    "message_1": "A math student wants to evaluate the effectiveness of two different study methods. They have two groups of students, Group A and Group B. The test scores of these two groups are given below:\n\n**Group A:** 62, 75, 80, 68, 55, 72, 78, 64\n\n**Group B:** 66, 71, 58, 80, 69, 70, 84, 72, 75\n\nThe student wants to know whether there is a significant difference in the test scores between the two groups. Using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, can the math student determine if there is a significant difference between the test scores of Group A and Group B at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we first need to combine the two groups and rank the scores from lowest to highest. Here are the combined scores and their ranks:\n\n55(1), 58(2), 62(3), 64(4), 66(5), 68(6), 69(7), 70(8), 71(9), 72(10), 72(11), 75(12), 75(13), 78(14), 80(15), 80(16), 84(17)\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the ranks for each group:\n\nGroup A: 1 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 + 14 + 15 + 16 = 71\nGroup B: 2 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 13 + 17 = 82\n\nNext, we need to calculate the expected rank-sum for each group. The formula for the expected rank-sum is:\n\nE(R) = n1(n1 + n2 + 1) / 2\n\nwhere n1 is the number of observations in Group A and n2 is the number of observations in Group B.\n\nE(R) for Group A: 8(8 + 9 + 1) / 2 = 8(18) / 2 = 144 / 2 = 72\nE(R) for Group B: 9(8 + 9 + 1) / 2 = 9(18) / 2 = 162 / 2 = 81\n\nNow, we need to calculate the variance of the rank-sum for each group. The formula for the variance is:\n\nVar(R) = n1 * n2 * (n1 + n2 + 1) / 12\n\nVar(R) for both groups: 8 * 9 * (17) / 12 = 72 * 17 / 12 = 1224 / 12 = 102\n\nNow, we can calculate the z-score for the rank-sum test. The formula for the z-score is:\n\nz = (observed rank-sum - expected rank-sum) / sqrt(variance)\n\nz for Group A: (71 - 72) / sqrt(102) = -1 / sqrt(102) ≈ -0.099\nz for Group B: (82 - 81) / sqrt(102) = 1 / sqrt(102) ≈ 0.099\n\nNow, we need to compare the z-scores to the critical value for a two-tailed test at a significance level of 0.05. The critical value for a two-tailed test at a significance level of 0.05 is 1.96.\n\nSince the absolute values of both z-scores (-0.099 and 0.099) are less than the critical value of 1.96, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the math student cannot determine if there is a significant difference between the test scores of Group A and Group B at a significance level of 0.05 using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test."
