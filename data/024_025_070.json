    "message_2": "To find the second Chern class c2(X) of the complex manifold X, we can use the Chern classes' relation with the total Chern class. The total Chern class of a complex manifold X is given by:\n\nc(X) = 1 + c1(X) + c2(X) + ...\n\nNow, we are given the first Chern class c1(X) = 3h - 7f. To find c2(X), we can use the Chern-Weil theory, which states that the Chern classes can be expressed as polynomials in the curvature form of a connection on a complex vector bundle.\n\nHowever, without more information about the complex manifold X, its curvature form, or the vector bundle, it is not possible to explicitly compute c2(X). In general, c2(X) will be a linear combination of the basis elements of the second cohomology group H^2(X, Z), but the coefficients will depend on the specific geometry and topology of the manifold X."
