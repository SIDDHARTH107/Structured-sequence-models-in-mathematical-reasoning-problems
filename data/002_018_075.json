    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to find the diameter of the sphere, which is equal to the side length of the cube.\n\nThe volume of the cube is given as 125 cm³. To find the side length of the cube, we can use the formula for the volume of a cube:\n\nVolume = side_length³\n\n125 = side_length³\n\nTo find the side length, we take the cube root of the volume:\n\nside_length = ∛125 = 5 cm\n\nNow that we have the side length of the cube, we know that the diameter of the inscribed sphere is also 5 cm. The radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, so:\n\nradius = diameter / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5 cm\n\nNow we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(radius)³\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(2.5)³\n\nVolume ≈ (4/3)π(15.625)\n\nVolume ≈ 20.8333π\n\nVolume ≈ 65.45 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 65.45 cm³, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
