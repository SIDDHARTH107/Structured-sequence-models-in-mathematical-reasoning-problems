Alice's secret key is 7 while Bob's secret key is 11. Calculate the shared secret key that they both will use for encryption and decryption.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Alice's public key (A): A = g^a mod p\n2. Calculate Bob's public key (B): B = g^b mod p\n3. Calculate the shared secret key: K = A^b mod p = B^a mod p\n\nIn this problem, the prime number p is 23. We also need a primitive root modulo p, which is a number g such that for every integer a, where 1 ≤ a ≤ p-1, there exists an integer k such that g^k mod p = a. For p = 23, we can choose g = 5, which is a primitive root modulo 23.\n\nNow, let's calculate the public keys and the shared secret key:\n\n1. Alice's public key (A): A = g^a mod p = 5^7 mod 23 = 78125 mod 23 = 10\n2. Bob's public key (B): B = g^b mod p = 5^11 mod 23 = 48828125 mod 23 = 18\n3. Shared secret key (K): K = A^b mod p = B^a mod p = 10^11 mod 23 = 18^7 mod 23 = 3\n\nSo, the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for encryption and decryption is 3."
