    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^5 - 10x^3 + 3x^2 - 15x + 2 using the power rule, we will differentiate each term separately.\n\nThe power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\n1. The derivative of 4x^5: \n   (5)(4x^(5-1)) = 20x^4\n\n2. The derivative of -10x^3: \n   (3)(-10x^(3-1)) = -30x^2\n\n3. The derivative of 3x^2: \n   (2)(3x^(2-1)) = 6x\n\n4. The derivative of -15x: \n   (1)(-15x^(1-1)) = -15\n\n5. The derivative of the constant term 2 is 0, as the derivative of any constant is 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 20x^4 - 30x^2 + 6x - 15"
