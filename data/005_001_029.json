    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that the mean weight of a bag of chips is 256 grams with a standard deviation of 5 grams. To test this claim, a sample of 25 bags is taken and the mean weight is found to be 253 grams. Can we reject the manufacturer's claim at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample z-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean weight of the bags is 256 grams, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean weight is not 256 grams.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the z-score for the sample mean. The formula for the z-score is:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean (253 grams), μ is the claimed mean (256 grams), σ is the standard deviation (5 grams), and n is the sample size (25 bags).\n\nz = (253 - 256) / (5 / √25)\nz = (-3) / (5 / 5)\nz = -3 / 1\nz = -3\n\nNow, we need to find the critical z-value for a two-tailed test at a significance level of 0.05. We can look this up in a z-table or use a calculator:\n\nThe critical z-value for a two-tailed test at a significance level of 0.05 is approximately ±1.96.\n\nSince the calculated z-score (-3) is less than the critical z-value (-1.96), we can reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level. This means that there is enough evidence to suggest that the true mean weight of the bags is not 256 grams."
