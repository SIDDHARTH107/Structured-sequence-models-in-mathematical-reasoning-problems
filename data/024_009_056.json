    "message_2": "The scalar curvature of a 2-dimensional sphere (surface of a sphere) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nScalar curvature (K) = 2/R^2\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the radius (R) is given as 3. So, we can calculate the scalar curvature as follows:\n\nK = 2/(3^2) = 2/9\n\nTherefore, the scalar curvature of the 2-dimensional sphere with radius 3 is 2/9."
