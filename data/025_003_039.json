    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line L in CP^2 passing through the two points [1:i:0] and [0:1:1], we can use the property of homogenization. Let the line L be represented by the equation ax + by + cz = 0, where a, b, and c are complex coefficients.\n\nNow, we plug in the coordinates of the two points into the equation of the line L:\n\n1. For point [1:i:0], we have:\n   a(1) + b(i) + c(0) = 0\n   a + bi = 0\n\n2. For point [0:1:1], we have:\n   a(0) + b(1) + c(1) = 0\n   b + c = 0\n\nFrom equation (1), we have a = -bi. Now, we substitute this into equation (2):\n\n-bi + c = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for c in terms of b:\n\nc = bi\n\nThe equation of the line L in CP^2 passing through the two points [1:i:0] and [0:1:1] is given by:\n\nx - iy + iz = 0"
