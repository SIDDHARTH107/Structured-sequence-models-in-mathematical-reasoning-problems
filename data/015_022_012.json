    "message_1": "What is the value of Mackey-Glass equation at time t = 100 with the following initial conditions: x(0) = 1.2, y(0) = 0.9, beta = 0.2, gamma = 0.1, n = 10, tau = 23?",
    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a nonlinear delay differential equation given by:\n\ndx(t)/dt = beta * x(t-tau) / (1 + x(t-tau)^n) - gamma * x(t)\n\nTo find the value of the Mackey-Glass equation at time t = 100 with the given initial conditions, we need to solve the equation numerically. This is because the equation involves a time delay (tau) and cannot be solved analytically.\n\nThere are several numerical methods to solve delay differential equations, such as the Euler method, Runge-Kutta method, or more advanced methods specifically designed for delay differential equations like DDE23 in MATLAB.\n\nHowever, providing a specific numerical solution here is beyond the scope of this platform. I recommend using a numerical solver in a programming language or software like MATLAB, Python, or Mathematica to find the value of the Mackey-Glass equation at t = 100 with the given initial conditions."
