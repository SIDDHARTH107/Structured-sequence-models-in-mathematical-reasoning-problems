    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6, we need to find the values of x when f(x) = 0.\n\n0 = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6\n\nWe can try to factor the polynomial to find the roots. Since the polynomial has a degree of 3, we can expect up to 3 roots.\n\nWe can use the Rational Root Theorem to test for possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (6) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6.\n\nLet's test these possible roots:\n\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 11(1) - 6 = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 ≠ 0\nf(-1) = (-1)^3 - 6(-1)^2 + 11(-1) - 6 ≠ 0\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 11(2) - 6 = 8 - 24 + 22 - 6 = 0\nf(-2) = (-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 + 11(-2) - 6 ≠ 0\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 11(3) - 6 = 27 - 54 + 33 - 6 = 0\nf(-3) = (-3)^3 - 6(-3)^2 + 11(-3) - 6 ≠ 0\nf(6) = (6)^3 - 6(6)^2 + 11(6) - 6 ≠ 0\nf(-6) = (-6)^3 - 6(-6)^2 + 11(-6) - 6 ≠ 0\n\nWe found two rational roots: x = 2 and x = 3. Since the polynomial has a degree of 3, we can factor it as:\n\nf(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - r)\n\nwhere r is the remaining root. We can use synthetic division or polynomial long division to find the remaining factor:\n\nDividing the polynomial by (x - 2)(x - 3) = x^2 - 5x + 6, we get:\n\nx^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 / (x^2 - 5x + 6) = x - 1\n\nSo, the polynomial can be factored as:\n\nf(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 1)\n\nNow we can see that the x-intercepts are x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3."
