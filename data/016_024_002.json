    "message_2": "The Sierpinski Carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by repeatedly removing the central square from each remaining square in the pattern. In each stage, the number of squares removed is a power of 8 (since there are 8 smaller squares surrounding the central square that is removed).\n\nIn the first stage, we have a base of 27 squares (3x3). We remove the central square, leaving 8 squares.\n\nIn the second stage, we remove the central square from each of the 8 remaining squares, leaving 8 * 8 = 64 squares.\n\nIn the third stage, we remove the central square from each of the 64 remaining squares, leaving 8 * 64 = 512 squares.\n\nIn the fourth stage, we remove the central square from each of the 512 remaining squares, leaving 8 * 512 = 4096 squares.\n\nIn the fifth stage, we remove the central square from each of the 4096 remaining squares, leaving 8 * 4096 = 32,768 squares.\n\nSo, in the fifth stage of the Sierpinski Carpet with a base divided into 27 equal squares, there are 32,768 squares."
