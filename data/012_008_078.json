    "message_2": "To determine if a graph G is planar, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nWe are given that G has 10 vertices (v = 10) and 15 edges (e = 15). We need to find the maximum number of faces (f) that G can have to check if it satisfies Euler's formula.\n\nFor a planar graph, the maximum number of edges (e) can be determined using the formula:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nSince 15 is less than or equal to 24, it is possible that G is planar. Now, we need to check if it satisfies Euler's formula:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n10 - 15 + f = 2\nf = 7\n\nSince we found a value for f that satisfies Euler's formula, we can conclude that the graph G is planar."
