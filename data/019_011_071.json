    "message_2": "Given p = 1 and q = 0, let's first find the value of (p ∧ q).\n\nThe ∧ operator represents \"and\" in logic, so (p ∧ q) is true only if both p and q are true. Since p is true (1) and q is false (0), (p ∧ q) is false (0).\n\nNow, we have to find the value of (0 → 1) in Relevance Logic.\n\nThe → operator in Relevance Logic is defined as false only when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. In this case, the antecedent (0) is false and the consequent (1) is true. Therefore, the implication (0 → 1) is true (1).\n\nSo, the value of (p ∧ q) → p in Relevance Logic is 1 (true)."
