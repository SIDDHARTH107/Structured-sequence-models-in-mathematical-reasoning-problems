    "message_2": "Let's assume that after removing the outliers, there are n numbers left in the dataset. Since the mean of the remaining dataset is 18, we can write the equation:\n\nSum of remaining dataset = 18n\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the entire dataset (including the outliers). Since the median of the remaining dataset is 15, we know that the middle value(s) of the dataset is 15. In a dataset of 10 numbers, the middle values would be the 5th and 6th numbers. We can assume that the dataset is ordered from least to greatest.\n\nLet x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, and x10 be the numbers in the dataset. Since the outliers were removed, we can assume that x1 and x10 are the outliers. Therefore, the dataset without the outliers would be:\n\nx2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9\n\nSince the median of the remaining dataset is 15, we know that the average of x5 and x6 is 15:\n\n(x5 + x6) / 2 = 15\n\nx5 + x6 = 30\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the entire dataset (including the outliers):\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + x7 + x8 + x9 + x10\n\nSince we know that x5 + x6 = 30, we can substitute that into the equation:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + 30 + x7 + x8 + x9 + x10\n\nNow, let's subtract the sum of the remaining dataset (18n) from the sum of the entire dataset:\n\n(x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + 30 + x7 + x8 + x9 + x10) - 18n = x1 + x10\n\nSince x1 and x10 are the outliers, this equation represents the sum of the outliers. We don't have enough information to find the exact values of x1 and x10, but we can find the sum of the outliers in terms of n:\n\nx1 + x10 = (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + 30 + x7 + x8 + x9 + x10) - 18n\n\nThe sum of the outliers depends on the value of n (the number of remaining data points after removing the outliers)."
