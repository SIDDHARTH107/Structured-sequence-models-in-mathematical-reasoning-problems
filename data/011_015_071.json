    "message_2": "In order to guarantee that either 3 of them all know each other, or 3 of them all don't know each other, at least 4 people need to be present. This can be explained using the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nLet's consider a single person in the group. This person can either know or not know each of the other 5 people in the group. If this person knows 2 other people, then either those 2 people know each other (forming a group of 3 who all know each other) or they don't know each other (forming a group of 3 who all don't know each other).\n\nIf this person doesn't know 2 other people, then either those 2 people know each other (forming a group of 3 who all don't know each other) or they don't know each other (forming a group of 3 who all know each other).\n\nIn either case, having at least 4 people present guarantees that there will be a group of 3 who all know each other or a group of 3 who all don't know each other."
