    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system, we need to analyze the poles of the transfer function G(s). The poles are the values of s that make the denominator of the transfer function equal to zero. In this case, we need to find the roots of the polynomial s^3 + 3s^2 + 2s + 1.\n\ns^3 + 3s^2 + 2s + 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion to determine the stability of the system. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion states that a system is stable if all the elements in the first column of the Routh array are positive.\n\nConstruct the Routh array:\n\n| s^3 |  1  |  2  |\n| s^2 |  3  |  1  |\n| s^1 |  2 - (3/1) |  0  |\n| s^0 |  1  |      |\n\nThe Routh array is:\n\n| s^3 |  1  |  2  |\n| s^2 |  3  |  1  |\n| s^1 | -1  |  0  |\n| s^0 |  1  |      |\n\nSince there is a change in sign in the first column of the Routh array, the system is unstable according to the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion."
