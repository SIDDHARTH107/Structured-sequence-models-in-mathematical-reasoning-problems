    "message_1": "Suppose that a financial derivative has a strike price of $100, and its underlying stock has a constant volatility of 25\\% per year. The stock pays no dividends and has a current price of $120. The risk-free interest rate is 4\\% per year. Using the Black-Scholes equation, what is the theoretical value of this financial derivative?",
    "message_2": "To find the theoretical value of this financial derivative using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to determine if it's a call option or a put option. Since it's not specified, I'll provide the solution for both.\n\nThe Black-Scholes equation for a call option is given by:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nAnd for a put option:\n\nP = X * e^(-rT) * N(-d2) - S * N(-d1)\n\nWhere:\nC = Call option price\nP = Put option price\nS = Current stock price ($120)\nX = Strike price ($100)\nr = Risk-free interest rate (0.04)\nT = Time to expiration (not given, assuming 1 year)\nN(x) = Cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = Base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nσ = Volatility (0.25)\n\nFirst, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(120/100) + (0.04 + (0.25^2)/2) * 1) / (0.25 * sqrt(1))\nd1 ≈ 0.9722\n\nd2 = d1 - 0.25 * sqrt(1)\nd2 ≈ 0.7222\n\nNow, we'll calculate the call option price (C):\n\nC = 120 * N(0.9722) - 100 * e^(-0.04 * 1) * N(0.7222)\nC ≈ 120 * 0.8351 - 100 * 0.9608 * 0.7649\nC ≈ 100.21\n\nAnd the put option price (P):\n\nP = 100 * e^(-0.04 * 1) * N(-0.7222) - 120 * N(-0.9722)\nP ≈ 100 * 0.9608 * 0.2351 - 120 * 0.1649\nP ≈ 4.77\n\nSo, the theoretical value of this financial derivative is approximately $100.21 for the call option and $4.77 for the put option."
