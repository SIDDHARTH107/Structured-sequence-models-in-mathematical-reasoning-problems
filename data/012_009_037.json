    "message_2": "A degree sequence is a list of the degrees of the vertices in a graph, sorted in non-increasing order. In a graph, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it. Since the graph has six vertices and five edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices should be equal to twice the number of edges (by the Handshaking Lemma).\n\n2 * 5 = 10\n\nNow, we need to find a degree sequence that sums up to 10. There are multiple possible degree sequences for this graph, as long as the sum of the degrees is 10 and the sequence follows the rules of graph theory. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. (3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1) - In this case, one vertex has a degree of 3, two vertices have a degree of 2, and the remaining three vertices have a degree of 1.\n2. (4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1) - In this case, one vertex has a degree of 4, one vertex has a degree of 2, and the remaining four vertices have a degree of 1.\n\nThese are just two examples, and there could be other valid degree sequences for a graph with six vertices and five edges."
