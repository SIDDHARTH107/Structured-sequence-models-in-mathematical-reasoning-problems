Antiderivative of 3x^2:\n   Apply the power rule: (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3\n\n2. Antiderivative of -2x:\n   Apply the power rule: (-2x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (-2x^2)/2 = -x^2\n\n3. Antiderivative of 1:\n   Apply the power rule: (1x^(0+1))/(0+1) = (1x^1)/1 = x\n\nNow, combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 - x^2 + x + C"
