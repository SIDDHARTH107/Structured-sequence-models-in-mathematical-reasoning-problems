    "message_2": "To find the magnitude response of the system, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the impulse response h(t). The impulse response is given by:\n\nh(t) = e^(-t)u(t) - 3e^(-2t)u(t)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of h(t), we get:\n\nH(ω) = ∫[e^(-t)u(t) - 3e^(-2t)u(t)] * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nSince u(t) is the unit step function, it is equal to 1 for t ≥ 0 and 0 for t < 0. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nH(ω) = ∫[e^(-t) - 3e^(-2t)] * e^(-jωt) dt, where the integral is from 0 to ∞.\n\nNow, we can solve the integral:\n\nH(ω) = ∫[e^(-t - jωt) - 3e^(-2t - jωt)] dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nH(ω) = [-1/(1 + jω) * e^(-t - jωt) + 3/(2 + jω) * e^(-2t - jωt)] from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limits:\n\nH(ω) = [-1/(1 + jω) * e^(-∞ - jω∞) + 3/(2 + jω) * e^(-2∞ - jω∞)] - [-1/(1 + jω) * e^(0) + 3/(2 + jω) * e^(0)]\n\nH(ω) = [0 + 0] - [-1/(1 + jω) + 3/(2 + jω)]\n\nH(ω) = 1/(1 + jω) - 3/(2 + jω)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude response of the system by taking the magnitude of H(ω):\n\n|H(ω)| = |1/(1 + jω) - 3/(2 + jω)|\n\nTo determine if the system is stable, we need to check if the impulse response h(t) is absolutely integrable:\n\n∫|h(t)| dt = ∫|e^(-t)u(t) - 3e^(-2t)u(t)| dt\n\nSince both e^(-t)u(t) and e^(-2t)u(t) are absolutely integrable, their difference is also absolutely integrable. Therefore, the system is stable.\n\nTo plot the magnitude response, you can use software like MATLAB or Python's matplotlib library to plot |H(ω)| as a function of ω."
