    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal created by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The total length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial Length) * (2^n)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after 10 iterations. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^10)\n\nLength = 1 * 1024\n\nLength = 1024\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve after 10 iterations is 1024."
