    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of (A × B) with {5}, denoted as (A × B) ∪ {5}.\n\n(A × B) ∪ {5} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 5}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B × A. This is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A.\n\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of {5} with (B × A), denoted as {5} ∪ (B × A).\n\n{5} ∪ (B × A) = {5, (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare (A × B) ∪ {5} and {5} ∪ (B × A):\n\n(A × B) ∪ {5} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), 5}\n{5} ∪ (B × A) = {5, (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) ∪ {5} and {5} ∪ (B × A) are not equal, since the ordered pairs in each set are different. This demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union."
