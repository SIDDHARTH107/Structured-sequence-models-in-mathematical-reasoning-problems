    "message_1": "What is the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 12 meters?",
    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π * diameter\n\nGiven the diameter is 12 meters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π * 12\n\nUsing the approximate value of π as 3.14:\n\nC = 3.14 * 12\nC ≈ 37.68 meters\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle is approximately 37.68 meters."
