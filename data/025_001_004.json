We can start by substituting y^2 = 5 - x^2 from the first equation into the second equation, giving us:\n\n2x^2 - 2(5-x^2) + 10 = 0\n4x^2 - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get x = ±√(10/4) = ±√(5/2). Substituting these values back into either equation gives us the corresponding y-values:\n\nFor x = +√(5/2), y^2 = 5 - (√(5/2))^2 = 5/2, so y = ±(√5/2).\nFor x = -√(5/2), y^2 = 5 - (-√(5/2))^2 = 5/2, so y = ±(√5/2).\n\nTherefore, there are four intersection points: (√(5/2), √5/2), (-√(5/2), √5/2), (√(5/2), -√5/2), and (-√(5/2), -√5/2).",
