    "message_1": "A Ferris wheel has a diameter of 40 meters and rotates at a rate of 2 revolutions per minute. A person hops onto the ride and sits in a passenger car located 8 meters above the ground. \n\nWrite a trigonometric equation that models the height of the person above the ground as a function of time (in seconds) on the ride, assuming the ride starts with the passenger car at its highest position, then provide the maximum and minimum height of the person above the ground during one full revolution of the Ferris wheel.",
    "message_2": "Since the diameter of the Ferris wheel is 40 meters, the radius is 20 meters. The ride starts with the passenger car at its highest position, so we can model the height of the person above the ground using a cosine function. The Ferris wheel rotates at a rate of 2 revolutions per minute, which is equivalent to 4π radians per minute or 4π/60 radians per second.\n\nLet h(t) represent the height of the person above the ground at time t (in seconds). We can write the trigonometric equation as:\n\nh(t) = 20cos(4πt/60) + 20 + 8\n\nNow, let's find the maximum and minimum height of the person above the ground during one full revolution of the Ferris wheel.\n\nThe maximum height occurs when the cosine function is at its maximum value of 1:\n\nh_max = 20(1) + 20 + 8 = 48 meters\n\nThe minimum height occurs when the cosine function is at its minimum value of -1:\n\nh_min = 20(-1) + 20 + 8 = 8 meters\n\nSo, the maximum height of the person above the ground during one full revolution is 48 meters, and the minimum height is 8 meters."
