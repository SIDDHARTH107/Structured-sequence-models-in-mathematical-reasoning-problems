    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n[ 1  2  3 |  0 ]\n[ 2 -1 -1 |  0 ]\n[ 3  1 -2 |  0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix into row-echelon form.\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2  3 |  0 ]\n[ 0 -5 -7 |  0 ]\n[ 3  1 -2 |  0 ]\n```\n\n2. Subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2  3 |  0 ]\n[ 0 -5 -7 |  0 ]\n[ 0 -5 -11 |  0 ]\n```\n\n3. Divide the second row by -5:\n\n```\n[ 1  2   3 |  0 ]\n[ 0  1 1.4 |  0 ]\n[ 0 -5 -11 |  0 ]\n```\n\n4. Add 5 times the second row to the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2   3 |  0 ]\n[ 0  1 1.4 |  0 ]\n[ 0  0  -2 |  0 ]\n```\n\n5. Divide the third row by -2:\n\n```\n[ 1  2   3 |  0 ]\n[ 0  1 1.4 |  0 ]\n[ 0  0   1 |  0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the solutions for x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 0. \n\nFrom the second row, we have y + 1.4z = 0, which simplifies to y = 0 since z = 0.\n\nFrom the first row, we have x + 2y + 3z = 0, which simplifies to x = 0 since y = 0 and z = 0.\n\nSo, the solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
