    "message_2": "To prove that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 2, we will use Liouville's theorem, which states that every bounded entire function is constant. \n\nFirst, let's consider the function g(z) = f(z) - az^2, where a is a complex constant. We want to show that g(z) is a constant function, which would imply that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 2.\n\nNow, let's estimate the modulus of g(z):\n\n|g(z)| = |f(z) - az^2| ≤ |f(z)| + |az^2| ≤ 2|z|^2 + 3 + |a||z|^2.\n\nWe want to choose a constant a such that g(z) is a bounded entire function. To do this, we can choose a = 2. Then,\n\n|g(z)| ≤ 2|z|^2 + 3 + 2|z|^2 = 4|z|^2 + 3.\n\nNow, consider the function h(z) = g(z)/z^2. Since g(z) is entire, h(z) is also entire except possibly at z = 0. However, we can define h(0) = 2, making h(z) entire as well. Now, let's estimate the modulus of h(z):\n\n|h(z)| = |g(z)/z^2| ≤ (4|z|^2 + 3)/|z|^2 = 4 + 3/|z|^2.\n\nAs |z| → ∞, the term 3/|z|^2 goes to 0, so |h(z)| is bounded. By Liouville's theorem, h(z) must be a constant function. Let h(z) = c for all z ∈ ℂ.\n\nNow, we have g(z) = c * z^2, and f(z) = g(z) + 2z^2 = (c + 2)z^2. Thus, f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 2. The constant c can be any complex number, so all such polynomials are given by f(z) = (c + 2)z^2 for c ∈ ℂ."
