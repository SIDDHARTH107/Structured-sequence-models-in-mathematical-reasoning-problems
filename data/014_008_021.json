    "message_2": "To determine the number of possible keys for a 128-bit block cipher, we need to know the key size, not the number of rounds. The key size is the number of bits used to represent the key, and each bit can have two possible values: 0 or 1.\n\nAssuming the key size is also 128 bits (as it is common for the key size to match the block size), the number of possible keys would be 2^128, which is approximately 3.4 x 10^38."
