    "message_1": "Suppose Bob chooses a prime number $p = 17$ and a primitive root $a = 3$ modulo $p$. His public key is $(p,a,y) = (17,3,6)$, where $y$ is his secret key. Alice sends an encrypted message to Bob with the ElGamal encryption scheme by choosing a random number $k = 4$ and encrypts the message  $m = 9$ as follows: $(c_1,c_2) = (a^k\\mod p, my^k\\mod p)$. Compute the ciphertext $(c_1,c_2)$ sent by Alice and decrypt it to recover the original message $m$.",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute the ciphertext $(c_1, c_2)$ sent by Alice:\n\n$c_1 = a^k \\mod p = 3^4 \\mod 17 = 81 \\mod 17 = 13$\n\n$c_2 = my^k \\mod p = 9 \\cdot 6^4 \\mod 17 = 9 \\cdot 1296 \\mod 17 = 9 \\cdot 3 \\mod 17 = 27 \\mod 17 = 10$\n\nSo the ciphertext sent by Alice is $(c_1, c_2) = (13, 10)$.\n\nNow, let's decrypt the ciphertext to recover the original message $m$:\n\nTo decrypt the ciphertext, we need to compute $m' = c_2(c_1^y)^{-1} \\mod p$.\n\nFirst, let's compute $c_1^y \\mod p = 13^6 \\mod 17 = 4826809 \\mod 17 = 15$.\n\nNow we need to find the modular inverse of 15 modulo 17. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the inverse:\n\n$15^{-1} \\mod 17 = 2$\n\nNow we can compute the decrypted message $m'$:\n\n$m' = c_2(c_1^y)^{-1} \\mod p = 10 \\cdot 2 \\mod 17 = 20 \\mod 17 = 3$\n\nHowever, the decrypted message $m'$ is not equal to the original message $m$. There seems to be an error in the problem statement or the given values. Please double-check the values provided for the ElGamal encryption scheme."
