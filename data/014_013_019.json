    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext using the Hill cipher, we need to multiply the key matrix by the plaintext message in pairs and then apply modulo 26 arithmetic.\n\nThe plaintext message \"MATH\" is represented numerically as (12, 0, 19, 7). We will divide this into pairs: (12, 0) and (19, 7).\n\nThe key matrix is [[3, 5], [7, 2]].\n\nNow, we will multiply the key matrix by the plaintext pairs:\n\nFor the first pair (12, 0):\n[[3, 5], [7, 2]] * [12, 0] = [3*12 + 5*0, 7*12 + 2*0] = [36, 84]\n\nApplying modulo 26 arithmetic:\n[36 % 26, 84 % 26] = [10, 6]\n\nFor the second pair (19, 7):\n[[3, 5], [7, 2]] * [19, 7] = [3*19 + 5*7, 7*19 + 2*7] = [76, 153]\n\nApplying modulo 26 arithmetic:\n[76 % 26, 153 % 26] = [24, 1]\n\nNow, we have the numerical representation of the ciphertext: (10, 6, 24, 1).\n\nTo convert this back to letters, we use the following mapping: 0=A, 1=B, 2=C, ..., 25=Z.\n\nSo, the corresponding ciphertext is \"KGYB\"."
