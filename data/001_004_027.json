    "message_2": "To factor the given polynomial expression, 12x^2 - 21x + 8, we can use the factoring by grouping method.\n\nStep 1: Multiply the leading coefficient and the constant term.\n12 * 8 = 96\n\nStep 2: Find two numbers that multiply to 96 and add up to the middle coefficient (-21).\nThese two numbers are -16 and -6, since -16 * -6 = 96 and -16 + (-6) = -21.\n\nStep 3: Rewrite the middle term using the two numbers found in step 2.\n12x^2 - 21x + 8 = 12x^2 - 16x - 6x + 8\n\nStep 4: Group the terms in pairs and factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from each pair.\n12x^2 - 16x - 6x + 8 = 4x(3x - 4) - 2(3x - 4)\n\nStep 5: Factor out the common binomial factor.\n4x(3x - 4) - 2(3x - 4) = (4x - 2)(3x - 4)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial expression 12x^2 - 21x + 8 is (4x - 2)(3x - 4)."
