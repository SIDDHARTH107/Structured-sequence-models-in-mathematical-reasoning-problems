    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to compute the Jacobian matrix, which consists of the partial derivatives of the given functions with respect to x and y.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 4 and g(x, y) = x^2 - y. Then, the Jacobian matrix J is:\n\nJ = | ∂f/∂x  ∂f/∂y |\n    | ∂g/∂x  ∂g/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x\n∂f/∂y = 2y\n∂g/∂x = 2x\n∂g/∂y = -1\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ = | 2x  2y |\n    | 2x  -1 |\n\nNow, we apply Newton's method using the initial guess (x0, y0) = (-1, 1). The iteration formula for Newton's method for systems of equations is:\n\n(x, y) = (x0, y0) - J^(-1) * F(x0, y0)\n\nwhere F(x0, y0) is the vector of the functions evaluated at (x0, y0):\n\nF(x0, y0) = | f(-1, 1) |\n            | g(-1, 1) |\n\nEvaluating the functions at the initial guess, we get:\n\nF(x0, y0) = | (-1)^2 + (1)^2 - 4 | = | -2 |\n            | (-1)^2 - 1         |   |  0 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at (x0, y0):\n\nJ^(-1) = | 2(-1)  2(1) |^(-1) = | -2  2 |^(-1)\n         | 2(-1)  -1   |        | -2 -1 |\n\nTo find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we can use the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of A and adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nThe determinant of J is:\n\ndet(J) = (-2)(-1) - (2)(-2) = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nThe adjugate of J is:\n\nadj(J) = | -1 -2 |\n         | -2  2 |\n\nSo, the inverse of J is:\n\nJ^(-1) = (1/6) * | -1 -2 |\n                | -2  2 |\n\nNow, we can compute the next approximation (x1, y1) using the iteration formula:\n\n(x1, y1) = (-1, 1) - J^(-1) * F(-1, 1)\n\n(x1, y1) = (-1, 1) - (1/6) * | -1 -2 | * | -2 |\n                             | -2  2 |   |  0 |\n\nMultiplying the matrices, we get:\n\nJ^(-1) * F(-1, 1) = (1/6) * | 4 |\n                           | 4 |\n\nSubtracting this from the initial guess, we get:\n\n(x1, y1) = (-1, 1) - (2/3, 2/3) = (-1/3, 1/3)\n\nRounding to 4 decimal places, we have:\n\n(x1, y1) = (-0.3333, 0.3333)\n\nThis is the first iteration of Newton's method. You can continue iterating using the same process to get more accurate approximations of the solution."
