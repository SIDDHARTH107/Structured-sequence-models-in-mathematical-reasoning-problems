    "message_2": "The number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48 can be determined using the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of the order: 48 = 2^4 * 3^1.\n2. Calculate the number of abelian groups using the formula: p(n) = p(n1) * p(n2) * ... * p(nk), where p(n) is the partition function and n1, n2, ... nk are the exponents of the prime factors in the prime factorization. In this case, p(4) = 5 and p(1) = 1, so there are 5 * 1 = 5 abelian groups.\n3. Use the formula for the number of non-abelian groups: N(G) = N(T) - N(A), where N(G) is the number of non-isomorphic groups, N(T) is the total number of groups, and N(A) is the number of abelian groups. To find N(T), we can use the formula: N(T) = (n1 + 1) * (n2 + 1) * ... * (nk + 1), where n1, n2, ... nk are the exponents of the prime factors in the prime factorization. In this case, N(T) = (4 + 1) * (1 + 1) = 5 * 2 = 10.\n4. Finally, calculate the number of non-abelian groups: N(G) = N(T) - N(A) = 10 - 5 = 5.\n\nThere are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
