    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a certain medical condition occurring is 0.25. If a doctor sees 20 patients with this condition, what is the probability that at least 5 of them will be cured with a particular treatment?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to know the probability of the treatment being successful in curing the medical condition. Let's assume the probability of a patient being cured with the treatment is p. \n\nWe are asked to find the probability that at least 5 patients are cured. This means we need to find the probability of 5, 6, 7, ..., 20 patients being cured. We can use the binomial probability formula to calculate this:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of patients (20), k is the number of successful treatments, and p is the probability of a successful treatment.\n\nTo find the probability of at least 5 patients being cured, we need to sum the probabilities for k = 5, 6, 7, ..., 20:\n\nP(X >= 5) = Î£ P(X = k) for k = 5 to 20\n\nHowever, without knowing the probability of a successful treatment (p), we cannot calculate the exact probability. Please provide the probability of a successful treatment to proceed with the calculation."
