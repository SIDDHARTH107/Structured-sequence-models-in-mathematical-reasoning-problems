    "message_2": "To find the period of the given function f(x) = 4cos(3x) - 2sin(2x), we first need to find the periods of the individual trigonometric functions.\n\nFor the cosine function, the general formula for the period is:\n\nPeriod of cos(kx) = 2π / |k|\n\nIn our case, k = 3 for the cosine function, so its period is:\n\nPeriod of 4cos(3x) = 2π / |3| = 2π / 3\n\nFor the sine function, the general formula for the period is the same:\n\nPeriod of sin(kx) = 2π / |k|\n\nIn our case, k = 2 for the sine function, so its period is:\n\nPeriod of -2sin(2x) = 2π / |2| = 2π / 2 = π\n\nNow, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two periods to find the period of the entire function.\n\nThe LCM of 2π/3 and π is 2π. Therefore, the period of the function f(x) = 4cos(3x) - 2sin(2x) over the interval [0, 2π] is 2π."
