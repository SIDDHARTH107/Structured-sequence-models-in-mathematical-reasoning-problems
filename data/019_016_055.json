    "message_2": "Intersection (A ∩ B): The intersection of sets A and B is the set of elements that are common to both A and B. In this case, A ∩ B = {3, 5}.\n\nUnion (A ∪ B): The union of sets A and B is the set of elements that are in either A or B or in both. In this case, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.\n\nComplement (A' and B'): The complement of a set is the set of elements that are not in the given set. Assuming the universal set U contains all the elements from both A and B, U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. Then, the complement of set A (A') is the set of elements in U but not in A, and the complement of set B (B') is the set of elements in U but not in B. In this case, A' = {2, 4, 6} and B' = {1, 7}."
