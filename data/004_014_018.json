    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone using integration, we'll first consider the cone as being made up of an infinite number of infinitesimally thin circular discs stacked on top of each other. Each disc has a radius r(x) and a thickness dx, where x is the distance from the vertex of the cone.\n\nThe volume of each disc can be represented as dV = π[r(x)]^2 dx. We'll integrate this expression with respect to x to find the total volume of the cone.\n\nFirst, we need to find the equation for the radius r(x) as a function of x. Since the height and radius of the cone are proportional, we can use similar triangles to find the relationship between r(x) and x:\n\nr(x) / x = 4 / 12\nr(x) = (1/3)x\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for r(x) into the volume equation:\n\ndV = π[(1/3)x]^2 dx\ndV = π(1/9)x^2 dx\n\nNow we'll integrate this expression with respect to x, over the interval [0, 12]:\n\nV = ∫[0, 12] π(1/9)x^2 dx\n\nTo integrate, we'll use the power rule:\n\nV = π(1/9) ∫[0, 12] x^2 dx\nV = π(1/9) [(1/3)x^3] |[0, 12]\nV = (π/27) [(1/3)(12^3) - (1/3)(0^3)]\nV = (π/27) (1/3)(1728)\nV = (π/27) (576)\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is:\n\nV = 576π/27 cubic centimeters."
