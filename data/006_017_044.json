    "message_1": "A certain type of traffic accident occurs on a certain road with a probability of 0.05 per hour. What is the probability that this type of accident will occur exactly 3 times in a 24-hour period on this road?",
    "message_2": "We can model this situation using the Poisson distribution, which is used to describe the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. The probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (in this case, traffic accidents), k is the desired number of events (3 accidents), λ is the average rate of events per interval (0.05 accidents per hour * 24 hours = 1.2 accidents per day), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 3) = (1.2^3 * e^(-1.2)) / 3!\n\nP(X = 3) = (1.728 * e^(-1.2)) / 6\n\nP(X = 3) ≈ (1.728 * 0.301194) / 6\n\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.52044 / 6\n\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.08674\n\nSo, the probability that this type of accident will occur exactly 3 times in a 24-hour period on this road is approximately 0.08674 or 8.674%."
