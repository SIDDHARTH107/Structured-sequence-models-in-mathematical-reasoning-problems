Prove that the closure of the union of A and B is contained in the union of the closures of A and B. \n\nShow that this is not necessarily an equality by giving an example where the closure of the union of A and B is strictly contained in the union of the closures of A and B.",
    "message_2": "To prove that the closure of the union of A and B is contained in the union of the closures of A and B, we will show that every point in the closure of the union of A and B is also in the union of the closures of A and B.\n\nLet x be a point in the closure of the union of A and B, denoted as cl(A ∪ B). By definition of closure, every open neighborhood of x intersects A ∪ B. We will show that x is in the closure of A, cl(A), or the closure of B, cl(B).\n\nCase 1: There exists an open neighborhood U of x such that U intersects A but not B. Since U intersects A, x is a limit point of A, and therefore x is in cl(A). Thus, x is in cl(A) ∪ cl(B).\n\nCase 2: There exists an open neighborhood V of x such that V intersects B but not A. Similar to Case 1, x is a limit point of B, and therefore x is in cl(B). Thus, x is in cl(A) ∪ cl(B).\n\nCase 3: For every open neighborhood W of x, W intersects both A and B. In this case, x is a limit point of both A and B, and therefore x is in both cl(A) and cl(B). Thus, x is in cl(A) ∪ cl(B).\n\nIn all cases, x is in cl(A) ∪ cl(B). Therefore, cl(A ∪ B) ⊆ cl(A) ∪ cl(B).\n\nNow, we will provide an example where the closure of the union of A and B is strictly contained in the union of the closures of A and B.\n\nLet X = ℝ (the real numbers) with the standard topology, and let A = {1/n : n ∈ ℕ} and B = {-1/n : n ∈ ℕ}. Then, cl(A) = A ∪ {0} and cl(B) = B ∪ {0}, since 0 is a limit point of both A and B.\n\nNow, A ∪ B is the set of all positive and negative reciprocals of natural numbers. The closure of A ∪ B, cl(A ∪ B), is the set A ∪ B ∪ {0}, since 0 is the only limit point of A ∪ B.\n\nHowever, cl(A) ∪ cl(B) = (A ∪ {0}) ∪ (B ∪ {0}) = A ∪ B ∪ {0}. In this case, cl(A ∪ B) = cl(A) ∪ cl(B), so the containment is not strict.\n\nTo find an example where the containment is strict, consider the following modification of the sets A and B:\n\nLet A' = A ∪ {2} and B' = B. Now, cl(A') = A ∪ {0, 2} and cl(B') = B ∪ {0}. Then, cl(A') ∪ cl(B') = A ∪ B ∪ {0, 2}.\n\nHowever, cl(A' ∪ B') = cl(A ∪ B) ∪ {2} = A ∪ B ∪ {0, 2}. In this case, cl(A' ∪ B') ⊂ cl(A') ∪ cl(B'), and the containment is strict."
