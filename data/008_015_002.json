    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 14\n2x + 5y + 5z = 32\n3x + 5y + 6z = 46\n\nUse Cholesky decomposition to find the values of x, y, and z that solve this system.",
    "message_2": "Cholesky decomposition is not the most suitable method for solving this system of linear equations since it requires the matrix to be symmetric and positive definite. However, we can use other methods such as Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule to solve this system.\n\nLet's use Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Write down the augmented matrix:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 14 |\n| 2  5  5 | 32 |\n| 3  5  6 | 46 |\n\n2. Eliminate x from the second and third rows:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 14 |\n| 0  1  -1 | 4  | (R2 - 2*R1)\n| 0 -1 -3 | 4  | (R3 - 3*R1)\n\n3. Eliminate y from the third row:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 14 |\n| 0  1 -1 | 4  |\n| 0  0 -4 | 8  | (R3 + R2)\n\n4. Solve for z:\n\n-4z = 8\nz = -2\n\n5. Substitute z back into the second row to solve for y:\n\ny - (-2) = 4\ny = 2\n\n6. Substitute y and z back into the first row to solve for x:\n\nx + 2(2) + 3(-2) = 14\nx = 14 - 4 + 6\nx = 16\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 16, y = 2, and z = -2."
