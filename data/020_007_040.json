    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in Combinatorial optimization:\n\n\"Suppose you have a set of five tasks {A, B, C, D, E} that you need to complete in the least amount of time possible. The time it takes to complete each task is given in the table below. You can only work on one task at a time, and once you start a task, you must complete it before moving on to another. What is the optimal order in which to complete these tasks to minimize the total time required?\"\n\n| Task | Time to Complete |\n|------|-----------------|\n| A    | 3               |\n| B    | 5               |\n| C    | 2               |\n| D    | 4               |\n| E    | 6               | \n\nThe student would need to use their knowledge of combinatorial optimization to consider all possible orders of completing the tasks (i.e., permutations) and determine the one that results in the shortest total time.",
    "message_2": "In this case, since there are no dependencies between tasks, the optimal order to complete the tasks is simply from the shortest to the longest time required. This is known as the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) rule. \n\nSo, we can sort the tasks based on their time to complete:\n\n1. Task C (2)\n2. Task A (3)\n3. Task D (4)\n4. Task B (5)\n5. Task E (6)\n\nThe optimal order to complete the tasks is C, A, D, B, E. This will minimize the total time required to complete all tasks."
