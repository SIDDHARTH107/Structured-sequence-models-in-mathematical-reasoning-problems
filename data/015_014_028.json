    "message_2": "We are given that the initial difference in the system is δx = 0.01, and the difference doubles after t = 5 days. The exponential growth rate is λ = ln 2/t. We need to find the Lyapunov exponent for this system.\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent is given by the formula:\n\nλ = ln(δy(t) / δx) / t\n\nWe know that δy(t) doubles after t = 5 days, so:\n\nδy(t) = 2 * δx\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nλ = ln(2 * δx / δx) / 5\n\nλ = ln(2) / 5\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent for this weather system is λ ≈ 0.1386 (rounded to 4 decimal places)."
