    "message_2": "To find the probability, we need to determine the number of successful outcomes (spinning a number less than 4) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (spinning any of the 6 numbers).\n\nThere are 3 successful outcomes: spinning a 1, 2, or 3.\nThere are 6 possible outcomes: spinning a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\nThe probability of spinning a number less than 4 is:\n\nP(spinning a number less than 4) = (number of successful outcomes) / (total number of possible outcomes) = 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%."
