    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C30, D15, or a non-abelian group of order 30, we will use the Sylow Theorems.\n\nLet the order of G be 30 = 2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n5) must divide 6 (2 * 3) and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is n5 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n3) must divide 10 (2 * 5) and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possibilities are n3 = 1 or 10. Finally, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n2) must divide 15 (3 * 5) and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possibilities are n2 = 1, 3, 5, or 15.\n\nSince n5 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, P5, which is normal in G. Similarly, if n3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, P3, which is normal in G. In this case, G has a normal subgroup of order 3 and a normal subgroup of order 5. By the Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem, G is a semidirect product of P3 and P5. Since P3 and P5 are cyclic, there are two possible semidirect products: the direct product (which is abelian) and the non-abelian semidirect product.\n\nIf G is abelian, then it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30.\n\nIf G is non-abelian, then it is isomorphic to the non-abelian semidirect product of P3 and P5. This group has order 30 and is non-abelian, but it is not the dihedral group D15. The dihedral group D15 has order 2 * 15, and its Sylow 2-subgroup has order 2. However, in the non-abelian semidirect product of P3 and P5, the Sylow 2-subgroup has order 10 (since it is a subgroup of the semidirect product of P3 and P5). Thus, the non-abelian semidirect product of P3 and P5 is not isomorphic to D15.\n\nIn summary, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C30 or the non-abelian group of order 30, but not the dihedral group D15. To determine which of these two possibilities holds, we would need more information about the structure of G."
