    "message_1": "In a certain school, there are 120 students in Grade 10. If the probability of a student passing the math exam is 0.8 and the probability of a student passing the science exam is 0.7, what is the probability that a Grade 10 student will pass both subjects?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a student passing both subjects, we need to multiply the probability of passing the math exam by the probability of passing the science exam.\n\nProbability of passing both subjects = Probability of passing math * Probability of passing science\n\nProbability of passing both subjects = 0.8 * 0.7\n\nProbability of passing both subjects = 0.56\n\nSo, the probability that a Grade 10 student will pass both subjects is 0.56 or 56%."
