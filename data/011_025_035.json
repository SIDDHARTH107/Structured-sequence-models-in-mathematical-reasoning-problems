    "message_1": "Two players are playing a game where each player can either remove one or two stones from a pile. If the pile has three stones, the player who removes the final stone is the winner. How many possible starting configurations of stones are there such that the first player can always win the game, assuming both players play optimally?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If there are 1 or 2 stones in the pile, the first player can remove all the stones and win the game.\n2. If there are 3 stones in the pile, the first player can remove 1 or 2 stones, but the second player will remove the remaining stones and win the game.\n3. If there are 4 stones in the pile, the first player can remove 1 stone, leaving 3 stones for the second player. Since the second player cannot win with 3 stones, the first player will win the game.\n4. If there are 5 stones in the pile, the first player can remove 2 stones, leaving 3 stones for the second player. Again, the second player cannot win with 3 stones, so the first player will win the game.\n5. If there are 6 stones in the pile, the first player can remove 1 or 2 stones, but the second player can then remove enough stones to leave 3 stones for the first player, ensuring the second player's victory.\n6. If there are 7 stones in the pile, the first player can remove 1 stone, leaving 6 stones for the second player. As we saw in the previous case, the second player cannot win with 6 stones, so the first player will win the game.\n7. If there are 8 stones in the pile, the first player can remove 2 stones, leaving 6 stones for the second player. Again, the second player cannot win with 6 stones, so the first player will win the game.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see a pattern: the first player can always win the game if the starting number of stones is not a multiple of 3. This is because, in those cases, the first player can always leave a multiple of 3 stones for the second player, ensuring their victory.\n\nSo, to find the number of possible starting configurations of stones such that the first player can always win the game, we need to find the number of positive integers that are not multiples of 3. There is no upper limit to the number of stones, so there are infinitely many possible starting configurations where the first player can always win the game."
