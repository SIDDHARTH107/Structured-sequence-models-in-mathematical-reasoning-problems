    "message_2": "To differentiate y = sin(x^2 + 3x) with respect to x, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's denote the inner function as u(x) = x^2 + 3x. Then, the outer function is y = sin(u).\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the inner function with respect to x:\ndu/dx = d(x^2 + 3x)/dx = 2x + 3\n\nNext, we find the derivative of the outer function with respect to u:\ndy/du = d(sin(u))/du = cos(u)\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\ndy/dx = dy/du * du/dx\n\nSince dy/du = cos(u) and du/dx = 2x + 3, we substitute u back into the equation:\ndy/dx = cos(x^2 + 3x) * (2x + 3)\n\nSo, the derivative of y = sin(x^2 + 3x) with respect to x is:\ndy/dx = (2x + 3)cos(x^2 + 3x)"
