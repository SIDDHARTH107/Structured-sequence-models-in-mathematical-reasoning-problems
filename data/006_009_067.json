    "message_1": "In a certain population, the probability of an individual having a certain medical condition is 0.08. If a sample of 100 individuals is taken from this population at random, what is the probability that exactly 10 of them have the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, individuals with the medical condition) in n trials (in this case, the sample of 100 individuals)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.08)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 10)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 10) = C(100, 10) * 0.08^10 * (1-0.08)^(100-10)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(100, 10):\n\nC(100, 10) = 100! / (10!(100-10)!)\nC(100, 10) = 100! / (10!90!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(X = 10) = C(100, 10) * 0.08^10 * (1-0.08)^(100-10)\nP(X = 10) = C(100, 10) * 0.08^10 * 0.92^90\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nC(100, 10) ≈ 17,310,309,456,440\n0.08^10 ≈ 0.0000000107\n0.92^90 ≈ 0.000045\n\nNow, multiply these values together:\n\nP(X = 10) ≈ 17,310,309,456,440 * 0.0000000107 * 0.000045\nP(X = 10) ≈ 0.266\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 10 out of the 100 individuals have the medical condition is approximately 0.266 or 26.6%."
