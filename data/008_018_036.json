    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using block matrices, we can represent the system as a matrix equation AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  1  1 |\n    | 1  3  2 |\n    | 3  2  4 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 11 |\n    | 18 |\n    | 25 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of matrix A (A^(-1)) and multiply it by matrix B to get the solution matrix X.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of matrix A:\n\ndet(A) = 2(3*4 - 2*2) - 1(1*4 - 2*3) + 1(1*2 - 3*1)\n       = 2(12 - 4) - 1(4 - 6) + 1(2 - 3)\n       = 2(8) + 1(2) - 1\n       = 16 + 2 - 1\n       = 17\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of matrix A exists. Now, let's find the inverse of matrix A:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nadj(A) is the adjugate of matrix A, which is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors.\n\nCofactor matrix of A:\n\nC11 = (3*4 - 2*2) = 8\nC12 = -(1*4 - 2*3) = 2\nC13 = (1*2 - 3*1) = -1\n\nC21 = -(1*4 - 2*2) = -4\nC22 = (2*4 - 1*3) = 5\nC23 = -(2*1 - 1*3) = 1\n\nC31 = (1*2 - 3*2) = -4\nC32 = -(2*1 - 1*1) = -1\nC33 = (2*1 - 1*1) = 1\n\nadj(A) = |  8  -4  -4 |\n         |  2   5  -1 |\n         | -1   1   1 |\n\nNow, let's find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/17) * adj(A)\n\nA^(-1) = |  8/17  -4/17  -4/17 |\n         |  2/17   5/17  -1/17 |\n         | -1/17   1/17   1/17 |\n\nFinally, we can find the solution matrix X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  8/17  -4/17  -4/17 | | 11 |\n    |  2/17   5/17  -1/17 | | 18 |\n    | -1/17   1/17   1/17 | | 25 |\n\nX = | (8/17)*11 + (-4/17)*18 + (-4/17)*25 |\n    | (2/17)*11 + (5/17)*18 + (-1/17)*25 |\n    | (-1/17)*11 + (1/17)*18 + (1/17)*25 |\n\nX = | 2 |\n    | 3 |\n    | 1 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 3, and z = 1."
