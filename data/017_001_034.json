    "message_2": "First, let's define the group of integers modulo 4 under addition, which we will denote as Z4. The elements of Z4 are {0, 1, 2, 3}, and the operation is addition modulo 4. \n\nNow, let's define the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4.\n\nC4 = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element and a is a generator of the group. The operation in C4 is multiplication. The group is cyclic because every element can be expressed as a power of the generator a.\n\nV4 = {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element, and a, b, and c are elements of order 2 (meaning a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e). The operation in V4 is multiplication. The group is called the Klein four-group because it has four elements and is not cyclic.\n\nNow, we want to prove that Z4 is isomorphic to either C4 or V4. To do this, we need to find a bijective function (an isomorphism) between Z4 and either C4 or V4 that preserves the group operation.\n\nLet's first try to find an isomorphism between Z4 and C4. Define a function f: Z4 -> C4 as follows:\n\nf(0) = e\nf(1) = a\nf(2) = a^2\nf(3) = a^3\n\nThis function is clearly bijective, as each element in Z4 maps to a unique element in C4, and vice versa. Now, we need to check if it preserves the group operation. For all x, y in Z4, we have:\n\nf(x + y (mod 4)) = f(x) * f(y)\n\nLet's check this for all possible pairs of x and y in Z4:\n\nf(0 + 0) = f(0) = e = e * e = f(0) * f(0)\nf(0 + 1) = f(1) = a = e * a = f(0) * f(1)\nf(0 + 2) = f(2) = a^2 = e * a^2 = f(0) * f(2)\nf(0 + 3) = f(3) = a^3 = e * a^3 = f(0) * f(3)\nf(1 + 0) = f(1) = a = a * e = f(1) * f(0)\nf(1 + 1) = f(2) = a^2 = a * a = f(1) * f(1)\nf(1 + 2) = f(3) = a^3 = a * a^2 = f(1) * f(2)\nf(1 + 3) = f(0) = e = a * a^3 = f(1) * f(3)\nf(2 + 0) = f(2) = a^2 = a^2 * e = f(2) * f(0)\nf(2 + 1) = f(3) = a^3 = a^2 * a = f(2) * f(1)\nf(2 + 2) = f(0) = e = a^2 * a^2 = f(2) * f(2)\nf(2 + 3) = f(1) = a = a^2 * a^3 = f(2) * f(3)\nf(3 + 0) = f(3) = a^3 = a^3 * e = f(3) * f(0)\nf(3 + 1) = f(0) = e = a^3 * a = f(3) * f(1)\nf(3 + 2) = f(1) = a = a^3 * a^2 = f(3) * f(2)\nf(3 + 3) = f(2) = a^2 = a^3 * a^3 = f(3) * f(3)\n\nIn all cases, the function f preserves the group operation. Therefore, Z4 is isomorphic to C4.\n\nSince we have found an isomorphism between Z4 and C4, we don't need to check for an isomorphism between Z4 and V4. We have proven that the group of integers modulo 4 under addition is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4."
