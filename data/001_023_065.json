    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation 3sin(x) = 2cos(x) for 0 <= x <= 360 degrees, we can use the identity sin(x) = cos(90 - x). \n\nFirst, divide both sides of the equation by cos(x):\n\n3tan(x) = 2, where tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\ntan(x) = 2/3\n\nx = arctan(2/3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nx ≈ 33.69 degrees\n\nSince the tangent function has a period of 180 degrees, we can find another solution within the given range by adding 180 degrees:\n\nx ≈ 33.69 + 180 = 213.69 degrees\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation 3sin(x) = 2cos(x) within the range 0 <= x <= 360 degrees are approximately x ≈ 33.69 degrees and x ≈ 213.69 degrees."
