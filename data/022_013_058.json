This function is analytic, and we can find $u(x, y)$ and $v(x, y)$ by separating the real and imaginary parts:\n\n$f(z) = (a_1 + ia_2)(x + iy) + (b_1 + ib_2) = (a_1x - a_2y + b_1) + i(a_2x + a_1y + b_2)$\n\nComparing the real and imaginary parts, we have:\n\n$u(x, y) = a_1x - a_2y + b_1$\n$v(x, y) = a_2x + a_1y + b_2$\n\nNow, we need to find the constants $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$ such that the function passes through the points $z = 2 + i$ and $z = 3 - i$. Plugging these points into the equations for $u(x, y)$ and $v(x, y)$, we get:\n\n1. $u(2, 1) = 2a_1 - a_2 + b_1 = 2$\n2. $v(2, 1) = 2a_2 + a_1 + b_2 = 1$\n3. $u(3, -1) = 3a_1 + a_2 + b_1 = 3$\n4. $v(3, -1) = -a_2 + 3a_1 + b_2 = -1$\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we find:\n\n$a_1 = 1, a_2 = -1, b_1 = 0, b_2 = 2$\n\nThus, the analytic function is:\n\n$f(z) = (1 - i)z + 2i$\n\nSo, $f(z) = (1 - i)(x + iy) + 2i = (x + y) + i(-x + y + 2)$\n\nAnd the real and imaginary parts are:\n\n$u(x, y) = x + y$\n$v(x, y) = -x + y + 2$"
