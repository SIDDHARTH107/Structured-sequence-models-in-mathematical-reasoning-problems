    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean salary of all employees, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * (Sample Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nFirst, we need to find the critical value for a 95% confidence interval. We will use the Z-score for this, which is approximately 1.96 for a 95% confidence interval.\n\nNext, we have the sample mean ($60,000), sample standard deviation ($5,000), and sample size (50 employees).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = $60,000 ± (1.96 * ($5,000 / √50))\n\nConfidence Interval = $60,000 ± (1.96 * ($5,000 / 7.071))\n\nConfidence Interval = $60,000 ± (1.96 * $707.11)\n\nConfidence Interval = $60,000 ± $1,385.94\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the mean salary of all employees is $58,614.06 to $61,385.94."
