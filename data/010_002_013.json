Define f:[0,1]→R by f(x) = 1/x. Determine whether {f(xn)} converges to f(0) or not.",
    "message_2": "To show that if f:X→Y is a continuous function, then {f(xn)} converges to f(x) in Y, we need to use the definition of continuity and the definition of convergence.\n\nRecall that a function f:X→Y is continuous at a point x in X if for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that for all y in X, if d_X(x, y) < δ, then d_Y(f(x), f(y)) < ε. In other words, if the distance between x and y in X is small enough, then the distance between their images under f in Y is also small.\n\nNow, let {xn} be a sequence in X such that xn converges to x. By definition, this means that for every ε > 0, there exists an N ∈ ℕ such that for all n ≥ N, d_X(x, xn) < ε. We want to show that {f(xn)} converges to f(x) in Y, which means that for every ε > 0, there exists an N ∈ ℕ such that for all n ≥ N, d_Y(f(x), f(xn)) < ε.\n\nSince f is continuous at x, for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that for all y in X, if d_X(x, y) < δ, then d_Y(f(x), f(y)) < ε. Now, since xn converges to x, there exists an N ∈ ℕ such that for all n ≥ N, d_X(x, xn) < δ. Then, for all n ≥ N, d_Y(f(x), f(xn)) < ε, which means that {f(xn)} converges to f(x) in Y.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific example where X = [0,1] with the usual metric, {xn} = {1/n}, and f(x) = 1/x. We want to determine whether {f(xn)} converges to f(0) or not.\n\nFirst, note that f(0) is not defined, as 1/0 is undefined. However, we can consider the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0. As x approaches 0, f(x) = 1/x approaches infinity. Therefore, we can say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 is infinity.\n\nNow, let's examine the sequence {f(xn)} = {f(1/n)}. We have:\n\nf(xn) = f(1/n) = 1/(1/n) = n\n\nAs n goes to infinity, the sequence {f(xn)} = {n} also goes to infinity. Therefore, {f(xn)} converges to the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0, which is infinity."
