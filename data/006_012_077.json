    "message_1": "In a certain neighborhood, the probability of a theft occurring on any given day is 0.2. What is the probability that there will be at least 2 thefts in the neighborhood in a week (7 days)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complement probability. Instead of finding the probability of at least 2 thefts, we will find the probability of 0 or 1 thefts and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of 0 thefts in a week:\nP(0 thefts) = (1 - 0.2)^7 = 0.8^7 ≈ 0.2097\n\nNow let's find the probability of exactly 1 theft in a week. We can use the binomial probability formula for this:\n\nP(k thefts) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (days in a week), k is the number of successful trials (thefts), p is the probability of success (theft), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nP(1 theft) = C(7, 1) * (0.2)^1 * (0.8)^6\nP(1 theft) = (7) * (0.2) * (0.8)^6 ≈ 0.3670\n\nNow we can find the complement probability:\n\nP(at least 2 thefts) = 1 - P(0 thefts) - P(1 theft)\nP(at least 2 thefts) = 1 - 0.2097 - 0.3670 ≈ 0.4233\n\nSo the probability of at least 2 thefts in the neighborhood in a week is approximately 0.4233 or 42.33%."
