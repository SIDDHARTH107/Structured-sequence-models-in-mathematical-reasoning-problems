    "message_1": "A group of 15 students is taking a mathematics exam. The teacher wants to divide the students into teams of 5 for a group assignment. How many different teams can the teacher create?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of different teams the teacher can create, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students, k is the number of students in each team, and ! denotes the factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nIn this case, n = 15 and k = 5. So, we have:\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5!(15-5)!)\n\nC(15, 5) = 15! / (5!10!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorials:\n\n15! = 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 1,307,674,368,000\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the combination formula:\n\nC(15, 5) = 1,307,674,368,000 / (120 × 3,628,800)\n\nC(15, 5) = 1,307,674,368,000 / 435,456,000\n\nC(15, 5) = 3,003\n\nSo, the teacher can create 3,003 different teams of 5 students."
