    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph G, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the edges of G such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the graph G, denoted by Δ(G). Since G has 8 vertices and 12 edges, the average degree of the graph is (2 * 12) / 8 = 3. Therefore, the maximum degree Δ(G) must be at least 3. However, if Δ(G) were 4, then the total number of edges would be at least (4 * 8) / 2 = 16, which is more than 12. So, Δ(G) must be 3.\n\nNow, let's use Vizing's Theorem to find the chromatic index of G. Vizing's Theorem states that for any graph G, Δ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1. Since Δ(G) = 3, we have two possibilities for the chromatic index: χ'(G) = 3 or χ'(G) = 4.\n\nTo determine which of these possibilities is correct, we need to check if G can be edge-colored with 3 colors. If it can, then χ'(G) = 3; otherwise, χ'(G) = 4.\n\nConsider a vertex v with degree 3 in G. Since G has 12 edges, there must be at least one more vertex w with degree 3. Now, consider the subgraph G' induced by the vertices v and w and their neighbors. G' has 6 vertices and at least 6 edges (3 edges incident to v and 3 edges incident to w). The average degree of G' is (2 * 6) / 6 = 2, so G' must have at least one vertex with degree 3. However, this is not possible, as it would require G' to have more than 6 edges, which contradicts the fact that G has only 12 edges in total.\n\nTherefore, G cannot be edge-colored with 3 colors, and we conclude that the chromatic index of G is χ'(G) = 4."
