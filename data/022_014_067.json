    "message_2": "(a) To show that f is a harmonic function, we need to show that it satisfies Laplace's equation, which means that the sum of its second partial derivatives with respect to the real and imaginary parts of z is equal to zero.\n\nLet z = x + iy, where x and y are real numbers. Then, z^2 = (x + iy)^2 = x^2 + 2ixy - y^2. Therefore, f(z) = Re(z^2) = x^2 - y^2.\n\nNow, let's compute the second partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y:\n\n∂^2f/∂x^2 = ∂/∂x(2x) = 2\n∂^2f/∂y^2 = ∂/∂y(-2y) = -2\n\nNow, let's check if Laplace's equation is satisfied:\n\n∂^2f/∂x^2 + ∂^2f/∂y^2 = 2 - 2 = 0\n\nSince Laplace's equation is satisfied, f is a harmonic function.\n\n(b) To find the imaginary part of the function f(z) = Re(z^2), we can use the fact that the imaginary part of a complex number is given by Im(z) = (z - z*)/2i, where z* is the complex conjugate of z.\n\nLet g(z) = Im(z^2). Then, g(z) = Im((x + iy)^2) = Im(x^2 + 2ixy - y^2) = 2xy.\n\nSo, the imaginary part of the function f(z) = Re(z^2) is g(z) = 2xy."
