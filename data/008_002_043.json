    "message_2": "To find the inverse of matrix A using elementary row operations, we will augment matrix A with the identity matrix and perform row operations until the left side becomes the identity matrix. The right side will then be the inverse of A.\n\nStep 1: Augment matrix A with the identity matrix\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 2 & | & 1 & 0 \\\\\n    3 & 5 & | & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to get a 1 in the top left corner (if not already there)\n\nIn this case, we already have a 1 in the top left corner, so we can move on to the next step.\n\nStep 3: Perform row operations to get a 0 below the 1 in the top left corner\n\nSubtract 3 times the first row from the second row:\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 2 & | & 1 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & -1 & | & -3 & 1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nStep 4: Perform row operations to get a 1 in the second row and second column\n\nMultiply the second row by -1:\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 2 & | & 1 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 1 & | & 3 & -1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nStep 5: Perform row operations to get a 0 above the 1 in the second row and second column\n\nSubtract 2 times the second row from the first row:\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & | & -5 & 2 \\\\\n    0 & 1 & | & 3 & -1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nNow, the left side of the augmented matrix is the identity matrix, and the right side is the inverse of A:\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n  A^{-1} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -5 & 2 \\\\\n    3 & -1 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}"
