    "message_1": "Consider the following signaling game: \n\nPlayer 1 has a choice between two signals: s1 and s2. The choice of signal s1 will give her a payoff of 3 if Player 2 has a type T1 and 1 if Player 2 has a type T2. The choice of signal s2 will give her a payoff of 4 if Player 2 has a type T2 and 2 if Player 2 has a type T1.\n\nPlayer 2 has a type that is either T1 or T2, and observes the signal that Player 1 chooses. If Player 2 observes signal s1, then he believes the probability that Player 1 has type T1 is p1, and if Player 2 observes signal s2, then he believes the probability that Player 1 has type T1 is p2.\n\nThe problem for the math student to solve is: what values of p1 and p2 will make it optimal for Player 1 to choose signal s2, assuming that Player 2 will play a best response to his beliefs?",
    "message_2": "To determine the values of p1 and p2 that make it optimal for Player 1 to choose signal s2, we need to compare the expected payoffs for Player 1 when choosing s1 and s2.\n\nLet q1 be the probability that Player 2 has type T1 and q2 be the probability that Player 2 has type T2. Note that q1 + q2 = 1.\n\nThe expected payoff for Player 1 when choosing signal s1 is:\n\nE(s1) = 3 * q1 * p1 + 1 * q2 * (1 - p1)\n\nThe expected payoff for Player 1 when choosing signal s2 is:\n\nE(s2) = 4 * q2 * p2 + 2 * q1 * (1 - p2)\n\nPlayer 1 will choose signal s2 if E(s2) > E(s1). Thus, we need to find the values of p1 and p2 that satisfy this inequality.\n\n4 * q2 * p2 + 2 * q1 * (1 - p2) > 3 * q1 * p1 + 1 * q2 * (1 - p1)\n\nRearranging the inequality, we get:\n\n(4 * q2 - 2 * q1) * p2 + 2 * q1 > (3 * q1 - 1 * q2) * p1 + 1 * q2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of p1 and p2 that satisfy this inequality. Since p1 and p2 are probabilities, they must lie in the interval [0, 1]. We can analyze the inequality in different cases:\n\nCase 1: 4 * q2 - 2 * q1 > 0 and 3 * q1 - 1 * q2 > 0\nIn this case, both coefficients of p1 and p2 are positive. To satisfy the inequality, we need to choose p1 = 0 and p2 = 1.\n\nCase 2: 4 * q2 - 2 * q1 < 0 and 3 * q1 - 1 * q2 < 0\nIn this case, both coefficients of p1 and p2 are negative. To satisfy the inequality, we need to choose p1 = 1 and p2 = 0.\n\nCase 3: 4 * q2 - 2 * q1 > 0 and 3 * q1 - 1 * q2 < 0\nIn this case, the coefficient of p1 is negative and the coefficient of p2 is positive. To satisfy the inequality, we need to choose p1 = 1 and p2 = 1.\n\nCase 4: 4 * q2 - 2 * q1 < 0 and 3 * q1 - 1 * q2 > 0\nIn this case, the coefficient of p1 is positive and the coefficient of p2 is negative. To satisfy the inequality, we need to choose p1 = 0 and p2 = 0.\n\nIn summary, the values of p1 and p2 that make it optimal for Player 1 to choose signal s2 are:\n\n- p1 = 0 and p2 = 1 for Case 1\n- p1 = 1 and p2 = 0 for Case 2\n- p1 = 1 and p2 = 1 for Case 3\n- p1 = 0 and p2 = 0 for Case 4"
