    "message_2": "To find the complement of Set A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of Set A, denoted as A', consists of all the elements in the universal set U that are not in Set A.\n\nLet's assume the universal set U contains the elements from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Now, we can find the complement of Set A.\n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nComparing the elements of U and A, we can see that the elements 8, 9, and 10 are not in Set A. Therefore, the complement of Set A is:\n\nA' = {8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's prove that the complement is unique. Suppose there is another complement of Set A, denoted as B, such that B ≠ A'. Since B is a complement of A, it must contain all the elements in U that are not in Set A. This means that B must also contain the elements 8, 9, and 10.\n\nNow, let's compare the elements of A' and B:\n\nA' = {8, 9, 10}\nB = {8, 9, 10}\n\nSince both A' and B contain the same elements, it means that A' = B. This contradicts our initial assumption that B ≠ A'. Therefore, the complement of Set A is unique, and it is A' = {8, 9, 10}."
