    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having x successes (in this case, 60 individuals affected by the disease) in n trials (in this case, 500 individuals)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (also written as C(n, x) or \"n choose x\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the incidence rate of the disease, 6% or 0.06)\n- x is the number of successes (in this case, 60 individuals)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 500 individuals)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate nCx, which is:\n\nnCx = n! / (x!(n-x)!)\n\nwhere ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nIn this case, n = 500 and x = 60, so:\n\nnCx = 500! / (60!(500-60)!)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(60) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\nP(60) = (500! / (60!(500-60)!)) * (0.06^60) * (1-0.06)^(500-60)\n\nCalculating this expression, we get:\n\nP(60) â‰ˆ 0.0394\n\nSo, the probability that out of a randomly selected group of 500 individuals, 60 will be affected by the specific disease is approximately 3.94%."
