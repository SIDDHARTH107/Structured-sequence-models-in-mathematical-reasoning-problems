    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the Gauss-Jordan elimination method, we first write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n[ 2 -3  4 |  7 ]\n[ 5  2 -1 | -4 ]\n```\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix in reduced row echelon form (RREF).\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1.5  2 |  3.5 ]\n[ 5  2   -1 | -4  ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with (-5 times the first row) + the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1.5  2  |  3.5 ]\n[ 0  9.5 -9  | -21.5 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 9.5 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1.5  2  |  3.5 ]\n[ 0  1   -9/9.5 | -21.5/9.5 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Replace the first row with (1.5 times the second row) + the first row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  2 - 3*(-9/9.5) | 3.5 + 1.5*(-21.5/9.5) ]\n[ 0  1   -9/9.5 | -21.5/9.5 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in RREF:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  1.5 | -1 ]\n[ 0  1  -9/9.5 | -21.5/9.5 ]\n```\n\nThis corresponds to the following system of equations:\n\n```\nx + 1.5z = -1\ny - (9/9.5)z = -21.5/9.5\n```\n\nSince we have a non-square coefficient matrix and a free variable (z), we can express the solution in terms of z:\n\n```\nx = -1 - 1.5z\ny = -21.5/9.5 + (9/9.5)z\nz = z\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = -1 - 1.5z\ny = -21.5/9.5 + (9/9.5)z\nz = z\n```"
