    "message_1": "Assume that John has 4 apples and 3 oranges. He also knows that if he has fruits, then he has a healthy snack. However, he is not sure whether having a healthy snack would make him more productive. Later, John gets 1 more apple. How many fruits does John have, assuming that having a healthy snack does not make him more productive according to the non-monotonic logic?",
    "message_2": "John initially has 4 apples and 3 oranges, which totals to 7 fruits. After getting 1 more apple, he now has 4 + 1 = 5 apples. So, John has a total of 5 apples + 3 oranges = 8 fruits. The non-monotonic logic regarding his productivity does not affect the number of fruits he has."
