    "message_2": "Step 1: Create the Playfair cipher table using the keyword \"MATH\"\n\nTo create the table, we first write the keyword \"MATH\" without repeating any letters. Then, we fill in the rest of the table with the remaining letters of the alphabet in order, excluding \"J\" (since \"I\" and \"J\" are treated as the same letter in the Playfair cipher). The table will look like this:\n\nM A T H\nB C D E\nF G I K\nL N O P\nQ R S U\nV W X Y\nZ\n\nStep 2: Prepare the message for encryption\n\nWe need to remove spaces and any punctuation from the message, and then break it into pairs of letters. If a pair has the same letter twice, we insert an \"X\" between them. If the message has an odd number of letters, we add an \"X\" at the end. In this case, the message \"MEET ME AT THE PARK\" becomes \"MEXETMEATTHXEPARK\".\n\nStep 3: Encrypt the message using the Playfair cipher table\n\nNow, we encrypt each pair of letters using the table. For each pair, we follow these rules:\n\n1. If the letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrapping around to the start of the row if necessary).\n2. If the letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrapping around to the top of the column if necessary).\n3. If the letters form a rectangle in the table, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\nMEXETMEATTHXEPARK\nME -> OD\nXE -> YC\nTM -> TA\nEA -> MC\nTT -> TH\nHX -> YK\nEP -> DI\nAR -> RN\nKX -> KZ\n\nStep 4: Combine the encrypted pairs\n\nCombine the encrypted pairs to get the final encrypted message: \"ODYCTAMCTHYKYKZ\"."
