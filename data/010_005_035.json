The set of all real numbers between 0 and 1, with the topology induced by the usual metric, where the endpoints are not included.\n2. The set of all real numbers between 0 and 1, with the topology induced by the usual metric, where the endpoints are included. \n\nWhich of the two spaces is connected and which is path-connected?

    "message_2": "1. The set of all real numbers between 0 and 1, with the topology induced by the usual metric, where the endpoints are not included.\n\nLet's denote this set as (0, 1). We will show that this space is both connected and path-connected.\n\nConnectedness:\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that (0, 1) is not connected. Then there exist two nonempty, disjoint, open sets A and B such that (0, 1) = A ∪ B. Without loss of generality, let a ∈ A and b ∈ B with a < b. Since the topology is induced by the usual metric, there exists a real number r between a and b, i.e., a < r < b. However, r must belong to either A or B, which contradicts the fact that A and B are disjoint. Therefore, our assumption that (0, 1) is not connected is false, and (0, 1) is connected.\n\nPath-connectedness:\nLet x, y ∈ (0, 1) with x < y. Define a continuous function f: [0, 1] → (0, 1) by f(t) = x + t(y - x). It is easy to verify that f is continuous, f(0) = x, and f(1) = y. Thus, there exists a continuous path between any two points x and y in (0, 1), which means that (0, 1) is path-connected.\n\n2. The set of all real numbers between 0 and 1, with the topology induced by the usual metric, where the endpoints are included.\n\nLet's denote this set as [0, 1]. We will show that this space is both connected and path-connected.\n\nConnectedness:\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that [0, 1] is not connected. Then there exist two nonempty, disjoint, open sets A and B such that [0, 1] = A ∪ B. Without loss of generality, let a ∈ A and b ∈ B with a < b. Since the topology is induced by the usual metric, there exists a real number r between a and b, i.e., a < r < b. However, r must belong to either A or B, which contradicts the fact that A and B are disjoint. Therefore, our assumption that [0, 1] is not connected is false, and [0, 1] is connected.\n\nPath-connectedness:\nLet x, y ∈ [0, 1] with x ≤ y. Define a continuous function f: [0, 1] → [0, 1] by f(t) = x + t(y - x). It is easy to verify that f is continuous, f(0) = x, and f(1) = y. Thus, there exists a continuous path between any two points x and y in [0, 1], which means that [0, 1] is path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, both topological spaces (0, 1) and [0, 1] are connected and path-connected."
