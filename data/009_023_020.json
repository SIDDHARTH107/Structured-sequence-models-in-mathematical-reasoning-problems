    "message_2": "To solve the given Nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) using the Fourier transform method, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the initial condition ψ(x,0) = 2 sech(x). \n\nThe Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of ψ(x,0) = 2 sech(x) is:\n\nΨ(k,0) = ∫[2 sech(x) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Ψ(k,0):\n\nψ(x,0) = (1/2π) ∫[Ψ(k,0) * e^(ikx)] dk\n\nSince the solution is invariant under spatial translations, we can assume that the solution has the form:\n\nψ(x,t) = (1/2π) ∫[Ψ(k,t) * e^(ikx)] dk\n\nNow, we need to find Ψ(k,t). To do this, we can substitute the solution form into the NLSE and then solve for Ψ(k,t):\n\ni(1/2π) ∫[Ψ(k,t) * e^(ikx)] dk_t + (1/2π) ∫[Ψ(k,t) * e^(ikx)] dk_xx + 2|(1/2π) ∫[Ψ(k,t) * e^(ikx)] dk|^2 * (1/2π) ∫[Ψ(k,t) * e^(ikx)] dk = 0\n\nNow, we can take the Fourier transform of the above equation and solve for Ψ(k,t):\n\nΨ(k,t) = Ψ(k,0) * e^(-ik^2t)\n\nNow, we can find ψ(x,5) by taking the inverse Fourier transform of Ψ(k,5):\n\nψ(x,5) = (1/2π) ∫[Ψ(k,5) * e^(ikx)] dk\nψ(x,5) = (1/2π) ∫[Ψ(k,0) * e^(-ik^2*5) * e^(ikx)] dk\nψ(x,5) = (1/2π) ∫[2 sech(x) * e^(-ik^2*5) * e^(ikx)] dx\n\nNow, we need to normalize the wave packet so that it has mass 1. To do this, we can find the normalization constant N:\n\nN = ∫[|ψ(x,5)|^2] dx\n\nSince the initial condition is already normalized (i.e., ∫[|2 sech(x)|^2] dx = 1), the normalization constant N is 1. Therefore, the normalized solution is:\n\nψ(x,5) = (1/2π) ∫[2 sech(x) * e^(-ik^2*5) * e^(ikx)] dx\n\nThis is the solution for ψ(x,5) using the Fourier transform method."
