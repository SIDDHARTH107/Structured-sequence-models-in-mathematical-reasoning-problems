They want to determine whether there is a significant difference in the lifespan of the batteries. They randomly choose 12 batteries of each type and test them until they die. The lifespan of each battery is recorded in hours and the data is shown below. Use a significance level of 0.05 to determine whether there is a significant difference in the lifespan of the batteries.\n\nBattery type 1: 495, 513, 482, 499, 506, 513, 518, 512, 509, 497, 504, 519\n\nBattery type 2: 508, 510, 500, 515, 501, 518, 504, 513, 505, 502, 499, 516\n\nBattery type 3: 524, 529, 536, 532, 535, 523, 530, 526, 534, 529, 521, 532",
    "message_2": "To determine whether there is a significant difference in the lifespan of the batteries, we can perform a one-way ANOVA test. First, we need to calculate the mean lifespan for each battery type and the overall mean lifespan.\n\nBattery type 1 mean: (495+513+482+499+506+513+518+512+509+497+504+519)/12 = 504.5\nBattery type 2 mean: (508+510+500+515+501+518+504+513+505+502+499+516)/12 = 507.25\nBattery type 3 mean: (524+529+536+532+535+523+530+526+534+529+521+532)/12 = 529.5\n\nOverall mean: (504.5+507.25+529.5)/3 = 513.75\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB), sum of squares within groups (SSW), and the total sum of squares (SST).\n\nSSB = Σ(n_i*(mean_i - overall_mean)^2)\nSSB = 12*((504.5-513.75)^2 + (507.25-513.75)^2 + (529.5-513.75)^2) = 12*(87.5625 + 42.25 + 246.5625) = 4509\n\nSSW = ΣΣ(x_ij - mean_i)^2\nFor battery type 1: Σ(x_ij - 504.5)^2 = 1314.5\nFor battery type 2: Σ(x_ij - 507.25)^2 = 784.75\nFor battery type 3: Σ(x_ij - 529.5)^2 = 618.5\nSSW = 1314.5 + 784.75 + 618.5 = 2717.75\n\nSST = SSB + SSW = 4509 + 2717.75 = 7226.75\n\nNow we calculate the mean square between groups (MSB) and the mean square within groups (MSW).\n\nMSB = SSB / (k - 1) = 4509 / (3 - 1) = 2254.5\nMSW = SSW / (N - k) = 2717.75 / (36 - 3) = 84.93\n\nNext, we calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW = 2254.5 / 84.93 = 26.54\n\nNow, we need to find the critical F-value for a significance level of 0.05. Using an F-distribution table, we find the critical F-value for df1 = 2 (k - 1) and df2 = 33 (N - k) is 3.28.\n\nSince our calculated F-statistic (26.54) is greater than the critical F-value (3.28), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the lifespan of the batteries. Therefore, there is a significant difference in the lifespan of the batteries at a 0.05 significance level."
