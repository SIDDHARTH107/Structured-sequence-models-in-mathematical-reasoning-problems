    "message_2": "Let's denote the largest integer as x. We are given that x divides 2310 and leaves a remainder of 1 when dividing 21. This can be represented as:\n\n2310 = x * a (for some integer a)\n21 = x * b + 1 (for some integer b)\n\nWe can rewrite the second equation as:\n\nx = (21 - 1) / b\nx = 20 / b\n\nNow, we need to find the largest integer x that satisfies both equations. We can start by finding the divisors of 20:\n\n1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20\n\nNow, we need to check which of these divisors satisfy the first equation (2310 = x * a). We can do this by dividing 2310 by each divisor and checking if the result is an integer:\n\n2310 / 1 = 2310 (integer)\n2310 / 2 = 1155 (integer)\n2310 / 4 = 577.5 (not an integer)\n2310 / 5 = 462 (integer)\n2310 / 10 = 231 (integer)\n2310 / 20 = 115.5 (not an integer)\n\nThe largest integer that divides 2310 and also leaves a remainder of 1 when dividing 21 is 10."
