    "message_2": "The largest bulb in the Mandelbrot set is the circle centered at -1 on the real axis with a radius of 1/4. The main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is given by the equation r = 1/2 * (1 - cos(θ)), where r is the distance from the origin and θ is the angle.\n\nIf the radius of the main cardioid is 1/4 of the distance from the center of the circle to the edge of the largest bulb, then the radius of the main cardioid is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nTo find the area of the main cardioid, we can use the polar coordinate formula for the area of a curve:\n\nA = 1/2 * ∫(r^2 dθ) from 0 to 2π\n\nIn this case, r = 1/2 * (1 - cos(θ)), so r^2 = 1/4 * (1 - cos(θ))^2.\n\nNow we need to integrate r^2 with respect to θ from 0 to 2π:\n\nA = 1/2 * ∫(1/4 * (1 - cos(θ))^2 dθ) from 0 to 2π\n\nA = 1/8 * ∫((1 - 2cos(θ) + cos^2(θ)) dθ) from 0 to 2π\n\nTo simplify the integral, we can use the double-angle identity for cosine: cos^2(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2\n\nA = 1/8 * ∫(1 - 2cos(θ) + (1 + cos(2θ))/2) dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nA = 1/8 * ∫(2 - 2cos(θ) + cos(2θ))/2 dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nA = 1/8 * ∫(1 - cos(θ) + 1/2*cos(2θ)) dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nNow we can integrate each term separately:\n\nA = 1/8 * [θ - sin(θ) + 1/4*sin(2θ)] from 0 to 2π\n\nA = 1/8 * [(2π - 0) - (sin(2π) - sin(0)) + 1/4*(sin(4π) - sin(0))]\n\nA = 1/8 * [2π]\n\nA = π/4\n\nSo the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set with the given radius is π/4."
