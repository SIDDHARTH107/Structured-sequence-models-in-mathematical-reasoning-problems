    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection of sets A and B: A ∩ B = {5}, since 5 is the only element that is common to both sets.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and C: (A ∩ B) x C = {5} x {1, 2, 3, 4} = {(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)}.\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of A and C: A x C = {3, 5, 7} x {1, 2, 3, 4} = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)}.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B and C: B x C = {2, 5} x {1, 2, 3, 4} = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)}.\n\nFinally, let's find the intersection of A x C and B x C: A x C ∩ B x C = {(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)}, since these are the ordered pairs that are common to both A x C and B x C.\n\nNow, let's compare our findings:\n\n(A ∩ B) x C = {(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)}\nA x C ∩ B x C = {(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)}\n\nSince (A ∩ B) x C = A x C ∩ B x C, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is distributive over intersection for this example."
