    "message_2": "To compute the Floer homology group $\\widehat{HF}(T^2,g)$, we first need to find the Reeb vector field associated with the contact form $\\alpha$. Recall that the Reeb vector field $R$ is defined by the conditions:\n\n1. $\\alpha(R) = 1$\n2. $d\\alpha(R, \\cdot) = 0$\n\nGiven the contact form $\\alpha = xdy - ydx$, we can compute its exterior derivative:\n\n$$d\\alpha = d(xdy - ydx) = dx \\wedge dy - dy \\wedge dx = 2 dx \\wedge dy$$\n\nNow, let's find the Reeb vector field $R = a(x,y) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + b(x,y) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$, where $a(x,y)$ and $b(x,y)$ are smooth functions on $T^2$. We need to satisfy the conditions mentioned above:\n\n1. $\\alpha(R) = (xdy - ydx)(a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + b \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}) = x b - y a = 1$\n2. $d\\alpha(R, \\cdot) = 2 dx \\wedge dy (a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + b \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}, \\cdot) = 2(dx(a) dy - dy(a) dx) = 0$\n\nFrom the second condition, we have $dx(a) = dy(a) = 0$, which implies that $a$ and $b$ are constants. Substituting this into the first condition, we get $xb - ya = 1$. The Reeb vector field that satisfies these conditions is:\n\n$$R = \\frac{1}{x^2 + y^2}(-y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y})$$\n\nNow, we need to find the periodic orbits of the Reeb vector field. The periodic orbits correspond to the solutions of the following system of ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{x} = -\\frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} \\\\\n\\dot{y} = \\frac{x}{x^2 + y^2}\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nThis system of ODEs is invariant under rotations, so we can look for solutions in polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$. The equations become:\n\n$$\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{r} = 0 \\\\\n\\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r^2}\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nThe first equation implies that $r$ is constant, and the second equation can be integrated to find $\\theta(t) = \\frac{t}{r^2} + \\theta_0$. The periodic orbits correspond to the circles centered at the origin with radius $r$, and their periods are given by $T = 2\\pi r^2$.\n\nNow, we can compute the Floer homology group $\\widehat{HF}(T^2,g)$. Since the Reeb vector field has non-degenerate periodic orbits, the Floer homology is isomorphic to the singular homology of the free loop space of $T^2$. In this case, the free loop space is homotopy equivalent to $T^2$, so we have:\n\n$$\\widehat{HF}(T^2,g) \\cong H_*(T^2) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$$\n\nThus, the Floer homology group of the 2-torus with the given Riemannian metric and contact form is $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$."
