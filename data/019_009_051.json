    "message_2": "Let S represent \"it is sunny outside\", U represent \"I have an umbrella\", and W represent \"I will take a walk\". The given proposition can be written as:\n\n(S ∧ U) → W\n\nIn intuitionistic logic, we can represent the implication using ¬ and ∨. The formula becomes:\n\n¬(S ∧ U) ∨ W"
