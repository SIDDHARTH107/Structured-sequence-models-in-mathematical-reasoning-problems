    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using a Rail fence cipher with a key of 3, we write the message in a zigzag pattern along three rows as follows:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, we read the message along the rows from left to right and top to bottom:\n\nHOLELWRLDO\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"HOLELWRLDO\"."
