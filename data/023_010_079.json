    "message_2": "When using the Fourier Transform to compress a grayscale image, the image is represented in the frequency domain. However, the number of bits required to represent the image in the frequency domain depends on the level of compression desired. \n\nIn general, the Fourier Transform will produce complex numbers for each pixel in the frequency domain. To represent these complex numbers, you would need to store both the real and imaginary parts. Assuming you still use 8 bits per pixel for each part (real and imaginary), you would need 16 bits per pixel in the frequency domain.\n\nFor a 512x512 image, there are a total of 512 x 512 = 262,144 pixels. So, without any compression, you would need:\n\n262,144 pixels * 16 bits per pixel = 4,194,304 bits\n\nHowever, this does not take into account any compression. To achieve compression, you can discard some of the less significant frequency components, which will result in a smaller number of bits needed to represent the image in the frequency domain. The actual number of bits required will depend on the desired level of compression and the specific image content."
