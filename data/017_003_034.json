    "message_2": "To prove that every group of order 17 is cyclic, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of prime order is always cyclic.\n2. 17 is a prime number.\n\nLet G be a group of order 17. Since 17 is a prime number, by fact 1, G must be a cyclic group. Therefore, every group of order 17 is cyclic."
