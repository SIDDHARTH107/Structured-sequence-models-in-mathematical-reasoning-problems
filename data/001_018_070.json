    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression log₄(64) + 2 log₉(81), we'll first evaluate each logarithm separately.\n\n1. log₄(64): Since 4³ = 64, the logarithm log₄(64) is equal to 3.\n\n2. log₉(81): Since 9² = 81, the logarithm log₉(81) is equal to 2.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the original expression:\n\nlog₄(64) + 2 log₉(81) = 3 + 2(2)\n\n3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is 7."
