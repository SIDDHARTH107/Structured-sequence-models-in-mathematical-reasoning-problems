    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium of this Beauty Contest Game with three players, we need to consider the best response of each player to the other players' strategies. Let's denote the chosen numbers by the three players as x, y, and z.\n\nThe average of the three chosen numbers is (x+y+z)/3, and the target number is 2/3 of this average, which is (2/3)((x+y+z)/3) = (2(x+y+z))/9.\n\nNow, let's consider the best response of each player to the other players' strategies:\n\n1. Player 1 chooses x to be as close as possible to (2(y+z))/9.\n2. Player 2 chooses y to be as close as possible to (2(x+z))/9.\n3. Player 3 chooses z to be as close as possible to (2(x+y))/9.\n\nIn a Nash equilibrium, each player's strategy is the best response to the other players' strategies. Therefore, we need to find x, y, and z such that:\n\n1. x = (2(y+z))/9\n2. y = (2(x+z))/9\n3. z = (2(x+y))/9\n\nAdding these three equations, we get:\n\nx + y + z = (2(y+z))/9 + (2(x+z))/9 + (2(x+y))/9\n9(x + y + z) = 2(y+z) + 2(x+z) + 2(x+y)\n9(x + y + z) = 2(x+y+z)\n9 = 2\n\nThis result is a contradiction, which means that there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game. However, there might be a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, where each player chooses a probability distribution over their possible choices. In this case, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium would involve each player randomizing their choice of number between 0 and 100, such that their expected choice is equal to 2/3 of the expected average of the other two players' choices."
