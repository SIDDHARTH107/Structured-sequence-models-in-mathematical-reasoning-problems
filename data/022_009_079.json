    "message_2": "To determine the radius of convergence and interval of convergence of the given power series, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that the radius of convergence R is given by:\n\n$$R = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}\\right|$$\n\nwhere $a_n$ is the nth term of the series. In this case, we have:\n\n$$a_n = \\frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}(z-2i)^n$$\n\nSo, we can compute the ratio:\n\n$$\\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}} = \\frac{\\frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}(z-2i)^n}{\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n+2}(z-2i)^{n+1}} = \\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\frac{(-1)^n(z-2i)^n}{(-1)^{n+1}(z-2i)^{n+1}}$$\n\nTaking the absolute value and simplifying:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\frac{(-1)^n(z-2i)^n}{(-1)^{n+1}(z-2i)^{n+1}}\\right| = \\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\frac{|(z-2i)^n|}{|(z-2i)^{n+1}|} = \\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\frac{1}{|z-2i|}$$\n\nNow, we take the limit as n approaches infinity:\n\n$$R = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\frac{1}{|z-2i|} = \\frac{1}{|z-2i|}$$\n\nThus, the radius of convergence is:\n\n$$R = \\frac{1}{|z-2i|}$$\n\nNow, to find the interval of convergence, we need to analyze the behavior of the series at the endpoints of the interval. However, since this is a power series in the complex plane, there are no endpoints to check. The series converges for all complex numbers z such that:\n\n$$|z-2i| < 1$$\n\nThis represents an open disk in the complex plane centered at 2i with a radius of 1."
