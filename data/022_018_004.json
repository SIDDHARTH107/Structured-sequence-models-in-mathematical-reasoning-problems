    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE), we will first rewrite it in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let $u(x, y) = u_r(x, y) + i u_i(x, y)$, where $u_r(x, y)$ and $u_i(x, y)$ are the real and imaginary parts of $u(x, y)$, respectively. Then the PDE becomes:\n\n$$(1 + i) \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial x} + i \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x} \\right) - (1 - i) \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial y} + i \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial y} \\right) = 2 + 2i$$\n\nExpanding and equating the real and imaginary parts, we get two PDEs:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial y} = 2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial y} = 2$$\n\nNow, let's consider the initial conditions. For $u(x, 0) = \\cos(x)$, we have $u_r(x, 0) = \\cos(x)$ and $u_i(x, 0) = 0$. For $u(0, y) = e^{iy}$, we have $u_r(0, y) = \\cos(y)$ and $u_i(0, y) = \\sin(y)$.\n\nWe will now solve the PDEs using the method of characteristics. For the first PDE, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{dx}{1} = \\frac{dy}{-1} = \\frac{du_r}{2} = \\frac{du_i}{0}$$\n\nFrom this, we can see that $u_i$ is constant along the characteristic curves. Since $u_i(x, 0) = 0$, we have $u_i(x, y) = 0$ for all $(x, y)$. Now, we can find the characteristic curves for $u_r$:\n\n$$\\frac{dx}{1} = \\frac{dy}{-1} = \\frac{du_r}{2}$$\n\nIntegrating the first two ratios, we get $x + y = c_1$, where $c_1$ is a constant. Now, integrating the first and third ratios, we get $u_r - 2x = c_2(c_1)$, where $c_2(c_1)$ is a function of $c_1$. Using the initial condition $u_r(x, 0) = \\cos(x)$, we have:\n\n$$\\cos(x) - 2x = c_2(x)$$\n\nThus, $u_r(x, y) = 2x + \\cos(x + y)$. Therefore, the solution to the given PDE is:\n\n$$u(x, y) = u_r(x, y) + i u_i(x, y) = (2x + \\cos(x + y)) + i(0) = 2x + \\cos(x + y)$$"
