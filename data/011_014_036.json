    "message_1": "Suppose there are 8 students in a math club. Each student must shake hands with every other student exactly once. How many handshakes will take place in total?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of handshakes, we can use the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of students and k is the number of students involved in each handshake (which is 2).\n\nSo, C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 8! / (2!6!) = (8*7*6!)/(2!6!) = (8*7)/(2*1) = 28\n\nTherefore, there will be 28 handshakes in total."
