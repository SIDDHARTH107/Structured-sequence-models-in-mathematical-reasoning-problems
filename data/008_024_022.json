    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate y from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the second equation by 2 and add it to the third equation.\n\n2 * (2x - y + 3z) = 2 * 7\n4x - 2y + 6z = 14\n\nNow, add this equation to the third equation:\n\n(4x - 2y + 6z) + (4x + y + 5z) = 14 + 13\n8x + 4z = 27\n2x + z = 27/4 (Divide by 4)\n\nNow, we will eliminate y from the first and second equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation.\n\n2 * (x + 2y - z) = 2 * 3\n2x + 4y - 2z = 6\n\nNow, subtract this equation from the second equation:\n\n(2x - y + 3z) - (2x + 4y - 2z) = 7 - 6\n-5y + 5z = 1\ny - z = -1/5 (Divide by 5)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n2x + z = 27/4\ny - z = -1/5\n\nWe can solve for z from the first equation:\n\nz = 27/4 - 2x\n\nNow, substitute this value of z into the second equation:\n\ny - (27/4 - 2x) = -1/5\ny - 27/4 + 2x = -1/5\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2x - 1/5 = y - 27/4\n10x - 1 = 5y - 27 (Multiply by 20)\n10x = 5y - 26\n2x = y - 26/5\n\nNow, substitute the value of y from the second equation:\n\n2x = (-1/5 + z) - 26/5\n10x = -1 + 5z - 26 (Multiply by 5)\n10x = 5z - 27\n2x = z - 27/5\n\nNow, we have two equations with the same variables:\n\n2x + z = 27/4\n2x = z - 27/5\n\nNow, we can equate the expressions for z:\n\n27/4 = 27/5 + 2x\n27/4 - 27/5 = 2x\n(135 - 108)/20 = 2x\n27/20 = x\n\nNow, substitute the value of x back into the equation for z:\n\nz = 27/4 - 2 * (27/20)\nz = 27/4 - 27/10\nz = (135 - 54)/20\nz = 81/20\n\nNow, substitute the value of z back into the equation for y:\n\ny = -1/5 + 81/20\ny = (-4 + 81)/20\ny = 77/20\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 27/20\ny = 77/20\nz = 81/20"
