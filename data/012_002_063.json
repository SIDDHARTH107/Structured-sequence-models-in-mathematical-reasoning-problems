    "message_2": "If all the vertices in the graph G are adjacent to each other, then the graph is a complete graph. A complete graph with 7 vertices is denoted as K7.\n\nThe chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nFor a complete graph, the chromatic number is equal to the number of vertices in the graph. This is because every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so each vertex must have a different color to ensure that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic number of the graph G with 7 vertices, where all vertices are adjacent to each other, is 7."
