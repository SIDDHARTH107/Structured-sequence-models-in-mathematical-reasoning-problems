    "message_2": "To find the probability of the player making exactly 7 free throws out of 10 attempts, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of making exactly k free throws\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of attempts (10 in this case)\n- k is the number of successful attempts (7 in this case)\n- p is the probability of success (0.6 in this case)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(10, 7), which is the number of ways to choose 7 successful attempts out of 10:\n\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7! * (10-7)!)\n          = 10! / (7! * 3!)\n          = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n          = 120\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 7) = 120 * (0.6)^7 * (1-0.6)^(10-7)\n         = 120 * (0.6)^7 * (0.4)^3\n         â‰ˆ 0.2149908\n\nSo, the probability that the player makes exactly 7 free throws out of 10 attempts is approximately 21.5%."
