    "message_2": "To find the value of r at which the period-doubling process reaches a period of 3 from 2, we need to analyze the bifurcation diagram of the logistic map given by the recursive equation:\n\n$x_{n+1}=rx_n(1-x_n)$\n\nThe bifurcation diagram shows the stable values of $x_n$ as a function of r. The period-doubling process occurs when the stable fixed points bifurcate into two, then four, then eight, and so on. The first bifurcation occurs at $r=3$, where the period goes from 1 to 2. We are interested in the next bifurcation, where the period goes from 2 to 3.\n\nTo find this value of r, we need to find the value at which the period-3 cycle becomes stable. We can do this by finding the fixed points of the logistic map and then analyzing their stability. The fixed points are the solutions to the equation:\n\n$x = rx(1-x)$\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n$x(1 - r + r x) = 0$\n\nThe fixed points are $x = 0$ and $x = \\frac{r-1}{r}$.\n\nTo analyze the stability of the fixed points, we need to find the derivative of the logistic map with respect to x:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(rx(1-x)) = r - 2rx$\n\nNow, we need to find the value of r for which the period-3 cycle becomes stable. This occurs when the absolute value of the derivative at the fixed point is equal to 1:\n\n$|r - 2r\\frac{r-1}{r}| = 1$\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\n$r - 2r^2 + 2r^3 = \\pm 1$\n\nThis is a difficult equation to solve analytically, but we can use numerical methods to find the approximate value of r. Using a numerical solver, we find that the value of r at which the period-doubling process reaches a period of 3 from 2 is approximately:\n\n$r \\approx 3.82843$\n\nSo, the value of r at which the doubling process of the period reaches 3 from 2 is approximately 3.82843."
