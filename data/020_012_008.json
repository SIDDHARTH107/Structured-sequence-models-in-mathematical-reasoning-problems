    "message_1": "A manufacturing company needs to optimize their production of a certain product to minimize costs. The cost function is given by C = 10x^2 + 200x + 500, where x is the number of units produced. What is the optimal number of units that the company should produce to minimize their costs?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal number of units to minimize the cost, we need to find the minimum point of the cost function. This can be done by taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero.\n\nThe cost function is C = 10x^2 + 200x + 500.\n\nFirst, find the derivative of the cost function with respect to x:\n\ndC/dx = 20x + 200\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n20x + 200 = 0\n\n20x = -200\n\nx = -200 / 20\n\nx = -10\n\nHowever, since it's not possible to produce a negative number of units, the optimal number of units to minimize cost must be 0. This means that the company should not produce any units of the product to minimize their costs."
