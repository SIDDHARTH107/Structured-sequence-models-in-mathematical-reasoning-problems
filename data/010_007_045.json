    "message_2": "To determine the fundamental group of S² \\ {p((1, 0, 0))}, we first need to understand the space we are working with. S² is the 2-dimensional sphere, and p((1, 0, 0)) is the projection of the point (1, 0, 0) from the unit sphere X onto S². So, S² \\ {p((1, 0, 0))} is the 2-dimensional sphere with one point removed.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the fundamental group of a space is invariant under deformation retraction. We can continuously deform S² \\ {p((1, 0, 0))} into a circle S¹ by pushing the remaining points of the sphere towards the equator. Since the fundamental group of the circle S¹ is isomorphic to the integers (Z), the fundamental group of S² \\ {p((1, 0, 0))} is also isomorphic to the integers (Z).\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of S² \\ {p((1, 0, 0))} is Z."
