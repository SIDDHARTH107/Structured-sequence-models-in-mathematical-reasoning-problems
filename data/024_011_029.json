    "message_2": "To find the Laplacian of the function f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 on the sphere S^2 of radius r, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the function with respect to x, y, and z. Then, we'll find the second partial derivatives and sum them up to get the Laplacian.\n\nThe first partial derivatives are:\n∂f/∂x = 2x\n∂f/∂y = 2y\n∂f/∂z = 2z\n\nNow, we find the second partial derivatives:\n∂²f/∂x² = 2\n∂²f/∂y² = 2\n∂²f/∂z² = 2\n\nThe Laplacian of a function is the sum of its second partial derivatives, so we have:\n\nΔf = ∂²f/∂x² + ∂²f/∂y² + ∂²f/∂z² = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n\nSo, the Laplacian of the function f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 on the sphere S^2 of radius r is 6."
