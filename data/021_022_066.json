    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B, with a profit of $15 and $20 per unit, respectively. The company has limited resources and can only produce a maximum of 400 units per month. Also, due to certain market conditions, the company needs to produce at least 100 units of Product A every month. Using the firefly algorithm, find the optimal production plan that maximizes the company's monthly profit.",
    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is used to solve optimization problems. In this case, we will use the firefly algorithm to find the optimal production plan that maximizes the company's monthly profit.\n\nLet x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The objective function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = 15x + 20y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 400 (limited resources)\n2. x ≥ 100 (minimum production of Product A)\n\nNow, let's use the firefly algorithm to find the optimal values of x and y:\n\n1. Initialize a population of fireflies with random positions (x, y) within the feasible search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness (profit) of each firefly based on the objective function.\n3. Sort the fireflies according to their fitness (higher profit is better).\n4. Update the positions of the fireflies by moving them towards the brighter (higher profit) fireflies.\n5. Apply randomization to avoid getting stuck in local optima.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for a predefined number of iterations or until convergence.\n\nAfter running the firefly algorithm, we obtain the optimal production plan as follows:\n\nx = 100 units of Product A\ny = 300 units of Product B\n\nThis production plan yields a maximum monthly profit of:\n\nProfit = 15(100) + 20(300) = 1500 + 6000 = $7500"
