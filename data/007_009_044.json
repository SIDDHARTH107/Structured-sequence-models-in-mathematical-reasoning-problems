    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, denoted as φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nTo find the value of φ(96), we first need to find the prime factorization of 96. \n\n96 = 2^5 * 3^1\n\nNow, we can use the formula for Euler's totient function:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nIn our case, we have two distinct prime factors: 2 and 3.\n\nφ(96) = 96 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3)\nφ(96) = 96 * (1/2) * (2/3)\nφ(96) = 48 * (2/3)\nφ(96) = 32\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for the number 96 is 32."
