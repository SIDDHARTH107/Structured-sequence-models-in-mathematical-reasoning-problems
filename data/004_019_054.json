    "message_1": "A hockey puck is sliding on an ice rink with position given by the function $s(t) = 3t^2-5t+2$ where $t$ is in seconds and $s$ is in meters. Find the velocity and acceleration of the puck at 2 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity and acceleration of the puck at 2 seconds, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the position function, $s(t)$.\n\nThe first derivative of $s(t)$ with respect to $t$ represents the velocity function, $v(t)$:\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(3t^2 - 5t + 2) = 6t - 5$\n\nThe second derivative of $s(t)$ with respect to $t$ represents the acceleration function, $a(t)$:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(3t^2 - 5t + 2) = \\frac{d}{dt}(6t - 5) = 6$\n\nNow, we can find the velocity and acceleration of the puck at $t = 2$ seconds:\n\n$v(2) = 6(2) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7$ meters per second\n\n$a(2) = 6$ meters per second squared\n\nSo, the velocity of the puck at 2 seconds is 7 meters per second, and the acceleration is 6 meters per second squared."
