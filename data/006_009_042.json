    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected person has the medical condition, we can simply divide the number of people with the medical condition by the total population.\n\nNumber of people with the medical condition = 5% of 10,000 = 0.05 * 10,000 = 500\n\nTotal population = 10,000\n\nProbability that a randomly selected person has the medical condition = 500 / 10,000 = 0.05 or 5%."
