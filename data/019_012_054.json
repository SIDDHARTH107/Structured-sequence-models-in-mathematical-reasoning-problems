    "message_1": "Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a numerical problem in Paraconsistent Logic since it deals with the study of inconsistent situations and contradictions. It is more about the study of reasoning with inconsistent information rather than solving numerical problems. \n\nHowever, I can provide a question related to Paraconsistent Logic that a math student can research and discuss: \n\n\"Explain how Paraconsistent Logic differs from classical logic and provide an example of where it could be applied in real-life situations.\"",
    "message_2": "Paraconsistent Logic differs from classical logic in the way it handles contradictions and inconsistencies. In classical logic, if a contradiction is found within a system, it leads to the principle of explosion, which means that any statement can be proven true. This is because, in classical logic, if a contradiction is found (e.g., A and not-A), then any statement B can be derived from it (A and not-A implies B). This principle is also known as \"ex contradictione quodlibet\" (from a contradiction, anything follows).\n\nParaconsistent Logic, on the other hand, aims to avoid the principle of explosion by allowing contradictions to coexist within a system without causing it to collapse. In Paraconsistent Logic, the presence of a contradiction does not automatically imply that every statement is true. Instead, it allows for reasoning with inconsistent information and drawing meaningful conclusions despite the presence of contradictions.\n\nA real-life example of where Paraconsistent Logic could be applied is in the field of law. In legal disputes, it is common for conflicting evidence and testimonies to be presented. Using classical logic, the presence of contradictions could lead to the conclusion that every possible outcome is true, which is not helpful in reaching a verdict. However, by applying Paraconsistent Logic, the legal system can acknowledge the existence of contradictions while still making a rational decision based on the available evidence. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of the case and a more just outcome."
