    "message_1": "A missile tracking system is being developed to intercept an incoming missile. The missile moves at a constant speed of 600 m/s and must be intercepted by the tracking system before it reaches the target. The tracking system takes 10 seconds to get activated and then can move with a maximum speed of 400 m/s. What is the shortest distance between the tracking system and the incoming missile at which the tracking system can be activated and still intercept the missile before it reaches the target? Assume that both the tracking system and the missile move along a straight line.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance between the tracking system and the incoming missile at the moment of activation as D. We need to find the shortest distance D such that the tracking system can intercept the missile before it reaches the target.\n\nDuring the 10 seconds it takes for the tracking system to activate, the missile will travel a distance of 600 m/s * 10 s = 6000 m. After activation, the tracking system will start moving towards the missile at a speed of 400 m/s.\n\nLet t be the time it takes for the tracking system to intercept the missile after activation. During this time, the missile will travel an additional distance of 600 m/s * t, and the tracking system will travel a distance of 400 m/s * t.\n\nSince the tracking system intercepts the missile, the total distance traveled by the missile and the tracking system must be equal:\n\nD + 6000 m + 600 m/s * t = 400 m/s * t\n\nNow we can solve for t:\n\n600 m/s * t - 400 m/s * t = D - 6000 m\n200 m/s * t = D - 6000 m\n\nt = (D - 6000 m) / 200 m/s\n\nNow, we need to find the shortest distance D such that the tracking system can intercept the missile. This will happen when the tracking system intercepts the missile just as it reaches the target. In other words, the time it takes for the tracking system to intercept the missile (t) must be equal to the time it takes for the missile to reach the target after activation.\n\nLet T be the time it takes for the missile to reach the target after activation. Then:\n\n600 m/s * T = D\n\nSubstituting the expression for t from above:\n\nT = (D - 6000 m) / 200 m/s\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for T and solve for D:\n\n600 m/s * ((D - 6000 m) / 200 m/s) = D\n3 * (D - 6000 m) = D\n3D - 18000 m = D\n2D = 18000 m\nD = 9000 m\n\nSo, the shortest distance between the tracking system and the incoming missile at which the tracking system can be activated and still intercept the missile before it reaches the target is 9000 meters."
