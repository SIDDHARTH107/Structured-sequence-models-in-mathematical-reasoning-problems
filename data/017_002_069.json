    "message_2": "Since G is a cyclic group generated by 7, we can write G = {1, 7, 7^2, 7^3, ...}. Now, H is a subgroup of G with order 3. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of H must divide the order of G. Let the order of G be n, then we have:\n\n3 | n\n\nSince 7 generates G, we know that 7^n = 1 (mod n). We are looking for an element in H that generates H, which means we need to find an element x in H such that x^3 = 1 (mod n).\n\nLet's consider the element 7^(n/3) (where n/3 is an integer). We have:\n\n(7^(n/3))^3 = 7^n = 1 (mod n)\n\nSo, 7^(n/3) is an element of H that generates H."
