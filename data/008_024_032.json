    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first two equations. We can do this by adding the second equation to the first equation:\n\n$$2x + y + z = 5$$\n$$+ (x - y - z = 0)$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 3x = 5$$\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n$$x = \\frac{5}{3}$$\n\nNext, let's eliminate z from the second and third equations. We can do this by adding the second equation to the third equation:\n\n$$x - y - z = 0$$\n$$+ (3x - y - z = 1)$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 4x - 2y = 1$$\n\nNow, substitute the value of x we found earlier:\n\n$$4\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right) - 2y = 1$$\n$$\\Rightarrow \\frac{20}{3} - 2y = 1$$\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\n$$2y = \\frac{20}{3} - 1$$\n$$2y = \\frac{17}{3}$$\n$$y = \\frac{17}{6}$$\n\nFinally, let's substitute the values of x and y into the second equation to solve for z:\n\n$$x - y - z = 0$$\n$$\\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{17}{6} - z = 0$$\n\nNow, solve for z:\n\n$$z = \\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{17}{6}$$\n$$z = \\frac{10}{6} - \\frac{17}{6}$$\n$$z = -\\frac{7}{6}$$\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is:\n\n$$x = \\frac{5}{3}, y = \\frac{17}{6}, z = -\\frac{7}{6}$$"
