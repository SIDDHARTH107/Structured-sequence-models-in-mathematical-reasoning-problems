    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of the parametrization r(u,v).\n\nru = dr/du = (∂r/∂u) = (cos(v), sin(v), 2/u)\nrv = dr/dv = (∂r/∂v) = (-u*sin(v), u*cos(v), 0)\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients of the first fundamental form (E, F, G).\n\nE = <ru, ru> = (cos(v))^2 + (sin(v))^2 + (2/u)^2 = 1 + 4/u^2\nF = <ru, rv> = -u*cos(v)*sin(v) + u*sin(v)*cos(v) = 0\nG = <rv, rv> = (-u*sin(v))^2 + (u*cos(v))^2 = u^2\n\nNext, we need to find the second derivatives of r(u,v).\n\nruu = d^2r/du^2 = (∂^2r/∂u^2) = (0, 0, -2/u^2)\nruv = d^2r/dudv = (∂^2r/∂u∂v) = (-sin(v), cos(v), 0)\nrvv = d^2r/dv^2 = (∂^2r/∂v^2) = (-u*cos(v), -u*sin(v), 0)\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients of the second fundamental form (L, M, N).\n\nL = <ruu, N> = -2/u^2\nM = <ruv, N> = 0\nN = <rvv, N> = -u*cos^2(v) - u*sin^2(v) = -u\n\nFinally, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,0,0), we have u = 1 and v = 0. So, let's evaluate the coefficients at this point.\n\nE = 1 + 4/1^2 = 5\nF = 0\nG = 1^2 = 1\nL = -2/1^2 = -2\nM = 0\nN = -1\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (-2*(-1) - 0^2) / (5*1 - 0^2) = 2/5\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point (1,0,0) is 2/5."
