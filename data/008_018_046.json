    "message_1": "A factory produces three types of products: chairs, tables, and cabinets. To produce one chair, two tables, and three cabinets requires 24 hours of work. To produce two chairs, one table and two cabinets requires 25 hours. To produce one chair, one table, and four cabinets requires 20 hours. Find the hours required to produce one chair, one table, and one cabinet.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the time required to produce one chair, y be the time required to produce one table, and z be the time required to produce one cabinet. We can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information:\n\n1x + 2y + 3z = 24 (1)\n2x + 1y + 2z = 25 (2)\n1x + 1y + 4z = 20 (3)\n\nWe can solve this system of linear equations using various methods, such as substitution, elimination, or matrices. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate y from equations (1) and (3) by subtracting equation (3) from equation (1):\n\n(1x + 2y + 3z) - (1x + 1y + 4z) = 24 - 20\ny - z = 4 (4)\n\nNext, we will eliminate y from equations (2) and (3) by subtracting equation (3) from equation (2):\n\n(2x + 1y + 2z) - (1x + 1y + 4z) = 25 - 20\nx - 2z = 5 (5)\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\ny - z = 4 (4)\nx - 2z = 5 (5)\n\nWe can solve for x in equation (5):\n\nx = 5 + 2z (6)\n\nNow substitute equation (6) into equation (4) to solve for z:\n\ny - z = 4\ny - (5 + 2z) = 4\ny - 5 - 2z = 4\n\nNow solve for y:\n\ny - 2z = 9 (7)\n\nNow we can substitute equation (6) back into equation (7) to solve for z:\n\n(5 + 2z) - 2z = 9\n5 = 9\n\nThis is not possible, so there is no solution for this system of linear equations. This means that there is no consistent relationship between the hours required to produce one chair, one table, and one cabinet based on the given information."
