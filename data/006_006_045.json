    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the free throw percentage)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of free throws)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of successful free throws)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 5 (the player takes 5 free throws)\n- k = 4 (we want to find the probability of making exactly 4 of the 5 shots)\n- p = 0.8 (the free throw percentage is 80%)\n\nFirst, let's find C(n, k), which is the number of combinations of 5 items taken 4 at a time:\n\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * (5-4)!)\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * 1!)\nC(5, 4) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (1))\nC(5, 4) = 120 / (24 * 1)\nC(5, 4) = 5\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * 0.8^4 * (1-0.8)^(5-4)\nP(X = 4) = 5 * 0.8^4 * 0.2^1\nP(X = 4) = 5 * 0.4096 * 0.2\nP(X = 4) = 5 * 0.08192\nP(X = 4) â‰ˆ 0.4096\n\nSo, the probability that the basketball player will make exactly 4 of the 5 free throws is approximately 40.96%."
