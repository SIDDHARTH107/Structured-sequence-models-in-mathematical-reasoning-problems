    "message_1": "A hospital has been tracking the survival times of patients with a particular disease. Out of 100 patients, 60 were treated with Drug A and 40 were treated with Drug B. After one year, 40 patients treated with Drug A and 28 patients treated with Drug B were still alive. Using Kaplan-Meier estimator, what is the probability that a patient treated with Drug A will survive for at least two years?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of survival for at least two years using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, we need information about the number of patients who survived and the number of patients at risk at each time point. However, the given information only provides data for one year. \n\nTo calculate the Kaplan-Meier estimator for two years, we would need the number of patients who survived and the number of patients at risk at the end of the second year. Without this information, it is not possible to calculate the probability that a patient treated with Drug A will survive for at least two years using the Kaplan-Meier estimator."
