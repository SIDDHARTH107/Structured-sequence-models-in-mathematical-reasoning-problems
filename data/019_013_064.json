    "message_2": "Let's denote the domain of 3 elements as {a, b, c}. Since we are working with second-order logic, we will consider functions that map pairs of elements from the domain to the domain itself. In other words, we have functions of the form f(x, y) where x, y âˆˆ {a, b, c}.\n\nThere are 3^3 = 27 possible mappings for each variable (x or y) since each of the 3 elements can be mapped to any of the 3 elements in the domain. However, since we have two variables, the total number of distinct functions is 27^2 = 729.\n\nSo, there are 729 distinct functions that can be defined using second-order logic with two variables and a domain of 3 elements."
