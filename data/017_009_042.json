    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9, we will show that G is generated by a single element, namely a.\n\nFirst, let's note that since G has order 9, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide 9. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 3, and 9.\n\nWe are given that a is an element of G with order 3 (since a^3 = e and a ≠ e). Now, let's consider the subgroup H generated by a, i.e., H = {e, a, a^2}. Since a has order 3, H has order 3 as well.\n\nNow, let's consider an element b in G that is not in H (if no such element exists, then G = H, which contradicts the fact that G has order 9). Since the order of b must divide 9, the possible orders of b are 1, 3, and 9. If the order of b is 1, then b = e, which contradicts our assumption that b is not in H. If the order of b is 3, then the subgroup generated by b, say K, has order 3 as well. In this case, we have two distinct subgroups H and K of order 3 in G.\n\nSince H and K are both subgroups of G with order 3, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of the product HK (the set of all products hk, where h ∈ H and k ∈ K) must divide the order of G, which is 9. However, since H and K are distinct, the product HK must have at least 3 * 3 = 9 elements. Therefore, the order of HK must be exactly 9, which implies that HK = G.\n\nNow, let's consider the element ab. We will show that ab has order 9, which means that G is generated by ab and is thus isomorphic to C9.\n\n(ab)^2 = a^2 * b^2\n(ab)^3 = a^3 * b^3 = e * b^3 = b^3\n(ab)^4 = a^4 * b^4 = a * b^4\n(ab)^5 = a^2 * b^5\n(ab)^6 = a^3 * b^6 = e * b^6 = b^6\n(ab)^7 = a^4 * b^7 = a * b^7\n(ab)^8 = a^2 * b^8\n(ab)^9 = a^3 * b^9 = e * b^9 = b^9\n\nSince the order of b divides 9, we know that b^9 = e. Therefore, (ab)^9 = e. Now, we need to show that (ab)^k ≠ e for any k < 9.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that (ab)^k = e for some k < 9. Then, a^k * b^k = e. Since a^3 = e, we can rewrite this as a^(k mod 3) * b^k = e. Since k < 9, k mod 3 can only be 0, 1, or 2. If k mod 3 = 0, then a^(k mod 3) = e, which implies that b^k = e. However, this contradicts the fact that b has order 3 or 9. If k mod 3 = 1 or 2, then a^(k mod 3) is an element of H. Therefore, e = a^(k mod 3) * b^k is an element of HK, which implies that b^k is an element of H. However, this contradicts our assumption that b is not in H.\n\nThus, there is no k < 9 such that (ab)^k = e, which means that ab has order 9. Since G = HK and G is generated by the element ab, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9."
