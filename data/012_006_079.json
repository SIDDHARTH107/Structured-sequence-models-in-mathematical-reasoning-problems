If it is Eulerian, find an Eulerian path. If it is Hamiltonian, find a Hamiltonian cycle. If it is neither, explain why.",
    "message_2": "A graph is Eulerian if it has an Eulerian cycle, which is a closed walk that visits every edge exactly once. A graph is Hamiltonian if it has a Hamiltonian cycle, which is a closed walk that visits every vertex exactly once.\n\nFirst, let's check if the graph is Eulerian. A connected graph is Eulerian if and only if every vertex has an even degree. The degrees of the vertices in the given graph are:\n\n1. Degree of A: 3\n2. Degree of B: 4\n3. Degree of C: 3\n4. Degree of D: 4\n5. Degree of E: 3\n6. Degree of F: 3\n7. Degree of G: 4\n\nSince vertices A, C, E, and F have odd degrees, the graph is not Eulerian.\n\nNow, let's check if the graph is Hamiltonian. Finding a Hamiltonian cycle can be challenging, but we can try to find one by trial and error. One possible Hamiltonian cycle is:\n\nA → B → D → G → C → F → E → A\n\nSo, the graph is Hamiltonian."
