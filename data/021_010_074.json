    "message_2": "To maximize the area of a rectangle with a given perimeter, we can use calculus and Newton's Method. Let's denote the length of the rectangle as x and the width as y. We know that the perimeter P is given by:\n\nP = 2x + 2y\n\nSince the perimeter is 30 meters, we have:\n\n30 = 2x + 2y\n\nNow, we want to maximize the area A of the rectangle, which is given by:\n\nA = xy\n\nWe can solve the perimeter equation for y:\n\ny = (30 - 2x) / 2 = 15 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the area equation:\n\nA(x) = x(15 - x) = 15x - x^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A(x) with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nA'(x) = 15 - 2x\n\nNow, set A'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 15 - 2x\n2x = 15\nx = 7.5\n\nNow, find the corresponding value of y using the expression we found earlier:\n\ny = 15 - x = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle that maximize the area are x = 7.5 meters and y = 7.5 meters. This is a square with side length 7.5 meters, which is expected since squares maximize area for a given perimeter."
