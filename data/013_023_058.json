    "message_1": "In a Trust Game scenario, Player A is given $10 and must decide how much to send to Player B. Whatever amount Player A sends will be tripled, and then Player B must decide how much of that tripled amount to return to Player A. If Player B returns 50% of the tripled amount to Player A, how much money will each player have at the end of the game?",
    "message_2": "Let's assume Player A sends x dollars to Player B. The amount will be tripled, so Player B will receive 3x dollars. Player B then returns 50% of the tripled amount to Player A, which is (1/2) * 3x = 3x/2 dollars.\n\nPlayer A initially had $10 and sent x dollars to Player B, so Player A has (10 - x) dollars left. After receiving 3x/2 dollars back from Player B, Player A's total amount will be:\n\n10 - x + 3x/2\n\nPlayer B received 3x dollars and returned 3x/2 dollars to Player A, so Player B's total amount will be:\n\n3x - 3x/2\n\nNow, we need to know the value of x to determine the exact amount each player has at the end of the game. However, since the problem does not specify how much Player A sends to Player B, we cannot determine the exact amounts. The final amounts for each player will depend on the value of x chosen by Player A."
