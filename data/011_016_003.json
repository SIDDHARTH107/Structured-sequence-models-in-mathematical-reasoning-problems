    "message_1": "A high school is organizing a field trip for 30 students. They want to divide the students into smaller groups to visit different exhibits. Each group should have exactly 5 students, and every student should visit exactly 2 exhibits. How many different ways are there to divide the students into groups and assign them to exhibits?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem into two parts: dividing the students into groups and assigning the groups to exhibits.\n\nFirst, we need to divide the 30 students into groups of 5. We can use the combination formula to find the number of ways to do this:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 30 (total number of students) and k = 5 (number of students in each group). So, we have:\n\nC(30, 5) = 30! / (5!(30-5)!) = 30! / (5!25!) = 142506\n\nNow, we have 6 groups (since 30 students divided into groups of 5 gives us 6 groups). We need to assign these groups to 2 exhibits. We can think of this as choosing 3 groups out of 6 to visit the first exhibit, and the remaining 3 groups will visit the second exhibit. We can use the combination formula again to find the number of ways to do this:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3!3!) = 20\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to divide the students into groups and assign them to exhibits, we multiply the number of ways to divide the students into groups (142506) by the number of ways to assign the groups to exhibits (20):\n\nTotal ways = 142506 * 20 = 2850120\n\nSo, there are 2,850,120 different ways to divide the students into groups and assign them to exhibits."
