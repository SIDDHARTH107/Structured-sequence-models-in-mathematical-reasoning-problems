    "message_2": "To determine the period and amplitude of the function f(x) = 4 sin(3x - π/6), we need to analyze the equation and compare it to the general form of a sinusoidal function, which is:\n\nf(x) = A sin(Bx - C)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our given function, f(x) = 4 sin(3x - π/6), we can identify the following:\n\nA = 4\nB = 3\n\nThe amplitude of the function is the absolute value of A, which is:\n\nAmplitude = |A| = |4| = 4\n\nTo find the period of the function, we use the formula:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |B|\n\nIn our case, B = 3, so the period is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |3| = (2π) / 3\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 4 sin(3x - π/6) is 4, and the period is (2π) / 3."
