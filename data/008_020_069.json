    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first and third equations. To do this, multiply the first equation by 5 and the third equation by 1:\n\n10x + 5y - 5z = 20\n3x - 2y + 5z = 1\n\nAdd the two equations:\n\n13x + 3y = 21 (1)\n\nNow, let's eliminate z from the first and second equations. To do this, multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1:\n\n4x + 2y - 2z = 8\n4x + 3y + 2z = 8\n\nAdd the two equations:\n\n8x + 5y = 16 (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n13x + 3y = 21 (1)\n8x + 5y = 16 (2)\n\nTo eliminate y, multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 3:\n\n65x + 15y = 105 (1)\n24x + 15y = 48 (2)\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n41x = 57\n\nDivide by 41:\n\nx = 57/41\n\nNow, substitute the value of x back into equation (1):\n\n13(57/41) + 3y = 21\n\nMultiply both sides by 41 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n13(57) + 3(41)y = 21(41)\n\n741 + 123y = 861\n\nSubtract 741 from both sides:\n\n123y = 120\n\nDivide by 123:\n\ny = 120/123\ny = 40/41\n\nNow, substitute the values of x and y back into the first original equation:\n\n2(57/41) + 40/41 - z = 4\n\nMultiply both sides by 41 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n2(57) + 40 - 41z = 4(41)\n\n114 + 40 - 41z = 164\n\nSubtract 114 and 40 from both sides:\n\n-41z = 10\n\nDivide by -41:\n\nz = -10/41\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 57/41\ny = 40/41\nz = -10/41"
