    "message_1": "A factory is producing 10,000 bottles of soda per day. The factory manager wants to estimate the average weight of each bottle. The manager selects a random sample of 100 bottles and weighs them. The mean weight of the sample is found to be 500 grams with a standard deviation of 10 grams. What is the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the soda bottles?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the soda bottles, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, t is the t-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95%), s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, x̄ = 500 grams, s = 10 grams, and n = 100.\n\nTo find the t-score, we need to use the t-distribution table. Since we want a 95% confidence interval and our sample size is 100, we will use a degrees of freedom (df) of 100 - 1 = 99. For a 95% confidence interval, the t-score is approximately 1.984 (you can find this value in a t-distribution table or using a calculator).\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nCI = 500 ± (1.984 * (10 / √100))\nCI = 500 ± (1.984 * (10 / 10))\nCI = 500 ± (1.984 * 1)\nCI = 500 ± 1.984\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the soda bottles is approximately 498.016 grams to 501.984 grams."
