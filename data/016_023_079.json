    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal can be found using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, N = 5 (since there are 5 smaller copies of the fractal in each iteration), and the scaling factor s = 3 (as each side of the square is divided into 3 equal parts).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension remains constant for all iterations of the fractal, so the dimension at the 5th iteration is also approximately 1.465."
