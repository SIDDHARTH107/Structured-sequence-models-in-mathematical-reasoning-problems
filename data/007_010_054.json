    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear congruences using the Chinese remainder theorem, we first need to find the product of the moduli, which in this case are 5 and 7. \n\nN = 5 * 7 = 35\n\nNext, we need to find the modular inverse of each modulus with respect to the other. Let's call these inverses M1 and M2. \n\nM1 = N1 * (N1_inv mod 7)\nM2 = N2 * (N2_inv mod 5)\n\nwhere N1 = N / 5 = 7 and N2 = N / 7 = 5.\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses N1_inv and N2_inv. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm for this.\n\nFor N1_inv (mod 7):\n7 * N1_inv ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n7 * N1_inv = 1 + 5k (for some integer k)\nN1_inv = 3 (since 7 * 3 = 21 = 1 + 5 * 4)\n\nFor N2_inv (mod 5):\n5 * N2_inv ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n5 * N2_inv = 1 + 7k (for some integer k)\nN2_inv = 3 (since 5 * 3 = 15 = 1 + 7 * 2)\n\nNow, we can find M1 and M2:\nM1 = 7 * 3 = 21\nM2 = 5 * 3 = 15\n\nFinally, we can find the solution x using the formula:\n\nx = (a1 * M1 + a2 * M2) mod N\n\nwhere a1 and a2 are the remainders from the original congruences (3 and 6, respectively).\n\nx = (3 * 21 + 6 * 15) mod 35\nx = (63 + 90) mod 35\nx = 153 mod 35\nx = 8\n\nSo the solution to the system of congruences is x ≡ 8 (mod 35)."
