    "message_2": "To prove that there exists exactly one set with no elements using second-order logic, we will use the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF) with the Axiom of Extensionality, the Axiom of Empty Set, and the Axiom Schema of Comprehension.\n\n1. Axiom of Extensionality: ∀A ∀B ( (∀x (x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B)) → A = B )\n2. Axiom of Empty Set: ∃A ∀x (¬(x ∈ A))\n3. Axiom Schema of Comprehension: ∀A ∃B ∀x (x ∈ B ↔ (x ∈ A ∧ P(x)))\n\nNow, we want to prove that there exists exactly one set with no elements, i.e., there exists a unique empty set.\n\nProof:\n\n(1) First, we show that there exists an empty set.\nBy the Axiom of Empty Set, we have ∃A ∀x (¬(x ∈ A)). Let's call this set A₀.\n\n(2) Next, we show that there can be only one empty set.\nAssume there are two empty sets A and B such that ∀x (¬(x ∈ A)) and ∀x (¬(x ∈ B)).\nNow, we want to show that A = B.\n\nBy the Axiom of Extensionality, we have:\n∀A ∀B ( (∀x (x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B)) → A = B )\n\nSo, we need to show that ∀x (x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B).\n\nLet x be an arbitrary element. Since A and B are both empty sets, we have ¬(x ∈ A) and ¬(x ∈ B). Thus, (x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B) is true for all x.\n\nTherefore, by the Axiom of Extensionality, A = B.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that there exists an empty set A₀, and any two empty sets A and B are equal. This proves that there exists exactly one set with no elements, i.e., there exists a unique empty set."
