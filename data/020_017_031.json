    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function on the closed interval [0, 4], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined. \n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval [0, 4]:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 6(0)^2 + 9(0) + 2 = 2\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 2 = 1 - 6 + 9 + 2 = 6\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 2 = 27 - 54 + 27 + 2 = 2\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 6(4)^2 + 9(4) + 2 = 64 - 96 + 36 + 2 = 6\n\nThe minimum value of the function on the interval [0, 4] occurs at x = 0 and x = 3, and the minimum value is f(0) = f(3) = 2."
