    "message_2": "Differential evolution is a population-based optimization algorithm that is used to find the global minimum of a function. To apply the differential evolution method to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 6, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of candidate solutions.\n2. Mutate and recombine the candidate solutions to generate new solutions.\n3. Evaluate the fitness of the new solutions and replace the old solutions if the new ones are better.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a desired level of accuracy).\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the differential evolution algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 + 5*x + 6\n\ndef differential_evolution(pop_size, bounds, max_iter, F, CR):\n    # Initialize the population\n    population = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=(pop_size, 1))\n\n    for i in range(max_iter):\n        new_population = np.copy(population)\n\n        for j in range(pop_size):\n            # Select three distinct individuals from the population\n            candidates = np.random.choice(np.delete(np.arange(pop_size), j), 3, replace=False)\n            a, b, c = population[candidates]\n\n            # Mutate and recombine\n            mutant = a + F * (b - c)\n            trial = population[j] if np.random.rand() > CR else mutant\n\n            # Evaluate the fitness and replace if the new solution is better\n            if f(trial) < f(population[j]):\n                new_population[j] = trial\n\n        population = new_population\n\n    # Find the best solution and its corresponding function value\n    best_solution = population[np.argmin(f(population))]\n    best_value = f(best_solution)\n\n    return best_solution, best_value\n\n# Parameters\npop_size = 50\nbounds = (-10, 10)\nmax_iter = 1000\nF = 0.8\nCR = 0.9\n\n# Run the differential evolution algorithm\nsolution, value = differential_evolution(pop_size, bounds, max_iter, F, CR)\nprint(\"Minimum value of the function: {:.4f} at x = {:.4f}\".format(value, solution[0]))\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum value of the function and the corresponding x value. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm. You can adjust the parameters (population size, bounds, maximum iterations, F, and CR) to improve the accuracy of the solution."
