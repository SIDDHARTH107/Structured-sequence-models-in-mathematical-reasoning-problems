    "message_1": "In a school quiz, there are 5 questions and each student is given a subset of 3 questions to solve. If there are 10 students in the quiz, how many different subsets of questions can be assigned so that each question is assigned to exactly 2 students?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the total number of ways to choose 3 questions out of 5. This can be calculated using combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!2!)\nC(5, 3) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1)(2 * 1))\nC(5, 3) = 120 / (6 * 2)\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 different subsets of 3 questions that can be chosen from the 5 questions.\n\nNow, we want each question to be assigned to exactly 2 students. Since there are 10 students and 5 questions, each question will be in 6 subsets (10 students / 5 questions * 2 students per question = 6 subsets per question).\n\nWe can represent this as a bipartite graph with 5 nodes on one side representing the questions and 10 nodes on the other side representing the students. We want to find the number of perfect matchings in this graph.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in combinatorics, and the solution can be found using the double factorial (n!!). For this problem, we have:\n\n(2n-1)!! = (2 * 5 - 1)!! = 9!!\n\n9!! = 9 * 7 * 5 * 3 * 1 = 945\n\nSo, there are 945 different ways to assign the subsets of questions to the students so that each question is assigned to exactly 2 students."
