    "message_2": "To find the number of injective functions from set A to set B, we can use the formula for counting the number of injective functions, which is:\n\nnumber of injective functions = |B|! / (|B| - |A|)!\n\nwhere |A| and |B| represent the cardinalities of sets A and B, respectively.\n\nIn this case, |A| = 2 and |B| = 3.\n\nnumber of injective functions = 3! / (3 - 2)!\n\nnumber of injective functions = 6 / 1\n\nnumber of injective functions = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 different injective functions from set A to set B in higher-order logic."
