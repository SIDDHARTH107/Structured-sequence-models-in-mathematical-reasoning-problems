They want to use a material that costs $5 per square meter for the bottom and $4 per square meter for the sides. What are the dimensions of the container that minimize the cost of materials? Also, the length of the container needs to be at least three times the height. Find the dimension of the container with the smallest cost.",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the container be x, the width be y, and the height be z. We are given that the volume of the container is 800 cubic meters, so:\n\nx * y * z = 800 (1)\n\nWe are also given that the length of the container needs to be at least three times the height:\n\nx >= 3z\n\nNow, let's find the cost function. The cost of the bottom is $5 per square meter, and the area of the bottom is x * y. The cost of the sides is $4 per square meter, and the combined area of the sides is 2xz + 2yz. So, the total cost C can be written as:\n\nC = 5xy + 4(2xz + 2yz) = 5xy + 8xz + 8yz\n\nWe want to minimize this cost function subject to the constraints given. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, let's rewrite constraint (1) as:\n\nz = 800 / (xy) (2)\n\nNow, we can substitute (2) into the cost function:\n\nC = 5xy + 8x(800 / (xy)) + 8y(800 / (xy)) = 5xy + 6400/x + 6400/y\n\nNow, we can find the partial derivatives of C with respect to x and y:\n\n∂C/∂x = 5y - 6400/x^2\n∂C/∂y = 5x - 6400/y^2\n\nNow, we can set these partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for x and y:\n\n5y = 6400/x^2\n5x = 6400/y^2\n\nNow, we can solve for y in terms of x:\n\ny = 1280/x^2\n\nSubstitute this back into constraint (1):\n\nx * (1280/x^2) * z = 800\nz = 800x^2 / 1280\nz = 5x^2 / 8\n\nNow, we can use the constraint x >= 3z to find the minimum dimensions:\n\nx >= 3(5x^2 / 8)\n8 <= 15x\nx >= 8/15\n\nSince x must be at least three times the height, we can use the smallest possible value for x:\n\nx = 8/15\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding values for y and z:\n\ny = 1280/x^2 = 1280/(64/225) = 225 * 20 = 4500\nz = 5x^2 / 8 = 5(64/225) / 8 = 320 / 225\n\nSo, the dimensions of the container that minimize the cost of materials are:\n\nLength (x) = 8/15 meters\nWidth (y) = 4500 meters\nHeight (z) = 320/225 meters"
