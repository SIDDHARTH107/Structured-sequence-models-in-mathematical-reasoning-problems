    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X=k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in a week), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (rain) on any given day, and (1-p) is the probability of failure (no rain) on any given day.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of exactly 3 rainy days in a week, so n=7 and k=3. The probability of rain on any given day is 30%, so p=0.30 and (1-p)=0.70.\n\nFirst, let's find C(n, k), which is the number of combinations of 7 items taken 3 at a time:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7-3)!)\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * 4!)\nC(7, 3) = 5040 / (6 * 24)\nC(7, 3) = 5040 / 144\nC(7, 3) = 35\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=3) = C(7, 3) * p^3 * (1-p)^(7-3)\nP(X=3) = 35 * (0.30)^3 * (0.70)^4\nP(X=3) = 35 * 0.027 * 0.2401\nP(X=3) = 35 * 0.006481\nP(X=3) â‰ˆ 0.2269\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain for exactly 3 days in a week is approximately 22.69%."
