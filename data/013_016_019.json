    "message_1": "A company offers its salesperson a salary of $40,000 per year plus a commission of 5% on any sales exceeding $200,000. If the salesperson makes total sales of $500,000 in a year, what would be their total compensation, including the salary and commission? How much of their compensation comes from the commission?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the total compensation, we first need to determine the amount of sales that are eligible for the 5% commission. Since the commission is only applied to sales exceeding $200,000, we subtract $200,000 from the total sales of $500,000:\n\n$500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000\n\nNow, we calculate the 5% commission on the $300,000:\n\n$300,000 * 0.05 = $15,000\n\nThe salesperson's total compensation is the sum of their base salary and the commission:\n\n$40,000 (base salary) + $15,000 (commission) = $55,000\n\nSo, their total compensation is $55,000, and the commission portion of their compensation is $15,000."
