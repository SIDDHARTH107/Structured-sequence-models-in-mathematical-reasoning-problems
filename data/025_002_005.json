    "message_2": "To find the intersection number $C \\cdot L$, we need to find the number of intersection points of the cubic curve $C$ and the line $L$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. We can do this by substituting the equation of the line $L$ into the equation of the curve $C$ and then solving for the remaining variables.\n\nSince $L: x = z$, we can substitute $z$ for $x$ in the equation of $C$:\n\n$y^2z = (z^3) - (z^3)$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$y^2z = 0$\n\nNow, we have two cases to consider:\n\n1) $y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\n2) $z = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$ (since $x = z$)\n\nFor case 1, if $y = 0$, then the equation of the curve $C$ becomes:\n\n$0 = x^3 - xz^2$\n\nSince $x = z$, we can substitute $z$ for $x$:\n\n$0 = z^3 - z^3$\n\nThis equation is true for any value of $z$, so we have a single intersection point at $[x:y:z] = [1:0:1]$.\n\nFor case 2, if $x = 0$, then the equation of the curve $C$ becomes:\n\n$y^2z = -z^3$\n\nSince $z \\neq 0$ (otherwise, we would have the point $[0:1:0]$ which is not on the line $L$), we can divide both sides of the equation by $z$:\n\n$y^2 = -z^2$\n\nThis equation has no solutions in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ since $y^2$ is always non-negative and $-z^2$ is always non-positive.\n\nThus, the intersection number $C \\cdot L$ is equal to the number of intersection points, which is 1."
