    "message_2": "To find the curvature K of the section through the points (1,0,1) and (0,1,1) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we first need to find the parametric representation of the curve on the surface.\n\nLet's consider a parameter t that varies from 0 to 1. We can write the parametric representation of the curve as:\n\nr(t) = (1-t)(1,0,1) + t(0,1,1) = (1-t, t, 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the first and second derivatives of r(t) with respect to t:\n\nr'(t) = (-1, 1, 0)\nr''(t) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nNow, we can find the curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nHowever, since r''(t) is a zero vector, the cross product r'(t) x r''(t) will also be a zero vector. Therefore, the curvature K will be:\n\nK = ||0|| / ||(-1, 1, 0)||^3 = 0 / sqrt(2)^3 = 0\n\nSo, the curvature K of the section through the points (1,0,1) and (0,1,1) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2 is 0."
