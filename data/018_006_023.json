Find the complement of A and then calculate the union of A and its complement. Show that the result of the union is equal to the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set X that are not in A. The complement of A, denoted as A', is:\n\nA' = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we need to calculate the union of A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements from both sets. In this case, the union of A and A' is:\n\nA âˆª A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nAs we can see, the result of the union is equal to the universal set U:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nThus, we have shown that the union of A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U."
