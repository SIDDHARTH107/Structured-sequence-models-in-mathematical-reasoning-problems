    "message_2": "To find the minimum of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3 using the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the function, which represents the gradient.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 2x + 2.\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent method with the given initial value x0 = 1 and step size 0.1.
