    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the system when the input is a sine wave with frequency 2Hz and amplitude 4, we first need to represent the input signal in the Laplace domain. The input signal is given by:\n\nx(t) = 4 * sin(2π * 2 * t)\n\nTaking the Laplace transform of the input signal, we get:\n\nX(s) = 4 * L{sin(4πt)} = 4 * (4π) / (s^2 + (4π)^2)\n\nNow, to find the output signal in the Laplace domain, we multiply the transfer function G(s) with the input signal X(s):\n\nY(s) = G(s) * X(s) = [(5s + 8) / (s^2 + 4s + 5)] * [(16π) / (s^2 + (4π)^2)]\n\nNext, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s) to get the output signal y(t) in the time domain. To do this, we can use partial fraction expansion:\n\nY(s) = A / (s^2 + 4s + 5) + B / (s^2 + (4π)^2)\n\nMultiplying both sides by the common denominator, we get:\n\n16π = A * (s^2 + (4π)^2) + B * (s^2 + 4s + 5)\n\nTo solve for A and B, we can use the following equations:\n\n1) For s = 0:\n16π = A * (4π)^2\nA = 1 / π\n\n2) For s = -4:\n16π = B * (-4)^2\nB = π\n\nNow, we can rewrite Y(s) as:\n\nY(s) = (1/π) / (s^2 + 4s + 5) + (π) / (s^2 + (4π)^2)\n\nTaking the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s), we get:\n\ny(t) = L^(-1){(1/π) / (s^2 + 4s + 5)} + L^(-1){(π) / (s^2 + (4π)^2)}\n\ny(t) = (1/π) * e^(-2t) * sin(t) + (π) * sin(4πt)\n\nThe steady-state response of the system is the second term of y(t), as the first term represents the transient response that decays over time:\n\ny_ss(t) = (π) * sin(4πt)\n\nSo, the steady-state response of the system when the input is a sine wave with frequency 2Hz and amplitude 4 is:\n\ny_ss(t) = π * sin(8πt)"
