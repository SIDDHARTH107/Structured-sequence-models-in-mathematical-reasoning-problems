    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between them). The maximum independent set is the largest such set.\n\nTo find the maximum independent set for this graph, we can use the fact that the sum of the size of a maximum independent set (denoted as α(G)) and the size of a minimum vertex cover (denoted as β(G)) is equal to the number of vertices in the graph (10 in this case). This is known as the Gallai's theorem:\n\nα(G) + β(G) = |V|\n\nA vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest such set.\n\nSince we have 10 vertices and 15 edges, we can use the following inequality to get an upper bound on the size of the minimum vertex cover:\n\nβ(G) ≤ 2 * E / V\n\nwhere E is the number of edges (15) and V is the number of vertices (10). This inequality comes from the fact that a matching (a set of non-adjacent edges) can be used to find a vertex cover by selecting one vertex from each edge in the matching. The size of the largest matching is at most half the number of vertices.\n\nβ(G) ≤ 2 * 15 / 10\nβ(G) ≤ 3\n\nNow, we can use Gallai's theorem to find the lower bound on the size of the maximum independent set:\n\nα(G) ≥ |V| - β(G)\nα(G) ≥ 10 - 3\nα(G) ≥ 7\n\nSince this is a lower bound, the maximum independent set could be larger. However, without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact size of the maximum independent set. The best we can say is that the maximum independent set for this graph has at least 7 vertices."
