Assuming that the temperature of the surroundings remains constant at 20°C, find the temperature distribution of the rod over time using the diffusion equation. The thermal conductivity of copper is 385 W/(m·K) and the density is 8,960 kg/m³. The specific heat capacity is 385 J/(kg·K). The initial temperature of the rod is 20°C.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution of the rod over time, we need to solve the heat diffusion equation. The heat diffusion equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∇²T\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and ∇² is the Laplacian operator. The thermal diffusivity (α) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nα = k / (ρ * c)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density, and c is the specific heat capacity. Plugging in the values for copper, we get:\n\nα = 385 W/(m·K) / (8960 kg/m³ * 385 J/(kg·K)) ≈ 1.11 * 10^(-4) m²/s\n\nSince the rod is a cylinder, we can use the cylindrical coordinate system to solve the heat diffusion equation. In this case, the Laplacian operator in cylindrical coordinates is given by:\n\n∇²T = (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂T/∂r)\n\nThe boundary and initial conditions for this problem are:\n\n1. T(r, 0) = 20°C (initial temperature)\n2. T(0.5 cm, t) = 100°C (temperature at the surface of the rod)\n3. T(0, t) is finite (temperature at the center of the rod)\n\nTo solve the heat diffusion equation with these boundary and initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as the product of two functions, one depending only on r and the other only on t:\n\nT(r, t) = R(r) * Θ(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat diffusion equation and dividing by T(r, t), we get:\n\n(1/Θ) ∂Θ/∂t = (1/(r * R)) ∂/∂r (r ∂R/∂r)\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on t and the right side depends only on r, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call -λ². Now we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. ∂Θ/∂t = -λ² * α * Θ\n2. ∂/∂r (r ∂R/∂r) = -λ² * r * R\n\nThe general solution to the first equation is:\n\nΘ(t) = A * exp(-λ² * α * t)\n\nwhere A is a constant.\n\nThe second equation is a Bessel's equation of order 0. The general solution is:\n\nR(r) = B * J₀(λ * r) + C * Y₀(λ * r)\n\nwhere B and C are constants, and J₀ and Y₀ are Bessel functions of the first and second kind of order 0, respectively.\n\nNow we apply the boundary and initial conditions:\n\n1. T(r, 0) = R(r) * Θ(0) = 20°C\n2. T(0.5 cm, t) = R(0.5 cm) * Θ(t) = 100°C\n3. T(0, t) = R(0) * Θ(t) is finite\n\nFrom the third condition, we know that C = 0 since Y₀(0) is not finite. So, the solution becomes:\n\nT(r, t) = R(r) * Θ(t) = (B * J₀(λ * r)) * (A * exp(-λ² * α * t))\n\nApplying the second condition, we get:\n\n100°C = B * J₀(λ * 0.5 cm) * A * exp(-λ² * α * t)\n\nSince this equation must hold for all times t, we can conclude that:\n\nB * J₀(λ * 0.5 cm) = 100°C\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvalues λ and the corresponding coefficients B. This can be done using the method of Fourier-Bessel series. The eigenvalues λ are the roots of the Bessel function J₀(λ * 0.5 cm) = 0. The coefficients B can be found using the orthogonality property of Bessel functions.\n\nFinally, the temperature distribution T(r, t) can be written as a sum of the product of Bessel functions and exponential functions:\n\nT(r, t) = 20°C + Σ [B_n * J₀(λ_n * r) * exp(-λ_n² * α * t)]\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all eigenvalues λ_n and their corresponding coefficients B_n.\n\nIn practice, the series converges quickly, and only a few terms are needed to obtain a good approximation of the temperature distribution. To find the exact values of λ_n and B_n, one can use numerical methods or consult tables of Bessel function zeros."
