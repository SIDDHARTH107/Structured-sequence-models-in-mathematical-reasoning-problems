    "message_1": "A committee of 9 people needs to be formed from a group of 12 candidates. If 4 of the candidates are from one region, 3 are from another region, and the remaining 5 are from a different region, how many ways can the committee be formed such that at least one representative is chosen from each region?",
    "message_2": "To ensure that at least one representative is chosen from each region, we can consider the different possible distributions of representatives from each region in the committee:\n\n1. 4 representatives from the first region, 2 from the second region, and 3 from the third region.\n2. 3 representatives from the first region, 3 from the second region, and 3 from the third region.\n3. 2 representatives from the first region, 3 from the second region, and 4 from the third region.\n\nNow, we will calculate the number of ways to form the committee for each distribution using combinations:\n\n1. For the first distribution (4, 2, 3):\n   - 4 representatives from the first region: C(4, 4) = 1 way\n   - 2 representatives from the second region: C(3, 2) = 3 ways\n   - 3 representatives from the third region: C(5, 3) = 10 ways\n   Total ways for this distribution: 1 * 3 * 10 = 30 ways\n\n2. For the second distribution (3, 3, 3):\n   - 3 representatives from the first region: C(4, 3) = 4 ways\n   - 3 representatives from the second region: C(3, 3) = 1 way\n   - 3 representatives from the third region: C(5, 3) = 10 ways\n   Total ways for this distribution: 4 * 1 * 10 = 40 ways\n\n3. For the third distribution (2, 3, 4):\n   - 2 representatives from the first region: C(4, 2) = 6 ways\n   - 3 representatives from the second region: C(3, 3) = 1 way\n   - 4 representatives from the third region: C(5, 4) = 5 ways\n   Total ways for this distribution: 6 * 1 * 5 = 30 ways\n\nFinally, we sum up the total ways for each distribution: 30 + 40 + 30 = 100 ways.\n\nSo, there are 100 ways to form the committee such that at least one representative is chosen from each region."
