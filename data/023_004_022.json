    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 1, we need to find its Fourier series representation first, since the function is periodic with period 2π. The Fourier series of a function f(x) with period 2π is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and they are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * 1] dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx)] dx from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx)] dx from -π to π\n\nLet's find the Fourier coefficients for f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 1.\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[3x^2 - 5x + 1] dx from -π to π\na_0 = (1/π) * [(x^3 - (5/2)x^2 + x)| from -π to π]\na_0 = (1/π) * [(π^3 - (5/2)π^2 + π) - (-π^3 - (5/2)π^2 - π)]\na_0 = (1/π) * (2π^3 - 2π)\na_0 = 2π^2 - 2\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[(3x^2 - 5x + 1) * cos(nx)] dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * [(3/(n^2))(cos(nx) - n*sin(nx)) - (5/n)(sin(nx) + x*cos(nx)) + x*sin(nx)] from -π to π\n\nSince cos(nx) is an even function and x^2*cos(nx) is also an even function, the integral of x^2*cos(nx) over the symmetric interval -π to π will be zero. Similarly, x*cos(nx) is an odd function, so the integral of x*cos(nx) over the symmetric interval -π to π will also be zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[(3x^2 - 5x + 1) * sin(nx)] dx from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-3/(n^2))(sin(nx) + n*cos(nx)) - (5/n)(cos(nx) - x*sin(nx)) - x*cos(nx)] from -π to π\n\nSince sin(nx) is an odd function and x^2*sin(nx) is an even function, the integral of x^2*sin(nx) over the symmetric interval -π to π will be zero. Similarly, x*sin(nx) is an odd function, so the integral of x*sin(nx) over the symmetric interval -π to π will also be zero. Therefore, b_n = 0 for all n.\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 1 is:\n\nf(x) = 2π^2 - 2\n\nSince the Fourier series representation is a constant function, its Fourier transform will be a Dirac delta function centered at the origin. Therefore, the Fourier transform of f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 1 is:\n\nF(ω) = (2π^2 - 2) * δ(ω)"
