    "message_2": "A group of order 27 has the prime factorization 3^3. According to the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 27. Let's denote this subgroup as P.\n\nCase 1: Cyclic group C27\n\nConsider the group Z27, the additive group of integers modulo 27. This group is cyclic, and its order is 27. It has a generator, say 1, such that every element in the group can be written as a power of the generator: {0, 1, 2, ..., 26}. The group operation is addition modulo 27. This group is abelian, and it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nCase 2: Non-abelian group of order 27\n\nConsider the group of upper triangular 3x3 matrices with 1's on the diagonal and elements from the field with 3 elements (Z3) in the upper triangle. This group is called the Heisenberg group over Z3, denoted as H(Z3). The group operation is matrix multiplication. The group has 27 elements, as there are 3 choices for each of the 3 upper triangular entries.\n\nTo show that H(Z3) is non-abelian, consider two matrices A and B:\n\nA = | 1 a 1 |\n    | 0 1 b |\n    | 0 0 1 |\n\nB = | 1 c 1 |\n    | 0 1 d |\n    | 0 0 1 |\n\nCompute the products AB and BA:\n\nAB = | 1 a+c 1+a |\n     | 0  1  b+d |\n     | 0  0   1  |\n\nBA = | 1 a+c 1+c |\n     | 0  1  b+d |\n     | 0  0   1  |\n\nSince AB ≠ BA when a ≠ 0 and c ≠ 0, the group H(Z3) is non-abelian.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWe have shown that there are at least two distinct groups of order 27: the cyclic group C27 and the non-abelian Heisenberg group H(Z3). Any group of order 27 is isomorphic to either C27 or H(Z3)."
