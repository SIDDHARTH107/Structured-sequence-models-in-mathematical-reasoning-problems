    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √(18), we need to find the prime factors of 18 and look for any pairs of the same factor.\n\n18 = 2 × 9\n9 = 3 × 3\n\nSo, 18 = 2 × 3 × 3\n\nNow, we can rewrite the radical expression as:\n\n√(18) = √(2 × 3 × 3)\n\nSince there is a pair of 3's, we can take one 3 out of the square root:\n\n√(18) = 3√(2)\n\nTherefore, the simplified radical expression is 3√(2)."
