    "message_1": "A certain type of computer system fails 3% of the time due to a specific technological issue. If a company has 50 identical computer systems, what is the probability that at least one of them will fail due to this technological issue?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability that at least one computer fails, we can find the probability that none of the computers fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single computer does not fail is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.\n\nFor 50 independent computer systems, the probability that none of them fail is (0.97)^50 ≈ 0.216.\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability that at least one computer fails:\n\n1 - 0.216 ≈ 0.784.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the 50 computer systems will fail due to this technological issue is approximately 78.4%."
