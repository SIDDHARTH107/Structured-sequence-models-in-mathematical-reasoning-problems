    "message_2": "Let C be a smooth projective curve of genus g, which is the intersection of two quadrics in P^3. Let p be a point on C, and let L be the line bundle on C given by the complete linear system |3p|. We want to find the dimension of the space of global sections of L, denoted by h^0(C, L).\n\nFirst, we need to find the degree of L. Since L is given by the complete linear system |3p|, the degree of L is 3 times the degree of the divisor associated with the point p. Since C is an intersection of two quadrics in P^3, it is a curve of degree 4. Therefore, the degree of L is 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nNext, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem, which states that for any line bundle L on a smooth projective curve C of genus g, we have:\n\nh^0(C, L) - h^1(C, L) = deg(L) + 1 - g\n\nWe want to find h^0(C, L), so we need to determine h^1(C, L). By Serre duality, we have:\n\nh^1(C, L) = h^0(C, K_C ⊗ L^(-1))\n\nwhere K_C is the canonical bundle on C. Since C is a curve of genus g, we have:\n\ndeg(K_C) = 2g - 2\n\nNow, we need to find the degree of K_C ⊗ L^(-1). Since L has degree 12, L^(-1) has degree -12. Therefore, we have:\n\ndeg(K_C ⊗ L^(-1)) = (2g - 2) - 12\n\nBy the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have:\n\nh^0(C, L) - h^0(C, K_C ⊗ L^(-1)) = 12 + 1 - g\n\nSince deg(K_C ⊗ L^(-1)) = (2g - 2) - 12, we know that h^0(C, K_C ⊗ L^(-1)) = 0 if (2g - 2) - 12 < 0, or g < 7. Therefore, for g < 7, we have:\n\nh^0(C, L) = 12 + 1 - g = 13 - g\n\nSo, the dimension of the space of global sections of the line bundle L in terms of the genus of the curve is:\n\nh^0(C, L) = 13 - g, for g < 7"
