    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line at point P(2, 0), we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2, and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^2 - 3x + 2)\n\nUsing the power rule and linearity of differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 3\n\nNow, we evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 2(2) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at point P(2, 0) is 1."
