    "message_2": "To find the solutions to the given homogeneous linear system of equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to reduce the system to its row echelon form. First, let's write the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  1 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 1  3  2 | 0 ]\n[ 4 -3  5 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top left corner:\n\n```\n[ 1  3  2 | 0 ]\n[ 2  1 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 4 -3  5 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Subtract 2 * Row 1 from Row 2 and 4 * Row 1 from Row 3 to eliminate the x terms in Rows 2 and 3:\n\n```\n[ 1  3  2 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -5 -5 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -15 -3 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by -5:\n\n```\n[ 1  3  2 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1  1 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -15 -3 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Add 3 * Row 2 to Row 1 and 15 * Row 2 to Row 3 to eliminate the y terms in Rows 1 and 3:\n\n```\n[ 1  0 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1  1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0 12 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 5: Divide Row 3 by 12:\n\n```\n[ 1  0 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1  1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 6: Add Row 3 to Row 1 and subtract Row 3 from Row 2 to eliminate the z terms in Rows 1 and 2:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  0 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1  0 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nThe resulting matrix corresponds to the system of equations:\n\nx = 0\ny = 0\nz = 0\n\nThus, the solution to the homogeneous linear system of equations is the trivial solution (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)."
