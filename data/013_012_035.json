    "message_1": "Consider a Stackelberg competition between two firms A and B. Firm A, as the leader, can set its output level first, followed by firm B. Suppose the inverse demand function is given by P = 100 - Q, and the cost functions of the two firms are C_A = 20Q_A and C_B = 10Q_B. Find the output level of each firm that maximizes its profit.",
    "message_2": "To find the output level of each firm that maximizes its profit, we first need to find the reaction function of firm B, which is the best response of firm B to any output level chosen by firm A. Then, we will find the optimal output level for firm A, knowing the reaction function of firm B.\n\n1. Find the reaction function of firm B:\nThe profit function of firm B is given by:\nΠ_B = P * Q_B - C_B\nΠ_B = (100 - Q) * Q_B - 10Q_B\nΠ_B = (100 - Q_A - Q_B) * Q_B - 10Q_B\n\nTo maximize its profit, firm B will choose Q_B such that the first-order condition (FOC) is satisfied:\ndΠ_B/dQ_B = 0\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to Q_B, we get:\ndΠ_B/dQ_B = 100 - Q_A - 2Q_B - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for Q_B, we get the reaction function of firm B:\nQ_B = (90 - Q_A) / 2\n\n2. Find the optimal output level for firm A:\nThe profit function of firm A is given by:\nΠ_A = P * Q_A - C_A\nΠ_A = (100 - Q) * Q_A - 20Q_A\nΠ_A = (100 - Q_A - Q_B) * Q_A - 20Q_A\n\nSubstitute the reaction function of firm B into the profit function of firm A:\nΠ_A = (100 - Q_A - (90 - Q_A) / 2) * Q_A - 20Q_A\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\nΠ_A = (10 + Q_A / 2) * Q_A - 20Q_A\n\nTo maximize its profit, firm A will choose Q_A such that the FOC is satisfied:\ndΠ_A/dQ_A = 0\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to Q_A, we get:\ndΠ_A/dQ_A = 10 + Q_A - 20 = 0\n\nSolving for Q_A, we get the optimal output level for firm A:\nQ_A = 10\n\n3. Find the optimal output level for firm B:\nUsing the reaction function of firm B, we can find the optimal output level for firm B:\nQ_B = (90 - Q_A) / 2\nQ_B = (90 - 10) / 2\nQ_B = 80 / 2\nQ_B = 40\n\nThus, the output level that maximizes the profit for firm A is 10, and for firm B is 40."
