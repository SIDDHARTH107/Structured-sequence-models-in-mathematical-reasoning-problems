    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of triangular faces after n iterations as T(n). Initially, T(0) = 4, since there are 4 triangular faces in the starting pyramid.\n\nIn each iteration, we remove the central pyramid from each of the triangular faces in the previous iteration, and this creates 3 new triangular faces for each face we remove. So, for each triangular face in the previous iteration, we end up with 2 new triangular faces after removing the central pyramid.\n\nThus, after the first iteration, we have T(1) = 4 * 2 = 8 triangular faces.\n\nIn general, after n iterations, we have:\n\nT(n) = 4 * 2^n\n\nSo, the total number of triangular faces in a Sierpinski pyramid after n iterations is 4 * 2^n."
