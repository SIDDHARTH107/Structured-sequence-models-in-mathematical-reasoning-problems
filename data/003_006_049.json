    "message_1": "Suppose you have a triangle with angle A measuring 45 degrees, side a measuring 10 units, and side b measuring 8 units. Use the law of sines to find the measure of angle B and the length of side c.",
    "message_2": "To use the Law of Sines, we first need to find the measure of angle A in radians. Since angle A is 45 degrees, we can convert it to radians by multiplying it by π/180:\n\nAngle A (in radians) = 45 * (π/180) = π/4\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Sines to find the measure of angle B:\n\n(sin B) / b = (sin A) / a\n\nWe know the values of a and b, and we have found the value of angle A in radians. So, we can plug in the values and solve for sin B:\n\n(sin B) / 8 = (sin (π/4)) / 10\n\n(sin B) / 8 = (√2 / 2) / 10\n\n(sin B) = 8 * (√2 / 2) / 10\n\n(sin B) = 4√2 / 10\n\nNow, we can find the measure of angle B by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of sin B:\n\nB = arcsin(4√2 / 10)\n\nB ≈ 0.927 radians\n\nTo convert angle B back to degrees, we can multiply it by 180/π:\n\nAngle B (in degrees) ≈ 0.927 * (180/π) ≈ 53.13 degrees\n\nNow that we have angle B, we can find angle C using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:\n\nAngle C = 180 - Angle A - Angle B\n\nAngle C ≈ 180 - 45 - 53.13 ≈ 81.87 degrees\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Sines again to find the length of side c:\n\n(sin C) / c = (sin A) / a\n\nWe need to convert angle C to radians:\n\nAngle C (in radians) ≈ 81.87 * (π/180) ≈ 1.429 radians\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for c:\n\n(sin 1.429) / c = (sin (π/4)) / 10\n\nc * (sin (π/4)) = 10 * (sin 1.429)\n\nc * (√2 / 2) = 10 * (sin 1.429)\n\nc = 20 * (sin 1.429) / √2\n\nc ≈ 20 * 0.987 / 1.414\n\nc ≈ 13.95 units\n\nSo, the measure of angle B is approximately 53.13 degrees, and the length of side c is approximately 13.95 units."
