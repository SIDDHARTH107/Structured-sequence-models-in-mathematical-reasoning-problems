    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation √(5x + 1) - 2 = 4, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the radical term.\nAdd 2 to both sides of the equation:\n\n√(5x + 1) = 6\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n(√(5x + 1))^2 = 6^2\n\n5x + 1 = 36\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nSubtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n5x = 35\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nx = 7\n\nSo, the value of x is 7."
