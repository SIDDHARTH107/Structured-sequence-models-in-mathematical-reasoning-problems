    "message_2": "To prove that E is trivial, we need to show that there exists a vector bundle isomorphism between E and S1 × R3. We will construct such an isomorphism using the continuous map f: E → R3.\n\nFirst, let's recall some definitions and properties:\n\n1. A vector bundle E over a base space B with fiber F is a space that locally looks like the product space B × F. In our case, B = S1 and F = R3.\n\n2. A continuous map f: E → R3 is given such that the restriction of f to each fiber is a linear transformation from R3 to R3.\n\n3. A vector bundle isomorphism between two vector bundles E and F over the same base space B is a homeomorphism φ: E → F such that the restriction of φ to each fiber is a linear isomorphism.\n\nNow, let's construct the desired isomorphism φ: E → S1 × R3.\n\nFor each point x in S1, let L_x: R3 → R3 be the linear transformation given by the restriction of f to the fiber over x. Since L_x is a linear transformation, it has an inverse L_x^(-1) (because L_x is an isomorphism between the fibers).\n\nDefine φ: E → S1 × R3 as follows. For each point (x, v) in E, where x is in S1 and v is in the fiber over x, set φ(x, v) = (x, L_x^(-1)(v)). Note that φ is well-defined because L_x^(-1) exists for each x in S1.\n\nWe claim that φ is a vector bundle isomorphism. To show this, we need to prove that φ is a homeomorphism and that the restriction of φ to each fiber is a linear isomorphism.\n\n1. φ is a homeomorphism:\n\nTo show that φ is a homeomorphism, we need to show that it is continuous, bijective, and has a continuous inverse.\n\n- Continuity: Since L_x^(-1) is a continuous function for each x in S1, φ is continuous as a composition of continuous functions.\n\n- Bijectivity: For each point (x, w) in S1 × R3, there exists a unique point (x, v) in E such that φ(x, v) = (x, L_x^(-1)(v)) = (x, w), namely v = L_x(w). This shows that φ is bijective.\n\n- Continuous inverse: Let φ^(-1): S1 × R3 → E be defined by φ^(-1)(x, w) = (x, L_x(w)). Since L_x is continuous for each x in S1, φ^(-1) is continuous.\n\nThus, φ is a homeomorphism.\n\n2. The restriction of φ to each fiber is a linear isomorphism:\n\nLet x be a point in S1, and let v and w be points in the fiber over x. Then, by the definition of φ,\n\nφ(x, v + w) = (x, L_x^(-1)(v + w)) = (x, L_x^(-1)(v) + L_x^(-1)(w)) = φ(x, v) + φ(x, w),\n\nand\n\nφ(x, cv) = (x, L_x^(-1)(cv)) = (x, cL_x^(-1)(v)) = cφ(x, v),\n\nwhere c is a scalar. This shows that the restriction of φ to each fiber is a linear isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, φ is a vector bundle isomorphism between E and S1 × R3, proving that E is trivial."
