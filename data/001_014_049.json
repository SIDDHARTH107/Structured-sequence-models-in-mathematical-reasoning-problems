    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we first need to break down each square root into its simplest form.\n\n√(8) can be written as √(2*2*2) = 2√(2)\n\n√(32) can be written as √(2*2*2*2*2) = 4√(2)\n\n√(50) can be written as √(2*5*5) = 5√(2)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n2√(2) + 4√(2) - 5√(2)\n\nNow, we can combine the terms with the same square root:\n\n(2 + 4 - 5)√(2) = 1√(2)\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n√(2)"
