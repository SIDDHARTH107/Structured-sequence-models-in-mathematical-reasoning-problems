    "message_1": "In a community of 500 people, there are 120 teenagers. If there is a social event happening this weekend and 70% of the teenagers attend, what is the probability that at least 75 teenagers will attend the event?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find out how many teenagers are expected to attend the event. \n\n70% of 120 teenagers = 0.7 * 120 = 84 teenagers\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that at least 75 teenagers will attend the event. Since 84 teenagers are expected to attend, which is more than 75, the probability of at least 75 teenagers attending the event is 100%.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for a more precise probability calculation using a statistical method like the binomial distribution, you would need more information such as the standard deviation or the probability of each teenager attending the event independently."
