    "message_1": "Suppose there are three individuals, A, B, and C, willing to buy a painting. Each individual has a different valuation for the painting: A values it at $500, B at $700, and C at $900. Design a mechanism that allocates the painting to the individual who values it the most and charges them their valuation price. How much does the winner of the auction pay?",
    "message_2": "We can use a sealed-bid, second-price auction (also known as a Vickrey auction) to allocate the painting to the individual who values it the most and charges them their valuation price.\n\nIn this mechanism, each individual submits a sealed bid with their valuation of the painting. The painting is then allocated to the highest bidder, and they pay the amount of the second-highest bid.\n\nIn this case, the bids are as follows:\n- A: $500\n- B: $700\n- C: $900\n\nSince C has the highest bid at $900, they win the auction. The second-highest bid is $700 from B, so C pays $700 for the painting."
