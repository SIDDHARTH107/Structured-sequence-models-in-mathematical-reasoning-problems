    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into six equilateral triangles and then find the area of one of those triangles and multiply it by six.\n\nThe formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is (side^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4. In this case, the side length is 8 cm.\n\nArea of one equilateral triangle = (8^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4 = (64 * sqrt(3)) / 4 = 16 * sqrt(3) square centimeters.\n\nSince there are six equilateral triangles in a hexagon, the total area of the hexagon is:\n\nArea of hexagon = 6 * (16 * sqrt(3)) = 96 * sqrt(3) square centimeters."
