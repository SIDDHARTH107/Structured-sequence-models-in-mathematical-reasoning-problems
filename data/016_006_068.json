    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nThe Barnsley fern is a fractal structure that can be generated using the following set of transformations:\n\n$F_1(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.16 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n$F_2(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.85 & 0.04 \\\\ -0.04 & 0.85 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1.6 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n$F_3(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.2 & -0.26 \\\\ 0.23 & 0.22 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1.6 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n$F_4(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.15 & 0.28 \\\\ 0.26 & 0.24 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0.44 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe first transformation simply scales the point $(x, y)$ to a much smaller size, while the other three transformations apply some linear transformations and translations. The Barnsley fern is created by repeatedly applying one of these transformations to an initial point, and plotting the resulting points.\n\nSuppose we start with the point $(0,0)$. After applying $N$ iterations of the transformation, how many points will have been plotted to create the Barnsley fern?\n\nLet's assume that we apply each of the four transformations with equal probability, so that each one is applied to one-fourth of the points on average.",
    "message_2": "Since we start with the point (0,0) and apply one of the four transformations to it, we will have 1 point plotted after the first iteration. For each subsequent iteration, we apply one of the four transformations to the point obtained in the previous iteration. Therefore, after each iteration, we will have one new point plotted.\n\nSo, after N iterations of the transformation, there will be N points plotted to create the Barnsley fern."
