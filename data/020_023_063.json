    "message_1": "A math student is trying to create an optimal stock portfolio using two stocks A and B. From historical data, it is known that stock A has an expected annual return of 10% with a standard deviation of 5%, while stock B has an expected annual return of 15% with a standard deviation of 10%. \n\nIf the student wants to allocate 40% of their portfolio to stock A, what percentage of their portfolio should be allocated to stock B to maximize the expected return while keeping the overall standard deviation below 8%?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the percentage of the portfolio allocated to stock A and y be the percentage allocated to stock B. Since the student wants to allocate 40% of their portfolio to stock A, we have x = 0.4. The remaining percentage of the portfolio will be allocated to stock B, so y = 1 - x = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio is given by the weighted average of the expected returns of the individual stocks:\n\nExpected return = x * (Expected return of A) + y * (Expected return of B)\n= 0.4 * 10% + 0.6 * 15%\n= 4% + 9%\n= 13%\n\nNow, we need to find the overall standard deviation of the portfolio. The formula for the standard deviation of a two-stock portfolio is:\n\nStandard deviation = √(x^2 * (Standard deviation of A)^2 + y^2 * (Standard deviation of B)^2 + 2 * x * y * Covariance(A, B))\n\nHowever, we don't have the covariance between stocks A and B. In order to proceed, we need to make an assumption about the correlation between the two stocks. If we assume that the stocks are uncorrelated (i.e., their correlation coefficient is 0), then the covariance term in the formula will be 0, and the formula simplifies to:\n\nStandard deviation = √(x^2 * (Standard deviation of A)^2 + y^2 * (Standard deviation of B)^2)\n\nPlugging in the values for x, y, and the standard deviations of stocks A and B, we get:\n\nStandard deviation = √(0.4^2 * (5%)^2 + 0.6^2 * (10%)^2)\n= √(0.16 * 0.0025 + 0.36 * 0.01)\n= √(0.0004 + 0.0036)\n= √(0.004)\n= 0.0632 or 6.32%\n\nSince the overall standard deviation of the portfolio is below the desired 8% threshold, the student should allocate 60% of their portfolio to stock B to maximize the expected return while keeping the overall standard deviation below 8%."
