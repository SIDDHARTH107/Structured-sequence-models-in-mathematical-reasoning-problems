    "message_1": "A student measures the angle of elevation to the top of a tree as 60 degrees. The student then walks 50 meters away from the tree along a level ground and measures the angle of elevation to the top of the tree as 30 degrees. What is the height of the tree in meters?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the tree as h meters, and the initial distance from the student to the tree as x meters. We can use the tangent function to set up two equations based on the angle of elevation and the height of the tree.\n\nFrom the first angle of elevation (60 degrees):\ntan(60) = h/x\n\nFrom the second angle of elevation (30 degrees):\ntan(30) = h/(x+50)\n\nNow, we can solve the system of equations. We know that tan(60) = √3 and tan(30) = 1/√3.\n\nEquation 1: h = x√3\nEquation 2: h = (x+50)/√3\n\nNow, we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx√3 = (x+50)/√3\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by √3:\n\nx(√3)^2 = (x+50)\n\nx(3) = x + 50\n\n3x - x = 50\n\n2x = 50\n\nx = 25\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can plug it back into either equation to find the height of the tree. We'll use Equation 1:\n\nh = x√3\nh = 25√3\n\nSo, the height of the tree is 25√3 meters."
