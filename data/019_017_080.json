    "message_2": "There is no model $\\mathcal{M}$ of $\\Theta$ because the two axioms are contradictory.\n\nThe first axiom states that for all elements x and y in the model, x is equal to y. This implies that there is only one element in the model. The second axiom states that there exist two elements x and y in the model such that x is not equal to y. This implies that there are at least two distinct elements in the model.\n\nThese two axioms cannot both be true in any model, as they lead to a contradiction. Therefore, there is no model $\\mathcal{M}$ of $\\Theta$, and the question of the cardinality of such a model is not applicable."
