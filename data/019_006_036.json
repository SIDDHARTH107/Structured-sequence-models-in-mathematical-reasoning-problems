    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but Deontic logic is a branch of philosophy that deals with moral obligation and permission, and is not typically associated with numerical problems or quantitative analysis. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise numerical problem related to this topic. Is there another topic within mathematics that I can assist you with?",
    "message_2": "Of course! Please provide a mathematical problem or topic you'd like assistance with, and I'll be happy to help."
