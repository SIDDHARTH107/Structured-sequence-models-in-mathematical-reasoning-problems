    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that is constructed by replacing each line segment with a specific pattern. In each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of (2√3)/3.\n\nTo find the total length of the curve after 4 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (Growth factor)^number of iterations\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit (the length of the line segment in the equilateral triangle), the growth factor is (2√3)/3, and the number of iterations is 4.\n\nLength = 1 * ((2√3)/3)^4\n\nLength ≈ 1 * (2.1547)^4\n\nLength ≈ 1 * 21.6563\n\nLength ≈ 21.6563 units\n\nSo, after 4 iterations, the total length of the Gosper curve is approximately 21.6563 units."
