    "message_2": "A group of order 25 has 25 elements. Since 25 is a prime number squared (25 = 5^2), there are two possible structures for a group of order 25, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups:\n\n1. A cyclic group: This group has one element that generates the entire group. In this case, the group is isomorphic to the additive group of integers modulo 25, denoted as Z_25 or C_25. It has the structure Z_25 = {0, 1, 2, ..., 24} with addition modulo 25 as the group operation.\n\n2. A direct product of two smaller cyclic groups: This group can be expressed as the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, denoted as Z_5 × Z_5 or C_5 × C_5. It has the structure {(a, b) | a, b ∈ Z_5}, with component-wise addition modulo 5 as the group operation.\n\nThese are the only two possible structures for a group of order 25, and both are Abelian."
