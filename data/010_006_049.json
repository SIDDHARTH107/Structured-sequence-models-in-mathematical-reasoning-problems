    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of X, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The theorem states that if a topological space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected sets A and B, both containing the basepoint x0, and their intersection A ∩ B is also path-connected, then the fundamental group of X, denoted π₁(X, x0), can be computed as follows:\n\nπ₁(X, x0) ≅ π₁(A, x0) * π₁(B, x0) / N\n\nwhere * denotes the free product of groups, and N is the normal subgroup generated by elements of the form i_A(γ) * i_B(γ)^(-1) for all loops γ in A ∩ B, with i_A and i_B being the inclusion maps of A ∩ B into A and B, respectively.\n\nLet A be the open set containing the unit circle S¹ with a small open neighborhood around it, and B be the open set containing the unit interval [0,1] on the x-axis with a small open neighborhood around it. The basepoint x0 can be chosen as the point (1,0). The intersection A ∩ B is an open interval around the point (1,0).\n\nNow, we can compute the fundamental groups of A, B, and A ∩ B:\n\n1. π₁(A, x0) ≅ π₁(S¹, x0) ≅ Z, where Z is the group of integers. This is because the fundamental group of the unit circle is isomorphic to the group of integers, with each integer representing the winding number of a loop around the circle.\n\n2. π₁(B, x0) is trivial, as B is contractible to the unit interval [0,1], which is simply connected.\n\n3. π₁(A ∩ B, x0) is also trivial, as A ∩ B is an open interval and is simply connected.\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem:\n\nπ₁(X, x0) ≅ π₁(A, x0) * π₁(B, x0) / N ≅ Z * {e} / {e} ≅ Z\n\nwhere e is the identity element, and N is trivial since both π₁(B, x0) and π₁(A ∩ B, x0) are trivial.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of X is isomorphic to the group of integers, π₁(X, x0) ≅ Z."
