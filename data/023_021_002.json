    "message_2": "To determine the Fourier transform of the electric field along the length of the coaxial cable, we first need to find the electric field distribution inside the cable. For a coaxial cable, the electric field is confined between the inner and outer conductors and is radially directed. The electric field can be expressed as:\n\nE(r) = E0 * (r / a) for a < r < b,\n\nwhere E0 is the amplitude of the electric field, r is the radial distance from the center of the cable, a is the radius of the inner conductor, and b is the radius of the outer conductor.\n\nNow, let's convert the given diameters to radii:\n\na = 1.5 mm / 2 = 0.75 mm = 0.00075 m\nb = 5 mm / 2 = 2.5 mm = 0.0025 m\n\nThe Fourier transform of the electric field E(r) is given by:\n\nF(E(r)) = ∫[E(r) * e^(-j * k * r)] dr,\n\nwhere F(E(r)) is the Fourier transform of the electric field, j is the imaginary unit, and k is the wave number, which is related to the frequency f by:\n\nk = 2 * π * f / c,\n\nwhere c is the speed of light in vacuum (approximately 3 * 10^8 m/s).\n\nFor the given frequency of 1 GHz, we have:\n\nf = 1 * 10^9 Hz\nk = 2 * π * (1 * 10^9) / (3 * 10^8) = 20.94 * π rad/m\n\nNow, we can compute the Fourier transform of the electric field:\n\nF(E(r)) = ∫[E0 * (r / a) * e^(-j * 20.94 * π * r)] dr from r = a to r = b\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = r / a and dv = e^(-j * 20.94 * π * r) dr\n\nThen, du = (1 / a) dr and v = (-j / (20.94 * π)) * e^(-j * 20.94 * π * r)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\nF(E(r)) = E0 * [(-j * r * e^(-j * 20.94 * π * r) / (20.94 * π * a)) | from r = a to r = b - ∫(-j * e^(-j * 20.94 * π * r) / (20.94 * π * a)) dr from r = a to r = b]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\nF(E(r)) = E0 * [(-j * r * e^(-j * 20.94 * π * r) / (20.94 * π * a)) | from r = a to r = b + (j^2 / (20.94 * π * a)) * ∫ e^(-j * 20.94 * π * r) dr from r = a to r = b]\n\nThe remaining integral can be solved as:\n\n∫ e^(-j * 20.94 * π * r) dr = (-j / (20.94 * π)) * e^(-j * 20.94 * π * r) | from r = a to r = b\n\nPlugging this back into the expression for F(E(r)):\n\nF(E(r)) = E0 * [(-j * r * e^(-j * 20.94 * π * r) / (20.94 * π * a)) | from r = a to r = b + (j / (20.94 * π * a)) * (-j / (20.94 * π)) * e^(-j * 20.94 * π * r) | from r = a to r = b]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the expression at the limits:\n\nF(E(r)) = E0 * [(-j * b * e^(-j * 20.94 * π * b) / (20.94 * π * a)) - (-j * a * e^(-j * 20.94 * π * a) / (20.94 * π * a)) + (j / (20.94 * π * a)) * (-j / (20.94 * π)) * (e^(-j * 20.94 * π * b) - e^(-j * 20.94 * π * a))]\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the electric field along the length of the coaxial cable at a frequency of 1 GHz. Note that the result depends on the amplitude E0 of the electric field, which is not given in the problem."
