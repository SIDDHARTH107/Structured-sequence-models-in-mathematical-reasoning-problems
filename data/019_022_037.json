    "message_2": "To determine which job offer to accept based on expected value, we need to calculate the expected value for each job.\n\nJob A has a fixed salary of $50,000 per year, so its expected value is simply $50,000.\n\nFor Job B, we need to calculate the expected value based on the probabilities of earning each salary:\n\nExpected Value (Job B) = (0.5 * $50,000) + (0.5 * $45,000)\nExpected Value (Job B) = ($25,000) + ($22,500)\nExpected Value (Job B) = $47,500\n\nComparing the expected values of both jobs:\n\nExpected Value (Job A) = $50,000\nExpected Value (Job B) = $47,500\n\nBased on decision theory and expected value, you should accept Job A, as it has a higher expected value of $50,000 compared to Job B's expected value of $47,500."
