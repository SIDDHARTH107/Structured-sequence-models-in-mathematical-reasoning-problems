    "message_1": "Consider a three-dimensional torus, which is formed by identifying opposite faces of a cube. Let T denote this torus. Now, let J be the set of all smooth maps from the closed interval [0,1] to T that send the endpoints to the same point in T. Define the action functional E : J → R by\n\nE(u) = ∫₀¹ ‖∂u/∂t + J(u) ◦ (u)‖²dt\n\nwhere J(u) is a certain tensor determined by the equation of the torus T. Find the critical points of E and the corresponding critical values.",
    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the action functional E, we need to find the maps u(t) that satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation for E. The Euler-Lagrange equation is given by:\n\nd/dt (∂L/∂(∂u/∂t)) - ∂L/∂u = 0\n\nwhere L is the integrand of E, i.e., L(u, ∂u/∂t) = ‖∂u/∂t + J(u) ◦ (u)‖².\n\nFirst, let's compute the derivatives of L with respect to u and ∂u/∂t:\n\n∂L/∂(∂u/∂t) = 2(∂u/∂t + J(u) ◦ (u)) (1)\n∂L/∂u = 2(∂u/∂t + J(u) ◦ (u)) ∂(J(u) ◦ (u))/∂u (2)\n\nNow, let's compute the time derivative of ∂L/∂(∂u/∂t):\n\nd/dt (∂L/∂(∂u/∂t)) = 2 d/dt (∂u/∂t + J(u) ◦ (u)) (3)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n\nd/dt (∂u/∂t + J(u) ◦ (u)) = ∂²u/∂t² + d/dt (J(u) ◦ (u)) (4)\n\nNow, we can plug equations (1), (2), and (3) into the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\n2(∂²u/∂t² + d/dt (J(u) ◦ (u))) - 2(∂u/∂t + J(u) ◦ (u)) ∂(J(u) ◦ (u))/∂u = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n∂²u/∂t² + d/dt (J(u) ◦ (u)) = (∂u/∂t + J(u) ◦ (u)) ∂(J(u) ◦ (u))/∂u (5)\n\nThis is a second-order partial differential equation (PDE) for u(t). The critical points of E are the solutions u(t) that satisfy this PDE, along with the boundary conditions u(0) = u(1).\n\nTo find the corresponding critical values, we need to evaluate the action functional E at the critical points u(t). This involves computing the integral:\n\nE(u) = ∫₀¹ ‖∂u/∂t + J(u) ◦ (u)‖²dt\n\nfor the critical points u(t) that satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation and the boundary conditions.\n\nIn general, solving the PDE (5) and computing the critical values of E is a challenging task that depends on the specific form of the tensor J(u) and the equation of the torus T. However, the procedure outlined above provides a general framework for finding the critical points and critical values of the action functional E for a three-dimensional torus."
