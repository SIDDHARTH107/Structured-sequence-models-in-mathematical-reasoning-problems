    "message_1": "Suppose a game of chance involves rolling two fair six-sided dice. What is the probability of rolling a total of 7, given that one of the dice rolled is not a 2?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the event that the total is 7, and B be the event that one of the dice rolled is not a 2. We want to find the probability P(A|B).\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of A and B occurring together, which is P(A∩B). There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice (6 faces on the first die and 6 faces on the second die). To get a total of 7, the possible outcomes are (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), and (6, 1). However, since one of the dice rolled is not a 2, we need to remove the outcomes (2, 5) and (5, 2). This leaves us with 4 favorable outcomes: (1, 6), (3, 4), (4, 3), and (6, 1). So, P(A∩B) = 4/36 = 1/9.\n\nNext, let's find the probability of B, which is P(one of the dice rolled is not a 2). There are 5 faces on each die that are not a 2 (1, 3, 4, 5, and 6). So, there are 5 possible outcomes on the first die and 5 possible outcomes on the second die that are not a 2. However, we need to subtract the case where both dice are not a 2, which is counted twice. There are 4 faces on each die that are not a 2 and not equal to the other die (1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, excluding the face that is equal to the other die). So, there are 4 possible outcomes on the first die and 4 possible outcomes on the second die that are not a 2 and not equal to the other die. Therefore, P(B) = (5 × 5 + 4 × 4) / 36 = (25 + 16) / 36 = 41/36.\n\nNow, we can find the probability P(A|B) using the formula P(A|B) = P(A∩B) / P(B):\n\nP(A|B) = (1/9) / (41/36) = (1/9) × (36/41) = 4/41.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a total of 7, given that one of the dice rolled is not a 2, is 4/41."
