    "message_2": "To solve the rational equation (2x-1)/(x+3) = 5/2, we will first eliminate the denominators by cross-multiplying.\n\n(2x - 1)(2) = (x + 3)(5)\n\nNow, distribute the numbers on both sides of the equation:\n\n4x - 2 = 5x + 15\n\nNext, we will isolate the variable x by moving all the x terms to one side and the constants to the other side:\n\n4x - 5x = 15 + 2\n\n-1x = 17\n\nNow, divide by -1 to solve for x:\n\nx = -17"
