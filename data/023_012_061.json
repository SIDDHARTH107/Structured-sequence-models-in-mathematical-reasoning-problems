    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of f(x), we first need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the following general Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the sum is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function (f(-x) = -f(x)), all the a_n coefficients will be zero. Therefore, we only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe formulas for the coefficients are:\n\na_0 = (1 / (2π)) * ∫[f(x) * cos(0 * x)] dx from -π to π (which is 0 for odd functions)\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)] dx from -π to π (which is 0 for odd functions)\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x)] dx from -π to π\n\nLet's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [∫[sin(n * x)] dx from -π to 0 + ∫[-sin(n * x)] dx from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(1 / n) * (cos(n * x)) from -π to 0 - (1 / n) * (cos(n * x)) from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(1 / n) * (cos(0) - cos(-n * π)) - (1 / n) * (cos(n * π) - cos(0))]\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(1 / n) * (1 - cos(-n * π)) - (1 / n) * (cos(n * π) - 1)]\n\nFor even values of n, cos(n * π) = 1, and for odd values of n, cos(n * π) = -1. Therefore, b_n = 0 for even values of n, and for odd values of n:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(1 / n) * (1 - (-1)) - (1 / n) * (-1 - 1)]\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(1 / n) * 2 - (1 / n) * (-2)]\nb_n = (1 / π) * (4 / n)\n\nSo, the Fourier series for f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(4 / (π * n)) * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the sum is from n = 1 to infinity, and n takes only odd values."
