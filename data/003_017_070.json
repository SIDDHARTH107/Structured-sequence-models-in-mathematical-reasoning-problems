    "message_2": "To find the average value of a function over an interval, we use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function f(x) = 2sin(2x) and the interval is [0, π/2]. So, a = 0 and b = π/2.\n\nAverage value = (1/(π/2 - 0)) * ∫[0, π/2] 2sin(2x) dx\n\nAverage value = (2/π) * ∫[0, π/2] 2sin(2x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of 2sin(2x) with respect to x:\n\n∫2sin(2x) dx = -cos(2x) + C (using integration by substitution)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the bounds of the interval:\n\n[-cos(2x)](0 to π/2) = -cos(2(π/2)) - (-cos(2(0)))\n\n= -cos(π) - (-cos(0))\n\n= -(-1) - (1)\n\n= 1 + 1\n\n= 2\n\nNow, we can find the average value:\n\nAverage value = (2/π) * 2\n\nAverage value = 4/π\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 2sin(2x) over the interval [0, π/2] is 4/π."
