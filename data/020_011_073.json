    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two types of products, A and B. The company can produce a maximum of 500 units of product A and 300 units of product B per day. The cost of producing one unit of product A is $6 and the cost of producing one unit of product B is $8. The selling price of product A is $15 per unit and the selling price of product B is $20 per unit. The company wants to maximize their profit. Find the optimal number of units of product A and B that should be produced per day.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal number of units of product A and B that should be produced per day. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe profit function can be defined as:\n\nProfit = (Selling Price of A - Cost of A) * x + (Selling Price of B - Cost of B) * y\n\nProfit = (15 - 6) * x + (20 - 8) * y\nProfit = 9x + 12y\n\nWe have two constraints:\n\n1. The company can produce a maximum of 500 units of product A per day:\nx ≤ 500\n\n2. The company can produce a maximum of 300 units of product B per day:\ny ≤ 300\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the profit function, subject to these constraints.\n\nTo do this, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region. Then, we can find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the profit function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the following inequalities:\n\nx ≤ 500\ny ≤ 300\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\n\n1. (0, 0)\n2. (500, 0)\n3. (0, 300)\n4. (500, 300)\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. Profit(0, 0) = 9(0) + 12(0) = 0\n2. Profit(500, 0) = 9(500) + 12(0) = 4500\n3. Profit(0, 300) = 9(0) + 12(300) = 3600\n4. Profit(500, 300) = 9(500) + 12(300) = 8100\n\nHowever, the fourth vertex (500, 300) is not within the feasible region, as it exceeds the maximum production capacity for both products A and B. Therefore, we can disregard this option.\n\nComparing the profit values, we can see that the maximum profit is achieved when producing 500 units of product A and 0 units of product B, with a profit of $4,500 per day."
