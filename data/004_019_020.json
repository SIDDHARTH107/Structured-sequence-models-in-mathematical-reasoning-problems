    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car, we need to find the first derivative of the position function $s(t)$ with respect to time $t$. \n\n$s(t) = 4t^3 - 15t^2 - 6t + 10$\n\n$s'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(4t^3 - 15t^2 - 6t + 10)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n$s'(t) = 12t^2 - 30t - 6$\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity after $2$ seconds. We do this by plugging in $t=2$ into the velocity function:\n\n$s'(2) = 12(2)^2 - 30(2) - 6 = 12(4) - 60 - 6 = 48 - 60 - 6 = -18$\n\nSo, the velocity of the car after $2$ seconds is $-18$ m/s.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the car. To do this, we find the second derivative of the position function $s(t)$ with respect to time $t$:\n\n$s''(t) = \\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(4t^3 - 15t^2 - 6t + 10)$\n\nDifferentiating the velocity function $s'(t)$, we get:\n\n$s''(t) = 24t - 30$\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration after $2$ seconds. We do this by plugging in $t=2$ into the acceleration function:\n\n$s''(2) = 24(2) - 30 = 48 - 30 = 18$\n\nSo, the acceleration of the car after $2$ seconds is $18$ m/s².\n\nIn summary, the velocity of the car after $2$ seconds is $-18$ m/s, and the acceleration is $18$ m/s²."
