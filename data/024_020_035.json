    "message_2": "First, we need to note that the point (1, 2, 2) does not lie on the manifold M, as 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9 ≠ 1. To find the image of this point under the Hopf map, we first need to project it onto the manifold M. We can do this by normalizing the point to have a unit length:\n\n(1, 2, 2) / ||(1, 2, 2)|| = (1, 2, 2) / √9 = (1/3, 2/3, 2/3)\n\nNow that we have the point (1/3, 2/3, 2/3) on the manifold M, we can apply the Hopf map H. The Hopf map is defined as:\n\nH(x, y, z) = (x^2 - y^2 - z^2, 2(xy - wz), 2(xz + wy))\n\nwhere w is the fourth coordinate in the quaternion representation of the point (x, y, z) on M. Since we are working with ℝ^3, we can set w = 0. Now, we can apply the Hopf map to the point (1/3, 2/3, 2/3):\n\nH(1/3, 2/3, 2/3) = ((1/3)^2 - (2/3)^2 - (2/3)^2, 2((1/3)(2/3) - 0), 2((1/3)(2/3) + 0))\n                 = (-1/3, 4/9, 4/9)\n\nSo, the image of the point (1, 2, 2) under the Hopf map is (-1/3, 4/9, 4/9)."
