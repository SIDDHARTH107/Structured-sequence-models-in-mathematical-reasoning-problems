    "message_1": "A tank with height 2 meters is filled with water. The tank has two holes located at a height of 1 meter and 1.5 meters with radii of 0.05 meters and 0.03 meters, respectively. Assuming water flows out of the holes with velocity proportional to the square root of the height of water above the hole, use Navier-Stokes equations to find the time it takes to empty the tank completely. The viscosity of water is 0.001 Pa·s and the density of water is 1000 kg/m³.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Torricelli's law, which states that the speed of efflux of a fluid under the force of gravity through an orifice is v = sqrt(2gh), where v is the velocity of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²), and h is the height of the fluid above the orifice.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the two holes:\nA1 = πr1² = π(0.05)² = 0.00785 m²\nA2 = πr2² = π(0.03)² = 0.00283 m²\n\nNow, let's find the initial velocities of the water flowing out of the holes:\nv1 = sqrt(2gh1) = sqrt(2 * 9.81 * 1) = 4.43 m/s\nv2 = sqrt(2gh2) = sqrt(2 * 9.81 * 0.5) = 3.13 m/s\n\nThe initial volumetric flow rates are:\nQ1 = A1 * v1 = 0.00785 * 4.43 = 0.0347 m³/s\nQ2 = A2 * v2 = 0.00283 * 3.13 = 0.00886 m³/s\n\nThe total initial volumetric flow rate is:\nQ_total = Q1 + Q2 = 0.0347 + 0.00886 = 0.04356 m³/s\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the tank. Assuming it is a cylindrical tank, we can find the volume by:\nV = πr²h\nSince we don't have the radius of the tank, we can express the volume in terms of the height of the water:\nV = A_h * h\nwhere A_h is the area of the water surface.\n\nAs the water flows out, the height of the water decreases. We can express the height as a function of time:\nh(t) = 2 - k * t\nwhere k is a constant that we need to find.\n\nThe volumetric flow rate is also a function of time:\nQ(t) = A_h * dh(t)/dt\n\nDifferentiating h(t) with respect to time, we get:\ndh(t)/dt = -k\n\nNow, we can find the constant k:\nk = Q_total / A_h = 0.04356 / A_h\n\nThe volume of the tank as a function of time is:\nV(t) = A_h * h(t) = A_h * (2 - k * t)\n\nWhen the tank is empty, V(t) = 0. So, we can find the time it takes to empty the tank:\n0 = A_h * (2 - k * t)\nt = 2 / k\n\nSubstituting the value of k, we get:\nt = 2 / (0.04356 / A_h) = 2 * A_h / 0.04356\n\nSince we don't have the value of A_h, we cannot find the exact time it takes to empty the tank. However, we have expressed the time in terms of the area of the water surface, which can be used to find the time for a specific tank."
