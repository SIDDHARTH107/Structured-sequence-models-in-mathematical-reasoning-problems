    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is independent of the stage and is a constant value. To find the Hausdorff dimension, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor set, at each stage, the line segment is divided into 3 equal parts, and the middle third is removed, leaving 2 parts. So, N = 2 and the scaling factor s = 3.\n\nHence, the Hausdorff dimension (D) = log(2) / log(3) â‰ˆ 0.6309.\n\nSo, the exact Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set of stage 4 (or any stage) is log(2) / log(3)."
