    "message_2": "There are six non-abelian groups of order 32, which are as follows:\n\n1. Q32: Quaternion group of order 32\n2. D16 × Z2: Direct product of dihedral group of order 16 and cyclic group of order 2\n3. Q16 × Z2: Direct product of quaternion group of order 16 and cyclic group of order 2\n4. (Z4 × Z4) ⋊ Z2: Semidirect product of the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2\n5. (Z2 × Z2 × Z2) ⋊ Z4: Semidirect product of the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 4\n6. (Z2 × Z2) ⋊ Z8: Semidirect product of the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 8\n\nThese non-abelian groups differ from the cyclic group C32 and the dihedral group D16 in terms of their structure and properties as follows:\n\nC32: The cyclic group of order 32 is an abelian group, meaning that the group operation is commutative. It has a single generator, and all of its elements can be expressed as powers of that generator. It has a simple structure and is easy to work with.\n\nD16: The dihedral group of order 16 is also an abelian group, but it has a more complex structure than C32. It is the group of symmetries of a regular 8-gon, including rotations and reflections. It has two generators, one for rotations and one for reflections, and its elements can be expressed as products of these generators.\n\nThe six non-abelian groups of order 32 listed above have more complex structures than C32 and D16. They are not commutative, meaning that the group operation is not always commutative. This makes them more challenging to work with and analyze. Their structures involve various combinations of direct and semidirect products of smaller groups, which can lead to interesting properties and interactions between the constituent groups."
