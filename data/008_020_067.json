    "message_2": "To solve this system of equations using the matrix method, we first need to write the system in matrix form. The matrix form of the system is AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of unknowns, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3 -2 |\n    | 4  1 |\n    | 5 -3 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = |  5  |\n    | -2  |\n    |  4  |\n\nSince there are more equations than unknowns, this system is overdetermined, and it may not have a unique solution. We can try to find a least squares solution by solving the normal equations, which are given by A^T * A * X = A^T * B.\n\nFirst, let's find A^T (the transpose of A):\n\nA^T = | 3  4  5 |\n      | -2 1 -3 |\n\nNow, let's find A^T * A:\n\nA^T * A = | 3  4  5 |   | 3 -2 |   | 50  -1 |\n          |-2  1 -3 | * | 4  1 | = | -1  14 |\n\nAnd A^T * B:\n\nA^T * B = | 3  4  5 |   |  5  |\n          |-2  1 -3 | * | -2  | = |  1  |\n                            |  4  |   | -8  |\n\nNow we have a new system of equations:\n\n50x - y = 1\n-x + 14y = -8\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the inverse matrix method. First, we need to find the determinant of the matrix A^T * A:\n\ndet(A^T * A) = (50)(14) - (-1)(-1) = 700 - 1 = 699\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A^T * A exists. Now, let's find the inverse:\n\n(A^T * A)^(-1) = (1/det) * adj(A^T * A)\n\nadj(A^T * A) = |  14  1 |\n               |  1  50 |\n\n(A^T * A)^(-1) = (1/699) * |  14  1  |\n                             |  1  50  |\n\nNow, we can find the least squares solution X by multiplying (A^T * A)^(-1) by A^T * B:\n\nX = (A^T * A)^(-1) * A^T * B = (1/699) * |  14  1  | * |  1  |\n                                            |  1  50  |   | -8  |\n\nX = (1/699) * | 14 - 8 |\n              | 1 - 400 |\n\nX = |  6/699  |\n    | -399/699|\n\nX = |  2/233  |\n    | -133/233|\n\nSo, the least squares solution for this overdetermined system is approximately x = 2/233 and y = -133/233."
