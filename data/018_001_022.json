    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set ∅ is a subset of A, we need to show that every element of ∅ is also an element of A. By definition, the empty set ∅ contains no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in ∅ that we need to check for membership in A.\n\nSince there are no elements in ∅ to check, it is vacuously true that every element of ∅ is also an element of A. Thus, the empty set ∅ is a subset of A."
