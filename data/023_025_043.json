    "message_2": "First, let's find the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = x on the interval -π to π. The Fourier series of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = a0/2 + Σ[an*cos(n*x) + bn*sin(n*x)]\n\nwhere the coefficients an and bn are given by:\n\nan = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n*x) dx\nbn = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n*x) dx\n\nFor f(x) = x, we have:\n\na0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x dx = 0 (since the integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero)\n\nan = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(n*x) dx = 0 (for the same reason as above)\n\nbn = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(n*x) dx\n\nTo find bn, we can integrate by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(n*x) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(n*x)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\nbn = (1/π) * [-x*(1/n)*cos(n*x) | (-π, π) - ∫[-π, π] -(1/n)*cos(n*x) dx]\n\nThe first term in the brackets is zero (since x is odd and cos(n*x) is even), and the second term is:\n\nbn = (1/nπ) * ∫[-π, π] cos(n*x) dx = (2/n) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) (for n odd)\n\nSo the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x is:\n\nf(x) = Σ[ (2/n) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) * sin(n*x) ] for n odd\n\nNow, let's analyze the thermal properties of the material. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = k(x) * ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t. We are given the heat conductivity function k(x) = 2 + 3sin(x). To solve the heat equation, we can use the Fourier series representation of T(x,t) and k(x):\n\nT(x,t) = Σ[ Tn(t) * sin(n*x) ]\nk(x) = 2 + Σ[ Kn * sin(n*x) ] with K1 = 3\n\nPlugging these representations into the heat equation and comparing coefficients, we get a set of ordinary differential equations for Tn(t):\n\ndTn/dt = (2 + Kn) * n² * Tn\n\nThe initial condition is given by the temperature profile at t=0:\n\nT(x,0) = 500 - 200 * (x/π) = Σ[ Tn(0) * sin(n*x) ]\n\nComparing coefficients, we find that Tn(0) = (2/n) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) * 200/π (for n odd).\n\nNow, we can solve the ODEs for Tn(t) using the initial conditions:\n\nTn(t) = Tn(0) * exp((2 + Kn) * n² * t)\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature profile after 10 minutes (600 seconds) of heating:\n\nT(x,600) = Σ[ Tn(600) * sin(n*x) ]\n\nT(x,600) = Σ[ ((2/n) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) * 200/π) * exp((2 + Kn) * n² * 600) * sin(n*x) ] for n odd\n\nThis is the temperature profile of the material after 10 minutes of heating from the surface. Note that the series converges slowly, so in practice, you would need to compute many terms to get an accurate result."
