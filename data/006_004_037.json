    "message_1": "In a game of chance, the probability of winning is 0.25. If Jane plays the game 20 times, what is the probability that she will win at least 5 times?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of Jane winning at least 5 times, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (wins) in n trials (games)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (winning) in a single trial (game)\n- n is the number of trials (games)\n- k is the number of successes (wins)\n\nIn this case, n = 20 (number of games), p = 0.25 (probability of winning), and we want to find the probability of winning at least 5 times, so we need to calculate the probabilities for k = 5, 6, ..., 20 and sum them up.\n\nHowever, it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event (winning 4 or fewer times) and subtract it from 1. So, we'll calculate the probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and sum them up. Then, we'll subtract this sum from 1 to get the probability of winning at least 5 times.\n\nP(at least 5 wins) = 1 - P(0 wins) - P(1 win) - P(2 wins) - P(3 wins) - P(4 wins)\n\nCalculating the probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4:\n\nP(0 wins) = C(20, 0) * (0.25)^0 * (0.75)^20 ≈ 0.000003\nP(1 win) = C(20, 1) * (0.25)^1 * (0.75)^19 ≈ 0.000041\nP(2 wins) = C(20, 2) * (0.25)^2 * (0.75)^18 ≈ 0.000284\nP(3 wins) = C(20, 3) * (0.25)^3 * (0.75)^17 ≈ 0.001272\nP(4 wins) = C(20, 4) * (0.25)^4 * (0.75)^16 ≈ 0.004026\n\nNow, summing up these probabilities:\n\nP(4 or fewer wins) ≈ 0.000003 + 0.000041 + 0.000284 + 0.001272 + 0.004026 ≈ 0.005626\n\nFinally, subtracting this sum from 1:\n\nP(at least 5 wins) ≈ 1 - 0.005626 ≈ 0.994374\n\nSo, the probability that Jane will win at least 5 times in 20 games is approximately 0.994374 or 99.44%."
