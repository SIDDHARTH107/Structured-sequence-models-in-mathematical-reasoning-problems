    "message_2": "Given the prime numbers p = 11 and q = 7, we first need to calculate n and φ(n):\n\nn = p * q = 11 * 7 = 77\n\nφ(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1) = (11 - 1)(7 - 1) = 10 * 6 = 60\n\nNow, we need to find an integer e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1. Let's choose e = 13, as it is a prime number and gcd(13, 60) = 1.\n\nNext, we need to find the corresponding value of d such that (e * d) mod φ(n) = 1:\n\n(e * d) mod φ(n) = (13 * d) mod 60 = 1\n\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of e:\n\ne = 13\nφ(n) = 60\n\nApplying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n1. 60 = 4 * 13 + 8\n2. 13 = 1 * 8 + 5\n3. 8 = 1 * 5 + 3\n4. 5 = 1 * 3 + 2\n5. 3 = 1 * 2 + 1\n\nNow, working our way back up:\n\n1. 1 = 3 - 1 * 2\n2. 1 = 3 - 1 * (5 - 1 * 3)\n3. 1 = 2 * 3 - 1 * 5\n4. 1 = 2 * (8 - 1 * 5) - 1 * 5\n5. 1 = 2 * 8 - 3 * 5\n6. 1 = 2 * 8 - 3 * (13 - 1 * 8)\n7. 1 = 5 * 8 - 3 * 13\n\nFrom the last equation, we can see that d = -3. However, we need a positive value for d. To find it, we can add φ(n) to -3:\n\nd = -3 + 60 = 57\n\nSo, the corresponding value of d is 57."
