    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2^(x+1) = 32, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Rewrite the equation as 2^(x+1) = 2^5, since 32 is equal to 2 raised to the power of 5.\n2. Since the bases are equal (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other: x+1 = 5.\n3. Solve for x: x = 5 - 1.\n4. x = 4.\n\nSo, the value of x in the equation 2^(x+1) = 32 is x = 4."
