    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we will first find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator is the product of the two denominators, (x+2) and (3x-2). \n\nNow, we will rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:\n\n[(3x-1)(3x-2) + (2x+3)(x+2)] / [(x+2)(3x-2)] = 3/2\n\nNow, we will cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions:\n\n2[(3x-1)(3x-2) + (2x+3)(x+2)] = 3(x+2)(3x-2)\n\nNow, we will expand the expressions:\n\n2[9x^2 - 6x - 3x + 2 + 2x^2 + 4x + 3x + 6] = 3[3x^2 - 2x + 9x - 4]\n\n2[11x^2 - 5x + 8] = 3[3x^2 + 7x - 4]\n\nNow, we will expand the expressions again:\n\n22x^2 - 10x + 16 = 9x^2 + 21x - 12\n\nNow, we will move all the terms to one side of the equation:\n\n22x^2 - 9x^2 - 10x - 21x + 16 + 12 = 0\n\n13x^2 - 31x + 28 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (31 ± √((-31)^2 - 4(13)(28))) / (2 * 13)\n\nx = (31 ± √(961 - 1456)) / 26\n\nx = (31 ± √(-495)) / 26\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. The equation has complex solutions, but we will not explore those in this context."
