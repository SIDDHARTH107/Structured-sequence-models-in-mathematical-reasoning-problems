    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 2x + 9, we will first find the derivative of each term with respect to x, and then evaluate the derivative at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^4)/dx - d(8x^3)/dx + d(6x^2)/dx - d(2x)/dx + d(9)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule (d(x^n)/dx = nx^(n-1)):\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 24x^2 + 12x - 2\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 12(2)^3 - 24(2)^2 + 12(2) - 2\nf'(2) = 12(8) - 24(4) + 24 - 2\nf'(2) = 96 - 96 + 24 - 2\nf'(2) = 22\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 2x + 9 at x = 2 is 22."
