    "message_1": "A message is encrypted using a transposition cipher, where the key is the permutation (2 4 5 1 3). The original message had 20 characters. What is the length of the cipher text?",
    "message_2": "The length of the cipher text will be the same as the length of the original message. In a transposition cipher, the characters are rearranged according to a specific pattern (in this case, the permutation (2 4 5 1 3)), but no characters are added or removed. Therefore, the length of the cipher text is also 20 characters."
