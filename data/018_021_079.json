    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection and symmetric difference of sets A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5} (elements common to both A and B)\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 6, 7} (elements in A or B, but not in both)\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∩ B) and (A Δ B):\n\n(A ∩ B) Δ (A Δ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (elements in (A ∩ B) or (A Δ B), but not in both)\n\nNow, let's verify if the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection. The distributive property states that:\n\nA Δ (B ∩ C) = (A Δ B) ∩ (A Δ C)\n\nTo check this, let's find the symmetric difference of A with the intersection of B and C, where C is an arbitrary set. Let C = {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}.\n\nB ∩ C = {3, 4} (elements common to both B and C)\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A with (B ∩ C):\n\nA Δ (B ∩ C) = {1, 2, 5, 3, 4} (elements in A or (B ∩ C), but not in both)\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A with B and A with C:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 6, 7} (as calculated earlier)\n\nA Δ C = {1, 5, 8, 9} (elements in A or C, but not in both)\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A Δ B) and (A Δ C):\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ (A Δ C) = {1, 2} (elements common to both (A Δ B) and (A Δ C))\n\nWe can see that A Δ (B ∩ C) ≠ (A Δ B) ∩ (A Δ C) since {1, 2, 5, 3, 4} ≠ {1, 2}. Therefore, the symmetric difference is not distributive over intersection."
