The number of customers who preferred each of the three types of laptops are given below:\n\nBasic: 50 customers\nAdvanced: 75 customers\nProfessional: 100 customers\n\nUsing cluster analysis, create two clusters of customers who have similar laptop preferences, with the constraint that each cluster should contain at least 60 customers.",
    "message_2": "To create two clusters of customers with similar laptop preferences and with at least 60 customers in each cluster, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of customers: 50 (Basic) + 75 (Advanced) + 100 (Professional) = 225 customers.\n\n2. Since each cluster must have at least 60 customers, we can start by dividing the customers into two clusters based on their preferences for Basic and Advanced laptops, and Advanced and Professional laptops.\n\nCluster 1: Basic and Advanced laptop preferences\n- Basic: 50 customers\n- Advanced: 75 customers\n- Total: 125 customers\n\nCluster 2: Advanced and Professional laptop preferences\n- Advanced: 75 customers\n- Professional: 100 customers\n- Total: 175 customers\n\nHowever, we notice that there is an overlap of customers who prefer Advanced laptops in both clusters. To resolve this, we can divide the customers who prefer Advanced laptops equally between the two clusters.\n\n3. Divide the Advanced laptop customers equally between the two clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Basic and Advanced laptop preferences\n- Basic: 50 customers\n- Advanced: 37 customers (half of 75, rounded down)\n- Total: 87 customers\n\nCluster 2: Advanced and Professional laptop preferences\n- Advanced: 38 customers (half of 75, rounded up)\n- Professional: 100 customers\n- Total: 138 customers\n\nNow, we have two clusters of customers with similar laptop preferences, and each cluster contains at least 60 customers:\n\nCluster 1: 87 customers who prefer Basic and Advanced laptops\nCluster 2: 138 customers who prefer Advanced and Professional laptops"
