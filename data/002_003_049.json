    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the surface area of the cube, we need to find the area of one face and then multiply it by 6.\n\nThe area of a square is side length squared. In this case, the side length is 6 cm.\n\nArea of one face = side length^2 = 6^2 = 36 square centimeters\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one face by the number of faces (6) to find the total surface area of the cube.\n\nSurface area of the cube = 6 * 36 = 216 square centimeters"
