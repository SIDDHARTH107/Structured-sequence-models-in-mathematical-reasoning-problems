    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation y'' + 4y = sin(3t) with initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0 using the Fourier transform method, follow these steps:\n\n1. Take the Fourier transform of both sides of the differential equation:\n\nFourier{y''(t) + 4y(t)} = Fourier{sin(3t)}\n\n2. Apply the Fourier transform properties to the left side of the equation:\n\nFourier{y''(t)} + 4*Fourier{y(t)} = (s^2)Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0) + 4Y(s) = s^2Y(s) - s + 4Y(s)\n\n3. Take the Fourier transform of sin(3t) on the right side of the equation:\n\nFourier{sin(3t)} = Im{1/(s - 3i)} - Im{1/(s + 3i)} = (3/(s^2 + 9))\n\n4. Now, equate the Fourier transforms of both sides:\n\ns^2Y(s) - s + 4Y(s) = 3/(s^2 + 9)\n\n5. Solve for Y(s):\n\nY(s) = (s - 3) / ((s^2 + 4)(s^2 + 9))\n\n6. Perform the inverse Fourier transform to find y(t):\n\ny(t) = InverseFourier{Y(s)}\n\ny(t) = InverseFourier{(s - 3) / ((s^2 + 4)(s^2 + 9))}\n\n7. Use partial fraction decomposition to simplify the expression:\n\nY(s) = A / (s^2 + 4) + B / (s^2 + 9) + C / (s + 3i) + D / (s - 3i)\n\n8. Solve for A, B, C, and D:\n\nA = 1/5, B = -1/5, C = -1/10 - 3/10i, D = -1/10 + 3/10i\n\n9. Perform the inverse Fourier transform for each term:\n\ny(t) = InverseFourier{A / (s^2 + 4)} + InverseFourier{B / (s^2 + 9)} + InverseFourier{C / (s + 3i)} + InverseFourier{D / (s - 3i)}\n\n10. Apply the inverse Fourier transform properties:\n\ny(t) = (1/5)sin(2t) - (1/5)sin(3t) - (1/10)e^(-3it) - (1/10)e^(3it)\n\n11. Convert the complex exponentials to sinusoids:\n\ny(t) = (1/5)sin(2t) - (1/5)sin(3t) - (1/10)(cos(3t) - isin(3t)) - (1/10)(cos(3t) + isin(3t))\n\n12. Combine the terms:\n\ny(t) = (1/5)sin(2t) - (1/5)sin(3t) - (1/5)cos(3t)\n\nThis is the solution to the given differential equation with the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0."
