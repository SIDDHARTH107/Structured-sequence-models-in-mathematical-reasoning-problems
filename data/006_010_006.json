    "message_1": "What is the probability of a random individual from a specific age group, say between 45 and 50 years old, being affected by a certain disease, given that the disease's prevalence in the general population is 10% and the age group contains 5% of the population?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability. Let A be the event that a person is affected by the disease, and B be the event that a person is in the age group 45-50 years old. We are given the following information:\n\nP(A) = 0.10 (probability of being affected by the disease in the general population)\nP(B) = 0.05 (probability of being in the age group 45-50 years old)\n\nWe want to find P(A|B), the probability of being affected by the disease given that the person is in the age group 45-50 years old. However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(A|B). We need to know the relationship between the disease and the age group, such as the probability of having the disease given the age group, P(A|B), or the probability of being in the age group given the disease, P(B|A).\n\nWithout this additional information, we cannot determine the probability of a random individual from the age group 45-50 years old being affected by the disease."
