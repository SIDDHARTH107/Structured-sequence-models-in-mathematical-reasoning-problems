    "message_2": "To find the value of the function f(z) at the point z = i/2, we simply plug in z = i/2 into the function:\n\nf(i/2) = (i/2)^2 + i(i/2)\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nf(i/2) = (-1/4) + (1/2)i\n\nThe real part of the value of the function at z = i/2 is -1/4, and the imaginary part is 1/2. So, f(i/2) = -1/4 + (1/2)i."
