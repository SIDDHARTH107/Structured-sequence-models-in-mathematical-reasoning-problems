    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance, we can use the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm. One of the simplest methods to solve TSP is the brute force method, which involves calculating all possible routes and selecting the shortest one. Since there are 5 locations, there are (5-1)! = 4! = 24 possible routes. Let's calculate the distances for each route, starting and ending at Location 1:\n\n1. 1-2-3-4-5-1: 10+35+30+45+25 = 145\n2. 1-2-3-5-4-1: 10+35+10+45+20 = 120\n3. 1-2-4-3-5-1: 10+25+30+10+25 = 100\n4. 1-2-4-5-3-1: 10+25+45+10+15 = 105\n5. 1-2-5-3-4-1: 10+20+10+30+20 = 90\n6. 1-2-5-4-3-1: 10+20+45+30+15 = 120\n7. 1-3-2-4-5-1: 15+35+25+45+25 = 145\n8. 1-3-2-5-4-1: 15+35+20+45+20 = 135\n9. 1-3-4-2-5-1: 15+30+25+20+25 = 115\n10. 1-3-4-5-2-1: 15+30+45+20+10 = 120\n11. 1-3-5-2-4-1: 15+10+20+25+20 = 90\n12. 1-3-5-4-2-1: 15+10+45+25+10 = 105\n13. 1-4-2-3-5-1: 20+25+35+10+25 = 115\n14. 1-4-2-5-3-1: 20+25+20+10+15 = 90\n15. 1-4-3-2-5-1: 20+30+35+20+25 = 130\n16. 1-4-3-5-2-1: 20+30+10+20+10 = 90\n17. 1-4-5-2-3-1: 20+45+20+35+15 = 135\n18. 1-4-5-3-2-1: 20+45+10+35+10 = 120\n19. 1-5-2-3-4-1: 25+20+35+30+20 = 130\n20. 1-5-2-4-3-1: 25+20+25+30+15 = 115\n21. 1-5-3-2-4-1: 25+10+35+25+20 = 115\n22. 1-5-3-4-2-1: 25+10+30+25+10 = 100\n23. 1-5-4-2-3-1: 25+45+25+35+15 = 145\n24. 1-5-4-3-2-1: 25+45+30+35+10 = 145\n\nThe shortest distance is 90, which can be achieved by following any of these routes: 1-2-5-3-4-1, 1-3-5-2-4-1, 1-4-2-5-3-1, or 1-4-3-5-2-1."
