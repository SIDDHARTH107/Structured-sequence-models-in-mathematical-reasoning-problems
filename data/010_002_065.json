Show that if {f_n} is a sequence of continuous functions f_n: X -> R that converges pointwise to a function f: X -> R, then f is continuous at x. \n\nLet d be the Euclidean metric on R^n. Define a sequence of maps f_n: R^n -> R^n by f_n(x) = (x + 1/n) / ||x + 1/n||. Show that this sequence converges pointwise to the identity mapping I: R^n -> R^n but does not converge uniformly to I.",
    "message_2": "Proof 1: Continuity of f at x\n\nLet ε > 0 be given. Since {f_n} converges pointwise to f, for each x in X, there exists N_x such that for all n ≥ N_x, we have |f_n(x) - f(x)| < ε/3. Also, since x_n converges to x, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, d(x_n, x) < ε/3.\n\nNow, let n = max{N_x, N}. Since f_n is continuous at x, there exists δ > 0 such that for all y in X with d(y, x) < δ, we have |f_n(y) - f_n(x)| < ε/3.\n\nLet y be a point in X such that d(y, x) < δ. Then, we have:\n\n|f(y) - f(x)| ≤ |f(y) - f_n(y)| + |f_n(y) - f_n(x)| + |f_n(x) - f(x)|\n\nBy the choice of n, we have |f(y) - f_n(y)| < ε/3, |f_n(y) - f_n(x)| < ε/3, and |f_n(x) - f(x)| < ε/3. Thus,\n\n|f(y) - f(x)| < ε/3 + ε/3 + ε/3 = ε\n\nSince this holds for all y with d(y, x) < δ, we conclude that f is continuous at x.\n\nProof 2: Pointwise convergence of f_n to I but not uniformly\n\nFirst, we show that f_n converges pointwise to I. Let x be an arbitrary point in R^n. As n goes to infinity, we have:\n\nf_n(x) = (x + 1/n) / ||x + 1/n|| -> x / ||x|| = I(x)\n\nNow, we show that the convergence is not uniform. Suppose, for contradiction, that f_n converges uniformly to I. Then, for any ε > 0, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N and all x in R^n, we have ||f_n(x) - I(x)|| < ε.\n\nLet ε = 1/2. Then, for n ≥ N, we have:\n\n||(x + 1/n) / ||x + 1/n|| - x|| < 1/2\n\nLet x = (1, 0, ..., 0) (i.e., the standard basis vector e_1). Then, for n ≥ N, we have:\n\n||((1 + 1/n) / ||1 + 1/n||, 0, ..., 0) - (1, 0, ..., 0)|| < 1/2\n\nThis implies:\n\n|((1 + 1/n) / ||1 + 1/n||) - 1| < 1/2\n\nHowever, as n goes to infinity, we have:\n\n|((1 + 1/n) / ||1 + 1/n||) - 1| = |(1 + 1/n) / sqrt((1 + 1/n)^2) - 1| -> 0\n\nThis contradicts the assumption that f_n converges uniformly to I. Therefore, the convergence of f_n to I is not uniform."
