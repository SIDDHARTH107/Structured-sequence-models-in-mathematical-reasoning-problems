    "message_2": "To find the x-intercept of a polynomial equation, we need to set y to 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = 2x^3 - 7x^2 + 3x + 18\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically can be quite complex. However, we can attempt to find the x-intercepts using numerical methods or graphing software.\n\nUsing a graphing calculator or software, we can approximate the x-intercepts:\n\nx â‰ˆ -1.174, 2.000, and 4.674\n\nThese are the approximate x-intercepts of the polynomial equation y = 2x^3 - 7x^2 + 3x + 18."
