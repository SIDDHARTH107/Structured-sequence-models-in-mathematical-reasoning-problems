    "message_2": "The order of a group is the number of its elements. A group of order 77 has 77 elements. To determine the number of groups of order 77 and their structures, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order of the group: 77 = 7 * 11 (both 7 and 11 are prime numbers).\n\n2. Determine the possible structures of the group using the prime factors: Since 7 and 11 are distinct prime numbers, there are two possible structures for a group of order 77:\n\n   a) A cyclic group of order 77, denoted as Z_77 or C_77.\n   b) A direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11, denoted as Z_7 × Z_11 or C_7 × C_11.\n\n3. Check if the structures are isomorphic (i.e., if they have the same structure): In this case, the structures are not isomorphic because the orders of the cyclic groups are different (7 and 11).\n\nTherefore, there are two groups of order 77, and their structures are:\n\n1. A cyclic group of order 77: Z_77 or C_77.\n2. A direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11: Z_7 × Z_11 or C_7 × C_11."
