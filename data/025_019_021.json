    "message_2": "The number of lines contained in a smooth cubic surface in projective 3-space is a classical result in algebraic geometry, known as the 27 lines theorem. It states that there are exactly 27 lines contained in a smooth cubic surface in projective 3-space.\n\nSo, there are 27 lines contained in the given smooth cubic surface X with equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3 = 0."
