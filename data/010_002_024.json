    "message_2": "To determine the value of f(1/2), we will use the continuity of the function f.\n\nSince f is continuous, for any sequence (x_n) in [0,1] that converges to a point x in [0,1], the sequence (f(x_n)) must converge to f(x) in X.\n\nNow, consider the sequence (x_n) in [0,1] defined by x_n = 1/(2n) for n ∈ ℕ. This sequence converges to 0 as n goes to infinity. Therefore, the sequence (f(x_n)) must converge to f(0) in X.\n\nNotice that f(x_n) = f(1/(2n)) = 1/(2n+1) since f maps to X. This sequence also converges to 0 as n goes to infinity.\n\nSince f is continuous and (f(x_n)) converges to f(0), we have f(0) = 0.\n\nNow, let's consider another sequence (y_n) in [0,1] defined by y_n = 1/(2n+1) for n ∈ ℕ. This sequence converges to 0 as n goes to infinity. Therefore, the sequence (f(y_n)) must converge to f(0) in X.\n\nSince f(0) = 0, we have that (f(y_n)) converges to 0. Now, notice that f(1/2) = f(1/(2*1)) = f(y_1). Since (f(y_n)) converges to 0, we have f(1/2) = 0."
