    "message_2": "The perimeter of a circle, also known as the circumference, can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm. So, the formula becomes:\n\nC = 2π(5)\n\nC ≈ 2 × 3.14 × 5\n\nC ≈ 31.4 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 31.4 cm, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
