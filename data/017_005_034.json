    "message_2": "Since 27 is a prime power (3^3), we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups to determine the possible groups of order 27. The theorem states that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nLet G be a group of order 27. The possible groups are:\n\n1. G is isomorphic to Z_27 (cyclic group of order 27)\n2. G is isomorphic to Z_9 × Z_3 (direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 3)\n3. G is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3 (direct product of three cyclic groups of order 3)\n\nNow, let's analyze which of these groups are cyclic and which ones are isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9:\n\n1. Z_27 is a cyclic group of order 27, so it is cyclic.\n\n2. Z_9 × Z_3 is a direct product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 3. The order of this group is 9 × 3 = 27. Since the orders of the cyclic groups are coprime, this group is also cyclic.\n\n3. Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3 is a direct product of three cyclic groups of order 3. The order of this group is 3 × 3 × 3 = 27. However, this group is not cyclic, as no element in the group can generate the entire group. This group is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9 (Z_3 × (Z_3 × Z_3)).\n\nIn summary, there are three possible groups of order 27:\n\n1. Z_27 (cyclic)\n2. Z_9 × Z_3 (cyclic)\n3. Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3 (not cyclic, isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9)"
