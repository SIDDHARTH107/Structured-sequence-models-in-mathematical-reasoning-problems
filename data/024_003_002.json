    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface by the position vector r(u,v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2). Then, we can find the partial derivatives with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (∂r/∂v) = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = (1, 0, 2u) • (1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = (1, 0, 2u) • (0, 1, 2v) = 4uv\nG = r_v • r_v = (0, 1, 2v) • (0, 1, 2v) = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNext, we need to find the second derivatives of r(u,v):\n\nr_uu = (∂²r/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (∂²r/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (∂²r/∂v²) = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = r_uu • N = (0, 0, 2) • (-2u, -2v, 1) = 2\nM = r_uv • N = (0, 0, 0) • (-2u, -2v, 1) = 0\nN = r_vv • N = (0, 0, 2) • (-2u, -2v, 1) = 2\n\nHere, N is the normal vector to the surface, which is given by the cross product of r_u and r_v:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (1, 0, 2u) × (0, 1, 2v) = (-2u, -2v, 1)\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt point (1,1), we have:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\n\nL = 2\nM = 0\nN = 2\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature K at point (1,1) is:\n\nK = (2*2 - 0^2) / (5*5 - 4^2) = 4 / 9\n\nTherefore, the Gaussian curvature at point (1,1) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2 is K = 4/9."
