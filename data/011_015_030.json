    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(3,3) is the smallest number of people at a party such that there are either three people who all know each other (forming a \"red\" triangle) or three people who are all strangers to each other (forming a \"blue\" triangle). In this case, the colors red and blue are analogous to the colors of the sweaters. R(3,3) is known to be equal to 6.\n\nTo satisfy the Ramsey number R(3,3) in this situation, we need to find the minimum number of people wearing the same color sweater such that there are either three people wearing the same color sweater (forming a \"red\" triangle) or three people wearing different color sweaters (forming a \"blue\" triangle).\n\nConsider the worst-case scenario, where there are two people wearing each color sweater (2 blue, 2 green, and 2 red). In this case, there is no group of three people wearing the same color sweater or three people wearing different color sweaters.\n\nNow, if we add one more person wearing any of the three colors, we will have at least three people wearing the same color sweater. For example, if the new person wears a blue sweater, we will have 3 blue, 2 green, and 2 red sweaters. In this case, there is a group of three people wearing the same color sweater (blue), satisfying the Ramsey number R(3,3).\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of people who must be wearing the same color sweater for the Ramsey number R(3,3) to be satisfied is 3."
