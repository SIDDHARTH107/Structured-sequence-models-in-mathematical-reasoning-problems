    "message_2": "To find the order of the pole, we first need to factor the denominator and see if there is a pole at z = 1. The denominator can be factored as follows:\n\nz^2 - 2z + 1 = (z - 1)(z - 1)\n\nSince (z - 1) is a factor of the denominator, there is a pole at z = 1. The order of the pole is the multiplicity of the factor (z - 1), which is 2 in this case. So, the order of the pole is 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the residue of the function at z = 1. To do this, we can use the formula for the residue of a function with a pole of order 2:\n\nRes(f, 1) = lim (z -> 1) [(z - 1)^2 * f(z)]\n\nLet's first simplify the function f(z) by factoring the numerator:\n\nz^3 - 3z + 2 = (z - 1)(z^2 - z - 2) = (z - 1)(z - 2)(z + 1)\n\nNow, the function can be written as:\n\nf(z) = [(z - 1)(z - 2)(z + 1)] / [(z - 1)(z - 1)]\n\nWe can cancel out one of the (z - 1) factors:\n\nf(z) = (z - 2)(z + 1) / (z - 1)\n\nNow, let's find the residue:\n\nRes(f, 1) = lim (z -> 1) [(z - 1)^2 * ((z - 2)(z + 1) / (z - 1))]\n\nRes(f, 1) = lim (z -> 1) [(z - 1) * (z - 2)(z + 1)]\n\nNow, we can plug in z = 1:\n\nRes(f, 1) = (1 - 1) * (1 - 2)(1 + 1) = 0 * (-1)(2) = 0\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) at the point z = 1 is 0."
