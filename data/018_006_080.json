    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set with 50 elements. If set A has 20 elements, what is the cardinality of its complement, and what is the cardinality of the union of A and its complement? Show that the union of A and its complement is equal to the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "Let A' be the complement of set A. Since A and A' are disjoint sets (meaning they have no elements in common), the cardinality of A' is the number of elements in the universal set U that are not in A. \n\nSince there are 50 elements in U and 20 elements in A, the cardinality of A' is:\n\n|A'| = |U| - |A| = 50 - 20 = 30\n\nNow, let's find the cardinality of the union of A and its complement, A ∪ A'. Since A and A' are disjoint sets, the cardinality of their union is simply the sum of their cardinalities:\n\n|A ∪ A'| = |A| + |A'| = 20 + 30 = 50\n\nNow, we can show that the union of A and its complement is equal to the universal set U. Since the cardinality of A ∪ A' is 50, which is the same as the cardinality of U, and A ∪ A' contains all elements of A and A' (which together account for all elements in U), we can conclude that:\n\nA ∪ A' = U\n\nThus, the union of A and its complement is equal to the universal set U."
