If a student's grade in the class is determined by a fuzzy logic system, and their score is 80%, what is the degree of membership for each grade (A and B) for this student?",
    "message_2": "To determine the degree of membership for each grade (A and B) for a student with an 80% score, we will use linear interpolation between the grade boundaries.\n\nFor grade A (at least 85%):\nSince the student's score is below the minimum requirement for grade A, we will calculate how far the score is from the minimum requirement.\n\nDegree of membership for A = (Score - Minimum requirement for B) / (Minimum requirement for A - Minimum requirement for B)\nDegree of membership for A = (80 - 70) / (85 - 70)\nDegree of membership for A = 10 / 15\nDegree of membership for A = 2 / 3 ≈ 0.67\n\nFor grade B (at least 70%):\nSince the student's score is above the minimum requirement for grade B, we will calculate how far the score is from the minimum requirement.\n\nDegree of membership for B = (Score - Minimum requirement for B) / (Minimum requirement for A - Minimum requirement for B)\nDegree of membership for B = (80 - 70) / (85 - 70)\nDegree of membership for B = 10 / 15\nDegree of membership for B = 2 / 3 ≈ 0.67\n\nSo, the degree of membership for grade A is approximately 0.67, and the degree of membership for grade B is also approximately 0.67."
