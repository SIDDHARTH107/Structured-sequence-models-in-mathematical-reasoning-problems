Consider a Poincaré section in the x-axis at t = pi/4, with initial point x = 1, y = 0, and choose a map that returns the value of x at the next intersection of the trajectory with the section. Iterate the map 100 times and compute the average distance of the iterates to the fixed point.",
    "message_2": "To find the first order approximation for the stable period of the system using the Poincaré map, we first need to find the equations of motion for the system. Since the Poincaré section is in the x-axis at t = pi/4, we can rewrite the differential equations as:\n\ndx/dt = sin(pi/4) * y = (1/sqrt(2)) * y\ndy/dt = sin(pi/4) * x = (1/sqrt(2)) * x\n\nNow, we can find the Poincaré map by integrating the equations of motion over one period T:\n\nx(T) = x(0) + integral(0, T, (1/sqrt(2)) * y(t) dt)\ny(T) = y(0) + integral(0, T, (1/sqrt(2)) * x(t) dt)\n\nSince the initial point is x = 1, y = 0, we can plug these values into the equations:\n\nx(T) = 1 + integral(0, T, (1/sqrt(2)) * y(t) dt)\ny(T) = integral(0, T, (1/sqrt(2)) * x(t) dt)\n\nNow, we need to iterate the map 100 times and compute the average distance of the iterates to the fixed point. To do this, we can use a numerical method like the Euler method to approximate the solutions of the differential equations. Then, we can compute the distance between the iterates and the fixed point (1, 0) and find the average distance.\n\nHere's a Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef euler_method(x0, y0, T, dt):\n    x, y = x0, y0\n    t = 0\n    while t < T:\n        x_new = x + dt * (1/np.sqrt(2)) * y\n        y_new = y + dt * (1/np.sqrt(2)) * x\n        x, y = x_new, y_new\n        t += dt\n    return x, y\n\nx0, y0 = 1, 0\nT = np.pi / 4\ndt = 0.01\nnum_iterates = 100\ndistances = []\n\nfor _ in range(num_iterates):\n    x1, y1 = euler_method(x0, y0, T, dt)\n    distance = np.sqrt((x1 - 1)**2 + y1**2)\n    distances.append(distance)\n    x0, y0 = x1, y1\n\naverage_distance = np.mean(distances)\nprint(\"Average distance of the iterates to the fixed point:\", average_distance)\n```\n\nThis code will output the average distance of the iterates to the fixed point after iterating the map 100 times. Note that the accuracy of the result depends on the choice of the time step `dt` and the numerical method used."
