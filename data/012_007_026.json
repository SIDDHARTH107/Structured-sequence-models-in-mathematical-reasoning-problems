    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow in this network, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will start with an initial flow of 0 and iteratively find augmenting paths to increase the flow until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Initial flow: 0\n\n```\n     10\ns -----> a\n|         |\n|    5    |\n|         v\nb ------> t\n     7\n```\n\n2.
