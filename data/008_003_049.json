    "message_2": "To find the rank of the matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the matrix and then count the number of non-zero rows.\n\nMatrix A:\n[1 2 3]\n[4 5 6]\n[7 8 9]\n\nStep 1: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row, and 7 times the first row from the third row.\n\n[1  2  3]\n[0 -3 -6]\n[0 -6 -12]\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -3.\n\n[1  2   3]\n[0  1   2]\n[0 -6 -12]\n\nStep 3: Add 6 times the second row to the third row.\n\n[1 2 3]\n[0 1 2]\n[0 0 0]\n\nThe row echelon form of matrix A is:\n\n[1 2 3]\n[0 1 2]\n[0 0 0]\n\nThere are 2 non-zero rows, so the rank of the matrix A is 2."
