    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem related to RSA encryption:\n\nBob wants to send a confidential message to Alice using RSA encryption. Bob chooses p = 17 and q = 23 as his primes, and his public key is (n, e) = (391, 7). To encrypt the message, he breaks it up into blocks of two digits each, and converts each block to a number in base 26 using A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25. He gets the blocks 13, 10, 18, 08, 12, 04, 18. What is the encrypted message that Bob sends to Alice? \n\n(Note: you may assume that the message is in all uppercase letters.)",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message, Bob will raise each block to the power of e (7) and then take the result modulo n (391). This will give him the encrypted blocks.\n\nLet's compute the encrypted blocks:\n\n1. Encrypted block for 13: (13^7) % 391 = 208\n2. Encrypted block for 10: (10^7) % 391 = 266\n3. Encrypted block for 18: (18^7) % 391 = 139\n4. Encrypted block for 08: (08^7) % 391 = 173\n5. Encrypted block for 12: (12^7) % 391 = 234\n6. Encrypted block for 04: (04^7) % 391 = 47\n7. Encrypted block for 18: (18^7) % 391 = 139\n\nSo, the encrypted blocks are 208, 266, 139, 173, 234, 47, and 139.\n\nNow, let's convert these blocks back to letters using base 26:\n\n1. Encrypted block 208: 208 // 26 = 8, 208 % 26 = 0 -> IA\n2. Encrypted block 266: 266 // 26 = 10, 266 % 26 = 14 -> KN\n3. Encrypted block 139: 139 // 26 = 5, 139 % 26 = 13 -> FM\n4. Encrypted block 173: 173 // 26 = 6, 173 % 26 = 21 -> GU\n5. Encrypted block 234: 234 // 26 = 9, 234 % 26 = 0 -> JA\n6. Encrypted block 47: 47 // 26 = 1, 47 % 26 = 21 -> BV\n7. Encrypted block 139: 139 // 26 = 5, 139 % 26 = 13 -> FM\n\nThe encrypted message that Bob sends to Alice is \"IAKNFMGUJABVFM\"."
