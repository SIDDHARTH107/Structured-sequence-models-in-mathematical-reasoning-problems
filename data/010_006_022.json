Let f(x) be a continuous function from X to the unit circle S, where S is defined as the set of all points in the xy-plane with distance 1 unit from the origin. \n\nFind the homotopy group π_1(X,x) of the space X with base point x=(5,0).",
    "message_2": "The homotopy group π_1(X,x) is the fundamental group of the space X with base point x. Since X is a circle with radius 5 centered at the origin, it is homeomorphic to the unit circle S (i.e., there exists a continuous function f(x) from X to S, as described in the problem). \n\nThe fundamental group of the unit circle S is known to be isomorphic to the group of integers (Z) under addition. This is because the unit circle is a simple closed curve, and the fundamental group counts the number of times a loop winds around the circle.\n\nSince X is homeomorphic to S, their fundamental groups are isomorphic. Therefore, the homotopy group π_1(X,x) is also isomorphic to the group of integers (Z) under addition."
