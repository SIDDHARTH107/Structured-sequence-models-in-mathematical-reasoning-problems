    "message_2": "When you rotate the parabola $y = x^2$ around the $x$-axis, you generate a surface called a paraboloid. In this case, it is an elliptic paraboloid. The equation for this surface in a Cartesian coordinate system is given by:\n\n$z = x^2 + y^2$\n\nThis equation represents the surface generated by rotating the given parabola around the $x$-axis."
