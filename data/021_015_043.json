    "message_2": "To minimize the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 using particle swarm optimization (PSO), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the swarm: Set the number of particles, their positions, and velocities randomly within the given range (0 ≤ x ≤ 5).\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each particle: Calculate the value of f(x) for each particle's position.\n3. Update the personal best (pbest) and global best (gbest) positions: If a particle's current position has a better fitness than its pbest, update its pbest. If a particle's pbest has a better fitness than the current gbest, update the gbest.\n4. Update the velocities and positions of the particles: Use the PSO velocity update equation to adjust the velocities of the particles based on their pbest and the gbest. Then, update the positions of the particles using their new velocities.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a set number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., the change in gbest is smaller than a predefined threshold).\n\nSince I am an AI language model and cannot execute code, I cannot perform the PSO algorithm directly. However, I can provide you with a Python code snippet that you can use to implement the PSO algorithm for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 - 5*x + 6\n\ndef pso(num_particles, num_iterations, x_range, w, c1, c2):\n    positions = np.random.uniform(x_range[0], x_range[1], num_particles)\n    velocities = np.random.uniform(-abs(x_range[1] - x_range[0]), abs(x_range[1] - x_range[0]), num_particles)\n    pbest_positions = positions.copy()\n    pbest_fitness = f(positions)\n    gbest_position = positions[np.argmin(pbest_fitness)]\n    \n    for _ in range(num_iterations):\n        r1, r2 = np.random.rand(num_particles), np.random.rand(num_particles)\n        velocities = w * velocities + c1 * r1 * (pbest_positions - positions) + c2 * r2 * (gbest_position - positions)\n        positions += velocities\n        positions = np.clip(positions, x_range[0], x_range[1])\n        \n        fitness = f(positions)\n        better_pbest = fitness < pbest_fitness\n        pbest_positions[better_pbest] = positions[better_pbest]\n        pbest_fitness[better_pbest] = fitness[better_pbest]\n        \n        gbest_position = positions[np.argmin(pbest_fitness)]\n    \n    return gbest_position, f(gbest_position)\n\nnum_particles = 50\nnum_iterations = 100\nx_range = (0, 5)\nw = 0.7\nc1 = 1.5\nc2 = 1.5\n\ngbest_position, gbest_value = pso(num_particles, num_iterations, x_range, w, c1, c2)\nprint(f\"Optimal x: {gbest_position}, Minimum f(x): {gbest_value}\")\n```\n\nYou can adjust the parameters (number of particles, number of iterations, etc.) to achieve better results. Note that the PSO algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, so the results may not be the exact global minimum but should be close to it."
