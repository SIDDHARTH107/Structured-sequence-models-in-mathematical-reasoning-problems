    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, its diameter is equal to the side length of the cube. So, the diameter of the sphere is 6 cm. Therefore, the radius (r) of the sphere is half of the diameter, which is 3 cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume (V) of a sphere is:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nNow, we can plug in the radius (r = 3 cm) into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(3)^3\nV = (4/3)π(27)\nV = 36π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nV ≈ 36 * 3.14\nV ≈ 113.04 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 113.04 cm³, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
