The base of the container is to be made of a material that costs 25 dollars per square meter, while the material for the sides of the container costs 15 dollars per square meter. Find the dimensions of the cheapest such container that can be constructed.",
    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the rectangular prism be length (L), width (W), and height (H). The volume of the rectangular prism is given by:\n\nV = L * W * H\n\nWe are given that the volume is 3600 cubic meters:\n\nL * W * H = 3600\n\nNow, we need to find the cost of the container. The base of the container has an area of L * W and costs 25 dollars per square meter. The sides of the container have a combined area of 2(L * H) + 2(W * H) and cost 15 dollars per square meter. The total cost (C) of the container can be represented as:\n\nC = 25(L * W) + 15(2LH + 2WH)\n\nOur goal is to minimize the cost of the container while maintaining the given volume. To do this, we can use calculus to find the critical points of the cost function. However, it is easier to first eliminate one of the variables using the volume constraint. We can solve for H in terms of L and W:\n\nH = 3600 / (L * W)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for H into the cost function:\n\nC = 25(L * W) + 15(2L(3600 / (L * W)) + 2W(3600 / (L * W)))\n\nSimplify the cost function:\n\nC = 25LW + (108000 / W) + (108000 / L)\n\nNow we can use calculus to find the critical points of the cost function. Take the partial derivatives of C with respect to L and W:\n\n∂C/∂L = 25W - (108000 / L^2)\n∂C/∂W = 25L - (108000 / W^2)\n\nSet both partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for L and W:\n\n25W = 108000 / L^2\n25L = 108000 / W^2\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously by multiplying both sides of the first equation by L^2 and both sides of the second equation by W^2:\n\n25L^2W = 108000\n25LW^2 = 108000\n\nNow divide the first equation by the second equation:\n\n(L^2W) / (LW^2) = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nL / W = 1\n\nThis implies that L = W. Now we can substitute L for W in the volume constraint:\n\nL^2 * H = 3600\n\nSince L = W, we can also substitute L for H in the volume constraint:\n\nL^3 = 3600\n\nNow solve for L:\n\nL = ∛3600 ≈ 15.28\n\nSince L = W = H, the dimensions of the cheapest container are approximately:\n\nL = W = H ≈ 15.28 meters"
