Suppose that the de Rham cohomology class of $\\alpha$ is nontrivial, so that there exists a closed $1$-form $\\beta$ such that $\\alpha = d\\beta$. Show that there exists a point $p \\in M$ such that $\\beta(p) \\neq 0$.",
    "message_2": "Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $\\beta(p) = 0$ for all $p \\in M$. Then, since $M$ is compact, there exists a smooth vector field $X$ on $M$ such that $\\beta = i_X \\alpha$. Here, $i_X$ denotes the interior product with the vector field $X$. \n\nNow, consider the Lie derivative $\\mathcal{L}_X$ acting on the volume form $\\text{vol}_M$ of the manifold $M$. We have\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X \\text{vol}_M = (d i_X + i_X d) \\text{vol}_M = i_X d\\text{vol}_M = i_X \\alpha.$$\n\nSince $\\beta = i_X \\alpha = 0$ everywhere on $M$, we have $\\mathcal{L}_X \\text{vol}_M = 0$. This implies that the flow of the vector field $X$ preserves the volume form $\\text{vol}_M$. \n\nNow, since $M$ is compact, the flow of $X$ generates a one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms $\\phi_t : M \\to M$ for $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Moreover, since the flow preserves the volume form, we have\n\n$$\\int_M \\phi_t^* \\text{vol}_M = \\int_M \\text{vol}_M$$\n\nfor all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In particular, this implies that the diffeomorphisms $\\phi_t$ are all orientation-preserving.\n\nNow, consider the closed $2$-form $\\alpha$. Since $\\alpha = d\\beta$, we have $\\phi_t^* \\alpha = d(\\phi_t^* \\beta)$. However, since $\\beta = 0$ everywhere on $M$, we have $\\phi_t^* \\beta = 0$ as well, and so $\\phi_t^* \\alpha = 0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nThis implies that the de Rham cohomology class of $\\alpha$ is trivial, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, there must exist a point $p \\in M$ such that $\\beta(p) \\neq 0$."
