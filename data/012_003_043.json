    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of vertices that can be chosen such that no two of them are adjacent, we can use the concept of independent sets in graph theory. An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent.\n\nIn this graph, we can choose the following vertices: A, D, and F. This set of vertices forms an independent set, as no two of them are adjacent. There is no other combination of vertices that can be chosen such that more than three vertices are included without having two adjacent vertices.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of vertices that can be chosen such that no two of them are adjacent is 3."
