    "message_2": "Let's first understand what a maximum independent set is. An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between them). A maximum independent set is an independent set with the largest possible number of vertices.\n\nIn the given graph G, we have a maximum independent set of size 4. Now, we want to find the minimum number of vertices that must be removed to form a graph with a new maximum independent set.\n\nLet's denote the size of the new maximum independent set as k. Since we want to minimize the number of vertices removed, we should aim to maximize the size of the new maximum independent set (k).\n\nWe know that in any graph, the sum of the sizes of a maximum independent set and a minimum vertex cover is equal to the number of vertices in the graph. A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. A minimum vertex cover is a vertex cover with the smallest possible number of vertices.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\nmaximum independent set + minimum vertex cover = 8\n4 + minimum vertex cover = 8\nminimum vertex cover = 4\n\nNow, if we remove all the vertices in the minimum vertex cover, we will be left with a graph with no edges, which means that all the remaining vertices will form an independent set. In this case, the size of the new maximum independent set (k) will be equal to the number of remaining vertices.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n8 - minimum number of vertices removed = k\n8 - 4 = k\nk = 4\n\nSince we want to maximize the size of the new maximum independent set (k), we should remove all the vertices in the minimum vertex cover. Therefore, the minimum number of vertices that must be removed is 4."
