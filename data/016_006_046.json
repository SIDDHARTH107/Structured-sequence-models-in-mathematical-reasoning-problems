    "message_1": "A Barnsley fern is created by repeatedly applying a set of affine transformations to an initial shape, with each transformation having a certain probability of being chosen. If the initial shape is a single dot at the origin, what is the probability that the next point generated will be on the second frond of the Barnsley fern?",
    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern is generated using four affine transformations, each with a specific probability of being chosen. These transformations are:\n\n1. f1(x, y) = (0, 0.16y), with probability 0.01\n2. f2(x, y) = (0.85x + 0.04y, -0.04x + 0.85y + 1.6), with probability 0.85\n3. f3(x, y) = (0.2x - 0.26y, 0.23x + 0.22y + 1.6), with probability 0.07\n4. f4(x, y) = (-0.15x + 0.28y, 0.26x + 0.24y + 0.44), with probability 0.07\n\nThe second frond of the Barnsley fern is mainly generated by the third transformation, f3. Therefore, the probability that the next point generated will be on the second frond is the probability of choosing the third transformation, which is 0.07 or 7%."
