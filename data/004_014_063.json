    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the given region about the x-axis, we can use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the cross-sectional area of the solid along the axis of rotation.\n\nThe cross-sectional area of a disk at a given x-value is given by the formula A(x) = πR^2, where R is the radius of the disk. In this case, the radius is the distance from the x-axis to the curve y = x^2, which is simply the value of the function y = x^2 at that x-value. So, the cross-sectional area is A(x) = π(x^2)^2 = πx^4.\n\nNow, we need to integrate this area function along the x-axis from x = 1 to x = 2:\n\nVolume = ∫[A(x) dx] from 1 to 2\nVolume = ∫[πx^4 dx] from 1 to 2\n\nTo integrate, we use the power rule: ∫[x^n dx] = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C. So, we have:\n\nVolume = [π(x^5)/5] from 1 to 2\nVolume = π[(2^5)/5 - (1^5)/5]\nVolume = π[(32/5) - (1/5)]\nVolume = π(31/5)\n\nSo, the volume of the solid formed by rotating the region bounded by the curve y = x^2, the line y = 0, and the lines x = 1 and x = 2 about the x-axis is (31π/5) cubic units."
