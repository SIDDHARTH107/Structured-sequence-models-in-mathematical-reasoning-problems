    "message_2": "First, we will prove that A ∪ B is closed when A and B are closed subsets of X.\n\nProof:\nRecall that the complement of a closed set is an open set. Let A' and B' be the complements of A and B, respectively. Since A and B are closed, A' and B' are open sets.\n\nNow, consider the intersection of A' and B', which we'll call C. Since the intersection of two open sets is also an open set, C is open. \n\nNotice that C is also the complement of A ∪ B, because:\n\nC = A' ∩ B' = (A ∪ B)'\n\nSince C is open and C is the complement of A ∪ B, this implies that A ∪ B is closed.\n\nNow, we will prove that A ∪ B is open when A and B are open subsets of X.\n\nProof:\nSince A and B are open sets, the union of two open sets is also an open set. Therefore, A ∪ B is open."
