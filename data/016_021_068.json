    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski arrowhead curve, after each iteration, there are 3 self-similar pieces (N = 3), and each piece is scaled down by a factor of 2 (S = 2).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension D can be calculated as:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.5849625\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve remains the same after each iteration, so after the first 8 iterations, the Hausdorff dimension is still approximately 1.5849625."
