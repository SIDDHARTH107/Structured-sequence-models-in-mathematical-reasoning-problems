    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it, with each fold creating a 90-degree angle. The total length of the Dragon curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2^(n/2))\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after 10 iterations:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(10/2))\nLength = 1 * (2^5)\nLength = 1 * 32\nLength = 32\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon curve after 10 iterations is 32."
