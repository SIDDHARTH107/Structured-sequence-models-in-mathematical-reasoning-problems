    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's parameterize the surface by the coordinates (u, v) such that x = u, y = v, and z = u^3 + v^3 - 3uv. Then, the position vector r(u, v) = (u, v, u^3 + v^3 - 3uv).\n\nNow, we will find the first fundamental form. We need to compute the partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = ∂r/∂u = (1, 0, 3u^2 - 3v)\nr_v = ∂r/∂v = (0, 1, 3v^2 - 3u)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = (1, 0, 3u^2 - 3v) • (1, 0, 3u^2 - 3v) = 1 + (3u^2 - 3v)^2\nF = r_u • r_v = (1, 0, 3u^2 - 3v) • (0, 1, 3v^2 - 3u) = (3u^2 - 3v)(3v^2 - 3u)\nG = r_v • r_v = (0, 1, 3v^2 - 3u) • (0, 1, 3v^2 - 3u) = 1 + (3v^2 - 3u)^2\n\nNext, we will find the second fundamental form. We need to compute the second partial derivatives of r:\n\nr_uu = ∂²r/∂u² = (0, 0, 6u)\nr_uv = ∂²r/∂u∂v = (0, 0, -3)\nr_vv = ∂²r/∂v² = (0, 0, 6v)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = r_uu • N = (0, 0, 6u) • (0, 0, 1) = 6u\nM = r_uv • N = (0, 0, -3) • (0, 0, 1) = -3\nN = r_vv • N = (0, 0, 6v) • (0, 0, 1) = 6v\n\nHere, N is the normal vector to the surface. Now, we can find the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 3), we have:\n\nE = 1 + (3 - 3)^2 = 1\nF = (3 - 3)(3 - 1) = 0\nG = 1 + (3 - 3)^2 = 1\n\nL = 6(1) = 6\nM = -3\nN = 6(1) = 6\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (6 * 6 - (-3)^2) / (1 * 1 - 0^2) = (36 - 9) / 1 = 27\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature at the point (1, 1, 3) on the surface is 27."
