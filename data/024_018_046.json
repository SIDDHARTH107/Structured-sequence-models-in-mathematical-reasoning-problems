    "message_2": "To compute the sectional curvature of the surface S at point P(1,2,-1) in the direction of the tangent vectors V and W, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the gradient of the function that defines the surface.\n2. Compute the tangent plane to the surface at point P.\n3. Project the given tangent vectors V and W onto the tangent plane.\n4. Compute the second fundamental form of the surface.\n5. Compute the sectional curvature using the formula.\n\nStep 1: Compute the gradient of the function that defines the surface.\nThe surface S is given by the equation F(x, y, z) = x²+y²+z²-2x-4y+2z+7=0. The gradient of F is given by:\n\n∇F = (∂F/∂x, ∂F/∂y, ∂F/∂z) = (2x-2, 2y-4, 2z+2)\n\nAt point P(1,2,-1), the gradient is:\n\n∇F(P) = (2(1)-2, 2(2)-4, 2(-1)+2) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nSince the gradient is zero, the surface is not well-defined at point P. Therefore, it is not possible to compute the sectional curvature of the surface at this point."
