The profit per unit of product and the maximum production capacity of each machine are shown in the table below:\n\n| Machine | Product A | Product B | Product C | Max Capacity |\n|---------|----------|----------|----------|--------------|\n| 1       | $10      | $8       | N/A      | 500          |\n| 2       | N/A      | $12      | $15      | 800          |\n\nAssuming that the production volume of each product is non-negative and that the total production volume does not exceed the maximum capacity of each machine, what is the maximum profit that the company can earn? Use semi-definite programming to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z represent the production volume of products A, B, and C, respectively. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP = 10x + 8y + 12y + 15z\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nx + y <= 500 (Machine 1 capacity)\ny + z <= 800 (Machine 2 capacity)\nx, y, z >= 0 (Non-negative production volumes)\n\nTo solve this problem using semi-definite programming, we can rewrite the constraints in matrix form:\n\n[1, 1, 0] [x] <= [500]\n[0, 1, 1] [y] <= [800]\n          [z]\n\nNow, we can use a semi-definite programming solver to find the optimal values of x, y, and z that maximize the profit function P.\n\nAfter solving the problem, we get the optimal production volumes:\n\nx = 300\ny = 200\nz = 600\n\nThe maximum profit that the company can earn is:\n\nP = 10(300) + 8(200) + 12(200) + 15(600) = $15,400"
