    "message_2": "To find the expected value of X(1), we first need to solve the stochastic differential equation (SDE) given by:\n\ndX(t) = X(t) dt + 2 dB(t)\n\nThis SDE can be solved using the technique of Ito's lemma. Let Y(t) = ln(X(t)). Then, by Ito's lemma, we have:\n\ndY(t) = (1/X(t)) dX(t) - (1/2X(t)^2) (2^2) dt\n\nNow, substitute the given SDE into this equation:\n\ndY(t) = (1/X(t)) (X(t) dt + 2 dB(t)) - 2 dt\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\ndY(t) = dt + (1/X(t)) (2 dB(t)) - 2 dt\n\ndY(t) = -dt + 2 dB(t)\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to t from 0 to 1:\n\n∫(dY(t)) = ∫(-dt) + ∫(2 dB(t)) from 0 to 1\n\nY(1) - Y(0) = -∫(dt) + 2∫(dB(t)) from 0 to 1\n\nSince Y(t) = ln(X(t)), we have Y(1) = ln(X(1)) and Y(0) = ln(X(0)) = ln(1) = 0. Thus,\n\nln(X(1)) = -∫(dt) + 2∫(dB(t)) from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we need to find the expected value of X(1). Note that the expected value of the Brownian motion term, ∫(dB(t)), is 0. Therefore,\n\nE[ln(X(1))] = -E[∫(dt)] from 0 to 1\n\nE[ln(X(1))] = -1\n\nNow, we can use the property of the expected value of a logarithm:\n\nE[ln(X(1))] = ln(E[X(1)])\n\n-1 = ln(E[X(1)])\n\nTo find the expected value of X(1), we can take the exponential of both sides:\n\nE[X(1)] = e^(-1)\n\nE[X(1)] = 1/e ≈ 0.3679\n\nSo, the expected value of X(1) is approximately 0.3679."
