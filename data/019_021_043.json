    "message_1": "Suppose there are two players, A and B, who are playing a game where they alternately remove coins from a pile of 12 coins. A player must remove 1, 2, or 3 coins in each turn, and the player who takes the last coin from the pile wins the game. If player A goes first, can player B use a winning strategy? If so, what is it? If not, explain why not.",
    "message_2": "Yes, player B can use a winning strategy. The strategy is to always remove enough coins so that the total number of coins removed by both players in each round is 4.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Player A goes first and can remove 1, 2, or 3 coins.\n2. Player B then removes enough coins so that the total number of coins removed in this round is 4. For example, if player A removed 1 coin, player B would remove 3 coins; if player A removed 2 coins, player B would remove 2 coins; and if player A removed 3 coins, player B would remove 1 coin.\n3. This process continues, with player A making their move and player B responding by removing enough coins to make the total removed in each round equal to 4.\n\nBy following this strategy, player B ensures that after each round, 4 coins are removed from the pile. Since there are 12 coins in total, this means that after 3 rounds, there will be no coins left in the pile. Since player B always takes the last coin in each round, they will also take the last coin in the game, ensuring their victory."
