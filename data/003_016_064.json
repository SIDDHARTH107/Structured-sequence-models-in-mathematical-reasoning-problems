    "message_2": "The given function is y = 2sin(2x - π/2). To determine the phase shift, we need to look at the argument inside the sine function, which is (2x - π/2).\n\nThe general form of a sine function with phase shift is y = A*sin(B(x - C)), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our case, we have A = 2, B = 2, and the argument inside the sine function is 2(x - π/4). Therefore, the phase shift C = π/4.\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function is π/4."
