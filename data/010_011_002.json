    "message_2": "To show that M cannot be diffeomorphic to the n-dimensional sphere S^n, we will use the fact that S^n is simply connected for all n ≥ 1. Recall that a space is simply connected if it is path-connected and its fundamental group is trivial, i.e., it has no nontrivial loops.\n\nSince M has at least one connected component that is not simply connected, there exists a connected component of M with a nontrivial fundamental group. Let's call this connected component M'. Now, we will show that M' cannot be diffeomorphic to S^n.\n\nAssume for contradiction that there exists a diffeomorphism f: M' → S^n. Since f is a diffeomorphism, it is a homeomorphism, and therefore it induces an isomorphism between the fundamental groups of M' and S^n. Let's denote this isomorphism as f*: π_1(M') → π_1(S^n).\n\nRecall that π_1(S^n) is trivial for all n ≥ 1. Since f* is an isomorphism, this implies that π_1(M') must also be trivial. However, this contradicts our assumption that M' has a nontrivial fundamental group. Therefore, our assumption that there exists a diffeomorphism between M' and S^n must be false.\n\nThus, M cannot be diffeomorphic to the n-dimensional sphere S^n."
