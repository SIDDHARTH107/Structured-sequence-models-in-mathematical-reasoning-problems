    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x + 2, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately and then combine them.\n\nThe antiderivative of a function of the form x^n is given by (x^(n+1))/(n+1), where n is a constant.\n\n1. Antiderivative of 3x^2:\nn = 2, so the antiderivative is (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3.\n\n2. Antiderivative of 4x:\nn = 1, so the antiderivative is (4x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (4x^2)/2 = 2x^2.\n\n3. Antiderivative of 2 (constant):\nThe antiderivative of a constant is the constant times x. So, the antiderivative of 2 is 2x.\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term:\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + C,\nwhere C is the constant of integration."
