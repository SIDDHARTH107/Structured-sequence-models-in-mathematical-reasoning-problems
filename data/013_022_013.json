    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player 1 is given 10 coins and must decide how many coins to keep and how many coins to give to Player 2. If Player 1 keeps all 10 coins, they get to keep everything, but if they choose to give some coins to Player 2, Player 2 will receive three times the number of coins that Player 1 gives them. What is the maximum number of coins Player 1 should give to Player 2 in order to maximize their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of coins Player 1 gives to Player 2. Then, Player 2 will receive 3x coins. Player 1 will keep (10 - x) coins. Since Player 1 wants to maximize their own payoff, we need to find the value of x that maximizes (10 - x).\n\nHowever, in this Dictator Game, there is no incentive for Player 1 to give any coins to Player 2, as giving coins away will only decrease their own payoff. Therefore, to maximize their own payoff, Player 1 should give 0 coins to Player 2 and keep all 10 coins for themselves."
