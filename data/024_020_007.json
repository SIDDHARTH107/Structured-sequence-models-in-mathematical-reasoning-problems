    "message_2": "The Hopf bundle is a principal fiber bundle with total space S^3, base space S^2, and fiber S^1. The Hopf map is given by:\n\nΦ: S^3 → S^2, where Φ(z1, z2) = (2z1 * conj(z2), |z1|^2 - |z2|^2)\n\nHere, z1 and z2 are complex numbers, and conj denotes the complex conjugate.\n\nNow, let's consider two vertical complex lines in the total space of the Hopf bundle. A vertical complex line is a fiber over a point in the base space S^2. Since the fibers are disjoint, the intersection number of two vertical complex lines is 0.\n\nIn other words, two vertical complex lines in the total space of the Hopf bundle do not intersect, so their intersection number is 0."
