    "message_1": "Suppose there are two players in an Ultimatum Game, player A and player B. Player A proposes a division of $100 among the two players, and player B can either accept or reject the proposal. If B accepts, each player receives their respective share. If B rejects, neither player receives anything.  If player A proposes a 50-50 split, what is the minimum amount that player B should accept in order for both players to receive a non-zero payoff?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the minimum amount that player B should accept in order for both players to receive a non-zero payoff depends on player B's preferences and their perception of fairness. However, if we assume that player B is rational and wants to maximize their payoff, they should accept any amount greater than $0 proposed by player A. \n\nIn this case, if player A proposes a 50-50 split, player B should accept any amount equal to or greater than $1 (the smallest non-zero amount) to ensure both players receive a non-zero payoff."
