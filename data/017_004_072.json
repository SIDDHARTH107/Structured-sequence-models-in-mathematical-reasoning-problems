Then G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n\nProof:\n\nLet G be a group of order 25. Since 25 = 5^2, we can apply the theorem above. Let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic\n\nIf G is cyclic, then there exists an element g in G such that G = ⟨g⟩, where ⟨g⟩ denotes the cyclic subgroup generated by g. In this case, the order of g is 25, and G is a cyclic group of order 25.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic\n\nIf G is not cyclic, then there is no element in G with order 25. By the class equation, we know that the number of elements in G with order 1 or 5 must be a multiple of 5. Since the identity element has order 1, there must be at least 5 elements with order 5.\n\nLet a be an element of order 5 in G. Then the cyclic subgroup H = ⟨a⟩ has order 5. Since the order of G is 25, by Lagrange's theorem, the index of H in G is [G : H] = 25/5 = 5. By the second isomorphism theorem, there exists a subgroup K of G such that G = HK and H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element.\n\nLet b be an element in K with order 5 (such an element must exist since there are at least 5 elements with order 5 in G). Then the cyclic subgroup L = ⟨b⟩ has order 5. Since H ∩ K = {e}, the elements of H and L commute, i.e., for any h in H and l in L, hl = lh.\n\nNow, consider the set {hk | h in H, k in L}. This set has 25 elements since there are 5 elements in H and 5 elements in L, and the elements of H and L commute. Since G has 25 elements, this set must be equal to G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and L, which are both cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 25, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
