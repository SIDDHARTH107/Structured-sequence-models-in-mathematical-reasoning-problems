    "message_1": "A company is manufacturing two products A and B. The production process for A requires 3 units of resource X, 4 units of resource Y, and 2 units of resource Z. The production process for B requires 2 units of resource X, 5 units of resource Y, and 1 unit of resource Z. The company has 60 units of resource X, 70 units of resource Y, and 40 units of resource Z available. The profit from the sale of A is $10 per unit and the profit from the sale of B is $8 per unit. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit the company can make from the production of A and B, assuming they can sell as many units of A and B as they can produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. The constraints for the resources can be written as:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 60 (Resource X constraint)\n4x + 5y ≤ 70 (Resource Y constraint)\n2x + y ≤ 40 (Resource Z constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 8y\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. First, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 60\n   y ≤ (60 - 3x)/2\n\n2. 4x + 5y ≤ 70\n   y ≤ (70 - 4x)/5\n\n3. 2x + y ≤ 40\n   y ≤ 40 - 2x\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all these inequalities intersect. The vertices of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 14), (10, 0), and (20, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 14) = 10(0) + 8(14) = $112\n3. P(10, 0) = 10(10) + 8(0) = $100\n4. P(20, 0) = 10(20) + 8(0) = $200\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (20, 0), which corresponds to producing 20 units of product A and 0 units of product B. The maximum profit the company can make is $200."
