    "message_2": "To solve the given system of equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing each column with the constant terms (Dx, Dy, Dz). Finally, we'll divide each of these determinants by D to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nThe coefficient matrix and its determinant (D) are:\n\n| 2  3  1 | \n| 4 -1  2 | = (2(-1)(-2) + 3(2)(1) + 1(4)(1)) - (1(-1)(4) + 2(2)(1) + (-2)(3)(1))\n| 1  3 -2 |\n\nD = (4 + 6 + 4) - (-4 + 4 - 6) = 14 + 6 = 20\n\nNow, let's find the determinant Dx by replacing the first column with the constant terms:\n\n| 13  3  1 | \n| -1 -1  2 | = (13(-1)(-2) + 3(-1)(1) + 1(-1)(2)) - (1(-1)(-1) + 2(-1)(1) + (-2)(3)(1))\n| 10  3 -2 |\n\nDx = (26 - 3 - 2) - (1 - 2 + 6) = 21 + 3 = 24\n\nNow, let's find the determinant Dy by replacing the second column with the constant terms:\n\n| 2 13  1 | \n| 4 -1  2 | = (2(-1)(-2) + 13(2)(1) + 1(4)(1)) - (1(-1)(4) + 2(2)(1) + (-2)(13)(1))\n| 1 10 -2 |\n\nDy = (4 + 26 + 4) - (-4 + 4 - 26) = 34 + 26 = 60\n\nNow, let's find the determinant Dz by replacing the third column with the constant terms:\n\n| 2  3 13 | \n| 4 -1 -1 | = (2(-1)(-1) + 3(-1)(-1) + 13(4)(1)) - (13(-1)(4) + 3(2)(1) + (1)(1)(1))\n| 1  3 10 |\n\nDz = (2 + 3 + 52) - (-52 + 6 + 1) = 57 + 59 = 116\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z by dividing Dx, Dy, and Dz by D:\n\nx = Dx / D = 24 / 20 = 6/5\ny = Dy / D = 60 / 20 = 3\nz = Dz / D = 116 / 20 = 29/5\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of equations is:\n\nx = 6/5\ny = 3\nz = 29/5"
