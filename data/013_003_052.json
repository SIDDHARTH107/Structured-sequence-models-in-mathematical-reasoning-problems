    "message_1": "In an ultimatum game, player 1 has $100 and offers a split to player 2. If player 2 accepts, both players keep their share. If player 2 rejects, both players receive nothing. What is the lowest offer that player 1 can make to ensure that player 2 accepts the split?",
    "message_2": "In an ultimatum game, the lowest offer that player 1 can make to ensure that player 2 accepts the split is $1. This is because if player 2 rejects the offer, they will receive nothing, so accepting $1 is still better than getting nothing. However, this assumes that player 2 is acting rationally and prioritizes getting some money over getting nothing. In reality, people may not always act rationally in such situations, and the lowest acceptable offer may vary depending on the individuals involved."
