    "message_2": "The scaling factor of the Barnsley fern when each of its four transformations is scaled down by a factor of 0.5 is also 0.5. This is because each transformation is uniformly scaled down by the same factor, which results in the overall scaling factor being the same as the individual scaling factors."
