    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the vector space H^1(X, O_X), we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor D on a smooth projective curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere l(D) denotes the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles only at the points of D, K is the canonical divisor, and deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D.\n\nIn our case, we want to compute H^1(X, O_X), which is the same as l(K) since H^1(X, O_X) is the global sections of the canonical sheaf ω_X, and the canonical divisor K is associated with ω_X.\n\nLet's first compute the genus g of the curve X. The curve X is a smooth projective curve of degree 3, so by the genus-degree formula, we have:\n\ng = (d - 1)(d - 2)/2 = (3 - 1)(3 - 2)/2 = 1.\n\nNow, let's compute the degree of the canonical divisor K. Since X is a smooth projective curve of degree 3, it is a plane curve, and the canonical divisor K is given by the divisor of a differential form on the curve. In this case, we have:\n\ndeg(K) = (3 - 1)(3 - 2) = 2.\n\nNow we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem to compute l(K). We will use the divisor D = K, so we have:\n\nl(K) - l(0) = deg(K) + 1 - g.\n\nSince l(0) = 1 and deg(K) = 2, we have:\n\nl(K) - 1 = 2 + 1 - 1,\n\nwhich implies:\n\nl(K) = 3.\n\nThus, the dimension of the vector space H^1(X, O_X) is 3."
