    "message_2": "To find all the solutions of the given polynomial equation, we can first try to factor it. \n\n2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x - 4 = 0\n\nNotice that all the coefficients are even numbers, so we can factor out a 2:\n\n2(x^3 - 4.5x^2 + 6x - 2) = 0\n\nNow, we can try to factor the cubic polynomial inside the parentheses using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p must be a factor of the constant term (in this case, -2) and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 1). \n\nThe factors of -2 are ±1 and ±2. Since the leading coefficient is 1, the possible rational roots are ±1 and ±2. We can test these values:\n\nx = 1: (1)^3 - 4.5(1)^2 + 6(1) - 2 = 1 - 4.5 + 6 - 2 = 0.5 (not a root)\nx = -1: (-1)^3 - 4.5(-1)^2 + 6(-1) - 2 = -1 - 4.5 - 6 - 2 = -13.5 (not a root)\nx = 2: (2)^3 - 4.5(2)^2 + 6(2) - 2 = 8 - 18 + 12 - 2 = 0 (a root)\nx = -2: (-2)^3 - 4.5(-2)^2 + 6(-2) - 2 = -8 - 18 - 12 - 2 = -40 (not a root)\n\nSo, x = 2 is a root of the polynomial. Now we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(x^3 - 4.5x^2 + 6x - 2) ÷ (x - 2)\n\nUsing synthetic division or long division, we get:\n\nx^2 - 2.5x + 1\n\nNow, we can find the roots of this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2.5, and c = 1:\n\nx = [2.5 ± sqrt((-2.5)^2 - 4(1)(1))] / 2(1)\nx = [2.5 ± sqrt(6.25 - 4)] / 2\nx = [2.5 ± sqrt(2.25)] / 2\nx = [2.5 ± 1.5] / 2\n\nSo, the two remaining roots are:\n\nx = (2.5 + 1.5) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 (this is the same root we found earlier)\nx = (2.5 - 1.5) / 2 = 1 / 2 = 0.5\n\nThus, the solutions of the polynomial equation 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x - 4 = 0 are x = 2 (a repeated root) and x = 0.5."
