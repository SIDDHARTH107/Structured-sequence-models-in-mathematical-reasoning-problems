    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 1, b = 5, and c = 6.\n\nx = (-(5) ± √((5)^2 - 4(1)(6))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 2\n\nx = (-5 ± √1) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (-5 + 1) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2\n\nx = (-5 - 1) / 2 = -6 / 2 = -3\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 are x = -2 and x = -3."
