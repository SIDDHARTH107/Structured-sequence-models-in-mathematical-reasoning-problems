    "message_1": "A company manufactures two types of products, A and B. The company needs to produce at least 500 units of each product. The cost of producing one unit of A is $3 and the cost of producing one unit of B is $5. The company has a budget of $3500. Assuming that all produced items will be sold, what is the maximum profit the company can make?\n\nHint: Let X be the number of units of A produced, and Y be the number of units of B produced. Use the constraints X >= 500 and Y >= 500, the budget constraint 3X + 5Y <= 3500, and the profit equation P = 8X + 10Y to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "First, let's write down the given constraints and the profit equation:\n\n1. X >= 500 (At least 500 units of A)\n2. Y >= 500 (At least 500 units of B)\n3. 3X + 5Y <= 3500 (Budget constraint)\n4. P = 8X + 10Y (Profit equation)\n\nWe need to find the maximum value of P, given the constraints.\n\nLet's start by solving the budget constraint equation for Y:\n\n5Y <= 3500 - 3X\nY <= (3500 - 3X) / 5\n\nSince X >= 500, we can plug this value into the equation for Y:\n\nY <= (3500 - 3(500)) / 5\nY <= (3500 - 1500) / 5\nY <= 2000 / 5\nY <= 400\n\nNow we know that Y must be between 500 and 400. Since the company needs to produce at least 500 units of each product, we can conclude that the company cannot produce 500 units of product B within the given budget. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of units of product B that can be produced while still meeting the budget constraint.\n\nLet's plug Y = 400 into the budget constraint equation:\n\n3X + 5(400) <= 3500\n3X + 2000 <= 3500\n3X <= 1500\nX <= 500\n\nNow we know that X must be between 500 and 500. Since the company needs to produce at least 500 units of each product, we can conclude that the company can only produce 500 units of product A within the given budget.\n\nNow that we have the values of X and Y, we can plug them into the profit equation:\n\nP = 8(500) + 10(400)\nP = 4000 + 4000\nP = 8000\n\nTherefore, the maximum profit the company can make is $8000."
