    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of grey wolves. It is an iterative process that involves the following steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of grey wolves.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each wolf.\n3. Update the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves.\n4. Update the position of the other wolves.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the desired number of iterations.\n\nTo solve the given optimization problem using GWO, we will follow these steps. However, since I am an AI language model, I cannot execute the algorithm directly. Instead, I will provide you with a Python code that you can run to obtain the solution.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 + 10 * np.cos(2 * np.pi * x)\n\ndef initialize_population(population_size):\n    return np.random.uniform(-5, 5, population_size)\n\ndef calculate_fitness(population):\n    return np.array([f(x) for x in population])\n\ndef update_positions(population, alpha, beta, delta, a):\n    new_population = []\n    for x in population:\n        r1 = np.random.rand()\n        r2 = np.random.rand()\n        A1 = 2 * a * r1 - a\n        C1 = 2 * r2\n        D_alpha = abs(C1 * alpha - x)\n        X1 = alpha - A1 * D_alpha\n\n        r1 = np.random.rand()\n        r2 = np.random.rand()\n        A2 = 2 * a * r1 - a\n        C2 = 2 * r2\n        D_beta = abs(C2 * beta - x)\n        X2 = beta - A2 * D_beta\n\n        r1 = np.random.rand()\n        r2 = np.random.rand()\n        A3 = 2 * a * r1 - a\n        C3 = 2 * r2\n        D_delta = abs(C3 * delta - x)\n        X3 = delta - A3 * D_delta\n\n        x_new = (X1 + X2 + X3) / 3\n        new_population.append(x_new)\n\n    return np.array(new_population)\n\ndef grey_wolf_optimizer(population_size, iterations):\n    population = initialize_population(population_size)\n    alpha, beta, delta = None, None, None\n\n    for iteration in range(iterations):\n        fitness = calculate_fitness(population)\n        sorted_indices = np.argsort(fitness)\n        alpha, beta, delta = population[sorted_indices[:3]]\n\n        a = 2 - iteration * (2 / iterations)\n        population = update_positions(population, alpha, beta, delta, a)\n\n    best_fitness = f(alpha)\n    return best_fitness, alpha\n\npopulation_size = 50\niterations = 500\nmin_value, x_min = grey_wolf_optimizer(population_size, iterations)\nprint(f\"Minimum value of the function: {min_value}\")\nprint(f\"Value of x that corresponds to the minimum: {x_min}\")\n```\n\nRun this Python code to find the minimum value of the function and the value of x that corresponds to the minimum using the Grey Wolf Optimizer with a population size of 50 and 500 iterations.
