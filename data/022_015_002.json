    "message_2": "To find the image of the complex plane under the reflection of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$ about the unit circle $|z| = 1$, we first need to find the inverse of the function $f(z)$. The inverse function $f^{-1}(z)$ is the function that satisfies $f(f^{-1}(z)) = z$ and $f^{-1}(f(z)) = z$.\n\nFor the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$, we can find the inverse function as follows:\n\nLet $w = f^{-1}(z)$. Then, $z = f(w) = \\frac{1}{w}$. Solving for $w$, we get $w = \\frac{1}{z}$. Thus, the inverse function is $f^{-1}(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$.\n\nNow, let's find the image of the complex plane under the reflection of the function $f(z)$ about the unit circle $|z| = 1$. Let $z$ be a point on the complex plane, and let $z'$ be its image under the reflection. Then, the midpoint of the segment connecting $z$ and $z'$ lies on the unit circle.\n\nLet $m$ be the midpoint of the segment connecting $z$ and $z'$. Then, $m = \\frac{z + z'}{2}$. Since $m$ lies on the unit circle, we have $|m| = 1$. Substituting the expression for $m$, we get:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{z + z'}{2}\\right| = 1$$\n\nNow, we know that $z' = f^{-1}(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{z + \\frac{1}{z}}{2}\\right| = 1$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$$\\left|z + \\frac{1}{z}\\right| = 2$$\n\nThis is the equation that describes the image of the complex plane under the reflection of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$ about the unit circle $|z| = 1$."
