    "message_1": "In a game of rock-paper-scissors between two players, Player 1 chooses rock 35% of the time, paper 25% of the time, and scissors 40% of the time. Player 2 chooses rock 40% of the time, paper 30% of the time, and scissors 30% of the time. If the players play 100 rounds of the game, how many rounds are likely to end in a tie?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a tie, we need to find the probability of both players choosing the same move (rock, paper, or scissors) and then multiply that by the total number of rounds played.\n\nThe probability of both players choosing rock is 0.35 (Player 1) * 0.40 (Player 2) = 0.14.\nThe probability of both players choosing paper is 0.25 (Player 1) * 0.30 (Player 2) = 0.075.\nThe probability of both players choosing scissors is 0.40 (Player 1) * 0.30 (Player 2) = 0.12.\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of all three scenarios to find the total probability of a tie:\n\n0.14 (rock) + 0.075 (paper) + 0.12 (scissors) = 0.335.\n\nFinally, we multiply the total probability of a tie by the number of rounds played (100) to find the expected number of tied rounds:\n\n0.335 * 100 = 33.5.\n\nSince it's not possible to have half a round, we can round to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can expect approximately 34 rounds to end in a tie."
