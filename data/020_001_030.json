    "message_1": "A company produces two products, P1 and P2. Each unit of P1 requires 4 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor time to produce, while each unit of P2 requires 2 hours of machine time and 3 hours of labor time. The company has 60 hours of machine time and 45 hours of labor time available per week. Each unit of P1 yields a profit of $20, while each unit of P2 yields a profit of $30. Formulate a linear programming problem to determine the optimal number of units of each product the company should produce to maximize profit, and then solve it.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of P1 produced and y be the number of units of P2 produced.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit = 20x + 30y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Machine time: 4x + 2y ≤ 60\n2. Labor time: 2x + 3y ≤ 45\n3. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow we will solve the linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 4x + 2y ≤ 60\n   y ≤ 30 - 2x\n\n2. 2x + 3y ≤ 45\n   y ≤ (45 - 2x) / 3\n\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. The vertices of the feasible region are the points where the constraints intersect. We will find these vertices and then evaluate the objective function at each vertex to determine the maximum profit.\n\nVertices of the feasible region:\nA. (0, 0)\nB. (0, 15)\nC. (15, 10)\nD. (20, 0)\n\nNow we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nA. Profit at (0, 0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\nB. Profit at (0, 15) = 20(0) + 30(15) = $450\nC. Profit at (15, 10) = 20(15) + 30(10) = $600\nD. Profit at (20, 0) = 20(20) + 30(0) = $400\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex C, where 15 units of P1 and 10 units of P2 are produced. The maximum profit is $600."
