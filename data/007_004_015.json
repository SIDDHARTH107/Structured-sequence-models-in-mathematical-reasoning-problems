    "message_2": "To find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 36 and 54, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (54) by the smaller number (36) and find the remainder.\n54 รท 36 = 1, remainder 18\n\n2. Replace the larger number (54) with the smaller number (36) and the smaller number with the remainder (18).\nNow, we need to find the GCD of 36 and 18.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (36) by the smaller number (18) and find the remainder.\n36 รท 18 = 2, remainder 0\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD is the smaller number, which is 18.\n\nSo, the GCD of 36 and 54 is 18."
