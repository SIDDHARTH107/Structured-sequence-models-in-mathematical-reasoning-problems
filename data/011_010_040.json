    "message_1": "A gym coach wants to create a workout plan consisting of 10 different exercises to be performed in pairs, for a total of 5 pairs. How many different workout plans can the coach create if each exercise must be performed exactly once and the same pair cannot be performed twice?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. The coach needs to create 5 pairs from 10 exercises, and the order of the pairs does not matter.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of ways to choose the first pair. There are 10 exercises, and the coach needs to choose 2 of them for the first pair. This can be done in C(10,2) ways, where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items. \n\nC(10,2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = 45\n\nNow, there are 8 exercises left. The coach needs to choose 2 of them for the second pair. This can be done in C(8,2) ways:\n\nC(8,2) = 8! / (2! * (8-2)!) = 28\n\nSimilarly, for the third pair, there are 6 exercises left, and the coach needs to choose 2 of them:\n\nC(6,2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15\n\nFor the fourth pair, there are 4 exercises left, and the coach needs to choose 2 of them:\n\nC(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6\n\nFinally, there are 2 exercises left, and they will form the last pair.\n\nNow, to find the total number of different workout plans, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose each pair:\n\nTotal workout plans = 45 * 28 * 15 * 6 * 1 = 113400"
