    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph G, we can use the concept of graph theory and the chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nFirst, we need to find the maximum degree of the graph, which is the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex. Since G has 10 vertices and 20 edges, the average degree of a vertex is (2 * 20) / 10 = 4. However, the maximum degree could be higher than the average degree.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, we can have a vertex connected to all other 9 vertices, which would result in a maximum degree of 9. In this case, we would need at least 10 colors to color the graph, as each adjacent vertex would need a different color.\n\nHowever, this worst-case scenario is not possible with only 20 edges. The maximum degree of a vertex in a graph with 10 vertices and 20 edges is 7. This can be achieved, for example, by having a vertex connected to 7 other vertices, and the remaining 2 vertices connected to 3 other vertices each.\n\nIn this case, we would need at least 8 colors to color the graph, as the vertex with the maximum degree of 7 would have 7 adjacent vertices, each requiring a different color, plus one color for the vertex itself.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph G with 10 vertices and 20 edges is 8."
