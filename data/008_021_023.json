    "message_2": "First, we will write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  3 |  5 ]\n[ 4  6 | 10 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gauss-Jordan elimination to get the matrix in reduced row echelon form (RREF).\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1 in the first row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5 |  2.5 ]\n[ 4  6   | 10   ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with the second row minus 4 times the first row to eliminate the leading 4 in the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5 |  2.5 ]\n[ 0  0   |  0   ]\n```\n\nThe matrix is now in RREF:\n\n```\n[ 1  1.5 |  2.5 ]\n[ 0  0   |  0   ]\n```\n\nThe second row represents the equation 0x + 0y = 0, which is always true. This means that the system is dependent and has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo express the general solution, we can rewrite the first row as an equation:\n\nx + 1.5y = 2.5\n\nNow, we can solve for x in terms of y:\n\nx = 2.5 - 1.5y\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\nx = 2.5 - 1.5y\ny = y\n\nwhere y can be any real number."
