    "message_2": "To partition the given triangle into smaller triangles with an area of 2, we can start by calculating the area of the given triangle using the Shoelace formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * |Î£(x_i * y_(i+1) - x_(i+1) * y_i)|, where the summation is from i=1 to n, and x_(n+1) = x_1, y_(n+1) = y_1.\n\nFor the given triangle with vertices A(-1,0), B(3,4), and C(2,-2), we have:\n\nArea = (1/2) * |(-1 * 4 - 3 * -2) + (3 * -2 - 2 * 0) + (2 * 0 - -1 * -2)|\nArea = (1/2) * |-4 + 6 - 6 + 2|\nArea = (1/2) * |-2|\nArea = 1\n\nSince the area of the given triangle is 1, it is not possible to partition it into smaller triangles with an area of 2, as the sum of the areas of the smaller triangles would be greater than the area of the original triangle."
