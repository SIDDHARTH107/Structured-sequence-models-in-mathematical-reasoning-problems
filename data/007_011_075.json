    "message_2": "To find all quadratic residues of the integer 27 modulo 83, we need to find all the numbers x such that x^2 ≡ 27 (mod 83). \n\nFirst, let's find the Legendre symbol (27/83) to check if 27 is a quadratic residue modulo 83. The Legendre symbol is defined as:\n\n(27/83) = 1 if there exists an x such that x^2 ≡ 27 (mod 83)\n(27/83) = -1 if there is no such x\n\nUsing the properties of the Legendre symbol, we can rewrite (27/83) as (3/83)^3 since 27 = 3^3. Now, we can use the quadratic reciprocity law:\n\n(3/83) = (-1)^((3-1)(83-1)/4) * (83/3)\n\n(3/83) = (-1)^((2)(82)/4) * (83/3)\n\nSince (-1)^((2)(82)/4) = 1, we have:\n\n(3/83) = (83/3)\n\nNow, we need to find (83/3). Since 83 ≡ 2 (mod 3), we can rewrite (83/3) as (2/3). Using the quadratic reciprocity law again:\n\n(2/3) = (-1)^((3-1)(2-1)/4) * (3/2)\n\n(2/3) = (-1)^((2)(1)/4) * (3/2)\n\nSince (-1)^((2)(1)/4) = 1, we have:\n\n(2/3) = (3/2)\n\nNow, we need to find (3/2). Since 3 ≡ 1 (mod 2), we can rewrite (3/2) as (1/2). Using the property of the Legendre symbol for (1/2):\n\n(1/2) = (-1)^((2-1)(1-1)/4) = 1\n\nSo, (27/83) = (3/83)^3 = (2/3) = 1, which means that 27 is a quadratic residue modulo 83.\n\nNow, we need to find all the numbers x such that x^2 ≡ 27 (mod 83). To do this, we can simply test all the numbers from 1 to 41 (since 83 is a prime number and we only need to test up to (83-1)/2). \n\nAfter testing all the numbers, we find that:\n\nx = 9: 9^2 ≡ 81 ≡ -2 (mod 83)\nx = 74: 74^2 ≡ 5476 ≡ -2 (mod 83)\n\nSo, there are two solutions: x = 9 and x = 74. Therefore, the quadratic residues of the integer 27 modulo 83 are 9 and 74."
