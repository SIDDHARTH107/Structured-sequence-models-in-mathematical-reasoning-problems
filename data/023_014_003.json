    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n of the wave function ψ(x), we need to use the Fourier series formula:\n\nψ(x) = (a_0 / 2) + Σ[a_n * cos(2πnx/L) + b_n * sin(2πnx/L)]\n\nwhere the coefficients a_n and b_n are given by:\n\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[ψ(x) * cos(2πnx/L) dx] from 0 to L\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[ψ(x) * sin(2πnx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nIn this case, the wave function ψ(x) is already given in terms of sine functions:\n\nψ(x) = 5 sin(6πx/L) + 3 sin(14πx/L)\n\nComparing this with the Fourier series formula, we can see that there are no cosine terms, so all a_n coefficients will be zero.\n\nNow, let's find the b_n coefficients. Since the wave function is already given in terms of sine functions, we can directly identify the b_n coefficients by comparing the terms:\n\nb_3 = 5 (since 6πx/L = 2π(3)x/L)\nb_7 = 3 (since 14πx/L = 2π(7)x/L)\n\nAll other b_n coefficients will be zero.\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients are:\n\na_n = 0 for all n\nb_n = 5 for n = 3\nb_n = 3 for n = 7\nb_n = 0 for all other n"
