    "message_2": "To find the integral of sin(x) with respect to x from 0 to pi/2, we first need to find the antiderivative of sin(x). The antiderivative of sin(x) is -cos(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration. \n\nNow, we need to evaluate the definite integral:\n\nâˆ«(sin(x) dx) from 0 to pi/2 = [-cos(x)] from 0 to pi/2\n\nTo evaluate this, we plug in the upper limit and then subtract the result of plugging in the lower limit:\n\n[-cos(pi/2)] - [-cos(0)]\n\nSince cos(pi/2) = 0 and cos(0) = 1, the result is:\n\n[0] - [-1] = 1\n\nSo, the integral of sin(x) with respect to x from 0 to pi/2 is 1."
