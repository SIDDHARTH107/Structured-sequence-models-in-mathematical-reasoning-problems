Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to the Dictator Game in Game Theory:\n\nIn a Dictator Game scenario, Player 1 is given $100 and is tasked with dividing the money with Player 2. Player 1 decides to keep $80 for themself and gives the remaining $20 to Player 2. If both players act rationally and Player 2's only goal is to maximize their own payoff, what is the maximum amount of money that Player 2 can expect to receive from Player 1, knowing that Player 1 will keep at least $1 for themselves?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, Player 1 has complete control over the division of the money, and Player 2 has no influence over the decision. Since Player 2's only goal is to maximize their own payoff, they would want Player 1 to give them as much money as possible. However, Player 1 will keep at least $1 for themselves.\n\nSo, the maximum amount of money that Player 2 can expect to receive from Player 1 is when Player 1 keeps only $1 and gives the remaining amount to Player 2. In this case, Player 2 would receive:\n\n$100 - $1 = $99\n\nTherefore, the maximum amount of money that Player 2 can expect to receive from Player 1 is $99."
