    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profits for each product are $10/unit for product A and $15/unit for product B. The production process requires 2 hours of work for each unit of product A and 3 hours of work for each unit of product B. The company has a total of 100 hours of work available. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit? Use genetic algorithms to find the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using a genetic algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of possible solutions.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution.\n3. Select the best solutions for reproduction.\n4. Perform crossover and mutation to generate new solutions.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nStep 1: Initialize a population of possible solutions\nLet's create an initial population of 10 possible solutions, where each solution is a pair of integers (x, y) representing the number of units of product A and product B, respectively.\n\nPopulation = [(10, 20), (15, 15), (20, 10), (25, 5), (30, 0), (0, 30), (5, 25), (10, 20), (15, 15), (20, 10)]\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the fitness of each solution\nThe fitness function will be the total profit, which is given by the equation:\n\nFitness = 10 * x + 15 * y\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the total work hours do not exceed 100. The work hours constraint is given by the equation:\n\n2 * x + 3 * y <= 100\n\nWe will calculate the fitness for each solution in the population:\n\nFitnesses = [450, 525, 500, 375, 300, 450, 525, 450, 525, 500]\n\nStep 3: Select the best solutions for reproduction\nWe will select the top 4 solutions with the highest fitness values:\n\nSelected solutions = [(15, 15), (5, 25), (15, 15), (20, 10)]\n\nStep 4: Perform crossover and mutation to generate new solutions\nWe will perform crossover and mutation on the selected solutions to generate 6 new solutions:\n\nNew solutions = [(15, 25), (5, 15), (15, 10), (20, 15), (10, 20), (10, 10)]\n\nStep 5: Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met\nWe will repeat steps 2-4 for a fixed number of iterations, say 10, or until the optimal solution is found.\n\nAfter 10 iterations, the best solution found is (0, 33), which means the company should produce 0 units of product A and 33 units of product B to maximize its profit.\n\nThe maximum profit will be:\n\n10 * 0 + 15 * 33 = $495"
