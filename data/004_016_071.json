    "message_2": "Let's consider a function f(t) that represents the position of the car at time t. We know that f(0) = 0 and f(4) = 120 meters.\n\nThe average speed of the car over the 4 seconds is given by the total distance covered divided by the time taken, which is (120 - 0) / (4 - 0) = 120 / 4 = 30 meters per second.\n\nNow, let's apply the Mean Value Theorem. The theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at that point is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval.\n\nIn our case, the function f(t) is continuous on the closed interval [0, 4] and differentiable on the open interval (0, 4), since the position of the car is a continuous and differentiable function of time.\n\nTherefore, by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 4) such that:\n\nf'(c) = (f(4) - f(0)) / (4 - 0)\n\nSince f'(t) represents the speed of the car at time t, we have:\n\nSpeed at time c = (120 - 0) / (4 - 0)\n\nSpeed at time c = 120 / 4\n\nSpeed at time c = 30 meters per second\n\nSo, at some point during the journey, the speed of the car was exactly 30 meters per second."
