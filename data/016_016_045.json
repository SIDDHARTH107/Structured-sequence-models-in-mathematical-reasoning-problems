    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that can be generated using an L-system with the following rules:\n\nAxiom: A\nA -> A-B--B+A++AA+B-\nB -> +A-BB--B-A++A+B\n\nTo find the total number of line segments in the Gosper curve of order 5, we need to determine the number of segments in each iteration.\n\nOrder 0: 1 segment (the axiom)\nOrder 1: 7 segments (each A or B in the axiom is replaced by the corresponding rule)\nOrder 2: 49 segments (each A or B in the previous iteration is replaced by the corresponding rule)\nOrder 3: 343 segments\nOrder 4: 2401 segments\nOrder 5: 16807 segments\n\nSo, the total number of line segments required to draw the Gosper curve of order 5 is 16,807."
