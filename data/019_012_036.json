    "message_1": "Sorry, but it is not possible to provide a precise numerical problem related to paraconsistent logic as it is a type of logic that allows for contradictions to exist in a system. Paraconsistent logic is concerned with reasoning in the presence of contradictions and not numerical computations. It is more about understanding the theoretical concept of how to reason in the presence of contradictions than solving numerical problems.",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are referring to paraconsistent logic, which is not related to numerical problems. If you have any other mathematical problem or question, please feel free to ask, and I will be happy to help you with that."
