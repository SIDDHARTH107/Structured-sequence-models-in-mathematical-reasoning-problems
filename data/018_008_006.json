    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product of two sets, we form ordered pairs with the elements from the first set as the first component and the elements from the second set as the second component.\n\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB × A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two Cartesian products:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nWe can see that the ordered pairs in A × B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B × A. For example, (1, 3) is in A × B, but not in B × A. Similarly, (3, 1) is in B × A, but not in A × B.\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative, as (A × B) is not equal to (B × A)."
