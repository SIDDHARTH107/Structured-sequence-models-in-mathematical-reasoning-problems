We can find the first few terms of the sequence as follows:\n\nS(3) = S(1) + S(2) = 1 + 2 = 3\nS(4) = S(2) + S(3) = 2 + 3 = 5\nS(5) = S(3) + S(4) = 3 + 5 = 8\nS(6) = S(4) + S(5) = 5 + 8 = 13\nS(7) = S(5) + S(6) = 8 + 13 = 21\nS(8) = S(6) + S(7) = 13 + 21 = 34\nS(9) = S(7) + S(8) = 21 + 34 = 55\nS(10) = S(8) + S(9) = 34 + 55 = 89\n\nSo, the 10th term of the sequence is 89."
