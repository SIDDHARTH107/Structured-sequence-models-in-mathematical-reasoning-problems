    "message_1": "Consider the statement \"All cats are mammals.\" Using predicate logic, translate this statement into a symbolic form and provide the truth value for the following predicate: \n\nP(x) : x is a cat\nQ(x) : x is a mammal \n\n∀x(P(x) → Q(x))\n\nWhat is the truth value of the above statement when x is the set of all mammals?",
    "message_2": "The given statement \"All cats are mammals\" can be translated into predicate logic as ∀x(P(x) → Q(x)), where P(x) represents \"x is a cat\" and Q(x) represents \"x is a mammal.\"\n\nNow, we need to find the truth value of this statement when x is the set of all mammals.\n\nFor the statement ∀x(P(x) → Q(x)) to be true, it must hold for all elements in the set of all mammals. Since all cats are mammals, whenever P(x) is true (i.e., x is a cat), Q(x) will also be true (i.e., x is a mammal). For other mammals that are not cats, P(x) will be false, but the implication P(x) → Q(x) will still be true, because a false statement implies anything.\n\nTherefore, the truth value of the statement ∀x(P(x) → Q(x)) when x is the set of all mammals is True."
