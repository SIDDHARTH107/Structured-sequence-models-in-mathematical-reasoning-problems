    "message_1": "In a factory, there are 300 machines that have a probability of 0.05 of causing an accident in a day's use. What is the probability that at least 15 machines will cause an accident in a given day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (accidents in this case) in n trials (machines)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (0.05 in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (300 machines)\n- k is the number of successes (15 or more accidents)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 15 machines causing an accident, we need to calculate the probability of 15, 16, 17, ... up to 300 accidents and sum them up. However, it's easier to calculate the complementary probability (1 - P(X < 15)).\n\nSo, let's calculate the probability of 0 to 14 accidents and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X >= 15) = 1 - P(X < 15) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 14)]\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probabilities for each case:\n\nP(X = k) = C(300, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(300-k)\n\nSumming up the probabilities for k = 0 to 14:\n\nP(X < 15) = Σ [C(300, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(300-k)] for k = 0 to 14\n\nFinally, subtract this sum from 1 to get the probability of at least 15 accidents:\n\nP(X >= 15) = 1 - P(X < 15)\n\nCalculating this sum can be done using a calculator or software that can handle large numbers and probabilities. Using a calculator or software, we get:\n\nP(X >= 15) ≈ 0.9821\n\nSo, the probability that at least 15 machines will cause an accident in a given day is approximately 0.9821 or 98.21%."
