Determine the Lie derivative of vector field $Y$ with respect to vector field $X$ on $M$, i.e., find $\\mathcal{L}_X Y (x,y)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of vector field $Y$ with respect to vector field $X$, we use the following formula:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X Y = [X, Y] = XY - YX$$\n\nwhere $[X, Y]$ denotes the Lie bracket of the vector fields $X$ and $Y$. The Lie bracket is a measure of how the vector fields fail to commute.\n\nFirst, let's compute the action of $X$ on $Y$:\n\n$$XY = X(x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}) = X(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + x X(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y})$$\n\nSince $X(x) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$, we have:\n\n$$X(x) = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x} = 1$$\n\nand\n\n$$X(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}) = 0$$\n\nbecause the partial derivatives commute. Thus,\n\n$$XY = 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + x \\cdot 0 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$$\n\nNow, let's compute the action of $Y$ on $X$:\n\n$$YX = Y(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}) = xY(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x})$$\n\nSince $Y(x) = x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$, we have:\n\n$$Y(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}) = x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}) = x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}) = x\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y}$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$YX = x\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the Lie bracket $[X, Y] = XY - YX$:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X Y = [X, Y] = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} - x\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y}$$\n\nSo, the Lie derivative of vector field $Y$ with respect to vector field $X$ on $M$ is:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X Y (x,y) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} - x\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y}$$"
