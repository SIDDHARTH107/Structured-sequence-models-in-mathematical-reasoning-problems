    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed inside the cube, its diameter is equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half the side length of the cube:\n\nRadius = (Side length of cube) / 2\nRadius = 6 cm / 2\nRadius = 3 cm\n\nNow we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * (radius^3)\nVolume = (4/3) * π * (3 cm)^3\nVolume = (4/3) * π * 27 cm³\nVolume ≈ 36π cm³\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 113 cm³."
