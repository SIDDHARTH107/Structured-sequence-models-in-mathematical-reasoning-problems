    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of the seventh term in the expansion of (3x + 2y)^{10}, we can use Pascal's triangle and the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:\n\n(a + b)^n = C(n, 0) * a^n * b^0 + C(n, 1) * a^(n-1) * b^1 + ... + C(n, n) * a^0 * b^n\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using Pascal's triangle.\n\nIn our case, a = 3x, b = 2y, and n = 10. We want to find the coefficient of the seventh term, which corresponds to k = 6 (since the first term has k = 0).\n\nUsing Pascal's triangle, we can find the binomial coefficient C(10, 6) = 210.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the binomial theorem:\n\n(3x + 2y)^{10} = ... + C(10, 6) * (3x)^(10-6) * (2y)^6 + ...\n\nThe coefficient of the seventh term is:\n\n210 * (3^4) * (2^6) = 210 * 81 * 64 = 1088640\n\nSo, the coefficient of the seventh term in the expansion of (3x + 2y)^{10} is 1,088,640."
