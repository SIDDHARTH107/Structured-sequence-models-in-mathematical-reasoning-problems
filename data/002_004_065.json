    "message_2": "The perimeter of a rectangle can be found using the formula P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width. \n\nGiven the length (L) is 9 cm and the width (W) is 5 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = 2(9 + 5)\nP = 2(14)\nP = 28 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 28 cm."
