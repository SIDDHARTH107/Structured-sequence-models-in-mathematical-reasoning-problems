    "message_2": "To find the roots of the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 + 5x + 3, we need to find the values of x when y = 0. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 2, b = 5, and c = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(5) ± √((5)^2 - 4(2)(3))) / 2(2)\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± √(1)) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± 1) / 4\n\nNow we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (-5 + 1) / 4 = -4 / 4 = -1\n\nx = (-5 - 1) / 4 = -6 / 4 = -3/2\n\nSo, the roots of the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 + 5x + 3 are x = -1 and x = -3/2."
