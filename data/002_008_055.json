    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of a right circular cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base, h is the height, and π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nGiven that the base diameter is 8 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 4 cm. The height (h) is given as 10 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(4 cm)²(10 cm)\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(16 cm²)(10 cm)\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(160 cm³)\n\nVolume ≈ (1/3)(3.14159)(160 cm³)\n\nVolume ≈ (1.047197)(160 cm³)\n\nVolume ≈ 167.55168 cm³\n\nThe volume of the right circular cone is approximately 167.55 cm³."
