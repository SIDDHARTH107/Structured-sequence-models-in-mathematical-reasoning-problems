    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of a torus with one cross-cap removed, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. First, let's recall the fundamental group of a torus and a projective plane.\n\nThe fundamental group of a torus T is given by the direct product of two copies of the integers, i.e., π₁(T) = ℤ × ℤ. The fundamental group of the real projective plane RP² is given by π₁(RP²) = ℤ₂, where ℤ₂ is the group of integers modulo 2.\n\nNow, let's consider a torus with one cross-cap removed. We can think of this space as a torus with a small open disk removed and then a cross-cap added to the boundary of the removed disk. Let's call this space X.\n\nTo apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, we need to decompose X into two open, path-connected subspaces U and V such that their intersection U ∩ V is also path-connected. We can choose U to be the torus with a small open disk removed (which is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of two circles, i.e., S¹ ∨ S¹) and V to be a small neighborhood of the cross-cap. Then, U ∩ V is a small annulus surrounding the cross-cap, which is path-connected.\n\nThe fundamental group of U is π₁(U) = π₁(S¹ ∨ S¹) = ℤ * ℤ, where * denotes the free product of groups. The fundamental group of V is π₁(V) = ℤ₂, and the fundamental group of U ∩ V is π₁(U ∩ V) = ℤ.\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem to compute the fundamental group of X:\n\nπ₁(X) = (π₁(U) * π₁(V)) / N, where N is the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form i(u) * i(v)^(-1), with i(u) ∈ π₁(U) and i(v) ∈ π₁(V) representing the same element in π₁(U ∩ V).\n\nSince the intersection U ∩ V is an annulus, the inclusion maps i(u) and i(v) are both surjective. Therefore, N is generated by elements of the form a * b^(-1), where a, b ∈ ℤ. This means that N is isomorphic to ℤ, and we can write the fundamental group of X as:\n\nπ₁(X) = (ℤ * ℤ₂) / ℤ.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the free product of groups with amalgamation (i.e., the quotient of the free product by a normal subgroup) is isomorphic to the free product when the normal subgroup is trivial. In this case, the normal subgroup is not trivial, so the fundamental group of X is non-abelian.\n\nIn conclusion, the fundamental group of a torus with one cross-cap removed is a non-abelian group given by the free product with amalgamation:\n\nπ₁(X) = (ℤ * ℤ₂) / ℤ."
