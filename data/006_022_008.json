    "message_1": "A school has 60 students in a class. The probability of each student passing the math exam is 0.9. What is the probability that at least 55 students pass the math exam?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 55 students pass the math exam, we can use the binomial probability formula. The probability of exactly k successes in n trials is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nIn this case, n = 60 (number of students), p = 0.9 (probability of passing), and we want to find the probability of at least 55 students passing, so we need to calculate the probabilities for k = 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, and 60, and then sum them up.\n\nP(X ≥ 55) = P(X = 55) + P(X = 56) + P(X = 57) + P(X = 58) + P(X = 59) + P(X = 60)\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula for each k value:\n\nP(X = 55) = C(60, 55) * 0.9^55 * 0.1^5\nP(X = 56) = C(60, 56) * 0.9^56 * 0.1^4\nP(X = 57) = C(60, 57) * 0.9^57 * 0.1^3\nP(X = 58) = C(60, 58) * 0.9^58 * 0.1^2\nP(X = 59) = C(60, 59) * 0.9^59 * 0.1^1\nP(X = 60) = C(60, 60) * 0.9^60 * 0.1^0\n\nNow we can calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 55) ≈ 0.177\nP(X = 56) ≈ 0.267\nP(X = 57) ≈ 0.267\nP(X = 58) ≈ 0.178\nP(X = 59) ≈ 0.078\nP(X = 60) ≈ 0.012\n\nFinally, sum up the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 55) ≈ 0.177 + 0.267 + 0.267 + 0.178 + 0.078 + 0.012 ≈ 0.979\n\nSo, the probability that at least 55 students pass the math exam is approximately 0.979 or 97.9%."
