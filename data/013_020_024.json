    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a potential problem for the student to solve:\n\nIn a Beauty Contest Game, there are 10 participants who must choose a number between 1 and 100. The winner of the game is the participant whose number is closest to a number that is two-thirds the average of all selected numbers. What number should you choose to maximize your chances of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "Let's assume that all the participants, including you, choose their numbers randomly and independently. We will use the concept of expected value to determine the best number to choose.\n\nLet X be the average of the numbers chosen by the other 9 participants. The winning number will be 2/3 * X. Since the numbers are chosen randomly and independently, we can assume that X follows a uniform distribution between 1 and 100. Therefore, the expected value of X is:\n\nE(X) = (1 + 100) / 2 = 50.5\n\nNow, we need to find the expected winning number, which is 2/3 * E(X):\n\nE(Winning Number) = 2/3 * 50.5 â‰ˆ 33.67\n\nSo, to maximize your chances of winning the game, you should choose the number 34, as it is the closest integer to 33.67."
