    "message_2": "To find the area between the curves y = x² and y = 4x - 3 over the interval [0, 2], we need to first find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx² = 4x - 3\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to find the roots:\n\nx² - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\nThe roots are x = 1 and x = 3. However, since we are only considering the interval [0, 2], we will only use the intersection point at x = 1. At this point, the y-value is:\n\ny = 1² = 1\n\nNow, we will integrate the difference between the two curves over the interval [0, 2]:\n\nArea = ∫(4x - 3 - x²) dx from 0 to 1 + ∫(x² - (4x - 3)) dx from 1 to 2\n\nCalculate the first integral:\n\nArea = [2x² - 3x - (1/3)x³] from 0 to 1\n\n= (2(1)² - 3(1) - (1/3)(1)³) - (2(0)² - 3(0) - (1/3)(0)³)\n= 2 - 3 - 1/3\n= -1 - 1/3\n= -4/3\n\nCalculate the second integral:\n\nArea = [(1/3)x³ - 2x² + 4x] from 1 to 2\n\n= [(1/3)(2)³ - 2(2)² + 4(2)] - [(1/3)(1)³ - 2(1)² + 4(1)]\n= (8/3 - 8 + 8) - (1/3 - 2 + 4)\n= (8/3 - 1/3) + 3\n= 7/3 + 3\n= 7/3 + 9/3\n= 16/3\n\nNow, add the absolute values of the two areas:\n\nTotal Area = |-4/3| + |16/3| = 4/3 + 16/3 = 20/3\n\nSo, the area between the curves y = x² and y = 4x - 3 over the interval [0, 2] is 20/3 square units."
