    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures and their corresponding principal directions at the point (1,1,0), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's start by parameterizing the surface with parameters u and v:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - v^4)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, -4v^3)\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, -12v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u ‚Ä¢ r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u ‚Ä¢ r_v = 0\nG = r_v ‚Ä¢ r_v = 1 + 16v^6\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\ne = r_uu ‚Ä¢ N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 16v^6)\nf = r_uv ‚Ä¢ N = 0\ng = r_vv ‚Ä¢ N = -12v^2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 16v^6)\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures k1 and k2 by solving the following equation:\n\ndet(II - kI) = 0\n\nwhere II is the second fundamental form matrix and I is the first fundamental form matrix.\n\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n\n(eg - f^2) - k(eG + gE - 2fF) + k^2(EF - G) = 0\n\nPlugging in the values at the point (1,1,0):\n\n(2*(-12) - 0) - k(2 + 12 - 0) + k^2(1 - 1) = 0\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\nk1 = -24\nk2 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the principal directions. We can do this by finding the eigenvectors of the shape operator matrix S:\n\nS = [e  f] = [  2   0]\n      [f  g]   [  0 -12]\n\nThe eigenvector corresponding to k1 = -24 is:\n\nv1 = (0, 1)\n\nThe eigenvector corresponding to k2 = 0 is:\n\nv2 = (1, 0)\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1,1,0) are k1 = -24 and k2 = 0, and their corresponding principal directions are v1 = (0, 1) and v2 = (1, 0)."
