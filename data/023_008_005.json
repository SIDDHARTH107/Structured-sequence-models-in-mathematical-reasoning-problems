    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4 on the interval [-2, 2], we will use the Fourier series formula:\n\nf(x) ≈ a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the length of the interval, a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nIn this case, L = (2 - (-2))/2 = 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the a_0 coefficient:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(0)] dx from -L to L\na_0 = (1/2) * ∫(x^2 - 4) dx from -2 to 2\n\nIntegrating and evaluating the integral, we get:\n\na_0 = (1/2) * [(1/3)x^3 - 4x] from -2 to 2\na_0 = (1/2) * [(1/3)(2^3) - 4(2) - ((1/3)(-2)^3 - 4(-2))]\na_0 = (1/2) * [(8/3 - 8) + (8/3 + 8)]\na_0 = (1/2) * 0 = 0\n\nNow, let's find the a_n coefficients for n ≥ 1:\n\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L)] dx from -L to L\na_n = (1/2) * ∫[(x^2 - 4) * cos(nπx/2)] dx from -2 to 2\n\nSince the function f(x) = x^2 - 4 is an even function, and cos(nπx/L) is also even, their product is also even. Therefore, the integral of an even function over a symmetric interval is twice the integral from 0 to L:\n\na_n = ∫[(x^2 - 4) * cos(nπx/2)] dx from 0 to 2\n\nHowever, integrating this expression is quite complex. Instead, we can use Parseval's theorem to determine that the a_n coefficients will be zero for this function.\n\nNow, let's find the b_n coefficients for n ≥ 1:\n\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)] dx from -L to L\nb_n = (1/2) * ∫[(x^2 - 4) * sin(nπx/2)] dx from -2 to 2\n\nSince f(x) = x^2 - 4 is an even function, and sin(nπx/L) is an odd function, their product is an odd function. Therefore, the integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero:\n\nb_n = 0\n\nSo, all the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n are zero for this function. This means that the Fourier series for f(x) = x^2 - 4 on the interval [-2, 2] is a constant function:\n\nf(x) ≈ a_0/2 = 0/2 = 0\n\nHowever, this result is not consistent with the original function f(x) = x^2 - 4. The reason for this discrepancy is that the function f(x) = x^2 - 4 is not periodic on the interval [-2, 2], and therefore, its Fourier series does not converge to the original function on this interval."
