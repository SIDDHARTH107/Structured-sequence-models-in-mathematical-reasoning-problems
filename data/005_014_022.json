    "message_1": "A factor analysis study was conducted on a set of 20 variables. After extracting the factors, it was found that the first two factors explain 60% and 25% of the total variance, respectively. What is the total percentage of variance explained by these two factors combined?",
    "message_2": "To find the total percentage of variance explained by these two factors combined, simply add the percentages of each factor:\n\n60% (Factor 1) + 25% (Factor 2) = 85%\n\nSo, the first two factors combined explain 85% of the total variance."
