    "message_1": "Consider a transposition cipher where the key is a permutation of the integers from 1 to 7. If the plaintext message \"MATHEMATICS\" is encrypted using this cipher and results in the ciphertext \"ATMASETICMH\", what is the key used for encryption?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the permutation of the integers from 1 to 7 that was used to rearrange the letters in the plaintext message \"MATHEMATICS\" to obtain the ciphertext \"ATMASETICMH\".\n\nFirst, let's write down the plaintext message and the ciphertext message in a table format:\n\n```\nPlaintext:  M  A  T  H  E  M  A  T  I  C  S\nCiphertext: A  T  M  A  S  E  T  I  C  M  H\n```\n\nNow, let's try to find the permutation that was used to rearrange the letters. We can start by looking at the first letter of the ciphertext, which is 'A'. In the plaintext message, the first 'A' appears in the second position. So, the first element of the permutation is 2.\n\nNext, let's look at the second letter of the ciphertext, which is 'T'. In the plaintext message, the first 'T' appears in the third position. So, the second element of the permutation is 3.\n\nContinuing this process for the rest of the ciphertext, we can find the entire permutation:\n\n```\nCiphertext: A  T  M  A  S  E  T  I  C  M  H\nPermutation: 2  3  1  7  6  4  5  9  8  11 10\n```\n\nHowever, we need to find the permutation of the integers from 1 to 7. Since the plaintext message has 11 characters, we need to divide it into two blocks of 7 and 4 characters, respectively:\n\n```\nBlock 1: M  A  T  H  E  M  A\nBlock 2: T  I  C  S\n```\n\nNow, let's apply the permutation we found to these blocks:\n\n```\nBlock 1: M  A  T  H  E  M  A\nPermutation: 2  3  1  7  6  4  5\nCiphertext: A  T  M  A  S  E  T\n\nBlock 2: T  I  C  S\nPermutation: 2  3  1  7\nCiphertext: I  C  M  H\n```\n\nSo, the key used for encryption is the permutation (2, 3, 1, 7, 6, 4, 5)."
