    "message_1": "A two-player combinatorial game starts with a pile of 100 stones. Players take turns removing stones from the pile, with each player allowed to remove either 1, 3, or 5 stones per turn. The player who takes the last stone wins the game. What is the optimal strategy for each player, and who will win the game with perfect play?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the game by working backwards from the end. We'll use the term \"winning position\" to describe a situation where the player whose turn it is can guarantee a win with perfect play, and \"losing position\" to describe a situation where the player whose turn it is will lose with perfect play, assuming their opponent also plays perfectly.\n\n1. If there is only 1, 3, or 5 stones left, it is a winning position, since the player can take all the remaining stones and win the game.\n2. If there are 2 stones left, it is a losing position, since the player can only take 1 stone, leaving their opponent with a winning position.\n3. If there are 4 stones left, it is a winning position, since the player can take 1 stone and leave their opponent with a losing position (3 stones).\n4. If there are 6 stones left, it is a winning position, since the player can take 5 stones and leave their opponent with a losing position (1 stone).\n5. If there are 7 stones left, it is a losing position, since any move will leave the opponent with a winning position (6, 4, or 2 stones).\n\nFrom this point, we can see a pattern emerging. Every time a player reaches a multiple of 7 (7, 14, 21, ...), they are in a losing position. This is because any move they make will leave their opponent with a winning position, and their opponent can then maintain this advantage by always leaving a multiple of 7 stones after their turn.\n\nSo, the optimal strategy for each player is to try to leave their opponent with a multiple of 7 stones after their turn. If a player starts their turn with a multiple of 7 stones, they are in a losing position and will lose with perfect play from both players.\n\nSince the game starts with 100 stones, which is not a multiple of 7, the first player (Player 1) can guarantee a win with perfect play. Player 1 should take 2 stones on their first turn, leaving 98 stones (a multiple of 7). From this point on, Player 1 can maintain the advantage by always leaving a multiple of 7 stones after their turn, ensuring that they will take the last stone and win the game."
