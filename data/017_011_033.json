    "message_2": "To find the distinct types of groups of order 12, we can use the Sylow Theorems. The order of the group is 12, which can be factored as 2^2 * 3. According to the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2, so n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since both are unique, they are normal in the group G. The group G is then the internal direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C12.\n\n2. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3, which is normal in G. The Sylow 2-subgroups are not normal, so G is not a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. However, the semi-direct product of P_2 and P_3 can be formed, which results in the dihedral group D6.\n\n3. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4, which is normal in G. The Sylow 3-subgroups are not normal, so G is not a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. However, the semi-direct product of P_2 and P_3 can be formed, which results in the alternating group A4.\n\n4. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4: In this case, neither the Sylow 2-subgroups nor the Sylow 3-subgroups are normal in G. However, this case does not result in a distinct group, as the groups formed in cases 2 and 3 already cover all possibilities.\n\nIn summary, there are three distinct types of groups of order 12:\n\n1. The cyclic group C12.\n2. The dihedral group D6.\n3. The alternating group A4.\n\nEach of these groups is isomorphic to one of the groups mentioned in the question."
