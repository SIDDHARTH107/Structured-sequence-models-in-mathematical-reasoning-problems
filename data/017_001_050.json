    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 4. We know that there are two possible groups of order 4 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cyclic group C4. Its elements can be represented as {1, a, a^2, a^3}, where a is a generator of the group. The multiplication table for C4 is as follows:\n\n```\n   |  1  a  a^2  a^3\n---+--------------\n 1 |  1  a  a^2  a^3\n a |  a a^2  a^3   1\na^2| a^2 a^3   1   a\na^3| a^3  1   a  a^2\n```\n\nNow, let's consider the Klein four-group V4. Its elements can be represented as {1, a, b, c}, where a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = 1 and ab = c, ba = c, ac = b, ca = b, bc = a, cb = a. The multiplication table for V4 is as follows:\n\n```\n   |  1  a  b  c\n---+--------------\n 1 |  1  a  b  c\n a |  a  1  c  b\n b |  b  c  1  a\n c |  c  b  a  1\n```\n\nTo determine whether G is isomorphic to C4 or V4, we need to analyze the properties of G. If G has an element of order 4, then G is isomorphic to C4. If all non-identity elements of G have order 2, then G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nLet's denote the elements of G as {1, x, y, z}. Since G has order 4, we know that the identity element 1 is in G. Now, we need to analyze the orders of x, y, and z.\n\n1. If there exists an element with order 4, then G is isomorphic to C4. Without loss of generality, let's assume x has order 4. Then, G = {1, x, x^2, x^3}, and the multiplication table of G will be the same as the multiplication table of C4.\n\n2. If all non-identity elements have order 2, then G is isomorphic to V4. In this case, we have x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = 1. Also, since G is a group, the product of any two distinct elements must be in G. Without loss of generality, let xy = z. Then, the multiplication table of G will be the same as the multiplication table of V4.\n\nIn conclusion, to determine whether G is isomorphic to C4 or V4, we need to analyze the orders of its non-identity elements. If there exists an element of order 4, then G is isomorphic to C4. If all non-identity elements have order 2, then G is isomorphic to V4."
