    "message_1": "Consider a triangle with vertices A(3,2), B(−4,−3) and C(−3,4). Divide this triangle into smaller triangles using a straight line passing through the midpoints of AB and AC. How many triangles are formed after the subdivision?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the midpoints of AB and AC.\n\nMidpoint of AB (M1) can be found using the midpoint formula:\nM1 = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\nM1 = ((3 + (-4))/2, (2 + (-3))/2)\nM1 = (-1/2, -1/2)\n\nMidpoint of AC (M2) can be found using the midpoint formula:\nM2 = ((x1 + x3)/2, (y1 + y3)/2)\nM2 = ((3 + (-3))/2, (2 + 4)/2)\nM2 = (0, 3)\n\nNow, we draw a straight line passing through M1 and M2. This line will divide the triangle ABC into two smaller triangles.\n\nSo, after the subdivision, there are 2 triangles formed."
