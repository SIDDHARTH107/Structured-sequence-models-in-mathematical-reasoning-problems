    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 1457 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random starting point x0 and a function f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod N, where N is the number we want to factor (in this case, N = 1457).\n2. Iterate the function f(x) to generate a sequence of numbers: x1 = f(x0), x2 = f(x1), x3 = f(x2), ...\n3. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between two numbers in the sequence and N: d = GCD(|xi - xj|, N).\n4. If d is a non-trivial factor of N (1 < d < N), then d is a factor of N. Otherwise, repeat steps 2-4 with a new starting point or function.\n\nLet's start with x0 = 2 and f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 1457.\n\n1. x1 = f(x0) = (2^2 + 1) mod 1457 = 5\n2. x2 = f(x1) = (5^2 + 1) mod 1457 = 26\n3. x3 = f(x2) = (26^2 + 1) mod 1457 = 677\n\nNow, let's calculate the GCD of the absolute differences and N:\n\n1. d1 = GCD(|x1 - x0|, 1457) = GCD(|5 - 2|, 1457) = GCD(3, 1457) = 1\n2. d2 = GCD(|x2 - x1|, 1457) = GCD(|26 - 5|, 1457) = GCD(21, 1457) = 1\n3. d3 = GCD(|x3 - x2|, 1457) = GCD(|677 - 26|, 1457) = GCD(651, 1457) = 13\n\nSince d3 is a non-trivial factor of 1457 (1 < 13 < 1457), the smallest prime factor of 1457 using Pollard's rho algorithm is 13."
