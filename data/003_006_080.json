The distance between the student and the boat is 100 meters. What is the height of the cliff? Use the law of sines to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the law of sines, we first need to create a triangle with the given information. Let's call the student's position A, the boat's position B, and the point on the ground directly below the student C. We have a right triangle ABC with angle CAB = 45 degrees, angle ACB = 90 degrees, and the distance AB = 100 meters.\n\nWe want to find the height of the cliff, which is the length of side AC. To use the law of sines, we need to find another angle in the triangle. Since it's a right triangle, we know that angle ABC = 180 - 90 - 45 = 45 degrees.\n\nNow we can apply the law of sines:\n\nsin(angle CAB) / side BC = sin(angle ABC) / side AC\n\nsin(45) / BC = sin(45) / AC\n\nSince sin(45) = 1 / √2, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(1 / √2) / BC = (1 / √2) / AC\n\nSince the triangle is an isosceles right triangle (both angles CAB and ABC are 45 degrees), sides AC and BC are equal in length. Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of side AC:\n\nAC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2\n\nSince AC = BC, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2 * AC^2 = AB^2\n\nNow we can plug in the given distance between the student and the boat (AB = 100 meters):\n\n2 * AC^2 = 100^2\n\n2 * AC^2 = 10000\n\nAC^2 = 5000\n\nAC = √5000 ≈ 70.71 meters\n\nSo, the height of the cliff is approximately 70.71 meters."
