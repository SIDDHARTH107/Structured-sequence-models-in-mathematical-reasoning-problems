    "message_2": "To show that \"$\\Box$P $\\rightarrow$ ($\\Box$Q $\\rightarrow$ $\\Box$R)\" is a valid inference in Deontic logic, we can use a proof by contradiction. \n\nAssume that the given statements are true, but the conclusion is false. That is, we assume that $\\Box$P and Q $\\rightarrow$ R are true, but $\\Box$P $\\rightarrow$ ($\\Box$Q $\\rightarrow$ $\\Box$R) is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion. If $\\Box$P $\\rightarrow$ ($\\Box$Q $\\rightarrow$ $\\Box$R) is false, then $\\Box$P must be true, and ($\\Box$Q $\\rightarrow$ $\\Box$R) must be false. \n\nFor ($\\Box$Q $\\rightarrow$ $\\Box$R) to be false, $\\Box$Q must be true, and $\\Box$R must be false.\n\nNow, let's use the given statement Q $\\rightarrow$ R. Since $\\Box$Q is true, Q must be true. And since Q $\\rightarrow$ R is true, R must also be true.\n\nHowever, we have a contradiction here. We assumed that $\\Box$R is false, which means it is not obligatory that R is true. But we just showed that R must be true based on the given statements. This contradiction implies that our assumption that the conclusion is false must be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"$\\Box$P $\\rightarrow$ ($\\Box$Q $\\rightarrow$ $\\Box$R)\" is a valid inference in Deontic logic."
