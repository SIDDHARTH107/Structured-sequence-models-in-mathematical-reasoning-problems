    "message_1": "A student wants to find the length of the equal sides of an isosceles triangle where the base measures 8 cm and the altitude measures 6 cm. What is the length of each equal side of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. Since the altitude bisects the base, it creates two right triangles with the altitude as the height and half of the base as one of the legs.\n\nLet's denote the length of each equal side as \"a\", half of the base as \"b\" (which is 4 cm), and the altitude as \"h\" (which is 6 cm).\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\na^2 = b^2 + h^2\n\nSubstitute the values of b and h:\n\na^2 = (4 cm)^2 + (6 cm)^2\na^2 = 16 cm^2 + 36 cm^2\na^2 = 52 cm^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of each equal side:\n\na = √(52 cm^2)\na ≈ 7.21 cm\n\nSo, the length of each equal side of the isosceles triangle is approximately 7.21 cm."
