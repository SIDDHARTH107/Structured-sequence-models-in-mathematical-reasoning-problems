    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product 1 and Product 2. Each Product 1 requires 2 units of resource A and 1 unit of resource B, while each Product 2 requires 1 unit of resource A and 3 units of resource B. The company has a total of 120 units of resource A and 90 units of resource B available for production. The profit for each Product 1 sold is $200, and for each Product 2 sold is $250. What is the optimal production quantity of each product that maximizes the company's profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Product 1 and y be the number of Product 2 produced.\n\nThe constraints for the resources are as follows:\n\n2x + y ≤ 120 (Resource A constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 90 (Resource B constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraints)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 200x + 250y\n\nWe will now solve this linear programming problem graphically.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 120\n   y ≤ -2x + 120\n\n2. x + 3y ≤ 90\n   y ≤ (-1/3)x + 30\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. The vertices of the feasible region are the points where the constraint lines intersect. These vertices are (0, 0), (0, 30), (45, 0), and (30, 20).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 200(0) + 250(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 30) = 200(0) + 250(30) = $7,500\n3. P(45, 0) = 200(45) + 250(0) = $9,000\n4. P(30, 20) = 200(30) + 250(20) = $11,000\n\nThe maximum profit of $11,000 is achieved when the company produces 30 units of Product 1 and 20 units of Product 2."
