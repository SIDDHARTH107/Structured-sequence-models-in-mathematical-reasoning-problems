    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products. Type A costs $6 per unit to produce and can be sold for $10 per unit while type B costs $8 per unit to produce and can be sold for $12 per unit. The company has a budget of $2000 to spend on production and can only produce up to 400 units in total. Using simulated annealing method, what is the maximum profit the company can make?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we need to define the objective function, constraints, and the initial solution. Then, we will iteratively search for better solutions by perturbing the current solution and accepting or rejecting the new solution based on the change in the objective function and a temperature parameter.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit = (number of type A units * $4) + (number of type B units * $4)\n\nConstraints:\n1. 6A + 8B <= 2000 (budget constraint)\n2. A + B <= 400 (production constraint)\n3. A >= 0, B >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nInitial solution: Start with producing only type A units (A = 333, B = 0)\n\nNow, we will iteratively search for better solutions using the simulated annealing method:\n\n1. Set initial temperature T and cooling rate alpha.\n2. Perturb the current solution by changing the number of type A and type B units.\n3. Calculate the change in profit (delta_profit) between the new solution and the current solution.\n4. If the new solution is better (delta_profit > 0), accept it. If the new solution is worse (delta_profit < 0), accept it with a probability of exp(delta_profit / T).\n5. Update the temperature T = alpha * T.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the temperature is below a certain threshold or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nAfter running the simulated annealing algorithm, we will obtain an optimal solution for the number of type A and type B units to produce. The maximum profit can be calculated using the objective function with the optimal solution.\n\nNote: The simulated annealing method is a heuristic optimization algorithm, and the solution obtained may not be the global optimum. However, it is often effective in finding good solutions for complex optimization problems."
