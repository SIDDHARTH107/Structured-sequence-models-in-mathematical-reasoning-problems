Let L be the line bundle on X corresponding to the divisor D = (0) + (1) + (infinite-point). Compute the third cohomology group H^3(X, L).",
    "message_2": "To compute the third cohomology group H^3(X, L), we can use the Serre duality theorem. For a smooth projective curve X of genus g and a line bundle L on X, the Serre duality states that:\n\nH^i(X, L) ≅ H^{1-i}(X, K_X ⊗ L^*),\n\nwhere K_X is the canonical bundle on X, L^* is the dual line bundle of L, and ⊗ denotes the tensor product of line bundles.\n\nIn our case, X is a complex projective curve of genus 2, and we want to compute H^3(X, L). Since the curve is of genus 2, we have:\n\nH^3(X, L) ≅ H^{-2}(X, K_X ⊗ L^*).\n\nHowever, for any line bundle M on X, the cohomology group H^i(X, M) is trivial for i < 0. Therefore, we have:\n\nH^3(X, L) ≅ H^{-2}(X, K_X ⊗ L^*) = 0.\n\nSo the third cohomology group H^3(X, L) is trivial."
