    "message_1": "Consider a metal rod of length 10 cm initially at a temperature of 100°C. The ends of the rod are kept at a constant temperature of 20°C. The heat transfer coefficient of the rod is 0.5 W/cm^2. If the Cross-sectional area of the rod is 2 cm^2 and the thermal conductivity of the rod material is 400 W/m°C. Find the temperature at the middle point of the rod after 5 minutes.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the 1D heat conduction equation, which is given by:\n\nΔT/Δx = -q / k\n\nwhere ΔT is the temperature difference across the rod, Δx is the distance along the rod, q is the heat flux, and k is the thermal conductivity of the rod material.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to the appropriate units:\n\nLength of the rod (L) = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nThermal conductivity (k) = 400 W/m°C\nCross-sectional area (A) = 2 cm^2 = 0.0002 m^2\nHeat transfer coefficient (h) = 0.5 W/cm^2 = 50 W/m^2\n\nNow, we can find the heat flux (q) using the formula:\n\nq = h * (T_initial - T_boundary)\n\nwhere T_initial is the initial temperature of the rod (100°C) and T_boundary is the temperature at the ends of the rod (20°C).\n\nq = 50 * (100 - 20) = 50 * 80 = 4000 W/m^2\n\nNow, we can find the temperature difference across the rod (ΔT) using the heat conduction equation:\n\nΔT/Δx = -q / k\n\nΔT = -q * Δx / k\n\nSince we want to find the temperature at the middle point of the rod, we will use Δx = L/2 = 0.05 m.\n\nΔT = -4000 * 0.05 / 400 = -0.5°C\n\nNow, we can find the temperature at the middle point of the rod (T_middle) by adding the temperature difference (ΔT) to the initial temperature (T_initial):\n\nT_middle = T_initial + ΔT = 100 - 0.5 = 99.5°C\n\nHowever, this is the temperature at the middle point of the rod at steady state. To find the temperature after 5 minutes, we need to consider the transient heat conduction equation. Unfortunately, solving the transient heat conduction equation requires more advanced mathematical techniques, such as Fourier series or numerical methods, which are beyond the scope of this answer.\n\nIn summary, the temperature at the middle point of the rod at steady state is 99.5°C. To find the temperature after 5 minutes, more advanced mathematical techniques are required."
