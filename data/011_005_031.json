    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the permutation formula, which is n!/(n-r)!, where n is the total number of members and r is the number of positions to be filled.\n\nIn this case, n = 6 (total members) and r = 3 (president, vice-president, and secretary).\n\nSo, the permutation formula is:\n\n6!/(6-3)!\n\n6!/(3)!\n\nNow, we calculate the factorials:\n\n6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n\nNow, we divide:\n\n720/6 = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 ways to assign a president, vice-president, and secretary from among the 6 members of the club."
