    "message_2": "To find the integral points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - 6x + 6$, we can try plugging in integer values for $x$ and see if we get a perfect square for $y^2$. \n\nLet's start by finding the possible range of $x$ values. Since $y^2 \\ge 0$, we have $x^3 - 6x + 6 \\ge 0$. This inequality can be factored as $x(x^2 - 6) \\ge -6$. For $x \\le -3$, the left side is positive, and for $x \\ge 3$, the left side is positive as well. So, we only need to check the integers in the range $-3 \\le x \\le 3$.\n\nNow, we can plug in these integer values for $x$ and see if we get a perfect square for $y^2$:\n\n1. $x = -3$: $y^2 = (-3)^3 - 6(-3) + 6 = 27 + 18 + 6 = 51$ (not a perfect square)\n2. $x = -2$: $y^2 = (-2)^3 - 6(-2) + 6 = -8 + 12 + 6 = 10$ (not a perfect square)\n3. $x = -1$: $y^2 = (-1)^3 - 6(-1) + 6 = -1 + 6 + 6 = 11$ (not a perfect square)\n4. $x = 0$: $y^2 = 0^3 - 6(0) + 6 = 6$ (not a perfect square)\n5. $x = 1$: $y^2 = 1^3 - 6(1) + 6 = 1$ (a perfect square)\n6. $x = 2$: $y^2 = 2^3 - 6(2) + 6 = 8 - 12 + 6 = 2$ (not a perfect square)\n7. $x = 3$: $y^2 = 3^3 - 6(3) + 6 = 27 - 18 + 6 = 15$ (not a perfect square)\n\nSo, the only integral point on the curve is $(1, \\pm 1)$. The sum of all $x$-coordinates of the points on the curve that have integral coordinates is $1 + 1 = \\boxed{2}$."
