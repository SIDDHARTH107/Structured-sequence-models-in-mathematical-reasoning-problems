    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from an initial large square. In each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the central square is removed. \n\nLet's denote the total number of removed squares after the nth iteration as R(n). After the 1st iteration, we remove 1 square, so R(1) = 1. \n\nFor the 2nd iteration, we remove the central square from each of the remaining 8 squares, so we remove 8 squares. The total number of removed squares after the 2nd iteration is R(2) = R(1) + 8 = 1 + 8 = 9.\n\nFor the 3rd iteration, we remove the central square from each of the remaining 8^2 = 64 squares, so we remove 64 squares. The total number of removed squares after the 3rd iteration is R(3) = R(2) + 64 = 9 + 64 = 73.\n\nFor the 4th iteration, we remove the central square from each of the remaining 8^3 = 512 squares, so we remove 512 squares. The total number of removed squares after the 4th iteration is R(4) = R(3) + 512 = 73 + 512 = 585.\n\nFor the 5th iteration, we remove the central square from each of the remaining 8^4 = 4096 squares, so we remove 4096 squares. The total number of removed squares after the 5th iteration is R(5) = R(4) + 4096 = 585 + 4096 = 4681.\n\nSo, the total number of squares in the Sierpinski carpet after the 5th iteration is 4681."
