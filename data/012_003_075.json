    "message_2": "To find the size of the maximum independent set in G, we can use the fact that the sum of the size of the maximum independent set (α(G)) and the minimum vertex cover (β(G)) is equal to the number of vertices in the graph (n).\n\nn = α(G) + β(G)\n\nWe know that the graph G has 9 vertices and 14 edges. We can use the inequality that states that the minimum vertex cover (β(G)) is greater than or equal to twice the number of edges divided by the number of vertices:\n\nβ(G) ≥ 2 * |E| / |V|\n\nSubstituting the values for the number of vertices and edges:\n\nβ(G) ≥ 2 * 14 / 9\nβ(G) ≥ 28 / 9\n\nSince β(G) must be an integer, we can round up to the nearest integer:\n\nβ(G) ≥ 4\n\nNow, we can use the equation relating the maximum independent set, the minimum vertex cover, and the number of vertices:\n\n9 = α(G) + β(G)\n\nSubstituting the lower bound for β(G):\n\n9 = α(G) + 4\n\nSolving for α(G):\n\nα(G) = 9 - 4\nα(G) = 5\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set in G is 5."
