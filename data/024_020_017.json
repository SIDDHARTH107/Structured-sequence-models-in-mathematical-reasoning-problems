    "message_2": "To find the preimage of the point $(1,0,0)$ under the Hopf map, we need to find all points $(z,w) \\in S^3$ such that $h(z,w) = (1,0,0)$. This means we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n1. $|z|^2 - |w|^2 = 1$\n2. $2z\\bar{w} = 0$\n3. $2z\\bar{w}i = 0$\n\nFrom equation (2), we have $2z\\bar{w} = 0$. This implies that either $z = 0$ or $\\bar{w} = 0$. If $z = 0$, then from equation (1), we have $-|w|^2 = 1$, which is not possible since $|w|^2$ is non-negative. Therefore, we must have $\\bar{w} = 0$, which implies $w = 0$.\n\nNow, since $(z,w) \\in S^3$, we have $|z|^2 + |w|^2 = 1$. Since $w = 0$, we get $|z|^2 = 1$, which implies $|z| = 1$. So, $z$ must be a point on the unit circle in the complex plane. Let $z = e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the Hopf map as $h(z,0) = (1, 0, 0)$, which is true for any $z$ on the unit circle. Therefore, the preimage of the point $(1,0,0)$ under the Hopf map is the set of all points $(e^{i\\theta}, 0)$, where $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$."
