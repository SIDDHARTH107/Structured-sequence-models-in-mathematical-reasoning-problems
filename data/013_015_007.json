    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to game theory and the principal-agent problem:\n\nA CEO of a company employs an agent to make decisions regarding the company's investments. The agent has the ability to choose between two investment options - A and B. Option A has a 70% chance of generating $300,000 in profit for the company and a 30% chance of generating $150,000 in profit. Option B has a 50% chance of generating $250,000 in profit and a 50% chance of generating $200,000 in profit. The CEO's utility function for profit is U(x) = ln(x), where x is the profit in dollars. The agent's utility function is U(y) = 0.5ln(y) - 50, where y is the agent's salary in thousands of dollars.\n\nWhat investment option should the agent choose to maximize their own utility, while taking into account the CEO's preferences? Assume the CEO is risk-neutral.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the expected profit for each investment option for the company and the CEO's expected utility for each option. Then, we can determine the agent's salary based on the CEO's preferences and find the agent's utility for each option. Finally, we can compare the agent's utilities for both options to determine which one the agent should choose.\n\n1. Calculate the expected profit for each investment option:\n\nOption A:\nExpected profit = (0.7 * $300,000) + (0.3 * $150,000) = $210,000 + $45,000 = $255,000\n\nOption B:\nExpected profit = (0.5 * $250,000) + (0.5 * $200,000) = $125,000 + $100,000 = $225,000\n\n2. Calculate the CEO's expected utility for each option:\n\nOption A:\nCEO's expected utility = U(x) = ln($255,000) ≈ 12.45\n\nOption B:\nCEO's expected utility = U(x) = ln($225,000) ≈ 12.33\n\nSince the CEO is risk-neutral, they would prefer Option A as it has a higher expected utility.\n\n3. Determine the agent's salary based on the CEO's preferences:\n\nAssuming the CEO will pay the agent a salary proportional to the expected profit generated by the investment, we can calculate the agent's salary (y) as follows:\n\nAgent's salary (y) = k * Expected profit, where k is a constant proportionality factor.\n\nFor Option A, y_A = k * $255,000\nFor Option B, y_B = k * $225,000\n\n4. Calculate the agent's utility for each option:\n\nOption A:\nAgent's utility = U(y_A) = 0.5 * ln(y_A) - 50 = 0.5 * ln(k * $255,000) - 50\n\nOption B:\nAgent's utility = U(y_B) = 0.5 * ln(y_B) - 50 = 0.5 * ln(k * $225,000) - 50\n\n5. Compare the agent's utilities for both options:\n\nSince ln(x) is an increasing function, the agent's utility will be higher for the option with a higher salary. In this case, since the CEO prefers Option A and the agent's salary for Option A (y_A) is higher than for Option B (y_B), the agent should choose Option A to maximize their own utility while taking into account the CEO's preferences."
