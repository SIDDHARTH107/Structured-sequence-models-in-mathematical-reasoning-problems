    "message_1": "A piece of material is exposed to a heat flux of 10 kW/m² for a duration of 5 seconds. Determine the temperature variation across the material if its thermal diffusivity is 0.1 mm²/s and its thickness is 2 mm. Use the Fourier transform method to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Fourier transform method, we need to first determine the heat transfer through the material and then calculate the temperature variation across the material.\n\n1. Calculate the heat transfer through the material:\n\nHeat transfer (Q) = Heat flux (q) × Area (A) × Time (t)\nSince we are given the heat flux (q) in kW/m², we need to convert it to W/m²:\nq = 10 kW/m² × 1000 W/kW = 10000 W/m²\n\nWe are not given the area (A) of the material, but since we are interested in the temperature variation across the material, we can assume a unit area (1 m²) for simplicity.\n\nSo, the heat transfer (Q) through the material is:\nQ = 10000 W/m² × 1 m² × 5 s = 50000 J\n\n2. Calculate the temperature variation across the material:\n\nWe are given the thermal diffusivity (α) in mm²/s, so we need to convert it to m²/s:\nα = 0.1 mm²/s × (1 m/1000 mm)² = 1 × 10^(-7) m²/s\n\nThe thickness of the material (L) is given in mm, so we need to convert it to meters:\nL = 2 mm × (1 m/1000 mm) = 0.002 m\n\nNow, we can use the Fourier transform method to calculate the temperature variation (ΔT) across the material. The Fourier transform method states that:\n\nΔT = Q / (k × A × √(π × α × t))\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity of the material. However, we are not given the value of k. In this case, we can express the temperature variation in terms of the thermal conductivity:\n\nΔT = 50000 J / (k × 1 m² × √(π × 1 × 10^(-7) m²/s × 5 s))\n\nΔT = 50000 J / (k × 1 m² × √(5 × 10^(-7) × π))\n\nΔT ≈ 50000 J / (k × 1 m² × 3.98 × 10^(-4))\n\nΔT ≈ 125628.14 J / (k × 1 m²)\n\nSo, the temperature variation across the material is approximately 125628.14 J/m² divided by the thermal conductivity (k) of the material. To obtain a specific value for the temperature variation, the thermal conductivity of the material would need to be provided."
