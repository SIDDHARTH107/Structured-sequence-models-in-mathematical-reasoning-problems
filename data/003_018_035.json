    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = 5sin(x) + 2cos(x), we can use the following rules:\n\n1. The derivative of a constant times a function is the constant times the derivative of the function.\n2. The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x).\n3. The derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x).\n\nUsing these rules, we can find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [5sin(x) + 2cos(x)]\nf'(x) = 5 d/dx [sin(x)] + 2 d/dx [cos(x)]\nf'(x) = 5cos(x) - 2sin(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of f'(x) at x = π/3:\n\nf'(π/3) = 5cos(π/3) - 2sin(π/3)\nf'(π/3) = 5(1/2) - 2(√3/2)\nf'(π/3) = 5/2 - √3\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 5sin(x) + 2cos(x) at x = π/3 is f'(π/3) = 5/2 - √3."
