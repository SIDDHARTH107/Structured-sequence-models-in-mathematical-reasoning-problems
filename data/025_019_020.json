    "message_2": "A Fano threefold of genus 6 embedded in projective 4-space is a smooth cubic threefold, which means it is a three-dimensional variety defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 in five variables.\n\nThe degree of a line on a Fano threefold of genus 6 embedded in projective 4-space is the intersection number of the line with the threefold. Since the threefold is cubic, the degree of a line on it is 3."
