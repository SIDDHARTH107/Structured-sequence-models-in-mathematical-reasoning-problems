    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the second equation by 3 and add it to the third equation:\n\n(3)(-x + 2y + z) = 3(3)\n-3x + 6y + 3z = 9\n\nNow, add this to the third equation:\n(-3x + 6y + 3z) + (3x + 2y + 2z) = 9 + 1\n8y + 5z = 10\n\nNow, let's eliminate x from the first and second equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 1/2 and add it to the second equation:\n\n(1/2)(2x + 3y - z) = (1/2)(5)\nx + (3/2)y - (1/2)z = 5/2\n\nNow, add this to the second equation:\n(x + (3/2)y - (1/2)z) + (-x + 2y + z) = 5/2 + 3\n(5/2)y + (1/2)z = 11/2\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n8y + 5z = 10\n(5/2)y + (1/2)z = 11/2\n\nTo eliminate y, we can multiply the second equation by -8/5 and add it to the first equation:\n\n(-8/5)(5/2)y - (8/5)(1/2)z = -8/5(11/2)\n-4y - (4/5)z = -44/5\n\nNow, add this to the first equation:\n(8y + 5z) + (-4y - (4/5)z) = 10 - 44/5\n4y + (21/5)z = 6/5\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n4y = - (21/5)z + 6/5\ny = - (21/20)z + 3/10\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y back into the second equation:\n(5/2)(- (21/20)z + 3/10) + (1/2)z = 11/2\n\nNow, solve for z:\n- (21/4)z + (15/4) + (1/2)z = 11/2\n- (17/4)z + (15/4) = 11/2\n-17z + 15 = 22\n-17z = 7\nz = -7/17\n\nNow, substitute the value of z back into the expression for y:\ny = - (21/20)(-7/17) + 3/10\ny = (147/340) + 3/10\ny = (147 + 102)/340\ny = 249/340\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z back into the expression for x:\nx + (3/2)(249/340) - (1/2)(-7/17) = 5/2\nx = 5/2 - (3/2)(249/340) + (7/34)\nx = (5 - (747/340) + 7/34)\nx = (170 - 747 + 35)/340\nx = -542/340\nx = -271/170\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -271/170\ny = 249/340\nz = -7/17"
