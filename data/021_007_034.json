    "message_1": "Consider the equation f(x) = x^3 - x - 1. Use the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of this equation accurate to 4 decimal places. Start from the initial guess x0 = 1.5.",
    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - x - 1. The derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 1\n\nThe Newton-Raphson formula is:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nWe start with the initial guess x0 = 1.5 and iterate until we reach the desired accuracy of 4 decimal places.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = 1.5 - (1.5^3 - 1.5 - 1) / (3 * 1.5^2 - 1)\nx1 = 1.5 - (3.375 - 1.5 - 1) / (6.75 - 1)\nx1 = 1.5 - (0.875) / (5.75)\nx1 ≈ 1.3478\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = 1.3478 - (1.3478^3 - 1.3478 - 1) / (3 * 1.3478^2 - 1)\nx2 ≈ 1.3247\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = 1.3247 - (1.3247^3 - 1.3247 - 1) / (3 * 1.3247^2 - 1)\nx3 ≈ 1.3247\n\nSince x2 and x3 are the same up to 4 decimal places, we can conclude that the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - x - 1, accurate to 4 decimal places, is approximately x ≈ 1.3247."
