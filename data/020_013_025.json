    "message_2": "To express this linear programming problem as a semi-definite programming problem, we first introduce a new variable $t$ and rewrite the objective function as:\n\nmaximize: $t$\n\nsubject to:\n\n$3x_1 - x_2 - t = 0$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the constraints as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by introducing positive semi-definite matrices $X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4$:\n\n$X_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\succeq 0$\n\n$X_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 4-x_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\succeq 0$\n\n$X_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2+x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\succeq 0$\n\n$X_4 = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\succeq 0$\n\nThe semi-definite programming problem is now:\n\nmaximize: $t$\n\nsubject to:\n\n$3x_1 - x_2 - t = 0$\n\n$X_1 \\succeq 0$\n\n$X_2 \\succeq 0$\n\n$X_3 \\succeq 0$\n\n$X_4 \\succeq 0$\n\nNow, we can solve this semi-definite programming problem using a suitable solver, such as CVX or SDPT3. However, it is important to note that converting a linear programming problem to a semi-definite programming problem is not necessary and may lead to increased computational complexity. It is more efficient to solve the original linear programming problem using a linear programming solver like simplex method or interior-point method."
