    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function, we first need to find its first derivative and set it equal to zero. \n\nf(x) = 3x^4 - 16x^3 - 12x^2 + 96x + 9\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 48x^2 - 24x + 96\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0:\n\n12x^3 - 48x^2 - 24x + 96 = 0\n\nWe can simplify this by dividing by 12:\n\nx^3 - 4x^2 - 2x + 8 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this cubic equation. This can be challenging, but we can try factoring by grouping:\n\nx^3 - 4x^2 - 2x + 8 = (x^3 - 4x^2) + (-2x + 8)\n\nFactor out the common terms:\n\nx^2(x - 4) - 2(x - 4)\n\nNow, we can factor out the common binomial (x - 4):\n\n(x - 4)(x^2 - 2)\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 4 and the roots of x^2 - 2. The roots of x^2 - 2 are x = ±√2.\n\nNow, we need to determine if these critical points correspond to a local maximum, local minimum, or saddle point. To do this, we can use the second derivative test.\n\nFind the second derivative of f(x):\n\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 96x - 24\n\nNow, evaluate f''(x) at each critical point:\n\nf''(4) = 36(4)^2 - 96(4) - 24 = 576 - 384 - 24 = 168 > 0\nf''(√2) = 36(2) - 96(√2) - 24 = 72 - 96√2 - 24 < 0\nf''(-√2) = 36(2) + 96(√2) - 24 = 72 + 96√2 - 24 > 0\n\nSince f''(4) > 0 and f'(4) = 0, there is a local minimum at x = 4.\nSince f''(√2) < 0 and f'(√2) = 0, there is a local maximum at x = √2.\nSince f''(-√2) > 0 and f'(-√2) = 0, there is a local minimum at x = -√2.\n\nIn conclusion, the critical points of the function are x = 4, x = √2, and x = -√2. There is a local minimum at x = 4 and x = -√2, and a local maximum at x = √2."
