Assume the angle between the displacement vector and the Northward direction is θ = 37°. Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the projection of the hiker's displacement vector onto the Northward direction, we can use the formula:\n\nprojection = |displacement_vector| * cos(θ)\n\nFirst, we need to find the magnitude of the displacement vector. Since the hiker walks 25 meters West and then 30 meters North of East, we can represent the displacement vector as the sum of two vectors: one pointing West with a magnitude of 25 meters, and one pointing North of East with a magnitude of 30 meters.\n\nWe can represent the 30 meters North of East vector as the sum of two vectors: one pointing East with a magnitude of 30 * cos(37°) and one pointing North with a magnitude of 30 * sin(37°).\n\nNow, we can find the components of the displacement vector in the East-West and North-South directions:\n\nEast-West component: -25 + 30 * cos(37°)\nNorth-South component: 0 + 30 * sin(37°)\n\nNext, we can find the magnitude of the displacement vector:\n\n|displacement_vector| = sqrt((East-West component)^2 + (North-South component)^2)\n\nFinally, we can find the projection of the displacement vector onto the Northward direction:\n\nprojection = |displacement_vector| * cos(37°)\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n\nEast-West component: -25 + 30 * cos(37°) ≈ -25 + 30 * 0.7986 ≈ -5.04\nNorth-South component: 30 * sin(37°) ≈ 30 * 0.6018 ≈ 18.05\n\n|displacement_vector| = sqrt((-5.04)^2 + (18.05)^2) ≈ sqrt(25.2016 + 325.8025) ≈ sqrt(351.0041) ≈ 18.73\n\nprojection = 18.73 * cos(37°) ≈ 18.73 * 0.7986 ≈ 14.95\n\nThe projection of the hiker's displacement vector onto the Northward direction is approximately 14.95 meters."
