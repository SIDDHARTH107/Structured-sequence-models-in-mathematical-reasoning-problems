    "message_2": "In knot theory, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs to relate the number of edges (E), vertices (V), and faces (F) in a knot diagram. The formula is:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nFor a non-trivial knot with 6 edges, we can use this formula to find the minimum number of crossings. In a knot diagram, each crossing is represented by a vertex, and each edge connects two vertices. Since there are 6 edges, we have:\n\n2V = 2E = 12\n\nSo, V = 6. Now, we can plug this value into Euler's formula:\n\n6 - 6 + F = 2\n\nF = 2\n\nSince there are 2 faces, we can now determine the minimum number of crossings. In a non-trivial knot, each face must have at least 4 edges. Therefore, the minimum number of crossings (C) can be found by dividing the total number of edges by 2:\n\nC = E/2 = 6/2 = 3\n\nSo, the minimum number of crossings required for a non-trivial knot with 6 edges is 3."
