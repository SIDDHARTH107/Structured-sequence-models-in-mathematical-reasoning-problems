    "message_1": "A graph G has 7 vertices with degrees 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5. What is the number of edges in the graph G?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of edges in the graph G, we can use the Handshaking Theorem. The Handshaking Theorem states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nIn this case, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is:\n\n3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 25\n\nNow, applying the Handshaking Theorem:\n\n25 = 2 * (number of edges)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nnumber of edges = 25 / 2 = 12.5\n\nHowever, the number of edges must be an integer. There might be an error in the given degrees of the vertices, as they should result in an even sum. Please check the degrees of the vertices and provide the correct information."
