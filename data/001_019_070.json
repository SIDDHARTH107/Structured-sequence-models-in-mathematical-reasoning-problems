    "message_2": "To solve the equation |x - 3| = 5, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: x - 3 >= 0\nIn this case, |x - 3| = x - 3, so the equation becomes:\nx - 3 = 5\nx = 5 + 3\nx = 8\n\nCase 2: x - 3 < 0\nIn this case, |x - 3| = -(x - 3), so the equation becomes:\n-(x - 3) = 5\n- x + 3 = 5\n- x = 2\nx = -2\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 8 and -2."
