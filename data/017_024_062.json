Determine the number of possible abelian groups of order 96 using the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups: \n\n   For 2^5, there are 6 partitions: (5), (4,1), (3,2), (3,1,1), (2,2,1), and (1,1,1,1,1).\n   For 3^1, there is only 1 partition: (1).\n\n   Therefore, there are 6 * 1 = 6 possible abelian groups of order 96.\n\n3. Determine the number of possible non-abelian groups of order 96:\n\n   We can use the formula for the number of non-abelian groups of order p^nq^m, where p and q are distinct primes, and n and m are positive integers:\n\n   N(p^nq^m) = (n+1)(m+1) - N(p^n) - N(q^m) + 1\n\n   In our case, p = 2, n = 5, q = 3, and m = 1. So, we have:\n\n   N(2^5 * 3^1) = (5+1)(1+1) - N(2^5) - N(3^1) + 1\n                = 6 * 2 - 6 - 1 + 1\n                = 12 - 6\n                = 6\n\n   Therefore, there are 6 possible non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\n4. Add the number of abelian and non-abelian groups to find the total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96:\n\n   Total = 6 (abelian) + 6 (non-abelian) = 12\n\nThus, there are 12 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
