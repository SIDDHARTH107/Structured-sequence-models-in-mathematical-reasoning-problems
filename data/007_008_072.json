    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, we have a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nIn this case, we want to find the remainder when 5^7 is divided by 7. Since 7 is a prime number, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nAccording to the theorem, 5^(7-1) ≡ 1 (mod 7), which means 5^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7).\n\nNow, we can rewrite 5^7 as (5^6) * 5. Since we know that 5^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we can substitute this into the expression:\n\n(1) * 5 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the remainder when 5^7 is divided by 7 is 5."
