    "message_2": "To determine the dimension of the tangent space of S at a point corresponding to an elliptic curve with equation y^2 = x^3 + x, we first need to understand the moduli space of smooth elliptic curves with a marked point.\n\nAn elliptic curve is a smooth curve of genus 1 with a marked point, which is usually denoted as the base point O. The moduli space of elliptic curves with a marked point is a space that parametrizes isomorphism classes of such curves. In other words, each point in the moduli space corresponds to an isomorphism class of elliptic curves with a marked point.\n\nNow, let's consider the elliptic curve E given by the equation y^2 = x^3 + x. This curve is smooth and has genus 1, so it is an elliptic curve. We can take the marked point O to be the point at infinity.\n\nTo compute the dimension of the tangent space of S at the point corresponding to E, we need to compute the dimension of the space of infinitesimal deformations of E. This can be done using the deformation theory of smooth curves.\n\nThe deformation theory of smooth curves tells us that the dimension of the tangent space of the moduli space of smooth curves of genus g at a point corresponding to a curve C is given by the dimension of the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials on C, which is equal to 3g-3. In our case, g = 1, so the dimension of the tangent space of the moduli space of smooth curves at the point corresponding to E is 3(1)-3 = 0.\n\nHowever, we are considering the moduli space of elliptic curves with a marked point, not just the moduli space of smooth curves of genus 1. The marked point adds an additional degree of freedom to the moduli problem, so the dimension of the tangent space of S at the point corresponding to E is 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nThus, the dimension of the tangent space of S at a point corresponding to an elliptic curve with equation y^2 = x^3 + x is 1."
