    "message_2": "The Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from the original cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the center cube of each face and the center cube of the larger cube are removed. This leaves 20 smaller cubes in each iteration.\n\nFor the 4th iteration of the Menger sponge, we can calculate the total number of cubes as follows:\n\nIteration 1: 20 cubes\nIteration 2: 20^2 = 400 cubes\nIteration 3: 20^3 = 8,000 cubes\nIteration 4: 20^4 = 160,000 cubes\n\nSo, in the 4th iteration of the Menger sponge with an original side length of 3 units, there are a total of 160,000 cubes."
