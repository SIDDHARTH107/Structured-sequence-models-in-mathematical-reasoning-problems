Find the probability that the particle is in the interval [0.5, 1.5] meters when its energy is the ground state energy.

    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the wave function of the particle in the ground state and then calculate the probability of finding the particle in the interval [0.5, 1.5] meters.\n\n1. Solve the Schrödinger equation with boundary conditions:\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a 1-dimensional box is given by:\n\n- (ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) = E * ψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, ψ(x) is the wave function, and E is the energy of the particle.\n\nThe boundary conditions for a particle in a box of length L are:\n\nψ(0) = ψ(L) = 0\n\nFor our problem, the mass m = 0.5 kg and the length L = 2 meters.\n\n2. Find the wave function:\n\nThe general solution to the Schrödinger equation for a particle in a box is:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nψ(0) = A * sin(0) + B * cos(0) = B = 0\nψ(L) = A * sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the wave function would be trivial), we must have sin(kL) = 0. This implies that kL = nπ, where n is an integer. The ground state corresponds to the lowest energy, which occurs when n = 1. Therefore, k = π / L = π / 2.\n\nThe wave function for the ground state is:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(πx / 2)\n\nTo normalize the wave function, we need to find the constant A:\n\n∫[0, L] |ψ(x)|^2 dx = 1\n\n∫[0, 2] (A * sin(πx / 2))^2 dx = 1\n\nA^2 * ∫[0, 2] sin^2(πx / 2) dx = 1\n\nUsing the identity sin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x)) / 2, we get:\n\nA^2 * ∫[0, 2] (1 - cos(πx)) / 2 dx = 1\n\nA^2 * [x/2 - (1/π) * sin(πx) / 2]_0^2 = 1\n\nA^2 * (2/2 - 0) = 1\n\nA = 1\n\nThus, the normalized wave function for the ground state is:\n\nψ(x) = sin(πx / 2)\n\n3. Calculate the probability:\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval [0.5, 1.5] meters is given by:\n\nP = ∫[0.5, 1.5] |ψ(x)|^2 dx\n\nP = ∫[0.5, 1.5] sin^2(πx / 2) dx\n\nUsing the identity sin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x)) / 2, we get:\n\nP = ∫[0.5, 1.5] (1 - cos(πx)) / 2 dx\n\nP = [x/2 - (1/π) * sin(πx) / 2]_0.5^1.5\n\nP = (1/2 - 1/(2π)) - (1/4 + 1/(4π))\n\nP = 1/4 - 1/(4π)\n\nTherefore, the probability of finding the particle in the interval [0.5, 1.5] meters when its energy is the ground state energy is approximately 0.204."
