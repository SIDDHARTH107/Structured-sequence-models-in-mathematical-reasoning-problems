    "message_2": "To evaluate the second-order logical sentence (∀X)[(X ⊆ A ∧ X ≠ A) → ∃Y (Y ∈ X ∧ Y ∉ A)] when A = {a, {b}}, we need to consider all subsets of A and check if the logical sentence holds true for each of them.\n\nThe subsets of A are:\n1. Ø (the empty set)\n2. {a}\n3. {{b}}\n4. {a, {b}} (which is equal to A)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the logical sentence for each subset:\n\n1. For X = Ø, the condition (X ⊆ A ∧ X ≠ A) is false, since X = Ø is a subset of A, but it is not different from A. Therefore, the implication is true (since a false antecedent implies a true consequent).\n\n2. For X = {a}, the condition (X ⊆ A ∧ X ≠ A) is true, since X is a subset of A and different from A. Now, we need to find a Y such that (Y ∈ X ∧ Y ∉ A). In this case, there is no such Y, since the only element in X is 'a', which is also in A. Therefore, the implication is false.\n\nSince we found a subset X for which the logical sentence is false, the overall value of the second-order logical sentence (∀X)[(X ⊆ A ∧ X ≠ A) → ∃Y (Y ∈ X ∧ Y ∉ A)] is false."
