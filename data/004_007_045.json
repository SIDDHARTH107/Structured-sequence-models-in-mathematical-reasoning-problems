    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the composite function h(x) = f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, multiplied by the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is f(u) = (2u+5)^3 and the inner function is u = g(x) = (x^2 - 3x - 1)^2.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivatives of f(u) and g(x) with respect to u and x, respectively:\n\nf'(u) = d(2u+5)^3/du = 3(2u+5)^2 * 2 = 6(2u+5)^2\ng'(x) = d(x^2 - 3x - 1)^2/dx = 2(x^2 - 3x - 1) * (2x - 3)\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule to find the derivative of h(x) = f(g(x)):\n\nh'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nSubstitute f'(u) and g'(x) into the equation:\n\nh'(x) = 6(2g(x)+5)^2 * 2(x^2 - 3x - 1) * (2x - 3)\n\nNow, substitute g(x) back into the equation:\n\nh'(x) = 6(2(x^2 - 3x - 1)^2 + 5)^2 * 2(x^2 - 3x - 1) * (2x - 3)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\nh'(2) = 6(2(2^2 - 3*2 - 1)^2 + 5)^2 * 2(2^2 - 3*2 - 1) * (2*2 - 3)\n\nh'(2) = 6(2(4 - 6 - 1)^2 + 5)^2 * 2(4 - 6 - 1) * (4 - 3)\n\nh'(2) = 6(2(-3)^2 + 5)^2 * 2(-3) * (1)\n\nh'(2) = 6(2(9) + 5)^2 * (-6)\n\nh'(2) = 6(23)^2 * (-6)\n\nh'(2) = -6 * 529 * 6\n\nh'(2) = -19854\n\nSo, the derivative of the composite function h(x) = f(g(x)) evaluated at x = 2 is h'(2) = -19854."
