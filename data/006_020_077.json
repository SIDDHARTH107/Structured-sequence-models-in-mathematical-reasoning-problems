    "message_1": "In a community of 500 people, 300 are adults and 200 are teenagers. If the probability of an adult attending a social event is 0.4 and the probability of a teenager attending the same event is 0.6, what is the probability that at least 350 people will attend the event?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 350 people will attend the event, we can use the binomial probability formula. However, since the number of people is quite large, it's more convenient to use a normal approximation to the binomial distribution.\n\nFirst, let's find the expected number of attendees and the standard deviation.\n\nExpected number of adult attendees (μ1) = 300 * 0.4 = 120\nExpected number of teenager attendees (μ2) = 200 * 0.6 = 120\n\nTotal expected attendees (μ) = μ1 + μ2 = 120 + 120 = 240\n\nVariance of adult attendees (σ1^2) = 300 * 0.4 * (1 - 0.4) = 72\nVariance of teenager attendees (σ2^2) = 200 * 0.6 * (1 - 0.6) = 48\n\nTotal variance (σ^2) = σ1^2 + σ2^2 = 72 + 48 = 120\nStandard deviation (σ) = √120 ≈ 10.95\n\nNow, we'll use the normal approximation to find the probability that at least 350 people will attend the event. We'll calculate the z-score for 350 attendees:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ = (350 - 240) / 10.95 ≈ 10.05\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score being greater than 10.05 is extremely close to 0. Therefore, the probability that at least 350 people will attend the event is approximately 0, or virtually impossible."
