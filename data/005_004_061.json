    "message_1": "In a study of three different teaching methods, a math teacher randomly assigns 10 students to each method. After completing the course, the teacher records the final exam scores for each group. The scores are as follows:\n\n- Method 1: 78, 84, 72, 81, 87, 82, 73, 79, 76, 80\n- Method 2: 85, 81, 89, 90, 86, 84, 88, 81, 83, 82\n- Method 3: 76, 72, 79, 75, 80, 71, 77, 73, 74, 78\n\nIs there a significant difference in the mean exam scores between the three teaching methods at a 5% significance level? Use ANOVA to test your hypothesis.",
    "message_2": "To perform an ANOVA test, we need to calculate the following values:\n\n1. Mean of each group (Method 1, Method 2, and Method 3)\n2. Overall mean of all scores\n3. Sum of Squares Within (SSW)\n4. Sum of Squares Between (SSB)\n5. Mean Squares Within (MSW)\n6. Mean Squares Between (MSB)\n7. F-statistic\n8. Compare F-statistic to F-critical value\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean of each group:\n\nMethod 1: (78+84+72+81+87+82+73+79+76+80)/10 = 792/10 = 79.2\nMethod 2: (85+81+89+90+86+84+88+81+83+82)/10 = 849/10 = 84.9\nMethod 3: (76+72+79+75+80+71+77+73+74+78)/10 = 765/10 = 76.5\n\nStep 2: Calculate the overall mean:\n\n(792 + 849 + 765) / 30 = 2406 / 30 = 80.2\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Sum of Squares Within (SSW):\n\nSSW = Σ(Σ(x_ij - mean_i)^2)\nFor Method 1: Σ(78-79.2)^2 + ... + (80-79.2)^2 = 178.8\nFor Method 2: Σ(85-84.9)^2 + ... + (82-84.9)^2 = 131.9\nFor Method 3: Σ(76-76.5)^2 + ... + (78-76.5)^2 = 112.5\nSSW = 178.8 + 131.9 + 112.5 = 423.2\n\nStep 4: Calculate the Sum of Squares Between (SSB):\n\nSSB = Σ(n_i * (mean_i - overall_mean)^2)\nFor Method 1: 10 * (79.2 - 80.2)^2 = 10\nFor Method 2: 10 * (84.9 - 80.2)^2 = 235\nFor Method 3: 10 * (76.5 - 80.2)^2 = 137.5\nSSB = 10 + 235 + 137.5 = 382.5\n\nStep 5: Calculate the Mean Squares Within (MSW):\n\nMSW = SSW / (total number of observations - number of groups) = 423.2 / (30 - 3) = 423.2 / 27 = 15.674\n\nStep 6: Calculate the Mean Squares Between (MSB):\n\nMSB = SSB / (number of groups - 1) = 382.5 / (3 - 1) = 382.5 / 2 = 191.25\n\nStep 7: Calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF-statistic = MSB / MSW = 191.25 / 15.674 = 12.197\n\nStep 8: Compare F-statistic to F-critical value:\n\nAt a 5% significance level and with 2 and 27 degrees of freedom, the F-critical value is approximately 3.354 (using an F-distribution table or calculator).\n\nSince the F-statistic (12.197) is greater than the F-critical value (3.354), we reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference in the mean exam scores between the three teaching methods at a 5% significance level."
