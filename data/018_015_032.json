    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B, and the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B x A.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6)}\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4), (6, 1), (6, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of these two Cartesian products:\n\n(A x B) ∩ (B x A) = ∅ (empty set, since there are no common ordered pairs)\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of B x A and A x B:\n\n(B x A) ∩ (A x B) = ∅ (empty set, since there are no common ordered pairs)\n\nSince both intersections result in the empty set, we can conclude that (A x B) ∩ (B x A) = (B x A) ∩ (A x B). However, this does not prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection, as the intersections are equal in this case.\n\nTo show that the Cartesian product is not commutative in general, we can look at the Cartesian products themselves:\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6)}\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4), (6, 1), (6, 4)}\n\nWe can see that A x B ≠ B x A, as the ordered pairs in each set are different. This demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative in general, even though the intersections in this specific example are equal."
