    "message_1": "Let X be an Abelian variety over a field k with dimension 2 and let Y be the dual of X. If the degree of X is 10, what is the degree of Y?",
    "message_2": "In the context of Abelian varieties, the degree of an Abelian variety refers to the degree of its polarization. Given an Abelian variety X of dimension 2 and its dual Y, they are related by a Poincaré line bundle L on X x Y. The degree of X is the degree of the polarization associated with L, and the degree of Y is the degree of the polarization associated with the dual Poincaré line bundle L^∨ on Y x X.\n\nFor principally polarized Abelian varieties, the degree of the polarization is 1. However, in this case, the degree of X is given as 10, which means that the polarization is not principal.\n\nIn general, the degree of the polarization of an Abelian variety and its dual are the same. This is because the Poincaré line bundle L and its dual L^∨ are related by a Fourier-Mukai transform, which preserves the degree of the polarization.\n\nTherefore, the degree of Y, the dual of X, is also 10."
