    "message_2": "To show that the product of all elements in G is equal to the identity element e, we will use the fact that the order of any element in G must divide the order of the group. Since G has prime order p, this means that the order of any element in G must be either 1 or p.\n\nLet's consider the set S = {a_1, a_2, ..., a_p} containing all elements of G, and let's compute the product of all elements in S, denoted by P. We have:\n\nP = a_1 * a_2 * ... * a_p\n\nNow, let's consider the set S' = {a_1 * a_i | i = 1, 2, ..., p}, which is the set of all elements in G obtained by multiplying a_1 by each element in G. We claim that S' is equal to S. To see this, note that if a_1 * a_i = a_1 * a_j for some i, j, then a_i = a_j since we can multiply both sides by the inverse of a_1. This means that the mapping from S to S' given by a_i â†¦ a_1 * a_i is injective. Since both sets have the same size p, this mapping is also surjective, and therefore S = S'.\n\nNow let's compute the product of all elements in S', denoted by P':\n\nP' = (a_1 * a_1) * (a_1 * a_2) * ... * (a_1 * a_p)\n\nSince the group operation is associative, we can rearrange the terms:\n\nP' = a_1 * a_1 * a_1 * ... * a_1 * a_2 * a_3 * ... * a_p\n\nThere are p occurrences of a_1 in the product, so we can write:\n\nP' = (a_1)^p * a_2 * a_3 * ... * a_p\n\nNow, since the order of a_1 must be either 1 or p, we have two cases:\n\n1) If the order of a_1 is 1, then a_1 = e, and P' = P.\n2) If the order of a_1 is p, then by Lagrange's theorem, (a_1)^p = e, and P' = P.\n\nIn both cases, we have P' = P. Since S = S', this means that the product of all elements in G is equal to the identity element e.\n\nNow, to show that G is cyclic, we just need to find an element of order p in G. We know that the order of any element in G is either 1 or p. If there exists an element a in G with order p, then G is cyclic, as the subgroup generated by a will have order p and thus be equal to G. If all elements in G have order 1, then G would consist only of the identity element, which contradicts the fact that G has prime order p. Therefore, there must exist an element of order p in G, and G is cyclic."
