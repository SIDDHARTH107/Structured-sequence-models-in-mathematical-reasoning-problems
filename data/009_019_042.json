    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE) and then compute the probability that $X_t > 2$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\nThe given SDE is a linear SDE of the form:\n\n$$dX_t = a(X_t) dt + b(X_t) dW_t$$\n\nwith $a(X_t) = -\\frac{1}{2} X_t$ and $b(X_t) = \\sigma$. This SDE has a solution of the form:\n\n$$X_t = X_0 e^{\\int_0^t a(X_s) ds + \\int_0^t b(X_s) dW_s}$$\n\nSubstituting the given functions $a(X_t)$ and $b(X_t)$, we get:\n\n$$X_t = X_0 e^{\\int_0^t -\\frac{1}{2} X_s ds + \\int_0^t \\sigma dW_s}$$\n\nNow, we will use the Ito's formula to find the solution. Let $Y_t = \\ln X_t$. Then, by Ito's formula:\n\n$$dY_t = \\frac{1}{X_t} dX_t - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{X_t^2} (b(X_t))^2 dt$$\n\nSubstituting the given values for $dX_t$ and $b(X_t)$, we get:\n\n$$dY_t = \\frac{1}{X_t} (-\\frac{1}{2} X_t dt + \\sigma dW_t) - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{X_t^2} (\\sigma)^2 dt$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$dY_t = -\\frac{1}{2} dt + \\sigma dW_t$$\n\nThis is a simple SDE with a deterministic drift and a stochastic component. The solution to this SDE is given by:\n\n$$Y_t = Y_0 - \\frac{1}{2} t + \\sigma W_t$$\n\nSince $Y_t = \\ln X_t$ and $Y_0 = \\ln X_0 = \\ln 1 = 0$, we have:\n\n$$\\ln X_t = -\\frac{1}{2} t + \\sigma W_t$$\n\nTaking the exponential of both sides, we get:\n\n$$X_t = e^{-\\frac{1}{2} t + \\sigma W_t}$$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $X_t > 2$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. Let $Z_t = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} (W_t - \\frac{1}{2} t)$. Then, $Z_t$ is a standard Brownian motion, and we can rewrite $X_t$ as:\n\n$$X_t = e^{\\sigma Z_t}$$\n\nWe want to find the probability that $X_t > 2$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. This is equivalent to finding the probability that $Z_t > \\frac{1}{\\sigma} (\\ln 2)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\nSince $Z_t$ is a standard Brownian motion, it follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t$. Therefore, the probability that $Z_t > \\frac{1}{\\sigma} (\\ln 2)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ is given by:\n\n$$P(Z_t > \\frac{1}{\\sigma} (\\ln 2)) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\ln 2}{\\sigma \\sqrt{t}}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that $X_t > 2$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. This is equivalent to finding the probability that $Z_t > \\frac{1}{\\sigma} (\\ln 2)$ for at least one $t \\in [0,1]$. Unfortunately, this probability does not have a closed-form expression, and it needs to be computed numerically using techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations or numerical integration."
