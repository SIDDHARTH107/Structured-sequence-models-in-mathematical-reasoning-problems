What is the probability that both a hurricane and a wildfire occur in the same year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of both a hurricane and a wildfire occurring in the same year, we can multiply the individual probabilities together, assuming they are independent events.\n\nProbability of both events occurring = (probability of a hurricane) × (probability of a wildfire)\n= 0.15 × 0.05\n= 0.0075\n\nSo, the probability of both a hurricane and a wildfire occurring in the same year is 0.0075 or 0.75%."
