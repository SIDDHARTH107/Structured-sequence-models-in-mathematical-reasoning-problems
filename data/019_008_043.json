    "message_1": "A student wants to buy a notebook that is neither too big nor too small. Using fuzzy logic, create a problem that determines the optimal size of the notebook for the student.\n\nSuppose the student values small notebooks 3 times as much as large notebooks. The maximum notebook size they will accept is 15 inches, and the minimum is 10 inches. The student's preference for notebooks decreases linearly from 100% at 10 inches to 0% at 15 inches. If a notebook is 12 inches, what is the student's preference for it?",
    "message_2": "To determine the student's preference for a 12-inch notebook, we can use the linear relationship between the notebook size and preference. Since the preference decreases linearly from 100% at 10 inches to 0% at 15 inches, we can find the slope and the equation of the line representing this relationship.\n\nLet x be the notebook size in inches and y be the preference percentage.\n\nWe have two points on the line: (10, 100) and (15, 0).\n\nFirst, find the slope (m) of the line:\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (0 - 100) / (15 - 10) = -100 / 5 = -20\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line:\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nUsing the point (10, 100):\ny - 100 = -20(x - 10)\n\nNow, we can find the preference for a 12-inch notebook by plugging in x = 12:\ny - 100 = -20(12 - 10)\ny - 100 = -20(2)\ny - 100 = -40\ny = 60\n\nSo, the student's preference for a 12-inch notebook is 60%."
