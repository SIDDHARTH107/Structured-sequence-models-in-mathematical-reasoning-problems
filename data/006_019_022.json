    "message_1": "Suppose there are 5 candidates running for the position of president in a certain country. Based on polling data, candidate A has a 30% chance of winning, candidate B has a 20% chance, candidate C has a 25% chance, candidate D has a 10% chance, and candidate E has a 15% chance. What is the probability that either candidate A or candidate C will win the presidential election?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that either candidate A or candidate C will win the presidential election, we simply add their individual probabilities together:\n\nP(A or C) = P(A) + P(C) = 30% + 25% = 55%\n\nSo, there is a 55% chance that either candidate A or candidate C will win the presidential election."
