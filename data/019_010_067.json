    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to linear logic:\n\nSuppose P, Q, and R are linear propositions. Using the following information, determine if the following statement is a valid conclusion: \"If P or Q holds, then R holds.\"\n* If P holds, then R holds. \n* If Q holds, then R holds.\n\nProblem: Determine if the statement \"If P or Q holds, then R holds\" is a valid conclusion using the given information.",
    "message_2": "Yes, the statement \"If P or Q holds, then R holds\" is a valid conclusion based on the given information.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. If P holds, then R holds (given).\n2. If Q holds, then R holds (given).\n\nNow, let's consider the case where P or Q holds. There are two possibilities:\n\nA. P holds: In this case, according to statement 1, R holds.\nB. Q holds: In this case, according to statement 2, R holds.\n\nIn both cases, when either P or Q holds, R holds. Therefore, the conclusion \"If P or Q holds, then R holds\" is valid."
