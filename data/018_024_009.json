    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 6}\n\nNow, let's show that the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement using a counterexample. We will use the sets A, B, and a new set C = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. We will show that A ∆ (B ∪ C) ≠ (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C).\n\nFirst, let's find B ∪ C, A ∆ B, and A ∆ C:\n\nB ∪ C = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nA ∆ B = {1, 6} (from the previous calculation)\nA ∆ C = (A ∪ C) - (A ∩ C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} - {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 7}\n\nNow, let's find A ∆ (B ∪ C) and (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C):\n\nA ∆ (B ∪ C) = (A ∪ (B ∪ C)) - (A ∩ (B ∪ C)) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} - {2, 3, 4, 5} = {1, 6, 7}\n(A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C) = {1, 6} ∪ {1, 2, 7} = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nSince A ∆ (B ∪ C) = {1, 6, 7} and (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C) = {1, 2, 6, 7}, we can see that A ∆ (B ∪ C) ≠ (A ∆ B) ∪ (A ∆ C). This counterexample shows that the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement."
