    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral of the given function along the circle |z - 2 + 3i| = 4, we will use the Cauchy's integral formula. First, let's rewrite the function f(z) in terms of its partial fractions:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 2z) / (z^2 - 4z + 13)\n\nThe denominator can be factored as (z - 2)^2 + 9, which represents a circle centered at (2, -3i) with a radius of 3. Notice that the given contour |z - 2 + 3i| = 4 is a circle centered at (2, -3i) with a radius of 4. Since the poles of the function are inside the contour, we can apply the Cauchy's integral formula.\n\nLet g(z) = z^2 + 2z, and let h(z) = (z - 2)^2 + 9. Then, f(z) = g(z) / h(z). According to the Cauchy's integral formula, the integral of f(z) along the contour is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues of f(z) at its poles inside the contour.\n\nThe poles of f(z) are the solutions of the equation h(z) = 0, which are z = 2 ± 3i. Let's compute the residues of f(z) at these poles:\n\nResidue at z = 2 + 3i:\n\nRes(f(z), 2 + 3i) = g(2 + 3i) / h'(2 + 3i)\n\ng(2 + 3i) = (2 + 3i)^2 + 2(2 + 3i) = -5 + 12i\n\nh'(z) = 2(z - 2) = 2z - 4\n\nh'(2 + 3i) = 2(2 + 3i) - 4 = 4i\n\nRes(f(z), 2 + 3i) = (-5 + 12i) / 4i = -3 - 2i\n\nResidue at z = 2 - 3i:\n\nRes(f(z), 2 - 3i) = g(2 - 3i) / h'(2 - 3i)\n\ng(2 - 3i) = (2 - 3i)^2 + 2(2 - 3i) = -5 - 12i\n\nh'(2 - 3i) = 2(2 - 3i) - 4 = -4i\n\nRes(f(z), 2 - 3i) = (-5 - 12i) / -4i = 3 + 2i\n\nNow, we can compute the integral of f(z) along the contour:\n\n∮f(z)dz = 2πi(Res(f(z), 2 + 3i) + Res(f(z), 2 - 3i))\n\n= 2πi((-3 - 2i) + (3 + 2i)) = 2πi(0) = 0\n\nSo, the value of the integral of f(z) along the circle |z - 2 + 3i| = 4, traversed counterclockwise, is 0."
