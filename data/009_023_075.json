    "message_1": "A particle is moving in one-dimension under the influence of non-linear forces. The motion of the particle is described by the non-linear Schrödinger equation given by:\n\n$i \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} + 2|\\psi|^2\\psi = 0$\n\nIf the initial wave function is given by $\\psi(x,0) = e^{-x^2}$ and the potential is zero, what is the wave function at $t=1$? \n\nWrite the numerical answer correct to four significant figures.",
    "message_2": "Solving the non-linear Schrödinger equation analytically is generally not possible. Therefore, we need to use numerical methods to find the wave function at a later time. One common method is the split-step Fourier method, which involves transforming the wave function to momentum space and back to position space while applying the non-linear and linear parts of the equation separately.\n\nHowever, providing a numerical answer to four significant figures requires implementing this method in a programming language or using specialized software, which is beyond the scope of this platform.\n\nIn summary, the wave function at $t=1$ cannot be provided as a simple numerical answer, and solving the non-linear Schrödinger equation requires using numerical methods and computational tools."
