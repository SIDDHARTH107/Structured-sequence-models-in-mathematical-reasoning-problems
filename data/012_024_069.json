    "message_2": "To determine the genus of a graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for connected planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, f is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nIn this case, we have v = 12 and e = 20. We don't know the number of faces, but we can use the inequality for planar graphs:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n20 ≤ 3(12) - 6\n20 ≤ 30\n\nSince the inequality holds, it is possible that the graph is planar (genus 0). However, we cannot be sure without more information about the specific graph. If the graph is not planar, we can use the Euler's formula to find the genus:\n\n12 - 20 + f = 2 - 2g\nf = 2g - 8\n\nNow we can use the inequality for non-planar graphs:\n\ne ≤ 3v + 6g - 12\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n20 ≤ 3(12) + 6g - 12\n8 ≤ 6g\ng ≥ 4/3\n\nSince the genus must be an integer, the minimum genus for a non-planar graph with 12 vertices and 20 edges is g = 2.\n\nIn conclusion, the genus of the graph G is either 0 (if the graph is planar) or at least 2 (if the graph is non-planar). Without more information about the specific graph, we cannot determine the exact genus."
