    "message_2": "To find the volume of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nVolume (V) = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the metal ball is 10 cm, its radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is:\n\nr = 10 cm / 2 = 5 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the value of r into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (5 cm)^3\nV = (4/3) * π * 125 cm^3\nV = (500/3) * π cm^3\n\nApproximating the value of π as 3.14159, we get:\n\nV ≈ (500/3) * 3.14159 cm^3\nV ≈ 523.598 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is approximately 523.598 cubic centimeters."
