    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.\n\nFor the given graph, we can find the automorphisms by considering the possible permutations of vertices that preserve adjacency. Let's denote the vertices as V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\n1. The identity automorphism: This is the trivial automorphism that maps each vertex to itself. It is always an element of the automorphism group. In this case, it is (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6).\n\n2. Swapping vertices 1 and 5: This automorphism maps vertex 1 to 5 and vice versa, while keeping the other vertices fixed. It is represented as (1 5)(2)(3)(4)(6).\n\n3. Swapping vertices 3 and 6: This automorphism maps vertex 3 to 6 and vice versa, while keeping the other vertices fixed. It is represented as (1)(2)(3 6)(4)(5).\n\n4. Swapping both pairs (1 and 5) and (3 and 6): This automorphism maps vertex 1 to 5, 5 to 1, 3 to 6, and 6 to 3, while keeping the other vertices fixed. It is represented as (1 5)(2)(3 6)(4).\n\nThus, the automorphism group of this graph is:\n\n{ (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6), (1 5)(2)(3)(4)(6), (1)(2)(3 6)(4)(5), (1 5)(2)(3 6)(4) }\n\nThis group has 4 elements and is isomorphic to the Klein four-group."
