    "message_1": "Suppose there are two airlines, Airline A and Airline B, operating on a particular route. The cost per passenger for Airline A is $100, and the cost per passenger for Airline B is $120. If both airlines set the same price for their tickets, which is the lowest price that will guarantee they both cover their costs?",
    "message_2": "The lowest price that will guarantee both airlines cover their costs is the highest cost per passenger between the two airlines. In this case, that would be Airline B's cost per passenger, which is $120. So, the lowest price they can both set for their tickets to cover their costs is $120."
