    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg that measures 7 cm and the hypotenuse that measures 13 cm. What is the length of the other leg of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In other words:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nIn this problem, we are given the length of one leg (a = 7 cm) and the length of the hypotenuse (c = 13 cm). We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\n13^2 = 7^2 + b^2\n169 = 49 + b^2\n120 = b^2\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 120 to find the length of the other leg (b):\n\nb = √120 ≈ 10.95 cm\n\nSo, the length of the other leg of the triangle is approximately 10.95 cm."
