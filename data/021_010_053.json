    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA company produces and sells widgets at a cost of $5 per widget. The demand function for the widgets is given by q(p) = 3000 - 100p, where p is the price per widget and q(p) is the quantity demanded at that price. The company wants to maximize its profits by choosing the price that will generate the most revenue. Use Newton's method to find the price that maximizes profits, and then calculate the maximum profit.",
    "message_2": "To maximize profits, we need to find the price that maximizes the revenue function, R(p), minus the cost function, C(p). The revenue function is given by R(p) = p * q(p), and the cost function is given by C(p) = 5 * q(p).\n\nFirst, let's find the revenue function:\n\nR(p) = p * q(p) = p * (3000 - 100p) = 3000p - 100p^2\n\nNow, let's find the cost function:\n\nC(p) = 5 * q(p) = 5 * (3000 - 100p) = 15000 - 500p\n\nThe profit function, P(p), is the difference between the revenue and cost functions:\n\nP(p) = R(p) - C(p) = (3000p - 100p^2) - (15000 - 500p) = -100p^2 + 3500p - 15000\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. We do this by taking the first derivative of the profit function and setting it equal to zero:\n\nP'(p) = -200p + 3500\n\nNow, we set P'(p) = 0 and solve for p:\n\n-200p + 3500 = 0\n200p = 3500\np = 17.5\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point is a maximum by taking the second derivative of the profit function:\n\nP''(p) = -200\n\nSince P''(p) is negative, the critical point p = 17.5 is a maximum.\n\nNow, we can find the maximum profit by plugging p = 17.5 back into the profit function:\n\nP(17.5) = -100(17.5)^2 + 3500(17.5) - 15000 â‰ˆ 30625\n\nSo, the maximum profit is approximately $30,625 when the price per widget is $17.5."
