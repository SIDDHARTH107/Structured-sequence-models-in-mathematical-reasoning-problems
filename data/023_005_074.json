    "message_2": "To solve the given initial value problem using Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transforms of the given functions and then use the properties of Fourier transforms to solve the problem.\n\nGiven: y''(t) + 4y(t) = 6e^(-2t), y(0) = 2, y'(0) = 1\n\nLet's denote the Fourier transform of y(t) as Y(ω), then the Fourier transform of y''(t) will be (iω)^2 Y(ω) = -ω^2 Y(ω).\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of 6e^(-2t):\n\nF{6e^(-2t)} = ∫(6e^(-2t) * e^(-iωt) dt) from -∞ to ∞\n\nAfter integrating, we get:\n\nF{6e^(-2t)} = -6 / (2 + iω)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier transform of the given equation:\n\n-ω^2 Y(ω) + 4Y(ω) = -6 / (2 + iω)\n\nNow, let's solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = -6 / ((2 + iω)(4 - ω^2))\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to get y(t):\n\ny(t) = F^-1{Y(ω)}\n\ny(t) = F^-1{-6 / ((2 + iω)(4 - ω^2))}\n\nTo find the inverse Fourier transform, we need to find the residues of the poles of Y(ω) and then use the inverse Fourier transform formula. The poles of Y(ω) are at ω = ±2i and ω = ±2.\n\nNow, let's find the residues at these poles:\n\nResidue at ω = 2i: (1/4) * (6 / (2i))\nResidue at ω = -2i: (1/4) * (6 / (-2i))\nResidue at ω = 2: (1/4) * (6 / (4i))\nResidue at ω = -2: (1/4) * (6 / (-4i))\n\nNow, we can use the inverse Fourier transform formula:\n\ny(t) = (1/2π) * (e^(2it) * (1/4) * (6 / (2i)) + e^(-2it) * (1/4) * (6 / (-2i)) + e^(2t) * (1/4) * (6 / (4i)) + e^(-2t) * (1/4) * (6 / (-4i)))\n\ny(t) = (3/2π) * (e^(2it) / i - e^(-2it) / i + e^(2t) / (4i) - e^(-2t) / (4i))\n\nNow, we need to apply the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 2: (3/2π) * (1 / i - 1 / i + 1 / (4i) - 1 / (4i)) = 2\ny'(0) = 1: (3/2π) * (2i / i - (-2i) / i + 2 / (4i) - (-2) / (4i)) = 1\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\ny(t) = (3/2π) * (e^(2it) / i - e^(-2it) / i + e^(2t) / (4i) - e^(-2t) / (4i))\n\nThis is the solution to the given initial value problem using Fourier transform."
