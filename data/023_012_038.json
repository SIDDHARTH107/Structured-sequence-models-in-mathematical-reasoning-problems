    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is odd, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients. The formula for b_n is:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫(f(x) * sin(nx) dx) from -π to π\n\nSince the function is defined piecewise, we need to split the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [∫(-x * sin(nx) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(x * sin(nx) dx) from 0 to π]\n\nNow, we need to find the integrals:\n\nFor the first integral, let's use integration by parts:\nu = -x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = -dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(nx)\n\n∫(-x * sin(nx) dx) = -x * (-(1/n) * cos(nx)) - ∫(-(1/n) * cos(nx) * -dx)\n= (x/n) * cos(nx) + (1/n) * ∫(cos(nx) dx)\n= (x/n) * cos(nx) + (1/n^2) * sin(nx)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral from -π to 0:\n[(0/n) * cos(0) + (1/n^2) * sin(0)] - [(-π/n) * cos(-nπ) + (1/n^2) * sin(-nπ)]\n= 0 - (-π/n) * cos(nπ) = (π/n) * cos(nπ)\n\nFor the second integral, we can use the same integration by parts method as before:\nu = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(nx)\n\n∫(x * sin(nx) dx) = x * (-(1/n) * cos(nx)) - ∫(-(1/n) * cos(nx) * dx)\n= -(x/n) * cos(nx) - (1/n) * ∫(cos(nx) dx)\n= -(x/n) * cos(nx) - (1/n^2) * sin(nx)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral from 0 to π:\n[-(π/n) * cos(nπ) - (1/n^2) * sin(nπ)] - [(0/n) * cos(0) - (1/n^2) * sin(0)]\n= -(π/n) * cos(nπ)\n\nNow, let's plug these results back into the b_n formula:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(π/n) * cos(nπ) - (π/n) * cos(nπ)] = 0\n\nSince all b_n coefficients are zero, the Fourier series of the given function is:\n\nf(x) = 0\n\nNow, to find the value of f(π/4) using the Fourier series, we simply plug in x = π/4:\n\nf(π/4) = 0\n\nHowever, this result contradicts the original function definition. This is because the Fourier series converges to the average value of the function at the jump discontinuity, which is not the actual value of the function at that point. In this case, the Fourier series does not provide an accurate representation of the function at x = π/4. To find the actual value of the function at x = π/4, we refer back to the original function definition:\n\nf(x) = x, 0 < x < π\n\nf(π/4) = π/4"
