    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Since the problem does not specify the universal set, we can assume it to be the set of all positive integers less than or equal to 12 for simplicity. So, U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}.\n\nNow, the complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nBy comparing the elements of set A and set U, we can find the elements that are not in set A:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12}\n\nNow, to prove that the complement of set A is unique, we need to show that there is no other set that can be the complement of set A.\n\nSuppose there exists another set B such that B is also the complement of set A. This means that B contains all the elements in U that are not in set A. Since the elements in U and A are fixed, the elements in B must be the same as the elements in A'. Therefore, B = A'.\n\nSince B is equal to A', there is no other set that can be the complement of set A. Thus, the complement of set A is unique."
