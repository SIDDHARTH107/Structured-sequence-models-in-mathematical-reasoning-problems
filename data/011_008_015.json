    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In this problem, we have n = 10 employees and k = 3 teams. So, we need to find S(10, 3).\n\nThe formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nTo find S(10, 3), we need to know the values of S(9, 3), S(9, 2), S(8, 3), and S(8, 2). We can calculate these values using the same formula:\n\nS(9, 3) = 3 * S(8, 3) + S(8, 2)\nS(9, 2) = 2 * S(8, 2) + S(8, 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of S(8, 3), S(8, 2), and S(8, 1). We can use the base cases of Stirling numbers of the second kind:\n\n1. S(n, 1) = 1 for all n (partitioning n elements into 1 subset)\n2. S(n, n) = 1 for all n (partitioning n elements into n subsets)\n3. S(n, 0) = 0 for n > 0 (no way to partition non-empty set into 0 subsets)\n\nUsing the base cases, we have:\n\nS(8, 1) = 1\nS(8, 2) = 2 * S(7, 2) + S(7, 1)\nS(8, 3) = 3 * S(7, 3) + S(7, 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of S(7, 2), S(7, 1), and S(7, 3):\n\nS(7, 1) = 1\nS(7, 2) = 2 * S(6, 2) + S(6, 1)\nS(7, 3) = 3 * S(6, 3) + S(6, 2)\n\nContinuing this process, we can find the values of S(6, 2), S(6, 1), and S(6, 3):\n\nS(6, 1) = 1\nS(6, 2) = 2 * S(5, 2) + S(5, 1) = 2 * 15 + 1 = 31\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2) = 3 * 25 + 15 = 90\n\nNow, we can find the values of S(7, 2) and S(7, 3):\n\nS(7, 2) = 2 * S(6, 2) + S(6, 1) = 2 * 31 + 1 = 63\nS(7, 3) = 3 * S(6, 3) + S(6, 2) = 3 * 90 + 31 = 301\n\nFinally, we can find the values of S(8, 2) and S(8, 3):\n\nS(8, 2) = 2 * S(7, 2) + S(7, 1) = 2 * 63 + 1 = 127\nS(8, 3) = 3 * S(7, 3) + S(7, 2) = 3 * 301 + 63 = 966\n\nNow, we can find the values of S(9, 2) and S(9, 3):\n\nS(9, 2) = 2 * S(8, 2) + S(8, 1) = 2 * 127 + 1 = 255\nS(9, 3) = 3 * S(8, 3) + S(8, 2) = 3 * 966 + 127 = 3025\n\nFinally, we can find the value of S(10, 3):\n\nS(10, 3) = 3 * S(9, 3) + S(9, 2) = 3 * 3025 + 255 = 9300\n\nSo, there are 9300 ways to divide the 10 employees into 3 teams with each team having at least 1 member."
