    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = x^2 + 3 at the point where x = 2, we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 + 3. The derivative of y with respect to x, denoted as dy/dx or y', is found using the power rule:\n\ny' = d(x^2 + 3)/dx = 2x^1 + 0 = 2x\n\nNow, we need to evaluate y' at x = 2:\n\ny'(2) = 2(2) = 4\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = x^2 + 3 at the point where x = 2 is 4."
