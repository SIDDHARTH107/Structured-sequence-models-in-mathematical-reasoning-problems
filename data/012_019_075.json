    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic index of the graph G, we need to find the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges such that no two adjacent edges have the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree (Δ) of the graph, which is the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex. In this graph, vertex 4 has the maximum degree of 5.\n\nAccording to Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G is either Δ or Δ+1. So, in this case, the chromatic index will be either 5 or 6.\n\nNow, let's try to color the edges using 5 colors:\n\n```\n              1---2\n            1/|\\2 |\n           2/ | \\3|\n           3--4--5\n            \\4| /1|\n             \\|/  |\n              6---7\n```\n\nWe have successfully colored the edges of the graph using 5 colors without any two adjacent edges having the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index of the graph G is 5."
