    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using block matrices, we first need to represent the system as a matrix equation AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables, and B is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |      X = | x |      B = | 10 |\n    | 5  6  7 |          | y |          | 20 |\n    | 8  9 10 |          | z |          | 30 |\n\nNow, we can partition the matrix A into two smaller matrices, one containing the first two rows and the other containing the last row. Similarly, we can partition the matrix B into two smaller matrices. This gives us the following block matrices:\n\nA1 = | 2  3  4 |      A2 = | 8  9 10 |      B1 = | 10 |\n     | 5  6  7 |          |          |          | 20 |\n                           |          |          |    |\n                           |          |          | 30 |\n\nNow, we can write the block matrix equation:\n\n| A1 |   | x |   | B1 |\n|    | * | y | = |    |\n| A2 |   | z |   | B2 |\n\nTo solve for X, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the inverse of A1:\n\nA1^(-1) * A1 * X = A1^(-1) * B1\n\nX = A1^(-1) * B1\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse of A1. A1 is a 2x3 matrix, so we cannot directly compute its inverse. However, we can compute the left inverse (also known as the Moore-Penrose inverse) using the formula:\n\nA1^(-1) = (A1^T * A1)^(-1) * A1^T\n\nA1^T = | 2  5 |\n       | 3  6 |\n       | 4  7 |\n\nNow, we compute A1^T * A1:\n\nA1^T * A1 = | 2  5 |   | 2  3  4 | = | 29  38  47 |\n            | 3  6 |   | 5  6  7 |   | 38  50  62 |\n            | 4  7 |   | 8  9 10 |   | 47  62  77 |\n\nNow, we compute the inverse of (A1^T * A1):\n\n(A1^T * A1)^(-1) = | 29  38  47 |^(-1) = |  3.5  -7   3.5 |\n                   | 38  50  62 |        | -7    14  -7   |\n                   | 47  62  77 |        |  3.5  -7   3.5  |\n\nNow, we compute A1^(-1) = (A1^T * A1)^(-1) * A1^T:\n\nA1^(-1) = |  3.5  -7   3.5 |   | 2  5 | = | -1  2 |\n          | -7    14  -7   |   | 3  6 |   |  2 -4 |\n          |  3.5  -7   3.5  |   | 4  7 |   | -1  2 |\n\nFinally, we compute X = A1^(-1) * B1:\n\nX = | -1  2 |   | 10 | = | 0 |\n    |  2 -4 |   | 20 |   | 0 |\n    | -1  2 |   | 30 |   | 0 |\n\nSo, we have found that X = (0, 0, 0). However, this solution does not satisfy the third equation in the original system (8x + 9y + 10z = 30). This means that the given system of linear equations has no solution."
