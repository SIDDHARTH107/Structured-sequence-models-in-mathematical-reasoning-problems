    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a square. It is also a fractal, meaning it has a self-replicating pattern at different scales. Due to its space-filling nature, the length of the Peano curve is infinite. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the length of the Peano curve segment between points (0,0) and (1,1) as it is also infinite."
