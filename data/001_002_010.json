    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points (3, 4) and (-2, -1), we can use the slope-point form of a linear equation, which is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope (m) using the formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the given points (3, 4) and (-2, -1), we have:\n\nm = (-1 - 4) / (-2 - 3) = (-5) / (-5) = 1\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use either point to find the equation of the line. Let's use the point (3, 4):\n\ny - 4 = 1(x - 3)\n\ny - 4 = x - 3\n\ny = x + 1\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through the points (3, 4) and (-2, -1) is y = x + 1."
