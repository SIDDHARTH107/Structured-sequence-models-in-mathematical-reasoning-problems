    "message_2": "An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. In other words, no edges exist between the vertices in the independent set. To find the maximum number of vertices that can be included in an independent set, we can use the concept of graph coloring.\n\nA proper vertex coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring. It is well-known that the size of the maximum independent set is at least the total number of vertices divided by the chromatic number.\n\nIn this problem, we have a graph G with 8 vertices and 12 edges. Since we want to maximize the independent set, we should try to minimize the chromatic number. A complete graph with 8 vertices would have (8 * 7) / 2 = 28 edges. Our graph has 12 edges, which is significantly less than 28, so it is not a complete graph and its chromatic number is less than 8.\n\nWe can use the inequality:\n\nchromatic number <= 1 + maximum degree\n\nThe maximum degree of a vertex in a graph with 12 edges is at most 6 (since 6 + 5 + 1 = 12). Therefore, the chromatic number of the graph is at most 1 + 6 = 7.\n\nNow we can use the inequality:\n\nsize of maximum independent set >= total number of vertices / chromatic number\n\nsize of maximum independent set >= 8 / 7\n\nSince the size of the maximum independent set must be an integer, we can round up to get:\n\nsize of maximum independent set >= 2\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of vertices that can be included in an independent set in the graph G is at least 2. However, without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact size of the maximum independent set."
