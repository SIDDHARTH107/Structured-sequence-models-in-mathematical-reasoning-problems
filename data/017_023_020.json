    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group is either 1 or a multiple of p.\n\nThe prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. So, we need to consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, there are three possibilities for their order: 2, 4, or 8. Let's denote the number of Sylow 2-subgroups as n_2.\n\n1. If the order is 2, then n_2 must be a multiple of 2 and divide 36 (72/2). The possibilities are n_2 = 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, or 36.\n2. If the order is 4, then n_2 must be a multiple of 2 and divide 18 (72/4). The possibilities are n_2 = 1, 2, 3, 6, or 9.\n3. If the order is 8, then n_2 must be a multiple of 2 and divide 9 (72/8). The possibilities are n_2 = 1 or 3.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, there are two possibilities for their order: 3 or 9. Let's denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups as n_3.\n\n1. If the order is 3, then n_3 must be a multiple of 3 and divide 24 (72/3). The possibilities are n_3 = 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24.\n2. If the order is 9, then n_3 must be a multiple of 3 and divide 8 (72/9). The possibilities are n_3 = 1 or 3.\n\nNow, we can use the following rules to find the number of non-isomorphic groups:\n\n1. If n_2 = n_3 = 1, there is one abelian group.\n2. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 > 1, there is one non-abelian group.\n3. If n_2 > 1 and n_3 = 1, there is one non-abelian group.\n4. If n_2 > 1 and n_3 > 1, there are two non-abelian groups.\n\nUsing these rules, we can count the number of non-isomorphic groups:\n\n1. Abelian groups: (2, 3), (4, 3), (8, 3), (2, 9), (4, 9) - 5 groups\n2. Non-abelian groups: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 12), (1, 24), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 12), (2, 24), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 12), (3, 24), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 12), (4, 24), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6), (6, 8), (6, 12), (6, 24), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 12), (9, 24), (12, 3), (12, 4), (12, 6), (12, 8), (12, 12), (12, 24), (18, 3), (18, 4), (18, 6), (18, 8), (18, 12), (18, 24), (36, 3), (36, 4), (36, 6), (36, 8), (36, 12), (36, 24) - 66 groups\n\nSo, there are a total of 5 abelian and 66 non-abelian non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
