    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products, A and B. Each unit of A requires 2 hours of assembly time and 1 hour of painting time, while each unit of B requires 3 hours of assembly time and 2 hours of painting time. The company has 300 hours of assembly time and 180 hours of painting time available each week. A unit of A has a profit of $70, and a unit of B has a profit of $90. How many units of each product should the company produce per week to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal number of units of A and B to produce. Let x be the number of units of A and y be the number of units of B. We have the following constraints based on the available hours of assembly and painting time:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 300 (assembly time constraint)\n1x + 2y ≤ 180 (painting time constraint)\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 70x + 90y\n\nNow, we will solve the problem graphically by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we will rewrite the constraints as equalities to find the boundary lines:\n\n2x + 3y = 300\nx + 2y = 180\n\nNow, we will solve for y in terms of x for each constraint:\n\ny = (300 - 2x) / 3\ny = (180 - x) / 2\n\nNow, we will find the intersection points of these lines with the axes:\n\nFor the assembly time constraint:\nIf x = 0, y = (300 - 2(0)) / 3 = 100\nIf y = 0, x = (300 - 3(0)) / 2 = 150\n\nFor the painting time constraint:\nIf x = 0, y = (180 - 0) / 2 = 90\nIf y = 0, x = 180 - 2(0) = 180\n\nNow, we will find the intersection point of the two lines:\n\n(300 - 2x) / 3 = (180 - x) / 2\n2(300 - 2x) = 3(180 - x)\n600 - 4x = 540 - 3x\nx = 60\n\ny = (180 - 60) / 2 = 60\n\nSo, the intersection point is (60, 60).\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by considering the inequalities:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 300\nx + 2y ≤ 180\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 90), (150, 0), and (60, 60).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 70(0) + 90(0) = $0\nP(0, 90) = 70(0) + 90(90) = $8,100\nP(150, 0) = 70(150) + 90(0) = $10,500\nP(60, 60) = 70(60) + 90(60) = $9,600\n\nThe maximum profit is $10,500, which occurs when the company produces 150 units of A and 0 units of B per week."
