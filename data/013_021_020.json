    "message_1": "In the Centipede Game, two players, X and Y, take turns in choosing to either pass or take a token. The game ends when one player decides to take the token, at which point the other player receives nothing. If they take turns exactly 10 times, what is the payoff for each player assuming X goes first and both players are rational? (Assume that passing gives a payoff of 1 and taking gives a payoff of 10.)",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the game backwards. \n\nAt the 10th turn, if the token has not been taken yet, player Y has the choice to either pass or take. Since taking gives a payoff of 10 and passing gives a payoff of 1, player Y will choose to take the token at the 10th turn.\n\nNow, let's consider the 9th turn. Player X knows that if they pass, player Y will take the token at the 10th turn. Therefore, player X will choose to take the token at the 9th turn, receiving a payoff of 10.\n\nSince both players are rational, they will understand this logic. Therefore, player X will take the token at the first turn, receiving a payoff of 10, and player Y will receive nothing. So the payoff for each player is:\n\nPlayer X: 10\nPlayer Y: 0"
