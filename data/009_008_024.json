    "message_1": "A string fixed at both ends has a length of 20 cm and is under tension of 16 newtons. Initially, the string is at rest and it is given a displacement of 2 cm at one end. Find the wave equation that governs the displacement of the string and find the displacement of the string at a point 10 cm away from the end where the displacement is given, at a time of 0.01 second after the initial displacement.",
    "message_2": "To find the wave equation that governs the displacement of the string, we need to know the linear mass density (μ) of the string. Since it is not given, we will assume it as a variable. The wave speed (v) on the string can be calculated using the formula:\n\nv = sqrt(T/μ)\n\nwhere T is the tension (16 N) and μ is the linear mass density.\n\nThe wave equation for the displacement of the string (y) can be written as:\n\n∂²y/∂t² = v² * ∂²y/∂x²\n\nNow, let's find the displacement of the string at a point 10 cm away from the end where the displacement is given, at a time of 0.01 seconds after the initial displacement.\n\nSince the string is initially at rest, we can assume that the displacement is caused by a wave pulse traveling along the string. The shape of the pulse is not given, so we cannot determine the exact displacement function. However, we can estimate the time it takes for the pulse to reach the point 10 cm away from the end.\n\nUsing the wave speed formula, we have:\n\nt = x/v\n\nwhere x is the distance (10 cm = 0.1 m) and t is the time.\n\nWe know that v = sqrt(16/μ), so we can rewrite the formula as:\n\nt = 0.1/sqrt(16/μ)\n\nGiven that t = 0.01 seconds, we can solve for μ:\n\n0.01 = 0.1/sqrt(16/μ)\n0.01 * sqrt(16/μ) = 0.1\nsqrt(16/μ) = 10\n16/μ = 100\nμ = 16/100 = 0.16 kg/m\n\nNow that we have the linear mass density, we can find the wave speed:\n\nv = sqrt(16/0.16) = sqrt(100) = 10 m/s\n\nHowever, without knowing the shape of the pulse or the boundary conditions, we cannot determine the exact displacement of the string at the given point and time."
