    "message_2": "To find the number of different groups that can be formed, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (18), k is the number of students in each group (6), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nC(18, 6) = 18! / (6!(18-6)!)\n\nC(18, 6) = 18! / (6!12!)\n\nC(18, 6) = (18*17*16*15*14*13) / (6*5*4*3*2*1)\n\nC(18, 6) = 18,564\n\nSo, there are 18,564 different groups that can be formed."
