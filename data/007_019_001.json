    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 945, we can start by dividing the number by the smallest prime number, 2. Since 945 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. The next smallest prime number is 3.\n\n945 รท 3 = 315\n\n945 is divisible by 3, so the smallest prime factor of 945 is 3."
