    "message_2": "To find the shortest curve on the sphere that connects $P$ to $Q$, we can consider the great circle that passes through both points. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on a sphere, and its circumference is equal to the circumference of the sphere. The shortest path between any two points on a sphere lies along the great circle connecting those points.\n\nFirst, let's find the plane that contains the great circle. This plane must pass through the center of the sphere $(0,0,0)$ and the points $P$ and $Q$. The normal vector of this plane can be found by taking the cross product of the position vectors of $P$ and $Q$:\n\n$\\vec{n} = \\vec{P} \\times \\vec{Q} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSince the cross product is zero, the plane is degenerate, and we can conclude that the great circle lies in the $xz$-plane (since both $P$ and $Q$ have $y$-coordinates equal to 0).\n\nNow, we need to find the angle between the points $P$ and $Q$ on the great circle. We can use the dot product formula for this:\n\n$\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{Q}}{||\\vec{P}|| ||\\vec{Q}||} = \\frac{-1}{1 \\cdot 1} = -1$\n\nSince the cosine of the angle is -1, the angle between $P$ and $Q$ on the great circle is $\\theta = \\pi$ radians (or 180 degrees).\n\nFinally, to find the length of the shortest curve on the sphere that connects $P$ to $Q$, we can use the formula for arc length:\n\n$Arc Length = r \\cdot \\theta = 1 \\cdot \\pi = \\pi$\n\nSo, the length of the shortest curve on the sphere that connects $P$ to $Q$ is $\\pi$ units."
