    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the length of the third side (the adjacent side) and then add the lengths of all three sides together.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the adjacent side, since we have a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 13 cm and an opposite side of 5 cm. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b):\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n13² = 5² + b²\n169 = 25 + b²\n144 = b²\nb = √144\nb = 12 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of the adjacent side (12 cm), we can find the perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = Hypotenuse + Opposite side + Adjacent side\nPerimeter = 13 cm + 5 cm + 12 cm\nPerimeter = 30 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is 30 cm."
