    "message_2": "First, let's recall the definition of an isomorphism. An isomorphism between two groups G and H is a bijective function f: G → H such that f(xy) = f(x)f(y) for all x, y in G. In other words, an isomorphism preserves the group structure.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given groups:\n\n1. C60: The cyclic group of order 60 has a single generator, say g, and its elements are {1, g, g^2, ..., g^59}. Since it is abelian, any group isomorphic to C60 must also be abelian. Therefore, we can rule out the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60 as potential isomorphic groups.\n\n2. A5 × C2: The alternating group A5 has order 5!/2 = 60, and C2 is the cyclic group of order 2. Their direct product has order 60 as well. A5 is a simple group, meaning it has no nontrivial normal subgroups. Since A5 is non-abelian, any group isomorphic to A5 × C2 must also be non-abelian. Moreover, it must have a normal subgroup of order 2.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 60. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a unique normal Sylow 5-subgroup, say P. If G is abelian, then G is isomorphic to C60. If G is non-abelian, we can consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: G has a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup, say Q. In this case, G is a semidirect product of P and Q, and G is isomorphic to A5 × C2.\n\nCase 2: G has more than one Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, G is one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nIn summary, a group of order 60 can be isomorphic to either C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. To determine the specific isomorphism, one would need to analyze the group structure and properties further."
