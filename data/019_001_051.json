    "message_2": "To write the truth table for the proposition \"if I don't eat breakfast, then I won't have coffee,\" we first need to represent this proposition in propositional logic. The proposition can be written as \"if ¬p, then ¬q\" or equivalently, \"¬p → ¬q\".\n\nThe truth table for this proposition is as follows:\n\n| p | q | ¬p | ¬q | ¬p → ¬q |\n|---|---|----|----|---------|\n| T | T | F  | F  | T       |\n| T | F | F  | T  | T       |\n| F | T | T  | F  | F       |\n| F | F | T  | T  | T       |\n\nHere, T represents True and F represents False."
