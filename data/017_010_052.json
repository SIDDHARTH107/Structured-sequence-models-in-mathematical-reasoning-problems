    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct isomorphism classes for a group of order 10, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group is congruent to 1 modulo p and divides the order of the group.\n\nSince 10 = 2 * 5, a group of order 10 has a 2-Sylow subgroup of order 2 and a 5-Sylow subgroup of order 5. Let's denote these subgroups as P2 and P5, respectively.\n\nBy the second Sylow theorem, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is that there is one 2-Sylow subgroup, which means P2 is a normal subgroup.\n\nSimilarly, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is that there is one 5-Sylow subgroup, which means P5 is also a normal subgroup.\n\nSince both P2 and P5 are normal subgroups, their product P2 * P5 is also a subgroup of the group of order 10. Moreover, since the orders of P2 and P5 are relatively prime, P2 * P5 is a direct product of P2 and P5, and its order is 2 * 5 = 10.\n\nNow we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: The group is abelian.\nIn this case, the group must be isomorphic to the direct product of P2 and P5, which are both cyclic groups of orders 2 and 5, respectively. Therefore, the group is isomorphic to the cyclic group C10.\n\nCase 2: The group is non-abelian.\nIn this case, the group cannot be a direct product of P2 and P5. However, it can be a semi-direct product of P2 and P5. The only non-abelian group of order 10 that is a semi-direct product of a group of order 2 and a group of order 5 is the dihedral group D5.\n\nThus, there are only two distinct isomorphism classes for a group of order 10: the cyclic group C10 and the dihedral group D5."
