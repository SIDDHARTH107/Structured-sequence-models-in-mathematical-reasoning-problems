    "message_2": "A Fano variety X is a smooth projective variety with ample anticanonical divisor -K_X. The index of a Fano variety is defined as the largest positive integer i such that -K_X is i-ample, i.e., i*(-K_X) is an ample divisor. In this case, the index is given as 2, so -2K_X is ample.\n\nThe Picard number of X, denoted as œÅ(X), is the rank of the Picard group Pic(X), which is the group of isomorphism classes of line bundles on X. In this case, the Picard number is given as 1. This means that there is only one independent divisor class up to linear equivalence, and we can write -K_X = aH for some ample divisor H and a positive integer a.\n\nSince the index is 2, we have -2K_X = 2aH is ample. Thus, a = 1 and -K_X = H. Now, the degree of a Fano variety X is defined as the intersection number of the anticanonical divisor with itself three times, i.e., deg(X) = (-K_X)^3.\n\nIn our case, deg(X) = (H)^3, where H is an ample divisor. To compute the degree, we need more information about the specific Fano variety and its ample divisor H. However, we can say that the degree of X is the cube of the self-intersection number of the ample divisor H."
