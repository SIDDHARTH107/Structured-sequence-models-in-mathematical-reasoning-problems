    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that the city will not experience flooding for the next 5 years, we need to find the probability of not experiencing flooding in a single year and then raise it to the power of 5 (since the events are independent).\n\nThe probability of not experiencing flooding in a single year is 1 - the probability of experiencing flooding, which is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of not experiencing flooding for the next 5 years. This is equal to the probability of not experiencing flooding in a single year raised to the power of 5:\n\n0.80^5 = 0.32768\n\nSo, the probability that the city will not experience flooding for the next 5 years is approximately 32.77%."
