    "message_2": "The power rule of differentiation states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nIn this case, f(x) = 5x^6, so n = 6. Applying the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 6 * 5x^(6-1) = 30x^5\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^6 is f'(x) = 30x^5."
