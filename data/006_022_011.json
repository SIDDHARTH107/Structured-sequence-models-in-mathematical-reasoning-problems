    "message_1": "A school has 220 students in total, out of which 130 are girls. If the probability of a girl student getting an A grade in a particular subject is 0.4, what is the probability that a student chosen at random from the school is a girl who gets an A grade in that subject?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a student chosen at random is a girl who gets an A grade, we can use the formula:\n\nP(Girl and A grade) = P(Girl) * P(A grade | Girl)\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of choosing a girl student at random:\n\nP(Girl) = Number of girls / Total number of students = 130 / 220 = 13/22\n\nNext, we are given the probability of a girl student getting an A grade:\n\nP(A grade | Girl) = 0.4\n\nNow, we can find the probability of a student being a girl who gets an A grade:\n\nP(Girl and A grade) = P(Girl) * P(A grade | Girl) = (13/22) * 0.4 = 13/55\n\nSo, the probability that a student chosen at random from the school is a girl who gets an A grade in that subject is 13/55 or approximately 0.2364."
