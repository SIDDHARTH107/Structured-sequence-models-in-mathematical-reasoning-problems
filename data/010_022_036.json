    "message_2": "Let's denote the angle between the radius vector and the tangent as θ. We want to find the rate of change of this angle, dθ/dt, when the circle has rolled 4 cm along the line.\n\nAs the circle rolls along the line, the arc length it covers is equal to the distance it has rolled. The arc length (s) can be related to the angle θ and the radius (r) using the formula:\n\ns = r * θ\n\nIn this case, the radius r = 2 cm, and the circle has rolled 4 cm, so s = 4 cm. We can now find the angle θ:\n\n4 = 2 * θ\nθ = 2 radians\n\nNow, we need to find the rate of change of the angle, dθ/dt. To do this, we can differentiate the arc length formula with respect to time (t):\n\nds/dt = r * dθ/dt\n\nWe are given that the speed of the circle is 3 cm/s, which is the rate of change of the arc length, ds/dt. We can now find dθ/dt:\n\n3 = 2 * dθ/dt\ndθ/dt = 3/2 radians/s\n\nSo, the rate at which the angle between the radius vector and the tangent is changing when the circle has rolled 4 cm along the line is 3/2 radians/s."
