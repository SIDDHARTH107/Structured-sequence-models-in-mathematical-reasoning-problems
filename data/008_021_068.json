    "message_2": "Since the coefficient matrix is singular, it means that the determinant of the matrix is zero, and therefore, the matrix is not invertible. In this case, we cannot use the method of matrix inversion to solve the system of linear equations. However, we can try to solve the system using other methods, such as Gaussian elimination or substitution.\n\nLet's first write down the coefficient matrix and the augmented matrix:\n\nCoefficient matrix:\n| 1  2 -1 |\n| 3 -6  3 |\n| 2  4 -2 |\n\nAugmented matrix:\n| 1  2 -1 | 3 |\n| 3 -6  3 | 9 |\n| 2  4 -2 | 6 |\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination on the augmented matrix:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 3 times the first row from the second row, and 2 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  3  |\n| 0 -12  6 |  0  |\n| 0  0  0  |  0  |\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -12:\n\n| 1  2 -1 |  3  |\n| 0  1 -0.5|  0  |\n| 0  0  0  |  0  |\n\nFrom the second row, we have y - 0.5z = 0, or y = 0.5z. Now, substitute this expression for y into the first row equation:\n\nx + 2(0.5z) - z = 3\nx + z - z = 3\nx = 3\n\nSo, we have found x = 3, and y = 0.5z. However, since there is no unique solution for z, the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, which can be expressed as:\n\nx = 3\ny = 0.5z\nz = z, where z can be any real number."
