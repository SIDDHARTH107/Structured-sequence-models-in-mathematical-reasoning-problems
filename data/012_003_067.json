    "message_2": "To find the maximum independent set of vertices in G, we first need to understand the structure of the graph. The adjacency matrix represents the connections between the vertices:\n\n0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4\n|       |       |\n+-------+-------+\n|       |       |\n3 - 2 - 1 - 0 - 1\n\nFrom the adjacency matrix and the graph structure, we can see that the graph is bipartite. In a bipartite graph, the maximum independent set can be found by selecting all the vertices in one of the two disjoint sets. In this case, we can choose either the set {0, 2, 4} or the set {1, 3}. Both sets have 3 vertices, so the maximum independent set of vertices in G has a size of 3.\n\nThus, the maximum independent set of vertices in G is either {0, 2, 4} or {1, 3}."
