    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate y from the first and second equations. To do this, we will add the first and second equations:\n\nx + y + 2z = 7\n2x - y + z = 4\n-------------------\n3x + 3z = 11\n\nNow, we will divide the resulting equation by 3:\n\nx + z = 11/3\n\nNext, we will eliminate y from the first and third equations. To do this, we will subtract the first equation from the third equation:\n\n3x + y + 4z = 16\n-(x + y + 2z = 7)\n-------------------\n2x + 2z = 9\n\nNow, we will divide the resulting equation by 2:\n\nx + z = 9/2\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables:\n\nx + z = 11/3\nx + z = 9/2\n\nSince both equations have the same left-hand side (x + z), we can set their right-hand sides equal to each other:\n\n11/3 = 9/2\n\nTo solve for x, we will cross-multiply:\n\n11 * 2 = 9 * 3\n22 = 27\n\nThis equation is not true, which means there is no solution to the given system of linear equations. The system is inconsistent."
