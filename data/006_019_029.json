    "message_1": "Suppose that in a particular country, there are three main political parties, A, B, and C, and that the probability of a citizen supporting Party A is 0.4, supporting Party B is 0.3, and supporting Party C is 0.3. What is the probability that a randomly selected group of 100 citizens from this country will have more than 40 supporters of Party A?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, k supporters of Party A) in n trials (in this case, 100 citizens)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a citizen supporting Party A, which is 0.4)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100 citizens)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of supporters of Party A)\n\nWe want to find the probability that a randomly selected group of 100 citizens will have more than 40 supporters of Party A. In other words, we want to find the probability P(X > 40). To do this, we can calculate the complementary probability P(X ≤ 40) and then subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X > 40) = 1 - P(X ≤ 40)\n\nP(X ≤ 40) is the sum of the probabilities of having 0 to 40 supporters of Party A:\n\nP(X ≤ 40) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 40)\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate each of these probabilities and sum them up:\n\nP(X ≤ 40) = Σ [C(100, k) * (0.4)^k * (0.6)^(100-k)] for k = 0 to 40\n\nAfter calculating this sum, we get:\n\nP(X ≤ 40) ≈ 0.9428\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having more than 40 supporters of Party A:\n\nP(X > 40) = 1 - P(X ≤ 40) = 1 - 0.9428 ≈ 0.0572\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected group of 100 citizens from this country will have more than 40 supporters of Party A is approximately 0.0572 or 5.72%."
