    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points in the space. In the given metric, the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:\n\n$$d = \\sqrt{4(x_2 - x_1)^2 + 9(y_2 - y_1)^2}$$\n\nWe want to find all transformations $(x', y') = T(x, y)$ such that the distance between any two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is the same as the distance between their images $(x_1', y_1')$ and $(x_2', y_2')$ under the transformation $T$.\n\nLet's consider the following types of transformations:\n\n1. Translations: $(x', y') = (x + a, y + b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.\n2. Rotations: $(x', y') = (x \\cos \\theta - y \\sin \\theta, x \\sin \\theta + y \\cos \\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the rotation angle.\n3. Reflections: $(x', y') = (x, -y)$ or $(x', y') = (-x, y)$.\n\nWe will now check if these transformations preserve the distance.\n\n1. Translations:\n\n$$d' = \\sqrt{4(x_2' - x_1')^2 + 9(y_2' - y_1')^2} = \\sqrt{4((x_2 + a) - (x_1 + a))^2 + 9((y_2 + b) - (y_1 + b))^2} = \\sqrt{4(x_2 - x_1)^2 + 9(y_2 - y_1)^2} = d$$\n\nTranslations preserve the distance.\n\n2. Rotations:\n\n$$d' = \\sqrt{4((x_2 \\cos \\theta - y_2 \\sin \\theta) - (x_1 \\cos \\theta - y_1 \\sin \\theta))^2 + 9((x_2 \\sin \\theta + y_2 \\cos \\theta) - (x_1 \\sin \\theta + y_1 \\cos \\theta))^2}$$\n\n$$= \\sqrt{4(x_2 - x_1)^2 \\cos^2 \\theta + 9(y_2 - y_1)^2 \\sin^2 \\theta + 4(x_2 - x_1)(y_1 - y_2)(\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta) + 9(x_2 - x_1)(y_2 - y_1)(\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta)}$$\n\nFor rotations to be isometries, we need to find a value of $\\theta$ such that the above expression is equal to $d$. However, there is no such value of $\\theta$ that satisfies this condition. Therefore, rotations are not isometries for this metric.\n\n3. Reflections:\n\nFor the reflection $(x', y') = (x, -y)$:\n\n$$d' = \\sqrt{4(x_2' - x_1')^2 + 9(y_2' - y_1')^2} = \\sqrt{4(x_2 - x_1)^2 + 9(-y_2 + y_1)^2} = \\sqrt{4(x_2 - x_1)^2 + 9(y_2 - y_1)^2} = d$$\n\nFor the reflection $(x', y') = (-x, y)$:\n\n$$d' = \\sqrt{4(x_2' - x_1')^2 + 9(y_2' - y_1')^2} = \\sqrt{4(-x_2 + x_1)^2 + 9(y_2 - y_1)^2} = \\sqrt{4(x_2 - x_1)^2 + 9(y_2 - y_1)^2} = d$$\n\nReflections preserve the distance.\n\nSo, the isometries of this metric are translations and reflections. Now, let's check if they form a group.\n\n1. Closure: The composition of two translations is a translation, and the composition of two reflections is either a translation or a reflection. The composition of a translation and a reflection is a reflection. Therefore, the set of isometries is closed under composition.\n\n2. Associativity: The composition of transformations is associative.\n\n3. Identity: The identity transformation is a translation with $a = 0$ and $b = 0$.\n\n4. Inverse: The inverse of a translation is a translation with $-a$ and $-b$. The inverse of a reflection is the reflection itself.\n\nSince the isometries satisfy all the group axioms, they form a group."
