    "message_2": "The Bat Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the echolocation behavior of microbats. It was proposed by Xin-She Yang in 2010. The algorithm is used to find the global minimum of a given objective function. In this case, we want to minimize the function f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 4.\n\nTo implement the Bat Algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialization: Generate a population of 20 bats with random positions and velocities within the given range (-10 ≤ x ≤ 10). Set the initial frequency fmin = 0, loudness A = 1, pulse rate r = 0.5, and frequency difference Δfmax = 0.1.\n\n2. Iteration: For each iteration (up to a maximum of 100 iterations), perform the following steps:\n\n   a. Update the frequency, velocity, and position of each bat.\n   \n   b. Generate a new solution for each bat by adjusting the frequency, velocity, and position.\n   \n   c. Apply a random walk if the pulse rate is greater than a random number between 0 and 1.\n   \n   d. Evaluate the new solution and update the bat's position and velocity if the new solution is better and the loudness is greater than a random number between 0 and 1.\n   \n   e. Update the global best solution if a better solution is found.\n   \n   f. Update the loudness and pulse rate of each bat.\n\n3. Termination: After 100 iterations, the algorithm terminates, and the global best solution is returned as the minimum value of the function f(x).\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the Bat Algorithm for the given problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 + 3*x + 4\n\ndef bat_algorithm(population_size, max_iterations, fmin, A, r, delta_fmax, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    bats = np.random.uniform(lower_bound, upper_bound, population_size)\n    velocities = np.zeros(population_size)\n    best_bat = bats[np.argmin([f(x) for x in bats])]\n    \n    for _ in range(max_iterations):\n        for i in range(population_size):\n            f_i = fmin + delta_fmax * np.random.random()\n            velocities[i] += (bats[i] - best_bat) * f_i\n            bats[i] += velocities[i]\n            \n            if np.random.random() > r:\n                bats[i] = best_bat + 0.001 * np.random.randn()\n            \n            if f(bats[i]) < f(best_bat) and np.random.random() < A:\n                best_bat = bats[i]\n                \n    return best_bat\n\npopulation_size = 20\nmax_iterations = 100\nfmin = 0\nA = 1\nr = 0.5\ndelta_fmax = 0.1\nlower_bound = -10\nupper_bound = 10\n\nbest_solution = bat_algorithm(population_size, max_iterations, fmin, A, r, delta_fmax, lower_bound, upper_bound)\nprint(\"Best solution found: x =\", best_solution)\nprint(\"Minimum value of f(x):\", f(best_solution))\n```\n\nThis implementation will return the best solution (x value) and the minimum value of the function f(x) after 100 iterations. Note that the results may vary due to the random nature of the algorithm."
