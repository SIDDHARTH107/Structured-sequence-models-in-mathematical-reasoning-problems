    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let $y = x^2$, then $x = \\sqrt{y}$ and $dx = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{y}}dy$. Now, we can rewrite the second derivative of $u(x)$ with respect to $y$:\n\n$u''(x) = \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = \\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\frac{du}{dy} \\cdot \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4y} + 0$.\n\nThus, $u''(x) = \\frac{1}{4y} \\frac{d^2u}{dy^2}$, and the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\n$-\\frac{1}{4y} \\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} + 4y u(y) = E u(y)$.\n\nNow, multiply both sides by $-4y$ to get rid of the fraction:\n\n$\\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} - 16y^2 u(y) = -4Ey u(y)$.\n\nThis is a Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem, and we are looking for the eigenvalue $E$ that satisfies the boundary condition $u(0) = u(y=0) = 1$. \n\nThe equation above is a form of the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a harmonic oscillator potential, which has well-known solutions in terms of Hermite polynomials. The general solution is given by:\n\n$u(y) = N H_n(\\sqrt{2}y) e^{-y}$,\n\nwhere $N$ is a normalization constant, $H_n$ is the $n$-th Hermite polynomial, and $n$ is a non-negative integer. The energy eigenvalue $E$ is related to $n$ by the formula:\n\n$E = 2n + 1$.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $n$ that satisfies the boundary condition $u(0) = 1$. Since $H_n(0) = 1$ for all even $n$, we can choose $n = 0$ to satisfy the boundary condition. Therefore, the corresponding energy eigenvalue is:\n\n$E = 2(0) + 1 = 1$.\n\nSo, the value of $E$ that satisfies the given condition is $E = 1$."
