    "message_2": "To find the degree of the Fano variety $X$, we need to compute the intersection number of the two hypersurfaces in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. \n\nLet $H_1$ be the hypersurface defined by $x^4+y^4+z^4+w^4=0$ and $H_2$ be the hypersurface defined by $x^3y+y^3z+z^3w+w^3x=0$. The degrees of $H_1$ and $H_2$ are 4 and 3, respectively, since those are the highest degrees of their defining polynomials.\n\nIn general, the intersection number of two hypersurfaces in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ is given by the product of their degrees. Therefore, the intersection number (and hence the degree of the Fano variety $X$) is:\n\nDegree of $X$ = Degree of $H_1$ × Degree of $H_2$ = 4 × 3 = 12.\n\nSo, the degree of the Fano variety $X$ is 12."
