    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of f(x), we need to compute the Fourier series representation of f(x). Since f(x) is a periodic function with period 1, we can use the following formulas for the Fourier coefficients:\n\na_n = 2 * ∫[0,1] f(x) * cos(2πnx) dx\nb_n = 2 * ∫[0,1] f(x) * sin(2πnx) dx\n\nwhere n is a non-negative integer.\n\nFirst, let's find the a_n coefficients. We need to split the integral into two parts, corresponding to the two parts of the function definition:\n\na_n = 2 * [∫[0,1/4] 4x * cos(2πnx) dx + ∫[1/4,1/2] 4(1/2 - x) * cos(2πnx) dx]\n\nNow, we can integrate each part:\n\n∫[0,1/4] 4x * cos(2πnx) dx = [4x * (sin(2πnx) / (2πn)) + (cos(2πnx) / (4π²n²))] evaluated from 0 to 1/4\n\n∫[1/4,1/2] 4(1/2 - x) * cos(2πnx) dx = [-4(1/2 - x) * (sin(2πnx) / (2πn)) - (cos(2πnx) / (4π²n²))] evaluated from 1/4 to 1/2\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integrals at their limits and subtract:\n\na_n = 2 * [(4(1/4) * (sin(πn/2) / (πn)) + (cos(πn/2) / (4π²n²)) - (cos(0) / (4π²n²))) - (-4(1/4 - 1/2) * (sin(πn) / (πn)) - (cos(πn) / (4π²n²)) + (cos(πn/2) / (4π²n²)))]\n\na_n = 2 * [(sin(πn/2) / (πn)) + (cos(πn/2) / (4π²n²)) - (1 / (4π²n²)) + (sin(πn) / (πn)) - (cos(πn) / (4π²n²)) + (cos(πn/2) / (4π²n²))]\n\na_n = 2 * [(sin(πn/2) / (πn)) + (sin(πn) / (πn))]\n\nNow, let's find the b_n coefficients. Since f(x) is an even function, all b_n coefficients will be zero:\n\nb_n = 2 * ∫[0,1] f(x) * sin(2πnx) dx = 0\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of f(x) in the frequency domain:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(2πnx) + b_n * sin(2πnx)]\n\nSince b_n = 0, the frequency domain representation of f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(2πnx)]\n\nwhere a_n = 2 * [(sin(πn/2) / (πn)) + (sin(πn) / (πn))] and n is a non-negative integer."
