    "message_2": "The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr³, where V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nGiven a radius of 7 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(7³)\nV = (4/3)π(343)\nV ≈ 1436.8 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is approximately 1436.8 cubic centimeters, rounded to the nearest tenth."
