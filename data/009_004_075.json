Find the equation of motion for this system and determine the time it takes for the mass to complete one full oscillation.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion for this system, we can use Hooke's Law and Newton's second law of motion. Hooke's Law states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position:\n\nF = -kx\n\nwhere F is the force exerted by the spring, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nNewton's second law of motion states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:\n\nF = ma\n\nCombining these two equations, we get:\n\nma = -kx\n\nSince we are given the mass (m = 2 kg) and the spring constant (k = 25 N/m), we can write the equation of motion as:\n\n2a = -25x\n\nTo find the acceleration (a) as a function of displacement (x), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\na = -(25/2)x\n\nThis is a simple harmonic motion equation, and the general form of the equation for simple harmonic motion is:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement as a function of time, A is the amplitude of the motion, ω is the angular frequency, t is time, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nThe angular frequency (ω) can be found using the formula:\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nω = √(25/2) = 5/√2 rad/s\n\nSince the mass is initially displaced by 0.1 m and then released, the initial phase angle (φ) is 0, and the amplitude (A) is 0.1 m. Therefore, the equation of motion for this system is:\n\nx(t) = 0.1 * cos((5/√2)t)\n\nNow, to find the time it takes for the mass to complete one full oscillation (the period T), we can use the formula:\n\nT = 2π/ω\n\nPlugging in the value for ω:\n\nT = 2π/(5/√2) = (2√2π)/5\n\nSo, the time it takes for the mass to complete one full oscillation is approximately:\n\nT ≈ 0.886 s"
