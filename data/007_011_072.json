    "message_2": "A quadratic residue is a number that can be represented as the square of some integer modulo the given modulus. To find the quadratic residue of 29 modulo 7, we first need to find the remainder of 29 when divided by 7.\n\n29 ≡ 1 (mod 7) since 29 = 7 * 4 + 1\n\nNow, we need to find an integer x such that x^2 ≡ 1 (mod 7). In this case, x can be 1 or -1 (which is equivalent to 6 modulo 7).\n\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n(-1)^2 ≡ 6^2 ≡ 36 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the quadratic residue of 29 modulo 7 is 1."
