    "message_1": "Suppose two companies, A and B, are competing in the market to sell identical products. Each company has a production cost of $10 per unit. Company A decides to sell its product at $20 per unit, while Company B decides to sell its product at $18 per unit. How many units will Company B need to sell in order to gain a larger market share than Company A?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of units sold by Company A as x and the number of units sold by Company B as y. In order for Company B to have a larger market share than Company A, it needs to sell more units, so y > x.\n\nSince both companies sell identical products, we can assume that the only factor affecting the consumers' decision is the price. Therefore, the ratio of the number of units sold by Company A to the number of units sold by Company B should be inversely proportional to the ratio of their prices:\n\nx / y = 18 / 20\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest integer values for x and y that satisfy this equation and the condition y > x.\n\nWe can simplify the equation:\n\nx / y = 9 / 10\n\nTo find the smallest integer values, we can multiply both sides by 10:\n\n10x = 9y\n\nNow, we can start testing integer values for y and check if the resulting x is also an integer:\n\n1. If y = 1, then 10x = 9, which means x = 9/10 (not an integer)\n2. If y = 2, then 10x = 18, which means x = 18/10 = 9/5 (not an integer)\n3. If y = 3, then 10x = 27, which means x = 27/10 (not an integer)\n4. If y = 4, then 10x = 36, which means x = 36/10 = 18/5 (not an integer)\n5. If y = 5, then 10x = 45, which means x = 45/10 = 9/2 (not an integer)\n6. If y = 6, then 10x = 54, which means x = 54/10 = 27/5 (not an integer)\n7. If y = 7, then 10x = 63, which means x = 63/10 (not an integer)\n8. If y = 8, then 10x = 72, which means x = 72/10 = 36/5 (not an integer)\n9. If y = 9, then 10x = 81, which means x = 81/10 (not an integer)\n10. If y = 10, then 10x = 90, which means x = 90/10 = 9 (an integer)\n\nSo, the smallest integer values that satisfy the equation are x = 9 and y = 10. This means that Company B needs to sell at least 10 units to gain a larger market share than Company A."
