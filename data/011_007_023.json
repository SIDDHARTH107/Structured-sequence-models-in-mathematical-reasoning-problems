    "message_2": "To select the team captain and vice-captain, we need to find the number of permutations of 2 positions from a set of 11 players. We can use the given recurrence relation to find the number of permutations.\n\nFirst, let's find the base case, $P_1$. Since there is only one element, there is only one way to arrange it:\n\n$P_1 = 1$\n\nNow, we can use the recurrence relation to find $P_2$:\n\n$P_2 = 2P_{2-1} = 2P_1 = 2(1) = 2$\n\nThis means there are 2 ways to arrange 2 elements. However, we need to find the number of permutations for 11 players, so we need to continue using the recurrence relation until we reach $P_{11}$:\n\n$P_3 = 3P_{3-1} = 3P_2 = 3(2) = 6$\n\n$P_4 = 4P_{4-1} = 4P_3 = 4(6) = 24$\n\n$P_5 = 5P_{5-1} = 5P_4 = 5(24) = 120$\n\n$P_6 = 6P_{6-1} = 6P_5 = 6(120) = 720$\n\n$P_7 = 7P_{7-1} = 7P_6 = 7(720) = 5040$\n\n$P_8 = 8P_{8-1} = 8P_7 = 8(5040) = 40320$\n\n$P_9 = 9P_{9-1} = 9P_8 = 9(40320) = 362880$\n\n$P_{10} = 10P_{10-1} = 10P_9 = 10(362880) = 3628800$\n\n$P_{11} = 11P_{11-1} = 11P_{10} = 11(3628800) = 39916800$\n\nSo, there are 39,916,800 ways to arrange 11 players. However, we only need to select 2 positions (captain and vice-captain) from these 11 players. To do this, we can use the formula for the number of permutations of selecting r elements from a set of n elements:\n\n$P(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$\n\nIn our case, n = 11 and r = 2:\n\n$P(11, 2) = \\frac{11!}{(11-2)!} = \\frac{39916800}{9!} = \\frac{39916800}{362880} = 110$\n\nSo, there are 110 ways to select the team captain and vice-captain from a football team of 11 players."
