    "message_2": "To find the optimal control function u(t) that minimizes the objective function J, we can use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, let's define the Hamiltonian function H:\n\nH = y^2(t) + u^2(t) + λ(t)[u(t) - y''(t) - 2y'(t) - y(t)]\n\nwhere λ(t) is the costate variable (also known as the adjoint variable).\n\nThe necessary conditions for the optimal control are given by:\n\n1. The state equation: y'' + 2y' + y = u\n2. The costate equation: -λ'(t) = ∂H/∂y = 2y(t) - λ(t)\n3. The transversality condition: λ(T) = 0\n4. The minimum condition: ∂H/∂u = 0 => 2u(t) + λ(t) = 0\n\nFrom the minimum condition, we have:\n\nu(t) = -1/2 * λ(t)\n\nNow, we need to solve the costate equation:\n\n-λ'(t) = 2y(t) - λ(t)\n\nLet's solve this first-order linear differential equation using an integrating factor. The integrating factor is:\n\nIF = e^(∫-1 dt) = e^(-t)\n\nMultiply the costate equation by the integrating factor:\n\n-e^(-t)λ'(t) - e^(-t)λ(t) = 2e^(-t)y(t)\n\nNow, the left side is the derivative of the product -e^(-t)λ(t):\n\nd/dt[-e^(-t)λ(t)] = 2e^(-t)y(t)\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫d/dt[-e^(-t)λ(t)] dt = ∫2e^(-t)y(t) dt\n-e^(-t)λ(t) = 2∫e^(-t)y(t) dt + C\n\nNow, apply the transversality condition λ(T) = 0:\n\n0 = 2∫[0,5] e^(-t)y(t) dt + C\nC = -2∫[0,5] e^(-t)y(t) dt\n\nThus, we have:\n\n-e^(-t)λ(t) = 2∫[t,5] e^(-s)y(s) ds - 2∫[0,5] e^(-s)y(s) ds\n\nNow, we can find the optimal control function u(t):\n\nu(t) = -1/2 * λ(t) = 1/2 * e^(-t) * [2∫[t,5] e^(-s)y(s) ds - 2∫[0,5] e^(-s)y(s) ds]\n\nThis is the optimal control function u(t) that minimizes the objective function J subject to the given initial conditions and T = 5."
