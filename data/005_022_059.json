Then, remove the outlier 21 from the dataset and recalculate the median and mean. Finally, explain which measure of central tendency (median or mean) is more robust to outliers in this specific dataset.",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the median and mean of the dataset with all 10 numbers:\n\nDataset: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21\n\nTo find the median, we need to find the middle value(s) of the dataset. Since there are 10 numbers, we take the average of the 5th and 6th values:\n\nMedian = (11 + 13) / 2 = 12\n\nTo find the mean, we sum all the numbers and divide by the total count:\n\nMean = (3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 + 21) / 10 = 120 / 10 = 12\n\nNow, let's remove the outlier 21 and recalculate the median and mean:\n\nNew dataset: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19\n\nThe new dataset has 9 numbers, so the median is the 5th value:\n\nNew Median = 11\n\nTo find the new mean, we sum all the numbers in the new dataset and divide by the total count:\n\nNew Mean = (3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19) / 9 = 99 / 9 = 11\n\nComparing the original and new median and mean values, we can see that the median changed from 12 to 11, while the mean changed from 12 to 11 as well. In this specific dataset, both the median and mean were affected by the removal of the outlier. However, in general, the median is considered more robust to outliers because it is less influenced by extreme values. In this case, the change in both median and mean was relatively small, but in datasets with more extreme outliers, the median would typically be less affected than the mean."
