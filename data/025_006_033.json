    "message_2": "To compute the first cohomology group $H^1(X,\\mathbb{Q})$, we will use the long exact sequence associated with the exponential sequence of sheaves on $X$:\n\n$$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathcal{O}_X \\to \\mathcal{O}_X^* \\to 0$$\n\nHere, $\\mathcal{O}_X$ is the structure sheaf of $X$, and $\\mathcal{O}_X^*$ is the sheaf of invertible elements in $\\mathcal{O}_X$. Taking the cohomology of this sequence, we get the long exact sequence:\n\n$$0 \\to H^0(X,\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^0(X,\\mathcal{O}_X) \\to H^0(X,\\mathcal{O}_X^*) \\to H^1(X,\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^1(X,\\mathcal{O}_X) \\to H^1(X,\\mathcal{O}_X^*) \\to \\cdots$$\n\nNow, we will compute the relevant cohomology groups:\n\n1. $H^0(X,\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, since the global sections of the constant sheaf $\\mathbb{Z}$ are just the integers.\n\n2. $H^0(X,\\mathcal{O}_X) = \\mathbb{Q}$, since the global sections of the structure sheaf $\\mathcal{O}_X$ are just the rational functions on $X$ that are regular everywhere, which are the constant functions.\n\n3. $H^0(X,\\mathcal{O}_X^*) = \\mathbb{Q}^*$, since the global sections of the sheaf $\\mathcal{O}_X^*$ are just the nonzero constant functions.\n\n4. $H^1(X,\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, since the first cohomology of a curve with coefficients in a constant sheaf is always zero.\n\n5. $H^1(X,\\mathcal{O}_X) = 0$, since the first cohomology of a curve with coefficients in the structure sheaf is always zero.\n\nNow, we can compute $H^1(X,\\mathcal{O}_X^*)$ using the long exact sequence:\n\n$$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Q}^* \\to 0 \\to H^1(X,\\mathcal{O}_X) \\to H^1(X,\\mathcal{O}_X^*) \\to \\cdots$$\n\nSince $H^1(X,\\mathcal{O}_X) = 0$, we have an isomorphism $H^1(X,\\mathcal{O}_X^*) \\cong \\mathrm{coker}(\\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Q}^*)$. The map $\\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Q}^*$ is given by $a \\mapsto e^{2\\pi i a}$, and its cokernel is the group of complex numbers of the form $e^{2\\pi i a}$ with $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $H^1(X,\\mathcal{O}_X^*) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}$, and since $H^1(X,\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, we get $H^1(X,\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}$."
