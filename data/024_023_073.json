    "message_2": "To determine the group of isometries that preserve the torus, we first need to understand the symmetries of the torus. The torus is a product of two circles, one in the u-direction and one in the v-direction. The equation of the torus can be written as:\n\n((cos(u) + 3)² + (sin(u) - 4)²) + ((cos(v) + 1)² + (sin(v) - 2)²) = 4\n\nThis equation represents a torus centered at (-3, 4) in the u-plane and (-1, 2) in the v-plane, with radii of 2 in both planes.\n\nThe group of isometries that preserve a circle consists of rotations and reflections. In the case of a torus, we have two circles, one in the u-direction and one in the v-direction. Therefore, the group of isometries that preserve the torus will be a combination of rotations and reflections in both the u and v directions.\n\nLet's consider the possible isometries:\n\n1. Rotation in the u-direction by an angle α: (u, v) -> (u + α, v)\n2. Rotation in the v-direction by an angle β: (u, v) -> (u, v + β)\n3. Reflection in the u-direction: (u, v) -> (-u, v)\n4. Reflection in the v-direction: (u, v) -> (u, -v)\n\nThese isometries can be combined in various ways, leading to a total of 8 possible isometries:\n\n1. Identity: (u, v) -> (u, v)\n2. Rotation in the u-direction: (u, v) -> (u + α, v)\n3. Rotation in the v-direction: (u, v) -> (u, v + β)\n4. Reflection in the u-direction: (u, v) -> (-u, v)\n5. Reflection in the v-direction: (u, v) -> (u, -v)\n6. Rotation in the u-direction followed by reflection in the v-direction: (u, v) -> (u + α, -v)\n7. Rotation in the v-direction followed by reflection in the u-direction: (u, v) -> (-u, v + β)\n8. Rotation in both the u and v directions: (u, v) -> (u + α, v + β)\n\nThese 8 isometries form the group of isometries that preserve the given torus. Note that α and β can be any multiples of 2π, as the torus is periodic in both the u and v directions."
