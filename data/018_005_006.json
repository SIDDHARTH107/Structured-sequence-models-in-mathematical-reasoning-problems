    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to consider a universal set U that contains all the elements including the elements of set A. Let's assume that the universal set U contains the elements from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. \n\nNow, the complement of set A, denoted by A', contains all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. So, A' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nTo find the intersection between set A and its complement A', we need to find the elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no elements that are common to both A and A'. Therefore, the intersection of set A and its complement A' is the empty set, denoted by ∅.\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nThis shows that the intersection between set A and its complement A' is equal to the empty set."
