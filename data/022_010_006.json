    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 2z + 3)/(z - 1) centered at z = 3, we first perform a change of variable. Let w = z - 3, then z = w + 3. We rewrite the function in terms of w:\n\nf(w) = ((w + 3)^2 + 2(w + 3) + 3)/(w + 3 - 1) = (w^2 + 6w + 9 + 2w + 6 + 3)/(w + 2)\n\nNow, we have the function f(w) = (w^2 + 8w + 18)/(w + 2).\n\nNext, we perform long division to find the Laurent series:\n\n          w + 6\n        _________\nw + 2 | w^2 + 8w + 18\n        - (w^2 + 2w)\n        __________\n                6w + 18\n                - (6w + 12)\n                _________\n                        6\n\nSo, f(w) = w + 6 + 6/(w + 2).\n\nNow, we need to find the Laurent series for the term 6/(w + 2). We can rewrite this term as:\n\n6/(w + 2) = 6/(1 + (w - 1)) = 6 * 1/(1 - (1 - w))\n\nNow, we can use the geometric series formula:\n\n1/(1 - x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...\n\nSo, we have:\n\n6 * 1/(1 - (1 - w)) = 6 * (1 + (1 - w) + (1 - w)^2 + (1 - w)^3 + ...)\n\nExpanding the series, we get:\n\n6 + 6(1 - w) + 6(1 - w)^2 + 6(1 - w)^3 + ...\n\nNow, we substitute back z = w + 3:\n\nf(z) = (z - 3) + 6 + 6(3 - z) + 6(3 - z)^2 + 6(3 - z)^3 + ...\n\nNow, we find the radius of convergence. Since the Laurent series is a geometric series with a common ratio of (3 - z), the radius of convergence is given by:\n\n|3 - z| < 1\n\n-1 < 3 - z < 1\n\n2 < z < 4\n\nThus, the radius of convergence is 1, centered at z = 3."
