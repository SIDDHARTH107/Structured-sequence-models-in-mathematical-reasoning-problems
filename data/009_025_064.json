    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve based on the Black-Scholes-Merton equation for option pricing with stochastic volatility:\n\nSuppose a stock price follows the geometric Brownian motion with initial value $S(0) = 100$, drift rate $\\mu = 0.05$, and volatility coefficient that follows a stochastic process $d\\sigma(t) = 0.2\\sigma(t)dW(t)$, where $W(t)$ is a Wiener process. A call option with strike price $K = 110$ and expiration time $T = 1$ year is sold at a premium of $10$. Determine the fair price of the option using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation.",
    "message_2": "To determine the fair price of the option using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation, we first need to find the average volatility of the stock. Since the volatility follows a stochastic process, we can't use the given volatility directly. Instead, we'll assume an average volatility, say $\\sigma = 0.2$ (which is a common assumption in such problems).\n\nNow, we can use the Black-Scholes-Merton equation for pricing a call option:\n\n$C(S, t) = S N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)$,\n\nwhere\n$C(S, t)$ is the call option price,\n$S$ is the stock price,\n$K$ is the strike price,\n$r$ is the risk-free interest rate,\n$T$ is the time to expiration,\n$N(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and\n$d_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}} \\left[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{S}{K} \\right) + \\left( r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\right) T \\right]$,\n$d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T}$.\n\nLet's assume a risk-free interest rate of $r = 0.03$. Then, we can calculate $d_1$ and $d_2$:\n\n$d_1 = \\frac{1}{0.2 \\sqrt{1}} \\left[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{100}{110} \\right) + \\left( 0.03 + \\frac{0.2^2}{2} \\right) 1 \\right] \\approx -0.3347$,\n$d_2 = -0.3347 - 0.2 \\sqrt{1} \\approx -0.5347$.\n\nNow, we can find the cumulative distribution function values for $d_1$ and $d_2$:\n\n$N(d_1) \\approx 0.3690$,\n$N(d_2) \\approx 0.2969$.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the call option price:\n\n$C(100, 0) = 100 \\times 0.3690 - 110 e^{-0.03 \\times 1} \\times 0.2969 \\approx 7.97$.\n\nSo, the fair price of the call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation is approximately $7.97. Note that this is an approximation, as we assumed an average volatility of 0.2. In practice, one would use more advanced techniques to estimate the volatility more accurately."
