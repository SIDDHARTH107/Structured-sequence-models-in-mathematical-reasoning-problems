    "message_2": "Yes, I can help you solve this problem. \n\nLet X be a topological space that can be covered by two open sets U and V, with U ∪ V = X. We want to show that it is always possible to define a smooth structure on X so that U and V are both smoothly embedded submanifolds of X.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of a smooth structure. A smooth structure on a topological space X is a maximal smooth atlas, which is a collection of charts (homeomorphisms from open subsets of X to open subsets of R^n) that are smoothly compatible with each other. Smoothly compatible means that the transition maps (compositions of charts) are smooth functions.\n\nNow, let's construct a smooth structure on X. Since U and V are open sets in X, we can define charts φ: U → R^n and ψ: V → R^n, where φ and ψ are homeomorphisms. We can choose these charts such that their transition maps are smooth functions. In other words, we want the compositions φ^(-1) ◦ ψ and ψ^(-1) ◦ φ to be smooth functions.\n\nConsider the intersection U ∩ V. Since U and V are open sets, their intersection is also an open set. We can define a chart on U ∩ V as the restriction of φ to U ∩ V, denoted by φ|_(U ∩ V). Similarly, we can define a chart on U ∩ V as the restriction of ψ to U ∩ V, denoted by ψ|_(U ∩ V).\n\nNow, let's check the smooth compatibility of these charts. The transition maps are given by:\n\n1. (φ|_(U ∩ V))^(-1) ◦ ψ|_(U ∩ V) = φ^(-1) ◦ ψ, which is smooth by our choice of φ and ψ.\n2. (ψ|_(U ∩ V))^(-1) ◦ φ|_(U ∩ V) = ψ^(-1) ◦ φ, which is also smooth by our choice of φ and ψ.\n\nSince the transition maps are smooth, the charts φ|_(U ∩ V) and ψ|_(U ∩ V) are smoothly compatible. We can then extend these charts to a maximal smooth atlas on X, which defines a smooth structure on X.\n\nFinally, we need to show that U and V are smoothly embedded submanifolds of X. Since U and V are open sets in X, they are also submanifolds of X. Moreover, the charts φ and ψ are smoothly compatible, which means that U and V are smoothly embedded submanifolds of X.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that it is always possible to define a smooth structure on X so that U and V are both smoothly embedded submanifolds of X."
