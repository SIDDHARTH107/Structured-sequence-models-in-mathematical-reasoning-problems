Find the equation of the unique plane that is tangent to $C_1$ at a point $p$ and to $C_2$ at a point $q$, where $p$ and $q$ are given points on the respective curves. \n\nFor example, let $C_1$ be the curve given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9$, and let $C_2$ be the curve given by the equation $\\frac{x^2}{4} + \\frac{y^2}{9} + \\frac{z^2}{16} = 1$. Let $p = (0,-3,0)$ be a point on $C_1$ and let $q = (2,0,0)$ be a point on $C_2$. Find the equation of the plane that is tangent to $C_1$ at $p$ and to $C_2$ at $q$.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane, we first need to find the normal vectors to the surfaces at points $p$ and $q$. We can do this by finding the gradient of the respective functions at those points.\n\nFor $C_1$, the equation is $F_1(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 9 = 0$. The gradient of $F_1$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla F_1(x, y, z) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial z}\\right) = (2x, 2y, 2z)$\n\nAt point $p = (0, -3, 0)$, the normal vector to $C_1$ is:\n\n$\\nabla F_1(0, -3, 0) = (0, -6, 0)$\n\nFor $C_2$, the equation is $F_2(x, y, z) = \\frac{x^2}{4} + \\frac{y^2}{9} + \\frac{z^2}{16} - 1 = 0$. The gradient of $F_2$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla F_2(x, y, z) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial z}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{x}{2}, \\frac{2y}{9}, \\frac{z}{8}\\right)$\n\nAt point $q = (2, 0, 0)$, the normal vector to $C_2$ is:\n\n$\\nabla F_2(2, 0, 0) = (1, 0, 0)$\n\nNow, we have the normal vectors to the surfaces at points $p$ and $q$. Since the tangent plane is tangent to both surfaces, its normal vector must be a linear combination of the normal vectors we found:\n\n$\\vec{n} = a \\nabla F_1(0, -3, 0) + b \\nabla F_2(2, 0, 0) = a(0, -6, 0) + b(1, 0, 0)$\n\nThe equation of the tangent plane can be written as:\n\n$(\\vec{n} \\cdot (x - p_x, y - p_y, z - p_z)) = 0$\n\nSubstituting the values of $\\vec{n}$ and $p = (0, -3, 0)$, we get:\n\n$(a(0, -6, 0) + b(1, 0, 0)) \\cdot (x - 0, y + 3, z - 0) = 0$\n\nExpanding the dot product, we get:\n\n$ax(-6) + by(3) + cz(0) = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $a$ and $b$. Since the plane is also tangent to $C_2$ at point $q = (2, 0, 0)$, we can substitute the values of $q$ into the equation of the tangent plane:\n\n$a(2)(-6) + b(0)(3) = 0$\n\nSolving for $a$, we get:\n\n$a = 0$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $a$ back into the equation of the tangent plane:\n\n$0x - 6y + 0z = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we get the equation of the tangent plane:\n\n$y = 0$"
