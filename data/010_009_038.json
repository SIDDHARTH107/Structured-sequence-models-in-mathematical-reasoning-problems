    "message_2": "To find the number of internal vertices in the triangular mesh, we can use Euler's formula for polyhedra, which states:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nV = 10 (vertices)\nE = 15 (edges)\nF = 7 (faces)\n\nPlugging these values into Euler's formula:\n\n10 - 15 + 7 = 2\n\n2 = 2\n\nSince the formula holds true, we know that the mesh is a valid polyhedron. Now, let's find the number of internal vertices. In a triangular mesh, each face has 3 edges, and each internal vertex is connected to 3 edges. Therefore, the number of internal vertices can be found by dividing the total number of edges by 3:\n\nInternal vertices = Total edges / 3\nInternal vertices = 15 / 3\nInternal vertices = 5\n\nSo, the triangular mesh has 5 internal vertices."
