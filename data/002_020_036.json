    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius is 5 cm and the central angle is 120°. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (120/360) × 2π(5)\nArc length = (1/3) × 10π\nArc length = 10π/3 cm\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2r\nPerimeter = (10π/3) + 2(5)\nPerimeter = 10π/3 + 10\n\nThe perimeter of the sector is (10π/3) + 10 cm."
