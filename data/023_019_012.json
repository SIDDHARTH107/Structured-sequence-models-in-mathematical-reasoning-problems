    "message_2": "To find the transfer function of the system, we first need to take the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. The Fourier transform of a time-domain function x(t) is denoted by X(ω), where ω is the angular frequency. The Fourier transform of a derivative is given by:\n\nFourier{x'(t)} = jωX(ω)\nFourier{x''(t)} = (jω)^2X(ω) = -ω^2X(ω)\n\nNow, we can take the Fourier transform of the given differential equation:\n\nm(-ω^2X(ω)) + b(jωX(ω)) + kX(ω) = F(ω)\n\nNow, we can solve for the transfer function H(ω) = X(ω)/F(ω):\n\nX(ω) = F(ω) / (m(-ω^2) + b(jω) + k)\n\nH(ω) = 1 / (m(-ω^2) + b(jω) + k)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for m, b, and k:\n\nH(ω) = 1 / (1000(-ω^2) + 50(jω) + 40,000)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the system is stable for an applied force given by F(t) = 20sin(2πt). To do this, we need to find the Fourier transform of F(t):\n\nF(ω) = Fourier{20sin(2πt)} = 10j(δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π))\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we can find the response of the system in the frequency domain by multiplying the transfer function H(ω) with the Fourier transform of the applied force F(ω):\n\nX(ω) = H(ω)F(ω) = 10j(δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)) / (1000(-ω^2) + 50(jω) + 40,000)\n\nTo determine the stability of the system, we need to analyze the poles of the transfer function H(ω). The poles are the values of ω for which the denominator of H(ω) is zero:\n\n1000(-ω^2) + 50(jω) + 40,000 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in ω^2. We can find the roots (poles) using the quadratic formula:\n\nω^2 = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = -1000, b = 50j, and c = 40,000.\n\nThe discriminant Δ = b^2 - 4ac = (50j)^2 - 4(-1000)(40,000) = -2500 + 160,000,000 = 159,997,500.\n\nSince the discriminant Δ is positive, there are two distinct real roots for ω^2. However, since a = -1000 is negative, both roots for ω^2 will be negative, which means that the poles of H(ω) will have negative real parts. Therefore, the system is stable for the given applied force F(t) = 20sin(2πt)."
