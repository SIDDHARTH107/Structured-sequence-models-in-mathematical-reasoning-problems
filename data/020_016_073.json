    "message_1": "A steel beam is required to span a distance of 8 meters while supporting a load of 5000 N at its center. The beam has a rectangular cross-section and its height can vary from 20 mm to 60 mm, while its width can vary from 10 mm to 30 mm. What are the dimensions of the beam that will minimize its weight for this load? Assume the steel has a density of 7800 kg/m³.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the weight of the beam, we need to minimize the volume of the steel used while ensuring that it can support the given load. The volume of the beam can be expressed as:\n\nV = L * W * H\n\nwhere V is the volume, L is the length (8 meters), W is the width, and H is the height.\n\nThe weight of the beam can be calculated as:\n\nWeight = V * Density\n\nSince the density is constant, minimizing the volume will minimize the weight.\n\nTo ensure that the beam can support the given load, we need to consider the bending stress in the beam. The maximum bending stress can be calculated using the formula:\n\nσ = (M * S) / I\n\nwhere σ is the bending stress, M is the bending moment, S is the section modulus, and I is the moment of inertia.\n\nFor a simply supported beam with a point load at the center, the maximum bending moment (M) can be calculated as:\n\nM = (P * L) / 4\n\nwhere P is the load (5000 N) and L is the length (8 meters).\n\nThe moment of inertia (I) for a rectangular cross-section can be calculated as:\n\nI = (W * H^3) / 12\n\nThe section modulus (S) can be calculated as:\n\nS = I / (H / 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions W and H that minimize the volume while ensuring that the bending stress is within the allowable limits for the steel. This can be done using optimization techniques such as the method of Lagrange multipliers or by using numerical optimization algorithms.\n\nHowever, without knowing the allowable bending stress for the steel, we cannot determine the exact dimensions that will minimize the weight of the beam while supporting the given load."
