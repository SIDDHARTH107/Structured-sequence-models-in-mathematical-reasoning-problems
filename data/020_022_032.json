    "message_1": "A restaurant has a budget of $10,000 per month to buy chicken and beef. The cost of 1 kg of chicken is $2 and the cost of 1 kg of beef is $5. The restaurant needs to buy at least 1000 kg of meat per month, but no more than 3000 kg per month. \nWhat is the optimal allocation of resources that minimizes the cost for the restaurant while meeting their monthly demand for meat?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount of chicken (in kg) and y be the amount of beef (in kg) the restaurant buys. We want to minimize the cost function C(x, y) = 2x + 5y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. The total cost should not exceed $10,000: 2x + 5y ≤ 10,000\n2. The total amount of meat should be at least 1000 kg: x + y ≥ 1000\n3. The total amount of meat should not exceed 3000 kg: x + y ≤ 3000\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the inequalities:\n\n1. 2x + 5y ≤ 10,000\n   y ≤ (10,000 - 2x) / 5\n\n2. x + y ≥ 1000\n   y ≥ 1000 - x\n\n3. x + y ≤ 3000\n   y ≤ 3000 - x\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the systems of equations formed by the intersections of the inequalities:\n\nA. Intersection of (1) and (2):\n   y = (10,000 - 2x) / 5\n   y = 1000 - x\n   x = 2000, y = 1000\n\nB. Intersection of (1) and (3):\n   y = (10,000 - 2x) / 5\n   y = 3000 - x\n   x = 1000, y = 2000\n\nC. Intersection of (2) and (3):\n   y = 1000 - x\n   y = 3000 - x\n   No solution, as the two lines are parallel and do not intersect.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the cost function C(x, y) = 2x + 5y at the vertices A and B:\n\nA. C(2000, 1000) = 2(2000) + 5(1000) = 4,000 + 5,000 = 9,000\nB. C(1000, 2000) = 2(1000) + 5(2000) = 2,000 + 10,000 = 12,000\n\nThe minimum cost is $9,000, which occurs when the restaurant buys 2000 kg of chicken and 1000 kg of beef."
