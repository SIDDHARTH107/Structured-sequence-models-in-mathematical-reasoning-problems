    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms. Let's start by finding the tangent vectors with respect to u and v.\n\n∂x/∂u = 2\n∂y/∂u = 0\n∂z/∂u = 2u\n\n∂x/∂v = 0\n∂y/∂v = 2v\n∂z/∂v = 2v\n\nNow, let's find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = (∂x/∂u)^2 + (∂y/∂u)^2 + (∂z/∂u)^2 = 4 + 0 + 4u^2\nF = (∂x/∂u)(∂x/∂v) + (∂y/∂u)(∂y/∂v) + (∂z/∂u)(∂z/∂v) = 0\nG = (∂x/∂v)^2 + (∂y/∂v)^2 + (∂z/∂v)^2 = 0 + 4v^2 + 4v^2 = 8v^2\n\nNext, we need to compute the second fundamental form coefficients. For this, we need to find the normal vector N. We can find N by taking the cross product of the tangent vectors:\n\nN = ∂r/∂u × ∂r/∂v = (2, 0, 2u) × (0, 2v, 2v) = (-4uv, -4v^2, 4uv)\n\nNow, let's normalize N:\n\n|N| = √((-4uv)^2 + (-4v^2)^2 + (4uv)^2) = √(16u^2v^2 + 16v^4 + 16u^2v^2) = 4v√(u^2 + v^2)\n\nNormalized N = (-uv, -v^3, uv) / √(u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = N • (∂²x/∂u², ∂²y/∂u², ∂²z/∂u²) = 0\nM = N • (∂²x/∂u∂v, ∂²y/∂u∂v, ∂²z/∂u∂v) = 0\nN = N • (∂²x/∂v², ∂²y/∂v², ∂²z/∂v²) = (-uv, -v^3, uv) • (0, 2, 2) = -2v^3 + 2uv\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1, 1), we have:\n\nE = 4 + 0 + 4 = 8\nF = 0\nG = 8\nL = 0\nM = 0\nN = -2 + 2 = 0\n\nK = (0 - 0) / (8 * 8 - 0) = 0\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point (1, 1) is 0."
