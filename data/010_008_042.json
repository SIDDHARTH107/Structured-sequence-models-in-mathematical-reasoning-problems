    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a simplicial complex is given by the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, the simplicial complex has 3 vertices (V = 3) and 3 edges (E = 3). Since there is no face enclosed by the edges, F = 0.\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic is:\n\nχ = 3 - 3 + 0 = 0"
