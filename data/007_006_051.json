    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 252 and 105 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (252) by the smaller number (105) and find the remainder.\n   252 รท 105 = 2 with a remainder of 42.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (252) with the smaller number (105) and the smaller number with the remainder (42) from the previous step.\n\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the remainder is 0.\n\n   105 รท 42 = 2 with a remainder of 21.\n   42 รท 21 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 21.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of 252 and 105 is 21."
