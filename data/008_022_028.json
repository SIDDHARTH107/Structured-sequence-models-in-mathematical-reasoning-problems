    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations in the form of an augmented matrix:\n\n[ 2  3 | 10 ]\n[ 4  6 | 20 ]\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to obtain a row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1 in the first row:\n\n[ 1  1.5 | 5 ]\n[ 4  6  | 20 ]\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with the second row minus 4 times the first row to eliminate the leading 4 in the second row:\n\n[ 1  1.5 |  5  ]\n[ 0  0   |  0  ]\n\nNow, we have the row-echelon form of the matrix:\n\n[ 1  1.5 |  5 ]\n[ 0  0   |  0 ]\n\nFrom the second row, we have the equation 0x + 0y = 0, which is always true and doesn't provide any information about x and y. This means that we have an infinite number of solutions, and the system is dependent.\n\nTo check if the system is ill-conditioned, we can calculate the condition number of the coefficient matrix. The condition number is the product of the matrix's norm and its inverse's norm. If the condition number is large, the system is considered ill-conditioned.\n\nThe coefficient matrix A is:\n\n[ 2  3 ]\n[ 4  6 ]\n\nWe can see that the determinant of A is 0 (2*6 - 3*4 = 0), which means that A is singular and doesn't have an inverse. Since the matrix A doesn't have an inverse, we can't calculate the condition number. However, the fact that A is singular already indicates that the system is ill-conditioned.\n\nIn conclusion, the system of linear equations has an infinite number of solutions (dependent system) and is ill-conditioned."
