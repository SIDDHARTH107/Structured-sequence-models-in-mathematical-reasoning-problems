    "message_2": "A complete graph K_n is a graph with n vertices, where each vertex is connected to every other vertex by a single edge. In the case of K7, there are 7 vertices, and each vertex is connected to the other 6 vertices.\n\nThe genus of a graph is the minimum number of handles required to embed the graph on a surface without any edge crossings. To determine the genus of K7, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and the Ringel-Youngs formula for the genus of complete graphs.\n\nEuler's formula for planar graphs states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2,\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFor K7, V = 7. The number of edges in a complete graph can be calculated using the formula E = n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of vertices. In this case, E = 7(7-1)/2 = 21.\n\nNow, let's use the Ringel-Youngs formula for the genus g of a complete graph:\n\ng(K_n) = (n-3)(n-4)/12, for n â‰¥ 3.\n\nFor K7, n = 7, so:\n\ng(K7) = (7-3)(7-4)/12 = (4)(3)/12 = 12/12 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the genus of the complete graph K7 is 1. This means that K7 can be embedded on a surface with one handle (such as a torus) without any edge crossings."
