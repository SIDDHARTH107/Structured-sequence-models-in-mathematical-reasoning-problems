    "message_1": "A company is deciding whether to launch a new product or not. If they launch the product, there are two possible outcomes: it will either do well, earning them a profit of $500,000, or it will flop, resulting in a loss of $200,000. If they do not launch the product, there is no potential profit or loss. The company knows that there is a 50% chance of the product doing well and a 50% chance of it flopping. What should the company do to maximize expected profit?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best course of action, we need to calculate the expected profit for each option: launching the product and not launching the product.\n\n1. Launching the product:\nExpected profit = (probability of success * profit) + (probability of failure * loss)\nExpected profit = (0.5 * $500,000) + (0.5 * -$200,000)\nExpected profit = $250,000 + (-$100,000)\nExpected profit = $150,000\n\n2. Not launching the product:\nSince there is no potential profit or loss, the expected profit is $0.\n\nComparing the expected profits, launching the product has an expected profit of $150,000, while not launching the product has an expected profit of $0. Therefore, the company should launch the product to maximize their expected profit."
