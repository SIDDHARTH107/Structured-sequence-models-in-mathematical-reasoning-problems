    "message_1": "A manufacturer of candy bars claims that the mean weight of their candy bars is 8 ounces with a standard deviation of 0.5 ounces. A sample of 36 candy bars is selected at random from the production line. What is the probability that the average weight of the sample is less than 7.8 ounces? Note: You can use the central limit theorem to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the central limit theorem, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 7.8 ounces. The central limit theorem states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, μ = 8 ounces, σ = 0.5 ounces, and n = 36.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample means (σ_sample):\n\nσ_sample = σ / √n\nσ_sample = 0.5 / √36\nσ_sample = 0.5 / 6\nσ_sample = 0.0833 ounces\n\nNow, we can find the z-score for the sample mean of 7.8 ounces:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ_sample\nz = (7.8 - 8) / 0.0833\nz = -0.2 / 0.0833\nz = -2.4\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can find the probability that the average weight of the sample is less than 7.8 ounces using a z-table or calculator. Looking up the z-score of -2.4 in a z-table, we find that the probability is approximately 0.0082 or 0.82%.\n\nSo, there is a 0.82% chance that the average weight of the sample of 36 candy bars is less than 7.8 ounces."
