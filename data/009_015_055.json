Determine the half-life of Uranium-238 if the current amount of the element left in the sample is 1.56 grams. Remember that the half-life period is the time it takes for half of the material to decay.\n\n(Note: The half-life of Uranium-238 is 4.5 billion years)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nWhere:\n- N(t) is the amount of the element left after time t\n- N0 is the initial amount of the element\n- t is the time elapsed\n- T is the half-life of the element\n\nWe are given the initial amount (N0) as 12.5 grams and the current amount (N(t)) as 1.56 grams. We also know the half-life (T) of Uranium-238 is 4.5 billion years. We need to find the time elapsed (t).\n\n1.56 = 12.5 * (1/2)^(t/4.5)\n\nNow, we need to solve for t. First, divide both sides by 12.5:\n\n1.56 / 12.5 = (1/2)^(t/4.5)\n0.1248 = (1/2)^(t/4.5)\n\nNext, take the logarithm base 1/2 of both sides:\n\nlog_(1/2)(0.1248) = t/4.5\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 4.5 to isolate t:\n\nt = 4.5 * log_(1/2)(0.1248)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nt â‰ˆ 13.5 billion years\n\nSo, it takes approximately 13.5 billion years for the sample to decay from 12.5 grams to 1.56 grams."
