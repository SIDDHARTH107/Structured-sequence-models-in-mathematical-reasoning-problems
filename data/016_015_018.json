    "message_2": "The length of the Hilbert curve of order n can be found by multiplying the length of the curve of order n-1 (L) by 2 and then adding L. This is because each iteration of the Hilbert curve doubles the previous curve and adds an additional segment of the same length.\n\nSo, the length of the Hilbert curve of order n is:\n\nLength of order n = 2 * L + L = 3 * L"
