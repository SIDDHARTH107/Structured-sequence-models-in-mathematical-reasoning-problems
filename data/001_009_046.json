    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variables raised to the same power. In this case, we have three terms with the variable x and three terms with the variable y.\n\n8x - 2x - 7x = (8 - 2 - 7)x = -1x = -x\n\n3y + 5y + 2y = (3 + 5 + 2)y = 10y\n\nNow, we can combine the simplified x and y terms:\n\n- x + 10y"
