    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangular plot be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W\n\nSince the perimeter is 200 meters, we can write the equation as:\n\n200 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions that maximize the area. The area of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nWe can solve for one of the variables in the perimeter equation and substitute it into the area equation. Let's solve for W:\n\nW = (200 - 2L) / 2\nW = 100 - L\n\nNow, substitute this into the area equation:\n\nArea = L * (100 - L)\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area equation with respect to L and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Area)/dL = 100 - 2L = 0\n\nSolving for L:\n\n2L = 100\nL = 50\n\nNow, substitute this value of L back into the equation for W:\n\nW = 100 - 50\nW = 50\n\nSo, the dimensions that maximize the area of the rectangular plot are 50 meters by 50 meters."
