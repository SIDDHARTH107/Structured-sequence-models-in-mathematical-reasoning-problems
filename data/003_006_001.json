    "message_2": "Let's label the triangle as follows: Let A be the vertex with the 80-degree angle, B be the vertex with the 60-degree angle, and C be the remaining vertex. Let a be the side opposite angle A, b be the side opposite angle B, and c be the side opposite angle C. We are given that b = 8, angle B = 60 degrees, and angle A = 80 degrees. We want to find the length of side a.\n\nFirst, we need to find the measure of angle C. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have:\n\nangle C = 180 - angle A - angle B\nangle C = 180 - 80 - 60\nangle C = 40 degrees\n\nNow we can use the law of sines to find the length of side a. The law of sines states that:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nWe want to find a, so we will use the first part of the equation:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B)\n\nWe know that A = 80 degrees, B = 60 degrees, and b = 8. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\na/sin(80) = 8/sin(60)\n\nNow we can solve for a:\n\na = 8 * sin(80) / sin(60)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that sin(80) ≈ 0.9848 and sin(60) ≈ 0.8660. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\na ≈ 8 * 0.9848 / 0.8660\na ≈ 9.094\n\nTherefore, the length of the side opposite the 80-degree angle (side a) is approximately 9.094 units."
