    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of a series is less than 1, then the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{(x-3)^{n+1}}{(n+1)^3}}{\\frac{(x-3)^n}{n^3}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-3)n^3}{(n+1)^3}\\right|$$\n\nNow, we want to find when this limit is less than 1:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-3)n^3}{(n+1)^3}\\right| < 1$$\n\nSince the limit depends on x, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{n^3}{(n+1)^3}\\right| < \\frac{1}{|x-3|}$$\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the limit on the left side approaches 1:\n\n$$1 < \\frac{1}{|x-3|}$$\n\nThus, the radius of convergence (R) is:\n\n$$R = |x-3|$$\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the interval of convergence. Let's check x = 3 - R and x = 3 + R.\n\nFor x = 3 - R:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-R)^n}{n^3} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n R^n}{n^3}$$\n\nThis is an alternating series, and the terms decrease in magnitude and approach 0 as n approaches infinity. Therefore, by the Alternating Series Test, the series converges at x = 3 - R.\n\nFor x = 3 + R:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{R^n}{n^3}$$\n\nThis is a p-series with p = 3, which is greater than 1. Therefore, the series converges at x = 3 + R.\n\nSo, the interval of convergence is:\n\n$$[3 - R, 3 + R]$$"
