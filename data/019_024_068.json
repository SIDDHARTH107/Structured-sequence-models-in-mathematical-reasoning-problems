    "message_1": "Suppose there are two boxes, one of which contains only white marbles and the other contains only black marbles. A person selects one of the boxes at random and draws a marble from it. If the marble drawn is white, what is the probability that it was drawn from the box containing only white marbles?",
    "message_2": "Let W be the event that a white marble is drawn, B1 be the event that the box with only white marbles is chosen, and B2 be the event that the box with only black marbles is chosen. We want to find the probability P(B1|W), which is the probability that the white marble was drawn from the box containing only white marbles.\n\nWe can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:\n\nP(B1|W) = P(W|B1) * P(B1) / [P(W|B1) * P(B1) + P(W|B2) * P(B2)]\n\nSince the box with only white marbles is chosen with probability 1/2 and the box with only black marbles is chosen with probability 1/2, we have:\n\nP(B1) = 1/2\nP(B2) = 1/2\n\nIf the box with only white marbles is chosen (B1), then the probability of drawing a white marble (W) is 1, so:\n\nP(W|B1) = 1\n\nIf the box with only black marbles is chosen (B2), then the probability of drawing a white marble (W) is 0, so:\n\nP(W|B2) = 0\n\nNow, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(B1|W) = (1 * 1/2) / [(1 * 1/2) + (0 * 1/2)] = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1\n\nSo the probability that the white marble was drawn from the box containing only white marbles is 1, or 100%."
