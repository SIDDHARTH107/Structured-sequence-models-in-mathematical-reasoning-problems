    "message_1": "In a regression analysis between the annual income of a person (in thousands of dollars) and the age of the person(in years), the slope of the regression line was found to be 2.5. If the annual income of a person aged 30 was $60,000, what is the intercept of the regression line?",
    "message_2": "In a regression analysis, the equation of the regression line is given by:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nwhere y is the dependent variable (annual income in thousands of dollars), x is the independent variable (age in years), m is the slope of the regression line, and b is the y-intercept.\n\nWe are given the slope (m) as 2.5, and we know that when the age (x) is 30, the annual income (y) is $60,000, which is equivalent to 60 (in thousands of dollars). We can plug these values into the equation to solve for the intercept (b):\n\n60 = 2.5 * 30 + b\n\n60 = 75 + b\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb = 60 - 75\nb = -15\n\nSo, the intercept of the regression line is -15."
