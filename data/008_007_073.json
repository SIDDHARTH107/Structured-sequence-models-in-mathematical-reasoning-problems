    "message_2": "To find the invertible matrix P, we first need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.\n\nMatrix A:\n[1 4]\n[2 3]\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues (λ):\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix.\n\ndet([1-λ 4] = 0\n   [2  3-λ])\n\n(1-λ)(3-λ) - (4)(2) = 0\nλ^2 - 4λ - 5 = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation, we get the eigenvalues λ1 = 5 and λ2 = -1.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors:\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 5:\n(A - 5I)v1 = 0\n([-4  4]v1 = 0\n [ 2 -2])\n\nWe can see that the second row is a multiple of the first row, so we only need to consider one equation:\n-4x + 4y = 0\nx = y\n\nChoose x = 1, then y = 1. So, the eigenvector v1 = [1; 1].\n\nFor λ2 = -1:\n(A + 1I)v2 = 0\n([ 2  4]v2 = 0\n [ 2  4])\n\nBoth rows are the same, so we only need to consider one equation:\n2x + 4y = 0\nx = -2y\n\nChoose y = 1, then x = -2. So, the eigenvector v2 = [-2; 1].\n\n3. Construct the matrix P and its inverse P^-1:\nNow, we can construct the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = [ 1 -2]\n      [ 1  1]\n\nTo find the inverse of P, we can use the formula for 2x2 matrices:\n\nP^-1 = (1/det(P)) * [d -b]\n                                  [-c  a]\n\nwhere a, b, c, d are the elements of P:\n\na = 1, b = -2, c = 1, d = 1\n\ndet(P) = (1)(1) - (-2)(1) = 3\n\nP^-1 = (1/3) * [ 1  2]\n                 [-1  1]\n\n4. Compute P^-1AP to obtain the diagonal matrix D:\nNow, we can compute P^-1AP:\n\nP^-1AP = (1/3) * [ 1  2] * [1 4] * [ 1 -2]\n                 [-1  1]   [2 3]    [ 1  1]\n\nP^-1AP = (1/3) * [ 1  2] * [3 0]\n                 [-1  1]   [0 5]\n\nP^-1AP = [5 0]\n              [0 -1]\n\nSo, the diagonal matrix D is:\n\nD = [ 5  0]\n      [ 0 -1]\n\nAnd the invertible matrix P is:\n\nP = [ 1 -2]\n      [ 1  1]"
