    "message_2": "To find the derivative f'(x) of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 1, we will apply the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx - d(2x)/dx + d(1)/dx\n\nFor the first term, 3x^2:\nn = 2, so f'(3x^2) = 2 * 3x^(2-1) = 6x\n\nFor the second term, -2x:\nn = 1, so f'(-2x) = 1 * -2x^(1-1) = -2\n\nFor the third term, 1:\nSince it's a constant, its derivative is 0.\n\nNow, combining the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 2\n\nNow we need to find f'(2):\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10\n\nSo, f'(2) = 10."
