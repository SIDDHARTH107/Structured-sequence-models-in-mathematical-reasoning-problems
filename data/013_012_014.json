Company A is the leader and has a production capacity of 500 units per day, while company B can produce 300 units per day. If company A chooses to produce q units of products per day, company B will make a production decision based on the production level of company A. Specifically, if company A produces q units, company B will produce q/2 units. Each unit of product is sold at the same price, $10. The production cost per unit is $5 for both companies. If both companies produce the same amount of units, they will split the market share equally. However, if one company produces more than the other, it will capture a larger market share. What should be the optimal production level for company A to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production level for company A to maximize its profit, we need to first determine the profit function for company A.\n\nThe revenue for company A is the product of the price per unit ($10) and the number of units produced (q). The cost for company A is the product of the cost per unit ($5) and the number of units produced (q). Therefore, the profit function for company A can be written as:\n\nProfit_A = Revenue_A - Cost_A = 10q - 5q = 5q\n\nSince company B produces q/2 units when company A produces q units, the profit function for company B can be written as:\n\nProfit_B = Revenue_B - Cost_B = 10(q/2) - 5(q/2) = 5(q/2)\n\nNow, we need to find the production level for company A (q) that maximizes its profit. To do this, we can take the derivative of the profit function with respect to q and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Profit_A)/dq = 5\n\nSince the derivative is a constant and does not depend on q, the profit function for company A is a linear function, and the maximum profit will be achieved when company A produces at its maximum capacity, which is 500 units per day.\n\nSo, the optimal production level for company A to maximize its profit is 500 units per day."
