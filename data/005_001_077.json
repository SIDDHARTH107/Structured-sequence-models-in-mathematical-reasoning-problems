    "message_1": "A soft drink company claims that their new energy drink increases productivity by 25%. A random sample of 50 employees who consumed the drink during work hours showed an average productivity increase of 20%. Test the claim at a 5% level of significance, assuming that the population standard deviation is 8%. Does the evidence support the company's claim?",
    "message_2": "To test the company's claim, we will perform a hypothesis test using the following steps:\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nH0: μ = 25% (The energy drink increases productivity by 25%)\nH1: μ ≠ 25% (The energy drink does not increase productivity by 25%)\n\nStep 2: Determine the level of significance.\nα = 0.05\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic.\nWe will use the z-test since the population standard deviation is known. The formula for the z-test is:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nz = (20% - 25%) / (8% / √50)\nz = (-5%) / (8% / √50)\nz = -5% / (8% / 7.071)\nz = -5% / 1.131%\nz ≈ -4.42\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value and make a decision.\nSince this is a two-tailed test, we will use the z-table to find the critical value for α/2 = 0.025. The critical value is approximately ±1.96.\n\nNow we compare the test statistic to the critical value:\n\n-4.42 < -1.96\n\nSince the test statistic is less than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nAt a 5% level of significance, there is enough evidence to reject the company's claim that their new energy drink increases productivity by 25%. The sample data shows an average productivity increase of only 20%."
