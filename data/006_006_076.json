    "message_2": "We can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, making a free throw)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 5 free throws)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, making 4 free throws)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 5 (5 free throws)\n- k = 4 (making 4 free throws)\n- p = 0.8 (80% chance of making a free throw)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * 0.8^4 * (1-0.8)^(5-4)\n\nFirst, let's find C(5, 4):\n\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4!(5-4)!)\nC(5, 4) = 120 / (24 * 1)\nC(5, 4) = 5\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 4) = 5 * 0.8^4 * 0.2^1\n\nCalculate the powers:\n\nP(X = 4) = 5 * 0.4096 * 0.2\n\nFinally, multiply the values:\n\nP(X = 4) = 5 * 0.08192\nP(X = 4) = 0.4096\n\nSo, the probability that the basketball player will make exactly 4 out of 5 free throws in their next game is 0.4096 or 40.96%."
