    "message_2": "To show that A ∩ B is a subset of each of the sets A and B, we need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and an element of B.\n\nFirst, let's find A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's check if each element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and B.\n\nFor A:\n3 ∈ A, 4 ∈ A, and 5 ∈ A. So, all elements of A ∩ B are also elements of A.\n\nFor B:\n3 ∈ B, 4 ∈ B, and 5 ∈ B. So, all elements of A ∩ B are also elements of B.\n\nSince every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and an element of B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of each of the sets A and B."
