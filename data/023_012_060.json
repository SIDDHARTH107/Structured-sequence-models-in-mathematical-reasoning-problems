Hint: use the formula for calculating the Fourier coefficients of an odd periodic function.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the given function, we need to find the Fourier coefficients for an odd periodic function. Since f(x) is an odd function, we only need to find the sine coefficients (Bn) as the cosine coefficients (An) will be zero.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series of an odd function is:\n\nf(x) = ∑[Bn * sin(nωx)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π/T, T is the period of the function, and n is an integer.\n\nTo find the Bn coefficients, we use the following formula:\n\nBn = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nωx) dx] over one period\n\nSince the function has a period of 2π, we have ω = 2π/(2π) = 1 and T = 2π. Now, we can find Bn:\n\nBn = (2/2π) * [∫(-1 * sin(nx) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(1 * sin(nx) dx) from 0 to π]\n\nLet's evaluate the integrals separately:\n\n∫(-1 * sin(nx) dx) from -π to 0 = [cos(nx)/n] from -π to 0 = (1/n) - cos(nπ)/n\n\n∫(1 * sin(nx) dx) from 0 to π = [-cos(nx)/n] from 0 to π = -cos(nπ)/n + 1/n\n\nNow, we can find Bn:\n\nBn = (1/π) * [(1/n - cos(nπ)/n) + (-cos(nπ)/n + 1/n)]\n\nBn = (1/π) * (2/n - 2cos(nπ)/n)\n\nBn = (2/πn) * (1 - cos(nπ))\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for the given function:\n\nf(x) = ∑[(2/πn) * (1 - cos(nπ)) * sin(nx)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given function f(x) with a jump discontinuity at x = 0."
