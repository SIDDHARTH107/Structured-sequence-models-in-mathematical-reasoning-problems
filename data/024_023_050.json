    "message_2": "The 3-dimensional sphere $S^3$ is defined as the set of points $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$ such that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 = 1$. The isometries of $S^3$ are transformations that preserve the distance between points on the sphere. In other words, they are the transformations that preserve the metric of $S^3$.\n\nThe Lie group of isometries of $S^3$ is the group of orthogonal transformations in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ that fix the origin and preserve the sphere. These transformations can be represented by $4 \\times 4$ orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. This group is called the special orthogonal group in four dimensions, denoted by $SO(4)$.\n\nThe Lie algebra of $SO(4)$ consists of skew-symmetric $4 \\times 4$ matrices, and its dimension is $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \\frac{4(4-1)}{2} = 6$. The Lie group $SO(4)$ is connected, but not simply connected. Its universal cover is the Spin group $Spin(4)$, which is a double cover of $SO(4)$ and is isomorphic to $SU(2) \\times SU(2)$.\n\nIn summary, the Lie group of isometries of the 3-dimensional sphere $S^3$ is $SO(4)$, and its universal cover is $Spin(4) \\cong SU(2) \\times SU(2)$."
