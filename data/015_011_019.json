    "message_1": "What is the maximum angle (in degrees) that the lower pendulum of a double pendulum swings from its original position after 5 seconds if the upper pendulum has an initial angle of 30 degrees and both pendulums have lengths of 1 meter? (Assuming no damping or external forces)",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum angle of the lower pendulum in a double pendulum system, we need to consider the equations of motion for the system. However, the equations of motion for a double pendulum are highly complex and non-linear, which makes it difficult to find an exact analytical solution. \n\nThe equations of motion for a double pendulum are given by:\n\nθ₁''(t) = (−g(2m₁+m₂)sin(θ₁)−m₂gsin(θ₁−2θ₂)−2sin(θ₁−θ₂)m₂(θ₂'²L₂+θ₁'²L₁cos(θ₁−θ₂)))/(L₁(2m₁+m₂−m₂cos(2θ₁−2θ₂)))\n\nθ₂''(t) = (2sin(θ₁−θ₂)(θ₁'²L₁(m₁+m₂)+g(m₁+m₂)cos(θ₁)+θ₂'²L₂m₂cos(θ₁−θ₂)))/(L₂(2m₁+m₂−m₂cos(2θ₁−2θ₂)))\n\nwhere θ₁ and θ₂ are the angles of the upper and lower pendulums, respectively, L₁ and L₂ are the lengths of the pendulums, m₁ and m₂ are the masses of the pendulums, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and t is time.\n\nGiven the initial conditions (upper pendulum angle of 30 degrees and both pendulums having lengths of 1 meter), we can solve these equations numerically to find the maximum angle of the lower pendulum after 5 seconds. However, this requires numerical methods and simulations, which cannot be done here.\n\nIn summary, the maximum angle of the lower pendulum in a double pendulum system cannot be determined analytically due to the complexity of the equations of motion. Numerical simulations and methods are required to find the maximum angle for the given initial conditions."
