However, I can provide a sample question for an math student which can be related to Epistemic logic.\n\nQuestion: Three mathematicians, A, B, and C, receive the same information about an equation. A and B know the information, and both of them know that the other knows the information, but C does not know if A and B have the information or not. What is the minimum number of epistemic states required to represent this situation?",
    "message_2": "To represent this situation, we need to consider the knowledge of each mathematician and the possible states of their knowledge. We can represent the knowledge of each mathematician using epistemic states.\n\n1. A knows the information, B knows the information, and C doesn't know if A and B know the information.\n2. A knows the information, B knows the information, and C knows that A and B know the information.\n\nIn the first state, A and B know the information, and they know that the other knows it as well. C, however, is uncertain about whether A and B know the information. In the second state, C becomes aware that A and B know the information.\n\nSo, the minimum number of epistemic states required to represent this situation is 2."
