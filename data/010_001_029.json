    "message_2": "Since A and B are both closed sets in the topological space X, we know that their complements, X\\A and X\\B, are open sets in X. Now, we want to analyze the set A ∪ B.\n\nTo do this, let's consider the complement of A ∪ B in X, which is (X\\(A ∪ B)). By De Morgan's law, we have:\n\nX\\(A ∪ B) = (X\\A) ∩ (X\\B)\n\nSince (X\\A) and (X\\B) are both open sets, their intersection, (X\\A) ∩ (X\\B), is also an open set in X (by the definition of a topological space).\n\nNow, since the complement of A ∪ B, which is (X\\(A ∪ B)), is an open set, it follows that the set A ∪ B is a closed set in the topological space X.\n\nIn conclusion, if A and B are both closed sets in a topological space X, then their union, A ∪ B, is also a closed set in X."
