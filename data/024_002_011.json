    "message_2": "To find the geodesic curve connecting the points (1, 0, 1) and (-1, 0, 1) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we will use the Euler-Lagrange equations. First, we need to parameterize the curve on the surface. Let the curve be given by the parametric equations:\n\nx = x(t)\ny = y(t)\nz = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2\n\nNow, we need to find the arc length of the curve. The arc length is given by the integral:\n\nL = ∫√(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 dt\n\nSince z = x^2 + y^2, we have:\n\ndz/dt = 2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the arc length as:\n\nL = ∫√((dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt))^2) dt\n\nTo minimize the arc length, we need to find the Euler-Lagrange equations for x(t) and y(t). The Euler-Lagrange equation for a function f(x, y, dx/dt, dy/dt) is:\n\nd/dt (∂f/∂(dx/dt)) - ∂f/∂x = 0\nd/dt (∂f/∂(dy/dt)) - ∂f/∂y = 0\n\nLet f = (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt))^2. Then, we have:\n\n∂f/∂(dx/dt) = 2(dx/dt) + 8x^2(dx/dt)\n∂f/∂(dy/dt) = 2(dy/dt) + 8y^2(dy/dt)\n∂f/∂x = 8x(2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt))\n∂f/∂y = 8y(2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt))\n\nNow, we can plug these into the Euler-Lagrange equations and solve for x(t) and y(t). After solving the system of differential equations, we find that the geodesic curve connecting the points (1, 0, 1) and (-1, 0, 1) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2 is given by:\n\nx(t) = cos(t)\ny(t) = sin(t)\n\nfor t in the interval [0, π]. The geodesic curve is a semicircle in the x-y plane with radius 1 centered at the origin, and it lies on the surface z = x^2 + y^2."
