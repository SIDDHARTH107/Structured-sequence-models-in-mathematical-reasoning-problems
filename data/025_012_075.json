    "message_2": "A point P on an elliptic curve has order 4 if and only if 4P = O (the point at infinity), where O is the identity element on the elliptic curve. To find such a point, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find all the points on the elliptic curve.\n2. Check if the point has order 4.\n\nFor the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 17, we can find the points by iterating through possible x values and checking if the resulting y^2 is a perfect square. We can limit our search to a finite range of x values, as the curve is symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nAfter checking several x values, we find that the point P = (0, 4) is on the elliptic curve since:\n\ny^2 = x^3 - 4x + 17\n4^2 = 0^3 - 4(0) + 17\n16 = 17\n\nNow, we need to check if this point has order 4. To do this, we can compute 2P, 3P, and 4P using the elliptic curve point addition and doubling formulas.\n\n2P = P + P = (0, -4) (using the point doubling formula)\n3P = 2P + P = (0, 4) (using the point addition formula)\n4P = 3P + P = O (using the point addition formula)\n\nSince 4P = O, the point P = (0, 4) has order 4 on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 - 4x + 17."
