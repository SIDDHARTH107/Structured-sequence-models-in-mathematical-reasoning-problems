    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(1/r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor set, after each iteration, the line segment is divided into two equal parts (N = 2) and the length of each part is 1/3 of the original length (r = 1/3).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(1/3) â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nThe number of iterations does not affect the Hausdorff dimension, as it is a property of the fractal itself. Therefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust after 10 iterations is still approximately 0.6309."
