    "message_2": "To compute the Tutte polynomial T_G(x, y) of the given undirected graph G, we can use the recursive deletion-contraction formula:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_{G-e}(x, y) + T_{G/e}(x, y) if e is not a loop or a bridge,\nT_G(x, y) = x * T_{G-e}(x, y) if e is a bridge,\nT_G(x, y) = y * T_{G-e}(x, y) if e is a loop.\n\nHere, G-e denotes the graph obtained by deleting the edge e, and G/e denotes the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n\nThe given graph G has the following edges: AB, AC, AD, BE, CD, DE. We are asked to assign the variable x to the edge AC and the variable y to the edge BD.\n\nFirst, we compute the Tutte polynomial for the subgraphs G-AC and G/AC:\n\n1. G-AC: The graph obtained by deleting the edge AC has edges AB, AD, BE, CD, DE. This graph has no loops or bridges, so we can apply the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nT_{G-AC}(x, y) = T_{G-AC-AB}(x, y) + T_{G-AC/AB}(x, y).\n\nNow, G-AC-AB has edges AD, BE, CD, DE, and G-AC/AB has vertices A, B, C, D, E and edges AD, BE, CD, DE. Both of these subgraphs have no loops or bridges, so we can apply the deletion-contraction formula again:\n\nT_{G-AC-AB}(x, y) = T_{G-AC-AB-AD}(x, y) + T_{G-AC-AB/AD}(x, y),\nT_{G-AC/AB}(x, y) = T_{G-AC/AB-AD}(x, y) + T_{G-AC/AB/AD}(x, y).\n\nAt this point, we have reached graphs with 4 vertices and 3 edges, which are trees. The Tutte polynomial of a tree with n vertices is (x-1)^(n-1). Therefore, we have:\n\nT_{G-AC-AB-AD}(x, y) = (x-1)^3,\nT_{G-AC-AB/AD}(x, y) = (x-1)^3,\nT_{G-AC/AB-AD}(x, y) = (x-1)^3,\nT_{G-AC/AB/AD}(x, y) = (x-1)^3.\n\nSubstituting these values back into the previous equations, we get:\n\nT_{G-AC-AB}(x, y) = 2(x-1)^3,\nT_{G-AC/AB}(x, y) = 2(x-1)^3.\n\nFinally, substituting these values into the equation for T_{G-AC}(x, y), we obtain:\n\nT_{G-AC}(x, y) = 4(x-1)^3.\n\n2. G/AC: The graph obtained by contracting the edge AC has vertices A, B, C, D, E (with A and C merged into a single vertex) and edges AB, AD, BE, CD, DE. This graph has no loops or bridges, so we can apply the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nT_{G/AC}(x, y) = T_{G/AC-AB}(x, y) + T_{G/AC/AB}(x, y).\n\nNow, G/AC-AB has edges AD, BE, CD, DE, and G/AC/AB has vertices A, B, C, D, E and edges AD, BE, CD, DE. Both of these subgraphs have no loops or bridges, so we can apply the deletion-contraction formula again:\n\nT_{G/AC-AB}(x, y) = T_{G/AC-AB-AD}(x, y) + T_{G/AC-AB/AD}(x, y),\nT_{G/AC/AB}(x, y) = T_{G/AC/AB-AD}(x, y) + T_{G/AC/AB/AD}(x, y).\n\nAt this point, we have reached graphs with 4 vertices and 3 edges, which are trees. The Tutte polynomial of a tree with n vertices is (x-1)^(n-1). Therefore, we have:\n\nT_{G/AC-AB-AD}(x, y) = (x-1)^3,\nT_{G/AC-AB/AD}(x, y) = (x-1)^3,\nT_{G/AC/AB-AD}(x, y) = (x-1)^3,\nT_{G/AC/AB/AD}(x, y) = (x-1)^3.\n\nSubstituting these values back into the previous equations, we get:\n\nT_{G/AC-AB}(x, y) = 2(x-1)^3,\nT_{G/AC/AB}(x, y) = 2(x-1)^3.\n\nFinally, substituting these values into the equation for T_{G/AC}(x, y), we obtain:\n\nT_{G/AC}(x, y) = 4(x-1)^3.\n\nNow, we can compute the Tutte polynomial of the original graph G:\n\nT_G(x, y) = T_{G-AC}(x, y) + T_{G/AC}(x, y) = 4(x-1)^3 + 4(x-1)^3 = 8(x-1)^3.\n\nNext, we need to substitute the variable y for the edge BD. Since the edge BD is not present in the graph, we can simply replace the variable y with 1:\n\nT_G(x, 1) = 8(x-1)^3.\n\nThus, the Tutte polynomial of the given undirected graph G in terms of x and y is:\n\nT_G(x, y) = 8(x-1)^3."
