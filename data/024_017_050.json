    "message_1": "A particle moves along a path defined by the curve $x(t) = t^2, y(t) = t^3, z(t) = t$. The initial velocity vector of the particle is $\\vec{v_0} = 2\\hat{i} - \\hat{j} + 3\\hat{k}$ at time $t = 0$. Determine the direction of the velocity vector at time $t = 2$, if the vector is transported parallel to itself along the curve.",
    "message_2": "To find the direction of the velocity vector at time $t = 2$, we first need to find the tangent vector to the curve at that point. The tangent vector can be found by taking the derivative of the position vector with respect to time.\n\nThe position vector is given by $\\vec{r}(t) = x(t)\\hat{i} + y(t)\\hat{j} + z(t)\\hat{k} = t^2\\hat{i} + t^3\\hat{j} + t\\hat{k}$.\n\nNow, we find the derivative of the position vector with respect to time:\n\n$\\frac{d\\vec{r}(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(t^2\\hat{i} + t^3\\hat{j} + t\\hat{k}) = (2t\\hat{i} + 3t^2\\hat{j} + \\hat{k})$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the tangent vector at $t = 2$:\n\n$\\frac{d\\vec{r}(2)}{dt} = (2(2)\\hat{i} + 3(2)^2\\hat{j} + \\hat{k}) = 4\\hat{i} + 12\\hat{j} + \\hat{k}$.\n\nSince the velocity vector is transported parallel to itself along the curve, the direction of the velocity vector at time $t = 2$ is the same as the direction of the tangent vector at that point. Therefore, the direction of the velocity vector at time $t = 2$ is given by:\n\n$\\vec{v}(2) = 4\\hat{i} + 12\\hat{j} + \\hat{k}$."
