    "message_2": "To determine whether the statement R is valid or not, we will use the given assumptions and the rules of Intuitionistic logic to derive R or find a counterexample.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. P → Q\n2. P\n3. ¬Q ∨ R\n\nProof:\nFrom assumptions 1 and 2, we can use the Modus Ponens rule to derive Q:\n4. Q (from 1, 2)\n\nNow, we have Q, and we know from assumption 3 that either ¬Q or R must be true. Since we have derived Q, ¬Q cannot be true. Therefore, R must be true.\n\nSo, the statement R is valid in Intuitionistic logic, given the assumptions provided."
