    "message_1": "A student is trying to decide whether to study for a math exam or go out with friends tonight. If the student studies, they have a 75% chance of passing the exam and a 25% chance of failing. If they go out with friends, they have a 50% chance of passing the exam and a 50% chance of failing. If passing the exam is worth 100 points and failing is worth 0 points, what is the expected value of studying versus going out with friends?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the value of that outcome and then add them together.\n\nExpected value for studying:\n(0.75 * 100) + (0.25 * 0) = 75 + 0 = 75 points\n\nExpected value for going out with friends:\n(0.50 * 100) + (0.50 * 0) = 50 + 0 = 50 points\n\nThe expected value of studying is 75 points, while the expected value of going out with friends is 50 points. Therefore, the student should choose to study for the math exam, as it has a higher expected value."
