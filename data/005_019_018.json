    "message_2": "To find the probability that a user will visit page C before returning to page A, we can use the concept of first-step analysis. Let P(A) be the probability that the user visits page C before returning to page A, starting from page A. Similarly, let P(B) be the probability that the user visits page C before returning to page A, starting from page B.\n\nWe can write the following equations based on the transition probabilities:\n\nP(A) = 0.7 * P(B) + 0.2\nP(B) = 0.4 * P(A) + 0.5\n\nNow, we can solve this system of linear equations to find P(A).\n\nFirst, we can express P(B) in terms of P(A) from the second equation:\n\nP(B) = (0.4 * P(A) + 0.5)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for P(B) into the first equation:\n\nP(A) = 0.7 * (0.4 * P(A) + 0.5) + 0.2\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nP(A) = 0.28 * P(A) + 0.35 + 0.2\n\nSubtract 0.28 * P(A) from both sides:\n\n0.72 * P(A) = 0.55\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.72:\n\nP(A) = 0.55 / 0.72 â‰ˆ 0.7639\n\nSo, the probability that a user will visit page C before returning to page A, starting from page A, is approximately 0.7639 or 76.39%."
