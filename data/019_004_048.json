    "message_2": "To find the time when the 20th train will arrive, we need to calculate the total time elapsed after the first train arrived.\n\nSince the trains arrive every 10 minutes, the time elapsed for 19 trains (excluding the first train) is:\n\n19 trains * 10 minutes/train = 190 minutes\n\nNow, we need to add this time to the arrival time of the first train (2:15 PM).\n\nFirst, let's convert 190 minutes to hours and minutes:\n\n190 minutes = 3 hours and 10 minutes\n\nNow, add this to the first train's arrival time:\n\n2:15 PM + 3 hours = 5:15 PM\n5:15 PM + 10 minutes = 5:25 PM\n\nSo, the 20th train will arrive at the station at 5:25 PM."
