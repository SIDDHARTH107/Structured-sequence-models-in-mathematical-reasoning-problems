    "message_2": "To find the vertex and axis of symmetry of the absolute value equation y = |x - 3| - 2, we first need to rewrite the equation in the vertex form, which is y = a|x - h| + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the graph.\n\nIn this case, the equation is already in vertex form: y = 1|x - 3| - 2. So, the vertex (h, k) is (3, -2).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, and its equation is x = h. In this case, the axis of symmetry is x = 3."
