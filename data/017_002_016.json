    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we first need to find the divisors of the order of G, which is 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. For each divisor, there exists a subgroup of that order. Let's find the subgroups and their generators.\n\n1. Subgroup of order 1:\nThis is the trivial subgroup, containing only the identity element e. It is generated by e.\n\n2. Subgroup of order 2:\nWe need to find an element of order 2 in G. Since G is cyclic, we know that a^k has order 12/k for each divisor k of 12. So, a^6 has order 2. The subgroup of order 2 is {e, a^6}, and it is generated by a^6.\n\n3. Subgroup of order 3:\nWe need to find an element of order 3. Using the same logic as before, a^4 has order 3. The subgroup of order 3 is {e, a^4, a^8}, and it is generated by a^4.\n\n4. Subgroup of order 4:\nWe need to find an element of order 4. Using the same logic as before, a^3 has order 4. The subgroup of order 4 is {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}, and it is generated by a^3.\n\n5. Subgroup of order 6:\nWe need to find an element of order 6. Using the same logic as before, a^2 has order 6. The subgroup of order 6 is {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}, and it is generated by a^2.\n\n6. Subgroup of order 12:\nThis is the entire group G, which is generated by a.\n\nIn summary, the subgroups of G and their generators are:\n- {e} generated by e\n- {e, a^6} generated by a^6\n- {e, a^4, a^8} generated by a^4\n- {e, a^3, a^6, a^9} generated by a^3\n- {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10} generated by a^2\n- G generated by a"
