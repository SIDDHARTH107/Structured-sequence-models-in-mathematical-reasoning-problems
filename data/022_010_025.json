    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the given function about the point $z_0 = 1$, we first rewrite the function in terms of $w = z - 1$. Then, we can use partial fraction decomposition and expand the exponential function as a power series.\n\nLet $w = z - 1$, so $z = w + 1$. Then, the function becomes:\n\n$$f(w) = \\frac{e^{2(w+1)}}{w(w+1)} = \\frac{e^{2w}e^2}{w(w+1)}$$\n\nNow, we perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{w(w+1)} = \\frac{A}{w} + \\frac{B}{w+1}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $w(w+1)$, we get:\n\n$$1 = A(w+1) + Bw$$\n\nSolving for $A$ and $B$, we set $w = 0$ and $w = -1$:\n\n$$w = 0: \\quad 1 = A \\Rightarrow A = 1$$\n$$w = -1: \\quad 1 = -B \\Rightarrow B = -1$$\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\n$$f(w) = e^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{w} - \\frac{1}{w+1}\\right)e^{2w}$$\n\nNow, we expand the exponential function as a power series:\n\n$$e^{2w} = 1 + 2w + 2^2\\frac{w^2}{2!} + 2^3\\frac{w^3}{3!} + \\cdots = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 2^n\\frac{w^n}{n!}$$\n\nWe can now multiply the power series by the partial fractions:\n\n$$f(w) = e^2 \\left[\\frac{1}{w}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 2^n\\frac{w^n}{n!} - \\frac{1}{w+1}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 2^n\\frac{w^n}{n!}\\right]$$\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion by distributing the sums:\n\n$$f(w) = e^2 \\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 2^n\\frac{w^{n-1}}{n!} - \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 2^n\\frac{w^{n-1}}{(n+1)!}\\right]$$\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion of the function about the point $z_0 = 1$. The radius of convergence for each part of the series is determined by the exponential function, which converges for all $w$. Therefore, the radius of convergence for each part of the series is infinite."
