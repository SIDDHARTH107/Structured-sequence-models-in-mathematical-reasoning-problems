    "message_2": "Let's use the following symbols to represent the statements:\n\nP: John is studying for his math exam.\nQ: John will pass the exam.\n\nThe given relevance logic statement can be represented as:\n\nIf P, then Q (P → Q)\n\nWe are also given that John did not pass the exam, which means ¬Q is true.\n\nNow, we want to determine whether or not John was studying for his math exam (P).\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we know that:\n\n(P → Q) is equivalent to (¬Q → ¬P)\n\nSince ¬Q is true, we can conclude that ¬P is also true, which means John was not studying for his math exam."
