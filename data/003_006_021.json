    "message_2": "To find the measure of each angle in the triangle using the Law of Cosines, we first need to find the cosine of each angle using the formula:\n\ncos(A) = (b² + c² - a²) / (2bc)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and A is the angle opposite side a. We can then find the other two angles using similar formulas:\n\ncos(B) = (a² + c² - b²) / (2ac)\ncos(C) = (a² + b² - c²) / (2ab)\n\nLet's plug in the given side lengths (a = 6, b = 8, and c = 10) into the formulas:\n\ncos(A) = (8² + 10² - 6²) / (2 * 8 * 10) = (64 + 100 - 36) / 160 = 128 / 160 = 0.8\ncos(B) = (6² + 10² - 8²) / (2 * 6 * 10) = (36 + 100 - 64) / 120 = 72 / 120 = 0.6\ncos(C) = (6² + 8² - 10²) / (2 * 6 * 8) = (36 + 64 - 100) / 96 = 0 / 96 = 0\n\nNow we can find the angles by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of each value:\n\nA = arccos(0.8) ≈ 36.87°\nB = arccos(0.6) ≈ 53.13°\nC = arccos(0) = 90°\n\nSo, the measures of the angles in the triangle are approximately 36.87°, 53.13°, and 90°."
