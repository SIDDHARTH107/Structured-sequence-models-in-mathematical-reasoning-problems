    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (3x² - 7x + 2) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2, we can first try to simplify the function by factoring the numerator.\n\nThe numerator is a quadratic expression, so we can try to factor it:\n\n3x² - 7x + 2 = (3x - 1)(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(x) = (3x - 1)(x - 2) / (x - 2)\n\nWe can now cancel out the (x - 2) terms:\n\nf(x) = 3x - 1\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 2:\n\nlim (x -> 2) (3x - 1) = 3(2) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (3x² - 7x + 2) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2 is 5."
