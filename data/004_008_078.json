    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = x^2 + 3x at the point (2, 10), we need to find the derivative of the function y with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 + 3x.\n\nTo find the derivative, we use the power rule: d/dx(x^n) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = d/dx(x^2) + d/dx(3x) = 2x + 3.\n\nNow, we evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\ndy/dx(2) = 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = x^2 + 3x at the point (2, 10) is 7."
