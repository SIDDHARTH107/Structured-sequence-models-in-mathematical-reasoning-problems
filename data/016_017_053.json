    "message_2": "A Heighway Dragon Curve is a fractal curve that can be constructed by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The order of a Heighway Dragon Curve refers to the number of times the folding process is repeated.\n\nThe perimeter of a Heighway Dragon Curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial segment length × (2^n)\n\nwhere n is the order of the curve.\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length is 1 unit, and the order is 7. So, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:\n\nPerimeter = 1 × (2^7) = 1 × 128 = 128 units\n\nThe perimeter of a Heighway Dragon Curve of order 7 with an initial segment length of 1 unit is 128 units."
