The cost of production involves electricity consumption and raw material cost. The company has 3 machines which can produce the same product but with varying electricity consumption and raw material costs. Using simulated annealing method, find the optimal allocation of the available production time amongst the 3 machines that will minimize the total cost of production. The production time is fixed and each machine can work for 8 hours. The following table shows the costs involved:\n\n| Machine  | Electricity Consumption (kW) | Raw Material Cost (per hour) |\n| -------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| A        | 10.6                         | 6                            |\n| B        | 9.2                          | 8                            |\n| C        | 11.8                         | 5                            | \n\nAssume the hourly cost of electricity is $2.5.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we first need to define the objective function, which is the total cost of production. The total cost of production can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal Cost = (Electricity Consumption * Electricity Cost) + (Raw Material Cost * Production Time)\n\nWe have 8 hours of production time, and we need to allocate this time amongst the 3 machines. Let x_A, x_B, and x_C represent the production time for machines A, B, and C, respectively. We have the following constraint:\n\nx_A + x_B + x_C = 8\n\nNow, we can define the objective function as:\n\nTotal Cost = (10.6 * 2.5 * x_A + 6 * x_A) + (9.2 * 2.5 * x_B + 8 * x_B) + (11.8 * 2.5 * x_C + 5 * x_C)\n\nNext, we will use the simulated annealing method to find the optimal allocation of production time that minimizes the total cost of production. The simulated annealing algorithm involves generating random solutions, evaluating their objective function values, and accepting or rejecting them based on a probability function that depends on the difference between the objective function values and a temperature parameter.\n\n1. Initialize the temperature T and set the initial solution x = (x_A, x_B, x_C) randomly, ensuring that x_A + x_B + x_C = 8.\n2. Generate a new solution x' by perturbing the current solution x.\n3. Calculate the change in the objective function value Δ = Total Cost(x') - Total Cost(x).\n4. If Δ < 0, accept the new solution x' and set x = x'.\n5. If Δ ≥ 0, accept the new solution x' with probability exp(-Δ/T) and set x = x'.\n6. Decrease the temperature T according to a cooling schedule.\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the temperature T is below a predefined threshold or a maximum number of iterations have been reached.\n\nAfter running the simulated annealing algorithm, we will obtain the optimal allocation of production time (x_A, x_B, x_C) that minimizes the total cost of production."
