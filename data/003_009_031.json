    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) and then add the lengths of all three sides together.\n\nLet's call the base a, the height b, and the hypotenuse c. We are given that a = 8 cm and b = 10 cm.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n8^2 + 10^2 = c^2\n64 + 100 = c^2\n164 = c^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nc = √164\nc ≈ 12.81 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of all three sides, we can find the perimeter by adding them together:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 8 + 10 + 12.81\nPerimeter ≈ 30.81 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is approximately 30.81 cm."
