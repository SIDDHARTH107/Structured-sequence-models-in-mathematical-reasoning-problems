    "message_2": "To find all the points on the elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 6 over the field Z11, we will plug in all the possible x values from 0 to 10 (since we are working in Z11) and check if there is a corresponding y value that satisfies the equation.\n\nFor each x value, we will compute the right-hand side of the equation (x^3 + 2x + 6) modulo 11 and check if there is a y value such that y^2 is congruent to the computed value modulo 11. If there is, we will add the point (x, y) to our list of points on the elliptic curve.\n\nLet's start with x = 0:\nRHS = (0^3 + 2*0 + 6) % 11 = 6\ny^2 % 11 = 6 has two solutions: y = 3 and y = 8 (since 3^2 % 11 = 9 and 8^2 % 11 = 64 % 11 = 9)\nSo, we have two points: (0, 3) and (0, 8)\n\nNow, let's continue with the other x values:\n\nx = 1:\nRHS = (1^3 + 2*1 + 6) % 11 = 9\ny^2 % 11 = 9 has two solutions: y = 5 and y = 6 (since 5^2 % 11 = 25 % 11 = 9 and 6^2 % 11 = 36 % 11 = 9)\nPoints: (1, 5) and (1, 6)\n\nx = 2:\nRHS = (2^3 + 2*2 + 6) % 11 = 4\ny^2 % 11 = 4 has no solutions in Z11.\n\nx = 3:\nRHS = (3^3 + 2*3 + 6) % 11 = 7\ny^2 % 11 = 7 has no solutions in Z11.\n\nx = 4:\nRHS = (4^3 + 2*4 + 6) % 11 = 5\ny^2 % 11 = 5 has no solutions in Z11.\n\nx = 5:\nRHS = (5^3 + 2*5 + 6) % 11 = 10\ny^2 % 11 = 10 has no solutions in Z11.\n\nx = 6:\nRHS = (6^3 + 2*6 + 6) % 11 = 10\ny^2 % 11 = 10 has no solutions in Z11.\n\nx = 7:\nRHS = (7^3 + 2*7 + 6) % 11 = 5\ny^2 % 11 = 5 has no solutions in Z11.\n\nx = 8:\nRHS = (8^3 + 2*8 + 6) % 11 = 7\ny^2 % 11 = 7 has no solutions in Z11.\n\nx = 9:\nRHS = (9^3 + 2*9 + 6) % 11 = 4\ny^2 % 11 = 4 has no solutions in Z11.\n\nx = 10:\nRHS = (10^3 + 2*10 + 6) % 11 = 9\ny^2 % 11 = 9 has two solutions: y = 5 and y = 6 (since 5^2 % 11 = 25 % 11 = 9 and 6^2 % 11 = 36 % 11 = 9)\nPoints: (10, 5) and (10, 6)\n\nSo, the points on the elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 6 over the field Z11 are:\n(0, 3), (0, 8), (1, 5), (1, 6), (10, 5), and (10, 6)."
