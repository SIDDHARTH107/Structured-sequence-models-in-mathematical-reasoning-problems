    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, I will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, multiply the second equation by 3 and the third equation by -1:\n\n(3)(x + 5y + z) = (3)(6)\n(-1)(3x + 2y - z) = (-1)(0)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n3x + 15y + 3z = 18\n-3x - 2y + z = 0\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n(3x + 15y + 3z) + (-3x - 2y + z) = 18 + 0\n13y + 4z = 18  (1)\n\nNext, let's eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, multiply the first equation by 3 and the third equation by -2:\n\n(3)(2x + 3y + 4z) = (3)(10)\n(-2)(3x + 2y - z) = (-2)(0)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n6x + 9y + 12z = 30\n-6x - 4y + 2z = 0\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n(6x + 9y + 12z) + (-6x - 4y + 2z) = 30 + 0\n5y + 14z = 30  (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n13y + 4z = 18  (1)\n5y + 14z = 30  (2)\n\nTo eliminate y, multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by -13:\n\n(5)(13y + 4z) = (5)(18)\n(-13)(5y + 14z) = (-13)(30)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n65y + 20z = 90\n-65y - 182z = -390\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n(65y + 20z) + (-65y - 182z) = 90 + (-390)\n-162z = -300\n\nNow, divide by -162:\n\nz = -300 / -162\nz = 300 / 162\nz = 1.85185 (approximately)\n\nNow that we have z, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find y. Let's use equation (1):\n\n13y + 4(1.85185) = 18\n\n13y + 7.4074 = 18\n\n13y = 18 - 7.4074\n13y = 10.5926\n\ny = 10.5926 / 13\ny = 0.814815 (approximately)\n\nNow that we have y and z, we can substitute them back into any of the original equations to find x. Let's use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3(0.814815) + 4(1.85185) = 10\n\n2x + 2.444445 + 7.4074 = 10\n\n2x = 10 - 2.444445 - 7.4074\n2x = 0.148155\n\nx = 0.148155 / 2\nx = 0.0740775 (approximately)\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx ≈ 0.0741\ny ≈ 0.8148\nz ≈ 1.8519"
