    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using RSA encryption, we need to calculate the ciphertext (C) using the formula:\n\nC = M^e mod n\n\nwhere M is the message (23), e is the public key exponent (13), and n is the product of the prime numbers (77).\n\nC = 23^13 mod 77\n\nFirst, calculate 23^13:\n\n23^13 = 94,143,178,827,456,815,343\n\nNow, find the remainder when dividing this number by 77:\n\n94,143,178,827,456,815,343 mod 77 = 10\n\nSo, the ciphertext (C) is 10."
