They collect the following data for a week: \n\n| Temperature (°C) | Sales (units) |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| 20               | 50            |\n| 24               | 60            |\n| 18               | 46            |\n| 22               | 54            |\n| 25               | 62            |\n| 21               | 48            |\n| 23               | 56            |\n\nUsing data mining techniques, what is the best linear regression equation that can predict the sales (y) based on the temperature (x)?",
    "message_2": "To find the best linear regression equation, we need to calculate the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b) of the line. The equation will be in the form y = mx + b.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean of the temperatures (x) and the mean of the sales (y):\n\nMean of temperatures (x̄) = (20 + 24 + 18 + 22 + 25 + 21 + 23) / 7 = 153 / 7 = 21.857\nMean of sales (ȳ) = (50 + 60 + 46 + 54 + 62 + 48 + 56) / 7 = 376 / 7 = 53.714\n\nNext, we need to find the slope (m):\n\nm = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and denominator separately:\n\nNumerator = (20-21.857)(50-53.714) + (24-21.857)(60-53.714) + (18-21.857)(46-53.714) + (22-21.857)(54-53.714) + (25-21.857)(62-53.714) + (21-21.857)(48-53.714) + (23-21.857)(56-53.714)\nNumerator ≈ 47.143\n\nDenominator = (20-21.857)^2 + (24-21.857)^2 + (18-21.857)^2 + (22-21.857)^2 + (25-21.857)^2 + (21-21.857)^2 + (23-21.857)^2\nDenominator ≈ 42.857\n\nNow, we can find the slope (m):\n\nm = 47.143 / 42.857 ≈ 1.1\n\nFinally, we need to find the y-intercept (b):\n\nb = ȳ - m * x̄\nb = 53.714 - 1.1 * 21.857 ≈ 53.714 - 24.043 ≈ 29.671\n\nNow we have the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b), so we can write the linear regression equation:\n\ny = 1.1x + 29.671\n\nThis is the best linear regression equation to predict sales (y) based on the temperature (x)."
