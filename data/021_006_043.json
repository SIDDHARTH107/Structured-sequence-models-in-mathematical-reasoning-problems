Using a finite element method with a mesh size of 0.5, compute numerically the solution u(x,y,t) at time T=1 with the source term f(x,y) = sin(πx)sin(πy).",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Discretize the domain Ω\n2. Define the weak form of the PDE\n3. Choose a suitable basis function\n4. Assemble the global stiffness matrix and load vector\n5. Apply boundary conditions\n6. Solve the linear system of equations\n7. Compute the solution at time T=1\n\n1. Discretize the domain Ω:\nSince Ω is a square domain with dimensions 5x5 and a mesh size of 0.5, we will have a 10x10 grid of nodes.\n\n2. Define the weak form of the PDE:\nMultiply the PDE by a test function v(x,y,t) and integrate over the domain Ω. Then, integrate the second-order term by parts to obtain:\n\n∫Ω v ∂u/∂t dΩ = ∫Ω D∇v•∇u dΩ - ∫Ω vf dΩ + ∫∂Ω vD∇u•n dS\n\n3. Choose a suitable basis function:\nWe will use linear basis functions (e.g., hat functions) for the FEM.\n\n4. Assemble the global stiffness matrix and load vector:\nLet u(x,y,t) = ∑ U_i(t)ϕ_i(x,y), where U_i(t) are the coefficients to be determined and ϕ_i(x,y) are the basis functions. Substitute this into the weak form and assemble the global stiffness matrix K and load vector F:\n\nK_ij = ∫Ω D∇ϕ_i•∇ϕ_j dΩ\nF_i = ∫Ω ϕ_i f dΩ\n\n5. Apply boundary conditions:\nSince u(x,y,t) = 0 on the boundary ∂Ω, we can eliminate the boundary integral in the weak form. Also, we need to modify the stiffness matrix and load vector to account for the boundary conditions.\n\n6. Solve the linear system of equations:\nThe PDE has been transformed into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in time:\n\nM dU/dt = KU + F\n\nwhere M is the mass matrix with M_ij = ∫Ω ϕ_iϕ_j dΩ. We can use a time-stepping method (e.g., backward Euler) to solve this system of ODEs.\n\n7. Compute the solution at time T=1:\nStarting from the initial condition U(x,y,0) = 0, we can advance the solution in time using the chosen time-stepping method until we reach T=1.\n\nNote that the actual implementation of the FEM requires coding and numerical integration to compute the stiffness matrix, mass matrix, and load vector. The above steps provide a general outline of the process to solve the given PDE using the FEM."
