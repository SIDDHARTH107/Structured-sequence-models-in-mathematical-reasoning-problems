    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the sparse matrix method, we first need to represent the system as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2  4 |\n    | 2  4  6 |\n    | 5  8  7 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 18 |\n    | 24 |\n    | 48 |\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to obtain an upper triangular matrix. We can do this by applying the following row operations:\n\n1. R3 = R3 - (5/3)R1\n2. R2 = R2 - (2/3)R1\n3. R3 = R3 - (2)R2\n\nAfter applying these row operations, we get the following upper triangular matrix:\n\nA' = |  3   2   4  |\n     |  0   2   2  |\n     |  0   0  -1  |\n\nb' = | 18 |\n     |  8 |\n     | -4 |\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. z = -(-4) = 4\n2. 2y + 2z = 8 => y = (8 - 2*4) / 2 = 0\n3. 3x + 2y + 4z = 18 => x = (18 - 2*0 - 4*4) / 3 = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1\ny = 0\nz = 4"
