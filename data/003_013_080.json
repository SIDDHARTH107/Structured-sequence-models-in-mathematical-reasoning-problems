    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 4sin(x) + 3cos(x) over the interval [0, π/2], we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin(A + B) = sin(A)cos(B) + cos(A)sin(B)\n\nLet A = x and B = α, then we have:\n\nf(x) = 4sin(x) + 3cos(x) = Rsin(x + α)\n\nwhere R = √((4^2) + (3^2)) = 5 (by the Pythagorean theorem)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of α such that:\n\n4 = Rcos(α) and 3 = Rsin(α)\n\nDividing the second equation by the first equation, we get:\n\ntan(α) = 3/4\n\nα = arctan(3/4)\n\nNow, we have:\n\nf(x) = 5sin(x + arctan(3/4))\n\nSince the maximum value of sin(x) is 1, the maximum value of f(x) occurs when sin(x + arctan(3/4)) = 1. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) over the interval [0, π/2] is:\n\nf_max = 5 * 1 = 5"
