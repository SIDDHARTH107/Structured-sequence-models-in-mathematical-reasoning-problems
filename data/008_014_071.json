    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the vector of variables, and b is the vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 2 -1  3 |\n    | 3  1  1 |\n\nb = | 5 |\n    | 0 |\n    | 7 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a process where A is decomposed into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R, such that A = QR.\n\nUsing a QR decomposition algorithm (such as the Gram-Schmidt process or Householder reflections), we find:\n\nQ = | -0.2673  0.8729  0.4082 |\n    | -0.5345 -0.2182  0.8165 |\n    | -0.8018  0.4364 -0.4082 |\n\nR = | -3.7417 -0.5345 -1.0689 |\n    |  0      2.3094  0.8729 |\n    |  0      0      1.6329 |\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Q^Tb, where Q^T is the transpose of Q.\n\nQ^Tb = | -0.2673  -0.5345  -0.8018 | | 5 |\n       |  0.8729  -0.2182   0.4364 | | 0 |\n       |  0.4082   0.8165  -0.4082 | | 7 |\n\nQ^Tb = | -5.3385 |\n       |  3.0496 |\n       |  4.0825 |\n\nNow, we can solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^Tb using back-substitution:\n\nR = | -3.7417 -0.5345 -1.0689 | | x |   | -5.3385 |\n    |  0      2.3094  0.8729 | | y | = |  3.0496 |\n    |  0      0      1.6329 | | z |   |  4.0825 |\n\nSolving for x, y, and z:\n\nz = 4.0825 / 1.6329 ≈ 2.5\ny = (3.0496 - 0.8729 * 2.5) / 2.3094 ≈ 0.5\nx = (-5.3385 + 0.5345 * 0.5 + 1.0689 * 2.5) / -3.7417 ≈ 1.5\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx ≈ 1.5\ny ≈ 0.5\nz ≈ 2.5"
