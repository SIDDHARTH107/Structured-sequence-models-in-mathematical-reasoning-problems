    "message_1": "A company sells two products, A and B. The cost of producing A is $3 per unit and the cost of producing B is $5 per unit. The selling price of A is $10 per unit and for B it's $15 per unit. The company has a maximum budget of $1200 for manufacturing these products. Determine the number of units of A and B that the company should produce in order to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe cost of producing x units of A and y units of B is given by the equation:\n3x + 5y ≤ 1200 (since the company has a maximum budget of $1200)\n\nThe profit from selling x units of A and y units of B is given by the equation:\nP = 10x + 15y (since the selling price of A is $10 per unit and B is $15 per unit)\n\nWe need to maximize the profit P subject to the constraint 3x + 5y ≤ 1200.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region for the constraint 3x + 5y ≤ 1200.\n\n1. If x = 0, then y ≤ 240 (since 5y ≤ 1200)\n2. If y = 0, then x ≤ 400 (since 3x ≤ 1200)\n\nNow, let's find the corner points of the feasible region:\n1. (0, 0)\n2. (0, 240)\n3. (400, 0)\n4. The intersection point of the lines 3x + 5y = 1200 and x = 400 is (120, 240), but this point is not in the feasible region since it exceeds the budget constraint.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P = 10x + 15y at each of the corner points:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 240) = 10(0) + 15(240) = 3600\n3. P(400, 0) = 10(400) + 15(0) = 4000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (400, 0), with a profit of $4000. Therefore, the company should produce 400 units of product A and 0 units of product B to maximize their profit."
