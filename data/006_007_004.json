    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the normal distribution and the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed.\n\nLet's assume there are 20 trading days in a month. We are given that the daily price changes follow a normal distribution with a mean of 2% and a standard deviation of 3%. \n\nFirst, we need to find the mean and standard deviation of the sum of the daily price changes over 20 trading days.\n\nMean of the sum = Mean of daily price change * Number of trading days\nMean of the sum = 2% * 20 = 40%\n\nStandard deviation of the sum = Standard deviation of daily price change * sqrt(Number of trading days)\nStandard deviation of the sum = 3% * sqrt(20) ≈ 13.42%\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the stock price will increase by at least 10% in the next month. In other words, we want to find the probability that the sum of the daily price changes is greater than or equal to 10%.\n\nTo do this, we will standardize the value and use the Z-score formula:\n\nZ = (X - Mean) / Standard deviation\n\nWhere X is the value we want to find the probability for (10% in this case), Mean is the mean of the sum (40%), and Standard deviation is the standard deviation of the sum (13.42%).\n\nZ = (10 - 40) / 13.42 ≈ -2.24\n\nNow, we will use the Z-score to find the probability. Since we want to find the probability that the stock price will increase by at least 10%, we need to find the area to the right of the Z-score (-2.24) in the standard normal distribution table.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the area to the left of the Z-score (-2.24) is approximately 0.0125. Since we want the area to the right, we subtract this value from 1:\n\nProbability = 1 - 0.0125 = 0.9875\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will increase by at least 10% in the next month is approximately 98.75%."
