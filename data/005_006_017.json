What is the probability that the sample mean weight is less than 495 grams? (Assuming normal distribution and applying the Central Limit Theorem.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution with a mean (µ) equal to the population mean and a standard deviation (σ) equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, the population mean (µ) is 500 grams, the population standard deviation (σ) is 20 grams, and the sample size (n) is 36.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean):\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\nσ_sample_mean = 20 / √36\nσ_sample_mean = 20 / 6\nσ_sample_mean = 3.33 grams\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean weight of 495 grams:\n\nz = (x - µ) / σ_sample_mean\nz = (495 - 500) / 3.33\nz = -5 / 3.33\nz ≈ -1.50\n\nNow, we will use the z-score to find the probability that the sample mean weight is less than 495 grams. We can look up the z-score in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator to find the corresponding probability.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability for a z-score of -1.50 is approximately 0.0668 or 6.68%.\n\nSo, there is a 6.68% chance that the sample mean weight of the coffee bags is less than 495 grams."
