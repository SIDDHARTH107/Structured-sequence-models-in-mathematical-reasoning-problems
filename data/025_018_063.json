    "message_1": "Let X be the projective plane curve defined by the equation Y^2Z - X^3 - Z^3 = 0. Let P = [0 : 1 : 0] and Q = [1 : 0 : 1] be points on X. Compute the intersection number of the vertical divisor at P with the strict transform of the line passing through P and Q on the blowup of X at P.",
    "message_2": "To compute the intersection number, we first need to find the equation of the line passing through P and Q. The line passing through P and Q can be parametrized as L(t) = [t : 1 - t : t], where t is a parameter. \n\nNow, let's blow up X at P. We introduce new coordinates (x, y, z, u, v) such that x = uY, y = vX, and z = vZ. The blowup of X at P is given by the equations:\n\n1. Y^2Z - X^3 - Z^3 = 0\n2. x = uY\n3. y = vX\n4. z = vZ\n\nSubstituting the parametrization of the line L(t) into the blowup equations, we get:\n\n1. (1 - t)^2t - t^3 - t^3 = 0\n2. x = u(1 - t)\n3. y = vt\n4. z = vt\n\nNow, we need to find the strict transform of the line L(t) on the blowup. The strict transform is given by the equations (2), (3), and (4) with t ≠ 1 (since t = 1 corresponds to the point P). Thus, the strict transform is given by:\n\n1. x = u(1 - t)\n2. y = vt\n3. z = vt\n\nNow, let's compute the intersection number of the vertical divisor at P with the strict transform of the line. The vertical divisor at P is given by the equation v = 0. To find the intersection number, we need to find the intersection points of the strict transform with the vertical divisor, i.e., we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n1. x = u(1 - t)\n2. y = vt\n3. z = vt\n4. v = 0\n\nFrom equation (4), we have v = 0. Since v = 0, from equations (2) and (3), we have y = z = 0. Thus, the intersection point is [x : 0 : 0]. Substituting this back into equation (1), we get x = u(1 - t). Since x ≠ 0 (otherwise, the point would be P), we have u(1 - t) ≠ 0. Thus, the intersection number is 1.\n\nSo, the intersection number of the vertical divisor at P with the strict transform of the line passing through P and Q on the blowup of X at P is 1."
