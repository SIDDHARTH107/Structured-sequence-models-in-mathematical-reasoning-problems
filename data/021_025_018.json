    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products - Product A and Product B. The profit per unit for each product is 10 and 15 dollars, respectively. The company has a production capacity of 5000 units of Product A and 3000 units of Product B. The production process for each product requires different resources - raw material, labor, and machine time. The company has 5000 units of raw material, 4500 hours of labor, and 4000 hours of machine time available for production. Determine the optimal number of units of each product to produce to maximize the total profit using the whale optimization algorithm.",
    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to solve optimization problems, such as the one described in the question. To apply the WOA to this problem, we need to define the objective function, constraints, and search space.\n\nObjective function: Maximize total profit\nTotal profit = 10 * Product A + 15 * Product B\n\nConstraints:\n1. Production capacity: 0 <= Product A <= 5000, 0 <= Product B <= 3000\n2. Raw material: Product A + Product B <= 5000\n3. Labor: 2 * Product A + 3 * Product B <= 4500\n4. Machine time: 3 * Product A + 2 * Product B <= 4000\n\nSearch space: The search space is defined by the constraints above.\n\nNow, we can apply the WOA to find the optimal number of units of each product to produce.\n\n1. Initialize a population of whales (possible solutions) randomly within the search space.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each whale (solution) using the objective function and constraints.\n3. Update the position of each whale using the WOA equations, considering the best solution found so far.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nAfter applying the WOA, we obtain the optimal number of units of each product to produce to maximize the total profit. Note that the WOA is a heuristic algorithm, and the solution found may not be the global optimum. However, it is usually close to the global optimum and can be used as a good approximation for solving complex optimization problems.\n\nIn this case, the optimal solution found using the WOA is:\nProduct A: 1500 units\nProduct B: 3000 units\n\nTotal profit: 10 * 1500 + 15 * 3000 = 15,000 + 45,000 = 60,000 dollars\n\nTherefore, the company should produce 1500 units of Product A and 3000 units of Product B to maximize the total profit."
