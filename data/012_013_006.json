    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of G, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. Let P(G, k) denote the chromatic polynomial of G with k colors. We can start by selecting an edge, say (1, 2), and apply the algorithm:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G/e, k)\n\nwhere G - e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge (1, 2), and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge (1, 2).\n\nThe graph G - e has the following edges: {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5)}. This graph is a 5-cycle, and its chromatic polynomial is known to be:\n\nP(G - e, k) = (k-1)^5 - (k-1)^3\n\nNow, let's find the graph G/e by contracting the edge (1, 2). This results in a new graph with 4 vertices and the following edges: {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,5)}. This graph is a complete graph with 4 vertices, denoted as K_4, and its chromatic polynomial is known to be:\n\nP(G/e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial of G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G/e, k)\nP(G, k) = [(k-1)^5 - (k-1)^3] - [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)]\n\nThis is the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G."
