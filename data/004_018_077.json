    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 - 5x^2 using the power rule, we will differentiate each term separately.\n\nThe power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\n1. For the term 3x^4, n = 4, so the derivative is 4 * 3x^(4-1) = 12x^3.\n2. For the term 2x^3, n = 3, so the derivative is 3 * 2x^(3-1) = 6x^2.\n3. For the term -5x^2, n = 2, so the derivative is 2 * -5x^(2-1) = -10x.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 + 6x^2 - 10x."
