    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The length of the Dragon curve after each iteration can be determined using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial Length) * (2^(n/2))\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 5 iterations.\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(5/2))\nLength = 1 * (2^(2.5))\nLength = 1 * (sqrt(2^5))\nLength = 1 * (sqrt(32))\nLength = 1 * (4 * sqrt(2))\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon curve after five iterations is 4 * sqrt(2) units."
