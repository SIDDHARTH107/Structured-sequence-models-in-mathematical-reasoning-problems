    "message_2": "To diagonalize the matrix A, we first need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[1 - λ, 2], [2, 4 - λ]]\ndet(A - λI) = (1 - λ)(4 - λ) - (2)(2) = λ^2 - 5λ = λ(λ - 5)\n\nSetting the determinant equal to zero, we get:\nλ(λ - 5) = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ1 = 0 and λ2 = 5.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors:\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors associated with each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 0:\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n[[1, 2], [2, 4]]v1 = 0\n\nRow reducing the augmented matrix, we get:\n[1, 2 | 0]\n[0, 0 | 0]\n\nFrom this, we have one free variable (let's say x2 = t), and we get x1 = -2t. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 0 is v1 = [-2t, t] = t[-2, 1], where t ≠ 0.\n\nFor λ2 = 5:\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n[[-4, 2], [2, -1]]v2 = 0\n\nRow reducing the augmented matrix, we get:\n[1, -0.5 | 0]\n[0, 0 | 0]\n\nFrom this, we have one free variable (let's say x2 = s), and we get x1 = 0.5s. So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = 5 is v2 = [0.5s, s] = s[1, 2], where s ≠ 0.\n\n3. Diagonalize A:\nNow that we have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can form the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P.\n\nD = diag(λ1, λ2) = [[0, 0], [0, 5]]\n\nP = [v1, v2] = [[-2, 1], [1, 2]]\n\nTo verify that A = P^-1DP, we need to find the inverse of P.\n\nP^-1 = 1/det(P) * adj(P) = 1/(-4) * [[2, -1], [-1, -2]] = [[-0.5, 0.25], [0.25, 0.5]]\n\nNow, let's compute P^-1DP:\nP^-1DP = [[-0.5, 0.25], [0.25, 0.5]] * [[0, 0], [0, 5]] * [[-2, 1], [1, 2]]\n\n= [[-0.5, 0.25], [0.25, 0.5]] * [[0, 5], [0, 10]]\n\n= [[1, 2], [2, 4]]\n\nWe can see that A = P^-1DP, as required.\n\nSo, the diagonal matrix D is [[0, 0], [0, 5]] and the invertible matrix P is [[-2, 1], [1, 2]]."
