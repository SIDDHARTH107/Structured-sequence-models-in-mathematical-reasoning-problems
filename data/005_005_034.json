    "message_1": "A manufacturer produced a batch of 500 smartphones, in which 10% were defective. If a customer picks a phone at random, what is the probability that the phone is non-defective?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a non-defective phone, we first need to determine the number of non-defective phones in the batch. Since 10% of the 500 smartphones are defective, that means 90% are non-defective.\n\nTo find the number of non-defective phones, we can multiply the total number of smartphones (500) by the percentage of non-defective phones (90%):\n\n500 * 0.9 = 450\n\nSo, there are 450 non-defective smartphones in the batch.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of a customer picking a non-defective phone by dividing the number of non-defective phones (450) by the total number of smartphones (500):\n\n450 / 500 = 0.9\n\nTherefore, the probability of a customer picking a non-defective phone is 0.9 or 90%."
