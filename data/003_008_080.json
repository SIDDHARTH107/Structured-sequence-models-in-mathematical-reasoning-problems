    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the sine formula for the area of a triangle: \n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nHowever, we don't have the angle between the base and the height. To find this angle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the base, height, and the hypotenuse (one of the sides of the original triangle).\n\nLet's call the hypotenuse c. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nc^2 = base^2 + height^2\nc^2 = 8^2 + 12^2\nc^2 = 64 + 144\nc^2 = 208\nc = √208 ≈ 14.42 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of the hypotenuse, we can find the angle between the base and the height using the inverse sine function (sin^(-1)):\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\nsin(angle) = height / c\nsin(angle) = 12 / 14.42\nsin(angle) ≈ 0.832\n\nangle = sin^(-1)(0.832) ≈ 56.44°\n\nNow that we have the angle, we can find the area of the triangle using the sine formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\nArea = (1/2) * 8 * 12 * sin(56.44°)\nArea ≈ 48 * 0.832\nArea ≈ 39.94 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 39.94 cm²."
