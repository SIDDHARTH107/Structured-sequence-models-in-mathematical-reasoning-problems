    "message_2": "To determine the velocity of the block after the 3-second force is applied, we can use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nF = m * a\n\nwhere F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration.\n\nIn this case, we have a force of 5 Newtons and a mass of 2 kilograms:\n\n5 N = 2 kg * a\n\nTo find the acceleration, we can rearrange the equation:\n\na = 5 N / 2 kg = 2.5 m/s²\n\nNow that we have the acceleration, we can use the equation of motion to find the final velocity:\n\nv = u + a*t\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity (which is 0 since the block is initially at rest), a is the acceleration, and t is the time.\n\nv = 0 + (2.5 m/s² * 3 s)\n\nv = 7.5 m/s\n\nSo, the velocity of the block after the 3-second force is applied is 7.5 m/s."
