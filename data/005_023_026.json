    "message_1": "Suppose you have a dataset of ages for a group of students in a class: 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. Use the interquartile range (IQR) method to identify any outliers in the dataset.",
    "message_2": "To identify any outliers in the dataset using the interquartile range (IQR) method, follow these steps:\n\n1. Arrange the data in ascending order: 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n\n2. Find the median (Q2): Since there are 12 data points, the median will be the average of the 6th and 7th values. (23 + 24) / 2 = 23.5\n\n3. Find the lower quartile (Q1): This is the median of the lower half of the data. In this case, the lower half is 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24. The median of this lower half is the average of the 3rd and 4th values. (21 + 22) / 2 = 21.5\n\n4. Find the upper quartile (Q3): This is the median of the upper half of the data. In this case, the upper half is 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. The median of this upper half is the average of the 3rd and 4th values. (27 + 28) / 2 = 27.5\n\n5. Calculate the interquartile range (IQR): IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 27.5 - 21.5 = 6\n\n6. Determine the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\n   - Lower bound: Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 21.5 - 1.5 * 6 = 21.5 - 9 = 12.5\n   - Upper bound: Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 27.5 + 1.5 * 6 = 27.5 + 9 = 36.5\n\n7. Identify any outliers: Any data points below the lower bound or above the upper bound are considered outliers. In this dataset, there are no values below 12.5 or above 36.5, so there are no outliers."
