    "message_1": "Consider two travelers who accidentally break their identical antique vases while traveling. The airline suggests a compensation amount to each traveler, but the travelers have to independently decide on their claim amount. The compensation offered ranges between $1-100. However, if both travelers claim the same amount, then the higher amount claimed is halved and given to each traveler. The goal of each traveler is to maximize their compensation while minimizing the difference between their claim amount and their fellow traveler's claim amount. \n\nSuppose the first traveler expects the other traveler to claim an amount of 60. What amount should the first traveler claim?",
    "message_2": "If the first traveler expects the second traveler to claim $60, the first traveler should claim an amount slightly higher than $60 to maximize their compensation while minimizing the difference between their claim amount and the second traveler's claim amount. \n\nFor example, the first traveler could claim $61. In this case, if the second traveler claims $60 as expected, the first traveler would receive $61, and the second traveler would receive $60. The difference between their claim amounts is minimized ($61 - $60 = $1), and the first traveler maximizes their compensation."
