    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces rectangular sheet metal parts. The company wants to produce a sheet metal part with a length of 50 cm and a width of 30 cm. The company wants to cut four identical squares out of the sheet metal part, one from each corner, and then fold up the remaining sheet metal to form a box.\n \nWhat is the size of each square that should be cut from each corner of the sheet metal part to maximize the volume of the box?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square cut from each corner of the sheet metal part. After cutting the squares and folding up the edges, the dimensions of the box will be:\n\nLength: 50 - 2x\nWidth: 30 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume V of the box can be expressed as:\n\nV(x) = (50 - 2x)(30 - 2x)x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the volume function with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndV/dx = (50 - 2x)(-2)x + (30 - 2x)(-2)x + (50 - 2x)(30 - 2x)\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\ndV/dx = -4x^3 + 160x^2 - 1500x\n\nSetting dV/dx = 0:\n\n0 = -4x^3 + 160x^2 - 1500x\n\nWe can factor out -4x from the equation:\n\n0 = x(-x^2 + 40x - 375)\n\nNow we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation:\n\n-x^2 + 40x - 375 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (40 ± √(40² - 4(-1)(-375))) / 2(-1)\n\nx ≈ 6.144 and x ≈ 60.856\n\nSince the width of the sheet metal part is 30 cm, the value x = 60.856 is not possible. Therefore, the size of each square that should be cut from each corner of the sheet metal part to maximize the volume of the box is approximately 6.144 cm."
