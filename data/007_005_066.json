    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 24, 36, and 48, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n24 = 2^3 * 3\n36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n48 = 2^4 * 3\n\n2. For each prime factor, take the highest power that appears in any of the factorizations:\n2^4 and 3^2\n\n3. Multiply these highest powers together:\n2^4 * 3^2 = 16 * 9 = 144\n\nSo, the LCM of 24, 36, and 48 is 144."
