    "message_2": "Let's represent the northward path as vector A and the eastward path as vector B. We can use the dot product formula to find the angle between these two paths.\n\nThe dot product formula is:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nWhere A · B is the dot product of vectors A and B, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(5^2) = 5 km (since the ship sails 5 km northwards)\n|B| = √(8^2) = 8 km (since the ship sails 8 km eastwards)\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of vectors A and B. Since the ship sails northwards and then eastwards, the angle between the two paths is 90 degrees. The dot product of two perpendicular vectors is 0, so:\n\nA · B = 0\n\nNow we can use the dot product formula to find the angle θ:\n\n0 = 5 * 8 * cos(θ)\n0 = 40 * cos(θ)\n\nSince the cosine of 90 degrees is 0:\n\ncos(θ) = 0\n\nθ = 90 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the two paths taken by the ship is 90 degrees."
