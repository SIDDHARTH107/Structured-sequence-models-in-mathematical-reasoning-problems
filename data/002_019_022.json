    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = πr(r + l)\n\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nIn this case, r = 5 cm and l = 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = π(5)(5 + 10)\nSurface Area = π(5)(15)\nSurface Area = 75π\n\nThe surface area of the cone is 75π square centimeters."
