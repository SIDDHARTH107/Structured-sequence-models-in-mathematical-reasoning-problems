    "message_1": "A stream cipher generates a key stream of numbers using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) of length 4. The initial state (seed) of the LFSR is 1101. If the output sequence obtained from the LFSR is 1110, what is the next output sequence generated by the LFSR?",
    "message_2": "To find the next output sequence generated by the LFSR, we need to know the feedback polynomial used in the LFSR. The feedback polynomial determines how the bits are combined to produce the next state of the LFSR.\n\nHowever, since the feedback polynomial is not provided, we cannot determine the next output sequence generated by the LFSR."
