    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 4x - 1, we first need to find the first derivative, and then differentiate it once more.\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 2x^2 + 4x - 1)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 4x + 4\n\nNow, we'll find the second derivative:\nf''(x) = d/dx (12x^3 - 4x + 4)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 4\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 4x - 1 is f''(x) = 36x^2 - 4."
