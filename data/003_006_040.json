    "message_1": "In triangle ABC, angle A measures 55 degrees, side AC measures 9 cm, and side BC measures 12 cm. What is the length of side AB?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Law of Cosines to solve for the length of side AB. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c and angles A, B, and C, the following equation holds:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, we have angle A = 55 degrees, side AC (a) = 9 cm, and side BC (b) = 12 cm. We want to find the length of side AB (c).\n\nc^2 = 9^2 + 12^2 - 2 * 9 * 12 * cos(55)\nc^2 = 81 + 144 - 216 * cos(55)\nc^2 ≈ 225 - 216 * 0.5736\nc^2 ≈ 225 - 123.8976\nc^2 ≈ 101.1024\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side AB (c):\n\nc ≈ √101.1024\nc ≈ 10.05 cm\n\nSo, the length of side AB is approximately 10.05 cm."
