The scores are given in the table below:\n\n| Student | Math Score | Science Score | English Score |\n|---------|-----------|---------------|---------------|\n| 1       | 78        | 82            | 85            |\n| 2       | 85        | 90            | 91            |\n| 3       | 92        | 88            | 89            |\n| ...     | ...       | ...           | ...           |\n| 50      | 86        | 80            | 82            |\n\nFind the mean, variance, and standard deviation of Math score, Science score, and English score of the students.",
    "message_2": "To find the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the scores in each subject, we first need to calculate the sum of the scores in each subject. Since we don't have the complete data, I will assume that the sum of the scores in each subject is given.\n\nLet's denote the sum of the scores in Math as M, the sum of the scores in Science as S, and the sum of the scores in English as E.\n\nMean:\nTo find the mean, we divide the sum of the scores by the number of students (50).\n\nMean_Math = M / 50\nMean_Science = S / 50\nMean_English = E / 50\n\nVariance:\nTo find the variance, we need to calculate the sum of the squared differences between each score and the mean, and then divide by the number of students (50). Let's denote the sum of the squared differences for Math as SD_M, for Science as SD_S, and for English as SD_E.\n\nVariance_Math = SD_M / 50\nVariance_Science = SD_S / 50\nVariance_English = SD_E / 50\n\nStandard Deviation:\nTo find the standard deviation, we take the square root of the variance.\n\nStdDev_Math = sqrt(Variance_Math)\nStdDev_Science = sqrt(Variance_Science)\nStdDev_English = sqrt(Variance_English)\n\nWithout the complete data, we cannot provide the exact values for the mean, variance, and standard deviation. However, the formulas above show how to calculate these values once the required data (sum of scores and sum of squared differences) is available."
