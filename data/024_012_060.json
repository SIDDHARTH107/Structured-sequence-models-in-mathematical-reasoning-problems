    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star operator, we first need to find the volume form of the Riemannian metric g. The volume form is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times the standard volume form in 2D, which is dx ∧ dy.\n\nThe metric tensor g_ij for the given metric is:\ng_ij = | 1  1 |\n          | 1  3 |\n\nThe determinant of g_ij is det(g_ij) = (1)(3) - (1)(1) = 2.\n\nNow, we can compute the square root of the determinant: sqrt(det(g_ij)) = sqrt(2).\n\nThe volume form is then given by: vol(M) = sqrt(2) dx ∧ dy.\n\nNow, we can compute the Hodge star operator for 1-forms and 2-forms on M.\n\nFor a 1-form α = α_x dx + α_y dy, the Hodge star operator is defined as:\n\n*α = (α_x / sqrt(2)) dy - (α_y / sqrt(2)) dx\n\nFor a 2-form β = β_xy dx ∧ dy, the Hodge star operator is defined as:\n\n*β = (β_xy / sqrt(2)) (dx + dy)\n\nAt the point (1,1), the Hodge star operator does not change because the metric is independent of the coordinates. Therefore, the Hodge star operator at (1,1) is the same as the general expressions above."
