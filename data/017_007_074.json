    "message_2": "We will show that G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3.\n\nFirst, note that the order of G is 6, which is the product of two distinct primes, 2 and 3. By the Sylow theorems, G has a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup. Let H be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G and K be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Then, |H| = 2 and |K| = 3.\n\nSince the order of H is 2, H is cyclic and generated by an element of order 2, say h. Similarly, since the order of K is 3, K is cyclic and generated by an element of order 3, say k.\n\nNow, consider the element hk ∈ G. Since h and k have orders 2 and 3, respectively, and these orders are coprime, we have (hk)^6 = h^6k^6 = e (where e is the identity element of G). Thus, the order of hk divides 6. If the order of hk is 6, then G is generated by hk, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nIf the order of hk is not 6, then it must be 1, 2, or 3 (since it must divide 6). If the order of hk is 1, then hk = e, which implies that h = k^(-1), and this contradicts the fact that h and k have different orders. If the order of hk is 2, then (hk)^2 = e, which implies that h^2 = k^(-2), and this also contradicts the fact that h and k have different orders. Therefore, the order of hk must be 3.\n\nIn this case, G has an element of order 2 (h) and an element of order 3 (hk). We can now define a map φ: D3 → G by φ(r) = h and φ(s) = hk, where r and s are the standard generators of D3 with r^2 = s^3 = e and rs = sr^(-1). We can check that this map is a homomorphism:\n\nφ(rs) = φ(r)φ(s) = h(hk) = hk^(-1) = h(sr^(-1)) = φ(sr^(-1)).\n\nSince φ is a homomorphism and maps the generators of D3 to elements of G, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
