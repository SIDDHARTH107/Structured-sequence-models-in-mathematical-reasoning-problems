    "message_1": "Given a modal logic formula \"□(p → q) → (□p → □q)\", where \"p\" and \"q\" are propositions, determine whether the formula is valid or invalid. Provide a formal proof for your answer.",
    "message_2": "The given modal logic formula is \"□(p → q) → (□p → □q)\", which is also known as the Kripke's Axiom T or the Distribution Axiom. This formula is valid in normal modal logics, such as the system K, which is the most basic normal modal logic system.\n\nTo prove the formula's validity, we can use the following formal proof:\n\n1. Assume □(p → q) (Assumption)\n2. Assume □p (Assumption)\n3. p → q (Necessitation Elimination on 1)\n4. p (Necessitation Elimination on 2)\n5. q (Modus Ponens on 3 and 4)\n6. □q (Necessitation Introduction on 5)\n7. □p → □q (Implication Introduction on 2 and 6)\n8. □(p → q) → (□p → □q) (Implication Introduction on 1 and 7)\n\nThus, the given modal logic formula is valid, and we have provided a formal proof for its validity."
