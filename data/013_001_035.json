    "message_1": "In a Prisoner's Dilemma game, Player A and Player B are given two options: to cooperate or to defect. If both players cooperate, they each receive 3 points. If both players defect, they each receive 1 point. However, if one player cooperates and the other defects, the defector receives 5 points while the cooperator receives 0 points. \n\nIf Player A cooperates and Player B defects, what is the highest number of points that Player A can end up with?",
    "message_2": "In this scenario, where Player A cooperates and Player B defects, Player A will end up with 0 points, as stated in the problem. There is no way for Player A to change their decision after it has been made, so the highest number of points that Player A can end up with in this specific scenario is 0 points."
