    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x² - 5x + 4 over the interval [-1, 5], we first find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 5\n\nNow, set f'(x) to zero and solve for x:\n\n2x - 5 = 0\n2x = 5\nx = 5/2 = 2.5\n\nThe critical point is x = 2.5. Now, we need to check the endpoints of the interval and the critical point to find the minimum value.\n\nf(-1) = (-1)² - 5(-1) + 4 = 1 + 5 + 4 = 10\nf(2.5) = (2.5)² - 5(2.5) + 4 = 6.25 - 12.5 + 4 = -2.25\nf(5) = (5)² - 5(5) + 4 = 25 - 25 + 4 = 4\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical point and the endpoints, we find that the minimum value is -2.25, which occurs at x = 2.5."
