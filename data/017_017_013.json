    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 30. We want to show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nStep 1: Sylow's Theorems\nBy Sylow's theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy:\n1. n_5 divides 6 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_3 divides 10 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have that n_5 = 1 or 6 and n_3 = 1 or 10.\n\nStep 2: Unique Sylow 5-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup\nIf n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5, which is normal in G. Similarly, if n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3, which is normal in G.\n\nStep 3: Semidirect product\nIf both P_5 and P_3 are normal in G, then G is the semidirect product of P_5 and P_3, and we have |G| = |P_5||P_3| = 5 * 3 = 15. Since P_5 and P_3 are cyclic (of prime order), there are two possibilities for G:\n\n1. G is abelian, in which case G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30.\n2. G is non-abelian, in which case G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15.\n\nStep 4: Non-abelian group of order 30\nNow, suppose that n_5 = 6 and n_3 = 10. In this case, there are multiple Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups, and neither is guaranteed to be normal in G. However, we can still form a non-abelian group of order 30 using a semidirect product construction.\n\nLet P_5 = ⟨a⟩ and P_3 = ⟨b⟩ be two Sylow subgroups of G. Define a group action of P_3 on P_5 by conjugation, such that b^(-1)ab = a^2. This action is well-defined since a^(5-1) = a^4 = a^2 * a^2, and (a^2)^3 = a^6 = a. We can then form the semidirect product of P_5 and P_3, denoted as G = P_5 ⋊ P_3, with the following group operation:\n\n(a^i, b^j) * (a^k, b^l) = (a^i * (b^j)^(-1)(a^k)(b^j), b^j * b^l) = (a^i * a^(2^j * k), b^(j+l))\n\nThis group G has order 30, and it is non-abelian since (a, b) * (a^2, b) ≠ (a^2, b) * (a, b).\n\nConclusion:\nWe have shown that a group G of order 30 can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or a non-abelian group of order 30, depending on the number of Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups."
