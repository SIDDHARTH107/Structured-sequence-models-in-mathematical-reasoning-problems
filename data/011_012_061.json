There are 30 students taking only math, 20 students taking only physics, and 15 students taking both classes. If there are 60 students in total, how many students are not taking either math or physics?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of students not taking either math or physics, we first need to determine the total number of students taking math, physics, or both.\n\nThere are 30 students taking only math, 20 students taking only physics, and 15 students taking both classes. So, the total number of students taking math or physics is:\n\n30 (only math) + 20 (only physics) + 15 (both) = 65 students\n\nHowever, since there are only 60 students in total, this means that some students are counted twice (those taking both classes). So, we need to subtract the number of students taking both classes (15) from the total number of students taking math or physics (65):\n\n65 - 15 = 50 students\n\nNow, we can find the number of students not taking either math or physics by subtracting the number of students taking math or physics (50) from the total number of students (60):\n\n60 - 50 = 10 students\n\nSo, there are 10 students not taking either math or physics."
