    "message_1": "A certain company has experienced 18 cyber-attacks of a specific type in the last 6 months. What is the probability that the company will experience 3 cyber-attacks of the same type in the next 30 days, given that the frequency of such attacks follows a Poisson distribution with a mean of 5 attacks per month? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of experiencing 3 cyber-attacks in the next 30 days, we will use the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nWhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of experiencing x cyber-attacks\n- λ is the average number of cyber-attacks per time period (in this case, 5 attacks per month)\n- x is the number of cyber-attacks we want to find the probability for (in this case, 3)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(3) = (e^(-5) * 5^3) / 3!\n\nP(3) = (0.0067 * 125) / 6\n\nP(3) = 0.8375 / 6\n\nP(3) = 0.1396\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, the probability of experiencing 3 cyber-attacks in the next 30 days is approximately 0.14 or 14%."
