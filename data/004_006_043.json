    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = 5x^4 - 12x^3 + 3x^2 - x + 1, we first need to find its first derivative, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(5x^4 - 12x^3 + 3x^2 - x + 1)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 20x^3 - 36x^2 + 6x - 1\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points of the function.\n\n20x^3 - 36x^2 + 6x - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, which can be difficult to solve analytically. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (1) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (20). The possible rational roots are:\n\n±1, ±1/2, ±1/4, ±1/5, ±1/10, ±1/20\n\nBy testing these possible rational roots, we find that x = 1/2 is a root:\n\n20(1/2)^3 - 36(1/2)^2 + 6(1/2) - 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n          ______________________\n    1/2 |  20    -36     6    -1\n            10    -13    3\n          ______________________\n               10    -49     9\n\nSo, the factored form of the derivative is:\n\nf'(x) = (2x - 1)(10x^2 - 49x + 9)\n\nNow we need to solve the quadratic equation 10x^2 - 49x + 9 = 0 for x. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 10, b = -49, and c = 9:\n\nx = (49 ± √((-49)^2 - 4(10)(9))) / (2(10))\nx = (49 ± √(2401 - 360)) / 20\nx = (49 ± √(2041)) / 20\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = 5x^4 - 12x^3 + 3x^2 - x + 1 are:\n\nx = 1/2, (49 + √(2041)) / 20, and (49 - √(2041)) / 20"
