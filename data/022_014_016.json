    "message_2": "A harmonic function is a twice continuously differentiable function that satisfies the Laplace equation, which means that the sum of its second partial derivatives is zero: ∆f = ∂²f/∂x² + ∂²f/∂y² = 0. \n\nSince f(z) is harmonic, it can be represented as the real part of a holomorphic function, say g(z). That is, f(z) = Re(g(z)). We can write g(z) = u(z) + iv(z), where u(z) = f(z) and v(z) is the imaginary part of g(z).\n\nNow, we know that g(z) is holomorphic in the circular region of radius 2 centered at the origin. Therefore, g(z) satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y and ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x.\n\nWe are given that f(1+i) = 3 and f(-1+i) = 4. Since f(z) = u(z), we have u(1+i) = 3 and u(-1+i) = 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the function h(z) = g(-z). Then, h(z) is also holomorphic in the circular region of radius 2 centered at the origin. Let's write h(z) = w(z) + ix(z), where w(z) is the real part of h(z) and x(z) is the imaginary part of h(z).\n\nSince h(z) = g(-z), we have w(z) = u(-z) and x(z) = -v(-z). Therefore, w(1+i) = u(-1+i) = 4 and w(-1+i) = u(1+i) = 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the function k(z) = g(z) + h(z). Then, k(z) is also holomorphic in the circular region of radius 2 centered at the origin. Let's write k(z) = a(z) + ib(z), where a(z) is the real part of k(z) and b(z) is the imaginary part of k(z).\n\nSince k(z) = g(z) + h(z), we have a(z) = u(z) + w(z) and b(z) = v(z) + x(z). Therefore, a(1+i) = u(1+i) + w(1+i) = 3 + 4 = 7 and a(-1+i) = u(-1+i) + w(-1+i) = 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nSince a(z) is a harmonic function and it takes the same value at two distinct points in the circular region of radius 2 centered at the origin, by the uniqueness property of harmonic functions, we conclude that a(z) is a constant function. Therefore, a(z) = 7 for all z in the circular region.\n\nIn particular, a(0) = 7. Since a(0) = u(0) + w(0) = f(0) + f(0), we have 2f(0) = 7, and thus f(0) = 7/2 = 3.5."
