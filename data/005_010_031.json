    "message_1": "A car manufacturer claims that at least 95% of all new cars released pass their quality check. A quality check is performed on a sample of 60 new cars, and only 55 of them pass the check. Using Bayesian statistical methods, calculate the probability that the percentage of all new cars passing the quality check is less than 90%.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Bayesian statistical methods, we need to define our prior distribution, likelihood function, and then calculate the posterior distribution. We'll use a Beta distribution as our prior and likelihood function since it is a conjugate prior for the binomial distribution.\n\n1. Prior Distribution: Since the manufacturer claims that at least 95% of all new cars pass the quality check, we can use a Beta distribution with parameters α = 19 and β = 1 as our prior. This distribution has a mean of α / (α + β) = 19 / 20 = 0.95, which represents the manufacturer's claim.\n\n2. Likelihood Function: The likelihood function is the probability of observing the data (55 out of 60 cars passing the quality check) given the true proportion of cars passing the quality check. This can be modeled using a binomial distribution with parameters n = 60 (number of trials) and p (probability of success, i.e., passing the quality check).\n\n3. Posterior Distribution: To calculate the posterior distribution, we update the parameters of our prior Beta distribution using the observed data. The updated parameters are α' = α + number of successes = 19 + 55 = 74 and β' = β + number of failures = 1 + (60 - 55) = 6. The posterior distribution is now a Beta(74, 6) distribution.\n\n4. Calculate the probability that the percentage of all new cars passing the quality check is less than 90%: We want to find the probability P(p < 0.9) using the posterior distribution. This can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Beta distribution:\n\nP(p < 0.9) = CDF_Beta(0.9; 74, 6)\n\nUsing a statistical software or calculator, we find that:\n\nP(p < 0.9) ≈ 0.019\n\nSo, there is approximately a 1.9% chance that the percentage of all new cars passing the quality check is less than 90%."
