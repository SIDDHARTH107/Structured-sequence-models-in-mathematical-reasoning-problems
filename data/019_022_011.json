If the student values screen size at $200 and the expected lifespan of the laptop is 3 years, which laptop should the student buy based on a decision-theoretic approach?",
    "message_2": "To determine which laptop the student should buy based on a decision-theoretic approach, we need to calculate the utility of each option and compare them.\n\nLet's assign a utility value for the screen size. Since the student values screen size at $200, we can say that the utility of a 13-inch screen is 13 * $200 = $2600, and the utility of a 15-inch screen is 15 * $200 = $3000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost per year for each laptop, considering the expected lifespan of 3 years:\n- 13-inch laptop: $1100 / 3 years = $366.67 per year\n- 15-inch laptop: $1400 / 3 years = $466.67 per year\n\nNext, we need to calculate the net utility per year for each laptop by subtracting the cost per year from the utility value:\n- 13-inch laptop: $2600 - $366.67 = $2233.33 per year\n- 15-inch laptop: $3000 - $466.67 = $2533.33 per year\n\nFinally, we compare the net utility per year for both laptops:\n- 13-inch laptop: $2233.33 per year\n- 15-inch laptop: $2533.33 per year\n\nBased on the decision-theoretic approach, the student should buy the 15-inch laptop, as it has a higher net utility per year ($2533.33) compared to the 13-inch laptop ($2233.33)."
