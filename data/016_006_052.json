    "message_2": "To find the scaling factor of the Barnsley fern, we need to divide the length of the largest frond by the length of the smallest frond:\n\nScaling factor = (Length of largest frond) / (Length of smallest frond)\n\nScaling factor = 6 cm / 0.5 cm\n\nScaling factor = 12\n\nSo, the scaling factor of the Barnsley fern is 12."
