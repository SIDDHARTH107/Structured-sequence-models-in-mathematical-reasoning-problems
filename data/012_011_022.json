    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph:\n\nCut vertices: {2, 5}\nExplanation: Removing vertex 2 disconnects vertices 1 and 4 from vertices 3 and 6. Similarly, removing vertex 5 disconnects vertices 1 and 4 from vertices 3 and 6.\n\nBridges: {(2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 6), (5, 6)}\nExplanation: Removing edge (2, 3) disconnects vertex 3 from the rest of the graph. Removing edge (2, 5) disconnects vertices 1 and 4 from vertices 3 and 6. Removing edge (3, 6) disconnects vertex 6 from the rest of the graph. Removing edge (5, 6) disconnects vertices 3 and 6 from vertices 1 and 4."
