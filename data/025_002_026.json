    "message_2": "To compute the intersection number of X and Y at the point [1:1:1:1], we will first find the local equations for X and Y at this point. Then, we will compute the intersection multiplicity of these local equations.\n\nLet's first find the local equations for X and Y at the point [1:1:1:1]. We can do this by finding the tangent spaces of X and Y at this point.\n\nFor X: x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0, we compute the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂X/∂x = 2x\n∂X/∂y = 2y\n∂X/∂z = -2z\n\nEvaluating these at the point [1:1:1:1], we get:\n\n∂X/∂x = 2\n∂X/∂y = 2\n∂X/∂z = -2\n\nThe tangent space of X at [1:1:1:1] is given by the equation 2x + 2y - 2z = 0.\n\nFor Y: x^2 + y^2 - 2z^2 = 0, we compute the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂Y/∂x = 2x\n∂Y/∂y = 2y\n∂Y/∂z = -4z\n\nEvaluating these at the point [1:1:1:1], we get:\n\n∂Y/∂x = 2\n∂Y/∂y = 2\n∂Y/∂z = -4\n\nThe tangent space of Y at [1:1:1:1] is given by the equation 2x + 2y - 4z = 0.\n\nNow, let's compute the intersection multiplicity of the local equations 2x + 2y - 2z = 0 and 2x + 2y - 4z = 0. We can do this by finding the dimension of the intersection of their tangent spaces.\n\nThe tangent spaces are given by the following linear equations:\n\nT_X: x + y - z = 0\nT_Y: x + y - 2z = 0\n\nSubtracting T_X from T_Y, we get:\n\nz = 0\n\nSubstituting z = 0 into T_X, we get:\n\nx + y = 0\n\nThe intersection of the tangent spaces is a one-dimensional subspace, which means that the intersection multiplicity of X and Y at the point [1:1:1:1] is 1."
