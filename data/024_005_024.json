    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures and the corresponding principal directions at the point (1, -1, -2), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nGiven the surface equation z = x^3 - 3xy^2, we can find the tangent plane at the given point. First, we compute the gradient of the surface:\n\n∇z = (∂z/∂x, ∂z/∂y) = (3x^2 - 3y^2, -6xy)\n\nNow, we evaluate the gradient at the point (1, -1, -2):\n\n∇z(1, -1) = (3(1)^2 - 3(-1)^2, -6(1)(-1)) = (0, 6)\n\nThe normal vector to the tangent plane at the point (1, -1, -2) is N = (0, 6, -1).\n\nNext, we compute the first fundamental form (E, F, G) and the second fundamental form (L, M, N) coefficients:\n\nE = <∂r/∂x, ∂r/∂x> = <(1, 0, 3x^2 - 3y^2), (1, 0, 3x^2 - 3y^2)> = 1 + (3x^2 - 3y^2)^2\nF = <∂r/∂x, ∂r/∂y> = <(1, 0, 3x^2 - 3y^2), (0, 1, -6xy)> = (3x^2 - 3y^2)(-6xy)\nG = <∂r/∂y, ∂r/∂y> = <(0, 1, -6xy), (0, 1, -6xy)> = 1 + (-6xy)^2\n\nL = <N, ∂²r/∂x²> = <(0, 6, -1), (6x, 0, 0)> = 0\nM = <N, ∂²r/∂x∂y> = <(0, 6, -1), (0, -6, -6x)> = 36\nN = <N, ∂²r/∂y²> = <(0, 6, -1), (0, 0, 6)> = 6\n\nNow, we evaluate E, F, G, L, M, and N at the point (1, -1, -2):\n\nE(1, -1) = 1 + (3(1)^2 - 3(-1)^2)^2 = 1\nF(1, -1) = (3(1)^2 - 3(-1)^2)(-6(1)(-1)) = 0\nG(1, -1) = 1 + (-6(1)(-1))^2 = 37\n\nNow, we can find the principal curvatures k1 and k2 by solving the characteristic equation:\n\ndet(H - kI) = 0\n\nwhere H is the shape operator matrix:\n\nH = | L/E  M |\n      | M   N/G |\n\nand I is the identity matrix.\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\n(k^2 - (L/E + N/G)k + (LN - M^2)/(EG)) = 0\n\nPlugging in the values for L, M, N, E, F, and G, we get:\n\n(k^2 - (0 + 6/37)k + (0 - 0)/(1 * 37)) = 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nk^2 - 6/37 k = 0\n\nThe solutions to this equation are k1 = 0 and k2 = 6/37. These are the principal curvatures.\n\nNow, we find the principal directions by solving the eigenvector problem:\n\n(H - kI)v = 0\n\nFor k1 = 0:\n\n| -M | |v1| = | 0 |\n| M  | |v2|   | 0 |\n\nThis gives us the eigenvector v1 = (1, 0), which corresponds to the principal direction for k1 = 0.\n\nFor k2 = 6/37:\n\n| -6/37  M | |v1| = | 0 |\n|  M   -6/37| |v2|   | 0 |\n\nThis gives us the eigenvector v2 = (0, 1), which corresponds to the principal direction for k2 = 6/37.\n\nIn conclusion, the principal curvatures at the point (1, -1, -2) are k1 = 0 and k2 = 6/37, and the corresponding principal directions are (1, 0) and (0, 1)."
