    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for connected planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 7 and E = 10. We need to find F to calculate the genus.\n\nSince the graph is connected, we can use the inequality for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\n10 ≤ 3(7) - 6\n10 ≤ 15\n\nThe inequality holds, so it's possible that the graph is planar. If the graph is planar, then the genus is 0. However, we still need to find F to confirm this.\n\nWe can rearrange Euler's formula to solve for F:\n\nF = 2 - 2g + E - V\n\nIf the graph is planar (g = 0), then:\n\nF = 2 - 2(0) + 10 - 7\nF = 2 + 3\nF = 5\n\nNow we can plug F back into Euler's formula to check if it's consistent:\n\n7 - 10 + 5 = 2 - 2g\n\n2 = 2 - 2g\n2g = 0\ng = 0\n\nSince the result is consistent, the graph is indeed planar, and the genus of the graph is 0."
