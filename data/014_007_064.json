    "message_1": "A stream cipher generates a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) that is combined with the plaintext message using an exclusive OR (XOR) operation to generate the ciphertext. Imagine that you have a PRBS of length 32 and the plaintext message \"11001100\". Find the ciphertext generated by the stream cipher if the initial state of the PRBS is \"10101010\".",
    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext, we need to XOR the plaintext message with the PRBS. However, the given PRBS is of length 32, and the plaintext message is of length 8. We need to truncate the PRBS to match the length of the plaintext message.\n\nTruncated PRBS: \"10101010\"\n\nNow, we perform the XOR operation between the plaintext message and the truncated PRBS:\n\nPlaintext: 11001100\nPRBS:      10101010\nXOR:       01100110\n\nSo, the ciphertext generated by the stream cipher is \"01100110\"."
