    "message_1": "A factory produces light bulbs, and the probability that a bulb is defective is 0.01. A quality control inspector selects a box containing 100 bulbs. What is the probability that the box has 2 defective bulbs? Solve the problem using Bayesian statistics.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having k defective bulbs in the box\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of bulbs in the box (100)\n- k is the number of defective bulbs (2)\n- p is the probability of a bulb being defective (0.01)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(100, 2):\n\nC(100, 2) = 100! / (2! * (100-2)!)\nC(100, 2) = 100! / (2! * 98!)\nC(100, 2) = (100 * 99) / (2 * 1)\nC(100, 2) = 4950\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * 0.01^2 * (1-0.01)^(100-2)\nP(X = 2) = 4950 * 0.01^2 * 0.99^98\nP(X = 2) â‰ˆ 0.271\n\nSo, the probability that the box has 2 defective bulbs is approximately 0.271 or 27.1%."
