    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem based on chaos theory and the Duffing oscillator:\n\nConsider the Duffing oscillator with the following parameters:\n- Mass: 1 kg\n- Stiffness: 0.5 N/m\n- Damping coefficient: 0.2 Ns/m\n- Driving amplitude: 1 N\n- Driving frequency: 1 rad/s\n\nThe system of equations representing the motion of this oscillator under these conditions is:\n\nd²x/dt² + 0.2dx/dt + 0.5x + x³ = 1cos(t)\n\nUsing numerical methods, approximate the solutions of this system from time t = 0 to t = 40, with an initial condition of x(0) = 0 and dx/dt(0) = 0. Plot the time series of the solutions and observe the chaotic behavior of this oscillator.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Runge-Kutta method, which is a widely used numerical method for solving differential equations. First, we need to convert the second-order differential equation into a system of two first-order differential equations. Let v = dx/dt, then we have:\n\ndv/dt = -0.2v - 0.5x - x³ + 1cos(t)\n\nNow we have a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = v\ndv/dt = -0.2v - 0.5x - x³ + 1cos(t)\n\nWe can now apply the Runge-Kutta method to solve this system of equations. Here's a Python code that does this using the `scipy` library:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef duffing_oscillator(t, y):\n    x, v = y\n    dxdt = v\n    dvdt = -0.2 * v - 0.5 * x - x**3 + 1 * np.cos(t)\n    return [dxdt, dvdt]\n\nt_span = (0, 40)\ny_init = [0, 0]\nt_eval = np.linspace(0, 40, 1000)\n\nsol = solve_ivp(duffing_oscillator, t_span, y_init, t_eval=t_eval)\n\nplt.plot(sol.t, sol.y[0])\nplt.xlabel('Time (t)')\nplt.ylabel('Displacement (x)')\nplt.title('Duffing Oscillator Time Series')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nRunning this code will plot the time series of the Duffing oscillator's displacement (x) over time (t) from 0 to 40. You will observe the chaotic behavior of the oscillator as the displacement varies irregularly over time."
