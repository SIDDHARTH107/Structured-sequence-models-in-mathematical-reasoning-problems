    "message_2": "To find all solutions for the equation 2sin(2x) + 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2π], we first isolate sin(2x):\n\n2sin(2x) = -1\nsin(2x) = -1/2\n\nNow we need to find all values of x in the interval [0, 2π] that satisfy this equation. Since the sine function has a period of 2π, we can consider the general solution for x:\n\n2x = arcsin(-1/2) + 2πn or 2x = π - arcsin(-1/2) + 2πn, where n is an integer.\n\nFor the first case, 2x = arcsin(-1/2) + 2πn:\n\nx = (arcsin(-1/2) + 2πn) / 2\n\nFor the second case, 2x = π - arcsin(-1/2) + 2πn:\n\nx = (π - arcsin(-1/2) + 2πn) / 2\n\nNow we need to find all values of x in the interval [0, 2π] that satisfy these equations. We can do this by plugging in different integer values for n and checking if the resulting x values are within the given interval.\n\nFor the first case:\n\nn = 0: x = (arcsin(-1/2)) / 2 ≈ -π/6 (not in the interval [0, 2π])\nn = 1: x = (arcsin(-1/2) + 2π) / 2 ≈ 7π/6 (in the interval [0, 2π])\n\nFor the second case:\n\nn = 0: x = (π - arcsin(-1/2)) / 2 ≈ 5π/6 (in the interval [0, 2π])\nn = 1: x = (π - arcsin(-1/2) + 2π) / 2 ≈ 11π/6 (not in the interval [0, 2π])\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation 2sin(2x) + 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2π] are x = 7π/6 and x = 5π/6."
