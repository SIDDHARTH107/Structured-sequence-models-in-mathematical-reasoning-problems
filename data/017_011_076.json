    "message_2": "Suppose for contradiction that there exists a group G of order 12 that is isomorphic to the direct product of two non-trivial cyclic groups, say G ≅ C_m × C_n, where m and n are positive integers greater than 1. Then, the order of G is the product of the orders of C_m and C_n, so we have:\n\n12 = |G| = |C_m × C_n| = |C_m| * |C_n| = m * n\n\nSince m and n are greater than 1, the possible factor pairs of 12 are (2, 6), (3, 4), and (4, 3). We will analyze each case and show that none of them can lead to a group G of order 12 that is isomorphic to the direct product of two non-trivial cyclic groups.\n\nCase 1: (m, n) = (2, 6)\nIn this case, G ≅ C_2 × C_6. The element of order 6 in C_6 generates the entire cyclic group C_6. The direct product of an element of order 2 in C_2 and the element of order 6 in C_6 would have order lcm(2, 6) = 6 in G. However, a group of order 12 must have an element of order 12 by Cauchy's theorem, which is a contradiction.\n\nCase 2: (m, n) = (3, 4)\nIn this case, G ≅ C_3 × C_4. The element of order 4 in C_4 generates the entire cyclic group C_4. The direct product of an element of order 3 in C_3 and the element of order 4 in C_4 would have order lcm(3, 4) = 12 in G. However, this would imply that G is a cyclic group of order 12, which contradicts the assumption that G is a direct product of two non-trivial cyclic groups.\n\nCase 3: (m, n) = (4, 3)\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, and the same argument applies. G would be a cyclic group of order 12, which contradicts the assumption that G is a direct product of two non-trivial cyclic groups.\n\nIn all cases, we have reached a contradiction. Therefore, no group of order 12 can be isomorphic to the direct product of two non-trivial cyclic groups."
