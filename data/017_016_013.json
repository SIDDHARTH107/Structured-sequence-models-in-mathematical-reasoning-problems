    "message_2": "If G has an element of order 27, then G is a cyclic group. This is because the order of an element in a group divides the order of the group. Since 27 is a prime power (3^3), having an element of order 27 means that this element generates the entire group.\n\nThe group G is then isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 27, which is denoted as Z_27 or C_27."
