    "message_1": "A researcher wants to test whether there is a significant difference in the median score between two groups of students. Group A has 10 students with scores of 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, and 130. Group B has 12 students with scores of 55, 65, 75, 85, 95, 105, 115, 125, 135, 145, 155, and 165. \n\nWhat non-parametric test should the researcher use to compare the two groups and what is the p-value of the test? Does the test suggest a significant difference between the medians of the two groups?",
    "message_2": "The researcher should use the Mann-Whitney U test (also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) to compare the two groups, as it is a non-parametric test that compares the medians of two independent samples.\n\nFirst, we need to combine the scores from both groups and rank them:\n\nRanks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22\n\nGroup A ranks: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 (sum = 100)\nGroup B ranks: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22 (sum = 153)\n\nNow, we can calculate the U statistic for each group:\n\nU_A = n_A * n_B + (n_A * (n_A + 1)) / 2 - R_A = 10 * 12 + (10 * 11) / 2 - 100 = 120 - 100 = 20\nU_B = n_A * n_B - U_A = 120 - 20 = 100\n\nThe smaller U value is 20, so we will use that for our calculations. To find the p-value, we need to calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (U - mean) / standard deviation\n\nThe mean and standard deviation for the Mann-Whitney U test are:\n\nmean = n_A * n_B / 2 = 10 * 12 / 2 = 60\nstandard deviation = sqrt((n_A * n_B * (n_A + n_B + 1)) / 12) = sqrt((10 * 12 * (22)) / 12) ≈ 15.165\n\nNow, we can calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (20 - 60) / 15.165 ≈ -2.64\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the p-value is approximately 0.0082.\n\nSince the p-value (0.0082) is less than the significance level (usually 0.05), we can conclude that there is a significant difference between the medians of the two groups."
