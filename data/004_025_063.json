    "message_1": "A car of mass 1000 kg is traveling with a velocity of 20 m/s before it brakes and comes to a stop in 10 seconds. What is the average braking force applied to the car?",
    "message_2": "To find the average braking force, we can use the formula:\n\nForce = mass × acceleration\n\nFirst, we need to find the acceleration. Since the car comes to a stop, its final velocity is 0 m/s. We can use the formula:\n\nacceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time\n\nacceleration = (0 - 20) / 10\nacceleration = -2 m/s² (negative sign indicates deceleration)\n\nNow, we can find the force:\n\nForce = 1000 kg × -2 m/s²\nForce = -2000 N\n\nThe average braking force applied to the car is 2000 N (the negative sign indicates that the force is acting in the opposite direction of the initial velocity, which is expected for a braking force)."
