Solve the system of linear equations with the corrected data and find the values of x, y, and z.",
    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the system of linear equations with the corrected data:\n\n2x + y - z = 8\nx - y + 3z = 6\n4x + y + 2z = 4\n\nNow, we will solve the system of linear equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. We will eliminate y from the first two equations and from the first and third equations.\n\nTo eliminate y from the first two equations, we can add the first and second equations:\n\n(2x + y - z) + (x - y + 3z) = 8 + 6\n3x + 2z = 14\n\nNow, to eliminate y from the first and third equations, we can subtract the first equation from the third equation:\n\n(4x + y + 2z) - (2x + y - z) = 4 - 8\n2x + 3z = -4\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n3x + 2z = 14\n2x + 3z = -4\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of x the same:\n\n6x + 4z = 28\n6x + 9z = -12\n\nNow, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate x:\n\n(6x + 9z) - (6x + 4z) = -12 - 28\n5z = -40\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\nz = -40 / 5\nz = -8\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into one of the equations with x. Let's use the equation 3x + 2z = 14:\n\n3x + 2(-8) = 14\n3x - 16 = 14\n3x = 30\nx = 10\n\nNow we can substitute the values of x and z back into one of the original equations to find the value of y. Let's use the first equation 2x + y - z = 8:\n\n2(10) + y - (-8) = 8\n20 + y + 8 = 8\ny = -20\n\nSo the values of x, y, and z are:\n\nx = 10\ny = -20\nz = -8"
