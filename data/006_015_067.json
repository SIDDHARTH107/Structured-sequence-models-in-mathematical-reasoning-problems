    "message_2": "To calculate the probability, we need to first find the average number of phishing attacks per day.\n\nGiven that there are 2 phishing attacks per month, we can assume an average of 30 days in a month. Therefore, the average number of phishing attacks per day is:\n\n2 attacks / 30 days = 1/15 attacks per day\n\nNow, we can use the Poisson distribution to find the probability of a network experiencing a phishing attack on a given day. The Poisson distribution formula is:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nWhere P(x) is the probability of x events occurring in a given time period, λ is the average rate of events (in this case, phishing attacks) per time period, and x! is the factorial of x.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of experiencing 1 phishing attack on a given day (x = 1), and the average rate of phishing attacks per day is 1/15 (λ = 1/15).\n\nP(1) = (e^(-1/15) * (1/15)^1) / 1!\n\nP(1) = (0.933 * 0.067) / 1\nP(1) ≈ 0.062\n\nSo, the probability that a network will experience a phishing attack on a given day is approximately 6.2%."
