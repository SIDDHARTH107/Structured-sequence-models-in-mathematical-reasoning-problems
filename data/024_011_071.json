    "message_2": "To find the Laplacian of the function f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2, we first need to find the second partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z. \n\nThe first partial derivatives are:\n∂f/∂x = 2x\n∂f/∂y = 2y\n∂f/∂z = 2z\n\nNow, we find the second partial derivatives:\n∂²f/∂x² = 2\n∂²f/∂y² = 2\n∂²f/∂z² = 2\n\nThe Laplacian of a function is the sum of its second partial derivatives. In this case, the Laplacian of f(x, y, z) is:\n\nΔf = ∂²f/∂x² + ∂²f/∂y² + ∂²f/∂z² = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n\nSo, the Laplacian of the function f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 on the sphere M is 6."
