    "message_2": "To show that the set of all vector bundles over X that are isomorphic to E has the structure of a finite-dimensional vector space of dimension n, we will first define the addition and scalar multiplication operations on this set, and then show that it satisfies the axioms of a vector space.\n\nLet V be the set of all vector bundles over X that are isomorphic to E. For any two vector bundles A, B ∈ V, we can define the addition operation as the direct sum of the two vector bundles, denoted by A ⊕ B. Similarly, for any scalar α and a vector bundle A ∈ V, we can define the scalar multiplication operation as the tensor product of A with the trivial line bundle associated with the scalar α, denoted by α ⊗ A.\n\nNow, we will show that V, together with the addition and scalar multiplication operations, satisfies the axioms of a vector space:\n\n1. Associativity of addition: For any A, B, C ∈ V, we have (A ⊕ B) ⊕ C = A ⊕ (B ⊕ C), since the direct sum operation is associative.\n\n2. Commutativity of addition: For any A, B ∈ V, we have A ⊕ B = B ⊕ A, since the direct sum operation is commutative.\n\n3. Identity element of addition: Let 0 be the trivial vector bundle of rank 0. For any A ∈ V, we have A ⊕ 0 = A, since the direct sum of a vector bundle with the trivial bundle does not change the original bundle.\n\n4. Inverse elements of addition: For any A ∈ V, let -A be the dual of the vector bundle A. Then, A ⊕ (-A) = 0, since the direct sum of a vector bundle with its dual results in the trivial bundle.\n\n5. Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication: For any α, β ∈ ℝ (or ℂ) and A ∈ V, we have (αβ) ⊗ A = α ⊗ (β ⊗ A), since the tensor product operation is compatible with scalar multiplication.\n\n6. Identity element of scalar multiplication: For any A ∈ V, we have 1 ⊗ A = A, since the tensor product of a vector bundle with the trivial line bundle associated with the scalar 1 does not change the original bundle.\n\n7. Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition: For any α ∈ ℝ (or ℂ) and A, B ∈ V, we have α ⊗ (A ⊕ B) = (α ⊗ A) ⊕ (α ⊗ B), since the tensor product operation is distributive over the direct sum operation.\n\n8. Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to scalar addition: For any α, β ∈ ℝ (or ℂ) and A ∈ V, we have (α + β) ⊗ A = (α ⊗ A) ⊕ (β ⊗ A), since the tensor product operation is distributive over scalar addition.\n\nSince V satisfies all the axioms of a vector space, it is indeed a vector space. Moreover, since E has rank n, the dimension of V is also n, making V a finite-dimensional vector space of dimension n."
