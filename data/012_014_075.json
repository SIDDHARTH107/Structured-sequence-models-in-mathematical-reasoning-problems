If they are not isomorphic, explain why.",
    "message_2": "Since we do not have specific information about the structure of Graph A and Graph B, we cannot definitively determine if they are isomorphic or not. However, we can discuss the possibilities.\n\nIf both graphs have the same structure, then they are isomorphic. For example, if both graphs are cycles with 4 vertices and 4 edges, they are isomorphic. In this case, an isomorphism between them can be established by mapping the vertices of Graph A to the corresponding vertices of Graph B in a way that preserves adjacency.\n\nHowever, if the graphs have different structures, they are not isomorphic. For example, if Graph A is a cycle with 4 vertices and 4 edges, while Graph B is a star with 4 vertices and 3 edges, they are not isomorphic. In this case, there is no way to map the vertices of Graph A to the vertices of Graph B in a way that preserves adjacency.\n\nIn conclusion, without specific information about the structure of Graph A and Graph B, we cannot determine if they are isomorphic or not."
