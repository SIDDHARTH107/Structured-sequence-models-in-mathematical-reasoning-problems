    "message_2": "The Dragon Curve is a fractal that is generated by starting with a straight line segment and then replacing it with a series of connected segments, each one of which is a scaled and rotated copy of the original. With each iteration, the total length of the curve doubles.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length is 1 unit (the original segment).\nAfter the second iteration, the length is 2 units (1 * 2).\nAfter the third iteration, the length is 4 units (2 * 2).\nAfter the fourth iteration, the length is 8 units (4 * 2).\nAfter the fifth iteration, the length is 16 units (8 * 2).\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon Curve after the fifth iteration is 16 units."
