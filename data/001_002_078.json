    "message_2": "To find the slope and y-intercept of the given linear equation, we first need to rewrite it in the slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nGiven equation: 2x + 3y = 9\n\nStep 1: Isolate y on one side of the equation.\n3y = -2x + 9\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 3 to solve for y.\ny = (-2/3)x + 3\n\nNow, the equation is in the slope-intercept form.\n\nThe slope (m) is -2/3, and the y-intercept (b) is 3."
