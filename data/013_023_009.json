    "message_1": "In a Trust Game, player A is given $10 and can choose to keep it all, or send any amount to player B. The amount sent to player B is tripled and player B then decides how much (if any) to return to player A. If player B returns any amount to player A, the final payoff to player A is his original amount plus the amount returned by player B. Otherwise, the final payoff to player A is just his original amount. \n\nIf player A sends $5 to player B and player B decides to return $4 to player A, what is the final payoff to player A?",
    "message_2": "If player A sends $5 to player B, player A will have $5 left. The $5 sent to player B is tripled, so player B receives $15. Player B then decides to return $4 to player A. \n\nTo find the final payoff for player A, we add the amount player A kept ($5) and the amount returned by player B ($4). \n\nFinal payoff for player A = $5 + $4 = $9."
