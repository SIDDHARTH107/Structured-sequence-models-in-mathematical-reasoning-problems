    "message_1": "A triangle has a side length of 10 cm and an opposite angle of 30 degrees. Another side has a length of 14 cm. What is the length of the third side of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the third side of the triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c, the following equation holds:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, let's assign the given side lengths and angle to the variables:\n\na = 10 cm (side opposite the 30-degree angle)\nb = 14 cm\nC = 30 degrees\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (30 degrees) * (π / 180) = π / 6\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines equation:\n\nc² = (10 cm)² + (14 cm)² - 2(10 cm)(14 cm) * cos(π / 6)\n\nc² = 100 cm² + 196 cm² - 280 cm * (sqrt(3)/2)\n\nc² = 296 cm² - 140√3 cm\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √(296 cm² - 140√3 cm)\n\nThis is the exact length of the third side of the triangle. If you want to find an approximate value, you can use a calculator:\n\nc ≈ 5.35 cm"
