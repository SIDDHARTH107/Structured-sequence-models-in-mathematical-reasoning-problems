    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures and corresponding principal directions at the point (-1, 2, 5) on the surface z = x^2 + 2y^2, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms.\n\n1. First fundamental form:\nGiven the surface z = x^2 + 2y^2, we can define the position vector r(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + 2v^2), where u = x and v = y. Then, we can find the tangent vectors:\n\nru = dr/du = (1, 0, 2u)\nrv = dr/dv = (0, 1, 4v)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = ru • ru = 1 + 4u^2\nF = ru • rv = 8uv\nG = rv • rv = 1 + 16v^2\n\nAt the point (-1, 2, 5), we have u = -1 and v = 2:\n\nE = 1 + 4(-1)^2 = 5\nF = 8(-1)(2) = -16\nG = 1 + 16(2)^2 = 65\n\n2. Second fundamental form:\nWe need to find the normal vector N to the surface. We can compute the cross product of ru and rv:\n\nN = ru × rv = (-8u, -16v, 1)\n\nAt the point (-1, 2, 5), we have N = (8, -32, 1).\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\n\nL = N • ruu = 0\nM = N • ruv = -16\nN = N • rvv = -64\n\n3. Principal curvatures:\nWe can find the principal curvatures k1 and k2 by solving the characteristic equation:\n\n(E * N - 2 * F * M + G * L) * k^2 - (E * N^2 + G * L^2 - 2 * F * M * L) * k + (L * M^2 - 2 * M * N * L + N * L^2) = 0\n\nPlugging in the values of E, F, G, L, M, and N, we get:\n\n(5 * (-64) - 2 * (-16) * (-16) + 65 * 0) * k^2 - (5 * (-64)^2 + 65 * 0^2 - 2 * (-16) * (-16) * 0) * k + (0 * (-16)^2 - 2 * (-16) * (-64) * 0 + (-64) * 0^2) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-320k^2 + 20480k = 0\n\nk(k - 64) = 0\n\nThe principal curvatures are k1 = 0 and k2 = 64.\n\n4. Principal directions:\nTo find the principal directions, we need to solve the following system of equations for the direction vector (p, q):\n\nLp^2 + 2Mpq + Nq^2 = k1 * (Ep^2 + 2Fpq + Gq^2)\nLp^2 + 2Mpq + Nq^2 = k2 * (Ep^2 + 2Fpq + Gq^2)\n\nFor k1 = 0, we have:\n\n0 = Ep^2 + 2Fpq + Gq^2\n\nPlugging in the values of E, F, and G, we get:\n\n0 = 5p^2 - 16pq + 65q^2\n\nThe direction vector (p, q) can be (1, 0), which corresponds to the direction (1, 0, -2).\n\nFor k2 = 64, we have:\n\nLp^2 + 2Mpq + Nq^2 = 64 * (Ep^2 + 2Fpq + Gq^2)\n\nPlugging in the values of E, F, G, L, M, and N, we get:\n\n0p^2 - 32pq - 64q^2 = 64 * (5p^2 - 16pq + 65q^2)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n320p^2 - 992pq + 4224q^2 = 0\n\nThe direction vector (p, q) can be (0, 1), which corresponds to the direction (0, 1, 8).\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (-1, 2, 5) are k1 = 0 and k2 = 64, and the corresponding principal directions are (1, 0, -2) and (0, 1, 8)."
