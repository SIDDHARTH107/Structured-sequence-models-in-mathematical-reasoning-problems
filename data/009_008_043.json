    "message_2": "To find the frequency of the wave on the string, we can use the wave equation:\n\nv = fλ\n\nwhere v is the wave speed, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength.\n\nFirst, we need to find the wave speed (v). We can do this using the formula:\n\nv = √(T/μ)\n\nwhere T is the tension in the string (40 N) and μ is the linear mass density of the string (mass per unit length).\n\nTo find the linear mass density, we can use the formula:\n\nμ = m/L\n\nwhere m is the mass of the string (0.02 kg) and L is the length of the string (3 meters).\n\nμ = 0.02 kg / 3 m = 0.00666667 kg/m\n\nNow, we can find the wave speed:\n\nv = √(40 N / 0.00666667 kg/m) = √(6000 m²/s²) = 77.46 m/s\n\nNow that we have the wave speed, we can find the frequency using the wave equation:\n\nv = fλ\n\n77.46 m/s = f * 2 m\n\nf = 77.46 m/s / 2 m = 38.73 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the wave on the string is approximately 38.73 Hz."
