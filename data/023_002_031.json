    "message_2": "To determine the convergence of the Fourier series for the function f(x), we need to analyze the given Fourier coefficients an and bn.\n\nSince an = 0 for all n ≥ 0, the Fourier series simplifies to:\n\nf(x) = Σ(n=1 to ∞) [bn sin(nx)]\n\nNow, let's analyze the bn coefficients:\n\nbn = (2(1-(-1)^n))/(nπ)\n\nNotice that bn is nonzero only for odd values of n, as for even values of n, (-1)^n = 1 and bn becomes 0. Therefore, we can rewrite the Fourier series as:\n\nf(x) = Σ(n=1,3,5,...) [(2(1-(-1)^n))/(nπ) sin(nx)]\n\nNow, let's consider the convergence of the Fourier series. According to the Dirichlet's theorem, a Fourier series converges to the function f(x) at every point x where f(x) is continuous and converges to the average of the left and right limits at points of discontinuity.\n\nSince the bn coefficients decay as 1/n, the Fourier series converges pointwise to the function f(x) wherever f(x) is continuous. If f(x) has any points of discontinuity, the Fourier series will converge to the average of the left and right limits at those points.\n\nIn conclusion, the given Fourier series converges pointwise to the function f(x) wherever f(x) is continuous, and to the average of the left and right limits at points of discontinuity."
