    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 7x^2 + 10x, we need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the first derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. Let's first find the first derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 7x^2 + 10x) = 3x^2 - 14x + 10\n\nNow, we will use the quasi-Newton method to find the minimum value of the function. The quasi-Newton method is an iterative method that updates the estimate of the minimum value using the following formula:\n\nx(i+1) = x(i) - f'(x(i)) / f''(x(i))\n\nwhere f'(x(i)) is the first derivative of the function evaluated at x(i), and f''(x(i)) is the second derivative of the function evaluated at x(i). First, let's find the second derivative of the function:\n\nf''(x) = d^2/dx^2 (x^3 - 7x^2 + 10x) = 6x - 14\n\nNow, we will use the initial guess x0 = 0 and iterate until the difference between x(i+1) and x(i) is less than 0.001:\n\nIteration 1:\nx(1) = x(0) - f'(x(0)) / f''(x(0)) = 0 - (3(0)^2 - 14(0) + 10) / (6(0) - 14) = 0 - 10 / (-14) = 5/7 ≈ 0.7143\n\nIteration 2:\nx(2) = x(1) - f'(x(1)) / f''(x(1)) ≈ 0.7143 - (3(0.7143)^2 - 14(0.7143) + 10) / (6(0.7143) - 14)\n≈ 0.7143 - (-0.3061) / (-1.2857) ≈ 0.7143 + 0.2378 ≈ 0.9521\n\nIteration 3:\nx(3) = x(2) - f'(x(2)) / f''(x(2)) ≈ 0.9521 - (3(0.9521)^2 - 14(0.9521) + 10) / (6(0.9521) - 14)\n≈ 0.9521 - (-0.0451) / (-0.7126) ≈ 0.9521 + 0.0633 ≈ 1.0154\n\nSince the difference between x(3) and x(2) is less than 0.001, we can stop iterating. The minimum value of the function occurs at x ≈ 1.0154. To find the minimum value of the function, we can plug this value of x back into the original function:\n\nf(1.0154) ≈ (1.0154)^3 - 7(1.0154)^2 + 10(1.0154) ≈ -0.0298\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 7x^2 + 10x is approximately -0.0298."
