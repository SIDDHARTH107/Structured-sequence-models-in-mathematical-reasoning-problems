    "message_1": "Two drivers, Tom and Jerry, are driving on a narrow road towards each other. If one of them swerves, he will avoid the crash, but the swerver will be called a \"chicken.\" If neither swerves, they will both crash. Tom and Jerry know each other well and have played this game many times before. They both have the same interest in not crashing, but they also want to be perceived as brave and unwilling to yield the road. So, they want to avoid being the chicken while also not crashing. If Tom and Jerry drive towards each other at a speed of 50 km/h, and the distance between them is 500 meters, at what distance should they begin swerving to avoid crashing?",
    "message_2": "To determine the distance at which Tom and Jerry should begin swerving to avoid crashing, we first need to find the time it takes for them to reach the point of collision if neither swerves.\n\nSince both Tom and Jerry are driving towards each other at a speed of 50 km/h, their combined speed is 100 km/h. We need to convert this speed to meters per second to match the distance unit:\n\n100 km/h * (1000 m/km) * (1 h/3600 s) = 27.78 m/s (approximately)\n\nNow, we can find the time it takes for them to reach the point of collision:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 500 m / 27.78 m/s\nTime ≈ 18 seconds\n\nAssuming they want to swerve at the last possible moment to avoid crashing, they should begin swerving when they are only a fraction of a second away from the collision point. Let's say they want to swerve 0.5 seconds before the collision:\n\nSwerving time = 18 s - 0.5 s = 17.5 s\n\nNow, we can find the distance they have traveled in 17.5 seconds:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time\nDistance = 27.78 m/s * 17.5 s\nDistance ≈ 486.65 meters\n\nSo, Tom and Jerry should begin swerving when they are about 486.65 meters apart to avoid crashing."
