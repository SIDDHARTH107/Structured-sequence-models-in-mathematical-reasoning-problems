    "message_2": "There exists a perfect matching for this graph. A perfect matching is a set of edges such that every vertex in the graph is incident to exactly one edge in the matching.\n\nThe edges that form the perfect matching are:\n\n1. (A, B)\n2. (C, D)\n3. (E, F)\n4. (G, H)\n\nEach vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex in this matching, and no vertex is left unconnected."
