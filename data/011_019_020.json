    "message_1": "A small manufacturing company is conducting experiments to determine the optimal settings for a new machine. The machine has four independent adjustable factors, each with three levels. The company decides to use an Orthogonal Array OA(27,4,3) to design their experiments. How many experiments will they need to run to cover all possible combinations of factor settings?",
    "message_2": "An Orthogonal Array OA(n, k, s) is a statistical method used to design experiments, where n is the number of experiments, k is the number of factors, and s is the number of levels for each factor.\n\nIn this case, the company is using an OA(27, 4, 3) design. This means they will need to run 27 experiments to cover all possible combinations of factor settings."
