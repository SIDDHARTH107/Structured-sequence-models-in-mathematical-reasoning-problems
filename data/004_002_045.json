    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 5x + 2) / (x - 1) as x approaches 3, we can first try to simplify the function by factoring the numerator.\n\n3x^2 - 5x + 2 can be factored as (3x - 2)(x - 1).\n\nSo, the function f(x) can be written as:\n\nf(x) = [(3x - 2)(x - 1)] / (x - 1)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the (x - 1) terms in the numerator and denominator:\n\nf(x) = 3x - 2\n\nNow that we have simplified the function, we can find the limit as x approaches 3:\n\nlim (x->3) (3x - 2) = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7\n\nSo, the limit of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 5x + 2) / (x - 1) as x approaches 3 is 7."
