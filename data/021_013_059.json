    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces metal sheets of length 1000 mm and width 500 mm. The cost of producing a metal sheet depends on the thickness of the sheet. The cost function can be expressed as follows:\n\nC(x) = 2500x^2 + 3000x + 5000\n\nwhere x is the thickness of the sheet in millimeters. The company wants to produce a metal sheet of a given thickness that minimizes the cost. Using simulated annealing method, find the minimum cost of producing the metal sheet if the thickness can vary from 1 mm to 10 mm.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function, which is the cost function C(x).\n2. Set an initial temperature T and a cooling rate alpha.\n3. Choose an initial solution x0 within the given range (1 mm to 10 mm).\n4. Repeat the following steps until the temperature is low enough:\n   a. Generate a random neighboring solution x1.\n   b. Calculate the change in cost, delta_cost = C(x1) - C(x0).\n   c. If delta_cost < 0, accept the new solution x1.\n   d. If delta_cost >= 0, accept the new solution x1 with probability exp(-delta_cost / T).\n   e. Update the temperature T = alpha * T.\n\nLet's implement the simulated annealing algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef cost_function(x):\n    return 2500 * x**2 + 3000 * x + 5000\n\ndef simulated_annealing(T, alpha, x0, lower_bound, upper_bound):\n    current_cost = cost_function(x0)\n    best_cost = current_cost\n    best_x = x0\n\n    while T > 1e-6:\n        x1 = random.uniform(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n        new_cost = cost_function(x1)\n        delta_cost = new_cost - current_cost\n\n        if delta_cost < 0 or math.exp(-delta_cost / T) > random.random():\n            current_cost = new_cost\n            x0 = x1\n\n            if new_cost < best_cost:\n                best_cost = new_cost\n                best_x = x1\n\n        T *= alpha\n\n    return best_x, best_cost\n\nT = 1000\nalpha = 0.99\nx0 = random.uniform(1, 10)\nlower_bound = 1\nupper_bound = 10\n\nbest_x, min_cost = simulated_annealing(T, alpha, x0, lower_bound, upper_bound)\nprint(\"Minimum cost:\", min_cost)\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum cost found using the simulated annealing method. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm. You can run the algorithm multiple times to get a more accurate result."
