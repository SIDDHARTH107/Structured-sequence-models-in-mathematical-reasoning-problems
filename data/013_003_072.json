    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, two players are given a pot of $100 to share in any way they agree upon. Player 1 suggests a split, and player 2 can either accept or reject it. If player 2 rejects it, neither player gets any money. However, if player 2 accepts the split, each player gets the respective amount.\n\nPlayer 1 suggests a split of $70 for herself and $30 for player 2. What is the rational response for player 2? Calculate the possible payoffs for both players for accepting and rejecting the proposal.",
    "message_2": "If player 2 accepts the proposal, the payoffs are as follows:\n- Player 1 gets $70\n- Player 2 gets $30\n\nIf player 2 rejects the proposal, the payoffs are as follows:\n- Player 1 gets $0\n- Player 2 gets $0\n\nThe rational response for player 2 would be to accept the proposal, as they would receive $30 instead of $0. Even though the split is not equal, it is still better for player 2 to accept the $30 rather than rejecting the proposal and receiving nothing."
