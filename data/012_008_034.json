    "message_2": "To determine if a graph is planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (including the outer face).\n\nWe are given a graph with 10 vertices (V = 10) and 15 edges (E = 15). We can use another property of planar graphs to find an upper bound for the number of edges:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for our graph:\n\n15 ≤ 3(10) - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nSince 15 is less than or equal to 24, it is possible that the graph is planar. However, we need to check if there exists a planar embedding of the graph.\n\nLet's use Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on two sets of 3 vertices).\n\nIn our case, the maximum number of edges in a complete graph with 10 vertices is:\n\nE(K10) = (10 * 9) / 2 = 45\n\nSince our graph has only 15 edges, it is not possible to have a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5, as K5 has 10 edges. Similarly, K3,3 has 9 edges, and it is also not possible to have a subgraph that is a subdivision of K3,3 with only 15 edges.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges is planar."
