    "message_2": "To calculate the price of a one-year call option with a strike price of $110 using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to first find the values of d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nWhere:\nS = initial stock price = $100\nK = strike price = $110\nr = risk-free interest rate = 0.04\nσ = volatility = 0.2\nT = time to expiration (in years) = 1\n\nFirst, calculate d1:\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.04 + (0.2^2)/2) * 1) / (0.2 * sqrt(1))\nd1 = (-0.0953 + 0.06) / 0.2\nd1 = -0.0353 / 0.2\nd1 = -0.1765\n\nNext, calculate d2:\nd2 = -0.1765 - 0.2 * sqrt(1)\nd2 = -0.3765\n\nNow, we can calculate the call option price using the Black-Scholes equation:\n\nCall option price = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-r * T) * N(d2)\n\nWhere N(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\nN(d1) = N(-0.1765) = 0.4299\nN(d2) = N(-0.3765) = 0.3533\n\nNow, calculate the call option price:\nCall option price = 100 * 0.4299 - 110 * e^(-0.04 * 1) * 0.3533\nCall option price = 42.99 - 110 * 0.9608 * 0.3533\nCall option price = 42.99 - 36.47\nCall option price = $6.52\n\nSo, the price of a one-year call option with a strike price of $110 is approximately $6.52."
