    "message_1": "Certainly! Here's a problem the student could solve:\n\n\"A string of length 3 meters is tied to a wall at one end and attached to a mass of 0.5 kg at the other. The mass is initially at rest, and the string is then given a displacement of 1 meter from its original position. Assuming the wave equation for transverse waves on a string with tension T and linear mass density μ is given by:\n\n∂²y/∂x² = (1/v²) ∂²y/∂t²,\n\nwhere y is the displacement of the string, x is the position along the string, t is time, and v = √(T/μ) is the wave velocity of the string,\n\n(a) find the general solution to the wave equation for this scenario,\n(b) find the equation for the displacement of the string at a point x = 1.5 meters and time t = 1 second.\"",
    "message_2": "(a) To find the general solution to the wave equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let y(x, t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\nX''(x)T(t) = (1/v²) X(x)T''(t),\n\nwhere X''(x) and T''(t) denote the second derivatives of X(x) and T(t) with respect to x and t, respectively. Now, divide both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = (1/v²) T''(t)/T(t).\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on t, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call -k²:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = T''(t)/T(t) = -k².\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + k²X(x) = 0,\nT''(t) + k²v²T(t) = 0.\n\nThe general solution to the first equation is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(kx) + B*sin(kx),\n\nwhere A and B are constants. The general solution to the second equation is:\n\nT(t) = C*cos(kvt) + D*sin(kvt),\n\nwhere C and D are constants. Thus, the general solution to the wave equation is:\n\ny(x, t) = (A*cos(kx) + B*sin(kx))(C*cos(kvt) + D*sin(kvt)).\n\n(b) To find the equation for the displacement of the string at x = 1.5 meters and t = 1 second, we need to apply the initial and boundary conditions. However, the problem statement does not provide enough information to determine the specific form of the solution. We need more information about the initial displacement and velocity of the string, as well as the boundary conditions at the ends of the string."
