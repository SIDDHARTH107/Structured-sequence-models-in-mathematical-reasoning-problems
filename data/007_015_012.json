    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. The first few Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, and so on. To find the 7th Mersenne prime, we need to find the 7th prime number for the exponent n and then calculate 2^n - 1.\n\nThe first 7 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17. The 7th prime number is 17.\n\nNow, we can calculate the 7th Mersenne prime:\n\nM_17 = 2^17 - 1\nM_17 = 131072 - 1\nM_17 = 131071\n\nThe 7th Mersenne prime number is 131,071."
