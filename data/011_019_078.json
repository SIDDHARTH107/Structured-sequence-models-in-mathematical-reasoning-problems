    "message_2": "To form a 4-digit number using a 2x2 orthogonal array, we need to arrange the digits in such a way that no two digits repeat in the same row or column. Let's consider the possible arrangements:\n\nFor the first position (top-left corner), we have 6 choices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n\nOnce we have chosen the first digit, we have 5 choices left for the second position (top-right corner), since we cannot repeat the digit in the same row.\n\nFor the third position (bottom-left corner), we have 4 choices left, since we cannot repeat the digit in the same column as the first position.\n\nFinally, for the fourth position (bottom-right corner), we have 3 choices left, since we cannot repeat the digits in the same row as the second position or the same column as the third position.\n\nSo, the total number of different 4-digit numbers that can be formed is:\n\n6 (choices for the first position) × 5 (choices for the second position) × 4 (choices for the third position) × 3 (choices for the fourth position) = 360\n\nTherefore, 360 different 4-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 such that no two digits repeat in the same row or column when arranged in a 2x2 orthogonal array."
