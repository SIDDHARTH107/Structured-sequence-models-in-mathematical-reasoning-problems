    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nAn engineer is designing a rectangular water tank with a capacity of 1000 cubic meters. The base of the tank will be made of concrete with a cost of $150 per square meter, while the sides will be made of glass with a cost of $100 per square meter. Using differential evolution, determine the dimensions of the tank that will minimize the total cost.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total cost of the rectangular water tank, we need to find the dimensions (length, width, and height) that result in the lowest cost for the given materials. Let's denote the length as x, the width as y, and the height as z. The volume of the tank is given by V = xyz, and we know that V = 1000 cubic meters.\n\nThe cost function for the tank can be defined as follows:\n\nCost = Base cost + Side cost\nCost = 150 * (x * y) + 100 * (2 * (x * z) + 2 * (y * z))\n\nSince we know the volume is 1000 cubic meters, we can rewrite the height z in terms of x and y:\n\nz = 1000 / (x * y)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for z back into the cost function:\n\nCost = 150 * (x * y) + 100 * (2 * (x * (1000 / (x * y))) + 2 * (y * (1000 / (x * y))))\n\nSimplifying the cost function:\n\nCost = 150xy + 200 * (1000/x + 1000/y)\n\nNow, we can use differential evolution to minimize this cost function. Differential evolution is a numerical optimization algorithm that works by iteratively improving candidate solutions. However, as an AI language model, I am unable to perform iterative calculations. Instead, I can guide you through the process of using a programming language or software to perform the optimization.\n\nFor example, you can use Python with the `scipy.optimize` library to perform differential evolution. Here's a sample code to get you started:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import differential_evolution\n\ndef cost_function(params):\n    x, y = params\n    z = 1000 / (x * y)\n    cost = 150 * (x * y) + 200 * (1000/x + 1000/y)\n    return cost\n\nbounds = [(1, 100), (1, 100)]  # Set reasonable bounds for x and y\nresult = differential_evolution(cost_function, bounds)\n\nx_opt, y_opt = result.x\nz_opt = 1000 / (x_opt * y_opt)\n\nprint(f\"Optimal dimensions: Length = {x_opt:.2f} m, Width = {y_opt:.2f} m, Height = {z_opt:.2f} m\")\nprint(f\"Minimum cost: ${result.fun:.2f}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the optimal dimensions for the rectangular water tank that minimize the total cost."
