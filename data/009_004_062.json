    "message_2": "To find the motion of the mass, we will use the equation of motion for simple harmonic motion:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement from equilibrium at time t, A is the amplitude of oscillation, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency (ω). We can do this using the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and m is the mass. Plugging in the given values:\n\nω = sqrt(100 N/m / 10 kg) = sqrt(10 s^(-2)) = 1 s^(-1)\n\nNow, we need to find the amplitude (A) and phase angle (φ). We can use the initial conditions to do this. At t = 0, the displacement is 0.2 m and the velocity is 0.5 m/s. Using the equation of motion:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(φ) = 0.2 m\n\nThe derivative of the equation of motion with respect to time gives the velocity:\n\nv(t) = -A * ω * sin(ωt + φ)\n\nAt t = 0, the velocity is:\n\nv(0) = -A * ω * sin(φ) = 0.5 m/s\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (A and φ):\n\n0.2 = A * cos(φ)\n0.5 = -A * (1) * sin(φ)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using trigonometric identities. Squaring both equations and adding them together, we get:\n\n0.2^2 + 0.5^2 = A^2 * (cos^2(φ) + sin^2(φ))\n\n0.04 + 0.25 = A^2\n\nA^2 = 0.29\nA = sqrt(0.29) ≈ 0.5385 m\n\nNow we can find the phase angle (φ) using either equation. Let's use the first equation:\n\n0.2 = 0.5385 * cos(φ)\n\ncos(φ) = 0.2 / 0.5385 ≈ 0.3714\n\nφ = arccos(0.3714) ≈ 1.2094 radians\n\nNow we have all the parameters needed for the equation of motion:\n\nx(t) = 0.5385 * cos(1t + 1.2094)\n\nThis equation describes the motion of the mass as a function of time."
