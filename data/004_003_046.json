    "message_2": "We can use the formula for velocity in terms of acceleration and time:\n\nv = at\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.\n\nWe are given the acceleration (a = 10 m/s^2) and the final velocity (v = 100 m/s). We need to find the time (t).\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for t:\n\nt = v/a\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nt = (100 m/s) / (10 m/s^2)\n\nt = 10 s\n\nThe car will reach a velocity of 100 m/s in 10 seconds."
