    "message_2": "Without a specific graph to analyze, I will provide a general approach to finding the automorphism group of a given graph.\n\n1. Label the vertices of the graph. For example, if there are 6 vertices, label them as A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n\n2. Determine the degree of each vertex (the number of edges connected to it).\n\n3. Identify vertices with the same degree. These vertices may potentially be part of an automorphism.\n\n4. For each pair of vertices with the same degree, check if their adjacent vertices also have the same degree. If they do, continue to step 5. If not, discard this pair as a potential automorphism.\n\n5. For each valid pair of vertices, try swapping their positions in the graph. If the edge structure remains the same, this swap is an automorphism.\n\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for all possible permutations of vertices with the same degree.\n\n7. Combine all valid automorphisms to form the automorphism group of the graph.\n\nNote that the identity permutation (where no vertices are swapped) is always part of the automorphism group."
