    "message_2": "To find the number of people expected to participate in the event, we can multiply the total number of residents by the percentage of residents willing to participate.\n\nNumber of participants = (Percentage of willing residents) × (Total number of residents)\nNumber of participants = (62%) × (500)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:\n62% = 62/100 = 0.62\n\nNow, we can multiply:\nNumber of participants = 0.62 × 500 = 310\n\nSo, 310 people can be expected to participate in the community event."
