    "message_1": "Two suspects, John and Jane, are arrested for theft. The police do not have enough evidence to convict them of theft but they do have enough evidence to convict them of a lesser charge. The police offer both suspects the chance to confess. If John confesses and Jane remains silent, then John will go free and Jane will be convicted and vice versa. If both confess, then both will receive a sentence. If both remain silent, then both will be convicted but receive a lighter sentence. Using the payoff matrix, determine the best strategy for each suspect and the outcome of the game. \n\nPayoff Matrix:\n\n|           | John Confesses | John Remains Silent |\n|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Jane Confesses | John: 5 years, Jane: 5 years  | John: 0 years, Jane: 10 years |\n| Jane Remains Silent | John: 10 years, Jane: 0 years | John: 2 years, Jane: 2 years | \n\nWhat is the optimal strategy for John and Jane, and what will be the outcome of the game?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal strategy for John and Jane, we need to analyze the payoff matrix and find the Nash equilibrium, where neither player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nFor John:\n- If Jane confesses, John's best response is to confess (5 years) instead of remaining silent (10 years).\n- If Jane remains silent, John's best response is to confess (0 years) instead of remaining silent (2 years).\n\nFor Jane:\n- If John confesses, Jane's best response is to confess (5 years) instead of remaining silent (10 years).\n- If John remains silent, Jane's best response is to confess (0 years) instead of remaining silent (2 years).\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when both John and Jane confess, as neither can improve their outcome by changing their strategy unilaterally. Therefore, the optimal strategy for both John and Jane is to confess, and the outcome of the game will be that both receive a 5-year sentence."
