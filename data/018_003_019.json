    "message_2": "To find the union of sets A and B, we combine all the elements from both sets, without repeating any elements. Therefore, the set C can be written as:\n\nC = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}\n\nNow, we need to prove that C is a superset of both A and B. By definition, a set X is a superset of set Y if every element of Y is also an element of X. \n\nLet's check if C is a superset of A:\n\n1 ∈ C, 2 ∈ C, and 3 ∈ C. All elements of A are in C, so C is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if C is a superset of B:\n\n2 ∈ C, 4 ∈ C, and 6 ∈ C. All elements of B are in C, so C is a superset of B.\n\nThus, we have proven that C is a superset of both A and B."
