    "message_2": "To determine the treewidth of graph G, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. A graph with n vertices and m edges has treewidth at most min(n-1, 2m/n).\n2. A tree decomposition of a graph is a tree where each node is associated with a subset of vertices of the graph, and the following conditions hold:\n   a. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there is a node in the tree decomposition whose associated subset contains both u and v.\n   b. For each vertex v in the graph, the nodes in the tree decomposition whose associated subsets contain v form a connected subtree.\n\nNow, let's apply these facts to graph G with 7 vertices and 9 edges:\n\n1. The treewidth of G is at most min(7-1, 2*9/7) = min(6, 18/7) = min(6, 2.57) = 2.57. Since treewidth is an integer, we can round it up to 3.\n\nNow, we need to check if there exists a tree decomposition of G with width 2 (i.e., each subset of vertices in the decomposition has at most 3 vertices). If such a decomposition exists, then the treewidth of G is 2; otherwise, it is 3.\n\nTo check for a tree decomposition of width 2, we can try to find a vertex of degree at most 2 in G. If we can find such a vertex, we can remove it from G and recursively check for a tree decomposition of width 2 in the remaining graph. If we cannot find such a vertex, then the treewidth of G is at least 3.\n\nSince G has 7 vertices and 9 edges, its average degree is (2*9)/7 ≈ 2.57. This means that there must be at least one vertex with degree at most 2. Let's remove this vertex and its incident edges from G, resulting in a graph G' with 6 vertices and at most 7 edges.\n\nRepeating the same argument, the average degree of G' is (2*7)/6 ≈ 2.33, which means that there must be at least one vertex with degree at most 2 in G'. We can continue this process until we are left with a single vertex, which has degree 0.\n\nSince we were able to find a tree decomposition of width 2 for G, its treewidth is 2."
