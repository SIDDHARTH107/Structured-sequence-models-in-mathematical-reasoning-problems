    "message_2": "To find the vertex form equation of the absolute value function that passes through the points (2, -3) and (6, 1), we can use the general form of an absolute value function:\n\ny = a|x - h| + k\n\nwhere (h, k) is the vertex of the function, and a is a constant that determines the steepness of the function.\n\nFirst, let's find the midpoint of the two given points, which will be the vertex of the function:\n\nMidpoint = ((x1 + x2) / 2, (y1 + y2) / 2)\n\nMidpoint = ((2 + 6) / 2, (-3 + 1) / 2)\n\nMidpoint = (4, -1)\n\nSo, the vertex of the function is (4, -1), which means h = 4 and k = -1. Now, we can substitute one of the given points into the equation to find the value of a. Let's use the point (2, -3):\n\n-3 = a|2 - 4| - 1\n\n-3 = a|-2| - 1\n\n-3 = 2a - 1\n\n2a = -2\n\na = -1\n\nNow that we have the values for a, h, and k, we can write the vertex form equation of the absolute value function:\n\ny = -1|x - 4| - 1"
