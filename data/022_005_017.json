    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) = (3z + 2)/(z^2 + 2z + 1) at its pole z = -1, we first need to determine the order of the pole. We can do this by factoring the denominator:\n\nz^2 + 2z + 1 = (z + 1)^2\n\nSince (z + 1)^2 is a factor of the denominator, the pole at z = -1 is of order 2.\n\nNow, we will find the residue using the formula for a pole of order n:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = (1/(n-1)!) * Lim[z->-1] (d^(n-1)/dz^(n-1))[(z + 1)^n * f(z)]\n\nIn this case, n = 2, so the formula becomes:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = Lim[z->-1] d/dz[(z + 1)^2 * f(z)]\n\nNow, let's compute the derivative:\n\nd/dz[(z + 1)^2 * f(z)] = d/dz[((3z + 2)(z + 1)^2)/(z^2 + 2z + 1)]\n\nSince the denominator is just (z + 1)^2, this simplifies to:\n\nd/dz[(3z + 2)(z + 1)^2]\n\nNow, we'll compute the derivative using the product rule:\n\n= (3)(z + 1)^2 + 2(3z + 2)(z + 1)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the limit as z approaches -1:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = (3)(-1 + 1)^2 + 2(3(-1) + 2)(-1 + 1)\n= 3(0) + 2(-1)(0)\n= 0\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) at its pole z = -1 is 0."
