    "message_2": "To determine if the sequence {3,3,3,2,2,2} is a degree sequence of a graph with 6 vertices and 8 edges, we can use the Havel-Hakimi theorem. The Havel-Hakimi theorem states that a sequence of non-negative integers is graphical (i.e., it can be the degree sequence of a simple graph) if and only if the sequence obtained by deleting the first number and subtracting 1 from the next k numbers (where k is the first number) is graphical.\n\nFirst, we need to sort the sequence in non-increasing order: {3,3,3,2,2,2}\n\nNow, we apply the Havel-Hakimi theorem:\n\n1. Remove the first number (3) and subtract 1 from the next 3 numbers: {3,2,1,2,2}\n2. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order: {3,2,2,2,1}\n3. Remove the first number (3) and subtract 1 from the next 3 numbers: {1,1,1,1}\n4. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order: {1,1,1,1}\n5. Remove the first number (1) and subtract 1 from the next 1 number: {0,1,1}\n6. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order: {1,1,0}\n7. Remove the first number (1) and subtract 1 from the next 1 number: {0,0}\n8. Sort the sequence in non-increasing order: {0,0}\n\nWe have reached a sequence of all zeros, which means that the original sequence {3,3,3,2,2,2} is a degree sequence of a graph with 6 vertices and 8 edges."
