    "message_1": "A curve is defined by the equation y = x^2/2 between x = 0 and x = 4. Find the arc length of the curve over this interval.",
    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve, we can use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x):\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nwhere L is the arc length, a and b are the limits of integration (in this case, x = 0 and x = 4), and f'(x) is the derivative of the function with respect to x.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function y = x^2/2:\n\nf(x) = x^2/2\nf'(x) = d(x^2/2)/dx = x\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] sqrt(1 + x^2) dx\n\nThis integral is not elementary, so we can't find an explicit expression for it. However, we can approximate the value of the integral numerically. Using a numerical integration method, such as Simpson's rule or a numerical integration calculator, we find:\n\nL ≈ 6.08276\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^2/2 between x = 0 and x = 4 is approximately 6.08276 units."
