    "message_2": "To determine whether the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] converges pointwise to f(x) at the point x = π/2, we need to find the Fourier series representation of f(x) and then evaluate it at x = π/2.\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a function f(x) on the interval [-π, π] is given by:\n\nf(x) ≈ (a_0 / 2) + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, defined as:\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nFor f(x) = x, we can calculate the Fourier coefficients:\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] x dx = 0 (since the integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero)\n\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(n * x) dx = 0 (again, since the integrand is an odd function)\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(n * x) dx\n\nTo find b_n, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1 / n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-x / n) * cos(n * x) |(-π, π) + (1 / n) * ∫[-π, π] cos(n * x) dx]\n\nThe second term in the brackets is zero because the integral of an even function (cos(n * x)) over a symmetric interval is zero.\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-1 / n) * (π * cos(n * π) - (-π * cos(-n * π)))]\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [(-1 / n) * (π * cos(n * π) + π * cos(n * π))]\n\nb_n = (-2 / n) * cos(n * π) (for n ≠ 0)\n\nNow, we have the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x:\n\nf(x) ≈ Σ [(-2 / n) * cos(n * π) * sin(n * x)]\n\nTo check the convergence at x = π/2, we plug in x = π/2:\n\nf(π/2) ≈ Σ [(-2 / n) * cos(n * π) * sin(n * π/2)]\n\nSince f(π/2) = π/2, we want to see if the series converges to π/2:\n\nπ/2 ≈ Σ [(-2 / n) * cos(n * π) * sin(n * π/2)]\n\nNotice that cos(n * π) = (-1)^n, so we can rewrite the series as:\n\nπ/2 ≈ Σ [(-1)^n * (2 / n) * sin(n * π/2)]\n\nThis series converges to π/2 by the Dirichlet's theorem on pointwise convergence of Fourier series, which states that if a function is piecewise continuous and has a piecewise continuous derivative on the interval, then its Fourier series converges pointwise to the function.\n\nIn conclusion, the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π] converges pointwise to f(x) at the point x = π/2."
