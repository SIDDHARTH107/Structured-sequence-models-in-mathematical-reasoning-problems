    "message_2": "In a transposition cipher using a matrix, the plaintext message is written into the matrix row by row, and then the ciphertext is formed by reading the matrix column by column. If the matrix has 6 rows and the ciphertext has 60 characters, then the number of columns in the matrix can be calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of columns = Total number of characters / Number of rows\nNumber of columns = 60 / 6\nNumber of columns = 10\n\nSince the plaintext message was written into the matrix row by row, the original length of the plaintext message is equal to the total number of characters in the matrix:\n\nOriginal length of plaintext message = Number of rows × Number of columns\nOriginal length of plaintext message = 6 × 10\nOriginal length of plaintext message = 60 characters"
