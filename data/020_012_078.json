    "message_2": "To maximize the area of the rectangular park, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = length × width) and the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)). We are given the perimeter as 600 meters.\n\nLet's denote the length as L and the width as W. Then, we have:\n\n2 × (L + W) = 600\nL + W = 300\n\nNow, we need to express one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's express the width (W) in terms of the length (L):\n\nW = 300 - L\n\nNow, we can write the area formula in terms of L:\n\nArea = L × (300 - L)\n\nTo maximize the area, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of the area function with respect to L and setting it to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dL = d(L × (300 - L))/dL\n\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n\nd(Area)/dL = (300 - L) - L\n\nNow, set the derivative to zero and solve for L:\n\n0 = (300 - L) - L\n0 = 300 - 2L\n2L = 300\nL = 150\n\nNow, we can find the width (W) using the formula W = 300 - L:\n\nW = 300 - 150\nW = 150\n\nSo, the dimensions of the park that will result in the largest area are 150 meters by 150 meters."
