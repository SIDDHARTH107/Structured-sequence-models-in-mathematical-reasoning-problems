    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 200, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that 2^p - 1 > 200.\n\nLet's check the prime numbers greater than 7 (since 2^7 - 1 = 128, which is less than 200):\n\np = 11: 2^11 - 1 = 2047, which is divisible by 23 and 89, so it's not prime.\n\np = 13: 2^13 - 1 = 8191, which is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 200 is 8191."
