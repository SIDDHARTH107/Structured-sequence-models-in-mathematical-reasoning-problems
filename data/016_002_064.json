    "message_2": "A Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is created by iteratively replacing each side of an equilateral triangle with a smaller equilateral triangle. The perimeter of a Koch snowflake after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (3 * side_length) * (4^n) / (3^n)\n\nIn this case, the side length is 1 unit, and the number of iterations is 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPerimeter = (3 * 1) * (4^4) / (3^4)\nPerimeter = 3 * (256) / (81)\nPerimeter = 768 / 81\nPerimeter â‰ˆ 9.4815\n\nSo, the perimeter of a Koch snowflake after four iterations with a starting side length of 1 unit is approximately 9.4815 units."
