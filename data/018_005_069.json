    "message_1": "Let A be a set of prime numbers such that A = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}, and B be the set of non-prime numbers such that B = {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}. \n\nFind the intersection of A and its complement.",
    "message_2": "The complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements that are not in A. In this case, since A contains prime numbers and B contains non-prime numbers, the complement of A is B. Therefore, A' = B = {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}.\n\nThe intersection of A and its complement, denoted as A ∩ A', is the set of all elements that are common to both A and A'. Since A contains prime numbers and A' contains non-prime numbers, there are no common elements between A and A'.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of A and its complement is the empty set, denoted as ∅ or {}."
