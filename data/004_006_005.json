    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x - 4, we first need to find its derivative, f'(x). \n\nUsing the power rule, we have:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 24\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points of the function. To do this, we can set f'(x) to 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 18x + 24\n\nTo make it easier to solve, we can divide the entire equation by 3:\n\n0 = x^2 - 6x + 8\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n0 = (x - 4)(x - 2)\n\nFrom this factored form, we can find the critical points by setting each factor to 0:\n\nx - 4 = 0 => x = 4\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x - 4 are x = 2 and x = 4."
