    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 120, we first need to find the possible group structures. The prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. Now, we'll use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: There are 1, 3, 5, or 15 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8. If there is only one, it is normal, and the group would be a direct product of the Sylow subgroups, which would be abelian. So, we need to consider the cases with 3, 5, or 15 Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: There are 1, 4, 10, or 40 Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3. If there is only one, it is normal, and the group would be a direct product of the Sylow subgroups, which would be abelian. So, we need to consider the cases with 4, 10, or 40 Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\n3. Sylow 5-subgroups: There are 1, 6, or 24 Sylow 5-subgroups of order 5. If there is only one, it is normal, and the group would be a direct product of the Sylow subgroups, which would be abelian. So, we need to consider the cases with 6 or 24 Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\nNow, we analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n- 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 6 Sylow 5-subgroups: This combination is not possible because the total number of subgroups would exceed 120.\n\n- 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 24 Sylow 5-subgroups: This combination is not possible because the total number of subgroups would exceed 120.\n\n- 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 6 Sylow 5-subgroups: This combination is not possible because the total number of subgroups would exceed 120.\n\n- 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 24 Sylow 5-subgroups: This combination is not possible because the total number of subgroups would exceed 120.\n\n- 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 6 Sylow 5-subgroups: This combination is not possible because the total number of subgroups would exceed 120.\n\n- 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 24 Sylow 5-subgroups: This combination is not possible because the total number of subgroups would exceed 120.\n\n- 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 6 Sylow 5-subgroups: This combination is not possible because the total number of subgroups would exceed 120.\n\n- 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 24 Sylow 5-subgroups: This combination is not possible because the total number of subgroups would exceed 120.\n\n- 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 6 Sylow 5-subgroups: This combination is possible, and it corresponds to the group structure of the symmetric group S_5.\n\n- 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 24 Sylow 5-subgroups: This combination is not possible because the total number of subgroups would exceed 120.\n\n- 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 6 Sylow 5-subgroups: This combination is not possible because the total number of subgroups would exceed 120.\n\n- 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 24 Sylow 5-subgroups: This combination is not possible because the total number of subgroups would exceed 120.\n\nSo, there is only one non-abelian group of order 120, which is the symmetric group S_5."
