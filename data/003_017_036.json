    "message_2": "To find the average value of a function over an interval [a, b], we can use the formula:\n\naverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, f(x) = 2sin(2x), a = 0, and b = π. So, we have:\n\naverage value = (1/(π-0)) * ∫[0, π] 2sin(2x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of 2sin(2x) from 0 to π:\n\n∫[0, π] 2sin(2x) dx\n\nTo integrate 2sin(2x), we can use substitution. Let u = 2x, so du/dx = 2, and dx = du/2:\n\n(1/2) * ∫[0, 2π] sin(u) du\n\nNow, we can integrate sin(u):\n\n(1/2) * [-cos(u)] from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, we can plug in the limits of integration:\n\n(1/2) * ([-cos(2π)] - [-cos(0)])\n\ncos(2π) = 1 and cos(0) = 1, so we have:\n\n(1/2) * (1 - 1) = 0\n\nNow, we can find the average value:\n\naverage value = (1/π) * 0 = 0\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 2sin(2x) over the interval [0, π] is 0."
