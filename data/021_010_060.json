    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 1, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined. \n\nLet's find the first derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 1) = 3x^2 - 8x + 3\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x where f'(x) = 0. To do this, we will use Newton's method. Newton's method is an iterative method to find the roots of a function, given by the formula:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nIn our case, we want to find the roots of f'(x), so we will use the following formula:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nFirst, let's find the second derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 8x + 3) = 6x - 8\n\nNow, we will apply Newton's method iteratively until we reach the desired accuracy (up to two decimal places). We will start with an initial guess, x_0. Since the function is a cubic polynomial, it's a good idea to start with x_0 = 1 or x_0 = 2, as the minimum value is likely to be between these two points.\n\nLet's start with x_0 = 1:\n\nx_1 = x_0 - f'(x_0) / f''(x_0) = 1 - (3(1)^2 - 8(1) + 3) / (6(1) - 8) = 1 - (-2) / (-2) = 1\n\nSince x_1 = x_0, we have already found the root of f'(x) = 0, which is x = 1. This means that the minimum value of the function occurs at x = 1.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum value of the function f(x) at x = 1:\n\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 4(1)^2 + 3(1) + 1 = 1 - 4 + 3 + 1 = 1\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 1 is 1, and it occurs at x = 1."
