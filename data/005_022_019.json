    "message_2": "First, let's list the original scores in ascending order:\n\nx1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, 90\n\nThe median is 75, which means:\n\n(x5 + x6) / 2 = 75\n\nNow, let's correct the wrongly recorded score by replacing 90 with 60:\n\nx1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, 60\n\nTo find the corrected median, we need to rearrange the scores in ascending order:\n\nx1, x2, x3, x4, 60, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9\n\nSince we know the original median was 75, we can infer that 60 must be either x5 or x6. If 60 were x5, the median would be lower than 75, which is not possible. Therefore, 60 must be x6. So, the corrected scores in ascending order are:\n\nx1, x2, x3, x4, x5, 60, x7, x8, x9, x10\n\nNow we can find the corrected median:\n\n(x5 + 60) / 2 = corrected median\n\nWe know that the original median was 75, so:\n\n(x5 + x6) / 2 = 75\n(x5 + 90) / 2 = 75\nx5 + 90 = 150\nx5 = 60\n\nSo, the corrected median is:\n\n(60 + 60) / 2 = 120 / 2 = 60"
