    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct Latin squares of order 4 that can be generated by permuting the rows and columns of the original Latin square, we need to consider the possible permutations of the rows and columns separately.\n\nFor a 4x4 Latin square, there are 4! (4 factorial) ways to permute the rows, which is equal to 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24 permutations. Similarly, there are also 4! ways to permute the columns, which is also 24 permutations.\n\nHowever, we must be careful not to overcount the number of distinct Latin squares. Since the first row and first column can be considered fixed (as permuting them would only change the labels of the elements), we should only consider the permutations of the remaining 3 rows and 3 columns.\n\nSo, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to permute the remaining rows, which is equal to 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 permutations. Similarly, there are also 3! ways to permute the remaining columns, which is also 6 permutations.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct Latin squares of order 4 that can be generated by permuting the rows and columns of the original Latin square is 6 (row permutations) x 6 (column permutations) = 36 distinct Latin squares."
