    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (rainy day) on a single trial (day)\n- n is the total number of trials (days)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days) we want to find the probability for\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 7 (next 7 days)\n- k = 4 (exactly 4 rainy days)\n- p = 0.3 (probability of raining on any given day)\n\nFirst, let's calculate nCk (the number of combinations of choosing 4 rainy days from 7 days):\n\nnCk = 7! / (4!(7-4)!)\n= 7! / (4!3!)\n= (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((4*3*2*1)*(3*2*1))\n= (7*6*5) / (3*2*1)\n= 210\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 4) = (nCk) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n= 210 * (0.3)^4 * (1-0.3)^(7-4)\n= 210 * (0.3)^4 * (0.7)^3\n= 210 * 0.0081 * 0.343\nâ‰ˆ 0.197\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain for exactly 4 out of the next 7 days in the city is approximately 0.197 or 19.7%."
