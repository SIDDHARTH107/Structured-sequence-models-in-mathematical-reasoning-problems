    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p.\n\nIn this problem, we have a = 3 and p = 17 (since 17 is a prime number). According to Fermat's Little Theorem, we have:\n\n3^17 ≡ 3 (mod 17)\n\nSo, when 3^17 is divided by 17, the remainder is 3."
