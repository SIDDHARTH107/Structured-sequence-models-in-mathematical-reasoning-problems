The company has 100 units of raw materials available and wants to maximize their profits. \n\nProduct A requires 4 units of raw materials and sells for $10 per unit. Product B requires 6 units of raw materials and sells for $14 per unit.\n\nFormulate a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the company's profit and determine how many units of product A and product B the company should produce to achieve the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 10x + 14y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Raw material constraint: 4x + 6y ≤ 100 (since there are only 100 units of raw materials available)\n2. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (since we cannot produce a negative number of units)\n\nWe need to solve this linear programming problem to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the profit P.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region by graphing the constraint inequalities:\n\n1. 4x + 6y ≤ 100\nDivide by 2: 2x + 3y ≤ 50\ny ≤ (50 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. x ≥ 0\n3. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all the constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is the area bounded by the x-axis, y-axis, and the line y = (50 - 2x) / 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the corner points of the feasible region, which are the points where the constraints intersect:\n\n1. Intersection of x-axis and y = (50 - 2x) / 3: (0, 50/3)\n2. Intersection of y-axis and y = (50 - 2x) / 3: (25, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 10x + 14y at each of these corner points:\n\n1. P(0, 50/3) = 10(0) + 14(50/3) = 700/3 ≈ 233.33\n2. P(25, 0) = 10(25) + 14(0) = 250\n\nComparing the values of the objective function at these corner points, we find that the maximum profit is $250, which occurs when the company produces 25 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
