Write the encrypted message in rows of 4 letters. How many columns are there in the encrypted message?\"",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message 'SECRETMESSAGE' using a Transposition cipher with a key of '3142', we first need to write the message in rows of 4 letters, according to the key.\n\n1. Write the message in rows of 4 letters:\n\nS E C R\nE T M E\nS S A G\nE\n\n2. Rearrange the columns according to the key '3142':\n\nC R S E\nM E E T\nS A S S\nE\n\n3. Read the encrypted message by columns:\n\nCMSE RSAE ETSS E\n\n4. Count the number of columns in the encrypted message:\n\nThere are 4 columns in the encrypted message."
