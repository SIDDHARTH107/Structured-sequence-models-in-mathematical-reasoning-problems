    "message_2": "Assume for contradiction that for every nonzero section $s$ of $E$ over $X$, there exists a point $x \\in X$ such that $s(x) \\in \\mathrm{span}\\{s_1(x), s_2(x), s_3(x)\\}$. \n\nConsider the map $F: E \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ defined by $F_x(v) = (a_1, a_2, a_3)$, where $v = a_1s_1(x) + a_2s_2(x) + a_3s_3(x)$. This map is well-defined since $\\mathrm{span}\\{s_1(x), s_2(x), s_3(x)\\} = E_x$ for all $x \\in X$. Moreover, $F$ is continuous, as it is a linear combination of continuous functions.\n\nNow, consider the restriction of $F$ to the zero section $Z \\subset E$, which is a continuous map $F|_Z: Z \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$. Since $X$ is compact, so is $Z$. Thus, by the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, there exists a point $x_0 \\in Z$ such that $F|_Z(x_0) = (a_1, a_2, a_3)$ and $F|_Z(-x_0) = (-a_1, -a_2, -a_3)$. \n\nHowever, $-x_0 = x_0$ since $x_0 \\in Z$, and thus $F|_Z(x_0) = F|_Z(-x_0)$. This implies that $(a_1, a_2, a_3) = (-a_1, -a_2, -a_3)$, and so $a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 0$. Therefore, $F|_Z(x_0) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\nNow, consider the section $s = a_1s_1 + a_2s_2 + a_3s_3$. Since $a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 0$, we have $s = 0s_1 + 0s_2 + 0s_3 = 0$. This contradicts our assumption that for every nonzero section $s$ of $E$ over $X$, there exists a point $x \\in X$ such that $s(x) \\in \\mathrm{span}\\{s_1(x), s_2(x), s_3(x)\\}$. \n\nTherefore, there must exist a nonzero section $s$ of $E$ over $X$ such that $s(x) \\notin \\mathrm{span}\\{s_1(x), s_2(x), s_3(x)\\}$ for all $x \\in X$."
