    "message_1": "Consider the following scenario: \nJohn has 3 siblings, Sarah, David and Emily. \nIf Sarah is not studying for her exams, David and Emily also do not study. \nHowever, if Emily is studying, David studies as well. \nJohn knows that Sarah did not study, but he is not sure if Emily is studying or not. \n\nUsing non-monotonic logic, what can be inferred about whether or not David is studying?",
    "message_2": "Using non-monotonic logic, we can infer that it is more likely that David is not studying. Since we know that Sarah did not study, and the given information states that if Sarah is not studying, then David and Emily also do not study, it is reasonable to assume that David is not studying. However, since we are not sure if Emily is studying or not, we cannot definitively conclude that David is not studying."
