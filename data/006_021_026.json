    "message_1": "In a certain region, the probability of experiencing a major earthquake in any given year is 0.07. What is the probability of experiencing such an earthquake in the next 10 years in this region?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability is the probability of an event not occurring, which is 1 minus the probability of the event occurring.\n\nIn this case, the probability of not experiencing a major earthquake in any given year is 1 - 0.07 = 0.93.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of not experiencing a major earthquake for 10 consecutive years. Since each year is independent, we can multiply the probabilities together:\n\n0.93^10 ≈ 0.4782969\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of experiencing at least one major earthquake in the next 10 years. This is the complementary probability of not experiencing a major earthquake in 10 years:\n\n1 - 0.4782969 ≈ 0.5217031\n\nSo, the probability of experiencing a major earthquake in the next 10 years in this region is approximately 0.5217 or 52.17%."
