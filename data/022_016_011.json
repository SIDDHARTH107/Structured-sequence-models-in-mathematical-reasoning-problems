    "message_1": "Suppose that you have a closed disk in the complex plane of radius $3$. Let $f(z)$ be a holomorphic function such that $f(0)=-1$ and $f(1)=3i$. Use the Riemann mapping theorem to find a biholomorphic mapping of the disk onto itself that takes $0$ to $1$ and $1$ to $0$, and then use this to find $f(z)$.",
    "message_2": "Let D be the closed disk of radius 3 centered at the origin. We want to find a biholomorphic mapping φ of D onto itself such that φ(0) = 1 and φ(1) = 0. \n\nFirst, we will find a biholomorphic mapping ψ of D onto the unit disk D' centered at the origin such that ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(1) = a, where |a| < 1. To do this, we will use the Möbius transformation:\n\nψ(z) = (z - 1) / (3 - z).\n\nNow, ψ(0) = -1/3 and ψ(1) = 0. To map D' onto itself, we need to find a biholomorphic mapping ω of D' onto itself such that ω(-1/3) = 0 and ω(0) = 1. We can use another Möbius transformation:\n\nω(z) = (z + 1/3) / (1 - z/3).\n\nNow, ω(-1/3) = 0 and ω(0) = 1. To find the inverse of ω, we can solve for z in terms of ω(z):\n\nz = (3ω - 1) / (3 + ω).\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of ψ by solving for z in terms of ψ(z):\n\nz = (3ψ + 1) / (1 + ψ).\n\nFinally, we can find the biholomorphic mapping φ of D onto itself by composing the inverse of ψ with ω:\n\nφ(z) = (3ω - 1) / (3 + ω) = (3((z + 1/3) / (1 - z/3)) - 1) / (3 + (z + 1/3) / (1 - z/3)).\n\nNow, we have a biholomorphic mapping φ of D onto itself such that φ(0) = 1 and φ(1) = 0. To find the function f(z), we can use the following formula:\n\nf(z) = f(φ(z)).\n\nSince f(0) = -1 and f(1) = 3i, we can write:\n\nf(z) = -1 + (3i + 1)(φ(z)).\n\nNow, substituting the expression for φ(z) we found earlier:\n\nf(z) = -1 + (3i + 1)((3((z + 1/3) / (1 - z/3)) - 1) / (3 + (z + 1/3) / (1 - z/3))).\n\nThis is the desired holomorphic function f(z) that maps the closed disk D onto itself with f(0) = -1 and f(1) = 3i."
