    "message_2": "To find the minimum size of the vertex cover of G, we can use the fact that the size of the maximum matching in a graph is a lower bound for the size of the minimum vertex cover. In other words, the minimum vertex cover cannot be smaller than the maximum matching.\n\nA graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges must have at least one vertex with a degree of 4 or higher (by the Pigeonhole Principle). Let's consider the worst-case scenario, where the graph has a vertex with a degree of 4 and the remaining vertices have a degree of 2. In this case, the graph would look like a central vertex connected to 4 other vertices, and the remaining 2 vertices connected by an edge.\n\nIn this graph, the maximum matching would be 3 (one edge between the central vertex and one of the degree-2 vertices, and the edge between the two remaining degree-2 vertices). Therefore, the minimum size of the vertex cover of G cannot be smaller than 3.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find a vertex cover of size 3. If we select the central vertex and the two degree-2 vertices that are not connected to it, we can cover all 10 edges in the graph. Thus, the minimum size of the vertex cover of G is 3."
