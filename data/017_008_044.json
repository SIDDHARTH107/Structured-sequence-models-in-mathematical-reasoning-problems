    "message_2": "Let's first recall the definitions of the groups C8, Q8, and D4:\n\nC8: The cyclic group of order 8, generated by a single element g with g^8 = e (the identity element).\nQ8: The quaternion group of order 8, with elements {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} and relations i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1.\nD4: The dihedral group of order 8, representing the symmetries of a square. It can be generated by two elements r and s, with relations r^4 = s^2 = e and sr = r^3s.\n\nNow, let's consider the element a in G. Since G has order 8, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of a must divide 8. Thus, the possible orders of a are 1, 2, 4, or 8. However, we are given that a is not the identity element, so the order of a cannot be 1. \n\nIf the order of a is 8, then G is a cyclic group generated by a, and G is isomorphic to C8. \n\nIf the order of a is 4, then consider the subgroup H generated by a, i.e., H = {e, a, a^2, a^3}. Since H has order 4, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in H must divide 4. Thus, the possible orders of elements in H are 1 or 2. However, we know that a has order 4, so there must be an element of order 2 in H. Let b = a^2. Then, b^2 = a^4 = e. Now, G has an element of order 4 (a) and an element of order 2 (b). This is similar to the structure of D4, so G is isomorphic to D4.\n\nIf the order of a is 2, then there must be another element b in G such that b is not in the subgroup generated by a (otherwise, G would be a cyclic group of order 4). Since the order of a and b both divide 8, the possible orders of a and b are 1, 2, or 4. However, we know that a and b both have order 2. Now, consider the element c = ab. Since a and b have order 2, we have (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = e. Thus, c also has order 2. This is similar to the structure of Q8, so G is isomorphic to Q8.\n\nIn summary, depending on the order of the element a, G can be isomorphic to C8, D4, or Q8. To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we need more information about the structure of G or the properties of its elements."
