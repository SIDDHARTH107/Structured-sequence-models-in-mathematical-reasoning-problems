    "message_1": "In a centipede game, two players can either cooperate or defect in each round. If both players cooperate, each receives a payoff of 1. If one defects and the other cooperates, the defector receives a payoff of 2 and the cooperator receives a payoff of 0. If both players defect, each receives a payoff of 0. The game continues for 10 rounds. What is the payoff for each player if both players always cooperate throughout the game?",
    "message_2": "If both players always cooperate throughout the 10 rounds of the game, they will each receive a payoff of 1 in each round. Since there are 10 rounds, the total payoff for each player will be:\n\n1 (payoff per round) * 10 (number of rounds) = 10\n\nSo, if both players always cooperate throughout the game, each player will receive a total payoff of 10."
