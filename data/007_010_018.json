    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive number that satisfies these conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. However, for this simple case, we can also find the solution by inspection.\n\nLet the number be x. We have the following conditions:\n\n1. x ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. x ≡ 2 (mod 4)\n\nWe can start by listing the numbers that satisfy each condition:\n\n1. Numbers that give a remainder of 1 when divided by 3: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, ...\n2. Numbers that give a remainder of 2 when divided by 4: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, ...\n\nNow, we can look for the smallest number that appears in both lists. We can see that the smallest number that satisfies both conditions is 10.\n\nSo, the smallest possible positive number that satisfies these conditions is 10."
