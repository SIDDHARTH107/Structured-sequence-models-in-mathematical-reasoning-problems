    "message_2": "To find the radius and interval of convergence of the given power series, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of a series is less than 1, then the series converges. \n\nLet's apply the Ratio Test to the given power series:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{(x-3)^{n+1}}{(n+1)^3}}{\\frac{(x-3)^n}{n^3}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{n^3(x-3)}{(n+1)^3}\\right|$$\n\nNow, divide both the numerator and denominator by $n^3$:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-3)}{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^3}\\right|$$\n\nAs $n$ approaches infinity, the expression inside the limit becomes:\n\n$$|(x-3)|$$\n\nFor the series to converge, we need the limit to be less than 1:\n\n$$|(x-3)| < 1$$\n\nThis inequality represents the interval of convergence. To find the radius of convergence, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n$$-1 < (x-3) < 1$$\n\nAdding 3 to all parts of the inequality, we get:\n\n$$2 < x < 4$$\n\nThe radius of convergence is half the length of the interval, which is:\n\n$$R = \\frac{4-2}{2} = 1$$\n\nSo, the radius of convergence is 1, and the interval of convergence is $(2, 4)$. However, we need to check the endpoints to determine if they are included in the interval of convergence. \n\nFor $x=2$, the series becomes:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{n^3}$$\n\nThis is an alternating series, and since the terms decrease in magnitude and approach 0 as $n$ approaches infinity, the series converges by the Alternating Series Test. Therefore, the left endpoint is included in the interval of convergence.\n\nFor $x=4$, the series becomes:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3}$$\n\nThis is a p-series with $p=3 > 1$, so it converges by the p-Series Test. Therefore, the right endpoint is also included in the interval of convergence.\n\nThus, the radius of convergence is 1, and the interval of convergence is $[2, 4]$."
