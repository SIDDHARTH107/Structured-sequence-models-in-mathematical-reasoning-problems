    "message_1": "Let A = {3, 5, 7} and B = {5, 7, 9}. Find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B, and then find the complement of the symmetric difference. Finally, show that the symmetric difference of complement of A and complement of B is not equal to the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. In this case, the symmetric difference is:\n\nA Δ B = {3, 9}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. Since we don't have a specific universal set, we can assume it's the set of all integers. The complement of the symmetric difference is:\n\n(A Δ B)' = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, ...}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A and the complement of B:\n\nA' = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...}\nB' = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, ...}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the complements of A and B:\n\nA' Δ B' = {3, 9}\n\nAs we can see, the symmetric difference of the complements of A and B (A' Δ B' = {3, 9}) is not equal to the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B ((A Δ B)' = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, ...})."
