    "message_2": "The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation that is used to describe various physical phenomena, including fluid dynamics and flame propagation. The equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t + u∂u/∂x + ∂²u/∂x² + ∂⁴u/∂x⁴ = 0\n\nThe chaotic behavior of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation depends on the wave number (k) and the system size (L). For the interval [-π, π], the system size L = 2π.\n\nAccording to research, the minimum value of the wave number (k) for which the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation displays chaotic behavior is approximately k = 1.2. This value is obtained when the system size L is around 2π.\n\nSo, the minimum value of the wave number (k) for which the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation displays chaotic behavior on the interval [-π, π] is k ≈ 1.20."
