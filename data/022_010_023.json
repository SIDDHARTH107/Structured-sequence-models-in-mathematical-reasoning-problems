    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = (z+3)/(z^2-4z+3) valid in the annular region 1 < |z+1| < 2, we first factor the denominator:\n\nf(z) = (z+3)/((z-1)(z-3))\n\nNow, we perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = A/(z-1) + B/(z-3)\n\nTo find A and B, we clear the denominators:\n\n(z+3) = A(z-3) + B(z-1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by choosing appropriate values for z:\n\n1. z = 1: 4 = 2B => B = 2\n2. z = 3: 6 = 2A => A = 3\n\nSo, f(z) = 3/(z-1) + 2/(z-3).\n\nNow, we need to find the Laurent series expansion valid in the annular region 1 < |z+1| < 2. To do this, we will use the substitution w = z+1, so that z = w-1:\n\nf(w-1) = 3/(w-2) + 2/(w+1)\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion for each term:\n\n1. 3/(w-2) = 3/(1 - (1-w)) = 3(1/(1-(1-w))) = 3Σ((1-w)^n) for |1-w| < 1\n2. 2/(w+1) = 2/(2 - (1-w)) = (1/2)(1/(1-(1-w)/2)) = Σ((1-w)^n/2^n) for |(1-w)/2| < 1\n\nNow, we can combine these series:\n\nf(w-1) = Σ(3(1-w)^n) + Σ((1-w)^n/2^n)\n\nFinally, we substitute back z = w-1 to obtain the Laurent series expansion for f(z):\n\nf(z) = Σ(3(-z)^n) + Σ((-z)^n/2^n)\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion of f(z) = (z+3)/(z^2-4z+3) valid in the annular region 1 < |z+1| < 2."
