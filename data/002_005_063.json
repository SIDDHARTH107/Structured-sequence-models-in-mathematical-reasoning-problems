    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 12 cm, a width of 8 cm, and a height of 6 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal length (d) can be found using the formula:\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height of the rectangular prism.\n\nIn this case, l = 12 cm, w = 8 cm, and h = 6 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nd = √((12 cm)² + (8 cm)² + (6 cm)²)\nd = √(144 cm² + 64 cm² + 36 cm²)\nd = √(244 cm²)\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 15.62 cm."
