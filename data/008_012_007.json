    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4  5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 14 |\n    | 26 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (denoted as A^(-1)). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\nDeterminant of A = (2 * 5) - (3 * 4) = 10 - 12 = -2\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/determinant) * adjoint(A)\n\nThe adjoint of A is obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements:\n\nAdjoint(A) = |  5  -3 |\n                     | -4   2 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-2) * |  5  -3 |\n                          | -4   2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | -2.5  1.5 |\n              |  2    -1 |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = | -2.5  1.5 | * | 14 |\n        |  2    -1 |   | 26 |\n\nX = | (-2.5 * 14) + (1.5 * 26) |\n        |  (2 * 14) + (-1 * 26) |\n\nX = | -35 + 39 |\n        |  28 - 26 |\n\nX = | 4 |\n        | 2 |\n\nSo, the values of x and y are:\n\nx = 4\ny = 2"
