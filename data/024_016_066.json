Find the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ defined by\n\n$$T(X,Y)=g(X,Y)$$\n\nfor any vector fields $X$ and $Y$ on $M$. Compute $\\nabla_T Z$, where $Z$ is a vector field on $M$ such that $Z(p)=X(p)$ at the point $p\\in M$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$, we first note that $T$ is a $(0,2)$-tensor, since it takes two vector fields as input and returns a scalar. The covariant derivative of a $(0,2)$-tensor is given by\n\n$$\\nabla T(X,Y,Z) = X(T(Y,Z)) - T(\\nabla_X Y, Z) - T(Y, \\nabla_X Z),$$\n\nwhere $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are arbitrary vector fields on $M$. In our case, $T(X,Y) = g(X,Y)$, so we have\n\n$$\\nabla T(X,Y,Z) = X(g(Y,Z)) - g(\\nabla_X Y, Z) - g(Y, \\nabla_X Z).$$\n\nNow, we want to compute $\\nabla_T Z$. To do this, we need to evaluate the expression above for $Y = Z$. We have\n\n$$\\nabla T(X,Z,Z) = X(g(Z,Z)) - g(\\nabla_X Z, Z) - g(Z, \\nabla_X Z).$$\n\nSince $g(Z,Z)$ is a scalar function on $M$, we can use the product rule for covariant derivatives to rewrite the first term:\n\n$$X(g(Z,Z)) = g(\\nabla_X Z, Z) + g(Z, \\nabla_X Z).$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\nabla T(X,Z,Z)$, we get\n\n$$\\nabla T(X,Z,Z) = g(\\nabla_X Z, Z) + g(Z, \\nabla_X Z) - g(\\nabla_X Z, Z) - g(Z, \\nabla_X Z) = 0.$$\n\nThus, the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ evaluated at $Z$ is zero, i.e., $\\nabla_T Z = 0$."
