    "message_2": "1. A x B:\nThe Cartesian product A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. So, A x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}.\n\n2. A' x B':\nA' and B' represent the complements of sets A and B, respectively. To find A' x B', we first need to define the universal set U for both A and B. Since no universal set is provided, we cannot find the complements A' and B', and therefore cannot find A' x B'.\n\n3. (A' x B')':\nSince we cannot find A' x B' as explained above, we cannot find the complement of A' x B' either.\n\n4. A x B' ∪ A' x B:\nAs mentioned earlier, we cannot find the complements A' and B', so we cannot find A x B' and A' x B, and therefore cannot find their union."
