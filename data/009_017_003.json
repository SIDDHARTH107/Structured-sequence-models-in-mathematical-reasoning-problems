    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field intensity at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, Ampere's Law is represented as:\n\n∮ B • dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a cylindrical wire carrying a current, the magnetic field intensity (B) is symmetrical and circles around the wire. We can choose a circular loop with a radius of 2 cm (the distance we want to find the magnetic field intensity at) as our path for the line integral. In this case, the magnetic field (B) and the differential length element (dl) are parallel, so the dot product simplifies to B * dl.\n\nNow, let's consider the total current enclosed by the loop. Since the wire has a radius of 0.5 cm and our loop has a radius of 2 cm, the entire current of 2.5 A is enclosed by the loop.\n\nWe can rewrite Ampere's Law for our situation as:\n\nB * ∮ dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nSince B is constant along the circular loop, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nB * ∮ dl = B * (2πr) = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nNow, we can solve for B:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I_enclosed) / (2πr)\n\nWhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I_enclosed is the enclosed current (2.5 A), and r is the distance from the center of the wire (0.02 m).\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 2.5 A) / (2π * 0.02 m)\n\nB = (10^(-6) T * 2.5) / 0.02\n\nB = 0.0000025 T / 0.02\n\nB ≈ 0.000125 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field intensity at a distance of 2 cm from the center of the wire is approximately 0.000125 Tesla."
