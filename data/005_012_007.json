The sample mean height is 165 cm with a standard deviation of 5 cm. Find a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height.",
    "message_2": "To find a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean height (165 cm)\nZ = Z-score for a 95% confidence interval (1.96)\nσ = standard deviation of the sample (5 cm)\nn = sample size (50 students)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n = 5 / √50 ≈ 0.7071\n\nNow, we can find the margin of error (ME):\n\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * 0.7071 ≈ 1.3859\n\nFinally, we can calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\nCI = x̄ ± ME = 165 ± 1.3859\n\nLower limit = 165 - 1.3859 ≈ 163.6141 cm\nUpper limit = 165 + 1.3859 ≈ 166.3859 cm\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean height is approximately (163.61 cm, 166.39 cm)."
