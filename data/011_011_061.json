    "message_2": "To ensure that each box has at least 2 balls, we can first place 2 balls in each of the 5 boxes. This leaves us with 20 - (2 * 5) = 10 balls to distribute among the 5 boxes.\n\nNow, we can use the stars and bars method to find the number of ways to distribute the remaining 10 balls into the 5 boxes. The stars represent the balls, and the bars represent the divisions between the boxes.\n\nWe have 10 stars (balls) and need to place 4 bars to create 5 distinct boxes. We can think of this as choosing 4 positions for the bars among the 10 stars, which can be done in C(10+4-1, 4) ways, where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nC(13, 4) = 13! / (4! * (13 - 4)!) = 13! / (4! * 9!) = 715\n\nSo, there are 715 ways to distribute the 20 identical balls into the 5 distinct boxes such that each box has at least 2 balls."
