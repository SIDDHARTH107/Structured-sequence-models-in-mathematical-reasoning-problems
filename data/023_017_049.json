    "message_2": "To compute the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-|x|), we first need to define the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞\n\nFor f(x) = e^(-|x|), we have two cases:\n\n1. x ≥ 0: f(x) = e^(-x)\n2. x < 0: f(x) = e^(x)\n\nNow, we compute the Fourier transform for each case and sum them up:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx + ∫[e^(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the first integral is from 0 to ∞, and the second integral is from -∞ to 0.\n\nLet's compute the integrals:\n\nF1(k) = ∫[e^(-x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from 0 to ∞\nF1(k) = ∫[e^(-x(1 + 2πik))] dx, from 0 to ∞\n\nUsing the formula for the integral of an exponential function:\n\nF1(k) = [-1/(1 + 2πik)] * e^(-x(1 + 2πik)) | from 0 to ∞\nF1(k) = [-1/(1 + 2πik)] * (0 - 1)\nF1(k) = 1/(1 + 2πik)\n\nNow, let's compute the second integral:\n\nF2(k) = ∫[e^(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to 0\nF2(k) = ∫[e^(x(1 - 2πik))] dx, from -∞ to 0\n\nUsing the formula for the integral of an exponential function:\n\nF2(k) = [1/(1 - 2πik)] * e^(x(1 - 2πik)) | from -∞ to 0\nF2(k) = [1/(1 - 2πik)] * (1 - 0)\nF2(k) = 1/(1 - 2πik)\n\nNow, we sum up the two Fourier transforms:\n\nF(k) = F1(k) + F2(k) = 1/(1 + 2πik) + 1/(1 - 2πik)\n\nNow, we use the Fourier transform to solve the initial value problem for the one-dimensional heat equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = κ ∂^2u/∂x^2, u(x, 0) = f(x), u(-∞, t) = u(∞, t) = 0\n\nWe know that the solution to the heat equation can be represented as:\n\nu(x, t) = (1/√(4πκt)) * ∫[f(y) * e^(-((x-y)^2)/(4κt))] dy, from -∞ to ∞\n\nSince we have the Fourier transform of f(x), we can write the solution as:\n\nu(x, t) = (1/√(4πκt)) * ∫[F(k) * e^(2πiky) * e^(-((x-y)^2)/(4κt))] dy, from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we plug in the values for x, t, and κ:\n\nu(x, 1) = (1/√(4π)) * ∫[F(k) * e^(2πiky) * e^(-((x-y)^2)/4)] dy, from -∞ to ∞, for 0 ≤ x ≤ 5 and κ = 1\n\nTo find the solution for 0 ≤ x ≤ 5 and t = 1 with κ = 1, we need to compute the integral above for each value of x in the given range. This integral is quite complex and typically requires numerical methods to solve."
