    "message_2": "The logistic growth model is given by the formula:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) / P0 * e^(-r*t))\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, K is the carrying capacity, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in days.\n\nIn this problem, we have K = 5000, P0 = 1000, r = 0.05, and t = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(5) = 5000 / (1 + (5000 - 1000) / 1000 * e^(-0.05*5))\n\nP(5) = 5000 / (1 + 4 * e^(-0.25))\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of e^(-0.25) and then find P(5):\n\ne^(-0.25) ≈ 0.778800783\n\nP(5) = 5000 / (1 + 4 * 0.778800783)\n\nP(5) = 5000 / (1 + 3.115203132)\n\nP(5) = 5000 / 4.115203132\n\nP(5) ≈ 1214.897\n\nSo, after 5 days, the population of bacteria will be approximately 1215 individuals."
