    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm, we will start with an arbitrary vertex and then iteratively add the shortest edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside the tree.\n\n1. Start with vertex (0). The connected edges are (0,1) with weight 2, (0,3) with weight 4, and (0,4) with weight 4. Choose the edge with the smallest weight, (0,1) with weight 2.\n\nCurrent MST:\n```\n(0)------(1)\n```\nTotal weight: 2\n\n2. Now, we have vertices (0) and (1) in the MST. The connected edges are (1,4) with weight 1, (0,3) with weight 4, and (0,4) with weight 4.

Now, we have vertices (0), (1), and (4) in the MST. The connected edges are (4,3) with weight 3, (0,3) with weight 4, and (0,4) with weight 4.

All vertices are now included in the MST, so we are done.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is:\n```\n(0)------(1)\n         |\n         |1\n         |\n        (4)------(3)\n             3\n```\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 6."
