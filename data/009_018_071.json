The mass of the particle is 2 kg, and its initial position and velocity are $x_0 = 3$ meters and $v_0 = 0$ m/s, respectively. Find the position of the particle at time $t = 5$ seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the position of the particle at time $t = 5$ seconds, we first need to find the acceleration, then the velocity, and finally the position.\n\n1. Acceleration: We can find the acceleration using Newton's second law, $F = ma$. Since $F(x) = -kx^3$, we have:\n\n$$ma = -kx^3$$\n\n$$a = -\\frac{k}{m}x^3$$\n\nSince the mass $m = 2$ kg, we have:\n\n$$a = -\\frac{k}{2}x^3$$\n\n2. Velocity: To find the velocity, we need to integrate the acceleration with respect to time:\n\n$$v(t) = \\int a dt = \\int -\\frac{k}{2}x^3 dt$$\n\nHowever, we cannot directly integrate this expression, as it involves both x and t. To proceed, we need to express the acceleration as a function of time. We can do this by using the chain rule:\n\n$$\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{dv}{dx} \\cdot \\frac{dx}{dt}$$\n\nSince $\\frac{dx}{dt} = v$, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{dv}{dt} = -\\frac{k}{2}x^3 \\cdot v$$\n\nNow, we can separate variables and integrate:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{dv}{v} = -\\frac{k}{2} \\int x^3 dt$$\n\nWe don't have enough information to proceed further, as the constant k is unknown. The problem statement is incomplete, and we cannot find the position of the particle at time $t = 5$ seconds without more information."
