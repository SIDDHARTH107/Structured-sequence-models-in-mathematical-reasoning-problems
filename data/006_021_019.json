    "message_1": "In a particular region, the probability of a hurricane occurring in any given year is 0.05. What is the probability that a hurricane will occur in that region in the next two years?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a hurricane occurring in the next two years, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability is the probability of an event not occurring, which is 1 minus the probability of the event occurring.\n\nThe probability of a hurricane not occurring in any given year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nThe probability of a hurricane not occurring in two consecutive years is the product of the probabilities of a hurricane not occurring in each year: 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability of a hurricane occurring in the next two years by subtracting the probability of a hurricane not occurring in two consecutive years from 1: 1 - 0.9025 = 0.0975.\n\nSo, the probability that a hurricane will occur in that region in the next two years is 0.0975 or 9.75%."
