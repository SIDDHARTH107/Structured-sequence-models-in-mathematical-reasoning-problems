    "message_1": "What is the circumference of a circle whose diameter is 14 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π * diameter (d)\n\nGiven that the diameter (d) is 14 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π * 14 cm\n\nUsing the approximate value of π as 3.14, we get:\n\nC ≈ 3.14 * 14 cm\nC ≈ 43.96 cm\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle is approximately 43.96 cm."
