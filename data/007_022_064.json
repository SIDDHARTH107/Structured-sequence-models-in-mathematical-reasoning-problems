    "message_2": "To find the public key point, we need to multiply the base point G (generator point) of the elliptic curve by the private key d. The base point G is not given in the problem, so we need to find it first.\n\nTo find the base point G, we need to find a point on the elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 over the finite field F_17 that has a large order (ideally, a prime order). We can do this by trying different points on the curve and checking their orders.\n\nLet's find some points on the curve:\n\n1. For x = 0:\ny^2 = 0^3 + 7*0 + 10 = 10 (mod 17)\nThere is no y in F_17 that satisfies this equation.\n\n2. For x = 1:\ny^2 = 1^3 + 7*1 + 10 = 18 = 1 (mod 17)\ny = 1, 16 (mod 17)\nSo, we have two points: (1, 1) and (1, 16)\n\n3. For x = 2:\ny^2 = 2^3 + 7*2 + 10 = 30 = 13 (mod 17)\ny = 6, 11 (mod 17)\nSo, we have two points: (2, 6) and (2, 11)\n\nWe can continue this process to find more points on the curve, but let's check the orders of the points we have found so far:\n\n1. Point (1, 1):\n2*(1, 1) = (2, 11)\n3*(1, 1) = (1, 16)\n4*(1, 1) = (2, 6)\n5*(1, 1) = (1, 1)\nThe order of point (1, 1) is 5.\n\n2. Point (1, 16):\n2*(1, 16) = (2, 6)\n3*(1, 16) = (1, 1)\n4*(1, 16) = (2, 11)\n5*(1, 16) = (1, 16)\nThe order of point (1, 16) is 5.\n\n3. Point (2, 6):\n2*(2, 6) = (1, 1)\n3*(2, 6) = (2, 11)\n4*(2, 6) = (1, 16)\n5*(2, 6) = (2, 6)\nThe order of point (2, 6) is 5.\n\n4. Point (2, 11):\n2*(2, 11) = (1, 16)\n3*(2, 11) = (2, 6)\n4*(2, 11) = (1, 1)\n5*(2, 11) = (2, 11)\nThe order of point (2, 11) is 5.\n\nAll the points we found have an order of 5. Let's choose the point (1, 1) as the base point G.\n\nNow, we can find the public key point by multiplying the base point G by the private key d:\n\nPublic key point = d * G = 13 * (1, 1)\n\nWe can use the double-and-add method to compute this multiplication:\n\n1. 2*(1, 1) = (2, 11)\n2. 4*(1, 1) = 2*(2, 11) = (1, 16)\n3. 8*(1, 1) = 2*(1, 16) = (2, 6)\n4. 13*(1, 1) = 8*(1, 1) + 4*(1, 1) + 1*(1, 1) = (2, 6) + (1, 16) + (1, 1) = (2, 11) + (1, 1) = (1, 16)\n\nSo, the public key point that Alice will use in her elliptic curve cryptography scheme is (1, 16)."
