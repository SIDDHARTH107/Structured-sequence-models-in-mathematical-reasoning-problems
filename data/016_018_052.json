    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor dust, the initial segment is divided into 3 equal parts, and the middle part (1/3) is removed. This leaves 2 self-similar pieces (N = 2) and the scaling factor is 1/3 (r = 1/3).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) can be calculated as:\n\nD = log(2) / log(1/(1/3))\nD = log(2) / log(3)\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor dust with the given conditions is approximately 0.6309."
