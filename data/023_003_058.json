Find the general solution to the partial differential equation and the particular solution that satisfies the given boundary conditions.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using Fourier series, we first assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the PDE, we get:\n\nX(x)T''(t) = 4X''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we separate the variables by dividing both sides by 4X(x)T(t):\n\nT''(t)/T(t) = X''(x)/X(x) = -λ^2\n\nHere, λ^2 is the separation constant. We now have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ^2X(x) = 0\nT''(t) - 4λ^2T(t) = 0\n\nWe first solve the spatial ODE, X''(x) + λ^2X(x) = 0, with boundary conditions X(0) = 0 and X(1) = 0. This is an eigenvalue problem, and the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are:\n\nλ_n = nπ, n = 1, 2, 3, ...\nX_n(x) = sin(nπx)\n\nNow, we solve the temporal ODE, T''(t) - 4λ^2T(t) = 0, for each λ_n:\n\nT_n''(t) - 4n^2π^2T_n(t) = 0\n\nThe general solution for T_n(t) is:\n\nT_n(t) = A_n cos(2nπt) + B_n sin(2nπt)\n\nNow, we use the initial conditions u_t(x,0) = 0 and u(x,0) = sin(2πx) to find A_n and B_n:\n\nu_t(x,0) = X(x)T'(t) = X(x)(-2nπA_n sin(2nπt) + 2nπB_n cos(2nπt))\nSince u_t(x,0) = 0, we have B_n = 0.\n\nu(x,0) = X(x)T(t) = sin(2πx) = Σ(A_n sin(nπx) cos(2nπt))\nAt t = 0, cos(2nπt) = 1, so we have sin(2πx) = Σ(A_n sin(nπx))\n\nComparing the Fourier series, we find that A_2 = 1 and A_n = 0 for n ≠ 2. Thus, the particular solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = sin(2πx) cos(4πt)"
