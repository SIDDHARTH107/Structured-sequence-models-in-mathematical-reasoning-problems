    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall, and the base of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second. The ladder is 10 feet long and is initially 6 feet away from the wall. How fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the base of the ladder is 8 feet away from the wall?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. We are given that the ladder is 10 feet long, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2 = 100\n\nWe are also given that the base of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second, so dx/dt = 2. We want to find dy/dt when x = 8.\n\nDifferentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow plug in the given values and solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(8)(2) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nWhen x = 8, we can find y by plugging it into the Pythagorean theorem equation:\n\n8^2 + y^2 = 100\n64 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 36\ny = 6\n\nNow we can plug in y = 6:\n\n2(8)(2) + 2(6)(dy/dt) = 0\n32 + 12(dy/dt) = 0\n12(dy/dt) = -32\n(dy/dt) = -32/12 = -8/3\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 8/3 feet per second when the base of the ladder is 8 feet away from the wall."
