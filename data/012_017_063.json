    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex, and no two edges share a common vertex. In other words, a perfect matching pairs up all the vertices in the graph.\n\nFor a perfect matching to exist in a graph with 8 vertices, the graph must be connected, and each vertex must have an even degree (number of edges connected to it). This is because each vertex must be paired with another vertex, and if a vertex has an odd degree, it cannot be paired with another vertex without sharing an edge.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific connections between the vertices in the graph, we cannot determine whether a perfect matching exists or not. If you provide the connections between the vertices, we can analyze the graph and determine if a perfect matching exists and identify the set of edges that make up the perfect matching."
