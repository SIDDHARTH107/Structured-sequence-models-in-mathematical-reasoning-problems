    "message_2": "Since the total probability of all possible outcomes should equal 1, we can find the probability of the stock price decreasing by $5 by subtracting the probabilities of the other two outcomes from 1.\n\nProbability of a $10 increase: 0.3\nProbability of no change: 0.5\n\n1 - (0.3 + 0.5) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2\n\nThe probability that the stock price will decrease by $5 is 0.2 or 20%."
