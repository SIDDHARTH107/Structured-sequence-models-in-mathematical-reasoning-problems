    "message_2": "To find the x-intercept(s) of the polynomial equation y = x^3 - 4x^2 - 3x + 18, we need to set y to 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^3 - 4x^2 - 3x + 18\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding the exact roots can be challenging. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (18) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±9, and ±18.\n\nBy testing these possible rational roots, we find that x = 2 is a root:\n\n0 = (2)^3 - 4(2)^2 - 3(2) + 18\n0 = 8 - 16 - 6 + 18\n0 = 0\n\nSince x = 2 is a root, we can now perform synthetic division or polynomial long division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\nx^3 - 4x^2 - 3x + 18 = (x - 2)(x^2 - 2x - 9)\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the quadratic factor x^2 - 2x - 9. This does not factor easily, so we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -9:\n\nx = [2 ± sqrt((-2)^2 - 4(1)(-9))] / 2(1)\nx = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 36)] / 2\nx = [2 ± sqrt(40)] / 2\nx = [1 ± sqrt(10)]\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the polynomial equation y = x^3 - 4x^2 - 3x + 18 are x = 2, x = 1 + sqrt(10), and x = 1 - sqrt(10)."
