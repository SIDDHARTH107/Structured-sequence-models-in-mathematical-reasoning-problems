    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the tangent space at a generic point of the moduli space of smooth algebraic curves of genus $g=4$, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor $D$ on a smooth algebraic curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$,\n\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles only at the points of $D$, $K_C$ is the canonical divisor, and $\\deg(D)$ is the degree of the divisor $D$.\n\nNow, let's consider the space of holomorphic differentials on a curve of genus $g=4$. These differentials form a vector space, and their divisors are linearly equivalent to the canonical divisor $K_C$. By the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have:\n\n$l(K_C) - l(0) = \\deg(K_C) + 1 - g$.\n\nSince $l(0) = 1$, we get:\n\n$l(K_C) = \\deg(K_C) + 2 - g$.\n\nFor a curve of genus $g=4$, the degree of the canonical divisor is $\\deg(K_C) = 2g - 2 = 6$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$l(K_C) = 6 + 2 - 4 = 4$.\n\nThis means that the space of holomorphic differentials on a curve of genus $g=4$ has dimension 4. The tangent space at a generic point of the moduli space $M_4$ is isomorphic to the space of holomorphic differentials on the corresponding curve. Therefore, the dimension of the tangent space at a generic point of $M_4$ is 4."
