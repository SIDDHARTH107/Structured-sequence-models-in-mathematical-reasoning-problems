    "message_2": "To find the dominant frequency of the price fluctuations using Fourier analysis, we first need to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the given sequence. The DFT is given by:\n\nX(k) = Σ [x(n) * e^(-j * 2 * π * k * n / N)], where the summation is from n = 0 to N-1, x(n) is the sequence of stock prices, N is the number of data points (24 in this case), and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nOnce we have the DFT, we can find the magnitude of each frequency component and identify the dominant frequency by finding the maximum magnitude.\n\nHere's the DFT calculation for the given stock prices:\n\n1. Normalize the data by subtracting the mean from each data point. The mean is (200+220+...+180+200)/24 = 252.5. The normalized data is {-52.5, -32.5, -2.5, 7.5, -12.5, -22.5, -42.5, -22.5, -2.5, 17.5, 37.5, 57.5, 77.5, 97.5, 77.5, 67.5, 47.5, 27.5, 7.5, -12.5, -32.5, -52.5, -72.5, -52.5}.\n\n2. Compute the DFT for each frequency component (k = 0 to 11, since we only need to consider half of the data points due to symmetry):\n\nX(k) = Σ [(-52.5 - 32.5 * e^(-j * 2 * π * k * n / 24) + ... - 72.5 * e^(-j * 2 * π * k * 22 / 24) - 52.5 * e^(-j * 2 * π * k * 23 / 24))]\n\n3. Calculate the magnitude of each frequency component:\n\n|X(k)| = sqrt(Re(X(k))^2 + Im(X(k))^2)\n\n4. Identify the dominant frequency by finding the maximum magnitude:\n\nThe maximum magnitude occurs at k = 2.\n\n5. Calculate the dominant frequency in cycles per year:\n\nDominant frequency = k / (N/12) = 2 / (24/12) = 1 cycle per year.\n\nSo, the dominant frequency of the price fluctuations in the company's stock price is 1 cycle per year."
