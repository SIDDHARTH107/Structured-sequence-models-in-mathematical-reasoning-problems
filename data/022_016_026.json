Also suppose that $a$ is a point inside $D$, but not at the origin. Find the Riemann mapping $f: D \\to \\mathbb{D}$, where $\\mathbb{D}$ is the unit disk centered at the origin, such that $f(a) = 0$.",
    "message_2": "To find the Riemann mapping $f: D \\to \\mathbb{D}$, we can use the Schwarz Lemma and the Riemann Mapping Theorem. First, let's normalize the domain $D$ by mapping $a$ to the origin. Define a function $g: D \\to D'$ by $g(z) = z - a$, where $D'$ is the translated domain. Now, $g(a) = 0$ and $g(D)$ is simply connected.\n\nNext, we apply the Riemann Mapping Theorem, which states that there exists a unique bijective holomorphic function $h: D' \\to \\mathbb{D}$ such that $h(0) = 0$ and $h'(0) > 0$. \n\nNow, we want to find the Riemann mapping $f: D \\to \\mathbb{D}$ such that $f(a) = 0$. We can define $f$ as the composition of $g$ and $h$, i.e., $f(z) = h(g(z)) = h(z - a)$. This function $f$ maps $D$ to $\\mathbb{D}$ and satisfies $f(a) = h(g(a)) = h(0) = 0$. \n\nTo find the explicit form of $f$, we can use the Schwarz Lemma, which states that if $h$ is a holomorphic function on the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ such that $h(0) = 0$ and $|h(z)| < 1$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{D}$, then $|h(z)| \\leq |z|$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{D}$, and $|h'(0)| \\leq 1$. Moreover, if either $|h(z_0)| = |z_0|$ for some $z_0 \\neq 0$ or $|h'(0)| = 1$, then $h$ is a rotation, i.e., $h(z) = e^{i\\theta}z$ for some $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince $h$ is a bijective holomorphic function from $D'$ to $\\mathbb{D}$, it must satisfy the conditions of the Schwarz Lemma. Therefore, $h(z) = e^{i\\theta}z$ for some $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nFinally, the Riemann mapping $f: D \\to \\mathbb{D}$ is given by $f(z) = h(g(z)) = e^{i\\theta}(z - a)$."
