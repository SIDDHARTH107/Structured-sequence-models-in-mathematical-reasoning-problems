    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - x^3$, we first need to find the gradient of the function and set it equal to the zero vector. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla f(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = (2x - 3x^2, 2y)$.\n\nSetting the gradient equal to the zero vector, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$2x - 3x^2 = 0$,\n$2y = 0$.\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $y = 0$. Now, we need to solve the first equation for $x$. Factoring out $x$, we get:\n\n$x(2 - 3x) = 0$.\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for $x$: $x = 0$ and $x = \\frac{2}{3}$. Thus, we have two critical points: $(0, 0)$ and $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, 0\\right)$.\n\nNow, we need to classify these critical points. To do this, we will use the Hessian matrix, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives of $f$. The Hessian matrix is given by:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 - 6x & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the Hessian matrix at each critical point and analyze its eigenvalues to classify the critical points.\n\n1. At $(0, 0)$:\n\n$H(f)(0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are both positive, which means that the critical point $(0, 0)$ is a local minimum.\n\n2. At $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, 0\\right)$:\n\n$H(f)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, 0\\right) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are of opposite signs, which means that the critical point $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, 0\\right)$ is a saddle point.\n\nIn conclusion, the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - x^3$ has two critical points on $\\mathbb{R}^2$: a local minimum at $(0, 0)$ and a saddle point at $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, 0\\right)$."
