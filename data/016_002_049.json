    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is formed by adding a Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The length of the Koch curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength of Koch curve after nth iteration = (4^n * initial side length) / (3^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial side length is 2cm, and we want to find the length after the 5th iteration.\n\nLength of Koch curve after 5th iteration = (4^5 * 2) / (3^5) = (1024 * 2) / 243 = 2048 / 243 ≈ 8.43 cm\n\nSince the Koch snowflake has 3 sides, the total length of the Koch snowflake curve after the 5th iteration is:\n\nTotal length = 3 * Length of Koch curve after 5th iteration ≈ 3 * 8.43 cm ≈ 25.29 cm"
