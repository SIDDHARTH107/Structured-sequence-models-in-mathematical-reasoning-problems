    "message_2": "To find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, a = 6 cm (base) and b = 8 cm (height).\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nSubstitute the values of a and b:\n\nc² = (6 cm)² + (8 cm)²\nc² = 36 cm² + 64 cm²\nc² = 100 cm²\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = √(100 cm²)\nc = 10 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 10 cm."
