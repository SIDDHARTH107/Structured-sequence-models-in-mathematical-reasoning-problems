    "message_1": "Consider a closed, connected, and orientable surface $M$ of genus $g$. Let $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Morse function with $k$ critical points. Use Morse inequalities to prove that $k \\geq 2g$. For example, let $M$ be a torus, i.e., $g = 1$. What is the minimum number of critical points $k$ that a Morse function on the torus must have?",
    "message_2": "To prove that $k \\geq 2g$, we will use the Morse inequalities. The Morse inequalities relate the number of critical points of a Morse function to the Betti numbers of the manifold. The inequalities are given by:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{n} (-1)^i c_i \\geq \\sum_{i=0}^{n} (-1)^i b_i,\n$$\n\nwhere $c_i$ is the number of critical points of index $i$, $b_i$ is the $i$-th Betti number of the manifold, and $n$ is the dimension of the manifold. In our case, $M$ is a 2-dimensional surface, so $n = 2$.\n\nFor a closed, connected, and orientable surface of genus $g$, the Betti numbers are given by:\n\n$$\nb_0 = 1, \\quad b_1 = 2g, \\quad b_2 = 1.\n$$\n\nNow, we can apply the Morse inequalities:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{2} (-1)^i c_i \\geq \\sum_{i=0}^{2} (-1)^i b_i.\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\nc_0 - c_1 + c_2 \\geq 1 - 2g + 1.\n$$\n\nSince $M$ is connected, we know that $c_0 = 1$. Moreover, by Poincar√© duality, we have $c_2 = 1$. Therefore, the inequality becomes:\n\n$$\n1 - c_1 + 1 \\geq 2 - 2g.\n$$\n\nRearranging the inequality, we get:\n\n$$\nc_1 \\leq 2g - 2.\n$$\n\nNow, recall that $k = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$. Substituting the values of $c_0$ and $c_2$, we have:\n\n$$\nk = 1 + c_1 + 1.\n$$\n\nUsing the inequality we derived for $c_1$, we get:\n\n$$\nk \\geq 1 + (2g - 2) + 1 = 2g.\n$$\n\nThus, we have shown that $k \\geq 2g$ for a closed, connected, and orientable surface of genus $g$.\n\nFor the example of a torus, which has genus $g = 1$, the minimum number of critical points $k$ that a Morse function on the torus must have is:\n\n$$\nk \\geq 2(1) = 2.\n$$\n\nSo, a Morse function on the torus must have at least 2 critical points."
