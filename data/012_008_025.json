    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is planar or not, we can use the planarity test based on Euler's formula for planar graphs. Euler's formula states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (regions, including the outer region).\n\nWe can also use the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nwhich must hold for any simple, connected, planar graph.\n\nIn our case, we have V = 8 vertices and E = 13 edges. Let's check if the inequality holds:\n\n13 ≤ 3 * 8 - 6\n13 ≤ 24 - 6\n13 ≤ 18\n\nThe inequality holds, so the graph G might be planar. However, this is not a definitive test, so we need to try to redraw the graph without any edge crossings to confirm its planarity.\n\nAfter attempting to redraw the graph without edge crossings, we find that it is not possible to do so. Therefore, the graph G is not planar."
