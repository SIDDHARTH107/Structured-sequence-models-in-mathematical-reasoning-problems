    "message_1": "A student stands 50 meters away from a tall building. If the angle of elevation to the top of the building is 60 degrees, what is the height of the building to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (h), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the student to the building (50 meters).\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(60°) = h / 50\n\nTo find the height of the building, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 50:\n\nh = 50 * tan(60°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 60 degrees:\n\ntan(60°) ≈ 1.732\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into the equation:\n\nh ≈ 50 * 1.732\n\nh ≈ 86.6\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the building is approximately 87 meters."
