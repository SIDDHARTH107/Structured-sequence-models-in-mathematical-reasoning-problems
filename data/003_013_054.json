    "message_2": "To find the maximum height of the light beam on the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. We are given the angle of elevation (30 degrees) and the distance from the student to the building (10 meters). We can set up the following equation:\n\ntan(angle) = height / distance\n\nLet h be the height of the light beam on the building. Then,\n\ntan(30) = h / 10\n\nWe know that tan(30) = 1 / sqrt(3). So,\n\n1 / sqrt(3) = h / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh = 10 * (1 / sqrt(3))\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):\n\nh = 10 * (1 * sqrt(3) / (sqrt(3) * sqrt(3)))\n\nh = 10 * (sqrt(3) / 3)\n\nh ≈ 10 * (1.732 / 3)\n\nh ≈ 10 * 0.577\n\nh ≈ 5.77\n\nSo, the maximum height of the light beam on the building is approximately 5.77 meters."
