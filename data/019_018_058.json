    "message_2": "We will prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers using a proof by contradiction. We will assume that there are only finitely many prime numbers and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssume that there are only finitely many prime numbers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_n. Now, let's consider the number P, which is the product of all these prime numbers plus 1:\n\nP = (p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n) + 1\n\nNow, let's analyze the prime factors of P. Since P is one greater than the product of all the prime numbers, it cannot be divisible by any of the prime numbers in our list (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n). If we divide P by any of these prime numbers, there will always be a remainder of 1.\n\nThis means that either P is itself a prime number, or it has a prime factor that is not in our list of prime numbers. In either case, we have found a prime number that is not in our original list of prime numbers, which contradicts our assumption that there are only finitely many prime numbers.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there are only finitely many prime numbers must be false, and we conclude that there are infinitely many prime numbers."
