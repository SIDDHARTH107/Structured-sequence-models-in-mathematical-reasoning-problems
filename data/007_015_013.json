    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 100, we can start by testing different values of n.\n\nFirst, we need to find the smallest value of n for which 2^n - 1 > 100. We can do this by trial and error:\n\n2^1 - 1 = 1 (not greater than 100)\n2^2 - 1 = 3 (not greater than 100)\n2^3 - 1 = 7 (not greater than 100)\n...\n2^7 - 1 = 127 (greater than 100)\n\nSo, we have found that 2^7 - 1 = 127 is greater than 100. Now we need to check if 127 is a prime number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Let's check if 127 has any divisors other than 1 and 127:\n\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 are all prime numbers less than 100. None of these numbers divide 127. Therefore, 127 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 100 is 127."
