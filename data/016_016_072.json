    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a space-filling curve with a fractal dimension that can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere D is the fractal dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Gosper curve, each iteration replaces the original line segment with 7 new segments, so N = 7. The scaling factor S is the square root of 2, as each new segment is scaled down by a factor of √2.\n\nNow, we can calculate the fractal dimension:\n\nD = log(7) / log(√2) ≈ 2.0849625\n\nThe fractal dimension of the Gosper curve remains constant after each iteration, so after 4 iterations, the fractal dimension is still approximately 2.0849625."
