    "message_2": "A sphere inscribed in a cube touches the cube at the center of each face. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube.\n\nThe diameter of the sphere is 6 cm, so the radius (r) is half of that, which is 3 cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr^3.\n\nSubstitute the value of r into the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(3 cm)^3\nVolume = (4/3)π(27 cm^3)\nVolume = (4π(27))/3\nVolume = (108π)/3\nVolume = 36π cm^3\n\nThe volume of the sphere inscribed in a cube with an edge length of 6 cm is 36π cubic centimeters."
