    "message_2": "To find the rational points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - 3x + 2$, we will use the method of rational parametrization. Let's start by finding an initial rational point on the curve. By inspection, we can see that $(x, y) = (1, 0)$ is a rational point on the curve since $0^2 = 1^3 - 3(1) + 2$.\n\nNow, let's consider a line with rational slope $m$ passing through the point $(1, 0)$. The equation of this line can be written as $y = m(x - 1)$. We will find the other point of intersection between this line and the elliptic curve, and then use the group law on elliptic curves to find another rational point.\n\nSubstituting the line equation into the elliptic curve equation, we get:\n\n$(m(x - 1))^2 = x^3 - 3x + 2$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$m^2x^2 - 2m^2x + m^2 = x^3 - 3x + 2$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get a cubic equation in $x$:\n\n$x^3 - m^2x^2 + (2m^2 - 3)x + (m^2 - 2) = 0$\n\nSince we know that $x = 1$ is a solution (corresponding to the point $(1, 0)$), we can factor the cubic equation:\n\n$(x - 1)(x^2 - (m^2 - 1)x + (m^2 - 2)) = 0$\n\nNow, we want to find the other solution for $x$. Let's call this solution $x_2$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that:\n\n$x_2 = m^2 - 1$\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding $y$-coordinate by substituting $x_2$ into the line equation:\n\n$y_2 = m(x_2 - 1) = m(m^2 - 1 - 1) = m(m^2 - 2)$\n\nThus, the other point of intersection between the line and the elliptic curve is $(x_2, y_2) = (m^2 - 1, m(m^2 - 2))$. By the group law on elliptic curves, the sum of the points $(1, 0)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is another rational point on the curve. The sum is given by the reflection of the point $(x_2, y_2)$ across the x-axis, i.e., $(x_2, -y_2) = (m^2 - 1, -m(m^2 - 2))$.\n\nTherefore, for any rational number $m$, the point $(m^2 - 1, -m(m^2 - 2))$ is a rational point on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - 3x + 2$."
