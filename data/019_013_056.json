    "message_2": "A second-order formula with one free variable over a set with 3 elements can be represented as a formula that quantifies over predicates or relations, rather than individual elements of the set. Let's denote the set elements as {a, b, c} and the free variable as x.\n\nThere are 3 unary predicates (P, Q, R) that can be applied to the free variable x, resulting in 3 possible atomic formulas: P(x), Q(x), and R(x). Additionally, there are 3 binary predicates (S, T, U) that can be applied to any pair of elements from the set, resulting in 9 possible atomic formulas: S(a, b), S(a, c), S(b, c), T(a, b), T(a, c), T(b, c), U(a, b), U(a, c), and U(b, c).\n\nNow, we can combine these atomic formulas using logical connectives (¬, ∧, ∨, →, ↔) and quantifiers (∀, ∃). However, calculating the exact number of possible second-order formulas is a complex task, as it involves considering various combinations of connectives, quantifiers, and atomic formulas.\n\nA more straightforward approach to estimate the number of possible second-order formulas is to use the number of atomic formulas and apply the formula for the number of possible propositional formulas:\n\nNumber of possible formulas = (2^(2n + 1) - 1) / 3\n\nIn our case, n = 12 (3 unary predicates applied to x and 9 binary predicates applied to pairs of elements). Plugging this value into the formula:\n\nNumber of possible formulas ≈ (2^(25) - 1) / 3 ≈ 11,184,882\n\nThis is an estimation of the total number of possible second-order formulas with one free variable over a set with 3 elements. Note that this estimation may include some formulas that are equivalent or can be simplified, so the actual number of distinct formulas might be lower."
