    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern is a fractal created using an iterated function system (IFS) with four transformations. The scaling factor for each transformation is as follows:\n\n1. Transformation 1 (f1): Scaling factor = 0.01 (1%)\n2. Transformation 2 (f2): Scaling factor = 0.85 (85%)\n3. Transformation 3 (f3): Scaling factor = 0.2 (20%)\n4. Transformation 4 (f4): Scaling factor = 0.15 (15%)\n\nAfter each iteration, the fern's dimensions are scaled by the corresponding transformation's scaling factor. To find the overall scaling factor after 4 iterations, we need to multiply the scaling factors of each transformation:\n\nOverall scaling factor = f1 × f2 × f3 × f4\n= 0.01 × 0.85 × 0.2 × 0.15\n= 0.000255\n\nSo, after 4 iterations, the scaling factor of the Barnsley fern is 0.000255. Now, we can find the new dimensions of the fern:\n\nNew height = Original height × Scaling factor\n= 1 × 0.000255\n= 0.000255 units\n\nNew width = Original width × Scaling factor\n= 0.5 × 0.000255\n= 0.0001275 units\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the Barnsley fern has a height of 0.000255 units and a width of 0.0001275 units."
