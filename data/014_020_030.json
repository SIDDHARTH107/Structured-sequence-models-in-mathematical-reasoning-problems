    "message_1": "A Vigenere cipher is used to encrypt a message using a keyword of length 5. The keyword is repeated until it matches the length of the message. If the message is \"HELLO WORLD\" and the keyword is \"MATHS\", the encrypted message is \"JFUUK PMVUO\". \n\nIf an encrypted message \"YHXOQ FOEES\" was intercepted, and the keyword used to encrypt it was \"ALGEB\", what is the decrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Vigenere cipher, we need to reverse the encryption process. The Vigenere cipher works by shifting each letter in the message by the corresponding letter in the keyword. To decrypt, we need to shift each letter in the encrypted message back by the corresponding letter in the keyword.\n\nFirst, let's extend the keyword \"ALGEB\" to match the length of the encrypted message \"YHXOQ FOEES\". The extended keyword is \"ALGEB ALGEB\".\n\nNow, let's decrypt the message by shifting each letter in the encrypted message back by the corresponding letter in the extended keyword:\n\nY -> (Y - A) = X\nH -> (H - L) = B\nX -> (X - G) = S\nO -> (O - E) = J\nQ -> (Q - B) = O\n\nF -> (F - A) = E\nO -> (O - L) = C\nE -> (E - G) = C\nE -> (E - E) = A\nS -> (S - B) = Q\n\nThe decrypted message is \"XBSJO ECCAQ\"."
