The production process requires wood and labor, with the following requirements:\n\n- Standard chairs: 4 square feet of wood and 2 hours of labor\n- Rocking chairs: 6 square feet of wood and 3 hours of labor\n- Recliners: 10 square feet of wood and 4 hours of labor\n\nThe manufacturer has 100 square feet of wood and 36 hours of labor available. A standard chair sells for $50, a rocking chair for $75, and a recliner for $100.\n\nHow many chairs of each type should the manufacturer produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to set up a linear programming model. Let's define the variables:\n\nx1 = number of standard chairs\nx2 = number of rocking chairs\nx3 = number of recliners\n\nObjective function (maximize profit):\nP = 50x1 + 75x2 + 100x3\n\nConstraints (wood and labor):\n4x1 + 6x2 + 10x3 <= 100 (wood constraint)\n2x1 + 3x2 + 4x3 <= 36 (labor constraint)\n\nNon-negativity constraints:\nx1, x2, x3 >= 0\n\nNow we can solve the linear programming problem using the simplex method or any other linear programming solver.\n\nSolution:\nx1 = 6 (standard chairs)\nx2 = 6 (rocking chairs)\nx3 = 3 (recliners)\n\nThe manufacturer should produce 6 standard chairs, 6 rocking chairs, and 3 recliners to maximize profit. The maximum profit is $825."
