    "message_2": "To compute the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Chirikov-Taylor map, we first need to calculate the Jacobian matrix of the map. The Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\nJ(x_n, y_n) = | ∂x_(n+1)/∂x_n  ∂x_(n+1)/∂y_n |\n              | ∂y_(n+1)/∂x_n  ∂y_(n+1)/∂y_n |\n\nFor the given map, we have:\n\n∂x_(n+1)/∂x_n = 1\n∂x_(n+1)/∂y_n = 1\n∂y_(n+1)/∂x_n = k * cos(x_n)\n∂y_(n+1)/∂y_n = 1\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x_n, y_n) = | 1  1 |\n              | k*cos(x_n)  1 |\n\nNow, we need to compute the Lyapunov exponent. The maximum Lyapunov exponent is given by the limit:\n\nλ_max = lim (1/N) * Σ(log(||J(x_i, y_i)||)) as N -> ∞\n\nwhere ||J(x_i, y_i)|| is the norm of the Jacobian matrix at the point (x_i, y_i), and the sum is taken over N iterations of the map.\n\nTo compute the maximum Lyapunov exponent numerically, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Set initial conditions (x_0, y_0) = (0.4, 0.6) and k = 1.3.\n2. Iterate the map N times, computing the Jacobian matrix J(x_i, y_i) at each step.\n3. Calculate the norm of each Jacobian matrix, and sum the logarithms of the norms.\n4. Divide the sum by N.\n\nThe value of λ_max will depend on the number of iterations N used in the calculation. As N increases, the estimate of λ_max should converge to the true value. Note that calculating the Lyapunov exponent can be computationally intensive, and it may be necessary to use specialized numerical software or libraries to obtain an accurate result."
