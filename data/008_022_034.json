    "message_2": "To determine whether the system of linear equations is solvable or not, we first need to find the system matrix A and then calculate its condition number. The system matrix A is given by:\n\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 \\\\\n17 & 23\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nThe condition number of a matrix is defined as the ratio of the largest singular value to the smallest singular value. To find the singular values, we first need to calculate the matrix A^T * A:\n\nA^T * A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 17 \\\\\n3 & 23\n\\end{bmatrix} * \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 \\\\\n17 & 23\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n293 & 401 \\\\\n401 & 554\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvalues of A^T * A. Let's denote the eigenvalues as λ1 and λ2. To find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation:\n\n|A^T * A - λI| = 0\n\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n293 - λ & 401 \\\\\n401 & 554 - λ\n\\end{vmatrix} = (293 - λ)(554 - λ) - 401 * 401 = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n\nλ^2 - 847λ + 162062 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the eigenvalues:\n\nλ = (847 ± √(847^2 - 4 * 162062)) / 2\nλ1 ≈ 809.97\nλ2 ≈ 37.03\n\nThe singular values are the square roots of the eigenvalues:\n\nσ1 = √λ1 ≈ 28.46\nσ2 = √λ2 ≈ 6.08\n\nNow, we can calculate the condition number:\n\nCondition number = σ1 / σ2 ≈ 28.46 / 6.08 ≈ 4.68\n\nSince the condition number is not very large (typically, a condition number greater than 10^3 is considered large), the system of linear equations is considered well-conditioned and solvable."
