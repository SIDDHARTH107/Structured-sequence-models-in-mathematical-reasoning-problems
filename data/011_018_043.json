    "message_1": "Suppose you have a 49-card deck, consisting of 7 sets of 7 cards each. Two cards are considered a match if they are from the same set. If you draw 8 cards at random from the deck, what is the probability that you have a complete set of matches (i.e., all 7 cards from at least one set)?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of having a complete set of matches, we can use the concept of combinations. First, we need to find the total number of ways to draw 8 cards from a 49-card deck, which can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of cards and k is the number of cards drawn.\n\nTotal combinations = C(49, 8) = 49! / (8!(49-8)!) = 49! / (8!41!) = 122977956517698282\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable outcomes, which is drawing all 7 cards from one set and 1 card from another set. There are 7 sets, so there are 7 ways to choose the set with all 7 cards. Then, there are 6 sets left to choose the 1 extra card from, and 7 cards in each of those sets. So, there are 7 * 6 * 7 = 294 favorable outcomes.\n\nFinally, we can find the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of combinations:\n\nProbability = Favorable outcomes / Total combinations = 294 / 122977956517698282 â‰ˆ 2.39 * 10^(-6)\n\nSo, the probability of having a complete set of matches when drawing 8 cards from the 49-card deck is approximately 2.39 * 10^(-6) or 0.00000239."
