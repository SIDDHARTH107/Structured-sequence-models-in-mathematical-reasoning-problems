    "message_2": "We will use the Sylow theorems to show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nSince the order of G is 25, which is a prime power (25 = 5^2), G is a p-group for p = 5. Now, we apply the Sylow theorems.\n\nBy the first Sylow theorem, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup P of G. The order of P is 5, since 5 is the highest power of 5 that divides 25.\n\nBy the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, satisfies:\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides the order of G, which is 25.\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. If n_5 = 1, then there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal in G. In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 25, since there is a unique subgroup of order 5, and the order of G is a prime power.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when n_5 = 25. In this case, there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups in G. Let P and Q be two distinct Sylow 5-subgroups. Since the order of P and Q is 5, they are both cyclic, and we can denote their generators as p and q, respectively.\n\nThe intersection of P and Q is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. This is because the only common element between two distinct Sylow 5-subgroups can be the identity element, as their orders are prime.\n\nNow, consider the element pq, which is the product of the generators of P and Q. Since P and Q are normal in G (as they are the only subgroups of their respective orders), we have:\n\n(pq)^5 = p^5 * q^5 = e * e = e\n\nThis implies that the order of pq divides 5. Since P ∩ Q = {e}, the order of pq cannot be 1, so it must be 5. Therefore, the subgroup generated by pq, denoted by ⟨pq⟩, is also a Sylow 5-subgroup.\n\nNow, we claim that G is the internal direct product of P and Q, i.e., G is isomorphic to P × Q. To show this, we need to prove that:\n\n1. G = PQ, where PQ = {pq : p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}\n2. P ∩ Q = {e}\n\nWe already showed that P ∩ Q = {e}. Now, we need to show that G = PQ. Since |P| = 5 and |Q| = 5, we have:\n\n|PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 5 * 5 / 1 = 25\n\nSince |PQ| = |G|, we have G = PQ. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, and G is isomorphic to P × Q, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either a cyclic group of order 25 or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
