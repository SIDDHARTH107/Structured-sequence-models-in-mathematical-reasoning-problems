    "message_2": "To find the 2-torsion point Q, we need to find the point Q such that 2Q = P + P. Since P = (-1, 0), we can use the tangent method to find the sum of two points on an elliptic curve.\n\nThe tangent method states that if P = (x1, y1) and Q = (x2, y2) are two points on the elliptic curve, then the sum R = P + Q = (x3, y3) can be found using the following formulas:\n\nIf P â‰  Q:\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\nx3 = m^2 - x1 - x2\ny3 = m(x1 - x3) - y1\n\nIf P = Q:\nm = (3x1^2 + a) / (2y1), where a is the coefficient of the x term in the elliptic curve equation (in this case, a = -1)\nx3 = m^2 - 2x1\ny3 = m(x1 - x3) - y1\n\nSince we are looking for 2Q = P + P, we will use the second set of formulas with P = (-1, 0):\n\nm = (3(-1)^2 - 1) / (2 * 0)\n\nHowever, since y1 = 0, we have a division by zero in the formula for m. This means that the point P is actually a 2-torsion point itself. In other words, Q is the point at infinity, which is the identity element for the elliptic curve group.\n\nTherefore, the 2-torsion point Q on this curve is the point at infinity."
