    "message_2": "Let's find all groups of order 35, where 35 = 5 * 7, with 5 and 7 being distinct prime numbers.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_5, must divide 7 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility for n_5 is 1. Similarly, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_7, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 mod 7. The only possibility for n_7 is also 1.\n\nLet P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup and Q be the unique 7-Sylow subgroup. Since both P and Q are unique, they are both normal subgroups of the group G of order 35. Now, P has order 5 and Q has order 7. Since the orders of P and Q are prime, they are both cyclic groups. Let P = ⟨a⟩ and Q = ⟨b⟩, where a has order 5 and b has order 7.\n\nSince P and Q are normal in G, we can consider the product PQ, which is a subgroup of G. The order of PQ is |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q|. Since P and Q have relatively prime orders, their intersection is just the identity element, so |P ∩ Q| = 1. Thus, the order of PQ is (5)(7)/1 = 35.\n\nSince PQ is a subgroup of G with the same order as G, we have that PQ = G. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of P and Q. As a result, G is isomorphic to the external direct product of P and Q, which is the cyclic group of order 35, ⟨a⟩ × ⟨b⟩.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one group of order 35 up to isomorphism, which is the cyclic group of order 35, denoted by Z_35 or C_35."
