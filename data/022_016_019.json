    "message_1": "Suppose that you have a simply connected open set $U\\subset \\mathbb{C}$ that contains the closed unit disc $\\overline{\\mathbb{D}}=\\{z\\in \\mathbb{C}:|z|\\leq 1\\}$. Also suppose that $f:\\overline{\\mathbb{D}}\\to U$ is a biholomorphic function (one-to-one, analytic, and with a non-vanishing derivative on $\\overline{\\mathbb{D}}$). Find the image under $f$ of the points $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$ on the real axis.",
    "message_2": "Since $f$ is a biholomorphic function, it is a conformal map. We will use the Riemann Mapping Theorem to find the unique conformal map from the unit disc to $U$ that fixes the origin and has a positive real derivative at the origin.\n\nLet $g(z) = \\frac{f(z) - f(0)}{f'(0)}$. Then $g$ is a conformal map from the unit disc to $U$ that fixes the origin and has a derivative of 1 at the origin. By the Riemann Mapping Theorem, $g$ is unique up to a rotation. Since $f'(0) > 0$, $g$ is the unique conformal map from the unit disc to $U$ that fixes the origin and has a positive real derivative at the origin.\n\nNow, let $h(z) = \\frac{z - f(0)}{f'(0)}$. Then $h$ is the inverse of $g$, and it is also a conformal map from $U$ to the unit disc that fixes the origin and has a positive real derivative at the origin. By the Riemann Mapping Theorem, $h$ is unique up to a rotation.\n\nSince $f$ is biholomorphic, $f'(z) \\neq 0$ for all $z \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{D}}$. In particular, $f'(\\frac{1}{4}) \\neq 0$ and $f'(\\frac{3}{4}) \\neq 0$. Therefore, $f(\\frac{1}{4}) \\neq f(0)$ and $f(\\frac{3}{4}) \\neq f(0)$.\n\nNow, let $w_1 = f(\\frac{1}{4})$ and $w_2 = f(\\frac{3}{4})$. Then $h(w_1) = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $h(w_2) = \\frac{3}{4}$. Since $h$ is a conformal map from $U$ to the unit disc that fixes the origin and has a positive real derivative at the origin, it must map the real axis to the real axis. Therefore, $w_1$ and $w_2$ must lie on the real axis.\n\nTo find the exact values of $w_1$ and $w_2$, we can use the fact that $f$ is a conformal map from the unit disc to $U$ that fixes the origin and has a positive real derivative at the origin. This means that $f$ must map the real axis to the real axis. Therefore, $w_1 = f(\\frac{1}{4})$ and $w_2 = f(\\frac{3}{4})$ are the images of $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$ under $f$, respectively."
