Given the network diagram below, the cost of traveling from one junction to another as shown, and the demand at each location, what is the minimum cost of transportation?\n\n![network diagram](https://i.imgur.com/JyvU8y6.png)\n\n- The company wants to transport 100 units of goods from junction A to junction F, 50 units from junction B to junction E, and 80 units from junction C to junction D.\n- The cost of traveling on road AB is $10/unit of goods, on BC is $8/unit of goods, on CD is $10/unit of goods, on DE is $6/unit of goods, on CF is $12/unit of goods, and on BE and EF is $15/unit of goods. \n\nWhat is the minimum cost of transportation for the company?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of transportation, we need to determine the most cost-effective routes for each of the three shipments.\n\n1. For the 100 units from junction A to junction F:\n- Route A: A -> F, cost = 100 * $12 = $1200\n- Route B: A -> B -> E -> F, cost = 100 * ($10 + $15 + $15) = $4000\n- Route C: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F, cost = 100 * ($10 + $8 + $10 + $6 + $15) = $4900\nThe most cost-effective route is Route A with a cost of $1200.\n\n2. For the 50 units from junction B to junction E:\n- Route A: B -> E, cost = 50 * $15 = $750\n- Route B: B -> C -> D -> E, cost = 50 * ($8 + $10 + $6) = $1200\nThe most cost-effective route is Route A with a cost of $750.\n\n3. For the 80 units from junction C to junction D:\n- Route A: C -> D, cost = 80 * $10 = $800\n- Route B: C -> B -> A -> F -> E -> D, cost = 80 * ($8 + $10 + $12 + $15 + $6) = $4080\nThe most cost-effective route is Route A with a cost of $800.\n\nNow, we add up the costs of the most cost-effective routes for each shipment:\nMinimum cost = $1200 (A to F) + $750 (B to E) + $800 (C to D) = $2750\n\nThe minimum cost of transportation for the company is $2750."
