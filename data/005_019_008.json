    "message_1": "Suppose that a student's probability of passing a math test is 0.7 if they study, and 0.3 if they don't study. If the student studied for the current test and passed it, what is the probability that they will pass their next test without studying? Assume that their probability of passing the next test without studying depends only on whether they passed the current test or not.",
    "message_2": "The problem states that the probability of passing the next test without studying depends only on whether they passed the current test or not. However, it does not provide any information about how the probability changes based on the outcome of the current test. Therefore, we cannot determine the probability of the student passing their next test without studying based on the given information."
