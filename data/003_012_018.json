    "message_1": "A car is parked on a flat ground 30 meters away from the base of a tower. The angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower is 45째. What is the height of the tower to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tower, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 45째, and the distance from the car to the base of the tower is 30 meters. We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(45째) = height / 30\n\nSince the tangent of 45째 is 1:\n\n1 = height / 30\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 1 * 30\nheight = 30 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tower is approximately 30 meters."
