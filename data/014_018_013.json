    "message_1": "Suppose we have a substitution cipher in which each letter in the alphabet is replaced by another letter from the alphabet, and that the frequency of the letter \"e\" in the original plaintext is 10%. If an attacker intercepts a ciphertext message encrypted using this substitution cipher and observes that the frequency of the letter \"r\" in the ciphertext is 12%, what is the most likely letter that \"r\" corresponds to in the original plaintext, and what is the probability that this is the correct letter?",
    "message_2": "In a substitution cipher, the most likely letter that a ciphertext letter corresponds to in the plaintext is the one with the closest frequency in the plaintext. Since the frequency of \"e\" in the plaintext is 10% and the frequency of \"r\" in the ciphertext is 12%, it is most likely that \"r\" corresponds to \"e\" in the original plaintext.\n\nHowever, to determine the probability that this is the correct letter, we need to consider the frequencies of other letters in the plaintext and compare them to the frequency of \"r\" in the ciphertext. Unfortunately, without more information about the frequency distribution of other letters in the plaintext, we cannot accurately calculate the probability that \"r\" corresponds to \"e\" in the original plaintext."
