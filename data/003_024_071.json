    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector v onto u using trigonometry, we can use the following formula:\n\nproj_u(v) = (v • u / ||u||^2) * u\n\nwhere proj_u(v) is the projection of v onto u, v • u is the dot product of v and u, and ||u||^2 is the square of the magnitude of u.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of v and u:\n\nv • u = (3 * 2) + (7 * 1) = 6 + 7 = 13\n\nNext, let's find the square of the magnitude of u:\n\n||u||^2 = (2^2) + (1^2) = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nNow, we can find the projection of v onto u:\n\nproj_u(v) = (13 / 5) * u = (13/5) * (2, 1) = (26/5, 13/5)\n\nSo, the projection of vector v onto u is (26/5, 13/5)."
