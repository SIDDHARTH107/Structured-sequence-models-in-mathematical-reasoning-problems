    "message_2": "To find the degree of the Fano variety defined by the given system of equations, we need to determine the number of intersection points with a general linear space of complementary dimension. In this case, the Fano variety is a surface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, so we need to find the number of intersection points with a general line.\n\nLet's consider a general line in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ parametrized by $[x_1:x_2:x_3:x_4] = [t:s:u:v]$, where $t,s,u,v$ are parameters. Substituting this into the given system of equations, we get:\n\n$(t^3 + s^3 + u^3 + v^3) = 0$\n$(ts(t + s) + tu(t + u) + tv(t + v) + su(s + u) + sv(s + v) + uv(u + v)) = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the number of solutions $(t,s,u,v)$ to this system of equations. Since the first equation is a cubic equation, it has at most three solutions. The second equation is a quadratic equation in each variable, so it has at most two solutions for each variable. Therefore, the system of equations has at most 6 solutions.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the possibility of multiple intersection points. To do this, we can compute the resultant of the two equations with respect to each variable. After some calculations, we find that the resultant is non-zero, which implies that the intersection points are distinct.\n\nThus, the Fano variety defined by the given system of equations has degree 6."
