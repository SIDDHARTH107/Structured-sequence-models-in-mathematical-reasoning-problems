    "message_1": "A town currently has a population of 50,000 people, and the population is growing at a rate of 5% per year. Suppose that the city wants to maintain a steady population growth rate of 5% per year. How many people should the city add to its population each year? Use the differential equation for exponential growth to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To maintain a steady population growth rate of 5% per year, we can use the differential equation for exponential growth, which is given by:\n\ndP/dt = k * P\n\nwhere dP/dt is the rate of population growth, k is the growth rate (5% per year in this case), and P is the population.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the growth rate from percentage to decimal form:\n\nk = 5% = 0.05\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = 0.05 * P\n\nSince the current population is 50,000 people, we can substitute this value for P:\n\ndP/dt = 0.05 * 50,000\n\ndP/dt = 2,500\n\nSo, the city should add 2,500 people to its population each year to maintain a steady population growth rate of 5% per year."
