    "message_1": "In a Trust Game scenario, Player A starts with $10 and can choose to send any amount of money from $0-$10 to Player B. Player B will receive triple the amount sent by Player A and then decide how much, if any, to return to Player A. What is the optimal amount for Player A to send, assuming Player B will act rationally to maximize their own profit?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal amount for Player A to send, we need to consider the rational behavior of Player B. Since Player B wants to maximize their own profit, they will only return an amount that incentivizes Player A to send money in the first place. \n\nLet x be the amount sent by Player A. Then, Player B receives 3x. If Player B returns y dollars to Player A, Player A's final amount will be 10 - x + y, and Player B's final amount will be 3x - y.\n\nPlayer B will act rationally and maximize their profit, so they will choose a value of y that satisfies the following condition:\n\n3x - y > 0, which means y < 3x\n\nAt the same time, Player A wants to maximize their profit, so they will choose a value of x that satisfies the following condition:\n\n10 - x + y > 10, which means y > x\n\nCombining the two inequalities, we get:\n\nx < y < 3x\n\nSince Player B wants to maximize their profit, they will choose the smallest possible value of y that still incentivizes Player A to send money. In this case, y = x + ε, where ε is a very small positive number.\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal value of x that maximizes Player A's profit:\n\n10 - x + (x + ε) > 10\n\nx + ε > 0\n\nSince ε is a very small positive number, the optimal value of x is close to 0. However, sending $0 would not result in any profit for Player A. Therefore, the optimal amount for Player A to send is a very small positive amount, just enough to incentivize Player B to return a slightly larger amount and ensure both players make a profit."
