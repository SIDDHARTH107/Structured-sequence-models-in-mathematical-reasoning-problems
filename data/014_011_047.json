    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using a columnar transposition cipher with the key \"MATH\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the key \"MATH\" as the column headers.\n2. Arrange the message in rows under the columns of the key.\n3. Rearrange the columns in alphabetical order based on the key.\n\nHere's how it looks:\n\nOriginal arrangement:\nM | A | T | H\n-------------\nH | E | L | L\nO | W | O | R\nL | D | - | -\n\nRearranged in alphabetical order based on the key:\nA | H | M | T\n-------------\nE | L | H | L\nW | R | O | O\nD | - | L | -\n\n4. Read the message column by column from the rearranged table.\n\nThe encrypted message is: \"EWDLHRLLOO-\". The dash represents a blank space or padding that was added to complete the grid."
