    "message_2": "A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, the given system of linear equations does not have many zero elements, so it is not a sparse matrix. However, I can still help you solve the system of linear equations using other methods.\n\nWe can solve the system of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method. First, let's represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  3  4 | 11 |\n| 5 -6  3 |-5  |\n| 7  2 -8 | 3  |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows:\n\nR2 = R2 - (5/2)R1\nR3 = R3 - (7/2)R1\n\n|  2   3    4 |  11  |\n|  0 -15 -5/2 | -35  |\n|  0  -5/2 -18| -15  |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row:\n\nR3 = R3 - (1/3)R2\n\n|  2   3    4  |  11  |\n|  0 -15 -5/2  | -35  |\n|  0   0  -161/6| -5/3 |\n\nStep 3: Solve for z:\n\n-161z/6 = -5/3\nz = 5\n\nStep 4: Solve for y:\n\n-15y - 5(5)/2 = -35\n-15y - 25/2 = -35\ny = 3\n\nStep 5: Solve for x:\n\n2x + 3(3) + 4(5) = 11\n2x + 9 + 20 = 11\nx = -9\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -9, y = 3, and z = 5."
