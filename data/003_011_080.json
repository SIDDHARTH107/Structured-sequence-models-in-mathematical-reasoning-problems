    "message_1": "A bird is sitting on a tree branch at a height of 15 meters above the ground. A cat is standing 20 meters away from the tree. What is the shortest distance that the cat needs to walk to reach the bird? (Round your answer to the nearest meter)",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance between the cat and the bird, we can use the Pythagorean theorem since we have a right triangle with the tree as one side, the horizontal distance between the cat and the tree as another side, and the hypotenuse as the shortest distance between the cat and the bird.\n\nLet's denote the height of the tree branch as a = 15 meters, the horizontal distance between the cat and the tree as b = 20 meters, and the shortest distance between the cat and the bird as c.\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nc^2 = (15)^2 + (20)^2\nc^2 = 225 + 400\nc^2 = 625\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 625 to get the value of c:\n\nc = âˆš625\nc = 25\n\nSo, the shortest distance the cat needs to walk to reach the bird is approximately 25 meters."
