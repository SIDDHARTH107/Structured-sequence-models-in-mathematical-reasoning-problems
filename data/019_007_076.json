    "message_1": "Consider the following non-monotonic logic scenario: \n\nA person has a bird feeder in their backyard. They have always seen goldfinches eating from the feeder, so they assume that all birds that come to the feeder are goldfinches. However, one day they see a blue jay eating from the feeder. \n\nIf the person assumes that all birds that come to the feeder are goldfinches, how many birds would they expect to see eating from the feeder, including the blue jay?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot predict the exact number of birds the person would expect to see eating from the feeder, as this is a subjective expectation and not a mathematical problem. However, I can provide some insight into the logic.\n\nInitially, the person assumed that all birds that come to the feeder are goldfinches. After seeing a blue jay eating from the feeder, the person's assumption is proven incorrect. Therefore, the person should now expect to see at least two types of birds eating from the feeder: goldfinches and blue jays. The total number of birds they expect to see would depend on their personal observations and experiences with the bird feeder."
