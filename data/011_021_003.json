The distances between the cities are as follows:\n\nCity 1 to City 2: 10 km\nCity 1 to City 3: 15 km\nCity 1 to City 4: 20 km\nCity 1 to City 5: 25 km\nCity 2 to City 3: 35 km\nCity 2 to City 4: 30 km\nCity 2 to City 5: 20 km\nCity 3 to City 4: 18 km\nCity 3 to City 5: 30 km\nCity 4 to City 5: 25 km\n\nWhat is the shortest possible route that the salesman can take to visit all 5 cities and return to his starting point?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible route, we can use the brute force method by listing all possible permutations of the cities and calculating the total distance for each permutation. Since there are 5 cities, there will be 5! (5 factorial) permutations, which is equal to 120 permutations. However, since the salesman needs to return to his starting point, we can fix the starting city and calculate the permutations for the remaining 4 cities, which is 4!
