The company conducted a study to determine if there is a significant difference in the fuel efficiency of the three models. In the study, ten cars of each model were tested for fuel efficiency and the results were recorded. The fuel efficiency data (in miles per gallon, mpg) for the three car models are given in the table below: \n\n| Model A | Model B | Model C |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| 23      | 27      | 29      |\n| 25      | 28      | 30      |\n| 24      | 26      | 33      |\n| 22      | 27      | 31      |\n| 23      | 25      | 32      |\n| 24      | 26      | 30      |\n| 25      | 28      | 34      |\n| 22      | 29      | 31      |\n| 23      | 27      | 32      |\n| 24      | 26      | 33      |\n\nUsing Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), determine if there is a significant difference in the mean fuel efficiency among the three models at 5% significance level.",
    "message_2": "To perform an ANOVA test, we need to calculate the following values:\n\n1. Mean fuel efficiency for each model\n2. Grand mean (overall mean)\n3. Sum of Squares Within (SSW)\n4. Sum of Squares Between (SSB)\n5. Mean Square Within (MSW)\n6. Mean Square Between (MSB)\n7. F-statistic\n8. Compare F-statistic to the F-critical value\n\nLet's start by calculating the mean fuel efficiency for each model:\n\nModel A: (23+25+24+22+23+24+25+22+23+24)/10 = 235/10 = 23.5 mpg\nModel B: (27+28+26+27+25+26+28+29+27+26)/10 = 269/10 = 26.9 mpg\nModel C: (29+30+33+31+32+30+34+31+32+33)/10 = 315/10 = 31.5 mpg\n\nNow, let's calculate the grand mean:\n\nGrand mean = (23.5 + 26.9 + 31.5) / 3 = 81.9 / 3 = 27.3 mpg\n\nNext, we need to calculate the Sum of Squares Within (SSW):\n\nSSW = Σ(Σ(x_ij - mean_i)^2)\nwhere x_ij is the j-th observation in the i-th group and mean_i is the mean of the i-th group.\n\nFor Model A: Σ(23-23.5)^2 + (25-23.5)^2 + ... + (24-23.5)^2 = 14\nFor Model B: Σ(27-26.9)^2 + (28-26.9)^2 + ... + (26-26.9)^2 = 14\nFor Model C: Σ(29-31.5)^2 + (30-31.5)^2 + ... + (33-31.5)^2 = 38\n\nSSW = 14 + 14 + 38 = 66\n\nNow, let's calculate the Sum of Squares Between (SSB):\n\nSSB = n * Σ(mean_i - grand_mean)^2\nwhere n is the number of observations in each group.\n\nSSB = 10 * [(23.5-27.3)^2 + (26.9-27.3)^2 + (31.5-27.3)^2] = 10 * [14.44 + 0.16 + 17.64] = 324\n\nNow, we need to calculate the Mean Square Within (MSW) and Mean Square Between (MSB):\n\nMSW = SSW / (total number of observations - number of groups) = 66 / (30 - 3) = 66 / 27 = 2.444\nMSB = SSB / (number of groups - 1) = 324 / (3 - 1) = 324 / 2 = 162\n\nNow, let's calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF-statistic = MSB / MSW = 162 / 2.444 = 66.25\n\nNow, we need to compare the F-statistic to the F-critical value. We will use the F-distribution table with a 5% significance level, numerator degrees of freedom (number of groups - 1) = 2, and denominator degrees of freedom (total number of observations - number of groups) = 27.\n\nThe F-critical value for (2, 27) at 5% significance level is approximately 3.35.\n\nSince our F-statistic (66.25) is greater than the F-critical value (3.35), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the mean fuel efficiency among the three models. Therefore, there is a significant difference in the mean fuel efficiency among the three car models at a 5% significance level."
