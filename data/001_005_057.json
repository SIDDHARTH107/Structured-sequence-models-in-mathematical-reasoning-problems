    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 7, and c = -15. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(7) ± √((7)^2 - 4(2)(-15))) / 2(2)\n\nx = (-7 ± √(49 + 120)) / 4\n\nx = (-7 ± √169) / 4\n\nx = (-7 ± 13) / 4\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\n1) x = (-7 + 13) / 4\nx = 6 / 4\nx = 3 / 2\n\n2) x = (-7 - 13) / 4\nx = -20 / 4\nx = -5\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation 2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 0 are x = 3/2 and x = -5."
