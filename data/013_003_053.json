    "message_1": "In an ultimatum game, Player A has $100 to share with Player B. Player A must offer a split of the money, and Player B can either accept the offer or reject it. If Player B accepts, both players keep their agreed-upon amounts. If Player B rejects the offer, neither player gets any money. What is the highest possible amount Player A can offer to keep Player B from rejecting the offer, assuming Player B's cutoff point is $30?",
    "message_2": "If Player B's cutoff point is $30, that means Player B will reject any offer less than $30. To ensure that Player B accepts the offer and to maximize the amount Player A keeps, Player A should offer Player B exactly $30. This way, Player A will keep the remaining $70 ($100 - $30)."
