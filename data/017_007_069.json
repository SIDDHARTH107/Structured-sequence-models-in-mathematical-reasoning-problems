    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 6 with elements {e, a, b, c, d, f}. We know that e is the identity element. Since the order of G is 6, which is not a prime number, G is not a simple group. Therefore, G must have a non-trivial proper subgroup. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of G, so the possible orders for subgroups are 2 and 3.\n\nIf there is a subgroup of order 3, then there must be an element of order 3 in G. Let's assume a has order 3, so a^3 = e. Then the subgroup generated by a is {e, a, a^2}. Since G has 6 elements, there must be another element b not in this subgroup. Now, consider the element b^2. If b^2 is not in the subgroup generated by a, then we have 6 distinct elements: e, a, a^2, b, b^2, and ab. The group generated by these elements is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nNow, let's assume there is no element of order 3 in G. Then, every non-identity element must have order 2. In this case, the Cayley table must satisfy the property that the product of any non-identity element with itself is the identity element. The Cayley table for G would look like this:\n\n```\n   | e  a  b  c  d  f\n---+----------------\n e | e  a  b  c  d  f\n a | a  e  ?  ?  ?  ?\n b | b  ?  e  ?  ?  ?\n c | c  ?  ?  e  ?  ?\n d | d  ?  ?  ?  e  ?\n f | f  ?  ?  ?  ?  e\n```\n\nWe need to fill in the remaining entries while maintaining the group properties. Let's consider the product ab. It cannot be equal to e, a, or b since a and b have order 2. If ab = c, then ba = c as well (since both a and b have order 2). Similarly, if ab = d, then ba = d, and if ab = f, then ba = f. Without loss of generality, let's assume ab = c and ba = c. Then the Cayley table looks like this:\n\n```\n   | e  a  b  c  d  f\n---+----------------\n e | e  a  b  c  d  f\n a | a  e  c  b  ?  ?\n b | b  c  e  a  ?  ?\n c | c  b  a  e  ?  ?\n d | d  ?  ?  ?  e  ?\n f | f  ?  ?  ?  ?  e\n```\n\nNow, consider the product ad. It cannot be equal to e, a, or d. If ad = b, then da = b. If ad = c, then da = c, and if ad = f, then da = f. Without loss of generality, let's assume ad = b and da = b. Then the Cayley table looks like this:\n\n```\n   | e  a  b  c  d  f\n---+----------------\n e | e  a  b  c  d  f\n a | a  e  c  b  d  ?\n b | b  c  e  a  ?  ?\n c | c  b  a  e  ?  ?\n d | d  b  ?  ?  e  ?\n f | f  ?  ?  ?  ?  e\n```\n\nFinally, consider the product af. It cannot be equal to e, a, or f. If af = b, then fa = b. If af = c, then fa = c, and if af = d, then fa = d. Without loss of generality, let's assume af = b and fa = b. Then the Cayley table looks like this:\n\n```\n   | e  a  b  c  d  f\n---+----------------\n e | e  a  b  c  d  f\n a | a  e  c  b  d  f\n b | b  c  e  a  f  d\n c | c  b  a  e  ?  ?\n d | d  b  f  ?  e  a\n f | f  a  d  ?  b  e\n```\n\nNow, we can easily fill in the remaining entries:\n\n```\n   | e  a  b  c  d  f\n---+----------------\n e | e  a  b  c  d  f\n a | a  e  c  b  d  f\n b | b  c  e  a  f  d\n c | c  b  a  e  f  d\n d | d  b  f  c  e  a\n f | f  a  d  c  b  e\n```\n\nThis Cayley table represents the dihedral group D3. Therefore, if G is a group of order 6, it must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
