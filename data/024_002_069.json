    "message_1": "A student wants to determine the geodesics on the surface of a sphere with a radius of 5 cm. If one geodesic starts at the equator and ends at the North Pole, what is its length?",
    "message_2": "A geodesic on the surface of a sphere is the shortest path between two points on the sphere, which is a segment of a great circle. In this case, the geodesic starts at the equator and ends at the North Pole.\n\nThe angle between the equator and the North Pole is 90 degrees (1/4 of a full circle). To find the length of the geodesic, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = radius × angle (in radians)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n90 degrees × (π radians / 180 degrees) = (1/2)π radians\n\nNow, we can find the length of the geodesic:\n\nLength = 5 cm × (1/2)π radians ≈ 7.85 cm\n\nSo, the length of the geodesic from the equator to the North Pole on a sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 7.85 cm."
