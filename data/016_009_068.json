    "message_2": "The length of the Dragon curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * 2^n\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after the 10th iteration. So, n = 10.\n\nLength = 1 * 2^10\nLength = 1 * 1024\nLength = 1024 units\n\nSo, the length of the Dragon curve after the 10th iteration is 1024 units."
