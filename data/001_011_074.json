    "message_2": "To solve the equation (3/x) + (4/x^2) = 1/2, we first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator is x^2. \n\nNow, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:\n\n(3x/x^2) + (4/x^2) = 1/2\n\nNow, we can combine the fractions on the left side:\n\n(3x + 4)/x^2 = 1/2\n\nNext, we can cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions:\n\n2(3x + 4) = x^2\n\nNow, we distribute the 2 on the left side:\n\n6x + 8 = x^2\n\nNow, we move all the terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\nx^2 - 6x - 8 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 8)(x + 1) = 0\n\nNow, we can find the solutions for x:\n\nx - 8 = 0  or  x + 1 = 0\n\nx = 8  or  x = -1\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 8 and -1."
