    "message_1": "Let $M$ be a smooth manifold, and let $X$ be a smooth vector field on $M$ with components $X^1=2x$ and $X^2=x^2y$, where $(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2$ represents the coordinates of $M$. Given a smooth real-valued function $f$ on $M$ with $f(x,y)=x^3y+2x$, determine the Lie derivative $\\mathcal{L}_Xf(p)$ of $f$ with respect to $X$ at the point $p=(1,2)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative $\\mathcal{L}_Xf(p)$, we need to evaluate the action of the vector field $X$ on the function $f$. In local coordinates, this is given by the following expression:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_Xf = X^i \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i} = X^1 \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + X^2 \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}.$$\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (x^3y + 2x)}{\\partial x} = 3x^2y + 2,$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial (x^3y + 2x)}{\\partial y} = x^3.$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $X^1$, $X^2$, and the partial derivatives of $f$ into the formula for the Lie derivative:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_Xf = (2x) (3x^2y + 2) + (x^2y) (x^3) = 6x^3y + 4x^2 + x^5y.$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate the Lie derivative at the point $p = (1, 2)$:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_Xf(p) = 6(1)^3(2) + 4(1)^2 + (1)^5(2) = 12 + 4 + 2 = 18.$$\n\nThus, the Lie derivative $\\mathcal{L}_Xf(p)$ of $f$ with respect to $X$ at the point $p = (1, 2)$ is equal to $18$."
