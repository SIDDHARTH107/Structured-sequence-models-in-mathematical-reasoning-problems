    "message_1": "In a sealed-bid second-price auction, three bidders bid on a painting. Bidder A bids $1000, bidder B bids $800, and bidder C bids $1200. Who wins the painting and how much do they pay?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid second-price auction, the highest bidder wins the item, but they pay the second-highest bid price. In this case, Bidder C has the highest bid at $1200, so they win the painting. However, they will pay the second-highest bid, which is $1000 from Bidder A. So, Bidder C wins the painting and pays $1000."
