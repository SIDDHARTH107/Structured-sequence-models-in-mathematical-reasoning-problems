    "message_1": "An electromagnetic wave is traveling through a medium with refractive index $n=1.5$. If the wavelength of the wave is $\\lambda=500$ nm, what is its wave vector $k$ and frequency $\\omega$ in the medium? (Hint: Use the relation between wave vector, frequency, and wavelength: $k=2\\pi/\\lambda$, and the relation between frequency, velocity, and refractive index: $v=c/n$ with $c$ being the speed of light in vacuum).",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the wave vector $k$. We can use the relation $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$. Given that $\\lambda = 500$ nm, we can convert it to meters: $\\lambda = 500 \\times 10^{-9}$ m. Now, we can calculate $k$:\n\n$k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2\\pi}{500 \\times 10^{-9}\\text{ m}} = 12.566 \\times 10^6\\text{ m}^{-1}$\n\nNow, let's find the frequency $\\omega$. We know that the speed of light in vacuum is $c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s. The velocity of the wave in the medium is $v = c/n$, where $n = 1.5$ is the refractive index:\n\n$v = \\frac{c}{n} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^8\\text{ m/s}}{1.5} = 2 \\times 10^8\\text{ m/s}$\n\nThe relation between frequency, velocity, and wavelength is given by $v = \\lambda \\omega$. We can solve for $\\omega$:\n\n$\\omega = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^8\\text{ m/s}}{500 \\times 10^{-9}\\text{ m}} = 4 \\times 10^{14}\\text{ s}^{-1}$\n\nSo, the wave vector $k$ is $12.566 \\times 10^6\\text{ m}^{-1}$ and the frequency $\\omega$ is $4 \\times 10^{14}\\text{ s}^{-1}$."
