    "message_1": "In a certain school, 60% of the students pass their math exams, 25% fail, and the remaining 15% need to take a retest. If there are 500 students in the school, how many students need to take the retest?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of students who need to take a retest, we need to find 15% of the total number of students, which is 500.\n\nTo calculate 15% of 500, we can multiply 500 by 0.15:\n\n500 * 0.15 = 75\n\nSo, 75 students need to take a retest."
