    "message_2": "To solve this partial differential equation using Fourier series, we will first assume that the solution can be written as a product of functions of $x$ and $t$, i.e., $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) = 4X''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, we will separate the variables by dividing both sides by $4XT$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{4T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$\n\nHere, $-\\lambda$ is the separation constant. We now have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. $T''(t) = -4\\lambda T(t)$\n2. $X''(x) = -\\lambda X(x)$\n\nLet's solve the second equation first, with the boundary conditions $X(0) = X(\\pi) = 0$. This is an eigenvalue problem, and the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are given by:\n\n$\\lambda_n = n^2$ and $X_n(x) = \\sin(nx)$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\nNow, let's solve the first equation for each eigenvalue $\\lambda_n = n^2$. We have:\n\n$T_n''(t) = -4n^2 T_n(t)$\n\nThe general solution for this equation is:\n\n$T_n(t) = A_n \\cos(2nt) + B_n \\sin(2nt)$\n\nNow, we use the initial condition $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$. This gives us:\n\n$0 = X_n(x)T_n'(0) = 2nX_n(x)B_n$\n\nSince this must hold for all $x$, we have $B_n = 0$. Thus, the solution for $T_n(t)$ is:\n\n$T_n(t) = A_n \\cos(2nt)$\n\nNow, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(2x)$, which gives us:\n\n$\\sin(2x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(nx)$\n\nComparing the terms, we see that $A_2 = 1$ and $A_n = 0$ for $n \\neq 2$. Therefore, the solution to the PDE is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sin(2x) \\cos(4t)$"
