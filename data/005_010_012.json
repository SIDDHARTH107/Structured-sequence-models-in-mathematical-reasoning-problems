    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one part is defective, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability that none of the parts are defective. \n\nThe probability that a single part is not defective is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90. Since the parts are selected randomly and independently, the probability that all 5 parts are not defective is (0.90)^5 = 0.59049.\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability, which is the probability that at least one part is defective:\n\nP(at least one defective) = 1 - P(none defective) = 1 - 0.59049 = 0.40951\n\nSo, the probability that at least one part is defective is approximately 40.95%."
