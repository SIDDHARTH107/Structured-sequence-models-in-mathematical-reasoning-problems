    "message_1": "A Latin square of size 4 is a 4x4 grid filled with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, where each number appears exactly once in each row and each column. How many different Latin squares of size 4 can be constructed?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of different Latin squares of size 4, we can use the following method:\n\n1. The first row can be filled in any order, so there are 4! (4 factorial) ways to fill the first row. However, since the Latin square property is invariant under row and column permutations, we can fix the first row as (1, 2, 3, 4) without loss of generality.\n\n2. For the second row, there are 3 choices for the position of the number 1 (since it cannot be in the same column as the 1 in the first row). After placing the 1, there are 2 choices for the position of the number 2, and then the positions of the numbers 3 and 4 are determined. So there are 3! = 6 ways to fill the second row.\n\n3. For the third row, there are 2 choices for the position of the number 1 (since it cannot be in the same column as the 1 in the first or second row). After placing the 1, there are 2 possible ways to fill the remaining positions with the numbers 2, 3, and 4. So there are 2 ways to fill the third row.\n\n4. Once the first three rows are filled, the fourth row is determined, as each number must appear exactly once in each column.\n\nSo, the total number of different Latin squares of size 4 is 1 (for the fixed first row) × 6 (for the second row) × 2 (for the third row) = 12."
