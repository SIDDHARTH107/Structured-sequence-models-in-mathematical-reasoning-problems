    "message_2": "To determine the number of sheets in the covering space Y, we will use the fact that the order of the image of the fundamental group of Y under the induced homomorphism is equal to the number of sheets of the covering.\n\nLet's denote the fundamental group of Y by π(Y, y₀). The covering map p induces a homomorphism p*: π(Y, y₀) → π(X, x₀). Since the fundamental group of X is given by π(X, x₀) = ℤ/3ℤ, we know that the order of this group is 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the order of the image of π(Y, y₀) under the induced homomorphism p*. By the covering space theory, the image of p* is a subgroup of π(X, x₀). Since π(X, x₀) is a cyclic group of order 3, its subgroups can only be the trivial group {0} (order 1) or the whole group ℤ/3ℤ (order 3).\n\nIf the image of p* is the trivial group {0}, then the covering would be trivial, which means Y would be homeomorphic to X, and the number of sheets would be 1. However, this case is not possible because the fundamental group of Y would also be trivial, which contradicts the fact that the fundamental group of X is ℤ/3ℤ.\n\nTherefore, the image of p* must be the whole group ℤ/3ℤ, which means the order of the image is 3. Thus, the covering space Y has 3 sheets."
