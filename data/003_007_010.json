    "message_2": "To find the measure of the angle opposite the longest side (90 meters) using the law of cosines, we can use the formula:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite the longest side (c).\n\nIn this case, a = 50 meters, b = 70 meters, and c = 90 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ncos(C) = (50^2 + 70^2 - 90^2) / (2 * 50 * 70)\ncos(C) = (2500 + 4900 - 8100) / 7000\ncos(C) = (-700) / 7000\ncos(C) = -0.1\n\nNow, to find the angle C, we take the inverse cosine (arccos) of -0.1:\n\nC = arccos(-0.1)\nC â‰ˆ 95.57 degrees\n\nSo, the measure of the angle opposite the longest side is approximately 95.57 degrees."
