    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 35, we know that |G| = 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, a group of order p * q, where p and q are distinct prime numbers, is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders p and q.\n\nTo determine whether G is cyclic, we need to find an element of order 35 in G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 5, 7, and 35.\n\nLet's consider the Sylow subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup P of order 5 and a Sylow 7-subgroup Q of order 7 in G. Since 5 and 7 are prime, both P and Q are cyclic.\n\nNow, let's find the number of Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups in G. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 7 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility is n_7 = 1.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup, they are both normal in G. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, and we have G ≅ P × Q.\n\nSince P and Q are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
