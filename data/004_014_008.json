    "message_2": "To find the volume of the remaining solid, we need to subtract the volume of the cone from the volume of the cylinder. We can use integration to find the volume of the cone.\n\nLet's first find the volume of the cylinder using the formula V_cylinder = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nV_cylinder = π(5 cm)²(10 cm) = 250π cm³\n\nNow let's find the volume of the cone using integration. We can consider the cone as a collection of infinitesimally small disks with varying radii. Let x be the distance from the apex of the cone, and let R be the radius of the base of the cone. We can use similar triangles to find the radius of each disk at a given height x:\n\nr(x) = (x * R) / H\n\nwhere H is the height of the cone. In this case, R = 5 cm and H = 8 cm. So:\n\nr(x) = (5x) / 8\n\nThe volume of each infinitesimal disk can be expressed as:\n\ndV = π[r(x)]²dx\n\nNow we can integrate this expression from x = 0 to x = 8 to find the volume of the cone:\n\nV_cone = ∫[π(5x/8)²dx] from 0 to 8\nV_cone = (25π/64) ∫[x²dx] from 0 to 8\nV_cone = (25π/64) [(1/3)x³] from 0 to 8\nV_cone = (25π/64) [(1/3)(8³) - (1/3)(0³)]\nV_cone = (25π/64) [(1/3)(512)]\nV_cone = (25π/64) * (512/3)\nV_cone = 100π cm³\n\nNow we can find the volume of the remaining solid by subtracting the volume of the cone from the volume of the cylinder:\n\nV_remaining = V_cylinder - V_cone\nV_remaining = 250π cm³ - 100π cm³\nV_remaining = 150π cm³\n\nSo the volume of the remaining solid is 150π cm³."
