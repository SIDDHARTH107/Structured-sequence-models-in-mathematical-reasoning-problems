    "message_1": "Consider the algebraic curve C given by the equation:\n\nC: x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0 in the projective space P^2 over the field of complex numbers.\n\nLet L be the line in P^2 defined by the equations:\n\nL: x = t, y = 1-t, z = 0,\n\nand let P be the intersection of C with L. Find the tangent line to C at P.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection point P of the curve C and the line L. We can do this by substituting the parametric equations of L into the equation of C:\n\n(t^3) + (1-t)^3 + 0^3 = 0\n\nt^3 + (1 - 3t + 3t^2 - t^3) = 0\n\n2t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t - 1 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of t that satisfies this equation. Since this is a cubic equation, it has at least one real root. We can use the Rational Root Theorem to find a rational root if it exists. The only possible rational roots are ±1. We can test these values:\n\nt = 1: 2(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 + 3(1) - 1 = 1\nt = -1: 2(-1)^3 - 3(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 1 = -3\n\nNeither of these values satisfy the equation, so the root must be an irrational or complex number. We can use numerical methods (e.g., Newton's method) to find an approximate value for t, but for the purposes of this problem, we will denote the root as t = t₀.\n\nNow that we have the value of t₀, we can find the coordinates of the intersection point P:\n\nP = (t₀, 1 - t₀, 0)\n\nNext, we need to find the tangent line to C at P. To do this, we can compute the gradient of the curve C with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∇C = (3x^2, 3y^2, 3z^2)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the gradient at the point P:\n\n∇C(P) = (3(t₀)^2, 3(1 - t₀)^2, 0)\n\nThe tangent line to C at P will be orthogonal to the gradient vector at P. Since the tangent line lies in the plane z = 0, we can write its equation as:\n\nL_tangent: x = t₀ + λ(3(t₀)^2), y = 1 - t₀ + λ(3(1 - t₀)^2), z = 0\n\nwhere λ is a parameter.\n\nThus, the tangent line to the curve C at the intersection point P with the line L is given by the parametric equations:\n\nL_tangent: x = t₀ + λ(3(t₀)^2), y = 1 - t₀ + λ(3(1 - t₀)^2), z = 0"
