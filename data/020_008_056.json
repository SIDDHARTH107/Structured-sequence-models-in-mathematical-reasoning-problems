The cost matrix for this problem is given below:\n\n|          |Warehouse 1|Warehouse 2|Warehouse 3|Warehouse 4|Warehouse 5|\n|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|Warehouse 1| 0     | 12    | 23    | 17    | 11    |\n|Warehouse 2| 12    | 0     | 34    | 28    | 24    |\n|Warehouse 3| 23    | 34    | 0     | 41    | 31    |\n|Warehouse 4| 17    | 28    | 41    | 0     | 19    |\n|Warehouse 5| 11    | 24    | 31    | 19    | 0     |\n\nThe company wants to find the cheapest way to transport goods between its warehouses using network optimization. Determine the minimum cost and the corresponding transportation routes between the warehouses.",
    "message_2": "To find the most cost-effective way to transport goods between the five warehouses, we can use the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm. The MST algorithm will help us find the minimum cost to connect all warehouses without forming any cycles. One of the most common algorithms for finding the MST is Kruskal's algorithm.\n\nApplying Kruskal's algorithm to the given cost matrix:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n   (W1, W5) = 11\n   (W1, W2) = 12\n   (W4, W5) = 19\n   (W1, W4) = 17\n   (W2, W5) = 24\n   (W1, W3) = 23\n   (W2, W4) = 28\n   (W3, W5) = 31\n   (W2, W3) = 34\n   (W3, W4) = 41\n\n2. Start with an empty graph and add edges one by one in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle.\n\n   Add (W1, W5) = 11\n   Add (W1, W2) = 12\n   Add (W4, W5) = 19\n   Add (W1, W4) = 17\n   At this point, adding any more edges will create a cycle, so we stop.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is as follows:\n\n(W1, W5) = 11\n(W1, W2) = 12\n(W4, W5) = 19\n(W1, W4) = 17\n\nThe minimum cost to connect all warehouses is the sum of the edge weights in the MST:\n\n11 + 12 + 19 + 17 = 59\n\nThe corresponding transportation routes between the warehouses are:\n\nWarehouse 1 to Warehouse 5\nWarehouse 1 to Warehouse 2\nWarehouse 4 to Warehouse 5\nWarehouse 1 to Warehouse 4\n\nNote that Warehouse 3 is not directly connected to any other warehouse in the MST. However, it can be reached through other warehouses, such as Warehouse 1 or Warehouse 2, with the minimum cost."
