    "message_2": "Since A contains exactly 3 elements, the cardinality of A is 3. Now, let's determine the cardinality of its power set P(A). The power set of a set is the set of all possible subsets of the original set, including the empty set and the set itself.\n\nFor a set with n elements, the cardinality of its power set is 2^n. In this case, since A has 3 elements, the cardinality of P(A) is 2^3 = 8.\n\nNow, let's prove that the cardinality of P(A) is always greater than the cardinality of A. We have already found that the cardinality of A is 3 and the cardinality of P(A) is 8. Since 8 > 3, the cardinality of P(A) is greater than the cardinality of A.\n\nIn general, for a set with n elements, the cardinality of its power set is 2^n. Since 2^n is always greater than n for any positive integer n (as the function 2^n grows exponentially), the cardinality of the power set will always be greater than the cardinality of the original set."
