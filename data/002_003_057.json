    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and the surface area of a cube is given by the formula:\n\nSurface area = 6 * side^2\n\nIn this case, the surface area is 150 square centimeters:\n\n150 = 6 * side^2\n\nTo find the length of one side, we can first divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\n150 / 6 = side^2\n25 = side^2\n\nNow, we can take the square root of both sides to find the length of one side:\n\nside = âˆš25\nside = 5\n\nSo, the length of one side of the cube is 5 centimeters."
