    "message_1": "In a bag, there are 4 blue, 3 green, and 2 yellow balls. How many ways are there to arrange the balls in a line if no two green balls can be next to each other? (Hint: Use Polya's Enumeration Theorem)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can think of placing the green balls in the spaces between the other balls (blue and yellow). \n\nFirst, let's arrange the 4 blue and 2 yellow balls. There are 6!/(4!2!) ways to arrange them, which is equal to 15 ways.\n\nNow, we have 7 spaces between and around the blue and yellow balls where we can place the green balls (before the first ball, between the first and second ball, and so on, until after the last ball). We need to place 3 green balls in these 7 spaces, making sure that no two green balls are next to each other.\n\nWe can use the stars and bars method to count the number of ways to place the green balls. We have 3 green balls (stars) and we need to place them in 4 \"bins\" (spaces between blue and yellow balls). We can represent this as a sequence of stars and bars, where the bars separate the bins. For example, if we have the sequence \"|*|**||*\", it means we have placed 1 green ball in the first bin, 2 green balls in the second bin, 0 green balls in the third bin, and 1 green ball in the fourth bin.\n\nThere are a total of 3 stars and 3 bars, so we have 6 positions to fill. We can choose 3 of these positions for the bars, and the remaining positions will be filled by the stars. There are C(6,3) ways to do this, where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. \n\nC(6,3) = 6!/(3!3!) = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 ways to place the green balls in the spaces between the blue and yellow balls.\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the blue and yellow balls by the number of ways to place the green balls:\n\n15 * 20 = 300\n\nThere are 300 ways to arrange the balls in a line such that no two green balls are next to each other."
