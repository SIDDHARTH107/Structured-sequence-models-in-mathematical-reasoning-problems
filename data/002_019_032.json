    "message_1": "A cone has a height of 8 cm and a radius of 5 cm. What is the total surface area of the cone? (Round your answer to the nearest whole number.)",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of the cone, we need to find the lateral surface area and the base area, and then add them together.\n\nThe lateral surface area of a cone can be found using the formula: LSA = πr * l, where r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (l) using the Pythagorean theorem, since we have a right triangle formed by the height, radius, and slant height of the cone. The formula is: l^2 = h^2 + r^2\n\nGiven the height (h) = 8 cm and the radius (r) = 5 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nl^2 = 8^2 + 5^2\nl^2 = 64 + 25\nl^2 = 89\nl = √89\nl ≈ 9.43 cm\n\nNow we can find the lateral surface area (LSA):\n\nLSA = π * 5 * 9.43\nLSA ≈ 3.14159 * 5 * 9.43\nLSA ≈ 147.72 cm^2\n\nNext, we need to find the base area (BA) of the cone, which is a circle. The formula for the area of a circle is: BA = πr^2\n\nBA = 3.14159 * 5^2\nBA ≈ 3.14159 * 25\nBA ≈ 78.54 cm^2\n\nNow, we can find the total surface area (TSA) by adding the lateral surface area and the base area:\n\nTSA = LSA + BA\nTSA = 147.72 + 78.54\nTSA ≈ 226.26 cm^2\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the total surface area of the cone is approximately 226 cm^2."
