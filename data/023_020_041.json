    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we need to find the coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ. The formulas for these coefficients are:\n\na₀ = (1/π) ∫[f(x)dx] from -π to π\naₙ = (1/π) ∫[f(x)cos(nx)dx] from -π to π\nbₙ = (1/π) ∫[f(x)sin(nx)dx] from -π to π\n\nFirst, let's find a₀:\n\na₀ = (1/π) [∫(x dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(x^2 dx) from 0 to π]\n\na₀ = (1/π) [(x^2/2)|(-π to 0) + (x^3/3)|(0 to π)]\n\na₀ = (1/π) [(-π^2/2) + (π^3/3)]\n\na₀ = (1/π) (π^2/2 - π^3/3)\n\na₀ = (π/6)(3 - 2π)\n\nNow, let's find aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/π) [∫(x cos(nx) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(x^2 cos(nx) dx) from 0 to π]\n\nFor the first integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x, dv = cos(nx) dx\nThen du = dx, v = (1/n)sin(nx)\n\n∫(x cos(nx) dx) = (x/n)sin(nx) - (1/n)∫(sin(nx) dx) = (x/n)sin(nx) + (1/n^2)cos(nx)\n\nNow, evaluate the integral from -π to 0:\n\n[(x/n)sin(nx) + (1/n^2)cos(nx)](-π to 0) = (1/n^2)[cos(0) - cos(nπ)] = (1/n^2)[1 - (-1)^n]\n\nFor the second integral, we can use integration by parts twice:\n\nLet u = x^2, dv = cos(nx) dx\nThen du = 2x dx, v = (1/n)sin(nx)\n\n∫(x^2 cos(nx) dx) = (x^2/n)sin(nx) - (2/n)∫(x sin(nx) dx)\n\nNow, use integration by parts again for the remaining integral:\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\nThen du = dx, v = -(1/n)cos(nx)\n\n∫(x sin(nx) dx) = -(x/n)cos(nx) - (1/n)∫(-cos(nx) dx) = -(x/n)cos(nx) + (1/n^2)sin(nx)\n\nNow, evaluate the integral from 0 to π:\n\n[(x^2/n)sin(nx) - (2/n)(-(x/n)cos(nx) + (1/n^2)sin(nx))](0 to π) = (2/n^3)[(-1)^n - 1]\n\nNow, we can write aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/π)[(1/n^2)[1 - (-1)^n] + (2/n^3)[(-1)^n - 1]]\n\nNow, let's find bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) [∫(x sin(nx) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(x^2 sin(nx) dx) from 0 to π]\n\nWe have already calculated the first integral:\n\n∫(x sin(nx) dx) = -(x/n)cos(nx) + (1/n^2)sin(nx)\n\nNow, evaluate the integral from -π to 0:\n\n[(-(x/n)cos(nx) + (1/n^2)sin(nx)](-π to 0) = (π/n)cos(nπ) = (π/n)(-1)^n\n\nFor the second integral, we have already calculated it as well:\n\n∫(x^2 sin(nx) dx) = (x^2/n)sin(nx) - (2/n)(-(x/n)cos(nx) + (1/n^2)sin(nx))\n\nNow, evaluate the integral from 0 to π:\n\n[(x^2/n)sin(nx) - (2/n)(-(x/n)cos(nx) + (1/n^2)sin(nx))](0 to π) = (2/n^3)[1 - (-1)^n]\n\nNow, we can write bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/π)[(π/n)(-1)^n + (2/n^3)[1 - (-1)^n]]\n\nFinally, the Fourier series of the function f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) ≈ (π/6)(3 - 2π) + Σ[((1/π)[(1/n^2)[1 - (-1)^n] + (2/n^3)[(-1)^n - 1]])cos(nx) + ((1/π)[(π/n)(-1)^n + (2/n^3)[1 - (-1)^n]])sin(nx)]\n\nNow, let's evaluate the Fourier series approximation of the function at x = π/3:\n\nf(π/3) ≈ (π/6)(3 - 2π) + Σ[((1/π)[(1/n^2)[1 - (-1)^n] + (2/n^3)[(-1)^n - 1]])cos(n(π/3)) + ((1/π)[(π/n)(-1)^n + (2/n^3)[1 - (-1)^n]])sin(n(π/3))]\n\nTo get a good approximation, we can consider a finite number of terms in the series, say N terms. The more terms we consider, the better the approximation will be."
