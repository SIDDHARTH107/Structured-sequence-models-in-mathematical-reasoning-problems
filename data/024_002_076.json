    "message_2": "To find the geodesic curve on the surface `z = x^2 + y^2` that connects the points `(1, 0, 1)` and `(-1, 0, 1)`, we will use the geodesic equations derived from the Euler-Lagrange equations. \n\nFirst, we need to find the metric tensor components for the given surface. The surface can be parametrized as:\n\n`r(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)`\n\nwhere `x = u`, `y = v`, and `z = u^2 + v^2`. Now, we compute the first derivatives:\n\n`r_u = (1, 0, 2u)`\n`r_v = (0, 1, 2v)`\n\nNext, we compute the metric tensor components:\n\n`g_11 = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2`\n`g_22 = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2`\n`g_12 = g_21 = r_u • r_v = 0`\n\nThe geodesic equations are given by:\n\n`d^2u/ds^2 - Γ^1_ij * (du/ds)(dv/ds) = 0`\n`d^2v/ds^2 - Γ^2_ij * (du/ds)(dv/ds) = 0`\n\nwhere `Γ^k_ij` are the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, and `s` is the arc length parameter. The non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n\n`Γ^1_11 = ∂g_11/∂u / 2 = 4u`\n`Γ^2_22 = ∂g_22/∂v / 2 = 4v`\n\nNow, we have the geodesic equations:\n\n`d^2u/ds^2 - 4u(du/ds)^2 = 0`\n`d^2v/ds^2 - 4v(dv/ds)^2 = 0`\n\nTo solve these equations, we need to find the initial conditions. Since the geodesic curve connects the points `(1, 0, 1)` and `(-1, 0, 1)`, we have:\n\n`u(0) = 1, v(0) = 0`\n`u(L) = -1, v(L) = 0`\n\nwhere `L` is the total arc length of the geodesic curve. The geodesic equations become:\n\n`d^2u/ds^2 = 4u(du/ds)^2`\n`d^2v/ds^2 = 0`\n\nThe second equation implies that `v(s) = C`, where `C` is a constant. Since `v(0) = 0`, we have `v(s) = 0` for all `s`. This means that the geodesic curve lies in the plane `y = 0`.\n\nNow, we only need to solve the first equation for `u(s)`. Since `v(s) = 0`, the surface equation becomes `z = x^2`, and the geodesic curve is a straight line in the `xz`-plane. Thus, `u(s) = x(s) = 1 - 2s/L`. The geodesic curve is given by:\n\n`r(s) = (1 - 2s/L, 0, (1 - 2s/L)^2)`\n\nfor `0 <= s <= L`."
