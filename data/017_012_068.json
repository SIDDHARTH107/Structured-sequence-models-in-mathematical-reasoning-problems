    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems. Since the order of G is 16, which is 2^4, we know that G has a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16. By the Sylow theorems, the number of such subgroups, n_2, must divide the index [G:P], where P is a Sylow 2-subgroup, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The only possibility is n_2 = 1, which means that G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal.\n\nNow, let's consider the given subgroups H and K. Since H has order 4 and K has order 2, they are both subgroups of the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since H is a subgroup of order 4, it must be isomorphic to either C4 or C2 × C2 (the only two groups of order 4 up to isomorphism). Similarly, K must be isomorphic to C2, as it is the only group of order 2 up to isomorphism.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of G based on the structures of H and K:\n\n1. If H is isomorphic to C4, then G has an element of order 4. If G also has an element of order 8, then G would be cyclic of order 16, and thus isomorphic to C16. If G does not have an element of order 8, then G must have an element of order 2 that is not in H (since H has only one element of order 2). In this case, G is generated by an element of order 4 and an element of order 2, which gives the structure of the dihedral group D8.\n\n2. If H is isomorphic to C2 × C2, then G has no elements of order 4. In this case, G must be generated by elements of order 2, and since G has order 16, it must be a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C16, the dihedral group D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16, depending on the structures of H and K and the existence of elements of certain orders in G."
