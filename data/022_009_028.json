    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence for the given power series, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than 1, then the series converges. \n\nLet's denote the general term of the series as $a_n = \\frac{5^n z^n}{n^2}$. Then, we can find the ratio of consecutive terms:\n\n$$\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{\\frac{5^{n+1} z^{n+1}}{(n+1)^2}}{\\frac{5^n z^n}{n^2}} = \\frac{5^{n+1} z^{n+1} n^2}{5^n z^n (n+1)^2} = \\frac{5z n^2}{(n+1)^2}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the limit as n approaches infinity:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{5z n^2}{(n+1)^2}\\right|$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $n^2$:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{5z}{\\left(\\frac{n+1}{n}\\right)^2}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{5z}{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^2}\\right| = |5z|$$\n\nFor the series to converge, this limit must be less than 1:\n\n$$|5z| < 1$$\n\nNow, we can solve for the radius of convergence, R:\n\n$$|z| < \\frac{1}{5}$$\n\nSo, the radius of convergence for the given power series is R = $\\frac{1}{5}$."
