Find the angle between vector A and vector B using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between vector A and vector B, we can use the dot product formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of the two vectors, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, we need to find the components of the two vectors:\n\nVector A:\nAx = |A| cos(30°) = 5 * cos(30°) = 5 * (√3 / 2) = (5√3) / 2\nAy = |A| sin(30°) = 5 * sin(30°) = 5 * (1 / 2) = 5 / 2\n\nVector B:\nBx = |B| cos(60°) = 3 * cos(60°) = 3 * (1 / 2) = 3 / 2\nBy = |B| sin(60°) = 3 * sin(60°) = 3 * (√3 / 2) = (3√3) / 2\n\nNow, we can find the dot product of the two vectors:\n\nA · B = Ax * Bx + Ay * By = (5√3 / 2) * (3 / 2) + (5 / 2) * (3√3 / 2) = (15√3 / 4) + (15√3 / 4) = 15√3 / 2\n\nNow, we can use the dot product formula to find the angle between the two vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|) = (15√3 / 2) / (5 * 3) = (15√3 / 2) / 15 = √3 / 2\n\nθ = arccos(√3 / 2) = 30°\n\nThe angle between vector A and vector B is 30 degrees."
