    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by iteratively folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a right angle. The perimeter of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the perimeter is 2 units (the original line segment plus the new segment created by the fold).\n\nWith each subsequent iteration, the number of segments doubles, and the length of each segment remains the same (1 unit).\n\nSo, after the fourth iteration, there will be 2^4 = 16 segments, each with a length of 1 unit. Therefore, the perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after the fourth iteration is 16 units."
