    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are equal:\n\n1. Multiply the first equation by 1 (to keep it the same):\n   3x + 2y = 10\n\n2. Multiply the second equation by 2 (to make the coefficient of y equal to 2):\n   8x - 2y = 16\n\nNow, we will add both equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(3x + 2y) + (8x - 2y) = 10 + 16\n3x + 2y + 8x - 2y = 26\n11x = 26\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\n\nx = 26 / 11\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we will substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for y. We will use the first equation:\n\n3x + 2y = 10\n3(26/11) + 2y = 10\n\nMultiply both sides by 11 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n3(26) + 22y = 110\n78 + 22y = 110\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\n22y = 110 - 78\n22y = 32\ny = 32 / 22\ny = 16 / 11\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 26/11\ny = 16/11"
