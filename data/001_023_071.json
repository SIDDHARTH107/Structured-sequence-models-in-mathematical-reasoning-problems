    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2 sin(x) + 1 = 0 for values of x between 0 and 360 degrees, follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate sin(x) by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation and then dividing by 2:\n\n2 sin(x) + 1 - 1 = 0 - 1\n2 sin(x) = -1\nsin(x) = -1/2\n\n2. Now, we need to find the angles x for which sin(x) = -1/2. Since the sine function is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, we will find the reference angle in the first quadrant and then determine the angles in the third and fourth quadrants.\n\nThe reference angle for sin(x) = 1/2 is 30 degrees (or π/6 radians). Therefore, the angles in the third and fourth quadrants are:\n\nx = 180 + 30 = 210 degrees (or 7π/6 radians)\nx = 360 - 30 = 330 degrees (or 11π/6 radians)\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation 2 sin(x) + 1 = 0 between 0 and 360 degrees are x = 210 degrees and x = 330 degrees."
