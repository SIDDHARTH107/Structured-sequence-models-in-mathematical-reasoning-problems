    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of selecting k items from a set of n items, n! is the factorial of n (the product of all positive integers up to n), and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nIn this case, we want to select a committee of 4 people (k = 4) from a group of 10 people (n = 10). So, we will plug these values into the formula:\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n\nNow, we will calculate the factorials:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n(10-4)! = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720\n\nNow, we will plug these values back into the formula:\n\nC(10, 4) = 3,628,800 / (24 × 720)\n\nC(10, 4) = 3,628,800 / 17,280\n\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 different ways to select a committee of 4 people from a group of 10 people."
