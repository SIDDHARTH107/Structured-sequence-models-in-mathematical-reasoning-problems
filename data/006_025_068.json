    "message_1": "In a magic show, the probability that the magician will pull a rabbit out of a hat is 0.25, the probability that he will make a dove appear from thin air is 0.15, and the probability that he will produce a bouquet of flowers is 0.6. What is the probability that he will either pull a rabbit out of a hat or make a dove appear from thin air?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the magician will either pull a rabbit out of a hat or make a dove appear from thin air, we simply add the probabilities of these two events occurring:\n\nP(rabbit or dove) = P(rabbit) + P(dove) = 0.25 + 0.15 = 0.40\n\nSo, the probability that he will either pull a rabbit out of a hat or make a dove appear from thin air is 0.40 or 40%."
