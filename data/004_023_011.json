    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed by the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x in the interval [0, 2], we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting y = x^2 and y = 2x equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 2x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 - 2x = 0\nx(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, x = 0 and x = 2 are the points of intersection. These are also the limits of integration for our problem.\n\nNext, we need to find the area between the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval [0, 2]:\n\nArea = âˆ«(2x - x^2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nNow, we can integrate the function:\n\nArea = [x^2 - (1/3)x^3] evaluated from 0 to 2\n\nArea = (2^2 - (1/3)(2^3)) - (0^2 - (1/3)(0^3))\n\nArea = (4 - (8/3)) - 0\n\nArea = (12 - 8)/3\n\nArea = 4/3\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x in the interval [0, 2] is 4/3 square units."
