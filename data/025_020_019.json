    "message_2": "a) To show that X is a smooth projective variety, we need to check that the polynomial f(x, y, z, w) defines a smooth hypersurface in the projective space P^3. This means that the partial derivatives of f with respect to x, y, z, and w must not simultaneously vanish at any point on X.\n\nThe partial derivatives of f are:\n\n∂f/∂x = 4x^3 - 4xy^2 - 4xz^2 - 4xw^2\n∂f/∂y = 4y^3 - 4yx^2 - 4yz^2 - 4yw^2\n∂f/∂z = 4z^3 - 4zx^2 - 4zy^2 - 4zw^2\n∂f/∂w = 4w^3 - 4wx^2 - 4wy^2 - 4wz^2\n\nNow, suppose that there exists a point (x₀, y₀, z₀, w₀) on X such that all these partial derivatives vanish simultaneously. Then we have:\n\n4x₀^3 - 4x₀y₀^2 - 4x₀z₀^2 - 4x₀w₀^2 = 0\n4y₀^3 - 4y₀x₀^2 - 4y₀z₀^2 - 4y₀w₀^2 = 0\n4z₀^3 - 4z₀x₀^2 - 4z₀y₀^2 - 4z₀w₀^2 = 0\n4w₀^3 - 4w₀x₀^2 - 4w₀y₀^2 - 4w₀z₀^2 = 0\n\nDividing each equation by 4, we get:\n\nx₀(x₀^2 - y₀^2 - z₀^2 - w₀^2) = 0\ny₀(y₀^2 - x₀^2 - z₀^2 - w₀^2) = 0\nz₀(z₀^2 - x₀^2 - y₀^2 - w₀^2) = 0\nw₀(w₀^2 - x₀^2 - y₀^2 - z₀^2) = 0\n\nIf x₀ = 0, then the first equation implies y₀^2 = z₀^2 + w₀^2. Similarly, if y₀ = 0, then the second equation implies x₀^2 = z₀^2 + w₀^2. If both x₀ and y₀ are nonzero, then we can divide the first equation by x₀ and the second equation by y₀ to get:\n\nx₀^2 - y₀^2 - z₀^2 - w₀^2 = 0\ny₀^2 - x₀^2 - z₀^2 - w₀^2 = 0\n\nAdding these two equations, we get 2(x₀^2 - y₀^2) = 0, which implies x₀^2 = y₀^2. But then, the first equation becomes x₀^2 = z₀^2 + w₀^2, which is a contradiction since x₀ ≠ 0 and y₀ ≠ 0. Therefore, x₀ = y₀ = 0.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that z₀ = w₀ = 0. But this is a contradiction since (0, 0, 0, 0) is not a point in the projective space P^3. Hence, there is no point on X where all the partial derivatives simultaneously vanish, and X is a smooth projective variety.\n\nb) To compute the Hodge diamond of X, we can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, which states that for a smooth hypersurface X in P^n of degree d, we have:\n\nh^{p, q}(X) = h^{p, q}(P^n) for p + q < n - 1\nh^{p, q}(X) = h^{p, q}(P^n) + h^{p - 1, q - 1}(P^n) for p + q = n - 1\nh^{p, q}(X) = h^{p, q}(P^n) for p + q > n - 1\n\nIn our case, X is a smooth hypersurface in P^3 of degree 4. The Hodge diamond of P^3 is given by:\n\n1\n0 0\n1 0 1\n0 0 0\n1\n\nApplying the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we get the Hodge diamond of X as:\n\n1\n0 0\n1 0 1\n0 0 0\n1\n\nSo, the dimensions of the Hodge cohomology groups H^{p, q}(X) for p, q = 0, 1, 2, 3 are:\n\nH^{0, 0}(X) = 1\nH^{0, 1}(X) = H^{1, 0}(X) = 0\nH^{0, 2}(X) = H^{2, 0}(X) = H^{1, 1}(X) = 1\nH^{0, 3}(X) = H^{3, 0}(X) = H^{1, 2}(X) = H^{2, 1}(X) = 0\nH^{3, 1}(X) = H^{2, 2}(X) = H^{1, 3}(X) = 0\nH^{2, 3}(X) = H^{3, 2}(X) = 0\nH^{3, 3}(X) = 1"
