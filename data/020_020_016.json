    "message_1": "A company wants to design a cylindrical container that can hold exactly 500 cubic cm of liquid. The container is to be made out of a material that costs NT$2 per square cm for the bottom and top and NT$1 per square cm for the sides. What is the minimum cost of the material needed to make the container?",
    "message_2": "Let r be the radius of the base of the cylinder and h be its height. The volume of the cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h. We are given that the volume is 500 cubic cm, so:\n\nπr^2h = 500\n\nThe surface area of the cylinder consists of the top and bottom circles and the lateral surface. The area of each circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, and the lateral surface area is given by the formula A = 2πrh. The total surface area is the sum of these areas:\n\nTotal Surface Area = 2(πr^2) + 2πrh\n\nThe cost of the material for the bottom and top is NT$2 per square cm, and the cost for the sides is NT$1 per square cm. Therefore, the total cost C of the material is:\n\nC = 2(2πr^2) + 1(2πrh)\n\nTo minimize the cost, we need to find the values of r and h that minimize the cost function C. To do this, we can use the constraint given by the volume equation:\n\nh = 500 / (πr^2)\n\nNow substitute this expression for h into the cost function:\n\nC = 4πr^2 + 2πr(500 / (πr^2))\n\nSimplify the cost function:\n\nC = 4πr^2 + 1000/r\n\nTo minimize the cost function, we can take the derivative with respect to r and set it equal to 0:\n\ndC/dr = 8πr - 1000/r^2 = 0\n\nNow solve for r:\n\n8πr^3 = 1000\nr^3 = 1000 / (8π)\nr^3 ≈ 12.566\nr ≈ 2.326\n\nNow find the corresponding value of h using the volume constraint:\n\nh ≈ 500 / (π(2.326)^2)\nh ≈ 500 / 53.93\nh ≈ 9.271\n\nNow that we have the values of r and h that minimize the cost, we can find the minimum cost by plugging these values back into the cost function:\n\nC_min = 4π(2.326)^2 + 1000/2.326\nC_min ≈ 68.36 + 430.01\nC_min ≈ 498.37\n\nThe minimum cost of the material needed to make the container is approximately NT$498.37."
