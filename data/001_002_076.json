    "message_2": "To graph the equation y = 2x + 3 on a coordinate plane, we first need to identify the slope and the y-intercept.\n\nThe equation is in the slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nComparing the given equation with the slope-intercept form, we can see that:\n\nm = 2 (slope)\nb = 3 (y-intercept)\n\nNow, let's plot the graph:\n\n1. Start by plotting the y-intercept (0, 3) on the coordinate plane.\n2. From the y-intercept point, use the slope to find the next point. Since the slope is 2, this means that for every 1 unit increase in x, y will increase by 2 units. So, from the point (0, 3), move 1 unit to the right and 2 units up to find the next point (1, 5).\n3. Continue plotting points using the slope until you have enough points to draw a straight line.\n\nFinally, draw a straight line through the plotted points to complete the graph of the equation y = 2x + 3.\n\nIn summary, the slope of the line is 2 and the y-intercept is 3."
