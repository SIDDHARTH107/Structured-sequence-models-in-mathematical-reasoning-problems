    "message_2": "To find the projection of the ball's velocity onto the object's position, we need to break down the velocity vector into its horizontal and vertical components. Since the angle is given as 45 degrees, we can use trigonometry to find the components.\n\nThe horizontal component of the velocity (Vx) can be found using the cosine function:\n\nVx = V * cos(θ)\nVx = 20 m/s * cos(45°)\n\nThe vertical component of the velocity (Vy) can be found using the sine function:\n\nVy = V * sin(θ)\nVy = 20 m/s * sin(45°)\n\nNow, we need to find the angle between the object's position and the horizontal component of the velocity. Since the object is directly in front of the student, the angle between the object's position and the horizontal component of the velocity is 0 degrees.\n\nTo find the projection of the ball's velocity onto the object's position, we can use the dot product formula:\n\nProjection = |V| * |O| * cos(ϕ)\n\nwhere |V| is the magnitude of the velocity vector, |O| is the magnitude of the object's position vector, and ϕ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nSince the angle between the object's position and the horizontal component of the velocity is 0 degrees, the cosine of the angle is 1. The magnitude of the object's position vector is 10 meters.\n\nNow we can calculate the projection:\n\nProjection = |Vx| * |O| * cos(0°)\nProjection = Vx * 10 m\n\nFirst, we need to calculate Vx:\n\nVx = 20 m/s * cos(45°)\nVx ≈ 14.14 m/s\n\nNow we can calculate the projection:\n\nProjection = 14.14 m/s * 10 m\nProjection ≈ 141.4 m\n\nSo, the projection of the ball's velocity onto the object's position is approximately 141.4 m."
