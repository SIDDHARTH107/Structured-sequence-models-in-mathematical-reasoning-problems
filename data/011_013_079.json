    "message_2": "First, let's identify the vowels and consonants in the word \"COMBINATORICS\". There are 5 vowels (O, O, I, A, I) and 8 consonants (C, M, B, N, T, R, C, S).\n\nWe will first arrange the consonants, and then place the vowels in the gaps between them.\n\nThere are 8 consonants, so they can be arranged in 8! ways. However, we have two C's, so we need to divide by 2! to account for the repetition:\n\nConsonant arrangements = 8! / 2! = 20160\n\nNow, we have 9 possible gaps between the consonants where we can place the vowels (including the beginning and end of the sequence). We need to place 5 vowels in these gaps, so we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!]\n\nC(9, 5) = 9! / (5! * 4!) = 126\n\nHowever, we have two O's and two I's among the vowels, so we need to account for the repetitions:\n\nVowel arrangements = 126 / (2! * 2!) = 31.5\n\nSince we cannot have half an arrangement, it seems we made an error in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and find the mistake.\n\nWhen we calculated the consonant arrangements, we divided by 2! to account for the repetition of the letter C. However, we should have also considered the repetition of the vowels when calculating the vowel arrangements. So, let's correct that.\n\nThere are 5 vowels, so they can be arranged in 5! ways. However, we have two O's and two I's, so we need to divide by 2! for each repetition:\n\nVowel arrangements = 5! / (2! * 2!) = 30\n\nNow, we can multiply the consonant arrangements by the vowel arrangements to get the total number of ways the letters can be arranged such that no two vowels are adjacent:\n\nTotal arrangements = Consonant arrangements * Vowel arrangements = 20160 * 30 = 604800\n\nSo, there are 604,800 ways to arrange the letters of the word \"COMBINATORICS\" such that no two vowels are adjacent to each other."
