    "message_2": "To find the transfer function of the given control system, we first need to take the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. The Fourier transform of a time-domain function is defined as:\n\nF{f(t)} = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere F{f(t)} is the Fourier transform of f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1).\n\nLet's denote the Fourier transform of y(t) as Y(ω) and the Fourier transform of u(t) as U(ω). Then, we can take the Fourier transform of the given differential equation:\n\nF{y''(t) + 4y'(t) + 3y(t)} = F{u(t)}\n\nUsing the properties of the Fourier transform, we can rewrite this as:\n\nF{y''(t)} + 4F{y'(t)} + 3F{y(t)} = U(ω)\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transforms of y''(t) and y'(t). The Fourier transform of the derivative of a function is given by:\n\nF{f'(t)} = jωF{f(t)}\n\nApplying this property to y'(t) and y''(t):\n\nF{y'(t)} = jωY(ω)\nF{y''(t)} = jωF{y'(t)} = (jω)^2Y(ω) = -ω^2Y(ω)\n\nSubstitute these back into the equation:\n\n(-ω^2Y(ω)) + 4(jωY(ω)) + 3Y(ω) = U(ω)\n\nNow, we can solve for the transfer function, which is defined as the ratio of the output to the input in the frequency domain:\n\nTransfer function, G(ω) = Y(ω) / U(ω)\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = U(ω) / (-ω^2 + 4jω + 3)\n\nSo, the transfer function G(ω) is:\n\nG(ω) = 1 / (-ω^2 + 4jω + 3)"
