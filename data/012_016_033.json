    "message_2": "The Tutte polynomial of a graph G, denoted as T_G(x, y), is a polynomial in two variables x and y that encodes various properties of the graph. It is defined as:\n\nT_G(x, y) = sum_{A ⊆ E(G)} (x-1)^(k(A) - k(G)) * (y-1)^(|A| - k(A))\n\nwhere A is a subset of the edges of G, k(A) is the number of connected components in the subgraph induced by A, k(G) is the number of connected components in G, and |A| is the number of edges in A.\n\nFor the given graph:\n\n```\nA --- B\n|     |\nC --- D\n```\n\nThere are 4 vertices and 4 edges. The graph is connected, so k(G) = 1. We will now consider all possible subsets of edges and calculate the corresponding terms in the Tutte polynomial.\n\n1. No edges (A = ∅):\n   k(A) = 4 (each vertex is a separate component)\n   |A| = 0\n   Term: (x-1)^(4-1) * (y-1)^(0-4) = (x-1)^3\n\n2. One edge (A = {AB}, {AC}, {BD}, {CD}):\n   k(A) = 3 (three connected components)\n   |A| = 1\n   Term: 4 * (x-1)^(3-1) * (y-1)^(1-3) = 4(x-1)^2(y-1)^(-2)\n\n3. Two edges (A = {AB, AC}, {AB, BD}, {AC, CD}, {BD, CD}):\n   k(A) = 2 (two connected components)\n   |A| = 2\n   Term: 4 * (x-1)^(2-1) * (y-1)^(2-2) = 4(x-1)\n\n4. Three edges (A = {AB, AC, BD}, {AB, AC, CD}, {AB, BD, CD}, {AC, BD, CD}):\n   k(A) = 1 (one connected component)\n   |A| = 3\n   Term: 4 * (x-1)^(1-1) * (y-1)^(3-1) = 4(y-1)^2\n\n5. All edges (A = {AB, AC, BD, CD}):\n   k(A) = 1 (one connected component)\n   |A| = 4\n   Term: (x-1)^(1-1) * (y-1)^(4-1) = (y-1)^3\n\nNow, we sum up all the terms to get the Tutte polynomial:\n\nT_G(x, y) = (x-1)^3 + 4(x-1)^2(y-1)^(-2) + 4(x-1) + 4(y-1)^2 + (y-1)^3"
