    "message_2": "To apply the Newton-Raphson method, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) and then use the iterative formula:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nGiven function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6. First, let's find its derivative f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 5\n\nNow, let's apply the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of x0 = 2:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\nx1 = 2 - ( (2^2 - 5*2 + 6) / (2*2 - 5) )\nx1 = 2 - ( (4 - 10 + 6) / (4 - 5) )\nx1 = 2 - ( (0) / (-1) )\nx1 = 2\n\nSince x1 is equal to x0, we have already found the root of the equation. Therefore, the root of the equation f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 using the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of x0 = 2 is x = 2."
