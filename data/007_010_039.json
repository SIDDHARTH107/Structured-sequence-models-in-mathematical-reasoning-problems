    "message_1": "Suppose you have a number $x$ which when divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2 and when divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 3. Find the smallest possible value of $x$.",
    "message_2": "We are given that $x$ leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 and a remainder of 3 when divided by 5. This can be written as:\n\n$x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$\n$x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$\n\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this system of congruences. Let $N = 3 \\cdot 5 = 15$. Then, we have:\n\n$N_1 = \\frac{N}{3} = 5$\n$N_2 = \\frac{N}{5} = 3$\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of $N_1$ and $N_2$. We are looking for integers $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that:\n\n$N_1 \\cdot x_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$\n$N_2 \\cdot x_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\n\nWe can see that $x_1 = 2$ and $x_2 = 2$ satisfy these congruences:\n\n$5 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$\n$3 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\n\nNow, we can find the solution to the original system of congruences:\n\n$x \\equiv a_1 \\cdot N_1 \\cdot x_1 + a_2 \\cdot N_2 \\cdot x_2 \\pmod{N}$\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$x \\equiv 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2 + 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\pmod{15}$\n$x \\equiv 20 + 18 \\pmod{15}$\n$x \\equiv 38 \\pmod{15}$\n\nThe smallest possible value of $x$ is the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies this congruence. In this case, it is $x = 8$."
