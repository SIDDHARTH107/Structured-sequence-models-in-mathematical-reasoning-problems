    "message_1": "A medical study follows a new treatment for a certain disease. The study found that of the 100 patients who received the treatment, 80 survived the first year. Of those 80 patients, 60 survived the second year, and of those 60 patients, 48 survived the third year. Calculate the overall survival rate of the patients who received the treatment for the duration of the 3-year study.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the overall survival rate of the patients who received the treatment for the duration of the 3-year study, we need to find the proportion of patients who survived all three years out of the initial 100 patients.\n\nWe know that 48 patients survived all three years. So, the overall survival rate can be calculated as follows:\n\nOverall survival rate = (Number of patients who survived all three years) / (Total number of patients) * 100\n\nOverall survival rate = (48) / (100) * 100\n\nOverall survival rate = 0.48 * 100\n\nOverall survival rate = 48%\n\nSo, the overall survival rate of the patients who received the treatment for the duration of the 3-year study is 48%."
