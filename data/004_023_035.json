    "message_2": "To find the area between the curves, we first need to find the points where the curves intersect. We do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx² + 2x + 3 = 3x - 1\n\nRearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation:\n\nx² - x + 4 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -1, and c = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (1 ± √((-1)² - 4(1)(4))) / 2(1)\nx = (1 ± √(1 - 16)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (1 - 16) is negative, there are no real roots for this equation. This means that the two curves do not intersect between x = -1 and x = 2.\n\nNow, we can find the area between the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the given interval:\n\nArea = ∫(3x - 1 - (x² + 2x + 3)) dx from -1 to 2\n\nSimplify the expression inside the integral:\n\nArea = ∫(3x - 1 - x² - 2x - 3) dx from -1 to 2\nArea = ∫(-x² + x - 4) dx from -1 to 2\n\nNow, integrate the expression:\n\nArea = [-1/3x³ + 1/2x² - 4x] from -1 to 2\n\nEvaluate the definite integral:\n\nArea = ([-1/3(2)³ + 1/2(2)² - 4(2)] - [-1/3(-1)³ + 1/2(-1)² - 4(-1)])\n\nArea = ([-1/3(8) + 1/2(4) - 8] - [-1/3(1) + 1/2(1) + 4])\n\nArea = ([-8/3 + 2 - 8] - [-1/3 + 1/2 + 4])\n\nArea = (-14/3 + 7/2)\n\nArea = (-28 + 21) / 6\n\nArea = -7 / 6\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nArea = 7 / 6\n\nSo, the area between the curves y = x² + 2x + 3 and y = 3x - 1 between x = -1 and x = 2 is 7/6 square units."
