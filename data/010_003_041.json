    "message_2": "Yes, Y is a Hausdorff space.\n\nRecall that a topological space is Hausdorff (also known as T2) if for any two distinct points x and y in the space, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V.\n\nSince X has the discrete topology, every subset of X is an open set. In particular, this means that every subset of Y is also an open set in the subspace topology on Y.\n\nNow, let x and y be any two distinct points in Y. We can choose the open sets U = {x} and V = {y} in Y. Since x ≠ y, these sets are disjoint, and we have x ∈ U and y ∈ V. Thus, Y is a Hausdorff space."
