    "message_2": "Since G has order 6, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6. We are given that a has order 3, and since the subgroup generated by a has order 3, it must be isomorphic to C3. Let H = ⟨a⟩, then |H| = 3.\n\nNow, let b be an element of G not in H. Since G has order 6 and H has order 3, there must be 3 elements in G that are not in H. Since the identity element e is in H, b cannot have order 1. If b has order 3, then b would be in H, which contradicts our assumption that b is not in H. Therefore, b must have order 2 or 6.\n\nCase 1: b has order 6.\nIn this case, G is generated by b, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nCase 2: b has order 2.\nIn this case, we have |b| = 2 and |a| = 3. Since G has order 6, there must be an element c in G such that c is not in H and c ≠ b. Since b has order 2, we have b^2 = e. We will now consider the product ab.\n\n(ab)^2 = abab. Since a has order 3, a^2 = a^(-1). Thus, we can rewrite the expression as a(ba)b. Now, we know that ba ≠ ab since otherwise, b would be in H. Let ba = c, where c is the element in G not in H and not equal to b. Then, (ab)^2 = acb. Since a, b, and c are distinct elements in G, acb ≠ e, so (ab)^2 ≠ e.\n\n(ab)^3 = (ab)(ab)(ab) = a(ba)b a(ba)b a(ba)b = aca^2 c^2 = a^3 c^3 = e, since a has order 3 and c = ba.\n\nThus, ab has order 3. Now, we have shown that G has elements of order 2 (b) and 3 (a and ab). Since G has 6 elements and we have accounted for 5 of them (e, a, a^2, b, ab), the last element must be c = ba. Therefore, G is generated by a and b with the relations a^3 = b^2 = (ab)^3 = e, which are the relations for the dihedral group D3.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
