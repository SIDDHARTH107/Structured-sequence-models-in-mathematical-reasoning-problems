    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken over all x from -∞ to ∞.\n\nIn this case, the function is Ψ(x) = A/(1+x²). So, the Fourier transform of Ψ(x) is:\n\nΨ(k) = ∫[(A/(1+x²)) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken over all x from -∞ to ∞.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the complex residue theorem. First, we rewrite the integrand using complex exponentials:\n\nΨ(k) = A ∫[(1/(1+x²)) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nNow, we can rewrite the denominator as a product of two complex conjugates:\n\nΨ(k) = A ∫[(1/((x+i)(x-i))) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nNext, we can close the contour in the upper half-plane (since k is positive) and use the residue theorem. The only pole inside the contour is at x = i. The residue at x = i is given by:\n\nResidue = lim(x->i) [(x-i) * (1/((x+i)(x-i))) * e^(-2πikx)]\n\nResidue = e^(-2πik(i)) / (2i)\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral:\n\nΨ(k) = 2πi * A * (e^(-2πik(i)) / (2i))\n\nΨ(k) = πA * e^(2πk)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the wave function Ψ(x) = A/(1+x²) is:\n\nΨ(k) = πA * e^(2πk)"
