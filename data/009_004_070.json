    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the general solution of the given differential equation:\n\nm*x''(t) + b*x'(t) + k*x(t) = 0\n\nGiven the values of m, b, and k:\n\n0.5*x''(t) + 0.1*x'(t) + 2*x(t) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the characteristic equation of this differential equation:\n\n0.5*r^2 + 0.1*r + 2 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula to find the roots of the characteristic equation:\n\nr = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nr = (-0.1 ± sqrt(0.1^2 - 4*0.5*2)) / (2*0.5)\n\nr = (-0.1 ± sqrt(-3.9)) / 1\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex conjugates:\n\nr1 = -0.1/1 + sqrt(-3.9)/1 * i = -0.1 + 1.974*i\nr2 = -0.1/1 - sqrt(-3.9)/1 * i = -0.1 - 1.974*i\n\nThe general solution of the differential equation with complex conjugate roots is:\n\nx(t) = e^(-0.1t) * (A*cos(1.974t) + B*sin(1.974t))\n\nNow we need to find the constants A and B using the initial conditions:\n\nx(0) = 0.2\nx'(0) = 0\n\nUsing x(0) = 0.2:\n\n0.2 = e^(0) * (A*cos(0) + B*sin(0))\n0.2 = A\nA = 0.2\n\nNow we need to find the derivative of x(t):\n\nx'(t) = e^(-0.1t) * (-0.1*(0.2*cos(1.974t) + B*sin(1.974t)) + 1.974*(-0.2*sin(1.974t) + B*cos(1.974t)))\n\nUsing x'(0) = 0:\n\n0 = e^(0) * (-0.1*(0.2) + 1.974*B)\n0 = -0.02 + 1.974*B\nB = 0.02 / 1.974\nB ≈ 0.0101\n\nNow we have the particular solution:\n\nx(t) = e^(-0.1t) * (0.2*cos(1.974t) + 0.0101*sin(1.974t))\n\nFinally, we can find the displacement of the mass at time t = 3 seconds:\n\nx(3) = e^(-0.1*3) * (0.2*cos(1.974*3) + 0.0101*sin(1.974*3))\nx(3) ≈ 0.0984\n\nSo, the displacement of the mass at time t = 3 seconds is approximately 0.0984 meters."
