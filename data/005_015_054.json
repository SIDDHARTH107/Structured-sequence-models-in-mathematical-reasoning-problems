    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot perform the actual cluster analysis without the specific data points and their attributes. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how the process works.\n\nTo perform cluster analysis on the dataset of 500 grocery items, you would typically use a clustering algorithm, such as K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN. These algorithms will group the items based on their similarity in attributes like cost, weight, and nutritional value.\n\nFor this problem, we are asked to create 5 distinct clusters. Assuming the K-means clustering algorithm is used, the algorithm will try to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) by iteratively updating the cluster centroids and reassigning the data points to the nearest centroid.\n\nOnce the algorithm converges and the clusters are formed, the number of items in each cluster can vary depending on the distribution of the data points in the attribute space. It is not guaranteed that each cluster will have an equal number of items.\n\nTo determine the number of items in each cluster, you would need to perform the cluster analysis on the actual dataset and then count the number of items assigned to each cluster."
