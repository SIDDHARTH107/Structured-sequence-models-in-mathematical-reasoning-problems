The data were collected from a random sample of 10 employees who live in the same area. The table below shows the number of minutes it takes each employee to drive to work using each route. Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, determine if there is a significant difference in drive times between the two routes at an alpha level of 0.05.\n\n| Employee | Route 1 | Route 2 |\n| -------- | ------- | ------- |\n| 1        | 35      | 37      |\n| 2        | 38      | 40      |\n| 3        | 40      | 43      |\n| 4        | 43      | 45      |\n| 5        | 32      | 36      |\n| 6        | 48      | 50      |\n| 7        | 45      | 46      |\n| 8        | 28      | 30      |\n| 9        | 37      | 39      |\n| 10       | 42      | 45      |",

Since our test statistic (W = 0) is less than the critical value (8), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in drive times between the two routes at an alpha level of 0.05."
