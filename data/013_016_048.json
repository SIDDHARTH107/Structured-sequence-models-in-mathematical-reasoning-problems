    "message_1": "Consider a principal who offers a bonus to an agent for achieving a certain outcome. The agent has two effort levels to choose from: high effort (E=1) and low effort (E=0). The agent's effort level is unobservable by the principal. If the agent chooses a high effort level, there is a 75% chance of achieving the desired outcome, and a 25% chance of not achieving it. If the agent chooses a low effort level, there is a 25% chance of achieving the desired outcome, and a 75% chance of not achieving it. The agent has to choose between the two effort levels before the outcome is observed. \n\nIf the agent chooses a high effort level, the principal will offer a bonus of $100. If the agent chooses a low effort level, the principal will offer a bonus of $50. The agent's utility function for the payoffs is U(B) = sqrt(B). \n\nWhat is the agent's optimal effort level, and what is the expected bonus that the agent will receive?",
    "message_2": "To find the agent's optimal effort level, we need to compare the expected utility of choosing high effort (E=1) and low effort (E=0). Let's calculate the expected utility for each effort level.\n\n1. High effort (E=1):\n- Probability of success: 75% (0.75)\n- Bonus for success: $100\n- Utility for success: U(100) = sqrt(100) = 10\n- Probability of failure: 25% (0.25)\n- Bonus for failure: $0\n- Utility for failure: U(0) = sqrt(0) = 0\n\nExpected utility for high effort = (probability of success * utility for success) + (probability of failure * utility for failure)\n= (0.75 * 10) + (0.25 * 0) = 7.5\n\n2. Low effort (E=0):\n- Probability of success: 25% (0.25)\n- Bonus for success: $50\n- Utility for success: U(50) = sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07\n- Probability of failure: 75% (0.75)\n- Bonus for failure: $0\n- Utility for failure: U(0) = sqrt(0) = 0\n\nExpected utility for low effort = (probability of success * utility for success) + (probability of failure * utility for failure)\n= (0.25 * 7.07) + (0.75 * 0) ≈ 1.77\n\nComparing the expected utilities, the agent's optimal effort level is high effort (E=1) since the expected utility for high effort (7.5) is greater than the expected utility for low effort (1.77).\n\nNow let's calculate the expected bonus that the agent will receive for choosing the high effort level:\n\nExpected bonus = (probability of success * bonus for success) + (probability of failure * bonus for failure)\n= (0.75 * $100) + (0.25 * $0) = $75\n\nSo, the agent's optimal effort level is high effort (E=1), and the expected bonus that the agent will receive is $75."
