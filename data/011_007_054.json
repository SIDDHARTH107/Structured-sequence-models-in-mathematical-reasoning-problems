    "message_2": "Since the person has 2 dollars and each candy costs 25 cents, they can buy a total of 8 candies (2 dollars / 0.25 dollars per candy = 8 candies). We need to find the number of ways they can buy 8 candies in groups of 1, 2, 3, or 4 at a time.\n\n1. Buy 8 candies one at a time: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8\n2. Buy 4 candies two at a time: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8\n3. Buy 2 candies and then 3 candies and then 3 candies: 2 + 3 + 3 = 8\n4. Buy 3 candies and then 2 candies and then 3 candies: 3 + 2 + 3 = 8\n5. Buy 3 candies and then 3 candies and then 2 candies: 3 + 3 + 2 = 8\n\nThere are 5 different ways the person can spend all their money on candies."
