    "message_2": "To find the degree of the projective variety V, we need to determine the maximum number of intersection points of V with a generic line in the projective space P^2. The equation of a generic line in P^2 can be written as aX + bY + cZ = 0, where a, b, and c are constants.\n\nSubstitute the equation of the generic line into the equation of V to eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate Y by solving the line equation for Y and substituting it into the V equation:\n\nY = -(aX + cZ) / b\n\nNow substitute this into the V equation:\n\nX^3(-(aX + cZ) / b) - X^2Z^2 + (-(aX + cZ) / b)^3Z = 0\n\nClear the denominator by multiplying both sides by b^3:\n\n-X^3(aX + cZ)b^2 - X^2Z^2b^3 + (-(aX + cZ))^3Zb^2 = 0\n\nNow, let's expand and simplify the equation:\n\n-aX^4b^2 - cX^3Zb^2 - X^2Z^2b^3 - a^3X^3Zb^2 - 3a^2cX^2Z^2b - 3ac^2XZ^3b^2 = 0\n\nThe degree of V is the maximum total degree of the monomials in the equation. In this case, the highest total degree is 4 (from the term -aX^4b^2). Therefore, the degree of the projective variety V is 4."
