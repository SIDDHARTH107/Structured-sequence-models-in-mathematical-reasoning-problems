    "message_2": "To find the vertex, intercepts, and domain of the function f(x) = |2x - 1| - 2, we'll first analyze the function and then find the required values.\n\n1. Vertex:\nThe vertex of an absolute value function is the point where the function changes direction. In this case, the function changes direction when the expression inside the absolute value (2x - 1) is equal to 0.\n\n2x - 1 = 0\n2x = 1\nx = 1/2\n\nNow, we'll find the corresponding y-value by plugging x = 1/2 into the function:\n\nf(1/2) = |2(1/2) - 1| - 2\nf(1/2) = |1 - 1| - 2\nf(1/2) = |0| - 2\nf(1/2) = 0 - 2\nf(1/2) = -2\n\nSo, the vertex is (1/2, -2).\n\n2. Intercepts:\na) x-intercept: To find the x-intercept, we'll set f(x) = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = |2x - 1| - 2\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n\n2 = |2x - 1|\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 1 = 2\n2x = 3\nx = 3/2\n\nCase 2: 2x - 1 = -2\n2x = -1\nx = -1/2\n\nSo, there are two x-intercepts: (3/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0).\n\nb) y-intercept: To find the y-intercept, we'll set x = 0 and solve for f(x).\n\nf(0) = |2(0) - 1| - 2\nf(0) = |-1| - 2\nf(0) = 1 - 2\nf(0) = -1\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, -1).\n\n3. Domain:\nThe domain of a function is the set of all possible x-values for which the function is defined. Since the absolute value function is defined for all real numbers, the domain of f(x) = |2x - 1| - 2 is all real numbers. In interval notation, the domain is (-∞, ∞).\n\nIn summary:\n- Vertex: (1/2, -2)\n- x-intercepts: (3/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0)\n- y-intercept: (0, -1)\n- Domain: (-∞, ∞)"
