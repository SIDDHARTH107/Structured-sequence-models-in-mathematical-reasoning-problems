    "message_1": "A researcher wants to analyze the relationship between the number of hours students study and the grades they receive. Using regression analysis, he collects the following data and calculates the equation of the least-squares regression line: \n\nX = hours studied per week \nY = grade received \n\nn = 10 \n∑X = 45 \n∑Y = 380 \n∑XY = 194 \n∑X² = 140 \n\nThe equation of the least-squares regression line is y = 11.6 + 8.2x. \n\nWhat is the predicted grade for a student who studies 7 hours per week?",
    "message_2": "To find the predicted grade for a student who studies 7 hours per week, we can plug the value of x (hours studied) into the least-squares regression line equation:\n\ny = 11.6 + 8.2x\n\ny = 11.6 + 8.2(7)\n\ny = 11.6 + 57.4\n\ny = 69\n\nSo, the predicted grade for a student who studies 7 hours per week is 69."
