    "message_2": "In the Rail Fence cipher technique, the message is written in a zigzag pattern along the rails. For the given message \"MATHEMATICS\" and two rails, the pattern would look like this:\n\nM T E A I S\n A H M T C\n\nNow, we read the message along the rows to get the encrypted form:\n\nMT EAIS AHMTC\n\nSo, the encrypted form of the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using Rail Fence cipher with two rails is \"MTEAISAHMTC\"."
