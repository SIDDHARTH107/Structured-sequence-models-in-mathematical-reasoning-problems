    "message_2": "If H(x) returns a value of 8 bits, there are 2^8 = 256 possible hash values. Since the hash function is designed to distribute the input values uniformly across the output space, we can use the birthday paradox to estimate the probability that two randomly selected inputs will have the same hash value.\n\nThe birthday paradox states that for a set of n randomly chosen elements, the probability that at least two of them share the same value is approximately 1 - e^(-n^2 / 2m), where m is the number of possible values.\n\nIn this case, n = 2 (two randomly selected inputs) and m = 256 (2^8 possible hash values). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(collision) ≈ 1 - e^(-2^2 / (2 * 256))\nP(collision) ≈ 1 - e^(-4 / 512)\nP(collision) ≈ 1 - e^(-1 / 128)\n\nThe probability that two randomly selected inputs will have the same hash value is approximately 1 - e^(-1 / 128)."
