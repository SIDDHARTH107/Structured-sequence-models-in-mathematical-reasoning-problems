    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force using integration, we need to integrate the force over the distance moved. In this case, the force is constant, so the integration is straightforward.\n\nWork done (W) = ∫F dx, where F is the force and x is the distance.\n\nSince the force is constant (20 N), we can write the integral as:\n\nW = ∫(20) dx from 0 to 5\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nW = 20x | from 0 to 5\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nW = 20(5) - 20(0)\nW = 100 - 0\nW = 100 J\n\nSo, the work done by the force is 100 Joules."
