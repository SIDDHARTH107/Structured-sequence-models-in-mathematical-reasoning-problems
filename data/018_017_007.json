    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A x B and B, denoted as (A x B) △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\n(A x B) △ B = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)} △ {3, 4, 5}\n\nSince B contains only single elements and A x B contains ordered pairs, their intersection is empty. Therefore, the symmetric difference is just the union of the two sets:\n\n(A x B) △ B = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of B and B, denoted as B △ B. Since the symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection, and the intersection of B and B is B itself, the symmetric difference is the empty set:\n\nB △ B = ∅\n\nNow let's find A x (B △ B):\n\nA x (B △ B) = A x ∅ = ∅ (since the Cartesian product with an empty set is always an empty set)\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B:\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3} △ {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 4, 5} (since 3 is in both sets and is not included in the symmetric difference)\n\nNow let's find (A △ B) x B:\n\n(A △ B) x B = {1, 2, 4, 5} x {3, 4, 5} = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)}\n\nNow let's find A x (B △ A):\n\nA x (B △ A) = A x {4, 5} = {(1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5)}\n\nNow let's compare the results:\n\n1) (A x B) △ B = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), 3, 4, 5}\n2) A x (B △ B) = ∅\n3) (A △ B) x B = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)}\n4) A x (B △ A) = {(1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5)}\n\nAs we can see, the results of the four operations are different. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference, as changing the order of the operations and sets results in different outcomes."
