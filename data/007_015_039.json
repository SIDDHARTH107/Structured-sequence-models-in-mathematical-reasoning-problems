    "message_1": "What is the value of the 7th Mersenne prime?\n\nHint: A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of 2, and it has the form 2ⁿ - 1, where n is a natural number. The 7th Mersenne prime is the 7th prime of this form, and the exponent n is 19.",
    "message_2": "To find the value of the 7th Mersenne prime, we can use the formula 2ⁿ - 1, where n is 19 (as given in the hint). \n\n2¹⁹ - 1 = 2^(19) - 1 = 524288 - 1 = 524287\n\nSo, the value of the 7th Mersenne prime is 524,287."
