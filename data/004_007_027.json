    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = sin(5x^2 - 1) using the chain rule, we first identify the outer function and the inner function. In this case, the outer function is sin(u) and the inner function is u = 5x^2 - 1.\n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. So, we first find the derivatives of the outer and inner functions:\n\nOuter function: sin(u)\nDerivative of the outer function: cos(u)\n\nInner function: u = 5x^2 - 1\nDerivative of the inner function: du/dx = 10x\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = (derivative of outer function) * (derivative of inner function)\nf'(x) = cos(u) * (10x)\n\nSince u = 5x^2 - 1, we substitute it back into the expression:\n\nf'(x) = cos(5x^2 - 1) * (10x)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = sin(5x^2 - 1) is f'(x) = 10x * cos(5x^2 - 1)."
