    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student studying optimization problems with constraints:\n\nA rectangular building is to be constructed with a maximum area of 1000 square feet. One side of the building must be 5 feet longer than the other. What should the dimensions of the building be to maximize its volume? Use calculus to solve.\n\nPlease note: the solution requires finding the partial derivative of the volume with respect to each of the dimensions, setting them equal to zero, and solving the resulting two equations simultaneously.",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the shorter side of the building be x, and the length of the longer side be y. According to the problem, y = x + 5. The area of the building is A = xy, and we are given that A ≤ 1000.\n\nWe want to maximize the volume, V = xyz, subject to the constraint A = xy ≤ 1000 and y = x + 5.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate one of the variables using the constraint y = x + 5. Substituting this into the area constraint, we get:\n\nA = x(x + 5) ≤ 1000\n\nNow, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this optimization problem. Define the Lagrangian function:\n\nL(x, z, λ) = x(x + 5)z - λ(x(x + 5) - 1000)\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, z, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x = (x + 5)z + xz - 2λx - 5λ = 0\n∂L/∂z = x(x + 5) = 0\n∂L/∂λ = x(x + 5) - 1000 = 0\n\nFrom ∂L/∂z = 0, we get that either x = 0 or x + 5 = 0. Since x = 0 would result in no building, we can discard that solution. Thus, x + 5 = 0, which implies x = -5. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as we cannot have a negative length for the building. This indicates that the constraint A = xy ≤ 1000 is not binding, and we can simply maximize the volume V = xyz without considering the constraint.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the volume function using the constraint y = x + 5:\n\nV(x, z) = x(x + 5)z\n\nTo find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives with respect to x and z and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂V/∂x = (x + 5)z + xz = 0\n∂V/∂z = x(x + 5) = 0\n\nFrom ∂V/∂z = 0, we get that either x = 0 or x + 5 = 0. As discussed earlier, x = 0 is not a valid solution. Thus, x + 5 = 0, which implies x = -5, which is also not a valid solution. This indicates that there are no critical points for the volume function, and the maximum volume must occur at the boundary of the feasible region.\n\nSince the maximum area is 1000 square feet, we can set A = 1000:\n\n1000 = x(x + 5)\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 25. Then, using the constraint y = x + 5, we find y = 30. Thus, the dimensions of the building that maximize its volume are 25 feet by 30 feet."
