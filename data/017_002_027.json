    "message_2": "To determine the generator h of H, we need to consider the divisors of the order of G, which is 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup H of G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of H are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nNow, let's consider each case:\n\n1. If the order of H is 1, then H is the trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element. In this case, H is cyclic, and the generator h is e.\n\n2. If the order of H is 2, then H must be generated by an element of order 2. In a cyclic group of order 12, the element of order 2 is a^(12/2) = a^6. So, H = {e, a^6}, and H is cyclic with generator h = a^6.\n\n3. If the order of H is 3, then H must be generated by an element of order 3. In a cyclic group of order 12, the element of order 3 is a^(12/3) = a^4. So, H = {e, a^4, a^8}, and H is cyclic with generator h = a^4.\n\n4. If the order of H is 4, then H must be generated by an element of order 4. In a cyclic group of order 12, the element of order 4 is a^(12/4) = a^3. So, H = {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}, and H is cyclic with generator h = a^3.\n\n5. If the order of H is 6, then H must be generated by an element of order 6. In a cyclic group of order 12, the element of order 6 is a^(12/6) = a^2. So, H = {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}, and H is cyclic with generator h = a^2.\n\n6. If the order of H is 12, then H = G, and H is cyclic with generator h = a.\n\nIn all cases, we have shown that H is a cyclic subgroup of G, and we have determined the generator h for each possible order of H."
