    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(1/R)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and R is the scaling factor.\n\nIn this case, the Cantor set is formed by removing the middle 1/9 segment from each interval, leaving 2 self-similar pieces (N = 2). The scaling factor R is the ratio of the length of the remaining segments to the original length. Since we remove 1/9 of the length, the remaining segments have a length of 1 - 1/9 = 8/9. Therefore, R = 8/9.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(8/9)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nHausdorff dimension â‰ˆ 0.6309\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set with the middle third segments of length 1/9 removed is approximately 0.6309."
