    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a car accident on a certain road during rush hour is 0.2. If there are typically 50 cars traveling on this road during rush hour, what is the expected number of car accidents that will occur during rush hour on this road?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of car accidents during rush hour, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected number of accidents = Number of cars * Probability of an accident\n\nIn this case, there are 50 cars and the probability of an accident is 0.2. So, the expected number of accidents is:\n\nExpected number of accidents = 50 * 0.2 = 10\n\nTherefore, we can expect 10 car accidents to occur during rush hour on this road."
