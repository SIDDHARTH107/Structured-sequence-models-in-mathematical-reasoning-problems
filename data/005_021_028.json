    "message_1": "Suppose a random sample of 50 adults has a mean annual income of $65,000 with a standard deviation of $8,000. Using bootstrapping, estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean annual income of all adults.",
    "message_2": "Bootstrapping is a resampling technique used to estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with replacement. It can be used to estimate the confidence interval for the population mean. Here's how to perform bootstrapping to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean annual income of all adults:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples (e.g., 1000 or more) from the original sample of 50 adults, each with a sample size of 50, and with replacement (meaning the same individual can be selected more than once).\n\n2. Calculate the mean annual income for each bootstrap sample.\n\n3. Arrange the calculated means in ascending order.\n\n4. Determine the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the bootstrap means. These percentiles represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the population mean annual income.\n\nNote that the actual bootstrapping process involves computational work, which cannot be done manually. However, the general idea of the process is described above."
