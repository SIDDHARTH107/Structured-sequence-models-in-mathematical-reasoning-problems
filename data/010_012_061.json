    "message_2": "To show that S is a subset of the set of continuous functions from R to R, we need to show that every smooth function is also a continuous function.\n\nA smooth function is a function that has continuous derivatives of all orders. In other words, a function f: R→R is smooth if for every integer n ≥ 0, the nth derivative of f, denoted as f^(n), exists and is continuous on R.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when n = 0. The 0th derivative of a function is the function itself, i.e., f^(0) = f. Since f is smooth, it has a continuous 0th derivative, which means that f is continuous.\n\nThus, every smooth function is also a continuous function, and therefore, the set S of all smooth functions is a subset of the set of continuous functions from R to R."
