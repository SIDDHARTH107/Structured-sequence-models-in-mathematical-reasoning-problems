    "message_1": "A company is looking to maximize their profit by producing two types of products, A and B. The company has a budget of $10,000 to spend on raw materials and has 70 hours of labor available. Each unit of product A costs $25 in materials and requires 3 hours of labor to produce, while each unit of product B costs $50 and requires 6 hours of labor. If the company can sell each unit of product A for $70 and each unit of product B for $90, how many units of each product should they produce to maximize their profit? (Note: there is a minimum production requirement of 10 units for product A and 5 units for product B.)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. Material cost constraint: 25x + 50y ≤ 10,000\n2. Labor constraint: 3x + 6y ≤ 70\n3. Minimum production constraint: x ≥ 10 and y ≥ 5\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 45x + 40y (since the profit per unit of product A is $70 - $25 = $45 and the profit per unit of product B is $90 - $50 = $40).\n\nFirst, we can simplify the labor constraint by dividing both sides by 3: x + 2y ≤ 23. Now, we can find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 25x + 50y ≤ 10,000\n2. x + 2y ≤ 23\n3. x ≥ 10\n4. y ≥ 5\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (10, 5), (10, 6.5), (11, 6), and (15, 4). We will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(10, 5) = 45(10) + 40(5) = 650\n2. P(10, 6.5) = 45(10) + 40(6.5) = 710\n3. P(11, 6) = 45(11) + 40(6) = 735\n4. P(15, 4) = 45(15) + 40(4) = 795\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (15, 4), with a profit of $795. Therefore, the company should produce 15 units of product A and 4 units of product B to maximize their profit. However, since there is a minimum production requirement of 5 units for product B, the company should produce 15 units of product A and 5 units of product B, resulting in a slightly lower profit of $795 - $40 = $755."
