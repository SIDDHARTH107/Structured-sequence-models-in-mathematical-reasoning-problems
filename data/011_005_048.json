    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word \"COMBINATORICS\", we need to use the formula for permutations of a set with repeated elements. The formula is:\n\nn! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of elements (letters in this case), and n1, n2, ..., nk are the number of repetitions of each distinct element.\n\nIn the word \"COMBINATORICS\", there are 14 letters in total. The repetitions are as follows:\n\nC: 2 times\nO: 2 times\nM: 1 time\nB: 1 time\nI: 2 times\nN: 1 time\nA: 1 time\nT: 1 time\nR: 1 time\nS: 1 time\n\nUsing the formula, we get:\n\n14! / (2! * 2! * 1! * 1! * 2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!)\n\n= 87,178,291,200 / (2 * 2 * 2)\n\n= 87,178,291,200 / 8\n\n= 10,897,286,400\n\nSo there are 10,897,286,400 ways to arrange the letters of the word \"COMBINATORICS\"."
