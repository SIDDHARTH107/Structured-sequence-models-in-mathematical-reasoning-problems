    "message_1": "Suppose you want to use the one-time pad encryption method to encode a message of 10 letters using an alphabet of 26 letters. If the key used for encryption is also a string of 10 letters, then how many possible keys can be generated for this encryption?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the number of possible keys for a one-time pad encryption with a key length of 10 letters and an alphabet of 26 letters, you simply raise the number of letters in the alphabet to the power of the key length.\n\nIn this case, the number of possible keys is 26^10, which equals 141,167,095,653,376."
