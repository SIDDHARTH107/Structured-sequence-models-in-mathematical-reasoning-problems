    "message_2": "Given the solution to the stochastic differential equation:\n\n$$X_t = e^{(\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t + \\sigma W_t}$$\n\nWe want to find the expected value of $X_1$. Recall that the expected value of a random variable is given by the integral of the product of the probability density function and the variable itself. In this case, we have:\n\n$$E[X_1] = E[e^{(\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)(1) + \\sigma W_1}]$$\n\nSince $W_t$ is a Brownian motion, $W_1$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $1$. Thus, we can rewrite the expected value as:\n\n$$E[X_1] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)(1) + \\sigma w} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}w^2} dw$$\n\nNow, we can make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let $u = (\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)(1) + \\sigma w$. Then, $w = \\frac{u - (\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)}{\\sigma}$ and $dw = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} du$. The integral becomes:\n\n$$E[X_1] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^u e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{u - (\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)}{\\sigma}\\right)^2} \\frac{1}{\\sigma} du$$\n\nNow, we can recognize that the integrand is proportional to the probability density function of a normal distribution with mean $(\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)$ and variance $\\sigma^2$. Thus, the integral is equal to the normalization constant of the normal distribution, which is $1$. Therefore, the expected value of $X_1$ is:\n\n$$E[X_1] = e^{(\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)(1)}$$"
