    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that increases in complexity with each order. The total length of a Hilbert curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = n * 4^(k-1)\n\nwhere n is the length of each line segment (1 unit in this case) and k is the order of the curve (3 in this case).\n\nLength = 1 * 4^(3-1) = 1 * 4^2 = 1 * 16 = 16 units\n\nSo, the total length of a Hilbert curve of order 3 with each line segment measuring 1 unit in length is 16 units."
