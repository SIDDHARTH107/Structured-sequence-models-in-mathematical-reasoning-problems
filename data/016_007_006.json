    "message_1": "A Menger sponge is constructed by starting with a cube of side length 3 and removing the middle third of each face, then repeating this process on the remaining smaller cubes. How many cubes are there in the final stage of this construction?",
    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created through an iterative process. In each iteration, we remove the middle third of each face of the cube, which results in removing 1/27 of the volume of the cube and creating 20 smaller cubes. The number of cubes in each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of cubes = 20^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn the final stage of the construction, the number of iterations (n) approaches infinity. As n approaches infinity, the number of cubes in the Menger sponge also approaches infinity. Therefore, there are infinitely many cubes in the final stage of the Menger sponge construction."
