    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question:\n\nSuppose A wants to send a secret message to B using ElGamal encryption. A chooses p=31 and a=3 as the public key, and generates a shared secret key with B as s=5. If the message m that A wants to send is 8, what would be the encrypted message and how can B decrypt it to obtain the original message?",
    "message_2": "To use ElGamal encryption, we first need to compute the public key components. We are given p = 31 (a large prime number) and a primitive root a = 3. We also know the shared secret key s = 5. \n\n1. Compute A's public key component:\nA_public = a^s mod p\nA_public = 3^5 mod 31\nA_public = 243 mod 31\nA_public = 16\n\nNow, A's public key is (p, a, A_public) = (31, 3, 16).\n\n2. To encrypt the message m = 8, A chooses a random number k (1 < k < p-1). Let's say k = 4. Now, compute the following:\n\nC1 = a^k mod p\nC1 = 3^4 mod 31\nC1 = 81 mod 31\nC1 = 19\n\nC2 = m * (A_public^k) mod p\nC2 = 8 * (16^4) mod 31\nC2 = 8 * (65536) mod 31\nC2 = 8 * 1 mod 31\nC2 = 8\n\nThe encrypted message is (C1, C2) = (19, 8).\n\n3. To decrypt the message, B computes the following:\n\nm = C2 * (C1^s)^(-1) mod p\nm = 8 * (19^5)^(-1) mod 31\n\nFirst, calculate the modular inverse of (19^5) mod 31:\n\n(19^5) mod 31 = 2476099 mod 31 = 29\nNow, find the modular inverse of 29 mod 31, which is 29^(-1) mod 31 = 18 (since 29 * 18 mod 31 = 1)\n\nNow, calculate the decrypted message:\n\nm = 8 * 18 mod 31\nm = 144 mod 31\nm = 8\n\nThe decrypted message is 8, which is the original message A wanted to send."
