    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x on the interval [-1, 3], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -6, and c = 2:\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(3)(2))) / (2(3))\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 24)) / 6\nx = (6 ± √12) / 6\n\nThe two critical points are:\n\nx = (6 + √12) / 6 ≈ 1.79\nx = (6 - √12) / 6 ≈ 0.21\n\nNow, we need to check the value of the function at these critical points, as well as at the endpoints of the interval, -1 and 3:\n\nf(-1) = (-1)^3 - 3(-1)^2 + 2(-1) = -1 - 3 - 2 = -6\nf(0.21) ≈ (0.21)^3 - 3(0.21)^2 + 2(0.21) ≈ -0.32\nf(1.79) ≈ (1.79)^3 - 3(1.79)^2 + 2(1.79) ≈ -0.32\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 3(3)^2 + 2(3) = 27 - 27 + 6 = 6\n\nComparing the values of the function at these points, we find that the maximum value is 6 at x = 3 and the minimum value is -6 at x = -1."
