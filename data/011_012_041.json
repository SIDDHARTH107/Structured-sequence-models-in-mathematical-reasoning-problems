    "message_1": "Suppose a class has 40 students, and each student is either taking math, science, or both. There are 25 students taking math and 30 students taking science. How many students are taking both math and science?",
    "message_2": "Let M be the number of students taking math, S be the number of students taking science, and B be the number of students taking both math and science. We are given:\n\nM = 25\nS = 30\nM + S - B = Total number of students = 40\n\nWe need to find B. We can substitute the given values of M and S into the equation:\n\n25 + 30 - B = 40\n\nNow, we can solve for B:\n\n55 - B = 40\nB = 55 - 40\nB = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 students taking both math and science."
