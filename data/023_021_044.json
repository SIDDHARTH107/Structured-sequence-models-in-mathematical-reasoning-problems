    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 10 cm is inserted into a uniform magnetic field of magnitude 0.05 T. The rod is oscillating back and forth in the field with a frequency of 100 Hz. What is the magnitude of the induced EMF in the rod if its cross-sectional area is 2 cm² and its conductivity is 5.96 × 10⁷ S/m? Use Fourier analysis to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the induced EMF in the rod, we can use Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which states that the induced EMF is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the rod. The magnetic flux (Φ) through the rod can be calculated as:\n\nΦ = B * A * cos(ωt)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength (0.05 T), A is the cross-sectional area of the rod (2 cm² = 2 × 10⁻⁴ m²), ω is the angular frequency (2π * 100 Hz), and t is time.\n\nNow, we need to find the rate of change of magnetic flux with respect to time:\n\ndΦ/dt = -B * A * ω * sin(ωt)\n\nThe magnitude of the induced EMF is the maximum value of the rate of change of magnetic flux:\n\nEMF_max = B * A * ω\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nEMF_max = (0.05 T) * (2 × 10⁻⁴ m²) * (2π * 100 Hz)\n\nEMF_max = 0.05 * 2 × 10⁻⁴ * 200π\n\nEMF_max ≈ 0.0628 V\n\nSo, the magnitude of the induced EMF in the rod is approximately 0.0628 V."
