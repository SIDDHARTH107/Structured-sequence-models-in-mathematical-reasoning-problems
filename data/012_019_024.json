    "message_2": "The chromatic index of the given graph is 3.\n\nTo see why, let's try to color the edges of the graph with the minimum number of colors. We can start by coloring the edge AB with color 1. Then, we can color the edge BC with color 2, since it's adjacent to the edge AB. Next, we can color the edge CD with color 1, as it's not adjacent to the edge AB. Now, we have to color the edge DA with color 3, since it's adjacent to both edges AB and CD, which are already colored with colors 1 and 2. Finally, we can color the diagonal edges AC and BD with colors 2 and 1, respectively.\n\nSo, we have used 3 colors to color the edges of the graph such that no adjacent edges have the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index of the graph is 3."
