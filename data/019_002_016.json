    "message_1": "Let P(x) be the predicate \"x is a prime number\", and Q(x) be the predicate \"x is an odd number\". Using predicate logic, determine whether the following statement is true or false:\n\n\"There exists a prime number that is also an odd number.\"\n\nSolution: This statement can be translated into symbolic logic as ∃x (P(x) ∧ Q(x)). To determine whether this statement is true or false, we need to find a prime number that is also an odd number. The smallest prime number that meets this criterion is 3, which is also an odd number. Therefore, the statement is true.",
    "message_2": "Correct, the statement \"There exists a prime number that is also an odd number\" is true. In predicate logic, this can be represented as ∃x (P(x) ∧ Q(x)), and we have found an example (x=3) that satisfies both predicates P(x) and Q(x)."
