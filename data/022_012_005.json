    "message_2": "1. Determine the poles and zeroes of f(z).\n\nTo find the zeroes of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\n4z^2 - 6z + 2 = 0\n\nWe can factor this quadratic equation as follows:\n\n2(2z^2 - 3z + 1) = 0\n2(z - 1)(2z - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the zeroes of f(z) are z = 1 and z = 1/2.\n\nTo find the poles of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^3 - 3z^2 + 3z - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and we can notice that z = 1 is a root:\n\n(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 + 3(1) - 1 = 0\n\nSo, we can factor the cubic equation as follows:\n\n(z - 1)(z^2 - 2z + 1) = 0\n(z - 1)^2(z - 1) = 0\n\nThus, the poles of f(z) are z = 1 with multiplicity 3.\n\n2. Is f(z) analytic at z = 1?\n\nSince z = 1 is a pole of f(z), f(z) is not analytic at z = 1.\n\n3. Evaluate the residues of f(z) at each pole.\n\nWe only have one pole, z = 1, with multiplicity 3. To find the residue at this pole, we can use the formula for residues at poles of order n:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 1] = (1/(n-1)!) * (d^(n-1)/dz^(n-1))[(z - 1)^n * f(z)] at z = 1\n\nIn our case, n = 3, so we need to find the second derivative of (z - 1)^3 * f(z) and evaluate it at z = 1:\n\ng(z) = (z - 1)^3 * f(z) = (z - 1)^3 * (4z^2 - 6z + 2) / (z^3 - 3z^2 + 3z - 1)\n\nSince the denominator will cancel out with the (z - 1)^3 term, we can simplify g(z) to:\n\ng(z) = 4z^2 - 6z + 2\n\nNow, we find the first and second derivatives of g(z):\n\ng'(z) = 8z - 6\ng''(z) = 8\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at z = 1:\n\ng''(1) = 8\n\nFinally, we apply the formula for residues at poles of order n:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 1] = (1/(3-1)!) * 8 = 4\n\nSo, the residue of f(z) at the pole z = 1 is 4."
