    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation 3x^3 + 5x^2 - 2x - 7 = 0, we can try to factor it or use numerical methods to find the roots. Factoring a cubic polynomial can be challenging, so we will use the Rational Root Theorem to help us find possible rational roots.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that any rational root of the polynomial P(x) = a_nx^n + a_(n-1)x^(n-1) + ... + a_1x + a_0 can be written as p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term (a_0) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (a_n).\n\nFor our polynomial, the constant term is -7 and the leading coefficient is 3. The factors of -7 are ±1, ±7, and the factors of 3 are ±1, ±3. Therefore, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±7, ±1/3, and ±7/3.\n\nNow, we will test these possible roots by plugging them into the polynomial:\n\nP(1) = 3(1)^3 + 5(1)^2 - 2(1) - 7 = -1 ≠ 0\nP(-1) = 3(-1)^3 + 5(-1)^2 - 2(-1) - 7 = -3 ≠ 0\nP(7) = 3(7)^3 + 5(7)^2 - 2(7) - 7 = 1029 ≠ 0\nP(-7) = 3(-7)^3 + 5(-7)^2 - 2(-7) - 7 = -1029 ≠ 0\nP(1/3) = 3(1/3)^3 + 5(1/3)^2 - 2(1/3) - 7 ≈ -6.37 ≠ 0\nP(-1/3) = 3(-1/3)^3 + 5(-1/3)^2 - 2(-1/3) - 7 ≈ -5.63 ≠ 0\nP(7/3) = 3(7/3)^3 + 5(7/3)^2 - 2(7/3) - 7 ≈ 20.37 ≠ 0\nP(-7/3) = 3(-7/3)^3 + 5(-7/3)^2 - 2(-7/3) - 7 ≈ 1.63 ≠ 0\n\nNone of the possible rational roots are actual roots of the polynomial. This means that the polynomial has no rational roots, and we will need to use numerical methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method or a graphing calculator, to approximate the real roots.\n\nUsing a graphing calculator or a numerical method, we can approximate the real roots as:\n\nx ≈ -2.359, x ≈ 0.532, and x ≈ 1.827\n\nThese are the approximate solutions to the polynomial equation 3x^3 + 5x^2 - 2x - 7 = 0."
