How can this help you prove that every group of order 18 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6?",
    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 18 and let φ: G → (Z12)∗ be the homomorphism defined by mapping each element to its residue modulo 12. The group of units of the ring Z12, (Z12)∗, is isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups C2 and C3, since (Z12)∗ = {1, 5, 7, 11} ≅ C2 × C3.\n\nFirst, let's find the kernel of φ. The kernel of φ, denoted by ker(φ), is the set of all elements in G that map to the identity element in (Z12)∗, which is 1. Since φ maps each element to its residue modulo 12, the kernel consists of elements whose order divides 12. Since G has order 18, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. However, only elements of order 1, 2, 3, and 6 can have a residue of 1 modulo 12. Therefore, ker(φ) is a subgroup of G with order dividing 6.\n\nNow let's find the image of φ. The image of φ, denoted by im(φ), is the set of all elements in (Z12)∗ that can be obtained by applying φ to elements in G. Since G has order 18, it must have elements of order 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The residues modulo 12 of these elements are 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, and 1, respectively. Therefore, im(φ) is a subgroup of (Z12)∗ with order dividing 2.\n\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem, G/ker(φ) ≅ im(φ). Since ker(φ) has order dividing 6 and im(φ) has order dividing 2, G/ker(φ) has order dividing 6. This means that G has a normal subgroup of order 3 or 6.\n\nNow we can use this information to show that every group of order 18 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6.\n\n1. If G has an element of order 18, then G is a cyclic group and is isomorphic to C18.\n2. If G has an element of order 9, then G has a normal subgroup of order 9. By the recognition theorem for semidirect products, G is a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 2. This is the non-abelian group of order 18.\n3. If G has no elements of order 9 or 18, then G must have a normal subgroup of order 3 and a subgroup of order 6. In this case, G is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6.\n\nThus, every group of order 18 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6."
