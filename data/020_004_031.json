    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The production process requires two resources: labor and raw materials. The company has 200 units of labor and 500 units of raw materials available per day. Each unit of A requires 4 units of labor and 5 units of raw materials, while each unit of B requires 5 units of labor and 4 units of raw materials. The profit from selling one unit of A is $10 and the profit from selling one unit of B is $8. What is the maximum profit the company can earn per day if it wants to produce both products?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. We have the following constraints:\n\n4x + 5y ≤ 200 (labor constraint)\n5x + 4y ≤ 500 (raw materials constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 10x + 8y\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we will solve this linear programming problem graphically by plotting the constraint inequalities and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the constraints as equalities:\n\n4x + 5y = 200\n5x + 4y = 500\n\nNow, we solve for y in terms of x:\n\ny = (200 - 4x)/5\ny = (500 - 5x)/4\n\nWe plot these lines and shade the feasible region, which is the region that satisfies all constraints. The feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 100), (40, 80), and (100, 0).\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. (0, 0): Profit = 10(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. (0, 100): Profit = 10(0) + 8(100) = $800\n3. (40, 80): Profit = 10(40) + 8(80) = $1040\n4. (100, 0): Profit = 10(100) + 8(0) = $1000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (40, 80), where the company produces 40 units of product A and 80 units of product B, resulting in a profit of $1040 per day."
