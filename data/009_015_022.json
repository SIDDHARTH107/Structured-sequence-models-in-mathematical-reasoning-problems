    "message_1": "A sample originally contains 50 milligrams of a radioactive material. After 30 days, only 25 milligrams are left in the sample. What is the half-life of the radioactive material?",
    "message_2": "The half-life of a radioactive material is the time it takes for half of the material to decay. In this case, the sample has decayed from 50 milligrams to 25 milligrams, which is half of the original amount. Since this decay occurred over a period of 30 days, the half-life of the radioactive material is 30 days."
