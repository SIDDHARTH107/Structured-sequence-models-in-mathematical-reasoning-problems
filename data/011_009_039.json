    "message_2": "To partition a set of n distinct elements, we use the Bell number, which is the number of ways to partition a set of n elements. The Bell number can be calculated using the Bell triangle or through the Dobinski formula.\n\nFor a set of 5 distinct elements, the Bell number is B(5). Using the Bell triangle, we can find the first few Bell numbers:\n\nB(0) = 1\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\nB(5) = 52\n\nSo, there are 52 ways to partition a set of 5 distinct elements."
