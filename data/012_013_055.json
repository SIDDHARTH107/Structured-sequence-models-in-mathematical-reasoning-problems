    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of a graph G with 5 vertices and 6 edges, we first need to determine the structure of the graph. Since there are 6 edges, the graph must be connected. There are two possible structures for a connected graph with 5 vertices and 6 edges: a tree with one additional edge or a cycle with one additional edge.\n\nCase 1: Tree with one additional edge\nA tree with 5 vertices has 4 edges. Adding one more edge creates a cycle. This graph is essentially a 5-cycle (C5) with one additional edge. The chromatic polynomial of a cycle with an odd number of vertices is P_C(k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1), where n is the number of vertices and k is the number of colors. In this case, n = 5, so the chromatic polynomial of the 5-cycle is P_C5(k) = (k-1)^5 + (k-1).\n\nNow, we need to account for the additional edge. Let's call the vertices of the 5-cycle A, B, C, D, and E, and the additional edge connects vertices A and C. Since A and C are already connected by an edge in the 5-cycle, adding this edge does not change the chromatic polynomial. Therefore, the chromatic polynomial of the graph G in this case is P_G(k) = P_C5(k) = (k-1)^5 + (k-1).\n\nCase 2: Cycle with one additional edge\nIn this case, the graph is a 5-cycle (C5) with one chord (an edge connecting two non-adjacent vertices). Let's call the vertices of the 5-cycle A, B, C, D, and E, and the chord connects vertices A and C. We can use the deletion-contraction formula to find the chromatic polynomial of this graph:\n\nP_G(k) = P_C5(k) - P_C4(k),\n\nwhere P_C4(k) is the chromatic polynomial of a 4-cycle (C4). The chromatic polynomial of a 4-cycle is P_C4(k) = (k-1)^4 - (k-1)^2. Now, we can substitute the expressions for P_C5(k) and P_C4(k) into the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nP_G(k) = [(k-1)^5 + (k-1)] - [(k-1)^4 - (k-1)^2]\n       = (k-1)^5 - (k-1)^4 + (k-1)^2 + (k-1).\n\nSince both cases result in the same chromatic polynomial, the chromatic polynomial of the graph G with 5 vertices and 6 edges is:\n\nP_G(k) = (k-1)^5 - (k-1)^4 + (k-1)^2 + (k-1)."
