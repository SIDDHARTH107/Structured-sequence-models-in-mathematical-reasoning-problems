    "message_2": "In a best-of-7 series, the first team to win 4 games is the winner. We can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of team A winning the entire series. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of x successes in n trials, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nIn this case, p = 3/5 (probability of team A winning a game), and (1-p) = 2/5 (probability of team B winning a game).\n\nWe need to calculate the probability of team A winning 4, 5, 6, or 7 games in the series. The sum of these probabilities will give us the probability of team A winning the entire series.\n\nP(A wins 4 games) = C(4, 4) * (3/5)^4 * (2/5)^0 = 1 * (81/625) * 1 = 81/625\n\nP(A wins 5 games) = C(5, 4) * (3/5)^4 * (2/5)^1 = 5 * (81/625) * (2/5) = 162/625\n\nP(A wins 6 games) = C(6, 4) * (3/5)^4 * (2/5)^2 = 15 * (81/625) * (4/25) = 1944/15625\n\nP(A wins 7 games) = C(7, 4) * (3/5)^4 * (2/5)^3 = 35 * (81/625) * (8/125) = 2268/15625\n\nNow, we sum these probabilities:\n\nP(A wins series) = P(A wins 4 games) + P(A wins 5 games) + P(A wins 6 games) + P(A wins 7 games)\nP(A wins series) = (81/625) + (162/625) + (1944/15625) + (2268/15625)\nP(A wins series) = 243/625 + 3888/15625\nP(A wins series) = 7569/15625\n\nSo, the probability of team A winning the entire series is 7569/15625, or approximately 0.484."
