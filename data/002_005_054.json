    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal in a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nPlugging in the given dimensions:\n\nDiagonal length = √(10² + 8² + 6²)\nDiagonal length = √(100 + 64 + 36)\nDiagonal length = √200\n\nThe length of the diagonal in the rectangular prism is √200 cm, which is approximately 14.14 cm."
