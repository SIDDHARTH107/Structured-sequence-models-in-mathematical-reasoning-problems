Suppose that we fix the ends of the string at $x = 0$ and $x = \\pi$ so that $u(0,t) = u(\\pi,t) = 0$ for all $t \\ge 0.$ Initially, the string is at rest so that $u_t(x,0) = 0$ and the displacement of the string is given by $u(x,0) = \\sin(x)$ for $0 \\le x \\le \\pi.$\n\nFind an explicit formula for $u(x,t),$ the displacement of the string at position $x$ and time $t.$",
    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation with the given boundary and initial conditions, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) - X''(x)T(t) = 0$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$T''(t) + \\lambda T(t) = 0$\n\n$X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n\nwith boundary conditions $X(0) = X(\\pi) = 0$. The second equation is an eigenvalue problem. We consider three cases for $\\lambda$:\n\n1. $\\lambda < 0$: In this case, the general solution for $X(x)$ is $X(x) = A\\cosh(\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x) + B\\sinh(\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x)$. Since $X(0) = 0$, we have $A = 0$. But then, $X(\\pi) = 0$ implies $B = 0$, so there are no nontrivial solutions in this case.\n\n2. $\\lambda = 0$: In this case, the general solution for $X(x)$ is $X(x) = Ax + B$. Since $X(0) = X(\\pi) = 0$, we again have $A = B = 0$, so there are no nontrivial solutions in this case.\n\n3. $\\lambda > 0$: In this case, the general solution for $X(x)$ is $X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$. Since $X(0) = 0$, we have $A = 0$. The condition $X(\\pi) = 0$ implies that $\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\pi = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$, so $\\lambda = n^2$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Thus, the eigenfunctions are $X_n(x) = \\sin(nx)$ with eigenvalues $\\lambda_n = n^2$.\n\nNow, for each eigenvalue $\\lambda_n = n^2$, the corresponding equation for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$T''(t) + n^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nThe general solution is $T_n(t) = A_n\\cos(nt) + B_n\\sin(nt)$. Since $u_t(x, 0) = 0$, we have $B_n = 0$. Thus, $T_n(t) = A_n\\cos(nt)$.\n\nThe general solution for the wave equation is a linear combination of the product of eigenfunctions and time functions:\n\n$u(x, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(nx) \\cos(nt)$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x, 0) = \\sin(x)$:\n\n$\\sin(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(nx)$\n\nWe can find $A_n$ by multiplying both sides by $\\sin(mx)$ and integrating from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n\n$\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(x) \\sin(mx) dx = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(nx) \\sin(mx) dx$\n\nUsing the orthogonality property of sine functions, the right side becomes:\n\n$A_m \\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin^2(mx) dx$\n\nNow, we compute the left side:\n\n$\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(x) \\sin(mx) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{\\pi} (\\cos((m-1)x) - \\cos((m+1)x)) dx$\n\nFor $m = 1$, the integral evaluates to $\\pi/2$. For $m > 1$, the integral evaluates to $0$. Thus, we have:\n\n$A_1 \\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin^2(x) dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n\n$\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin^2(x) dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so $A_1 = 1$ and $A_n = 0$ for $n > 1$.\n\nFinally, the explicit formula for the displacement of the string is:\n\n$u(x, t) = \\sin(x) \\cos(t)$"
