    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: (4x^2 - 8x)\nFactor out the common term 4x:\n4x(x - 2)\n\nDenominator: (12x^3 - 24x^2)\nFactor out the common term 12x^2:\n12x^2(x - 2)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(4x(x - 2)) / (12x^2(x - 2))\n\nSince (x - 2) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out:\n\n(4x) / (12x^2)\n\nNow, we can simplify further by dividing both terms by their greatest common divisor, which is 4x:\n\n(4x) / (12x^2) = (4x/4x) / (12x^2/4x) = 1 / (3x)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n1 / (3x)"
