    "message_1": "In a data set of test scores, the mean score is 75 and the standard deviation is 5. Assuming the scores follow a normal distribution, what percentage of students scored above an 85?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of students who scored above an 85, we need to calculate the z-score and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the corresponding probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the score we're interested in (85), μ is the mean (75), and σ is the standard deviation (5).\n\nz = (85 - 75) / 5\nz = 10 / 5\nz = 2\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can look it up in the z-table to find the probability of a student scoring below an 85. The value for a z-score of 2 is 0.9772, which means that 97.72% of students scored below an 85.\n\nTo find the percentage of students who scored above an 85, we simply subtract the percentage of students who scored below an 85 from 100%:\n\n100% - 97.72% = 2.28%\n\nSo, approximately 2.28% of students scored above an 85."
