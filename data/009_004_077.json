    "message_2": "a) To determine the frequency of oscillation of the system, we first need to find the angular frequency (ω) using the formula:\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (80 N/m) and m is the mass (2 kg).\n\nω = √(80/2) = √40 = 2√10 rad/s\n\nNow, we can find the frequency (f) using the formula:\n\nf = ω / (2π)\n\nf = (2√10) / (2π) ≈ 1.13 Hz\n\nb) The equation of motion for a spring-mass system can be written as:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement at time t, A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle. Since the system is initially at rest and displaced 0.1 m from equilibrium, the phase angle is 0, and the equation of motion becomes:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(2√10 * t)\n\nc) The amplitude of oscillations is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. In this case, the amplitude is given as 0.1 m.\n\nd) To calculate the maximum speed of the mass during the oscillation cycle, we can use the formula:\n\nv_max = A * ω\n\nwhere A is the amplitude (0.1 m) and ω is the angular frequency (2√10 rad/s).\n\nv_max = 0.1 * 2√10 ≈ 0.63 m/s\n\ne) To find the time taken by the mass to complete one cycle, we can use the formula:\n\nT = 1 / f\n\nwhere T is the time period and f is the frequency (1.13 Hz).\n\nT = 1 / 1.13 ≈ 0.88 s"
