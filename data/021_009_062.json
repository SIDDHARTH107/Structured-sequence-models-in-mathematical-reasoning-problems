    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 4x + 8 using the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x. This will give us the gradient (slope) of the function at any given point.\n\nDerivative of f(x) with respect to x: f'(x) = 4x + 4\n\nNow, we will perform the gradient descent optimization process for 5 iterations with an initial guess of x = 0.5 and a learning rate of 0.1.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = x0 - learning_rate * f'(x0)\nx1 = 0.5 - 0.1 * (4 * 0.5 + 4)\nx1 = 0.5 - 0.1 * (6)\nx1 = 0.5 - 0.6\nx1 = -0.1\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = x1 - learning_rate * f'(x1)\nx2 = -0.1 - 0.1 * (4 * (-0.1) + 4)\nx2 = -0.1 - 0.1 * (3.6)\nx2 = -0.1 - 0.36\nx2 = -0.46\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = x2 - learning_rate * f'(x2)\nx3 = -0.46 - 0.1 * (4 * (-0.46) + 4)\nx3 = -0.46 - 0.1 * (1.16)\nx3 = -0.46 - 0.116\nx3 = -0.576\n\nIteration 4:\nx4 = x3 - learning_rate * f'(x3)\nx4 = -0.576 - 0.1 * (4 * (-0.576) + 4)\nx4 = -0.576 - 0.1 * (-0.704)\nx4 = -0.576 + 0.0704\nx4 = -0.5056\n\nIteration 5:\nx5 = x4 - learning_rate * f'(x4)\nx5 = -0.5056 - 0.1 * (4 * (-0.5056) + 4)\nx5 = -0.5056 - 0.1 * (0.1776)\nx5 = -0.5056 - 0.01776\nx5 = -0.48784\n\nAfter 5 iterations, our optimized value of x is approximately -0.48784. Now, we can find the minimum value of the function f(x) using this optimized value of x:\n\nf(x) = 2x^2 + 4x + 8\nf(-0.48784) = 2(-0.48784)^2 + 4(-0.48784) + 8\nf(-0.48784) â‰ˆ 5.4625\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 4x + 8 after 5 iterations of gradient descent with an initial guess of x = 0.5 and a learning rate of 0.1 is approximately 5.4625."
