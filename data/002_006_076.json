    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nGiven the radius r = 7 centimeters, we can calculate the circumference as follows:\n\nC = 2π(7)\nC ≈ 2 × 3.14 × 7\nC ≈ 43.96\n\nThe circumference of the circle is approximately 43.96 centimeters when rounded to two decimal places."
