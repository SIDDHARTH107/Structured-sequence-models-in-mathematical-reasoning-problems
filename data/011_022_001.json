The following table shows a list of items with their respective weights and profits:\n\n| Item | Weight (in lbs) | Profit (in dollars) |\n|------|----------------|---------------------|\n| A    | 4              | 10                  |\n| B    | 3              | 8                   |\n| C    | 6              | 20                  |\n| D    | 2              | 5                   |\n| E    | 1              | 4                   |\n\nWhat combination of items should the retailer choose to sell to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the combination of items that gives the highest profit per pound while not exceeding the 15-pound limit. First, we calculate the profit per pound for each item:\n\n| Item | Weight (in lbs) | Profit (in dollars) | Profit per Pound |\n|------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| A    | 4              | 10                  | 2.5              |\n| B    | 3              | 8                   | 2.67             |\n| C    | 6              | 20                  | 3.33             |\n| D    | 2              | 5                   | 2.5              |\n| E    | 1              | 4                   | 4                |\n\nNow we sort the items by their profit per pound in descending order:\n\n| Item | Weight (in lbs) | Profit (in dollars) | Profit per Pound |\n|------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| E    | 1              | 4                   | 4                |\n| C    | 6              | 20                  | 3.33             |\n| B    | 3              | 8                   | 2.67             |\n| A    | 4              | 10                  | 2.5              |\n| D    | 2              | 5                   | 2.5              |\n\nNow we start adding items to the inventory, starting with the highest profit per pound, until we reach the 15-pound limit:\n\n1. Add item E (1 lb, $4 profit)\n2. Add item C (6 lbs, $20 profit)\n3. Add another item C (6 lbs, $20 profit)\n\nAt this point, we have reached the 15-pound limit (1 + 6 + 6 = 13). The total profit for this combination is $44 (4 + 20 + 20).\n\nSo, the retailer should choose to sell 1 unit of item E and 2 units of item C to maximize their profit."
