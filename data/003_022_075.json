    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\na · b = |a| |b| cos(θ)\n\nwhere a and b are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nGiven the magnitudes of vector a is 5 and vector b is 8, and the angle between them is 60 degrees, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\na · b = (5)(8)cos(60°)\n\nSince cos(60°) = 1/2, we can simplify the expression:\n\na · b = (5)(8)(1/2)\n\na · b = 40/2\n\na · b = 20\n\nSo, the dot product of vectors a and b is 20."
