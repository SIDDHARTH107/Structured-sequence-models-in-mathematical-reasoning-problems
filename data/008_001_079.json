    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first write the given system of equations in the form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nThe given system of equations is:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 5\n5x - 4y + z = -5\nx - y + 2z = 4\n\nWe can write this system in the form AX = B as follows:\n\nA = | 2  3 -1 |\n    | 5 -4  1 |\n    | 1 -1  2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  5  |\n    | -5  |\n    |  4  |\n\nNow, we will find the inverse of matrix A (denoted as A_inv) and then multiply it by matrix B to find the matrix X, which contains the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of matrix A:\n\ndet(A) = 2(-8 - 2) - 3(10 - 1) + (-1)(-4 - 5)\n       = 2(-10) - 3(9) + 9\n       = -20 - 27 + 9\n       = -38\n\nSince the determinant of matrix A is non-zero, the inverse of matrix A exists. Now, let's find the inverse of matrix A:\n\nA_inv = (1/det(A)) * adj(A), where adj(A) is the adjugate of matrix A.\n\nadj(A) = | (-8 - 2)  -(10 - 1)  (-4 - 5) |\n         | -(15 - 1)  (4 - 4)   -(5 - 2) |\n         | -(-4 + 3)  -(5 - 10)  (2 - 15) |\n\nadj(A) = | -10  -9  -9 |\n         | -14   0   3 |\n         |  1   5 -13 |\n\nNow, let's find A_inv:\n\nA_inv = (1/-38) * | -10  -9  -9 |\n                 | -14   0   3 |\n                 |   1   5 -13 |\n\nNow, we will multiply A_inv by B to find X:\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nX = (1/-38) * | -10  -9  -9 | * |  5  |\n              | -14   0   3 |   | -5  |\n              |   1   5 -13 |   |  4  |\n\nX = (1/-38) * | -50 + 45 - 36 |\n              | -70 +  0 + 12 |\n              |   5 - 25 + 52 |\n\nX = (1/-38) * | -41 |\n              | -58 |\n              |  32 |\n\nX = | 41/38  |\n    | 29/19  |\n    | -16/19 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 41/38\ny = 29/19\nz = -16/19"
