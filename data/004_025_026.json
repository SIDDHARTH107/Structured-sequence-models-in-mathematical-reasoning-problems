    "message_1": "A race car is traveling at a constant speed of 80 miles per hour. The car comes to a sudden stop in 2 seconds due to an accident. What was the force exerted on the car during that time? Use calculus to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to convert the speed from miles per hour to meters per second. \n\n1 mile = 1609.34 meters\n1 hour = 3600 seconds\n\n80 miles per hour = 80 * (1609.34/3600) meters per second â‰ˆ 35.76 m/s\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration of the car. We know that the car comes to a stop in 2 seconds, so the final velocity is 0 m/s. We can use the formula:\n\nv = u + at\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time. In this case, v = 0 m/s, u = 35.76 m/s, and t = 2 seconds. We can solve for a:\n\n0 = 35.76 + a(2)\na = -35.76 / 2\na = -17.88 m/s^2\n\nThe acceleration is negative because it's in the opposite direction of the initial velocity (deceleration).\n\nNow, we can use Newton's second law of motion to find the force exerted on the car:\n\nF = ma\n\nwhere F is the force, m is the mass of the car, and a is the acceleration. We don't have the mass of the car, so we'll represent it as m:\n\nF = m(-17.88)\n\nThe force exerted on the car is -17.88 times its mass (in Newtons). The negative sign indicates that the force is in the opposite direction of the initial velocity."
