    "message_2": "To find the chromatic index of the graph G, we can use Vizing's theorem, which states that the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G is either its maximum degree Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1.\n\nIn this graph, the maximum degree is 3 (vertices A, D, and E each have a degree of 3). So, the chromatic index will be either 3 or 4.\n\nNow, let's try to color the edges of the graph using 3 colors:\n\n1. Color the edge AB with color 1.\n2. Color the edge AC with color 2.\n3. Color the edge AD with color 3.\n4. Color the edge BC with color 2.\n5. Color the edge BD with color 1.\n6. Color the edge BE with color 3.\n\nAt this point, we cannot color the edge EF with any of the three colors, as it is adjacent to edges with all three colors. Therefore, we need a fourth color.\n\nSo, the chromatic index of the graph G is 4."
