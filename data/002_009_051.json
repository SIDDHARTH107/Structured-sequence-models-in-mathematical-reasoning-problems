    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven, radius (r) = 5 cm and height (h) = 10 cm.\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(5)² + 2π(5)(10)\nSurface Area = 2π(25) + 2π(50)\nSurface Area = 50π + 100π\nSurface Area = 150π cm²\n\nSo, the exact surface area of the cylinder is 150π cm²."
