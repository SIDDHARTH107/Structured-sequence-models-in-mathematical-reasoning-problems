    "message_1": "At a construction site, there are a total of 500 workers. The probability of an accident occurring for each worker is 0.05. What is the probability that in a day, there will be exactly 20 accidents at the construction site?",
    "message_2": "We can model this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k accidents occurring\n- n is the total number of workers (500)\n- k is the number of accidents we want to find the probability for (20)\n- p is the probability of an accident occurring for each worker (0.05)\n- (n choose k) is the number of combinations of choosing k accidents from n workers, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 20) = (500 choose 20) * (0.05)^20 * (1-0.05)^(500-20)\n\nFirst, let's calculate (500 choose 20):\n\n(500 choose 20) = 500! / (20!(500-20)!) = 500! / (20!480!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the other parts of the formula:\n\n(0.05)^20 = 9.5367431640625e-27\n(1-0.05)^(500-20) = 0.95^480 ≈ 1.798408e-21\n\nNow, we can put it all together:\n\nP(X = 20) = (500 choose 20) * 9.5367431640625e-27 * 1.798408e-21\n\nTo calculate this, we can use a calculator or a software like Python:\n\nP(X = 20) ≈ 0.0443\n\nSo, the probability of exactly 20 accidents occurring at the construction site in a day is approximately 4.43%."
