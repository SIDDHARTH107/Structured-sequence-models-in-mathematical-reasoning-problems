    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference between the sets A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {2, 4, 8, 10}\nB - A = {3, 9, 12}\n\nA ∆ B = {2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the symmetric difference with the set C = {2, 3, 6, 8}.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ C = {2, 3, 8}\n\nNow, we need to show that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over intersection. To do this, we will prove that:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C)\n\nFirst, let's find the intersection of A and C, and B and C:\n\nA ∩ C = {2, 6, 8}\nB ∩ C = {3, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between (A ∩ C) and (B ∩ C):\n\n(A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C) = ({2, 6, 8} - {3, 6}) ∪ ({3, 6} - {2, 6, 8})\n\n(A ∩ C) - (B ∩ C) = {2, 8}\n(B ∩ C) - (A ∩ C) = {3}\n\n(A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C) = {2, 3, 8}\n\nWe can see that (A ∆ B) ∩ C = {2, 3, 8} and (A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C) = {2, 3, 8}. Since both sets are equal, we have shown that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over intersection."
