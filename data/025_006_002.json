    "message_2": "To compute the second cohomology group H^2(X, ℤ), we will use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that if X is a smooth projective variety of dimension n, and H is a hyperplane section of X, then the restriction map H^k(X, ℤ) → H^k(H, ℤ) is an isomorphism for k < n - 1 and injective for k = n - 1.\n\nIn our case, X is a three-dimensional variety defined by the two equations:\n\n1. x^3 + y^3 + z^3 − 3xyz = 0\n2. x^2 + y^2 + z^2 − 1 = 0\n\nThe second equation is a smooth quadric surface in ℙ^3, and X is a complete intersection of this quadric surface with the cubic hypersurface defined by the first equation. Thus, X is a smooth projective variety of dimension 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the hyperplane section H of X given by the intersection of X with the hyperplane at infinity, which is defined by the equation w = 0 in the projective space ℙ^3. In the affine space, this corresponds to the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1. The intersection of this hyperplane with the quadric surface is a smooth curve of genus g, and the intersection of this curve with the cubic hypersurface is a set of points.\n\nBy the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the restriction map H^k(X, ℤ) → H^k(H, ℤ) is an isomorphism for k < 2 - 1 = 1 and injective for k = 2 - 1 = 1. Since H^1(X, ℤ) = H^1(H, ℤ) = 0, we have H^2(X, ℤ) = H^2(H, ℤ). The second cohomology group of the hyperplane section H is given by the Betti numbers b_2(H) = 2g - 2, where g is the genus of the curve.\n\nTo compute the genus g, we can use the adjunction formula, which states that for a smooth curve C in a smooth surface S, the genus g is given by:\n\ng = (C·(C + K_S))/2 + 1,\n\nwhere C·(C + K_S) denotes the intersection number of C with the divisor C + K_S, and K_S is the canonical divisor of the surface S.\n\nIn our case, the surface S is the quadric surface x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1, and the curve C is the intersection of S with the hyperplane at infinity. The canonical divisor K_S of the quadric surface is given by K_S = -2H, where H is the class of a hyperplane section. Thus, the adjunction formula becomes:\n\ng = (C·(C - 2H))/2 + 1.\n\nSince the curve C is a hyperplane section, we have C = H, and the intersection number becomes:\n\nC·(C - 2H) = H·(-H) = -H^2.\n\nThe self-intersection number of a hyperplane section on a quadric surface is -2, so we have:\n\ng = (-2)/2 + 1 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the genus of the curve is 0, and the second cohomology group of the hyperplane section H is given by:\n\nH^2(H, ℤ) = ℤ^(2g - 2) = ℤ^0 = 0.\n\nFinally, we have:\n\nH^2(X, ℤ) = H^2(H, ℤ) = 0."
