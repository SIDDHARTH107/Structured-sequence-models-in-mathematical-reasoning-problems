    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nAssume that the price of a stock follows a geometric Brownian motion with the following parameters: the initial price is $60, the continuously compounded drift rate is 8%, the volatility is 40%, and the time to maturity is 0.5 years. Determine the fair price of a call option with a strike price of $65, using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation for option pricing with stochastic volatility.",
    "message_2": "To determine the fair price of a call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation, we need to calculate the d1 and d2 values, and then plug them into the equation. The formula for d1 and d2 are as follows:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + σ^2/2)T) / (σ√T)\nd2 = d1 - σ√T\n\nwhere:\nS = initial stock price = $60\nK = strike price = $65\nr = continuously compounded drift rate = 8% = 0.08\nσ = volatility = 40% = 0.4\nT = time to maturity = 0.5 years\n\nFirst, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(60/65) + (0.08 + 0.4^2/2) * 0.5) / (0.4 * √0.5)\nd1 = (ln(0.9231) + (0.08 + 0.08) * 0.5) / (0.4 * 0.7071)\nd1 = (-0.0790 + 0.08) / 0.2828\nd1 = 0.0036 / 0.2828\nd1 ≈ 0.0127\n\nd2 = d1 - σ√T\nd2 = 0.0127 - (0.4 * √0.5)\nd2 = 0.0127 - 0.2828\nd2 ≈ -0.2701\n\nNow, we can use the Black-Scholes-Merton equation to find the fair price of the call option:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nC = fair price of the call option\nN(d1) and N(d2) are the cumulative normal distribution values for d1 and d2, respectively\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n\nN(d1) ≈ 0.5041\nN(d2) ≈ 0.3940\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\nC = 60 * 0.5041 - 65 * e^(-0.08 * 0.5) * 0.3940\nC = 30.246 - 65 * 0.9608 * 0.3940\nC = 30.246 - 65 * 0.3781\nC = 30.246 - 24.5765\nC ≈ 5.6695\n\nTherefore, the fair price of the call option with a strike price of $65 is approximately $5.67."
