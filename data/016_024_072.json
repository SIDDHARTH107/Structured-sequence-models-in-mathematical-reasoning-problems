    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet fractal is formed by recursively dividing a square into 9 smaller squares and removing the center square at each iteration. After N iterations, the number of squares can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of squares = 8^N\n\nwhere N is the number of iterations."
