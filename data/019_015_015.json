    "message_2": "To find the number of possible functions from a set with 4 elements (domain) to a set with 3 elements (codomain), we can use the formula:\n\nnumber of functions = (size of codomain)^(size of domain)\n\nIn this case, the size of the domain is 4 and the size of the codomain is 3. So the number of possible functions is:\n\n3^4 = 81\n\nThere are 81 possible functions from a set with 4 elements to a set with 3 elements, given that the order of the elements in the codomain does not matter."
