    "message_2": "There is only one ace of spades in a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing an ace of spades is 1 out of 52, which can be expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage:\n\nFraction: 1/52\nDecimal: 0.01923 (rounded to 5 decimal places)\nPercentage: 1.923% (rounded to 3 decimal places)"
