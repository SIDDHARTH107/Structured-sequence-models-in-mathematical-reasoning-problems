    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each segment. After each construction, the remaining segments have a total length equal to 2/3 of the previous length. \n\nLet's find the sum of the lengths after the 4th construction:\n\n1. Initial length: 1\n2. After 1st construction: 1 * (2/3) = 2/3\n3. After 2nd construction: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9\n4. After 3rd construction: (4/9) * (2/3) = 8/27\n5. After 4th construction: (8/27) * (2/3) = 16/81\n\nSo, the sum of the length of the Cantor set after the 4th construction is 16/81."
