    "message_2": "To solve the discrete logarithm 7^x ≡ 4 (mod 11), we need to find the smallest positive integer x such that 7^x is congruent to 4 modulo 11.\n\nWe can do this by trying out different values of x and checking if the congruence holds:\n\n1. x = 1: 7^1 ≡ 7 (mod 11) (not a solution)\n2. x = 2: 7^2 ≡ 49 ≡ 5 (mod 11) (not a solution)\n3. x = 3: 7^3 ≡ 343 ≡ 2 (mod 11) (not a solution)\n4. x = 4: 7^4 ≡ 2401 ≡ 8 (mod 11) (not a solution)\n5. x = 5: 7^5 ≡ 16807 ≡ 4 (mod 11) (solution found)\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the discrete logarithm 7^x ≡ 4 (mod 11) is x = 5."
