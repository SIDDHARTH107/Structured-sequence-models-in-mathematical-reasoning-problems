    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative of the function $f(x,y,z)$, we first need to find the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$. Then, we can express the exterior derivative as a differential 1-form.\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2xy$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = x^2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = 3z^2$$\n\nNow, we can express the exterior derivative $df$ as a differential 1-form:\n$$df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} dy + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} dz$$\n$$df = (2xy) dx + (x^2) dy + (3z^2) dz$$\n\nHowever, we need to compute the exterior derivative on the manifold $M$. Since $M$ is defined by the constraint $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$, we can use the gradient of the constraint function $g(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1$ to project $df$ onto the tangent space of $M$ at each point.\n\nThe gradient of $g$ is:\n$$\\nabla g = (2x, 2y, 2z)$$\n\nNow, we can project $df$ onto the tangent space of $M$ by subtracting the component of $df$ in the direction of $\\nabla g$:\n\n$$df_M = df - \\frac{df \\cdot \\nabla g}{\\|\\nabla g\\|^2} \\nabla g$$\n\nFirst, compute the dot product $df \\cdot \\nabla g$:\n$$df \\cdot \\nabla g = (2xy)(2x) + (x^2)(2y) + (3z^2)(2z) = 4x^2y + 2x^2y + 6z^3 = 6x^2y + 6z^3$$\n\nThe squared norm of $\\nabla g$ is:\n$$\\|\\nabla g\\|^2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 4$$\n\nNow, we can compute the projection:\n$$df_M = df - \\frac{6x^2y + 6z^3}{4} (2x, 2y, 2z)$$\n$$df_M = (2xy) dx + (x^2) dy + (3z^2) dz - \\frac{3}{2}(x^2y + z^3)(x, y, z)$$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative of $f$ on the manifold $M$ is:\n$$df_M = (2xy - \\frac{3}{2}(x^2y + z^3)x) dx + (x^2 - \\frac{3}{2}(x^2y + z^3)y) dy + (3z^2 - \\frac{3}{2}(x^2y + z^3)z) dz$$"
