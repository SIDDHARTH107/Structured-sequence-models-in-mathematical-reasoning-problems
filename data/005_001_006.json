    "message_1": "Suppose a car rental company claims that their average wait time for customers picking up cars is less than 10 minutes. To test this claim, a random sample of 25 customers is taken and their wait times are recorded. The sample mean wait time is found to be 8.5 minutes with a standard deviation of 2.3 minutes. Using a significance level of 0.05, can we reject the company's claim?",
    "message_2": "To test the company's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average wait time is equal to 10 minutes, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average wait time is less than 10 minutes.\n\nH0: μ = 10\nH1: μ < 10\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 25\nSample mean (x̄) = 8.5 minutes\nSample standard deviation (s) = 2.3 minutes\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (8.5 - 10) / (2.3 / √25)\nt = (-1.5) / (2.3 / 5)\nt = -1.5 / 0.46\nt ≈ -3.26\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24) and a significance level of 0.05. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value:\n\nt_critical ≈ -1.71\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-3.26) is less than the critical t-value (-1.71), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This means that there is significant evidence to suggest that the average wait time for customers picking up cars is less than 10 minutes at a 0.05 significance level."
