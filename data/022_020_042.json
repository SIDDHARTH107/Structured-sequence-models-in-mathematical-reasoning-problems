    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using complex analysis techniques, we first need to find the general solution of the given differential equation:\n\n$y''(x) + 4y(x) = x^2$\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as a second-order linear inhomogeneous differential equation:\n\n$y''(x) + 4y(x) - x^2 = 0$\n\nNow, we will find the complementary function by solving the homogeneous equation:\n\n$y''(x) + 4y(x) = 0$\n\nThe characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is:\n\n$r^2 + 4 = 0$\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\n$r = \\pm 2i$\n\nSo, the complementary function is:\n\n$y_c(x) = C_1 \\cos(2x) + C_2 \\sin(2x)$\n\nNow, we need to find a particular solution for the inhomogeneous equation. We will use the method of undetermined coefficients. We guess a particular solution of the form:\n\n$y_p(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + C$\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives, we get:\n\n$y_p'(x) = 2Ax + B$\n\n$y_p''(x) = 2A$\n\nSubstituting these into the inhomogeneous equation, we get:\n\n$2A + 4(Ax^2 + Bx + C) = x^2$\n\nExpanding and equating coefficients, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$4A = 1$\n\n$4B = 0$\n\n$2A + 4C = 0$\n\nSolving this system, we find:\n\n$A = \\frac{1}{4}, \\quad B = 0, \\quad C = -\\frac{1}{8}$\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\n$y_p(x) = \\frac{1}{4}x^2 - \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nNow, the general solution is the sum of the complementary function and the particular solution:\n\n$y(x) = C_1 \\cos(2x) + C_2 \\sin(2x) + \\frac{1}{4}x^2 - \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nWe are given the boundary conditions:\n\n$y(0) = 1$\n\n$y(\\pi) = 2$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$1 = C_1 - \\frac{1}{8}$\n\n$2 = C_1 \\cos(2\\pi) + C_2 \\sin(2\\pi) + \\frac{1}{4}\\pi^2 - \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find:\n\n$C_1 = \\frac{9}{8}$\n\n$C_2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo, the solution of the boundary value problem is:\n\n$y(x) = \\frac{9}{8} \\cos(2x) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\sin(2x) + \\frac{1}{4}x^2 - \\frac{1}{8}$"
