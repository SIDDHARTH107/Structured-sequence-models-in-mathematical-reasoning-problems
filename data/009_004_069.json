    "message_2": "To determine the equation of motion for the mass-spring system, we can use Hooke's Law and Newton's second law of motion. Hooke's Law states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to the displacement from its equilibrium position:\n\nF = -kx\n\nwhere F is the force exerted by the spring, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nNewton's second law of motion states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:\n\nF = ma\n\nFor a mass-spring system, the force acting on the mass is the force exerted by the spring:\n\nma = -kx\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the mass (m = 2 kg) and the spring constant (k = 4 N/m):\n\n2a = -4x\n\nTo find the acceleration (a), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\na = -2x\n\nSince acceleration is the second derivative of displacement with respect to time, we can write the equation of motion as:\n\nx''(t) = -2x(t)\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution for this type of equation is:\n\nx(t) = A*cos(ωt) + B*sin(ωt)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, ω is the angular frequency, and t is time. Since the initial velocity is zero, the derivative of x(t) with respect to time is:\n\nx'(t) = -A*ω*sin(ωt) + B*ω*cos(ωt)\n\nAt t = 0, x(0) = 0.1 m and x'(0) = 0. Plugging these values into the equations, we get:\n\n0.1 = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0)\n0 = -A*ω*sin(0) + B*ω*cos(0)\n\nSolving these equations, we find that A = 0.1 and B = 0. Therefore, the equation of motion for the mass-spring system is:\n\nx(t) = 0.1*cos(ωt)\n\nNow, we need to find the angular frequency (ω) and the period of oscillation (T). The angular frequency can be found using the formula:\n\nω² = k/m\n\nPlugging in the given values for k and m, we get:\n\nω² = 4/2\nω = √2\n\nThe period of oscillation is the time it takes for the system to complete one full cycle, which is related to the angular frequency by the formula:\n\nT = 2π/ω\n\nPlugging in the value for ω, we get:\n\nT = 2π/√2 ≈ 4.44 s\n\nSo, the equation of motion for the mass-spring system is:\n\nx(t) = 0.1*cos(√2*t)\n\nand the period of oscillation is approximately 4.44 seconds."
