    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to optimal control:\n\nA farmer wants to spray pesticides evenly over a rectangular plot of land that measures 100 meters by 200 meters. The pesticides will be sprayed by a helicopter that can fly at a maximum speed of 50 meters per second. The time it takes to turn around at the end of the plot is negligible. What is the shortest amount of time it will take to spray the entire plot, assuming that the helicopter maintains a constant altitude and that the pesticides are sprayed at a constant rate of 5 liters per second?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total area of the plot, the total amount of pesticide needed, and the time it takes to spray the entire plot.\n\n1. Calculate the area of the plot:\nArea = length × width\nArea = 100 meters × 200 meters\nArea = 20,000 square meters\n\n2. Calculate the total amount of pesticide needed:\nSince the pesticide is sprayed at a constant rate of 5 liters per second, we need to find out how many liters are needed to cover the entire area. We can assume that 1 liter of pesticide covers 1 square meter of land.\n\nTotal pesticide needed = Area\nTotal pesticide needed = 20,000 liters\n\n3. Calculate the time it takes to spray the entire plot:\nNow we know that the helicopter sprays 5 liters of pesticide per second and we need 20,000 liters to cover the entire plot. We can find the time it takes to spray the entire plot by dividing the total amount of pesticide needed by the rate at which it is sprayed.\n\nTime = Total pesticide needed / Rate of spraying\nTime = 20,000 liters / 5 liters per second\nTime = 4,000 seconds\n\nTherefore, it will take the helicopter 4,000 seconds to spray the entire plot of land."
