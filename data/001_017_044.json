    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(x+1) + log2(x-1) = 3, we can use the logarithm property that states that log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b). Applying this property, we get:\n\nlog2((x+1)(x-1)) = 3\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\n2^3 = (x+1)(x-1)\n\n8 = x^2 - 1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx^2 = 9\n\nx = ±√9\n\nx = ±3\n\nHowever, since log2(x-1) is part of the original equation, we cannot have x = 3, as this would result in taking the logarithm of 0, which is undefined. Therefore, the only solution is:\n\nx = -3"
