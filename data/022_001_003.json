Starting from the domain D1 = {z: |z - 1| < 1}, the student is instructed to find a larger domain D2 such that the function f can be extended analytically and computed at z = 2.",
    "message_2": "To find the value of the holomorphic function f(z) = (z^2 + 2z)/(z - 1) at z = 2 using the method of analytic continuation, we first need to find a larger domain D2 where the function can be extended analytically.\n\nThe given function f(z) has a singularity at z = 1, which is a pole of order 1. The domain D1 = {z: |z - 1| < 1} is a punctured disk centered at z = 1 with radius 1, excluding the point z = 1. To extend the function analytically, we can consider a larger domain D2 that includes the point z = 2.\n\nA suitable choice for D2 is the entire complex plane, except for the point z = 1. In other words, D2 = {z: z â‰  1}. This domain includes the point z = 2, and the function f(z) is holomorphic on D2.\n\nNow, we can compute the value of f(z) at z = 2:\n\nf(2) = (2^2 + 2*2)/(2 - 1) = (4 + 4)/1 = 8.\n\nSo, the value of the holomorphic function f(z) = (z^2 + 2z)/(z - 1) at z = 2 is 8."
