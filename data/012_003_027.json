    "message_2": "To find the maximum independent set using the greedy algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with an empty set (S) to store the independent nodes.\n2. Choose the node with the smallest degree (minimum number of edges connected to it) and add it to the set S.\n3. Remove the chosen node and its adjacent nodes from the graph.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until there are no more nodes left in the graph.\n\nNow, let's apply the greedy algorithm to the given graph:\n\n1. S = {}\n2. The nodes with the smallest degree are A, B, and F, each with a degree of 2. We can choose any of them, so let's choose A.\n3. Add A to the set S and remove A, B, and C from the graph. The remaining nodes are D, E, and F.\n4. The nodes with the smallest degree are now D and F, each with a degree of 1. Let's choose D.\n5. Add D to the set S and remove D and E from the graph. The remaining node is F.\n6. The only remaining node is F, with a degree of 0. Add F to the set S and remove it from the graph.\n7. No more nodes are left in the graph.\n\nThe maximum independent set using the greedy algorithm is S = {A, D, F}."
