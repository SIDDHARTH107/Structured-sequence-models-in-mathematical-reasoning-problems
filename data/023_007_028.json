    "message_1": "A signal x(t) has a Fourier transform given by X(jω) = 2πδ(ω - 3) + 4jδ(ω + 5), where δ represents the Dirac delta function. Find the maximum frequency component present in the signal x(t).",
    "message_2": "The Fourier transform X(jω) has two delta functions, which represent two frequency components in the signal x(t). The first delta function, 2πδ(ω - 3), corresponds to a frequency component at ω = 3 rad/s. The second delta function, 4jδ(ω + 5), corresponds to a frequency component at ω = -5 rad/s.\n\nSince we are looking for the maximum frequency component, we consider the absolute values of the frequencies. The absolute values are |3| = 3 and |-5| = 5. Therefore, the maximum frequency component present in the signal x(t) is 5 rad/s."
