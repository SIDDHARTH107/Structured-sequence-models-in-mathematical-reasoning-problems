    "message_1": "A triangle has two equal sides of length 8 cm each and an unknown base length. Find the length of the base if the total perimeter of the triangle is 24 cm.",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the base be x cm. Since the total perimeter of the triangle is 24 cm, we can write the equation:\n\n8 + 8 + x = 24\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n16 + x = 24\nx = 24 - 16\nx = 8\n\nSo, the length of the base is 8 cm."
