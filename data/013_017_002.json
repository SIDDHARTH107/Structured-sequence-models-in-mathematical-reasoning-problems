    "message_1": "In a used car market, there are two types of car owners, those who have maintained their cars and those who have not. The proportion of each type is 50%. The value of a well-maintained car is $10,000 and the value of a poorly maintained car is $4,000. The seller knows the condition of the car but the buyer does not. The seller advertises the car as well-maintained to convince buyers to pay a higher price. If the buyer believes the seller and pays an average of $9,000 for the car, what is the expected profit of the seller?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected profit of the seller, we need to consider the probabilities of selling a well-maintained car and a poorly maintained car, as well as the profit made in each case.\n\nLet's denote the profit from selling a well-maintained car as P1 and the profit from selling a poorly maintained car as P2.\n\nP1 = Selling price of well-maintained car - Actual value of well-maintained car\nP1 = $9,000 - $10,000\nP1 = -$1,000\n\nP2 = Selling price of poorly maintained car - Actual value of poorly maintained car\nP2 = $9,000 - $4,000\nP2 = $5,000\n\nNow, we need to calculate the expected profit, which is the sum of the products of the probabilities and the profits in each case.\n\nExpected profit = (Probability of selling well-maintained car * P1) + (Probability of selling poorly maintained car * P2)\n\nSince the proportion of each type of car owner is 50%, the probabilities are both 0.5.\n\nExpected profit = (0.5 * -$1,000) + (0.5 * $5,000)\nExpected profit = (-$500) + ($2,500)\nExpected profit = $2,000\n\nSo, the expected profit of the seller is $2,000."
