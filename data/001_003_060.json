    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same:\n\n1. Multiply the first equation by 4:\n   (2x + 3y) * 4 = 11 * 4\n    8x + 12y = 44\n\n2. Multiply the second equation by 3:\n   (5x - 4y) * 3 = 7 * 3\n   15x - 12y = 21\n\nNow, we have the two new equations:\n8x + 12y = 44\n15x - 12y = 21\n\nAdd the two equations to eliminate the y variable:\n(8x + 12y) + (15x - 12y) = 44 + 21\n8x + 15x = 65\n23x = 65\n\nNow, solve for x:\nx = 65 / 23\nx = 5/3\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for y. We'll use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 11\n2(5/3) + 3y = 11\n10/3 + 3y = 11\n\nSubtract 10/3 from both sides:\n3y = 11 - 10/3\n3y = 23/3\n\nNow, divide by 3:\ny = (23/3) / 3\ny = 23/9\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\nx = 5/3 and y = 23/9"
