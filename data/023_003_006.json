    "message_1": "A steel rod of length 2 meters and cross-sectional area 0.01 square meters is kept between two heat reservoirs at a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius and 90 degrees Celsius respectively. Find the steady-state temperature distribution inside the rod if its thermal conductivity is 52 W/mK using the Fourier series method.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state temperature distribution inside the rod, we will use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = k * ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is time, k is the thermal conductivity, and x is the position along the rod.\n\nSince we are looking for the steady-state temperature distribution, the temperature will not change with time, so ∂T/∂t = 0. Thus, the equation becomes:\n\n0 = k * ∂²T/∂x²\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for T(x) using the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0) = 30°C\nT(2) = 90°C\n\nTo solve this equation, we will use the Fourier series method. First, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n∂²T/∂x² = 0\n\nIntegrating once with respect to x, we get:\n\n∂T/∂x = C1\n\nIntegrating again with respect to x, we get:\n\nT(x) = C1x + C2\n\nNow, we will apply the boundary conditions to find the constants C1 and C2:\n\nT(0) = 30°C => 30 = C1 * 0 + C2 => C2 = 30\n\nT(2) = 90°C => 90 = C1 * 2 + 30 => C1 = (90 - 30) / 2 = 30\n\nSo, the steady-state temperature distribution inside the rod is given by:\n\nT(x) = 30x + 30\n\nNow, we can find the temperature at any point x along the rod using this equation."
