    "message_1": "If a scientist observes that all the observed butterflies in the field have blue spots on their wings, what is the probability that the next butterfly they observe will also have blue spots on its wings? Express your answer as a fraction. (Assuming abductive reasoning that the observation of a pattern in a collection of individual cases allows for the likelihood of a similar pattern arising in future cases.)",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot provide an exact probability without knowing the total number of butterflies observed and the proportion of butterflies with blue spots in the entire population. However, using abductive reasoning, we can infer that since all observed butterflies have blue spots, it is likely that the next butterfly will also have blue spots. \n\nTo express this as a fraction, we can use the ratio of observed butterflies with blue spots to the total number of observed butterflies. If, for example, the scientist has observed 10 butterflies and all of them have blue spots, the probability would be 10/10 or 1/1. However, this is just an example and the actual probability would depend on the specific number of observed butterflies and the proportion of butterflies with blue spots in the entire population."
