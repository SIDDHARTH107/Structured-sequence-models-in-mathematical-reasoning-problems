    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to determine the coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ. The function is an odd function, so all aₙ coefficients will be zero. We can focus on finding the bₙ coefficients.\n\nThe given function f(x) is defined as:\nf(x) = x for -π ≤ x < 0\nf(x) = -x for 0 ≤ x ≤ π\n\nThe Fourier series of an odd function is given by:\nf(x) = ∑[bₙ * sin(n * x)]\n\nTo find the bₙ coefficients, we use the formula:\nbₙ = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x) dx] from -π to π\n\nWe need to split the integral into two parts, one for each piecewise-defined part of the function:\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [∫(x * sin(n * x) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(-x * sin(n * x) dx) from 0 to π]\n\nNow, we integrate each part:\n\nFor the first integral, we use integration by parts:\nLet u = x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\nThen, du = dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\n∫(x * sin(n * x) dx) = - (x/n) * cos(n * x) - ∫((-1/n) * cos(n * x) dx)\n\nNow, integrate the remaining integral:\n∫((-1/n) * cos(n * x) dx) = (-1/n²) * sin(n * x)\n\nSo, the first integral becomes:\n∫(x * sin(n * x) dx) = - (x/n) * cos(n * x) + (1/n²) * sin(n * x)\n\nEvaluate this integral from -π to 0:\n[- (0/n) * cos(0) + (1/n²) * sin(0)] - [- (-π/n) * cos(-n * π) + (1/n²) * sin(-n * π)]\n= (π/n) * cos(n * π)\n\nFor the second integral, we also use integration by parts:\nLet u = -x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\nThen, du = -dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\n∫(-x * sin(n * x) dx) = (-x/n) * cos(n * x) - ∫(-(-1/n) * cos(n * x) dx)\n\nNow, integrate the remaining integral:\n∫(-(-1/n) * cos(n * x) dx) = (1/n²) * sin(n * x)\n\nSo, the second integral becomes:\n∫(-x * sin(n * x) dx) = (-x/n) * cos(n * x) - (1/n²) * sin(n * x)\n\nEvaluate this integral from 0 to π:\n[- (π/n) * cos(n * π) - (1/n²) * sin(n * π)] - [- (0/n) * cos(0) - (1/n²) * sin(0)]\n= -(π/n) * cos(n * π)\n\nNow, we can find bₙ:\nbₙ = (2/π) * [(π/n) * cos(n * π) - (π/n) * cos(n * π)]\nbₙ = (2/π) * (π/n) * cos(n * π) - (2/π) * (π/n) * cos(n * π)\nbₙ = (2/n) * cos(n * π)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\nf(x) = ∑[(2/n) * cos(n * π) * sin(n * x)]\n\nTo find f(π/3), we plug in x = π/3:\nf(π/3) = ∑[(2/n) * cos(n * π) * sin(n * π/3)]\n\nHowever, since f(x) = x for -π ≤ x < 0 and f(x) = -x for 0 ≤ x ≤ π, we can directly find f(π/3) without using the Fourier series:\nf(π/3) = -(π/3)"
