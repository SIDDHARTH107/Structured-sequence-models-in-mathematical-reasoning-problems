    "message_1": "Suppose there are 100 players in a Beauty Contest game, and each player is asked to select a number between 0 and 100. Each player's payoff will be 2 times the average of all the selected numbers minus the player's selected number. What would be the optimal number for a player to select in order to maximize their payoff?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the selected numbers as x1, x2, ..., x100. The average of all selected numbers is (x1 + x2 + ... + x100) / 100. Let's say a player selects the number x. Their payoff will be:\n\nPayoff = 2 * ((x1 + x2 + ... + x100) / 100) - x\n\nTo maximize the payoff, we need to find the optimal value of x. Since the player cannot control the choices of other players, they should try to predict the average value of the other players' choices. In a Beauty Contest game, players typically assume that others will choose numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 100. Therefore, the expected average value of the other players' choices would be 50.\n\nHowever, since all players are trying to maximize their payoff, they will also try to predict the average value and choose a number lower than the expected average. This reasoning can be applied iteratively, leading to a lower and lower expected average.\n\nIn practice, the optimal number to select would depend on the level of strategic thinking of the players involved. If all players are perfectly rational and have common knowledge of each other's rationality, they would all choose 0, as this would be the Nash equilibrium. However, in reality, players may not have perfect information or may not be perfectly rational, so the optimal number to select would likely be somewhere between 0 and the expected average value of the other players' choices."
