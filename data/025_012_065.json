    "message_2": "First, let's find the equation of the line passing through points P(3,4) and Q(5,1). We can use the slope-point form of a linear equation: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line.\n\nTo find the slope, we can use the formula m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Plugging in the coordinates of P and Q, we get:\n\nm = (1 - 4) / (5 - 3) = -3 / 2\n\nNow, we can use the slope-point form with point P:\n\ny - 4 = -3/2 (x - 3)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\ny = -3/2x + 9/2 + 4\ny = -3/2x + 17/2\n\nNow, we need to find the point R where this line intersects the elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 + x + 1. To do this, we can substitute the equation of the line into the equation of the curve:\n\n(-3/2x + 17/2)^2 = x^3 + x + 1\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n9/4x^2 - 51/2x + 289/4 = x^3 + x + 1\n\nMultiplying by 4 to get rid of the fractions:\n\n9x^2 - 102x + 289 = 4x^3 + 4x + 4\n\nRearranging the terms:\n\n4x^3 - 9x^2 + 106x - 285 = 0\n\nWe know that x = 3 and x = 5 are two solutions to this equation (corresponding to points P and Q). To find the x-coordinate of point R, we can use synthetic division to find the remaining factor:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 5)(4x - 19) = 0\n\nSo, the x-coordinate of point R is x = 19/4. Now, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging this value into the equation of the line:\n\ny = -3/2(19/4) + 17/2\ny = -57/4 + 34/4\ny = -23/4\n\nThus, the coordinates of point R are (19/4, -23/4)."
