    "message_1": "A manufacturer of light bulbs is interested in the mean lifetime of their product. If a sample of 50 bulbs has a mean lifetime of 1200 hours with a standard deviation of 200 hours, what is the 99% confidence interval for the population mean lifetime of the light bulbs?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 99% confidence interval for the population mean lifetime of the light bulbs, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean\nZ = Z-score (critical value) for the desired confidence level (99%)\nσ = sample standard deviation\nn = sample size\n\nGiven:\nx̄ = 1200 hours\nσ = 200 hours\nn = 50\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 99% confidence interval. For a 99% confidence interval, the Z-score is 2.576 (you can find this value in a Z-score table or using a calculator).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 1200 ± (2.576 * (200 / √50))\n\nCI = 1200 ± (2.576 * (200 / 7.071))\n\nCI = 1200 ± (2.576 * 28.284)\n\nCI = 1200 ± 72.839\n\nSo, the 99% confidence interval for the population mean lifetime of the light bulbs is:\n\nLower limit: 1200 - 72.839 = 1127.161 hours\nUpper limit: 1200 + 72.839 = 1272.839 hours\n\nThe 99% confidence interval is (1127.161, 1272.839) hours."
