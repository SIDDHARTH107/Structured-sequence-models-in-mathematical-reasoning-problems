    "message_1": "An algebra student needs to graph the inequality 3x + 2y ≤ 10 on a coordinate plane. What are the coordinates of the points that satisfy this inequality?",
    "message_2": "To graph the inequality 3x + 2y ≤ 10, we first need to find the boundary line, which is the line that separates the points that satisfy the inequality from those that do not. The boundary line is found by treating the inequality as an equation:\n\n3x + 2y = 10\n\nNow, we can find the x and y intercepts to help us graph the line. To find the x-intercept, set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x + 2(0) = 10\n3x = 10\nx = 10/3 ≈ 3.33\n\nSo, the x-intercept is (10/3, 0).\n\nTo find the y-intercept, set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\n3(0) + 2y = 10\n2y = 10\ny = 5\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 5).\n\nNow, we can graph the line 3x + 2y = 10 using the x-intercept (10/3, 0) and the y-intercept (0, 5). To determine which side of the line contains the points that satisfy the inequality, we can test a point not on the line. The origin (0, 0) is a convenient point to test:\n\n3(0) + 2(0) ≤ 10\n0 ≤ 10\n\nSince this statement is true, the origin (0, 0) satisfies the inequality, and therefore, the points that satisfy the inequality are on the same side of the line as the origin.\n\nThe coordinates of the points that satisfy the inequality 3x + 2y ≤ 10 are all the points in the region below and including the line 3x + 2y = 10."
