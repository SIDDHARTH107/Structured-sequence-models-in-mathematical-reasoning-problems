    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 125, which is a prime power (5^3), we know that G is a p-group. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exists a normal Sylow 5-subgroup in G. Let H be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G, so |H| = 5^2 = 25.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/H. Since |G| = 125 and |H| = 25, we have |G/H| = 5. Since G/H has prime order, it is cyclic, i.e., G/H is isomorphic to Z_5.\n\nLet K be a subgroup of G such that K is isomorphic to G/H. By the Correspondence Theorem, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the subgroups of G containing H and the subgroups of G/H. Thus, K is a subgroup of G of order 5.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1) G is cyclic: In this case, G is isomorphic to Z_125, which is a cyclic group of order 125.\n\n2) G is not cyclic: Since G is not cyclic, it cannot be generated by a single element. However, we have subgroups H and K of orders 25 and 5, respectively. Notice that |H ∩ K| = 1, since the only common element is the identity element. Also, |HK| = |H| * |K| / |H ∩ K| = 25 * 5 / 1 = 125. Thus, G = HK.\n\nNow, we show that G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K. Define a function φ: H × K → G by φ(h, k) = hk for all h in H and k in K. We will show that φ is an isomorphism.\n\n- φ is well-defined: For any (h, k) in H × K, hk is an element of G, so φ(h, k) is well-defined.\n\n- φ is a homomorphism: Let (h1, k1), (h2, k2) be elements of H × K. Then φ((h1, k1)(h2, k2)) = φ(h1h2, k1k2) = h1h2k1k2. Since H and K are normal subgroups, we have h1k1h2k2 = h1h2k1k2, so φ((h1, k1)(h2, k2)) = φ(h1, k1)φ(h2, k2).\n\n- φ is injective: Suppose φ(h, k) = e, where e is the identity element of G. Then hk = e, which implies h = k^(-1). Since h and k^(-1) are both in H and K, their intersection, we have h = k = e. Thus, φ is injective.\n\n- φ is surjective: For any g in G, we can write g as a product of elements from H and K, since G = HK. Thus, there exist h in H and k in K such that g = hk, which implies φ(h, k) = g. Therefore, φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a well-defined homomorphism, injective, and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which are cyclic groups of orders 25 and 5, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 125, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
