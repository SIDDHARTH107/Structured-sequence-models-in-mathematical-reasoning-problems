Then G has the following elements: {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element. We will consider the possible orders of the elements a, b, and c.\n\n1. If all elements have order 2, then G is abelian. In this case, we have the following relations:\n\n   a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e\n   ab = ba\n   ac = ca\n   bc = cb\n\nThis group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, V_4, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2: V_4 = Z_2 × Z_2.\n\n2. If one of the elements has order 4, without loss of generality, let a have order 4. Then G is cyclic, and we have the following relations:\n\n   a^4 = e\n   b = a^2\n   c = a^3\n\nThis group is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 4, Z_4.\n\nNow, we will show that these two groups are not isomorphic. Suppose there exists an isomorphism φ: Z_4 → V_4. Since Z_4 is cyclic, φ must map the generator of Z_4 to an element of order 4 in V_4. However, all elements in V_4 have order 2, so no such isomorphism can exist.\n\nTherefore, there are only two non-isomorphic groups of order 4: the cyclic group Z_4 and the Klein four-group V_4."
