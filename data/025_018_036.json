    "message_2": "A Fano variety is a smooth projective variety whose anticanonical divisor is ample. In our case, the quintic hypersurface is given by the equation $$X^5 + Y^5 + Z^5 + W^5 + T^5 + 5\\lambda XYZWT = 0$$ in the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4$. \n\nThe canonical divisor $K$ of a hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{P}^n$ is given by the formula $K = (d - n - 1)H$, where $H$ is the hyperplane divisor. In our case, $d = 5$ and $n = 4$, so the canonical divisor is $K = (5 - 4 - 1)H = 0H$. Thus, the anticanonical divisor is $-K = -0H = 0H$. \n\nFor the hypersurface to be Fano, the anticanonical divisor must be ample. However, in our case, the anticanonical divisor is 0, which is not ample. Therefore, the quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^4$ given by the equation $$X^5 + Y^5 + Z^5 + W^5 + T^5 + 5\\lambda XYZWT = 0$$ is not Fano for any value of $\\lambda$."
