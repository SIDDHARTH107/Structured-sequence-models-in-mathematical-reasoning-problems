    "message_2": "To find the probability of Team A winning all three games, you simply multiply the probability of them winning each individual game together. \n\nProbability of winning all three games = (Probability of winning Game 1) × (Probability of winning Game 2) × (Probability of winning Game 3)\n\nSince the probability of Team A winning each game is 0.6, the calculation would be:\n\n0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 = 0.216\n\nSo, the probability of Team A winning all three games is 0.216 or 21.6%."
