    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. In this case, we want to minimize the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3 in the range [0, 5]. \n\nTo find the minimum value using PSO, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of particles with random positions and velocities within the search space [0, 5].\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each particle (i.e., the value of the function f(x) at the particle's position).\n3. Update each particle's personal best position if its current position has a better fitness.\n4. Update the global best position if a particle's personal best position has a better fitness.\n5. Update the velocities and positions of the particles based on their personal best, global best, and current positions.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a minimum fitness threshold).\n\nAfter running the PSO algorithm, the global best position will be an approximation of the minimum value of the function f(x) in the range [0, 5]. However, as a mathematician, I can find the exact minimum value using calculus.\n\nTo find the minimum value of f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3, we can take the derivative of the function and set it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 2\n\nSetting f'(x) to zero:\n\n0 = 2x - 2\nx = 1\n\nNow, we can find the second derivative to check if it's a minimum:\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, we have a minimum at x = 1. Now, we can find the minimum value of the function:\n\nf(1) = (1)^2 - 2(1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3 in the range [0, 5] is 2."
