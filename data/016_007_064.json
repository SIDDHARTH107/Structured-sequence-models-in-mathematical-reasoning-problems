    "message_2": "A Menger sponge of order 3 is a fractal shape created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In the first iteration, the large cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the center cube of each face and the very center cube are removed, leaving 20 cubes. In the second iteration, the same process is applied to each of the remaining 20 cubes, and so on.\n\nIn this case, we are asked to find the volume of a Menger sponge of order 3, where each of the 20 open cubes in its second iteration has been removed. \n\nFirst, let's find the volume of a Menger sponge of order 2. In the first iteration, we have 20 cubes left. In the second iteration, each of these 20 cubes is divided into 27 smaller cubes, and 7 cubes are removed from each, leaving 20 cubes in each of the larger cubes. So, there are 20 * 20 = 400 cubes left in the second iteration.\n\nNow, let's find the volume of a Menger sponge of order 3. In the third iteration, each of the 400 cubes from the second iteration is divided into 27 smaller cubes, and 7 cubes are removed from each, leaving 20 cubes in each of the larger cubes. So, there are 400 * 20 = 8000 cubes left in the third iteration.\n\nHowever, we are asked to find the volume of a Menger sponge of order 3, where each of the 20 open cubes in its second iteration has been removed. This means we need to remove the volume of the 20 open cubes from the total volume of the Menger sponge of order 3.\n\nEach open cube in the second iteration has a volume of 20 smaller cubes. So, the total volume of the 20 open cubes is 20 * 20 = 400 smaller cubes.\n\nTherefore, the volume of a Menger sponge of order 3, where each of the 20 open cubes in its second iteration has been removed, is 8000 - 400 = 7600 smaller cubes."
