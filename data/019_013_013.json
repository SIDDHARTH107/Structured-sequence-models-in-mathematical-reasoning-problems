    "message_2": "In second-order logic, we can quantify over relations, but the question is asking for the number of possible relations on a set with 5 elements. This can be answered using combinatorics.\n\nA relation on a set with 5 elements can be represented as a subset of the Cartesian product of the set with itself. The Cartesian product of a set with 5 elements (A) with itself (AxA) will have 5 * 5 = 25 elements. Each element in the Cartesian product can either be in the relation or not, so there are 2 choices for each element.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible relations on a set with 5 elements is 2^25 = 33,554,432."
