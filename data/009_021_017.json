    "message_1": "Calculate the heat distribution in a thin metal plate with the dimensions 3 meters by 4 meters, given that the initial temperature of the plate is 50°C and the edges are kept at a constant temperature of 0°C. The thermal conductivity of the metal plate is 10 W/mK and the heat convection coefficient on the top surface is 20 W/m²K. The plate loses no heat from its bottom surface. Use the partial differential equation \n\n$${{\\partial^2 T}\\over{\\partial x^2}}+{{\\partial^2 T}\\over{\\partial y^2}}={1\\over {\\alpha}}{\\partial T\\over{\\partial t}}$$\n\nto solve the problem for time t=5 minutes.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let T(x, y, t) be the temperature distribution in the plate. We assume that T(x, y, t) can be written as the product of three functions, X(x), Y(y), and Θ(t):\n\nT(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)Θ(t)\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression into the given partial differential equation:\n\n$${{\\partial^2 T}\\over{\\partial x^2}}+{{\\partial^2 T}\\over{\\partial y^2}}={1\\over {\\alpha}}{\\partial T\\over{\\partial t}}$$\n\n$${{X''(x)Y(y)Θ(t)}\\over{X(x)Y(y)Θ(t)}}+{{X(x)Y''(y)Θ(t)}\\over{X(x)Y(y)Θ(t)}}={1\\over {\\alpha}}{{X(x)Y(y)Θ'(t)}\\over{X(x)Y(y)Θ(t)}}$$\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common terms:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\frac{Θ'(t)}{Θ(t)}$$\n\nSince the left side of the equation depends only on x and y, and the right side depends only on t, both sides must be equal to a constant. We will call this constant -λ:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -λ = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\frac{Θ'(t)}{Θ(t)}$$\n\nNow, we have three ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $$X''(x) + λX(x) = 0$$\n2) $$Y''(y) - λY(y) = 0$$\n3) $$Θ'(t) + λαΘ(t) = 0$$\n\nWe will solve these equations with the given boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = X(3) = 0\nY(0) = Y(4) = 0\n\nFor equation 1, the solution is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\sin(\\sqrt{λ}x)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$$X(0) = A\\sin(0) = 0$$\n$$X(3) = A\\sin(3\\sqrt{λ}) = 0$$\n\nFor the second condition to be true, 3√λ must be an integer multiple of π:\n\n$$3\\sqrt{λ} = n\\pi$$\n$$λ = \\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{9}$$\n\nFor equation 2, the solution is:\n\n$$Y(y) = B\\sin(\\sqrt{λ}y)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$$Y(0) = B\\sin(0) = 0$$\n$$Y(4) = B\\sin(4\\sqrt{λ}) = 0$$\n\nFor the second condition to be true, 4√λ must be an integer multiple of π:\n\n$$4\\sqrt{λ} = m\\pi$$\n$$λ = \\frac{m^2\\pi^2}{16}$$\n\nFor equation 3, the solution is:\n\n$$Θ(t) = Ce^{-λαt}$$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for T(x, y, t) as a sum of the product of these functions:\n\n$$T(x, y, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}A_{nm}\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{3}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi y}{4}\\right)e^{-\\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{9}αt}e^{-\\frac{m^2\\pi^2}{16}αt}$$\n\nTo find the coefficients A_nm, we need to use the initial condition T(x, y, 0) = 50°C:\n\n$$50 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}A_{nm}\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{3}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi y}{4}\\right)$$\n\nWe can find A_nm using the following formula:\n\n$$A_{nm} = \\frac{9}{\\pi^2}\\frac{16}{\\pi^2}\\int_0^3\\int_0^4 50\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{3}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi y}{4}\\right)dxdy$$\n\nNow, we have all the information needed to calculate the heat distribution in the plate at time t = 5 minutes. However, calculating the exact values for A_nm and T(x, y, t) requires numerical methods, which are beyond the scope of this response."
