    "message_1": "A math student learned about causal logic and is now tasked with solving a problem related to it. Let's say there are 5 friends who decided to each flip a coin. Out of the 5 friends, 3 of them got heads and 2 of them got tails. What is the probability that the friends who got heads caused the friends who got tails to also get tails?",
    "message_2": "In this scenario, the coin flips are independent events, meaning that the outcome of one coin flip does not affect the outcome of another coin flip. Therefore, the friends who got heads cannot cause the friends who got tails to also get tails. The probability of this happening is 0."
