    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. The production process requires three resources: labor hours, machine hours, and raw materials. The company has a maximum of 900 labor hours, 600 machine hours, and 225 raw materials available per day. Each unit of Product A requires 3 labor hours, 4 machine hours, and 1 unit of raw material. Each unit of Product B requires 5 labor hours, 3 machine hours, and 2 units of raw material. \n\nIf the profit per unit of Product A is $10 and per unit of Product B is $12, find the optimal production quantities of each type of product that will maximize the total profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. We want to maximize the total profit, which can be represented by the objective function:\n\nP = 10x + 12y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n3x + 5y ≤ 900 (labor hours)\n4x + 3y ≤ 600 (machine hours)\nx + 2y ≤ 225 (raw materials)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nTo find the optimal production quantities, we will use the graphical method to solve this linear programming problem. First, we will graph the constraint inequalities on the xy-plane:\n\n1. 3x + 5y ≤ 900\ny ≤ (900 - 3x) / 5\n\n2. 4x + 3y ≤ 600\ny ≤ (600 - 4x) / 3\n\n3. x + 2y ≤ 225\ny ≤ (225 - x) / 2\n\n4. x ≥ 0\n5. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of all the constraints. We will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:\n\n1. Intersection of lines 1 and 2:\n3x + 5y = 900\n4x + 3y = 600\n\nSolving this system, we get x = 60 and y = 132.\n\n2. Intersection of lines 1 and 3:\n3x + 5y = 900\nx + 2y = 225\n\nSolving this system, we get x = 75 and y = 75.\n\n3. Intersection of lines 2 and 3:\n4x + 3y = 600\nx + 2y = 225\n\nSolving this system, we get x = 150 and y = 37.5.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 10x + 12y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(60, 132) = 10(60) + 12(132) = 600 + 1584 = 2184\n2. P(75, 75) = 10(75) + 12(75) = 750 + 900 = 1650\n3. P(150, 37.5) = 10(150) + 12(37.5) = 1500 + 450 = 1950\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (60, 132), with a total profit of $2184. Therefore, the optimal production quantities are 60 units of Product A and 132 units of Product B."
