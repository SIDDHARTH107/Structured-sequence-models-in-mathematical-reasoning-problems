    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation $z^2 + 4z + 13 = 0$, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$$z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = 4$, and $c = 13$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$z = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(13)}}{2(1)}$$\n\n$$z = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 52}}{2}$$\n\n$$z = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-36}}{2}$$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we know that there will be complex solutions. We can rewrite the square root of a negative number as the product of the square root of the positive number and the imaginary unit $i$:\n\n$$z = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{36}i}{2}$$\n\n$$z = \\frac{-4 \\pm 6i}{2}$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\n$$z = -2 \\pm 3i$$\n\nSo, the complex solutions to the equation $z^2 + 4z + 13 = 0$ are $z = -2 + 3i$ and $z = -2 - 3i$."
