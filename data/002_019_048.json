    "message_2": "To calculate the total surface area of a right circular cone, we need to find the sum of the base area and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe base area (A_base) of a cone can be found using the formula:\n\nA_base = π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the base radius.\n\nA_base = π * (5 cm)^2\nA_base = π * 25 cm^2\nA_base ≈ 78.54 cm^2\n\nTo find the lateral surface area (A_lateral), we first need to find the slant height (l) of the cone. We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this:\n\nl = √(h^2 + r^2)\n\nwhere h is the height of the cone.\n\nl = √((8 cm)^2 + (5 cm)^2)\nl = √(64 cm^2 + 25 cm^2)\nl = √89 cm^2\nl ≈ 9.43 cm\n\nNow we can find the lateral surface area using the formula:\n\nA_lateral = π * r * l\n\nA_lateral = π * (5 cm) * (9.43 cm)\nA_lateral ≈ 148.41 cm^2\n\nFinally, we can find the total surface area (A_total) by adding the base area and the lateral surface area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total ≈ 78.54 cm^2 + 148.41 cm^2\nA_total ≈ 226.95 cm^2\n\nThe total surface area of the right circular cone is approximately 226.95 cm^2."
