    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product AxB. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as AxB, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nAxB = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A with B. The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, is the set of all elements that are common to both A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = {} (empty set, since there are no common elements between A and B)\n\nNow, we need to prove that (A ∩ B) × (A ∩ B) is a subset of (A × A) ∩ (B × B).\n\n(A ∩ B) × (A ∩ B) = {} × {} = {} (empty set, since there are no elements in A ∩ B)\n\nNow, let's find (A × A) and (B × B):\n\nA × A = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}\nB × B = {(3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A × A) and (B × B):\n\n(A × A) ∩ (B × B) = {} (empty set, since there are no common elements between A × A and B × B)\n\nSince both (A ∩ B) × (A ∩ B) and (A × A) ∩ (B × B) are empty sets, we can conclude that (A ∩ B) × (A ∩ B) is a subset of (A × A) ∩ (B × B), as the empty set is a subset of any set."
