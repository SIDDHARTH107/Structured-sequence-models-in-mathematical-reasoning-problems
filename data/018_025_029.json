The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nSo, A △ B = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) ∩ B:\n\n(A △ B) ∩ B = {1, 5} ∩ {2, 3, 4, 5} = {5}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B △ A:\n\nB △ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB ∩ A = {2, 3, 4}\n\nSo, B △ A = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find (B △ A) ∩ A:\n\n(B △ A) ∩ A = {1, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4} = {1}\n\nWe have found that (A △ B) ∩ B = {5} and (B △ A) ∩ A = {1}. Since {5} ≠ {1}, this shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
