    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 256 is divided by 17 using modular arithmetic, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Write the given number (256) in the form of 17 * k + r, where k is an integer and r is the remainder.\n2. Find the smallest value of k for which the equation holds true.\n\n256 = 17 * k + r\n\nDividing 256 by 17, we get:\n\n256 รท 17 = 15 (with a remainder of 1)\n\nSo, k = 15 and r = 1.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 256 is divided by 17 is 1."
