    "message_2": "(a) A = {0} U {1/2^n | n∈N}\n\nTo determine if A is compact, we need to show that every open cover of A has a finite subcover. Let's consider an arbitrary open cover of A, which we'll call {U_i}. Since 0 is an element of A, there must be some open set U_0 in the open cover that contains 0. Since U_0 is open, there exists an ε > 0 such that the interval (0 - ε, 0 + ε) is contained in U_0.\n\nNow, let's consider the sequence {1/2^n}. Since 1/2^n converges to 0 as n approaches infinity, there exists an N such that for all n > N, 1/2^n < ε. This means that for all n > N, 1/2^n is contained in U_0. Therefore, we can find a finite subcover of A consisting of U_0 and the open sets containing 1/2^n for n = 1, 2, ..., N. Thus, A is compact.\n\n(b) B = {1/n | n∈N} U {0}\n\nTo determine if B is compact, we need to show that every open cover of B has a finite subcover. Let's consider an arbitrary open cover of B, which we'll call {V_i}. Since 0 is an element of B, there must be some open set V_0 in the open cover that contains 0. Since V_0 is open, there exists an δ > 0 such that the interval (0 - δ, 0 + δ) is contained in V_0.\n\nNow, let's consider the sequence {1/n}. Since 1/n converges to 0 as n approaches infinity, there exists an M such that for all n > M, 1/n < δ. This means that for all n > M, 1/n is contained in V_0. Therefore, we can find a finite subcover of B consisting of V_0 and the open sets containing 1/n for n = 1, 2, ..., M. Thus, B is compact.\n\nIn conclusion, both subsets A and B are compact."
