    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of hours John needed to study to achieve a score of 95, we can set up an equation:\n\n80 + 5x = 95\n\nWhere x is the number of hours John needs to study.\n\nSubtract 80 from both sides of the equation:\n\n5x = 15\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\nx = 3\n\nSo, John needed to study for a minimum of 3 hours to achieve a score of 95 on his math test."
