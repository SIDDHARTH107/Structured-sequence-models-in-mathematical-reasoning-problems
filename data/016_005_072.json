    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each line segment. After each iteration, the remaining length is (2/3) times the length of the previous iteration. \n\nLet's calculate the length of the Cantor set after the first four iterations:\n\n1. Original length: 27\n2. First iteration: (2/3) * 27 = 18\n3. Second iteration: (2/3) * 18 = 12\n4. Third iteration: (2/3) * 12 = 8\n5. Fourth iteration: (2/3) * 8 = 16/3\n\nSo, the length of the Cantor set after the first four iterations of construction is 16/3."
