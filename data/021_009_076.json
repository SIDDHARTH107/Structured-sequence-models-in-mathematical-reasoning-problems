    "message_2": "To use the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5 with respect to x. This will give us the gradient (slope) of the function at any point x.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 4\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent method to find the minimum value of the function on the interval [0, 5]. We start with an initial guess of x = 4 and a step size of 0.1.\n\n1. Calculate the gradient at the initial guess: f'(4) = 2(4) - 4 = 4\n2. Update the guess: x_new = x_old - step_size * gradient = 4 - 0.1 * 4 = 3.6\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the gradient is close to 0 or the guess is outside the interval [0, 5].\n\nIteration 1:\nx_old = 4\ngradient = 4\nx_new = 3.6\n\nIteration 2:\nx_old = 3.6\ngradient = 2(3.6) - 4 = 3.2\nx_new = 3.6 - 0.1 * 3.2 = 3.28\n\nIteration 3:\nx_old = 3.28\ngradient = 2(3.28) - 4 = 2.56\nx_new = 3.28 - 0.1 * 2.56 = 3.024\n\nIteration 4:\nx_old = 3.024\ngradient = 2(3.024) - 4 = 2.048\nx_new = 3.024 - 0.1 * 2.048 = 2.8232\n\nWe can continue this process until the gradient is close to 0 or the guess is outside the interval [0, 5]. For simplicity, let's stop here.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of the function at x = 2.8232:\n\nf(2.8232) = (2.8232)^2 - 4(2.8232) + 5 â‰ˆ 0.3085\n\nSo, using the gradient descent method with a step size of 0.1 and an initial guess of x = 4, we find that the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5 on the interval [0, 5] is approximately 0.3085."
