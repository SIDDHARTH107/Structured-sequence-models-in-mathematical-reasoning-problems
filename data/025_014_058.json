    "message_2": "To compute the Riemann theta function, we first need to find the divisor $(P-Q)/2$. In order to do this, we need to perform the group operation on the elliptic curve $E$.\n\nRecall that the group operation on an elliptic curve is given by the following formulas:\n\nLet $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ be two points on the elliptic curve $E$. Then, the sum $P + Q = (x_3, y_3)$ is given by:\n\n1. If $x_1 \\neq x_2$, then\n$$\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$\n$$\nx_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2\n$$\n$$\ny_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1\n$$\n\n2. If $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = -y_2$, then $P + Q = \\mathcal{O}$, where $\\mathcal{O}$ is the point at infinity.\n\n3. If $P = Q$, then\n$$\nm = \\frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1}\n$$\n$$\nx_3 = m^2 - 2x_1\n$$\n$$\ny_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1\n$$\n\nwhere $a$ is the coefficient of the $x$ term in the elliptic curve equation.\n\nNow, let's compute $P - Q$. Since $P \\neq Q$ and $P \\neq -Q$, we use the first formula:\n\n$$\nm = \\frac{-6 - 1}{3 - 2} = -7\n$$\n$$\nx_3 = (-7)^2 - 2 - 3 = 45\n$$\n$$\ny_3 = -7(2 - 45) - 1 = 308\n$$\n\nSo, $P - Q = (45, 308)$. Now, we need to find $(P-Q)/2$. Since the elliptic curve group operation is not closed under scalar multiplication, we cannot directly compute $(P-Q)/2$. However, we can find a point $R$ such that $2R = P-Q$.\n\nTo find $R$, we use the third formula for the group operation:\n\nLet $R = (x, y)$, then\n$$\n2R = (45, 308)\n$$\n$$\nm = \\frac{3x^2 + 5}{2y}\n$$\n$$\n45 = m^2 - 2x\n$$\n$$\n308 = m(x - 45) - y\n$$\n\nSolving this system of equations is quite difficult, and it is not guaranteed that there exists a point $R$ satisfying these conditions. Therefore, it is not possible to compute the Riemann theta function $\\theta_{(P-Q)/2}(0,\\tau)$ in this case."
