    "message_2": "This is a quadratic expression in terms of x² and y². We can rewrite the expression as:\n\n(2x²)² - 2(2x²)(3y²) + (3y²)²\n\nNow, we can see that this is a perfect square trinomial of the form (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b², where a = 2x² and b = 3y².\n\nSo, the factorization of the given polynomial expression is:\n\n(2x² - 3y²)²"
