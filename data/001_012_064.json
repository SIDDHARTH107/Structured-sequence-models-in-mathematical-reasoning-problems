    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: (8x^2 - 2x)\nFactor out the common term 2x:\n2x(4x - 1)\n\nDenominator: (4x^3 - 8x)\nFactor out the common term 4x:\n4x(x^2 - 2)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(2x(4x - 1)) / (4x(x^2 - 2))\n\nWe can now cancel out the common term 2x from both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n(4x - 1) / (2(x^2 - 2))\n\nThis is the simplified form of the given rational expression."
