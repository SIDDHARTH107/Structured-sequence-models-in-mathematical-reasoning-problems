    "message_1": "A city experiences rainy days for 1/4 of the year. What is the probability that the city has at least 4 rainy days in a row during any given month of the year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of having at least 4 rainy days in a row during any given month of the year. We will assume that the year has 365 days and that each month has 30 days for simplicity.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of having a rainy day:\nRainy days = 1/4 * 365 = 91.25 ≈ 91 rainy days\nTotal days = 365 days\nProbability of a rainy day (R) = 91/365 ≈ 0.2493\n\nNow, let's find the probability of not having a rainy day (not rainy day = N):\nProbability of not having a rainy day (N) = 1 - 0.2493 ≈ 0.7507\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 4 rainy days in a row (RRRR) during any given month (30 days). To do this, we can find the probability of not having 4 rainy days in a row and subtract it from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of not having 4 rainy days in a row in a 4-day period:\nP(not RRRR in 4 days) = 1 - P(RRRR)\nP(RRRR) = P(R) * P(R) * P(R) * P(R) = (0.2493)^4 ≈ 0.0038\nP(not RRRR in 4 days) = 1 - 0.0038 = 0.9962\n\nNow, let's find the probability of not having 4 rainy days in a row in a 30-day month. We have 27 possible 4-day periods in a 30-day month (1-4, 2-5, 3-6, ..., 27-30). \n\nP(not RRRR in 30 days) = P(not RRRR in 4 days) ^ 27 ≈ (0.9962)^27 ≈ 0.7859\n\nFinally, let's find the probability of having at least 4 rainy days in a row in a 30-day month:\nP(at least 4 R in a row in 30 days) = 1 - P(not RRRR in 30 days) = 1 - 0.7859 ≈ 0.2141\n\nSo, the probability that the city has at least 4 rainy days in a row during any given month of the year is approximately 0.2141 or 21.41%."
