Determine the number of possible abelian groups using the formula: p(n) = p(n1) * p(n2) * ... * p(nk), where p(n) is the number of partitions of n, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the exponents of the prime factors in the factorization of the group order. In this case, p(3) = 2, p(1) = 1, and p(1) = 1, so p(120) = 2 * 1 * 1 = 2. There are two abelian groups of order 120: Z_120 and Z_2^3 x Z_3 x Z_5.\n3. Determine the number of non-abelian groups using the formula: n(G) = (g - a) / 2, where n(G) is the number of non-abelian groups, g is the total number of groups, and a is the number of abelian groups. In this case, we need to find the total number of groups of order 120.\n\nTo find the total number of groups of order 120, we can use the following formula:\n\ng = (p1 + 1)(p2 + 1)...(pk + 1), where p1, p2, ..., pk are the prime factors of the group order. In this case, g = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 * 2 * 2 = 16.\n\nNow, we can find the number of non-abelian groups:\n\nn(G) = (g - a) / 2 = (16 - 2) / 2 = 7\n\nThere are 7 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nIn total, there are 2 abelian groups + 7 non-abelian groups = 9 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
