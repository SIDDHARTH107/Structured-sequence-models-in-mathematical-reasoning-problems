    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n2x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5\n2x = 12\n\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n2x / 2 = 12 / 2\nx = 6\n\nSo, the solution is x = 6."
