    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p. \n\nIn our case, p = 17 (which is a prime number) and a = 7. According to Fermat's Little Theorem, we have:\n\n7^17 ≡ 7 (mod 17)\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when 7^19 is divided by 17. We can rewrite 7^19 as:\n\n7^19 = (7^17) * (7^2)\n\nUsing the result from Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n(7^17) * (7^2) ≡ 7 * (7^2) (mod 17)\n\nNow, we just need to compute 7 * (7^2) modulo 17:\n\n7 * (7^2) = 7 * 49 = 343\n\nNow, let's find the remainder when 343 is divided by 17:\n\n343 mod 17 = 1\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^19 is divided by 17 is 1."
