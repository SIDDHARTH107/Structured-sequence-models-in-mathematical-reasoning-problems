    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(x) + 1 = sin(2x), we will first use the double angle identity for sine, which is sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x). So, the equation becomes:\n\n2sin(x) + 1 = 2sin(x)cos(x)\n\nNow, let's isolate the terms with sin(x):\n\n2sin(x) - 2sin(x)cos(x) = -1\n\nFactor out 2sin(x):\n\n2sin(x)(1 - cos(x)) = -1\n\nNow, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: 2sin(x) = -1\nSince sin(x) has a range of -1 to 1, there is no solution for this case, as -1/2 is not within the range of 2sin(x).\n\nCase 2: 1 - cos(x) = 1\nThis implies that cos(x) = 0. The values of x between 0 and 360 degrees that satisfy this condition are x = 90 degrees and x = 270 degrees.\n\nSo, the values of x that satisfy the given equation are x = 90 degrees and x = 270 degrees."
