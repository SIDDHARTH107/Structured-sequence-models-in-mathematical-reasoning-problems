    "message_1": "A string that is 2 meters long is fixed at both ends. If it is plucked so that it vibrates in its fundamental mode with a frequency of 100 Hz, find the equation that describes the wave motion and determine the amplitude of the wave at the point 0.5 meters from one end of the string. Assume the wave travels at a speed of 300 m/s.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation that describes the wave motion, we need to determine the wavelength, amplitude, and phase constant of the wave. \n\nFirst, let's find the wavelength. Since the string is fixed at both ends and vibrates in its fundamental mode, the wavelength is twice the length of the string. Therefore, the wavelength (λ) is:\n\nλ = 2 * 2 = 4 meters\n\nNext, we can find the wave number (k), which is related to the wavelength by the equation:\n\nk = 2π / λ\n\nSubstituting the value of λ, we get:\n\nk = 2π / 4 = π / 2\n\nNow, we can find the angular frequency (ω) using the given frequency (f) of 100 Hz:\n\nω = 2πf = 2π * 100 = 200π rad/s\n\nThe wave equation for a sinusoidal wave traveling in the positive x-direction is given by:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin(kx - ωt + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, x is the position along the string, t is the time, and φ is the phase constant. Since the string is fixed at both ends, the phase constant (φ) is 0. So, the wave equation becomes:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin(kx - ωt)\n\nNow, we need to determine the amplitude (A) of the wave at the point 0.5 meters from one end of the string. Since the string is vibrating in its fundamental mode, the amplitude is maximum at the midpoint of the string and zero at the ends. The amplitude at a distance of 0.5 meters from one end can be found by evaluating the wave equation at x = 0.5 meters and t = 0:\n\ny(0.5, 0) = A * sin(k * 0.5 - ω * 0)\n\ny(0.5, 0) = A * sin(π / 2 * 0.5)\n\ny(0.5, 0) = A * sin(π / 4)\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of A, we can only express the amplitude at the point 0.5 meters from one end of the string in terms of A:\n\nAmplitude at x = 0.5 meters = A * sin(π / 4)\n\nSo, the equation that describes the wave motion is:\n\ny(x, t) = A * sin(π / 2 * x - 200π * t)\n\nAnd the amplitude at the point 0.5 meters from one end of the string is:\n\nAmplitude = A * sin(π / 4)"
