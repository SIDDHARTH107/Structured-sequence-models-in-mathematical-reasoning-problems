    "message_1": "What is the singular locus of the algebraic variety defined by the equation $x^2 + y^2 - z^3 = 0$?\n\nTo solve this problem, the student needs to find the points in three-dimensional space where the equation is not smooth (i.e. not differentiable). The singular locus of the variety is the set of such points.",
    "message_2": "To find the singular locus of the algebraic variety defined by the equation $x^2 + y^2 - z^3 = 0$, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to each variable and find the points where all of them vanish simultaneously.\n\nLet $f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^3$. Then, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = -3z^2$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y, z)$ where all these partial derivatives vanish simultaneously, i.e.,\n\n$2x = 0$\n\n$2y = 0$\n\n$-3z^2 = 0$\n\nSolving these equations, we get $x = 0$, $y = 0$, and $z = 0$. Therefore, the singular locus of the algebraic variety defined by the equation $x^2 + y^2 - z^3 = 0$ is the point $(0, 0, 0)$."
