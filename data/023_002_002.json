The Fourier series of a function f(x) defined on the interval [-π, π] can be represented as:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the coefficients a_n and b_n are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nFor the function f(x) = x, we have:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x dx = 0 (since the integral of x over a symmetric interval around the origin is zero)\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(nx) dx = 0 (since the integral of an odd function times an even function over a symmetric interval around the origin is zero)\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx\n\nWe can solve this integral by integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\nThen, du = dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(nx) - ∫(-1/n) * cos(nx) dx] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-π/n) * cos(nπ) + (π/n) * cos(-nπ) + (1/n^2) * sin(nx)] evaluated from -π to π\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and sin(nx) is an odd function:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1)^n * (2π/n) + 0] = (-1)^n * (2/n)\n\nNow we have the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(-1)^n * (2/n) * sin(nx)]\n\nThis Fourier series converges pointwise to the function f(x) = x on the interval (-π, π). However, at the endpoints x = -π and x = π, the Fourier series converges to the average value of the function at these points, which is zero in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x converges pointwise to the function itself on the interval (-π, π) and converges to zero at the endpoints x = -π and x = π."
