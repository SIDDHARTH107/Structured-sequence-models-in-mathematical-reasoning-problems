    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The production of one unit of A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time, while the production of one unit of B requires 2 hours of labor and 4 hours of machine time. Each unit of A earns the company a profit of $100, and each unit of B earns a profit of $200. The company has 900 hours of labor available and 1200 hours of machine time available. Find the optimal production strategy for the company to maximize its profit while satisfying its labor and machine time constraints.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 100x + 200y, subject to the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 900 (labor constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 1200 (machine time constraint)\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\nLabor constraint: y ≥ (900 - 3x) / 2\nMachine time constraint: y ≤ (1200 - 2x) / 4\n\nNow we will find the feasible region by graphing these inequalities:\n\n1. Labor constraint: y = (900 - 3x) / 2\n2. Machine time constraint: y = (1200 - 2x) / 4\n\nIntersection points:\n1. Intersection of labor constraint and y-axis (x=0): y = (900 - 3*0) / 2 = 450\n2. Intersection of machine time constraint and y-axis (x=0): y = (1200 - 2*0) / 4 = 300\n3. Intersection of labor constraint and x-axis (y=0): x = (900 - 2*0) / 3 = 300\n4. Intersection of machine time constraint and x-axis (y=0): x = (1200 - 4*0) / 2 = 600\n5. Intersection of labor constraint and machine time constraint: \n   3x + 2y = 900\n   2x + 4y = 1200\n   Solving these equations simultaneously:\n   Multiply the first equation by 2: 6x + 4y = 1800\n   Subtract the second equation from the first: 4x = 600 => x = 150\n   Substitute x back into the labor constraint equation: 3(150) + 2y = 900 => y = 225\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices (0, 300), (0, 450), (150, 225), and (300, 0).\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 100x + 200y at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 300) = 100(0) + 200(300) = $60,000\n2. P(0, 450) = 100(0) + 200(450) = $90,000\n3. P(150, 225) = 100(150) + 200(225) = $60,000\n4. P(300, 0) = 100(300) + 200(0) = $30,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex (0, 450), with a profit of $90,000. Therefore, the optimal production strategy is to produce 0 units of product A and 450 units of product B."
