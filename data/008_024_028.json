    "message_2": "First, we can observe that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n6x/2 + 4y/2 = 20/2\n3x + 2y = 10\n\nNow we have two identical equations:\n\n3x + 2y = 10\n3x + 2y = 10\n\nSince the equations are the same, they represent the same line in the xy-plane. This means that there are infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line is a solution to the system of equations.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y in terms of x:\n\n2y = 10 - 3x\ny = (10 - 3x)/2\n\nNow we have the general solution for the system of equations:\n\ny = (10 - 3x)/2\n\nThis equation represents all the possible solutions for the given system of linear equations."
