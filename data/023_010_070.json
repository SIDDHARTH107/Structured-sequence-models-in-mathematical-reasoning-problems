    "message_2": "To find the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the function f(x, y) = x^2 * sin(y) for -π ≤ x, y ≤ π, we will use the following formula:\n\nF(u, v) = ∫∫ f(x, y) * e^(-j(ux + vy)) dx dy\n\nwhere F(u, v) is the Fourier transform of f(x, y), and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1).\n\nFirst, let's separate the function into two parts: f(x, y) = g(x) * h(y), where g(x) = x^2 and h(y) = sin(y).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the Fourier transform as a product of two one-dimensional Fourier transforms:\n\nF(u, v) = [∫ g(x) * e^(-jux) dx] * [∫ h(y) * e^(-jvy) dy]\n\nLet's find the Fourier transform of g(x) and h(y) separately:\n\nG(u) = ∫ g(x) * e^(-jux) dx = ∫ x^2 * e^(-jux) dx, for -π ≤ x ≤ π\n\nH(v) = ∫ h(y) * e^(-jvy) dy = ∫ sin(y) * e^(-jvy) dy, for -π ≤ y ≤ π\n\nTo find G(u), we can use integration by parts twice:\n\nLet u = x^2, dv = e^(-jux) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = (-1/j) * e^(-jux)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\nG(u) = (-1/j) * x^2 * e^(-jux) | from -π to π - 2 * ∫ x * e^(-jux) dx\n\nNow, let u = x, dv = e^(-jux) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1/j) * e^(-jux)\n\nUsing integration by parts again:\n\nG(u) = (-1/j) * x^2 * e^(-jux) | from -π to π + 2 * [(1/j^2) * x * e^(-jux) | from -π to π - (1/j^2) * ∫ e^(-jux) dx]\n\nG(u) = (-1/j) * x^2 * e^(-jux) | from -π to π + 2 * [(1/j^2) * x * e^(-jux) | from -π to π + (1/j^3) * e^(-jux) | from -π to π]\n\nAfter evaluating the limits, we get:\n\nG(u) = (2π^2 - 2/j^2) / (u^2 + 1)^2\n\nTo find H(v), we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = e^(-jvy), dv = sin(y) dy\ndu = -jv * e^(-jvy) dy, v = -cos(y)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\nH(v) = -e^(-jvy) * cos(y) | from -π to π + jv * ∫ e^(-jvy) * cos(y) dy\n\nThe integral ∫ e^(-jvy) * cos(y) dy is an odd function, so its integral over a symmetric interval is zero:\n\nH(v) = -e^(-jvy) * cos(y) | from -π to π = 2 * (1 - e^(-jvπ))\n\nNow, we can find the two-dimensional Fourier transform F(u, v):\n\nF(u, v) = G(u) * H(v) = [(2π^2 - 2/j^2) / (u^2 + 1)^2] * [2 * (1 - e^(-jvπ))]\n\nF(u, v) = (4π^2 - 4/j^2) * (1 - e^(-jvπ)) / (u^2 + 1)^2"
