    "message_2": "To determine the possible values of the Milnor number of X at the origin, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The Milnor number, μ, is a topological invariant that measures the singularity of a complex algebraic variety at a given point.\n2. The Milnor number is related to the Euler characteristic of the link of the singularity, which is given by the formula: χ(L) = μ + 1.\n3. The intersection cohomology of X, denoted by IH(X), is a refinement of the singular cohomology that takes into account the singularities of the variety.\n4. The rank of the intersection cohomology, denoted by rk(IH(X)), is the sum of the Betti numbers of the intersection cohomology groups.\n\nSince the intersection cohomology of X has rank 2, we have:\n\nrk(IH(X)) = b_0 + b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for the Betti numbers:\n\nCase 1: b_0 = 1, b_4 = 1, and b_1 = b_2 = b_3 = 0.\nIn this case, the Euler characteristic of X is χ(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + 0 - 0 + 1 = 2. Since the link of the singularity is a 3-dimensional sphere, its Euler characteristic is χ(L) = 0. Using the formula χ(L) = μ + 1, we get μ = -1. However, the Milnor number must be non-negative, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: b_2 = 2, and b_0 = b_1 = b_3 = b_4 = 0.\nIn this case, the Euler characteristic of X is χ(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 0 - 0 + 2 - 0 + 0 = 2. Since the link of the singularity is a 3-dimensional sphere, its Euler characteristic is χ(L) = 0. Using the formula χ(L) = μ + 1, we get μ = -1. Again, this case is not possible due to the non-negativity of the Milnor number.\n\nCase 3: b_1 = 1, b_3 = 1, and b_0 = b_2 = b_4 = 0.\nIn this case, the Euler characteristic of X is χ(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 = -2. Since the link of the singularity is a 3-dimensional sphere, its Euler characteristic is χ(L) = 0. Using the formula χ(L) = μ + 1, we get μ = -1. This case is also not possible due to the non-negativity of the Milnor number.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we conclude that there are no possible values for the Milnor number of X at the origin under the given conditions. This implies that the given conditions are not consistent with each other, and there is no complex algebraic variety X of dimension 4 with an isolated singularity at the origin and intersection cohomology of rank 2."
