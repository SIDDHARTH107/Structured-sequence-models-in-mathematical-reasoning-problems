    "message_1": "Sorry, but it is not possible to create a precise numerical problem for the subtopic \"Paraconsistent logic\" as it deals with reasoning in systems where contradictions are allowed. Paraconsistent logic is not really a numerical subject and does not involve any specific numerical calculations. Instead, it deals with the consistency of logical arguments. Perhaps you can provide a more general question related to Paraconsistent logic for me to assist you better?",
    "message_2": "You're right, paraconsistent logic is not a numerical subject. If you have any questions or need clarification about the concepts, principles, or applications of paraconsistent logic, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help."
