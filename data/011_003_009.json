    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of the term x^3y^5 in the expansion of (x + y)^8, we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that for any non-negative integer n and any real numbers x and y:\n\n(x + y)^n = Î£ [C(n, k) * x^(n-k) * y^k], where the sum is from k=0 to k=n, and C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn our case, n = 8, and we want the term with x^3y^5, so we need to find the coefficient when k = 5 (since x^(n-k) = x^3 and y^k = y^5).\n\nC(8, 5) = 8! / (5!(8-5)!) = 8! / (5!3!) = (8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((5*4*3*2*1)*(3*2*1))\n\nCancelling out the common terms, we get:\n\nC(8, 5) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 8*7*6 / 6 = 8*7 = 56\n\nSo, the coefficient of the term x^3y^5 in the expansion of (x + y)^8 is 56."
