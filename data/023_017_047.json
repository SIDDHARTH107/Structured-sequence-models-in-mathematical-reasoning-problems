    "message_2": "The Fourier transform is not the appropriate method to solve this problem. Instead, we can use Torricelli's law, which relates the speed of fluid flowing out of an orifice to the height of fluid above the opening.\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the water in the tank:\nVolume = π * (radius of tank)^2 * height of water\nVolume = π * (5m)^2 * 5m\nVolume = 125π m^3\n\nNow, let's find the area of the hole:\nArea = π * (radius of hole)^2\nArea = π * (0.02m)^2\nArea = 0.001256π m^2\n\nAccording to Torricelli's law, the speed of the water flowing out of the hole is given by:\nv = √(2 * g * h)\nwhere v is the speed of the water, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), and h is the height of the water above the hole (5m in this case).\n\nv = √(2 * 9.81 m/s^2 * 5m)\nv ≈ 9.95 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the flow rate (Q) of the water leaving the tank:\nQ = Area of hole * speed of water\nQ = 0.001256π m^2 * 9.95 m/s\nQ ≈ 0.0125 m^3/s\n\nFinally, we can find the time it takes for the tank to completely empty:\nTime = Volume of water / Flow rate\nTime = (125π m^3) / (0.0125 m^3/s)\nTime ≈ 10000 s\n\nIt will take approximately 10000 seconds for the tank to completely empty."
