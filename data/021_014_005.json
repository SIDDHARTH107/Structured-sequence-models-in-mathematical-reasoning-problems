    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products A and B, which require the use of two production machines X and Y. To produce one unit of A requires 4 hours of machine X and 2 hours of machine Y, whereas to produce one unit of B requires 4 hours of machine X and 4 hours of machine Y. The company has 100 hours of machine X and 86 hours of machine Y available each week. If the profit per unit is £30 for A and £40 for B, how many units of each should be produced each week to maximize profit using genetic algorithms?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using genetic algorithms, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the problem and constraints.\n2. Create an initial population.\n3. Define the fitness function.\n4. Perform selection, crossover, and mutation.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a stopping condition is met.\n\nStep 1: Define the problem and constraints\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\nConstraints:\n4x + 4y ≤ 100 (machine X hours)\n2x + 4y ≤ 86 (machine Y hours)\nx, y ≥ 0 (non-negative production)\n\nStep 2: Create an initial population\nGenerate random pairs of (x, y) within the constraints. For example, let's create 10 pairs:\n\n[(10, 15), (5, 10), (12, 8), (8, 12), (15, 5), (20, 0), (0, 20), (7, 14), (14, 7), (18, 2)]\n\nStep 3: Define the fitness function\nThe fitness function is the profit function, which we want to maximize:\nP(x, y) = 30x + 40y\n\nStep 4: Perform selection, crossover, and mutation\n- Selection: Choose the best individuals (pairs) based on their fitness (profit).\n- Crossover: Combine the selected individuals to create offspring.\n- Mutation: Randomly change some offspring values within the constraints.\n\nStep 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a stopping condition is met\nContinue iterating through the genetic algorithm process until a stopping condition is met, such as a maximum number of generations or a satisfactory fitness level.\n\nAfter running the genetic algorithm, we will find the optimal solution for the number of units of product A and B to produce each week to maximize profit. Note that the genetic algorithm is a heuristic method, and the solution may not always be the global optimum. However, it is an effective way to find a good solution for complex problems."
