    "message_1": "A mathematician is studying the hyperbolic geometry of a surface with a curvature of -2. If the surface has a circumference of 10 meters, what is the length of its shortest closed geodesic?",
    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the circumference C of a circle is related to its radius r by the formula:\n\nC = 2π sinh(r/R)\n\nwhere R is the radius of curvature, which is related to the curvature K by R = sqrt(-1/K). In this case, K = -2, so R = sqrt(1/2).\n\nGiven that the circumference is 10 meters, we have:\n\n10 = 2π sinh(r/sqrt(1/2))\n\nDivide both sides by 2π:\n\n5/π = sinh(r/sqrt(1/2))\n\nNow, take the inverse hyperbolic sine (sinh^(-1)) of both sides:\n\nr/sqrt(1/2) = sinh^(-1)(5/π)\n\nNow, multiply both sides by sqrt(1/2):\n\nr = sqrt(1/2) * sinh^(-1)(5/π)\n\nr ≈ 1.086\n\nThe length of the shortest closed geodesic in hyperbolic geometry is equal to the radius of the circle, so the length of the shortest closed geodesic on this surface is approximately 1.086 meters."
