    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of a non-periodic function, we need to extend the function to be periodic. In this case, we can extend f(x) = x^2 to be an even function over the interval [-π, π] by defining it as follows:\n\nf(x) = x^2, for -π/2 < x < π/2\nf(x) = (π - x)^2, for π/2 < x < π\nf(x) = (π + x)^2, for -π < x < -π/2\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier series representation of this function. Since f(x) is an even function, we only need to find the cosine coefficients, as the sine coefficients will be zero.\n\nThe Fourier series representation of an even function is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_0 and a_n are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nTo find a_0, we use the formula:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\n\nWe need to split the integral into three parts, corresponding to the three intervals of f(x):\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[-π, -π/2] (π + x)^2 dx + ∫[-π/2, π/2] x^2 dx + ∫[π/2, π] (π - x)^2 dx]\n\nNow, we can evaluate these integrals:\n\n∫[-π, -π/2] (π + x)^2 dx = [(1/3)(π + x)^3](-π, -π/2) = (1/3)(π/2)^3 - (1/3)(π)^3\n\n∫[-π/2, π/2] x^2 dx = [(1/3)x^3](-π/2, π/2) = (1/3)(π/2)^3 - (1/3)(-π/2)^3\n\n∫[π/2, π] (π - x)^2 dx = [(1/3)(π - x)^3](π/2, π) = (1/3)(π/2)^3 - (1/3)(π)^3\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the a_0 formula:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/3)(π/2)^3 - (1/3)(π)^3 + (1/3)(π/2)^3 - (1/3)(-π/2)^3 + (1/3)(π/2)^3 - (1/3)(π)^3]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [-(1/3)(π)^3 + 3(1/3)(π/2)^3]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [-π^3/3 + 3(π^3/8)]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * (π^3) * [-1/3 + 3/8]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * (π^3) * (1/24)\n\na_0 = π^2/8\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients a_n for n ≥ 1:\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nAgain, we need to split the integral into three parts:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [∫[-π, -π/2] (π + x)^2 * cos(n * x) dx + ∫[-π/2, π/2] x^2 * cos(n * x) dx + ∫[π/2, π] (π - x)^2 * cos(n * x) dx]\n\nUnfortunately, these integrals do not have elementary antiderivatives. However, we can express them in terms of sine and cosine integrals:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [Si((π + x)^2, n) - Si(π^2, n) + Ci(x^2, n) - Ci((-π/2)^2, n) + Si((π - x)^2, n) - Si(π^2, n)]\n\nwhere Si(f(x), n) and Ci(f(x), n) represent sine and cosine integral functions, respectively.\n\nThus, the Fourier series representation of the given function f(x) = x^2 for -π/2 < x < π/2 is:\n\nf(x) = π^2/8 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x)], where a_n is given by the expression above."
