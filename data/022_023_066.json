    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation with initial and boundary conditions, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) = 4X''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $4X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{4T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side is a function of $t$ only and the right side is a function of $x$ only, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{4T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$T''(t) = -4\\lambda^2 T(t)$ and $X''(x) = -\\lambda^2 X(x)$\n\nSolve the spatial equation first:\n\n$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$\n\nwith boundary conditions $X(0) = X(1) = 0$. The general solution is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\sin(\\lambda x) + B\\cos(\\lambda x)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get $B = 0$ and $A\\sin(\\lambda) = 0$. Since $A$ cannot be zero (trivial solution), we must have $\\lambda = n\\pi$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$. Thus, the spatial part of the solution is:\n\n$X_n(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x)$\n\nNow, solve the temporal equation:\n\n$T''(t) + 4n^2\\pi^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nThe general solution is:\n\n$T_n(t) = C_n\\cos(2n\\pi t) + D_n\\sin(2n\\pi t)$\n\nUsing the initial condition $u_t(x, 0) = 0$, we get $D_n = 0$. Thus, the temporal part of the solution is:\n\n$T_n(t) = C_n\\cos(2n\\pi t)$\n\nThe general solution of the wave equation is a sum of the product of spatial and temporal parts:\n\n$u(x, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n\\sin(n\\pi x)\\cos(2n\\pi t)$\n\nApplying the initial condition $u(x, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$, we get:\n\n$\\sin(\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$\n\nComparing the coefficients of $\\sin(n\\pi x)$, we get $C_1 = 1$ and $C_n = 0$ for $n > 1$. Thus, the solution of the wave equation is:\n\n$u(x, t) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi t)$"
