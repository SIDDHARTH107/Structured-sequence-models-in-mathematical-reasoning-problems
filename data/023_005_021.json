    "message_1": "A mass-spring system is governed by the differential equation:\n\ny''(t) + 4y(t) = cos(3t)\n\nwhere y(t) is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position at time t. Find the solution of the differential equation using the Fourier transform method. Assume that the initial displacement and velocity of the mass are both zero, i.e., y(0) = y'(0) = 0. Find the displacement of the mass at time t = 5.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform method, we first take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. Let Y(ω) be the Fourier transform of y(t), and let F{·} denote the Fourier transform. Then we have:\n\nF{y''(t) + 4y(t)} = F{cos(3t)}\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of y''(t) and y(t), we get:\n\n(ω^2)Y(ω) - ωy'(0) - y(0) + 4Y(ω) = (π[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)])\n\nSince y(0) = y'(0) = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\n(ω^2 + 4)Y(ω) = π[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)]\n\nNow, we solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = π[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)] / (ω^2 + 4)\n\nNext, we take the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to find y(t):\n\ny(t) = F^{-1}{π[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)] / (ω^2 + 4)}\n\nUsing the convolution theorem, we have:\n\ny(t) = (1/π) * (e^(-2|t|) * cos(3t))\n\nNow, we find the displacement of the mass at time t = 5:\n\ny(5) = (1/π) * (e^(-2*5) * cos(15))\n\ny(5) = (1/π) * (e^(-10) * cos(15))\n\ny(5) ≈ -0.0000454\n\nSo, the displacement of the mass at time t = 5 is approximately -0.0000454 units."
