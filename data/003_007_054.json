    "message_2": "To find the length of side c using the law of cosines, we can use the formula:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a = 5, b = 7, and angle C = 60 degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to convert angle C from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (60 degrees * π) / 180 = π / 3\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nc² = 5² + 7² - 2 * 5 * 7 * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 25 + 49 - 70 * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 74 - 70 * (1/2) (since cos(π / 3) = 1/2)\nc² = 74 - 35\nc² = 39\n\nNow, we can find the length of side c by taking the square root of both sides:\n\nc = √39\n\nSo, the length of side c is approximately √39 or approximately 6.24 units."
