    "message_1": "Sure, here is an example numerical problem for a math student to solve: \n\nSuppose we want to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = âˆ’x^2 + 2x + 5 using the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. Using a population size of 20 and a limit of 100 iterations, find the optimal value of x and the minimum value of the function. Use the following initial conditions: \n- x_min = -10\n- x_max = 10\n- limit = 100 \n\n(Note: You can also vary these initial conditions to create your own numerical problem with varying difficulty levels.)",
    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I am unable to execute the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm directly. However, I can provide you with an outline of the steps to solve the problem using the algorithm. You can then implement the algorithm in a programming language of your choice to find the optimal value of x and the minimum value of the function.\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n   - Population size (n) = 20\n   - x_min = -10\n   - x_max = 10\n   - Maximum number of iterations (max_iter) = 100\n\n2. Generate the initial population of bees (solutions) randomly within the search space (x_min to x_max).\n\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each solution in the population using the objective function f(x) = -x^2 + 2x + 5.\n\n4. For each iteration:\n   a. Perform the employed bee phase: Update the solutions by generating new solutions in the neighborhood of the current solutions, and evaluate their fitness. If the new solution has better fitness, replace the old solution with the new one.\n   b. Perform the onlooker bee phase: Select the solutions with higher fitness probabilistically, and update them similarly to the employed bee phase.\n   c. Perform the scout bee phase: If a solution has not been improved for a certain number of iterations (called the \"limit\" parameter), replace it with a new randomly generated solution.\n   d. Update the best solution found so far, if a better solution is found in the current iteration.\n   e. Repeat steps 4a to 4d until the maximum number of iterations (max_iter) is reached.\n\n5. The best solution found after max_iter iterations will be the optimal value of x, and the minimum value of the function can be obtained by evaluating f(x) at this optimal value.\n\nBy implementing the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm with the given parameters and initial conditions, you can find the optimal value of x and the minimum value of the function f(x) = -x^2 + 2x + 5."
