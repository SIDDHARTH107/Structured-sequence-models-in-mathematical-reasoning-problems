    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 5 on the interval [0, 4], we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the critical points of the function by taking the derivative and setting it equal to 0.\n2. Check the endpoints of the interval.\n3. Compare the values of the function at the critical points and endpoints to determine the maximum and minimum values.\n\nStep 1: Find the critical points\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 5) = 6x - 12\nSet f'(x) = 0:\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nSo, there is one critical point at x = 2.\n\nStep 2: Check the endpoints of the interval\nThe interval is [0, 4], so we need to evaluate the function at x = 0 and x = 4.\n\nf(0) = 3(0)^2 - 12(0) + 5 = 5\nf(4) = 3(4)^2 - 12(4) + 5 = 48 - 48 + 5 = 5\n\nStep 3: Compare the values of the function at the critical points and endpoints\nNow we need to evaluate the function at the critical point x = 2.\n\nf(2) = 3(2)^2 - 12(2) + 5 = 12 - 24 + 5 = -7\n\nNow we can compare the values of the function at the critical point and the endpoints:\n\nf(0) = 5\nf(2) = -7\nf(4) = 5\n\nThe minimum value of the function on the interval [0, 4] is -7, which occurs at x = 2. The maximum value of the function on the interval [0, 4] is 5, which occurs at both x = 0 and x = 4."
