    "message_2": "To find one of the prime factors of 8890561 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) that maps integers to integers. A common choice is f(x) = x^2 + 1.\n2. Choose a random starting point x_0.\n3. Iterate the function to generate a sequence of numbers: x_1 = f(x_0), x_2 = f(x_1), ..., x_n = f(x_(n-1)).\n4. Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between two terms in the sequence and the given number (8890561). If the GCD is not 1 or the given number, then it is a non-trivial factor of the given number.\n\nLet's choose x_0 = 2 and use f(x) = x^2 + 1.\n\nx_1 = f(x_0) = 2^2 + 1 = 5\nx_2 = f(x_1) = 5^2 + 1 = 26\nx_3 = f(x_2) = 26^2 + 1 = 677\n\nNow, we will compute the GCD of the absolute differences:\n\nGCD(|x_1 - x_0|, 8890561) = GCD(3, 8890561) = 1\nGCD(|x_2 - x_1|, 8890561) = GCD(21, 8890561) = 1\nGCD(|x_3 - x_2|, 8890561) = GCD(651, 8890561) = 13\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor: 13. To find the other factor, we can divide 8890561 by 13:\n\n8890561 / 13 = 683889\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 8890561 is 13 * 683889."
