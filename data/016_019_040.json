    "message_2": "The Koch curve is a fractal that is formed by successively applying a simple geometric transformation to a line segment. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 4/3.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of the curve is 4/3 times the original length. After the second iteration, the length is (4/3)^2 times the original length, and so on. \n\nSo, after the 4th iteration, the length of the Koch curve will be (4/3)^4 times the original length.\n\n(4/3)^4 = 256/81\n\nSince the original line segment has a length of 1 unit, the total length of the Koch curve after the 4th iteration is:\n\n256/81 * 1 = 256/81 units."
