    "message_1": "In a block design experiment, there are 10 blocks and each block contains 5 treatments. If each treatment appears in exactly 6 blocks, how many treatments are there in total?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the total number of treatments as T. Since each treatment appears in exactly 6 blocks, the total number of treatment appearances across all blocks is 6T. On the other hand, there are 10 blocks, and each block contains 5 treatments, so there are 10 * 5 = 50 treatment appearances in total.\n\nNow we can set up an equation:\n\n6T = 50\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\nT = 50 / 6\n\nT â‰ˆ 8.33\n\nHowever, the number of treatments must be a whole number. Since 8.33 is between 8 and 9, we can check both of these values to see if they satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n\nIf there are 8 treatments, then each treatment appears in 6 blocks, so there are 8 * 6 = 48 treatment appearances. This does not match the required 50 treatment appearances.\n\nIf there are 9 treatments, then each treatment appears in 6 blocks, so there are 9 * 6 = 54 treatment appearances. This also does not match the required 50 treatment appearances.\n\nTherefore, there is no whole number solution for the number of treatments in this block design experiment that satisfies the given conditions."
