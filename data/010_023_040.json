    "message_2": "The given knot is known as the \"trefoil knot,\" which is the simplest nontrivial knot. To untangle this knot, we need to perform the following moves:\n\n1. Slide the top loop over the bottom loop.\n2. Slide the bottom loop over the top loop.\n\nIn just 2 moves, the knot will be untangled. So, the minimal number of moves required to untangle this knot is 2."
