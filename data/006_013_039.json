    "message_1": "What is the probability of a severe earthquake with a magnitude of 7 or higher occurring within the next 10 years in a specific region, if the historical record shows that an earthquake of this magnitude occurs on average once every 15 years in that region? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, severe earthquakes) occurring in a fixed interval of time (10 years) given a known average rate of occurrence (1 earthquake per 15 years).\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of events (λ) in the 10-year period. Since the average rate of occurrence is 1 earthquake per 15 years, we can calculate λ as follows:\n\nλ = (1 earthquake / 15 years) * 10 years = 10/15 ≈ 0.67 earthquakes in 10 years\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least one severe earthquake occurring within the next 10 years. To do this, we can find the probability of no earthquakes occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe Poisson probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nWhere x is the number of events, e is the base of the natural logarithm (≈ 2.718), and λ is the average number of events.\n\nFor x = 0 (no earthquakes):\n\nP(0) = (e^(-0.67) * 0.67^0) / 0! = (0.512) * 1 / 1 = 0.512\n\nNow, we find the probability of at least one earthquake:\n\nP(at least 1) = 1 - P(0) = 1 - 0.512 = 0.488\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the probability of a severe earthquake with a magnitude of 7 or higher occurring within the next 10 years in the specific region is 0.49 or 49%."
