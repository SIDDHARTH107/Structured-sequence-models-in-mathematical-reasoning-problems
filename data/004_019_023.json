    "message_1": "A particle moves along a horizontal line such that its velocity at time t, in seconds, is given by v(t) = t^2 - 3t + 2. Find the acceleration of the particle at time t = 2 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the particle, we need to find the derivative of the velocity function with respect to time. This will give us the acceleration function, a(t). \n\nThe velocity function is v(t) = t^2 - 3t + 2. \n\nNow, let's find the derivative of v(t) with respect to t:\n\na(t) = dv(t)/dt = d(t^2 - 3t + 2)/dt\n\nUsing basic differentiation rules, we get:\n\na(t) = 2t - 3\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration at time t = 2 seconds. Plug t = 2 into the acceleration function:\n\na(2) = 2(2) - 3\n\na(2) = 4 - 3\n\na(2) = 1\n\nSo, the acceleration of the particle at time t = 2 seconds is 1 m/sÂ²."
