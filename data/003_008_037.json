    "message_1": "A right-angled triangle has a base of 15 cm and a height of 8 cm. Using trigonometry, what is the area of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a right-angled triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 15 cm and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (15 * 8) / 2\nArea = 120 / 2\nArea = 60 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 60 square centimeters."
