The two groups are:\n\nGroup A: scored 75, 80, 82, 84, 88, 90, 92, and 95\nGroup B: scored 78, 82, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, and 97\n\nWhat is the calculated value of the test statistic, and using a significance level of 0.05, can you reject the null hypothesis that the median scores of both groups are equal?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in the median scores of the two groups, we can use the Mann-Whitney U test, a non-parametric test that compares the medians of two independent samples.\n\nFirst, we need to combine the two groups and rank the scores:\n\nCombined scores: 75, 78, 80, 82, 82, 84, 85, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 95, 97\nRanks:           1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16\n\nNow, assign the ranks to the original groups:\n\nGroup A ranks: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 15\nGroup B ranks: 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16\n\nNext, calculate the sum of ranks for each group:\n\nSum of ranks for Group A: 1 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 62\nSum of ranks for Group B: 2 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 = 74\n\nNow, we can calculate the U statistic for each group:\n\nU_A = n_A * n_B + (n_A * (n_A + 1)) / 2 - R_A\nU_B = n_A * n_B + (n_B * (n_B + 1)) / 2 - R_B\n\nWhere n_A and n_B are the number of observations in Group A and Group B, respectively, and R_A and R_B are the sum of ranks for Group A and Group B, respectively.\n\nU_A = 8 * 8 + (8 * (8 + 1)) / 2 - 62 = 64 + 36 - 62 = 38\nU_B = 8 * 8 + (8 * (8 + 1)) / 2 - 74 = 64 + 36 - 74 = 26\n\nThe smaller U value is 26. Now, we need to compare this value to the critical value for the Mann-Whitney U test at a significance level of 0.05. For a sample size of 8 in each group, the critical value is 23.\n\nSince our calculated U value (26) is greater than the critical value (23), we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the median scores of both groups are equal at a significance level of 0.05."
