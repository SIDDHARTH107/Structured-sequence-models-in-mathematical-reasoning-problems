    "message_1": "In a factory, there are 6 machines that produce products. Each machine has a different production rate per hour. Machine 1 produces 5 products per hour, machine 2 produces 10 products per hour, machine 3 produces 7 products per hour, machine 4 produces 8 products per hour, machine 5 produces 9 products per hour, and machine 6 produces 12 products per hour. The factory can produce a maximum of 50 products per hour. What is the optimal combination of machines that the factory should use to produce the maximum number of products per hour?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal combination of machines to produce the maximum number of products per hour, we need to find the combination of machines that adds up to 50 products per hour or as close as possible without exceeding 50.\n\nLet's list the machines and their production rates:\n\n1. Machine 1: 5 products/hour\n2. Machine 2: 10 products/hour\n3. Machine 3: 7 products/hour\n4. Machine 4: 8 products/hour\n5. Machine 5: 9 products/hour\n6. Machine 6: 12 products/hour\n\nNow let's try different combinations:\n\n1. Machines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5: 5 + 10 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 39 products/hour\n2. Machines 1, 2, 3, 4, 6: 5 + 10 + 7 + 8 + 12 = 42 products/hour\n3. Machines 1, 2, 3, 5, 6: 5 + 10 + 7 + 9 + 12 = 43 products/hour\n4. Machines 1, 2, 4, 5, 6: 5 + 10 + 8 + 9 + 12 = 44 products/hour\n5. Machines 1, 3, 4, 5, 6: 5 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 12 = 41 products/hour\n6. Machines 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: 10 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 12 = 46 products/hour\n\nThe combination that produces the maximum number of products per hour without exceeding 50 is the combination of machines 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, which produces 46 products per hour."
