    "message_1": "A plane flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet spots a landmark on the ground at an angle of depression of 25 degrees from the plane. How far away, to the nearest foot, is the landmark from the plane? (Assume that the radius of the earth is 3960 miles and ignore the height of the plane.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The angle of depression is the angle formed between the line of sight from the plane to the landmark and a horizontal line parallel to the ground. Since the angle of depression is 25 degrees, the angle between the ground and the line of sight is also 25 degrees.\n\nWe can set up a right triangle with the altitude of the plane (10,000 feet) as the opposite side, the distance from the plane to the landmark on the ground as the adjacent side, and the line of sight from the plane to the landmark as the hypotenuse.\n\nUsing the tangent function, we have:\n\ntan(25°) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(25°) = 10,000 feet / distance to landmark\n\nTo find the distance to the landmark, we can rearrange the equation:\n\ndistance to landmark = 10,000 feet / tan(25°)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value for the tangent of 25 degrees:\n\ndistance to landmark = 10,000 feet / 0.4663 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\ndistance to landmark ≈ 21,428.4 feet\n\nSo, the landmark is approximately 21,428 feet away from the plane."
