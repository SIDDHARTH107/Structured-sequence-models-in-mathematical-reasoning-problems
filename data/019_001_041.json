    "message_2": "To find the truth value of the proposition \"(not P) and Q\", we need to evaluate the truth values of \"not P\" and \"Q\" and then apply the \"and\" operation.\n\nSince P is true (1), \"not P\" is false (0).\n\nNow, we have the proposition \"false and Q\". Since Q is false (0), the proposition becomes \"false and false\".\n\nFor the \"and\" operation, both propositions need to be true for the result to be true. In this case, both are false, so the result is also false (0).\n\nTherefore, the truth value of the proposition \"(not P) and Q\" is false (0)."
