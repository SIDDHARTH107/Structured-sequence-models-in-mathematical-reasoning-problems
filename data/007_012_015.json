    "message_2": "Let's use Wilson's Theorem, which states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p). \n\nNow, we are given that (p-1)! + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p). Since (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p), we can rewrite the given condition as -1 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p). This simplifies to 0 ≡ 0 (mod p), which is true for all prime numbers p.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the smallest prime number p that satisfies this condition. The smallest prime number is 2. Therefore, the smallest prime number p for which (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p is 2."
