    "message_2": "To choose 4 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards without considering the order, we can use the combination formula. The combination formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 52 (total number of cards in a standard deck) and k = 4 (number of cards to choose).\n\nC(52, 4) = 52! / (4!(52-4)!)\n\nC(52, 4) = 52! / (4!48!)\n\nC(52, 4) = (52 × 51 × 50 × 49) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(52, 4) = 270725\n\nSo, there are 270,725 ways to choose 4 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards if order doesn't matter."
