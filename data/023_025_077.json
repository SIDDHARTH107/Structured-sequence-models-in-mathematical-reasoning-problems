    "message_2": "The given temperature distribution function is already in the form of a sum of sinusoidal functions, so we don't need to apply the Fourier transform. Instead, we can directly identify the frequency and amplitude of each component.\n\nThe function f(t) can be written as:\n\nf(t) = A0 + A1*cos(ω1*t) + B1*sin(ω2*t)\n\nwhere A0 is the constant term, A1 and B1 are the amplitudes of the cosine and sine terms, respectively, and ω1 and ω2 are the angular frequencies of the cosine and sine terms, respectively.\n\nComparing this with the given function:\n\nf(t) = 20 + 10*cos(2π*t/5) + 5*sin(4π*t/5)\n\nWe can identify the following components:\n\n1. Constant term:\n   A0 = 20\n\n2. Cosine term:\n   Amplitude: A1 = 10\n   Angular frequency: ω1 = 2π/5\n   Frequency: f1 = ω1 / (2π) = 1/5 Hz\n\n3. Sine term:\n   Amplitude: B1 = 5\n   Angular frequency: ω2 = 4π/5\n   Frequency: f2 = ω2 / (2π) = 2/5 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency and amplitude of each component of the temperature distribution are:\n\n1. Constant term: Amplitude = 20\n2. Cosine term: Frequency = 1/5 Hz, Amplitude = 10\n3. Sine term: Frequency = 2/5 Hz, Amplitude = 5"
