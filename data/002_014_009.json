    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has the following dimensions: length = 5 cm, width = 3 cm, and height = 7 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The rectangular prism has three pairs of congruent faces: two with dimensions 5 cm x 3 cm, two with dimensions 5 cm x 7 cm, and two with dimensions 3 cm x 7 cm.\n\nThe area of each pair of faces can be found by multiplying their dimensions:\n\n1. Two faces with dimensions 5 cm x 3 cm: 2 * (5 * 3) = 2 * 15 = 30 square cm\n2. Two faces with dimensions 5 cm x 7 cm: 2 * (5 * 7) = 2 * 35 = 70 square cm\n3. Two faces with dimensions 3 cm x 7 cm: 2 * (3 * 7) = 2 * 21 = 42 square cm\n\nNow, add the areas of all the pairs of faces together:\n\nSurface area = 30 + 70 + 42 = 142 square cm\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 142 square cm."
