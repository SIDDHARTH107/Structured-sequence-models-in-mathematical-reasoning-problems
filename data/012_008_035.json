    "message_2": "To determine if a graph G is planar or not, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nWe are given that G has 10 vertices (v = 10) and 15 edges (e = 15). We can use the inequality derived from Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nSubstitute the values of v and e:\n\n15 ≤ 3(10) - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nSince the inequality holds true, it is possible that the graph G is planar. However, this inequality is only a necessary condition, not a sufficient one. To be sure, we would need to check if there is a planar representation of the graph G or use other methods like Kuratowski's theorem. But based on the given information and the inequality, it is possible that the graph G is planar."
