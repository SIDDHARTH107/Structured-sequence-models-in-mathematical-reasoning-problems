    "message_2": "For a second-order reaction, the rate law is given by:\n\nrate = k[A][B]\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, and [A] and [B] are the concentrations of A and B, respectively.\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is A + 2B -> C, we can write the following relationships for the concentrations of A and B at any time t:\n\n[A] = [A]₀ - x\n[B] = [B]₀ - 2x\n\nwhere [A]₀ and [B]₀ are the initial concentrations of A and B, and x is the amount of A that has reacted.\n\nNow we can substitute these expressions into the rate law:\n\nrate = k([A]₀ - x)([B]₀ - 2x)\n\nSince the reaction is second-order, we can also write the integrated rate law as:\n\n1/([A] - [A]₀) = kt\n\nNow we can plug in the given values and solve for the concentration of A after 30 minutes (1800 seconds):\n\n1/([A] - 0.05) = 0.001 * 1800\n\n1/([A] - 0.05) = 1.8\n\n[A] - 0.05 = 1/1.8\n\n[A] = 0.05 + 1/1.8\n\n[A] ≈ 0.05 + 0.5556\n\n[A] ≈ 0.6056 M\n\nSo, the concentration of A after 30 minutes is approximately 0.6056 M."
