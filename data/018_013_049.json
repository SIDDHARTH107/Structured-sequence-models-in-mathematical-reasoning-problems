    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A x B:\n\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow let's find the union of A x B and A:\n\n(A x B) ∪ A = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} ∪ {1, 2}\n(A x B) ∪ A = {1, 2, (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNext, let's find the union of B and A:\n\nB ∪ A = {3, 4} ∪ {1, 2}\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product A x (B ∪ A):\n\nA x (B ∪ A) = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ (B ∪ A)}\nA x (B ∪ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow we can compare the two sets we found:\n\n(A x B) ∪ A = {1, 2, (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nA x (B ∪ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A x B) ∪ A and A x (B ∪ A) are not equal. This demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to union."
