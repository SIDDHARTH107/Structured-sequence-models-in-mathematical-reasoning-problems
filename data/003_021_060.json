    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors v = (5, 2) and u = (-3, 4), we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe dot product of two vectors v and u is given by:\n\nv • u = |v| |u| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |v| and |u| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product (v • u):\n\nv • u = (5 * -3) + (2 * 4) = -15 + 8 = -7\n\nNow, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n|v| = √(5^2 + 2^2) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n|u| = √((-3)^2 + 4^2) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula:\n\n-7 = (√29)(5)cos(θ)\n\nNow, divide both sides by (√29)(5):\n\ncos(θ) = -7 / (5√29)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nθ = arccos(-7 / (5√29))\n\nθ ≈ 125.54°\n\nSo, the angle between the vectors v = (5, 2) and u = (-3, 4) is approximately 125.54°."
