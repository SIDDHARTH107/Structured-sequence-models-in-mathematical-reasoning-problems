    "message_1": "Let X be a projective plane curve of degree 4, given by the equation F(x, y, z) = 0, where F is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4. Let Y be the image of X under the rational map φ : P² → P³ given by (x : y : z) → (F₁(x, y, z) : F₂(x, y, z) : F₃(x, y, z) : F₄(x, y, z)), where F₁, F₂, F₃, F₄ are linear forms in the variables x, y, z. If Y is a rational surface, find the degree of Y.",
    "message_2": "To find the degree of Y, we first need to find the degree of the map φ. Since φ is given by linear forms, the degree of φ is 1. Now, let's compute the degree of Y by considering the pullback of a general hyperplane H in P³ under φ.\n\nLet H be given by the equation G(a, b, c, d) = 0, where G is a linear form in the variables a, b, c, d. Then, the pullback of H under φ is the curve in P² given by the equation G(F₁(x, y, z), F₂(x, y, z), F₃(x, y, z), F₄(x, y, z)) = 0.\n\nSince G is a linear form and F₁, F₂, F₃, F₄ are linear forms, the equation G(F₁(x, y, z), F₂(x, y, z), F₃(x, y, z), F₄(x, y, z)) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4 in x, y, z. Therefore, the pullback of H under φ is a curve of degree 4 in P².\n\nNow, let's compute the intersection number of this pullback with the curve X. Since X is given by the equation F(x, y, z) = 0, the intersection number is the number of points in the intersection of X and the pullback of H, counted with multiplicities.\n\nBy Bézout's theorem, the intersection number of two plane curves of degrees m and n is mn. In our case, the degrees of X and the pullback of H are both 4, so their intersection number is 4 * 4 = 16.\n\nFinally, we can compute the degree of Y using the formula:\n\ndegree(Y) = (intersection number of X and the pullback of H) / degree(φ)\n\nIn our case, this gives:\n\ndegree(Y) = 16 / 1 = 16\n\nSo, the degree of the rational surface Y is 16."
