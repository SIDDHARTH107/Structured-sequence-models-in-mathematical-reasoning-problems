    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we need to set up a system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 11)\n\nFirst, we find the product of the moduli: N = 5 * 7 * 11 = 385.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products:\n\nN1 = N/5 = 385/5 = 77\nN2 = N/7 = 385/7 = 55\nN3 = N/11 = 385/11 = 35\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products:\n\n77 * y1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n55 * y2 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n35 * y3 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nBy trying out different values, we find:\n\ny1 = 3 (since 77 * 3 = 231 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\ny2 = 1 (since 55 * 1 = 55 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\ny3 = 4 (since 35 * 4 = 140 ≡ 1 (mod 11))\n\nNow, we can compute the solution x:\n\nx = (2 * 77 * 3) + (3 * 55 * 1) + (2 * 35 * 4) = 462 + 165 + 280 = 907\n\nFinally, we take the remainder of x when divided by N:\n\nx = 907 % 385 = 137\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is 137."
