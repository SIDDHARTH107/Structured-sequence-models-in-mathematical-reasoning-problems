    "message_2": "To solve the inequality, we first want to get all the x terms on one side of the inequality. We can do this by subtracting 2x from both sides:\n\n2x - 2x + 1 > 5x - 2x - 8\n\n1 > 3x - 8\n\nNow, we want to isolate the x term. We can do this by adding 8 to both sides:\n\n1 + 8 > 3x - 8 + 8\n\n9 > 3x\n\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\n9/3 > 3x/3\n\n3 > x\n\nIn interval notation, this solution can be written as:\n\n(-âˆž, 3)"
