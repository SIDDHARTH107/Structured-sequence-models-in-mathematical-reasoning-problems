    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, say H, of order 3^3 = 27. Let n_3 denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the Sylow Theorems, n_3 must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then H is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G and is normal in G. Since the order of H is 27, H is isomorphic to either C_27 (cyclic group of order 27), C_9 x C_3, or C_3 x C_3 x C_3. In this case, G is isomorphic to H, so G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIf there are three Sylow 3-subgroups, let H, K, and L be distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Since the intersection of distinct Sylow 3-subgroups is trivial, we have |H ∩ K| = |H ∩ L| = |K ∩ L| = 1. Let x be an element of order 3 in H - {e}, and y be an element of order 3 in K - {e}. Then, the subgroup generated by x and y, <x, y>, has order at least 9, as |<x>| = 3 and |<y>| = 3, and their intersection is trivial. \n\nNow, consider the subgroup A = <x, y>. Since A has order at least 9, it must contain a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Without loss of generality, let A contain H. Then, A has order 9 or 27. If |A| = 27, then A = G, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9, as A is generated by elements of order 3. If |A| = 9, then A is a normal subgroup of G, as it has index 3 in G. In this case, G/A is a group of order 3, and G is the semi-direct product of A and G/A. Since A is abelian, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn both cases, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
