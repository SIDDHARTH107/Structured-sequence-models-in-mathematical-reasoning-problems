    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the first cohomology group $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$, we will use the long exact sequence associated with the exponential sequence of sheaves on $X$. The exponential sequence is given by:\n\n$$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathcal{O}_X \\overset{\\exp}{\\to} \\mathcal{O}_X^* \\to 0$$\n\nTaking the cohomology of this sequence, we get the long exact sequence:\n\n$$0 \\to H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\to H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X^*) \\to H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\to H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X^*) \\to \\cdots$$\n\nNow, we compute the relevant cohomology groups:\n\n1. $H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, since the global sections of the constant sheaf $\\mathbb{Z}$ are just the integers.\n\n2. $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = \\mathbb{C}$, since the global sections of the structure sheaf $\\mathcal{O}_X$ are just the constant functions.\n\n3. $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X^*) = \\mathbb{C}^*$, since the global sections of the sheaf of invertible functions are just the nonzero constant functions.\n\n4. $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, since the first cohomology of a smooth projective curve with coefficients in the constant sheaf $\\mathbb{Z}$ vanishes.\n\nNow, we can analyze the long exact sequence. The map $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\to H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X^*)$ is the exponential map, which is surjective. Therefore, the connecting homomorphism $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X^*) \\to H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the zero map. This implies that the map $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$ is injective.\n\nSince $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, we have that $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$ is isomorphic to the kernel of the map $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\to H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X^*)$. However, we don't have enough information to compute the dimension of this kernel directly.\n\nInstead, we can use the fact that $X$ is a smooth projective curve of genus $g$, where $g$ can be computed using the genus-degree formula:\n\n$$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2} = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = 1$$\n\nNow, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for the structure sheaf $\\mathcal{O}_X$:\n\n$$\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X) = h^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) - h^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = 1 - g = 1 - 1 = 0$$\n\nSince $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X) = 0$, we have that $h^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = h^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$. We already computed $h^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = \\dim H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = 1$, so we conclude that:\n\n$$\\dim H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = 1$$"
