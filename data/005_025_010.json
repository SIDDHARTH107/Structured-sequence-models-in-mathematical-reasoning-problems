    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces light bulbs and claims that they have a mean lifespan of 1200 hours with a standard deviation of 100 hours. A sample of 50 bulbs is taken and tested, and the mean lifespan of these bulbs is found to be 1160 hours. Is there evidence to suggest that the average lifespan of the bulbs produced by the manufacturer is different from what they claim? Use a significant level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To test if there is evidence to suggest that the average lifespan of the bulbs produced by the manufacturer is different from what they claim, we will conduct a two-tailed hypothesis test using the sample mean.\n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 1200 hours (The average lifespan is equal to the claimed lifespan.)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 1200 hours (The average lifespan is different from the claimed lifespan.)\n\nStep 2: Determine the level of significance.\nα = 0.05\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic.\nThe test statistic for a sample mean is given by the formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, x̄ = 1160 hours, μ = 1200 hours, σ = 100 hours, and n = 50.\n\nz = (1160 - 1200) / (100 / √50) = -40 / (100 / √50) = -40 / (100 / 7.071) = -40 / 14.142 ≈ -2.83\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value and make a decision.\nSince this is a two-tailed test, we will find the critical value for α/2 = 0.025 in the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe critical value for z is ±1.96.\n\nNow, we compare the test statistic to the critical value:\n-2.83 < -1.96\n\nSince the test statistic is less than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is evidence to suggest that the average lifespan of the bulbs produced by the manufacturer is different from what they claim at a 0.05 level of significance."
