    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD), which in this case is (x+2) * 3.\n\n(3x-1) / (x+2) * (3(x+2)) = (2/3) * (3(x+2))\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\n(3x-1) * 3 = 2(x+2)\n\nDistribute the 3 on the left side and the 2 on the right side:\n\n9x - 3 = 2x + 4\n\nNow, isolate the x term by subtracting 2x from both sides:\n\n9x - 2x - 3 = 2x - 2x + 4\n\n7x - 3 = 4\n\nNext, add 3 to both sides to isolate the x term:\n\n7x - 3 + 3 = 4 + 3\n\n7x = 7\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 7 to solve for x:\n\n7x / 7 = 7 / 7\n\nx = 1"
