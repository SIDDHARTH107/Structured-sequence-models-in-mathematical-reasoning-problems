    "message_1": "Given a plaintext message \"HELLO\" converted into numerical format as [7 4 11 11 14], use ElGamal encryption and decryption to send it securely from sender Alice to receiver Bob. Assume that Alice's private key is p=23, g=5, and x=6, and that Bob's public key is (g^y) mod p=4. Find the ciphertext and verify that the decryption works correctly.",
    "message_2": "To use ElGamal encryption, we first need to compute Alice's public key. Alice's public key is (g^x) mod p, where g=5, x=6, and p=23.\n\nPublic key A = (5^6) mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 8\n\nNow, let's encrypt the message \"HELLO\" represented as [7, 4, 11, 11, 14] using ElGamal encryption. We will use a random number k for each character in the message. For simplicity, let's use k=3 for all characters.\n\n1. Compute α = (g^k) mod p for each character.\nα = (5^3) mod 23 = 125 mod 23 = 3\n\n2.

Compute (α^x) mod p for each character.\nδ = (3^6) mod 23 = 729 mod 23 = 9\n\n2. Compute M = (β * δ^(-1)) mod p for each character, where δ^(-1) is the modular inverse of δ mod p.\nTo find the modular inverse of δ, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or try different numbers until we find one that satisfies (δ * δ^(-1)) mod p = 1. In this case, δ^(-1) = 18, since (9 * 18) mod 23 = 162 mod 23 = 1.\n\nM1 = (18 * 18) mod 23 = 324 mod 23 = 7\nM2 = (2 * 18) mod 23 = 36 mod 23 = 4\nM3 = (6 * 18) mod 23 = 108 mod 23 = 11\nM4 = (6 * 18) mod 23 = 108 mod 23 = 11\nM5 = (20 * 18) mod 23 = 360 mod 23 = 14\n\nThe decrypted message is [7, 4, 11, 11, 14], which corresponds to the original message \"HELLO\". The encryption and decryption worked correctly."
