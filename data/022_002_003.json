    "message_2": "To find the image of the real axis under the conformal map $w = \\frac{1}{2}(z^2 + 1)$, we need to consider the points on the real axis and see where they are mapped to in the complex plane.\n\nLet $z = x$ be a point on the real axis, where $x$ is a real number. Then, we can plug this into the conformal map:\n\n$w = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + 1)$.\n\nSince $x$ is real, $x^2$ is non-negative, and thus $x^2 + 1 \\geq 1$. Therefore, the image of the real axis under this map is the set of points on the real axis with real part greater than or equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nIn other words, the image of the real axis under the conformal map $w = \\frac{1}{2}(z^2 + 1)$ is the half-line $[\\frac{1}{2}, \\infty)$."
