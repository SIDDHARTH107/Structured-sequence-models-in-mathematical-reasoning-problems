    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Bell number, which counts the number of ways to partition a set with n elements into non-empty subsets. The Bell number B(n) can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:\n\nB(n) = Î£[k=0 to n-1] C(n-1, k) * B(k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!).\n\nFor n = 5, we can calculate the Bell number B(5) as follows:\n\nB(5) = C(4, 0) * B(0) + C(4, 1) * B(1) + C(4, 2) * B(2) + C(4, 3) * B(3) + C(4, 4) * B(4)\n\nFirst, we need to find the Bell numbers for B(0) to B(4):\n\nB(0) = 1 (by definition)\nB(1) = 1 (there is only one way to partition a set with 1 element)\nB(2) = 2 (two ways: {{1, 2}} and {{1}, {2}})\nB(3) = 5 (five ways: {{1, 2, 3}}, {{1, 2}, {3}}, {{1, 3}, {2}}, {{1}, {2, 3}}, and {{1}, {2}, {3}})\nB(4) = 15 (fifteen ways)\n\nNow we can calculate the binomial coefficients:\n\nC(4, 0) = 1\nC(4, 1) = 4\nC(4, 2) = 6\nC(4, 3) = 4\nC(4, 4) = 1\n\nNow we can find B(5):\n\nB(5) = 1 * 1 + 4 * 1 + 6 * 2 + 4 * 5 + 1 * 15\nB(5) = 1 + 4 + 12 + 20 + 15\nB(5) = 52\n\nSo there are 52 unique ways to partition a set with 5 distinct elements into non-empty subsets."
