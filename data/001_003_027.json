    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y's in both equations equal:\n\n(2x + 3y) * 2 = 11 * 2\n4x + 6y = 22\n\nNow we have the two equations:\n\n4x + 6y = 22\n4x + 2y = 16\n\nNext, we will subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x + 2y) = 22 - 16\n4x + 6y - 4x - 2y = 6\n6y = 6\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\n6y = 6\ny = 6/6\ny = 1\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for x. We'll use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 11\n2x + 3(1) = 11\n2x + 3 = 11\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n2x = 11 - 3\n2x = 8\nx = 8/2\nx = 4\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 4 and y = 1."
