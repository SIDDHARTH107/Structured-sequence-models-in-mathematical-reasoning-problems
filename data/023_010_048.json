    "message_1": "Suppose you have an image of size 1024 x 1024 pixels. Apply a 2D Fourier Transform on the image and compute the amplitude spectrum. How many unique frequency components are present in the amplitude spectrum?",
    "message_2": "When you apply a 2D Fourier Transform on an image of size 1024 x 1024 pixels, you will get a complex-valued matrix of the same size, representing the frequency components of the image. To compute the amplitude spectrum, you take the magnitude of each complex value in the matrix.\n\nSince the 2D Fourier Transform is symmetric, you only need to consider half of the frequency components along each dimension to get the unique frequency components. In this case, you will have:\n\nUnique frequency components along the horizontal axis = (1024/2) + 1 = 513\nUnique frequency components along the vertical axis = (1024/2) + 1 = 513\n\nTo find the total number of unique frequency components in the amplitude spectrum, you multiply the unique frequency components along each axis:\n\nTotal unique frequency components = 513 * 513 = 263169\n\nSo, there are 263169 unique frequency components in the amplitude spectrum of a 1024 x 1024 image after applying a 2D Fourier Transform."
