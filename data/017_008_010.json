    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 8, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the number of its elements.\n2. A group of order 8 must have a prime power order, i.e., 8 = 2^3.\n3. The number of non-isomorphic groups of order p^n, where p is a prime and n is a positive integer, can be determined using the formula:\n\n   G(p^n) = (p^(n^2) - p^(n(n-1)/2)) / (p^n - p^(n-1))\n\nApplying this formula to our problem:\n\nG(2^3) = (2^(3^2) - 2^(3(3-1)/2)) / (2^3 - 2^(3-1))\nG(2^3) = (2^9 - 2^6) / (8 - 4)\nG(2^3) = (512 - 64) / 4\nG(2^3) = 448 / 4\nG(2^3) = 112\n\nHowever, this formula gives the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 8 up to isomorphism and equivalence, which is not what we are looking for. We need to find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 8 without considering equivalence.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following classification of groups of order 8:\n\n1. Cyclic groups: There is only one cyclic group of order 8, which is the group generated by an element of order 8. This group is isomorphic to Z_8 (the integers modulo 8 under addition).\n\n2. Dihedral groups: There is one dihedral group of order 8, denoted by D_4, which is the group of symmetries of a square.\n\n3. Quaternion group: There is one quaternion group of order 8, denoted by Q_8, which consists of the elements {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} with the quaternion multiplication.\n\n4. Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2: There is one such group, denoted by Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2, which is the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 8."
