The sample has a mean weight of 500 grams with a standard deviation of 20 grams. What is the estimated population mean weight of the products with a 95% confidence level?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the population mean weight with a 95% confidence level, we will use the formula for the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nHere, the sample mean is 500 grams, the standard deviation is 20 grams, and the sample size is 50 products. For a 95% confidence level, the critical value (Z-score) is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\nConfidence Interval = 500 ± (1.96 * (20 / √50))\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √Sample Size = 20 / √50 ≈ 2.83\n\nNow, let's calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = Critical Value * Standard Error = 1.96 * 2.83 ≈ 5.54\n\nFinally, let's find the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 500 ± 5.54 = (494.46, 505.54)\n\nSo, with a 95% confidence level, the estimated population mean weight of the products is between 494.46 grams and 505.54 grams."
