    "message_2": "To find the number of roots of the equation f(z) = i, we first set f(z) equal to i:\n\nz^3 - 2z^2 + 3z + 1 = i\n\nSince f(z) is a polynomial of degree 3, it will have at most 3 roots. We can use the complex conjugate root theorem, which states that if a polynomial has real coefficients and a complex root, then its complex conjugate is also a root. \n\nLet's denote a complex root as z = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers. Then, the complex conjugate of this root is z* = a - bi. If we plug z = a + bi into the equation, we get:\n\n(a + bi)^3 - 2(a + bi)^2 + 3(a + bi) + 1 = i\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n(a^3 - 3ab^2) + (3a^2b - b^3)i = i\n\nFor the real and imaginary parts to be equal, we need:\n\na^3 - 3ab^2 = 0\n3a^2b - b^3 = 1\n\nFrom the first equation, we have two cases:\n\n1) a = 0: In this case, the second equation becomes -b^3 = 1, which has no real solutions for b.\n\n2) a^2 = 3b^2: In this case, the second equation becomes 3(3b^2)b - b^3 = 1, which simplifies to 8b^3 = 1. This has one real solution for b, b = (1/2)^(1/3). Then, a = ±√3 * (1/2)^(1/3).\n\nSo, we have two complex roots and their complex conjugates, for a total of 4 roots. However, since f(z) is a polynomial of degree 3, it can have at most 3 roots. This means that one of the complex roots and its conjugate must be a double root (i.e., have multiplicity 2). \n\nTherefore, the equation f(z) = i has 3 roots, including multiplicities."
