    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$, we first need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y\n$$\n\nA critical point occurs when both partial derivatives are equal to zero:\n\n$$\n2x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0\n$$\n\nThus, there is only one critical point, which is $(0, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to classify the critical point using Morse theory. To do this, we compute the Hessian matrix, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives:\n\n$$\nH(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are the principal curvatures of the function at the critical point. If all eigenvalues are positive, the critical point is a local minimum; if all eigenvalues are negative, the critical point is a local maximum; if the eigenvalues have different signs, the critical point is a saddle point.\n\nIn this case, the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are both positive (4 and 4), so the critical point $(0, 0)$ is a local minimum."
