    "message_1": "Suppose in a particular country, the probability that a randomly chosen voter supports Party A is 0.6, while the probability that a voter supports Party B is 0.4. If a random sample of 200 voters is selected, what is the probability that at least 120 of them support Party A?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial\n- n is the number of trials\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 200 (the number of voters in the sample)\n- p = 0.6 (the probability that a voter supports Party A)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 120 of the 200 voters support Party A, which means we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 120, 121, ..., 200.\n\nP(X >= 120) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 120 to 200\n\nTo calculate this, we can use a loop to sum the probabilities for each value of k:\n\nP(X >= 120) = 0\nfor k = 120 to 200:\n  P(X = k) = C(200, k) * 0.6^k * 0.4^(200-k)\n  P(X >= 120) += P(X = k)\n\nUsing a calculator or programming language to compute this sum, we find that:\n\nP(X >= 120) ≈ 0.9793\n\nSo, the probability that at least 120 of the 200 voters support Party A is approximately 0.9793, or 97.93%."
