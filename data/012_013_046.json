    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of G, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of proper k-colorings of the graph G. \n\n1. Choose an edge e = (2,3) in G.\n2. Compute P(G-e, k), where G-e is the graph obtained by deleting the edge e from G. The graph G-e has the following edges: {(1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5)}.\n3. Compute P(G/e, k), where G/e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e in G. The graph G/e has the following edges: {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (4,5)} and vertices {1, 2/3, 4, 5}, where 2/3 represents the merged vertex of 2 and 3.\n4. The chromatic polynomial of G is given by P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k).\n\nNow we need to find the chromatic polynomials of G-e and G/e.\n\nFor G-e, we can see that it is a tree (acyclic graph), so its chromatic polynomial is simply P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)^(n-1), where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n = 5, so P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)^4.\n\nFor G/e, we can see that it is a cycle with 4 vertices. The chromatic polynomial for a cycle with an even number of vertices is P(G/e, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1), where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n = 4, so P(G/e, k) = (k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1).\n\nNow we can compute the chromatic polynomial of G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k) = k(k-1)^4 - [(k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1)] = k(k-1)^4 - (k-1)^4 - (k-1) = (k-1)[k(k-1)^3 - (k-1)^3 - 1].\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of G is P(G, k) = (k-1)[k(k-1)^3 - (k-1)^3 - 1]."
