    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 3^12345 is divided by 7, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic and find the pattern of remainders when powers of 3 are divided by 7.\n\nLet's find the remainders of the first few powers of 3 modulo 7:\n\n3^1 % 7 = 3\n3^2 % 7 = 2\n3^3 % 7 = 6\n3^4 % 7 = 4\n3^5 % 7 = 5\n3^6 % 7 = 1\n\nNotice that after the 6th power, the remainder becomes 1, and the pattern will repeat after this point. So, we can say that the remainders follow a cycle of length 6.\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 12345 is divided by 6 (the length of the cycle):\n\n12345 % 6 = 3\n\nThis means that the remainder when 3^12345 is divided by 7 will be the same as the remainder when 3^3 is divided by 7, which is:\n\n3^3 % 7 = 6\n\nSo, the remainder when 3^12345 is divided by 7 is 6."
