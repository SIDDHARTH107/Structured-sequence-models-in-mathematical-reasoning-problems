    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, which means it is not guaranteed to find the global minimum but can find a good approximation.\n\nHere's a simple implementation of PSO to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 within the interval [0, 10]:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n   - Number of particles: N = 10\n   - Number of iterations: T = 100\n   - Inertia weight: w = 0.7\n   - Acceleration constants: c1 = 2, c2 = 2\n   - Initialize particles' positions and velocities randomly within the interval [0, 10]\n\n2. For each iteration t = 1, 2, ..., T:\n   a. For each particle i = 1, 2, ..., N:\n      i. Calculate the fitness value f(x) for the current position of the particle\n      ii. Update the personal best position if the current position has a better fitness value\n   b. Update the global best position if any particle has a better fitness value\n   c. For each particle i = 1, 2, ..., N:\n      i. Update the velocity and position of the particle using the following equations:\n         - v_i(t+1) = w * v_i(t) + c1 * rand() * (pbest_i - x_i(t)) + c2 * rand() * (gbest - x_i(t))\n         - x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + v_i(t+1)\n      ii. Make sure the updated position is within the interval [0, 10]\n\n3. The global best position is the approximate value of x that minimizes the function f(x) within the interval [0, 10].\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified version of PSO, and there are more advanced techniques and parameter tuning methods that can improve the performance of the algorithm. However, this should give you a general idea of how PSO can be applied to find the minimum value of a function."
