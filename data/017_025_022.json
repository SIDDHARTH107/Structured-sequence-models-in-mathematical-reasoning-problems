    "message_2": "There are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120. Their structures are as follows:\n\n1. Cyclic group: Z_120\nThis is the group of integers modulo 120 under addition. It is generated by a single element of order 120.\n\n2. Dihedral group: D_60\nThis is the group of symmetries of a regular 60-gon, including both rotations and reflections. It has 60 rotational symmetries and 60 reflectional symmetries, for a total of 120 elements.\n\n3. The symmetric group: S_5\nThis is the group of all permutations of 5 elements. It has 5! = 120 elements.\n\n4. The alternating group: A_5\nThis is the group of all even permutations of 5 elements. It is a normal subgroup of S_5 and has 60 elements. The quotient group S_5/A_5 is isomorphic to Z_2.\n\n5. The direct product of two groups: Z_4 x S_3\nThis group has 4 x 6 = 24 elements. It is a semidirect product of Z_4 and S_3, where Z_4 acts on S_3 by conjugation.\n\nThese are the 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
