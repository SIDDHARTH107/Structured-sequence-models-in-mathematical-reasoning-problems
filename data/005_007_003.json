    "message_1": "What is the correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied and the test score for a group of 50 students, where the data shows that the average number of hours studied is 4 hours with a standard deviation of 1.5 hours and the average test score is 80 with a standard deviation of 10?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (r), we need the covariance between the number of hours studied and the test scores, as well as the standard deviations of both variables. However, the provided information only includes the averages and standard deviations of each variable, but not the covariance or any specific data points.\n\nWithout the covariance or specific data points, we cannot calculate the correlation coefficient. Please provide the covariance or the data points for the number of hours studied and the test scores."
