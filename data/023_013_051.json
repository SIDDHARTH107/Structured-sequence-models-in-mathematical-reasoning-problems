    "message_1": "A metal plate of thickness 0.01m and thermal conductivity of 50W/mK has an initial temperature of 100°C. It is suddenly exposed to a fluid at 20°C, causing the metal to start losing heat at a constant rate of 1000W/m². Use Fourier transformation to find the temperature distribution of the plate after 10 seconds. The plate dimensions are 0.2m x 0.2m.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution of the plate after 10 seconds, we will use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is time, x is the position in the plate, and α is the thermal diffusivity, which is given by:\n\nα = k/(ρ*c_p)\n\nHere, k is the thermal conductivity (50 W/mK), ρ is the density of the material, and c_p is the specific heat capacity. Since the density and specific heat capacity are not provided, we will assume that the thermal diffusivity is constant.\n\nTo solve the heat conduction equation, we will use the Fourier transform method. First, we need to define the initial and boundary conditions:\n\nInitial condition: T(x,0) = 100°C\nBoundary conditions: \n1. Heat flux at x = 0: -k ∂T/∂x = 1000 W/m²\n2. Heat flux at x = 0.01m: -k ∂T/∂x = 1000 W/m²\n\nNow, we will apply the Fourier transform to the heat conduction equation and solve for the temperature distribution T(x,t):\n\n1. Apply Fourier transform to the heat conduction equation:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x² => ∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\n2. Solve the transformed equation for T(x,t):\n\nT(x,t) = (100 - 20) * erfc(x/(2*sqrt(α*t))) + 20\n\nwhere erfc is the complementary error function.\n\n3. Apply the boundary conditions to find the temperature distribution after 10 seconds:\n\nT(x,10) = (100 - 20) * erfc(x/(2*sqrt(α*10))) + 20\n\nSince we don't have the values for ρ and c_p, we cannot find the exact temperature distribution. However, the above equation gives the general form of the temperature distribution in the plate after 10 seconds, considering the initial and boundary conditions."
