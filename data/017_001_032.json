    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 4. We want to show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions of C4 and V4:\n\nC4 = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element and a has order 4.\n\nV4 = {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element, and a, b, and c have order 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible orders of elements in G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G, which is 4. So, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 4.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nLet x be an element of order 4 in G. Then, G = {e, x, x^2, x^3}. This is the same structure as C4, so G is isomorphic to C4 in this case.\n\nCase 2: G has no elements of order 4.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let's denote these elements as a, b, and c. Then G = {e, a, b, c}. Since a, b, and c have order 2, we have:\n\na^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e\n\nNow, let's consider the product of two distinct non-identity elements, say ab. Since a and b have order 2, (ab)^2 = a^2 * b^2 = e. This means that ab has order 2. Since G has only one more element of order 2, which is c, we must have ab = c. Similarly, we can show that ac = b and bc = a.\n\nThis is the same structure as V4, so G is isomorphic to V4 in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 4 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4."
