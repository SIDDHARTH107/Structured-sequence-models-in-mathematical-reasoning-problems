    "message_1": "Sure, here's one:\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is given by the differential equation \ndy/dt = 2xy, where y is the amount of a certain chemical present at time t. If there are 10 grams of the chemical at t=0, how much will remain after 5 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the given differential equation and then use the initial condition to find the specific solution.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n\ndy/dt = 2xy\n\nFirst, we separate the variables:\n\ndy/y = 2x dx\n\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/y) dy = ∫2x dx\n\nln|y| = x^2 + C₁\n\nTo remove the natural logarithm, we take the exponent of both sides:\n\ny = e^(x^2 + C₁)\n\nWe can rewrite the constant term as another constant:\n\ny = e^(x^2) * e^C₂, where C₂ = e^C₁\n\nNow, we use the initial condition y(0) = 10:\n\n10 = e^(0) * e^C₂\n\n10 = e^C₂\n\nC₂ = ln(10)\n\nSo, the specific solution is:\n\ny(x) = e^(x^2) * e^(ln(10))\n\nNow, we find the amount of the chemical remaining after 5 hours (x = 5):\n\ny(5) = e^(5^2) * e^(ln(10))\n\ny(5) = e^25 * 10\n\ny(5) ≈ 2.98 * 10^11 grams\n\nAfter 5 hours, approximately 2.98 * 10^11 grams of the chemical will remain."
