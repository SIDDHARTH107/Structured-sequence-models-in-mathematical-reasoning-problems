    "message_2": "To prove that A intersection B complement is an empty set, we first need to define the sets A and B.\n\nSet A contains even numbers from 1-10: A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\nSet B contains odd numbers from 1-10: B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of set B, denoted as B'. B' contains all the elements that are not in set B, which are the even numbers from 1-10.\n\nB' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of sets A and B', denoted as A ∩ B'. The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nSince A and B' have the same elements, their intersection is not an empty set. However, if we were to find the intersection of A and B (not B complement), then the result would be an empty set, as there are no common elements between even and odd numbers.\n\nA ∩ B = {} (empty set)"
