    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 12x + 5 using Newton's method, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - 3x^2 - 12x + 5) = 6x^2 - 6x - 12\n\nNow, we will use Newton's method to find the critical points. Newton's method formula is:\n\nx1 = x0 - f'(x0) / f''(x0)\n\nWe need the second derivative of f(x) to apply Newton's method:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (6x^2 - 6x - 12) = 12x - 6\n\nNow, let's apply Newton's method with an initial guess of x0 = 2:\n\nx1 = 2 - (6(2)^2 - 6(2) - 12) / (12(2) - 6)\nx1 = 2 - (24 - 12 - 12) / (24 - 6)\nx1 = 2 - (0) / (18)\nx1 = 2\n\nSince x1 = x0, we have found a critical point at x = 2. Now, we need to determine if this critical point is a minimum. We can do this by checking the concavity of the function at this point using the second derivative:\n\nf''(2) = 12(2) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18\n\nSince f''(2) > 0, the function is concave up at x = 2, which means we have found a local minimum.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum value of f(x) at x = 2:\n\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 - 3(2)^2 - 12(2) + 5 = 16 - 12 - 24 + 5 = -15\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) is -15 when using Newton's method with an initial guess of x0 = 2."
