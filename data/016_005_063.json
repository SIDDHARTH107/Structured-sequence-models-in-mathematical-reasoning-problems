    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each line segment. Let's find the length of the section after each iteration:\n\n1. Original line segment: 1 unit\n2. After 1st iteration: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 units (two segments of 1/3 each)\n3. After 2nd iteration: (2/3) - (2/9) = 4/9 units (four segments of 1/9 each)\n4. After 3rd iteration: (4/9) - (4/27) = 8/27 units (eight segments of 1/27 each)\n5. After 4th iteration: (8/27) - (8/81) = 16/81 units (sixteen segments of 1/81 each)\n\nSo, the length of the section after the first 4 iterations is 16/81 units."
