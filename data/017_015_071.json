    "message_2": "To find the distinct non-abelian groups of order 24, we first note that 24 = 2^3 * 3. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups and their properties.\n\nLet G be a group of order 24. By Sylow's first theorem, G has Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 and Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3.\n\nBy Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow we consider the possible cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Both P and Q are normal in G, so G is a direct product of P and Q, which is abelian. This case does not give a non-abelian group.\n\n2. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q, which is normal in G. The Sylow 2-subgroups are not normal. The semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup P and Q gives a non-abelian group. This case gives one non-abelian group, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_3 extended by a normal subgroup of order 4 (S_3 ⋊ Z_4).\n\n3. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P, which is normal in G. The Sylow 3-subgroups are not normal. The semi-direct product of P and the Sylow 3-subgroup Q gives a non-abelian group. This case gives one non-abelian group, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_8 extended by a normal subgroup of order 3 (D_8 ⋊ Z_3).\n\n4. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4: In this case, neither the Sylow 2-subgroups nor the Sylow 3-subgroups are normal in G. This case gives one non-abelian group, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_4.\n\nIn summary, there are three distinct non-abelian groups of order 24: S_3 ⋊ Z_4, D_8 ⋊ Z_3, and S_4. None of these groups are isomorphic to the alternating group A_5, as A_5 has order 60, not 24."
