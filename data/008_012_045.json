    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations using inverse matrices, we first write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4  5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 7  |\n    | 13 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = (2 * 5) - (3 * 4) = 10 - 12 = -2\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we can find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere adj(A) is the adjugate of matrix A. The adjugate of a 2x2 matrix is found by swapping the elements on the main diagonal and changing the signs of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nadj(A) = |  5  -3 |\n         | -4   2 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (-1/2) * |  5  -3 |\n                  | -4   2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | -5/2  3/2 |\n          |  2    -1 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = | -5/2  3/2 | * | 7  |\n    |  2    -1 |   | 13 |\n\nX = | (-5/2)*7 + (3/2)*13 |\n    |  2*7     - 1*13    |\n\nX = | -35/2 + 39/2 |\n    |  14 - 13     |\n\nX = | 4/2 |\n    | 1   |\n\nX = | 2 |\n    | 1 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 2 and y = 1."
