    "message_2": "To prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra using Liouville's theorem, we will show that any non-constant entire function has at least one zero in the complex plane.\n\nAssume for contradiction that $f(z)$ is a non-constant entire function with no zeros in the complex plane. Then, we can define a new entire function $g(z) = \\frac{1}{f(z)}$. Since $f(z)$ has no zeros, $g(z)$ is well-defined and entire.\n\nNow, we will show that $g(z)$ is bounded. Using the given inequality for $f(z)$, we have:\n\n$$|f(z)| \\leq 5|z|^3 + 6|z|^2 + 7|z| + 8$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is non-constant, there exists a $z_0$ such that $|f(z_0)| > 0$. Let $M = \\max\\{1, |f(z_0)|\\}$. Then, for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, we have:\n\n$$|g(z)| = \\frac{1}{|f(z)|} \\leq \\frac{1}{|f(z_0)|} \\leq \\frac{1}{M}$$\n\nThus, $g(z)$ is a bounded entire function. By Liouville's theorem, $g(z)$ must be a constant function. However, this contradicts our assumption that $f(z)$ is non-constant, since if $g(z)$ is constant, then $f(z)$ must also be constant.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that $f(z)$ has no zeros must be false, and any non-constant entire function must have at least one zero in the complex plane. This proves the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of zeros of $f(z)$ counting multiplicities. Since $f(z)$ is an entire function, it can be factored into its zeros as follows:\n\n$$f(z) = c(z - z_1)^{n_1}(z - z_2)^{n_2} \\cdots (z - z_k)^{n_k}$$\n\nwhere $c$ is a non-zero constant, $z_i$ are the distinct zeros of $f(z)$, and $n_i$ are their respective multiplicities. The total number of zeros of $f(z)$ counting multiplicities is given by the sum of the multiplicities:\n\n$$N = n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_k$$\n\nHowever, we cannot determine the exact value of $N$ without more information about the function $f(z)$."
