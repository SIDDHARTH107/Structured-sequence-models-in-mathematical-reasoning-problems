    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order linear differential equation, we first find the integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by $e^{\\int P(x) dx}$, where $P(x)$ is the coefficient of $y$ in the given equation. In this case, $P(x) = 3$.\n\nSo, the integrating factor is $e^{\\int 3 dx} = e^{3x}$.\n\nNow, we multiply the given differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\n$e^{3x} \\frac{dy}{dx} + 3e^{3x}y = 6e^{3x}$.\n\nThe left-hand side of the equation is now the derivative of the product of $y$ and the integrating factor:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(ye^{3x}) = 6e^{3x}$.\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to $x$:\n\n$\\int \\frac{d}{dx}(ye^{3x}) dx = \\int 6e^{3x} dx$.\n\nThis gives us:\n\n$ye^{3x} = 2e^{3x} + C$.\n\nNow, we use the initial condition $y(0) = 2$:\n\n$2 = 2e^{3(0)} + C$.\n\nThis implies that $C = 0$. So, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\n$y(x) = 2e^{3x}$.\n\nFinally, we find the value of $y$ when $x = 1$:\n\n$y(1) = 2e^{3(1)} = 2e^3$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $y$ when $x = 1$ is $2e^3$."
