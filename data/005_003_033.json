    "message_2": "To find the equation of the regression line, we need to calculate the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b) of the line. The equation of the regression line is given by:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of the number of hours studied (x) and the mean of the scores obtained (y):\n\nx_mean = (4 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 12) / 7 = 55 / 7 ≈ 7.857\ny_mean = (58 + 60 + 68 + 70 + 75 + 80 + 85) / 7 = 496 / 7 ≈ 70.857\n\nNext, we need to calculate the slope (m) of the regression line using the formula:\n\nm = Σ[(x - x_mean)(y - y_mean)] / Σ(x - x_mean)^2\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and denominator separately:\n\nNumerator:\n(4 - 7.857)(58 - 70.857) + (5 - 7.857)(60 - 70.857) + (7 - 7.857)(68 - 70.857) + (8 - 7.857)(70 - 70.857) + (9 - 7.857)(75 - 70.857) + (10 - 7.857)(80 - 70.857) + (12 - 7.857)(85 - 70.857) ≈ 99.428\n\nDenominator:\n(4 - 7.857)^2 + (5 - 7.857)^2 + (7 - 7.857)^2 + (8 - 7.857)^2 + (9 - 7.857)^2 + (10 - 7.857)^2 + (12 - 7.857)^2 ≈ 47.429\n\nNow, let's calculate the slope (m):\n\nm = 99.428 / 47.429 ≈ 2.097\n\nNow, we need to calculate the y-intercept (b) using the formula:\n\nb = y_mean - m * x_mean\nb = 70.857 - 2.097 * 7.857 ≈ 54.045\n\nFinally, the equation of the regression line is:\n\ny = 2.097x + 54.045"
