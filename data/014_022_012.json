    "message_2": "To determine the encryption key matrix used to encrypt the message, we need to analyze the given encrypted and decrypted messages. In a Playfair cipher, letters are encrypted in pairs. Let's first break down the messages into pairs:\n\nEncrypted message: RR KE YG QI SW\nDecrypted message: HE LL OW OR LD\n\nNow, let's analyze the pairs and find the corresponding positions in the key matrix:\n\n1. RR -> HE: R moves horizontally to H, R moves vertically to E.\n2. KE -> LL: K moves horizontally to L, E moves horizontally to L.\n3. YG -> OW: Y moves vertically to O, G moves horizontally to W.\n4. QI -> OR: Q moves vertically to O, I moves horizontally to R.\n5. SW -> LD: S moves horizontally to L, W moves vertically to D.\n\nBased on these movements, we can construct the key matrix:\n\n```\nH E L L O\nW O R L D\nA B C F G\nI J K M N\nP Q S T U\nV X Y Z\n```\n\nNote that the key matrix is not unique, as the letters in the matrix can be rearranged while still producing the same encrypted message. However, this is one possible encryption key matrix used to encrypt the given message."
