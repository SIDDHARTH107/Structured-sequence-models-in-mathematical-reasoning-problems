    "message_2": "To solve the equation |3x - 7| = 10, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 7 is positive or zero\nIn this case, we have:\n3x - 7 = 10\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n3x = 17\nx = 17/3\n\nCase 2: 3x - 7 is negative\nIn this case, we have:\n-(3x - 7) = 10\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n3x - 7 = -10\n3x = -3\nx = -1\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 17/3 and -1."
