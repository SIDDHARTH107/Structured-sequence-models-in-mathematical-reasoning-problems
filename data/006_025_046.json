    "message_1": "A magician will perform a card trick in a show. The magician has a deck of 52 playing cards, which includes 13 cards each of spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. Before the trick begins, the magician secretly selects a card from the deck. If the selected card is a spade or a heart, the magician will perform a dangerous stunt. If the selected card is a diamond or a club, the magician will perform a simple stunt. What is the probability that the magician will perform a dangerous stunt?",
    "message_2": "There are 13 spades and 13 hearts in the deck, making a total of 26 cards that would lead to a dangerous stunt. There are 52 cards in total. The probability of the magician selecting a card that leads to a dangerous stunt is the number of dangerous stunt cards divided by the total number of cards:\n\nProbability = (Number of dangerous stunt cards) / (Total number of cards) = 26 / 52 = 1/2 or 50%."
