    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of X with base point p, we will first consider the loops in X based at p. A loop is a continuous function from the interval [0, 1] to X such that the starting and ending points are both p.\n\nLet f: [0, 1] → X be a loop based at p. Since f(t) is a point on the unit circle, we can write f(t) = e^(2πitθ(t)) for some continuous function θ: [0, 1] → ℝ. Note that θ(0) = θ(1) = 0, as f(0) = f(1) = p = 1.\n\nNow, we can define a homomorphism Φ: π₁(X, p) → ℤ as follows:\n\nΦ([f]) = θ(1) - θ(0),\n\nwhere [f] denotes the homotopy class of the loop f.\n\nIt is easy to see that Φ is well-defined, as if two loops f and g are homotopic, then their corresponding functions θ_f and θ_g must also be homotopic, and hence Φ([f]) = Φ([g]).\n\nMoreover, Φ is a group homomorphism, as for two loops f and g, we have:\n\nΦ([f] * [g]) = Φ([f * g]) = θ_f(1) + θ_g(1) - θ_f(0) - θ_g(0) = Φ([f]) + Φ([g]).\n\nNow, we claim that Φ is an isomorphism. To show this, we need to prove that Φ is both injective and surjective.\n\nInjectivity: Suppose Φ([f]) = Φ([g]) for two loops f and g. Then θ_f(1) - θ_f(0) = θ_g(1) - θ_g(0), which implies that θ_f(1) = θ_g(1). Since θ_f and θ_g are continuous functions, we can find a homotopy H: [0, 1] × [0, 1] → X between them, defined as:\n\nH(t, s) = e^(2πit(sθ_g(t) + (1 - s)θ_f(t))).\n\nH is continuous, and H(t, 0) = f(t) and H(t, 1) = g(t) for all t ∈ [0, 1]. Thus, f and g are homotopic, and Φ is injective.\n\nSurjectivity: Given any integer n, we can define a loop f_n: [0, 1] → X as f_n(t) = e^(2πint). Then Φ([f_n]) = n, which shows that Φ is surjective.\n\nSince Φ is both injective and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, the fundamental group of X with base point p is isomorphic to the integers, i.e., π₁(X, p) ≅ ℤ."
