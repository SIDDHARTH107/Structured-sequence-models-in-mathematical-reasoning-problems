    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = |x| on the interval [-π, π], we first need to determine if the function is even or odd. Since f(-x) = |-x| = |x| = f(x), the function is even. Therefore, we only need to find the cosine terms in the Fourier series.\n\nThe Fourier series of an even function is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_0 and a_n are the Fourier coefficients, which can be calculated as follows:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)]dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)]dx from -π to π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[|x|]dx from -π to π\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[-x]dx from -π to 0 + ∫[x]dx from 0 to π]\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/2)x^2 from -π to 0 + (1/2)x^2 from 0 to π]\na_0 = (1/π) * [0 - (1/2)(-π)^2 + (1/2)(π)^2 - 0]\na_0 = (1/π) * (1/2)(π)^2\na_0 = π/2\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[|x| * cos(n * x)]dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[-x * cos(n * x)]dx from -π to 0 + ∫[x * cos(n * x)]dx from 0 to π]\n\nTo evaluate these integrals, we'll use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = cos(n * x)dx, then du = dx and v = (1/n)sin(n * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫[u * dv] = u * v - ∫[v * du]\n\nFor the first integral (from -π to 0):\n\n∫[-x * cos(n * x)]dx = -x * (1/n)sin(n * x) - ∫[(1/n)sin(n * x)]dx\n= -(1/n)[x * sin(n * x) - ∫[sin(n * x)]dx] from -π to 0\n= -(1/n)[x * sin(n * x) + (1/n)cos(n * x)] from -π to 0\n\nFor the second integral (from 0 to π):\n\n∫[x * cos(n * x)]dx = x * (1/n)sin(n * x) - ∫[(1/n)sin(n * x)]dx\n= (1/n)[x * sin(n * x) - ∫[sin(n * x)]dx] from 0 to π\n= (1/n)[x * sin(n * x) - (1/n)cos(n * x)] from 0 to π\n\nNow, substitute the limits:\n\na_n = (1/π) * {-(1/n)[(-π) * sin(-n * π) + (1/n)cos(-n * π)] - (1/n)[0 * sin(0) - (1/n)cos(0)] + (1/n)[π * sin(n * π) - (1/n)cos(n * π)] - (1/n)[0 * sin(0) - (1/n)cos(0)]}\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 and cos(n * π) = (-1)^n, we have:\n\na_n = (1/π) * {-(1/n)[(-π) * 0 + (1/n)(-1)^n] + (1/n)[π * 0 - (1/n)(-1)^n]}\na_n = (1/π) * {(-1)^n * (1/n^2)}\n\nSo, the Fourier series of f(x) = |x| on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = π/2 + Σ [((-1)^n * (1/n^2)) * cos(n * x)]"
