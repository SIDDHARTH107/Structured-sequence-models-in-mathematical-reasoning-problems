    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of bags of 4 apples as x, the number of bags of 5 apples as y, and the number of bags of 7 apples as z. We want to find the minimum values of x, y, and z such that:\n\n4x + 5y + 7z = 92\n\nWe can start by trying different values for x, y, and z to see if we can find a combination that satisfies the equation. \n\nFor example, let's try x = 1:\n5y + 7z = 88\nNow, let's try y = 1:\n5 + 7z = 88\n7z = 83\nUnfortunately, 83 is not divisible by 7, so we need to try a different value for y.\n\nLet's try y = 2:\n10 + 7z = 88\n7z = 78\nz = 78 / 7 = 11.142857...\nSince z must be an integer, this combination doesn't work either.\n\nLet's try y = 3:\n15 + 7z = 88\n7z = 73\nAgain, 73 is not divisible by 7, so we need to try a different value for y.\n\nLet's try y = 4:\n20 + 7z = 88\n7z = 68\nz = 68 / 7 = 9.714285...\nThis combination doesn't work either.\n\nLet's try y = 5:\n25 + 7z = 88\n7z = 63\nz = 63 / 7 = 9\nThis combination works!\n\nSo, we have x = 1, y = 5, and z = 9. The minimum number of bags needed is x + y + z = 1 + 5 + 9 = 15 bags."
