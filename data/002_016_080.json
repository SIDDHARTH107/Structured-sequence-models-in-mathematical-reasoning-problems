    "message_1": "A triangle has an area of 36 sq. cm. If it is an equilateral triangle, what is the length of each side?",
    "message_2": "To find the side length of an equilateral triangle given its area, we can use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:\n\nArea = (sqrt(3) / 4) * side^2\n\nWe are given the area as 36 sq. cm. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n36 = (sqrt(3) / 4) * side^2\n\nNow, we need to solve for the side length:\n\nside^2 = 36 * (4 / sqrt(3))\nside^2 = 144 / sqrt(3)\nside^2 = 144 * (sqrt(3) / 3) (multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(3) to rationalize the denominator)\nside^2 = 48 * sqrt(3)\nside = sqrt(48 * sqrt(3))\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nside â‰ˆ 6 * sqrt(3)\n\nSo, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is approximately 6 * sqrt(3) cm."
