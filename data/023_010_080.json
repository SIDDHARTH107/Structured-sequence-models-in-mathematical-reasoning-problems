    "message_1": "Suppose an image has a resolution of 512 x 512 pixels. Apply the Fourier transform to this image to obtain the frequency domain representation. Calculate the number of unique frequency components in the resulting frequency domain representation.",
    "message_2": "When we apply the Fourier transform to a 512 x 512 image, we obtain a frequency domain representation of the same size, i.e., 512 x 512 complex numbers. However, due to the Hermitian symmetry property of the Fourier transform for real-valued signals (which is the case for most images), we only need to consider half of the frequency components along each axis.\n\nFor a 512 x 512 frequency domain representation, we have:\n\n- 256 unique frequency components along the horizontal axis (excluding the Nyquist frequency)\n- 256 unique frequency components along the vertical axis (excluding the Nyquist frequency)\n- 1 unique frequency component for the Nyquist frequency along the horizontal axis\n- 1 unique frequency component for the Nyquist frequency along the vertical axis\n\nSo, the total number of unique frequency components is:\n\n(256 x 256) + (256 + 256) + 1 = 65,793\n\nTherefore, there are 65,793 unique frequency components in the resulting frequency domain representation."
