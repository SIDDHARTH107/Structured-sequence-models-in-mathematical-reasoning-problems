The wire is shaped as a quarter-circle with radius 1 meter in the xy-plane, centered at the origin, and oriented in the xy-plane. Find the magnetic field generated by the current at a point (0,0,3). Assume that the permeability of free space is μ0 = 4π × 10^−7 H/m.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field generated by the current at point (0,0,3), we will use the Biot-Savart Law. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ0 * I * dl x r) / (4π * |r|^3)\n\nwhere μ0 is the permeability of free space, I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the wire, r is the position vector from the current element to the point, and x denotes the cross product.\n\nSince the wire is shaped as a quarter-circle with radius 1 meter, we can parameterize it using the angle θ as follows:\n\nx = cos(θ)\ny = sin(θ)\nz = 0\n\nThe differential length vector dl can be found by taking the derivative of the position vector with respect to θ:\n\ndl/dθ = (-sin(θ), cos(θ), 0)\n\nThe position vector r from the current element to the point (0,0,3) is:\n\nr = (0 - cos(θ), 0 - sin(θ), 3)\n\nNow we can find the cross product dl x r:\n\ndl x r = (3cos(θ), 3sin(θ), cos(θ)sin(θ) + sin(θ)cos(θ))\n\nThe magnitude of the position vector |r| is:\n\n|r| = sqrt((0 - cos(θ))^2 + (0 - sin(θ))^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(1 + 9) = sqrt(10)\n\nNow we can substitute everything into the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ0 * I * dl x r) / (4π * |r|^3)\n\nIntegrating this expression over the entire wire (from θ = 0 to θ = π/2) will give us the total magnetic field B at the point (0,0,3):\n\nB = ∫(μ0 * I * dl x r) / (4π * |r|^3) dθ from 0 to π/2\n\nB = (μ0 * I / (4π * (sqrt(10))^3)) * ∫(3cos(θ), 3sin(θ), cos(θ)sin(θ) + sin(θ)cos(θ)) dθ from 0 to π/2\n\nIntegrating each component separately:\n\nBx = (μ0 * I / (4π * (sqrt(10))^3)) * ∫(3cos(θ)) dθ from 0 to π/2\nBy = (μ0 * I / (4π * (sqrt(10))^3)) * ∫(3sin(θ)) dθ from 0 to π/2\nBz = (μ0 * I / (4π * (sqrt(10))^3)) * ∫(cos(θ)sin(θ) + sin(θ)cos(θ)) dθ from 0 to π/2\n\nBx = (μ0 * I / (4π * (sqrt(10))^3)) * [3sin(θ)] from 0 to π/2 = (μ0 * I / (4π * (sqrt(10))^3)) * 3\nBy = (μ0 * I / (4π * (sqrt(10))^3)) * [-3cos(θ)] from 0 to π/2 = (μ0 * I / (4π * (sqrt(10))^3)) * (-3)\nBz = (μ0 * I / (4π * (sqrt(10))^3)) * [sin^2(θ)] from 0 to π/2 = (μ0 * I / (4π * (sqrt(10))^3)) * 1\n\nNow we can substitute the values of μ0 and I:\n\nBx = (4π × 10^−7 H/m * 4 A / (4π * (sqrt(10))^3)) * 3 = (12 × 10^−7 H/m) / 10√10\nBy = (4π × 10^−7 H/m * 4 A / (4π * (sqrt(10))^3)) * (-3) = (-12 × 10^−7 H/m) / 10√10\nBz = (4π × 10^−7 H/m * 4 A / (4π * (sqrt(10))^3)) * 1 = (4 × 10^−7 H/m) / 10√10\n\nSo the magnetic field generated by the current at the point (0,0,3) is:\n\nB = (Bx, By, Bz) = ((12 × 10^−7 H/m) / 10√10, (-12 × 10^−7 H/m) / 10√10, (4 × 10^−7 H/m) / 10√10)"
