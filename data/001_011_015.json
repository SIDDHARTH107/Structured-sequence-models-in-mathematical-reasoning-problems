    "message_2": "To solve for \"x\" in the equation (2x-5)/(x+3) = 1/4, we can start by cross-multiplying:\n\n(2x - 5)(4) = (x + 3)(1)\n\nNow, distribute the numbers:\n\n8x - 20 = x + 3\n\nNext, subtract x from both sides:\n\n7x - 20 = 3\n\nNow, add 20 to both sides:\n\n7x = 23\n\nFinally, divide by 7:\n\nx = 23/7"
