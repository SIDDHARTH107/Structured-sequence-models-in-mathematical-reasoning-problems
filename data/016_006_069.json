    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern fractal is generated using an iterated function system (IFS) with four affine transformations. The second largest fern in the fractal is generated by the transformation with a scaling factor of 0.85 in both x and y directions.\n\nTo find the ratio of the areas, we can use the fact that the area of a scaled shape is proportional to the square of the scaling factor. In this case, the scaling factor is 0.85.\n\nSo, the ratio of the area of the second largest fern to the largest fern is:\n\n(0.85)^2 = 0.7225\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the ratio is 0.72."
