    "message_1": "A factory has 8 different machines, each with a unique serial number. In how many ways can the factory line supervisor select 4 machines to place in a row for the workers to operate on, such that no two adjacent machines have consecutive serial numbers?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the numbers 1 to 8 to represent the serial numbers of the machines. We need to select 4 machines such that no two adjacent machines have consecutive serial numbers.\n\nWe can break this problem down into cases:\n\nCase 1: The smallest serial number selected is 1.\nThe remaining 3 machines must be selected from the set {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. We can choose 3 machines from this set in C(6, 3) ways, where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nCase 2: The smallest serial number selected is 2.\nThe remaining 3 machines must be selected from the set {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. We can choose 3 machines from this set in C(5, 3) ways.\n\nCase 3: The largest serial number selected is 8.\nThe remaining 3 machines must be selected from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. We can choose 3 machines from this set in C(6, 3) ways.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the overlapping cases, which are the cases where both the smallest serial number is 2 and the largest serial number is 8.\n\nOverlapping Case: The smallest serial number selected is 2 and the largest serial number selected is 8.\nThe remaining 2 machines must be selected from the set {4, 5, 6}. We can choose 2 machines from this set in C(3, 2) ways.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to select 4 machines with no consecutive serial numbers is:\n\nTotal = (Case 1) + (Case 2) + (Case 3) - (Overlapping Case)\nTotal = C(6, 3) + C(5, 3) + C(6, 3) - C(3, 2)\nTotal = 20 + 10 + 20 - 3\nTotal = 47\n\nTherefore, there are 47 ways to select 4 machines such that no two adjacent machines have consecutive serial numbers."
