    "message_1": "A certain type of technological system has 8 critical components, each with a probability of failure of 0.05. What is the probability that at least one critical component fails?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one critical component fails, it's easier to first find the probability that none of the components fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single component does not fail is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince there are 8 critical components, the probability that all of them do not fail is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(all components do not fail) = 0.95^8 ≈ 0.663420\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one component fails:\n\nP(at least one component fails) = 1 - P(all components do not fail) = 1 - 0.663420 ≈ 0.336580\n\nSo, the probability that at least one critical component fails is approximately 0.336580 or 33.658%."
