    "message_2": "To find the probability of rolling a total of 7 with two fair six-sided dice, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a 7) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (all possible rolls with two dice).\n\nThere are 6 sides on each die, so there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a 7). There are 6 possible combinations that result in a total of 7:\n\n1. Die 1 shows 1, and Die 2 shows 6 (1+6=7)\n2. Die 1 shows 2, and Die 2 shows 5 (2+5=7)\n3. Die 1 shows 3, and Die 2 shows 4 (3+4=7)\n4. Die 1 shows 4, and Die 2 shows 3 (4+3=7)\n5. Die 1 shows 5, and Die 2 shows 2 (5+2=7)\n6. Die 1 shows 6, and Die 2 shows 1 (6+1=7)\n\nThere are 6 favorable outcomes.\n\nThe probability of rolling a total of 7 with two fair six-sided dice is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nP(rolling a 7) = (favorable outcomes) / (total possible outcomes) = 6/36 = 1/6\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a total of 7 with two fair six-sided dice is 1/6 or approximately 0.1667 (rounded to four decimal places)."
