In this case, the intersection of A and B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {6}\n\nNow, we need to prove that this intersection is a subset of both sets A and B. \n\nA subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set. In other words, if C is a subset of A, then every element in C is also an element in A. The same applies to B.\n\nLet's check if the intersection A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\n{6} ⊆ A\n\nSince 6 is an element of A, the intersection A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if the intersection A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\n{6} ⊆ B\n\nSince 6 is an element of B, the intersection A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the intersection of sets A and B, which is {6}, is a subset of both sets A and B."
