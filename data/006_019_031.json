A survey indicates that the probability of a citizen voting for the first party is 0.25, for the second party is 0.2, for the third party is 0.15, for the fourth party is 0.1 and for the last party is 0.3. What is the probability that a citizen will vote for either the third or fourth party?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a citizen will vote for either the third or fourth party, we simply add the probabilities of voting for the third party and the fourth party together.\n\nProbability of voting for the third party: 0.15\nProbability of voting for the fourth party: 0.1\n\nProbability of voting for either the third or fourth party = 0.15 + 0.1 = 0.25."
