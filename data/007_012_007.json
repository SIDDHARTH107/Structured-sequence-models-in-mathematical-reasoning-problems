    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that satisfies the condition of Wilson's theorem, we can test prime numbers starting from the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\nFor p = 2, (2-1)! + 1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is divisible by 2.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that satisfies the condition of Wilson's theorem is 2."
