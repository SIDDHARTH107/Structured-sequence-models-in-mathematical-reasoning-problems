    "message_1": "Let A be a set such that A = {2, 4, 6, 8}. \na) Find the complement of A. \nb) Determine the intersection of A and its complement. Is it the empty set? Prove your answer.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we need to know the universal set, which is the set containing all elements under consideration. Since the universal set is not provided, I will assume that the universal set is the set of all integers, denoted by Z.\n\na) The complement of A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in A. In this case, A' contains all integers that are not in A = {2, 4, 6, 8}. Therefore, A' = Z - A = {..., -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...}.\n\nb) The intersection of A and its complement, denoted by A ∩ A', is the set of all elements that are common to both A and A'. Since A contains only even numbers and A' contains all integers that are not in A (which includes all odd numbers and all even numbers not in A), there are no common elements between A and A'. Therefore, A ∩ A' = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nProof: Let x be an element in A ∩ A'. By definition of intersection, x must be in both A and A'. However, this contradicts the definition of the complement, as an element cannot be in both a set and its complement. Therefore, there can be no such element x, and A ∩ A' must be the empty set."
