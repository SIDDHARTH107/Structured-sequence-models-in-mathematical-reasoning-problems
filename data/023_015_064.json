    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and phase of the harmonic components of the pulse, we need to compute the Fourier transform of the rectangular pulse function. Let's denote the rectangular pulse function as f(x), where f(x) = 2 for 0 <= x <= 4 and f(x) = 0 elsewhere.\n\nThe Fourier transform of f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-i * k * x)] dx\n\nwhere F(k) is the Fourier transform of f(x), i is the imaginary unit, and k is the frequency variable.\n\nSince f(x) is non-zero only in the interval [0, 4], we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nF(k) = ∫[2 * e^(-i * k * x)] dx from 0 to 4\n\nNow, let's compute the integral:\n\nF(k) = [-2 * (1 / (-i * k)) * e^(-i * k * x)] from 0 to 4\nF(k) = [-2 * (1 / (-i * k)) * (e^(-4 * i * k) - e^(0))]\nF(k) = (2 / i * k) * (1 - e^(-4 * i * k))\n\nNow, let's find the amplitude and phase of the harmonic components at times t=0 and t=2.\n\nAt t=0, the pulse is initially located at x=0, so the amplitude and phase are given by the magnitude and argument of F(k) at k=0:\n\nAmplitude = |F(0)| = |(2 / i * 0) * (1 - e^(0))| = 0 (since the denominator is 0)\nPhase = arg(F(0)) = undefined (since the amplitude is 0)\n\nAt t=2, the pulse has translated along the x-axis, so the amplitude and phase are given by the magnitude and argument of F(k) at k=2:\n\nAmplitude = |F(2)| = |(2 / i * 2) * (1 - e^(-8 * i))|\nAmplitude = |(1 / i) * (1 - e^(-8 * i))|\n\nTo find the magnitude, we can rewrite the complex number in polar form:\n\n1 - e^(-8 * i) = 1 - (cos(-8) + i * sin(-8))\nMagnitude = |(1 / i) * (1 - e^(-8 * i))| = sqrt((1 - cos(-8))^2 + (sin(-8))^2)\n\nPhase = arg(F(2)) = atan2(sin(-8), 1 - cos(-8))\n\nSo, the amplitude and phase of the harmonic components of the pulse at times t=0 and t=2 are:\n\nt=0: Amplitude = 0, Phase = undefined\nt=2: Amplitude = sqrt((1 - cos(-8))^2 + (sin(-8))^2), Phase = atan2(sin(-8), 1 - cos(-8))"
