    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(2x+1) + log(x-3) = 2, we can first use the logarithm property that states that the sum of two logarithms with the same base is equal to the logarithm of the product of their arguments. In this case, we have:\n\nlog((2x+1)(x-3)) = 2\n\nNow, we can remove the logarithm by raising both sides of the equation to the base 10 (since the logarithm is base 10 by default):\n\n(2x+1)(x-3) = 10^2\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n2x^2 - 6x + x - 3 = 100\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\n2x^2 - 5x - 3 = 100\n\nSubtract 100 from both sides to set the equation to 0:\n\n2x^2 - 5x - 103 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -5, and c = -103. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (5 ± √((-5)^2 - 4(2)(-103))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (5 ± √(25 + 824)) / 4\n\nx = (5 ± √849) / 4\n\nSo, the two possible values for x are:\n\nx = (5 + √849) / 4 and x = (5 - √849) / 4\n\nHowever, we need to check if these values are valid for the original equation, since logarithms are only defined for positive arguments. \n\nFor x = (5 + √849) / 4:\n\n2x + 1 > 0 and x - 3 > 0\n\n(5 + √849) / 2 + 1 > 0 and (5 + √849) / 4 - 3 > 0\n\nBoth conditions are true, so this value of x is valid.\n\nFor x = (5 - √849) / 4:\n\n2x + 1 > 0 and x - 3 > 0\n\n(5 - √849) / 2 + 1 > 0 and (5 - √849) / 4 - 3 > 0\n\nThe second condition is false, so this value of x is not valid.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is:\n\nx = (5 + √849) / 4"
