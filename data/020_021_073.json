    "message_2": "To determine the optimal schedule for producing the maximum profit, we need to calculate the profit per hour for each product and then prioritize the production based on the highest profit per hour.\n\nProfit per hour for each product:\n\n1. $10 / 30 hours = $0.33 per hour\n2. $15 / 45 hours = $0.33 per hour\n3. $8 / 25 hours = $0.32 per hour\n4. $20 / 60 hours = $0.33 per hour\n5. $16 / 50 hours = $0.32 per hour\n6. $12 / 30 hours = $0.40 per hour\n7. $18 / 55 hours = $0.33 per hour\n8. $9 / 20 hours = $0.45 per hour\n9. $11 / 55 hours = $0.20 per hour\n10. $7 / 15 hours = $0.47 per hour\n\nBased on the profit per hour, the priority order for production is: 10, 8, 6, 1, 2, 4, 7, 5, 3, and 9.\n\nNow, we need to allocate the 20,000 hours of production time to these products based on their priority order and production time.\n\n1. Product 10: 15 hours * x = 15x\n2. Product 8: 20 hours * y = 20y\n3. Product 6: 30 hours * z = 30z\n4. Product 1: 30 hours * a = 30a\n5. Product 2: 45 hours * b = 45b\n6. Product 4: 60 hours * c = 60c\n7. Product 7: 55 hours * d = 55d\n8. Product 5: 50 hours * e = 50e\n9. Product 3: 25 hours * f = 25f\n10. Product 9: 55 hours * g = 55g\n\nThe total production time equation is:\n\n15x + 20y + 30z + 30a + 45b + 60c + 55d + 50e + 25f + 55g <= 20,000 hours\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to produce as many units of the highest priority products as possible within the given production time. We can start by producing product 10 and then move down the priority list until we reach the maximum production time.\n\nLet's assume we produce the maximum number of units for each product in the priority order until we reach the limit of 20,000 hours:\n\n1. Product 10: 15 hours * 1333 units = 19,995 hours (remaining hours: 5)\n2. Product 8: Not enough hours remaining to produce any units.\n3. Product 6: Not enough hours remaining to produce any units.\n4. Product 1: Not enough hours remaining to produce any units.\n5. Product 2: Not enough hours remaining to produce any units.\n6. Product 4: Not enough hours remaining to produce any units.\n7. Product 7: Not enough hours remaining to produce any units.\n8. Product 5: Not enough hours remaining to produce any units.\n9. Product 3: Not enough hours remaining to produce any units.\n10. Product 9: Not enough hours remaining to produce any units.\n\nThe optimal schedule for producing the maximum profit is to produce 1333 units of product 10, using 19,995 hours of production time, with 5 hours remaining unused.\n\nThe total profit from this production schedule is:\n\n1333 units * $7 per unit = $9,331."
