    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum modulus of f(z) in the closed unit disk |z| ≤ 1, we will use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that the maximum modulus of a holomorphic function in a closed and bounded domain occurs on the boundary of the domain.\n\nSince f(z) is holomorphic in the closed unit disk, we can apply the Maximum Modulus Principle. The boundary of the closed unit disk is the unit circle, given by |z| = 1. Let z = e^(iθ) where θ ∈ [0, 2π]. Then, we can rewrite f(z) in terms of θ:\n\nf(e^(iθ)) = (e^(iθ))^3 - 2(e^(iθ))^2 + 2\n= e^(3iθ) - 2e^(2iθ) + 2\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum and minimum modulus of f(e^(iθ)). To do this, we will find the modulus of f(e^(iθ)):\n\n|f(e^(iθ))| = |e^(3iθ) - 2e^(2iθ) + 2|\n\nUsing the triangle inequality, we have:\n\n|f(e^(iθ))| ≤ |e^(3iθ)| + |-2e^(2iθ)| + |2|\n= 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\n\nNow, we want to find when the equality holds. This occurs when e^(3iθ), -2e^(2iθ), and 2 are collinear. Let's consider the case when -2e^(2iθ) is between e^(3iθ) and 2:\n\ne^(3iθ) - 2e^(2iθ) = 2 - e^(3iθ)\ne^(iθ)(e^(2iθ) - 2) = 2 - e^(3iθ)\n\nSince |e^(iθ)| = 1, we have:\n\ne^(2iθ) - 2 = 2 - e^(3iθ)\n\nNow, let w = e^(iθ). Then, w^2 - 2 = 2 - w^3. Rearranging the terms, we get:\n\nw^3 - w^2 + 2 = 0\n\nWe want to find the values of θ for which this equation holds. The equation has one real root and two complex conjugate roots. The real root corresponds to the minimum modulus, and the complex conjugate roots correspond to the maximum modulus.\n\nThe real root is approximately w ≈ 0.816, which gives us the minimum modulus:\n\n|f(0.816)| ≈ 0.669\n\nThe complex conjugate roots are approximately w ≈ 0.092 ± 0.995i, which give us the maximum modulus:\n\n|f(0.092 + 0.995i)| ≈ 4.485\n\nTherefore, the maximum modulus of f(z) in the closed unit disk |z| ≤ 1 is approximately 4.485, and the minimum modulus is approximately 0.669."
