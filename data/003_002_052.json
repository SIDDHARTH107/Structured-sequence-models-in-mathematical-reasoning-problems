    "message_2": "The value of the tangent of 45 degrees is 1. In a right-angled triangle, when the two non-right angles are both 45 degrees, the two legs are of equal length. Therefore, the tangent of 45 degrees, which is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side, is 1."
