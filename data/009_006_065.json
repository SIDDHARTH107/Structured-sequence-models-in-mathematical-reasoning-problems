    "message_1": "Consider a chemical reaction where the concentration of reactant A is decreasing at a rate proportional to the square of its concentration. If the initial concentration of A is 5 mol/L, and after 1 hour its concentration decreases to 3 mol/L, what is the concentration of A after 3 hours?",
    "message_2": "Let the concentration of reactant A at time t be denoted as A(t). According to the problem, the rate of decrease of A is proportional to the square of its concentration. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\ndA/dt = -k * A^2\n\nwhere dA/dt is the rate of change of A with respect to time, k is the proportionality constant, and A^2 is the square of the concentration of A.\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndA/A^2 = -k dt\n\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/A^2) dA = -k ∫dt\n\n-1/A = -kt + C\n\nwhere C is the integration constant.\n\nNow, we use the initial condition A(0) = 5 mol/L:\n\n-1/5 = -k(0) + C\n\nC = -1/5\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n-1/A = -kt - 1/5\n\nNow, we use the information that A(1) = 3 mol/L:\n\n-1/3 = -k(1) - 1/5\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\nk = 1/5 - 1/3 = (3 - 5)/15 = -2/15\n\nNow, we want to find the concentration A(3). Plugging t = 3 into the equation:\n\n-1/A = -(-2/15)(3) - 1/5\n\n-1/A = 6/15 - 3/15\n\n-1/A = 3/15\n\nA = -15/3\n\nA(3) = 5 mol/L\n\nThe concentration of A after 3 hours is 5 mol/L."
