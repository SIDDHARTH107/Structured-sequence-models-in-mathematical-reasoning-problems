    "message_2": "There are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36. We can classify them as follows:\n\n1. Cyclic group: There is one cyclic group of order 36, denoted by C_36. It is generated by an element of order 36. This group is abelian since all cyclic groups are abelian.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: There are two possible direct products of two cyclic groups of orders 4 and 9, namely C_4 × C_9 and C_2 × C_18. Both of these groups are abelian since the direct product of abelian groups is abelian.\n\n3. Semi-direct product of two cyclic groups: The semi-direct product of two cyclic groups C_9 and C_4, denoted by C_9 ⋊ C_4, is a non-abelian group. This group is not isomorphic to any of the previously mentioned groups.\n\nIn summary, there are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36: one cyclic and abelian (C_36), two abelian (C_4 × C_9 and C_2 × C_18), and one non-abelian (C_9 ⋊ C_4)."
