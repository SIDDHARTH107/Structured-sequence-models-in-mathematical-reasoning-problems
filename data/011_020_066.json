    "message_1": "A factory needs to package 800 candies into identical jars containing either 20 candies or 50 candies. What is the minimum number of jars required to package all the candies, assuming that the factory cannot break open a jar once it has been filled with candies?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of jars containing 20 candies as x and the number of jars containing 50 candies as y. We want to minimize the total number of jars (x + y) while still packaging all 800 candies. The equation representing the total number of candies is:\n\n20x + 50y = 800\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 10:\n\n2x + 5y = 80\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. We can start by finding the maximum value of x that still allows for a positive integer value of y:\n\nIf x = 40, then 2(40) + 5y = 80, which simplifies to 5y = 0, and y = 0. However, this solution means that there are no jars containing 50 candies, which is not allowed since the jars must be identical.\n\nNext, we can try decreasing the value of x and checking if it results in a positive integer value for y:\n\nIf x = 39, then 2(39) + 5y = 80, which simplifies to 5y = 2, and y is not an integer.\n\nIf x = 38, then 2(38) + 5y = 80, which simplifies to 5y = 4, and y is not an integer.\n\nIf x = 37, then 2(37) + 5y = 80, which simplifies to 5y = 6, and y is not an integer.\n\nIf x = 36, then 2(36) + 5y = 80, which simplifies to 5y = 8, and y = 1.6, which is not an integer.\n\nIf x = 35, then 2(35) + 5y = 80, which simplifies to 5y = 10, and y = 2.\n\nSo, the minimum number of jars required to package all the candies is x + y = 35 + 2 = 37 jars."
