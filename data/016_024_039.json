    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by repeatedly removing the central square from each remaining square in a grid. The initial grid is a 3x3 square, and after each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 smaller squares, with the central square being removed.\n\nAfter the first iteration, there are 8 black squares out of 9 total squares. In each subsequent iteration, each remaining black square is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the central square is removed, leaving 8 smaller black squares. \n\nLet's calculate the fraction of black squares after 5 iterations:\n\nIteration 1: 8/9 black squares\nIteration 2: (8/9)^2 = 64/81 black squares\nIteration 3: (8/9)^3 = 512/729 black squares\nIteration 4: (8/9)^4 = 4096/6561 black squares\nIteration 5: (8/9)^5 = 32768/59049 black squares\n\nAfter 5 iterations, the fraction of the Sierpinski carpet filled with black squares is 32,768/59,049."
