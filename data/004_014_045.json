    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone using integration, we'll first consider the cone as a series of infinitesimally small disks stacked on top of each other. Each disk has a radius r, a height of dh, and a volume of dV = πr^2dh.\n\nThe radius of each disk is a function of its height, h, from the tip of the cone. We can find this function by using similar triangles. Let R be the radius of the base of the cone (4 cm) and H be the height of the cone (10 cm). Then, we have:\n\nr / h = R / H\nr = (R / H) * h\nr = (4 / 10) * h\nr = 2/5 * h\n\nNow, we can express the volume of each disk in terms of h:\n\ndV = π(2/5 * h)^2 dh\ndV = (4π/25) * h^2 dh\n\nTo find the total volume of the cone, we'll integrate this expression with respect to h from 0 to H:\n\nV = ∫(4π/25) * h^2 dh from 0 to 10\nV = (4π/25) * ∫h^2 dh from 0 to 10\n\nNow, we'll integrate h^2 with respect to h:\n\n∫h^2 dh = (1/3)h^3 + C\n\nNow, we'll apply the limits of integration:\n\nV = (4π/25) * [(1/3)(10)^3 - (1/3)(0)^3]\nV = (4π/25) * (1/3) * 1000\nV = (4π/75) * 1000\n\nV = (4000π/75) cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is approximately 167.55 cm³."
