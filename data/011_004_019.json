    "message_1": "A team of 5 basketball players consists of two guards, two forwards, and one center. How many different lineups can the coach choose if there are 8 guards, 6 forwards, and 4 centers to select from?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of different lineups, we can use the combination formula for each position and then multiply the results together.\n\nFor the guards, there are 8 guards to choose from, and we need to choose 2. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. So for the guards, we have:\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 8! / (2!6!) = (8*7*6!)/(2*6!) = 28\n\nFor the forwards, there are 6 forwards to choose from, and we need to choose 2:\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 6! / (2!4!) = (6*5*4!)/(2*4!) = 15\n\nFor the center, there are 4 centers to choose from, and we need to choose 1:\n\nC(4, 1) = 4! / (1!(4-1)!) = 4! / (1!3!) = (4*3!)/(1*3!) = 4\n\nNow, we multiply the results together to find the total number of different lineups:\n\n28 (guards) * 15 (forwards) * 4 (centers) = 1680 different lineups."
