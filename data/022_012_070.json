    "message_1": "Consider the meromorphic function f(z) = (z^3 - 1) / (z^2 + 2z + 1). Find the order of the pole and the residue of f at z = -1.",
    "message_2": "To find the order of the pole at z = -1, we first factor the denominator:\n\nz^2 + 2z + 1 = (z + 1)^2\n\nSince the denominator has a factor of (z + 1)^2, there is a pole of order 2 at z = -1.\n\nNow, we need to find the residue of f at z = -1. To do this, we use the formula for the residue of a function with a pole of order 2:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = lim (z -> -1) [(z + 1)^2 * f(z)]\n\nLet's first simplify f(z) by factoring the numerator:\n\nf(z) = (z^3 - 1) / (z^2 + 2z + 1) = [(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)] / (z + 1)^2\n\nNow, we can find the residue:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = lim (z -> -1) [(z + 1)^2 * [(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)] / (z + 1)^2]\n\nThe (z + 1)^2 terms cancel out:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = lim (z -> -1) [(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limit:\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = (-2)(1 + (-1) + 1) = -2(1)\n\nRes[f(z), z = -1] = -2\n\nSo, the order of the pole at z = -1 is 2, and the residue of f at z = -1 is -2."
