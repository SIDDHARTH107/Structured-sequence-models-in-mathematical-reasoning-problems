    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the two equal sides measure 25 cm each. If the base of the triangle is 16 cm, what is the length of the altitude drawn to the base?",
    "message_2": "Let's call the isosceles triangle ABC, with A being the vertex angle, and B and C being the base angles. Let's also call the midpoint of the base D. Since the triangle is isosceles, the altitude drawn to the base (AD) will also be the median and angle bisector. This means that BD = CD = 8 cm.\n\nNow we have a right triangle ABD, with AD being the altitude we want to find, AB = 25 cm, and BD = 8 cm. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for AD:\n\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\n\n25^2 = AD^2 + 8^2\n\n625 = AD^2 + 64\n\nAD^2 = 625 - 64\n\nAD^2 = 561\n\nAD = √561\n\nAD ≈ 23.7 cm\n\nSo, the length of the altitude drawn to the base is approximately 23.7 cm."
