    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not depend on the length of the original line segment. It is a fractal dimension that characterizes the self-similarity of the curve. To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, each line segment is divided into 4 segments of equal length, so N = 4. The scaling factor S is the ratio of the length of each new segment to the length of the original segment, which is 1/3.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThis dimension remains the same regardless of the number of iterations or the length of the original line segment."
