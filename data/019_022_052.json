    "message_1": "A student is considering two options for their math project: Option A which has a 70% chance of earning an A grade and a 30% chance of earning a B grade, and Option B which has a 60% chance of earning an A grade and a 40% chance of earning a B grade. Using expected value, which option should the student choose to maximize their chances of earning an A grade?",
    "message_2": "To determine which option the student should choose to maximize their chances of earning an A grade, we can compare the expected values of both options. Let's assign a value of 1 to an A grade and a value of 0 to a B grade. Then, we can calculate the expected value for each option as follows:\n\nExpected Value (Option A) = (Probability of A grade × Value of A grade) + (Probability of B grade × Value of B grade)\nExpected Value (Option A) = (0.70 × 1) + (0.30 × 0)\nExpected Value (Option A) = 0.70 + 0\nExpected Value (Option A) = 0.70\n\nExpected Value (Option B) = (Probability of A grade × Value of A grade) + (Probability of B grade × Value of B grade)\nExpected Value (Option B) = (0.60 × 1) + (0.40 × 0)\nExpected Value (Option B) = 0.60 + 0\nExpected Value (Option B) = 0.60\n\nComparing the expected values, Option A has a higher expected value (0.70) than Option B (0.60). Therefore, the student should choose Option A to maximize their chances of earning an A grade."
