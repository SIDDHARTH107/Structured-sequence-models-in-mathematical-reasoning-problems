    "message_2": "There are 51 groups of order 32, out of which 45 are non-abelian. However, I will discuss six of them, as requested.\n\nLet G be a group of order 32. Since 32 = 2^5, G is a p-group with p = 2. By the Sylow theorems, G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then P is an abelian group of order 32.\n\nThe six non-abelian groups of order 32 can be described using the following presentations:\n\n1. G1 = ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^9⟩\n2. G2 = ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^5⟩\n3. G3 = ⟨a, b | a^8 = b^4 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^5⟩\n4. G4 = ⟨a, b | a^8 = b^4 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^3⟩\n5. G5 = ⟨a, b | a^4 = b^8 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^3⟩\n6. G6 = ⟨a, b | a^4 = b^8 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^(-1)⟩\n\nNow, let's compare these groups with the cyclic group C32 and the dihedral group D16.\n\nCyclic group C32: It is an abelian group of order 32, generated by a single element a, with the presentation ⟨a | a^32 = 1⟩. All six non-abelian groups listed above are non-abelian, which makes them different from C32.\n\nDihedral group D16: It is a non-abelian group of order 32, generated by two elements a and b, with the presentation ⟨a, b | a^16 = b^2 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^(-1)⟩. We can see that G6 is isomorphic to D16, as their presentations are the same. The other five non-abelian groups are different from D16 because their presentations involve different relations between the generators a and b.\n\nIn summary, the six non-abelian groups of order 32 listed above are different from the cyclic group C32 because they are non-abelian. One of them, G6, is isomorphic to the dihedral group D16, while the other five are different from D16 due to their distinct relations between the generators a and b."
