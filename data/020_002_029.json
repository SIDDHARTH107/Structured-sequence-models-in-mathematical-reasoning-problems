    "message_1": "A company produces two products A and B. The profit earned for selling one unit of product A and B are $3 and $4 respectively. The company has a limited supply of raw material and can produce at most 200 units of product A and 300 units of product B. The production process also has a constraint, which states that the production rate of product A is at most twice the production rate of product B. How many units of A and B should the company produce to maximize its profit?\n\n(Hint: This is a nonlinear programming problem with two variables)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 3x + 4y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x ≤ 200 (limited supply of product A)\n2. y ≤ 300 (limited supply of product B)\n3. x ≤ 2y (production rate constraint)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x = 200 (vertical line)\n2. y = 300 (horizontal line)\n3. x = 2y (line with slope 2)\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (200, 100), (200, 300), and (0, 300). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 3(0) + 4(0) = $0\n2. P(200, 100) = 3(200) + 4(100) = $1000\n3. P(200, 300) = 3(200) + 4(300) = $2000 (not feasible because it violates the production rate constraint x ≤ 2y)\n4. P(0, 300) = 3(0) + 4(300) = $1200\n\nSince the profit function is linear, the maximum profit will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region. Comparing the profits at the feasible vertices, we find that the maximum profit of $1200 occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 300 units of product B."
