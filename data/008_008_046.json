To make one unit of product B, it requires 6 units of raw material X and 8 units of raw material Y. The company has 120 units of raw material X and 160 units of raw material Y. The profit from one unit of product A is $10 and that of product B is $15. The company wants to maximize its profit. Formulate this problem as a linear programming problem and solve it using matrix methods to find the optimal production levels of both products.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of units of product A produced as x and the number of units of product B produced as y. We are given the following information:\n\n1. To make one unit of product A, it requires 4 units of raw material X and 5 units of raw material Y.\n2. To make one unit of product B, it requires 6 units of raw material X and 8 units of raw material Y.\n3. The company has 120 units of raw material X and 160 units of raw material Y.\n4. The profit from one unit of product A is $10 and that of product B is $15.\n\nWe can formulate the linear programming problem as follows:\n\nObjective function (to maximize profit): P = 10x + 15y\n\nConstraints:\n4x + 6y ≤ 120 (raw material X constraint)\n5x + 8y ≤ 160 (raw material Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product A)\ny ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product B)\n\nNow, we will solve this linear programming problem using matrix methods. First, we will rewrite the constraints in matrix form:\n\n| 4  6 | | x | ≤ | 120 |\n| 5  8 | | y |   | 160 |\n\nNow, we will find the inverse of the matrix:\n\n| 4  6 |⁻¹ = 1/(-2) |  8 -6 | = | -4  3 |\n| 5  8 |            | -5  4 |   |  5 -4 |\n\nNow, we will multiply the inverse matrix by the constraint matrix:\n\n| -4  3 | | 120 | = | x |\n|  5 -4 | | 160 |   | y |\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nx = -4(120) + 3(160) = -480 + 480 = 0\ny = 5(120) - 4(160) = 600 - 640 = -40\n\nSince we have a non-negativity constraint, y cannot be negative. So, we set y = 0 and re-evaluate the constraints:\n\n4x + 6(0) ≤ 120\n5x + 8(0) ≤ 160\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx ≤ 30\n\nNow, we will plug x = 30 and y = 0 back into the objective function to find the maximum profit:\n\nP = 10(30) + 15(0) = 300\n\nTherefore, the optimal production levels are 30 units of product A and 0 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $300."
