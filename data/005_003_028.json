They've gathered the following data from recent sales:\n\nSquare footage (x): 1800, 2300, 1500, 2100, 2500\nSelling price (y): $250,000, $320,000, $200,000, $280,000, $350,000\n\nUsing linear regression analysis, what is the equation of the regression line that best fits this data? What is the predicted selling price for a house with 2000 square feet?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the regression line, we first need to calculate the mean of x and y values, the slope (m), and the y-intercept (b).\n\nMean of x values (x̄) = (1800 + 2300 + 1500 + 2100 + 2500) / 5 = 10200 / 5 = 2040\nMean of y values (ȳ) = ($250,000 + $320,000 + $200,000 + $280,000 + $350,000) / 5 = $1,400,000 / 5 = $280,000\n\nNow, we calculate the slope (m) using the formula:\n\nm = Σ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] / Σ[(x - x̄)^2]\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator:\n\n(1800 - 2040)($250,000 - $280,000) = -240(-$30,000) = $7,200,000\n(2300 - 2040)($320,000 - $280,000) = 260($40,000) = $10,400,000\n(1500 - 2040)($200,000 - $280,000) = -540(-$80,000) = $43,200,000\n(2100 - 2040)($280,000 - $280,000) = 60($0) = $0\n(2500 - 2040)($350,000 - $280,000) = 460($70,000) = $32,200,000\n\nSum of the numerator = $7,200,000 + $10,400,000 + $43,200,000 + $0 + $32,200,000 = $93,000,000\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator:\n\n(1800 - 2040)^2 = (-240)^2 = 57,600\n(2300 - 2040)^2 = 260^2 = 67,600\n(1500 - 2040)^2 = (-540)^2 = 291,600\n(2100 - 2040)^2 = 60^2 = 3,600\n(2500 - 2040)^2 = 460^2 = 211,600\n\nSum of the denominator = 57,600 + 67,600 + 291,600 + 3,600 + 211,600 = 632,000\n\nNow, we can calculate the slope (m):\n\nm = $93,000,000 / 632,000 ≈ 147.15\n\nNext, we calculate the y-intercept (b) using the formula:\n\nb = ȳ - m * x̄\n\nb = $280,000 - 147.15 * 2040 ≈ $280,000 - $299,946 ≈ -$19,946\n\nSo, the equation of the regression line is:\n\ny = 147.15x - $19,946\n\nNow, we can predict the selling price for a house with 2000 square feet:\n\ny = 147.15 * 2000 - $19,946 ≈ $294,300\n\nThe predicted selling price for a house with 2000 square feet is approximately $294,300."
