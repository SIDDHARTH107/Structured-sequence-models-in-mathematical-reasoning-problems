    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to form a committee of 4 from a group of 8 people using Pascal's Triangle, we need to find the binomial coefficient C(8, 4). Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The binomial coefficients can be found in Pascal's Triangle.\n\nHere's the beginning of Pascal's Triangle:\n\n```\n     1\n    1 1\n   1 2 1\n  1 3 3 1\n 1 4 6 4 1\n1 5 10 10 5 1\n```\n\nTo find C(8, 4), we need to go down to the 8th row (starting with the row number 0) and then find the 4th entry in that row (starting with the entry number 0).\n\n```\n1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n```\n\nThe 4th entry in the 8th row is 20. So, there are 20 ways to form a committee of 4 from a group of 8 people using Pascal's Triangle."
