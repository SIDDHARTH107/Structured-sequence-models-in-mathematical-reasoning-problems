    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake curve is formed by iterating the Koch curve construction process. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 4/3. \n\nStarting with a line segment of length 1, after four iterations, the length of the Koch snowflake curve can be calculated as follows:\n\nLength after 1st iteration: 1 * (4/3) = 4/3\nLength after 2nd iteration: (4/3) * (4/3) = 16/9\nLength after 3rd iteration: (16/9) * (4/3) = 64/27\nLength after 4th iteration: (64/27) * (4/3) = 256/81\n\nSo, the length of the Koch snowflake curve after four iterations, starting with a line segment of length 1, is 256/81."
