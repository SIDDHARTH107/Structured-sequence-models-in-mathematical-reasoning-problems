    "message_2": "To compute the number of points on the Jacobian variety of C over the finite field F_7, we first need to find the number of points on the curve C itself over F_7. We can do this by plugging in each element of F_7 into the equation y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 5 and checking if there is a corresponding y value in F_7.\n\nThe elements of F_7 are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Let's plug in each x value and check for y values:\n\nFor x = 0:\ny^2 = 0^3 + 3*0 + 5 = 5\nThere are no y values in F_7 that satisfy this equation.\n\nFor x = 1:\ny^2 = 1^3 + 3*1 + 5 = 9 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\ny = ±1 (mod 7)\nThere are 2 points: (1, 1) and (1, 6)\n\nFor x = 2:\ny^2 = 2^3 + 3*2 + 5 = 21 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\ny = 0 (mod 7)\nThere is 1 point: (2, 0)\n\nFor x = 3:\ny^2 = 3^3 + 3*3 + 5 = 41 ≡ 6 (mod 7)\nThere are no y values in F_7 that satisfy this equation.\n\nFor x = 4:\ny^2 = 4^3 + 3*4 + 5 = 77 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\ny = 0 (mod 7)\nThere is 1 point: (4, 0)\n\nFor x = 5:\ny^2 = 5^3 + 3*5 + 5 = 145 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\ny = ±1 (mod 7)\nThere are 2 points: (5, 1) and (5, 6)\n\nFor x = 6:\ny^2 = 6^3 + 3*6 + 5 = 233 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\ny = ±1 (mod 7)\nThere are 2 points: (6, 1) and (6, 6)\n\nSo, there are a total of 1 (the point at infinity) + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 9 points on the curve C over F_7.\n\nNow, we can compute the number of points on the Jacobian variety of C over F_7. The Jacobian variety of an algebraic curve is an abelian variety, and for a curve of genus g, the number of points on the Jacobian variety over a finite field F_q is given by q^g + 1 - a, where a is the trace of the Frobenius endomorphism.\n\nFor an elliptic curve (genus 1), the number of points on the Jacobian variety is equal to the number of points on the curve itself. Since our curve C is an elliptic curve, the number of points on the Jacobian variety of C over F_7 is equal to the number of points on C over F_7, which is 9."
