    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH IS COOL\" using the Playfair Cipher method with the key phrase \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid and fill it with the key phrase followed by the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is combined with I). Remove any duplicate letters from the key phrase.\n\nKey phrase: CRYPTOAGH\nRemaining letters: BDEFIKLMNQSUVWXZ\n\nThe grid will look like this:\n\nC R Y P T\nO A G H B\nD E F I K\nL M N S U\nV W X Z Q\n\n2. Split the plaintext message into pairs of letters. If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them. If the message has an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end.\n\nMATH IS COOL -> MA TH IS CO OL\n\n3. For each pair of letters, find their positions in the grid and apply the following rules:\n\n- If the letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their immediate right (wrap around if needed).\n- If the letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters immediately below them (wrap around if needed).\n- If the letters form a rectangle, replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other corners of the rectangle.\n\nMA -> OD\nTH -> YP\nIS -> CF\nCO -> RY\nOL -> UZ\n\n4. Combine the encrypted pairs to get the final encrypted message:\n\nEncrypted message: ODYPFCRYUZ"
