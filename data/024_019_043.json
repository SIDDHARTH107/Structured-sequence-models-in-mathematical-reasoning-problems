    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the total curvature of a surface to its topology. For a surface with a constant Gaussian curvature K and area A, the theorem states that the total curvature is given by:\n\nTotal Curvature = K * A\n\nIn this case, the Gaussian curvature K is given as 2, and the area A is given as 10 square meters. To calculate the total curvature, we simply multiply these values:\n\nTotal Curvature = 2 * 10 = 20\n\nSo, the total curvature of the surface is 20."
