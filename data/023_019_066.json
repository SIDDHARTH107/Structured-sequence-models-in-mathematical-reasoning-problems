    "message_2": "To analyze the stability of the system using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the general solution of the given differential equation. The given differential equation is a homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation for this differential equation is:\n\nr^2 + 16 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = Â±4i\n\nThe general solution of the differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = C1 * cos(4t) + C2 * sin(4t)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of C1 and C2 using the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 2 => C1 * cos(0) + C2 * sin(0) = 2 => C1 = 2\n\ny'(t) = -4C1 * sin(4t) + 4C2 * cos(4t)\n\ny'(0) = 3 => -4C1 * sin(0) + 4C2 * cos(0) = 3 => 4C2 = 3 => C2 = 3/4\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\ny(t) = 2 * cos(4t) + (3/4) * sin(4t)\n\nNow, let's analyze the stability of the system. A system is stable if its solutions are bounded for all time t. In this case, the solution consists of a linear combination of sine and cosine functions with constant coefficients. Both sine and cosine functions are bounded between -1 and 1, and their linear combination will also be bounded. Therefore, the system is stable."
