    "message_1": "A car is moving in a straight line and its position at time $t$ is given by $s(t) = 3t^2 + 2t - 1$ in meters. Using calculus, find the velocity and acceleration of the car at time $t = 2$ seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car, we need to find the first derivative of the position function $s(t)$ with respect to time $t$. This will give us the velocity function $v(t)$.\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(3t^2 + 2t - 1)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n$v(t) = 6t + 2$\n\nNow, we can find the velocity of the car at $t = 2$ seconds by plugging in $t = 2$ into the velocity function:\n\n$v(2) = 6(2) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14$\n\nSo, the velocity of the car at $t = 2$ seconds is $14$ meters per second.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the car. To do this, we find the second derivative of the position function $s(t)$ with respect to time $t$. This will give us the acceleration function $a(t)$.\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(3t^2 + 2t - 1)$\n\nWe already found the first derivative, which is the velocity function $v(t) = 6t + 2$. Now we need to find the derivative of $v(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(6t + 2)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\n$a(t) = 6$\n\nThe acceleration function is a constant, which means the acceleration of the car is always $6$ meters per second squared, regardless of the time $t$. Therefore, the acceleration of the car at $t = 2$ seconds is $6$ meters per second squared.\n\nIn summary, the velocity of the car at $t = 2$ seconds is $14$ meters per second, and the acceleration is $6$ meters per second squared."
