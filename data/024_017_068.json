    "message_1": "A student has to determine the parallel transport of a vector along a curve. Let the curve be the circle with radius r=2 centered at the origin in the xy plane, and let the vector be (2,2) with initial point at (0,0). Find the final point of the vector after parallel transport around the circle for a quarter of a revolution counterclockwise.",
    "message_2": "To find the final point of the vector after parallel transport around the circle for a quarter of a revolution counterclockwise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the initial point of the vector on the circle.\n2. Rotate the vector counterclockwise by 90 degrees (a quarter of a revolution).\n3. Add the rotated vector to the new point on the circle.\n\nStep 1: Determine the initial point of the vector on the circle\nThe circle has a radius of r = 2 and is centered at the origin (0,0). The initial point of the vector is at (0,0), so we need to find the point on the circle where the vector starts. Since the vector is (2,2), we can find the angle it makes with the positive x-axis:\n\ntan(θ) = 2/2 = 1\nθ = 45 degrees or π/4 radians\n\nThe initial point on the circle is at an angle of π/4 radians. Using the parametric equations for a circle, we can find the coordinates of this point:\n\nx = r * cos(θ) = 2 * cos(π/4) = 2 * (√2 / 2) = √2\ny = r * sin(θ) = 2 * sin(π/4) = 2 * (√2 / 2) = √2\n\nSo, the initial point on the circle is (√2, √2).\n\nStep 2: Rotate the vector counterclockwise by 90 degrees\nTo rotate a vector (x, y) counterclockwise by 90 degrees, we can use the following transformation:\n\nx' = -y\ny' = x\n\nApplying this transformation to the vector (2,2), we get:\n\nx' = -2\ny' = 2\n\nSo, the rotated vector is (-2, 2).\n\nStep 3: Add the rotated vector to the new point on the circle\nAfter a quarter of a revolution counterclockwise, the new point on the circle will be at an angle of π/4 + π/2 = 3π/4 radians. We can find the coordinates of this point using the parametric equations for a circle:\n\nx = r * cos(θ) = 2 * cos(3π/4) = 2 * (-√2 / 2) = -√2\ny = r * sin(θ) = 2 * sin(3π/4) = 2 * (√2 / 2) = √2\n\nSo, the new point on the circle is (-√2, √2). Now, we add the rotated vector (-2, 2) to this point:\n\nx_final = -√2 + (-2) = -√2 - 2\ny_final = √2 + 2 = √2 + 2\n\nThus, the final point of the vector after parallel transport around the circle for a quarter of a revolution counterclockwise is (-√2 - 2, √2 + 2)."
