    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a 90-degree angle. The total length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal length = (Initial segment length) * (2^n)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor this problem, the initial segment length is 1, and we want to find the total length after six iterations (n = 6).\n\nTotal length = 1 * (2^6) = 1 * 64 = 64\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve after six iterations is 64."
