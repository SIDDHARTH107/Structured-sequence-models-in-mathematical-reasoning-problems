Given the universe of discourse U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, determine:\n\nWhat is the truth value of the statement: \"There exists an element x in U such that P(x) and Q(x) are both true\"?",
    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of the statement, we need to find if there is an element x in U for which both P(x) and Q(x) are true.\n\nLet's check each element in U:\n\n1. P(1) is false (1 is not a multiple of 3) and Q(1) is true (1 is an odd number).\n2. P(2) is false and Q(2) is false.\n3. P(3) is true (3 is a multiple of 3) and Q(3) is true (3 is an odd number).\n4. P(4) is false and Q(4) is false.\n5. P(5) is false and Q(5) is true.\n6. P(6) is true and Q(6) is false.\n7. P(7) is false and Q(7) is true.\n8. P(8) is false and Q(8) is false.\n9. P(9) is true and Q(9) is true.\n10. P(10) is false and Q(10) is false.\n\nWe can see that for x = 3 and x = 9, both P(x) and Q(x) are true. Therefore, the truth value of the statement \"There exists an element x in U such that P(x) and Q(x) are both true\" is True."
