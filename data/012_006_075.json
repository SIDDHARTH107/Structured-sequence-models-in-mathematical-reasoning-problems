    "message_2": "1. To determine if the graph has an Eulerian path, we need to check the degrees of each vertex. A graph has an Eulerian path if it has exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree.\n\nDegree of A: 3 (connected to B, C, D)\nDegree of B: 3 (connected to A, C, E)\nDegree of C: 4 (connected to A, B, D, E)\nDegree of D: 3 (connected to A, C, E)\nDegree of E: 3 (connected to B, C, D)\n\nWe have 4 vertices with odd degrees (A, B, D, E), so the graph does not have an Eulerian path.\n\n2. To determine if the graph has a Hamiltonian path, we need to find a path that visits each vertex exactly once. Note that the edge weights do not matter for this problem.\n\nOne possible Hamiltonian path is A-C-B-E-D. This path visits each vertex exactly once.\n\nSo, the graph does have a Hamiltonian path, and one such path is A-C-B-E-D."
