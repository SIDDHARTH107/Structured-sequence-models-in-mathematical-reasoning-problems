    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations using matrix multiplication, we can represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  3 | 7 |\n| 4 -5 | 1 |\n| 1  1 | 3 |\n\nFirst, we need to convert this matrix to its reduced row echelon form (RREF). We can do this using the following row operations:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 3:\n| 1  1 | 3 |\n| 4 -5 | 1 |\n| 2  3 | 7 |\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-4 * Row 1) + Row 2:\n| 1  1 |  3 |\n| 0 -9 | -11|\n| 2  3 |  7 |\n\n3. Replace Row 3 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n| 1  1 |  3 |\n| 0 -9 | -11|\n| 0  1 |  1 |\n\n4. Replace Row 2 with (-1/9 * Row 2):\n| 1  1 |  3 |\n| 0  1 | 11/9|\n| 0  1 |  1 |\n\n5. Replace Row 1 with (-1 * Row 3) + Row 1:\n| 1  0 |  2 |\n| 0  1 | 11/9|\n| 0  1 |  1 |\n\n6. Replace Row 3 with (-1 * Row 2) + Row 3:\n| 1  0 |  2 |\n| 0  1 | 11/9|\n| 0  0 | -2/9|\n\nSince the last row represents the equation 0x + 0y = -2/9, which is a contradiction (0 â‰  -2/9), there is no solution for this system of equations."
