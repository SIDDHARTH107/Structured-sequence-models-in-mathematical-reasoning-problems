    "message_2": "A Menger Sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from the original cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face, as well as the central cube of the whole structure, is removed. This leaves 20 smaller cubes.\n\nAfter the first iteration, there are 20 smaller cubes, each with a side length of 1/3. So, the volume of the Menger Sponge after the first iteration is 20 * (1/3)^3.\n\nAfter the second iteration, each of the 20 smaller cubes undergoes the same process. This means there are 20 * 20 = 400 even smaller cubes, each with a side length of (1/3)^2 * (1/3) = (1/3)^3. So, the volume of the Menger Sponge after the second iteration is 400 * (1/3)^3.\n\nAfter the third iteration, each of the 400 smaller cubes undergoes the same process. This means there are 20 * 400 = 8000 even smaller cubes, each with a side length of (1/3)^3 * (1/3) = (1/3)^4. So, the volume of the Menger Sponge after the third iteration is 8000 * (1/3)^4.\n\nCalculating the volume:\n\n8000 * (1/3)^4 = 8000 * (1/81) = 8000/81 â‰ˆ 98.7654\n\nSo, the volume of the Menger Sponge after three iterations is approximately 98.7654 cubic units."
