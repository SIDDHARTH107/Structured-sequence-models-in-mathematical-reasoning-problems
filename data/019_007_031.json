    "message_1": "Suppose there are five boxes labeled A, B, C, D, and E. You know that Box A contains 3 apples, Box C contains 7 apples, and Box E contains 8 apples. You do not know how many apples Boxes B and D contain. You make the assumption that Boxes B and D each contain at least 5 apples. However, you then find out that Box B actually contains only 2 apples. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\na) Box D must contain at least 5 apples.\nb) Box D can contain any number of apples.\nc) Box D must contain fewer than 5 apples. \n\nWhat is the correct answer according to non-monotonic logic?",
    "message_2": "The correct answer according to non-monotonic logic is:\n\na) Box D must contain at least 5 apples.\n\nNon-monotonic logic allows for the revision of conclusions when new information is added. Initially, you assumed that both Box B and Box D contain at least 5 apples. However, when you find out that Box B actually contains only 2 apples, this new information does not affect the assumption made about Box D. Therefore, the statement that Box D must contain at least 5 apples still holds true."
