    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on the top of a building. If the angle of elevation of the top of the flagpole from a point on the ground is 60 degrees and the distance between the building and the point is 25 meters, find the height of the flagpole.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the building as B, the height of the flagpole as F, and the distance between the building and the point on the ground as D. We are given that the angle of elevation of the top of the flagpole is 60 degrees and D = 25 meters.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation to the height of the flagpole and the distance from the building. The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle. In this case, the opposite side is the total height (B + F), and the adjacent side is the distance D.\n\ntan(60°) = (B + F) / D\n\nWe know that tan(60°) = √3 and D = 25 meters. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n√3 = (B + F) / 25\n\nNow, we need to find the height of the flagpole (F). To do this, we need to know the height of the building (B). Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine the height of the building. If we had the angle of elevation to the top of the building or the height of the building itself, we could solve for F."
