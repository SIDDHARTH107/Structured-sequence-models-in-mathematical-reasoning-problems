    "message_2": "To find out how many students don't like pizza or burgers, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal students liking pizza or burgers = Students liking pizza + Students liking burgers - Students liking both pizza and burgers\n\nTotal students liking pizza or burgers = 25 (pizza) + 18 (burgers) - 10 (both)\n\nTotal students liking pizza or burgers = 33\n\nNow, to find the number of students who don't like pizza or burgers, we subtract the total students liking pizza or burgers from the total number of students:\n\nTotal students not liking pizza or burgers = Total students - Total students liking pizza or burgers\n\nTotal students not liking pizza or burgers = 50 - 33\n\nTotal students not liking pizza or burgers = 17\n\nSo, 17 students in the group don't like pizza or burgers."
