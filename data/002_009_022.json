    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of a cylinder, we need to find the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nThe area of one circular base is:\nA = π(4 cm)² = 16π cm²\n\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:\n2 × 16π cm² = 32π cm²\n\nThe lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nThe lateral surface area is:\nA = 2π(4 cm)(10 cm) = 80π cm²\n\nNow, we add the areas of the bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area of the cylinder:\nTotal Surface Area = 32π cm² + 80π cm² = 112π cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cylinder is 112π cm²."
