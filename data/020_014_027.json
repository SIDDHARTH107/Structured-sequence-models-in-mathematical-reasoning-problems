    "message_2": "To find the global minimum value of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 5 on the interval [-2, 2], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the first derivative is equal to zero or is undefined. \n\nFirst, find the first derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^4 - 4x^2 + 5)\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 8x\n\nNow, set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n4x^3 - 8x = 0\nx(4x^2 - 8) = 0\n\nThis gives us three critical points:\n\nx = 0\n4x^2 - 8 = 0\nx^2 = 2\nx = ±√2\n\nNow we need to check the value of the function at these critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^4 - 4(-2)^2 + 5 = 16 - 16 + 5 = 5\nf(-√2) = (√2)^4 - 4(√2)^2 + 5 = 4 - 8 + 5 = 1\nf(0) = 0^4 - 4(0)^2 + 5 = 5\nf(√2) = (√2)^4 - 4(√2)^2 + 5 = 4 - 8 + 5 = 1\nf(2) = (2)^4 - 4(2)^2 + 5 = 16 - 16 + 5 = 5\n\nThe global minimum value of the function on the interval [-2, 2] occurs at x = -√2 and x = √2, and the minimum value is f(-√2) = f(√2) = 1."
