    "message_2": "Let's start by applying the power iteration method for the given matrix A and initial guess vector [1, 1]^T.\n\nMatrix A:\n[7, 5]\n[5, 9]\n\nInitial guess vector (x0):\n[1]\n[1]\n\nNow, we will perform 5 iterations of the power iteration method:\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = A * x0 = [7*1 + 5*1, 5*1 + 9*1]^T = [12, 14]^T\nNormalize x1: x1 = x1 / ||x1|| = [12/18.439, 14/18.439]^T = [0.651, 0.759]^T\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = A * x1 = [7*0.651 + 5*0.759, 5*0.651 + 9*0.759]^T = [8.408, 10.033]^T\nNormalize x2: x2 = x2 / ||x2|| = [8.408/13.152, 10.033/13.152]^T = [0.639, 0.762]^T\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = A * x2 = [7*0.639 + 5*0.762, 5*0.639 + 9*0.762]^T = [8.253, 10.078]^T\nNormalize x3: x3 = x3 / ||x3|| = [8.253/13.038, 10.078/13.038]^T = [0.633, 0.773]^T\n\nIteration 4:\nx4 = A * x3 = [7*0.633 + 5*0.773, 5*0.633 + 9*0.773]^T = [8.196, 10.097]^T\nNormalize x4: x4 = x4 / ||x4|| = [8.196/12.994, 10.097/12.994]^T = [0.630, 0.777]^T\n\nIteration 5:\nx5 = A * x4 = [7*0.630 + 5*0.777, 5*0.630 + 9*0.777]^T = [8.169, 10.107]^T\nNormalize x5: x5 = x5 / ||x5|| = [8.169/12.976, 10.107/12.976]^T = [0.629, 0.778]^T\n\nAfter 5 iterations, the estimated eigenvector is [0.629, 0.778]^T.\n\nNow, let's find the estimated eigenvalue using the Rayleigh quotient:\nλ_estimated = (x5^T * A * x5) / (x5^T * x5)\n\nλ_estimated = ([0.629, 0.778] * [7, 5; 5, 9] * [0.629, 0.778]^T) / ([0.629, 0.778] * [0.629, 0.778]^T)\nλ_estimated ≈ 12.253\n\nNow, we need to find the actual eigenvalue to compute the error. We can do this by finding the eigenvalues of matrix A:\n\nThe characteristic equation of A is given by:\n|A - λI| = 0\n|(7-λ)(9-λ) - 5*5| = 0\nλ^2 - 16λ + 64 - 25 = 0\nλ^2 - 16λ + 39 = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation, we get the eigenvalues:\nλ1 ≈ 12.246, λ2 ≈ 3.754\n\nThe largest eigenvalue is λ1 ≈ 12.246.\n\nNow, we can compute the error between the actual eigenvalue and the estimated eigenvalue:\nError = |λ_actual - λ_estimated| = |12.246 - 12.253| ≈ 0.007\n\nSo, after 5 iterations, the largest eigenvalue is approximately 12.253, the corresponding eigenvector is [0.629, 0.778]^T, and the error between the actual and estimated eigenvalue is approximately 0.007."
