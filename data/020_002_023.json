    "message_1": "A manufacturing company makes two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company has 6 units of labor available per day and 12 units of raw materials available per day. Product A requires 2 units of labor and 3 units of material to produce, and it sells for $10 per unit. Product B requires 4 units of labor and 2 units of material to produce, and it sells for $15 per unit. The company wants to maximize its daily profit. How many units of each product should the company produce per day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and raw materials can be represented as:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 6 (labor constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 12 (raw material constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the daily profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 6 can be rewritten as y ≤ (6 - 2x) / 4 or y ≤ (3 - x) / 2\n3x + 2y ≤ 12 can be rewritten as y ≤ (12 - 3x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. The corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 3), and (4, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each corner point:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\nP(0, 3) = 10(0) + 15(3) = $45\nP(4, 0) = 10(4) + 15(0) = $40\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (0, 3), which means the company should produce 0 units of Product A and 3 units of Product B per day to maximize its daily profit of $45."
