    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the given function f(z) = (z-1)/(z^2+z-2) at the singular points, we first need to find the singular points of the function. The singular points are the points where the denominator is zero.\n\nThe denominator is z^2 + z - 2. We can factor this as (z+2)(z-1). So, the singular points are z = 1 and z = -2.\n\nNow, we need to find the partial fraction decomposition of the function:\n\nf(z) = (z-1)/((z+2)(z-1)) = A/(z+2) + B/(z-1)\n\nTo find A and B, we can clear the denominators:\n\n(z-1) = A(z-1) + B(z+2)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in the singular points:\n\nFor z = 1:\n0 = A(0) + B(3) => B = 0\n\nFor z = -2:\n-3 = A(-3) => A = 1\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\nf(z) = 1/(z+2)\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion for each singular point:\n\n1. Singular point z = 1:\n\nWe want to express f(z) in terms of (z-1). Let w = z-1, then z = w+1. So,\n\nf(z) = 1/((w+1)+2) = 1/(w+3)\n\nThe Laurent series expansion for f(z) at z=1 is just the Taylor series expansion for 1/(w+3) at w=0:\n\nf(z) = 1/(w+3) = -1/3 * (1 - w/3 + (w/3)^2 - (w/3)^3 + ...)\n\n2. Singular point z = -2:\n\nWe want to express f(z) in terms of (z+2). Let w = z+2, then z = w-2. So,\n\nf(z) = 1/(w-2+2) = 1/w\n\nThe Laurent series expansion for f(z) at z=-2 is just the geometric series expansion for 1/w:\n\nf(z) = 1/w = 1/(z+2) = 1/(z+2)\n\nSo, the Laurent series expansions of f(z) at the singular points are:\n\nAt z = 1: f(z) = -1/3 * (1 - (z-1)/3 + ((z-1)/3)^2 - ((z-1)/3)^3 + ...)\n\nAt z = -2: f(z) = 1/(z+2)"
