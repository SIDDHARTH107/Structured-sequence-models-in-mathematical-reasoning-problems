    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and period of the function f(x) = 3sin(4x) - 1, we need to identify the coefficients in the standard form of a sinusoidal function, which is A*sin(Bx - C) + D, where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn our function, f(x) = 3sin(4x) - 1, we have:\n\nA = 3 (amplitude)\nB = 4\nC = 0 (no phase shift)\nD = -1 (vertical shift)\n\nThe amplitude is the absolute value of A, which is |3| = 3.\n\nThe period is found by the formula Period = (2π) / |B|. In our case, B = 4, so the period is (2π) / 4 = π/2.\n\nNow, let's graph two periods of the function on the interval [0, 2π].\n\n1. First, we plot the midline, which is y = D = -1. This is a horizontal line at y = -1.\n2. The amplitude is 3, so the maximum and minimum values of the function are -1 + 3 = 2 and -1 - 3 = -4, respectively.\n3. The period is π/2, so we'll have two full periods between 0 and 2π. The first period will be between 0 and π, and the second period will be between π and 2π.\n4. For the sine function, we start at the midline, go up to the maximum, back to the midline, down to the minimum, and back to the midline to complete one period.\n5. Repeat the process for the second period.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the graph:\n\n```\n3 |          .-.               .-.\n  |        /     \\           /     \\\n2 |- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n  |      /         \\       /         \\\n1 |    /             \\   /             \\\n  |  /                 '                 \\\n0 |- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n  |0          π/2         π        3π/2       2π\n```\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 3sin(4x) - 1 is 3, and the period is π/2."
