    "message_1": "Consider the following optimization problem: \n\nMinimize the Rosenbrock function given by:\n\nf(x,y) = 100(y - x^2)^2 + (1 - x)^2\n\nusing the differential evolution algorithm. The search space is defined to be -5 <= x <= 10 and -5 <= y <= 10. Use a population size of 50 and a maximum of 200 generations. Find the minimum value of the function and the values of x and y that minimize it.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the differential evolution algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of 50 random solutions within the search space.\n2. For each generation, perform the following steps:\n   a. For each individual in the population, select three other distinct individuals randomly.\n   b. Perform mutation and crossover to create a trial vector.\n   c. Compare the trial vector with the original individual and replace it if the trial vector has a lower function value.\n3. Repeat steps 2a-2c for 200 generations.\n4. Select the individual with the lowest function value as the optimal solution.\n\nHere's a Python implementation using the `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import differential_evolution\n\ndef rosenbrock(x):\n    return 100 * (x[1] - x[0]**2)**2 + (1 - x[0])**2\n\nbounds = [(-5, 10), (-5, 10)]\n\nresult = differential_evolution(rosenbrock, bounds, popsize=50, maxiter=200)\n\nprint(\"Minimum value of the function: \", result.fun)\nprint(\"Values of x and y that minimize the function: \", result.x)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the minimum value of the Rosenbrock function and the corresponding values of x and y. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the differential evolution algorithm. The global minimum of the Rosenbrock function is f(x, y) = 0 at the point (x, y) = (1, 1)."
