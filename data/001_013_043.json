    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root.\n(√(3x + 7))^2 = 10^2\n\n2. Simplify the equation.\n3x + 7 = 100\n\n3. Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation.\n3x = 93\n\n4. Divide both sides by 3.\nx = 31\n\nSo, the solution is x = 31."
