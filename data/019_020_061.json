    "message_2": "The time complexity of an algorithm that checks whether a given number N is prime or not depends on the specific algorithm used. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Trial division: In this method, you check if N is divisible by any integer from 2 to √N. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(√N).\n\n2. Sieve of Eratosthenes: This algorithm is used to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. If you want to check if a single number N is prime, you can use this algorithm with a limit of N. The time complexity is O(N log(log N)).\n\n3. AKS primality test: This is a deterministic primality test with a time complexity of O(log(N)^7.5) (using the best-known improvements).\n\nThere are other primality testing algorithms with different time complexities, but these are some of the most common ones."
