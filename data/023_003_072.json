    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using Fourier series, we first assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we substitute this assumed solution into the given partial differential equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = k(∂^2u/∂x^2) => X(x)∂T(t)/∂t = kT(t)∂^2X(x)/∂x^2\n\nNext, we separate the variables by dividing both sides by kXT:\n\n(1/kT)∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X)∂^2X(x)/∂x^2\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ^2:\n\n(1/kT)∂T(t)/∂t = -λ^2 = (1/X)∂^2X(x)/∂x^2\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. (1/T)∂T(t)/∂t = -kλ^2 => ∂T(t)/∂t = -kλ^2T(t)\n2. (1/X)∂^2X(x)/∂x^2 = -λ^2 => ∂^2X(x)/∂x^2 = -λ^2X(x)\n\nWe solve the second equation first. The general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A*sin(λx) + B*cos(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0:\n\nX(0) = A*sin(0) + B*cos(0) = B = 0 (since u(0,t) = 0)\nX(L) = A*sin(λL) = 0 (since u(L,t) = 0)\n\nSince L = 1, we have:\n\nA*sin(λ) = 0\n\nThis implies that λ = nπ for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, we solve the first equation:\n\n∂T(t)/∂t = -kλ^2T(t)\n\nThe general solution for T(t) is:\n\nT(t) = C*exp(-kλ^2t)\n\nNow, we have the solution for u(x,t):\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t) = (A*sin(λx))(C*exp(-kλ^2t))\n\nSince λ = nπ, we can rewrite the solution as:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [An*sin(nπx)*exp(-k(nπ)^2t)]\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition u(x,0) = f(x):\n\nf(x) = 2sin(πx) - 3sin(3πx) = Σ [An*sin(nπx)]\n\nComparing the coefficients, we get:\n\nA1 = 2, A3 = -3, and An = 0 for n ≠ 1, 3\n\nSo, the final solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = 2*sin(πx)*exp(-k(π)^2t) - 3*sin(3πx)*exp(-k(3π)^2t)\n\nSince k = 1, the solution for 0 <= t <= π/4 is:\n\nu(x,t) = 2*sin(πx)*exp(-π^2t) - 3*sin(3πx)*exp(-9π^2t)"
