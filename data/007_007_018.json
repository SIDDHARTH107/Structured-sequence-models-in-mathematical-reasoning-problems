    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 2x + 3y = 13, we need to find integer values for x and y that satisfy the equation.\n\nFirst, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\ny = (13 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we can try different integer values for x and see if we get an integer value for y.\n\n1. If x = 0, y = (13 - 2*0) / 3 = 13 / 3, which is not an integer.\n2. If x = 1, y = (13 - 2*1) / 3 = 11 / 3, which is not an integer.\n3. If x = 2, y = (13 - 2*2) / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3, which is an integer.\n\nSo, one solution is x = 2 and y = 3.\n\nWe can also find other solutions by adding or subtracting multiples of the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3, which is 6. This is because adding or subtracting multiples of 6 to 13 will not change the fact that the equation is satisfied.\n\nFor example, if we subtract 6 from 13, we get 7. Then, we can try different integer values for x and see if we get an integer value for y.\n\n1. If x = -1, y = (7 - 2*(-1)) / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3, which is an integer.\n\nSo, another solution is x = -1 and y = 3.\n\nWe can continue this process to find more solutions, but these are two examples of integer values for x and y that satisfy the Diophantine equation 2x + 3y = 13."
