She then chose her secret value a = 4. Bob chose his secret value b = 3. Find the shared secret key that Alice and Bob will use for communication.",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes her public value A: A = g^a mod p\n   A = 2^4 mod 11\n   A = 16 mod 11\n   A = 5\n\n2. Bob computes his public value B: B = g^b mod p\n   B = 2^3 mod 11\n   B = 8 mod 11\n   B = 8\n\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key: s = B^a mod p\n   s = 8^4 mod 11\n   s = 4096 mod 11\n   s = 1\n\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key: s = A^b mod p\n   s = 5^3 mod 11\n   s = 125 mod 11\n   s = 1\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have computed the same shared secret key, s = 1. They will use this key for secure communication."
