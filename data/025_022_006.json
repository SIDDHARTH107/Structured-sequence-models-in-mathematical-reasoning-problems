    "message_2": "To compute the intersection number D1.D2, we need to find the number of points on X where both D1 and D2 intersect. \n\nD1 is defined by the equation Y = 0. Substituting Y = 0 into the equation of the cubic curve X, we get:\n\n0^2Z - X^3 - AZ^3 = 0\n-X^3 - AZ^3 = 0\n\nNow, let's factor out the common term Z^3:\n\nZ^3(-X^3/A - A) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied when either Z^3 = 0 or -X^3/A - A = 0.\n\nFor Z^3 = 0, we have Z = 0, which is the equation for D2. So, this case does not give us any new intersection points.\n\nFor -X^3/A - A = 0, we have X^3 = -A^2. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:\n\nX = (-A^2)^(1/3)\n\nSince X is a cubic root, it has three distinct roots. Therefore, there are three points on X where D1 intersects.\n\nNow, let's consider D2, which is defined by the equation Z = 0. Substituting Z = 0 into the equation of the cubic curve X, we get:\n\nY^2(0) - X^3 - A(0)^3 = 0\n-X^3 = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied when X^3 = 0, which implies X = 0.\n\nSubstituting X = 0 back into the equation of D1 (Y = 0), we see that this point also lies on D1. Thus, there is one intersection point between D1 and D2.\n\nSo, the intersection number D1.D2 on X is equal to the number of intersection points between D1 and D2, which is 1."
