    "message_1": "A student has a knapsack that can hold a total weight of 15 kg. The student wants to pack the knapsack with items of different weights, such that the total value of the items packed is maximized. The following table shows the available items along with their weights and values:\n\nItem| Weight (kg)|Value ($)\n---|---|---\n1| 3| 100   \n2| 5| 150\n3| 2| 70\n4| 8| 200\n5| 4| 120\n\nWhat is the maximum value that the student can pack in the knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value that the student can pack in the knapsack, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will create a table to store the maximum value that can be obtained with a certain weight capacity and a certain number of items.\n\nLet's create a table with rows representing the items (0 to 5) and columns representing the weight capacity (0 to 15). The cell at the ith row and jth column will represent the maximum value that can be obtained using the first i items and a knapsack of capacity j.\n\nWe will fill the table row by row, starting with the first item. For each cell, we will compare the value of including the current item and the value of not including the current item, and choose the maximum of the two.\n\nHere's the filled table:\n\n```\n  | 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n--+----------------------------------------------\n0 | 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n1 | 0  0  0 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100\n2 | 0  0  0 100 100 150 150 150 250 250 250 250 250 250 250 250\n3 | 0  0 70 100 170 170 220 220 250 250 320 320 320 320 320 320\n4 | 0  0 70 100 170 200 220 270 270 350 350 420 420 470 470 470\n5 | 0  0 70 100 170 200 240 270 300 350 370 420 450 470 500 520\n```\n\nThe maximum value that the student can pack in the knapsack is 520, which can be achieved by packing items 2, 3, and 5 (weights 5, 2, and 4 kg, respectively, for a total weight of 11 kg)."
