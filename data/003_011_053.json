    "message_1": "A bird is sitting on a tree branch 30 feet above the ground. It spots a worm on the ground that is 50 feet away from the base of the tree. What is the exact distance the bird would need to fly to reach the worm if it flies in a straight line? Use trigonometry to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. We have a right triangle with the bird's height above the ground (30 feet) as one leg, the horizontal distance from the tree to the worm (50 feet) as the other leg, and the distance the bird needs to fly as the hypotenuse.\n\nLet's denote the bird's height as a, the horizontal distance as b, and the distance the bird needs to fly as c. According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nWe are given a = 30 feet and b = 50 feet. Plugging these values into the equation:\n\n(30)^2 + (50)^2 = c^2\n900 + 2500 = c^2\n3400 = c^2\n\nNow, to find the value of c, we take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = √3400\nc ≈ 58.31 feet\n\nSo, the bird would need to fly approximately 58.31 feet in a straight line to reach the worm."
