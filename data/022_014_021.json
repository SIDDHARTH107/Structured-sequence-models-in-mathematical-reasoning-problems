    "message_2": "Since f(z) is analytic, it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y and ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nGiven u(x,y) = x^2 - y^2, we can compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂u/∂x = 2x and ∂u/∂y = -2y\n\nNow we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to find the partial derivatives of v(x,y):\n\n∂v/∂y = 2x and -∂v/∂x = -2y\n\nFrom the second equation, we can find ∂v/∂x:\n\n∂v/∂x = 2y\n\nNow we can integrate the partial derivatives to find v(x,y):\n\nv(x,y) = ∫(2x) dy = 2xy + g(x)\n\nwhere g(x) is an arbitrary function of x. Now we can differentiate v(x,y) with respect to x:\n\n∂v/∂x = 2y + g'(x)\n\nSince we already know that ∂v/∂x = 2y, we can conclude that g'(x) = 0, which means g(x) is a constant. Therefore, v(x,y) = 2xy + C, where C is a constant.\n\nSo, the function v(x,y) is:\n\nv(x,y) = 2xy + C"
