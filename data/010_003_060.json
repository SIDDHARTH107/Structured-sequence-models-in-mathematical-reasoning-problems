    "message_2": "Since X is a topological space satisfying the T2 separation axiom (also known as the Hausdorff condition), for any two distinct points x and y in X, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V.\n\nNow, let's consider the complements of these sets, denoted by U' and V', where U' = X - U and V' = X - V.\n\nSince x ∈ U and U ∩ V = ∅, it follows that x ∉ V. Therefore, x ∈ V', as V' contains all points in X that are not in V.\n\nSimilarly, since y ∈ V and U ∩ V = ∅, it follows that y ∉ U. Therefore, y ∈ U', as U' contains all points in X that are not in U.\n\nThus, we have found two disjoint open sets U and V in X such that x ∈ U, y ∈ V, x ∈ V', and y ∈ U'."
