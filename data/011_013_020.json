    "message_1": "In a group of 10 friends, how many ways can they arrange themselves to form a line for a group photo if three of them (A, B, and C) insist on standing together?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can treat the group of three friends (A, B, and C) who insist on standing together as a single unit. This leaves us with 8 individuals (7 other friends + the group of A, B, and C).\n\nThere are 8! (8 factorial) ways to arrange these 8 units in a line.\n\nNow, within the group of A, B, and C, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange themselves.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to arrange the 10 friends in a line with A, B, and C standing together is:\n\n8! × 3! = 40,320 × 6 = 241,920 ways."
