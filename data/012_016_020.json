    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of G, we first need to find the number of spanning trees, forests, and connected components in G. Let's denote the Tutte polynomial as T_G(x, y).\n\n1. Spanning trees: There are 3 spanning trees in G.\n2. Forests: There are 5 forests in G.\n3. Connected components: There is 1 connected component in G.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the Tutte polynomial:\n\nT_G(x, y) = x^(k-c) * (y-1)^(c-1) * (x-1)^(n-k)\n\nwhere k is the number of edges, c is the number of connected components, and n is the number of vertices.\n\nIn our case, k = 6, c = 1, and n = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nT_G(x, y) = x^(6-1) * (y-1)^(1-1) * (x-1)^(5-6)\nT_G(x, y) = x^5 * (x-1)^(-1)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the polynomial at the given points:\n\n1. T(1,1) = (1)^5 * (1-1)^(-1) = 1 * undefined (division by zero)\n   The Tutte polynomial is undefined at (1,1).\n\n2. T(2,1) = (2)^5 * (2-1)^(-1) = 32 * 1 = 32\n\n3. T(1,2) = (1)^5 * (1-1)^(-1) = 1 * undefined (division by zero)\n   The Tutte polynomial is undefined at (1,2).\n\n4. T(2,2) = (2)^5 * (2-1)^(-1) = 32 * 1 = 32\n\nSo, the values of the Tutte polynomial at the given points are:\n\nT(1,1) = undefined\nT(2,1) = 32\nT(1,2) = undefined\nT(2,2) = 32"
