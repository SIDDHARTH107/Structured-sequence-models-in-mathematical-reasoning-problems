    "message_2": "To find the complex logarithm of the complex number $z = 2 + 3i$, we first need to express $z$ in polar form. The polar form of a complex number is given by $z = re^{i\\theta}$, where $r$ is the magnitude of $z$ and $\\theta$ is the argument of $z$.\n\nThe magnitude of $z$ is given by $r = \\sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{13}$. The argument of $z$ can be found using the arctangent function: $\\theta = \\arctan(\\frac{3}{2})$. Therefore, the polar form of $z$ is $z = \\sqrt{13}e^{i\\arctan(\\frac{3}{2})}$.\n\nNow, we want to find a complex number $w = a + bi$ such that $e^w = z$. Using Euler's formula, we have $e^w = e^{a + bi} = e^a(\\cos(b) + i\\sin(b))$. We want this to be equal to $z = \\sqrt{13}e^{i\\arctan(\\frac{3}{2})}$.\n\nComparing the magnitudes, we have $e^a = \\sqrt{13}$, so $a = \\ln(\\sqrt{13}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(13)$. Comparing the arguments, we have $b = \\arctan(\\frac{3}{2}) + 2\\pi k$ for some integer $k$, since the argument is periodic with period $2\\pi$.\n\nTherefore, the complex logarithm of $z$ is given by $w = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(13) + i(\\arctan(\\frac{3}{2}) + 2\\pi k)$, where $k$ is an integer."
