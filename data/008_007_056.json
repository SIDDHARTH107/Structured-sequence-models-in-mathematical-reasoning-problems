Find the eigenvalues:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI:\n[[5 - λ, -2],\n [6, -3 - λ]]\n\nThe determinant of (A - λI) is:\n(5 - λ)((-3) - λ) - (-2)(6) = λ^2 - 2λ - 3\n\nSet the determinant equal to 0 and solve for λ:\nλ^2 - 2λ - 3 = 0\n(λ - 3)(λ + 1) = 0\n\nEigenvalues (λ):\nλ1 = 3\nλ2 = -1\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors:\nFor each eigenvalue, we need to find the eigenvectors by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFor λ1 = 3:\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n[[2, -2],\n [6, -6]]v1 = 0\n\nRow reduce to echelon form:\n[[1, -1],\n [0,  0]]\n\nThe eigenvector v1 can be found as:\nv1 = t[1, 1], where t is any scalar.\n\nFor λ2 = -1:\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n[[6, -2],\n [6, -2]]v2 = 0\n\nRow reduce to echelon form:\n[[1, -1/3],\n [0,  0]]\n\nThe eigenvector v2 can be found as:\nv2 = t[1, 3], where t is any scalar.\n\n3. Form the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P:\nThe diagonal matrix D consists of the eigenvalues on the diagonal:\nD = [[3, 0],\n       [0, -1]]\n\nThe invertible matrix P consists of the eigenvectors as columns:\nP = [[1, 1],\n       [1, 3]]\n\n4. Verify that A = PDP^(-1):\nTo verify, we need to compute the inverse of P, P^(-1), and then check if A = PDP^(-1).\n\nP^(-1) can be computed as follows:\nP = [[1, 1],\n       [1, 3]]\n\nDeterminant of P = (1)(3) - (1)(1) = 2\n\nP^(-1) = (1/determinant) * adjugate(P)\nP^(-1) = (1/2) * [[3, -1],\n                             [-1, 1]]\n\nNow, compute PDP^(-1):\nPDP^(-1) = [[1, 1],      [[3, 0],      [[3/2, -1/2],\n                   [1, 3]]      [0, -1]]      [-1/2, 1/2]]\n\nPDP^(-1) = [[5, -2],\n                   [6, -3]]\n\nSince A = PDP^(-1), we have found the correct diagonal matrix D and invertible matrix P."
