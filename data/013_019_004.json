    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nIn a game of Cheap Talk, Player A can either truthfully state her strategy as \"cooperate\" or lie and say she plans to \"defect.\" If Player A says she will cooperate, Player B will cooperate too. If Player A says she will defect, Player B will also defect. However, Player B doesn't know if Player A is telling the truth or lying. If both players cooperate, they each receive a payoff of 3. If both players defect, they each receive a payoff of 1. If one player cooperates and the other defects, the defector receives a payoff of 5 and the cooperator gets a payoff of 0.\n\nAssuming that Player A is honest with probability p (i.e., she tells the truth with probability p and lies with probability 1-p), what is Player B's best response strategy?",
    "message_2": "To find Player B's best response strategy, we need to calculate the expected payoffs for Player B when they choose to cooperate or defect, given Player A's probability of being honest (p).\n\n1. Expected payoff for Player B when they choose to cooperate:\n\nIf Player A is honest and says \"cooperate\" (probability p), both players cooperate and Player B gets a payoff of 3.\n\nIf Player A is lying and says \"defect\" (probability 1-p), Player A actually cooperates, but Player B still cooperates, so Player B gets a payoff of 3.\n\nSo, the expected payoff for Player B when they choose to cooperate is:\n\nE(cooperate) = p * 3 + (1-p) * 3 = 3\n\n2. Expected payoff for Player B when they choose to defect:\n\nIf Player A is honest and says \"cooperate\" (probability p), Player B defects and gets a payoff of 5.\n\nIf Player A is lying and says \"defect\" (probability 1-p), both players defect and Player B gets a payoff of 1.\n\nSo, the expected payoff for Player B when they choose to defect is:\n\nE(defect) = p * 5 + (1-p) * 1 = 5p + 1 - p = 4p + 1\n\nNow, we compare the expected payoffs for Player B when they choose to cooperate or defect:\n\nE(cooperate) = 3\nE(defect) = 4p + 1\n\nPlayer B's best response strategy depends on the value of p:\n\n- If 4p + 1 > 3, then Player B should choose to defect.\n- If 4p + 1 < 3, then Player B should choose to cooperate.\n- If 4p + 1 = 3, then Player B is indifferent between cooperating and defecting.\n\nSolving for p:\n\n4p + 1 > 3\n4p > 2\np > 1/2\n\nSo, if p > 1/2 (Player A is honest with a probability greater than 1/2), Player B's best response strategy is to defect. If p < 1/2, Player B's best response strategy is to cooperate. If p = 1/2, Player B is indifferent between cooperating and defecting."
