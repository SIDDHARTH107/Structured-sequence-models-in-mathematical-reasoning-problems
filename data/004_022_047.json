    "message_1": "A rectangular field has to be fenced with two types of fencing: 3 sides of the field will be enclosed with a barbed wire fence that costs $5 per linear foot, while the fourth side will be enclosed with a wooden fence that costs $15 per linear foot. The field's width is twice its length, and its perimeter must be 300 feet. What are the dimensions of the rectangular field that will minimize the total cost of the fencing?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangular field be L and the width be W. Since the width is twice the length, we can write W = 2L. The perimeter of the rectangular field is given by P = 2L + 2W. We are given that the perimeter is 300 feet, so:\n\n300 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we can substitute W = 2L into the equation:\n\n300 = 2L + 2(2L)\n300 = 2L + 4L\n300 = 6L\n\nNow, we can solve for L:\n\nL = 300 / 6\nL = 50 feet\n\nNow that we have the length, we can find the width:\n\nW = 2L\nW = 2(50)\nW = 100 feet\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular field are 50 feet by 100 feet.\n\nNow, let's find the total cost of the fencing. The three sides with barbed wire fencing have a total length of 2L + W = 2(50) + 100 = 200 feet. The cost of the barbed wire fencing is $5 per linear foot, so the total cost for the barbed wire fencing is:\n\n200 feet * $5/foot = $1000\n\nThe wooden fence is on the fourth side, which has a length of L = 50 feet. The cost of the wooden fence is $15 per linear foot, so the total cost for the wooden fence is:\n\n50 feet * $15/foot = $750\n\nThe total cost of the fencing is the sum of the costs of the barbed wire fencing and the wooden fence:\n\nTotal cost = $1000 + $750 = $1750"
