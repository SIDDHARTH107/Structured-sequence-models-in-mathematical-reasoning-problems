    "message_2": "First, we need to sort the dataset in ascending order:\n\n12, 12, 23, 23, 23, 34, 34, 45, 45, 55, 55, 55, 56, 67, 67, 67, 78, 78, 89, 90\n\nNow, let's calculate the mean (average) of the dataset:\n\nmean = (sum of all values) / (number of values)\nmean = (12 + 12 + 23 + 23 + 23 + 34 + 34 + 45 + 45 + 55 + 55 + 55 + 56 + 67 + 67 + 67 + 78 + 78 + 89 + 90) / 20\nmean = 1040 / 20\nmean = 52\n\nNext, let's find the median (middle value) of the dataset. Since there are 20 values (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values (10th and 11th values):\n\nmedian = (55 + 55) / 2\nmedian = 110 / 2\nmedian = 55\n\nSo, the mean of the dataset is 52, and the median is 55."
