If 10 consumers are randomly selected, what is the probability that at least 8 of them will prefer eco-friendly packaging? Round your answer to three decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a consumer preferring eco-friendly packaging)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of consumers randomly selected)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of consumers who prefer eco-friendly packaging)\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that at least 8 out of 10 consumers prefer eco-friendly packaging. This means we need to find the probability for 8, 9, and 10 consumers preferring eco-friendly packaging and then add those probabilities together.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of each individual case:\n\n1. Probability of 8 consumers preferring eco-friendly packaging:\nn = 10, k = 8, p = 0.7\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * (0.7)^8 * (1-0.7)^(10-8)\nP(X = 8) = 45 * (0.7)^8 * (0.3)^2\n\n2. Probability of 9 consumers preferring eco-friendly packaging:\nn = 10, k = 9, p = 0.7\nP(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * (0.7)^9 * (1-0.7)^(10-9)\nP(X = 9) = 10 * (0.7)^9 * (0.3)^1\n\n3. Probability of 10 consumers preferring eco-friendly packaging:\nn = 10, k = 10, p = 0.7\nP(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * (0.7)^10 * (1-0.7)^(10-10)\nP(X = 10) = 1 * (0.7)^10 * (0.3)^0\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 8) = 45 * (0.7)^8 * (0.3)^2 ≈ 0.120\nP(X = 9) = 10 * (0.7)^9 * (0.3)^1 ≈ 0.057\nP(X = 10) = 1 * (0.7)^10 * (0.3)^0 ≈ 0.028\n\nFinally, we add the probabilities together to find the probability of at least 8 consumers preferring eco-friendly packaging:\n\nP(X ≥ 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) ≈ 0.120 + 0.057 + 0.028 ≈ 0.205\n\nSo, the probability that at least 8 out of 10 randomly selected consumers will prefer eco-friendly packaging is approximately 0.205 or 20.5%."
