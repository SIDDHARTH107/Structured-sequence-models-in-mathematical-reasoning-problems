    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions to the equation 3x + 7y = 11, we can use the Diophantine equation method. First, we need to find one particular solution to the equation. We can do this by trial and error.\n\nLet's try x = 1:\n3(1) + 7y = 11\n7y = 8\ny = 8/7 (not an integer)\n\nLet's try x = 2:\n3(2) + 7y = 11\n6 + 7y = 11\n7y = 5\ny = 5/7 (not an integer)\n\nLet's try x = 3:\n3(3) + 7y = 11\n9 + 7y = 11\n7y = 2\ny = 2/7 (not an integer)\n\nLet's try x = 4:\n3(4) + 7y = 11\n12 + 7y = 11\n7y = -1\ny = -1/7 (not an integer)\n\nLet's try x = 5:\n3(5) + 7y = 11\n15 + 7y = 11\n7y = -4\ny = -4/7 (not an integer)\n\nLet's try x = 6:\n3(6) + 7y = 11\n18 + 7y = 11\n7y = -7\ny = -1 (an integer)\n\nSo, one particular solution is (x, y) = (6, -1).\n\nNow, we need to find the general solution. The general solution to a Diophantine equation of the form ax + by = c is given by:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is a particular solution, d = gcd(a, b), and n is an integer.\n\nIn our case, a = 3, b = 7, and d = gcd(3, 7) = 1. So, the general solution is:\n\nx = 6 + 7n\ny = -1 - 3n\n\nNow, we can find all integer solutions by plugging in different values of n:\n\nn = 0: (x, y) = (6, -1)\nn = 1: (x, y) = (-1, -4)\nn = 2: (x, y) = (-8, -7)\nn = 3: (x, y) = (-15, -10)\n...\n\nSo, the integer solutions to the equation 3x + 7y = 11 are given by:\n\n(x, y) = (6 + 7n, -1 - 3n)\n\nwhere n is an integer."
