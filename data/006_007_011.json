    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials, C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nIn this case, n = 5 (the number of trading days), p = 0.6 (the probability of the stock price going up), and (1-p) = 0.4 (the probability of the stock price going down).\n\nWe want to find the probability of the stock price increasing on at least 3 out of the next 5 trading days, which means we need to find the probability of it increasing on exactly 3, 4, or 5 days. We can calculate these probabilities separately and then add them together.\n\n1. Probability of the stock price increasing on exactly 3 days:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * (0.6)^3 * (0.4)^2\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.216 * 0.16\nP(X = 3) = 0.3456\n\n2. Probability of the stock price increasing on exactly 4 days:\n\nP(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * (0.6)^4 * (0.4)^1\nP(X = 4) = 5 * 0.1296 * 0.4\nP(X = 4) = 0.2592\n\n3. Probability of the stock price increasing on exactly 5 days:\n\nP(X = 5) = C(5, 5) * (0.6)^5 * (0.4)^0\nP(X = 5) = 1 * 0.07776 * 1\nP(X = 5) = 0.07776\n\nNow, we add these probabilities together:\n\nP(X >= 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)\nP(X >= 3) = 0.3456 + 0.2592 + 0.07776\nP(X >= 3) = 0.68256\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will increase on at least 3 out of the next 5 consecutive trading days is approximately 0.68256 or 68.256%."
