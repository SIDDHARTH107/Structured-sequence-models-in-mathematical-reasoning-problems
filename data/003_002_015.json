    "message_2": "To find the sine of a 45-degree angle, we can use the sine formula for a right triangle:\n\nsin(θ) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn a 45-45-90 right triangle, the two legs are congruent, and the ratio of the leg to the hypotenuse is 1/√2 or √2/2. Since the hypotenuse is given as 10 units, we can find the length of the opposite side (which is also the adjacent side in this case) by multiplying the hypotenuse by the ratio:\n\nopposite side = hypotenuse * (√2/2)\nopposite side = 10 * (√2/2)\n\nNow, we can find the sine of the 45-degree angle:\n\nsin(45) = opposite side / hypotenuse\nsin(45) = (10 * (√2/2)) / 10\n\nThe 10 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nsin(45) = √2/2\n\nSo, the sine of a 45-degree angle in a right triangle with a hypotenuse of length 10 units is √2/2."
