    "message_1": "Let C be the algebraic curve given by the equation y^2 = x^3 - 4x. Consider the Jacobian J(C) of C. What is the dimension of J(C) over the complex numbers?",
    "message_2": "The given curve C is defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 - 4x. We can rewrite this equation as y^2 = x(x^2 - 4), which is a genus 1 curve (an elliptic curve). The Jacobian J(C) of an elliptic curve has the same dimension as the genus of the curve. Therefore, the dimension of J(C) over the complex numbers is 1."
