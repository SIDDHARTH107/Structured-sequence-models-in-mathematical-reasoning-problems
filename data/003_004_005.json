    "message_2": "To solve the given trigonometric equation, we can treat it as a quadratic equation in terms of sin(x). Let y = sin(x), then the equation becomes:\n\n2y^2 - 3y + 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for y using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -3, and c = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ny = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4(2)(1))) / (2(2))\ny = (3 ± √(9 - 8)) / 4\ny = (3 ± √1) / 4\n\nThis gives us two possible values for y:\n\ny1 = (3 + 1) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1\ny2 = (3 - 1) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x that correspond to these values of y (sin(x)). \n\nFor y1 = 1:\n\nsin(x) = 1\nx = arcsin(1)\nx = π/2\n\nFor y2 = 1/2:\n\nsin(x) = 1/2\nx = arcsin(1/2)\n\nThere are two values of x in the interval [0, 2π] that satisfy this equation:\n\nx1 = π/6\nx2 = 5π/6\n\nSo, the solutions for the given trigonometric equation in the interval [0, 2π] are:\n\nx = π/2, π/6, 5π/6"
