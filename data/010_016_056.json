    "message_2": "A compact connected 2-dimensional manifold with genus g can be represented as a connected sum of g tori. The Betti numbers of a topological space are the dimensions of its homology groups, which give information about the number of independent cycles in the space.\n\nFor a closed surface X with genus g, the Betti numbers are as follows:\n\n1. b_0(X) = 1: This is because there is only one connected component in a connected manifold.\n\n2. b_1(X) = 2g: The first Betti number represents the number of independent 1-dimensional cycles. For a surface of genus g, there are 2g independent cycles (g \"horizontal\" and g \"vertical\" cycles in the connected sum of g tori).\n\n3. b_2(X) = 1: The second Betti number represents the number of independent 2-dimensional cycles. In this case, there is only one such cycle, which is the entire surface X.\n\nSince the rank of the first cohomology group is the same as the rank of the first homology group by Poincaré duality, we have:\n\nrank(H^1(X)) = rank(H_1(X)) = b_1(X) = 2g.\n\nIn summary, for a compact connected 2-dimensional manifold X with genus g, the Betti numbers are b_0(X) = 1, b_1(X) = 2g, and b_2(X) = 1, and the rank of the first cohomology group is 2g."
