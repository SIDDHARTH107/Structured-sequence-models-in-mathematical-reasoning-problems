    "message_2": "To determine the rank of the matrix A, we need to find the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by performing Gaussian elimination to obtain the row echelon form of the matrix.\n\nMatrix A:\n\n[ 1  2  3 ]\n[ 2  4  6 ]\n[-1 -2 -3 ]\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row.\n\n[ 1  2  3 ]\n[ 0  0  0 ]\n[-1 -2 -3 ]\n\nStep 2: Add the first row to the third row.\n\n[ 1  2  3 ]\n[ 0  0  0 ]\n[ 0  0  0 ]\n\nNow, the matrix is in row echelon form:\n\n[ 1  2  3 ]\n[ 0  0  0 ]\n[ 0  0  0 ]\n\nThere is only one non-zero row, which means there is only one linearly independent row. Therefore, the rank of the matrix A is 1."
