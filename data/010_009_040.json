    "message_2": "The number of distinct ways to triangulate a torus depends on the number of vertices, edges, and faces in the triangulation. A triangulation of a torus must satisfy Euler's formula for polyhedra, which states that V - E + F = 2 - 2g, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the surface (g = 1 for a torus).\n\nLet's consider the simplest case, where the triangulation has the minimum number of vertices, which is 3. In this case, we have:\n\n3 - E + F = 0\n\nSince there must be at least 3 edges in a triangulation, we can deduce that E = 3 and F = 1. This corresponds to a single triangle with identified edges, which is a valid triangulation of the torus.\n\nNow, let's consider the case with 4 vertices. In this case, we have:\n\n4 - E + F = 0\n\nSince there must be at least 6 edges in a triangulation with 4 vertices, we can deduce that E = 6 and F = 2. This corresponds to two triangles sharing an edge, with the remaining edges identified to form a torus. There are two distinct ways to do this, depending on which pairs of edges are identified.\n\nFor more complex triangulations with more vertices, the number of distinct ways to triangulate the torus increases. However, finding an exact count of distinct triangulations for an arbitrary number of vertices is a difficult combinatorial problem. In general, the number of distinct triangulations of a torus will depend on the specific constraints and requirements of the problem, and there is no simple formula to calculate it."
