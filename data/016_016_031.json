    "message_1": "A Gosper curve is constructed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then repeatedly replacing each straight line segment with a zigzag pattern (as seen here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosper_curve#/media/File:Gosper_curve_order_4.png). \n\nSuppose the length of one side of the equilateral triangle is 2 units. What is the total length of a Gosper curve of order n, where n is a positive integer?",
    "message_2": "Let L_n be the total length of a Gosper curve of order n. We start with an equilateral triangle with side length 2 units, so the initial length is L_0 = 3 * 2 = 6 units.\n\nFor each iteration, we replace each straight line segment with a zigzag pattern consisting of 7 segments of equal length. The length of each new segment is 1/3 of the length of the original segment (since the zigzag pattern is an enlargement of the original segment by a factor of 3).\n\nSo, for each iteration, the total length of the Gosper curve is multiplied by a factor of 7/3. Therefore, the total length of a Gosper curve of order n is given by:\n\nL_n = L_0 * (7/3)^n\nL_n = 6 * (7/3)^n"
