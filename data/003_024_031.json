    "message_2": "To find the projection of the 6-unit vector onto the 8-unit vector, we first need to find the unit vectors in the direction of these points and then use the dot product formula.\n\nLet A = (-2, 5) and B = (3, 1). \n\nFirst, find the vectors directed towards these points from the origin (0,0):\nVector A = <-2, 5>\nVector B = <3, 1>\n\nNow, we need to find the unit vectors in the direction of these points. To do this, we'll find the magnitude of each vector and then divide each component by its magnitude.\n\nMagnitude of Vector A = |A| = sqrt((-2)^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(29)\nMagnitude of Vector B = |B| = sqrt(3^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(10)\n\nUnit vector in the direction of A = a = <-2/√29, 5/√29>\nUnit vector in the direction of B = b = <3/√10, 1/√10>\n\nNow, we can find the projection of the 6-unit vector onto the 8-unit vector using the dot product formula:\n\nProjection = (6 * a) • (8 * b)\nProjection = 48 * (a • b)\n\nTo find the dot product (a • b), we multiply the corresponding components of the unit vectors and add them together:\n\na • b = (-2/√29 * 3/√10) + (5/√29 * 1/√10)\na • b = (-6/√290) + (5/√290)\na • b = -1/√290\n\nNow, we can find the projection:\n\nProjection = 48 * (-1/√290)\nProjection = -48/√290\n\nSo, the projection of the 6-unit vector onto the 8-unit vector is -48/√290."
