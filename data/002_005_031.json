    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 8 cm, and a height of 6 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of this rectangular prism to the nearest hundredth?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem: \n\nDiagonal² = Length² + Width² + Height²\n\nPlugging in the given dimensions:\n\nDiagonal² = (10 cm)² + (8 cm)² + (6 cm)²\nDiagonal² = 100 cm² + 64 cm² + 36 cm²\nDiagonal² = 200 cm²\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the diagonal:\n\nDiagonal = √(200 cm²)\nDiagonal ≈ 14.14 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 14.14 cm to the nearest hundredth."
