    "message_2": "To form a $3\\times3$ Latin square using the digits 1, 2, and 3, we need to arrange the digits in such a way that each row and column contains each of the three digits exactly once. Let's start filling in the Latin square row by row.\n\n1. The first row can be filled in 3! (3 factorial) ways, which is 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways. This is because there are 3 choices for the first digit, 2 choices for the second digit, and 1 choice for the third digit.\n\n2. For the second row, we have already used one of each digit in the first row. So, there are 2 choices for the first digit in the second row (since it cannot be the same as the digit above it), 2 choices for the second digit, and 1 choice for the third digit. This gives us 2 × 2 × 1 = 4 ways to fill in the second row.\n\n3. Finally, for the third row, there is only 1 way to fill it in, as the remaining digits for each column are determined by the first two rows.\n\nSo, the total number of different $3\\times3$ Latin squares is the product of the ways to fill in each row: 6 × 4 × 1 = 24."
