    "message_2": "According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree n has exactly n roots in the complex plane, counting multiplicities. Liouville's Theorem is not relevant to this problem, as it is a result in complex analysis that states that every bounded entire function must be constant.\n\nSince the given polynomial $p(z) = z^4 + 2z^3 + 3z^2 + 4z + 5$ has a degree of 4, it can have a maximum of 4 roots in the complex plane, counting multiplicities."
