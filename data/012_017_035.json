    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers every vertex exactly once. In other words, every vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the matching. For a graph to have a perfect matching, it must have an even number of vertices, which is the case for this graph with 6 vertices.\n\nWe can use the Tutte-Berge formula to determine if a perfect matching exists. The Tutte-Berge formula states that the size of the maximum matching in a graph G is at least (|V(G)| - o(G) + p(G)) / 2, where |V(G)| is the number of vertices in G, o(G) is the number of odd components in G, and p(G) is the number of connected components in G.\n\nIn this graph, there are 6 vertices, and the graph is connected, so p(G) = 1. There are no odd components, as every vertex has an even degree, so o(G) = 0. Plugging these values into the Tutte-Berge formula, we get:\n\n(|V(G)| - o(G) + p(G)) / 2 = (6 - 0 + 1) / 2 = 3.5\n\nSince the result is not an integer, the graph does not have a perfect matching.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to find a perfect matching manually. Let's try to match the vertices:\n\n1. Start with vertex A. We can match it with either vertex B or vertex C.\n2. If we match A with B, then we must match C with D (since D is the only unmatched neighbor of C). However, this leaves vertices E and F unmatched, and they are not connected by an edge, so this is not a perfect matching.\n3. If we match A with C, then we must match B with E (since E is the only unmatched neighbor of B). However, this leaves vertices D and F unmatched, and they are not connected by an edge, so this is not a perfect matching either.\n\nSince we cannot find a perfect matching, the graph G does not have a perfect matching."
