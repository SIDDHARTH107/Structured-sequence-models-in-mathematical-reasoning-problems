    "message_2": "First, let's solve the problem related to Liouville's theorem:\n\nGiven that $f(z)$ is entire and satisfies $|f(z)|\\leq 3$ for all complex numbers $z$, we want to show that $f(z)$ is a constant function.\n\nLiouville's theorem states that every bounded entire function is constant. Since $f(z)$ is entire and its absolute value is bounded by 3, according to Liouville's theorem, $f(z)$ must be a constant function. Thus, $f(z) = c$ for some constant $c \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nNow, let's solve the problem related to the fundamental theorem of algebra:\n\nWe want to find all complex roots of the polynomial $p(z) = 2z^3 + 3z^2 - 6z + 5$.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant polynomial has at least one complex root. Since $p(z)$ is a cubic polynomial, it must have exactly three complex roots, counting multiplicities.\n\nTo find the roots, we can attempt to factor the polynomial or use a numerical method such as Newton's method. In this case, we can notice that $p(1) = 2(1)^3 + 3(1)^2 - 6(1) + 5 = 0$, so $z = 1$ is a root of the polynomial. \n\nNow we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n$(2z^3 + 3z^2 - 6z + 5) \\div (z - 1) = 2z^2 + 5z - 5$\n\nNow we have $p(z) = (z - 1)(2z^2 + 5z - 5)$. To find the remaining roots, we can solve the quadratic equation $2z^2 + 5z - 5 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:\n\n$z = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(2)(-5)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{65}}{4}$\n\nSo the complex roots of the polynomial $p(z)$ are $z = 1, \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{65}}{4}, \\frac{-5 - \\sqrt{65}}{4}$."
