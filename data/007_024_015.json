    "message_2": "We want to find the smallest positive integer x such that 17^x ≡ 1 (mod 100). \n\nFirst, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to break this down into two congruences:\n\n17^x ≡ 1 (mod 4)\n17^x ≡ 1 (mod 25)\n\nSince 17 is odd, any power of 17 will also be odd, so 17^x will always be congruent to 1 modulo 4. Thus, we only need to find the smallest x such that 17^x ≡ 1 (mod 25).\n\nWe can use Euler's Totient Theorem, which states that for any integer a and any positive integer n that are relatively prime, a^(φ(n)) ≡ 1 (mod n), where φ(n) is the Euler's totient function. \n\nSince 17 and 25 are relatively prime, we can apply Euler's Totient Theorem. The totient function φ(25) = 25 * (1 - 1/5) = 20, so 17^20 ≡ 1 (mod 25). \n\nNow we need to check if there is a smaller x that satisfies the congruence. We can do this by checking the powers of 17 modulo 25:\n\n17^1 ≡ 17 (mod 25)\n17^2 ≡ 289 ≡ 14 (mod 25)\n17^3 ≡ 4913 ≡ 13 (mod 25)\n17^4 ≡ 83521 ≡ 21 (mod 25)\n17^5 ≡ 1419857 ≡ 7 (mod 25)\n17^6 ≡ 24137569 ≡ 19 (mod 25)\n17^7 ≡ 410338673 ≡ 23 (mod 25)\n17^8 ≡ 6975757441 ≡ 16 (mod 25)\n17^9 ≡ 118587876497 ≡ 22 (mod 25)\n17^10 ≡ 2015993900449 ≡ 24 (mod 25)\n17^11 ≡ 34271896307633 ≡ 8 (mod 25)\n17^12 ≡ 582622237229761 ≡ 11 (mod 25)\n17^13 ≡ 9904578032905937 ≡ 12 (mod 25)\n17^14 ≡ 168377826559400929 ≡ 4 (mod 25)\n17^15 ≡ 2862423051509815793 ≡ 18 (mod 25)\n17^16 ≡ 48661191875666868481 ≡ 6 (mod 25)\n17^17 ≡ 827240261886336764177 ≡ 2 (mod 25)\n17^18 ≡ 14063084452067724991009 ≡ 9 (mod 25)\n17^19 ≡ 239072434838619343673761 ≡ 11 (mod 25)\n17^20 ≡ 4064231407405479638187377 ≡ 1 (mod 25)\n\nWe can see that the smallest x that satisfies 17^x ≡ 1 (mod 25) is x = 20. Since 17^x is always congruent to 1 modulo 4, the smallest positive integer x such that 17^x ≡ 1 (mod 100) is x = 20."
