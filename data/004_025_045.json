    "message_2": "To find the final velocity of the object, we can use the equation:\n\nfinal velocity = initial velocity + acceleration × time\n\nFirst, we need to find the acceleration. We can use Newton's second law of motion:\n\nforce = mass × acceleration\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for acceleration:\n\nacceleration = force / mass\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nacceleration = 10 N / 2 kg = 5 m/s²\n\nNow, we can find the final velocity:\n\nfinal velocity = initial velocity + acceleration × time\nfinal velocity = 5 m/s + (5 m/s² × 4 s)\n\nfinal velocity = 5 m/s + 20 m/s = 25 m/s\n\nThe final velocity of the object is 25 m/s."
