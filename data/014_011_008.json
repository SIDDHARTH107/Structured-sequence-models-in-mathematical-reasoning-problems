    "message_2": "To decrypt the message, we need to rearrange the letters back into their original positions. Since the message is written in rows of 4 letters, we can create a table:\n\nM  I  S  F\nN  H  U  T\nA\n\nNow, we read the table column by column:\n\nM  N  A\nI  H\nS  U\nF  T\n\nThe decrypted message is \"MATH IS FUN\"."
