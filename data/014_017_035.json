    "message_2": "To perform a frequency analysis on the ciphertext \"LIPPS\", we need to analyze the frequency of each letter in the ciphertext and compare it to the frequency of letters in the English language. However, since the ciphertext is very short, it's difficult to perform a reliable frequency analysis. Instead, we can try to identify the pattern of the substitution cipher.\n\nLet's analyze the given ciphertext and the corresponding plaintext message:\n\nCiphertext: LIPPS\nPlaintext:  HELLO\n\nNow, let's find the difference between the corresponding letters in the ciphertext and the plaintext:\n\nL - H = 3\nI - E = 4\nP - L = 4\nP - L = 4\nS - O = 3\n\nWe can see that the difference between the corresponding letters is consistent (either 3 or 4). This suggests that the substitution cipher used is a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3 or 4.\n\nSince we already know the plaintext message is \"HELLO\", we can confirm that the Caesar cipher used has a shift of 4 (moving each letter 4 positions forward in the alphabet).\n\nSo, the corresponding plaintext message for the ciphertext \"LIPPS\" is \"HELLO\"."
