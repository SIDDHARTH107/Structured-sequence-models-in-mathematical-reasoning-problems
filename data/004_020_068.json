    "message_1": "A block is pulled 5 meters along a horizontal surface by a force of 10 newtons. Find the work done by the force using integration. The coefficient of friction between the block and the surface is 0.2.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we need to consider the force of friction acting against the applied force. The force of friction can be calculated using the formula:\n\nF_friction = μ * F_normal\n\nwhere μ is the coefficient of friction (0.2) and F_normal is the normal force, which is equal to the weight of the block (F_gravity) since the block is on a horizontal surface. \n\nSince we don't have the mass of the block, we can't find the exact value of the normal force. However, we can still find the work done by the force in terms of the normal force. The net force acting on the block is:\n\nF_net = F_applied - F_friction\n\nSince the force is constant, we can find the work done by integrating the net force with respect to distance:\n\nW = ∫(F_net) dx from 0 to 5\n\nW = ∫(F_applied - μ * F_normal) dx from 0 to 5\n\nNow we plug in the given values:\n\nW = ∫(10 - 0.2 * F_normal) dx from 0 to 5\n\nIntegrate with respect to x:\n\nW = [10x - 0.2 * F_normal * x] from 0 to 5\n\nNow evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nW = (10 * 5 - 0.2 * F_normal * 5) - (10 * 0 - 0.2 * F_normal * 0)\n\nW = 50 - F_normal\n\nSo the work done by the force is 50 - F_normal joules, where F_normal is the normal force acting on the block. To find the exact value of the work done, we would need to know the mass of the block to calculate the normal force."
