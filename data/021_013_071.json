Use an initial temperature of 1000 and reduce the temperature by a factor of 0.95 on each iteration. Starting at x=0, run the simulated annealing algorithm for 100 iterations.

    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the simulated annealing method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3.\n2. Initialize the starting point x = 0, initial temperature T = 1000, and cooling factor alpha = 0.95.\n3. Run the simulated annealing algorithm for 100 iterations.\n\nHere's the Python code for the simulated annealing algorithm:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 - 4*x + 3\n\ndef simulated_annealing(x, T, alpha, iterations):\n    current_x = x\n    current_f = f(current_x)\n    \n    for i in range(iterations):\n        new_x = current_x + random.uniform(-1, 1)\n        new_f = f(new_x)\n        \n        delta_f = new_f - current_f\n        \n        if delta_f < 0 or math.exp(-delta_f / T) > random.random():\n            current_x = new_x\n            current_f = new_f\n        \n        T *= alpha\n    \n    return current_x, current_f\n\nx_min, f_min = simulated_annealing(0, 1000, 0.95, 100)\nprint(\"Minimum value of f(x):\", f_min)\nprint(\"Corresponding value of x:\", x_min)\n```\n\nPlease note that the results may vary slightly due to the random nature of the simulated annealing algorithm. However, the algorithm should converge to the minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding value of x."
