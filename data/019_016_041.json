    "message_2": "To find the number of students who do not play either sport, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal students = students who play basketball + students who play soccer - students who play both sports + students who do not play either sport\n\n100 = 60 + 40 - 20 + students who do not play either sport\n\nNow, we can solve for the number of students who do not play either sport:\n\n100 = 80 - 20 + students who do not play either sport\n100 = 60 + students who do not play either sport\n\nSo, there are 40 students who do not play either sport."
