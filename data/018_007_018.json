    "message_2": "The power set of S, denoted as P(S), is the set of all possible subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself. To find the power set of S, we list all possible subsets:\n\nP(S) = {âˆ…, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}}\n\nNow, let's find the cardinality of S and P(S). The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set.\n\n|S| = 4 (since there are 4 elements in S: 1, 2, 3, and 4)\n\nTo find the cardinality of the power set P(S), we can use the formula |P(S)| = 2^|S|, where |S| is the cardinality of the set S.\n\n|P(S)| = 2^|S| = 2^4 = 16\n\nSo, the cardinality of P(S) is 16.\n\nNow, to show that the cardinality of the power set of S is greater than the cardinality of S itself, we compare |P(S)| and |S|:\n\n|P(S)| = 16\n|S| = 4\n\nSince 16 > 4, we can conclude that the cardinality of the power set of S is greater than the cardinality of S itself."
