    "message_2": "Both propositions p and q are true, as 3+5 does equal 8 and 2+2 does equal 4. Now let's evaluate the expression \"(p AND q) OR NOT(q)\" using the truth values of p and q.\n\n(p AND q) is true, since both p and q are true.\n\nNOT(q) is false, since q is true.\n\nNow we have the expression \"(True) OR (False)\", which evaluates to True, since only one of the operands needs to be true for the OR operator to be true.\n\nTherefore, the expression \"(p AND q) OR NOT(q)\" is true in propositional logic."
