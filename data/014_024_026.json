    "message_1": "Suppose a message is encrypted using the Caesar cipher with a key of 5. The letter \"A\" in the original message is encrypted as \"F\", and the letter \"G\" is encrypted as \"L\". What would be the encryption of the word \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\" using the same key?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the word \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\" using the Caesar cipher with a key of 5, we shift each letter 5 positions forward in the alphabet. If a letter goes beyond \"Z\", it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet. Here's the encryption for each letter:\n\nC -> H\nR -> W\nY -> D\nP -> U\nT -> Y\nO -> T\nG -> L\nR -> W\nA -> F\nP -> U\nH -> M\nY -> D\n\nSo, the encrypted word is \"HWDUYT LW FUMD\"."
