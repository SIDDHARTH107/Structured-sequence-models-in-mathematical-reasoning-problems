    "message_2": "To find the Riemann curvature tensor, we first need to find the Christoffel symbols. The metric tensor g_ij can be represented as a matrix:\n\ng = | 1  1  1 |\n      | 1  1  1 |\n      | 1  1  1 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse metric tensor g^ij. Since g is a symmetric matrix, we can use the formula for the inverse of a 3x3 matrix:\n\ng^(-1) = (1/det(g)) * adj(g)\n\nThe determinant of g is:\n\ndet(g) = 1(1 - 2) - 1(1 - 2) + 1(1 - 1) = -1 + 1 = 0\n\nSince the determinant is 0, the matrix g is singular, and it does not have an inverse. This means that the given metric is degenerate, and it does not define a proper Riemannian manifold.\n\nIn this case, we cannot compute the Riemann curvature tensor, as it requires a non-degenerate metric tensor."
