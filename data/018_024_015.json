    "message_2": "1. A Δ B\nThe symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\n2. A Δ B'\nFirst, we need to find the complement of set B, denoted as B'. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. Let's assume the universal set U contains all the elements from 1 to 5:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4} = {1, 5}\n\nNow, we can find A Δ B':\n\nA Δ B' = (A ∪ B') - (A ∩ B')\n\nA ∪ B' = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {1, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 5}\nA ∩ B' = {1, 2, 3} ∩ {1, 5} = {1}\n\nA Δ B' = {1, 2, 3, 5} - {1} = {2, 3, 5}\n\n3. A' Δ B\nFirst, we need to find the complement of set A, denoted as A'. \n\nA' = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 2, 3} = {4, 5}\n\nNow, we can find A' Δ B:\n\nA' Δ B = (A' ∪ B) - (A' ∩ B)\n\nA' ∪ B = {4, 5} ∪ {2, 3, 4} = {2, 3, 4, 5}\nA' ∩ B = {4, 5} ∩ {2, 3, 4} = {4}\n\nA' Δ B = {2, 3, 4, 5} - {4} = {2, 3, 5}\n\nComparing the results:\n\n(1) A Δ B = {1, 4}\n(2) A Δ B' = {2, 3, 5}\n(3) A' Δ B = {2, 3, 5}\n\nAs we can see, (1) and (2) are not equal, but (3) is equal to (2). Therefore, the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement."
