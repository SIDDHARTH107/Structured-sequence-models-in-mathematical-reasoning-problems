    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the position vector r(t).\n\nr(t) = <cos(2t), sin(2t), 3t>\n\nFirst derivative (velocity vector):\nr'(t) = <-2sin(2t), 2cos(2t), 3>\n\nSecond derivative (acceleration vector):\nr''(t) = <-4cos(2t), -4sin(2t), 0>\n\nNow we can find the curvature (k) using the formula:\n\nk(t) = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nAt t = 1, we have:\n\nr'(1) = <-2sin(2), 2cos(2), 3>\nr''(1) = <-4cos(2), -4sin(2), 0>\n\nNow, we find the cross product of r'(1) and r''(1):\n\nr'(1) x r''(1) = <12sin(2), 12cos(2), 8>\n\nNext, we find the magnitudes of r'(1) and the cross product:\n\n||r'(1)|| = sqrt((-2sin(2))^2 + (2cos(2))^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13)\n||r'(1) x r''(1)|| = sqrt((12sin(2))^2 + (12cos(2))^2 + 8^2) = sqrt(144 + 64) = sqrt(208)\n\nNow we can find the curvature:\n\nk(1) = ||r'(1) x r''(1)|| / ||r'(1)||^3 = sqrt(208) / (sqrt(13))^3 = sqrt(208) / 2197\n\nNow, let's find the torsion (τ). We use the formula:\n\nτ(t) = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nFirst, we need the third derivative of r(t):\n\nr'''(t) = <8sin(2t), -8cos(2t), 0>\n\nAt t = 1, we have:\n\nr'''(1) = <8sin(2), -8cos(2), 0>\n\nNow, we find the dot product of the cross product r'(1) x r''(1) and r'''(1):\n\n(r'(1) x r''(1)) • r'''(1) = <12sin(2), 12cos(2), 8> • <8sin(2), -8cos(2), 0> = 96sin^2(2) - 96cos^2(2)\n\nNext, we find the magnitude of the cross product squared:\n\n||r'(1) x r''(1)||^2 = (sqrt(208))^2 = 208\n\nFinally, we can find the torsion:\n\nτ(1) = (r'(1) x r''(1)) • r'''(1) / ||r'(1) x r''(1)||^2 = (96sin^2(2) - 96cos^2(2)) / 208\n\nSo, the curvature and torsion of the curve at t = 1 are:\n\nk(1) = sqrt(208) / 2197\nτ(1) = (96sin^2(2) - 96cos^2(2)) / 208"
