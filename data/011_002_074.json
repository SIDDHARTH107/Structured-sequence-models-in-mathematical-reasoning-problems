    "message_1": "A bowl contains 7 red balls, 5 blue balls, and 4 green balls. What is the total number of ways you can choose 2 balls from the bowl?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nIn this case, we have a total of 7 red balls + 5 blue balls + 4 green balls = 16 balls. We want to choose 2 balls, so k = 2.\n\nC(16, 2) = 16! / (2!(16-2)!)\nC(16, 2) = 16! / (2! * 14!)\nC(16, 2) = (16 * 15 * 14!)/(2! * 14!)\nC(16, 2) = (16 * 15)/(2 * 1)\nC(16, 2) = 240 / 2\nC(16, 2) = 120\n\nSo there are 120 ways to choose 2 balls from the bowl."
