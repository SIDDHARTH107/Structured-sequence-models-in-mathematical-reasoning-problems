    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve from the subtopic Non-parametric statistics:\n\nA study was conducted to compare the weights of two different breeds of dogs. The weights, in pounds, of 7 beagles and 8 golden retrievers are:\n\nBeagles: 22, 25, 27, 20, 21, 24, 26\nGolden Retrievers: 66, 78, 70, 75, 80, 72, 68, 73\n\nUsing the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, determine whether there is a significant difference in the weights between the two breeds of dogs. Use a significance level of α=0.05.",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Combine the two samples and rank the data from smallest to largest.\n2. Calculate the sum of the ranks for each group.\n3. Calculate the test statistic W.\n4. Determine the critical value and compare it to the test statistic to make a decision.\n\nStep 1: Combine and rank the data\n\nBeagles: 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27\nGolden Retrievers: 66, 68, 70, 72, 73, 75, 78, 80\n\nCombined: 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 66, 68, 70, 72, 73, 75, 78, 80\nRanks:     1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\n\nStep 2: Calculate the sum of the ranks for each group\n\nSum of ranks for Beagles: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28\nSum of ranks for Golden Retrievers: 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 = 92\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic W\n\nW = smallest sum of ranks = 28\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical value and compare it to the test statistic\n\nFor a sample size of 7 Beagles and 8 Golden Retrievers, and a significance level of α=0.05, we can look up the critical value in a Wilcoxon rank-sum test table or use statistical software. The critical value for this problem is 23.\n\nSince our test statistic W = 28 is greater than the critical value of 23, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in the weights between the two breeds of dogs at the 0.05 significance level."
