    "message_2": "Cauchy's theorem states that the integral of an analytic function over a simple closed curve is zero. However, the function f(z) = sin(z)/z is not analytic at z = 0, which is inside the unit circle |z| = 1. Therefore, we cannot directly apply Cauchy's theorem to this problem.\n\nInstead, we can use the Cauchy integral formula, which states that for an analytic function f(z) inside a simple closed curve C and a point a inside C:\n\nf(a) = (1/(2πi)) * ∮(f(z)/(z-a)) dz\n\nWe can rewrite the function f(z) = sin(z)/z as g(z) = sin(z)/(z(z-0)), where a = 0. Now, g(z) is analytic everywhere except at z = 0. We can apply the Cauchy integral formula to g(z) to find the value of sin(0)/0:\n\nsin(0)/0 = (1/(2πi)) * ∮(sin(z)/(z^2)) dz\n\nSince sin(0) = 0, the left-hand side of the equation is 0:\n\n0 = (1/(2πi)) * ∮(sin(z)/(z^2)) dz\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2πi, we get:\n\n0 = ∮(sin(z)/(z^2)) dz\n\nTherefore, the integral of f(z) = sin(z)/z along the unit circle |z| = 1 in the counterclockwise direction is 0."
