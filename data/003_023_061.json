    "message_2": "To find the magnitude of the cross product of A and B using trigonometry, we first need to find the angle between the two vectors. We can do this using the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe dot product of A and B is given by:\nA · B = (3 * 2) + (2 * 6) + (5 * -7) = 6 + 12 - 35 = -17\n\nThe magnitudes of A and B are given by:\n|A| = √(3^2 + 2^2 + 5^2) = √(9 + 4 + 25) = √38\n|B| = √(2^2 + 6^2 + (-7)^2) = √(4 + 36 + 49) = √89\n\nNow we can find the angle θ between A and B using the dot product formula:\nA · B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ)\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| * |B|)\ncos(θ) = -17 / (√38 * √89)\n\nθ = arccos(-17 / (√38 * √89))\n\nNow we can find the magnitude of the cross product of A and B using the sine of the angle between them:\n|A x B| = |A| * |B| * sin(θ)\n\nSince sin(θ) = √(1 - cos^2(θ)), we have:\nsin(θ) = √(1 - (-17 / (√38 * √89))^2)\n\n|A x B| = √38 * √89 * √(1 - (-17 / (√38 * √89))^2)\n\nCalculating the values, we get:\n|A x B| ≈ 49.305"
