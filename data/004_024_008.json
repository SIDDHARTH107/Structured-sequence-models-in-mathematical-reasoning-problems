    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the implicit function given by the equation 2x^3 + y^3 - 6xy = 9, we will differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, using the chain rule when necessary.\n\nFirst, let's differentiate each term with respect to x:\n\nd/dx(2x^3) = 6x^2 (using the power rule)\n\nd/dx(y^3) = 3y^2 * dy/dx (using the chain rule, since y is a function of x)\n\nd/dx(-6xy) = -6(dy/dx * x + y) (using the product rule)\n\nd/dx(9) = 0 (constant term)\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n6x^2 + 3y^2 * dy/dx - 6(dy/dx * x + y) = 0\n\nNow, we want to solve for dy/dx:\n\n3y^2 * dy/dx - 6x * dy/dx = 6y - 6x^2\n\ndy/dx (3y^2 - 6x) = 6y - 6x^2\n\nNow, divide both sides by (3y^2 - 6x) to isolate dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = (6y - 6x^2) / (3y^2 - 6x)\n\nSo, the derivative of the implicit function given by the equation 2x^3 + y^3 - 6xy = 9 is:\n\ndy/dx = (6y - 6x^2) / (3y^2 - 6x)"
