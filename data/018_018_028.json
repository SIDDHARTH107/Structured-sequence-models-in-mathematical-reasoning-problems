    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the two sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (all unique elements from both sets)\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {3} (the common element in both sets)\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference A Δ B:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {3} = {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nNow, to show that the symmetric difference is commutative, we need to prove that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince the union and intersection are commutative (A ∪ B = B ∪ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A), we can rewrite this as:\n\nB Δ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nComparing this with the expression for A Δ B, we can see that they are the same:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = B Δ A\n\nTherefore, the symmetric difference is commutative."
