    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all vertices in the graph such that each vertex is connected to exactly one edge in the matching.\n\nIn this graph, we can see that there is a perfect matching:\n\n1. Edge a connects vertices A and B.\n2. Edge c connects vertices B and C.\n3. Edge d connects vertices C and D.\n4. Edge e connects vertices D and E.\n5. Edge f connects vertices E and F.\n\nSo, the perfect matching consists of the edges {a, c, d, e, f}. Each vertex is connected to exactly one edge in the matching, and all vertices are covered."
