    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting rained on during the entire week, we can first find the probability of not getting rained on each day and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of not getting rained on each day is 60% (100% - 40%).\n\nFor independent events, the probability of all events occurring is the product of the individual probabilities. So, the probability of not getting rained on for the entire week (7 days) is:\n\n0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.6^7 ≈ 0.02799 (rounded to 5 decimal places)\n\nNow, subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of getting rained on during the entire week:\n\n1 - 0.02799 ≈ 0.97201\n\nSo, the probability of getting rained on during the entire week is approximately 97.201%."
