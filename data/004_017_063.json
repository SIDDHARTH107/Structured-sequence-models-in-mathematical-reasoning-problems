    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 4, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we need to find (dy/dx)^2:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = (3/2)^2 * x\n\nNext, we need to find the square root of (1 + (dy/dx)^2):\n\n√(1 + (dy/dx)^2) = √(1 + (3/2)^2 * x)\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √(1 + (3/2)^2 * x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use substitution. Let u = 1 + (3/2)^2 * x. Then, du/dx = (3/2)^2, and dx = du / (3/2)^2.\n\nL = ∫[0, 4] √u * (du / (3/2)^2)\n\nNow, we need to change the limits of integration according to the substitution:\n\nu(0) = 1 + (3/2)^2 * 0 = 1\nu(4) = 1 + (3/2)^2 * 4 = 1 + 9 = 10\n\nSo, the new limits of integration are [1, 10]:\n\nL = ∫[1, 10] √u * (du / (3/2)^2)\n\nNow, we can solve the integral:\n\nL = (2/3)^2 * ∫[1, 10] u^(1/2) du\nL = (4/9) * (2/3 * u^(3/2))[1, 10]\nL = (8/27) * (10^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))\nL = (8/27) * (20√2 - 1)\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 4 is approximately:\n\nL ≈ (8/27) * (20√2 - 1)"
