    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 16x^3 + 24x^2 + 10, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x).\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^4 - 16x^3 + 24x^2 + 10)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 48x^2 + 48x\n\nNow, we find the second derivative, f''(x), by taking the derivative of f'(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx(12x^3 - 48x^2 + 48x)\n\nUsing the power rule again, we get:\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 96x + 48\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 16x^3 + 24x^2 + 10 is f''(x) = 36x^2 - 96x + 48."
