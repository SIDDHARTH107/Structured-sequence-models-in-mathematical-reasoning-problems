A small hole is drilled in the middle of the disc, and water is poured into it at a constant rate of 2 cm$^3$/s. Find the rate at which the water level in the hole is rising when it is 3 cm deep. (Hint: the wave equation for the water level is given by $\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial t^2} = c^2\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2}\\right)$, where $h(x,y,t)$ is the height of the water at position $(x,y)$ on the disc and time $t$, and $c$ is the speed of water waves in the disc.)",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the concept of volume. Let's denote the height of the water in the hole as $h$. Since the hole is in the middle of the disc, the shape of the water in the hole will be a cylinder with height $h$ and radius $r$. The volume of this cylinder can be given by:\n\n$V = \\pi r^2 h$\n\nNow, we are given that the water is poured at a constant rate of 2 cm$^3$/s. This means that the rate of change of volume with respect to time is 2 cm$^3$/s. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\n$\\frac{dV}{dt} = 2$\n\nWe need to find the rate at which the water level in the hole is rising when it is 3 cm deep, i.e., we need to find $\\frac{dh}{dt}$ when $h = 3$ cm.\n\nTo do this, we can differentiate the volume equation with respect to time:\n\n$\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{d(\\pi r^2 h)}{dt}$\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\n$\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\pi r^2 \\frac{dh}{dt} + 2\\pi r h \\frac{dr}{dt}$\n\nSince $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 2$, we can substitute this value in the above equation:\n\n$2 = \\pi r^2 \\frac{dh}{dt} + 2\\pi r h \\frac{dr}{dt}$\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between $r$ and $h$. Since the hole is in the middle of the disc, the shape of the water in the hole will be a cone with height $h$ and radius $r$. Using similar triangles, we can find the relationship between $r$ and $h$:\n\n$\\frac{r}{h} = \\frac{4}{12} \\Rightarrow r = \\frac{h}{3}$\n\nNow, we can differentiate this relationship with respect to time:\n\n$\\frac{dr}{dt} = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{dh}{dt}$\n\nSubstitute the values of $r$ and $\\frac{dr}{dt}$ in the equation for $\\frac{dV}{dt}$:\n\n$2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{h}{3}\\right)^2 \\frac{dh}{dt} + 2\\pi \\frac{h}{3} h \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{dh}{dt}$\n\nNow, we need to find $\\frac{dh}{dt}$ when $h = 3$ cm. Substitute $h = 3$ in the above equation:\n\n$2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{3}{3}\\right)^2 \\frac{dh}{dt} + 2\\pi \\frac{3}{3} (3) \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{dh}{dt}$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$2 = \\pi \\frac{dh}{dt} + 2\\pi \\frac{dh}{dt}$\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n$2 = 3\\pi \\frac{dh}{dt}$\n\nNow, solve for $\\frac{dh}{dt}$:\n\n$\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{2}{3\\pi}$\n\nSo, the rate at which the water level in the hole is rising when it is 3 cm deep is $\\frac{2}{3\\pi}$ cm/s."
