    "message_1": "A tank initially contains 100 liters of water with a salt concentration of 0.1 kg/liter. Water with a salt concentration of 0.5 kg/liter is entering the tank at a rate of 5 liters per minute, and the mixture is allowed to flow out of the tank at the same rate. Assuming that the tank is well-mixed at all times, what is the salt concentration in the tank after 30 minutes? Solve the differential equation that models this situation.",
    "message_2": "Let Q(t) be the amount of salt in the tank at time t (in minutes). The tank initially contains 100 liters of water with a salt concentration of 0.1 kg/liter, so Q(0) = 100 * 0.1 = 10 kg.\n\nWater with a salt concentration of 0.5 kg/liter is entering the tank at a rate of 5 liters per minute, so the rate of salt entering the tank is 5 * 0.5 = 2.5 kg/min.\n\nThe mixture is allowed to flow out of the tank at the same rate of 5 liters per minute. Since the tank is well-mixed at all times, the salt concentration in the tank at any time t is Q(t) / 100 kg/liter. Therefore, the rate of salt leaving the tank is 5 * (Q(t) / 100) kg/min.\n\nNow we can set up the differential equation for the amount of salt in the tank:\n\ndQ/dt = rate of salt entering - rate of salt leaving\ndQ/dt = 2.5 - 5 * (Q(t) / 100)\n\nTo solve this first-order linear differential equation, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by:\n\nIF = e^(∫P(t) dt) = e^(∫(-5/100) dt) = e^(-t/20)\n\nNow, multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(-t/20) dQ/dt - (5/100) * e^(-t/20) * Q(t) = 2.5 * e^(-t/20)\n\nThe left side of this equation is now the derivative of the product of Q(t) and the integrating factor:\n\nd/dt [Q(t) * e^(-t/20)] = 2.5 * e^(-t/20)\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫d [Q(t) * e^(-t/20)] = ∫2.5 * e^(-t/20) dt\n\nQ(t) * e^(-t/20) = -50 * e^(-t/20) + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition Q(0) = 10 kg:\n\n10 = -50 * e^(0) + C\nC = 60\n\nNow we can solve for Q(t):\n\nQ(t) * e^(-t/20) = -50 * e^(-t/20) + 60\nQ(t) = -50 + 60 * e^(t/20)\n\nFinally, we can find the salt concentration in the tank after 30 minutes:\n\nQ(30) = -50 + 60 * e^(30/20)\nQ(30) ≈ 20.91 kg\n\nSince the volume of the water in the tank remains constant at 100 liters, the salt concentration after 30 minutes is:\n\nSalt concentration = Q(30) / 100 ≈ 20.91 / 100 ≈ 0.2091 kg/liter."
