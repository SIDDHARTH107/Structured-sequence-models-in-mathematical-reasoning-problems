    "message_1": "A farmer has a field of 500 square meters and wants to plant two crops - wheat and corn. The profit for every kg of wheat is $10 and for every kg of corn is $15. The farmer has 150 kg of wheat seeds and 200 kg of corn seeds. Wheat requires a space of 2 sq.meters whereas corn requires 3 sq.meters. How many kilometers of land should be used for wheat and corn to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal combination of wheat and corn that can be planted within the 500 square meters of land available. Let's use x for the amount of land used for wheat and y for the amount of land used for corn.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. The total area used for both crops cannot exceed 500 square meters:\n   2x + 3y ≤ 500\n\n2. The farmer has 150 kg of wheat seeds and 200 kg of corn seeds. Since the profit is calculated per kg, we can assume that the farmer will use all the seeds available. Therefore, the area used for wheat and corn should be proportional to the amount of seeds available:\n   x / 150 = y / 200\n   200x = 150y\n\nNow, we need to find the combination of x and y that maximizes the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y, subject to the constraints above.\n\nFirst, let's solve the second constraint for y:\n   y = (200/150)x\n   y = (4/3)x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the first constraint:\n   2x + 3((4/3)x) ≤ 500\n   2x + 4x ≤ 500\n   6x ≤ 500\n   x ≤ 500/6\n   x ≤ 83.33\n\nSince x represents the area used for wheat, it must be a multiple of 2. The largest multiple of 2 less than or equal to 83.33 is 82. Therefore, the maximum area that can be used for wheat is 82 square meters.\n\nNow, let's find the corresponding area for corn using the expression for y:\n   y = (4/3)(82)\n   y = 328/3\n   y ≈ 109.33\n\nSince y represents the area used for corn, it must be a multiple of 3. The largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 109.33 is 108. Therefore, the maximum area that can be used for corn is 108 square meters.\n\nSo, the farmer should use 82 square meters of land for wheat and 108 square meters of land for corn to maximize the profit."
