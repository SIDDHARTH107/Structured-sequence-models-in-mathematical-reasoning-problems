If yes, provide an isomorphism mapping between their vertices. If not, explain why they are not isomorphic.",
    "message_2": "Graphs A and B are not isomorphic.\n\nTo determine if two graphs are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between their vertices such that the adjacency between vertices is preserved.\n\nLet's analyze the degree of each vertex in both graphs:\n\nGraph A:\n- Degree of vertex 1: 2\n- Degree of vertex 2: 2\n- Degree of vertex 3: 3\n- Degree of vertex 4: 1\n- Degree of vertex 5: 1\n\nGraph B:\n- Degree of vertex 1: 2\n- Degree of vertex 2: 2\n- Degree of vertex 3: 2\n- Degree of vertex 4: 2\n- Degree of vertex 5: 1\n\nWe can see that the degree sequences are different: (2, 2, 3, 1, 1) for Graph A and (2, 2, 2, 2, 1) for Graph B. Since the degree sequences are not the same, there cannot be a bijection between the vertices that preserves adjacency, and therefore, the graphs are not isomorphic."
