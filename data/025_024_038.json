    "message_1": "Given a projective space $\\mathbb{P}^2$ with coordinates $[x:y:z]$, consider the binary cubic form:\n$$f(x,y,z) = ax^3 + bx^2y + cxy^2 + dy^2z + eyz^2 + fz^3$$\n\nwhere $a,b,c,d,e,f \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Show that if $f$ vanishes on the line $L=[1:-1:0]$ and the point $P=[1:0:0]$, then $f$ is divisible by the quadratic factor $x-y$.",
    "message_2": "We are given that $f$ vanishes on the line $L=[1:-1:0]$. This means that for any point on the line $L$, the function $f$ evaluates to zero. The line $L$ can be parameterized by $[x:y:z] = [t:-t:0]$ for some $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So, we have:\n\n$$f(t, -t, 0) = at^3 + bt^2(-t) + c(-t)^2t + d(-t)^2(0) + e(0)(0) + f(0)^3 = 0$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$at^3 - bt^3 + ct^3 = 0$$\n\nSince this holds for any $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we can factor out $t^3$:\n\n$$(a - b + c)t^3 = 0$$\n\nSince this holds for any $t$, we must have $a - b + c = 0$.\n\nNext, we are given that $f$ vanishes at the point $P=[1:0:0]$. This means that:\n\n$$f(1, 0, 0) = a(1)^3 + b(1)^2(0) + c(0)^2(0) + d(0)^2(0) + e(0)(0) + f(0)^3 = 0$$\n\nSimplifying, we get $a = 0$. \n\nNow, we can rewrite the cubic form as:\n\n$$f(x,y,z) = (a - b)x^3 + bx^2y + cxy^2 + dy^2z + eyz^2 + fz^3$$\n\nSince $a = 0$, we have:\n\n$$f(x,y,z) = -bx^3 + bx^2y + cxy^2 + dy^2z + eyz^2 + fz^3$$\n\nNow, we can factor out $x$ from the first three terms:\n\n$$f(x,y,z) = x(-by^2 + by + c)y + dy^2z + eyz^2 + fz^3$$\n\nRecall that we found $a - b + c = 0$, and since $a = 0$, we have $-b + c = 0$, or $c = b$. So, we can rewrite the cubic form as:\n\n$$f(x,y,z) = x(by^2 - by + b)y + dy^2z + eyz^2 + fz^3$$\n\nNow, we can factor out $b$ from the first three terms:\n\n$$f(x,y,z) = bxy(y^2 - y + 1) + dy^2z + eyz^2 + fz^3$$\n\nNotice that the first term is divisible by $x - y$, as $y^2 - y + 1 = (x - y)(x + y - 1)$ when $x = y$. Therefore, the cubic form $f(x,y,z)$ is divisible by the quadratic factor $x - y$, as required."
