    "message_2": "First, let's find the slope using the given points (-2, 5) and (1, -1):\n\nslope = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (-1 - 5)/(1 - (-2)) = (-6)/(3) = -2\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can find the y-intercept using the slope-intercept form of a linear equation. We can use either point, so let's use (-2, 5):\n\n5 = (-2)(-2) + b\n5 = 4 + b\nb = 1\n\nSo, the y-intercept is 1. The equation of the line is:\n\ny = -2x + 1\n\nTo graph the line, we can start by plotting the y-intercept (0, 1) on the coordinate plane. Then, use the slope to find another point on the line. Since the slope is -2, we can go down 2 units and to the right 1 unit from the y-intercept to find another point (1, -1). Plot this point and draw a straight line through both points. This line represents the equation y = -2x + 1."
