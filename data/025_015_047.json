    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane that contains the line of intersection between the given surfaces and passes through the point (1, -2, 3), we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Express one of the variables from the linear equation (2x - y + z + 3 = 0) in terms of the other two variables.\n2. Substitute the expression obtained in step 1 into the quadratic equation (x² + 3y² - z² = 1).\n3. Solve the resulting equation for the remaining variable.\n4. Use the point (1, -2, 3) to find the constant term in the equation of the plane.\n\nStep 1: Express one of the variables from the linear equation in terms of the other two variables.\nLet's express z in terms of x and y:\nz = 2x - y - 3\n\nStep 2: Substitute the expression obtained in step 1 into the quadratic equation.\nx² + 3y² - (2x - y - 3)² = 1\n\nStep 3: Solve the resulting equation for the remaining variable.\nx² + 3y² - (4x² - 4xy + y² + 12x - 6y + 9) = 1\n-3x² + 4xy - 2y² - 12x + 6y = -8\n\nNow, let's multiply the equation by -1 to make it look more standard:\n3x² - 4xy + 2y² + 12x - 6y = 8\n\nStep 4: Use the point (1, -2, 3) to find the constant term in the equation of the plane.\n3(1)² - 4(1)(-2) + 2(-2)² + 12(1) - 6(-2) = 8\n3 + 8 + 8 + 12 + 12 = 8 + k\n43 = 8 + k\nk = 35\n\nSo, the equation of the plane that contains the line of intersection between the given surfaces and passes through the point (1, -2, 3) is:\n\n3x² - 4xy + 2y² + 12x - 6y + 35 = 0"
