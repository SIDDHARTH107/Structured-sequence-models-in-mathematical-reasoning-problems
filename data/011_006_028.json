    "message_2": "This is a problem of combinations with repetition (also known as multisets). We have 4 different flavors of donuts and we want to choose 6 donuts. We can use the formula for combinations with repetition:\n\nC(n + r - 1, r) = C(n - 1, r - 1)\n\nwhere n is the number of flavors (4) and r is the number of donuts we want to choose (6).\n\nC(4 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(9, 6) = 9! / (6! * (9 - 6)!)\n\nC(9, 6) = 9! / (6! * 3!) = 362880 / (720 * 6) = 84\n\nSo there are 84 ways to choose 6 donuts from 4 different flavors with unlimited donuts of each flavor available."
