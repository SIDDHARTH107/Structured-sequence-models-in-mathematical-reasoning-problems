    "message_1": "A bakery produces two types of cakes: chocolate and vanilla. To make each chocolate cake, the bakery uses 4 cups of flour, 2 cups of sugar, and 1 cup of chocolate chips. To make each vanilla cake, the bakery uses 3 cups of flour, 3 cups of sugar, and 1 cup of vanilla extract. The bakery has 16 cups of flour, 14 cups of sugar, and 6 cups of chocolate chips available each day. What is the maximum number of cakes (of any combination of chocolate and vanilla) that the bakery can make each day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chocolate cakes and y be the number of vanilla cakes.\n\nThe constraints for the ingredients are as follows:\n\nFlour: 4x + 3y ≤ 16\nSugar: 2x + 3y ≤ 14\nChocolate chips: x ≤ 6\n\nWe want to maximize the total number of cakes, which is x + y.\n\nFirst, let's solve the flour constraint for y:\n\n3y ≤ 16 - 4x\ny ≤ (16 - 4x)/3\n\nNow, let's solve the sugar constraint for y:\n\n3y ≤ 14 - 2x\ny ≤ (14 - 2x)/3\n\nSince x ≤ 6, we can test each possible value of x and find the corresponding maximum value of y:\n\nx = 0: y ≤ (16 - 4*0)/3 = 16/3 ≈ 5.33, so y = 5\nx = 1: y ≤ (16 - 4*1)/3 = 12/3 = 4\nx = 2: y ≤ (16 - 4*2)/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.67, so y = 2\nx = 3: y ≤ (14 - 2*3)/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.67, so y = 2\nx = 4: y ≤ (14 - 2*4)/3 = 6/3 = 2\nx = 5: y ≤ (14 - 2*5)/3 = 4/3 ≈ 1.33, so y = 1\nx = 6: y ≤ (14 - 2*6)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.67, so y = 0\n\nNow, let's find the maximum value of x + y:\n\nx = 0, y = 5: x + y = 0 + 5 = 5\nx = 1, y = 4: x + y = 1 + 4 = 5\nx = 2, y = 2: x + y = 2 + 2 = 4\nx = 3, y = 2: x + y = 3 + 2 = 5\nx = 4, y = 2: x + y = 4 + 2 = 6\nx = 5, y = 1: x + y = 5 + 1 = 6\nx = 6, y = 0: x + y = 6 + 0 = 6\n\nThe maximum number of cakes (of any combination of chocolate and vanilla) that the bakery can make each day is 6. This can be achieved by making 4 chocolate cakes and 2 vanilla cakes, or 5 chocolate cakes and 1 vanilla cake, or 6 chocolate cakes and no vanilla cakes."
