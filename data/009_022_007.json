    "message_2": "To find the steady-state solution, we set the time derivative equal to zero:\n\n$0 = D_1\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x^2} + D_2\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial y^2} + f(u)$\n\nSince $D_1 = 1$ and $D_2 = 2$, we have:\n\n$0 = \\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x^2} + 2\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial y^2} + u(1-u)(\\alpha-u)$\n\nFor the steady-state solution, we assume that the spatial derivatives are also zero:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x^2} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial y^2} = 0$\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n$0 = u(1-u)(\\alpha-u)$\n\nThis equation has three steady-state solutions: $u = 0$, $u = 1$, and $u = \\alpha$. These solutions represent the uniform concentration of the chemical species in the domain.\n\nNow, let's sketch the steady-state solutions for $\\alpha = 1, 2, 3$:\n\n1. For $\\alpha = 1$, the steady-state solutions are $u = 0$, $u = 1$, and $u = 1$. In this case, there are only two distinct solutions: $u = 0$ and $u = 1$. The sketch would show two horizontal lines at $u = 0$ and $u = 1$.\n\n2. For $\\alpha = 2$, the steady-state solutions are $u = 0$, $u = 1$, and $u = 2$. The sketch would show three horizontal lines at $u = 0$, $u = 1$, and $u = 2$.\n\n3. For $\\alpha = 3$, the steady-state solutions are $u = 0$, $u = 1$, and $u = 3$. The sketch would show three horizontal lines at $u = 0$, $u = 1$, and $u = 3$.\n\nThese sketches represent the steady-state concentration profiles of the chemical species in the domain for different values of $\\alpha$."
