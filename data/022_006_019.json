    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of $|f(z)|$ on the closed disk $|z-1|\\leq 2$, we first need to find the critical points of the function. We can do this by finding the points where the derivative of the function is zero or does not exist.\n\nLet's first find the derivative of $f(z)$ with respect to $z$:\n\n$f'(z) = \\frac{d}{dz}(z^2 + 2z + 2) = 2z + 2$\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting $f'(z) = 0$:\n\n$2z + 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow z = -1$\n\nThere is only one critical point, $z = -1$. However, we also need to check the boundary of the disk, $|z-1|=2$. To do this, we can parameterize the boundary using polar coordinates:\n\n$z = 1 + 2e^{i\\theta}$, where $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$\n\nNow, let's find the values of $|f(z)|$ at the critical point and on the boundary:\n\n1. At the critical point $z = -1$:\n\n$|f(-1)| = |(-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 2| = |-1| = 1$\n\n2. On the boundary $z = 1 + 2e^{i\\theta}$:\n\n$|f(1 + 2e^{i\\theta})| = |(1 + 2e^{i\\theta})^2 + 2(1 + 2e^{i\\theta}) + 2|$\n\nTo simplify this expression, let's first find $(1 + 2e^{i\\theta})^2$:\n\n$(1 + 2e^{i\\theta})^2 = 1 + 4e^{i\\theta} + 4e^{2i\\theta}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for $|f(z)|$:\n\n$|f(1 + 2e^{i\\theta})| = |1 + 4e^{i\\theta} + 4e^{2i\\theta} + 2 + 4e^{i\\theta} + 4|$\n\n$|f(1 + 2e^{i\\theta})| = |5 + 8e^{i\\theta} + 4e^{2i\\theta}|$\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum and minimum values of this expression as $\\theta$ varies from $0$ to $2\\pi$. We can use the triangle inequality to find an upper bound:\n\n$|5 + 8e^{i\\theta} + 4e^{2i\\theta}| \\leq |5| + |8e^{i\\theta}| + |4e^{2i\\theta}| = 5 + 8 + 4 = 17$\n\nTo find the minimum value, we can use the reverse triangle inequality:\n\n$||5| - |8e^{i\\theta}| - |4e^{2i\\theta}|| \\leq |5 - 8e^{i\\theta} - 4e^{2i\\theta}|$\n\n$|5 - 8 - 4| \\leq |5 - 8e^{i\\theta} - 4e^{2i\\theta}|$\n\n$|-7| \\leq |5 - 8e^{i\\theta} - 4e^{2i\\theta}|$\n\nSo, the minimum value of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary is at least $7$. Since the value of $|f(z)|$ at the critical point is $1$, which is less than $7$, the minimum value of $|f(z)|$ on the closed disk is $1$.\n\nThe maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary is $17$. Since there are no other critical points, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on the closed disk is $17$.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum value of $|f(z)|$ on the closed disk $|z-1|\\leq 2$ is $1$ at $z = -1$, and the maximum value is $17$ on the boundary $|z-1|=2$."
