    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g. In other words, we need to find a generator for G.\n\nSince G has order 7, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide 7. The only divisors of 7 are 1 and 7. If the order of an element is 1, then it is the identity element. So, we need to find an element with order 7.\n\nLet g be an element in G with order 7. Then, the powers of g are {g^0, g^1, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6}, and g^7 = g^0 = e, where e is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's prove that the powers of g are distinct. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exist integers i and j (0 ≤ i < j ≤ 6) such that g^i = g^j. Then, g^(j-i) = e. But, since g has order 7, this is a contradiction because 1 ≤ j - i ≤ 6. Therefore, the powers of g must be distinct.\n\nSince there are 7 distinct powers of g and G has order 7, the powers of g must form the entire group G. Thus, G is cyclic, and g is a generator of G.\n\nNote that there might be more than one generator for G. To find all generators, we can check the orders of the other elements in G. If any other element has order 7, it is also a generator of G."
