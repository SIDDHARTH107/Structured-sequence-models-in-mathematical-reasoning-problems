    "message_1": "Consider a Feistel cipher with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits. If we use 16 rounds of Feistel structure with a round function that takes 48 bits as input and produces 48 bits as output, what is the total number of bits that will be generated by the encryption process?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, the block size remains the same throughout the encryption process, and the number of rounds does not affect the final output size. The block size is 64 bits, so the total number of bits generated by the encryption process will also be 64 bits."
