    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation with the given initial conditions, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let $\\Psi(z,t) = Z(z)T(t)$. Substituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 (Z(z)T(t))}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\nabla^2 (Z(z)T(t))$$\n\nDividing both sides by $Z(z)T(t)$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{\\partial^2 T(t)}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\nabla^2 Z(z)}{Z(z)}$$\n\nSince the left side is a function of $t$ only and the right side is a function of $z$ only, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{\\partial^2 T(t)}{\\partial t^2} = -\\lambda = c^2 \\frac{\\nabla^2 Z(z)}{Z(z)}$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial^2 T(t)}{\\partial t^2} = -\\lambda T(t)$\n2. $\\nabla^2 Z(z) = -\\frac{\\lambda}{c^2} Z(z)$\n\nSolving the first equation, we get:\n\n$$T(t) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}t) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}t)$$\n\nSolving the second equation, we get:\n\n$$Z(z) = C\\exp(\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\lambda}{c^2}}z) + D\\exp(-\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\lambda}{c^2}}z)$$\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions:\n\n1. $\\Psi(z,0) = Z(z)T(0) = z^2 \\implies Z(z) = z^2$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t}(z,0) = Z(z)\\frac{\\partial T(t)}{\\partial t}\\Big|_{t=0} = 3z^2 \\implies \\frac{\\partial T(t)}{\\partial t}\\Big|_{t=0} = 3$\n\nFrom the first initial condition, we have $A = 1$ and $C = 1$, $D = 0$. From the second initial condition, we have $B\\sqrt{\\lambda} = 3$. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n$$\\Psi(z,t) = z^2\\left(\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}t) + \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}t)\\right)$$\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $\\lambda$. Since the wave equation is linear, we can find a particular solution for each eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and then sum them up to get the general solution. However, in this case, we are given a specific point $z = 2 + 3i$ and we are asked to find the solution for $t > 0$. Therefore, we can plug in the value of $z$ into the solution:\n\n$$\\Psi(2+3i,t) = (2+3i)^2\\left(\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}t) + \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}t)\\right)$$\n\nSince we are not given any further information about the behavior of the solution, we cannot determine the exact value of $\\lambda$. However, the above expression gives the solution for any given $\\lambda$ and $t > 0$."
