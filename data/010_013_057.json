    "message_2": "We will prove the statement by induction on the rank $n$ of the vector bundle.\n\nBase case: $n=2$. In this case, we have $k=1$. Let $E$ be a rank $2$ vector bundle over a compact manifold $M$. By choosing a Riemannian metric on $E$, we can define a continuous function $f:E\\to\\mathbb{R}$ by $f(x)=\\|x\\|^2$, where $\\|x\\|$ is the norm of $x$ with respect to the chosen metric. Since $M$ is compact, the function $f$ attains its minimum on $M$. Let $x_0\\in M$ be a point where $f$ attains its minimum. Then, the fiber $E_{x_0}$ is a $2$-dimensional vector space, and $f$ restricted to $E_{x_0}$ is a non-negative quadratic form. Since $f(x_0)$ is the minimum of $f$, the quadratic form must be non-degenerate at $x_0$, which means that there exists a non-vanishing vector $v_0\\in E_{x_0}$. Define a section $s:M\\to E$ by $s(x)=v_0$ for all $x\\in M$. Then, $s$ is a non-vanishing section of $E$, and its zeros have codimension at least $1$.\n\nInductive step: Suppose the statement is true for vector bundles of rank $n-1$. Let $E$ be a rank $n$ vector bundle over a compact manifold $M$, and let $1\\leq k<n$. Choose a Riemannian metric on $E$, and let $f:E\\to\\mathbb{R}$ be the continuous function defined by $f(x)=\\|x\\|^2$. As in the base case, $f$ attains its minimum on $M$, and let $x_0\\in M$ be a point where $f$ attains its minimum. Then, there exists a non-vanishing vector $v_0\\in E_{x_0}$.\n\nConsider the subbundle $F\\subset E$ generated by $v_0$. Then, $F$ is a rank $1$ subbundle of $E$, and $E/F$ is a rank $n-1$ vector bundle over $M$. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a non-vanishing section $s:E/F\\to M$ whose zeros have codimension at least $k$. Let $\\pi:E\\to E/F$ be the projection map. Define a section $s':M\\to E$ by $s'(x)=\\pi^{-1}(s(x))$. Then, $s'$ is a non-vanishing section of $E$, and its zeros have codimension at least $k$.\n\nFor the example with $M=S^2$ and a rank $3$ vector bundle, we can apply the above argument with $k=2$. By the induction step, there exists a non-vanishing section of the bundle whose zeros have codimension at least $2$, which means that the zeros are isolated points."
