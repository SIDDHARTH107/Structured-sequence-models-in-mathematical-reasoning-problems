    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nA force of 20 N is applied at an angle of 60 degrees to a crate that is being pulled horizontally across the floor. The crate is initially at rest and has a mass of 5 kg. Use integration to find the work done by the force when the crate has moved a distance of 10 meters across the floor. Assume the coefficient of friction between the crate and the floor is 0.2.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we first need to find the horizontal component of the force (Fx) and the frictional force (Ff) acting on the crate.\n\n1. Find the horizontal component of the force (Fx):\nFx = F * cos(θ)\nFx = 20 N * cos(60°)\nFx = 20 N * 0.5\nFx = 10 N\n\n2. Find the normal force (Fn) acting on the crate:\nSince the crate is being pulled horizontally, the normal force is equal to the gravitational force acting on the crate.\nFn = m * g\nFn = 5 kg * 9.81 m/s²\nFn = 49.05 N\n\n3. Find the frictional force (Ff) acting on the crate:\nFf = μ * Fn\nFf = 0.2 * 49.05 N\nFf = 9.81 N\n\n4. Find the net force (Fnet) acting on the crate:\nFnet = Fx - Ff\nFnet = 10 N - 9.81 N\nFnet = 0.19 N\n\n5. Find the work done (W) by the force when the crate has moved a distance of 10 meters across the floor:\nW = Fnet * d\nW = 0.19 N * 10 m\nW = 1.9 J\n\nSo, the work done by the force when the crate has moved a distance of 10 meters across the floor is 1.9 Joules."
