    "message_2": "A quadratic residue is a number that is congruent to a perfect square modulo a given modulus. In this case, we want to find the quadratic residue of 19 modulo 23.\n\nTo find the quadratic residue, we need to find an integer x such that x^2 ≡ 19 (mod 23). We can do this by testing the squares of integers from 1 to 22 (mod 23) and checking if any of them are congruent to 19.\n\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 23)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 23)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 23)\n4^2 ≡ 16 (mod 23)\n5^2 ≡ 2 (mod 23)\n6^2 ≡ 13 (mod 23)\n7^2 ≡ 3 (mod 23)\n8^2 ≡ 18 (mod 23)\n9^2 ≡ 12 (mod 23)\n10^2 ≡ 8 (mod 23)\n11^2 ≡ 6 (mod 23)\n12^2 ≡ 9 (mod 23)\n13^2 ≡ 16 (mod 23)\n14^2 ≡ 4 (mod 23)\n15^2 ≡ 1 (mod 23)\n16^2 ≡ 18 (mod 23)\n17^2 ≡ 3 (mod 23)\n18^2 ≡ 13 (mod 23)\n19^2 ≡ 2 (mod 23)\n20^2 ≡ 12 (mod 23)\n21^2 ≡ 8 (mod 23)\n22^2 ≡ 6 (mod 23)\n\nNone of the squares of integers from 1 to 22 (mod 23) are congruent to 19. Therefore, 19 is not a quadratic residue modulo 23."
