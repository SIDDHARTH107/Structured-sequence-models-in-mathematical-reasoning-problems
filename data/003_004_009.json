    "message_2": "First, we want to isolate the sin(2x) term. To do this, subtract √3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n2 sin(2x) = -√3\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nsin(2x) = -√3/2\n\nWe want to find the angle x such that sin(2x) = -√3/2. To do this, we'll first find the angle whose sine is √3/2, and then find the angle whose sine is -√3/2.\n\nThe sine of 60 degrees (π/3 radians) is √3/2, so sin(60°) = √3/2. Since the sine function is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, we can find the angles whose sine is -√3/2 by adding 180° and 300° to 60°:\n\n180° - 60° = 120°\n360° - 60° = 300°\n\nSo, sin(120°) = -√3/2 and sin(300°) = -√3/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x such that 2x = 120° or 2x = 300°. To do this, divide both sides of each equation by 2:\n\nx = 120°/2 = 60°\nx = 300°/2 = 150°\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the given range are x = 60° and x = 150°."
