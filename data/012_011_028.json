If you remove a vertex from the graph and the graph becomes disconnected, then what is the minimum number of edges that the original graph must have contained? Also, identify the vertex that you removed as a cut vertex or not.",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given information. We have a connected undirected graph with 10 vertices and 14 edges. When we remove a vertex from the graph, it becomes disconnected. This means that the removed vertex is a cut vertex, as its removal causes the graph to become disconnected.\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum number of edges that the original graph must have contained. Since the graph is connected, it must have at least n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n = 10, so the graph must have at least 10 - 1 = 9 edges.\n\nHowever, we are given that the graph has 14 edges. So, let's analyze the effect of removing a cut vertex on the number of edges. When we remove a cut vertex, we are essentially disconnecting the graph into two or more components. The minimum number of components that can be formed after removing a cut vertex is 2.\n\nLet's assume that after removing the cut vertex, the two components have x and y vertices, where x + y = 9 (since we removed one vertex from the original 10). The minimum number of edges required to connect the vertices in each component is x-1 and y-1, respectively.\n\nThe total number of edges in the original graph is the sum of the edges in each component plus the edges connected to the cut vertex. Since the cut vertex connects the two components, it must have at least one edge connected to each component. Therefore, the total number of edges in the original graph is (x-1) + (y-1) + 2 = x + y.\n\nGiven that the original graph has 14 edges, we have:\n\n14 = x + y\n\nSince x + y = 9, we can conclude that the minimum number of edges that the original graph must have contained is 14. The removed vertex is a cut vertex, as its removal causes the graph to become disconnected."
