    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 36. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of G.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G. The order of G is 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 = 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since they are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P_2 and P_3 are coprime, their intersection is trivial, and thus G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3. Since P_2 has order 4, it is either isomorphic to C4 or C2 × C2. P_3 has order 9, so it is isomorphic to C9. Therefore, G is either isomorphic to C4 × C9 (which is C36) or C2 × C2 × C9 (which is one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36).\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there are three 2-Sylow subgroups and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since P_3 is unique, it is normal in G. Let H be a 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Then, the index of H in G is [G:H] = 9. By the normalizer-centralizer theorem, we have |N_G(H)/C_G(H)| = [G:C_G(H)] = 9. Since |N_G(H)| divides 36, we have |C_G(H)| = 4. Thus, the centralizer of H in G has order 4, and it must contain H. Since H is not normal in G, we have C_G(H) = H. Now, G acts on the set of 2-Sylow subgroups by conjugation, and this action induces a homomorphism from G to S_3. The kernel of this homomorphism is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in H, which is C_G(H) = H. Thus, G/H is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_3. Since |G/H| = 9, G/H is isomorphic to C3. Therefore, G is a semidirect product of H and P_3, which is one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, and G will be one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are three 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups. Since neither of the Sylow subgroups are normal in G, G cannot be a direct or semidirect product of its Sylow subgroups. However, G can be a non-split extension of one of its Sylow subgroups by the other. In this case, G is isomorphic to A4 × C3.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 36 can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36."
