    "message_2": "A group of order 77 has a prime factorization of 77 = 7 * 11, where 7 and 11 are distinct prime numbers. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any group of order 77 must be isomorphic to one of the following structures:\n\n1. A cyclic group of order 77, denoted as Z_77.\n2. A direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11, denoted as Z_7 × Z_11.\n\nNow, let's determine which of these structures are isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11.\n\n1. The cyclic group Z_77 is not isomorphic to Z_7 × Z_11 because it has a single generator that generates all 77 elements, while Z_7 × Z_11 has two generators, one for each cyclic group.\n\n2. The direct product Z_7 × Z_11 is isomorphic to itself, as it is already the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11.\n\nThus, the only structure of a group of order 77 that is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11 is Z_7 × Z_11."
