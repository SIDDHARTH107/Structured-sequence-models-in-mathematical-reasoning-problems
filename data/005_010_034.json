    "message_1": "A company produces light bulbs and claims that its bulbs have a lifespan of at least 1000 hours. You randomly select 20 bulbs from the company’s production line and test their lifespan. The lifespans of the bulbs are normally distributed with a mean of 1050 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours. Using Bayesian statistics, calculate the probability that the company's claim is true.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Bayesian statistics, we need to define our prior beliefs about the company's claim and update them based on the data we have collected. We will use the normal distribution as our prior and likelihood functions.\n\n1. Define the prior distribution: \nWe will use a normal distribution as our prior belief about the company's claim. Since the company claims that the bulbs have a lifespan of at least 1000 hours, we can set the mean of our prior distribution to 1000 hours. To represent our uncertainty about the true mean, we will use a standard deviation of 100 hours. So, our prior distribution is N(1000, 100^2).\n\n2. Define the likelihood function:\nThe likelihood function represents the probability of observing the data given the true mean lifespan of the bulbs. In this case, we have collected data on 20 bulbs with a sample mean of 1050 hours and a sample standard deviation of 100 hours. The likelihood function is also a normal distribution with a mean equal to the true mean lifespan and a standard deviation equal to the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. So, the likelihood function is N(μ, (100/sqrt(20))^2).\n\n3. Calculate the posterior distribution:\nTo update our prior beliefs based on the data, we need to calculate the posterior distribution, which is proportional to the product of the prior distribution and the likelihood function. In the case of normal distributions, the posterior distribution is also a normal distribution. The mean and variance of the posterior distribution can be calculated using the following formulas:\n\nPosterior mean = (Prior mean * Likelihood variance + Sample mean * Prior variance) / (Prior variance + Likelihood variance)\nPosterior variance = (Prior variance * Likelihood variance) / (Prior variance + Likelihood variance)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nPosterior mean = (1000 * (100/sqrt(20))^2 + 1050 * 100^2) / (100^2 + (100/sqrt(20))^2)\nPosterior mean = (1000 * 500 + 1050 * 10000) / (10000 + 500)\nPosterior mean = (500000 + 10500000) / 10500\nPosterior mean = 10650000 / 10500\nPosterior mean ≈ 1014.29 hours\n\nPosterior variance = (100^2 * (100/sqrt(20))^2) / (100^2 + (100/sqrt(20))^2)\nPosterior variance = (10000 * 500) / (10000 + 500)\nPosterior variance = 5000000 / 10500\nPosterior variance ≈ 476.19\n\nSo, the posterior distribution is N(1014.29, 476.19).\n\n4. Calculate the probability that the company's claim is true:\nNow that we have the posterior distribution, we can calculate the probability that the true mean lifespan of the bulbs is at least 1000 hours. This is equivalent to finding the probability that a value from the posterior distribution is greater than or equal to 1000. We can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution to find this probability:\n\nP(μ ≥ 1000) = 1 - P(μ < 1000)\nP(μ ≥ 1000) = 1 - CDF(1000, 1014.29, sqrt(476.19))\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find:\n\nP(μ ≥ 1000) = 1 - CDF(1000, 1014.29, sqrt(476.19))\nP(μ ≥ 1000) ≈ 1 - 0.1841\nP(μ ≥ 1000) ≈ 0.8159\n\nSo, based on our Bayesian analysis, there is approximately an 81.59% probability that the company's claim of a lifespan of at least 1000 hours is true."
