    "message_2": "To determine the treewidth of the given graph, we need to find a tree decomposition of the graph with the smallest possible width. The width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus one. \n\nA possible tree decomposition for the given graph is:\n\nBag 1: {1, 2}\nBag 2: {2, 3, 4}\nBag 3: {3, 4}\nBag 4: {4, 5, 6}\nBag 5: {5, 6}\n\nThe tree decomposition can be visualized as follows:\n\nBag 1 -- Bag 2 -- Bag 3 -- Bag 4 -- Bag 5\n\nThe largest bag in this tree decomposition has 3 vertices, so the width of the tree decomposition is 3 - 1 = 2. Therefore, the treewidth of the given graph is 2."
