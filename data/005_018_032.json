    "message_1": "A pharmaceutical company is testing a drug for reducing the risk of heart attacks. They conducted a survival analysis study on 500 patients with a history of heart disease, and found that the median time to a heart attack for patients on the drug was 3.5 years with a standard deviation of 1.2 years. For patients not on the drug, the median time to a heart attack was 2.8 years with a standard deviation of 1.1 years. If the company wants to claim that the drug significantly increases the time to a heart attack compared to not taking the drug, what statistical test could they use and what would be the result of that test at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To compare the median time to a heart attack between the two groups (patients on the drug and patients not on the drug), the pharmaceutical company can use the Mann-Whitney U test (also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test). This is a non-parametric test that compares the distribution of two independent samples and is appropriate for comparing median values.\n\nTo perform the Mann-Whitney U test, we need the sample sizes and the median values for both groups. We are given the following information:\n\n- Patients on the drug (Group 1): n1 = 500, median1 = 3.5 years, standard deviation1 = 1.2 years\n- Patients not on the drug (Group 2): n2 = 500, median2 = 2.8 years, standard deviation2 = 1.1 years\n\nHowever, we do not have the actual data points or the rank-sums for both groups, so we cannot directly calculate the U statistic and its corresponding p-value. In a real-world scenario, the pharmaceutical company would have access to the individual patient data and could perform the Mann-Whitney U test using statistical software.\n\nAssuming the company performs the test and obtains a p-value, they would compare it to the significance level of 0.05. If the p-value is less than 0.05, they can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the median time to a heart attack between patients on the drug and patients not on the drug. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, they cannot reject the null hypothesis and cannot claim that the drug significantly increases the time to a heart attack compared to not taking the drug."
