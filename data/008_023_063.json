Find the solution (x, y, z) to this system of equations using a least-squares method.",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the least-squares method, we first rewrite the system in matrix form:\n\nA * X = B + E\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), B is the column vector of constants, and E is the column vector of errors (e1, e2, e3).\n\nA = | 2.5  4.3 -1.8 |\n    | 3.7 -9.1  2.2 |\n    | 6.4  1.9 -3.3 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  5.5  |\n    | -7.8  |\n    |  3.2  |\n\nE = | e1 |\n    | e2 |\n    | e3 |\n\nThe least-squares solution minimizes the sum of the squares of the errors. To find this solution, we can use the normal equations:\n\nA^T * A * X = A^T * B\n\nFirst, we compute the transpose of A (A^T) and the product A^T * A:\n\nA^T = |  2.5  3.7  6.4 |\n      |  4.3 -9.1  1.9 |\n      | -1.8  2.2 -3.3 |\n\nA^T * A = |  56.74  -15.34  -6.56 |\n          | -15.34  102.51 -22.87 |\n          |  -6.56  -22.87  19.13 |\n\nNext, we compute the product A^T * B:\n\nA^T * B = |  12.35 |\n          | -75.61 |\n          |  13.69 |\n\nNow, we can solve the system of linear equations (A^T * A) * X = A^T * B for X using any standard method, such as Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion. The solution is:\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\n  = |  0.548 |\n    |  0.759 |\n    |  1.230 |\n\nSo, the least-squares solution to the system of linear equations with noisy data is approximately:\n\nx ≈ 0.548\ny ≈ 0.759\nz ≈ 1.230"
