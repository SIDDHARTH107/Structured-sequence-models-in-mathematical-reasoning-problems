    "message_2": "To determine whether 16 is a quadratic residue modulo 19, we need to find if there exists an integer x such that x^2 ≡ 16 (mod 19).\n\nWe can test the squares of the integers from 1 to 9 (half of 19, since after that, the residues will repeat) and check if any of them are congruent to 16 modulo 19.\n\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 19)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 19)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 19)\n4^2 ≡ 16 (mod 19)\n\nWe found that 4^2 ≡ 16 (mod 19), so 16 is a quadratic residue modulo 19."
