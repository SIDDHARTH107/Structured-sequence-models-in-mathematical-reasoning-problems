    "message_2": "To find the volume of the spherical shell, we need to subtract the volume of the smaller sphere from the volume of the larger sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the larger sphere (radius 5 cm):\nV1 = (4/3)π(5^3) = (4/3)π(125) = 500π/3 cm³\n\nNext, let's find the volume of the smaller sphere (radius 3 cm):\nV2 = (4/3)π(3^3) = (4/3)π(27) = 108π/3 cm³\n\nNow, subtract the volume of the smaller sphere from the volume of the larger sphere to find the volume of the spherical shell:\nV_shell = V1 - V2 = (500π/3) - (108π/3) = 392π/3 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the spherical shell is 392π/3 cm³."
