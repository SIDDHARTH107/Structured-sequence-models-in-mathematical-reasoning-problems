    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game with five players, each player can choose to contribute either 0 or 1 to a shared pool. The total amount in the shared pool is then multiplied by a factor of 1.5 and divided equally among all players, regardless of whether or not they contributed. If all five players contribute, they each receive 1.5 times their contribution. However, if one or more players choose not to contribute, they still receive the same dividend payout as those who did contribute. \n\nIf Player A contributes 1 and the other four players contribute 0, what is the total payout that Player A receives after the dividend is distributed?",
