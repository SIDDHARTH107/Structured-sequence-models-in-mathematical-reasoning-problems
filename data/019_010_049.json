    "message_1": "A logical formula Ï† consists of the following literals: A, B, C, D, and E. Each literal denotes a real number, and its truth value is its sign (positive if greater than zero, negative if lesser). Use linear logic to prove that if A + B > 0, C + D > 0, and B + D + E > 0, then A + C + E > 0. Find a numerical example that satisfies the hypotheses of the statement, yet violates its conclusion.",
    "message_2": "To prove that if A + B > 0, C + D > 0, and B + D + E > 0, then A + C + E > 0, we can use linear logic as follows:\n\n1. A + B > 0 (given)\n2. C + D > 0 (given)\n3. B + D + E > 0 (given)\n\nNow, we can add equations (1) and (2):\n\n4. (A + B) + (C + D) > 0 + 0\n5. A + B + C + D > 0\n\nNext, we can subtract equation (3) from equation (5):\n\n6. (A + B + C + D) - (B + D + E) > 0 - 0\n7. A + C + E > 0\n\nThus, we have proven that if A + B > 0, C + D > 0, and B + D + E > 0, then A + C + E > 0 using linear logic.\n\nHowever, it is impossible to find a numerical example that satisfies the hypotheses of the statement and violates its conclusion, because the proof we just derived shows that the conclusion must always be true if the hypotheses are true."
