    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that is generated by iteratively replacing each segment of an initial equilateral triangle with a series of four segments. The length of each new segment is 1/sqrt(7) times the length of the previous segment.\n\nLet's denote the length of the initial segment as L0 = 1. After the first iteration, each segment is replaced by four segments, each of length L1 = L0/sqrt(7). The total length of the curve after the first iteration is 4 * L1.\n\nAfter the second iteration, each of the four segments is replaced by four new segments, each of length L2 = L1/sqrt(7). The total length of the curve after the second iteration is 4^2 * L2.\n\nIn general, after n iterations, the total length of the curve is given by:\n\nLength_n = 4^n * L0 / (sqrt(7))^n\n\nWe want to find the total length of the curve after 5 iterations:\n\nLength_5 = 4^5 * L0 / (sqrt(7))^5\nLength_5 = 1024 * 1 / (7^(5/2))\nLength_5 ≈ 1024 / 168.17928388271\nLength_5 ≈ 6.086410732\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve after 5 iterations is approximately 6.086410732."
