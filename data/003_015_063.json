    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the sinusoidal function y = 5sin(4x - π/3), we need to analyze the equation and compare it to the general form of a sinusoidal function, which is y = A*sin(B(x - C)).\n\nIn this general form, A represents the amplitude, B determines the period, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our given function, y = 5sin(4x - π/3), we can see that:\n\nA = 5, which means the amplitude is 5.\n\nB = 4, which affects the period. The period of a sinusoidal function is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |B|\n\nSo in our case, the period is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |4| = (2π) / 4 = π/2\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the function is 5, and the period is π/2."
