    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the given matrix A.\n\nMatrix A:\n[[3, 1],\n [0, 2]]\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\n(A - λI) = [[3 - λ, 1],\n             [0, 2 - λ]]\n\ndet(A - λI) = (3 - λ)(2 - λ) - (1)(0) = λ^2 - 5λ + 6\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the equation λ^2 - 5λ + 6 = 0.\n\n(λ - 3)(λ - 2) = 0\n\nEigenvalues (λ): λ1 = 3, λ2 = 2\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors:\nFor each eigenvalue, we need to find the eigenvectors by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v represents the eigenvectors.\n\nFor λ1 = 3:\n\n(A - λ1I) = [[0, 1],\n             [0, -1]]\n\nRow reduce to echelon form:\n\n[[0, 1],\n [0, 0]]\n\nFrom the row-reduced matrix, we can write the equation:\n\nv2 = 0\n\nLet v1 = 1, then the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 = 3 is:\n\nv1 = [1, 0]\n\nFor λ2 = 2:\n\n(A - λ2I) = [[1, 1],\n             [0, 0]]\n\nRow reduce to echelon form:\n\n[[1, 1],\n [0, 0]]\n\nFrom the row-reduced matrix, we can write the equation:\n\nv1 + v2 = 0\n\nLet v2 = 1, then the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 = 2 is:\n\nv2 = [-1, 1]\n\n3. Form the matrices P and D:\nNow that we have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can form the matrices P and D.\n\nMatrix P is formed by placing the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = [[1, -1],\n     [0,  1]]\n\nMatrix D is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues on the diagonal:\n\nD = [[3, 0],\n     [0, 2]]\n\n4. Verify P^(-1)AP = D:\nTo verify that P^(-1)AP = D, we need to find the inverse of matrix P (P^(-1)) and then compute the product P^(-1)AP.\n\nFirst, find the inverse of P:\n\nP = [[1, -1],\n     [0,  1]]\n\nSince P is a 2x2 matrix, we can use the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix:\n\nP^(-1) = (1/det(P)) * adj(P)\n\ndet(P) = (1)(1) - (0)(-1) = 1\n\nadj(P) = [[1, 1],\n          [0, 1]]\n\nP^(-1) = [[1, 1],\n          [0, 1]]\n\nNow, compute the product P^(-1)AP:\n\nP^(-1)AP = [[1, 1], [0, 1]] * [[3, 1], [0, 2]] * [[1, -1], [0, 1]]\n         = [[1, 1], [0, 1]] * [[3, -2], [0, 3]]\n         = [[3, 1], [0, 2]]\n\nSince P^(-1)AP = D, we have found the correct diagonal matrix D and invertible matrix P:\n\nD = [[3, 0],\n     [0, 2]]\n\nP = [[1, -1],\n     [0,  1]]"
