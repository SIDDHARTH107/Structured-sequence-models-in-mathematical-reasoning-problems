    "message_2": "To find the optimal control function $u(t)$ that minimizes the cost function $J[u]$, we can use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, we define the Hamiltonian function $H$ as follows:\n\n$$H(x_1, x_2, u, p_1, p_2) = 2x_1^2 + 3x_2^2 + u^2 + p_1x_2 + p_2u$$\n\nwhere $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the costate variables. According to the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the optimal control function $u^*(t)$ should satisfy:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial u} = 0$$\n\nTaking the partial derivative of $H$ with respect to $u$, we get:\n\n$$2u + p_2 = 0$$\n\nSolving for $u$, we obtain the optimal control function:\n\n$$u^*(t) = -\\frac{1}{2}p_2(t)$$\n\nNow, we need to find the costate equations. The costate equations are given by:\n\n$$-\\frac{dp_1}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x_1}$$\n$$-\\frac{dp_2}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x_2}$$\n\nTaking the partial derivatives of $H$ with respect to $x_1$ and $x_2$, we get:\n\n$$-\\frac{dp_1}{dt} = 4x_1$$\n$$-\\frac{dp_2}{dt} = 6x_2 + p_1$$\n\nNow, we have a system of four first-order differential equations:\n\n$$x_1' = x_2$$\n$$x_2' = -\\frac{1}{2}p_2$$\n$$p_1' = -4x_1$$\n$$p_2' = -6x_2 - p_1$$\n\nwith initial conditions $x_1(0) = 1$, $x_2(0) = 0$, and boundary conditions for the costate variables $p_1(2)$ and $p_2(2)$.\n\nTo solve this system of differential equations, we can use numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method or other suitable techniques. Once we obtain the numerical solutions for $x_1(t)$, $x_2(t)$, $p_1(t)$, and $p_2(t)$, we can find the optimal control function $u^*(t)$ using the expression:\n\n$$u^*(t) = -\\frac{1}{2}p_2(t)$$"
