    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 20. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) is denoted by n_5 and must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_5 divides the index of the Sylow 5-subgroup, which is 20/5 = 4.\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nThe only divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4. The only one of these that satisfies the second condition is n_5 = 1. Therefore, G has exactly one subgroup of order 5, which is normal in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of G. Since G has order 20, it must be isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. Z_20 (cyclic group of order 20)\n2. Z_4 x Z_5 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 4 and 5)\n3. D_20 (dihedral group of order 20)\n\nTo determine which of these groups G is isomorphic to, we can analyze their Sylow 5-subgroups:\n\n1. In Z_20, the unique Sylow 5-subgroup is generated by the element 4, which has order 5.\n2. In Z_4 x Z_5, the unique Sylow 5-subgroup is generated by the element (0, 1), which has order 5.\n3. In D_20, the unique Sylow 5-subgroup is generated by the rotation element r^4, which has order 5.\n\nIn each of these cases, there is exactly one subgroup of order 5, which is consistent with the Sylow theorems. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to one of these three groups: Z_20, Z_4 x Z_5, or D_20."
