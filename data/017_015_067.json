    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 24: 24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups: There are 2 possible abelian groups of order 24: Z_24 and Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_6.\n3. Determine the number of possible non-abelian groups: We can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups and their normality.\n\n- Sylow 2-subgroups: There are either 1 or 3 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8. If there is only 1, it is normal, and we have a semi-direct product. If there are 3, none of them are normal.\n- Sylow 3-subgroups: There is only 1 Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, which is normal.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible non-abelian groups:\n\nA. If there is only 1 Sylow 2-subgroup (normal), we have a semi-direct product of the normal Sylow 2-subgroup with the Sylow 3-subgroup. There are 3 possible semi-direct products in this case: Z_3 acts non-trivially on Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2, Z_3 acts non-trivially on Z_2 x Z_4, and Z_3 acts trivially on Z_2 x Z_4. These give us 3 non-abelian groups: the dihedral group D_12, the special linear group SL(2,3), and the direct product Z_3 x (Z_2 x Z_4).\n\nB. If there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, none of them are normal, and we cannot form a semi-direct product. However, we can still have a non-abelian group in this case: the symmetric group S_4.\n\nIn total, there are 2 abelian groups and 4 non-abelian groups, giving us 6 non-isomorphic groups of order 24."
