    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral $\\int_\\gamma \\cos(z)dz$ where $\\gamma$ is the circle $|z-2|=3$ traversed once counterclockwise, we can use the Cauchy integral formula. The Cauchy integral formula states that for a function $f(z)$ that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour $C$, and for any point $a$ inside $C$:\n\n$$f(a) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_C \\frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz$$\n\nIn this case, $f(z) = \\cos(z)$, which is an entire function (analytic everywhere). Since the contour $\\gamma$ is a circle centered at $2$ with radius $3$, there are no singularities of $\\cos(z)$ inside or on the contour. Therefore, the integral $\\int_\\gamma \\cos(z)dz$ is equal to $0$.\n\nSo, the integral $\\int_\\gamma \\cos(z)dz = 0$."
