    "message_1": "A particular heat equation is given by: \n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} - 4\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0$\n\nwith initial condition $u(x,0) = x^2 + 1$ and boundary condition $u(0,t) = u(\\pi,t) = 0$ for all $t\\geq 0$. \n\nUse Fourier transform to find the solution $u(x,t)$.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation using Fourier series, we first need to find the Fourier series representation of the initial condition $u(x, 0) = x^2 + 1$. Since the boundary conditions are homogeneous (i.e., $u(0, t) = u(\\pi, t) = 0$), we can use the sine Fourier series:\n\n$$u(x, 0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin(nx)$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$B_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} (x^2 + 1) \\sin(nx) dx$$\n\nTo find $B_n$, we can integrate by parts twice:\n\n$$B_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{-1}{n}(x^2 + 1)\\cos(nx) \\Big|_0^\\pi + \\frac{2}{n} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} x\\cos(nx) dx \\right]$$\n\nThe first term evaluates to zero since $\\cos(n\\pi) = (-1)^n$ and $\\cos(0) = 1$. Now, we integrate by parts again:\n\n$$B_n = \\frac{4}{\\pi n} \\left[ \\frac{1}{n} x\\sin(nx) \\Big|_0^\\pi - \\frac{1}{n} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin(nx) dx \\right]$$\n\nThe first term evaluates to zero since $\\sin(n\\pi) = 0$ and $\\sin(0) = 0$. The second term can be integrated directly:\n\n$$B_n = \\frac{4}{\\pi n^2} \\left[ \\frac{-1}{n} \\cos(nx) \\Big|_0^\\pi \\right] = \\frac{4}{n^3\\pi}((-1)^n - 1)$$\n\nNow we have the Fourier series representation of the initial condition:\n\n$$u(x, 0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{4}{n^3\\pi}((-1)^n - 1) \\sin(nx)$$\n\nNext, we find the solution of the heat equation by multiplying each term of the Fourier series by $e^{-4n^2t}$:\n\n$$u(x, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{4}{n^3\\pi}((-1)^n - 1) e^{-4n^2t} \\sin(nx)$$\n\nThis is the solution of the given heat equation with the specified initial and boundary conditions."
