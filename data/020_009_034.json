Assume that the cost of capital is $r = 0.05$ and the wage rate is $w = 10$. Also, assume that the demand for the company's product is given by $P = 200 - Q$, where $Q = f(K,L)$ is the quantity produced by the company. \n\nWhat levels of capital and labor should the company use to minimize production costs while producing a given quantity $Q = 1000$ units?",
    "message_2": "To minimize production costs, the company should find the optimal combination of capital (K) and labor (L) that satisfies the production function and the given quantity constraint. We are given the production function:\n\n$$f(K, L) = K^{0.4} \\cdot L^{0.6}$$\n\nWe are also given the cost of capital (r) and the wage rate (w):\n\n$$r = 0.05$$\n$$w = 10$$\n\nThe company's total cost (TC) can be expressed as:\n\n$$TC = rK + wL$$\n\nWe are given the constraint that the quantity produced (Q) must be 1000 units:\n\n$$Q = f(K, L) = 1000$$\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal combination of K and L that minimizes the total cost while satisfying the production constraint. To do this, we can use the Lagrange multiplier method. We will set up the Lagrangian function as follows:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(K, L, \\lambda) = rK + wL + \\lambda (1000 - K^{0.4} \\cdot L^{0.6})$$\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian function with respect to K, L, and Î» and set them equal to zero:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial K} = r - 0.4\\lambda K^{-0.6}L^{0.6} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial L} = w - 0.6\\lambda K^{0.4}L^{-0.4} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = 1000 - K^{0.4} \\cdot L^{0.6} = 0$$\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations to find the optimal values of K and L. First, we can divide the first equation by the second equation:\n\n$$\\frac{r}{w} = \\frac{0.4\\lambda K^{-0.6}L^{0.6}}{0.6\\lambda K^{0.4}L^{-0.4}}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{0.05}{10} = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{K^{-1}}{L}$$\n\nNow, we can solve for the ratio of K to L:\n\n$$\\frac{K}{L} = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{10}{0.05} = \\frac{20}{3}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this ratio back into the production constraint:\n\n$$1000 = \\left(\\frac{20}{3}L\\right)^{0.4} \\cdot L^{0.6}$$\n\nSolving for L, we get:\n\n$$L \\approx 37.74$$\n\nNow, we can find the optimal value of K using the ratio:\n\n$$K = \\frac{20}{3}L \\approx 251.64$$\n\nThus, the company should use approximately 251.64 units of capital and 37.74 units of labor to minimize production costs while producing 1000 units."
