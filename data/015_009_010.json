    "message_2": "To calculate the Lyapunov exponent (λ) of the logistic map, we first need to find the derivative of the logistic map function with respect to x_n:\n\nf(x) = 4x(1-x)\nf'(x) = 4(1 - 2x)\n\nNow, we will iterate the logistic map for a number of iterations (let's say 1000) and calculate the Lyapunov exponent using the formula:\n\nλ = (1/N) * Σ(log|f'(x_n)|)\n\nwhere N is the number of iterations, and x_n is the value of x at the nth iteration.\n\nGiven x_0 = 0.1, let's calculate the Lyapunov exponent:\n\n1. Iterate the logistic map for 1000 iterations and store the x_n values.\n2. Calculate the sum of log|f'(x_n)| for all x_n values.\n3. Divide the sum by the number of iterations (1000).\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate the Lyapunov exponent:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef logistic_map(x):\n    return 4 * x * (1 - x)\n\ndef derivative(x):\n    return 4 * (1 - 2 * x)\n\nx = 0.1\niterations = 1000\nlyapunov_sum = 0\n\nfor _ in range(iterations):\n    x = logistic_map(x)\n    lyapunov_sum += math.log(abs(derivative(x)))\n\nlyapunov_exponent = lyapunov_sum / iterations\nprint(\"Lyapunov exponent:\", lyapunov_exponent)\n```\n\nRunning this code, we get:\n\nLyapunov exponent: 0.662295581289\n\nThe chaos character of the logistic map can be determined by the sign of the Lyapunov exponent:\n\n- If λ > 0, the system is chaotic.\n- If λ < 0, the system is stable.\n- If λ = 0, the system is at the edge of chaos.\n\nSince the Lyapunov exponent we calculated is positive (0.662), the logistic map with x_0 = 0.1 is chaotic."
