    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to remove enough edges such that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph G with 10 vertices and 18 edges. To find the edge connectivity, we can use the following theorem:\n\nMenger's Theorem: The edge connectivity of a graph G is equal to the minimum number of edges in a cut-set of G.\n\nA cut-set is a set of edges that, when removed, disconnects the graph. To find the minimum number of edges in a cut-set, we can look for the vertex with the smallest degree (i.e., the vertex connected to the fewest edges).\n\nLet's assume that the graph G is connected. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is a tree with 9 edges (since a tree has n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices). In this case, removing a single edge would disconnect the graph. However, G has 18 edges, which means there are 9 additional edges beyond the tree structure.\n\nThese additional edges create cycles in the graph, which means that there must be at least one vertex with a degree of at least 3 (since a cycle requires at least 3 vertices). Therefore, the minimum number of edges in a cut-set is 3, as removing all the edges connected to that vertex would disconnect the graph.\n\nSo, the edge connectivity of the graph G is 3, and the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph is also 3."
