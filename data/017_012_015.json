    "message_2": "To find all possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 16, we will use the Sylow theorems and consider the possible structures of the groups. Since 16 = 2^4, we know that any group of order 16 must have a 2-Sylow subgroup.\n\nLet G be a group of order 16. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_2, must satisfy n_2 â‰¡ 1 (mod 2) and n_2 divides 16. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 2. However, since G has order 16, there must be at least one 2-Sylow subgroup, so n_2 = 1. This means that G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup, which we will denote by P.\n\nSince P is the unique 2-Sylow subgroup of G, it must be normal in G. Now, we will consider the possible structures of P. Since P has order 16, it must be a p-group, and its structure can be determined by its exponent and nilpotency class.\n\n1. Exponent 16: In this case, P is isomorphic to Z_16, the cyclic group of order 16. Since P is normal in G and G has order 16, G must be isomorphic to P, so G is isomorphic to Z_16.\n\n2. Exponent 8: In this case, P is isomorphic to Z_8 x Z_2, the direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2. Since P is normal in G and G has order 16, G must be isomorphic to P, so G is isomorphic to Z_8 x Z_2.\n\n3. Exponent 4: In this case, there are two possibilities for the structure of P: Z_4 x Z_4 and Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2. \n\n   a) If P is isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_4, then G must be isomorphic to P, so G is isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_4.\n\n   b) If P is isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2, then G must be isomorphic to P, so G is isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2.\n\n4. Exponent 2: In this case, P is isomorphic to Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2. Since P is normal in G and G has order 16, G must be isomorphic to P, so G is isomorphic to Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2.\n\nThus, there are five possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 16: Z_16, Z_8 x Z_2, Z_4 x Z_4, Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_2, and Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2. Every group of order 16 must be isomorphic to one of these classes, as we have exhausted all possible structures for the unique 2-Sylow subgroup."
