    "message_2": "First, let's find all the points on the elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 over the finite field F13.\n\nWe can do this by iterating through all possible x values (0 to 12) and checking if there is a corresponding y value that satisfies the equation.\n\nPoints on the curve E:\n(0, 2), (0, 11), (1, 5), (1, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 10), (4, 1), (4, 12), (5, 5), (5, 8), (6, 0), (7, 2), (7, 11), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 12), (10, 3), (10, 10), (11, 4), (11, 9), (12, 4), (12, 9)\n\nNow, we need to find the points P such that 2P = (2, 7). To do this, we can use the point doubling formula for elliptic curves:\n\nIf P = (x1, y1), then 2P = (x2, y2), where\nx2 = (3x1^2 + a) * (2y1)^(-1) - 2x1 (mod p)\ny2 = (3x1^2 + a) * (x1 - x2) - y1 (mod p)\n\nIn our case, a = 5, p = 13, and (x2, y2) = (2, 7).\n\nWe can iterate through all the points on the curve and check if they satisfy the equation 2P = (2, 7).\n\nAfter checking all the points, we find that the points P = (3, 3) and P = (3, 10) satisfy the equation 2P = (2, 7).\n\nSo the points on the curve that satisfy the equation 2P = (2, 7) are (3, 3) and (3, 10)."
