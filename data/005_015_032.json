    "message_2": "To perform a cluster analysis, we will use the k-means clustering algorithm. In this case, we want to divide the students into three clusters (k=3). Since we don't have the complete dataset, I will explain the steps to perform the clustering, and you can apply them to your data.\n\n1. Initialize the centroids: Randomly select three students' scores as the initial centroids of the three clusters. For example, let's say we choose students 1, 2, and 50 as the initial centroids.\n\n   Centroid 1: (80, 75)\n   Centroid 2: (60, 70)\n   Centroid 3: (90, 85)\n\n2. Assign each student to the nearest centroid: Calculate the Euclidean distance between each student's scores and the centroids. Assign each student to the centroid with the smallest distance. The Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by:\n\n   distance = sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)\n\n3. Update the centroids: For each cluster, calculate the mean of the scores of all students in that cluster. This mean will be the new centroid for that cluster.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence: Continue assigning students to the nearest centroid and updating the centroids until the centroids do not change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\n5. The final centroids represent the center of each cluster, and the students assigned to each centroid form the three clusters with similar scores in both tests.\n\nNote that the k-means algorithm is sensitive to the initial choice of centroids, so you may want to run the algorithm multiple times with different initial centroids to find the best clustering. Additionally, you can use techniques like the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters if you're unsure about the number of clusters to use."
