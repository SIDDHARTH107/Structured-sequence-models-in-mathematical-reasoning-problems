    "message_1": "A finance analyst wants to analyze the fluctuation of stock prices for a particular company over a year. The daily stock price data is available in a CSV file. The analyst wants to apply the Fourier transform to this data to identify dominant frequencies of price movements. \n\nWrite a Python program that reads the CSV file, applies the Fourier transform to the data, and outputs the top 3 dominant frequencies (in Hz) along with their corresponding amplitudes.",
    "message_2": "To achieve this, you can use the `pandas` library to read the CSV file and the `numpy` library to apply the Fourier transform. Here's a Python program that demonstrates how to do this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef read_csv_file(file_path):\n    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n    return df['price'].values\n\ndef apply_fourier_transform(data):\n    n = len(data)\n    fft_data = np.fft.fft(data)\n    frequencies = np.fft.fftfreq(n)\n    return frequencies, fft_data\n\ndef find_top_frequencies(frequencies, fft_data, n_top=3):\n    sorted_indices = np.argsort(np.abs(fft_data))[-n_top:]\n    top_frequencies = frequencies[sorted_indices]\n    top_amplitudes = np.abs(fft_data[sorted_indices])\n    return top_frequencies, top_amplitudes\n\ndef main():\n    file_path = 'stock_prices.csv'  # Replace with the path to your CSV file\n    data = read_csv_file(file_path)\n    frequencies, fft_data = apply_fourier_transform(data)\n    top_frequencies, top_amplitudes = find_top_frequencies(frequencies, fft_data)\n\n    print(\"Top 3 Dominant Frequencies (in Hz) and Their Amplitudes:\")\n    for freq, amp in zip(top_frequencies, top_amplitudes):\n        print(f\"Frequency: {freq:.4f} Hz, Amplitude: {amp:.4f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nReplace `'stock_prices.csv'` with the path to your CSV file. This program assumes that the CSV file has a column named \"price\" containing the daily stock prices. The program reads the CSV file, applies the Fourier transform to the data, and outputs the top 3 dominant frequencies (in Hz) along with their corresponding amplitudes."
