    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 30 people attend a party on a Friday night, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, people attending the party) out of n trials (the total number of people in the community)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a person attending the party, which is 20% or 0.2)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the total number of people in the community, which is 150)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of people attending the party)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 30 people attending the party, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 30, 31, 32, ..., 150.\n\nP(X ≥ 30) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 30 to 150\n\nHowever, calculating this directly would be quite tedious. Instead, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nP(X ≥ 30) = 1 - P(X < 30)\n\nNow, we only need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 29.\n\nP(X ≥ 30) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 29\n\nCalculating this sum:\n\nP(X ≥ 30) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 29)]\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula for each term and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 30) ≈ 1 - 0.0016 = 0.9984\n\nSo, the probability that there will be at least 30 people attending a party on a Friday night in this community is approximately 99.84%."
