    "message_2": "To find the value of x in degrees when cos(x) = 0.5, we can use the inverse cosine function, also known as arccos or cos^(-1).\n\nx = arccos(0.5)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nx ≈ 60°\n\nHowever, cosine is also positive in the fourth quadrant, so there's another solution:\n\nx = 360° - 60° = 300°\n\nSo, the two possible values of x in degrees are 60° and 300°."
