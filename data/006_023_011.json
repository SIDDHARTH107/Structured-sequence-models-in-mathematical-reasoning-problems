    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces and sells shirts in four different colors. The probability of a customer purchasing a red, blue, green or yellow shirt is 0.35, 0.25, 0.15 and 0.25 respectively. If the company expects to sell 500 shirts, how many of each color should they produce to meet the expected demand?",
    "message_2": "To find out how many shirts of each color the company should produce, we can multiply the probability of each color by the total number of shirts expected to be sold.\n\nRed shirts:\n0.35 (probability) * 500 (total shirts) = 175 red shirts\n\nBlue shirts:\n0.25 (probability) * 500 (total shirts) = 125 blue shirts\n\nGreen shirts:\n0.15 (probability) * 500 (total shirts) = 75 green shirts\n\nYellow shirts:\n0.25 (probability) * 500 (total shirts) = 125 yellow shirts\n\nSo, the company should produce 175 red shirts, 125 blue shirts, 75 green shirts, and 125 yellow shirts to meet the expected demand."
