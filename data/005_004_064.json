Group 1 was treated with Fertilizer A, Group 2 was treated with Fertilizer B, Group 3 was treated with Fertilizer C, and Group 4 was left untreated as a control group. After 6 weeks, the heights of the plants were measured and recorded. The results are as follows: \n\nGroup 1 (Fertilizer A): mean = 11.2 inches, variance = 0.98 \nGroup 2 (Fertilizer B): mean = 12.3 inches, variance = 1.03 \nGroup 3 (Fertilizer C): mean = 10.5 inches, variance = 0.95 \nGroup 4 (Control): mean = 8.6 inches, variance = 0.99 \n\nUsing ANOVA and a significance level of 0.05, can we conclude that there is a significant difference in plant growth between the groups treated with different fertilizers and the control group?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in plant growth between the groups treated with different fertilizers and the control group, we will perform a one-way ANOVA test. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the overall mean (Grand Mean)\nThe overall mean is the average of all the individual group means.\nGrand Mean = (11.2 + 12.3 + 10.5 + 8.6) / 4 = 42.6 / 4 = 10.65 inches\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB) and Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW)\nSSB = Σn_i (mean_i - Grand Mean)^2\nSSW = Σ(n_i - 1) * variance_i\n\nFor Group 1 (Fertilizer A):\nSSB_1 = 10 * (11.2 - 10.65)^2 = 10 * 0.55^2 = 3.025\nSSW_1 = (10 - 1) * 0.98 = 9 * 0.98 = 8.82\n\nFor Group 2 (Fertilizer B):\nSSB_2 = 10 * (12.3 - 10.65)^2 = 10 * 1.65^2 = 27.225\nSSW_2 = (10 - 1) * 1.03 = 9 * 1.03 = 9.27\n\nFor Group 3 (Fertilizer C):\nSSB_3 = 10 * (10.5 - 10.65)^2 = 10 * (-0.15)^2 = 0.225\nSSW_3 = (10 - 1) * 0.95 = 9 * 0.95 = 8.55\n\nFor Group 4 (Control):\nSSB_4 = 10 * (8.6 - 10.65)^2 = 10 * (-2.05)^2 = 42.025\nSSW_4 = (10 - 1) * 0.99 = 9 * 0.99 = 8.91\n\nTotal SSB = SSB_1 + SSB_2 + SSB_3 + SSB_4 = 3.025 + 27.225 + 0.225 + 42.025 = 72.5\nTotal SSW = SSW_1 + SSW_2 + SSW_3 + SSW_4 = 8.82 + 9.27 + 8.55 + 8.91 = 35.55\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Mean Squares Between Groups (MSB) and Mean Squares Within Groups (MSW)\nMSB = SSB / (number of groups - 1) = 72.5 / (4 - 1) = 72.5 / 3 = 24.167\nMSW = SSW / (total number of samples - number of groups) = 35.55 / (40 - 4) = 35.55 / 36 = 0.987\n\nStep 4: Calculate the F-statistic\nF = MSB / MSW = 24.167 / 0.987 = 24.48\n\nStep 5: Determine the critical F-value\nUsing an F-distribution table with a significance level of 0.05, degrees of freedom between groups (df1) = 3, and degrees of freedom within groups (df2) = 36, we find the critical F-value to be approximately 2.87.\n\nStep 6: Compare the F-statistic to the critical F-value\nSince the F-statistic (24.48) is greater than the critical F-value (2.87), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in plant growth between the groups treated with different fertilizers and the control group. Therefore, we can conclude that there is a significant difference in plant growth between the groups treated with different fertilizers and the control group at a significance level of 0.05."
