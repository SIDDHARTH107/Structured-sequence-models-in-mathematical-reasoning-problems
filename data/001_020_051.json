    "message_2": "To solve the equation |2x + 1| = 5, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x + 1 is positive or zero.\nIn this case, we have 2x + 1 = 5. Solving for x, we get:\n\n2x = 5 - 1\n2x = 4\nx = 4/2\nx = 2\n\nCase 2: 2x + 1 is negative.\nIn this case, we have -(2x + 1) = 5. Solving for x, we get:\n\n-2x - 1 = 5\n-2x = 5 + 1\n-2x = 6\nx = -6/2\nx = -3\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation |2x + 1| = 5 are x = 2 and x = -3."
