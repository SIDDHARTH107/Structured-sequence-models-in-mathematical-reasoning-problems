    "message_2": "A Latin square of order 4 is a 4x4 grid filled with 4 distinct symbols such that each symbol appears exactly once in each row and column. To determine the number of distinct Latin squares of order 4 that can be created using the same symbols by rotation and/or reflection, we need to consider the possible transformations:\n\n1. Identity (no transformation): 1 distinct Latin square\n2. Rotation by 90 degrees: 1 distinct Latin square\n3. Rotation by 180 degrees: 1 distinct Latin square\n4. Rotation by 270 degrees: 1 distinct Latin square\n5. Reflection across the vertical axis: 1 distinct Latin square\n6. Reflection across the horizontal axis: 1 distinct Latin square\n7. Reflection across the main diagonal: 1 distinct Latin square\n8. Reflection across the anti-diagonal: 1 distinct Latin square\n\nHowever, some of these transformations may result in the same Latin square. For example, rotating a Latin square by 180 degrees twice is the same as the identity transformation. To account for this, we use Burnside's Lemma, which states that the number of distinct configurations is equal to the average number of configurations fixed by each transformation.\n\nLet's count the number of fixed configurations for each transformation:\n\n1. Identity: 4! = 24 fixed configurations (any Latin square of order 4)\n2. Rotation by 90 degrees: 0 fixed configurations (no Latin square of order 4 remains unchanged after a 90-degree rotation)\n3. Rotation by 180 degrees: 1 fixed configuration (only the \"magic square\" remains unchanged after a 180-degree rotation)\n4. Rotation by 270 degrees: 0 fixed configurations (same as rotation by 90 degrees)\n5. Reflection across the vertical axis: 2 fixed configurations\n6. Reflection across the horizontal axis: 2 fixed configurations\n7. Reflection across the main diagonal: 1 fixed configuration\n8. Reflection across the anti-diagonal: 1 fixed configuration\n\nNow, we apply Burnside's Lemma:\n\n(24 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1) / 8 = 31 / 8\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a Latin square, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\n31 / 8 â‰ˆ 4\n\nTherefore, there are 4 distinct Latin squares of order 4 that can be created using the same symbols by rotation and/or reflection."
