    "message_1": "Suppose you want to encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using a one-time pad encryption where the pad is generated by generating random numbers between 0 and 25. \n\n1. Generate a random key of length 5 by selecting 5 numbers between 0 and 25.\n2. Convert the message \"HELLO\" into numbers using A=0, B=1...Z=25.\n3. Add each number of the message to the corresponding number in the key modulo 26. \n4. Provide the encrypted message using A=0, B=1...Z=25 and the generated key. \n\nChallenge question: If an attacker intercepts the encrypted message but doesn't have the key, how many possible ways are there to decrypt the message?",
    "message_2": "1. Let's generate a random key of length 5 by selecting 5 numbers between 0 and 25. For example, the key could be [3, 15, 22, 7, 11].\n\n2. Convert the message \"HELLO\" into numbers using A=0, B=1...Z=25. The message \"HELLO\" would be represented as [7, 4, 11, 11, 14].\n\n3. Add each number of the message to the corresponding number in the key modulo 26:\n   (7+3) % 26 = 10\n   (4+15) % 26 = 19\n   (11+22) % 26 = 7\n   (11+7) % 26 = 18\n   (14+11) % 26 = 25\n   The resulting encrypted message in numbers is [10, 19, 7, 18, 25].\n\n4. Convert the encrypted message back to letters using A=0, B=1...Z=25. The encrypted message is \"KTHSY\".\n\nChallenge question: If an attacker intercepts the encrypted message but doesn't have the key, there are 26^5 = 11,881,376 possible ways to decrypt the message, as there are 26 options for each of the 5 characters in the key."
