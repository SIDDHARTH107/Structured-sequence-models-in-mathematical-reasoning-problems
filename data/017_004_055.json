    "message_2": "Since 25 is a prime power (25 = 5^2), we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups to determine the possible groups of order 25 up to isomorphism. The theorem states that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nThere are two possible ways to express 25 as a product of prime powers:\n\n1. 25 = 5^2\n2. 25 = 5 * 5\n\nFor each of these factorizations, we can construct a corresponding abelian group:\n\n1. A group of order 5^2: This group is cyclic of order 25, denoted by Z_25 or C_25. It is generated by an element of order 25. This group is cyclic.\n\n2. A group of order 5 * 5: This group is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, denoted by Z_5 × Z_5 or C_5 × C_5. It is generated by two elements, each of order 5. This group is not cyclic but isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nSo, there are two possible groups of order 25 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 25: Z_25 or C_25\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5: Z_5 × Z_5 or C_5 × C_5"
