    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph G is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. In other words, an automorphism is a bijection f: V(G) â†’ V(G) such that two vertices u and v are adjacent in G if and only if f(u) and f(v) are adjacent in G. The automorphism group of G, denoted Aut(G), is the set of all automorphisms of G.\n\nTo find the automorphism group of G, we need to find all possible permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relation. Let's analyze the given graph G:\n\n1. Vertex 5 is of degree 1, while all other vertices have degree 2. Therefore, any automorphism must map vertex 5 to itself.\n2. Vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 form a cycle, so any automorphism must either preserve this cycle or reverse it.\n\nConsidering these observations, we can see that there are only two possible automorphisms:\n\n1. The identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself: f1(v) = v for all v in V(G). This automorphism preserves the adjacency relation, as each vertex is mapped to itself and all edges remain unchanged.\n2. The automorphism that reverses the cycle of vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4: f2(1) = 4, f2(2) = 3, f2(3) = 2, f2(4) = 1, and f2(5) = 5. This automorphism also preserves the adjacency relation, as the edges are preserved when the cycle is reversed.\n\nThus, the automorphism group of G is Aut(G) = {f1, f2}."
