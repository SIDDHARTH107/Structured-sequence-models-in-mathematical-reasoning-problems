    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm and its parallel sides measure 12 cm and 18 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the two non-parallel sides a and b.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of these sides. Since the trapezium is not an isosceles trapezium, we need to divide it into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one vertex of the shorter base to the longer base.\n\nLet's call the length of the shorter base 12 cm, the length of the longer base 18 cm, and the height 8 cm. The perpendicular line divides the longer base into two parts, one of which is adjacent to the shorter base. Let's call the length of this part x.\n\nNow we have two right triangles. In the first right triangle, the height is 8 cm, and the base is x. In the second right triangle, the height is 8 cm, and the base is (18 - x).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for the first right triangle:\n\na^2 = 8^2 + x^2\n\nFor the second right triangle:\n\nb^2 = 8^2 + (18 - x)^2\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. Since the sum of the bases of the two right triangles is equal to the length of the longer base, we have:\n\nx + (18 - x) = 12\nx = 6\n\nNow we can find the lengths of a and b:\n\na^2 = 8^2 + 6^2\na^2 = 64 + 36\na^2 = 100\na = 10\n\nb^2 = 8^2 + (18 - 6)^2\nb^2 = 64 + 144\nb^2 = 208\nb ≈ 14.42 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + 12 + 18\nPerimeter ≈ 10 + 14.42 + 12 + 18\nPerimeter ≈ 54.42 cm"
