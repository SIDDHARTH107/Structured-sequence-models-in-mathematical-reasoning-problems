    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector `A` onto vector `B`, we can use the formula:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (A • B) / ||B||\n\nwhere A • B is the dot product of vectors A and B, and ||B|| is the magnitude of vector B.\n\nFirst, let's find the components of vectors A and B:\n\nA_x = ||A|| * cos(60°) = 5 * (1/2) = 2.5\nA_y = ||A|| * sin(60°) = 5 * (√3/2) = 5√3/2 ≈ 4.330\n\nB_x = ||B|| * cos(30°) = 4 * (√3/2) = 2√3 ≈ 3.464\nB_y = ||B|| * sin(30°) = 4 * (1/2) = 2\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of A and B:\n\nA • B = A_x * B_x + A_y * B_y = 2.5 * 3.464 + 4.330 * 2 = 8.66 + 8.66 = 17.32\n\nFinally, let's find the projection of A onto B:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (A • B) / ||B|| = 17.32 / 4 = 4.33\n\nSo, the projection of vector `A` onto vector `B` is approximately 4.33."
