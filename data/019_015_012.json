    "message_2": "To find the total number of possible functions that can be defined from a set with 4 elements to a set with 3 elements, we can use the formula:\n\nnumber of functions = (number of elements in the codomain)^(number of elements in the domain)\n\nIn this case, the domain has 4 elements and the codomain has 3 elements. So the total number of possible functions is:\n\n3^4 = 81\n\nThere are 81 possible functions that can be defined from a set with 4 elements to a set with 3 elements."
