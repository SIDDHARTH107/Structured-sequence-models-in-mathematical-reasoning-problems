    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circular race track, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference = 2 * π * radius\n\nGiven that the radius of the track is 25 meters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nCircumference = 2 * π * 25\n\nCircumference ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 25\n\nCircumference ≈ 157.0796 * 2\n\nCircumference ≈ 314.159 meters\n\nThe perimeter of the circular race track is approximately 314.159 meters."
