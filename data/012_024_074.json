    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nWe are given V = 9 and E = 12. We need to find the minimum genus g for which the graph can be embedded without crossing edges.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of edges E_max for a planar graph with 9 vertices:\n\nE_max = 3V - 6 = 3(9) - 6 = 27 - 6 = 21\n\nSince E = 12 < E_max, it is possible that the graph is planar (genus 0). However, we need to check if the graph satisfies the condition for planarity.\n\nFor a graph to be planar, it must satisfy the inequality:\n\nE <= 3V - 6\n\nIn our case:\n\n12 <= 3(9) - 6\n12 <= 27 - 6\n12 <= 21\n\nThe inequality holds, so the graph is planar. Therefore, the genus of the graph is 0."
