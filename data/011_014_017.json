    "message_1": "A company has 7 employees, and they need to form a team of 3 people to work on a project. However, the team must include at least 1 employee from the accounting department and at least 1 employee from the marketing department. How many different teams can be formed?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the employees into their respective departments. Let's say there are A employees in the accounting department and M employees in the marketing department. We have three cases to consider:\n\n1. 1 employee from accounting and 2 employees from marketing\n2. 2 employees from accounting and 1 employee from marketing\n3. 1 employee from each department (accounting, marketing, and the remaining department)\n\nCase 1: 1 employee from accounting and 2 employees from marketing\nTo form a team in this case, we need to choose 1 employee from A and 2 employees from M. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(A,1) * C(M,2)\n\nCase 2: 2 employees from accounting and 1 employee from marketing\nTo form a team in this case, we need to choose 2 employees from A and 1 employee from M. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(A,2) * C(M,1)\n\nCase 3: 1 employee from each department\nSince there are 7 employees in total, and we have already accounted for A and M employees, there must be (7 - A - M) employees in the remaining department. To form a team in this case, we need to choose 1 employee from each department. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(A,1) * C(M,1) * C(7-A-M,1)\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways to form a team by adding the number of ways in each case:\n\nTotal number of ways = C(A,1) * C(M,2) + C(A,2) * C(M,1) + C(A,1) * C(M,1) * C(7-A-M,1)\n\nHowever, we don't have the values for A and M. To solve this problem, we need more information about the number of employees in the accounting and marketing departments."
