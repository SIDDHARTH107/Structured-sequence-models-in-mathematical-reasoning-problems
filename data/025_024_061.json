    "message_1": "Suppose we have a linear transformation from a 3-dimensional projective space to itself. If the linear transformation fixes 5 points and no other points, how many distinct lines remain invariant under this transformation?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the linear transformation as T and the fixed points as P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5. Since T is a linear transformation, it will preserve collinearity. That is, if three points are collinear (lie on the same line), their images under T will also be collinear.\n\nNow, let's consider the lines formed by the fixed points. There are 10 distinct lines that can be formed by these 5 points: (P1,P2), (P1,P3), (P1,P4), (P1,P5), (P2,P3), (P2,P4), (P2,P5), (P3,P4), (P3,P5), and (P4,P5).\n\nSince T fixes each of these points, it must also fix the lines formed by these points. That is, T(P1,P2) = (P1,P2), T(P1,P3) = (P1,P3), and so on for all 10 lines.\n\nNow, let's consider any other line L in the projective space that is not formed by the fixed points. Since T fixes only 5 points, there must be at least one point Q on L that is not fixed by T. That is, T(Q) â‰  Q. Since Q and T(Q) are distinct points, they determine a unique line in the projective space. However, this line cannot be L, as L is invariant under T only if T(Q) = Q for all points Q on L. Therefore, no other lines can be invariant under T.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 10 distinct lines that remain invariant under the given linear transformation."
