    "message_1": "A supermarket owner wants to estimate the average number of customers visiting the supermarket in a day. He selects a random sample of 50 days and records the number of customers visiting the supermarket on each of those days. The sample mean and standard deviation are found to be 200 and 30 respectively. Find a 95% confidence interval for the true average number of customers visiting the supermarket in a day.",
    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the true average number of customers visiting the supermarket in a day, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √(Sample Size)\n\nGiven the sample mean (200), standard deviation (30), and sample size (50), we can calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 30 / √(50) ≈ 4.24\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 200 ± (1.96 * 4.24)\n\nConfidence Interval = 200 ± (8.32)\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true average number of customers visiting the supermarket in a day is approximately 191.68 to 208.32. This means that we can be 95% confident that the true average number of customers visiting the supermarket in a day lies between 191.68 and 208.32."
