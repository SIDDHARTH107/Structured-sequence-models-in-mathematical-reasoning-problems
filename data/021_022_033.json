    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is typically used for complex optimization problems. However, in this case, we can find the minimum value of the quadratic function f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 5 on the interval [-10, 10] using calculus.\n\nTo find the minimum value of a function, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 3\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n2x + 3 = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = -3/2 = -1.5\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the interval [-10, 10] and the critical point x = -1.5 to determine the minimum value of the function.\n\nf(-10) = (-10)^2 + 3(-10) + 5 = 100 - 30 + 5 = 75\nf(-1.5) = (-1.5)^2 + 3(-1.5) + 5 = 2.25 - 4.5 + 5 = 2.75\nf(10) = (10)^2 + 3(10) + 5 = 100 + 30 + 5 = 135\n\nThe minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 5 on the interval [-10, 10] is 2.75, which occurs at x = -1.5."
