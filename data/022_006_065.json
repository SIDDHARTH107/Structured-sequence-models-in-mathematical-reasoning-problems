    "message_2": "The Maximum Modulus Principle states that if a function is holomorphic (complex differentiable) in a bounded domain and continuous up to the boundary, then the maximum of the modulus of the function is attained on the boundary of the domain. Similarly, the Minimum Modulus Principle states that the minimum of the modulus of a non-constant holomorphic function is attained on the boundary of the domain.\n\nThe function $f(z) = z^3 + 3z + 1$ is a polynomial and therefore holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane. Thus, both the maximum and minimum values of $|f(z)|$ on the closed disk $D(0,2)$ will be attained on the boundary, which is the circle with radius 2 centered at the origin.\n\nLet $z = re^{i\\theta}$, where $r = 2$ and $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$. Then, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = f(re^{i\\theta}) = (2e^{i\\theta})^3 + 3(2e^{i\\theta}) + 1 = 8e^{3i\\theta} + 6e^{i\\theta} + 1$$\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum and minimum values of $|f(z)|$:\n\n$$|f(z)| = |8e^{3i\\theta} + 6e^{i\\theta} + 1|$$\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of this expression, we can look for the critical points by taking the derivative with respect to $\\theta$ and setting it to zero:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\theta}|f(z)| = 0$$\n\nHowever, finding the critical points analytically can be quite difficult. Instead, we can use the fact that the maximum and minimum values of $|f(z)|$ will occur when the function is real (since the phase will either add or cancel out the magnitudes of the terms). This happens when $\\theta = 0, \\pi, \\frac{2\\pi}{3}, \\frac{4\\pi}{3}$.\n\nEvaluating $|f(z)|$ at these points, we get:\n\n$$|f(2)| = |8 + 6 + 1| = 15$$\n$$|f(-2)| = |-8 + 6 + 1| = 1$$\n$$|f(2e^{2\\pi i/3})| = |-4 + 6\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}) + 1| = |-4 - 3 + 1| = 6$$\n$$|f(2e^{4\\pi i/3})| = |-4 + 6\\cos(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}) + 1| = |-4 + 3 + 1| = 0$$\n\nThus, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on the closed disk $D(0,2)$ is $15$, and the minimum value is $0$."
