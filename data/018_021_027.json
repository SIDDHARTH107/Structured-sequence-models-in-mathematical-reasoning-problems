The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {2, 3} (intersection of A and B)\n\nNow, subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of (A Δ B) and {2, 3}:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ {2, 3} = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3}\n\nThere are no common elements between {1, 4} and {2, 3}, so the intersection is an empty set:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ {2, 3} = ∅"
