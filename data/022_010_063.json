    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem:\n\nFind the Laurent series expansion of the complex function $f(z) = \\frac{z-2}{z^2+z}$ for $0 < |z| < 1$ and determine its convergence.\n\nFirst, we need to find the poles of $f(z)$. Setting the denominator equal to zero, we get $z^2 + z = z(z+1) = 0$, so the poles are at $z = 0$ and $z = -1$. Since the domain of convergence is $0 < |z| < 1$, we need to choose the pole at $z=0$ and expand $f(z)$ in a Laurent series about $z=0$. We have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z-2}{z^2+z} = \\frac{z-2}{z(z+1)} = \\frac{-2}{z+1} + \\frac{1}{z}$$\n\nThe first term has a simple pole at $z=-1$ and the second term has a removable singularity at $z=0$, so the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$ about $z=0$ is:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{-2}{z+1} + \\frac{1}{z} = -2 \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n z^n + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{z^{n+1}}$$\n\nThis series converges for $0 < |z| < 1$, which is the same as the domain of convergence we were given.",
