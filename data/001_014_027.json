    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we first need to break down each square root into its simplest form.\n\n√12 can be written as √(4 * 3), which simplifies to 2√3.\n\n2√27 can be written as 2 * √(9 * 3), which simplifies to 2 * 3√3 = 6√3.\n\n√48 can be written as √(16 * 3), which simplifies to 4√3.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the original expression using the simplified square roots:\n\n2√3 + 6√3 - 4√3\n\nNow, we can combine the terms with the same square root:\n\n(2 + 6 - 4)√3 = 4√3\n\nSo, the simplified expression is 4√3."
