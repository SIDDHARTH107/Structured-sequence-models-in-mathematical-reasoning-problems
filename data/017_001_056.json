    "message_2": "First, let's prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4.\n\nSince G has order 4, there are two possibilities for the structure of G: either G has an element of order 4 (in which case G is cyclic), or all non-identity elements of G have order 2.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nLet g be an element of order 4 in G. Then, G = {e, g, g^2, g^3}, and the group operation can be defined by the powers of g. This makes G isomorphic to the cyclic group C4.\n\nCase 2: All non-identity elements of G have order 2.\nLet G = {e, a, b, c}, where a, b, and c are distinct non-identity elements. Since all non-identity elements have order 2, we have a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. Moreover, since G is a group, the operation table must be closed, and the product of any two distinct non-identity elements must be the remaining non-identity element. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that ab = c, bc = a, and ac = b. This makes G isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4.\n\nNow, let's determine whether the given group G with the operation table:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n  & e & a & b & c \\\\ \\hline\ne & e & a & b & c \\\\\na & a & e & c & b \\\\\nb & b & c & e & a \\\\\nc & c & b & a & e \\\\\n\\end{array}$$\n\nis isomorphic to the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4.\n\nWe can see that a^2 = e, b^2 = e, and c^2 = e, which means that all non-identity elements have order 2. This implies that G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4."
