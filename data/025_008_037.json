    "message_2": "The complex projective plane defined by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$ is a complex algebraic surface, which is a cubic surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. To compute the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}$, we can use the Hodge diamond.\n\nFor a smooth cubic surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the Hodge diamond is given by:\n\n```\n  1\n 0 0\n1 0 1\n 0 0\n  1\n```\n\nSo, the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}$ are:\n\n- $h^{0,0} = 1$\n- $h^{1,0} = h^{0,1} = 0$\n- $h^{1,1} = 0$\n- $h^{2,0} = h^{0,2} = 1$\n- $h^{2,1} = h^{1,2} = 0$\n- $h^{2,2} = 0$\n- $h^{3,0} = h^{0,3} = 0$\n- $h^{3,1} = h^{1,3} = 0$\n- $h^{3,2} = h^{2,3} = 0$\n- $h^{3,3} = 1$\n\nThus, the Hodge numbers of the complex projective plane defined by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$ are $h^{0,0} = 1$, $h^{1,0} = h^{0,1} = 0$, $h^{1,1} = 0$, $h^{2,0} = h^{0,2} = 1$, $h^{2,1} = h^{1,2} = 0$, $h^{2,2} = 0$, $h^{3,0} = h^{0,3} = 0$, $h^{3,1} = h^{1,3} = 0$, $h^{3,2} = h^{2,3} = 0$, and $h^{3,3} = 1$."
