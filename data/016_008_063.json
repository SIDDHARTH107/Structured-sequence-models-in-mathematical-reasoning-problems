    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not change after any number of iterations, as it is a self-similar fractal. To find the Hausdorff dimension, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, each segment is divided into 4 smaller segments, so N = 4. The scaling factor is 3, as each of the smaller segments is 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension remains the same after the 4th iteration or any other iteration."
