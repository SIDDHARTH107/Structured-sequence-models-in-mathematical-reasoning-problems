    "message_1": "A company is deciding between two suppliers for a product. Supplier A offers the product for a fixed cost of $200 plus $5 per unit, while Supplier B offers the product for a fixed cost of $150 plus $6 per unit. If the company needs to purchase at least 100 units, which supplier should they choose to minimize costs? How many units should they purchase from the chosen supplier to minimize costs?",
    "message_2": "To determine which supplier is more cost-effective, we can set up equations for the total cost of each supplier and compare them.\n\nLet x be the number of units purchased.\n\nSupplier A: Total Cost = 200 + 5x\nSupplier B: Total Cost = 150 + 6x\n\nSince the company needs to purchase at least 100 units, we can compare the costs for 100 units:\n\nSupplier A: Total Cost = 200 + 5(100) = 200 + 500 = $700\nSupplier B: Total Cost = 150 + 6(100) = 150 + 600 = $750\n\nAt 100 units, Supplier A is cheaper. Now, we need to find the point at which the costs are equal to determine if there's a range where Supplier B becomes cheaper.\n\n200 + 5x = 150 + 6x\n50 = x\n\nAt 50 units, the costs are equal. However, since the company needs at least 100 units, Supplier A is the better choice for minimizing costs.\n\nThe company should purchase 100 units from Supplier A to minimize costs."
