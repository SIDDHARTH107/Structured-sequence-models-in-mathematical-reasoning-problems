    "message_1": "In a school, 25% of students get an A grade in math, 40% get a B grade, 20% get a C grade, and the remaining students fail. If there are 500 students in the school, how many students are expected to get a B or better grade in math?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of students expected to get a B or better grade in math, we need to add the percentages of students getting an A grade and a B grade. \n\n25% (A grade) + 40% (B grade) = 65%\n\nNow, we need to find 65% of the total number of students, which is 500.\n\n65% of 500 = (65/100) * 500 = 325\n\nSo, 325 students are expected to get a B or better grade in math."
