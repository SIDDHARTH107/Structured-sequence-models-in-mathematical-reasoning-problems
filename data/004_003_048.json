    "message_2": "To maximize the area of the rectangular grazing area, we can use calculus to find the critical points of the area function. Let the length of the rectangle be L and the width be W. We know that the perimeter is 200 feet, so we can write the equation:\n\n2L + 2W = 200\n\nNow, we can solve for one of the variables, say W:\n\nW = (200 - 2L) / 2\nW = 100 - L\n\nThe area of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width:\n\nA(L) = L * W\nA(L) = L * (100 - L)\n\nNow, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of the area function with respect to L and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dL = (100 - L) - L = 100 - 2L\n\nSetting the derivative equal to 0:\n\n0 = 100 - 2L\n2L = 100\nL = 50\n\nNow, we can find the width using the expression for W:\n\nW = 100 - L\nW = 100 - 50\nW = 50\n\nSo, the dimensions that maximize the area of the rectangular grazing area are length L = 50 feet and width W = 50 feet. The maximum area is 50 * 50 = 2500 square feet."
