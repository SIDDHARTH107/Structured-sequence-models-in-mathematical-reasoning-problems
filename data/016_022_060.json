    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal created by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The number of triangular faces in a Sierpinski pyramid of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal triangular faces = 4^n\n\nFor a Sierpinski pyramid of order 4:\n\nTotal triangular faces = 4^4 = 256"
