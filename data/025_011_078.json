    "message_2": "To find the coordinates of the point $R = P + Q$ on the elliptic curve $E$, we need to consider three cases:\n\n1. If $P = O$ (the point at infinity) or $Q = O$, then $P + Q = Q$ or $P + Q = P$, respectively.\n2. If $P = -Q$, i.e., $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = -y_2$, then $P + Q = O$ (the point at infinity).\n3. If $P \\neq -Q$, we can find the slope $\\lambda$ of the line passing through $P$ and $Q$ and use it to find the coordinates of $R$.\n\nCase 3 is the most general one, so let's focus on that. We have two subcases:\n\na) If $P \\neq Q$, the slope of the line passing through $P$ and $Q$ is given by:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.\n\nb) If $P = Q$, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at point $P$ is given by:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1}$.\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of the point $R = P + Q$ using the following formulas:\n\n$x_3 = \\lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2$\n$y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1$\n\nSo, depending on the relationship between $P$ and $Q$, we can find the coordinates of $R$ using the appropriate formulas for $\\lambda$, $x_3$, and $y_3$."
