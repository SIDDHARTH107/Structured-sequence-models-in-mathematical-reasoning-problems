    "message_1": "Here is a possible numerical problem in Solving optimization problems using bat algorithm:\n\nSuppose you are trying to minimize the cost of producing a certain product, subject to some constraints on the amount of raw materials used and the production capacity. The cost function is given by:\n\ncost(x) = 0.5x^2 - 6x + 10\n\nwhere x is the production quantity (in thousands of units). The constraints are:\n\n- The use of raw material A cannot exceed 30x + 20y units.\n- The use of raw material B cannot exceed 40x + 30y units.\n- The total production quantity cannot exceed 100x + 80y units.\n\nUse the bat algorithm with n=20 bats, frequency range [0,2], loudness amplitude 1, and pulse rate 0.5 to find the optimal production quantities x* and y*, and their minimum cost c*. Use an initial population of random solutions in the range [0,10] for x and y, and a maximum of 100 iterations.",
