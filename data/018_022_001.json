    "message_1": "Let A = {1,2,3} and B = {2,3,4}. Calculate (A △ B) × A and then calculate A × (B △ A), if they are equal then the symmetric difference of two sets is commutative with respect to Cartesian product. If they are not equal, what can you conclude about the symmetric difference of two sets?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's calculate (A △ B) × A:\n\n(A △ B) × A = {1, 4} × {1, 2, 3} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNext, let's calculate A × (B △ A):\n\nA × (B △ A) = {1, 2, 3} × {1, 4} = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)}\n\nComparing the two sets, we can see that they are not equal:\n\n(A △ B) × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\nA × (B △ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)}\n\nSince the two sets are not equal, we can conclude that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to the Cartesian product."
