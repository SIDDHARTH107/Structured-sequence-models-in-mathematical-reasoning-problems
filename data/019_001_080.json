    "message_1": "Let's say there are two propositions A and B. A is \"Max is a doctor\" and B is \"Max is married\". If A is true and B is false, what is the truth value of the proposition \"Max is a doctor and married\"?",
    "message_2": "In this case, the proposition \"Max is a doctor and married\" is a conjunction of propositions A and B. In order for a conjunction to be true, both of the individual propositions must be true. Since A is true (\"Max is a doctor\") and B is false (\"Max is married\"), the conjunction \"Max is a doctor and married\" is false."
