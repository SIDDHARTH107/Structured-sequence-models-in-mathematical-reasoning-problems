    "message_2": "To determine the degree sequence of the graph, we need to find the degrees of all the vertices in the graph. Since we don't have specific information about the connections between the vertices, we can't provide an exact degree sequence. However, we can provide some general information about the degree sequence based on the given information.\n\nA graph with 10 vertices and 25 edges is an undirected graph. In an undirected graph, each edge connects two vertices. The sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges, as each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices.\n\nSo, the sum of the degrees of all vertices in this graph is:\n\nSum of degrees = 2 * number of edges = 2 * 25 = 50\n\nSince there are 10 vertices, the average degree of a vertex in the graph is:\n\nAverage degree = Sum of degrees / number of vertices = 50 / 10 = 5\n\nThis means that, on average, each vertex in the graph has a degree of 5. However, this doesn't mean that every vertex has a degree of 5. The actual degree sequence could vary depending on the specific connections between the vertices.\n\nFor example, one possible degree sequence could be (4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5), where three vertices have a degree of 4, three vertices have a degree of 6, and the remaining four vertices have a degree of 5. There are many other possible degree sequences that satisfy the given conditions, but without more information about the graph, we cannot determine the exact degree sequence."
