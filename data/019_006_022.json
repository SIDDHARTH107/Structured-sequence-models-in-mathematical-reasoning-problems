    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it is not possible to create a precise numerical problem with only the information that the subject is \"Logic\" and the subtopic is \"Deontic logic.\" Deontic logic is a branch of logic that deals with necessity and permission, often applied in ethical reasoning. It is not necessarily numerical, but rather focuses on the logical relationships between statements. If you provide more information or context, I can try to assist you better in forming a numerical problem for a mathematics student to solve.",
    "message_2": "If you need a mathematical problem related to logic, I can provide you with a problem in propositional logic, which is a branch of logic that deals with the manipulation of truth values of statements.\n\nProblem: Consider the following statements:\n\nP: \"It is raining.\"\nQ: \"I will take an umbrella.\"\n\nTranslate the following compound statements into their symbolic form:\n\n1. \"If it is raining, then I will take an umbrella.\"\n2. \"It is not raining, and I will not take an umbrella.\"\n3. \"Either it is raining, or I will take an umbrella, but not both.\"\n\nNow, determine the truth values of these compound statements if P is true and Q is false."
