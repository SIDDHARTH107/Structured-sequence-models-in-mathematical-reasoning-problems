    "message_2": "The second-order centered finite difference method for approximating the derivative of a function f(x) at a point x is given by:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2h)\n\nIn this case, we have f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 1, x = 1, and h = 0.1. We need to calculate f(1 + 0.1) and f(1 - 0.1) first:\n\nf(1.1) = (1.1)^3 - 2(1.1) + 1 = 1.331 - 2.2 + 1 = 0.131\nf(0.9) = (0.9)^3 - 2(0.9) + 1 = 0.729 - 1.8 + 1 = 0.071\n\nNow, we can use the second-order centered finite difference formula:\n\nf'(1) ≈ (f(1.1) - f(0.9)) / (2 * 0.1) = (0.131 - 0.071) / 0.2 = 0.06 / 0.2 = 0.3\n\nSo, the numerical approximation of f'(1) using the second-order centered finite difference method with a step size of h = 0.1 is 0.3."
