    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle ABC, AB = AC = 8 cm and the altitude BD intersects AC at point D. If BD = 6 cm, what is the length of BC?",
    "message_2": "Since triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the altitude BD bisects the base AC at point D. Therefore, AD = DC.\n\nLet AD = DC = x. Then AC = AD + DC = 2x.\n\nNow, consider the right triangle ABD. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\n8^2 = x^2 + 6^2\n64 = x^2 + 36\nx^2 = 28\nx = √28\n\nSince AD = DC = x, we have AC = 2x = 2√28.\n\nNow, consider the right triangle BDC. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nBC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2\nBC^2 = 6^2 + (√28)^2\nBC^2 = 36 + 28\nBC^2 = 64\nBC = √64\nBC = 8 cm\n\nSo, the length of BC is 8 cm."
