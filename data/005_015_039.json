They have collected data on the amount spent by each customer and the frequency of their visits over the past month. Using cluster analysis, they want to group their customers into three clusters based on their spending behavior. \nThe spending behavior of the customers is measured using two variables: \n- Average amount spent per visit (in dollars) \n- Number of visits made in the last month\n\nUsing k-means clustering, determine the three clusters and label them based on the spending behavior of the customers. The data for the 12 customers can be found below:\n\n|Customer|Average amount spent per visit (in dollars)|Number of visits in the past month|\n|--------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|1       |50                                       |3                               |\n|2       |35                                       |2                               |\n|3       |80                                       |1                               |\n|4       |65                                       |2                               |\n|5       |45                                       |3                               |\n|6       |90                                       |1                               |\n|7       |75                                       |2                               |\n|8       |30                                       |4                               |\n|9       |60                                       |3                               |\n|10      |50                                       |2                               |\n|11      |70                                       |1                               |\n|12      |40                                       |4                               |",

Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids do not change significantly or a certain number of iterations have been reached.\n\nLet's assume the initial centroids are randomly selected as follows:\n\nCentroid 1: (50, 3)\nCentroid 2: (80, 1)\nCentroid 3: (30, 4)\n\nNow, we will assign each data point to the nearest centroid and update the centroids:\n\nIteration 1:\nCluster 1: (50, 3), (45, 3), (60, 3)\nCluster 2: (80, 1), (90, 1), (70, 1)\nCluster 3: (35, 2), (65, 2), (30, 4), (50, 2), (40, 4)\n\nUpdate centroids:\nCentroid 1: (51.67, 3)\nCentroid 2: (80, 1)\nCentroid 3: (44, 2.8)\n\nIteration 2:\nCluster 1: (50, 3), (45, 3), (60, 3)\nCluster 2: (80, 1), (90, 1), (75, 2), (70, 1)\nCluster 3: (35, 2), (65, 2), (30, 4), (50, 2), (40, 4)\n\nThe centroids did not change significantly, so we can stop the iterations here.\n\nFinal clusters:\nCluster 1 (Moderate spenders, frequent visitors): Customers 1, 5, and 9\nCluster 2 (High spenders, infrequent visitors): Customers 3, 6, 7, and 11\nCluster 3 (Low spenders, mixed frequency visitors): Customers 2, 4, 8, 10, and 12"
