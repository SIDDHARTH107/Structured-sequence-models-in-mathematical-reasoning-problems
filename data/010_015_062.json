    "message_2": "The surface X defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 is a 2-sphere (S^2) in R^3. To compute the second De Rham cohomology group of X, we can use the fact that the De Rham cohomology groups of a manifold are isomorphic to its singular cohomology groups with real coefficients.\n\nFor the 2-sphere, the singular cohomology groups with real coefficients are given by:\n\nH^0(S^2; R) = R (since S^2 is connected)\nH^1(S^2; R) = 0 (since S^2 is simply connected)\nH^2(S^2; R) = R (since S^2 is a compact, orientable 2-manifold)\n\nTherefore, the second De Rham cohomology group of X is:\n\nH^2(X) = H^2(S^2; R) = R"
