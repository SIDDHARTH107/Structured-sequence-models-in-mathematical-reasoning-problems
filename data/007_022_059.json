    "message_2": "To determine the order of the elliptic curve y^2 ≡ x^3 + 2x + 2 (mod 11), we need to find the number of points (x, y) that satisfy the equation, including the point at infinity.\n\nWe can do this by iterating through all possible x and y values in the finite field F_11 (i.e., the integers from 0 to 10) and checking if they satisfy the equation.\n\nHere's a table of the points that satisfy the equation:\n\nx | y\n--|--\n0 | 5, 6\n1 | -\n2 | 1, 10\n3 | 3, 8\n4 | 2, 9\n5 | 4, 7\n6 | 0\n7 | 4, 7\n8 | 2, 9\n9 | 3, 8\n10 | 1, 10\n\nThere are 12 points in the table, plus the point at infinity, so the order of the elliptic curve is 13."
