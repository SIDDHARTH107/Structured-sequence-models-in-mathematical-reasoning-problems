    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of getting 25 heads and 25 tails in 50 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (k!(n-k)!)) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (heads) in n trials (flips)\n- n is the number of trials (flips), which is 50 in this case\n- k is the number of successes (heads), which is 25 in this case\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial, which is 0.5 (since there are two equally likely outcomes: heads or tails)\n- q is the probability of failure (getting tails) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 (since there are two equally likely outcomes: heads or tails)\n- n! is the factorial of n (the product of all positive integers up to n)\n- k! is the factorial of k (the product of all positive integers up to k)\n- (n-k)! is the factorial of (n-k) (the product of all positive integers up to n-k)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(25) = (50! / (25!(50-25)!)) * (0.5^25) * (0.5^(50-25))\n\nP(25) = (50! / (25!25!)) * (0.5^25) * (0.5^25)\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorials and the probabilities:\n\n50! = 3.04140932 × 10^64\n25! = 1.55112100 × 10^25\n\nP(25) = (3.04140932 × 10^64) / ((1.55112100 × 10^25)(1.55112100 × 10^25)) * (0.5^25) * (0.5^25)\n\nP(25) ≈ 0.11227517\n\nSo, the probability of getting 25 heads and 25 tails in 50 coin flips is approximately 11.23%."
