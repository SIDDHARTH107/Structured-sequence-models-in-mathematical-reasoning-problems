    "message_1": "A building stands 100 meters away from a person, and the angle of elevation from the person's eye to the top of the building is 30 degrees. What is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 30 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance between the person and the building (100 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (which we want to find).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(30°) = height / 100\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 100:\n\nheight = 100 * tan(30°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 30 degrees:\n\ntan(30°) ≈ 0.577\n\nFinally, we can multiply this value by 100 to find the height of the building:\n\nheight ≈ 100 * 0.577 ≈ 57.7 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 57.7 meters."
