    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nwhere minor_radius is the minor radius of the torus (3cm) and major_radius is the major radius of the torus (6cm).\n\nVolume = (π * 3^2) * (2 * π * 6)\nVolume = (π * 9) * (12 * π)\nVolume = 108π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 339.29 cm³."
