    "message_2": "A prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest prime gap greater than 20, we need to find two consecutive prime numbers whose difference is greater than 20.\n\nThe prime gap greater than 20 occurs between the prime numbers 89 and 113. The difference between these two prime numbers is 113 - 89 = 24. Therefore, the smallest prime gap greater than 20 is 24."
