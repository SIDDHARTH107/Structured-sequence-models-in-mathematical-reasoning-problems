    "message_2": "Let's consider a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ on the torus $T^2 = S^1 \\times S^1$, where $S^1$ is the circle. We are given that the function has Morse index $i$ at each critical point.\n\nRecall the Morse inequalities, which state that for any non-negative integer $k$, we have:\n\n$$M_k \\leq b_k$$\n\nwhere $M_k$ is the number of critical points of index $k$, and $b_k$ is the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold. The Betti numbers of the torus are $b_0 = b_2 = 1$ and $b_1 = 2$. \n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of the Morse index $i$:\n\n1. If $i = 0$, then all critical points are minima. By the Morse inequalities, we have $M_0 \\leq b_0 = 1$. However, since the function is non-constant, there must be at least one maximum, so there must be at least one critical point with index $i = 2$. Therefore, the minimum number of critical points in this case is $2$.\n\n2. If $i = 1$, then all critical points are saddles. By the Morse inequalities, we have $M_1 \\leq b_1 = 2$. However, since the function is non-constant, there must be at least one minimum and one maximum. Therefore, the minimum number of critical points in this case is $2 + 1 + 1 = 4$.\n\n3. If $i = 2$, then all critical points are maxima. The argument is symmetric to the case $i = 0$, so the minimum number of critical points in this case is also $2$.\n\nThus, the minimum number of critical points that a non-constant smooth function on the torus must have, given that the function has Morse index $i$ at each critical point, is $2$."
