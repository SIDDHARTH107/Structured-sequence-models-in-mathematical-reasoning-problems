    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system with impulse response h(t) = (1/2) * e^(-2t) * u(t), we need to check if the impulse response is absolutely integrable. This means we need to evaluate the following integral:\n\n∫|h(t)| dt from -∞ to ∞\n\nSince h(t) = (1/2) * e^(-2t) * u(t), the impulse response is zero for t < 0 due to the unit step function u(t). Therefore, we only need to evaluate the integral for t ≥ 0:\n\n∫|h(t)| dt from 0 to ∞ = ∫(1/2) * e^(-2t) dt from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\n∫(1/2) * e^(-2t) dt = (-1/4) * e^(-2t) + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral from 0 to ∞:\n\n((-1/4) * e^(-2t))| from 0 to ∞ = [(-1/4) * e^(-2∞)] - [(-1/4) * e^(-2*0)]\n\nThe first term goes to zero as e^(-2∞) goes to 0:\n\n0 - [(-1/4) * e^0] = -(-1/4) = 1/4\n\nSince the integral converges to a finite value (1/4), the impulse response h(t) is absolutely integrable, and therefore, the system is stable."
