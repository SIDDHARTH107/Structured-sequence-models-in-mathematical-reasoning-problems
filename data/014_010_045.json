    "message_1": "Suppose you are using a substitution cipher where each letter of the alphabet is replaced with another letter. If the letter \"A\" is replaced by \"D\", \"B\" is replaced by \"E\", and so on, what letter would \"N\" be replaced with?",
    "message_2": "In this substitution cipher, each letter is replaced by the letter that is 3 positions ahead of it in the alphabet. To find the letter that \"N\" is replaced with, we can follow the same pattern.\n\nThe position of \"N\" in the alphabet is 14. Adding 3 positions to it, we get 14 + 3 = 17. The 17th letter in the alphabet is \"Q\". Therefore, \"N\" would be replaced with \"Q\" in this substitution cipher."
