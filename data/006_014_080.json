    "message_1": "A company produces laptops and 5% of them have a faulty keyboard. If the company produces 400 laptops, what is the probability that at least 20 of them will have a faulty keyboard?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (faulty keyboards) in n trials (laptops produced)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (5% or 0.05)\n- n is the number of trials (400 laptops)\n- k is the number of successes (20 faulty keyboards)\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of at least 20 faulty keyboards, so we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 20, 21, 22, ..., 400.\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - P(X < 20) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 19\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - Σ C(400, k) * 0.05^k * 0.95^(400-k) for k = 0 to 19\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X >= 20) ≈ 1 - 0.0184 = 0.9816\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 laptops will have a faulty keyboard is approximately 98.16%."
