Each fisherman needs to decide how much effort to put into fishing. Suppose the total number of fish in the lake is 100. The maximum catch per fisherman is 20 fish. However, if all fishermen fish at maximum capacity, the total catch is reduced by 20%. If each fisherman has a discount rate of 10%, how many fish should each fisherman catch to maximize their individual profits and prevent overfishing?\n\n(Note: The discount rate refers to how much each fisherman values a future gain versus an immediate gain. If the discount rate is high, the fisherman will prioritize the short-term gain of catching more fish.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal number of fish each fisherman should catch to maximize their individual profits and prevent overfishing.\n\nLet x be the number of fish each fisherman catches. Since there are 10 fishermen, the total catch will be 10x. If all fishermen fish at maximum capacity (20 fish each), the total catch is reduced by 20%, which means the total catch will be 0.8 * (10 * 20) = 160 fish.\n\nWe need to find the optimal x such that the total catch is not reduced by 20%. Let's set up an equation for the total catch:\n\nTotal catch = 10x\n\nNow, we need to consider the discount rate of 10%. This means that each fisherman values a future gain at 90% of its current value. Let's set up an equation for the total value of the catch for each fisherman:\n\nValue of catch = x * (1 - 0.1 * x)\n\nWe want to maximize the value of the catch for each fisherman. To do this, we can take the derivative of the value of the catch with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Value of catch) / dx = 1 - 0.2 * x = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, each fisherman should catch 5 fish to maximize their individual profits and prevent overfishing. The total catch for the village will be 10 * 5 = 50 fish, which is half of the total number of fish in the lake. This ensures that the fish population can recover and be sustainable for future fishing."
