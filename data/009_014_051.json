    "message_1": "A population of rabbits on a farm was observed to grow according to the logistic growth model. The initial population was 100 rabbits, and the carrying capacity of the environment was 500 rabbits. It was also estimated that the rabbits' growth rate was 0.16 per week. Find the equation for the population of rabbits at any given time and predict what the population will be after 5 weeks.",
    "message_2": "The logistic growth model is given by the equation:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) / P0 * e^(-r*t))\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, K is the carrying capacity, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nIn this case, we have K = 500, P0 = 100, and r = 0.16. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nP(t) = 500 / (1 + (500 - 100) / 100 * e^(-0.16*t))\n\nNow, we want to predict the population after 5 weeks, so we need to find P(5):\n\nP(5) = 500 / (1 + (500 - 100) / 100 * e^(-0.16*5))\n\nP(5) = 500 / (1 + 400 / 100 * e^(-0.8))\n\nP(5) = 500 / (1 + 4 * e^(-0.8))\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of e^(-0.8) and then find P(5):\n\ne^(-0.8) ≈ 0.4493\n\nP(5) = 500 / (1 + 4 * 0.4493)\n\nP(5) = 500 / (1 + 1.7972)\n\nP(5) = 500 / 2.7972\n\nP(5) ≈ 178.57\n\nAfter 5 weeks, the population of rabbits is predicted to be approximately 179 rabbits."
