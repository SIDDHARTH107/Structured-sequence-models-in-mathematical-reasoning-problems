    "message_1": "Suppose we have a substitution cipher where each letter is encrypted according to a fixed rule, such that each encrypted letter is replaced by another letter in the alphabet. If the letter 'A' is encrypted to the letter 'E' via this rule, what letter will the letter 'Z' be encrypted to?",
    "message_2": "If the letter 'A' is encrypted to the letter 'E', it means that the rule shifts each letter by 4 positions forward in the alphabet. To find the encrypted letter for 'Z', we can apply the same rule.\n\nThe position of 'Z' in the alphabet is 26. When we shift it 4 positions forward, we get the position 30. Since there are only 26 letters in the alphabet, we need to wrap around and start counting again from the beginning of the alphabet. To do this, we can use the modulo operation:\n\n30 mod 26 = 4\n\nSo, the encrypted letter for 'Z' will be at position 4 in the alphabet, which is the letter 'D'."
