    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3, we will first show that G has a cyclic subgroup of order 3, and then we will show that G can be generated by two elements, one of order 2 and the other of order 3.\n\nLet G be a group of order 6 with exactly 3 distinct elements of order 2. By the Cauchy's theorem, there exists an element of order 3 in G. Let x be such an element. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by x, denoted by ⟨x⟩, has order 3. Since the order of G is 6, there are 6 - 3 = 3 elements outside of ⟨x⟩. Let these elements be y, z, and w.\n\nNow, we know that the order of y, z, and w is 2, as there are exactly 3 distinct elements of order 2 in G. Thus, y^2 = z^2 = w^2 = e, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nWe will now show that G can be generated by x and y. Since x has order 3 and y has order 2, their product xy has order 6 or 2. If the order of xy is 6, then G = ⟨x, y⟩, and we are done. If the order of xy is 2, then (xy)^2 = x^2y^2 = e. Since x^2 ≠ e and y^2 = e, we have x^2 = y^(-1)xy. Thus, x^2 is a product of two elements of order 2, which implies that x^2 = z or x^2 = w (since x^2 ≠ y^2 = e).\n\nWithout loss of generality, let x^2 = z. Then, G = {e, x, x^2, y, yx, yx^2} = {e, x, z, y, yx, yz}. Since x has order 3 and y has order 2, G is generated by x and y, and their relations are x^3 = e, y^2 = e, and yx = x^2y (since x^2 = z = y^(-1)xy).\n\nNow, let D3 be the dihedral group of order 6, generated by elements a and b with relations a^3 = e, b^2 = e, and ba = a^2b. Define a mapping φ: G → D3 such that φ(x) = a and φ(y) = b. We will show that φ is an isomorphism.\n\nFirst, we show that φ is a homomorphism. For any g, h in G, we have:\n\n1. If g = x^i and h = x^j, where i, j ∈ {0, 1, 2}, then φ(gh) = φ(x^(i+j)) = a^(i+j) = a^i * a^j = φ(g)φ(h).\n2. If g = x^i and h = yx^j, where i, j ∈ {0, 1, 2}, then φ(gh) = φ(yx^(i+j)) = b * a^(i+j) = a^i * b * a^j = φ(g)φ(h).\n3. If g = yx^i and h = x^j, where i, j ∈ {0, 1, 2}, then φ(gh) = φ(yx^(i+j)) = b * a^(i+j) = a^(-i) * b * a^i * a^j = φ(g)φ(h).\n4. If g = yx^i and h = yx^j, where i, j ∈ {0, 1, 2}, then φ(gh) = φ(x^(i+j)) = a^(i+j) = a^i * a^j = φ(g)φ(h).\n\nThus, φ is a homomorphism.\n\nNext, we show that φ is bijective. Since |G| = |D3| = 6, it is enough to show that φ is either injective or surjective.\n\nTo show that φ is injective, suppose φ(g) = φ(h) for some g, h in G. Then, g and h must have the same form (either both are powers of x or both are products of y and a power of x). Moreover, since φ is a homomorphism, g and h must have the same exponent for x. Thus, g = h, and φ is injective.\n\nSince φ is a homomorphism and injective, it is also surjective, as |G| = |D3|. Therefore, φ is a bijection.\n\nSince φ is a bijective homomorphism, it is an isomorphism. Thus, G is isomorphic to D3."
