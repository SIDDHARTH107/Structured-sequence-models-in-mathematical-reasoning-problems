    "message_2": "To solve the discrete logarithm problem 3^x ≡ 10 (mod 13), we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x such that 3^x is congruent to 10 modulo 13.\n\nWe can do this by trying different values of x and checking if the congruence holds:\n\nx = 0: 3^0 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\nx = 1: 3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\nx = 2: 3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 13)\nx = 3: 3^3 ≡ 27 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\nx = 4: 3^4 ≡ 81 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\nx = 5: 3^5 ≡ 243 ≡ 9 (mod 13)\nx = 6: 3^6 ≡ 729 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\nx = 7: 3^7 ≡ 2187 ≡ 3 (mod 13)\nx = 8: 3^8 ≡ 6561 ≡ 9 (mod 13)\nx = 9: 3^9 ≡ 19683 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n...\n\nWe can see that the powers of 3 are cycling through the values 1, 3, and 9 modulo 13. Since 10 is not in this cycle, there is no solution for x in the equation 3^x ≡ 10 (mod 13)."
