    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the curves y = sqrt(x) and y = x - 2, we need to find the integral of the difference between the two functions within the limits x = 0 and x = 4.\n\nFirst, let's find the points of intersection between the two curves:\ny = sqrt(x)\ny = x - 2\n\nSet the two equations equal to each other:\nsqrt(x) = x - 2\n\nSquare both sides:\nx = (x - 2)^2\n\nExpand the right side:\nx = x^2 - 4x + 4\n\nRearrange the equation to a quadratic equation:\nx^2 - 5x + 4 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n(x - 1)(x - 4) = 0\n\nThe solutions are x = 1 and x = 4. Since we are given the limits x = 0 and x = 4, we will use these as our limits of integration.\n\nNow, we will find the integral of the difference between the two functions:\nArea = ∫(x - 2 - sqrt(x)) dx from 0 to 4\n\nTo solve the integral, we will break it into two parts:\nArea = ∫(x - 2) dx - ∫(sqrt(x)) dx from 0 to 4\n\nSolve the first integral:\n∫(x - 2) dx = (1/2)x^2 - 2x + C\n\nSolve the second integral:\n∫(sqrt(x)) dx = ∫(x^(1/2)) dx = (2/3)x^(3/2) + C\n\nNow, we will find the area by evaluating the integrals at the limits 0 and 4:\nArea = [(1/2)(4)^2 - 2(4) - (2/3)(4)^(3/2)] - [(1/2)(0)^2 - 2(0) - (2/3)(0)^(3/2)]\nArea = [(1/2)(16) - 8 - (2/3)(8)] - [0]\nArea = [8 - 8 - (16/3)] = -16/3\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\nArea = |-16/3| = 16/3\n\nThe area enclosed between the curves y = sqrt(x) and y = x - 2 within the limits x = 0 and x = 4 is 16/3 square units."
