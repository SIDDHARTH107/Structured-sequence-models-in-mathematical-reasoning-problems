    "message_2": "The median is the middle value of a data set when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. In this case, the data set is already in ascending order. Since there are 10 numbers (an even amount), the median will be the average of the two middle values.\n\nThe two middle values are 29 and 33. To find the average, add the two numbers and divide by 2:\n\n(29 + 33) / 2 = 62 / 2 = 31\n\nThe median of the data set is 31."
