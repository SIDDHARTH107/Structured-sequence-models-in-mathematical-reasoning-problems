The heights (in centimeters) and weights (in kilograms) of ten randomly selected students from each group are given below:\n\nGroup A: \nHeights: 170, 174, 165, 180, 175, 172, 168, 169, 173, 172\nWeights: 65, 72, 60, 78, 70, 67, 62, 63, 68, 71\n\nGroup B: \nHeights: 165, 169, 172, 177, 180, 176, 179, 171, 173, 174\nWeights: 60, 63, 65, 72, 75, 68, 72, 64, 67, 69\n\nUsing discriminant analysis, determine the most important variable (height or weight) in distinguishing between the two groups.",
    "message_2": "To perform discriminant analysis, we first need to calculate the means and variances for both height and weight in each group. Then, we will calculate the discriminant function coefficients for height and weight, which will help us determine the most important variable in distinguishing between the two groups.\n\nGroup A:\nMean Height (MH_A) = (170+174+165+180+175+172+168+169+173+172)/10 = 1718/10 = 171.8 cm\nMean Weight (MW_A) = (65+72+60+78+70+67+62+63+68+71)/10 = 676/10 = 67.6 kg\n\nGroup B:\nMean Height (MH_B) = (165+169+172+177+180+176+179+171+173+174)/10 = 1736/10 = 173.6 cm\nMean Weight (MW_B) = (60+63+65+72+75+68+72+64+67+69)/10 = 665/10 = 66.5 kg\n\nNow, let's calculate the variances for height and weight in each group.\n\nVariance Height Group A (VH_A) = Σ(Height_i - MH_A)^2 / 10\nVariance Weight Group A (VW_A) = Σ(Weight_i - MW_A)^2 / 10\n\nVariance Height Group B (VH_B) = Σ(Height_i - MH_B)^2 / 10\nVariance Weight Group B (VW_B) = Σ(Weight_i - MW_B)^2 / 10\n\nVH_A = (0.04+4.84+46.24+67.24+10.24+0.04+14.44+7.84+1.44+0.04)/10 = 152.32/10 = 15.232\nVW_A = (6.76+19.36+57.76+108.16+2.56+0.36+31.36+21.16+0.16+11.56)/10 = 249.2/10 = 24.92\n\nVH_B = (74.16+21.16+2.56+11.56+40.96+5.76+29.16+6.76+1.96+0.16)/10 = 194.0/10 = 19.4\nVW_B = (42.25+12.25+2.25+30.25+72.25+2.25+30.25+6.25+0.25+6.25)/10 = 204.5/10 = 20.45\n\nNow, let's calculate the pooled within-group variance for height (VH_P) and weight (VW_P):\n\nVH_P = ((10-1)*VH_A + (10-1)*VH_B) / (10+10-2) = (9*15.232 + 9*19.4) / 18 = 311.088 / 18 = 17.282\nVW_P = ((10-1)*VW_A + (10-1)*VW_B) / (10+10-2) = (9*24.92 + 9*20.45) / 18 = 407.325 / 18 = 22.629\n\nFinally, let's calculate the discriminant function coefficients for height (DCH) and weight (DCW):\n\nDCH = (MH_A - MH_B) / VH_P = (171.8 - 173.6) / 17.282 = -1.8 / 17.282 = -0.104\nDCW = (MW_A - MW_B) / VW_P = (67.6 - 66.5) / 22.629 = 1.1 / 22.629 = 0.049\n\nNow, we compare the absolute values of the discriminant function coefficients:\n\n|DCH| = 0.104\n|DCW| = 0.049\n\nSince |DCH| > |DCW|, the height is the most important variable in distinguishing between the two groups."
