    "message_1": "Consider the function f(z) = (z-3)/(z^2+2z+1). Determine the location and order of the zeros and poles of this function.",
    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz - 3 = 0\nz = 3\n\nSo, there is one zero located at z = 3, and its order is 1 since it is a simple root.\n\nNow, to find the poles of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 + 2z + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can factor it as follows:\n\n(z + 1)(z + 1) = 0\n\nz = -1\n\nSo, there is one pole located at z = -1. Since the factor (z + 1) appears twice in the denominator, the order of the pole is 2.\n\nIn summary, the function f(z) has one zero at z = 3 with order 1, and one pole at z = -1 with order 2."
