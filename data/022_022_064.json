    "message_2": "To compute the complex Fourier transform of f(z), we first need to define the Fourier transform for complex functions. Given a complex function f(z) defined on the upper half plane, its Fourier transform F(ω) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(z) * e^(-iωz)] dz, where the integral is taken over a straight line parallel to the real axis in the upper half plane.\n\nNow, let's compute the Fourier transform of f(z):\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(z) * e^(-iωz)] dz\n\nSince f(z) is holomorphic in the upper half plane and |f(z)| ≤ 1/(1 + |z|^2), we can apply the Cauchy integral theorem to the integral. The Cauchy integral theorem states that if a function is holomorphic in a simply connected domain, then the integral of the function over any closed contour in that domain is zero.\n\nLet C_R be a semicircle in the upper half plane with radius R and centered at the origin. Then, we can write the integral as:\n\nF(ω) = lim(R → ∞) ∫[f(z) * e^(-iωz)] dz, where the integral is taken over C_R.\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts: one over the straight line segment from -R to R, and one over the semicircular arc. The integral over the straight line segment is the Fourier transform we want to compute, and the integral over the semicircular arc should go to zero as R → ∞ due to the bound on |f(z)|.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nF(ω) = lim(R → ∞) ∫[f(z) * e^(-iωz)] dz, where the integral is taken over the straight line segment from -R to R.\n\nNow, to compute the inverse Fourier transform, we use the following formula:\n\nf(z) = (1/2π) ∫[F(ω) * e^(iωz)] dω, where the integral is taken over the real line.\n\nSince we have already computed F(ω) as the limit of an integral, we can substitute it into the inverse Fourier transform formula:\n\nf(z) = (1/2π) ∫[lim(R → ∞) ∫[f(z) * e^(-iωz)] dz * e^(iωz)] dω\n\nNow, we can exchange the order of integration and the limit:\n\nf(z) = lim(R → ∞) (1/2π) ∫[∫[f(z) * e^(-iωz) * e^(iωz)] dz] dω\n\nThe inner integral is just the integral of f(z) over the straight line segment from -R to R, which is equal to f(z) since f(z) is holomorphic in the upper half plane. Therefore, we have:\n\nf(z) = lim(R → ∞) (1/2π) ∫[f(z)] dω\n\nSince f(z) does not depend on ω, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nf(z) = f(z) * lim(R → ∞) (1/2π) ∫[1] dω\n\nThe integral of 1 over the real line is infinite, so the limit does not exist. Therefore, we cannot compute the inverse Fourier transform of f(z) in this case."
