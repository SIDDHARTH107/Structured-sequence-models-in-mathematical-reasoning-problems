Each unit of product A requires 2 hours on machine 1, 1 hour on machine 2, and 3 hours on machine 3. Each unit of product B requires 1 hour on machine 1, 3 hours on machine 2, and 2 hours on machine 4. The company has a maximum of 50 labor hours available per day. The profit for each unit of product A is $10 and for each unit of product B is $12. The company wants to maximize its profit. \nHow many units of each product should the company produce in a day to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe labor constraints for each machine are as follows:\n\nMachine 1: 2x + y ≤ 50 (1)\nMachine 2: x + 3y ≤ 50 (2)\nMachine 3: 3x ≤ 50 (3)\nMachine 4: 2y ≤ 50 (4)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 12y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the inequalities.\n\nFrom (3), we get x ≤ 50/3 ≈ 16.67. So, the maximum value of x is 16.\n\nFrom (4), we get y ≤ 50/2 = 25. So, the maximum value of y is 25.\n\nNow, we need to check the corner points of the feasible region to find the maximum profit.\n\nCorner points are (0,0), (0,25), (16,0), and the intersection of (1) and (2).\n\nTo find the intersection of (1) and (2), we can solve the system of equations:\n\n2x + y = 50\nx + 3y = 50\n\nSolving this system, we get x = 10 and y = 20/3 ≈ 6.67.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n(0,0): Profit = 10(0) + 12(0) = $0\n(0,25): Profit = 10(0) + 12(25) = $300\n(16,0): Profit = 10(16) + 12(0) = $160\n(10,6.67): Profit = 10(10) + 12(6.67) ≈ $100 + $80 = $180\n\nThe maximum profit is $300, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 25 units of product B."
