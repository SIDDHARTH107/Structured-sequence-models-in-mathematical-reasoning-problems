    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P, we need to diagonalize the matrix A. We start by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues of A:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [2-λ 1; 1 3-λ]\n\ndet(A - λI) = (2-λ)(3-λ) - (1)(1) = λ^2 - 5λ + 5\n\nTo find the roots of the characteristic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nλ = (5 ± √(5^2 - 4(5)))/2 = (5 ± √(25 - 20))/2 = (5 ± √5)/2\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = (5 + √5)/2 and λ2 = (5 - √5)/2.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors of A:\nFor each eigenvalue, we need to find the eigenvectors by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nFor λ1 = (5 + √5)/2:\n\n(A - λ1I)v1 = [(2 - (5 + √5)/2) 1; 1 (3 - (5 + √5)/2)]v1 = [(-1 - √5)/2 1; 1 (-1 - √5)/2]v1 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite the system of equations as:\n\n((-1 - √5)/2)x + y = 0\nx + ((-1 - √5)/2)y = 0\n\nSolving this system, we get x = y. So, we can choose v1 = [1; 1] as an eigenvector for λ1.\n\nFor λ2 = (5 - √5)/2:\n\n(A - λ2I)v2 = [(2 - (5 - √5)/2) 1; 1 (3 - (5 - √5)/2)]v2 = [(-1 + √5)/2 1; 1 (-1 + √5)/2]v2 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite the system of equations as:\n\n((-1 + √5)/2)x + y = 0\nx + ((-1 + √5)/2)y = 0\n\nSolving this system, we get x = -y. So, we can choose v2 = [1; -1] as an eigenvector for λ2.\n\n3. Construct the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P:\n\nThe diagonal matrix D consists of the eigenvalues λ1 and λ2 on the diagonal:\n\nD = [(5 + √5)/2 0; 0 (5 - √5)/2]\n\nThe invertible matrix P consists of the eigenvectors v1 and v2 as columns:\n\nP = [1 1; 1 -1]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of P, denoted as P^-1:\n\nP^-1 = (1/det(P)) * adj(P) = (1/(-2)) * [-1 -1; 1 1] = [1/2 1/2; -1/2 -1/2]\n\nNow, we can check if A = PDP^-1:\n\nPDP^-1 = [1 1; 1 -1] * [(5 + √5)/2 0; 0 (5 - √5)/2] * [1/2 1/2; -1/2 -1/2]\n\nPDP^-1 = [1 1; 1 -1] * [(5 + √5)/4 + (5 - √5)/4 (5 + √5)/4 - (5 - √5)/4; (5 + √5)/4 - (5 - √5)/4 (5 + √5)/4 + (5 - √5)/4]\n\nPDP^-1 = [1 1; 1 -1] * [2 1; 1 3]\n\nPDP^-1 = [2 1; 1 3] = A\n\nSo, we have found the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P such that A = PDP^-1:\n\nD = [(5 + √5)/2 0; 0 (5 - √5)/2]\nP = [1 1; 1 -1]"
