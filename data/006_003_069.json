    "message_2": "In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, there are 4 Kings and 4 Queens. To find the probability of drawing either a King or a Queen, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 4 (Kings) + 4 (Queens) = 8, and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (total cards in the deck).\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a King or a Queen is:\n\nProbability = 8/52 = 2/13 â‰ˆ 0.1538 or 15.38%."
