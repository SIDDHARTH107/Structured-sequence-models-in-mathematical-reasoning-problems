    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2x+1)/(x-3) = (5x+2)/(x+2), we will first eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying.\n\n(2x + 1)(x + 2) = (5x + 2)(x - 3)\n\nNow, we will expand both sides of the equation:\n\n2x^2 + 4x + x + 2 = 5x^2 - 15x + 2x - 6\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x^2 + 5x + 2 = 5x^2 - 13x - 6\n\nNow, move all terms to one side of the equation:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 18x - 8\n\nNow, we will try to factor the quadratic equation:\n\n0 = 3(x^2 - 6x - 8/3)\n\nUnfortunately, the quadratic does not factor nicely, so we will use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -18, and c = -8/3.\n\nx = (18 ± √((-18)^2 - 4(3)(-8/3))) / (2(3))\n\nx = (18 ± √(324 + 32)) / 6\n\nx = (18 ± √(356)) / 6\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (18 + √(356)) / 6\n\nx = (18 - √(356)) / 6\n\nThese are the two solutions for x in the given equation."
