    "message_2": "To find the volume of the water in the tank at that moment, we can use the method of integration. We will integrate the area of the circular cross-sections of the tank with respect to the height.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation for the area of the circular cross-sections. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius is constant and equal to 5 meters. So, the area of the circular cross-sections is A(h) = π(5^2) = 25π square meters, where h is the height.\n\nNow, we will integrate the area function with respect to the height from 0 to 6 meters (since the water level is at a height of 6 meters):\n\nV = ∫(A(h) dh) from 0 to 6\nV = ∫(25π dh) from 0 to 6\n\nNow, integrate:\n\nV = 25π * ∫(dh) from 0 to 6\n\nThe integral of dh is h, so:\n\nV = 25π * (h) evaluated from 0 to 6\n\nNow, evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nV = 25π * (6 - 0)\n\nV = 25π * 6\n\nV = 150π cubic meters\n\nSo, the volume of the water in the tank at that moment is 150π cubic meters."
