    "message_1": "A torus has a mean radius of 7 cm and a circular cross-section radius of 3 cm. What is the volume of the torus?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * cross-section radius²) * (2π * mean radius)\n\nIn this case, the mean radius is 7 cm and the cross-section radius is 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (π * 3²) * (2π * 7)\nVolume = (π * 9) * (14π)\nVolume = 126π²\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is approximately 126π² cubic centimeters, or approximately 1239.76 cubic centimeters."
