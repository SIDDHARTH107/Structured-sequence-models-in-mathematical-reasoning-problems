    "message_1": "Using abductive logic, if the sum of two numbers is 11 and their product is 24, what are the two numbers?",
    "message_2": "Let the two numbers be x and y. We are given that:\n\nx + y = 11\nx * y = 24\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y. From the first equation, we can express y as:\n\ny = 11 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the second equation:\n\nx * (11 - x) = 24\n\nExpand and rearrange the equation:\n\nx^2 - 11x + 24 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve by factoring:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 8) = 0\n\nThe solutions for x are 3 and 8. Since y = 11 - x, the corresponding values for y are 8 and 3. Therefore, the two numbers are 3 and 8."
