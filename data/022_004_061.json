    "message_2": "First, we need to find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z+1)/(z^3-3z^2+2z). To do this, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero.\n\nDenominator: z^3 - 3z^2 + 2z = 0\n\nWe can factor out a z from the expression:\n\nz(z^2 - 3z + 2) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic expression:\n\nz(z - 1)(z - 2) = 0\n\nSo, the singularities are z = 0, z = 1, and z = 2.\n\nNow, we need to classify each singularity as removable, pole, or essential.\n\n1. z = 0:\n\nTo determine the type of singularity at z = 0, we can try to simplify the function by canceling out any common factors between the numerator and the denominator:\n\nf(z) = (z+1)/(z(z-1)(z-2))\n\nSince there are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator at z = 0, this singularity is a pole.\n\n2. z = 1:\n\nAgain, we can try to simplify the function:\n\nf(z) = (z+1)/(z(z-1)(z-2))\n\nSince there are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator at z = 1, this singularity is also a pole.\n\n3. z = 2:\n\nOne more time, we can try to simplify the function:\n\nf(z) = (z+1)/(z(z-1)(z-2))\n\nSince there are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator at z = 2, this singularity is also a pole.\n\nIn conclusion, all three singularities (z = 0, z = 1, and z = 2) are poles."
