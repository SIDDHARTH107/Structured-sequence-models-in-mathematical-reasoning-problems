You have a budget of $100,000 to invest in these options. Using optimization techniques, find the optimal portfolio that maximizes your expected rate of return while minimizing your risk. \n\nHere are the details of the investment options:\n\n| Investment Option | Expected Rate of Return (%) | Risk (Variance) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Option A | 6 | 16 |\n| Option B | 8 | 4 |\n| Option C | 2 | 9 |\n| Option D | 10 | 25 |\n| Option E | 4 | 36 |\n\nAssume that the covariance between each pair of investment options is known and provided.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) developed by Harry Markowitz. MPT is an optimization technique that helps to find the optimal portfolio that maximizes the expected rate of return while minimizing the risk (variance).\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n\n- x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D, x_E: The proportion of the total budget invested in each option (A, B, C, D, E)\n- R_A, R_B, R_C, R_D, R_E: The expected rate of return for each option (A, B, C, D, E)\n- σ²_A, σ²_B, σ²_C, σ²_D, σ²_E: The risk (variance) for each option (A, B, C, D, E)\n- Cov_ij: The covariance between investment options i and j\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the expected rate of return of the portfolio:\n\nR_p = x_A * R_A + x_B * R_B + x_C * R_C + x_D * R_D + x_E * R_E\n\nThe objective function to minimize is the risk (variance) of the portfolio:\n\nσ²_p = x_A² * σ²_A + x_B² * σ²_B + x_C² * σ²_C + x_D² * σ²_D + x_E² * σ²_E + 2 * (x_A * x_B * Cov_AB + x_A * x_C * Cov_AC + ...)\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nx_A + x_B + x_C + x_D + x_E = 1 (The sum of the proportions invested in each option must be equal to 1)\nx_A, x_B, x_C, x_D, x_E >= 0 (The proportion invested in each option must be non-negative)\n\nGiven the covariance matrix, we can use optimization techniques such as quadratic programming or the efficient frontier method to find the optimal portfolio.\n\nHowever, since the covariance matrix is not provided, we cannot proceed further with the calculations. If you provide the covariance matrix, we can continue with the optimization process to find the optimal portfolio."
