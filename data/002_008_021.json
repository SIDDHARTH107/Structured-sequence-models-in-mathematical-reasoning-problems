    "message_2": "The formula for the volume of a right circular cone is V = (1/3)πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nGiven a radius of 5 cm and a height of 12 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nV = (1/3)π(5)^2(12)\nV = (1/3)π(25)(12)\nV = (1/3)(300π)\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nV ≈ (1/3)(300)(3.14)\nV ≈ (100)(3.14)\nV ≈ 314\n\nSo, the volume of the right circular cone is approximately 314 cubic centimeters."
