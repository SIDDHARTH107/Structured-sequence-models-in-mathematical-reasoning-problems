    "message_2": "To determine the frequency response of the network, we need to find the relationship between the Fourier transforms of the input and output signals.\n\nFirst, let's find the Fourier transform of the input signal f(t) = cos(3t) + sin(6t). The Fourier transform of a cosine function is given by:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2)π[δ(ω - ω₀) + δ(ω + ω₀)]\n\nwhere δ is the Dirac delta function and ω₀ is the frequency of the cosine function. Similarly, the Fourier transform of a sine function is given by:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2j)π[δ(ω - ω₀) - δ(ω + ω₀)]\n\nApplying these formulas to f(t), we get:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2)π[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)] + (1/2j)π[δ(ω - 6) - δ(ω + 6)]\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of the output signal g(t) = 2cos(3t) - cos(9t) + 3sin(6t). Applying the same formulas, we get:\n\nG(ω) = π[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)] - (1/2)π[δ(ω - 9) + δ(ω + 9)] + (3/2j)π[δ(ω - 6) - δ(ω + 6)]\n\nNow, we can find the frequency response H(ω) of the network by dividing the Fourier transform of the output signal G(ω) by the Fourier transform of the input signal F(ω):\n\nH(ω) = G(ω) / F(ω)\n\nH(ω) = [π[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)] - (1/2)π[δ(ω - 9) + δ(ω + 9)] + (3/2j)π[δ(ω - 6) - δ(ω + 6)]] / [(1/2)π[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)] + (1/2j)π[δ(ω - 6) - δ(ω + 6)]]\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can consider each frequency component separately:\n\n1. For ω = ±3:\nH(ω) = [π[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)]] / [(1/2)π[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)]] = 2\n\n2. For ω = ±6:\nH(ω) = [(3/2j)π[δ(ω - 6) - δ(ω + 6)]] / [(1/2j)π[δ(ω - 6) - δ(ω + 6)]] = 3\n\n3. For ω = ±9:\nH(ω) = [-(1/2)π[δ(ω - 9) + δ(ω + 9)]] / [(1/2)π[δ(ω - 3) + δ(ω + 3)] + (1/2j)π[δ(ω - 6) - δ(ω + 6)]] = 0\n\nSo, the frequency response H(ω) of the network is:\n\nH(ω) = 2 for ω = ±3\nH(ω) = 3 for ω = ±6\nH(ω) = 0 for ω = ±9\nH(ω) = 0 for all other ω\n\nThis means that the network amplifies the frequency components at ω = ±3 by a factor of 2, at ω = ±6 by a factor of 3, and attenuates the frequency components at ω = ±9 and all other frequencies."
