    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(2x-3) - 5 = -2, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the square root term.\nAdd 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\n√(2x-3) - 5 + 5 = -2 + 5\n√(2x-3) = 3\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n(√(2x-3))^2 = 3^2\n2x - 3 = 9\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nAdd 3 to both sides of the equation:\n\n2x - 3 + 3 = 9 + 3\n2x = 12\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n2x / 2 = 12 / 2\nx = 6\n\nSo, the solution to the equation √(2x-3) - 5 = -2 is x = 6."
