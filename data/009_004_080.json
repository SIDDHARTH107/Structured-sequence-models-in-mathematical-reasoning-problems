    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation, we first find the characteristic equation:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nThis equation has complex roots:\n\nr = ±2i\n\nThe general solution for a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with complex roots is given by:\n\ny(t) = e^(αt) * (A * cos(βt) + B * sin(βt))\n\nIn our case, α = 0 and β = 2, so the general solution is:\n\ny(t) = A * cos(2t) + B * sin(2t)\n\nNow, we use the initial conditions to find the constants A and B.\n\n1) y(0) = 3:\n\n3 = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0)\n3 = A * 1 + B * 0\nA = 3\n\n2) y'(t) = -2A * sin(2t) + 2B * cos(2t)\n\ny'(0) = -2:\n\n-2 = -2 * 3 * sin(0) + 2B * cos(0)\n-2 = 0 + 2B * 1\nB = -1\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\ny(t) = 3 * cos(2t) - sin(2t)\n\nNow, we find the amplitude and period of the resulting oscillation.\n\nAmplitude:\n\nA = √(A^2 + B^2) = √(3^2 + (-1)^2) = √(9 + 1) = √10\n\nPeriod:\n\nThe period of a simple harmonic oscillator is given by:\n\nT = 2π / ω\n\nIn our case, ω = 2, so the period is:\n\nT = 2π / 2 = π\n\nThus, the amplitude of the resulting oscillation is √10 and the period is π."
