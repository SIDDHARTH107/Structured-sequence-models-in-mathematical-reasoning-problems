    "message_1": "In a particular neighborhood, the probability of a burglary occurring on any given day is 0.05. What is the probability that there will be at least one burglary in the neighborhood over a 30-day period?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability concept. Instead of finding the probability of at least one burglary, we will find the probability of no burglaries occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no burglary occurring on any given day is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor no burglaries to occur over a 30-day period, this would have to happen 30 times in a row. So, the probability of no burglaries in 30 days is 0.95^30.\n\n0.95^30 ≈ 0.214\n\nNow, we will find the complementary probability, which is the probability of at least one burglary occurring in the 30-day period.\n\n1 - 0.214 ≈ 0.786\n\nSo, the probability of at least one burglary occurring in the neighborhood over a 30-day period is approximately 0.786 or 78.6%."
