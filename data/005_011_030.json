What is the probability that the sample of 50 bulbs will contain at least 5 defective bulbs, if the population has a 10% rate of defective bulbs?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective bulbs in the sample\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k defective bulbs from n bulbs (in our case, n = 50)\n- p is the probability of a bulb being defective (10% or 0.1)\n- n is the total number of bulbs in the sample (50)\n- k is the number of defective bulbs\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 5 defective bulbs, which means we need to find the probability of having 5, 6, 7, ..., 50 defective bulbs. To do this, we can calculate the probability of having 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 defective bulbs, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X >= 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)]\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each case:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(50, 0) * (0.1)^0 * (0.9)^50\nP(X = 1) = C(50, 1) * (0.1)^1 * (0.9)^49\nP(X = 2) = C(50, 2) * (0.1)^2 * (0.9)^48\nP(X = 3) = C(50, 3) * (0.1)^3 * (0.9)^47\nP(X = 4) = C(50, 4) * (0.1)^4 * (0.9)^46\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute these values:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.0000\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.0003\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.0072\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.0574\nP(X = 4) ≈ 0.1878\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least 5 defective bulbs:\n\nP(X >= 5) = 1 - [0.0000 + 0.0003 + 0.0072 + 0.0574 + 0.1878] ≈ 1 - 0.2527 ≈ 0.7473\n\nSo, the probability that the sample of 50 bulbs will contain at least 5 defective bulbs is approximately 74.73%."
