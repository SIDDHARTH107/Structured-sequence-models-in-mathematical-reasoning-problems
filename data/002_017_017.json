    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one triangle, then multiply it by the number of triangles (6 in this case).\n\nAn equilateral triangle has all sides equal, so the side length of each triangle is also 6 cm. To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (side^2 * √3) / 4\n\nArea of one triangle = (6^2 * √3) / 4\nArea of one triangle = (36 * √3) / 4\nArea of one triangle = 9√3 cm^2\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one triangle by the number of triangles in the hexagon:\n\nArea of hexagon = 6 * (9√3 cm^2)\nArea of hexagon = 54√3 cm^2\n\nSo, the area of the regular hexagon is 54√3 cm^2."
