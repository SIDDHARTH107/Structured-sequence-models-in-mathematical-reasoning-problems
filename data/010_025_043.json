    "message_1": "Consider a topological quantum field theory TQFT which assigns a non-negative real number Z(M) to a closed 3-manifold M. Let M be a closed connected 3-manifold and let S be a closed connected surface embedded in M such that the complement of S in M is a solid torus. Suppose that the restriction of TQFT to the solid torus is trivial. Prove that Z(M) = Z(S)Z(T), where T is the 3-manifold obtained by Dehn surgery on S. \n\nWith this information, calculate Z(T) if Z(M)=5 and Z(S)=2.",
    "message_2": "To prove that Z(M) = Z(S)Z(T), we will use the properties of TQFT and the given information about the restriction of TQFT to the solid torus.\n\nSince the restriction of TQFT to the solid torus is trivial, we know that Z(solid torus) = 1. Now, consider cutting M along the surface S. This will result in two 3-manifolds: one is the solid torus, and the other is the 3-manifold T obtained by Dehn surgery on S.\n\nBy the properties of TQFT, we have that Z(M) = Z(solid torus) * Z(T). Since Z(solid torus) = 1, we have Z(M) = Z(T).\n\nNow, consider cutting T along the surface S. This will result in two 3-manifolds: one is the solid torus, and the other is the original 3-manifold M. Again, by the properties of TQFT, we have that Z(T) = Z(solid torus) * Z(M). Since Z(solid torus) = 1, we have Z(T) = Z(M).\n\nThus, we have shown that Z(M) = Z(T). Now, we can express Z(M) as Z(S)Z(T) by substituting Z(T) = Z(M) into the equation Z(T) = Z(solid torus) * Z(M). This gives us Z(M) = Z(S)Z(M), as desired.\n\nNow, we are given that Z(M) = 5 and Z(S) = 2. We can use the equation Z(M) = Z(S)Z(T) to find Z(T):\n\n5 = 2 * Z(T)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nZ(T) = 5/2 = 2.5\n\nSo, Z(T) = 2.5."
