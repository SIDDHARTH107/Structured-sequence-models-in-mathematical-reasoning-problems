    "message_2": "Case 1: ab = ba\n\nSince a ≠ e and b ≠ e, we know that a and b are non-identity elements in G. Since G has order 4, there are only two other elements in G, which we will call c and d. Now, consider the element ab. Since ab = ba, we can write the following:\n\na^2 = ab * a^(-1) = ba * a^(-1) = b * (a * a^(-1)) = b * e = b\nb^2 = b * a * b^(-1) = ab * b^(-1) = a * (b * b^(-1)) = a * e = a\n\nNow, since a^2 = b and b^2 = a, we can compute the following:\n\na^4 = (a^2)^2 = b^2 = a\nb^4 = (b^2)^2 = a^2 = b\n\nSince a^4 = a and b^4 = b, we know that a^3 = e and b^3 = e. Therefore, G is generated by the element a * b, which has order 4. Thus, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4.\n\nCase 2: ab ≠ ba\n\nIn this case, we will show that G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4. Since a ≠ e and b ≠ e, we know that a and b are non-identity elements in G. Since G has order 4, there are only two other elements in G, which we will call c and d. Now, consider the element ab. Since ab ≠ ba, we know that ab is not equal to a or b. Thus, ab must be equal to either c or d. Without loss of generality, let ab = c. Then, the elements of G are {e, a, b, c}.\n\nNow, we will show that a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. First, notice that (ab)^2 = abab = a(ba)b = a(ab)b = acb. Since acb ≠ a and acb ≠ b (otherwise, ab would be equal to a or b, which contradicts our assumption), we must have (ab)^2 = e. Thus, acb = e, and c = a^(-1)b^(-1).\n\nNow, we compute a^2:\n\na^2 = a * a = a * (a^(-1)b^(-1)c) = (aa^(-1))(b^(-1)c) = e * (b^(-1)c) = b^(-1)c\n\nSince a^2 ≠ a and a^2 ≠ b, we must have a^2 = e. Similarly, we can compute b^2:\n\nb^2 = b * b = b * (a^(-1)c^(-1)a) = (ba^(-1))(c^(-1)a) = (ab)(c^(-1)a) = ca\n\nSince b^2 ≠ b and b^2 ≠ a, we must have b^2 = e. Finally, we compute c^2:\n\nc^2 = c * c = (a^(-1)b^(-1))(a^(-1)b^(-1)) = a^(-1)(b^(-1)a^(-1))b^(-1) = a^(-1)(a^2)b^(-1) = a^(-1)eb^(-1) = a^(-1)b^(-1)\n\nSince c^2 ≠ a and c^2 ≠ b, we must have c^2 = e. Thus, G has the property that a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e, which is the defining property of the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4."
