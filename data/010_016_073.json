    "message_2": "The intersection number of two circles $S^1_1$ and $S^1_2$ on a surface $S$ can be computed using their Poincaré duals $a$ and $b$. The intersection number is given by the cup product of the Poincaré duals, which can be denoted as:\n\nIntersection number = $a \\smile b$\n\nHere, $\\smile$ represents the cup product operation. The result of this operation is an integer, which represents the intersection number of the two circles on the surface $S$. If the intersection number is positive, it means the circles intersect, and if it is zero, it means the circles do not intersect."
