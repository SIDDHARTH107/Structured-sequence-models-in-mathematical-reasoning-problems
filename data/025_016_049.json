    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth projective algebraic variety defined over a field k with the function field k(X). Suppose there exists a birational map f : X --> Y , where Y is another algebraic variety. Let K(X) be the field of rational functions on X and K(Y) be the field of rational functions on Y. If dim(k(X)) = 3, dim(K(Y)) = 4 and dim(k(Y)) = 2, what is the maximum possible degree of the field extension K(Y)/K(X)?",
    "message_2": "Since f is a birational map between X and Y, it induces an isomorphism between the function fields K(X) and K(Y). This means that K(X) and K(Y) are isomorphic as fields, so their dimensions as vector spaces over k are equal. Therefore, we have dim(K(X)) = dim(K(Y)).\n\nNow, let's consider the field extension K(Y)/K(X). Since K(X) and K(Y) are isomorphic, the degree of this field extension is 1. In other words, the maximum possible degree of the field extension K(Y)/K(X) is 1."
