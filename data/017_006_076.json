    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 35. Since 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers, we can apply the Sylow theorems.\n\nBy the first Sylow theorem, there exist subgroups of G of orders 5 and 7, which we will denote as H and K, respectively. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups divides 7 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is that there is exactly one 5-Sylow subgroup, H. Similarly, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 7, so there is exactly one 7-Sylow subgroup, K.\n\nSince H and K are the only subgroups of their respective orders and they are both normal (by the second Sylow theorem), we can consider their intersection. Notice that the intersection of H and K, H ∩ K, is a subgroup of both H and K. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of H ∩ K must divide the orders of both H and K. Since 5 and 7 are prime and have no common divisors other than 1, the order of H ∩ K must be 1. Thus, H ∩ K is the trivial group, containing only the identity element.\n\nNow, consider the product of elements from H and K. For any h ∈ H and k ∈ K, the product hk is an element of G. Since H and K are normal subgroups, we have that gH = Hg and gK = Kg for all g ∈ G. Therefore, the set {hk : h ∈ H, k ∈ K} contains all elements of G, and we can say that G = HK.\n\nFinally, we can show that G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K. Define a function φ: H × K → G by φ(h, k) = hk. We will show that φ is an isomorphism.\n\n1. φ is well-defined: For any (h, k) ∈ H × K, hk ∈ G, so φ(h, k) is well-defined.\n\n2. φ is a homomorphism: For any (h1, k1), (h2, k2) ∈ H × K, we have φ((h1, k1)(h2, k2)) = φ(h1h2, k1k2) = h1h2k1k2. Since H and K are normal, we can rearrange this product as h1k1h2k2 = φ(h1, k1)φ(h2, k2).\n\n3. φ is injective: Suppose φ(h, k) = e, where e is the identity element in G. Then hk = e, which implies that h = k^(-1). Since h ∈ H and k^(-1) ∈ K, their intersection is nontrivial, which contradicts our earlier finding that H ∩ K is trivial. Therefore, φ(h, k) = e only if h = e_H and k = e_K, where e_H and e_K are the identity elements in H and K, respectively.\n\n4. φ is surjective: Since G = HK, for any g ∈ G, there exist h ∈ H and k ∈ K such that g = hk. Thus, φ(h, k) = g, and φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a well-defined homomorphism that is both injective and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 35 is either cyclic (if H and K are not distinct) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7 (if H and K are distinct)."
