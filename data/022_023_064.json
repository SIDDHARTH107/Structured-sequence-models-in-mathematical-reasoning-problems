(Hint: The wire can be represented by a complex function, and the center and radius can be found by using properties of circles.)",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the radius of the circle. Since the wire forms a quarter-circle, the length of the wire is equal to 1/4 of the circumference of the circle. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius. Therefore, we have:\n\n14 = (1/4) * 2πr\n14 = (1/2)πr\n\nNow, we can solve for the radius r:\n\nr = 14 / (1/2)π\nr = 28 / π ≈ 8.92 cm\n\nNow, let's use complex analysis to find the center of the circle. We can represent the quarter-circle as a complex function in the complex plane. The quarter-circle starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at the point (r,0), where r is the radius we found earlier.\n\nThe quarter-circle can be represented by the complex function f(z) = z, where z is a complex number. The quarter-circle lies on the real axis from 0 to r, and then on the imaginary axis from 0 to ri, where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe center of the circle will be the point where the real and imaginary parts are equal. Let's call this point (a, ai), where a is a real number. Since the quarter-circle is symmetric, the center will be equidistant from the origin and the point (r,0). Therefore, we have:\n\na = r/2\na = 8.92 / 2 ≈ 4.46 cm\n\nSo, the center of the circle is at the point (4.46, 4.46i) in the complex plane, and the radius of the circle is approximately 8.92 cm."
