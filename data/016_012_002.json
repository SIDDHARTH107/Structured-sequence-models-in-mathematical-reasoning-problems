    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a square. It is constructed iteratively, with each level being a more detailed version of the curve.\n\nAt level 1, the Peano curve consists of 9 segments, each with a length of 1/3 of the side of the square. So, the total length at level 1 is 9 * (1/3) = 3.\n\nAt each subsequent level, each segment of the curve is replaced by a scaled-down version of the level 1 curve. This means that the number of segments in the curve is multiplied by 9, and the length of each segment is divided by 3.\n\nSo, at level 4, the total length of the Peano curve is:\n\n(9^4) * (1/3)^4 = 6561 * (1/81) = 81.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the Peano curve generated by applying the construction process up to level 4 is 81."
