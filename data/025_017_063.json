Suppose that f:X->Y is a birational contraction such that the relative Picard rank of the induced fibration g: Y->Z is one, where Z is a smooth projective curve. \n\nLet's consider the pairs (Y,B_Y) and (Z,B_Z) where B_Y and B_Z are the discriminant divisors of the relative canonical sheaf K_Y and K_Z respectively. Let's denote by d_Y and d_Z the degrees of B_Y and B_Z respectively with respect to the line bundle f_*L. \n\nFind the minimum value of deg(f_*L) in terms of d_Y and d_Z.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of deg(f_*L) in terms of d_Y and d_Z, we can use the following formula:\n\ndeg(f_*L) = d_Y * d_Z / gcd(d_Y, d_Z)\n\nHere, gcd(d_Y, d_Z) denotes the greatest common divisor of d_Y and d_Z.\n\nThe minimum value of deg(f_*L) occurs when gcd(d_Y, d_Z) = 1, which means that d_Y and d_Z are coprime. In this case, the minimum value of deg(f_*L) is simply the product of d_Y and d_Z:\n\nmin(deg(f_*L)) = d_Y * d_Z"
