    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4, 5}. Find the following sets:\n1. AxB \n2. (A compliment)xB compliment \n3. A compliment x B compliment \n4. (AxB) compliment \n5. AxB compliment \nShow that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "1. AxB\nThe Cartesian product AxB is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. So, AxB = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}\n\n2. (A compliment)xB compliment\nFirst, we need to find the complements of A and B. Since we don't have a universal set defined, we cannot determine the complements of A and B. Therefore, we cannot find (A compliment)xB compliment.\n\n3. A compliment x B compliment\nAs mentioned in the previous point, we cannot determine the complements of A and B without a universal set. Therefore, we cannot find A compliment x B compliment.\n\n4. (AxB) compliment\nAgain, we need a universal set to determine the complement of AxB. Without a universal set, we cannot find (AxB) compliment.\n\n5. AxB compliment\nAs mentioned earlier, we cannot determine the complement of B without a universal set. Therefore, we cannot find AxB compliment.\n\nTo show that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement, we need to show that A x (B ∪ B') ≠ (A x B) ∪ (A x B') for some sets A, B, and B'. Since we don't have a universal set defined, we cannot determine the complements of the sets and prove this property."
