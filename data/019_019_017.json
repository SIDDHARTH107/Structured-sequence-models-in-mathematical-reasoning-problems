    "message_1": "Consider the set of all binary strings, where each string is either accepted or rejected by a given Turing machine. Suppose that there are 30 distinct strings that are accepted by at least one Turing machine in this set, and that two Turing machines always accept the same set of strings. How many distinct Turing machines are there in this set?",
    "message_2": "Since there are 30 distinct strings that can be accepted by Turing machines in this set, we can think of each Turing machine as a subset of these 30 strings. The total number of possible subsets of a set with 30 elements is 2^30 (including the empty set).\n\nHowever, the problem states that two Turing machines always accept the same set of strings. This means that for each subset of accepted strings, there is exactly one Turing machine that accepts it. Therefore, there are 2^30 distinct Turing machines in this set."
