    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products, A and B. The profit per unit of product A is $10 and for product B it is $12. The company has 500 hours of production time available and each unit of product A takes 5 hours to produce whereas product B takes 8 hours to produce. What is the optimal number of units of each product that should be produced to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nProfit = 10x + 12y\n\nThe constraint for the production time is:\n5x + 8y ≤ 500\n\nTo find the optimal number of units of each product, we will use the graphical method. First, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraint.\n\nRearrange the constraint equation to solve for y:\ny ≤ (500 - 5x) / 8\n\nNow we need to find the vertices of the feasible region. The feasible region is bounded by the axes and the constraint line. The vertices are the points where the constraint line intersects the axes.\n\n1. When x = 0:\ny ≤ (500 - 5(0)) / 8\ny ≤ 500 / 8\ny ≤ 62.5\n\n2. When y = 0:\nx ≤ 500 / 5\nx ≤ 100\n\nThe intersection point of the constraint line and the axes is (0, 62.5) and (100, 0).\n\nNow we need to evaluate the objective function at these vertices to find the maximum profit:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 62.5) = 10(0) + 12(62.5) = $750\n2. Profit at (100, 0) = 10(100) + 12(0) = $1000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (100, 0), which means the company should produce 100 units of product A and 0 units of product B to maximize their profit."
