    "message_1": "A cylinder has a height of 8 cm and a radius of 5 cm. What is the surface area of the cylinder in square centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is:\n\nSurface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven the height (h) is 8 cm and the radius (r) is 5 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2π(5)² + 2π(5)(8)\n\nSurface Area = 2π(25) + 2π(40)\n\nSurface Area = 50π + 80π\n\nSurface Area = 130π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 130 * 3.14\n\nSurface Area ≈ 408.2 square centimeters\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately 408.2 square centimeters."
