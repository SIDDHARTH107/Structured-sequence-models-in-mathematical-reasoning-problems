    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake or Peano-Gosper curve, is a fractal curve that can be constructed using a recursive process. The total length of the curve at each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (initial length) * (scaling factor) ^ (number of iterations)\n\nFor the Gosper curve, the initial length is 1, and the scaling factor is 3^(1/2), which is approximately 1.73205080757.\n\nTo find the total length of the Gosper curve at iteration 5, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (1.73205080757) ^ 5\n\nLength ≈ 1 * 9.00000000000\n\nLength ≈ 9\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve at iteration 5 is approximately 9 units."
