    "message_2": "The Peano Curve is a space-filling curve, meaning it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a unit square. However, it is important to note that the Peano Curve is a fractal, and its construction involves an infinite number of iterations.\n\nAs the number of iterations approaches infinity, the length of the Peano Curve also approaches infinity. Therefore, the length of the Peano Curve in a unit square is infinite."
