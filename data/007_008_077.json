    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p.\n\nIn our case, p = 31 (which is a prime number) and a = 16. According to Fermat's Little Theorem, we have:\n\n16^31 ≡ 16 (mod 31)\n\nSo, the remainder when 16^31 is divided by 31 is 16."
