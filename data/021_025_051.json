    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of humpback whales. It is used to find the global minimum or maximum of complex functions. However, as a mathematician, I will provide you with a mathematical approach to find the global minimum of the given function within the interval [0, 5].\n\nFunction: f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x - 10\n\nFirst, find the first derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 4\n\nNext, find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -12, and c = 4:\n\nx = (12 ± √((-12)² - 4(3)(4))) / (2 * 3)\nx = (12 ± √(144 - 48)) / 6\nx = (12 ± √96) / 6\n\nThis gives us two critical points:\n\nx1 = (12 + √96) / 6 ≈ 4.79\nx2 = (12 - √96) / 6 ≈ 0.21\n\nNow, find the second derivative of the function:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nEvaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n\nf''(x1) = 6(4.79) - 12 ≈ 16.74 > 0 (This indicates a local minimum)\nf''(x2) = 6(0.21) - 12 ≈ -11.74 < 0 (This indicates a local maximum)\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the interval [0, 5]:\n\nf(0) = 0^3 - 6(0)^2 + 4(0) - 10 = -10\nf(5) = 5^3 - 6(5)^2 + 4(5) - 10 = -35\n\nFinally, compare the function values at the local minimum and the interval endpoints:\n\nf(x1) ≈ -25.17\nf(0) = -10\nf(5) = -35\n\nThe global minimum within the interval [0, 5] is f(5) = -35, which occurs at x = 5."
