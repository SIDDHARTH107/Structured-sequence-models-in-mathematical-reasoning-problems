    "message_2": "There is only one ace of spades in a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing an ace of spades is 1 out of 52, which can be represented as a fraction:\n\n1/52\n\nAs a decimal, this is approximately:\n\n0.01923\n\nSo the probability of drawing an ace of spades from a standard deck of 52 playing cards is approximately 1.923%."
