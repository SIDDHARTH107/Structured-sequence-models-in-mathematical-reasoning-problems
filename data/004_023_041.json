    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the two curves, we need to find the integral of the difference between the two functions over the given interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the difference between the two functions:\ny = (2x - x^2) - x^2\ny = 2x - 2x^2\n\nNow, we'll integrate this function over the interval [0, 2]:\n\nâˆ«(2x - 2x^2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nUsing the power rule for integration, we get:\n\n[ x^2 - (2/3)x^3 ] from 0 to 2\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n(2^2 - (2/3)(2^3)) - (0^2 - (2/3)(0^3))\n= (4 - (2/3)(8)) - (0)\n= 4 - (16/3)\n= (12 - 16)/3\n= -4/3\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we'll take the absolute value of the result:\n\nArea = |-4/3| = 4/3\n\nSo, the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - x^2 over the interval x = 0 to x = 2 is 4/3 square units."
