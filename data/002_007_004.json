    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 units and a bottom base of 10 units. Its top base measures 6 units and the length of one of its legs is 7 units. Find the area of the trapezoid.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the sum of the bases is the length of the top base plus the length of the bottom base, which is 6 units + 10 units = 16 units. The height is given as 8 units.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (16 units) * (8 units)\n\nArea = 8 * 8 unitsÂ²\n\nArea = 64 square units\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 64 square units."
