    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it consists of elements that are unique to each set.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFor sets A and B given:\n\nA = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 }\nB = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 }\n\nFirst, we find the union of A and B:\n\nA ∪ B = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }\n\nNext, we find the intersection of A and B:\n\nA ∩ B = { } (since A and B have no common elements)\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 } - { }\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of A and B is:\n\nA Δ B = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }\n\nNow, we need to prove that the symmetric difference is commutative. This means that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nWe already know that A Δ B = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }. Let's find B Δ A:\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nThe union of B and A is the same as the union of A and B:\n\nB ∪ A = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }\n\nThe intersection of B and A is the same as the intersection of A and B:\n\nB ∩ A = { }\n\nSo, B Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 } - { }\n\nThus, B Δ A = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }\n\nSince A Δ B = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 } and B Δ A = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }, we can conclude that the symmetric difference is commutative:\n\nA Δ B = B Δ A"
