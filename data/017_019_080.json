    "message_2": "To find all possible non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we first note that 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. We can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of these groups.\n\n1. Cyclic group: If there exists an element of order 36, then the group is cyclic. This group is isomorphic to Z_36.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: If there are elements of order 4 and 9, but no element of order 36, then the group is isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_9.\n\n3. Semidirect product of Z_9 by Z_4: If there is an element of order 4 that does not commute with an element of order 9, then the group is a non-abelian semidirect product of Z_9 by Z_4. There are two such groups, depending on the action of Z_4 on Z_9.\n\n4. Direct product of Z_2 × Z_2 and Z_9: If there are elements of order 2 and 9, but no element of order 4, then the group is isomorphic to (Z_2 × Z_2) × Z_9.\n\n5. Semidirect product of Z_9 by Z_2 × Z_2: If there is an element of order 2 that does not commute with an element of order 9, then the group is a non-abelian semidirect product of Z_9 by Z_2 × Z_2. There are two such groups, depending on the action of Z_2 × Z_2 on Z_9.\n\n6. Direct product of Z_4 and Z_3 × Z_3: If there are elements of order 4 and 3, but no element of order 9, then the group is isomorphic to Z_4 × (Z_3 × Z_3).\n\n7. Semidirect product of Z_3 × Z_3 by Z_4: If there is an element of order 4 that does not commute with an element of order 3, then the group is a non-abelian semidirect product of Z_3 × Z_3 by Z_4. There are two such groups, depending on the action of Z_4 on Z_3 × Z_3.\n\n8. A4 × C3: The direct product of the alternating group A4 (of order 12) and the cyclic group C3 (of order 3).\n\nIn total, there are 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 36:\n\n1. Z_36 (cyclic)\n2. Z_4 × Z_9 (abelian)\n3. Two non-abelian semidirect products of Z_9 by Z_4\n4. (Z_2 × Z_2) × Z_9 (abelian)\n5. Two non-abelian semidirect products of Z_9 by Z_2 × Z_2\n6. Z_4 × (Z_3 × Z_3) (abelian)\n7. Two non-abelian semidirect products of Z_3 × Z_3 by Z_4\n8. A4 × C3 (non-abelian)"
