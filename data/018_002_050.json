    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of sets A and B is a subset of A and B respectively, we first need to find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nIntersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, can be found as follows:\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nBy comparing the elements of sets A and B, we can see that the common elements are 3, 4, and 5. Therefore,\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we need to prove that A ∩ B is a subset of both A and B. A set C is a subset of a set D (denoted as C ⊆ D) if every element of C is also an element of D.\n\n1. Proving A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, we need to show that x is also an element of A.\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSince all elements of A ∩ B (3, 4, and 5) are also elements of A, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nA ∩ B ⊆ A\n\n2. Proving A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, we need to show that x is also an element of B.\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\nB = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nSince all elements of A ∩ B (3, 4, and 5) are also elements of B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nA ∩ B ⊆ B\n\nThus, we have proved that the intersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B) is a subset of both A and B respectively."
