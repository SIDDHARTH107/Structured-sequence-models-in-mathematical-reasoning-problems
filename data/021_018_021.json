    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic algorithm used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It uses a local search procedure to iteratively move from one solution to another in the search space, while maintaining a tabu list to avoid cycling back to previously visited solutions. However, applying tabu search to this problem is not the most efficient method, as it is a simple unimodal quadratic function that can be easily solved using calculus or even a simple search algorithm.\n\nNevertheless, let's proceed with the tabu search as requested.\n\n1. Define the objective function and constraints:\n\nf(x) = -(x^2) + 10x + 23, with 0 ≤ x ≤ 10\n\n2. Set the initial solution and parameters:\n\nx = 5, tabu list size = 10, maximum iterations = 50\n\n3. Perform the tabu search:\n\nSince we are dealing with a continuous function, we need to discretize the search space. Let's use a step size of 1 for simplicity. The neighborhood of a solution x will be {x-1, x+1}.\n\nIterate through the search process, updating the current solution and tabu list, and checking the constraints. If a better solution is found, update the best solution.\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the tabu search:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef f(x):\n    return -(x**2) + 10*x + 23\n\ndef neighborhood(x):\n    return [x-1, x+1]\n\ndef tabu_search(initial_x, max_iter, tabu_list_size, step_size=1):\n    best_x = initial_x\n    best_f = f(initial_x)\n    current_x = initial_x\n    tabu_list = []\n\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        neighbors = neighborhood(current_x)\n        best_neighbor = None\n        best_neighbor_f = -sys.maxsize\n\n        for x in neighbors:\n            if 0 <= x <= 10 and x not in tabu_list:\n                fx = f(x)\n                if fx > best_neighbor_f:\n                    best_neighbor = x\n                    best_neighbor_f = fx\n\n        if best_neighbor is not None:\n            current_x = best_neighbor\n            tabu_list.append(current_x)\n            if len(tabu_list) > tabu_list_size:\n                tabu_list.pop(0)\n\n            if best_neighbor_f > best_f:\n                best_x = best_neighbor\n                best_f = best_neighbor_f\n\n    return best_x, best_f\n\ninitial_x = 5\nmax_iter = 50\ntabu_list_size = 10\nstep_size = 1\n\noptimal_x, optimal_f = tabu_search(initial_x, max_iter, tabu_list_size, step_size)\nprint(\"Optimal solution: x =\", optimal_x, \"f(x) =\", optimal_f)\n```\n\nRunning this code, we get the following output:\n\nOptimal solution: x = 5 f(x) = 48\n\nHowever, this is not the true optimal solution. The true optimal solution can be found using calculus or even a simple search algorithm. The optimal solution is x = 5, f(x) = 48. The tabu search algorithm, in this case, is not the most efficient method to solve this problem."
