    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points in the space. In this case, we are looking for isometries of the Euclidean plane with the given metric $g = dx^2 + dy^2$ that fix the origin $(0,0)$. The isometries of the Euclidean plane can be classified into three types:\n\n1. Translations: $T_{(a,b)}(x,y) = (x+a, y+b)$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. However, translations do not fix the origin, so they are not considered in this problem.\n\n2. Rotations: $R_\\theta(x,y) = (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta, x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta)$ for some angle $\\theta$. Rotations around the origin fix the origin and preserve distances, so they are isometries of the given metric.\n\n3. Reflections: $F_l(x,y) = (x - 2\\lambda(x,y), y - 2\\mu(x,y))$ for some line $l$ passing through the origin, where $\\lambda(x,y)$ and $\\mu(x,y)$ are the projections of the point $(x,y)$ onto the line $l$. Reflections across a line through the origin fix the origin and preserve distances, so they are isometries of the given metric.\n\nTherefore, the isometries of the metric $g = dx^2 + dy^2$ that fix the point $(0,0)$ are rotations around the origin and reflections across lines through the origin."
