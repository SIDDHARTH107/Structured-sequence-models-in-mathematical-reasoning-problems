    "message_1": "Suppose you work in a quality control department and you want to test the reliability of a new brand of light bulbs. Your supplier claims that the new bulbs have a failure rate of 10%. You randomly select 50 bulbs and test them. You find that only 3 bulbs have failed. Using Bayesian statistics, what is the probability that the true failure rate of the new bulbs is actually less than 10%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Bayesian statistics, we need to define our prior beliefs about the failure rate, update those beliefs based on the observed data, and then calculate the probability that the true failure rate is less than 10%.\n\nLet's denote the failure rate as p. We can use a Beta distribution as our prior distribution for p. Since we don't have strong prior beliefs about the failure rate, we can use a non-informative prior, such as Beta(1, 1), which is equivalent to a uniform distribution on the interval [0, 1].\n\nNow, we need to update our prior beliefs based on the observed data. We observed 3 failures and 47 successes (non-failures) in our sample of 50 bulbs. The likelihood function for this data is given by the binomial distribution:\n\nL(p) = C(50, 3) * p^3 * (1-p)^(50-3)\n\nwhere C(50, 3) is the number of combinations of choosing 3 failures out of 50 trials.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we can update our prior distribution with the likelihood function to obtain the posterior distribution:\n\nPosterior(p) = Prior(p) * L(p)\n\nSince our prior is Beta(1, 1) and the likelihood function is binomial, the posterior distribution is also a Beta distribution:\n\nPosterior(p) = Beta(1+3, 1+47) = Beta(4, 48)\n\nNow, we want to calculate the probability that the true failure rate is less than 10% (0.1). To do this, we need to find the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Beta(4, 48) distribution at p = 0.1:\n\nP(p < 0.1) = CDF_Beta(4, 48, 0.1)\n\nUsing a statistical software or calculator, we find:\n\nP(p < 0.1) â‰ˆ 0.982\n\nSo, based on our Bayesian analysis, there is approximately a 98.2% probability that the true failure rate of the new bulbs is actually less than 10%."
