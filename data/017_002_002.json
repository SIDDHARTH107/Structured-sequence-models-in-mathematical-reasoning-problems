    "message_2": "To find the generators for every subgroup of G, we first need to find the divisors of the order of G, which is 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Now, we will find the generators for the subgroups of order 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\n1. Subgroup of order 1: {e}\nThe identity element e is the generator for the trivial subgroup.\n\n2. Subgroup of order 2: {e, a^6}\nThe generator for this subgroup is a^6, since (a^6)^2 = a^12 = e.\n\n3. Subgroup of order 3: {e, a^4, a^8}\nThe generator for this subgroup is a^4, since (a^4)^3 = a^12 = e, and a^8 = (a^4)^2.\n\n4. Subgroup of order 4: {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}\nThe generator for this subgroup is a^3, since (a^3)^4 = a^12 = e, and a^6 = (a^3)^2, a^9 = (a^3)^3.\n\n5. Subgroup of order 6: {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}\nThe generator for this subgroup is a^2, since (a^2)^6 = a^12 = e, and a^4 = (a^2)^2, a^6 = (a^2)^3, a^8 = (a^2)^4, a^10 = (a^2)^5.\n\n6. Subgroup of order 12: {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^10, a^11}\nThe generator for this subgroup is a, since (a)^12 = a^12 = e, and all other powers of a generate the remaining elements of the group.\n\nIn summary, the generators for every subgroup of G are:\n- Order 1: e\n- Order 2: a^6\n- Order 3: a^4\n- Order 4: a^3\n- Order 6: a^2\n- Order 12: a"
