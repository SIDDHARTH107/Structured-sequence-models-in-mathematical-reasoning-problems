    "message_2": "To find the subgroups of G, we need to find the divisors of the generator 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. For each divisor d, there is a subgroup generated by 6d. Let's find the subgroups and their generators:\n\n1. Subgroup H1 generated by 6 * 1 = 6:\nH1 = {6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, ...}\nThe generator for H1 is 6.\n\n2. Subgroup H2 generated by 6 * 2 = 12:\nH2 = {12, 24, 36, 48, 60, ...}\nThe generator for H2 is 12.\n\n3. Subgroup H3 generated by 6 * 3 = 18:\nH3 = {18, 36, 54, 72, ...}\nThe generator for H3 is 18.\n\n4.

A group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. In our case, we have already found the generators for each subgroup. Let's prove that they generate the entire subgroup:\n\n1. H1 = {6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, ...}:\n6 * 1 = 6, 6 * 2 = 12, 6 * 3 = 18, and so on. The generator 6 generates the entire subgroup H1.\n\n2. H2 = {12, 24, 36, 48, 60, ...}:\n12 * 1 = 12, 12 * 2 = 24, 12 * 3 = 36, and so on. The generator 12 generates the entire subgroup H2.\n\n3. H3 = {18, 36, 54, 72, ...}:\n18 * 1 = 18, 18 * 2 = 36, 18 * 3 = 54, and so on. The generator 18 generates the entire subgroup H3.\n\n4. H4 = {36, 72, 108, ...}:\n36 * 1 = 36, 36 * 2 = 72, 36 * 3 = 108, and so on. The generator 36 generates the entire subgroup H4.\n\nThus, we have shown that each subgroup of G is cyclic, and we have found the generator for each subgroup."
