This means that there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices and edges, preserving adjacency.\n\nHere is an isomorphism between the two graphs:\n\nA -> 1\nB -> 2\nC -> 3\nD -> 4\n\nUnder this correspondence, the edges of G1 and G2 match up as follows:\n\nA-B -> 1-2\nA-C -> 1-3\nB-D -> 2-4\nC-D -> 3-4\n\nSince there is a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices and edges of G1 and G2 that preserves adjacency, the two graphs are isomorphic."
