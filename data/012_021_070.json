    "message_2": "The treewidth of the given puzzle grid graph is 2.\n\nTreewidth is a graph invariant that measures how \"tree-like\" a graph is. It is defined as the minimum size of the largest clique in a tree decomposition of the graph minus one. In simpler terms, it is the size of the largest \"bag\" of vertices in a tree decomposition minus one.\n\nFor the given grid graph, a tree decomposition can be formed with the following bags:\n\n1. {A, B, D, E}\n2. {B, C, E, F}\n3. {D, E, G, H}\n4. {E, F, H, I}\n\nEach bag has 4 vertices, so the size of the largest clique is 4. Therefore, the treewidth is 4 - 1 = 2."
