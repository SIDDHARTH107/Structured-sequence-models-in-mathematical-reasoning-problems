    "message_2": "To find the integral of sin(x) from 0 to π/2, we need to find the antiderivative of sin(x) and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe antiderivative of sin(x) is -cos(x). Now, we need to evaluate -cos(x) at the limits 0 and π/2:\n\n-(-cos(π/2)) - (-cos(0))\n= (0) - (-1)\n= 1\n\nSo, the integral of sin(x) from 0 to π/2 is 1."
