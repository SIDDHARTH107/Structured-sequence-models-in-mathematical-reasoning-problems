    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population with 20 random individuals (x-values) in the interval [0, 5].\n2. For each individual, calculate the fitness value using the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4.\n3. Perform the DE algorithm with a crossover probability of 0.8 and a mutation factor of 0.5.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a minimum fitness improvement threshold).\n\nSince I am an AI language model, I cannot perform the actual calculations for the DE algorithm. However, I can provide you with a Python code that implements the DE algorithm using the `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import differential_evolution\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 - 4*x + 4\n\nbounds = [(0, 5)]\n\nresult = differential_evolution(\n    f,\n    bounds,\n    popsize=20,\n    mutation=0.5,\n    recombination=0.8,\n    seed=42,\n    strategy='best1bin',\n    tol=1e-6,\n    maxiter=1000,\n)\n\nprint(\"Optimal x-value:\", result.x)\nprint(\"Maximum f(x):\", -result.fun)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the optimal x-value and the maximum value of f(x) for the given function and parameters. Note that the DE algorithm is designed to minimize functions, so we need to negate the function value to maximize it."
