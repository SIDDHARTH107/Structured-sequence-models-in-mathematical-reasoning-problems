    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible to find either 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers in a group of 6 people. This can be proven using the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nLet's consider one person, say person A. There are 5 other people in the group, so person A must either have at least 3 friends or at least 3 strangers among these 5 people (since 3 friends + 2 strangers = 5 or 2 friends + 3 strangers = 5).\n\nCase 1: Person A has at least 3 friends.\nLet's say these friends are B, C, and D. If any pair among B, C, and D are friends, then we have a group of 3 mutual friends (A, and the friendly pair). If none of the pairs among B, C, and D are friends, then B, C, and D are mutual strangers.\n\nCase 2: Person A has at least 3 strangers.\nLet's say these strangers are E, F, and G. If any pair among E, F, and G are strangers, then we have a group of 3 mutual strangers (A, and the strange pair). If none of the pairs among E, F, and G are strangers, then E, F, and G are mutual friends.\n\nIn both cases, we can find either 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers in a group of 6 people."
