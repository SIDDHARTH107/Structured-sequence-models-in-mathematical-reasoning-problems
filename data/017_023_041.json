    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group is either 1 or a multiple of p, and it divides the order of the group.\n\nThe prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. Therefore, we need to consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, there are three possibilities for their orders: 2, 4, or 8. Let's denote the number of Sylow 2-subgroups as n_2. Then n_2 divides 3^2 = 9, and n_2 = 1 or n_2 = 9.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, there are two possibilities for their orders: 3 or 9. Let's denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups as n_3. Then n_3 divides 2^3 = 8, and n_3 = 1 or n_3 = 4.\n\nNow, we can list the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups and their numbers:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1: There is only one Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 and one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9. The group structure is Z_8 x Z_9, which is isomorphic to Z_72.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4: There is only one Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 and four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9. The group structure is Z_8 x (Z_3 x Z_3).\n\n3. n_2 = 9, n_3 = 1: There are nine Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 and one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9. The group structures are (Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2) x Z_9 and (Z_4 x Z_2) x Z_9.\n\n4. n_2 = 9, n_3 = 4: There are nine Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 and four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9. The group structure is (Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2) x (Z_3 x Z_3).\n\nIn total, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 72:\n\n1. Z_72\n2. Z_8 x (Z_3 x Z_3)\n3. (Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2) x Z_9\n4. (Z_4 x Z_2) x Z_9\n5. (Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2) x (Z_3 x Z_3)"
