    "message_2": "To find the smallest pair of primes with a gap greater than or equal to 50, we can start by checking prime numbers and their gaps. We can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes or other prime-generating methods to find prime numbers. \n\nAfter checking prime numbers, we find that the smallest pair of primes with a gap greater than or equal to 50 is:\n\n227 and 277\n\nThe gap between these two prime numbers is 277 - 227 = 50."
