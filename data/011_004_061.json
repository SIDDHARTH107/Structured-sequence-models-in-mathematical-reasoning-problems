The production manager wants to produce a total of 50 products, where exactly 10 products are to be produced on each machine. Determine the number of ways to produce these 50 products using the given machines.",
    "message_2": "Since there are 6 machines and the production manager wants to produce exactly 10 products on each machine, we can simply use the combination formula to determine the number of ways to produce these 50 products.\n\nThe combination formula is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 50 (total number of products) and k = 10 (number of products to be produced on each machine).\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of ways to select 10 products for the first machine:\n\nC(50, 10) = 50! / (10!(50-10)!) = 50! / (10!40!)\n\nNow, we have 40 products left for the remaining 5 machines. For the second machine, we need to select 10 products from the remaining 40:\n\nC(40, 10) = 40! / (10!(40-10)!) = 40! / (10!30!)\n\nSimilarly, for the third machine, we need to select 10 products from the remaining 30:\n\nC(30, 10) = 30! / (10!(30-10)!) = 30! / (10!20!)\n\nFor the fourth machine, we need to select 10 products from the remaining 20:\n\nC(20, 10) = 20! / (10!(20-10)!) = 20! / (10!10!)\n\nFor the fifth machine, we need to select 10 products from the remaining 10:\n\nC(10, 10) = 10! / (10!(10-10)!) = 10! / (10!0!) = 1 (since 0! = 1)\n\nNow, we multiply all these combinations together to get the total number of ways to produce the 50 products using the 6 machines:\n\nTotal ways = C(50, 10) * C(40, 10) * C(30, 10) * C(20, 10) * C(10, 10)\nTotal ways = (50! / (10!40!)) * (40! / (10!30!)) * (30! / (10!20!)) * (20! / (10!10!)) * 1\n\nNotice that some terms cancel out:\n\nTotal ways = (50! / (10!10!10!10!10!)) = 50! / (10!)^5\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of ways:\n\nTotal ways = 50! / (10!)^5 â‰ˆ 1.02 * 10^12\n\nTherefore, there are approximately 1.02 * 10^12 ways to produce the 50 products using the 6 machines."
