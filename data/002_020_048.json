    "message_2": "To calculate the perimeter of the sector, we need to find the length of the arc and the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle / 360) * 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 60 degrees and the radius is 4 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (60 / 360) * 2π(4)\nArc length = (1/6) * 8π\nArc length = 4π/3 cm\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector. The radius is 4 cm, so the perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2 * radius\nPerimeter = (4π/3) + 2(4)\nPerimeter = (4π/3) + 8\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is (4π/3) + 8 cm."
