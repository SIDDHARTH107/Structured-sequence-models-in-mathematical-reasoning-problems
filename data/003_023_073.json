    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors v and u, we can use the following formula:\n\nv x u = (v_y * u_z - v_z * u_y)i - (v_x * u_z - v_z * u_x)j + (v_x * u_y - v_y * u_x)k\n\nGiven the vectors v = 2i + 3j + 4k and u = 3i - 2j + 6k, we can find the cross product as follows:\n\nv x u = ((3)(6) - (4)(-2))i - ((2)(6) - (4)(3))j + ((2)(-2) - (3)(3))k\nv x u = (18 + 8)i - (12 - 12)j - (4 - 9)k\nv x u = 26i + 0j - 5k\n\nSo, the cross product is 26i - 5k.\n\nNow, to find the magnitude of the cross product, we can use the formula:\n\n|v x u| = √((26)^2 + (0)^2 + (-5)^2)\n|v x u| = √(676 + 0 + 25)\n|v x u| = √701\n\nThe magnitude of the cross product is √701.\n\nTo find the direction of the cross product, we can normalize the cross product vector:\n\nv x u_normalized = (26/√701)i + (0/√701)j + (-5/√701)k\n\nv x u_normalized ≈ (26/26.5)i + 0j - (5/26.5)k\nv x u_normalized ≈ 0.981i - 0.189k\n\nThe direction of the cross product is approximately 0.981i - 0.189k."
