    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS IS COOL\" using the rail fence cipher with a key of 3, we will arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows. We will remove the spaces to make the encryption process easier.\n\n1. Write the message in a zigzag pattern:\n\nM   E   A   S   O\n A H M T C I C O L\n  T   I   S   C\n\n2. Read the message from left to right, top to bottom:\n\nMEASOAHMTCICOLTI_SC\n\nSo, the encrypted message using the rail fence cipher with a key of 3 is \"MEASOAHMTCICOLTI_SC\"."
