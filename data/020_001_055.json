    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two products (Product A and Product B) which require steel and aluminum in different proportions. Product A requires 4 kg of steel and 2 kg of aluminum while product B requires 3 kg of steel and 5 kg of aluminum. The production process can handle no more than 60 kg of steel and 50 kg of aluminum per day. Each unit of product A is sold for $10 and each unit of product B is sold for $15. What should be the production quantities for each product to maximize the revenue? How much total revenue will be generated?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for steel and aluminum are as follows:\n\n4x + 3y ≤ 60 (steel constraint)\n2x + 5y ≤ 50 (aluminum constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize revenue is:\n\nRevenue = 10x + 15y\n\nWe will now find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 4x + 3y ≤ 60\ny ≤ (60 - 4x) / 3\n\n2. 2x + 5y ≤ 50\ny ≤ (50 - 2x) / 5\n\nThe feasible region is determined by the intersection of these inequalities. We will find the corner points of the feasible region and then evaluate the objective function at each corner point to determine the maximum revenue.\n\nCorner Points:\nA. (0, 0)\nB. (0, 10) - Intersection of y-axis and aluminum constraint\nC. (15, 0) - Intersection of x-axis and steel constraint\nD. (10, 5) - Intersection of steel and aluminum constraints\n\nNow, we will evaluate the revenue function at each corner point:\n\nA. Revenue(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\nB. Revenue(0, 10) = 10(0) + 15(10) = $150\nC. Revenue(15, 0) = 10(15) + 15(0) = $150\nD. Revenue(10, 5) = 10(10) + 15(5) = $175\n\nThe maximum revenue of $175 is achieved when producing 10 units of Product A and 5 units of Product B."
