    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n4x + 6yi = 8 + 14i\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first multiplied equation:\n\n(4x + 6yi) - (4x + 5y) = (8 + 14i) - (2 + 3i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nyi - 5y = 6 + 11i\n\nNow, let's solve for y:\n\ny(i - 5) = 6 + 11i\n\ny = (6 + 11i) / (i - 5)\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary unit in the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is (i + 5):\n\ny = [(6 + 11i)(i + 5)] / [(i - 5)(i + 5)]\n\ny = [(6i + 30) + (11i^2 + 55i)] / (i^2 + 10i - 10i - 25)\n\nSince i^2 = -1, we can substitute it into the equation:\n\ny = [(6i + 30) + (11(-1) + 55i)] / (-1 + 0)\n\ny = (6i + 30 - 11 + 55i) / (-1)\n\ny = (19 + 61i) / (-1)\n\ny = -19 - 61i\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of x. Let's use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3yi = 4 + 7i\n\n2x + 3(-19 - 61i)i = 4 + 7i\n\n2x - 57 - 183i = 4 + 7i\n\nNow, we can separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n2x - 57 = 4 (real part)\n-183i = 7i (imaginary part)\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2x = 61\nx = 61/2\nx = 30.5\n\nNow we have the values of x and y:\n\nx = 30.5\ny = -19 - 61i\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 30.5 and y = -19 - 61i."
