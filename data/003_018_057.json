    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 3sin(2x) with respect to x, we can use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a function y = f(g(x)), then the derivative of y with respect to x is dy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nIn this case, our function is y = 3sin(2x), which can be written as y = f(g(x)) with f(u) = 3sin(u) and g(x) = 2x.\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of f(u) and g(x) with respect to their respective variables:\n\nf'(u) = d(3sin(u))/du = 3cos(u)\ng'(x) = d(2x)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\n\ndy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) = 3cos(2x) * 2 = 6cos(2x)\n\nNow, we want to find the derivative at x = π/6:\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 6cos(2(π/6)) = 6cos(π/3)\n\ncos(π/3) = 1/2, so:\n\ndy/dx(π/6) = 6(1/2) = 3\n\nTherefore, the derivative of y = 3sin(2x) at x = π/6 is 3."
