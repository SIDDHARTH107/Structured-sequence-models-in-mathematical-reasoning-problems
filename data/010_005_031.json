    "message_2": "The topological space X is not connected because it can be written as the union of two non-empty, disjoint, open sets in X: [0,1] and [2,4]. To see this, note that the sets (0,1) and (2,4) are open in the usual topology on the real line, and their intersection with X gives us the desired open sets in the subspace topology.\n\nNow, let's consider path-connectedness. A space is path-connected if for any two points x, y in the space, there exists a continuous function f: [0,1] -> X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y. In this case, X is not path-connected either. To see this, let x be a point in [0,1] and y be a point in [2,4]. Suppose there exists a continuous function f: [0,1] -> X with f(0) = x and f(1) = y. Since f is continuous and [0,1] is connected, the image of f, which is a subset of X, must also be connected. However, this is a contradiction because the image of f contains points from both [0,1] and [2,4], and we have already established that X is not connected. Therefore, no such continuous function f exists, and X is not path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, the topological space X: [0,1] ∪ [2,4] with the subspace topology inherited from the usual topology on the real line is neither connected nor path-connected."
