Write out the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such an immersion as a system of equations, and then give an example of two manifolds and a point $p$ for which the immersion exists.",
    "message_2": "Let $f: M_1 \\rightarrow M_2$ be a smooth immersion. We want to find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such an immersion such that the images of the two manifolds touch each other only at a specified point $p$ on $M_2$. \n\nNecessary and sufficient conditions:\n\n1. The immersion $f$ must be injective, i.e., $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ implies $x_1 = x_2$ for all $x_1, x_2 \\in M_1$. This ensures that the images of the two manifolds do not intersect each other except at the point $p$.\n\n2. The differential of $f$, denoted by $df$, must have full rank at every point in $M_1$. This ensures that $f$ is a smooth immersion.\n\n3. There exists a point $q \\in M_1$ such that $f(q) = p$. This ensures that the images of the two manifolds touch each other at the specified point $p$ on $M_2$.\n\nNow, let's give an example of two manifolds and a point $p$ for which the immersion exists.\n\nLet $M_1 = S^2$ be the 2-dimensional sphere embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, and let $M_2 = \\mathbb{R}^3$. Consider the identity map $f: S^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3$ given by $f(x) = x$ for all $x \\in S^2$. \n\n1. The map $f$ is injective since it is the identity map on $S^2$.\n\n2. The differential $df$ has full rank at every point in $S^2$ since it is the identity map.\n\n3. Let $p$ be any point on $S^2$. Then there exists a point $q \\in S^2$ such that $f(q) = p$ (in fact, $q = p$).\n\nThus, the identity map $f: S^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3$ is a smooth immersion from $M_1$ to $M_2$ such that the images of the two manifolds touch each other only at a specified point $p$ on $M_2$."
