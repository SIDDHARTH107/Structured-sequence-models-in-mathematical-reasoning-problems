    "message_2": "To compute the Morse homology groups $H_i(M)$, we first need to understand the structure of the Morse complex. Recall that the Morse complex is given by the chain groups $C_i(M) = \\mathbb{Z}^{k_i}$, where $k_i$ is the number of critical points of index $i$, and the boundary maps $\\partial_i: C_i(M) \\rightarrow C_{i-1}(M)$.\n\nSince all critical points of $f$ are non-degenerate, the Morse inequalities tell us that the Betti numbers $b_i(M)$ satisfy\n$$b_i(M) \\leq k_i$$\nfor all $0 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\nNow, let's compute the Morse homology groups $H_i(M) = \\ker \\partial_i / \\operatorname{im} \\partial_{i+1}$. Since the boundary maps are linear, we can think of them as matrices. The rank-nullity theorem tells us that\n$$\\operatorname{rank}(\\partial_i) + \\operatorname{nullity}(\\partial_i) = k_i.$$\n\nWe know that $\\operatorname{nullity}(\\partial_i) = \\dim \\ker \\partial_i$ and $\\operatorname{rank}(\\partial_i) = \\dim \\operatorname{im} \\partial_i$. Therefore, we can rewrite the rank-nullity theorem as\n$$\\dim \\ker \\partial_i + \\dim \\operatorname{im} \\partial_i = k_i.$$\n\nNow, we can compute the Morse homology groups as\n$$H_i(M) = \\frac{\\ker \\partial_i}{\\operatorname{im} \\partial_{i+1}}.$$\n\nBy the rank-nullity theorem, we have\n$$\\dim H_i(M) = \\dim \\ker \\partial_i - \\dim \\operatorname{im} \\partial_{i+1} = k_i - \\dim \\operatorname{im} \\partial_{i+1}.$$\n\nSince $b_i(M) \\leq k_i$, we have\n$$\\dim H_i(M) \\geq b_i(M).$$\n\nBy the Morse inequalities, we also have\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i \\dim H_i(M) = \\sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i b_i(M).$$\n\nTherefore, we conclude that\n$$\\dim H_i(M) = b_i(M)$$\nfor all $0 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\nIn other words, the Morse homology groups $H_i(M)$ are isomorphic to the singular homology groups $H_i(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ of the manifold $M$."
