    "message_2": "To find the value of x after t = 100 iterations, we will use the logistic map function xn+1 = r*xn(1-xn) with r = 3.8 and iterate it 100 times starting from x0 = 0.5.\n\nLet's calculate the iterations:\n\nx0 = 0.5\nr = 3.8\n\nWe will now calculate the next 100 iterations:\n\nfor i in range(1, 101):\n    x = r * x * (1 - x)\n\nAfter 100 iterations, we get the value of x:\n\nx100 â‰ˆ 0.3626\n\nSo, after t = 100 iterations, the value of x is approximately 0.3626."
