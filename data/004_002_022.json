    "message_2": "To evaluate the limit of the function f(x) = (2x^2 - 7x + 3)/(x^2 - 4x + 3) as x approaches 3, we can first try to plug in the value of x = 3 directly into the function:\n\nf(3) = (2(3)^2 - 7(3) + 3) / ((3)^2 - 4(3) + 3)\n\nHowever, this results in a 0/0 indeterminate form. To resolve this, we can attempt to factor the numerator and denominator to see if there is a common factor that can be canceled out.\n\nThe numerator can be factored as follows:\n2x^2 - 7x + 3 = (2x - 1)(x - 3)\n\nThe denominator can be factored as follows:\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\nf(x) = [(2x - 1)(x - 3)] / [(x - 1)(x - 3)]\n\nWe can cancel out the common factor (x - 3) from both the numerator and the denominator:\nf(x) = (2x - 1) / (x - 1)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value x = 3 without encountering the 0/0 indeterminate form:\nf(3) = (2(3) - 1) / (3 - 1)\nf(3) = (6 - 1) / (2)\nf(3) = 5 / 2\n\nTherefore, the limit of the function f(x) as x approaches 3 is 5/2 or 2.5."
