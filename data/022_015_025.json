    "message_2": "To use the Schwarz reflection principle, we first need to find an analytic function $g(z)$ that is the reflection of $f(z)$ across the real axis. Since $f(z)$ is real-valued on the real axis and $f(z) = e^{2z}$ for $-\\infty < z < 0$, we can define the reflection $g(z)$ as the complex conjugate of $f(z)$ for $z$ in the upper half-plane:\n\n$$g(z) = \\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$$\n\nNow, we want to find an analytic function that agrees with $f(z)$ in the lower half-plane and with $g(z)$ in the upper half-plane. We can define this function as:\n\n$$h(z) = \\begin{cases}\nf(z), & \\text{if } \\Im(z) \\leq 0 \\\\\ng(z), & \\text{if } \\Im(z) > 0\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are both analytic in their respective domains and agree on the real axis, $h(z)$ is analytic in the whole complex plane. Moreover, $h(z)$ converges to 1 as $z$ approaches infinity in both the lower and upper half-planes, since $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ do.\n\nNow, we need to find an explicit expression for $h(z)$. We know that $f(z) = e^{2z}$ for $-\\infty < z < 0$. To find the expression for $g(z)$, we can use the definition $g(z) = \\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$:\n\n$$g(z) = \\overline{f(\\bar{z})} = \\overline{e^{2\\bar{z}}} = e^{2\\overline{z}}$$\n\nSo, we can write $h(z)$ as:\n\n$$h(z) = \\begin{cases}\ne^{2z}, & \\text{if } \\Im(z) \\leq 0 \\\\\ne^{2\\overline{z}}, & \\text{if } \\Im(z) > 0\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nThis is the analytic function that satisfies the given conditions and extends $f(z)$ into the upper half-plane using the Schwarz reflection principle."
