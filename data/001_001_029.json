    "message_2": "To solve for the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5\n   2x = 8\n\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n   2x / 2 = 8 / 2\n   x = 4\n\nSo, the value of x is 4."
