    "message_1": "If we are given a Hill cipher key matrix of size 3x3 and a ciphertext of \"VIFN\", what is the corresponding plaintext?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"VIFN\" using a Hill cipher with a 3x3 key matrix, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the ciphertext into numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).\n2. Since the ciphertext has 4 characters and the key matrix is 3x3, we need to split the ciphertext into two blocks of 3 characters each. We can add an extra character (usually 'X') to make the second block complete.\n3. Multiply each block by the inverse of the key matrix modulo 26.\n4. Convert the resulting numerical values back to letters.\n\nHowever, you have not provided the 3x3 key matrix. Please provide the key matrix so that I can help you find the corresponding plaintext."
