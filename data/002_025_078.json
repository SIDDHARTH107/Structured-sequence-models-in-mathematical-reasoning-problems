    "message_1": "Sure, how about this:\n\nIn an isosceles triangle ABC, the length of the base AB is 12 cm, and each of the two equal sides AC and BC has a length of 7 cm. What is the length of the altitude drawn from vertex C to side AB?",
    "message_2": "Let's call the point where the altitude intersects the base AB as point D. Since triangle ABC is isosceles, the altitude CD will also bisect the base AB, creating two right triangles ADC and BDC.\n\nNow, we have two congruent right triangles ADC and BDC with hypotenuse AC = BC = 7 cm and base AD = DB = 6 cm (because the altitude bisects the base AB).\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the altitude CD.\n\nIn right triangle ADC, we have:\n\nAC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2\n\n7^2 = 6^2 + CD^2\n\n49 = 36 + CD^2\n\nCD^2 = 49 - 36\n\nCD^2 = 13\n\nCD = √13\n\nSo, the length of the altitude CD is √13 cm."
