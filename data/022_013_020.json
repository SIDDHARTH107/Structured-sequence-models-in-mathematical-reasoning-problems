    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(z) = e^z, we can use the fact that the derivative of e^z with respect to z is simply e^z itself. Therefore, the derivative of f(z) = e^z is f'(z) = e^z.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the derivative at the point z = 2 + 3i. So, we have:\n\nf'(2 + 3i) = e^(2 + 3i)\n\nTo compute e^(2 + 3i), we can use Euler's formula, which states that e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x), where x is a real number. In our case, x = 3.\n\ne^(2 + 3i) = e^2 * e^(3i) = e^2 * (cos(3) + i*sin(3))\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(z) = e^z at the point z = 2 + 3i is:\n\nf'(2 + 3i) = e^2 * (cos(3) + i*sin(3))"
