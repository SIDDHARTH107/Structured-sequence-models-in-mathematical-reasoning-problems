    "message_2": "To find the Reeb vector field associated with the contact form $\\alpha = dz + x dy$, we need to find a vector field $R$ such that:\n\n1. $\\alpha(R) = 1$\n2. $d\\alpha(R, \\cdot) = 0$\n\nFirst, let's compute the differential of the contact form $\\alpha$:\n\n$$\nd\\alpha = d(dz + x dy) = d(x dy) = dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n\nNow, let's consider a general vector field $R = a(x, y, z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + b(x, y, z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + c(x, y, z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$.\n\nApplying the first condition $\\alpha(R) = 1$, we get:\n\n$$\nc + xb = 1\n$$\n\nNow, let's apply the second condition $d\\alpha(R, \\cdot) = 0$. Since $d\\alpha = dx \\wedge dy$, we only need to check this condition for the basis vector fields $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$:\n\n$$\ndx \\wedge dy \\left(a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + b \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + c \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right) = 0\n$$\n\n$$\ndx \\wedge dy \\left(a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + b \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + c \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) = 0\n$$\n\nThese conditions are automatically satisfied since $dx \\wedge dy$ annihilates both $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$.\n\nNow, we can solve for $b$ from the first condition:\n\n$$\nb = \\frac{1 - c}{x}\n$$\n\nWe can choose $c$ to be any smooth function of $x$, $y$, and $z$, and this will give us a 1-parameter family of Reeb vector fields:\n\n$$\nR = a(x, y, z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\frac{1 - c(x, y, z)}{x} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + c(x, y, z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\n$$\n\nwhere $a(x, y, z)$ and $c(x, y, z)$ are smooth functions."
