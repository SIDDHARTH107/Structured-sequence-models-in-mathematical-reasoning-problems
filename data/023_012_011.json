    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of the given function, we first need to determine the period of the function. Since the function is defined over the interval -2 ≤ x ≤ 2, the period is T = 2.\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier series coefficients. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * π * x / L) + b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere L = T/2, a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/T) * ∫[f(x)] dx over one period\n\nSince the function is defined as f(x) = 1 for -1 < x < 1 and f(x) = 0 otherwise, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1/2) * [∫[1] dx from -1 to 1 + ∫[0] dx from 1 to 2]\n\na_0 = (1/2) * [x | from -1 to 1 + 0]\n\na_0 = (1/2) * [(1 - (-1))]\n\na_0 = 1/2\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * π * x / L)] dx over one period\n\na_n = (1) * [∫[1 * cos(n * π * x)] dx from -1 to 1 + ∫[0] dx from 1 to 2]\n\na_n = ∫[cos(n * π * x)] dx from -1 to 1\n\na_n = (1/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * x) | from -1 to 1\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L)] dx over one period\n\nb_n = (1) * [∫[1 * sin(n * π * x)] dx from -1 to 1 + ∫[0] dx from 1 to 2]\n\nb_n = ∫[sin(n * π * x)] dx from -1 to 1\n\nb_n = (-1/(n * π)) * cos(n * π * x) | from -1 to 1\n\nb_n = (-1/(n * π)) * [cos(n * π) - cos(-n * π)]\n\nFor odd values of n, cos(n * π) = -1 and cos(-n * π) = -1, so:\n\nb_n = (-1/(n * π)) * [-2] = 2/(n * π) for odd n\n\nFor even values of n, cos(n * π) = 1 and cos(-n * π) = 1, so:\n\nb_n = 0 for even n\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of the function:\n\nf(x) = 1/2 + Σ [(2/(n * π)) * sin(n * π * x)] for odd n\n\nThe summation is from n = 1 to infinity, and only odd values of n contribute to the series."
