    "message_2": "To find the time-domain representation x(t) of the signal, we need to compute the inverse Fourier transform of X(f). The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\nx(t) = ∫[X(f) * e^(j2πft)] df, where the integral is taken over all frequencies f.\n\nGiven X(f) = sinc(2f/(π-1))/((f-1)(f-3)), we have:\n\nx(t) = ∫[sinc(2f/(π-1))/((f-1)(f-3)) * e^(j2πft)] df\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the partial fraction decomposition method. We can rewrite X(f) as:\n\nX(f) = A/(f-1) + B/(f-3) + sinc(2f/(π-1))\n\nwhere A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, we can use the following equations:\n\nA(f-3) + B(f-1) = sinc(2f/(π-1))\n\nBy solving these equations, we get:\n\nA = -sinc(2/(π-1))\nB = sinc(4/(π-1))\n\nNow, we can rewrite x(t) as:\n\nx(t) = ∫[-sinc(2/(π-1)) * e^(j2πft)/(f-1) df] + ∫[sinc(4/(π-1)) * e^(j2πft)/(f-3) df] + ∫[sinc(2f/(π-1)) * e^(j2πft) df]\n\nWe can solve the first two integrals using the inverse Fourier transform property:\n\n∫[e^(j2πft)/(f-a) df] = e^(j2πat) * u(t)\n\nwhere u(t) is the unit step function. Therefore, we have:\n\n∫[-sinc(2/(π-1)) * e^(j2πft)/(f-1) df] = -sinc(2/(π-1)) * e^(j2πt) * u(t)\n∫[sinc(4/(π-1)) * e^(j2πft)/(f-3) df] = sinc(4/(π-1)) * e^(j6πt) * u(t)\n\nThe last integral is more complicated and does not have a simple closed-form solution. However, we can write the time-domain representation x(t) as:\n\nx(t) = -sinc(2/(π-1)) * e^(j2πt) * u(t) + sinc(4/(π-1)) * e^(j6πt) * u(t) + ∫[sinc(2f/(π-1)) * e^(j2πft) df]\n\nThis is the time-domain representation of the signal x(t) in terms of the inverse Fourier transform."
