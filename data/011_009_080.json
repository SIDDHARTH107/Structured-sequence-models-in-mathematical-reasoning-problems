    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Stirling numbers of the second kind, which are used to count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. The Stirling number of the second kind is denoted by S(n, k).\n\nIn this case, we have 6 employees (n = 6) and want to divide them into 3 teams (k = 3). We will use the Stirling number of the second kind to find the number of ways to do this: S(6, 3).\n\nThe formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe will need to calculate the Stirling numbers for smaller values of n and k to find S(6, 3):\n\nS(1, 1) = 1\nS(2, 1) = 1\nS(2, 2) = 1\nS(3, 1) = 1\nS(3, 2) = 3\nS(3, 3) = 1\nS(4, 1) = 1\nS(4, 2) = 7\nS(4, 3) = 6\nS(4, 4) = 1\nS(5, 1) = 1\nS(5, 2) = 15\nS(5, 3) = 25\nS(5, 4) = 10\nS(5, 5) = 1\n\nNow we can calculate S(6, 3):\n\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)\nS(6, 3) = 3 * 25 + 15\nS(6, 3) = 75 + 15\nS(6, 3) = 90\n\nSo there are 90 different ways to divide the 6 employees into 3 teams with the possibility of having different numbers of employees in each team."
