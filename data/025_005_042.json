    "message_2": "To find the singular points on the curve y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 2, we need to find the points where both the partial derivatives with respect to x and y are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet f(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + 2x - 2. Then, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = -3x^2 + 2\n∂f/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n-3x^2 + 2 = 0\n2y = 0\n\nThe second equation gives us y = 0. Now, we substitute this into the first equation:\n\n-3x^2 + 2 = 0\nx^2 = 2/3\nx = ±√(2/3)\n\nSo, we have two singular points: (±√(2/3), 0)."
