    "message_1": "Suppose there are two suspects, A and B, who are arrested for a crime. The prosecutor offers each suspect a plea bargain: if one testifies against the other and the other remains silent, the betrayer will go free and the silent suspect will be sentenced to 3 years in prison. If both betray each other, they will each receive a 2-year sentence. If both remain silent, they will each get a 1-year sentence for a lesser crime. What should A do if he knows B's decision and wants to minimize his own sentence? If B decides to betray A, what would be the best course of action for A to take?",
    "message_2": "If A knows B's decision, then A can make the best choice to minimize his own sentence based on that information.\n\n1. If B decides to betray A:\nIn this case, A has two options: betray B or remain silent. If A betrays B, both will get a 2-year sentence. If A remains silent, A will get a 3-year sentence. To minimize his sentence, A should betray B, resulting in a 2-year sentence for both.\n\n2. If B decides to remain silent:\nIn this case, A again has two options: betray B or remain silent. If A betrays B, A will go free, and B will get a 3-year sentence. If A remains silent, both will get a 1-year sentence. To minimize his sentence, A should betray B, resulting in A going free and B getting a 3-year sentence.\n\nIn both scenarios, the best course of action for A to minimize his own sentence is to betray B."
