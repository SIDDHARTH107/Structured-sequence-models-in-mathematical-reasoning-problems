    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is constructed by repeatedly folding a straight line segment in half. Each time the curve is folded, the number of segments doubles, and the length of each segment remains the same.\n\nFor an Heighway dragon curve of order n, the total number of segments is 2^n. In this case, the order is 8, so there are 2^8 = 256 segments. Since the length of the starting segment (order 0) is 1, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve of order 8 is 256 * 1 = 256."
