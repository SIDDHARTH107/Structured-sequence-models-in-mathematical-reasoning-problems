    "message_2": "The Hopf map, also known as the Hopf fibration, is a mapping from the 3-sphere S³ to the 2-sphere S². It is a non-trivial example of a fiber bundle, where each fiber is a circle (1-sphere). To define the Hopf map, we first need to consider the 3-sphere S³ as a subset of the complex 2-space C².\n\nLet (z₁, z₂) be the complex coordinates of C², where z₁ = x₁ + iy₁ and z₂ = x₂ + iy₂, with x₁, y₁, x₂, and y₂ being real numbers. The 3-sphere S³ can be defined as the set of points (z₁, z₂) in C² such that |z₁|² + |z₂|² = 1.\n\nNow, we can define the Hopf map h: S³ → S² as follows:\n\nh(z₁, z₂) = (2z₁ * conj(z₂), |z₁|² - |z₂|²),\n\nwhere conj(z) denotes the complex conjugate of z.\n\nIn terms of the real coordinates (x₁, y₁, x₂, y₂), the Hopf map can be written as:\n\nh(x₁, y₁, x₂, y₂) = (2(x₁x₂ + y₁y₂), 2(y₁x₂ - x₁y₂), x₁² + y₁² - x₂² - y₂²),\n\nwhere the 3-sphere S³ is defined by the equation x₁² + y₁² + x₂² + y₂² = 1.\n\nNow, we want to find the Hopf map for the 2-sphere M of radius 1 centered at the origin of 3-space. Since the 2-sphere S² is embedded in R³ with standard Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z), we can write the Hopf map in terms of these coordinates:\n\nh(x₁, y₁, x₂, y₂) = (x, y, z) = (2(x₁x₂ + y₁y₂), 2(y₁x₂ - x₁y₂), x₁² + y₁² - x₂² - y₂²),\n\nwhere x² + y² + z² = 1.\n\nSo, the Hopf map of the 2-sphere M of radius 1 centered at the origin of 3-space is given by:\n\nh(x₁, y₁, x₂, y₂) = (x, y, z) = (2(x₁x₂ + y₁y₂), 2(y₁x₂ - x₁y₂), x₁² + y₁² - x₂² - y₂²)."
