    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using complex analysis, we first rewrite the equation in terms of complex variables. Let $z = x + iy$, and $u(x, y) = U(z, \\bar{z})$, where $\\bar{z}$ is the complex conjugate of $z$. Then, we can rewrite the partial differential equation as:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} + 3U = e^{2z+3\\bar{z}}$$\n\nNow, we can solve this equation using the method of integrating factors. The integrating factor is given by $e^{3z}$, so we multiply both sides of the equation by this factor:\n\n$$e^{3z}\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} + 3e^{3z}U = e^{5z+3\\bar{z}}$$\n\nNow, we notice that the left-hand side is the derivative of the product $e^{3z}U$ with respect to $z$. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(e^{3z}U) = e^{5z+3\\bar{z}}$$\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $z$, we get:\n\n$$e^{3z}U(z, \\bar{z}) = \\int e^{5z+3\\bar{z}} dz + G(\\bar{z})$$\n\nHere, $G(\\bar{z})$ is an arbitrary function of $\\bar{z}$, which arises due to the integration. Now, we can solve for $U(z, \\bar{z})$:\n\n$$U(z, \\bar{z}) = e^{-3z}\\left(\\int e^{5z+3\\bar{z}} dz + G(\\bar{z})\\right)$$\n\nTo find the function $G(\\bar{z})$, we use the initial condition $u(x, 0) = x^2$. This translates to $U(x, 0) = x^2$. Plugging in $y = 0$ and $z = x$ into the equation for $U(z, \\bar{z})$, we get:\n\n$$x^2 = e^{-3x}\\left(\\int e^{5x} dx + G(0)\\right)$$\n\nIntegrating $e^{5x}$ with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{5}e^{5x} + C$$\n\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. Now, we can rewrite the equation for $x^2$ as:\n\n$$x^2 = e^{-3x}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}e^{5x} + G(0)\\right)$$\n\nTo find $G(0)$, we can plug in $x = 0$:\n\n$$0^2 = e^{0}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}e^{0} + G(0)\\right) \\Rightarrow G(0) = -\\frac{1}{5}$$\n\nNow, we can write the final solution for $U(z, \\bar{z})$:\n\n$$U(z, \\bar{z}) = e^{-3z}\\left(\\int e^{5z+3\\bar{z}} dz - \\frac{1}{5}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we can convert back to the original variables $u(x, y)$:\n\n$$u(x, y) = e^{-3(x+iy)}\\left(\\int e^{5(x+iy)+3(x-iy)} dx - \\frac{1}{5}\\right)$$\n\nThis is the solution to the given partial differential equation with the initial condition $u(x,0) = x^2$."
