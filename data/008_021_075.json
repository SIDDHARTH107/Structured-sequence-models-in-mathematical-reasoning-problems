    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are linearly dependent, and they all represent the same line.\n\nWe can solve the first equation for y:\n\ny = 3 - 2x\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y into the second equation:\n\n4x + 2(3 - 2x) = 6\n\n4x + 6 - 4x = 6\n\n6 = 6\n\nSince this equation is always true, it means that the system of equations has infinitely many solutions. All points on the line represented by the equation 2x + y = 3 are solutions to the system."
