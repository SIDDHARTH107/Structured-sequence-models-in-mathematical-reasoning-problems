    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (5 cm)^2\nSurface area = 4 * π * 25 cm^2\nSurface area = 100π cm^2\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\n\nSurface area ≈ 100 * 3.14 cm^2\nSurface area ≈ 314 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 314 cm^2, rounded to two decimal places."
