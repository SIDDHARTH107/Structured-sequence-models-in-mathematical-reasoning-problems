    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using Fourier analysis, we first need to find the complementary function (the solution of the homogeneous equation) and the particular integral (the solution of the non-homogeneous equation).\n\n1. Complementary function:\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n\ny''(t) + y'(t) + 2y(t) = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 + r + 2 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nr = (-1 ± √(1 - 8))/2 = (-1 ± √(-7))/2 = -1/2 ± (√7/2)i\n\nSince the roots are complex conjugates, the complementary function is:\n\ny_c(t) = e^(-t/2)(C1*cos(√7/2*t) + C2*sin(√7/2*t))\n\n2. Particular integral:\n\nTo find the particular integral, we assume a solution of the form:\n\ny_p(t) = e^(-3t)(A*cos(2t) + B*sin(2t))\n\nNow, we need to find the first and second derivatives of y_p(t):\n\ny_p'(t) = e^(-3t)(-3A*cos(2t) - 3B*sin(2t) - 2A*sin(2t) + 2B*cos(2t))\n\ny_p''(t) = e^(-3t)(9A*cos(2t) + 9B*sin(2t) - 4A*cos(2t) - 4B*sin(2t))\n\nNow, we substitute y_p(t), y_p'(t), and y_p''(t) into the given differential equation:\n\ne^(-3t)(5A*cos(2t) + 5B*sin(2t)) + e^(-3t)(-3A*cos(2t) - 3B*sin(2t) - 2A*sin(2t) + 2B*cos(2t)) + 2e^(-3t)(A*cos(2t) + B*sin(2t)) = e^(-3t)cos(2t)\n\nSimplifying and equating the coefficients of cos(2t) and sin(2t), we get:\n\n(5A + 2B - 3A)cos(2t) + (5B - 3B - 2A)sin(2t) = cos(2t)\n\n2A + 2B = 1\n-2A + 2B = 0\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get:\n\nA = 1/4\nB = 1/4\n\nSo, the particular integral is:\n\ny_p(t) = e^(-3t)(1/4*cos(2t) + 1/4*sin(2t))\n\n3. General solution:\n\nThe general solution of the given differential equation is the sum of the complementary function and the particular integral:\n\ny(t) = y_c(t) + y_p(t) = e^(-t/2)(C1*cos(√7/2*t) + C2*sin(√7/2*t)) + e^(-3t)(1/4*cos(2t) + 1/4*sin(2t))\n\n4. Stability:\n\nSince the real part of the complex roots of the characteristic equation is negative (-1/2), the system is stable."
