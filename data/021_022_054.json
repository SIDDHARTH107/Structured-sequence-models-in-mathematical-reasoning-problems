    "message_1": "A company wants to minimize the cost of producing a certain product. The production cost function is given by:\n\nC(x) = 5000 + 30x âˆ’ 6x^2,\nwhere x is the number of units produced.\n\nUsing the Firefly Algorithm, find the optimal number of units to be produced to minimize the production cost. Assume that the feasible range for x is between 0 and 10,000 units.",
    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies. It is used to find the global minimum of a function. In this case, we want to find the minimum production cost C(x) for the given function. \n\nHere are the steps to implement the Firefly Algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a population of fireflies with random positions (x values) within the feasible range (0 to 10,000).\n2. Define the attractiveness and brightness of each firefly based on the production cost function C(x).\n3. Move the less attractive (higher cost) fireflies toward the more attractive (lower cost) fireflies.\n4. Update the positions and attractiveness of the fireflies.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for a predetermined number of iterations or until the convergence criterion is met.\n\nAfter implementing the Firefly Algorithm, we will obtain the optimal number of units to be produced that minimize the production cost.\n\nHowever, as a text-based AI, I am unable to execute the Firefly Algorithm directly. Instead, I recommend using a programming language like Python to implement the algorithm and find the optimal solution."
