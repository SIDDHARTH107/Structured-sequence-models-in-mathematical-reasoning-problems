    "message_1": "What is the probability that a specific type of cyber attack occurs on a network given that there is a 15% chance of any cyber attack happening and out of all cyber attacks, this specific type occurs 20% of the time?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of this specific type of cyber attack occurring, we can use the conditional probability formula: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A), where A is the event of any cyber attack happening, and B is the event of the specific type of cyber attack occurring given that any cyber attack has happened.\n\nIn this case, P(A) is the probability of any cyber attack happening, which is 15% or 0.15. P(B|A) is the probability of the specific type of cyber attack occurring given that any cyber attack has happened, which is 20% or 0.20.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03\n\nSo, the probability of the specific type of cyber attack occurring on the network is 3% or 0.03."
