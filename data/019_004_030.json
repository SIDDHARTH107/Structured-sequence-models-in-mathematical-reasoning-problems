    "message_2": "To find out how long it will take for the container to contain 500 liters of water, we can set up an equation:\n\nInitial volume + (rate of increase * time) = final volume\n\n100 + (10 * time) = 500\n\nNow, we can solve for time:\n\n10 * time = 500 - 100\n10 * time = 400\ntime = 400 / 10\ntime = 40 minutes\n\nSo, it will take 40 minutes for the container to contain 500 liters of water."
