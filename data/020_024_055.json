    "message_1": "A company has a product that costs $50 to produce, and they know that the demand for the product will decrease by 10 units for every $1 increase in price. The company wants to maximize their profit by setting the price. Assuming that there is a fixed cost of $5000 for production, what price should the company set for the product in order to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the price increase in dollars and let P(x) be the profit function. The demand will decrease by 10 units for every $1 increase in price, so the number of units sold will be 10x less than the initial demand. Let's assume the initial demand is D units.\n\nThe revenue function, R(x), is the product of the number of units sold and the price per unit. The price per unit is $50 + x, and the number of units sold is D - 10x. So, the revenue function is:\n\nR(x) = (D - 10x)(50 + x)\n\nThe cost function, C(x), is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost. The fixed cost is $5000, and the variable cost is $50 per unit. So, the cost function is:\n\nC(x) = 5000 + 50(D - 10x)\n\nThe profit function, P(x), is the difference between the revenue and the cost:\n\nP(x) = R(x) - C(x) = (D - 10x)(50 + x) - (5000 + 50(D - 10x))\n\nTo find the price that maximizes the profit, we need to find the critical points of P(x) by taking the first derivative and setting it equal to zero:\n\nP'(x) = dP(x)/dx = -10(50 + x) + (D - 10x) - 500 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n-500 - 10x + D - 10x = 0\n-20x + D - 500 = 0\nx = (D - 500)/20\n\nSince we don't know the initial demand (D), we cannot find the exact value of x. However, the company should increase the price by (D - 500)/20 dollars to maximize their profit. The final price would be:\n\nPrice = $50 + (D - 500)/20"
