    "message_2": "Case 1: G has an element of order 27.\n\nLet a be an element in G with order 27. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by a, denoted by <a>, has order 27. Since the order of <a> is equal to the order of G, it follows that G = <a>. Therefore, G is a cyclic group of order 27, and it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nCase 2: G does not have an element of order 27.\n\nSince G is a group of order 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 27\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 27. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G. However, this would imply that G has an element of order 27, which contradicts our assumption in this case. Therefore, n_3 = 27.\n\nLet P be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since the order of P is 3^2 = 9, P is isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3. If P is isomorphic to C9, then P has an element of order 9, which implies that G has an element of order 9. However, this would mean that G has a subgroup of order 9, which contradicts the assumption that G does not have an element of order 27. Therefore, P must be isomorphic to C3 × C3.\n\nNow, let N be the normalizer of P in G. By definition, N is the largest subgroup of G containing P such that P is normal in N. Since P is a Sylow 3-subgroup, the index of N in G, denoted by [G : N], is equal to n_3 = 27. Thus, the order of N is |G| / [G : N] = 27 / 27 = 1, which implies that N = G. Therefore, P is normal in G.\n\nSince P is normal in G and isomorphic to C3 × C3, we can consider the semidirect product of P with a group of order 3. Let Q be a subgroup of G with order 3. Then, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P and Q, denoted by P ⋊ Q. Since P and Q have orders that are relatively prime, the semidirect product is unique up to isomorphism.\n\nIn conclusion, if G does not have an element of order 27, then G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27, which is the unique semidirect product of C3 × C3 and a group of order 3."
