    "message_1": "Suppose you have a graph with 7 vertices and 12 edges, and each edge has a weight associated with it. Using Kruskal's algorithm, find the minimum spanning tree of the graph.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle in the tree.\n4. Repeat step 3 until there are (number of vertices - 1) edges in the minimum spanning tree.\n\nHowever, since the specific weights of the edges are not provided, we cannot provide the exact minimum spanning tree for this graph. If you provide the weights of the 12 edges, we can help you find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm."
