    "message_1": "A company believes that the average amount a customer spends in their store is $50, with a standard deviation of $10. They collect a random sample of 30 customer transactions and find an average of $55. Using bootstrapping, calculate the standard error of the mean for this sample.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the standard error of the mean using bootstrapping, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples from the original sample (with replacement).\n2. Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample.\n3. Calculate the standard deviation of the means of all the bootstrap samples.\n\nLet's assume we draw 1000 bootstrap samples from the original sample of 30 customer transactions.\n\n1. Draw 1000 bootstrap samples from the original sample (with replacement).\n\nWe don't have the original sample data, so we can't actually perform this step. However, we can assume that we have drawn 1000 bootstrap samples and move on to the next step.\n\n2. Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample.\n\nAgain, we don't have the actual data, so we can't calculate the means of the bootstrap samples. But we can assume that we have calculated the means and move on to the next step.\n\n3. Calculate the standard deviation of the means of all the bootstrap samples.\n\nThis is the standard error of the mean. Since we don't have the actual data, we can't calculate the standard error of the mean using bootstrapping directly. However, we can use the formula for the standard error of the mean for a random sample:\n\nStandard Error (SE) = σ / √n\n\nWhere σ is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, σ = $10 and n = 30.\n\nSE = 10 / √30 ≈ 1.83\n\nSo, the standard error of the mean for this sample is approximately $1.83."
