    "message_1": "A flower pot weighs 25 pounds and needs to be lifted from the ground to a windowsill that is 6 feet above the ground. A rope will be used to lift the flower pot straight up the side of the building, which is 10 feet away from the windowsill. How much work is done in lifting the flower pot to the windowsill, assuming that the rope is always taut and that its weight can be neglected?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the work done in lifting the flower pot, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = Force × Distance × cos(θ)\n\nIn this case, the force is the weight of the flower pot (25 pounds), and the distance is the vertical distance the flower pot needs to be lifted (6 feet). Since the flower pot is being lifted straight up, the angle (θ) between the force and the distance is 0 degrees. The cosine of 0 degrees is 1.\n\nWork = 25 pounds × 6 feet × cos(0)\nWork = 25 pounds × 6 feet × 1\nWork = 150 pound-feet\n\nSo, the work done in lifting the flower pot to the windowsill is 150 pound-feet."
