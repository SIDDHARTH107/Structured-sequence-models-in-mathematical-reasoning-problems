    "message_2": "To solve for the unknown angle x, we need to isolate x in the equation sin(x) - 0.5 = 0.1.\n\nStep 1: Add 0.5 to both sides of the equation.\nsin(x) = 0.6\n\nStep 2: Take the inverse sine (arcsin) of both sides.\nx = arcsin(0.6)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the angle in degrees.\nx ≈ 36.87°\n\nSo, the unknown angle x is approximately 36.87°."
