    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one of those triangles, then multiply by the number of triangles (6 in this case).\n\nThe formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is:\n\nArea = (side^2 * √3) / 4\n\nFor our hexagon with side length of 6 cm, the area of one equilateral triangle would be:\n\nArea = (6^2 * √3) / 4\nArea = (36 * √3) / 4\nArea = 9√3 cm²\n\nSince there are 6 equilateral triangles in a hexagon, the total area of the hexagon would be:\n\nTotal Area = 6 * (9√3) cm²\nTotal Area = 54√3 cm²"
