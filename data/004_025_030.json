    "message_1": "A ball is thrown vertically upwards from the roof of a building 50 meters tall at a speed of 25 m/s. Using calculus to solve the problem, how high above the ground does the ball go and how long will it take for the ball to return to the ground? (Assume no air resistance)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the motion of the ball under the influence of gravity. The acceleration due to gravity is -9.81 m/s² (downwards). We can use calculus to find the position function, velocity function, and acceleration function of the ball.\n\n1. Acceleration function: a(t) = -9.81 m/s² (constant)\n\n2. Velocity function: To find the velocity function, we integrate the acceleration function with respect to time (t).\n\nv(t) = ∫a(t) dt = ∫(-9.81) dt = -9.81t + C\n\nWe know the initial velocity is 25 m/s (upwards), so when t = 0, v(0) = 25. Therefore, C = 25.\n\nv(t) = -9.81t + 25\n\n3. Position function: To find the position function, we integrate the velocity function with respect to time (t).\n\ns(t) = ∫v(t) dt = ∫(-9.81t + 25) dt = -4.905t² + 25t + D\n\nWe know the initial position is 50 meters above the ground, so when t = 0, s(0) = 50. Therefore, D = 50.\n\ns(t) = -4.905t² + 25t + 50\n\nNow, we can find the maximum height above the ground and the time it takes for the ball to return to the ground.\n\nMaximum height: The maximum height occurs when the velocity is 0 (v(t) = 0).\n\n0 = -9.81t + 25\nt = 25/9.81 ≈ 2.55 seconds\n\nNow, we can find the maximum height by plugging this time into the position function:\n\ns(2.55) = -4.905(2.55)² + 25(2.55) + 50 ≈ 81.64 meters\n\nSo, the maximum height above the ground is approximately 81.64 meters.\n\nTime to return to the ground: The ball returns to the ground when the position function is 0 (s(t) = 0).\n\n0 = -4.905t² + 25t + 50\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:\n\nt = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nt = (-25 ± √(25² - 4(-4.905)(50))) / (2(-4.905))\n\nThere are two solutions for t, but we only consider the positive one:\n\nt ≈ 5.11 seconds\n\nSo, it takes approximately 5.11 seconds for the ball to return to the ground."
