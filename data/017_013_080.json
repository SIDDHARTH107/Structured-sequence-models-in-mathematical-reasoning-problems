    "message_2": "To find the number of distinct groups of order 18 up to isomorphism, we need to consider the prime factorization of 18, which is 2 × 3^2.\n\nNow, we will use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, which states that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nFor a group of order 18, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. A single cyclic group of order 18: C_18\n2. A direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 9: C_2 × C_9\n3. A direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 6: C_3 × C_6\n4. A direct product of a cyclic group of order 2, a cyclic group of order 3, and a cyclic group of order 3: C_2 × C_3 × C_3\n\nThese are all the possibilities for abelian groups of order 18. However, we also need to consider non-abelian groups.\n\nUsing the Sylow theorems, we can determine the possible number of Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 2-subgroups in a group of order 18.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups (of order 9), the number of such subgroups must divide 18/9 = 2, and must also be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility is 1, which means there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 3-subgroup.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups (of order 2), the number of such subgroups must divide 18/2 = 9, and must also be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities are 1 and 9. If there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 2-subgroup, then the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which is abelian and already covered in the cases above.\n\nIf there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, we have a non-abelian group. Let P be the Sylow 3-subgroup and Q be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Since P is normal, we can form the semi-direct product of P and Q, denoted as P ⋊ Q. This gives us a non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nIn total, we have 4 abelian groups and 1 non-abelian group, so there are 5 distinct groups of order 18 up to isomorphism."
