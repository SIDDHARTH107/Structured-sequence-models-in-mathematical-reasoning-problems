    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G can be planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have v = 10 and e = 16. We can rearrange the formula to find the maximum number of faces for a planar graph:\n\nf = 2 - v + e\n\nf = 2 - 10 + 16\n\nf = 8\n\nNow, we can use the inequality derived from the Handshaking lemma for planar graphs:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for our graph:\n\n16 ≤ 3(10) - 6\n\n16 ≤ 30 - 6\n\n16 ≤ 24\n\nSince the inequality holds, it is possible that the graph G is planar. However, we need to find a planar representation to confirm this.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot draw a planar representation here, but you can try drawing the graph on paper or using graph visualization software to find a planar representation. If you can draw the graph without any edge crossings, then the graph is indeed planar."
