    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Quantum mechanics and Schrödinger equation:\n\nConsider a particle of mass 2 kg in a one-dimensional potential well defined by the function V(x) = 0 for 0 < x < a and V(x) = 6 eV for x > a. Solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system and find the energy levels of the particle using the boundary conditions that the wave function and its derivative are continuous at x = a. For simplicity, assume that the wave function is zero at x = 0. Take h-bar (ħ) = 1 and m = 1.",
    "message_2": "To solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system, we first need to write down the equation for the two regions (inside and outside the potential well).\n\nInside the potential well (0 < x < a), V(x) = 0, so the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\n(-ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) = E * ψ(x)\n\nSince ħ = 1 and m = 1, this simplifies to:\n\n(d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) = -2E * ψ(x)\n\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere k = sqrt(2E) and A, B are constants. Since the wave function is zero at x = 0, we have:\n\nψ(0) = A * sin(0) + B * cos(0) = B = 0\n\nSo, the wave function inside the well is:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx)\n\nOutside the potential well (x > a), V(x) = 6 eV, so the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\n(-ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) + 6eV * ψ(x) = E * ψ(x)\n\nSince ħ = 1 and m = 1, this simplifies to:\n\n(d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) = 2(E - 6eV) * ψ(x)\n\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\nψ(x) = C * e^(αx) + D * e^(-αx)\n\nwhere α = sqrt(2(E - 6eV)) and C, D are constants. Since the wave function must be normalizable, we require that ψ(x) -> 0 as x -> ∞. This implies that C = 0. So, the wave function outside the well is:\n\nψ(x) = D * e^(-αx)\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions at x = a. The wave function and its derivative must be continuous:\n\nA * sin(ka) = D * e^(-αa)\nA * k * cos(ka) = -D * α * e^(-αa)\n\nDividing the second equation by the first equation, we get:\n\nk * cot(ka) = -α\n\nThis transcendental equation determines the allowed energy levels E. To find the numerical values of E, we need to solve this equation for different values of a and the potential height (6 eV). The solutions will give us the energy levels of the particle inside the potential well."
