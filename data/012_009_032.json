    "message_2": "To determine the degree sequence of a graph with 6 vertices and 10 edges, we need to find the degrees of each vertex in the graph. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it. \n\nFirst, let's recall the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, we have:\n\nSum of degrees = 2 * 10 = 20\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum possible degree for a vertex in a graph with 6 vertices. A vertex can be connected to every other vertex, so the maximum degree is 5. \n\nLet's start by assuming that there is a vertex with the maximum degree of 5. Then, the remaining 5 vertices would have a total degree of 20 - 5 = 15. Since the maximum degree for the remaining vertices is also 5, we can have three vertices with a degree of 5 and the other two vertices with a degree of 2 each. This would give us a degree sequence of:\n\n5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 1\n\nHowever, this sequence is not graphical, as it violates the Havel-Hakimi theorem, which states that a non-increasing degree sequence is graphical if and only if the sequence obtained by deleting the first vertex and reducing the degrees of the next vertices by 1 is graphical. In this case, the sequence obtained after applying the Havel-Hakimi theorem is:\n\n4, 4, 1, 1\n\nThis sequence is not graphical, as it violates the Handshaking Lemma (the sum of degrees is not even). Therefore, we need to find another degree sequence.\n\nLet's try a different approach. We can distribute the degrees more evenly among the vertices. We can have two vertices with a degree of 4 and the other four vertices with a degree of 3 each. This would give us a degree sequence of:\n\n4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3\n\nThe sum of degrees is 20, which is equal to twice the number of edges, and the sequence is non-increasing. Applying the Havel-Hakimi theorem, we get:\n\n3, 2, 2, 2\n\nThis sequence is graphical, as it satisfies the Handshaking Lemma (the sum of degrees is even) and the Havel-Hakimi theorem. Therefore, the degree sequence of the graph with 6 vertices and 10 edges is:\n\n4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3"
