If the temperature is currently 25°C and the exponent remains constant, what is the maximum error after 10 days that the city's weather forecast can make when predicting the temperature, assuming an initial error of 0.1°C?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum error after 10 days, we can use the formula for the error growth in chaotic systems:\n\nError(t) = Error(0) * e^(λ * t)\n\nwhere Error(t) is the error after t days, Error(0) is the initial error, λ is the Lyapunov exponent, and t is the number of days.\n\nIn this case, the initial error Error(0) is 0.1°C, the Lyapunov exponent λ is 0.05 per day, and we want to find the error after 10 days (t = 10).\n\nError(10) = 0.1 * e^(0.05 * 10)\n\nError(10) = 0.1 * e^0.5\n\nError(10) ≈ 0.1 * 1.64872\n\nError(10) ≈ 0.16487°C\n\nSo, the maximum error after 10 days that the city's weather forecast can make when predicting the temperature is approximately 0.16487°C."
