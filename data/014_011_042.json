    "message_2": "A transposition cipher with 4 columns rearranges the letters of the plaintext by writing it in a grid with a fixed number of columns (in this case, 4) and then reading the letters in a different order.\n\nThe word \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\" has 12 letters. To use a transposition cipher with 4 columns, we need to arrange the letters in a grid with 4 columns and 3 rows (since 4 columns * 3 rows = 12).\n\nThe possible ways to rearrange the letters depend on the order in which we read the rows and columns. There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange the columns and 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the rows.\n\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n\nSo, there are 24 possible ways to arrange the columns and 6 possible ways to arrange the rows. To find the total number of possible rearrangements, we multiply the number of column arrangements by the number of row arrangements:\n\nTotal rearrangements = 24 (column arrangements) × 6 (row arrangements) = 144\n\nTherefore, there are 144 possible ways to rearrange the letters in the word \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\" using a transposition cipher with 4 columns."
