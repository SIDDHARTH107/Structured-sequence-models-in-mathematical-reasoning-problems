    "message_2": "To solve for x, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Add 2 to both sides of the equation.\n6x - 2 + 2 = 10 + 2\n\nStep 2: Simplify both sides of the equation.\n6x = 12\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 6.\n6x / 6 = 12 / 6\n\nStep 4: Simplify both sides of the equation.\nx = 2\n\nSo, the solution is x = 2."
