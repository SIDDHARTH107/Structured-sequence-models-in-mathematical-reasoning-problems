Let $\\mathbb{A}^2/G$ be the quotient variety of $\\mathbb{A}^2$ by this action. Find the Hilbert polynomial $P(m)$ for the coordinate ring of $\\mathbb{A}^2/G$ in terms of $m$, where $m$ is the degree of a polynomial.",
    "message_2": "Let $k[x,y]$ be the coordinate ring of $\\mathbb{A}^2$. We want to find the coordinate ring of $\\mathbb{A}^2/G$, which is the ring of invariants of the action of $G$ on $k[x,y]$. Since $g_1(x,y) = (x+1,y)$ and $g_2(x,y) = (x,y+1)$, we can see that the action of $G$ is generated by the translations $x \\mapsto x+1$ and $y \\mapsto y+1$. \n\nLet $R = k[x,y]^G$ be the ring of invariants. We want to find a set of generators for $R$. Consider the following polynomials:\n\n$$\nu = \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} x^i y^{m-i-1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v = \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} x^{m-i-1} y^i.\n$$\n\nThese polynomials are invariant under the action of $G$. Indeed, for any $g \\in G$:\n\n$$\ng(u) = u \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g(v) = v.\n$$\n\nNow, let $R_m$ be the space of invariants of degree $m$. Since $u$ and $v$ are invariant, we have:\n\n$$\nR_m = k[u,v]_m,\n$$\n\nwhere $k[u,v]_m$ is the space of polynomials in $u$ and $v$ of degree $m$. The dimension of $k[u,v]_m$ is $m+1$, since there are $m+1$ monomials of degree $m$ in $u$ and $v$. Therefore, the Hilbert polynomial $P(m)$ of the coordinate ring of $\\mathbb{A}^2/G$ is given by:\n\n$$\nP(m) = \\dim_k R_m = m+1.\n$$"
