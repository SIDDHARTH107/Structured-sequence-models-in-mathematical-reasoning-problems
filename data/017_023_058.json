    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the prime factorization of 72 and Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. Now, we will consider the possible Sylow subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, there are three possibilities: C_8, C_4 x C_2, and C_2 x C_2 x C_2. For the 3-Sylow subgroups, there are two possibilities: C_9 and C_3 x C_3.\n\nNow, we can combine these possibilities to form different groups:\n\n1. C_8 x C_9: This is a direct product of two cyclic groups, which results in a cyclic group of order 72, denoted as C_72.\n\n2. C_8 x (C_3 x C_3): This is a direct product of C_8 and C_3 x C_3, which results in a group of order 72, denoted as C_8 x C_3 x C_3.\n\n3. (C_4 x C_2) x C_9: This is a direct product of C_4 x C_2 and C_9, which results in a group of order 72, denoted as C_4 x C_2 x C_9.\n\n4. (C_4 x C_2) x (C_3 x C_3): This is a direct product of C_4 x C_2 and C_3 x C_3, which results in a group of order 72, denoted as C_4 x C_2 x C_3 x C_3.\n\n5. (C_2 x C_2 x C_2) x C_9: This is a direct product of C_2 x C_2 x C_2 and C_9, which results in a group of order 72, denoted as C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_9.\n\n6. (C_2 x C_2 x C_2) x (C_3 x C_3): This is a direct product of C_2 x C_2 x C_2 and C_3 x C_3, which results in a group of order 72, denoted as C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_3 x C_3.\n\nHowever, some of these groups are isomorphic to each other. After analyzing the groups, we find that there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 72:\n\n1. C_72: The cyclic group of order 72.\n2. C_8 x C_3 x C_3: The direct product of C_8 and C_3 x C_3.\n3. C_4 x C_2 x C_9: The direct product of C_4 x C_2 and C_9.\n4. C_4 x C_2 x C_3 x C_3: The direct product of C_4 x C_2 and C_3 x C_3.\n5. C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_9: The direct product of C_2 x C_2 x C_2 and C_9.\n\nSo, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
