    "message_1": "A system has 4 main components with individual probabilities of failure as follows: Component 1 (0.02), Component 2 (0.04), Component 3 (0.03), and Component 4 (0.01). What is the probability that the entire system fails? Assume that the components are independent.",
    "message_2": "Since the components are independent, the probability of the entire system failing is the product of the individual probabilities of failure for each component.\n\nP(system fails) = P(Component 1 fails) * P(Component 2 fails) * P(Component 3 fails) * P(Component 4 fails)\n\nP(system fails) = 0.02 * 0.04 * 0.03 * 0.01\n\nP(system fails) = 0.0000024\n\nSo, the probability that the entire system fails is 0.0000024 or 2.4 * 10^(-6)."
