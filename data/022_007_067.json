    "message_2": "To show that f(z) has a root in the open unit disk D = {z : |z| < 1}, we will use Rouché's theorem. Rouché's theorem states that if two complex functions g(z) and h(z) are holomorphic inside and on some simple closed contour C, and if |g(z) - h(z)| < |g(z)| + |h(z)| for all z on C, then g(z) and h(z) have the same number of zeros inside the contour C, counting multiplicities.\n\nLet g(z) = 3z^5 and h(z) = -2iz^3 - 7z^2 - 2. We want to show that |g(z) - f(z)| < |g(z)| + |h(z)| for all z on the boundary of the unit disk, i.e., |z| = 1.\n\nFor z on the boundary of the unit disk, we have:\n\n|g(z)| = |3z^5| = 3\n|h(z)| = |-2iz^3 - 7z^2 - 2| ≤ |-2iz^3| + |-7z^2| + |-2| = 2 + 7 + 2 = 11\n\nNow, let's compute |g(z) - f(z)|:\n\n|g(z) - f(z)| = |-2iz^3 - 7z^2 - 2| = |h(z)|\n\nWe want to show that |h(z)| < |g(z)| + |h(z)| for all z on the boundary of the unit disk:\n\n|h(z)| = |g(z) - f(z)| < |g(z)| + |h(z)|\n|h(z)| < 3 + 11\n|h(z)| < 14\n\nSince |h(z)| is always less than 14 for all z on the boundary of the unit disk, Rouché's theorem implies that g(z) and f(z) have the same number of zeros inside the unit disk. Since g(z) = 3z^5 has one zero (z = 0) inside the unit disk, f(z) must also have at least one zero inside the unit disk."
