    "message_1": "A conical tank has a radius of 5 meters and a height of 10 meters. What is the volume of water (in cubic meters) that the tank can hold when it is filled up to its brim?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius, h is the height, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 meters and the height (h) is 10 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(5)²(10)\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(25)(10)\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(250)\n\nVolume ≈ (1/3)(3.14159)(250)\n\nVolume ≈ 261.7994 cubic meters\n\nSo, the conical tank can hold approximately 261.8 cubic meters of water when filled up to its brim."
