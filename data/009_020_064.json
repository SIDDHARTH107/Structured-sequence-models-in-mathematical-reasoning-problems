    "message_2": "To minimize the cost function J, we can use the calculus of variations. We will consider the functional:\n\nF[y, u] = ∫[y^2(t) + u^2(t)] dt from 0 to T\n\nWe want to find the input signal u(t) that minimizes F[y, u]. To do this, we will use the Euler-Lagrange equation. First, let's rewrite the functional F[y, u] as:\n\nF[y, u] = ∫L(y, u, t) dt from 0 to T\n\nwhere L(y, u, t) = y^2(t) + u^2(t).\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to y and u:\n\n∂L/∂y = 2y(t)\n∂L/∂u = 2u(t)\n\nNext, we need to find the partial derivative of L with respect to y':\n\n∂L/∂y' = 0\n\nNow, we can apply the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\nd/dt(∂L/∂y') - ∂L/∂y = 0\n\nSince ∂L/∂y' = 0, we have:\n\n-∂L/∂y = 0\n\nPlugging in the expression for ∂L/∂y, we get:\n\n-2y(t) = 0\n\nThis implies that y(t) = 0. However, we know that y(t) is the output of the system, and it is related to the input signal u(t) through the given differential equation:\n\ndy/dt + 2y = u(t)\n\nSince y(t) = 0, we have:\n\ndy/dt = u(t)\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫dy = ∫u(t) dt\n\ny(t) = ∫u(t) dt + C\n\nSince y(0) = 0, we have:\n\n0 = ∫u(0) dt + C\n\nC = 0\n\nThus, the output of the system is:\n\ny(t) = ∫u(t) dt\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the expression for ∂L/∂u:\n\n2u(t) = 0\n\nThis implies that u(t) = 0.\n\nSo, the input signal u(t) that minimizes the cost function J is u(t) = 0."
