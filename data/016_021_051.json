    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal curve, and its Hausdorff dimension can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski arrowhead curve, there are 3 self-similar pieces (N = 3), and each piece is scaled down by a factor of 2 (S = 2).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve is:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2) â‰ˆ 1.5849625\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve is approximately 1.585."
