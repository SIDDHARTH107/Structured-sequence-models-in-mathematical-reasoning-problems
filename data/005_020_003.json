    "message_1": "Sure, here is a numerical problem for a math student in Statistics, Monte Carlo simulation:\n\nSuppose a company called XYZ wants to estimate the probability of having at least 5 customers in their store during a given hour. The average number of customers they usually receive during that hour is 4. To estimate this probability, they run a Monte Carlo simulation of 100,000 trials. Each trial randomly generates the number of customers they have during that hour, assuming a Poisson distribution with a mean of 4. \n\nWhat is the estimated probability that XYZ will have at least 5 customers in their store during a given hour, based on the results of the Monte Carlo simulation? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Poisson distribution formula and the Monte Carlo simulation. The Poisson distribution formula is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of customers, k is the number of customers we are interested in (5 in this case), λ is the average number of customers (4 in this case), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of having 0 to 4 customers using the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-4) * 4^0) / 0! ≈ 0.0183\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-4) * 4^1) / 1! ≈ 0.0732\nP(X = 2) = (e^(-4) * 4^2) / 2! ≈ 0.1465\nP(X = 3) = (e^(-4) * 4^3) / 3! ≈ 0.1953\nP(X = 4) = (e^(-4) * 4^4) / 4! ≈ 0.1953\n\nNow, we will find the probability of having at least 5 customers by subtracting the sum of the probabilities of having 0 to 4 customers from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4))\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - (0.0183 + 0.0732 + 0.1465 + 0.1953 + 0.1953) ≈ 0.3714\n\nSo, based on the Monte Carlo simulation, the estimated probability that XYZ will have at least 5 customers in their store during a given hour is approximately 0.37 or 37%."
