The cost of grazing on their own land is $8 per acre, while the cost of grazing on the common pasture is $10 per acre. If each farmer acts in their own self-interest and grazes their cattle only on the common pasture, what is the total cost shared by the farmers? And, what would be the total savings if all the farmers graze only on their own land?",
    "message_2": "If each farmer acts in their own self-interest and grazes their cattle only on the common pasture, they would each use 4 acres of the common pasture (20 acres / 5 farmers = 4 acres per farmer). At a cost of $10 per acre, each farmer would spend $40 on grazing their cattle on the common pasture (4 acres * $10 per acre = $40). \n\nThe total cost shared by the farmers would be $200 ($40 per farmer * 5 farmers = $200).\n\nIf all the farmers graze only on their own land, they would each use 4 acres of their own land. At a cost of $8 per acre, each farmer would spend $32 on grazing their cattle on their own land (4 acres * $8 per acre = $32).\n\nThe total cost for all farmers grazing on their own land would be $160 ($32 per farmer * 5 farmers = $160).\n\nThe total savings if all the farmers graze only on their own land would be $40 ($200 - $160 = $40)."
