    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to determine the maximum profit it can earn by producing two types of products, X and Y. The company has a budget of $200,000 for raw materials and can produce a maximum of 500 units of each product. Each unit of X requires $100 of raw material and 4 hours of labor, while each unit of Y requires $150 of raw material and 3 hours of labor. The selling price of each unit of X is $500, and each unit of Y is $600. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y.\n\nThe constraints for this problem are:\n\n1. Raw material constraint: 100x + 150y ≤ 200,000\n2. Production constraint: x ≤ 500 and y ≤ 500\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize profit is:\n\nProfit = 500x + 600y\n\nFirst, we will solve the raw material constraint for y:\n\n150y ≤ 200,000 - 100x\ny ≤ (200,000 - 100x) / 150\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by considering the constraints:\n\n1. x ≤ 500\n2. y ≤ (200,000 - 100x) / 150\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nWe will find the corner points of the feasible region by solving the system of inequalities:\n\n1. (x, y) = (0, 0)\n2. (x, y) = (500, 0)\n3. (x, y) = (0, (200,000 - 100*0) / 150) = (0, 1333.33) but y ≤ 500, so (x, y) = (0, 500)\n4. (x, y) = (500, (200,000 - 100*500) / 150) = (500, 200)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n1. Profit(0, 0) = 500*0 + 600*0 = $0\n2. Profit(500, 0) = 500*500 + 600*0 = $250,000\n3. Profit(0, 500) = 500*0 + 600*500 = $300,000\n4. Profit(500, 200) = 500*500 + 600*200 = $370,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $370,000, which occurs when the company produces 500 units of product X and 200 units of product Y."
