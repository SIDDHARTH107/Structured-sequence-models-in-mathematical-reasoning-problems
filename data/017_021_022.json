    "message_2": "To determine the possible number of non-abelian groups of order 48, we can use the Sylow theorems and the fact that a group of order 48 has the form 2^4 * 3. Let's denote the number of Sylow 2-subgroups as n_2 and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups as n_3.\n\nBy Sylow's theorems, we have:\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 16 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we have the following possibilities:\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1\n2. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1\n3. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4\n4. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4\n\nNow, let's analyze each case:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. The group is a semi-direct product of these two subgroups, and since both are unique, the group is actually a direct product, which is abelian. So, this case does not give us a non-abelian group.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. The group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, there are two non-isomorphic semi-direct products, which give us two non-abelian groups.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. The group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since there are four Sylow 3-subgroups, there are three non-isomorphic semi-direct products, which give us three non-abelian groups.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is no unique normal Sylow subgroup, so we cannot form a semi-direct product. Therefore, this case does not give us any non-abelian groups.\n\nIn total, we have 2 + 3 = 5 non-abelian groups of order 48. These groups are:\n\n1. The semi-direct product of Q8 (Quaternion group of order 8) and Z_6 (Cyclic group of order 6)\n2. The semi-direct product of D8 (Dihedral group of order 8) and Z_6\n3. The semi-direct product of Z_4 × Z_2 (Direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 4 and 2) and Z_6\n4. The semi-direct product of Z_4 × Z_2 and Z_3 × Z_2 (Direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 3 and 2)\n5. The semi-direct product of D8 and Z_3 × Z_2"
