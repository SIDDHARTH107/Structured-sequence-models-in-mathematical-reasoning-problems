    "message_1": "A building is 100 meters tall. From a distance of 150 meters, the angle of elevation to the top of the building is 30 degrees. Calculate the height of the building up to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using trigonometry. Let's consider a right triangle formed by the building, the ground, and the line of sight to the top of the building. The height of the building is the side opposite the 30-degree angle, and the distance from the observer to the building is the adjacent side.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to relate the angle, the height of the building (opposite side), and the distance from the observer to the building (adjacent side):\n\ntan(angle) = opposite / adjacent\n\nLet h be the height of the building. Then:\n\ntan(30) = h / 150\n\nTo find the height, h, we can rearrange the equation and solve for h:\n\nh = 150 * tan(30)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nh = 150 * 0.57735026919 (approximate value of tan(30))\nh â‰ˆ 86.60 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 86.60 meters."
