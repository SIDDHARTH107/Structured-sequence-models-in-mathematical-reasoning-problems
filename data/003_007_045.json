    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle in the triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and angles A, B, and C opposite those sides respectively:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, we have a = 7 cm, b = 10 cm, and c = 12 cm. We want to find the smallest angle, which will be opposite the shortest side (a = 7 cm). So, we want to find angle A.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines:\n\n12^2 = 7^2 + 10^2 - 2 * 7 * 10 * cos(A)\n\n144 = 49 + 100 - 140 * cos(A)\n\n-5 = -140 * cos(A)\n\ncos(A) = 5/140\n\nNow, we can use the inverse cosine function to find the angle A:\n\nA = arccos(5/140)\n\nA â‰ˆ 80.41 degrees\n\nTherefore, the smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 80 degrees when rounded to the nearest degree."
