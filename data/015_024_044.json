    "message_2": "To solve the fourth-order Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with the given initial condition and parameters, we can use a numerical method such as the finite difference method or spectral method. Here, we will use the spectral method with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for simplicity and efficiency.\n\nThe fourth-order Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = -u∂u/∂x - ∂²u/∂x² - ∂⁴u/∂x⁴\n\nFirst, let's discretize the spatial domain and set up the initial condition:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nL = 2 * np.pi\nN = int(L / 0.1)\nx = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, N, endpoint=False)\nu0 = np.exp(-x**2) * np.cos(x)\n\nNow, we will set up the time-stepping loop using the spectral method:\n\nfrom scipy.fftpack import fft, ifft\n\ndt = 0.01\nT = 20\nNt = int(T / dt)\n\nk = np.fft.fftfreq(N) * N * 2 * np.pi / L\nk2 = k**2\nk4 = k**4\n\nu = u0.copy()\n\nfor _ in range(Nt):\n    u_hat = fft(u)\n    u_x = ifft(1j * k * u_hat).real\n    u_xx = ifft(-k2 * u_hat).real\n    u_xxxx = ifft(k4 * u_hat).real\n    \n    u = u - dt * (u * u_x + u_xx + u_xxxx)\n\nThe solution `u` after T = 20 seconds is now stored in the variable `u`. Note that this is a numerical solution, and due to the chaotic nature of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, small changes in the initial condition or parameters may lead to different results."
