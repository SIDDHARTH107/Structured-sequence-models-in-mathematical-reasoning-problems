    "message_2": "To find the inverse Fourier transform of the function f(w) = (2i)/(w^2 + 1)^2, we need to compute the following integral:\n\nf(t) = (1/(2π)) ∫[e^(iwt) * (2i)/(w^2 + 1)^2] dw, from -∞ to ∞\n\nSince we are only interested in t > 0, we can use the Laplace transform method to solve this integral. We first rewrite the function f(w) in terms of the Laplace transform:\n\nF(s) = L[f(t)] = ∫[e^(-st) * f(t)] dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we need to find the Laplace transform of the function f(t). We can do this by finding the Laplace transform of the derivative of f(t):\n\nF'(s) = L[f'(t)] = ∫[e^(-st) * f'(t)] dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nWe know that the Laplace transform of the second derivative of f(t) is given by:\n\nF''(s) = L[f''(t)] = s^2 * F(s) - s * f(0) - f'(0)\n\nSince f(t) is the inverse Fourier transform of f(w), we have:\n\nf(0) = 0 and f'(0) = 0\n\nThus, F''(s) = s^2 * F(s)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s):\n\nf(t) = L^(-1)[F(s)] = L^(-1)[(2i)/(s^2 + 1)^2]\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nf(t) = L^(-1)[(2i)/(s^2 + 1)^2] = L^(-1)[(2i) * (s^2 + 1)^(-2)]\n\nUsing the inverse Laplace transform table, we find that:\n\nf(t) = t * e^(-t)\n\nSo, the inverse Fourier transform of the function f(w) = (2i)/(w^2 + 1)^2 for t > 0 is:\n\nf(t) = t * e^(-t)"
