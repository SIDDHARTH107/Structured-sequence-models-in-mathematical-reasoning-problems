    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the function f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 5 on the interval [0, 1], we will use the Fourier series representation of a function on a finite interval. For a function f(x) defined on the interval [0, L], the Fourier series representation is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients and are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) dx] from 0 to L\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nIn our case, f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 5 and L = 1. So, we can find the Fourier coefficients as follows:\n\na_0 = ∫[f(x) dx] from 0 to 1\na_0 = ∫[(x^2 - 3x + 5) dx] from 0 to 1\na_0 = [(1/3)x^3 - (3/2)x^2 + 5x] from 0 to 1\na_0 = (1/3 - 3/2 + 5) - (0) = 1/3 - 3/2 + 5 = 11/6\n\na_n = 2 * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx) dx] from 0 to 1\na_n = 2 * ∫[(x^2 - 3x + 5) * cos(nπx) dx] from 0 to 1\na_n = 2 * [(2/(n^3π^3)) * (2cos(nπ) - nπsin(nπ) - 2nπcos(nπ) - 2) - (1/(n^2π^2)) * (cos(nπ) - 1)] (using integration by parts)\na_n = 2 * [(2/(n^3π^3)) * (2(-1)^n - 2) - (1/(n^2π^2)) * ((-1)^n - 1)]\n\nb_n = 2 * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 1\nb_n = 2 * ∫[(x^2 - 3x + 5) * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 1\nb_n = 2 * [(-1/(n^2π^2)) * (cos(nπ) - 1) + (1/(nπ)) * sin(nπ)] (using integration by parts)\nb_n = 0 (since sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n)\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients for the function f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 5 on the interval [0, 1] are:\n\na_0 = 11/6\na_n = 2 * [(2/(n^3π^3)) * (2(-1)^n - 2) - (1/(n^2π^2)) * ((-1)^n - 1)]\nb_n = 0"
