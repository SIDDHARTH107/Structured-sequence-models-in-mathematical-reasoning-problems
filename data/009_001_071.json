    "message_1": "Suppose the population of a certain city is initially 500,000 and has an annual growth rate of 2.5% continuously compounded. Write and solve the differential equation for the population growth over time. What will be the population after 10 years?",
    "message_2": "To model the population growth, we can use the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population, t is time in years, and k is the continuous growth rate.\n\nGiven that the annual growth rate is 2.5%, we can express it as a decimal: k = 0.025.\n\nNow, we have the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = 0.025P\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\n(1/P) dP = 0.025 dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫0.025 dt\nln(P) = 0.025t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 500,000:\n\nln(500,000) = 0.025(0) + C\nC = ln(500,000)\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\nln(P) = 0.025t + ln(500,000)\n\nTo find the population after 10 years, we can plug in t = 10:\n\nln(P) = 0.025(10) + ln(500,000)\n\nNow, we can exponentiate both sides to solve for P:\n\nP = e^(0.025(10) + ln(500,000))\nP ≈ e^(0.25 + ln(500,000))\nP ≈ e^(ln(500,000 * e^0.25))\nP ≈ 500,000 * e^0.25\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP ≈ 500,000 * 1.284\nP ≈ 642,025\n\nSo, after 10 years, the population will be approximately 642,025."
