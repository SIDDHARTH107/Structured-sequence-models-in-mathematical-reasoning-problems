    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that can be constructed using a recursive process. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of (√7).\n\nTo find the length of the Gosper curve after the first five iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length × (√7)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 5 iterations:\n\nLength = 1 × (√7)^5\nLength ≈ 1 × 168.0944\nLength ≈ 168.0944 units\n\nSo, the length of the Gosper curve after the first five iterations is approximately 168.0944 units."
