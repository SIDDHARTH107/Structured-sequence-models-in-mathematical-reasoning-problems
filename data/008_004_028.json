    "message_2": "To solve the given homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. The given system of equations is:\n\nx + 2y - z = 0\n2x + 5y - 3z = 0\n4x + 8y - 4z = 0\n\nFirst, we write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n| 1  2 -1 | 0\n| 2  5 -3 | 0\n| 4  8 -4 | 0\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 4 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  2 -1 | 0\n| 0  1  1 | 0\n| 0  0  0 | 0\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can see that the third row represents the equation 0 = 0, which is always true and doesn't provide any new information. So, we can ignore it.\n\nNow, we can write the system of equations corresponding to the row-echelon form:\n\nx + 2y - z = 0\ny + z = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this system using back-substitution. From the second equation, we have:\n\nz = -y\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\nx + 2y - (-y) = x + 3y = 0\n\nNow, we can express x in terms of y:\n\nx = -3y\n\nSince this is a homogeneous system, the solution is given by the set of all possible values of y:\n\nx = -3y\nz = -y\n\nThe solution set is given by the parametric representation:\n\nx = -3t\ny = t\nz = -t\n\nwhere t is any real number."
