    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z - i), we need to solve the equation z^3 - 1 = 0. This equation can be factored as (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) = 0. The zeros of the function are z = 1, and the complex conjugate pair z = (-1 ± √3i)/2.\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these zeros lie inside the unit circle |z| = 1. \n\nFor z = 1, the magnitude is |1| = 1, which is on the unit circle but not inside it.\n\nFor the complex conjugate pair z = (-1 ± √3i)/2, the magnitude is |(-1 ± √3i)/2| = √[(-1/2)^2 + (±√3/2)^2] = √(1/4 + 3/4) = √1 = 1, which is also on the unit circle but not inside it.\n\nThus, there are no zeros of the function f(z) inside the unit circle.\n\nNow, let's find the poles of the function. The poles occur when the denominator is equal to zero, i.e., when z - i = 0. The only pole is z = i.\n\nTo determine if this pole lies inside the unit circle, we need to find its magnitude: |i| = √(0^2 + 1^2) = 1. The pole is on the unit circle but not inside it.\n\nTherefore, there are no zeros and no poles of the function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z - i) that lie inside the unit circle |z| = 1."
