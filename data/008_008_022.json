    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: chairs and tables. Each chair requires 4 feet of lumber and 2 hours of labor. Each table requires 6 feet of lumber and 3 hours of labor. The company has 2000 feet of lumber and 800 hours of labor available per week. The profit per chair is $20 and per table is $30. What is the maximum profit that can be earned per week if the company decides to produce chairs and tables using linear programming matrix methods?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of chairs produced as x and the number of tables produced as y. We are given the following constraints:\n\n4x + 6y ≤ 2000 (lumber constraint)\n2x + 3y ≤ 800 (labor constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\nP(x, y) = 20x + 30y\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\nLumber constraint: y ≤ (2000 - 4x) / 6\nLabor constraint: y ≤ (800 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by plotting these constraints on a graph:\n\n1. Lumber constraint: y = (2000 - 4x) / 6\n2. Labor constraint: y = (800 - 2x) / 3\n3. x-axis: y = 0\n4. y-axis: x = 0\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon formed by the intersection of these constraints. To find the vertices of this polygon, we'll solve the system of equations formed by the intersection of each pair of lines:\n\n1. Intersection of lumber constraint and labor constraint:\n(2000 - 4x) / 6 = (800 - 2x) / 3\n2000 - 4x = 1600 - 4x\nx = 0\n\ny = (800 - 2(0)) / 3\ny = 800 / 3\ny = 800/3\n\nVertex A: (0, 800/3)\n\n2. Intersection of lumber constraint and x-axis:\ny = 0\nx = (2000 - 6(0)) / 4\nx = 500\n\nVertex B: (500, 0)\n\n3. Intersection of labor constraint and y-axis:\nx = 0\ny = (800 - 2(0)) / 3\ny = 800 / 3\n\nVertex C: (0, 800/3)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 30y at each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 20(0) + 30(800/3) = 0 + 8000 = 8000\nP(B) = 20(500) + 30(0) = 10000 + 0 = 10000\nP(C) = 20(0) + 30(800/3) = 0 + 8000 = 8000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex B (500, 0), which corresponds to producing 500 chairs and 0 tables. The maximum profit that can be earned per week is $10,000."
