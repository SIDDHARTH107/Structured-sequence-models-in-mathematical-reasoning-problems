    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA metal rod of length 10 cm is initially at a uniform temperature of 80°C. Its left end is in contact with a heat source at 120°C and its right end is in contact with a heat sink at 60°C. Assuming that the rod loses heat only by conduction, find the temperature distribution in the rod at steady state. You can assume that the thermal conductivity of the rod is 50 W/mK and its cross-sectional area is 1 cm².",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the steady-state heat equation, which is given by:\n\nd²T/dx² = 0\n\nwhere T is the temperature and x is the position along the rod.\n\nWe also have the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0) = 120°C (left end)\nT(10) = 60°C (right end)\n\nLet's assume the temperature distribution in the rod is linear, so we can write it as:\n\nT(x) = Ax + B\n\nNow we can find the constants A and B using the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0) = A * 0 + B = 120°C\nB = 120°C\n\nT(10) = A * 10 + 120 = 60°C\nA = (60 - 120) / 10\nA = -6°C/cm\n\nSo, the temperature distribution in the rod at steady state is:\n\nT(x) = -6x + 120\n\nNow we can find the heat flux (q) through the rod using Fourier's Law:\n\nq = -kA(dT/dx)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity and A is the cross-sectional area.\n\nThe derivative of T(x) with respect to x is:\n\ndT/dx = -6\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n\nq = -50 W/mK * 1 cm² * (-6°C/cm)\nq = 300 W/m\n\nSo, the heat flux through the rod is 300 W/m, and the temperature distribution at steady state is T(x) = -6x + 120."
