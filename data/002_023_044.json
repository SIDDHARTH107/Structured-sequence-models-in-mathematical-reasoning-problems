    "message_2": "The formula for the surface area of a sphere is given by:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 4 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (4 cm)^2\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 16 cm^2\nSurface Area = 64 * π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 64π square centimeters, or approximately 201.06 square centimeters when rounded to two decimal places."
