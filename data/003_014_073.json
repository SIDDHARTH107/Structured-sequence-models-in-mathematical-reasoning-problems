    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the function f(x) = 4sin(2x + 3), we need to analyze the equation and compare it to the general form of a sine function: A*sin(Bx + C).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA = 4\nB = 2\nC = 3\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of A, which represents the maximum value of the sine function from the midline. In this case, the amplitude is |4| = 4.\n\n2. Period: The period is the length of one complete cycle of the sine function. It is calculated as 2π divided by the absolute value of B. In this case, the period is 2π/|2| = 2π/2 = π.\n\n3. Phase Shift: The phase shift is the horizontal shift of the sine function. It is calculated as -C/B. In this case, the phase shift is -3/2 = -1.5. This means the function is shifted 1.5 units to the left.\n\nSo, the amplitude is 4, the period is π, and the phase shift is -1.5 (to the left)."
