Since A and B are not specified, we can assume that U = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Therefore, the Cartesian product U × U = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}.\n\nNow, we can find the complement of A × B, (A × B)':\n\n(A × B)' = U × U - A × B = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)} - {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNow let's find the complements of A and B:\n\nA' = U - A = {3, 4}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2}\n\nNow we can find the Cartesian product A' × B':\n\nA' × B' = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nComparing (A × B)' and A' × B', we can see that they are not equal:\n\n(A × B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\nA' × B' = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nTherefore, the statement (A × B)' = A' × B' is false."
