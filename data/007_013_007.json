    "message_1": "What is the sum of two prime numbers that add up to 50? (This relates to Goldbach's conjecture, which proposes that every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.)",
    "message_2": "There are multiple solutions to this problem. One possible solution is the sum of the prime numbers 3 and 47, which add up to 50 (3 + 47 = 50). Another solution is the sum of the prime numbers 19 and 31, which also add up to 50 (19 + 31 = 50)."
