Determine the value of $\\theta _{10}(x)\\theta _{10}(y) - \\theta _{01}(x)\\theta _{01}(y)$, where $\\theta _{10}$ and $\\theta _{01}$ are the famous Theta functions.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the roots of the equation $t^2 + 2t + 1 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and we can rewrite it as $(t+1)^2 = 0$. Therefore, the only root is $t = -1$. Since the equation has a double root, both x and y are equal to -1.\n\nNow, let's recall the definitions of the famous Theta functions:\n\n$\\theta_{10}(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\pi i n^2 z}$\n\n$\\theta_{01}(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\pi i (n+\\frac{1}{2})^2 z}$\n\nWe need to find the value of $\\theta _{10}(x)\\theta _{10}(y) - \\theta _{01}(x)\\theta _{01}(y)$, where $x = y = -1$.\n\n$\\theta _{10}(-1)\\theta _{10}(-1) - \\theta _{01}(-1)\\theta _{01}(-1)$\n\nSince both x and y are equal to -1, we can simplify this expression as:\n\n$(\\theta _{10}(-1))^2 - (\\theta _{01}(-1))^2$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the Theta functions at -1:\n\n$\\theta_{10}(-1) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\pi i n^2 (-1)} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-1)^{n^2}$\n\n$\\theta_{01}(-1) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\pi i (n+\\frac{1}{2})^2 (-1)} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-1)^{(n+\\frac{1}{2})^2}$\n\nNotice that the series for $\\theta_{10}(-1)$ and $\\theta_{01}(-1)$ are both alternating series. Moreover, the series for $\\theta_{10}(-1)$ contains all even powers of -1, while the series for $\\theta_{01}(-1)$ contains all odd powers of -1. Therefore, the series for $\\theta_{10}(-1)$ and $\\theta_{01}(-1)$ are equal to each other, except for the sign.\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$(\\theta _{10}(-1))^2 - (\\theta _{01}(-1))^2 = 0$\n\nSo, the value of $\\theta _{10}(x)\\theta _{10}(y) - \\theta _{01}(x)\\theta _{01}(y)$ is 0."
