    "message_2": "To find the sum of residues of the given function inside the unit circle, we first need to identify its poles. The poles of the function are the points where the denominator is zero, i.e., where $(z+3)^3(z-1)^2 = 0$. This occurs when $z = -3$ and $z = 1$. However, only $z = 1$ lies inside the unit circle.\n\nNow we need to find the residue of the function at $z = 1$. Since the pole at $z = 1$ is of order 2, we can find the residue using the following formula:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f(z), 1) = \\lim_{z \\to 1} \\frac{d}{dz} \\left((z-1)^2 f(z)\\right)$$\n\nLet's first compute $(z-1)^2 f(z)$:\n\n$$(z-1)^2 f(z) = \\frac{\\pi \\cot(\\pi z)}{(z+3)^3}$$\n\nNow we need to differentiate this expression with respect to $z$:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dz} \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\cot(\\pi z)}{(z+3)^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\left(-\\pi \\csc^2(\\pi z)\\right)(z+3)^3 - 3(z+3)^2 \\cot(\\pi z)}{(z+3)^6}$$\n\nNow we need to evaluate this expression at $z = 1$:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dz} \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\cot(\\pi z)}{(z+3)^3}\\right) \\Bigg|_{z=1} = \\frac{\\pi \\left(-\\pi \\csc^2(\\pi)\\right)(1+3)^3 - 3(1+3)^2 \\cot(\\pi)}{(1+3)^6}$$\n\nSince $\\cot(\\pi) = \\cot(0) = 0$ and $\\csc(\\pi) = \\csc(0) = 0$, the expression simplifies to:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dz} \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\cot(\\pi z)}{(z+3)^3}\\right) \\Bigg|_{z=1} = 0$$\n\nThus, the sum of residues of the function inside the unit circle is 0."
