    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: chairs and tables. The company has a total of 80 units of wood, 60 units of steel, and 12 labor hours available per day. To produce a chair, they need 2 units of wood, 1 unit of steel, and 1 labor hour. To produce a table, they need 3 units of wood, 2 units of steel, and 2 labor hours. The company wants to maximize its daily profit. A chair earns a profit of $10 and a table earns a profit of $30. How many chairs and tables should the company produce to maximize its profit while considering the limited resources?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced.\n\nThe constraints based on the resources are as follows:\n\nWood: 2x + 3y ≤ 80\nSteel: x + 2y ≤ 60\nLabor: x + 2y ≤ 12\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 30y\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 80\ny ≤ (80 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. x + 2y ≤ 60\ny ≤ (60 - x) / 2\n\n3. x + 2y ≤ 12\ny ≤ (12 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these inequalities. The corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 20), (12, 0), and (4, 4).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each corner point:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0) = 10(0) + 30(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0, 20) = 10(0) + 30(20) = $600\n3. Profit at (12, 0) = 10(12) + 30(0) = $120\n4. Profit at (4, 4) = 10(4) + 30(4) = $160\n\nThe maximum profit is $600, which occurs when the company produces 0 chairs and 20 tables."
