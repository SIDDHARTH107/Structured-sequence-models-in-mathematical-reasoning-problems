    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 7 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 12 cm. What is the total surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: top, bottom, left, right, front, and back.\n\nThe area of the top and bottom faces can be found by multiplying the length by the width:\nArea_top_bottom = 7 cm * 5 cm = 35 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces (top and bottom), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_top_bottom = 35 cm² * 2 = 70 cm²\n\nThe area of the left and right faces can be found by multiplying the height by the width:\nArea_left_right = 12 cm * 5 cm = 60 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces (left and right), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_left_right = 60 cm² * 2 = 120 cm²\n\nThe area of the front and back faces can be found by multiplying the length by the height:\nArea_front_back = 7 cm * 12 cm = 84 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces (front and back), we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_front_back = 84 cm² * 2 = 168 cm²\n\nNow, we add the total areas of all the faces together:\nTotal_surface_area = Total_area_top_bottom + Total_area_left_right + Total_area_front_back\nTotal_surface_area = 70 cm² + 120 cm² + 168 cm² = 358 cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 358 cm²."
