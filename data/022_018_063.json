    "message_2": "To solve this partial differential equation with the given boundary conditions, we will use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $y$:\n\n$$u(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$$\n\nSubstitute this into the partial differential equation:\n\n$$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $x$ and the right side depends only on $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2, \\quad \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda^2$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$$\n$$Y''(y) - \\lambda^2 Y(y) = 0$$\n\nSolve the first equation for $X(x)$:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) + B\\sin(\\lambda x)$$\n\nApply the boundary conditions $u(0,y) = 0$ and $u(a,y) = 0$:\n\n$$X(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 0$$\n$$X(a) = A\\cos(\\lambda a) + B\\sin(\\lambda a) = 0$$\n\nSince $A = 0$, we have:\n\n$$X(x) = B\\sin(\\lambda x)$$\n\nFor non-trivial solutions, we require $B \\neq 0$ and $\\sin(\\lambda a) = 0$. This implies that $\\lambda = \\frac{n\\pi}{a}$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$X_n(x) = B_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$$\n\nNow, solve the second equation for $Y(y)$:\n\n$$Y(y) = C\\cosh(\\lambda y) + D\\sinh(\\lambda y)$$\n\nApply the boundary conditions $u(x,0) = f(x)$ and $u(x,b) = g(x)$:\n\n$$Y(0) = C\\cosh(0) + D\\sinh(0) = C = f(x)$$\n$$Y(b) = C\\cosh(\\lambda b) + D\\sinh(\\lambda b) = g(x)$$\n\nSince $C = f(x)$, we have:\n\n$$Y_n(y) = f_n\\cosh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{a}\\right) + D_n\\sinh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{a}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as a sum over all possible values of $n$:\n\n$$u(x,y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\left[f_n\\cosh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{a}\\right) + D_n\\sinh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{a}\\right)\\right]$$\n\nTo determine the coefficients $B_n$, $f_n$, and $D_n$, we need to use the given functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. This can be done using Fourier series techniques, but the specific expressions for these coefficients will depend on the forms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$."
