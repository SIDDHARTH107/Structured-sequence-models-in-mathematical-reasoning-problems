    "message_2": "Edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In this case, we can see that by removing the following 3 edges, the graph will be disconnected:\n\n1. Edge between vertices 1 and 2\n2. Edge between vertices 2 and 5\n3. Edge between vertices 4 and 5\n\nAfter removing these edges, the graph will be disconnected as follows:\n\n```\n   4    5 -- 6 -- 7 -- 8\n   |         |    |    |\n   3 -- 2    1    0    9\n```\n\nThere is no way to disconnect the graph by removing fewer than 3 edges. Therefore, the edge connectivity of the graph is 3."
