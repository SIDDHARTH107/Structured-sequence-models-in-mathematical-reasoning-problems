    "message_2": "The power rule of differentiation states that if you have a function f(x) = ax^n, then its derivative f'(x) = n*ax^(n-1).\n\nIn this case, f(x) = 5x^3, so a = 5 and n = 3. Applying the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3 * 5x^(3-1) = 15x^2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^3 is f'(x) = 15x^2."
