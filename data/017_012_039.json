    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 16 with exactly 2 elements of order 2. Let a and b be the two elements of order 2 in G. Since G has order 16, by Sylow's Theorem, G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 16. Since G is a p-group, G is equal to P.\n\nNow, let's consider the center of G, denoted by Z(G). Since G is a p-group, Z(G) is nontrivial. We know that a and b are in G, and both have order 2. Since the order of elements in Z(G) must divide the order of G, the possible orders of elements in Z(G) are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. The identity element of G is in Z(G) and has order 1. If there is an element of order 4 or 8 in Z(G), then G would have more than 2 elements of order 2, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, Z(G) must have only elements of order 1 and 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient group G/Z(G). Since |G| = 16 and |Z(G)| divides |G|, the possible orders of G/Z(G) are 2, 4, 8, and 16. If |G/Z(G)| = 2, then G is abelian, which contradicts the fact that G has only 2 elements of order 2. If |G/Z(G)| = 4 or 8, then G/Z(G) has more than 2 elements of order 2, which again contradicts our assumption. Therefore, |G/Z(G)| = 16, which implies that Z(G) is trivial and consists only of the identity element.\n\nNow, let's consider the automorphism group of G, denoted by Aut(G). Since G is a group of order 16, Aut(G) has order 16 or 8 (by a theorem on automorphism groups of p-groups). If |Aut(G)| = 16, then Aut(G) has more than 2 elements of order 2, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, |Aut(G)| = 8.\n\nNow, let's consider the semidirect product of G and Aut(G), denoted by G ⋊ Aut(G). This is a group of order 16 × 8 = 128. Since G has only 2 elements of order 2 and Aut(G) has 8 elements, G ⋊ Aut(G) has 2 × 8 = 16 elements of order 2. The dihedral group D8 also has 16 elements of order 2. Moreover, G ⋊ Aut(G) has a normal subgroup isomorphic to G and a subgroup isomorphic to Aut(G), which is similar to the structure of D8.\n\nBy the structure theorem for finite groups, G ⋊ Aut(G) is isomorphic to D8. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8."
