    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration (level), smaller cubes are removed from the remaining larger cubes.\n\nFor a level 1 Menger sponge, we start with a 3x3x3 cube and remove the central cube from each face and the central cube of the whole 3x3x3 cube. This results in 20 cubes remaining.\n\nFor a level 2 Menger sponge, we apply the same process to each of the 20 remaining cubes from level 1. Each of these cubes will have 20 smaller cubes remaining after the process. So, for level 2, there are 20 * 20 = 400 cubes.\n\nFor a level 3 Menger sponge, we apply the same process to each of the 400 remaining cubes from level 2. Each of these cubes will have 20 smaller cubes remaining after the process. So, for level 3, there are 400 * 20 = 8000 cubes."
