    "message_2": "To apply the Jacobi iterative method, we first rewrite the given system of linear equations in the form x = f(x, y, z), y = g(x, y, z), and z = h(x, y, z):\n\nx = (3 - y + z) / 2\ny = (-7 + 3x + 4z) / 4\nz = (-1 - x + y)\n\nNow, we use the initial guess (0,0,0) and perform 2 iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = (3 - 0 + 0) / 2 = 1.5\ny1 = (-7 + 3*0 + 4*0) / 4 = -1.75\nz1 = (-1 - 0 + 0) = -1\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = (3 - (-1.75) + (-1)) / 2 = 1.375\ny2 = (-7 + 3*1.5 + 4*(-1)) / 4 = -1.25\nz2 = (-1 - 1.5 + (-1.75)) = -4.25\n\nSo after 2 iterations, the values of x, y, and z are approximately x = 1.375, y = -1.25, and z = -4.25."
