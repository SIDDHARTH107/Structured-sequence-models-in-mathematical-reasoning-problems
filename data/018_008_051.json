    "message_2": "AxB, also known as the Cartesian product of A and B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. Similarly, BxA is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is an element of B and a is an element of A.\n\nAxB = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nBxA = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, AxB and BxA are not equal because the ordered pairs in each set are different. For example, (1, 4) is in AxB but not in BxA, and (4, 1) is in BxA but not in AxB."
