    "message_1": "Consider the relevance logic system R, where the connective → is understood as material implication, but with the additional requirement that the antecedent must be relevant to the consequent. Suppose p → q is a theorem in R. If p is a theorem in R, what can we conclude about q?",
    "message_2": "If p → q is a theorem in the relevance logic system R, and p is also a theorem in R, then we can conclude that q is a theorem in R as well. This is because, in relevance logic, the antecedent (p) must be relevant to the consequent (q) for the implication to hold. Since p is a theorem and p → q is also a theorem, it follows that q must be a theorem in R."
