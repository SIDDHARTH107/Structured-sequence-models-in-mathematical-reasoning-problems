    "message_1": "A factory produces light bulbs with a lifespan that follows a normal distribution with a mean of 800 hours and a standard deviation of 50 hours. What percentage of the bulbs produced by the factory will have a lifespan less than 700 hours?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of bulbs with a lifespan less than 700 hours, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the value and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the corresponding probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to standardize (700 hours), μ is the mean (800 hours), and σ is the standard deviation (50 hours).\n\nz = (700 - 800) / 50\nz = -100 / 50\nz = -2\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can look up the corresponding probability in the standard normal distribution table. A z-score of -2 corresponds to a probability of approximately 0.0228, or 2.28%.\n\nTherefore, about 2.28% of the bulbs produced by the factory will have a lifespan less than 700 hours."
