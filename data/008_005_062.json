    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the second equation by 3 and subtract it from the third equation:\n\n(6x - 5y + 2z) - 3(2x - y + 3z) = 1 - 3(4)\n\n6x - 5y + 2z - 6x + 3y - 9z = 1 - 12\n\nNow, simplify the equation:\n\n-2y - 7z = -11\n\nNext, let's eliminate x from the first and second equations. To do this, we can multiply the second equation by 2 and subtract it from the first equation:\n\n(4x + 3y - 2z) - 2(2x - y + 3z) = 11 - 2(4)\n\n4x + 3y - 2z - 4x + 2y - 6z = 11 - 8\n\nNow, simplify the equation:\n\n5y - 8z = 3\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n-2y - 7z = -11\n5y - 8z = 3\n\nTo eliminate y, we can multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 2:\n\n-10y - 35z = -55\n10y - 16z = 6\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n-51z = -49\n\nNow, divide by -51:\n\nz = 49/51\n\nNow, substitute the value of z back into the equation 5y - 8z = 3:\n\n5y - 8(49/51) = 3\n\n5y - 392/51 = 3\n\nNow, add 392/51 to both sides:\n\n5y = 3 + 392/51\n\n5y = (3*51 + 392)/51\n\n5y = 539/51\n\nNow, divide by 5:\n\ny = 539/255\n\nNow, substitute the values of y and z back into the equation 2x - y + 3z = 4:\n\n2x - 539/255 + 3(49/51) = 4\n\n2x = 4 + 539/255 - 147/51\n\n2x = (4*255 + 539 - 3*147)/255\n\n2x = 389/255\n\nNow, divide by 2:\n\nx = 389/510\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 389/510\ny = 539/255\nz = 49/51"
