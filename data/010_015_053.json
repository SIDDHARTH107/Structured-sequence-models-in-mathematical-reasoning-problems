The De Rham theorem states that the De Rham cohomology groups of a smooth manifold are isomorphic to the singular cohomology groups with real coefficients.\n\nFor the sphere $S^2$, we have the following singular cohomology groups:\n\n- $H^0(S^2) = \\mathbb{R}$, since there is only one connected component.\n- $H^1(S^2) = 0$, since $S^2$ is simply connected (i.e., it has no non-trivial loops).\n- $H^2(S^2) = \\mathbb{R}$, since $S^2$ is a compact orientable 2-manifold.\n\nTherefore, the De Rham cohomology groups of the sphere $S^2$ using the standard round metric are:\n\n- $H_{dR}^0(S^2) = \\mathbb{R}$\n- $H_{dR}^1(S^2) = 0$\n- $H_{dR}^2(S^2) = \\mathbb{R}$\n\nAnd all other De Rham cohomology groups are zero."
