    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G has any cut vertices or bridges, we need to analyze its structure. Since we don't have a specific graph provided, let's consider a general case.\n\nA graph G with 7 vertices and 9 edges can be connected or disconnected. If the graph is disconnected, it will have at least one cut vertex, which is a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nLet's analyze the connected case first:\n\nA connected graph with 7 vertices and minimum number of edges (6 edges) would be a tree, and all its internal vertices would be cut vertices, and all its edges would be bridges. However, our graph has 9 edges, which means it has cycles.\n\nTo have a cut vertex in a connected graph, there must be a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph. In a graph with cycles, a cut vertex must be part of at least two different cycles. Similarly, a bridge must be an edge that is not part of any cycle.\n\nWithout the specific structure of the graph, we cannot identify and label the cut vertices or bridges. However, we can conclude that:\n\n1. If the graph is disconnected, it has at least one cut vertex.\n2. If the graph is connected and has cycles, it may or may not have cut vertices and bridges, depending on its structure.\n\nTo identify and label the cut vertices and bridges, we would need more information about the specific graph G."
