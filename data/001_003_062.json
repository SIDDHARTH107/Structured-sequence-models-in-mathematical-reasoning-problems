    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we need to make the coefficients of either x or y the same in both equations. In this case, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x the same:\n\n(2)(2x + 3y) = (2)(13)\n4x + 6y = 26\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n\n4x + 6y = 26\n4x - 5y = -2\n\nNext, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x - 5y) = 26 - (-2)\n4x + 6y - 4x + 5y = 28\n11y = 28\n\nNow, divide by 11 to solve for y:\n\ny = 28 / 11\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for x. We'll use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 13\n2x + 3(28/11) = 13\n\nMultiply both sides by 11 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n11(2x) + 11(3)(28/11) = 13(11)\n22x + 84 = 143\n\nNow, subtract 84 from both sides:\n\n22x = 59\n\nFinally, divide by 22 to solve for x:\n\nx = 59 / 22\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 59/22\ny = 28/11"
