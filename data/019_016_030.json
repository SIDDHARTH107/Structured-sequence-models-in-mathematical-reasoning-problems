    "message_2": "The union of sets A and B includes all the elements from both sets, without repetition. Since sets A and B have no common elements, the cardinality of the union of sets A and B is the sum of the cardinalities of sets A and B.\n\nSet A has 5 elements: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nSet B has 5 elements: {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the union of sets A and B is 5 + 5 = 10."
