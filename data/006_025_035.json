    "message_2": "To find the probability of both tricks succeeding, we need to multiply the probabilities of each trick succeeding individually. \n\nProbability of both tricks succeeding = (Probability of first trick succeeding) × (Probability of second trick succeeding)\n\n= (3/4) × (5/6)\n\n= 15/24\n\n= 5/8\n\nSo, the probability of both tricks succeeding is 5/8."
