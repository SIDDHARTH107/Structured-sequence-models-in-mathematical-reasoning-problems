    "message_2": "The Koch island is a fractal formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The Koch curve is generated by replacing each straight line segment with a smaller segment that is 1/3 of the original length, followed by two segments that form an equilateral triangle with the removed middle segment, and finally another smaller segment that is 1/3 of the original length.\n\nAfter each iteration, the number of segments in the Koch curve increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment decreases by a factor of 3. Therefore, after n iterations, the total length of the outline of the Koch island is given by:\n\nTotal length = (initial length) * (4/3)^n\n\nSince the initial length of the Koch island is 3 cm (3 sides of 1 cm each), after 5 iterations, the total length of the outline is:\n\nTotal length = 3 * (4/3)^5 = 3 * (1024/243) â‰ˆ 12.7 cm"
