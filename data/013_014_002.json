    "message_1": "Consider an auction where three bidders are each interested in acquiring a painting. Each bidder has a private valuation for the painting. Bidder 1 values the painting at $3,000, bidder 2 at $2,500 and bidder 3 at $2,000, respectively. The auctioneer is able to sell the painting to the highest bidder. \n\nAssume that the auctioneer decides to use a second-price sealed-bid auction (also known as a Vickrey auction), in which bidders submit sealed bids. What is the optimal strategy for each bidder and what is the final price of the painting?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction (Vickrey auction), the optimal strategy for each bidder is to bid their true valuation of the item. This is because the winner pays the second-highest bid, not their own bid. By bidding their true valuation, each bidder ensures that they will not overpay for the item, and they have the best chance of winning if their valuation is the highest.\n\nIn this case, the optimal strategy for each bidder is as follows:\n\n1. Bidder 1 should bid $3,000.\n2. Bidder 2 should bid $2,500.\n3. Bidder 3 should bid $2,000.\n\nSince Bidder 1 has the highest bid at $3,000, they will win the auction. However, they will pay the second-highest bid, which is $2,500 from Bidder 2. So, the final price of the painting is $2,500."
