    "message_2": "Let's denote the field with 17 elements as $\\mathbb{F}_{17}$. We want to count the number of solutions $(x, y, z, t) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{17}^4$ such that $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + t^3 = 0$.\n\nWe can use the following approach:\n\n1. Fix $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{F}_{17}$.\n2. Compute $-(x^3 + y^3 + z^3)$.\n3. Check if there exists a $t \\in \\mathbb{F}_{17}$ such that $t^3 = -(x^3 + y^3 + z^3)$.\n\nFor each choice of $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{F}_{17}$, there is exactly one choice of $t$ that satisfies the equation, since the map $t \\mapsto t^3$ is a bijection in $\\mathbb{F}_{17}$ (this is because 17 is a prime and 3 is a divisor of 16, which is the order of the multiplicative group of nonzero elements in $\\mathbb{F}_{17}$).\n\nSo, we just need to count the number of possible choices for $x, y, z$. Since each of them can take 17 different values, there are $17^3 = 4913$ possible choices for $(x, y, z)$. However, we need to subtract the cases when $x = y = z = t = 0$, which is just one case. Therefore, the number of points in the Fano variety over $\\mathbb{F}_{17}$ is $4913 - 1 = 4912$."
