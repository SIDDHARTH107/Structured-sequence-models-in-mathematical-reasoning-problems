    "message_1": "Consider the trefoil knot, which is a knot in three-dimensional space that looks like it has three leaves. If we represent the knot as a circle embedded in three-dimensional space, what is the minimum number of times that we need to cross the circle with a line so that the two parts of the knot can be separated without breaking or cutting the circle?",
    "message_2": "To separate the trefoil knot without breaking or cutting the circle, we need to consider its crossings. A trefoil knot has three crossings, where one part of the knot passes over or under another part. \n\nTo separate the knot, we need to cut through each of these crossings. Therefore, the minimum number of times we need to cross the circle with a line to separate the two parts of the knot is 3."
