    "message_2": "To find the minimum vertex cover, we need to select the smallest number of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one of the chosen vertices.\n\nIn the given graph, we can choose the following vertices: A, D, and F. By choosing these three vertices, all the edges are covered:\n\n- Vertex A covers edges AB, AC, and AD.\n- Vertex D covers edges DE and DF.\n- Vertex F covers edges EF and FG.\n\nTherefore, the minimum size of a vertex cover for this graph is 3."
