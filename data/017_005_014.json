    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Recall that the Sylow theorems state the following:\n\n1. For any prime p and any positive integer n, if p^n divides the order of a group G, then G has a subgroup of order p^n, called a Sylow p-subgroup.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G, denoted by n_p, divides the index [G : P], where P is a Sylow p-subgroup, and n_p ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the first Sylow theorem, G has a Sylow 3-subgroup P of order 3^3 = 27. Let n_3 denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By the third Sylow theorem, n_3 divides the index [G : P] = 27/27 = 1, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 = 1, which means that G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P.\n\nSince P is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G, it must be a normal subgroup of G (as any conjugate of P would also be a Sylow 3-subgroup, but P is unique). Therefore, G has a normal subgroup of order 27.\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIf G is cyclic, then it is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 27, Z_27. In this case, we are done.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\nSince G is not cyclic, it cannot be isomorphic to Z_27. Let P_1 be a subgroup of P of order 3 (which exists by the first Sylow theorem). Since P is normal in G, the product of subgroups P_1 and P is well-defined, and we have P_1P = P. Moreover, since the intersection of P_1 and P is trivial (i.e., contains only the identity element), we have |P_1P| = |P_1||P|/|P_1 ∩ P| = 3 * 9 / 1 = 27. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_1 and P, which are cyclic groups of order 3 and 9, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 27, it is either cyclic (isomorphic to Z_27) or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
