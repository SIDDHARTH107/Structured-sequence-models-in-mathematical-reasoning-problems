Using complex analysis techniques, find the solution $u(x,t)$. What is the temperature at the point $(x,t) = (\\frac{\\pi}{4}, 1)$?",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written in the form $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x) \\frac{dT}{dt} = k T(t) \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $kXT$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{kT} \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{1}{X} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}$$\n\nSince the left-hand side is a function of $t$ only and the right-hand side is a function of $x$ only, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{kT} \\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda^2 = \\frac{1}{X} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k\\lambda^2 T$\n\n2) $\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -\\lambda^2 X$\n\nThe second equation is an eigenvalue problem with homogeneous boundary conditions $X(0) = X(\\pi) = 0$. The eigenfunctions are given by $X_n(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x)$ with eigenvalues $\\lambda_n = n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. \n\nThe first equation can be solved by integrating:\n\n$$\\frac{dT}{dT} = -k\\lambda^2 T \\Rightarrow T_n(t) = e^{-k\\lambda_n^2 t}$$\n\nThus, the general solution is given by:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin(n\\pi x) e^{-k n^2 \\pi^2 t}$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $B_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$:\n\n$$\\sin(\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin(n\\pi x)$$\n\nComparing both sides, we can see that $B_1 = 1$ and $B_n = 0$ for $n > 1$. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sin(\\pi x) e^{-k \\pi^2 t}$$\n\nNow, we can find the temperature at the point $(x,t) = (\\frac{\\pi}{4}, 1)$:\n\n$$u\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}, 1\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\right) e^{-k \\pi^2}$$"
