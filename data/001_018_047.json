    "message_2": "To simplify the given logarithmic expression, we can use the logarithmic property: log_a(x) - log_a(y) = log_a(x/y).\n\nSo, log base 5 of (125x^4/5) - log base 5 of (25x^2/5) can be written as:\n\nlog base 5 of ((125x^4/5) / (25x^2/5))\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression inside the logarithm:\n\n(125x^4/5) / (25x^2/5) = (125x^4) / (25x^2)\n\nDivide both the numerator and the denominator by 25x^2:\n\n(125x^4) / (25x^2) = (5x^2)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the logarithmic expression as:\n\nlog base 5 of (5x^2)\n\nUsing the logarithmic property log_a(a^x) = x, we can simplify the expression further:\n\nlog base 5 of (5x^2) = 2x\n\nSo, the simplified logarithmic expression is:\n\n2x"
