    "message_1": "Suppose the weights of apples in a farm have a mean of 150 grams and a standard deviation of 20 grams. If a person randomly selects 25 apples, what is the probability that the mean weight of those apples is between 140 and 160 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, we are given the population mean (μ) as 150 grams and the population standard deviation (σ) as 20 grams. We are also given the sample size (n) as 25 apples.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean), which is given by the formula:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nσ_sample_mean = 20 / √25 = 20 / 5 = 4 grams\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range of mean weights (140 and 160 grams). The z-score is calculated using the formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\n\nFor the lower limit (140 grams):\n\nz1 = (140 - 150) / 4 = -10 / 4 = -2.5\n\nFor the upper limit (160 grams):\n\nz2 = (160 - 150) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the mean weight of the 25 apples is between these z-scores. We can use a standard normal distribution table (z-table) to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nP(z1) = P(-2.5) ≈ 0.0062\nP(z2) = P(2.5) ≈ 0.9938\n\nTo find the probability that the mean weight is between 140 and 160 grams, we need to find the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(140 < mean weight < 160) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.9938 - 0.0062 = 0.9876\n\nSo, the probability that the mean weight of the 25 randomly selected apples is between 140 and 160 grams is approximately 0.9876 or 98.76%."
