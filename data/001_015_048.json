    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to rewrite the equation in a way that allows us to isolate x. \n\nGiven the equation: 3^(2x + 1) = 27\n\nFirst, we can rewrite 27 as a power of 3, since 27 = 3^3.\n\nSo, the equation becomes: 3^(2x + 1) = 3^3\n\nSince the bases are equal (both are 3), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n2x + 1 = 3\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2x = 3 - 1\n2x = 2\nx = 2/2\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution is x = 1."
