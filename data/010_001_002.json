    "message_2": "To prove that A∪B is a closed subset of X, we will show that its complement, (A∪B)^c, is an open subset of X.\n\nRecall that a set is closed if its complement is open. Also, recall that the intersection of open sets is open.\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A∪B:\n\n(A∪B)^c = A^c ∩ B^c\n\nSince A and B are closed subsets of X, their complements A^c and B^c are open subsets of X. The intersection of A^c and B^c is also an open subset of X, as the intersection of open sets is open.\n\nTherefore, (A∪B)^c is an open subset of X, which implies that A∪B is a closed subset of X."
