The company estimates that for every $1,000 invested in Department A, their productivity will increase by 8 units, and for every $1,000 invested in Department B, their productivity will increase by 10 units. However, the company has to allocate at least $20,000 to each department. What is the optimal allocation of the budget to maximize the company's total productivity?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the company's total productivity, we should allocate more funds to the department with the higher productivity per $1,000 invested, which is Department B in this case.\n\nSince the company has to allocate at least $20,000 to each department, we will start by allocating the minimum required amount to both departments:\n\nDepartment A: $20,000\nDepartment B: $20,000\n\nThe remaining budget is $50,000 - $20,000 - $20,000 = $10,000.\n\nNow, we will allocate the remaining $10,000 to Department B, as it has a higher productivity increase per $1,000 invested:\n\nDepartment A: $20,000\nDepartment B: $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000\n\nSo, the optimal allocation of the budget to maximize the company's total productivity is:\n\nDepartment A: $20,000\nDepartment B: $30,000"
