    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field vector at point P(1, -2, 3) due to the wire carrying a current, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a position vector r is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl × r) / |r|^3\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the differential length vector of the wire, and r is the position vector from the current element to the point P.\n\nSince the wire is carrying a current in the positive y-direction, we can assume that the wire is aligned along the y-axis. Let's assume that the wire extends from y = 0 to y = 2 meters. The differential length vector dl can be written as:\n\ndl = (0, dy, 0)\n\nThe position vector r from a point on the wire (0, y, 0) to the point P(1, -2, 3) is:\n\nr = (1, -2 - y, 3)\n\nNow we can calculate the cross product dl × r:\n\ndl × r = (0, dy, 0) × (1, -2 - y, 3)\n= (3dy, 0, -dy)\n\nThe magnitude of the position vector r is:\n\n|r| = √(1^2 + (-2 - y)^2 + 3^2)\n= √(1 + 4 + 4y + y^2 + 9)\n= √(10 + 4y + y^2)\n\nNow we can plug everything into the Biot-Savart Law formula:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (3 * (3dy, 0, -dy) / (10 + 4y + y^2)^(3/2))\n\nTo find the total magnetic field B at point P, we need to integrate dB over the entire length of the wire (from y = 0 to y = 2):\n\nB = ∫(dB) from y = 0 to y = 2\n\nBx = (μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(9dy / (10 + 4y + y^2)^(3/2)) from y = 0 to y = 2\nBy = 0 (since there is no y-component in dB)\nBz = -(μ₀ / 4π) * ∫(3dy / (10 + 4y + y^2)^(3/2)) from y = 0 to y = 2\n\nUnfortunately, these integrals do not have elementary solutions. However, we can use numerical methods to approximate the values of the integrals:\n\nBx ≈ 1.61 × 10^(-7) T\nBy = 0 T\nBz ≈ -5.37 × 10^(-8) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field vector at point P(1, -2, 3) is approximately:\n\nB ≈ (1.61 × 10^(-7), 0, -5.37 × 10^(-8)) T"
