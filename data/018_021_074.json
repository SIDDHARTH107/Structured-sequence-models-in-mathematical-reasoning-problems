This means that we take the elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find (A ∆ B) ∩ B, which is the intersection of A ∆ B and B. This means that we take the elements that are in both A ∆ B and B.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {5}\n\nNow, let's find A ∩ B, which is the intersection of A and B. This means that we take the elements that are in both A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNext, let's find B \\ A, which is the set difference of B and A. This means that we take the elements that are in B but not in A.\n\nB \\ A = {5}\n\nNow, let's find (A ∩ B) ∆ (B \\ A), which is the symmetric difference of A ∩ B and B \\ A. This means that we take the elements that are in either A ∩ B or B \\ A, but not in both.\n\n(A ∩ B) ∆ (B \\ A) = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSince (A ∆ B) ∩ B = {5} and (A ∩ B) ∆ (B \\ A) = {5}, we can conclude that (A ∆ B) ∩ B = (A ∩ B) ∆ (B \\ A)."
