    "message_2": "The intersection point of the real and imaginary axes in the complex plane corresponding to the Mandelbrot set is the origin (0,0). The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. The origin (0,0) is the point where the real axis and the imaginary axis intersect, and it is also a part of the Mandelbrot set."
