    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(g(x)), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a composite function h(x) = f(g(x)), then the derivative h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x) and g(x):\n\nf(x) = (4x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 2)^2\nf'(x) = 2(4x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 2)(12x^2 - 10x + 3) (by applying the chain rule to the power of 2 and the inner function)\n\ng(x) = 2x + 1\ng'(x) = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of f(g(x)):\n\nf'(g(x)) = 2(4(2x + 1)^3 - 5(2x + 1)^2 + 3(2x + 1) - 2)(12(2x + 1)^2 - 10(2x + 1) + 3)\n\nNow, we will find the value of the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(g(2)) = 2(4(2(2) + 1)^3 - 5(2(2) + 1)^2 + 3(2(2) + 1) - 2)(12(2(2) + 1)^2 - 10(2(2) + 1) + 3)\n\nf'(g(2)) = 2(4(5)^3 - 5(5)^2 + 3(5) - 2)(12(5)^2 - 10(5) + 3)\n\nf'(g(2)) = 2(500 - 125 + 15 - 2)(300 - 50 + 3)\n\nf'(g(2)) = 2(388)(253)\n\nf'(g(2)) = 196504\n\nSo, the derivative of f(g(x)) at x = 2 is 196504."
