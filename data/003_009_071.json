    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides of lengths 5 cm and 7 cm, with an included angle of 60 degrees. What is the length of the third side using the cosine rule, and what is the perimeter of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "We can use the cosine rule to find the length of the third side. The cosine rule states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and the angle C between sides a and b:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, a = 5 cm, b = 7 cm, and C = 60 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\nC = 60 * (π / 180) = π / 3 radians\n\nNow, we can apply the cosine rule:\n\nc² = 5² + 7² - 2 * 5 * 7 * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 25 + 49 - 70 * (1/2)\nc² = 74 - 35\nc² = 39\n\nNow, we find the length of the third side by taking the square root:\n\nc = √39 ≈ 6.24 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of the third side, we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c = 5 + 7 + 6.24 ≈ 18.24 cm\n\nSo, the length of the third side is approximately 6.24 cm, and the perimeter of the triangle is approximately 18.24 cm."
