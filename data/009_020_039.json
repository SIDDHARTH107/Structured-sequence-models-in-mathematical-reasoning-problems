The angle made by the rod with the vertical direction is denoted by $\\theta(t)$, and the torque applied to the pendulum is denoted by $u(t)$. The motion of the pendulum is described by the following second-order differential equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} = -\\frac{g}{l}\\sin\\theta + \\frac{1}{ml^2} u(t), $$\n\nwhere $g=9.8$ m/s$^2$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $l$ is the length of the rod, and $m$ is the mass of the pendulum. The goal of optimal control is to find the torque $u(t)$ that minimizes the cost function\n\n$$ J = \\int_0^T \\left( \\theta(t)^2 + u(t)^2 \\right) dt, $$\n\nwhere $T$ is the total time duration of the problem.\n\nFind the torque function $u(t)$ that minimizes the cost function $J$ subject to the initial conditions $\\theta(0) = 0$ and $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}(0) = 0$. Use $T=10$ s and $m=1$ kg.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimal control problem, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, we need to define the Hamiltonian function $H$ as follows:\n\n$$ H(\\theta, p_\\theta, u) = \\theta^2 + u^2 + p_\\theta \\left(-\\frac{g}{l}\\sin\\theta + \\frac{1}{ml^2} u\\right), $$\n\nwhere $p_\\theta$ is the costate variable associated with the state variable $\\theta$. According to Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the optimal control $u^*(t)$ minimizes the Hamiltonian function:\n\n$$ u^*(t) = \\arg\\min_u H(\\theta, p_\\theta, u). $$\n\nTo find the minimum of the Hamiltonian with respect to $u$, we take the derivative of $H$ with respect to $u$ and set it to zero:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial u} = 2u + \\frac{1}{ml^2} p_\\theta = 0. $$\n\nSolving for $u$, we get the optimal control:\n\n$$ u^*(t) = -\\frac{1}{2} ml^2 p_\\theta(t). $$\n\nNow, we need to find the costate equation by taking the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to $\\theta$:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\theta} = 2\\theta - \\frac{g}{l} p_\\theta \\cos\\theta. $$\n\nAccording to Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the costate equation is given by:\n\n$$ -\\frac{dp_\\theta}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\theta}. $$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\theta}$, we get:\n\n$$ -\\frac{dp_\\theta}{dt} = 2\\theta - \\frac{g}{l} p_\\theta \\cos\\theta. $$\n\nWe also have the state equation from the given second-order differential equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} = -\\frac{g}{l}\\sin\\theta + \\frac{1}{ml^2} u^*(t). $$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $u^*(t)$, we get:\n\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} = -\\frac{g}{l}\\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} p_\\theta. $$\n\nNow, we have a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = v, $$\n\n$$ \\frac{dv}{dt} = -\\frac{g}{l}\\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} p_\\theta, $$\n\n$$ -\\frac{dp_\\theta}{dt} = 2\\theta - \\frac{g}{l} p_\\theta \\cos\\theta, $$\n\nwith the initial conditions $\\theta(0) = 0$, $v(0) = 0$, and $p_\\theta(T) = 0$.\n\nTo find the optimal control $u^*(t)$, we need to solve this system of differential equations numerically using a suitable method, such as the Runge-Kutta method or the shooting method. Once we have the numerical solution for $\\theta(t)$ and $p_\\theta(t)$, we can find the optimal control $u^*(t)$ using the expression:\n\n$$ u^*(t) = -\\frac{1}{2} ml^2 p_\\theta(t). $$"
