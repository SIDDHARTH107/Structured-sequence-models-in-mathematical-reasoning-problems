    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1, 2}\nB - A = {6, 7}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2} ∪ {6, 7} = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we need to show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to the intersection of A and B. Commutativity means that the order of the operation does not matter, i.e., A ∆ B = B ∆ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A.\n\nWe already know that A ∆ B = {1, 2, 6, 7} and A ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}. Let's find B ∆ A and B ∩ A.\n\nB ∆ A = (B - A) ∪ (A - B)\n\nB - A = {6, 7}\nA - B = {1, 2}\n\nB ∆ A = {6, 7} ∪ {1, 2} = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nB ∩ A = {3, 4, 5}\n\nAs we can see, A ∆ B = B ∆ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A, which means that the symmetric difference and intersection operations are commutative. However, the question asks to show that they are not commutative with respect to each other, which means we need to check if (A ∆ B) ∩ A = A ∩ (B ∆ A).\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ A = {1, 2, 6, 7} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} = {1, 2}\nA ∩ (B ∆ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 6, 7} = {1, 2}\n\nSince (A ∆ B) ∩ A = A ∩ (B ∆ A), the symmetric difference and intersection operations are commutative with respect to each other."
