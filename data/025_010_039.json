Using the Riemann-Roch theorem, calculate the dimension of the space of global sections of the divisor D = 2P + 4Q, where P and Q are distinct closed points on X.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the space of global sections of the divisor D = 2P + 4Q, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor D on a curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nl(D) - l(K_X - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the space of global sections of D, deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D, and K_X is the canonical divisor.\n\nIn our case, we have D = 2P + 4Q, so deg(D) = 2 + 4 = 6. We are given that K_X has degree 6, and the genus g = 3. We want to find l(D).\n\nFirst, we need to compute l(K_X - D). Since K_X has degree 6, we have K_X - D = 6 - (2P + 4Q) = 6 - 2P - 4Q. Now we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nl(D) - l(K_X - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g\nl(D) - l(6 - 2P - 4Q) = 6 + 1 - 3\nl(D) - l(6 - 2P - 4Q) = 4\n\nTo find l(6 - 2P - 4Q), we can use the fact that l(D) is non-negative and increasing with the degree of D. Since 6 - 2P - 4Q has degree 0, we have:\n\nl(6 - 2P - 4Q) = 0 or 1\n\nIf l(6 - 2P - 4Q) = 1, then there exists a non-constant rational function f on X with divisor (f) = 6 - 2P - 4Q. This would imply that 2P + 4Q is the divisor of a non-constant rational function, which is not possible since 2P + 4Q has positive degree. Therefore, we must have l(6 - 2P - 4Q) = 0.\n\nNow we can solve for l(D):\n\nl(D) - 0 = 4\nl(D) = 4\n\nSo the dimension of the space of global sections of the divisor D = 2P + 4Q is 4."
