    "message_2": "First, let's create the 5x5 Playfair cipher matrix using the keyword \"CRYPTO\". Since the keyword has 6 unique letters, we will have 20 more letters to fill in the matrix (25 letters in total, excluding \"J\").\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the keyword: CRYPTO\n2. Fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet in order (excluding \"J\"): ABCDEFGHIKLMNQSUWVXZ\n3. Combine the keyword and the remaining letters: CRYPTOABDEFGHIKLMNQSUWVXZ\n4. Create the 5x5 matrix:\n\n   C  R  Y  P  T\n   O  A  B  D  E\n   F  G  H  I  K\n   L  M  N  Q  S\n   U  W  V  X  Z\n\nNow, let's encrypt the plaintext \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Playfair cipher:\n\n1. Break the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters): MA TH EM AT IC S\n2. If a digraph has the same letter twice, insert an \"X\" between them: MA TH EX MA TI CS\n3. Encrypt each digraph using the matrix:\n\n   MA -> OD\n   TH -> YP\n   EX -> QF\n   MA -> OD\n   TI -> KL\n   CS -> RY\n\n4. Combine the encrypted digraphs: ODYPQFODKLRY\n\nSo, the encrypted text using the Playfair cipher with the keyword \"CRYPTO\" is \"ODYPQFODKLRY\".\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of possible Playfair cipher keys using the keyword \"CRYPTO\". Since the keyword has 6 unique letters, there are 20 remaining letters to fill in the matrix. The first 6 positions are fixed, and the remaining 20 positions can be filled in any order. Therefore, the number of possible keys is the number of permutations of the remaining 20 letters, which is 20! (20 factorial).\n\nThe number of possible Playfair cipher keys using the keyword \"CRYPTO\" is 20! = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000."
