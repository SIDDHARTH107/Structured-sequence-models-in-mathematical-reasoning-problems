The costs are as follows: \n\n| Building | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Cost to connect to A | - | 8 | 1 | 2 | 11 | 7 | 10 | 4 |\n| Cost to connect to B | 8 | - | 6 | 7 | 5 | 4 | 6 | 8 |\n| Cost to connect to C | 1 | 6 | - | 3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 9 |\n| Cost to connect to D | 2 | 7 | 3 | - | 4 | 1 | 3 | 7 |\n| Cost to connect to E | 11 | 5 | 5 | 4 | - | 7 | 9 | 12 |\n| Cost to connect to F | 7 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 7 | - | 2 | 8 |\n| Cost to connect to G | 10 | 6 | 4 | 3 | 9 | 2 | - | 5 |\n| Cost to connect to H | 4 | 8 | 9 | 7 | 12 | 8 | 5 | - |\n\nWhat is the minimum cost to connect all 8 buildings using the minimum spanning tree algorithm?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost to connect all 8 buildings using the minimum spanning tree algorithm, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we list all the edges in ascending order of their weights:\n\n1. D-F (1)\n2. A-C (1)\n3. F-G (2)\n4. A-D (2)\n5. C-F (2)\n6. D-G (3)\n7. C-D (3)\n8. G-H (5)\n9. B-E (5)\n10. C-G (4)\n11. B-F (4)\n12. A-H (4)\n13. B-G (6)\n14. B-C (6)\n15. E-D (4)\n16. F-H (8)\n17. B-H (8)\n18. D-H (7)\n19. A-B (8)\n20. A-F (7)\n21. A-G (10)\n22. E-F (7)\n23. E-G (9)\n24. E-H (12)\n\nNow, we start adding the edges to the minimum spanning tree while making sure we don't create any cycles:\n\n1. Add D-F (1)\n2. Add A-C (1)\n3. Add F-G (2)\n4. Add A-D (2) - This would create a cycle with D-F and A-C, so we skip it.\n5. Add C-F (2) - This would create a cycle with A-C and D-F, so we skip it.\n6. Add D-G (3) - This would create a cycle with D-F and F-G, so we skip it.\n7. Add C-D (3) - This would create a cycle with A-C and D-F, so we skip it.\n8. Add G-H (5)\n9. Add B-E (5)\n10. Add C-G (4) - This would create a cycle with A-C, D-F, and F-G, so we skip it.\n11. Add B-F (4)\n12. Add A-H (4) - This would create a cycle with A-C and G-H, so we skip it.\n\nNow we have a minimum spanning tree with the edges: D-F, A-C, F-G, G-H, B-E, and B-F. The total cost is:\n\n1 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 18\n\nSo, the minimum cost to connect all 8 buildings using the minimum spanning tree algorithm is 18."
