    "message_1": "Consider a group of 4 farmers sharing a piece of grazing land that can support up to 20 cows. Each farmer is trying to maximize their profits by putting as many cows as possible on the land, but putting too many cows can lead to overgrazing and damaging the land. \n\nAssume that the payoff for each farmer is proportional to the number of cows they put on the land. For example, if each cow generates a payoff of $100 for a farmer, then putting 5 cows generates a payoff of $500.\n\nIf the cost of overgrazing is $25 per cow, how many cows should each farmer put on the land to maximize their profits?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of cows each farmer puts on the land as x. Since there are 4 farmers, the total number of cows on the land is 4x. The land can support up to 20 cows, so if 4x > 20, there will be overgrazing.\n\nThe payoff for each farmer is $100 per cow, so the total payoff for each farmer is 100x. If there is overgrazing, the cost per cow is $25, so the cost for each farmer is 25(x - 5), since the land can support up to 5 cows per farmer without overgrazing.\n\nTo maximize their profits, each farmer wants to maximize their payoff minus the cost of overgrazing. So, we want to maximize:\n\nProfit = 100x - 25(x - 5)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nProfit = 100x - 25x + 125\nProfit = 75x + 125\n\nNow we need to find the value of x that maximizes the profit without causing overgrazing. Since the land can support up to 20 cows, the maximum number of cows per farmer without overgrazing is 20/4 = 5 cows.\n\nIf each farmer puts 5 cows on the land, there will be no overgrazing, and the profit for each farmer will be:\n\nProfit = 75(5) + 125\nProfit = 375 + 125\nProfit = $500\n\nSo, each farmer should put 5 cows on the land to maximize their profits without causing overgrazing."
