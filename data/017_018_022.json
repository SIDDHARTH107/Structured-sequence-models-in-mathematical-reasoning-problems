    "message_2": "A group of order 32 can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32 in the following ways:\n\n1. Cyclic group C32: There is only one way for a group of order 32 to be isomorphic to the cyclic group C32, and that is if the group itself is a cyclic group of order 32. This can be proven by the fact that there is only one cyclic group of a given order, up to isomorphism. In this case, the group has a single generator, which has an order of 32.\n\n2. Dihedral group D16: A group of order 32 can be isomorphic to the dihedral group D16 if it has the structure of the dihedral group with 16 vertices. The dihedral group D16 has order 2n, where n = 16, and consists of the symmetries of a regular 16-gon, including rotations and reflections. The group has two generators, one for rotation (r) and one for reflection (s), with the relations r^n = s^2 = 1 and srs = r^(-1). There is only one dihedral group of a given order, up to isomorphism.\n\n3. Non-abelian groups of order 32: There are six non-abelian groups of order 32, which can be represented as the semidirect products of smaller groups. These groups can be denoted as QD16, SD16, GD16, QD32, SD32, and GD32. Each of these groups has a unique structure and is not isomorphic to any of the other non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nTo prove that these are the only distinct ways for a group of order 32 to be isomorphic to the given groups, we can use the Sylow theorems and the properties of p-groups. A group of order 32 is a p-group, where p = 2, and by the Sylow theorems, it has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup. The structure of this subgroup determines the isomorphism type of the group.\n\nSince there are no other groups of order 32 that have a different structure from the cyclic group, the dihedral group, and the six non-abelian groups, these are the only distinct ways for a group of order 32 to be isomorphic to the given groups."
