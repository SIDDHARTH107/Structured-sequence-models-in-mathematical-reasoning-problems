    "message_1": "In a community of 500 people, 60% of them own a dog. If a random sample of 50 people is taken from this community, what is the probability that at least 25 people in the sample own a dog?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k successes (in this case, people owning a dog) in n trials (the sample size)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the proportion of people owning a dog)\n- n is the number of trials (the sample size)\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 50 (the sample size)\n- p = 0.60 (the proportion of people owning a dog)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 25 people in the sample own a dog, which means we need to find the probability for k = 25, 26, ..., 50. To do this, we can calculate the probabilities for each k and then sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 25) = P(X = 25) + P(X = 26) + ... + P(X = 50)\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to calculate each of these probabilities and then sum them up. \n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the probabilities and sum them up, we get:\n\nP(X >= 25) â‰ˆ 0.9829\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25 people in the sample own a dog is approximately 0.9829 or 98.29%."
