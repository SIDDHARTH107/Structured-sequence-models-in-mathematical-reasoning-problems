In this case, n = 4.\n\nL = 2^(2 * 4 - 1)\nL = 2^(8 - 1)\nL = 2^7\nL = 128\n\nSo, the length of one line segment is 128 units.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of line segments in a Hilbert curve of order 4. The number of line segments in a Hilbert curve is given by the formula S = 4^n, where n is the order of the curve.\n\nS = 4^4\nS = 256\n\nThere are 256 line segments in a Hilbert curve of order 4.\n\nFinally, we need to multiply the length of one line segment (128 units) by the total number of line segments (256) to find the total length of the Hilbert curve of order 4.\n\nTotal length = 128 * 256\nTotal length = 32,768 units\n\nThe total length of the Hilbert curve of order 4 is 32,768 units."
