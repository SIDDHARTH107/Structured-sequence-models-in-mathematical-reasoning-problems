    "message_1": "A water distribution network connects a water source with four different towns. The maximum capacity of the pipelines connecting the source with the towns are as follows: 10 liters per hour for town A, 20 liters per hour for town B, 30 liters per hour for town C, and 20 liters per hour for town D. Determine the maximum amount of water that can flow from the source to the towns per hour.",
    "message_2": "To determine the maximum amount of water that can flow from the source to the towns per hour, we simply need to add the maximum capacities of each pipeline together.\n\n10 liters per hour (town A) + 20 liters per hour (town B) + 30 liters per hour (town C) + 20 liters per hour (town D) = 80 liters per hour\n\nSo, the maximum amount of water that can flow from the source to the towns per hour is 80 liters."
