    "message_2": "To solve the equation |x+3| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: x + 3 is positive or zero\nIn this case, we can simply remove the absolute value sign and solve for x:\nx + 3 = 7\nx = 7 - 3\nx = 4\n\nCase 2: x + 3 is negative\nIn this case, we need to negate the expression inside the absolute value sign and solve for x:\n-(x + 3) = 7\n-x - 3 = 7\n-x = 10\nx = -10\n\nSo, the two solutions for x are x = 4 and x = -10."
