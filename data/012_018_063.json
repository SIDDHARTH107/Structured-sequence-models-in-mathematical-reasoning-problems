    "message_2": "Let's first find the total number of edges in the graph. Using the Handshaking Lemma, we know that the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges in the graph. Since there are 8 vertices and each vertex has a degree of at least 5, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is at least 8 * 5 = 40. Therefore, there are at least 40 / 2 = 20 edges in the graph.\n\nNow, let's consider disconnecting the graph into two disjoint components. In the worst-case scenario, we would need to remove all the edges connected to a single vertex to disconnect the graph. Since each vertex has a degree of at least 5, we would need to remove at least 5 edges to disconnect the graph.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the possibility that removing 5 edges from a vertex might not be enough to disconnect the graph. In this case, we can look at the graph as a complete graph with 8 vertices (K8), which has 8 * (8 - 1) / 2 = 28 edges. To disconnect K8, we would need to remove at least 6 edges, as removing 5 edges from a vertex would still leave it connected to the other 2 vertices.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed in order to disconnect the graph into two disjoint components is 6."
