    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star operator of a 2-form α at a point p on a 3-dimensional manifold M, we first need to choose a local coordinate system and an inner product on the tangent space at p. Let's denote the local coordinates by (x, y, z) and assume we are working with the standard Euclidean inner product.\n\nLet α = α_x dy∧dz + α_y dz∧dx + α_z dx∧dy, where α_x, α_y, and α_z are smooth functions on M. We want to compute the Hodge star of α, denoted by *α.\n\nRecall that the Hodge star operator is defined by the following equation:\n\nα ∧ (*α) = ⟨α, α⟩ vol\n\nwhere ⟨., .⟩ is the inner product on the space of 2-forms and vol is the volume form on M. In our case, the volume form is given by vol = dx∧dy∧dz.\n\nNow, let's compute the inner product ⟨α, α⟩. Since α is a 2-form, the inner product is given by:\n\n⟨α, α⟩ = α_x^2 + α_y^2 + α_z^2\n\nNow we need to find a 1-form *α = β_x dx + β_y dy + β_z dz such that:\n\nα ∧ (*α) = (α_x dy∧dz + α_y dz∧dx + α_z dx∧dy) ∧ (β_x dx + β_y dy + β_z dz) = ⟨α, α⟩ vol\n\nExpanding the wedge product, we get:\n\nα_x β_y dz∧dy∧dx + α_x β_z dy∧dz∧dx + α_y β_x dx∧dz∧dy + α_y β_z dz∧dx∧dy + α_z β_x dy∧dx∧dz + α_z β_y dx∧dy∧dz\n\nNow, we can compare the coefficients of the basis elements dx∧dy∧dz, dy∧dz∧dx, and dz∧dx∧dy on both sides of the equation. We get the following system of equations:\n\nα_x β_y = α_y^2 + α_z^2\nα_y β_z = α_x^2 + α_z^2\nα_z β_x = α_x^2 + α_y^2\n\nWe can solve this system of equations for β_x, β_y, and β_z:\n\nβ_x = (α_y^2 + α_z^2) / α_x\nβ_y = (α_x^2 + α_z^2) / α_y\nβ_z = (α_x^2 + α_y^2) / α_z\n\nThus, the Hodge star of α at the point p on the manifold M is given by:\n\n*α = ((α_y^2 + α_z^2) / α_x) dx + ((α_x^2 + α_z^2) / α_y) dy + ((α_x^2 + α_y^2) / α_z) dz"
