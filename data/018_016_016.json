    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A x B and B x A.\n\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB x A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A} = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of (A x B) and (B x A).\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nThe union of two sets A and B is commutative if A ∪ B = B ∪ A. In this case, since we are dealing with Cartesian products, we need to check if (A x B) ∪ (B x A) = (B x A) ∪ (A x B).\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n(B x A) ∪ (A x B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A x B) ∪ (B x A) = (B x A) ∪ (A x B). Both sets contain the same elements, so the union is commutative in this case."
