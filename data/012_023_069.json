    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with the number of vertices equal to 6. If the maximum number of vertices that have edges between them is 4, what is the clique number of the graph G?",
    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (or clique) within the graph. In this case, the maximum number of vertices that have edges between them is 4. This means that the largest complete subgraph has 4 vertices, where each vertex is connected to every other vertex in the subgraph. Therefore, the clique number of the graph G is 4."
