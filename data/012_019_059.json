    "message_2": "To find the chromatic index of a graph G formed by joining two cycles, one of length 5 and the other of length 7, we need to determine the edge coloring of the graph.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the two cycles separately. A cycle of length 5 is C5, and a cycle of length 7 is C7. The chromatic index of a cycle is equal to its maximum degree if the cycle has an even number of vertices, and it is equal to the maximum degree plus 1 if the cycle has an odd number of vertices.\n\nFor C5, the maximum degree is 2, and since it has an odd number of vertices, its chromatic index is 2 + 1 = 3. For C7, the maximum degree is also 2, and since it has an odd number of vertices, its chromatic index is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the graph G formed by joining the two cycles. Since both cycles have a chromatic index of 3, we can color the edges of each cycle with three colors. When we join the two cycles, we add an edge between a vertex in C5 and a vertex in C7. This new edge can be colored with a color not used on the adjacent edges in each cycle.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic index of the graph G formed by joining the two cycles is 3."
