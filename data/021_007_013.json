    "message_1": "Consider the equation x^3 - 7x^2 + 14x - 6 = 0. Use Newton-Raphson method to find the root correct to three decimal places, if the initial guess is x = 2.5.",
    "message_2": "To apply the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the given function. The function is:\n\nf(x) = x^3 - 7x^2 + 14x - 6\n\nThe derivative of the function, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 14x + 14\n\nNow, we will use the Newton-Raphson formula to find the root:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nGiven the initial guess x0 = 2.5, we will now find x1:\n\nf(x0) = (2.5)^3 - 7(2.5)^2 + 14(2.5) - 6\nf(x0) = 15.625 - 43.75 + 35 - 6\nf(x0) = 0.875\n\nf'(x0) = 3(2.5)^2 - 14(2.5) + 14\nf'(x0) = 18.75 - 35 + 14\nf'(x0) = -2.25\n\nNow, we can find x1:\n\nx1 = 2.5 - (0.875 / -2.25)\nx1 ≈ 2.5 + 0.3889\nx1 ≈ 2.8889\n\nNow, we will repeat the process with x1 to find x2:\n\nf(x1) = (2.8889)^3 - 7(2.8889)^2 + 14(2.8889) - 6\nf(x1) ≈ 0.0231\n\nf'(x1) = 3(2.8889)^2 - 14(2.8889) + 14\nf'(x1) ≈ 0.7766\n\nNow, we can find x2:\n\nx2 = 2.8889 - (0.0231 / 0.7766)\nx2 ≈ 2.8889 - 0.0297\nx2 ≈ 2.8592\n\nWe can continue this process until the difference between successive approximations is less than the desired accuracy (0.001 in this case). However, since we already have three decimal places and the difference between x1 and x2 is less than 0.001, we can stop here.\n\nThus, the root of the equation x^3 - 7x^2 + 14x - 6 = 0, correct to three decimal places, is approximately x ≈ 2.859."
