    "message_2": "First, let's clarify the notation used. The symbol \"△\" represents the symmetric difference between two sets, which is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in both. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between sets A and B:\n\nA △ B = {x: x ∈ A or x ∈ B, but not both}\nA △ B = {1, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between (A △ B) and C:\n\n(A △ B) △ C = {x: x ∈ (A △ B) or x ∈ C, but not both}\n(A △ B) △ C = {1, 2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between B and C:\n\nB △ C = {x: x ∈ B or x ∈ C, but not both}\nB △ C = {3}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between A and (B △ C):\n\nA △ (B △ C) = {x: x ∈ A or x ∈ (B △ C), but not both}\nA △ (B △ C) = {1, 2}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of the sets (A △ B) △ C and A △ (B △ C):\n\n((A △ B) △ C) × (A △ (B △ C)) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the Cartesian product of the sets (A △ B) △ C and A △ (B △ C) is not equal, which proves that (A △ B) △ C is not equal to A △ (B △ C)."
