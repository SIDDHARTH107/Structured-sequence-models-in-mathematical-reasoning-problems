    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of sets A and B, and then find the complement of the result. Next, find the symmetric difference of the complements of sets A and B. Show that these two results are not equal, hence proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the result. The complement of a set is the set of all elements that are not in the set. Assuming the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B, we have:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nSo, the complement of the symmetric difference is:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {2, 3}\n\nNext, let's find the complements of sets A and B:\n\nA' = U - A = {4}\nB' = U - B = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the complements of sets A and B:\n\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 4}\n\nComparing the two results, we have:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = {2, 3}\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 4}\n\nThese two results are not equal, which proves that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement."
