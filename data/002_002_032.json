    "message_2": "To find the volume of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nGiven the diameter of the sphere is 10 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 5 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) × π × (5 cm)³\nV = (4/3) × 3.14159 × (125 cm³)\nV = 1.33333 × 3.14159 × 125 cm³\nV ≈ 523.598 cm³\n\nThe volume of the sphere with a diameter of 10 cm is approximately 523.598 cubic centimeters."
