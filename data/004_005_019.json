    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order linear differential equation, we will use the integrating factor method. The given differential equation is:\n\ndy/dx + y = 3x\n\nFirst, we find the integrating factor (IF). The integrating factor is given by the formula:\n\nIF = e^(∫P(x)dx)\n\nIn our case, P(x) = 1. So,\n\nIF = e^(∫1dx) = e^x\n\nNow, we multiply the entire differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^x(dy/dx) + e^x*y = 3x*e^x\n\nThe left side of the equation is now the derivative of the product of y and the integrating factor:\n\nd/dx(y*e^x) = 3x*e^x\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫d(y*e^x) = ∫3x*e^x dx\n\nIntegrating the left side, we get:\n\ny*e^x = ∫3x*e^x dx\n\nTo integrate the right side, we will use integration by parts. Let u = 3x and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = 3 dx and v = e^x. Applying integration by parts:\n\n∫3x*e^x dx = 3x*e^x - ∫3*e^x dx\n\nNow, integrate the remaining term:\n\n3x*e^x - 3∫e^x dx = 3x*e^x - 3*e^x + C\n\nNow, we have:\n\ny*e^x = 3x*e^x - 3*e^x + C\n\nTo find y(x), we divide both sides by e^x:\n\ny(x) = 3x - 3 + C*e^(-x)\n\nNow, we use the initial condition y(0) = 2:\n\n2 = 3*0 - 3 + C*e^(0)\n2 = -3 + C\n\nSolving for C, we get:\n\nC = 5\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = 3x - 3 + 5*e^(-x)"
