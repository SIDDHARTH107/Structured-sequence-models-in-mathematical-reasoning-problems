    "message_1": "A manufacturer of cereal boxes claims that their boxes contain, on average, 500 grams of cereal. A consumer group claims that the boxes actually contain less than that. The manufacturer samples 36 boxes and the sample mean is 495 grams with a standard deviation of 10 grams. Can the consumer group's claim be supported at a 5% level of significance?",
    "message_2": "To test the consumer group's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true mean is equal to 500 grams, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true mean is less than 500 grams.\n\nGiven data:\nPopulation mean (μ) = 500 grams\nSample mean (x̄) = 495 grams\nSample size (n) = 36\nSample standard deviation (s) = 10 grams\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is greater than 30, we can use the z-test. First, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = s / √n\nSE = 10 / √36\nSE = 10 / 6\nSE = 1.67\n\nNext, we calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE\nz = (495 - 500) / 1.67\nz = -5 / 1.67\nz ≈ -2.99\n\nNow, we need to find the critical z-value for a one-tailed test at a 5% level of significance. Using a z-table or calculator, we find that the critical z-value is -1.645.\n\nSince the calculated z-score (-2.99) is less than the critical z-value (-1.645), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This means that there is enough evidence to support the consumer group's claim that the cereal boxes contain less than 500 grams of cereal at a 5% level of significance."
