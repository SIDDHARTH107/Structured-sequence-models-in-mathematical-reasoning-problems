    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2) in the direction of the tangent vector v = 2i + 3j - 6k, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the first and second partial derivatives of the surface.\n2. Compute the tangent plane to the surface at the given point.\n3. Project the tangent vector v onto the tangent plane.\n4. Compute the sectional curvature using the projected tangent vector.\n\nStep 1: Compute the first and second partial derivatives of the surface.\n\nThe surface is given by z = x^2 + y^2. We compute the first partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂²z/∂x² = 2\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\n∂²z/∂y² = 2\n\nStep 2: Compute the tangent plane to the surface at the given point.\n\nThe tangent plane to the surface at the point (1,1,2) is given by the gradient of the surface at that point:\n\n∇z = (2x, 2y, -1)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), the gradient is:\n\n∇z(1,1,2) = (2, 2, -1)\n\nThe tangent plane at (1,1,2) is given by the equation:\n\n2(x-1) + 2(y-1) - (z-2) = 0\n\nStep 3: Project the tangent vector v onto the tangent plane.\n\nThe tangent vector v is given by:\n\nv = 2i + 3j - 6k\n\nThe normal vector to the tangent plane is given by the gradient:\n\nn = (2, 2, -1)\n\nTo project v onto the tangent plane, we first find the component of v along the normal vector:\n\nv_n = (v · n) / ||n||² * n\n\nv_n = ((2*2) + (3*2) + (-6*-1)) / (2² + 2² + (-1)²) * (2, 2, -1)\nv_n = (4 + 6 + 6) / (4 + 4 + 1) * (2, 2, -1)\nv_n = 16/9 * (2, 2, -1)\nv_n = (32/9, 32/9, -16/9)\n\nNow, we subtract v_n from v to get the projection of v onto the tangent plane:\n\nv_t = v - v_n\nv_t = (2 - 32/9, 3 - 32/9, -6 + 16/9)\nv_t = (-14/9, 5/9, -38/9)\n\nStep 4: Compute the sectional curvature using the projected tangent vector.\n\nThe sectional curvature K is given by the formula:\n\nK = (II(v_t, v_t)) / (I(v_t, v_t))²\n\nwhere II and I are the second and first fundamental forms, respectively.\n\nThe first fundamental form I is given by the matrix:\n\nI = | 1 + (∂z/∂x)²   ∂z/∂x * ∂z/∂y |\n    | ∂z/∂x * ∂z/∂y   1 + (∂z/∂y)² |\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have:\n\nI = | 1 + (2*1)²   2*1 * 2*1 |\n    | 2*1 * 2*1   1 + (2*1)² |\n\nI = | 5   4 |\n    | 4   5 |\n\nThe second fundamental form II is given by the matrix:\n\nII = | ∂²z/∂x²   ∂²z/∂x∂y |\n     | ∂²z/∂x∂y   ∂²z/∂y² |\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have:\n\nII = | 2   0 |\n     | 0   2 |\n\nNow, we compute the numerator and denominator of the sectional curvature formula:\n\nNumerator: II(v_t, v_t) = v_t^T * II * v_t\nDenominator: I(v_t, v_t)² = (v_t^T * I * v_t)²\n\nFor the numerator:\n\nv_t^T * II = (-14/9, 5/9, -38/9) * | 2   0 |\n                                      | 0   2 |\n\nv_t^T * II = (-28/9, 10/9, -76/9)\n\nII(v_t, v_t) = (-28/9, 10/9, -76/9) * (-14/9, 5/9, -38/9)^T\nII(v_t, v_t) = (-28/9 * -14/9) + (10/9 * 5/9) + (-76/9 * -38/9)\nII(v_t, v_t) = 392/81 + 50/81 + 2888/81\nII(v_t, v_t) = 3330/81\n\nFor the denominator:\n\nv_t^T * I = (-14/9, 5/9, -38/9) * | 5   4 |\n                                    | 4   5 |\n\nv_t^T * I = (-70/9 + 20/9, -56/9 + 25/9, -152/9 + 190/9)\n\nv_t^T * I = (-50/9, -31/9, 38/9)\n\nI(v_t, v_t) = (-50/9, -31/9, 38/9) * (-14/9, 5/9, -38/9)^T\nI(v_t, v_t) = (-50/9 * -14/9) + (-31/9 * 5/9) + (38/9 * -38/9)\nI(v_t, v_t) = 700/81 + 155/81 + 1444/81\nI(v_t, v_t) = 2299/81\n\nNow, we square the denominator:\n\n(I(v_t, v_t))² = (2299/81)² = 5290201/6561\n\nFinally, we compute the sectional curvature:\n\nK = (II(v_t, v_t)) / (I(v_t, v_t))²\nK = (3330/81) / (5290201/6561)\nK = 3330 * 6561 / 5290201\nK ≈ 0.0412\n\nThe sectional curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2) in the direction of the tangent vector v = 2i + 3j - 6k is approximately 0.0412."
