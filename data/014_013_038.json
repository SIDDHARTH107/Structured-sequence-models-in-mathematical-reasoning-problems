    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using Hill Cipher with a 2x2 matrix key (K), we first need to know the key matrix. Since it is not provided, I will assume a random 2x2 key matrix for demonstration purposes. Let's use the following key matrix:\n\nK = | 3  2 |\n    | 5  1 |\n\nNow, we need to convert the message \"HELLO\" into numerical form using the given mapping:\n\nH = 7, E = 4, L = 11, L = 11, O = 14\n\nSince we have a 2x2 key matrix, we need to divide the message into pairs of letters. In this case, we have two pairs: HE and LL, and a single letter O left. We can add an extra letter to make it a pair, for example, adding 'X' (23):\n\nHE = | 7  4 |, LL = | 11  11 |, and OX = | 14  23 |\n\nNow, we will perform matrix multiplication for each pair with the key matrix (K):\n\nCiphertext(HE) = K * HE = | 3  2 | * |  7  4 | = | (3*7 + 2*4)  (3*4 + 2*7) | = | 29  22 |\n                          | 5  1 |   | 11 11 |   | (5*7 + 1*4)  (5*4 + 1*7) |   | 39  27 |\n\nCiphertext(LL) = K * LL = | 3  2 | * | 11  11 | = | (3*11 + 2*11)  (3*11 + 2*11) | = | 55  55 |\n                          | 5  1 |   | 14  23 |   | (5*11 + 1*11)  (5*11 + 1*11) |   | 66  66 |\n\nCiphertext(OX) = K * OX = | 3  2 | * | 14  23 | = | (3*14 + 2*23)  (3*23 + 2*14) | = | 98  105 |\n                          | 5  1 |   | 11  11 |   | (5*14 + 1*23)  (5*23 + 1*14) |   | 81  127 |\n\nSince we are working with modulo 26, we need to reduce the numbers in the ciphertext matrices:\n\nCiphertext(HE) = | 29 % 26  22 % 26 | = | 3  22 |\n                | 39 % 26  27 % 26 |   | 13  1  |\n\nCiphertext(LL) = | 55 % 26  55 % 26 | = | 3  3 |\n                | 66 % 26  66 % 26 |   | 14 14 |\n\nCiphertext(OX) = | 98 % 26  105 % 26 | = | 22  1 |\n                | 81 % 26  127 % 26 |   | 5  1  |\n\nNow, we convert the numbers back to letters:\n\nCiphertext(HE) = | 3  22 | = CD\n                | 13  1  |   NA\n\nCiphertext(LL) = | 3  3  | = CC\n                | 14 14  |   OO\n\nCiphertext(OX) = | 22  1  | = WB\n                | 5   1  |   FA\n\nFinally, we combine the letters to get the encrypted message:\n\nCiphertext = \"CDNACCOOWBFA\"\n\nSo, the encrypted message for \"HELLO\" using the given Hill Cipher key matrix is \"CDNACCOOWBFA\"."
