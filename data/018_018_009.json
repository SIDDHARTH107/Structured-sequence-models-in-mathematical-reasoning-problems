To find the symmetric difference, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the elements that are in A but not in B (A - B).\n2. Find the elements that are in B but not in A (B - A).\n3. Combine the results from steps 1 and 2.\n\nA - B = {3, 7, 9}\nB - A = {2, 4, 6}\n\nThe symmetric difference between A and B is {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}."
