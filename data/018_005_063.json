    "message_1": "Let A be a set of prime numbers less than 10 and B be the set of composite numbers less than 10. Find the intersection of A and B, and then show that the intersection of A and its complement is an empty set.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the sets A and B.\n\nA: Prime numbers less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, A = {2, 3, 5, 7}.\n\nB: Composite numbers less than 10 are 4, 6, 8, and 9. So, B = {4, 6, 8, 9}.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no common elements between A and B. Therefore, the intersection of A and B is an empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nNext, let's find the complement of A. The complement of a set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in A. In this case, the universal set is the set of all natural numbers less than 10, which is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. So, A' = {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and A'. The intersection of A and A' is the set of elements that are common to both A and A'. Since A and A' are complements, they have no common elements. Therefore, the intersection of A and A' is an empty set, denoted as ∅."
