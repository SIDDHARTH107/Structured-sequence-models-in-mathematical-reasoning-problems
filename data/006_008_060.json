    "message_1": "A weather forecast predicts that there is a 75% chance of rain on a certain day. If 30 people are asked whether they think it will rain or not on that day, what is the probability that less than 20 people say it will rain?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k successes (in this case, k people saying it will rain) in n trials (30 people being asked)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a person saying it will rain, which is 75% or 0.75)\n- n is the number of trials (30 people being asked)\n- k is the number of successes (the number of people saying it will rain)\n\nWe want to find the probability that less than 20 people say it will rain, which means we need to find the probability for k = 0 to k = 19 and sum those probabilities.\n\nP(X < 20) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19)\n\nWe can calculate each probability using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 20) = Σ [C(30, k) * (0.75)^k * (0.25)^(30-k)] for k = 0 to 19\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X < 20) ≈ 0.0294\n\nSo, the probability that less than 20 people say it will rain is approximately 2.94%."
