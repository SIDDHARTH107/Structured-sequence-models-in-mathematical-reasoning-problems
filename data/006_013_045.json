    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of a hurricane occurring in the upcoming season, we can use the historical data provided. In this case, a hurricane has occurred in 3 out of the last 10 seasons. \n\nTo calculate the probability, we can use the following formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the successful outcome is a hurricane occurring, and the total number of outcomes is the number of seasons observed (10).\n\nProbability = 3 / 10 = 0.3\n\nSo, the estimated probability of a hurricane occurring in the upcoming season is 0.3 or 30%. Keep in mind that this is a simplified estimation based on historical data and does not take into account any other factors that may influence the likelihood of a hurricane."
