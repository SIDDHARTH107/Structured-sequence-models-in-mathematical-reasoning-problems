    "message_2": "Let's first recall some facts about lens spaces and their homology groups. A lens space L(p, q) is a 3-dimensional manifold defined as the quotient space of S^3 by the action of a cyclic group of order p generated by a rotation of angle 2πq/p. The first homology group of a lens space L(p, q) is given by H_1(L(p, q); Z) ≅ Z/pZ.\n\nNow, let's consider the connected sum of two lens spaces, L(p_1, q_1) # L(p_2, q_2). Recall that the connected sum operation consists of removing a small 3-ball from each manifold and gluing the resulting boundaries together. The homology groups of the connected sum can be computed using Mayer-Vietoris sequence. In particular, we have the following short exact sequence:\n\n0 → H_1(L(p_1, q_1); Z) ⊕ H_1(L(p_2, q_2); Z) → H_1(L(p_1, q_1) # L(p_2, q_2); Z) → Z → 0\n\nSince H_1(L(p_1, q_1); Z) ≅ Z/p_1Z and H_1(L(p_2, q_2); Z) ≅ Z/p_2Z, the sequence becomes:\n\n0 → Z/p_1Z ⊕ Z/p_2Z → H_1(L(p_1, q_1) # L(p_2, q_2); Z) → Z → 0\n\nNow, we want to determine if there exists a connected sum of two lens spaces with first homology group isomorphic to Z/2Z. In other words, we want to find p_1 and p_2 such that H_1(L(p_1, q_1) # L(p_2, q_2); Z) ≅ Z/2Z.\n\nNotice that if p_1 and p_2 are both odd, then Z/p_1Z ⊕ Z/p_2Z will have no elements of order 2, and thus H_1(L(p_1, q_1) # L(p_2, q_2); Z) cannot be isomorphic to Z/2Z. Therefore, at least one of p_1 and p_2 must be even, say p_1 = 2k for some integer k.\n\nIn this case, we have the short exact sequence:\n\n0 → Z/2kZ ⊕ Z/p_2Z → H_1(L(2k, q_1) # L(p_2, q_2); Z) → Z → 0\n\nSince Z/2kZ has an element of order 2, there is a chance that H_1(L(2k, q_1) # L(p_2, q_2); Z) can be isomorphic to Z/2Z. However, we must also consider the map from Z/2kZ ⊕ Z/p_2Z to H_1(L(2k, q_1) # L(p_2, q_2); Z). If this map is injective, then H_1(L(2k, q_1) # L(p_2, q_2); Z) will contain a subgroup isomorphic to Z/2kZ, which is not possible if H_1(L(2k, q_1) # L(p_2, q_2); Z) is isomorphic to Z/2Z.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that a closed 3-dimensional manifold M with first homology group isomorphic to Z/2Z cannot be written as the connected sum of two lens spaces."
