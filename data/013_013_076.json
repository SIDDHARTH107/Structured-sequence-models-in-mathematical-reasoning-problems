    "message_1": "In a private value first-price sealed-bid auction, there are three bidders interested in a painting. The true valuations of the painting for each bidder are:\n\nBidder 1: $500\nBidder 2: $700\nBidder 3: $900\n\nWhat is the expected revenue for the seller if the auction follows a first-price sealed-bid auction format?",
    "message_2": "In a first-price sealed-bid auction, each bidder submits a bid without knowing the bids of the other participants, and the highest bidder wins the auction, paying the amount they bid. Bidders typically bid below their true valuation to avoid overpaying.\n\nTo calculate the expected revenue for the seller, we need to make some assumptions about the bidding strategies of the bidders. One common assumption is that bidders use a linear bidding strategy, where they bid a fraction of their true valuation. Let's assume that each bidder bids a fraction (k) of their true valuation, where 0 < k < 1.\n\nBidder 1: $500k\nBidder 2: $700k\nBidder 3: $900k\n\nSince Bidder 3 has the highest valuation, they will win the auction as long as their bid is above the bids of the other two bidders. Therefore, the expected revenue for the seller is the winning bid of Bidder 3, which is $900k.\n\nHowever, without more information about the bidding strategies or the specific value of k, we cannot determine the exact expected revenue for the seller."
