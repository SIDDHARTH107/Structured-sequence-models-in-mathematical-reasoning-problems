    "message_2": "The specific partial differential equation (PDE) that needs to be solved for this purpose is the same as the given heat equation, with the given diffusion coefficient $\\alpha = 0.05$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = 0.05 \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\right)\n$$\nwith the initial condition $u(x, y, 0) = I(x, y)$.\n\nFor the boundary conditions, we can assume that the temperature at the edges of the image domain does not change over time. This corresponds to a Neumann boundary condition with zero derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(0, y, t) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(256, y, t) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}(x, 0, t) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}(x, 256, t) = 0\n$$\n\nTo solve the initial value problem numerically using Euler's method, we first discretize the spatial and temporal domains. Let $u_{i,j}^k$ denote the approximate temperature at the grid point $(i, j)$ and time step $k$. We can approximate the spatial second derivatives using central finite differences and the time derivative using forward differences:\n\n$$\n\\frac{u_{i,j}^{k+1} - u_{i,j}^k}{\\Delta t} = 0.05 \\left( \\frac{u_{i+1,j}^k - 2u_{i,j}^k + u_{i-1,j}^k}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{u_{i,j+1}^k - 2u_{i,j}^k + u_{i,j-1}^k}{\\Delta y^2} \\right)\n$$\n\nSince $\\Delta x = \\Delta y = 1$, we can simplify the equation and solve for $u_{i,j}^{k+1}$:\n\n$$\nu_{i,j}^{k+1} = u_{i,j}^k + 0.05 \\Delta t \\left( u_{i+1,j}^k - 4u_{i,j}^k + u_{i-1,j}^k + u_{i,j+1}^k + u_{i,j-1}^k \\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we can implement Euler's method in Python and plot the resulting temperature distribution at time $t = 100$:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef heat_equation(I, alpha, dt, t_end):\n    u = I.copy()\n    u_next = u.copy()\n    t = 0\n    \n    while t < t_end:\n        for i in range(1, u.shape[0] - 1):\n            for j in range(1, u.shape[1] - 1):\n                u_next[i, j] = u[i, j] + alpha * dt * (u[i+1, j] - 4*u[i, j] + u[i-1, j] + u[i, j+1] + u[i, j-1])\n        \n        u = u_next.copy()\n        t += dt\n    \n    return u\n\n# Example grayscale image\nI = np.random.rand(256, 256)\n\n# Parameters\nalpha = 0.05\ndt = 1\nt_end = 100\n\n# Solve the heat equation\nu_final = heat_equation(I, alpha, dt, t_end)\n\n# Plot the initial and final temperature distributions\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 6))\nax1.imshow(I, cmap='gray')\nax1.set_title('Initial Temperature Distribution')\nax2.imshow(u_final, cmap='gray')\nax2.set_title('Final Temperature Distribution at t = 100')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code will plot the initial and final temperature distributions (i.e., the original and smoothed images) at time $t = 100$. Note that the actual results will depend on the input image `I`."
