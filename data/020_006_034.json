    "message_1": "A company needs to determine the optimal production quantity for two products: Product A requires 2 units of machine time and 4 units of labor time, while Product B requires 3 units of machine time and 5 units of labor time. The company has 12 units of machine time and 20 units of labor time available daily. Each unit of Product A yields a profit of $10, and each unit of Product B yields a profit of $15. What is the optimal production plan that maximizes the total profit of the company subject to the available resources?",
