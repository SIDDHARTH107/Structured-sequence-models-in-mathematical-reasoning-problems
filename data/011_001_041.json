    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose 4 friends out of 8, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of friends (8) and k is the number of friends to be chosen (4).\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!(8-4)!)\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!4!)\n\nC(8, 4) = (8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((4*3*2*1)*(4*3*2*1))\n\nC(8, 4) = (8*7*6*5) / (4*3*2*1)\n\nC(8, 4) = 1680 / 24\n\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nSo there are 70 different ways to choose which 4 friends can go to the cinema."
