    "message_2": "Bezout's Theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves, counted with multiplicity, is equal to the product of the degrees of the two curves, provided that the curves have no common components.\n\nFirst, let's find the degrees of the two curves:\n\nC1: y = x^2 + 2x + 3\nThis is a quadratic equation in x, so its degree is 2.\n\nC2: y = 3x - 1\nThis is a linear equation in x, so its degree is 1.\n\nNow, let's apply Bezout's Theorem:\nThe number of intersection points = (degree of C1) * (degree of C2) = 2 * 1 = 2\n\nTherefore, there are 2 intersection points of C1 and C2 in the complex plane, counted with multiplicity."
