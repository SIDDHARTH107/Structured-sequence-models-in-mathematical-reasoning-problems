    "message_2": "To solve the exponential equation 3^(2x+1) = 81, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite 81 as a power of 3. Since 3^4 = 81, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n3^(2x+1) = 3^4\n\nStep 2: Since the bases are equal (both are 3), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n2x + 1 = 4\n\nStep 3: Solve for x:\n\n2x = 4 - 1\n2x = 3\nx = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution to the exponential equation 3^(2x+1) = 81 is x = 3/2."
