The system is set into motion with an initial velocity of 10 m/s and an initial displacement of 0.05 m. Find the amplitude, angular frequency, and period of the resulting oscillation.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the amplitude, angular frequency, and period of the oscillation.\n\n1. Amplitude (A):\nThe amplitude is the maximum displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position. We can use the formula for the total mechanical energy of the system to find the amplitude:\n\nE_total = (1/2) * k * A^2 + (1/2) * m * v^2\n\nwhere E_total is the total mechanical energy, k is the spring constant, A is the amplitude, m is the mass, and v is the initial velocity. We can rearrange the formula to solve for A:\n\nA^2 = (2 * E_total / k) - (m * v^2 / k)\n\nFirst, we need to find the total mechanical energy. Since the initial displacement is 0.05 m, the potential energy stored in the spring is:\n\nE_potential = (1/2) * k * x^2 = (1/2) * 4 * (0.05)^2 = 0.25 J\n\nThe kinetic energy of the mass is:\n\nE_kinetic = (1/2) * m * v^2 = (1/2) * 2 * (10)^2 = 100 J\n\nSo, the total mechanical energy is:\n\nE_total = E_potential + E_kinetic = 0.25 + 100 = 100.25 J\n\nNow, we can find the amplitude:\n\nA^2 = (2 * 100.25 / 4) - (2 * 10^2 / 4) = 50.25 - 50 = 0.25\nA = sqrt(0.25) = 0.5 m\n\n2. Angular frequency (ω):\nThe angular frequency can be found using the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k / m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and m is the mass. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nω = sqrt(4 / 2) = sqrt(2) rad/s\n\n3. Period (T):\nThe period of the oscillation is the time it takes for the mass to complete one full cycle. It can be found using the formula:\n\nT = 2 * π / ω\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency. Plugging in the value, we get:\n\nT = 2 * π / sqrt(2) ≈ 4.44 s\n\nSo, the amplitude of the oscillation is 0.5 m, the angular frequency is sqrt(2) rad/s, and the period is approximately 4.44 s."
