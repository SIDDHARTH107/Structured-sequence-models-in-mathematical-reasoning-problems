    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot duopoly with two firms, A and B. Firm A has the cost function of C_A(q_A) = 20q_A, and firm B has the cost function of C_B(q_B) = 30q_B. The inverse demand function is P = 100 - q, where q = q_A + q_B is the total quantity produced in the market. What will be the output and profit of each firm if they act independently and aim to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the output and profit of each firm, we first need to find their reaction functions. The reaction function of a firm shows the quantity it will produce given the quantity produced by the other firm.\n\nLet's start with firm A. The profit function for firm A is:\n\nπ_A = P * q_A - C_A(q_A) = (100 - q) * q_A - 20q_A\n\nSince q = q_A + q_B, we can rewrite the profit function as:\n\nπ_A = (100 - (q_A + q_B)) * q_A - 20q_A\n\nNow, we need to find the first-order condition (FOC) by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to q_A and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndπ_A/dq_A = (100 - q_A - q_B) - 20 = 0\n\nSolving for q_A, we get the reaction function for firm A:\n\nq_A = 80 - q_B\n\nNow, let's do the same for firm B. The profit function for firm B is:\n\nπ_B = P * q_B - C_B(q_B) = (100 - q) * q_B - 30q_B\n\nRewriting the profit function using q = q_A + q_B:\n\nπ_B = (100 - (q_A + q_B)) * q_B - 30q_B\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to q_B and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndπ_B/dq_B = (100 - q_A - q_B) - 30 = 0\n\nSolving for q_B, we get the reaction function for firm B:\n\nq_B = 70 - q_A\n\nNow, we have both reaction functions:\n\nq_A = 80 - q_B\nq_B = 70 - q_A\n\nTo find the Nash equilibrium, we need to solve these equations simultaneously. We can substitute q_B from the second equation into the first equation:\n\nq_A = 80 - (70 - q_A)\n\nSolving for q_A:\n\n2q_A = 80 - 70\n2q_A = 10\nq_A = 5\n\nNow, we can find q_B by substituting q_A back into the second equation:\n\nq_B = 70 - 5\nq_B = 65\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium quantities are q_A = 5 and q_B = 65.\n\nNow, let's find the profits for each firm. First, we need to find the market price using the inverse demand function:\n\nP = 100 - q = 100 - (q_A + q_B) = 100 - (5 + 65) = 100 - 70 = 30\n\nNow, we can find the profits for each firm:\n\nπ_A = P * q_A - C_A(q_A) = 30 * 5 - 20 * 5 = 150 - 100 = 50\nπ_B = P * q_B - C_B(q_B) = 30 * 65 - 30 * 65 = 1950 - 1950 = 0\n\nSo, the profits for each firm are π_A = 50 and π_B = 0."
