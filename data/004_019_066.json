    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car, we need to find the first derivative of the position function with respect to time, which represents the velocity function $v(t)$. \n\n$v(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(3t^2 - 6t + 2)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n$v(t) = 6t - 6$\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at $t=2$ seconds by plugging in the value of $t$ into the velocity function:\n\n$v(2) = 6(2) - 6 = 12 - 6 = 6$ m/s\n\nTo find the acceleration of the car, we need to find the second derivative of the position function with respect to time, which represents the acceleration function $a(t)$. \n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(3t^2 - 6t + 2)$\n\nFirst, we already found the first derivative (velocity function) $v(t) = 6t - 6$. Now, we need to find the derivative of the velocity function:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(6t - 6)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n$a(t) = 6$\n\nThe acceleration function is a constant, so the acceleration of the car at $t=2$ seconds is the same as its acceleration at any other time:\n\n$a(2) = 6$ m/s²\n\nSo, the velocity of the car at $t=2$ seconds is $6$ m/s, and its acceleration is $6$ m/s²."
