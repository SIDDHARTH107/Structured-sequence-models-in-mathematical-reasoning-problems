Using linear regression, predict the English scores of students if their Mathematics scores are 75.\n\n| Math Score | English Score |\n|------------|---------------|\n| 60         | 65            |\n| 65         | 70            |\n| 70         | 75            |\n| 75         | 80            |\n| 80         | 85            |\n| 85         | 90            |\n| 90         | 95            |\n\nUsing this data, what is the predicted English score of a student with a Mathematics score of 75?",
    "message_2": "To predict the English score of a student with a Mathematics score of 75 using linear regression, we first need to find the line of best fit for the given data. The line of best fit can be represented as y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the Math scores (X) and the mean of the English scores (Y):\n\nMean of Math scores (X_mean) = (60 + 65 + 70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90) / 7 = 525 / 7 = 75\nMean of English scores (Y_mean) = (65 + 70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 95) / 7 = 560 / 7 = 80\n\n2. Calculate the slope (m):\n\nm = Σ[(X - X_mean)(Y - Y_mean)] / Σ(X - X_mean)^2\n\nFor each data point, calculate (X - X_mean)(Y - Y_mean) and (X - X_mean)^2:\n\n| Math Score | English Score | (X - X_mean)(Y - Y_mean) | (X - X_mean)^2 |\n|------------|---------------|--------------------------|----------------|\n| 60         | 65            | 225                      | 225            |\n| 65         | 70            | 50                       | 100            |\n| 70         | 75            | 0                        | 25             |\n| 75         | 80            | 0                        | 0              |\n| 80         | 85            | 0                        | 25             |\n| 85         | 90            | 50                       | 100            |\n| 90         | 95            | 225                      | 225            |\n\nSum the last two columns:\n\nΣ[(X - X_mean)(Y - Y_mean)] = 225 + 50 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 50 + 225 = 550\nΣ(X - X_mean)^2 = 225 + 100 + 25 + 0 + 25 + 100 + 225 = 700\n\nNow, calculate the slope (m):\n\nm = 550 / 700 = 0.7857\n\n3. Calculate the y-intercept (b):\n\nb = Y_mean - m * X_mean = 80 - 0.7857 * 75 = 80 - 58.9285 = 21.0715\n\n4. The line of best fit is:\n\ny = 0.7857x + 21.0715\n\n5. Predict the English score for a student with a Math score of 75:\n\ny = 0.7857 * 75 + 21.0715 = 58.9285 + 21.0715 = 80\n\nThe predicted English score for a student with a Mathematics score of 75 is 80."
