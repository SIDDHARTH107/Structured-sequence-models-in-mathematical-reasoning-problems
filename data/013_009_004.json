    "message_1": "Two players, A and B, play the game of Matching Pennies. In this game, each player simultaneously chooses to show either a heads or a tails on a penny. If the two coins match (both heads or both tails), player A wins, and if they are different (one head and one tail), player B wins. \n\nAssuming that player A always chooses heads and player B always chooses tails, what is the probability that player A wins the game?",
    "message_2": "Since player A always chooses heads and player B always chooses tails, the outcome will always be one head and one tail. Therefore, the probability that player A wins the game is 0, as the coins will never match."
