    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we will use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of a series is less than 1, then the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{2^{n+1}}{n+1}(z-3)^{n+1}}{\\frac{2^n}{n}(z-3)^n}\\right|$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{2^{n+1}(z-3)}{n+1}\\cdot\\frac{n}{2^n}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|2\\frac{n}{n+1}(z-3)\\right|$\n\nNow, we want this limit to be less than 1 for convergence:\n\n$|2(z-3)|\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{n}{n+1}\\right| < 1$\n\nSince the limit of the fraction as n approaches infinity is 1, we have:\n\n$|2(z-3)| < 1$\n\nNow, we can solve for the interval of convergence:\n\n$-1 < 2(z-3) < 1$\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n$-\\frac{1}{2} < (z-3) < \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nAdd 3 to each part of the inequality:\n\n$2.5 < z < 3.5$\n\nSo, the interval of convergence is $(2.5, 3.5)$. \n\nNow, let's find the radius of convergence. The radius of convergence is half the length of the interval of convergence:\n\n$R = \\frac{3.5 - 2.5}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThus, the radius of convergence is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the interval of convergence is $(2.5, 3.5)$."
