    "message_1": "Unfortunately, non-monotonic logic does not involve numerical problems, as it is concerned with reasoning under conditions of uncertainty or incomplete information, including reasoning with defaults, exceptions, and revisions. However, here's an example question suited to non-monotonic logic:\n\nGiven the premises \"All birds can fly\" and \"Penguins cannot fly,\" what can you infer about the statement \"All animals that can fly are birds\"?",
    "message_2": "Given the premises \"All birds can fly\" and \"Penguins cannot fly,\" we can infer that penguins are an exception to the general rule that all birds can fly. This is an example of non-monotonic reasoning, as it involves reasoning with defaults and exceptions.\n\nNow, considering the statement \"All animals that can fly are birds,\" we can infer that this statement is generally true, but with some exceptions. For example, bats are animals that can fly but are not birds. So, the statement is not universally true, but it holds true for most cases, excluding some exceptions like bats."
