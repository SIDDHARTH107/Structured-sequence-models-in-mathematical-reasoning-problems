We are looking for the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that satisfies this theorem.\n\nLet's test the smallest prime numbers:\n\nFor p = 2, (2-1)! = 1! = 1, and 1 ≡ -1 (mod 2), so Wilson's theorem holds.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the smallest positive integer greater than 1, we need to find the next smallest prime number that satisfies Wilson's theorem.\n\nFor p = 3, (3-1)! = 2! = 2, and 2 ≡ -1 (mod 3), so Wilson's theorem holds.\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that satisfies Wilson's theorem is 3."
