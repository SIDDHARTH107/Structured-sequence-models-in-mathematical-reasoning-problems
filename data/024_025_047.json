    "message_2": "Given that X is a complex projective manifold of dimension 2 with Chern classes c1(X) = 3h and c2(X) = 8h^2, where h is the hyperplane class, we are asked to find the values of the first Chern class and the second Chern class of X.\n\nThe first Chern class c1(X) is already given as 3h. So, c1(X) = 3h.\n\nThe second Chern class c2(X) is also given as 8h^2. So, c2(X) = 8h^2.\n\nThus, the first Chern class of X is 3h, and the second Chern class of X is 8h^2."
