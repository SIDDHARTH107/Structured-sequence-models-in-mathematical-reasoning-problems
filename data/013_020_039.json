    "message_1": "Consider a beauty contest game where there are 10 participants. Each participant has to guess a number between 0 and 100, and the winner will be the one whose guess is the closest number to 2/3 of the average of all guesses. If two or more participants have the closest guess, the prize will be divided equally among them. Assuming that all participants are rational and fully aware of the rules of the game, what number should each participant guess to maximize their chances of winning the prize?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze this problem step by step.\n\n1. If all participants guess randomly, the average of all guesses would be around 50 (since it's the midpoint of the range 0 to 100). In this case, the winning guess would be 2/3 * 50 = 33.33.\n\n2. However, all participants are rational and know that the winning guess will be 2/3 of the average. So, they will adjust their guesses accordingly. If everyone guesses 33.33, the average would be 33.33, and the winning guess would be 2/3 * 33.33 = 22.22.\n\n3. Participants will again adjust their guesses, knowing that others will guess around 22.22. If everyone guesses 22.22, the average would be 22.22, and the winning guess would be 2/3 * 22.22 = 14.81.\n\n4. This process of iterated elimination of dominated strategies will continue, with each participant adjusting their guesses based on the assumption that others will also adjust their guesses. As this process continues, the guesses will converge towards 0.\n\nIn conclusion, the rational strategy for each participant to maximize their chances of winning the prize is to guess 0. This is because, as the iterated elimination of dominated strategies continues, the winning guess converges towards 0."
