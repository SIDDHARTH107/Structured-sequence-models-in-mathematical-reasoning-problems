    "message_1": "A circle has a radius of 7 cm. Find the perimeter of the sector formed by a central angle of 60 degrees. (Round to two decimal places)",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to find the length of the arc and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 60 degrees and the radius is 7 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (60/360) × 2π(7)\nArc length = (1/6) × 14π\nArc length = 14π/6\nArc length ≈ 7.33 cm (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the sector, we add the arc length to the two radii:\n\nPerimeter = arc length + 2r\nPerimeter = 7.33 + 2(7)\nPerimeter = 7.33 + 14\nPerimeter ≈ 21.33 cm (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 21.33 cm."
