    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the time-dependent wave function ψ(x,t) and then calculate the probability of finding the particle in the given range.\n\nSince the potential energy function V(x) is zero inside the box (-L/2 < x < L/2), the Schrödinger equation simplifies to:\n\niħ * ∂(ψ(x,t))/∂t = -(ħ²/2m) * ∂²(ψ(x,t))/∂x²\n\nNow, we can use separation of variables to solve this equation. Let ψ(x,t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\niħ * X(x) * dT(t)/dt = -(ħ²/2m) * T(t) * d²X(x)/dx²\n\nDividing both sides by X(x)T(t), we get:\n\n(iħ * dT(t)/dt) / T(t) = (-(ħ²/2m) * d²X(x)/dx²) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side is a function of time only and the right side is a function of position only, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant E (energy). Then we have two equations:\n\n1) iħ * dT(t)/dt = E * T(t)\n2) -(ħ²/2m) * d²X(x)/dx² = E * X(x)\n\nSolving equation (1) for T(t), we get:\n\nT(t) = e^(-iEt/ħ)\n\nNow, we need to solve equation (2) for X(x). This is a standard time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a box:\n\n-(ħ²/2m) * d²X(x)/dx² = E * X(x)\n\nThe general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere k² = 2mE/ħ².\n\nApplying the boundary conditions X(-L/2) = X(L/2) = 0, we get:\n\nA * sin(-kL/2) + B * cos(-kL/2) = 0\nA * sin(kL/2) + B * cos(kL/2) = 0\n\nSince sin(-x) = -sin(x) and cos(-x) = cos(x), we can simplify the first equation to:\n\n-A * sin(kL/2) + B * cos(kL/2) = 0\n\nAdding the two equations, we get:\n\n2B * cos(kL/2) = 0\n\nThis implies that B = 0 or cos(kL/2) = 0. Since B = 0 leads to a trivial solution X(x) = 0, we consider cos(kL/2) = 0. This gives:\n\nkL/2 = (2n + 1) * π/2\n\nwhere n is an integer. Therefore, k = (2n + 1) * π/L and E = (ħ²/2m) * k².\n\nNow, we can write the time-dependent wave function ψ(x,t) as:\n\nψ(x,t) = X(x)T(t) = A * sin((2n + 1) * πx/L) * e^(-iEt/ħ)\n\nApplying the initial condition ψ(x,0) = sin(πx/L) and ∂(ψ(x,t))/∂t = 0 for t=0, we find that n = 0 and A = 1. Thus, the wave function is:\n\nψ(x,t) = sin(πx/L) * e^(-iE₀t/ħ)\n\nwhere E₀ = (ħ²/2m) * (π/L)².\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of finding the particle in the range -L/4 < x < L/4 at time t = 10^-15 s:\n\nP = ∫[ψ(x,10^-15)]² dx from -L/4 to L/4\n\nP = ∫[sin(πx/L) * e^(-iE₀(10^-15)/ħ)]² dx from -L/4 to L/4\n\nSince the time-dependent part e^(-iE₀(10^-15)/ħ) has a magnitude of 1, the probability simplifies to:\n\nP = ∫[sin²(πx/L)] dx from -L/4 to L/4\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\nP = (L/2π) * (π - sin(π/2))\n\nP = (L/2π) * (π - 1)\n\nThus, the probability of finding the particle in the range -L/4 < x < L/4 at time t = 10^-15 s is given by:\n\nP = (L/2π) * (π - 1)"
