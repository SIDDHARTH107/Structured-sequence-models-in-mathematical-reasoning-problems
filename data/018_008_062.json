    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, and then find the Cartesian product of B and A. Show that the two products are not equal, and hence prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B.\n\nFirst, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B (A × B):\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A (B × A):\n\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nWe can see that A × B and B × A are not equal:\n\nA × B ≠ B × A\n\nThis is because the ordered pairs in A × B and B × A are different. In A × B, the first element of each ordered pair comes from set A, and the second element comes from set B. In B × A, the first element of each ordered pair comes from set B, and the second element comes from set A.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
