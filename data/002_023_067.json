    "message_1": "A sphere has a diameter of 12 centimeters. What is the surface area of the sphere?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the sphere is 12 centimeters, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is:\n\nr = 12 cm / 2 = 6 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the radius into the surface area formula:\n\nSurface area = 4 * π * (6 cm)^2\nSurface area = 4 * π * 36 cm^2\nSurface area = 144π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 452.39 square centimeters (rounded to two decimal places)."
