The cost of the box material is 10 cents per square centimeter. What are the dimensions of the box that will minimize the cost of the box?",
    "message_2": "Let the width of the base be x cm and the length of the base be 2x cm. Let the height of the box be h cm. We are given that the volume of the box is 6,000 cubic centimeters. Therefore, we have:\n\nx * 2x * h = 6,000\n2x^2 * h = 6,000\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions that minimize the cost of the box. The cost is determined by the surface area of the box since the material cost is 10 cents per square centimeter. The surface area of the box with an open top can be calculated as follows:\n\nSurface Area = length * width + 2 * (length * height) + 2 * (width * height)\nSurface Area = 2x * x + 2 * (2x * h) + 2 * (x * h)\nSurface Area = 2x^2 + 4xh + 2xh\n\nWe want to minimize the Surface Area, so we need to express it in terms of one variable. We can use the volume equation to do this:\n\nh = 6,000 / (2x^2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h in the Surface Area equation:\n\nSurface Area = 2x^2 + 4x(6,000 / (2x^2)) + 2x(6,000 / (2x^2))\nSurface Area = 2x^2 + 12,000/x + 12,000/x\nSurface Area = 2x^2 + 24,000/x\n\nNow, we need to minimize this function. To do this, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of the Surface Area function with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(Surface Area)/dx = 4x - 24,000/x^2\n\nSetting the derivative equal to 0:\n\n4x - 24,000/x^2 = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by x^2:\n\n4x^3 - 24,000 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n4x^3 = 24,000\nx^3 = 6,000\nx = (6,000)^(1/3)\nx ≈ 18.14 cm\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the length and height:\n\nLength = 2x ≈ 2 * 18.14 ≈ 36.28 cm\nHeight = 6,000 / (2x^2) ≈ 6,000 / (2 * (18.14)^2) ≈ 9.14 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that will minimize the cost are approximately:\nWidth: 18.14 cm\nLength: 36.28 cm\nHeight: 9.14 cm"
