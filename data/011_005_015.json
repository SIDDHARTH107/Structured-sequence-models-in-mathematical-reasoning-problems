    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to form a committee of 4 people out of a group of 10 people, we can use the combination formula. The combination formula is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people, k is the number of people in the committee, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and k = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!6!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorials:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nC(10, 4) = 3,628,800 / (24 × 720)\n\nC(10, 4) = 3,628,800 / 17,280\n\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 ways to form a committee of 4 people out of a group of 10 people, where the order in which the committee is formed does not matter."
