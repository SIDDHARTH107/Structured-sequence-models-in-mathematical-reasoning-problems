    "message_2": "To prove that $f$ has at least 3 distinct non-degenerate critical levels, we will use the concept of the Poincaré-Hopf theorem and the Euler characteristic of the sphere.\n\nThe Poincaré-Hopf theorem states that for a smooth vector field $X$ on a compact, oriented, smooth manifold $M$ with boundary, the sum of the indices of the zeroes of $X$ is equal to the Euler characteristic of $M$. In our case, $M = S^2$ and the Euler characteristic is $\\chi(S^2) = 2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the gradient vector field of the function $f$, denoted as $\\nabla f$. Since $f$ has no critical points, the gradient vector field $\\nabla f$ has no zeroes on $S^2$. We can perturb the gradient vector field slightly to obtain a new vector field $X$ with isolated zeroes on $S^2$. This can be done by choosing a small $\\epsilon > 0$ and defining $X = \\nabla f + \\epsilon Y$, where $Y$ is a smooth vector field on $S^2$ such that $X$ has isolated zeroes.\n\nNow, we apply the Poincaré-Hopf theorem to the vector field $X$. The sum of the indices of the zeroes of $X$ is equal to the Euler characteristic of $S^2$, which is 2. Since the index of a non-degenerate critical point is either 1 or -1, there must be at least 3 non-degenerate critical points of $X$ to achieve a sum of 2.\n\nLet $p_1, p_2, p_3$ be three distinct non-degenerate critical points of $X$. Since $X$ is a perturbation of $\\nabla f$, the function $f$ has distinct non-degenerate critical levels corresponding to these critical points. Therefore, $f$ has at least 3 distinct non-degenerate critical levels."
