    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can't provide real-time data or probabilities based on specific scientific models. However, I can give you a general idea based on historical data.\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), September is the peak month for hurricane activity in the North Atlantic region. Historically, about 34% of all Atlantic hurricanes occur in September.\n\nUsing this information, the estimated probability of a hurricane forming in the North Atlantic region during the month of September would be approximately 0.34 or 34%. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate based on historical data and does not take into account any specific chaos theory models or real-time data."
