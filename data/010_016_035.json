    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic (χ) of a topological space X is defined as the alternating sum of its Betti numbers. In this case, we have:\n\nχ(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2\n\nGiven the Betti numbers b_0 = 2, b_1 = 4, and b_2 = 3, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nχ(X) = 2 - 4 + 3\n\nχ(X) = 1\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of the topological space X is 1."
