    "message_2": "a) The matrix of coefficients A is formed by the coefficients of the variables x and y in the given system of linear equations. So, we have:\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4 -5 |\n\nb) To calculate the determinant of A, we use the formula det(A) = ad - bc, where a, b, c, and d are the elements of the matrix A:\n\ndet(A) = (2 * -5) - (3 * 4) = -10 - 12 = -22\n\nc) To find the inverse matrix A^-1, we use the formula A^-1 = (1/det(A)) * adj(A), where adj(A) is the adjugate of A. The adjugate of A is obtained by swapping the diagonal elements a and d, and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements b and c:\n\nadj(A) = | -5 -3 |\n         | -4  2 |\n\nNow, we can find A^-1:\n\nA^-1 = (1/-22) * | -5 -3 |\n                | -4  2 |\n\nA^-1 = | 5/22  3/22 |\n       | 4/22 -2/22 |\n\nd) To solve the system of linear equations using A^-1, we need to multiply A^-1 by the constant matrix B, where B is formed by the constants on the right side of the given system of linear equations:\n\nB = |  7  |\n    | -18 |\n\nNow, we multiply A^-1 by B:\n\nA^-1 * B = | 5/22  3/22 | * |  7  |\n           | 4/22 -2/22 |   | -18 |\n\n= | (5/22)*7 + (3/22)*(-18) |\n  | (4/22)*7 + (-2/22)*(-18) |\n\n= | 1 |\n  | 2 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1 and y = 2."
