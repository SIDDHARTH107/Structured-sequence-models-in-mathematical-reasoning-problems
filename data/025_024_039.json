Consider the action of the group G = (C^*)^2 on X given by (λ, μ)(x : y : z : w) = (λ^2x : λy : μz : w). Show that the ring of G-invariant functions on X is generated by u = xz and v = y^2.",
    "message_2": "To show that the ring of G-invariant functions on X is generated by u = xz and v = y^2, we need to show that any G-invariant function can be expressed as a polynomial in u and v.\n\nLet f(x, y, z, w) be a G-invariant function on X. Since f is G-invariant, we have:\n\nf(λ^2x, λy, μz, w) = f(x, y, z, w) for all (λ, μ) in (C^*)^2.\n\nNow, consider the action of G on the monomials x^i y^j z^k w^l. We have:\n\n(λ, μ)(x^i y^j z^k w^l) = λ^(2i+j) μ^k x^i y^j z^k w^l.\n\nFor f to be G-invariant, it must be a linear combination of monomials that are fixed under the action of G. This means that the exponents in the monomials must satisfy the following condition:\n\n2i + j = k.\n\nSince X is defined by the equation x^2 - yz = 0, we can rewrite this condition as:\n\nx^2 = yz.\n\nNow, let's express the monomials x^i y^j z^k w^l in terms of u and v:\n\nx^i y^j z^k w^l = (x^2)^(i/2) y^j z^(k-i) w^l = (yz)^(i/2) y^j z^(k-i) w^l = y^(j+i/2) z^(k-i/2) w^l.\n\nWe can rewrite this expression in terms of u and v:\n\ny^(j+i/2) z^(k-i/2) w^l = (y^2)^(j/2+i/4) (xz)^(k/2-i/4) w^l = v^(j/2+i/4) u^(k/2-i/4) w^l.\n\nSince f is a linear combination of monomials that are fixed under the action of G, it can be expressed as a polynomial in u and v. Therefore, the ring of G-invariant functions on X is generated by u = xz and v = y^2."
