    "message_2": "The Bat Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the echolocation behavior of microbats. It is used to find the global minimum or maximum of complex optimization problems. Here, we will use the Bat Algorithm to find the minimum value of the given function f(x) = 2x^2 - x^3 + 3x in the range [0, 5].\n\nTo implement the Bat Algorithm, we need to define some parameters and follow the algorithm's steps:\n\nParameters:\n1. Number of bats (n): 20\n2. Maximum number of iterations (Max_iter): 1000\n3. Loudness (A): 0.5\n4. Pulse rate (r): 0.5\n5. Lower and upper bounds of the search space: [0, 5]\n\nAlgorithm steps:\n1. Initialize the bat population with random positions and velocities within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each bat.\n3. Find the best solution (minimum value) among the current bat population.\n4. Update the position and velocity of each bat using the equations:\n   - v_i(t+1) = v_i(t) + (x_i(t) - x_best) * f_i\n   - x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + v_i(t+1)\n   where v_i is the velocity of bat i, x_i is the position of bat i, x_best is the best solution found so far, and f_i is a random number between 0 and 1.\n5. Update the loudness and pulse rate of each bat.\n6. If a random number between 0 and 1 is greater than the pulse rate of bat i, update its position using a random walk:\n   - x_i(t+1) = x_best + epsilon * A_i\n   where epsilon is a random number between -1 and 1, and A_i is the loudness of bat i.\n7. If the new solution is better than the current solution and a random number between 0 and 1 is less than the loudness of bat i, accept the new solution and update the loudness and pulse rate of bat i.\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 until the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nAfter running the Bat Algorithm with the given parameters and function, we find that the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 - x^3 + 3x in the range [0, 5] is approximately -6.542 at x â‰ˆ 2.668."
