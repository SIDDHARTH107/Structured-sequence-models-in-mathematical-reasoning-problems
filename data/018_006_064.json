    "message_2": "Step 1: Find the complement of A.\nThe complement of A, denoted by A', consists of all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. \n\nA' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nStep 2: Calculate the union of A and its complement A'.\nThe union of two sets A and B, denoted by A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both.\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ∪ {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nStep 3: Combine the elements of A and A' without repetition.\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nStep 4: Compare the result with the universal set U.\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} is equal to the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nTherefore, the union of A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U."
