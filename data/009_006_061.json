At t=0, [C]=0. What is the concentration of substance C, [C], after 5 minutes if the rate constant is k=0.025 L/mol/min?",
    "message_2": "To find the concentration of substance C after 5 minutes, we need to integrate the rate equation with respect to time. \n\nGiven: dC/dt = k[A][B]^(1/2)\n\nLet's first integrate both sides with respect to time:\n\n∫dC = ∫k[A][B]^(1/2) dt\n\nSince k, [A], and [B] are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n\nC = k[A]∫[B]^(1/2) dt\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of [B]^(1/2) with respect to time. Since [B] is a constant, its integral with respect to time is just [B]^(1/2)t:\n\nC = k[A][B]^(1/2)t\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for k, [A], [B], and t:\n\nC = (0.025 L/mol/min)(0.02 M)(0.04 M)^(1/2)(5 min)\n\nC = (0.025 L/mol/min)(0.02 M)(0.2)(5 min)\n\nC = 0.005 L/mol\n\nSo, the concentration of substance C after 5 minutes is 0.005 M."
