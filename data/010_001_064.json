    "message_2": "Since X is connected, it cannot be written as the union of two non-empty disjoint open sets. We are given that X has exactly three open sets. Let's denote these open sets as U, V, and W. We know that the empty set and the whole space X are always open sets in any topological space. So, without loss of generality, let U = ∅, V = X, and W be the third open set.\n\nNow, we are given that the closure of {2} in X is {1, 2, 3}. The closure of a set is the smallest closed set containing that set. In other words, the closure of {2} is the intersection of all closed sets containing {2}. Since V = X is open, its complement, which is U = ∅, is closed. However, this closed set does not contain {2}, so it is not relevant to the closure of {2}.\n\nThe only other closed set in X is the complement of W. Since the closure of {2} is {1, 2, 3}, the complement of W must be a closed set containing {1, 2, 3}. Therefore, W cannot contain any of the elements {1, 2, 3}. Since V = X is the whole space, the only possibility left for W is the empty set. But we already have U = ∅, which contradicts the fact that X has exactly three open sets.\n\nTherefore, there is no topological space X satisfying the given conditions."
