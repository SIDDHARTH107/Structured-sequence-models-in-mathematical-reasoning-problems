    "message_2": "The degree of a hypersurface in projective space is determined by the highest degree of the monomials in its defining equation. In this case, the defining equation is given by $x_{0}^{d}+x_{1}^{d}+\\cdots+x_{n}^{d}=0$. Since each term has degree $d$, the degree of the hypersurface is $d$."
