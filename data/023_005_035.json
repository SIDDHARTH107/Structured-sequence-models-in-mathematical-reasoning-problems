    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation y'' + 4y = 0 with initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0 using Fourier transform, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given equation.\n\nLet Y(w) be the Fourier transform of y(x), then the Fourier transform of y''(x) is (iw)^2 Y(w). So, the Fourier transform of the given differential equation is:\n\n(iw)^2 Y(w) + 4Y(w) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(w):\n\nY(w) [(iw)^2 + 4] = 0\n\nSince Y(w) ≠ 0, we have:\n\n(iw)^2 + 4 = 0\n\nSolving for w, we get:\n\nw = ±2\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(w) to get y(x):\n\ny(x) = (1/2π) ∫[Y(w) e^(iwx) dw] = (1/2π) [Ae^(2ix) + Be^(-2ix)]\n\nNow, we can use the initial conditions to find the constants A and B:\n\n1. y(0) = 1:\n\n(1/2π) [Ae^(0) + Be^(0)] = 1\n\nA + B = 2π\n\n2. y'(0) = 0:\n\n(1/2π) [2iAe^(0) - 2iBe^(0)] = 0\n\n2iA - 2iB = 0\n\nA = B\n\nFrom the above two equations, we get A = B = π. So, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = (1/2π) [πe^(2ix) + πe^(-2ix)]\n\ny(x) = (1/2) [e^(2ix) + e^(-2ix)]\n\nThis is the solution to the given differential equation using Fourier transform. Note that this is the complex form of the solution. The real part of this solution represents the actual solution to the problem:\n\ny(x) = cos(2x)"
