    "message_2": "To find the expected change in price, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected change = (Probability of increase * Increase amount) + (Probability of decrease * Decrease amount)\n\nExpected change = (0.60 * $2) + (0.40 * -$4)\n\nExpected change = ($1.20) + (-$1.60)\n\nExpected change = -$0.40\n\nSo, the expected change in price of the stock is a decrease of $0.40."
