    "message_1": "A researcher conducted an experiment to determine the effectiveness of a new drug on reducing blood pressure. The researcher randomly assigned 50 participants to receive either the new drug or a placebo. The average reduction in blood pressure for the group receiving the new drug was found to be 6.8 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 2.5 mm Hg, while the average reduction for the placebo group was found to be 1.2 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 1.8 mm Hg. \n\nTest the hypothesis that the new drug is effective in reducing blood pressure at a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To test the hypothesis that the new drug is effective in reducing blood pressure at a significance level of 0.05, we will conduct an independent samples t-test. \n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses\nNull hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in blood pressure reduction between the new drug and the placebo group (µ1 - µ2 = 0).\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in blood pressure reduction between the new drug and the placebo group (µ1 - µ2 ≠ 0).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the test statistic (t-value)\nt = (M1 - M2) / sqrt((s1^2 / n1) + (s2^2 / n2))\n\nWhere:\nM1 = mean reduction in blood pressure for the new drug group (6.8 mm Hg)\nM2 = mean reduction in blood pressure for the placebo group (1.2 mm Hg)\ns1 = standard deviation of the new drug group (2.5 mm Hg)\ns2 = standard deviation of the placebo group (1.8 mm Hg)\nn1 = number of participants in the new drug group (25)\nn2 = number of participants in the placebo group (25)\n\nt = (6.8 - 1.2) / sqrt((2.5^2 / 25) + (1.8^2 / 25))\nt = 5.6 / sqrt((6.25 / 25) + (3.24 / 25))\nt = 5.6 / sqrt(0.25 + 0.1296)\nt = 5.6 / sqrt(0.3796)\nt = 5.6 / 0.6159\nt ≈ 9.09\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical t-value\nSince we are conducting a two-tailed test at a significance level of 0.05, we need to find the critical t-value that corresponds to the 0.025 level in each tail. With 48 degrees of freedom (n1 + n2 - 2 = 25 + 25 - 2 = 48), we can use a t-distribution table or calculator to find the critical t-value. \n\nThe critical t-value for a two-tailed test with α = 0.05 and 48 degrees of freedom is approximately ±2.0106.\n\nStep 4: Compare the test statistic to the critical t-value\nOur calculated t-value (9.09) is greater than the critical t-value (2.0106). \n\nStep 5: Make a decision\nSince the calculated t-value is greater than the critical t-value, we reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in blood pressure reduction between the new drug and the placebo group at a significance level of 0.05. This suggests that the new drug is effective in reducing blood pressure."
