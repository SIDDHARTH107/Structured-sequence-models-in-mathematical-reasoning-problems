    "message_2": "To find the value of the third coordinate (z) of a point on the Lorenz attractor, we need to use the Lorenz equations:\n\ndx/dt = σ(y - x)\ndy/dt = x(ρ - z) - y\ndz/dt = xy - βz\n\nGiven the values x = 1.23, y = 2.34, σ = 10, β = 8/3, and ρ = 28, we can use the second equation to find the equilibrium points of the system, where dx/dt = dy/dt = dz/dt = 0.\n\n0 = x(ρ - z) - y\n0 = 1.23(28 - z) - 2.34\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\n2.34 = 1.23(28 - z)\n2.34 = 34.44 - 1.23z\n1.23z = 32.1\nz ≈ 26.1\n\nSo, the value of the third coordinate (z) of a point on the Lorenz attractor when the first two coordinates (x and y) are 1.23 and 2.34, respectively, and the parameters of the Lorenz system are set to σ = 10, β = 8/3, and ρ = 28 is approximately 26.1."
