    "message_1": "Suppose you intercepted the following message that was encrypted using the Hill cipher:\n\nVGOLF\n\nWith a key matrix of:\n\n2 3\n1 2\n\nDecrypt the message using the Hill cipher and find the original plaintext message. (Note: Assume letters are represented by their numerical positions in the alphabet, i.e. A=0, B=1, C=2, etc.)",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using the Hill cipher, we first need to find the inverse of the key matrix. The key matrix is:\n\n2 3\n1 2\n\nTo find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we use the formula:\n\n1/(ad - bc) * | d -b |\n              | -c a |\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are the elements of the matrix.\n\nIn our case, a = 2, b = 3, c = 1, and d = 2. So, ad - bc = (2 * 2) - (3 * 1) = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nSince ad - bc = 1, the inverse of the key matrix is:\n\n|  2 -3 |\n| -1  2 |\n\nNow, we need to convert the encrypted message VGOLF into numerical values using the given letter-number correspondence:\n\nV = 21, G = 6, O = 14, L = 11, F = 5\n\nWe will group the message into pairs of letters: VG, OL, and F (we will add an extra letter X = 23 to make the last pair complete: FX).\n\nNow, we multiply the inverse key matrix by each pair of letters (mod 26) to get the decrypted message:\n\nFor VG (21, 6):\n\n|  2 -3 | |21|   | 42 - 18 |   |24|   | 0|\n| -1  2 | | 6| = |-21 + 12| = | -9| ≡ |25| (mod 26)\n\nSo, the first pair of decrypted letters is AZ.\n\nFor OL (14, 11):\n\n|  2 -3 | |14|   | 28 - 33 |   |-5|   |21|\n| -1  2 | |11| = |-14 + 22| = |  8| ≡ | 8| (mod 26)\n\nSo, the second pair of decrypted letters is VH.\n\nFor FX (5, 23):\n\n|  2 -3 | | 5|   | 10 - 69 |   |-59|   |13|\n| -1  2 | |23| = |- 5 + 46| = | 41| ≡ |15| (mod 26)\n\nSo, the third pair of decrypted letters is NP.\n\nThe decrypted message is AZVHNP."
