    "message_1": "Your task is to simulate a game that involves rolling a dice with 6 sides 10,000 times, and then calculate the probability of rolling a 5 at least once in each simulation. What is the probability of rolling a 5 at least once?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of rolling a 5 at least once in 10,000 rolls, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability is the probability of an event not occurring, which in this case is the probability of not rolling a 5 in 10,000 rolls.\n\nThe probability of not rolling a 5 in a single roll is 5/6, as there are 5 other outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6). To find the probability of not rolling a 5 in 10,000 rolls, we raise the probability of not rolling a 5 in a single roll to the power of 10,000:\n\n(5/6)^10,000\n\nNow, to find the probability of rolling a 5 at least once in 10,000 rolls, we subtract the probability of not rolling a 5 in 10,000 rolls from 1:\n\nP(at least one 5) = 1 - (5/6)^10,000\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(at least one 5) ≈ 1 - 2.04 × 10^(-408)\n\nSince 2.04 × 10^(-408) is extremely close to 0, the probability of rolling a 5 at least once in 10,000 rolls is approximately:\n\nP(at least one 5) ≈ 1\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 5 at least once in 10,000 rolls is almost certain (very close to 100%)."
