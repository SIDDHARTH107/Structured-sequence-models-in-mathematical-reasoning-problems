    "message_2": "To prove that there is no continuous bijection from the closed unit ball B³ to R³, we will use the separation axioms and the Borsuk-Ulam theorem.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Borsuk-Ulam theorem:\n\nBorsuk-Ulam Theorem: Let f: S² → R² be a continuous function. Then there exists a point x ∈ S² such that f(x) = f(-x).\n\nNow, let's assume for contradiction that there exists a continuous bijection g: B³ → R³. We will show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nConsider the restriction of g to the boundary of B³, which is the sphere S². Let h: S² → R³ be the continuous function defined by h(x) = g(x) for all x ∈ S². Since g is a bijection, h is also a bijection from S² to its image h(S²) ⊆ R³.\n\nNow, let's define a new continuous function f: S² → R² as follows. For each x ∈ S², let f(x) be the orthogonal projection of h(x) onto the plane R² (i.e., the plane formed by the first two coordinates in R³). Since h is continuous and the orthogonal projection is continuous, the composition f = projection ◦ h is also continuous.\n\nBy the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, there exists a point x ∈ S² such that f(x) = f(-x). This means that the orthogonal projections of h(x) and h(-x) onto R² are the same. However, since h is a bijection, h(x) ≠ h(-x), so the only possibility is that h(x) and h(-x) have the same first two coordinates and different third coordinates.\n\nNow, consider the line segment L connecting h(x) and h(-x) in R³. Since h is a bijection, L must be entirely contained in h(S²). Moreover, since h(x) and h(-x) have the same first two coordinates, L is parallel to the third coordinate axis.\n\nRecall that R³ has the separation property T₄ (also known as normality), which means that for any two disjoint closed sets A and B, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V. Let A = L and B = {h(x), h(-x)}. Since A and B are disjoint closed subsets of h(S²), there exist disjoint open sets U and V in R³ such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\nHowever, this contradicts the continuity of h. To see why, consider the open set W = h^(-1)(U) in S². Since h is continuous, W is an open set containing x and -x. But then h(W) is an open set containing h(x) and h(-x) that is disjoint from L, which contradicts the fact that L connects h(x) and h(-x).\n\nThis contradiction shows that our assumption that there exists a continuous bijection g: B³ → R³ is false. Therefore, there is no continuous bijection from the closed unit ball B³ to R³."
