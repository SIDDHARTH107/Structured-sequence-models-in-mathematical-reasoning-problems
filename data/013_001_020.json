    "message_1": "In a Prisoner's Dilemma game, two players can either cooperate (C) or defect (D). If both players cooperate, they each receive 3 points. If one player defects and the other cooperates, the defector gets 5 points and the cooperator gets 1 point. If both players defect, they each receive 2 points. \n\nAssuming that Player 1 always defects, how many points can Player 2 expect to get if they decide to cooperate, and how many points can Player 2 expect to get if they decide to defect?",
    "message_2": "Since Player 1 always defects, we can analyze the outcomes for Player 2 based on their decision to either cooperate or defect.\n\n1. If Player 2 decides to cooperate:\nPlayer 1 defects and Player 2 cooperates, so Player 2 gets 1 point.\n\n2. If Player 2 decides to defect:\nPlayer 1 defects and Player 2 also defects, so Player 2 gets 2 points.\n\nIn conclusion, if Player 2 decides to cooperate, they can expect to get 1 point, and if they decide to defect, they can expect to get 2 points."
