    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a closed, orientable surface, the total Gauss curvature is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic (χ) of the surface:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ\n\nHere, K(x,y) = 1/a^2 is the Gaussian curvature function, and dA is the area element.\n\nTo find the total Gauss curvature, we need to first find the Euler characteristic of the surface. The Euler characteristic is given by:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces in the surface's polyhedral representation.\n\nFor a closed, orientable surface, the Euler characteristic can also be expressed in terms of its genus (g) as:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nNow, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to find the total Gauss curvature:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ = 2π(2 - 2g)\n\nSince K(x,y) = 1/a^2, we have:\n\n∫∫_S (1/a^2) dA = 2π(2 - 2g)\n\nTo find the total Gauss curvature, we need to integrate K over the entire surface area (A):\n\n(1/a^2) ∫∫_S dA = 2π(2 - 2g)\n\nNow, ∫∫_S dA is just the total surface area (A), so we have:\n\n(1/a^2) A = 2π(2 - 2g)\n\nFinally, we can solve for the total Gauss curvature:\n\nA = a^2 * 2π(2 - 2g)\n\nSo, the total Gauss curvature of the surface is a^2 * 2π(2 - 2g)."
