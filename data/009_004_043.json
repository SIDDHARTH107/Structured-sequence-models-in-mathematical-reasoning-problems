Write a differential equation that models the motion of the mass, and find the amplitude, period, and frequency of the resulting vibrations.",
    "message_2": "To model the motion of the mass attached to the spring, we can use Hooke's Law and Newton's second law of motion. Hooke's Law states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to the displacement from its equilibrium position:\n\nF = -kx\n\nwhere F is the force exerted by the spring, k is the spring constant (4 N/m), and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nNewton's second law of motion states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass times its acceleration:\n\nF = ma\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object and a is its acceleration.\n\nCombining these two equations, we get:\n\nma = -kx\n\nSince acceleration is the second derivative of displacement with respect to time, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nm(d^2x/dt^2) = -kx\n\nNow, we need to find the amplitude, period, and frequency of the resulting vibrations. To do this, we can assume a solution of the form:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, t is time, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nTaking the second derivative of x(t) with respect to time, we get:\n\nd^2x/dt^2 = -ω^2 * A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nSubstituting this into our differential equation, we get:\n\nm(-ω^2 * A * cos(ωt + φ)) = -k * A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nDividing both sides by A * cos(ωt + φ), we get:\n\n-ω^2 * m = -k\n\nSolving for ω, we find:\n\nω^2 = k/m\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe period T and frequency f of the vibrations are related to the angular frequency ω by:\n\nT = 2π/ω\nf = 1/T = ω/(2π)\n\nNow, we need to find the amplitude A and phase angle φ using the initial conditions. At t = 0, the mass is initially displaced 2 cm (0.02 m) from its equilibrium position and has an initial velocity of 8 cm/s (0.08 m/s) towards equilibrium. Using the assumed solution form:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(φ) = 0.02\nv(0) = dx/dt = -A * ω * sin(φ) = 0.08\n\nTo find A and φ, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin^2(φ) + cos^2(φ) = 1\n\nSubstituting the expressions for x(0) and v(0), we get:\n\n(0.02/A)^2 + (0.08/(A * ω))^2 = 1\n\nSince we don't have the mass of the object, we cannot find the exact values for A, ω, T, and f. However, we have found the general form of the differential equation that models the motion of the mass and the relationships between the amplitude, period, and frequency of the resulting vibrations."
