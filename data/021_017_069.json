Find the minimum value of f(x,y) and the values of x and y that minimize it, using a population size of 20, 50 iterations, and a mutation factor of 0.8.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the differential evolution algorithm, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of 20 random solutions within the given bounds (-10 ≤ x ≤ 10, -10 ≤ y ≤ 10).\n2. For each iteration, perform the following steps:\n   a. For each individual in the population, create a mutant vector by selecting three other distinct individuals from the population and applying the mutation factor (0.8) as follows: mutant = individual1 + 0.8 * (individual2 - individual3).\n   b. Perform binomial crossover between the mutant vector and the original individual to create a trial vector.\n   c. Evaluate the fitness of the trial vector (i.e., the value of f(x, y) for the trial vector) and compare it to the fitness of the original individual. If the trial vector has a better fitness, replace the original individual with the trial vector.\n3. After 50 iterations, find the individual with the best fitness in the population.\n\nHere's a Python implementation using the `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import differential_evolution\n\ndef f(x):\n    return 3*x[0] + 2*x[1] + 4*x[0]*x[1] - x[0]**3 - x[1]**3\n\nbounds = [(-10, 10), (-10, 10)]\n\nresult = differential_evolution(f, bounds, popsize=20, maxiter=50, mutation=0.8)\n\nmin_value = result.fun\nx, y = result.x\n\nprint(\"Minimum value of f(x, y):\", min_value)\nprint(\"x:\", x)\nprint(\"y:\", y)\n```\n\nPlease note that the differential evolution algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, so the results may vary slightly each time you run the code. However, the algorithm should converge to a minimum value of f(x, y) and the corresponding x and y values that minimize the function within the specified bounds and parameters."
