    "message_1": "What is the edge connectivity of a graph with 8 vertices and the following edges: {(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (1,5), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8), (5,8)}?",
    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In this case, the graph can be visualized as follows:\n\n1--2--3--4\n|\n5--6--7--8\n|\n8\n\nTo disconnect the graph, we can remove the following edges: {(1,2), (1,5)}. After removing these edges, vertices 1, 5, and 8 will be disconnected from the rest of the graph. Therefore, the edge connectivity of this graph is 2."
