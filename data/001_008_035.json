    "message_2": "To solve the inequality x + 2 > 5, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the inequality:\n\nx + 2 - 2 > 5 - 2\nx > 3\n\nNow that we have the inequality x > 3, we can graph the solution on a number line.\n\n1. Draw a number line and label it with numbers. Make sure to include the number 3.\n2. Since x > 3, we want all the numbers greater than 3. To represent this on the number line, place an open circle at 3 (because 3 is not included in the solution) and draw an arrow pointing to the right (towards the greater numbers).\n\nThe graph will look like this:\n\n---(3)----->"
