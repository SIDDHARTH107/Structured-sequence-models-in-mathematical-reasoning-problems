    "message_2": "To solve the cubic equation 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 4 = 0, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem, which states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (4 in this case) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (2 in this case).\n\nThe factors of 4 are ±1, ±2, and ±4, and the factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±1/2, and ±2/1.\n\nWe can test these possible roots by substituting them into the equation and checking if the result is 0:\n\nFor x = 1:\n2(1)^3 + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) + 4 = 2 + 5 - 3 + 4 = 8 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = -1:\n2(-1)^3 + 5(-1)^2 - 3(-1) + 4 = -2 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 10 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = 2:\n2(2)^3 + 5(2)^2 - 3(2) + 4 = 16 + 20 - 6 + 4 = 34 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = -2:\n2(-2)^3 + 5(-2)^2 - 3(-2) + 4 = -16 + 20 + 6 + 4 = 14 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = 4:\n2(4)^3 + 5(4)^2 - 3(4) + 4 = 128 + 80 - 12 + 4 = 200 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = -4:\n2(-4)^3 + 5(-4)^2 - 3(-4) + 4 = -128 + 80 + 12 + 4 = -32 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = 1/2:\n2(1/2)^3 + 5(1/2)^2 - 3(1/2) + 4 = 1/4 + 5/4 - 3/2 + 4 = 3 ≠ 0\n\nFor x = -1/2:\n2(-1/2)^3 + 5(-1/2)^2 - 3(-1/2) + 4 = -1/4 + 5/4 + 3/2 + 4 = 15/4 ≠ 0\n\nNone of the possible rational roots are actual roots of the equation. This means that the equation has no rational roots, and we would need to use numerical methods (such as the Newton-Raphson method or a computer software) to find the approximate real roots or complex roots of the equation."
