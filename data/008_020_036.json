    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations, we can write the matrix equation as a system of linear equations:\n\n$1x + 2y + 3z = 7$ (1)\n$2x - 1y + 6z = 4$ (2)\n\nWe can solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. We can eliminate $x$ by multiplying equation (1) by 2 and then subtracting equation (2) from the result:\n\n$2(1x + 2y + 3z) = 2(7)$\n$2x + 4y + 6z = 14$ (3)\n\nNow subtract equation (2) from equation (3):\n\n$(2x + 4y + 6z) - (2x - 1y + 6z) = 14 - 4$\n$5y = 10$\n\nNow we can solve for $y$:\n\n$y = \\frac{10}{5} = 2$\n\nNow that we have the value of $y$, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find the values of $x$ and $z$. Let's use equation (1):\n\n$1x + 2(2) + 3z = 7$\n$x + 4 + 3z = 7$\n$x + 3z = 3$ (4)\n\nWe still have two variables, $x$ and $z$, but only one equation. This means that we have an infinite number of solutions for this system of linear equations. We can express the solution in terms of a parameter, say $t$. Let's set $z = t$:\n\n$x + 3t = 3$\n\nNow solve for $x$:\n\n$x = 3 - 3t$\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n$x = 3 - 3t$\n$y = 2$\n$z = t$\n\nWhere $t$ is any real number."
