    "message_2": "Let G be a non-abelian group of order 27. Since the order of G is 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G is either 1 or 4. If there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, then it is normal in G, and G would be a semi-direct product of this normal subgroup and a subgroup of order 3. However, this would imply that G is abelian, which contradicts our assumption that G is non-abelian.\n\nTherefore, there must be 4 distinct 3-Sylow subgroups in G. Let P be one of these 3-Sylow subgroups. Then, by the Sylow theorems, the normalizer N_G(P) of P in G has index 4 in G. Since |G:N_G(P)| = 4, we have that |N_G(P)| = 27/4 = 6.75, which is not an integer. This is a contradiction, so our assumption that G is non-abelian must be false.\n\nThus, G must be abelian, and its center Z(G) must have order 3."
