    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The Koch curve is a fractal that is constructed by dividing a straight line segment into three equal parts and replacing the middle segment with an equilateral triangle (without the base). This process is repeated for each new segment, and the number of iterations determines the level of detail in the curve.\n\nAfter each iteration, the number of segments in the Koch curve increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is reduced to 1/3 of the previous length. Therefore, after n iterations, the total length of the curve is given by the formula:\n\nLength = (initial length) * (4^n) / (3^n)\n\nFor the Koch island, we have three Koch curves, one for each side of the equilateral triangle. So, the perimeter of the Koch island after n iterations is given by:\n\nPerimeter = 3 * Length\n\nNow, let's calculate the perimeter of the Koch island after 5 iterations with an initial segment length of 1:\n\nLength = (1) * (4^5) / (3^5) = 1024 / 243 ≈ 4.214\n\nPerimeter = 3 * Length ≈ 3 * 4.214 ≈ 12.642\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch island after 5 iterations is approximately 12.642."
