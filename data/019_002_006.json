    "message_2": "To prove the statement using predicate logic, we will use the following notation:\n\n∀x (P(x) → Q(x))\n\nwhere P(x) represents \"x is greater than 3\" and Q(x) represents \"2x is greater than 6\".\n\nNow, let's assume P(x) is true, i.e., x > 3. We need to show that Q(x) is also true, i.e., 2x > 6.\n\nIf x > 3, then multiplying both sides of the inequality by 2 (since 2 is a positive number, the inequality sign remains the same) gives:\n\n2x > 6\n\nSo, if P(x) is true, then Q(x) is also true. Therefore, the statement is true:\n\n∀x (x > 3 → 2x > 6)"
