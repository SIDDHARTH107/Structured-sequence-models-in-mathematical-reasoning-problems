    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points [1:1:0] and [1:-1:0], we can use the property of projective coordinates that any linear combination of the coordinates of two points on the line also lies on the line. Let the general point on the line be [X:Y:Z]. Then we can write:\n\nX = a(1) + b(1) = a + b\nY = a(1) + b(-1) = a - b\nZ = a(0) + b(0) = 0\n\nSince Z = 0, the line lies in the plane Z = 0. Now we need to find the third point on the line that also lies on the projective variety x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0. Since Z = 0, the equation of the variety becomes x^2 + y^2 = 0. Substituting the expressions for X and Y from the line equation, we get:\n\n(a + b)^2 + (a - b)^2 = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n2a^2 + 2b^2 = 0\n\nSince a and b cannot both be zero (otherwise, the line would degenerate to a single point), we must have a^2 + b^2 = 0. This is only possible if a = 0 and b = 0, but this contradicts the fact that the third point is distinct from the first two points.\n\nTherefore, there is no line passing through the points [1:1:0] and [1:-1:0] that intersects the projective variety x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0 at a third point distinct from those two points."
