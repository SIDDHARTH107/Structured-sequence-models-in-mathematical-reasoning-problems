    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a distance of 3 meters from the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's Law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the enclosed current (I).\n\nMathematically, this is represented as:\n\n∮ B • dl = μ₀ * I_enclosed\n\nFor a long straight wire, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. Therefore, we can simplify Ampere's Law for this case by considering a circular loop of radius r (3 meters in this case) centered on the wire.\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * I\n\nWe need to find the magnetic field B at a distance of 3 meters from the wire. The current I is given as 5 A, and the permeability of free space μ₀ is approximately 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A.\n\nB * 2π(3) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * 5 A\n\nNow, we can solve for B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A) / (2π * 3)\n\nB ≈ (2 × 10^(-7) Tm * 5) / 3\n\nB ≈ 10^(-7) T * (5/3)\n\nB ≈ 1.67 × 10^(-7) T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at a distance of 3 meters from the wire is approximately 1.67 × 10^(-7) Tesla."
