    "message_2": "a) To find the probability that a randomly selected vehicle will have a defect in its brake system, we can simply divide the number of defective vehicles by the total number of vehicles.\n\nProbability = (Number of defective vehicles) / (Total number of vehicles)\nProbability = 5 / 1000\nProbability = 0.005\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected vehicle will have a defect in its brake system is 0.005 or 0.5%.\n\nb) To find the probability that less than 10 vehicles will have a brake system defect out of 10,000 vehicles, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, defective vehicles) occurring in a fixed interval (in this case, 10,000 vehicles).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nWhere:\nP(x) is the probability of x defective vehicles\nλ (lambda) is the average number of defective vehicles (expected value)\nx is the number of defective vehicles we want to find the probability for\ne is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to 2.71828\n\nSince there are 10,000 vehicles, and the defect rate is 5 per 1000 vehicles, we can expect 50 defective vehicles on average (λ = 50).\n\nWe want to find the probability that there are less than 10 defective vehicles, so we need to find the sum of the probabilities for 0 to 9 defective vehicles:\n\nP(x < 10) = P(0) + P(1) + P(2) + ... + P(9)\n\nWe can calculate each probability using the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-50) * 50^x) / x!\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities for x = 0 to 9 and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(x < 10) ≈ 2.210e-10\n\nSo, the probability that less than 10 vehicles will have a brake system defect out of 10,000 vehicles is approximately 2.210e-10 or 2.21 * 10^(-10). This probability is extremely low, which is expected given the average defect rate of 5 per 1000 vehicles."
