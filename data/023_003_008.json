    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series expansion of f(x) = x on the interval -π < x < π, we need to determine the coefficients a_n and b_n for the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients. To find b_n, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x)] dx from -π to π\n\nFor f(x) = x, we have:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫[x * sin(n * x)] dx from -π to π\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nNow, applying integration by parts:\n\n∫[x * sin(n * x)] dx = (-x/n) * cos(n * x) - ∫[(-1/n) * cos(n * x)] dx\n\nIntegrating the second term:\n\n∫[(-1/n) * cos(n * x)] dx = (-1/n^2) * sin(n * x)\n\nNow, we have:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(n * x) - (-1/n^2) * sin(n * x)] from -π to π\n\nEvaluating the integral:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [(π/n) - (-π/n)] = (2 * π) / n\n\nNow, we have the Fourier series expansion of f(x) = x:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(2 * π) / n * sin(n * x)]\n\nNow, we want to solve the partial differential equation (PDE) ∂u/∂t = ∂^2u/∂x^2 with the initial condition u(x,0) = 2x. We can use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x,t) = X(x) * T(t). Plugging this into the PDE, we get:\n\nX(x) * T'(t) = X''(x) * T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by X(x) * T(t), we get:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ^2:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ^2\nX''(x) / X(x) = -λ^2\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\nT'(t) = -λ^2 * T(t)\nX''(x) = -λ^2 * X(x)\n\nThe general solution for the first ODE is:\n\nT(t) = C * e^(-λ^2 * t)\n\nThe general solution for the second ODE is:\n\nX(x) = A * cos(λ * x) + B * sin(λ * x)\n\nNow, we have the general solution for the PDE:\n\nu(x,t) = (A * cos(λ * x) + B * sin(λ * x)) * (C * e^(-λ^2 * t))\n\nApplying the initial condition u(x,0) = 2x:\n\n2x = (A * cos(λ * x) + B * sin(λ * x)) * C\n\nSince the initial condition is an odd function, A = 0. Thus, we have:\n\n2x = B * sin(λ * x) * C\n\nNow, we can use the Fourier series expansion of 2x:\n\n2x = Σ [(2 * π) / n * sin(n * x)]\n\nComparing the coefficients, we have:\n\nB * C = (2 * π) / n\n\nNow, we can write the solution for the PDE:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [(2 * π) / n * sin(n * x) * e^(-n^2 * t)]\n\nThis is the solution to the partial differential equation ∂u/∂t = ∂^2u/∂x^2 with the initial condition u(x,0) = 2x."
