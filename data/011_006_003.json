    "message_1": "A student is going to choose 3 pens from a set of 5 pens where each pen is either red, blue or green. How many different sets of 3 pens can the student choose if they cannot have all 3 pens be the same color?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem into cases based on the number of colors in the set of 3 pens.\n\nCase 1: 3 different colors (1 red, 1 blue, 1 green)\nThere's only 1 way to choose 1 pen of each color.\n\nCase 2: 2 different colors (2 pens of one color, 1 pen of another color)\nThere are 3 possible color combinations: (2 red, 1 blue), (2 blue, 1 green), and (2 green, 1 red).\n\nFor each color combination, we need to consider the number of ways to choose the pens:\n\n- (2 red, 1 blue): If there are R red pens and B blue pens, the number of ways to choose 2 red pens is C(R, 2) and the number of ways to choose 1 blue pen is C(B, 1). So the total number of ways for this combination is C(R, 2) * C(B, 1).\n\n- (2 blue, 1 green): Similarly, if there are G green pens, the total number of ways for this combination is C(B, 2) * C(G, 1).\n\n- (2 green, 1 red): The total number of ways for this combination is C(G, 2) * C(R, 1).\n\nAdding up the ways for each color combination, we get the total number of ways for Case 2: C(R, 2) * C(B, 1) + C(B, 2) * C(G, 1) + C(G, 2) * C(R, 1).\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways for both cases. Since the cases are mutually exclusive (meaning a set of 3 pens can't belong to more than one case), we can simply add the number of ways for each case:\n\nTotal number of ways = 1 (Case 1) + [C(R, 2) * C(B, 1) + C(B, 2) * C(G, 1) + C(G, 2) * C(R, 1)] (Case 2)\n\nWe are given that there are 5 pens in total. Let's assume there are 2 red pens, 2 blue pens, and 1 green pen. Then, we can calculate the total number of ways:\n\nTotal number of ways = 1 + [C(2, 2) * C(2, 1) + C(2, 2) * C(1, 1) + C(1, 2) * C(2, 1)]\n= 1 + [1 * 2 + 1 * 1 + 0 * 2]\n= 1 + [2 + 1 + 0]\n= 4\n\nSo, the student can choose 4 different sets of 3 pens without having all 3 pens be the same color."
