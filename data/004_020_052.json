    "message_1": "A student lifts a 50-kg box from the ground to a height of 2 meters. The student applies a constant upward force of 100 newtons. Find the work done by the student, using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the student, we can use the formula for work, which is:\n\nWork = Force × Distance × cos(θ)\n\nIn this case, the force is constant (100 N) and the angle between the force and the displacement is 0 degrees (since the force is applied vertically and the box is lifted vertically). Therefore, the cosine of the angle is 1.\n\nNow, we can set up the integral to find the work done:\n\nWork = ∫(Force × Distance × cos(θ)) dDistance\n\nSince the force is constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n\nWork = Force × ∫(Distance × cos(θ)) dDistance\n\nNow, we can integrate the remaining part of the equation with respect to distance:\n\nWork = 100 N × ∫(Distance × 1) dDistance\n\nThe integral of Distance with respect to Distance is (1/2) × Distance^2. We need to evaluate this integral from 0 to 2 meters:\n\nWork = 100 N × [(1/2) × (2 m)^2 - (1/2) × (0 m)^2]\n\nWork = 100 N × [(1/2) × 4 m^2 - 0]\n\nWork = 100 N × 2 m\n\nWork = 200 J\n\nSo, the work done by the student to lift the 50-kg box to a height of 2 meters is 200 joules."
