    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node A to node D, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Initial flow: 0\n   Residual capacities: AB=10, AC=20, BC=30, BD=20, CD=10\n\n2. Augmenting path: A -> C -> D\n   Flow: 10 (minimum capacity along the path)\n   Updated flow: 10\n   Updated residual capacities: AB=10, AC=10, BC=30, BD=20, CD=0, DC=10\n\n3. Augmenting path: A -> B -> D\n   Flow: 10 (minimum capacity along the path)\n   Updated flow: 20\n   Updated residual capacities: AB=0, AC=10, BA=10, BC=30, BD=10, CD=0, DC=10\n\n4. Augmenting path: A -> C -> B -> D\n   Flow: 10 (minimum capacity along the path)\n   Updated flow: 30\n   Updated residual capacities: AB=0, AC=0, BA=10, BC=20, BD=0, CD=0, DB=10, DC=10\n\nAt this point, there are no more augmenting paths from A to D. Therefore, the maximum flow that can be sent from node A to node D is 30."
