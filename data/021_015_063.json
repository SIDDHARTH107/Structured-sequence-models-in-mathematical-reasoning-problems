    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It is a heuristic optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling.\n\nHere's a simple implementation of PSO to find the minimum value of the given function f(x) in the range [0, 10]:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n   - Number of particles: N = 30\n   - Number of iterations: T = 100\n   - Inertia weight: w = 0.7\n   - Acceleration constants: c1 = 2, c2 = 2\n   - Initialize particles' positions and velocities randomly in the range [0, 10]\n\n2. For each iteration t = 1, 2, ..., T:\n   a. For each particle i = 1, 2, ..., N:\n      - Calculate the fitness value f(x_i) for the current position x_i\n      - Update the personal best position pbest_i if f(x_i) is better than the previous pbest_i\n   b. Update the global best position gbest if a better position is found among all particles\n   c. For each particle i = 1, 2, ..., N:\n      - Update the velocity v_i using the formula:\n        v_i = w * v_i + c1 * rand() * (pbest_i - x_i) + c2 * rand() * (gbest - x_i)\n      - Update the position x_i using the formula:\n        x_i = x_i + v_i\n\n3. The global best position gbest represents the approximate minimum value of f(x) in the range [0, 10].\n\nNote that PSO is a heuristic optimization technique, and the solution may not be the exact minimum value. The quality of the solution depends on the parameters and the number of iterations. You can fine-tune these parameters to get a better approximation of the minimum value."
