    "message_2": "The dihedral group D15 has order 2 * 15 = 30. In general, the dihedral group Dn has n rotational symmetries and n reflection symmetries, for a total of 2n elements.\n\nIn the dihedral group D15, the elements of order 2 are the reflection symmetries. There are 15 reflection symmetries in D15, which are the elements of order 2.\n\nSo, there are 15 elements of order 2 in every group of order 30 that is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15."
