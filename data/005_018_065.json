    "message_2": "To find the probability of a patient surviving for at least 5 years, we can use the survival function of the exponential distribution. The survival function is given by:\n\nS(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-t/λ)\n\nwhere T is the survival time, t is the time of interest (5 years in this case), and λ is the mean survival time (3 years in this case).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nS(5) = e^(-5/3) ≈ e^(-1.67) ≈ 0.188\n\nTherefore, the probability of a patient surviving for at least 5 years is approximately 18.8%."
