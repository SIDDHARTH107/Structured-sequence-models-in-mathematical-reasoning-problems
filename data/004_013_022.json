    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 on the interval [0, 4], we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the critical points of the function by taking the first derivative and setting it equal to zero.\n2. Determine if the critical points are maximum, minimum, or neither by analyzing the second derivative.\n3. Evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval.\n\nStep 1: Find the critical points\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nSetting f'(x) to zero:\n0 = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we can factor the equation:\n0 = 3(x^2 - 4x + 3)\n0 = 3(x - 1)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nStep 2: Determine if the critical points are maximum, minimum, or neither\nTo do this, we can analyze the second derivative:\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, we can evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\nf''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6 (Since it's negative, x = 1 is a maximum)\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6 (Since it's positive, x = 3 is a minimum)\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 6(0)^2 + 9(0) + 2 = 2\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 2 = -4\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 2 = 2\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 6(4)^2 + 9(4) + 2 = -6\n\nSo, the maximum value of the function on the interval [0, 4] is -4 at x = 1, and the minimum value is -6 at x = 4."
