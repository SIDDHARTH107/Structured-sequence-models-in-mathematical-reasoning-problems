    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B (A ∆ B). The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and {3, 4}.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ {3, 4} = ({1, 2, 5, 6} ∪ {3, 4}) - ({1, 2, 5, 6} ∩ {3, 4})\n= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {}\n= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of this result with {2, 5}.\n\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ∩ {2, 5} = {2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of {A ∩ {2, 5}} and {B ∩ {2, 5}}.\n\nA ∩ {2, 5} = {2}\nB ∩ {2, 5} = {5}\n\n{A ∩ {2, 5}} ∆ {B ∩ {2, 5}} = ({2} ∪ {5}) - ({2} ∩ {5})\n= {2, 5} - {}\n= {2, 5}\n\nAs we can see, the result of the intersection of the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and {3, 4} with {2, 5} is equal to the symmetric difference of {A ∩ {2, 5}} and {B ∩ {2, 5}}, which is {2, 5}. Therefore, the statement is proven to be true."
