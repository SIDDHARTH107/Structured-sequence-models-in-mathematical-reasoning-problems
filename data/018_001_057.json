    "message_2": "Yes, it is true that the empty set {} is a subset of both set A and set B. To prove this, we will use the definition of a subset.\n\nDefinition of a subset: A set S is a subset of another set T (denoted as S ⊆ T) if every element of S is also an element of T.\n\nIn our case, the empty set {} has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A or set B. Since there are no counterexamples, we can conclude that {} is a subset of both set A and set B.\n\nFormally, we can write this as:\n\n{} ⊆ A and {} ⊆ B"
