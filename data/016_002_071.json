    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and iteratively adding smaller equilateral triangles to its sides. After each iteration, the length of each side of the snowflake is multiplied by 4/3.\n\nTo find the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after 5 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial perimeter × (4/3)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nThe initial perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 3 × 6 cm = 18 cm.\n\nAfter 5 iterations, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake will be:\n\nPerimeter = 18 × (4/3)^5\nPerimeter ≈ 18 × 2.48832\nPerimeter ≈ 44.78976 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after 5 iterations is approximately 44.79 cm."
