    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if $f(x) = x^n$, where $n$ is a constant, then $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$.\n\nFirst, we can rewrite the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ as $f(x) = x^{1/2}$.\n\nNow, applying the power rule, we get:\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}$.\n\nTo find the derivative at $x=1$, we plug in $x=1$ into the derivative:\n\n$f'(1) = \\frac{1}{2}(1)^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}(1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSo, the derivative of $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ at $x=1$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$."
