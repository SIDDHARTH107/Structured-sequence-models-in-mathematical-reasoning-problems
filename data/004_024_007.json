    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we'll first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x using the chain rule.\n\nGiven equation: y^3 + xy - 4 = 0\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx(y^3) + d/dx(xy) - d/dx(4) = d/dx(0)\n\nFor the first term, we have:\n\nd/dx(y^3) = 3y^2 * dy/dx (using the chain rule)\n\nFor the second term, we have:\n\nd/dx(xy) = x(dy/dx) + y (using the product rule)\n\nThe third term is a constant, so its derivative is 0:\n\nd/dx(4) = 0\n\nNow, we can rewrite the differentiated equation:\n\n3y^2 * dy/dx + x(dy/dx) + y = 0\n\nNow, we want to find dy/dx at the point (2, 1). We can plug in x = 2 and y = 1 into the equation:\n\n3(1)^2 * dy/dx + 2(dy/dx) + 1 = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n3(dy/dx) + 2(dy/dx) + 1 = 0\n\nCombining the dy/dx terms:\n\n5(dy/dx) = -1\n\nNow, we can solve for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = -1/5\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x at the point (2, 1) is -1/5."
