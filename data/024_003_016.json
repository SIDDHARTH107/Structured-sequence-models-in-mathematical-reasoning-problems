    "message_2": "To calculate the Gaussian curvature, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to u and v.\n\nx_u = ∂x/∂u = 2u\ny_u = ∂y/∂u = 2v\nz_u = ∂z/∂u = 2u\n\nx_v = ∂x/∂v = -2v\ny_v = ∂y/∂v = 2u\nz_v = ∂z/∂v = 2v\n\nNow, let's find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = <(x_u, y_u, z_u), (x_u, y_u, z_u)> = (2u)^2 + (2v)^2 + (2u)^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\nF = <(x_u, y_u, z_u), (x_v, y_v, z_v)> = 2u(-2v) + 2v(2u) + 2u(2v) = 0\nG = <(x_v, y_v, z_v), (x_v, y_v, z_v)> = (-2v)^2 + (2u)^2 + (2v)^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form coefficients. We need to find the second partial derivatives of the parametric equations:\n\nx_uu = ∂²x/∂u² = 2\ny_uu = ∂²y/∂u² = 0\nz_uu = ∂²z/∂u² = 2\n\nx_uv = ∂²x/∂u∂v = 0\ny_uv = ∂²y/∂u∂v = 2\nz_uv = ∂²z/∂u∂v = 0\n\nx_vv = ∂²x/∂v² = -2\ny_vv = ∂²y/∂v² = 0\nz_vv = ∂²z/∂v² = 2\n\nNow, let's find the normal vector N:\n\nN = (x_u, y_u, z_u) × (x_v, y_v, z_v) = (4u^2, -4uv, 4v^2)\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = <(x_uu, y_uu, z_uu), N> = 4u^2(2) + (-4uv)(0) + 4v^2(2) = 8(u^2 + v^2)\nM = <(x_uv, y_uv, z_uv), N> = 4u^2(0) + (-4uv)(2) + 4v^2(0) = -8uv\nN = <(x_vv, y_vv, z_vv), N> = 4u^2(-2) + (-4uv)(0) + 4v^2(2) = -8(u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, let's find the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M²) / (EG - F²)\n\nK = (8(u^2 + v^2)(-8(u^2 + v^2)) - (-8uv)^2) / (4(u^2 + v^2)(4(u^2 + v^2)) - 0)\n\nAt the point (1,1), we have u = 1 and v = 1:\n\nK = (8(1 + 1)(-8(1 + 1)) - (-8(1)(1))^2) / (4(1 + 1)(4(1 + 1)) - 0)\nK = (16(-16) - 64) / (32) = (-256 - 64) / 32 = -320 / 32 = -10\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point (1,1) is -10."
