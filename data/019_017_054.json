    "message_2": "In the standard model of arithmetic, the constant symbol $0$ represents the number $0$, and the binary function symbols $+$ and $\\times$ represent the usual addition and multiplication operations, respectively.\n\nThe formula $\\varphi(x)$ is given by $\\exists y(x=y+y)$. This formula asserts that there exists a number $y$ such that $x$ is equal to the sum of $y$ and $y$. In other words, it asserts that $x$ is an even number.\n\nNow, we need to find the truth value of $\\varphi(2)$. To do this, we substitute $2$ for $x$ in the formula $\\varphi(x)$, which gives us $\\exists y(2=y+y)$. We need to determine if there exists a number $y$ such that $2$ is equal to the sum of $y$ and $y$.\n\nIn the standard model of arithmetic, we can see that $y=1$ satisfies this condition, since $2=1+1$. Therefore, there exists a number $y$ such that $2=y+y$, and the truth value of $\\varphi(2)$ is true."
