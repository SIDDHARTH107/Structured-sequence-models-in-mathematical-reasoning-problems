    "message_2": "To find the conformal map, we will use a series of transformations to map the interior of the unit circle onto the region inside the cardioid.\n\n1. First, we map the interior of the unit circle $|z| < 1$ to the upper half-plane using the MÃ¶bius transformation $w_1 = \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1}$. Note that when $z = 1$, we have $w_1 = 0$.\n\n2. Next, we map the upper half-plane to the right half-plane using the transformation $w_2 = w_1^2$. This transformation squares the angle and doubles the distance from the origin.\n\n3. Now, we map the right half-plane to the region inside the cardioid using the inverse of the Joukowsky transformation, which is given by $w_3 = w_2 + \\frac{1}{4w_2}$. This transformation maps the right half-plane to the region inside the cardioid $|z - \\frac{1}{2}| = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nPutting these transformations together, we have:\n\n$$w = w_3 = \\left(\\frac{z - 1}{z + 1}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{4\\left(\\frac{z - 1}{z + 1}\\right)^2}$$\n\nThis is the conformal map that transforms the interior of the unit circle onto the region inside the cardioid, with the point $z = 1$ being mapped to the point $w = 0$."
