    "message_1": "A guitar string is plucked and starts oscillating with a displacement function equal to:\n\nf(x) = 2sin(2πx/L) + 4sin(4πx/L) + 3sin(6πx/L)\n\nwhere L is the length of the string. Using the Fourier transform, find the frequency components of the wave propagation and their corresponding amplitudes.",
    "message_2": "The given displacement function is already in the form of a Fourier series, which is a sum of sinusoidal functions with different frequencies and amplitudes. In this case, the function is:\n\nf(x) = 2sin(2πx/L) + 4sin(4πx/L) + 3sin(6πx/L)\n\nEach term in the series represents a frequency component of the wave propagation. To find the frequency components, we can look at the arguments of the sine functions. The general form of a sinusoidal function is:\n\nsin(kx)\n\nwhere k is the wave number and is related to the frequency (f) by the relation:\n\nk = 2πf\n\nFor a string of length L, the fundamental frequency (f1) is given by:\n\nf1 = v / (2L)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the wave on the string. The higher harmonics have frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency:\n\nfn = n * f1\n\nNow, let's identify the frequency components in the given displacement function:\n\n1. The first term has a wave number of 2π/L, which corresponds to the fundamental frequency (f1). The amplitude of this component is 2.\n\n2. The second term has a wave number of 4π/L, which corresponds to the second harmonic (f2 = 2 * f1). The amplitude of this component is 4.\n\n3. The third term has a wave number of 6π/L, which corresponds to the third harmonic (f3 = 3 * f1). The amplitude of this component is 3.\n\nSo, the frequency components of the wave propagation are the fundamental frequency (f1) and its second and third harmonics (f2 and f3), with corresponding amplitudes of 2, 4, and 3, respectively."
