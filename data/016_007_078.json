    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape that is created by recursively removing cubes from an initial larger cube. At each level, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the larger cube are removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nFor a level-4 Menger sponge, this process has been applied four times. To calculate the volume and surface area, we can use the following formulas:\n\nVolume: V = a^3 * (20/27)^n\nSurface Area: S = 6 * a^2 * (8/9)^n\n\nwhere 'a' is the original cube side, 'n' is the level of the Menger sponge, V is the volume, and S is the surface area.\n\nGiven the original cube side of 27 cm and a level-4 Menger sponge:\n\nVolume: V = 27^3 * (20/27)^4\nV = 19683 * (0.296296)^4\nV ≈ 19683 * 0.008097\nV ≈ 159.432 cm^3\n\nSurface Area: S = 6 * 27^2 * (8/9)^4\nS = 6 * 729 * (0.592593)^4\nS ≈ 4374 * 0.123457\nS ≈ 539.526 cm^2\n\nSo, the volume of a level-4 Menger sponge with an original cube side of 27 cm is approximately 159.432 cm^3, and the surface area is approximately 539.526 cm^2."
