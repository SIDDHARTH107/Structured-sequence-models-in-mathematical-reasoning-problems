    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 1/x between -2π and 2π, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. The Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the coefficients are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * ∫[-2π, 2π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-2π, 2π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-2π, 2π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * ∫[-2π, 2π] (1/x) dx\n\nHowever, this integral is not convergent because the function 1/x has a singularity at x = 0. Therefore, the Fourier series for the function f(x) = 1/x between -2π and 2π does not exist."
