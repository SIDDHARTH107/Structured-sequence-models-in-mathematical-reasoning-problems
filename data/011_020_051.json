    "message_2": "To determine the maximum number of projects the company can undertake simultaneously, we need to consider the minimum number of employees required for each project. Since we don't have the specific number of employees required for each project, we can only provide a general answer.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, each project requires only 1 employee. In this case, the company can undertake all 7 projects simultaneously, as they have 20 employees available.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, each project requires all 20 employees. In this case, the company can only undertake 1 project at a time.\n\nWithout more information about the specific number of employees required for each project, we cannot provide a more accurate answer."
