    "message_1": "A farmer wants to fence off a rectangular field that borders a river. She has 800 meters of fencing and does not need to fence along the river. She wants to maximize the area of the field. What are the dimensions of the largest rectangular field she can create?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the fence parallel to the river be x meters, and the length of the fence perpendicular to the river be y meters. Since the farmer does not need to fence along the river, the total fencing used will be x + 2y = 800 meters.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for y: y = (800 - x)/2.\n\nThe area of the rectangular field is A = xy. We can substitute the expression for y from above: A = x(800 - x)/2 = 800x/2 - x^2/2 = 400x - x^2/2.\n\nTo maximize the area, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of A with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dx = 400 - x = 0\nx = 400\n\nNow we can find the value of y using the equation y = (800 - x)/2:\n\ny = (800 - 400)/2 = 400/2 = 200\n\nSo, the dimensions of the largest rectangular field the farmer can create are 400 meters parallel to the river and 200 meters perpendicular to the river."
