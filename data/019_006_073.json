    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it is not possible to write a precise numerical problem related to deontic logic since this branch of logic deals with normative concepts and moral reasoning rather than numerical calculations. Deontic logic is concerned with expressions of obligation, permission, prohibition, and other normative concepts, which are typically represented symbolically rather than numerically.",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are emphasizing the fact that deontic logic is not related to numerical problems. As a mathematician, I am here to help you with any mathematical or numerical problems you may have. If you have any questions or need assistance with a different topic, please feel free to ask."
