    "message_1": "A construction company wants to maximize their profit by choosing the optimal number of houses to build on a piece of land. Each house built on the land generates a profit of $500,000 but requires 5 laborers, while 1 acre of land requires 2 laborers. The company has a total of 20 laborers available and the land available is divided into 4 acres. How many houses should the company build to maximize their profit using mixed-integer programming?",
    "message_2": "Let's define the variables and constraints for this mixed-integer programming problem:\n\nVariables:\n- x: number of houses built\n- y: number of acres of land used\n\nObjective function:\nMaximize profit = 500,000x\n\nConstraints:\n1. Labor constraint: 5x + 2y ≤ 20 (each house requires 5 laborers, and each acre requires 2 laborers)\n2. Land constraint: y ≤ 4 (there are only 4 acres of land available)\n3. Non-negativity constraint: x, y ≥ 0 (cannot build a negative number of houses or use a negative amount of land)\n\nNow, we can solve this mixed-integer programming problem:\n\n1. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n   - 5x + 2y ≤ 20\n   - y ≤ 4\n   - x, y ≥ 0\n\n2. Identify the corner points of the feasible region:\n   - (0, 0)\n   - (0, 4)\n   - (4, 0)\n   - (2, 3)\n\n3. Evaluate the objective function at each corner point:\n   - Profit at (0, 0) = 500,000 * 0 = $0\n   - Profit at (0, 4) = 500,000 * 0 = $0\n   - Profit at (4, 0) = 500,000 * 4 = $2,000,000\n   - Profit at (2, 3) = 500,000 * 2 = $1,000,000\n\n4. Choose the corner point with the highest profit:\n   - The highest profit is $2,000,000 at point (4, 0).\n\nSo, the company should build 4 houses to maximize their profit."
