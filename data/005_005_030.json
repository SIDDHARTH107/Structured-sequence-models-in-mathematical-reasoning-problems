    "message_1": "A supermarket sells bags of apples with an average weight of 1.2 kg and a standard deviation of 0.3 kg. If a customer buys 5 bags of apples, what is the probability that the total weight of the bags is more than 6 kg?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed.\n\nIn this case, we have 5 bags of apples, each with an average weight of 1.2 kg and a standard deviation of 0.3 kg. We want to find the probability that the total weight of the bags is more than 6 kg.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean and standard deviation of the total weight of the 5 bags. \n\nMean of the total weight (μ_total) = Number of bags * Mean weight of each bag\nμ_total = 5 * 1.2 kg = 6 kg\n\nStandard deviation of the total weight (σ_total) = sqrt(Number of bags) * Standard deviation of each bag\nσ_total = sqrt(5) * 0.3 kg ≈ 0.67 kg\n\nNow, we can standardize the value we want to find the probability for (6 kg) using the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - μ_total) / σ_total\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability that the total weight is more than 6 kg, so we will use 6 kg as our X value:\n\nz = (6 kg - 6 kg) / 0.67 kg = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the total weight is more than 6 kg, which corresponds to a z-score of 0. Since the z-score is 0, this means that the total weight is exactly at the mean, and we want to find the probability that the total weight is greater than the mean.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score being less than 0 is 0.5. Since we want the probability of the total weight being more than 6 kg (z-score greater than 0), we can subtract this probability from 1:\n\nProbability (total weight > 6 kg) = 1 - Probability (total weight ≤ 6 kg)\nProbability (total weight > 6 kg) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nSo, the probability that the total weight of the 5 bags of apples is more than 6 kg is 0.5 or 50%."
