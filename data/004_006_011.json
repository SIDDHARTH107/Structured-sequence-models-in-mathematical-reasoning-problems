    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6, we first need to find its derivative f'(x). \n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 11\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting f'(x) equal to 0 and solving for x:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 12x + 11\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can either factor it or use the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring is not straightforward, so we will use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 3, b = -12, and c = 11. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (12 ± √((-12)^2 - 4(3)(11))) / (2(3))\n\nx = (12 ± √(144 - 132)) / 6\n\nx = (12 ± √12) / 6\n\nNow, we have two possible critical points:\n\nx = (12 + √12) / 6 ≈ 3.732\nx = (12 - √12) / 6 ≈ 0.268\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 are approximately x ≈ 0.268 and x ≈ 3.732."
