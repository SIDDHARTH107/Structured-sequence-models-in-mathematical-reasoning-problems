Two opposite sides are to be fenced with steel fence costing $30 per meter, while the other two opposite sides are to be fenced with a wooden fence costing $15 per meter. What is the minimum cost of fencing the plot of land?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of fencing the plot of land, we need to calculate the cost of fencing each side and then add them together.\n\nFor the two sides with steel fence (100 meters each):\nCost = Length × Price per meter\nCost = 100 meters × $30/meter\nCost = $3000 per side\n\nSince there are two sides with steel fence:\nTotal cost for steel fence = $3000 × 2 = $6000\n\nFor the other two sides with wooden fence (60 meters each):\nCost = Length × Price per meter\nCost = 60 meters × $15/meter\nCost = $900 per side\n\nSince there are two sides with wooden fence:\nTotal cost for wooden fence = $900 × 2 = $1800\n\nNow, we add the total cost for steel fence and wooden fence to find the minimum cost of fencing the plot of land:\nMinimum cost = Total cost for steel fence + Total cost for wooden fence\nMinimum cost = $6000 + $1800\nMinimum cost = $7800"
