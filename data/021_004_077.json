    "message_2": "To approximate the derivative of f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x at x = 2 using the centered finite difference method with a step size of h = 0.1, we will use the following formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2h)\n\nFirst, let's calculate f(x + h) and f(x - h) with x = 2 and h = 0.1:\n\nf(2 + 0.1) = (2.1)^3 - 2(2.1)^2 + 2.1\nf(2 + 0.1) = 9.261 - 8.82 + 2.1\nf(2 + 0.1) = 2.541\n\nf(2 - 0.1) = (1.9)^3 - 2(1.9)^2 + 1.9\nf(2 - 0.1) = 6.859 - 7.22 + 1.9\nf(2 - 0.1) = 1.539\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the centered finite difference formula:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (2.541 - 1.539) / (2 * 0.1)\nf'(2) ≈ 1.002 / 0.2\nf'(2) ≈ 5.01\n\nSo, the approximate derivative of f(x) at x = 2 using the centered finite difference method with a step size of h = 0.1 is 5.01.\n\nNow, let's estimate the error in our approximate solution. To do this, we need to find the second derivative of f(x), which will give us an upper bound on the error. The second derivative is:\n\nf''(x) = d^2/dx^2 (x^3 - 2x^2 + x)\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 4x + 1)\n\nNow, we differentiate one more time:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 4\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 6(2) - 4\nf''(2) = 8\n\nThe error in our approximation can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nError ≈ (h^2 * f''(x)) / 6\n\nPlugging in our values:\n\nError ≈ (0.1^2 * 8) / 6\nError ≈ 0.013333...\n\nSo, the estimated error in our approximate solution is approximately 0.0133."
