    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n[2  3 | 8]\n[4  6 | 16]\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to try to get the matrix in row-echelon form. We can start by dividing the first row by 2:\n\n[1  1.5 | 4]\n[4  6   | 16]\n\nNext, we will replace the second row with the second row minus 4 times the first row:\n\n[1  1.5 | 4]\n[0  0   | 0]\n\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form:\n\n[1  1.5 | 4]\n[0  0   | 0]\n\nThe second row represents the equation 0x + 0y = 0, which is always true and does not provide any information about the values of x and y. The first row represents the equation x + 1.5y = 4. Since we only have one equation with two variables, we have an infinite number of solutions. The system is dependent.\n\nTo express the solution set, we can solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 4 - 1.5y\n\nThe solution set is all pairs of (x, y) such that x = 4 - 1.5y."
