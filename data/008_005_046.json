    "message_2": "To solve the non-homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate y from the first two equations. To do this, we will add the first and second equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  (2x - y + z) + (x + y - 2z) &= 7 + 4\\\\\n  3x - z &= 11\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we will eliminate y from the second and third equations. To do this, we will subtract the second equation from the third equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  (3x + y + z) - (x + y - 2z) &= 12 - 4\\\\\n  2x + 3z &= 8\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  3x - z &= 11\\\\\n  2x + 3z &= 8\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can now eliminate x from these two equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, and then subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  (6x - 2z) - (6x + 9z) &= 22 - 24\\\\\n  -11z &= -2\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we can solve for z:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  z &= \\frac{-2}{-11}\\\\\n  z &= \\frac{2}{11}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into the equation 3x - z = 11 to find the value of x:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  3x - \\frac{2}{11} &= 11\\\\\n  3x &= 11 + \\frac{2}{11}\\\\\n  3x &= \\frac{121}{11}\\\\\n  x &= \\frac{121}{33}\n\\end{align*}\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of x and z back into the equation x + y - 2z = 4 to find the value of y:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  \\frac{121}{33} + y - 2\\left(\\frac{2}{11}\\right) &= 4\\\\\n  y - \\frac{4}{11} &= 4 - \\frac{121}{33}\\\\\n  y &= \\frac{4}{1} - \\frac{4}{11} + \\frac{121}{33}\\\\\n  y &= \\frac{44 - 4 + 121}{33}\\\\\n  y &= \\frac{161}{33}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo the solution to the non-homogeneous system of linear equations is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  x &= \\frac{121}{33}\\\\\n  y &= \\frac{161}{33}\\\\\n  z &= \\frac{2}{11}\n\\end{align*}"
