    "message_1": "Let X be a non-singular projective curve of degree 5 in P^2 over C, given by the equation Y^2Z + YZ^2 = X^3 - 4XZ^2. Let P and Q be points on X given by the homogeneous coordinates P = (0 : 1 : 0) and Q = (1 : −1 : 1), respectively. Use the Riemann–Roch formula to compute the dimension of the space of global sections of the sheaf O_X(D) at a point D on X such that the divisor D − P − Q is effective.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the space of global sections of the sheaf O_X(D) at a point D on X such that the divisor D - P - Q is effective, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem for a smooth projective curve X of genus g states:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere l(D) is the dimension of the space of global sections of the sheaf O_X(D), K is the canonical divisor, and deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D.\n\nFirst, we need to find the genus g of the curve X. Since X is a non-singular projective curve of degree 5 in P^2, we can use the genus-degree formula:\n\ng = (d - 1)(d - 2)/2,\n\nwhere d is the degree of the curve. In this case, d = 5, so:\n\ng = (5 - 1)(5 - 2)/2 = 4 * 3 / 2 = 6.\n\nNow, let's find the canonical divisor K. For a plane curve given by the equation F(x, y, z) = 0, the canonical divisor is given by:\n\nK = (d - 3)H,\n\nwhere H is the hyperplane divisor. In this case, d = 5, so:\n\nK = (5 - 3)H = 2H.\n\nNow, let's apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nl(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g.\n\nSince D - P - Q is effective, we have:\n\ndeg(D - P - Q) ≥ 0.\n\nThus, deg(D) - deg(P) - deg(Q) ≥ 0, which implies:\n\ndeg(D) ≥ deg(P) + deg(Q).\n\nSince P and Q are points on X, their degrees are both 1. Therefore:\n\ndeg(D) ≥ 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nNow, we need to compute l(K - D). Since K = 2H and deg(D) ≥ 2, we have:\n\ndeg(K - D) = deg(2H - D) = 2deg(H) - deg(D) ≤ 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nSince l(K - D) is non-negative, we have:\n\nl(K - D) = 0.\n\nNow, we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nl(D) - 0 = deg(D) + 1 - 6.\n\nSince deg(D) ≥ 2, we have:\n\nl(D) = deg(D) - 5.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the space of global sections of the sheaf O_X(D) at a point D on X such that the divisor D - P - Q is effective is given by:\n\nl(D) = deg(D) - 5, where deg(D) ≥ 2."
