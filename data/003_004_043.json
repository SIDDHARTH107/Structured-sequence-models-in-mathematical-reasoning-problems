    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(2x) = 0.5, we first need to find the angles for which the sine function equals 0.5. \n\nStep 1: Find the inverse sine of 0.5\nsin^(-1)(0.5) = 30 degrees\n\nStep 2: Find all angles between 0 and 360 degrees that have a sine value of 0.5\nSince the sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants, we have two angles:\n30 degrees (in the first quadrant) and 150 degrees (in the second quadrant).\n\nStep 3: Solve for x\nSince sin(2x) = 0.5, we have 2x = 30 degrees and 2x = 150 degrees.\n\nFor 2x = 30 degrees:\nx = 30/2\nx = 15 degrees\n\nFor 2x = 150 degrees:\nx = 150/2\nx = 75 degrees\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 15 degrees and 75 degrees."
