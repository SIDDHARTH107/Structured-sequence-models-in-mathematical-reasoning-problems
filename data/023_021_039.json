    "message_2": "To determine the frequency components of the resulting electromagnetic field, we can use the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal x(t) is given by:\n\nX(f) = ∫[x(t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt, where j is the imaginary unit, and the integration is performed over all time.\n\nIn this case, the voltage waveform V(t) = 10cos(2π(500)t) can be represented as:\n\nV(t) = 10cos(2π(500)t) = 5e^(j2π(500)t) + 5e^(-j2π(500)t)\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of V(t):\n\nV(f) = ∫[V(t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\n\nSince V(t) is composed of two exponential terms, we can find the Fourier transform of each term separately and then add them together.\n\nFor the first term:\n\nV1(f) = ∫[5e^(j2π(500)t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\nV1(f) = 5∫[e^(j2π(500 - f)t)] dt\n\nFor the second term:\n\nV2(f) = ∫[5e^(-j2π(500)t) * e^(-j2πft)] dt\nV2(f) = 5∫[e^(-j2π(500 + f)t)] dt\n\nNow, we can use the property of the Fourier transform that states that the Fourier transform of an exponential function is a Dirac delta function:\n\nV1(f) = 5πδ(f - 500)\nV2(f) = 5πδ(f + 500)\n\nFinally, we can add the two Fourier transforms together to get the overall Fourier transform of V(t):\n\nV(f) = V1(f) + V2(f)\nV(f) = 5πδ(f - 500) + 5πδ(f + 500)\n\nSo, the frequency components of the resulting electromagnetic field are at f = 500 Hz and f = -500 Hz, with amplitudes of 5π each."
