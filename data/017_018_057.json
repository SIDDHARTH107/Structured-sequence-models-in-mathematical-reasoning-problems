    "message_2": "There are 51 groups of order 32, out of which 45 are non-abelian. However, I will discuss six of them, which are the most commonly studied non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\n1. The dihedral group D32: This group consists of symmetries of a regular 16-gon, including 16 rotations and 16 reflections. It is generated by two elements, r (rotation) and s (reflection), with the relations r^16 = s^2 = 1 and sr = r^(-1)s.\n\n2. The quaternion group Q32: This group is an extension of the quaternion group of order 8. It is generated by two elements, a and b, with the relations a^16 = b^4 = 1, b^2 = a^8, and ba = a^3b.\n\n3. The semidihedral group SD32: This group is an extension of the dihedral group D16. It is generated by two elements, x and y, with the relations x^16 = y^2 = 1 and yx = x^9y.\n\n4-6. Three generalized quaternion groups QD32, QD32', and QD32'': These groups are also extensions of the quaternion group of order 8. They are generated by two elements, c and d, with the relations c^16 = d^4 = 1, d^2 = c^8, and dc = c^kd for k = 5, 7, and 9, respectively.\n\nNow let's compare these non-abelian groups with the cyclic group C32 and the dihedral group D16.\n\nC32: This is an abelian group of order 32, generated by a single element g with the relation g^32 = 1. It has a simple structure, and all its subgroups are cyclic.\n\nD16: This is a non-abelian group of order 32, consisting of symmetries of a regular 8-gon. It is generated by two elements, r (rotation) and s (reflection), with the relations r^8 = s^2 = 1 and sr = r^(-1)s. It is a subgroup of D32.\n\nThe main differences between the cyclic group C32 and the non-abelian groups mentioned above are:\n\n- C32 is abelian, while the other groups are non-abelian.\n- C32 has a simple structure with only one generator, while the other groups have more complex structures with two generators and additional relations.\n- C32 has only cyclic subgroups, while the other groups have non-cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe main differences between the dihedral group D16 and the other non-abelian groups are:\n\n- D16 is a subgroup of D32, while the other groups are not subgroups of D32.\n- D16 has a simpler structure compared to the other non-abelian groups, with only one reflection element, while the other groups have more complex structures with additional relations.\n\nIn summary, the six non-abelian groups of order 32 mentioned above have more complex structures and properties compared to the cyclic group C32 and the dihedral group D16. They are generated by two elements with additional relations, making them more challenging to study and understand."
