    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, notice that the second equation can be multiplied by 2 to match the coefficients of the first equation:\n\n2(x + 2y) = 2(5)\n2x + 4y = 10\n\nNow we have:\n\n2x + 4y = 10 (1)\n2x + 4y = 10 (2)\n\nSince both equations are the same, they represent the same line. This means that there are infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line is a solution to the system.\n\nTo express the solutions, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y in terms of x using the second equation:\n\nx + 2y = 5\n2y = 5 - x\ny = (5 - x)/2\n\nThe solutions to the system can be expressed as:\n\n(x, (5 - x)/2) for all values of x."
