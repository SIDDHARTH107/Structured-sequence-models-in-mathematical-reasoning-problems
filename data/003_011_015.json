    "message_1": "A tree is located 20 meters away from a flagpole. The angle of elevation from the top of the tree to the top of the flagpole is 30 degrees. What is the height of the flagpole to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the tree as h1, the height of the flagpole as h2, and the distance between the tree and the flagpole as d. We are given that d = 20 meters and the angle of elevation from the top of the tree to the top of the flagpole is 30 degrees. We need to find h2.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, we have:\n\ntan(30) = (h2 - h1) / d\n\nWe know that tan(30) = 1/sqrt(3), and d = 20 meters. So, we have:\n\n1/sqrt(3) = (h2 - h1) / 20\n\nNow, we need to find the height difference between the flagpole and the tree (h2 - h1):\n\n20 * (1/sqrt(3)) = h2 - h1\n20 * (1/sqrt(3)) * (sqrt(3)/sqrt(3)) = (h2 - h1) * (sqrt(3)/sqrt(3))\n20 * sqrt(3) / 3 = h2 - h1\n\nNow, we need to find the height of the flagpole (h2). Since we don't have the height of the tree (h1), we can't find the exact height of the flagpole. However, we can find the minimum height of the flagpole by assuming that the tree has a height of 0 meters. In this case, h2 = h2 - h1:\n\nh2 = 20 * sqrt(3) / 3\nh2 â‰ˆ 11.5 meters\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is at least 11.5 meters. To the nearest meter, the minimum height of the flagpole is 12 meters."
