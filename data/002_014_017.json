    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 3 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: top, bottom, left, right, front, and back.\n\nThe area of the top and bottom faces can be found by multiplying the length and width:\nArea_top/bottom = 5 cm * 3 cm = 15 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_top/bottom = 2 * 15 cm² = 30 cm²\n\nThe area of the left and right faces can be found by multiplying the height and width:\nArea_left/right = 4 cm * 3 cm = 12 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_left/right = 2 * 12 cm² = 24 cm²\n\nThe area of the front and back faces can be found by multiplying the length and height:\nArea_front/back = 5 cm * 4 cm = 20 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, we multiply by 2:\nTotal_area_front/back = 2 * 20 cm² = 40 cm²\n\nNow, we add the total areas of all the faces together:\nSurface_area = Total_area_top/bottom + Total_area_left/right + Total_area_front/back\nSurface_area = 30 cm² + 24 cm² + 40 cm² = 94 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 94 cm²."
