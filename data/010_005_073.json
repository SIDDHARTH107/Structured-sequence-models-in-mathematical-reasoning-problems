If it is, provide an explicit formula for a path that connects the point $(0,0)$ and the point $(2,0)$ inside $A$. If it is not, provide a proof of why it can't be path-connected.",
    "message_2": "We claim that the set $A$ is not path-connected. To see this, suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exists a continuous path $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to A$ such that $\\gamma(0)=(0,0)$ and $\\gamma(1)=(2,0)$. \n\nConsider the function $f:[0,1]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(t)=\\|\\gamma(t)-(1,0)\\|^2$, where $\\|\\cdot\\|$ denotes the Euclidean norm. Note that $f$ is continuous since it is a composition of continuous functions. Moreover, $f(0)=1$ and $f(1)=1$. \n\nNow, consider the set $B=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2 : \\ x^2+y^2=1\\}$. Note that $B$ is a closed subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and that $A\\cap B=\\emptyset$. Since $\\gamma$ is continuous, the preimage of $B$ under $\\gamma$, denoted by $\\gamma^{-1}(B)$, is a closed subset of $[0,1]$. \n\nWe claim that $\\gamma^{-1}(B)$ is nonempty. If it were empty, then $f(t)<1$ for all $t\\in[0,1]$. But this would contradict the fact that $f(0)=f(1)=1$. Therefore, there exists some $t_0\\in[0,1]$ such that $\\gamma(t_0)\\in B$. \n\nNow, let $t_1=\\inf\\{t\\in[0,1]:\\gamma(t)\\in B\\}$. Since $\\gamma^{-1}(B)$ is closed and nonempty, $t_1\\in\\gamma^{-1}(B)$. Thus, $\\gamma(t_1)\\in B$. \n\nWe now have a contradiction. Since $\\gamma(t_1)\\in B$, we have $\\|\\gamma(t_1)-(1,0)\\|^2=1$. But since $\\gamma(t_1)\\in A$, we also have $\\|\\gamma(t_1)-(1,0)\\|^2\\leq 1$. This implies that $\\gamma(t_1)\\in A\\cap B$, which contradicts the fact that $A\\cap B=\\emptyset$. \n\nTherefore, there cannot exist a continuous path $\\gamma$ connecting $(0,0)$ and $(2,0)$ inside $A$. Hence, $A$ is not path-connected."
