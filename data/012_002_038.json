    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nIn the given graph, we have the following connections:\n\n1. Vertices 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle, so they need 3 different colors.\n2. Vertices 2, 4, and 6 form a triangle, so they need 3 different colors.\n3. Vertices 1, 4, and 5 form a triangle, so they need 3 different colors.\n4. Vertices 3, 5, and 7 form a triangle, so they need 3 different colors.\n\nWe can assign colors as follows:\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A.\n2. Color vertex 2 with color B.\n3. Color vertex 3 with color C.\n4. Since vertex 4 is connected to vertices 1 and 2, color vertex 4 with color C.\n5. Since vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1 and 3, color vertex 5 with color B.\n6. Since vertex 6 is connected to vertices 2 and 4, color vertex 6 with color A.\n7. Since vertex 7 is connected to vertices 3 and 5, color vertex 7 with color A.\n\nIn this coloring, no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Thus, the chromatic number of the given graph is 3."
