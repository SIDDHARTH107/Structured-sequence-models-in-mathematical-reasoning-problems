    "message_1": "A principal hires an agent to work for their company. The agent's effort towards the company's success cannot be directly observed by the principal. The agent decides on their effort level, which either produces a high or a low outcome for the company. The company's revenue will depend on the agent's effort and can be represented by the function R(e) = 50e - e^2, where e is the effort level. The agent's utility (or payoff) will depend on the revenue and the agent's effort level and can be represented by the function U(e) = 10e- (e - 5)^2. If the agent chooses a high effort level and the revenue is high, then the agent will receive a $50 bonus from the principal. \n\nWhat effort level should the agent choose to maximize their expected utility?",
    "message_2": "To find the effort level that maximizes the agent's expected utility, we need to find the maximum point of the utility function U(e). We can do this by taking the first derivative of the utility function with respect to e and setting it equal to zero, then solving for e.\n\nU(e) = 10e - (e - 5)^2\n\nFirst, let's expand the squared term:\n\nU(e) = 10e - (e^2 - 10e + 25)\n\nNow, simplify the equation:\n\nU(e) = 10e - e^2 + 10e - 25\nU(e) = -e^2 + 20e - 25\n\nNow, take the first derivative of U(e) with respect to e:\n\ndU(e)/de = -2e + 20\n\nSet the derivative equal to zero and solve for e:\n\n-2e + 20 = 0\n2e = 20\ne = 10\n\nNow, we need to check if this is a maximum point by taking the second derivative of U(e) with respect to e:\n\nd^2U(e)/de^2 = -2\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, this indicates that e = 10 is a maximum point for the agent's utility function. Therefore, the agent should choose an effort level of 10 to maximize their expected utility."
