    "message_2": "Using the given information, we can write the following congruences:\n\nx + 10 ≡ 0 (mod 9)\ny + 10 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can rewrite these congruences as:\n\nx ≡ -10 (mod 9)\ny ≡ -10 (mod 7)\n\nSince -10 is negative, we can find the equivalent positive congruences:\n\nx ≡ 7 (mod 9)\ny ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we will use the Chinese remainder theorem to find the smallest possible value of x + y. The Chinese remainder theorem states that if we have a system of linear congruences:\n\nx ≡ a1 (mod m1)\nx ≡ a2 (mod m2)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are coprime, then there exists a unique solution modulo m1 * m2.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\nx + y ≡ 7 + 4 (mod 9 * 7)\nx + y ≡ 11 (mod 63)\n\nSince 11 is the smallest possible value of x + y modulo 63, the smallest possible value of x + y is 11."
