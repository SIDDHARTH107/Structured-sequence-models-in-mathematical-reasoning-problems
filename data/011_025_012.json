    "message_1": "A game is played between two players who take turns removing stones from a pile. At the start of the game, there are 20 stones. Each player can remove either 1, 2, or 3 stones on their turn. The player who takes the last stone wins the game. If both players play optimally, who will win the game?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the game using backward induction, starting from the end of the game and working our way back to the beginning.\n\n1. If there is only 1, 2, or 3 stones left, the current player can take all the remaining stones and win the game.\n2. If there are 4 stones left, the current player will lose. No matter how many stones they take (1, 2, or 3), the other player can take the remaining stones and win.\n3. If there are 5, 6, or 7 stones left, the current player can win by taking 1, 2, or 3 stones, respectively, leaving 4 stones for the other player (which we know is a losing position).\n4. If there are 8 stones left, the current player will lose. No matter how many stones they take (1, 2, or 3), the other player can take enough stones to leave 4 stones for the current player, which is a losing position.\n5. If there are 9, 10, or 11 stones left, the current player can win by taking 1, 2, or 3 stones, respectively, leaving 8 stones for the other player (which we know is a losing position).\n6. If there are 12 stones left, the current player will lose. No matter how many stones they take (1, 2, or 3), the other player can take enough stones to leave 8 stones for the current player, which is a losing position.\n\nWe can see a pattern emerging: every multiple of 4 is a losing position, and every other position is a winning position. Since 20 is a multiple of 4, the first player will lose if both players play optimally."
