    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the method of least squares, we first need to create the matrix A and the vector b representing the coefficients and constants of the system, respectively:\n\nA = | 2  3 -4 |\n    | 5 -2  6 |\n    | 1  4 -3 |\n\nb = | 11.5 |\n    | 21.2 |\n    |  8.7 |\n\nNext, we need to find the normal equations, which are given by A^T * A * x = A^T * b. First, let's find the transpose of A (A^T):\n\nA^T = |  2  5  1 |\n      |  3 -2  4 |\n      | -4  6 -3 |\n\nNow, let's find the product A^T * A:\n\nA^T * A = |  2  5  1 |   |  2  3 -4 |   | 29  0  2 |\n          |  3 -2  4 | * |  5 -2  6 | = |  0 29  0 |\n          | -4  6 -3 |   |  1  4 -3 |   |  2  0 61 |\n\nNext, let's find the product A^T * b:\n\nA^T * b = |  2  5  1 |   | 11.5 |   |  95.5 |\n          |  3 -2  4 | * | 21.2 | = |  29.5 |\n          | -4  6 -3 |   |  8.7 |   |  61.5 |\n\nNow, we have the normal equations:\n\n| 29  0  2 |   | x |   |  95.5 |\n|  0 29  0 | * | y | = |  29.5 |\n|  2  0 61 |   | z |   |  61.5 |\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nx = (95.5 - 2 * z) / 29\ny = 29.5 / 29\nz = 61.5 / 61\n\nx = (95.5 - 2 * (61.5 / 61)) / 29\ny = 1\nz = 1.0082 (rounded to four decimal places for accuracy)\n\nx = (95.5 - 2 * 1.0082) / 29\nx = 3.2931 (rounded to four decimal places for accuracy)\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations using the method of least squares is:\n\nx ≈ 3.29\ny ≈ 1.00\nz ≈ 1.01"
