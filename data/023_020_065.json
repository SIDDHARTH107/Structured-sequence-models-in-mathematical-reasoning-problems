    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-2, 2] with a period of 4, we need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is even, we only need to find the a_n coefficients. The formula for the Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere L is half the period, a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor an even function, the Fourier series simplifies to:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L)]\n\nTo find the coefficients a_n, we use the following formula:\n\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L)] dx, from -L to L\n\nIn our case, f(x) = x^2, L = 2, and the interval is [-2, 2]. So, we have:\n\na_n = (1/2) * ∫[x^2 * cos(nπx/2)] dx, from -2 to 2\n\nNow, we need to compute the integral:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [∫(x^2 * cos(nπx/2) dx] from -2 to 2\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice:\n\nLet u = x^2, dv = cos(nπx/2) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)\n\nNow, we have:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [(uv)|(-2 to 2) - ∫(v du)]\n\na_n = (1/2) * [(x^2 * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2))|(-2 to 2) - ∫((2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2) * 2x dx)]\n\nNow, we apply integration by parts again:\n\nLet u = 2x, dv = sin(nπx/2) dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = -(4/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx/2)\n\nNow, we have:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [(x^2 * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2))|(-2 to 2) - (2/nπ) * ((2x * -(4/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx/2))|(-2 to 2) - ∫(-(4/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx/2) * 2 dx))]\n\na_n = (1/2) * [(x^2 * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2))|(-2 to 2) - (2/nπ) * ((2x * -(4/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx/2))|(-2 to 2) + (8/n^2π^2) * ∫(cos(nπx/2) dx))]\n\nNow, we can compute the remaining integral:\n\n∫(cos(nπx/2) dx) = (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)\n\nSo, we have:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [(x^2 * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2))|(-2 to 2) - (2/nπ) * ((2x * -(4/n^2π^2) * cos(nπx/2))|(-2 to 2) + (8/n^2π^2) * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)|(-2 to 2))]\n\nNow, we can compute the definite integrals:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [0 - 0 + 0]\n\na_n = 0\n\nSo, all the a_n coefficients are 0. The only remaining term is a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/2) * ∫[x^2] dx, from -2 to 2\n\na_0 = (1/2) * [(x^3/3)|(-2 to 2)]\n\na_0 = (1/2) * [(8/3) - (-8/3)]\n\na_0 = (1/2) * (16/3)\n\na_0 = 8/3\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-2, 2] with a period of 4:\n\nf(x) = (8/3)/2 + Σ[0 * cos(nπx/2)]\n\nf(x) = 4/3\n\nSince all the a_n coefficients are 0, the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-2, 2] with a period of 4 is a constant function f(x) = 4/3. This is due to the fact that the function x^2 is not periodic with a period of 4, and the Fourier series is trying to approximate it with a constant function."
