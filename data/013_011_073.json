    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student to solve: \n\nIn a Bertrand competition, two companies are selling identical products with a production cost of $10 per unit. Each company has to set a price for its product, and the customers will buy from the company that sells at the lowest price. The demand function for the product is P = 80 - Q, where P is the price (in dollars) and Q is the total quantity of the product demanded in the market. \n\nWhat will be the equilibrium price and quantity for the product in the market?",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition, the companies will set their prices equal to their marginal cost to maximize their profits. Since the production cost is $10 per unit, both companies will set their price at $10.\n\nNow, we need to find the equilibrium quantity. We can do this by plugging the equilibrium price into the demand function:\n\nP = 80 - Q\n10 = 80 - Q\n\nNow, solve for Q:\n\nQ = 80 - 10\nQ = 70\n\nSo, the equilibrium price for the product in the market is $10, and the equilibrium quantity is 70 units."
