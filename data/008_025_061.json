    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of elimination.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate y from the first two equations. We can do this by adding the first equation to the second equation:\n\n(2x + y - z) + (4x - y + 3z) = 7 + 2\n6x + 2z = 9\n\nNow, let's eliminate y from the second and third equations. We can do this by adding 3 times the first equation to the third equation:\n\n3(2x + y - z) + (6x + 3y - 9z) = 3(7) + 0\n12x - 6z = 21\n\nNow we have two equations with only x and z:\n\n6x + 2z = 9\n12x - 6z = 21\n\nWe can simplify the second equation by dividing by 6:\n\n2x - z = 3.5\n\nNow, let's eliminate x from these two equations. We can do this by subtracting the first equation from twice the second equation:\n\n2(2x - z) - (6x + 2z) = 2(3.5) - 9\n-2x = -2\nx = 1\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the value of z by substituting x into the equation 2x - z = 3.5:\n\n2(1) - z = 3.5\n2 - z = 3.5\nz = -1.5\n\nFinally, we can find the value of y by substituting x and z into the first equation:\n\n2x + y - z = 7\n2(1) + y - (-1.5) = 7\n2 + y + 1.5 = 7\ny = 3.5\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 3.5, and z = -1.5. There is a unique solution to this system, so it does not have no solutions."
