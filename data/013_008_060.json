    "message_1": "In a public goods game, there are 4 players who each receive 10 points at the start of the game. Each player can choose to either contribute 1 point to a shared pot or keep all 10 points to themselves. At the end of the game, the points in the pot are multiplied by 1.6 and evenly distributed among all players, regardless of whether they contributed to the pot or not. \n\nAssuming all players act rationally, what is the optimal choice for each player in order to maximize their total points at the end of the game?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the two possible choices for each player: contributing 1 point to the pot or keeping all 10 points.\n\n1. If all 4 players contribute 1 point each to the pot:\nThe pot will have 4 points. These 4 points will be multiplied by 1.6, resulting in 6.4 points. These 6.4 points will be evenly distributed among all 4 players, so each player will receive 1.6 points from the pot. Since each player contributed 1 point, they will have 9 points left. Therefore, each player will have a total of 9 + 1.6 = 10.6 points.\n\n2. If a player decides not to contribute to the pot:\nLet's assume that the other 3 players contribute 1 point each to the pot. The pot will have 3 points, which will be multiplied by 1.6, resulting in 4.8 points. These 4.8 points will be evenly distributed among all 4 players, so each player will receive 1.2 points from the pot. The player who didn't contribute will still have all 10 points, so their total will be 10 + 1.2 = 11.2 points.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that the optimal choice for each player to maximize their total points is to not contribute to the pot. However, this is a classic example of the \"free rider\" problem, where each player acting rationally and in their own self-interest leads to a suboptimal outcome for the group as a whole."
