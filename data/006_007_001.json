    "message_1": "A stock is currently trading at $100 per share. Based on historical data, there is a 60% chance that the stock price will increase by 10% in the next month and a 40% chance that the stock price will decrease by 5% in the next month. What is the probability that the stock price will be at least $105 at the end of the month?",
    "message_2": "To determine the probability that the stock price will be at least $105 at the end of the month, we need to consider the scenario where the stock price increases by 10%. \n\nSince there is a 60% chance that the stock price will increase by 10%, the probability that the stock price will be at least $105 at the end of the month is 60%."
