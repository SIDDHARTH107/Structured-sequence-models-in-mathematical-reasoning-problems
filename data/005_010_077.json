    "message_1": "A company produces smartphones, and they have found that 10% of their phones are defective. A retailer has just received a shipment of 20 smartphones from this company. Using Bayesian statistics, what is the probability that less than 3 phones in the shipment are defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of smartphones in the shipment), k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of defective phones), and p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a phone being defective, which is 10% or 0.1).\n\nWe want to find the probability that less than 3 phones in the shipment are defective, so we need to calculate the probabilities for 0, 1, and 2 defective phones and sum them up.\n\nP(X < 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the binomial coefficients (n choose k):\n\n20 choose 0 = 1\n20 choose 1 = 20\n20 choose 2 = 190\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) = (20 choose 0) * (0.1)^0 * (0.9)^20 = 1 * 1 * 0.9^20 ≈ 0.3585\nP(X = 1) = (20 choose 1) * (0.1)^1 * (0.9)^19 = 20 * 0.1 * 0.9^19 ≈ 0.3753\nP(X = 2) = (20 choose 2) * (0.1)^2 * (0.9)^18 = 190 * 0.01 * 0.9^18 ≈ 0.1887\n\nFinally, we can sum up the probabilities:\n\nP(X < 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) ≈ 0.3585 + 0.3753 + 0.1887 ≈ 0.9225\n\nSo, the probability that less than 3 phones in the shipment are defective is approximately 92.25%."
