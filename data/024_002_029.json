    "message_2": "To find the geodesic distance between points A and B on the surface of the sphere, we can use the spherical law of cosines. First, we need to convert the latitudes and longitudes to radians:\n\nLatitude A = 60°N = 60 * (π/180) = π/3 radians\nLongitude A = 45°W = -45 * (π/180) = -π/4 radians\n\nLatitude B = 30°S = -30 * (π/180) = -π/6 radians\nLongitude B = 75°E = 75 * (π/180) = 5π/12 radians\n\nNow, we can use the spherical law of cosines formula:\n\ncos(c) = cos(a) * cos(b) + sin(a) * sin(b) * cos(C)\n\nwhere c is the angular distance between points A and B, a and b are the latitudes of points A and B, and C is the difference in longitudes between points A and B.\n\nC = Longitude B - Longitude A = 5π/12 - (-π/4) = 5π/12 + π/4 = 2π/3\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\ncos(c) = cos(π/3) * cos(-π/6) + sin(π/3) * sin(-π/6) * cos(2π/3)\ncos(c) = (1/2) * (√3/2) + (√3/2) * (-1/2) * (-1/2)\ncos(c) = (√3/4) + (√3/4)\ncos(c) = √3/2\n\nNow, we can find the angular distance c:\n\nc = arccos(√3/2) ≈ 0.5236 radians\n\nFinally, we can find the geodesic distance by multiplying the angular distance by the radius of the sphere:\n\nGeodesic distance = c * radius = 0.5236 * 5 ≈ 2.618 units"
