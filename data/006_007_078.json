    "message_1": "Suppose the current stock price of XYZ company is $50 per share, and the probability of its price increasing is 0.6. What is the probability that the stock price will increase by more than $5 per share?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can't provide you with the exact probability of the stock price increasing by more than $5 per share without more information. The given probability of 0.6 only tells us the likelihood of the stock price increasing, but it doesn't provide any information about the distribution of the possible increases or the magnitude of the increase.\n\nTo determine the probability of the stock price increasing by more than $5 per share, we would need more information about the distribution of possible price increases or historical data to analyze the stock's behavior."
