    "message_1": "Consider two firms, A and B, that produce identical products and compete in a Bertrand competition. The market price is $10 per unit. The cost function for firm A is C(qA) = 4qA and the cost function for firm B is C(qB) = 2qB + 20, where qA and qB are quantities produced by firm A and B, respectively. Determine the equilibrium price and quantity for each firm.",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition, firms compete by setting prices, and consumers buy from the firm with the lowest price. If both firms set the same price, they share the market demand equally. We will first find the reaction functions for both firms, which show the optimal price each firm should set given the price set by the other firm.\n\nLet pA and pB be the prices set by firm A and firm B, respectively. The profit functions for each firm are:\n\nπA = (pA - C'(qA))qA = (pA - 4)qA\nπB = (pB - C'(qB))qB = (pB - 2)qB - 20qB\n\nIn Bertrand competition, each firm sets its price equal to its marginal cost to maximize profit:\n\npA = C'(qA) = 4\npB = C'(qB) = 2\n\nNow we need to find the equilibrium price and quantity for each firm. Since firm A has a lower marginal cost, it will set a lower price and capture the entire market. Therefore, the equilibrium price will be:\n\np* = pA = 4\n\nTo find the equilibrium quantity for each firm, we need to find the market demand. Let Q be the total market quantity demanded, and let D(p) be the market demand function. We have:\n\nQ = qA + qB\n\nSince firm A captures the entire market, qA = Q and qB = 0. The market price is given as $10 per unit, so we can write the market demand function as:\n\nD(p) = Q\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium quantity for each firm. Since the equilibrium price is 4, we have:\n\nQ = D(4)\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have enough information to determine the exact market demand function D(p) or the equilibrium quantity Q. However, we can conclude that in this Bertrand competition, the equilibrium price is $4, firm A captures the entire market, and firm B does not produce any units."
