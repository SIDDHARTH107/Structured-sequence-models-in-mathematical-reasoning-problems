    "message_2": "To show that $B$ is a base for a topology on $X$, we need to verify the following two conditions:\n\n1. The union of all elements in $B$ covers $X$.\n2. For any two elements $A_1, A_2 \\in B$, their intersection $A_1 \\cap A_2$ can be expressed as a union of elements in $B$.\n\nCondition 1:\nConsider any $x \\in X$. If $x \\in A \\in B$, then $x \\in A$. If $x \\notin A$, then $x \\in X \\setminus A$, which is finite. In either case, $x$ is covered by some element in $B$. Therefore, the union of all elements in $B$ covers $X$.\n\nCondition 2:\nLet $A_1, A_2 \\in B$. We consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: $A_1 = \\emptyset$ or $A_2 = \\emptyset$. In this case, $A_1 \\cap A_2 = \\emptyset$, which is an element of $B$.\n\nCase 2: $A_1 \\neq \\emptyset$ and $A_2 \\neq \\emptyset$. In this case, $X \\setminus A_1$ and $X \\setminus A_2$ are both finite. Then, $(X \\setminus A_1) \\cup (X \\setminus A_2)$ is also finite, and we have:\n\n$A_1 \\cap A_2 = X \\setminus ((X \\setminus A_1) \\cup (X \\setminus A_2))$\n\nSince $(X \\setminus A_1) \\cup (X \\setminus A_2)$ is finite, $A_1 \\cap A_2$ is an element of $B$.\n\nThus, both conditions are satisfied, and $B$ is a base for a topology on $X$.\n\nNow, we need to determine if this topology is metrizable or not. A topology is metrizable if there exists a metric $d: X \\times X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that the topology induced by the metric is the same as the given topology.\n\nClaim: The topology generated by $B$ is not metrizable if $X$ is infinite.\n\nProof: Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a metric $d$ that induces the topology generated by $B$. Let $x \\in X$. For each positive integer $n$, consider the open ball $B_d(x, \\frac{1}{n}) = \\{y \\in X : d(x, y) < \\frac{1}{n}\\}$. Since the topology is induced by the metric $d$, there must exist an element $A_n \\in B$ such that $x \\in A_n \\subseteq B_d(x, \\frac{1}{n})$.\n\nNow, consider the set $C = X \\setminus \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n$. Since each $A_n \\in B$, we have that $X \\setminus A_n$ is finite for each $n$. Therefore, $C$ is an infinite set. However, for any $x \\in C$, there is no element of $B$ that contains $x$ and is a subset of $B_d(x, \\frac{1}{n})$ for any $n$. This contradicts the assumption that the topology is induced by the metric $d$. Thus, the topology generated by $B$ is not metrizable if $X$ is infinite.\n\nIf $X$ is finite, then the topology generated by $B$ is the discrete topology, which is metrizable (e.g., by the discrete metric).\n\nIn conclusion, the topology generated by $B$ is metrizable if $X$ is finite and not metrizable if $X$ is infinite."
