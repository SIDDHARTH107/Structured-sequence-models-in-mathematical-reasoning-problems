    "message_2": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"PFYEBWYZ\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"KEYWORD\", we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair grid using the key.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: KEYWORD -> KEYWORD\n2. Create a 5x5 grid and fill it with the unique key letters followed by the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is combined with I in the Playfair cipher):\n\n   K E Y W O\n   R D A B C\n   F G H I L\n   M N P Q S\n   T U V X Z\n\n3. Now, we will decrypt the ciphertext by dividing it into digraphs (pairs of letters) and applying the Playfair decryption rules:\n\n   PF Y E B W Y Z\n   - - - - - - -\n   ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\n   PF -> MO (same row, shift left)\n   YE -> RE (same column, shift up)\n   B -> A (wrap around to the top row)\n   WY -> VE (same row, shift left)\n   YZ -> ME (same column, shift up)\n\n4. The decrypted plaintext message is \"MOREAME\"."
