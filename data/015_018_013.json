    "message_1": "A professor is studying the motion of a Duffing oscillator described by the equation:\n\n$\\ddot{x} + \\delta \\dot{x} + \\alpha x + \\beta x^3 = \\gamma cos(\\omega t)$\n\nwhere $\\delta=0.1$, $\\alpha=-1$, $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma=0.3$, and $\\omega=1.2$. Initially, the oscillator is at position $x=0.2$ and velocity $\\dot{x}=0.05$. \n\nWhat is the maximum displacement of the oscillator within a time interval of 100 time units?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum displacement of the Duffing oscillator within a time interval of 100 time units, we need to numerically solve the given differential equation and analyze the solution. We can rewrite the given second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\n$\\dot{x} = v$\n\n$\\dot{v} = -\\delta v - \\alpha x - \\beta x^3 + \\gamma \\cos(\\omega t)$\n\nwith initial conditions $x(0) = 0.2$ and $v(0) = 0.05$. We can use numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to solve this system of equations. After obtaining the numerical solution, we can analyze the displacement values to find the maximum displacement within the given time interval.\n\nSince this is a numerical problem, it is best solved using a computer program or software like Python, MATLAB, or Mathematica. The exact maximum displacement value will depend on the accuracy and step size of the numerical method used."
