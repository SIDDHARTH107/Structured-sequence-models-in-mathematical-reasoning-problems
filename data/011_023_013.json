    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we can use the concept of graph coloring and the chromatic number.\n\nIn a graph with 5 vertices and 7 edges, the maximum degree (the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex) is 4. This is because if a vertex has a degree of 5, it would be connected to all other vertices, but that would require a total of 10 edges (which is more than the given 7 edges).\n\nAccording to the greedy coloring algorithm, the chromatic number (minimum number of colors needed) is at most Δ + 1, where Δ is the maximum degree of the graph. In this case, Δ = 4, so the chromatic number is at most 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nHowever, we can also look for a more efficient coloring. Since the graph has 7 edges, it must have at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or more. Let's assume there is a vertex with a degree of 3 (connected to 3 other vertices). We can color this vertex with color 1. The three vertices connected to it must have different colors, so we can use colors 2, 3, and 4 for them. The remaining vertex can be connected to at most 2 of the other vertices (otherwise, it would create more than 7 edges), so it can always be colored with one of the remaining colors.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is 4."
