What is the cheapest way to transport the goods from the factories to the warehouses, assuming each factory has a limited number of goods to ship and each warehouse has a limited capacity to receive goods?\n\n|           | Warehouse 1 | Warehouse 2 | Warehouse 3 | Warehouse 4 |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Factory 1 | 12          | 4           | 5           | 8           |\n| Factory 2 | 3           | 10          | 12          | 6           |\n| Factory 3 | 8           | 6           | 9           | 5           |\n\nFactory 1 can ship up to 400 units, Factory 2 can ship up to 300 units, and Factory 3 can ship up to 500 units. Warehouse 1 can receive up to 200 units, Warehouse 2 can receive up to 400 units, Warehouse 3 can receive up to 300 units, and Warehouse 4 can receive up to 400 units.",
    "message_2": "To find the cheapest way to transport the goods, we will analyze the transportation costs and capacities of each factory and warehouse. We will start by assigning the lowest cost routes first, and then adjust as needed to meet the capacities of both factories and warehouses.\n\n1. Factory 2 to Warehouse 1: 3 dollars/unit, 200 units (min of Warehouse 1 capacity and Factory 2 capacity)\n   Remaining capacity: Factory 2 - 100 units\n\n2. Factory 1 to Warehouse 2: 4 dollars/unit, 400 units (Factory 1 capacity)\n   Remaining capacity: Warehouse 2 - 400 units\n\n3. Factory 3 to Warehouse 4: 5 dollars/unit, 400 units (Warehouse 4 capacity)\n   Remaining capacity: Factory 3 - 100 units\n\n4. Factory 2 to Warehouse 4: 6 dollars/unit, 100 units (remaining Factory 2 capacity)\n   Remaining capacity: Warehouse 4 - 300 units\n\n5. Factory 3 to Warehouse 2: 6 dollars/unit, 100 units (remaining Factory 3 capacity)\n   Remaining capacity: Warehouse 2 - 300 units\n\nNow all factories have shipped their maximum capacity, and all warehouses have received their maximum capacity.\n\nThe total cost can be calculated as follows:\n\n(200 units * 3 dollars/unit) + (400 units * 4 dollars/unit) + (400 units * 5 dollars/unit) + (100 units * 6 dollars/unit) + (100 units * 6 dollars/unit) = 600 + 1600 + 2000 + 600 + 600 = 5400 dollars.\n\nSo, the cheapest way to transport the goods from the factories to the warehouses is:\n\n- Factory 1: 400 units to Warehouse 2\n- Factory 2: 200 units to Warehouse 1, 100 units to Warehouse 4\n- Factory 3: 400 units to Warehouse 4, 100 units to Warehouse 2\n\nThe total cost for this transportation plan is 5400 dollars."
