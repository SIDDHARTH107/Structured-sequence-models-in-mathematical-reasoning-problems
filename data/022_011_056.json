    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function $f(z)$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which the numerator is equal to zero. In this case, the numerator is $z-4$. Setting it to zero, we get:\n\n$z-4=0 \\Rightarrow z=4$\n\nSo, there is a zero at $z=4$. Since it is a simple linear factor, the order of the zero is 1.\n\nNow, to find the poles of the function $f(z)$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which the denominator is equal to zero. The denominator is $z^2(z-2)$. Setting it to zero, we get:\n\n$z^2(z-2)=0$\n\nThis equation has two solutions: $z=0$ and $z=2$. \n\nFor $z=0$, the factor $z^2$ contributes to the pole, which means that the order of the pole at $z=0$ is 2 (since it is a quadratic factor).\n\nFor $z=2$, the factor $(z-2)$ contributes to the pole, which means that the order of the pole at $z=2$ is 1 (since it is a linear factor).\n\nIn summary, the function $f(z)$ has:\n\n- A zero at $z=4$ with order 1.\n- A pole at $z=0$ with order 2.\n- A pole at $z=2$ with order 1."
