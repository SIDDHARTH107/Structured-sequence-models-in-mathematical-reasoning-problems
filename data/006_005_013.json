    "message_1": "A company produces light bulbs with a certain defect rate. In a given time period, the probability of a light bulb being defective is 0.05. What is the probability of having exactly 3 defective light bulbs in a sample of 100?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective light bulbs\n- n is the total number of light bulbs in the sample (100 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective light bulbs we want to find the probability for (3 in this case)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of choosing k defective light bulbs from n total light bulbs, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of a single light bulb being defective (0.05 in this case)\n- 1-p is the probability of a single light bulb not being defective (0.95 in this case)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 3) = (100C3) * (0.05^3) * (0.95^97)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 100C3:\n\n100C3 = 100! / (3!(100-3)!) = 100! / (3!97!) = (100*99*98) / (3*2*1) = 161700\n\nNow, let's calculate (0.05^3) * (0.95^97):\n\n(0.05^3) * (0.95^97) ≈ 0.0000000121\n\nNow, multiply the two results:\n\nP(X = 3) = 161700 * 0.0000000121 ≈ 0.001957\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 3 defective light bulbs in a sample of 100 is approximately 0.001957 or 0.1957%."
