    "message_2": "First, let's find the Fourier series representation for the periodic function f(x) = x on the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π. The Fourier series representation of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nf(x) = a0/2 + Σ[an * cos(nx) + bn * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere a0, an, and bn are the Fourier coefficients, and n is an integer. The coefficients are given by:\n\na0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * 1]dx from 0 to 2π\nan = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx)]dx from 0 to 2π\nbn = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx)]dx from 0 to 2π\n\nFor f(x) = x, we have:\n\na0 = (1/π) * ∫[x]dx from 0 to 2π = (1/π) * [x^2/2] from 0 to 2π = (1/π) * (2π^2/2) = π\n\nan = (1/π) * ∫[x * cos(nx)]dx from 0 to 2π = 0 (by symmetry)\n\nbn = (1/π) * ∫[x * sin(nx)]dx from 0 to 2π = (1/π) * [(x/n) * cos(nx) - (1/n^2) * sin(nx)] from 0 to 2π = (2/n) * (-1)^n\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x is:\n\nf(x) = π/2 + Σ[(2/n) * (-1)^n * sin(nx)]\n\nNow, let's use this representation to solve the partial differential equation u_t - u_xx = 0 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π and t > 0, subject to the initial condition u(x,0) = x.\n\nThe general solution of the PDE is given by:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ[A_n * e^(-n^2*t) * cos(nx) + B_n * e^(-n^2*t) * sin(nx)]\n\nApplying the initial condition u(x,0) = x, we get:\n\nx = Σ[B_n * sin(nx)]\n\nComparing this with the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x, we can see that B_n = (2/n) * (-1)^n and A_n = 0. Therefore, the solution of the PDE is:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ[(2/n) * (-1)^n * e^(-n^2*t) * sin(nx)]\n\nThis is the solution of the partial differential equation u_t - u_xx = 0 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π and t > 0, subject to the initial condition u(x,0) = x."
