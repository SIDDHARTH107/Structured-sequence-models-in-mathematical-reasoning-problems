    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. The factory can produce a maximum of 100 units of Product A and a maximum of 150 units of Product B per day. The profit per unit of Product A and Product B is $10 and $15 respectively. The factory should produce a minimum of 60 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B to meet demand. Using the Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm, what is the maximum profit the factory can make in a day, given the constraints mentioned above?",
    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the leadership hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves in nature. It is used to find the best solution for optimization problems with multiple variables and constraints. However, the GWO algorithm is not necessary for this problem, as it can be solved using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B produced per day. The objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. x ≥ 60 (minimum 60 units of Product A)\n2. y ≥ 40 (minimum 40 units of Product B)\n3. x ≤ 100 (maximum 100 units of Product A)\n4. y ≤ 150 (maximum 150 units of Product B)\n\nSince the profit per unit of Product B is higher than Product A, to maximize the profit, the factory should produce the maximum number of Product B units, which is 150 units. After producing 150 units of Product B, the factory can produce the remaining units of Product A to meet the minimum demand, which is 60 units.\n\nSo, the maximum profit the factory can make in a day is:\n\nProfit = 10(60) + 15(150) = 600 + 2250 = $2850"
