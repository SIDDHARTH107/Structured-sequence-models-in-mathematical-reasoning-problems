    "message_1": "A ladder 10 feet long leans against a wall, and the base of the ladder is being pulled away from the wall at the rate of 3 feet per second. How fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the base of the ladder is 6 feet away from the wall?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall, and y be the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. We are given that the ladder is 10 feet long, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 10^2 = 100\n\nWe are also given that the base of the ladder is being pulled away from the wall at a rate of 3 feet per second, so dx/dt = 3 ft/s. We want to find dy/dt, the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall, when x = 6 feet.\n\nTo find dy/dt, we can differentiate the equation x^2 + y^2 = 100 with respect to time t:\n\nd(x^2 + y^2)/dt = d(100)/dt\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for dy/dt. When x = 6 feet, we can find y using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n6^2 + y^2 = 100\ny^2 = 64\ny = 8\n\nNow, we can plug in x = 6, y = 8, and dx/dt = 3 into the differentiated equation:\n\n2(6)(3) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0\n36 + 16(dy/dt) = 0\n\nSolving for dy/dt:\n\n16(dy/dt) = -36\ndy/dt = -36/16\ndy/dt = -9/4\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of 9/4 feet per second, or -9/4 ft/s (the negative sign indicates that the top of the ladder is moving downward)."
