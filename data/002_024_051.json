    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we simply add the lengths of all four sides.\n\nPerimeter = (first parallel side) + (second parallel side) + (first non-parallel side) + (second non-parallel side)\n\nPerimeter = 8 cm + 10 cm + 6 cm + 6 cm = 30 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is 30 cm."
