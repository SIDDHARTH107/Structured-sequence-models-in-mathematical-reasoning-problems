The production of P1 requires 2 units of resource A and 1 unit of resource B while the production of P2 requires 1 unit of resource A and 3 units of resource B. The factory has 30 units of resource A and 24 units of resource B available for production. The profit earned by selling one unit of P1 is $5 and the profit earned by selling one unit of P2 is $8. The factory wants to maximize its profit. \n\nUsing the Bat Algorithm, find the optimal production quantities for products P1 and P2, and the maximum profit the factory can earn.",
    "message_2": "The Bat Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the echolocation behavior of bats. However, for this problem, we can solve it using linear programming, which is more suitable and efficient for this type of problem.\n\nLet x be the number of P1 products and y be the number of P2 products. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nProfit = 5x + 8y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + y <= 30 (resource A constraint)\nx + 3y <= 24 (resource B constraint)\nx >= 0, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method or the simplex method. In this case, we will use the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we plot the constraints on a graph:\n\n2x + y <= 30\ny <= -2x + 30\n\nx + 3y <= 24\ny <= (-1/3)x + 8\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 8), (6, 6), and (15, 0).\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. (0, 0): Profit = 5(0) + 8(0) = $0\n2. (0, 8): Profit = 5(0) + 8(8) = $64\n3. (6, 6): Profit = 5(6) + 8(6) = $78\n4. (15, 0): Profit = 5(15) + 8(0) = $75\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (6, 6), with a profit of $78.\n\nTherefore, the optimal production quantities for products P1 and P2 are 6 and 6, respectively, and the maximum profit the factory can earn is $78."
