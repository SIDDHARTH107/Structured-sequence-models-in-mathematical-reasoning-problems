Then, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder.\n\nStep 1:\nDivide 252 by 144:\n252 รท 144 = 1 with a remainder of 108.\n\nStep 2:\nNow, divide the previous divisor (144) by the remainder from the previous step (108):\n144 รท 108 = 1 with a remainder of 36.\n\nStep 3:\nNow, divide the previous remainder (108) by the new remainder (36):\n108 รท 36 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we have reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 36. Therefore, the GCD of 144 and 252 is 36."
