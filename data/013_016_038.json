    "message_1": "Suppose that a restaurant is considering hiring a new chef. The expected profits of the restaurant will depend on the quality of the food that the chef produces. The restaurant can pay the chef either a low wage of $1,000 per week or a high wage of $1,500 per week. The quality of the chef's work will depend on whether he or she is lazy or diligent. If the chef is lazy, the food will have a low quality with a probability of 0.8, and a high quality with a probability of 0.2. If the chef is diligent, the food will have a high quality with a probability of 0.8, and a low quality with a probability of 0.2. The chef's laziness or diligence cannot be observed by the restaurant owner. Suppose that the owner of the restaurant is risk-neutral and seeks to maximize his expected profits. \n\nWhat wage should the restaurant owner pay the chef to maximize his expected profits given the likelihood of moral hazard?",
    "message_2": "To determine the wage that the restaurant owner should pay the chef to maximize expected profits, we need to consider the expected profits under both the low wage and high wage scenarios. Let's denote the profit from high-quality food as H and the profit from low-quality food as L.\n\n1. Low wage scenario ($1,000 per week):\nIf the chef is lazy, the expected profit is 0.8L + 0.2H - $1,000.\nIf the chef is diligent, the expected profit is 0.2L + 0.8H - $1,000.\n\n2. High wage scenario ($1,500 per week):\nIf the chef is lazy, the expected profit is 0.8L + 0.2H - $1,500.\nIf the chef is diligent, the expected profit is 0.2L + 0.8H - $1,500.\n\nNow, we need to compare the expected profits under both scenarios. The restaurant owner should choose the wage that results in the highest expected profit.\n\nLet's assume that the chef is more likely to be diligent when paid a high wage and lazy when paid a low wage. In this case, we can compare the expected profits for the diligent chef under the high wage scenario and the lazy chef under the low wage scenario:\n\nDiligent chef, high wage: 0.2L + 0.8H - $1,500\nLazy chef, low wage: 0.8L + 0.2H - $1,000\n\nTo determine which wage is better, we can compare these two expressions:\n\n0.2L + 0.8H - $1,500 > 0.8L + 0.2H - $1,000\n0.6H - 0.6L > $500\nH - L > $500/0.6\nH - L > $833.33\n\nIf the difference in profit between high-quality food (H) and low-quality food (L) is greater than $833.33, the restaurant owner should pay the high wage of $1,500 per week to maximize expected profits. If the difference is less than $833.33, the owner should pay the low wage of $1,000 per week."
