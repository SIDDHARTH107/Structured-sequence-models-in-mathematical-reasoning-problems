    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 36, we first need to analyze the possible group structures. The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2. We will use the Sylow theorems to determine the possible structures of groups of order 36.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: There are either 1 or 9 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 (2^2). If there is only 1, it is normal. If there are 9, none of them are normal.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: There are either 1 or 4 Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9 (3^2). If there is only 1, it is normal. If there are 4, none of them are normal.\n\nNow, we consider the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: Both Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups are normal. In this case, the group is a direct product of a group of order 4 and a group of order 9, which are both abelian. So, this case does not give us a non-abelian group.\n\nCase 2: Sylow 2-subgroups are normal, but Sylow 3-subgroups are not. In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of a group of order 4 and a group of order 9. There is only 1 group of order 4 (Z_4) and 2 groups of order 9 (Z_9 and Z_3 × Z_3). We have 2 possible semi-direct products for each pair, so we have a total of 2 × 2 = 4 possibilities. However, one of these possibilities is abelian, so we have 3 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 3: Sylow 3-subgroups are normal, but Sylow 2-subgroups are not. In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of a group of order 9 and a group of order 4. There are 2 groups of order 4 (Z_4 and Z_2 × Z_2). We have 2 possible semi-direct products for each pair, so we have a total of 2 × 2 = 4 possibilities. However, one of these possibilities is abelian, so we have 3 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 4: Neither Sylow 2-subgroups nor Sylow 3-subgroups are normal. In this case, we cannot form a non-abelian group of order 36.\n\nIn total, we have 3 + 3 = 6 non-abelian groups of order 36."
