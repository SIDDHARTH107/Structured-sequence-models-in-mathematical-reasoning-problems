    "message_2": "A torus T in ℝ³ defined by the equation $(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-R)^2+z^2=r^2$ with $R>r>0$ has several symmetries. We can classify these symmetries into the following categories:\n\n1. Rotational symmetries:\n   a. Rotation around the z-axis: The torus is symmetric under rotations around the z-axis by any angle θ. This is because the equation defining the torus is invariant under the transformation $(x,y,z) \\to (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta, x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta, z)$.\n   \n   b. Rotation around the central hole: The torus is also symmetric under rotations around the circle defined by the central hole. This is because the equation defining the torus is invariant under the transformation $(x,y,z) \\to (x\\cos\\phi + (\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-R)\\sin\\phi, y, (\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-R)\\cos\\phi - z\\sin\\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is the angle of rotation.\n\n2. Reflection symmetries:\n   a. Reflection through the xy-plane: The torus is symmetric under reflection through the xy-plane. This is because the equation defining the torus is invariant under the transformation $(x,y,z) \\to (x, y, -z)$.\n   \n   b. Reflection through the yz-plane: The torus is symmetric under reflection through the yz-plane. This is because the equation defining the torus is invariant under the transformation $(x,y,z) \\to (-x, y, z)$.\n   \n   c. Reflection through the xz-plane: The torus is symmetric under reflection through the xz-plane. This is because the equation defining the torus is invariant under the transformation $(x,y,z) \\to (x, -y, z)$.\n\n3. Inversion symmetry: The torus is symmetric under inversion through the center of the torus. This is because the equation defining the torus is invariant under the transformation $(x,y,z) \\to (-x, -y, -z)$.\n\nIn summary, the torus T has rotational symmetries around the z-axis and the central hole, reflection symmetries through the xy-, yz-, and xz-planes, and inversion symmetry through the center of the torus."
