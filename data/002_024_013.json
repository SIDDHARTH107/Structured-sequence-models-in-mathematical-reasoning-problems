    "message_1": "A trapezium has one base of length 5 cm, another base of length 8 cm, and two non-parallel sides each of length 6 cm. Find the perimeter of the trapezium.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we simply need to add the lengths of all four sides. Since the two non-parallel sides are each 6 cm long, we can write the equation for the perimeter as:\n\nPerimeter = Base 1 + Base 2 + Side 1 + Side 2\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nPerimeter = 5 cm + 8 cm + 6 cm + 6 cm\n\nPerimeter = 25 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the trapezium is 25 cm."
