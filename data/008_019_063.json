    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can observe that the first and second equations are multiples of each other. We can eliminate one of the variables by subtracting the second equation from the first equation.\n\n(4x + 6y - 2z) - (2x + 3y - z) = 16 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 11 (1)\n\nNow we have a new system of two equations with two variables:\n\n2x + 3y - z = 11\nx + y + 4z = -3\n\nNext, we will eliminate z from the equations. To do this, we will first solve the first equation for z:\n\nz = 2x + 3y - 11 (2)\n\nNow, substitute equation (2) into the second equation:\n\nx + y + 4(2x + 3y - 11) = -3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nx + y + 8x + 12y - 44 = -3\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n9x + 13y = 41 (3)\n\nNow we have a single equation with two variables:\n\n9x + 13y = 41\n\nTo solve for x, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = (41 - 9x) / 13 (4)\n\nNow, substitute equation (4) back into equation (1):\n\n2x + 3((41 - 9x) / 13) - z = 11\n\nMultiply both sides by 13 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n26x + 3(41 - 9x) - 13z = 143\n\nDistribute the 3:\n\n26x + 123 - 27x - 13z = 143\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-x - 13z = 20\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = 13z - 20 (5)\n\nNow we have expressions for x and y in terms of z. Substitute equation (2) into equation (5):\n\n13(2x + 3y - 11) - 20 = x\n\nSimplify:\n\n26x + 39y - 143 = x\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n25x + 39y = 143 (6)\n\nNow substitute equation (4) into equation (6):\n\n25x + 39((41 - 9x) / 13) = 143\n\nMultiply both sides by 13 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n325x + 39(41 - 9x) = 1859\n\nDistribute the 39:\n\n325x + 1599 - 351x = 1859\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-26x = 260\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = -10\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the values of y and z. Substitute the value of x into equation (4):\n\ny = (41 - 9(-10)) / 13\n\ny = (41 + 90) / 13\n\ny = 131 / 13\n\ny = 10\n\nNow, substitute the value of x into equation (5):\n\nx = 13z - 20\n\n-10 = 13z - 20\n\nAdd 20 to both sides:\n\n10 = 13z\n\nNow, solve for z:\n\nz = 10 / 13\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -10, y = 10, z = 10/13"
