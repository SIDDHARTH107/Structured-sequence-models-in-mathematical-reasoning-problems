    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n6x^2 - 18x = 6x(x - 3)\n\nDenominator:\n9x^2 - 27x = 9x(x - 3)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(6x(x - 3)) / (9x(x - 3))\n\nSince (x - 3) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out:\n\n(6x) / (9x)\n\nNow, we can simplify the remaining expression by dividing both terms by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3:\n\n(6x / 3) / (9x / 3) = (2x) / (3x)\n\nFinally, we can cancel out the common factor x:\n\n(2x) / (3x) = 2 / 3\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n2 / 3"
