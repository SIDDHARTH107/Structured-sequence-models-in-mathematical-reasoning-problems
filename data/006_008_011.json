    "message_2": "To find the probability that it will rain at least once during a three-day period, we can first find the probability that it will not rain at all during the three days and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no rain on any given day is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n\nThe probability of no rain for three consecutive days is the product of the probabilities of no rain on each day: 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.7^3 = 0.343.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one rainy day during the three-day period: 1 - 0.343 = 0.657.\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain at least once during a three-day period in this city is 0.657 or 65.7%."
