    "message_1": "A math teacher graded 20 math tests, and the average score was 85. However, he suspects one of the grades is an outlier. If the suspected outlying score is removed, the new average score is 87. What is the suspected outlying score?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the sum of all 20 test scores as S and the suspected outlying score as x. We know that the average score of the 20 tests is 85, so we can write the equation:\n\nS / 20 = 85\n\nNow, let's find the sum of all 20 test scores:\n\nS = 20 * 85 = 1700\n\nIf the suspected outlying score is removed, there are now 19 test scores left, and the new average is 87. We can write the equation:\n\n(S - x) / 19 = 87\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the remaining 19 test scores:\n\nS - x = 19 * 87 = 1653\n\nNow we can find the suspected outlying score:\n\nx = S - (S - x)\nx = 1700 - 1653\nx = 47\n\nSo, the suspected outlying score is 47."
