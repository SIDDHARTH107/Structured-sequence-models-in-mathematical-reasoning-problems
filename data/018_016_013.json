    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of the sets A and B, and B and A:\n\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B} = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nB × A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A} = {(3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these Cartesian products:\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\n(B × A) ∪ (A × B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) ∪ (B × A) and (B × A) ∪ (A × B) are equal, since they both contain the same elements. However, this does not prove that the Cartesian product is commutative with respect to union. To show that the Cartesian product is not commutative, we need to show that A × B ≠ B × A.\n\nNotice that the elements in A × B are different from the elements in B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nSince A × B ≠ B × A, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union."
