Using Fourier transform, determine the amplitude and frequency of all the spectral components of this signal. Round your answers to two decimal places.\n\n![Fourier_analysis_signal_graph](https://i.imgur.com/MLyI7EM.png)",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and frequency of the spectral components of the signal x(t) = 2cos(4πt) + sin(8πt) using the Fourier transform, we first need to express the given signal in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\nEuler's formula: e^(jθ) = cos(θ) + jsin(θ)\n\nThe given signal can be rewritten as:\n\nx(t) = 2cos(4πt) + sin(8πt)\n     = 2[cos(4πt) + jsin(4πt)]/2 + [cos(8πt) - jsin(8πt)]/j\n\nNow, we can see that the signal is represented as a sum of complex exponentials:\n\nx(t) = 2e^(j4πt)/2 + e^(j8πt)/j\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of x(t):\n\nX(ω) = ∫[x(t)e^(-jωt)]dt (from -∞ to +∞)\n\nSince x(t) is composed of two complex exponentials, we can find the Fourier transform of each term separately and then add them:\n\nX(ω) = 2/2 * ∫[e^(j4πt)e^(-jωt)]dt + 1/j * ∫[e^(j8πt)e^(-jωt)]dt\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials in each integral:\n\nX(ω) = ∫[e^(-j(ω-4π)t)]dt + 1/j * ∫[e^(-j(ω-8π)t)]dt\n\nNow, we can use the property of the delta function:\n\n∫[e^(-j(ω-ω0)t)]dt = 2πδ(ω-ω0)\n\nApplying this property to our integrals, we get:\n\nX(ω) = 2π[δ(ω-4π) + 1/j * δ(ω-8π)]\n\nNow, we can see that there are two spectral components in the signal:\n\n1. Amplitude: 2 (from the coefficient of the first term)\n   Frequency: 4π rad/s (from the argument of the delta function in the first term)\n\n2. Amplitude: 1 (from the coefficient of the second term)\n   Frequency: 8π rad/s (from the argument of the delta function in the second term)\n\nSo, the amplitude and frequency of the spectral components of the signal are:\n\n1. Amplitude: 2, Frequency: 4π rad/s (or 2 Hz)\n2. Amplitude: 1, Frequency: 8π rad/s (or 4 Hz)"
