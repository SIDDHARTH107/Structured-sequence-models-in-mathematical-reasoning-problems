    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distances between points in a space. In this case, we are considering the Euclidean space with the metric $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$. We want to find the transformations that preserve distances in this metric.\n\nThere are four types of isometries in Euclidean space that leave the metric invariant:\n\n1. Translations: A translation is a transformation that moves every point in the space by a fixed distance in a given direction. Mathematically, a translation can be represented as:\n\n$$\n(x', y', z') = (x + a, y + b, z + c)\n$$\n\nwhere $(a, b, c)$ is the translation vector.\n\n2. Rotations: A rotation is a transformation that rotates the space around an axis by a fixed angle. There are three possible axes of rotation in 3D space: the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis. A rotation around the x-axis can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ z' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos(\\theta) & -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ 0 & \\sin(\\theta) & \\cos(\\theta) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nA rotation around the y-axis can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ z' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) & 0 & \\sin(\\theta) \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\sin(\\theta) & 0 & \\cos(\\theta) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nA rotation around the z-axis can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ z' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) & -\\sin(\\theta) & 0 \\\\ \\sin(\\theta) & \\cos(\\theta) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n3. Reflections: A reflection is a transformation that reflects the space across a plane. There are three possible planes of reflection in 3D space: the xy-plane, the xz-plane, and the yz-plane. A reflection across the xy-plane can be represented as:\n\n$$\n(x', y', z') = (x, y, -z)\n$$\n\nA reflection across the xz-plane can be represented as:\n\n$$\n(x', y', z') = (x, -y, z)\n$$\n\nA reflection across the yz-plane can be represented as:\n\n$$\n(x', y', z') = (-x, y, z)\n$$\n\n4. Rotoreflections: A rotoreflection is a combination of a rotation and a reflection. It can be represented as a rotation followed by a reflection or vice versa.\n\nIn summary, the isometries that leave the metric $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$ invariant are translations, rotations, reflections, and rotoreflections."
