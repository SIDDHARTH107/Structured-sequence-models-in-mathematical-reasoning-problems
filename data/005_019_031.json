    "message_2": "To find the probability of the system being in state `S_1` after two transitions, we need to multiply the initial probability distribution `X_0` by the transition matrix `P` twice. In other words, we need to compute `X_2 = X_0 * P * P`.\n\nFirst, let's compute `X_1 = X_0 * P`:\n\n```\nX_1 = [0.6 0.4] * | 0.8 0.2 |\n                  | 0.4 0.6 |\n\nX_1 = [0.6 * 0.8 + 0.4 * 0.4, 0.6 * 0.2 + 0.4 * 0.6]\nX_1 = [0.48 + 0.16, 0.12 + 0.24]\nX_1 = [0.64, 0.36]\n```\n\nNow, let's compute `X_2 = X_1 * P`:\n\n```\nX_2 = [0.64 0.36] * | 0.8 0.2 |\n                    | 0.4 0.6 |\n\nX_2 = [0.64 * 0.8 + 0.36 * 0.4, 0.64 * 0.2 + 0.36 * 0.6]\nX_2 = [0.512 + 0.144, 0.128 + 0.216]\nX_2 = [0.656, 0.344]\n```\n\nSo, after two transitions, the probability that the system will be in state `S_1` is 0.656."
