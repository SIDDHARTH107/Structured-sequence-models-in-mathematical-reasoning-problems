    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. To find the minimum size of a vertex cover, we can use the fact that the size of a maximum matching is a lower bound for the size of a minimum vertex cover. This is due to König's theorem for bipartite graphs, and it also holds for general graphs.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph G with 7 vertices and 11 edges. The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 7 vertices is given by the formula:\n\nmax_edges = n(n-1)/2 = 7(7-1)/2 = 21\n\nSince the graph has 11 edges, it is not a complete graph, and we cannot guarantee that there is a perfect matching. However, we can try to find an upper bound for the size of a maximum matching.\n\nLet M be the size of a maximum matching in G. Since each edge in the matching is incident to two distinct vertices, there can be at most 7/2 = 3.5 edges in the matching. Since M must be an integer, we have M ≤ 3.\n\nNow, by the aforementioned relationship between the size of a maximum matching and the size of a minimum vertex cover, we know that the minimum size of a vertex cover is at least equal to the size of a maximum matching. Therefore, the minimum size of a vertex cover for G is at least 3.\n\nWithout more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact size of the minimum vertex cover. However, we can conclude that the minimum size of a vertex cover for this graph is at least 3."
