    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Vigenere cipher with the keyword \"SECURITY\", we first need to repeat the keyword to match the length of the message:\n\nMATHEMATICS\nSECURITYSE\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere cipher table to find the corresponding ciphertext letter for each letter in the message. For example, for the first letter 'M' and the corresponding keyword letter 'S', we find the intersection of the row 'M' and the column 'S' in the table, which is 'W'. We do this for each letter in the message:\n\nM (S) -> W\nA (E) -> E\nT (C) -> V\nH (U) -> Z\nE (R) -> R\nM (I) -> Z\nA (T) -> T\nT (Y) -> H\nI (S) -> S\nC (E) -> G\n\nThe resulting ciphertext is \"WEVZRZTHSG\"."
