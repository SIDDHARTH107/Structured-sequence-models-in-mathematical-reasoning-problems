    "message_2": "To find the total number of cut vertices and bridges in the graph, we need to analyze the properties of the graph.\n\nA cut vertex is a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nFirst, let's find the minimum number of edges required to form a connected graph with 8 vertices. This can be done by creating a tree with 8 vertices. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and it has exactly n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. So, for 8 vertices, the minimum number of edges required is 8 - 1 = 7 edges.\n\nNow, our graph has 10 edges, which means it has 3 more edges than the minimum required for a connected graph with 8 vertices. These extra edges can create cycles in the graph.\n\nLet's analyze the possible cases:\n\n1. The graph has a single cycle: In this case, there are no cut vertices or bridges, as removing any vertex or edge will not disconnect the graph.\n\n2. The graph has two cycles: In this case, there must be at least one cut vertex that connects the two cycles. There can be at most one bridge, as adding more than one bridge would create additional cycles.\n\n3. The graph has three cycles: In this case, there must be at least two cut vertices connecting the cycles. There can be at most two bridges, as adding more than two bridges would create additional cycles.\n\nSince we cannot have more than three cycles with 10 edges and 8 vertices, the maximum number of cut vertices is 2, and the maximum number of bridges is 2.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cut vertices and bridges in the graph is at most 4."
