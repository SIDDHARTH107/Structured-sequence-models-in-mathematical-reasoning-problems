    "message_2": "To find the poles of the meromorphic function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator of the function is equal to zero. In this case, the denominator is (z^2 + 4). So, we need to solve the equation:\n\nz^2 + 4 = 0\n\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n\nz^2 = -4\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nz = ±√(-4) = ±2i\n\nSo, the function f(z) has two poles at z = 2i and z = -2i.\n\nNow, we need to find the residues of f(z) at these poles. The residue of a meromorphic function at a simple pole z = z₀ is given by:\n\nRes(f(z), z₀) = lim (z → z₀) [(z - z₀) * f(z)]\n\nFirst, let's find the residue at z = 2i:\n\nRes(f(z), 2i) = lim (z → 2i) [(z - 2i) * (3z^2 + 2z + 4)/(z^2 + 4)]\n\nTo evaluate this limit, we can use L'Hopital's rule. Differentiating the numerator and denominator with respect to z, we get:\n\nd(3z^2 + 2z + 4)/dz = 6z + 2\nd(z^2 + 4)/dz = 2z\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limit:\n\nRes(f(z), 2i) = lim (z → 2i) [(z - 2i) * (6z + 2)/(2z)] = (6(2i) + 2)/(2(2i)) = (12i + 2)/(4i) = (3i + 1/2)\n\nSo, the residue of f(z) at z = 2i is 3i + 1/2.\n\nNext, let's find the residue at z = -2i:\n\nRes(f(z), -2i) = lim (z → -2i) [(z + 2i) * (3z^2 + 2z + 4)/(z^2 + 4)]\n\nUsing the same approach as before, we can evaluate the limit:\n\nRes(f(z), -2i) = lim (z → -2i) [(z + 2i) * (6z + 2)/(2z)] = (6(-2i) + 2)/(-4i) = (-12i + 2)/(-4i) = (-3i + 1/2)\n\nSo, the residue of f(z) at z = -2i is -3i + 1/2.\n\nIn summary, the meromorphic function f(z) has two poles at z = 2i and z = -2i, with residues 3i + 1/2 and -3i + 1/2, respectively."
