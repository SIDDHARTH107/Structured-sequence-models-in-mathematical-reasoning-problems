    "message_2": "To solve the initial value problem y' = 2x - 3y with y(0) = 5 using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the function f(x, y) = 2x - 3y\n2. Set the initial values: x0 = 0, y0 = 5, h = 0.1\n3. Apply the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method iteratively until x = 1\n\nThe fourth-order Runge-Kutta method involves the following calculations for each iteration:\n\nk1 = h * f(x, y)\nk2 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k1/2)\nk3 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k2/2)\nk4 = h * f(x + h, y + k3)\ny_new = y + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)/6\nx_new = x + h\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations:\n\nIteration 1:\nx0 = 0, y0 = 5\nk1 = 0.1 * f(0, 5) = 0.1 * (-15) = -1.5\nk2 = 0.1 * f(0.05, 4.25) = 0.1 * (-11.85) = -1.185\nk3 = 0.1 * f(0.05, 4.0925) = 0.1 * (-12.1275) = -1.21275\nk4 = 0.1 * f(0.1, 3.78725) = 0.1 * (-9.3615) = -0.93615\ny1 = 5 + (-1.5 + 2*(-1.185) + 2*(-1.21275) - 0.93615)/6 = 3.93025\nx1 = 0 + 0.1 = 0.1\n\nIteration 2:\nx1 = 0.1, y1 = 3.93025\nk1 = 0.1 * f(0.1, 3.93025) = 0.1 * (-9.69075) = -0.969075\nk2 = 0.1 * f(0.15, 3.4457125) = 0.1 * (-8.3371375) = -0.83371375\nk3 = 0.1 * f(0.15, 3.51338125) = 0.1 * (-8.54014375) = -0.854014375\nk4 = 0.1 * f(0.2, 3.076235625) = 0.1 * (-6.22847125) = -0.622847125\ny2 = 3.93025 + (-0.969075 + 2*(-0.83371375) + 2*(-0.854014375) - 0.622847125)/6 = 3.041671875\nx2 = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2\n\nContinue this process for the remaining iterations. The final values for x and y will be:\n\nx = 1.0\ny ≈ 0.073\n\nSo, the approximate solution to the initial value problem at x = 1 using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of 0.1 is y ≈ 0.073."
