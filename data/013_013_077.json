    "message_1": "Suppose there are three bidders participating in an auction for a painting. Each bidder values the painting differently: \n- Bidder 1 values the painting at $500\n- Bidder 2 values the painting at $700\n- Bidder 3 values the painting at $900\n\nThe auction is a second price auction, meaning the highest bidder wins but pays the second highest bid amount. If each bidder bids truthfully, what is the winning bid and how much does the winner pay for the painting?",
    "message_2": "In a second price auction, each bidder bids truthfully according to their valuation of the item. So, the bids will be as follows:\n\n- Bidder 1: $500\n- Bidder 2: $700\n- Bidder 3: $900\n\nThe highest bidder is Bidder 3 with a bid of $900. However, since this is a second price auction, the winner pays the second highest bid amount. The second highest bid is from Bidder 2, which is $700.\n\nTherefore, the winning bid is $900, and the winner (Bidder 3) pays $700 for the painting."
