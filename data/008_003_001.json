    "message_2": "To determine the rank of matrix A, we will perform elementary row operations to get it into its row-echelon form. \n\nMatrix A:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & 4 & 6 \\\\\n    -1 & -2 & -3 \\\\\n    3 & 6 & 9\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 1: Add half of row 1 to row 2 to eliminate the -1 in the second row.\nNew matrix:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & 4 & 6 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    3 & 6 & 9\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 2: Subtract 1.5 times row 1 from row 3 to eliminate the 3 in the third row.\nNew matrix:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & 4 & 6 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow the matrix is in row-echelon form. The rank of a matrix is the number of non-zero rows in its row-echelon form. In this case, there is only 1 non-zero row.\n\nTherefore, the rank of matrix A is 1."
