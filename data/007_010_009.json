    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies these conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let the integer be x. We have the following congruences:\n\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFirst, find the product of the moduli: N = 7 * 5 * 3 = 105.\n\nNext, compute the partial products: N1 = N/7 = 15, N2 = N/5 = 21, and N3 = N/3 = 35.\n\nNow, find the modular inverses of the partial products:\n\n15 * b1 ≡ 1 (mod 7) => b1 ≡ 1 (mod 7) (since 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\n21 * b2 ≡ 1 (mod 5) => b2 ≡ 1 (mod 5) (since 21 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\n35 * b3 ≡ 1 (mod 3) => b3 ≡ 2 (mod 3) (since 35 ≡ 1 (mod 3))\n\nNow, we can find the integer x:\n\nx = (3 * 15 * 1) + (2 * 21 * 1) + (1 * 35 * 2) = 45 + 42 + 70 = 157\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the smallest positive integer, we need to find the smallest positive integer that is congruent to x modulo N:\n\nx' = x % N = 157 % 105 = 52\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is 52."
