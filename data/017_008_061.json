    "message_2": "To determine the isomorphism class of the group G, we will analyze the given presentation and compare it to the presentations of the groups C8 (cyclic group of order 8), Q8 (quaternion group), and D4 (dihedral group of order 8).\n\nThe presentation of G is given by:\nG = <a, b | a^4 = b^2 = e, ba = a^3b>\n\nFirst, let's analyze the relations:\n1. a^4 = e, which means that a has order 4.\n2. b^2 = e, which means that b has order 2.\n3. ba = a^3b, which is a conjugation relation.\n\nNow let's compare this to the presentations of C8, Q8, and D4:\n\n1. C8: The cyclic group of order 8 has presentation <c | c^8 = e>. Since G has two generators a and b, it cannot be isomorphic to C8.\n\n2. Q8: The quaternion group has presentation <i, j | i^4 = e, i^2 = j^2, ij = -ji>. Comparing this to the presentation of G, we can see that G has a different conjugation relation (ba = a^3b instead of ij = -ji). Therefore, G is not isomorphic to Q8.\n\n3. D4: The dihedral group of order 8 has presentation <r, s | r^4 = s^2 = e, sr = r^3s>. Comparing this to the presentation of G, we can see that the relations match exactly if we map a to r and b to s. Therefore, G is isomorphic to D4.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G with presentation <a, b | a^4 = b^2 = e, ba = a^3b> is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4."
