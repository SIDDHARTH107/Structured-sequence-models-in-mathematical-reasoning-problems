Start with a Hilbert curve of order 2, which has 16 line segments.\n2. Replace each line segment in the order 2 curve with a scaled-down version of the order 2 curve itself.\n\nSince there are 16 line segments in the order 2 curve, and each segment is replaced by another order 2 curve with 16 segments, the total number of line segments in a Hilbert curve of order 3 is:\n\n16 (from order 2 curve) * 16 (segments in each scaled-down curve) = 256 line segments."
