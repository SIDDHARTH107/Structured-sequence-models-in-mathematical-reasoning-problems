    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parametrize the surface by the position vector r(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2), where u = x and v = y. Then, we compute the first derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 4uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNext, we compute the second derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 2)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = r_uu • N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nM = r_uv • N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\nN = r_vv • N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 4v^2)\n\nFinally, we compute the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (E*N + G*L - 2*F*M) / (2*(E*G - F^2))\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1. Plugging these values into the expression for H, we get:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nL = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4(1)^2 + 4(1)^2) = 1/3\nM = 1/3\nN = 1/3\n\nH = (5*1/3 + 5*1/3 - 2*4*1/3) / (2*(5*5 - 4^2)) = (10/3) / (2*9) = 5/9\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2) is H = 5/9."
