    "message_1": "Consider the curves y = x² and y = 2x - 4. Find the area between these two curves from x = 0 to x = 4.",
    "message_2": "To find the area between the two curves, we first need to find the points of intersection. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx² = 2x - 4\n\nRearrange the equation to find the roots:\n\nx² - 2x + 4 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (2 ± √((-2)² - 4(1)(4))) / 2(1)\nx = (2 ± √(4 - 16)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (4 - 16) is negative, there are no real roots for this equation, which means the curves do not intersect between x = 0 and x = 4.\n\nNow, we can find the area between the curves by integrating the difference of the two functions from x = 0 to x = 4:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - 4 - x²) dx from 0 to 4\n\nTo integrate, we find the antiderivative of the function:\n\nAntiderivative = x² - 2x²/2 - 4x\n\nNow, we can use the fundamental theorem of calculus to find the area:\n\nArea = (4² - 2(4²)/2 - 4(4)) - (0² - 2(0²)/2 - 4(0))\nArea = (16 - 16 - 16) - (0 - 0 - 0)\nArea = -16\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nArea = |-16| = 16\n\nSo, the area between the curves y = x² and y = 2x - 4 from x = 0 to x = 4 is 16 square units."
