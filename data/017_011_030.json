    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the given multiplication table and look for properties that can help us identify the group G.\n\n1. The identity element is e, as it should be in any group.\n2. Each element appears once in each row and column, so the group is closed under the operation and has unique solutions for each equation.\n3. The order of each element divides the order of the group (Lagrange's theorem). We can see that:\n   - $a^2 = e$, so the order of a is 2.\n   - $b^3 = e$, so the order of b is 3.\n   - $c^2 = e$, so the order of c is 2.\n   - $d^3 = e$, so the order of d is 3.\n   - $f^2 = e$, so the order of f is 2.\n\nNow, let's compare G with the three groups mentioned: C12, A4, and D6.\n\n1. C12: The cyclic group of order 12 has an element of order 12, but in G, the maximum order of any element is 3. Therefore, G is not isomorphic to C12.\n\n2. A4: The alternating group A4 has 12 elements and is generated by two elements of order 2 and 3. In G, we have elements of order 2 (a, c, f) and 3 (b, d). Let's check if G satisfies the relations of A4. In A4, the product of two elements of order 2 is an element of order 3. In G, we have:\n   - $ac = b$, which is of order 3.\n   - $af = d$, which is of order 3.\n   - $cf = a$, which is of order 2.\nSince G does not satisfy the relations of A4, G is not isomorphic to A4.\n\n3. D6: The dihedral group D6 has 12 elements and is generated by two elements r and s, where r has order 6, s has order 2, and $srs = r^{-1}$. In G, we don't have an element of order 6, but we can still check if G satisfies the dihedral relations with elements of order 3 and 2. Let's take b as r and a as s. Then we have:\n   - $b^3 = e$ (order of b is 3)\n   - $a^2 = e$ (order of a is 2)\n   - $aba = b^{-1}$ (since $aba = c$ and $bc = e$)\nSo, G satisfies the dihedral relations with elements of order 3 and 2. Therefore, G is isomorphic to a dihedral group with 6 reflections and 6 rotations, which is D6.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6."
