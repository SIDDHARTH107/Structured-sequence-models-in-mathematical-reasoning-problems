    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p.\n\nIn our case, we want to find the remainder when 3¹¹⁰ is divided by 7. Since 7 is a prime number, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n3^7 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we need to find a power of 3 that is close to 110 but still a multiple of 7. We can use 3^(7*15) since 7*15 = 105:\n\n(3^7)^15 ≡ 3^15 (mod 7)\n\nSince we know that 3^7 ≡ 3 (mod 7), we can substitute:\n\n3^15 ≡ 3^15 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 3¹¹⁰ is divided by 7. We can rewrite 3¹¹⁰ as 3^(105+5) = 3^105 * 3^5:\n\n3¹¹⁰ ≡ 3^105 * 3^5 (mod 7)\n\nWe already know that 3^105 ≡ 3^15 (mod 7), so we can substitute:\n\n3¹¹⁰ ≡ 3^15 * 3^5 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can calculate the remainder when 3^5 is divided by 7:\n\n3^5 = 243, and 243 % 7 = 5\n\nSo, 3¹¹⁰ ≡ 3^15 * 5 (mod 7)\n\nWe know that 3^15 ≡ 3^15 (mod 7), so we can substitute:\n\n3¹¹⁰ ≡ 3^15 * 5 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we can calculate the remainder when 3^15 is divided by 7:\n\n3^15 = 14348907, and 14348907 % 7 = 1\n\nSo, 3¹¹⁰ ≡ 1 * 5 (mod 7)\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 3¹¹⁰ is divided by 7 is 5."
