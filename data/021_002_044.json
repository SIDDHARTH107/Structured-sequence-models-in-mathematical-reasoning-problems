    "message_2": "To find the largest eigenvalue and eigenvector of matrix A using the power iteration method, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose an initial vector b0 with a non-zero norm.\n2. Perform the following steps for k = 1, 2, 3, ...\n   a. Compute the next vector: b_k = A * b_(k-1)\n   b. Normalize b_k: b_k = b_k / ||b_k||\n   c. Compute the Rayleigh quotient: λ_k = (b_k^T * A * b_k) / (b_k^T * b_k)\n3. The largest eigenvalue is approximated by λ_k, and the corresponding eigenvector is approximated by b_k.\n\nLet's choose the initial vector b0 = [1, 1]. Now, we'll compute the first three approximations:\n\nIteration 1:\nb_1 = A * b_0 = [[5, 1], [1, 3]] * [1, 1] = [6, 4]\nNormalize b_1: b_1 = [6/√(6^2 + 4^2), 4/√(6^2 + 4^2)] = [3/5, 2/5]\nλ_1 = (b_1^T * A * b_1) / (b_1^T * b_1) = ([3/5, 2/5] * [[5, 1], [1, 3]] * [3/5, 2/5]) / ([3/5, 2/5] * [3/5, 2/5]) ≈ 5.4\n\nIteration 2:\nb_2 = A * b_1 = [[5, 1], [1, 3]] * [3/5, 2/5] = [17/5, 11/5]\nNormalize b_2: b_2 = [17/(√(17^2 + 11^2)), 11/(√(17^2 + 11^2))] ≈ [0.9191, 0.3939]\nλ_2 = (b_2^T * A * b_2) / (b_2^T * b_2) ≈ 5.9615\n\nIteration 3:\nb_3 = A * b_2 ≈ [[5, 1], [1, 3]] * [0.9191, 0.3939] ≈ [4.7748, 2.0818]\nNormalize b_3: b_3 ≈ [0.9320, 0.3623]\nλ_3 = (b_3^T * A * b_3) / (b_3^T * b_3) ≈ 5.9902\n\nSo, the first three approximations for the largest eigenvalue are λ_1 ≈ 5.4, λ_2 ≈ 5.9615, and λ_3 ≈ 5.9902. The corresponding eigenvectors are b_1 ≈ [3/5, 2/5], b_2 ≈ [0.9191, 0.3939], and b_3 ≈ [0.9320, 0.3623]."
