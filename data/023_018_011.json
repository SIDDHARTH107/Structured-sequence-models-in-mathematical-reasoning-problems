    "message_2": "To determine the steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input with a frequency of 2 Hz and an amplitude of 3 units, we first need to find the Laplace transform of the input signal.\n\nThe input signal is x(t) = 3*sin(2π*2*t), where t is time in seconds. The Laplace transform of x(t) is given by:\n\nX(s) = L{3*sin(2π*2*t)} = 3*L{sin(4π*t)}\n\nUsing the Laplace transform formula for sine function, we have:\n\nL{sin(at)} = a / (s^2 + a^2)\n\nSo, X(s) = 3 * (4π) / (s^2 + (4π)^2) = 12π / (s^2 + 16π^2)\n\nNow, we can find the output signal Y(s) in the Laplace domain by multiplying the transfer function G(s) with the input signal X(s):\n\nY(s) = G(s) * X(s) = [(s+2) / (s^2 + 6s + 8)] * [12π / (s^2 + 16π^2)]\n\nTo find the steady-state response, we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s). However, before doing that, we need to simplify Y(s) by performing partial fraction decomposition.\n\nThe transfer function G(s) can be factored as:\n\nG(s) = (s+2) / ((s+2)(s+4)) = 1 / (s+4)\n\nNow, Y(s) = G(s) * X(s) = [1 / (s+4)] * [12π / (s^2 + 16π^2)]\n\nTaking the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s):\n\ny(t) = L^(-1){Y(s)} = L^(-1){[1 / (s+4)] * [12π / (s^2 + 16π^2)]}\n\nUsing the convolution theorem, we have:\n\ny(t) = 12π * L^(-1){[1 / (s+4)]} * L^(-1){[1 / (s^2 + 16π^2)]}\n\nThe inverse Laplace transforms are:\n\nL^(-1){[1 / (s+4)]} = e^(-4t)\nL^(-1){[1 / (s^2 + 16π^2)]} = (1/4π) * sin(4πt)\n\nNow, we can find the convolution:\n\ny(t) = 12π * ∫(0 to t) e^(-4τ) * (1/4π) * sin(4π(t-τ)) dτ\n\nSolving the convolution integral, we get:\n\ny(t) = (3/2) * e^(-4t) * (1 - cos(4πt))\n\nThe steady-state response is the sinusoidal part of the output signal:\n\ny_ss(t) = (3/2) * (1 - cos(4πt))\n\nThis is the steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input with a frequency of 2 Hz and an amplitude of 3 units."
