    "message_1": "A company wants to survey the satisfaction level of their customers with a new product. They randomly select 100 customers from their records and ask them to rate the product on a scale of 1 to 10. The data collected reveals that the mean satisfaction rating is 7.5 and the standard deviation is 1.2. What is the margin of error for a 95% confidence level?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the margin of error for a 95% confidence level, we will use the formula:\n\nMargin of Error = Z-score * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size)\n\nFor a 95% confidence level, the Z-score is 1.96 (based on the standard normal distribution table).\n\nGiven:\nMean satisfaction rating (µ) = 7.5\nStandard deviation (σ) = 1.2\nSample size (n) = 100\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * (1.2 / √100)\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * (1.2 / 10)\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 0.12\nMargin of Error ≈ 0.2352\n\nSo, the margin of error for a 95% confidence level is approximately 0.2352. This means that we can be 95% confident that the true mean satisfaction rating of the population lies within the range of 7.5 ± 0.2352, or between 7.2648 and 7.7352."
