    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 24 and 36, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (36) by the smaller number (24) and find the remainder.\n36 รท 24 = 1 with a remainder of 12.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (36) with the smaller number (24) and the smaller number with the remainder (12) from the previous step.\nNow, we need to find the GCD of 24 and 12.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (24) by the smaller number (12) and find the remainder.\n24 รท 12 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince there is no remainder, the GCD is the smaller number, which is 12. So, the GCD of 24 and 36 is 12."
