    "message_2": "To find the intersection number of the divisors defined by x = 0 and y = 0 on V, we first need to find the points of intersection of these divisors with the variety V.\n\nLet's first consider the equation x = 0. Substituting x = 0 into the equations defining V, we get:\n\n(0)^2 + y^2 = 1 => y^2 = 1 => y = ±1\n\nSo, the points of intersection of the divisor x = 0 with V are (0, 1) and (0, -1).\n\nNow, let's consider the equation y = 0. Substituting y = 0 into the equations defining V, we get:\n\nx^2 + (0)^2 = 1 => x^2 = 1 => x = ±1\n\nx^2 - 2x + (0)^2 - 2(0) = 0 => x(x - 2) = 0 => x = 0, 2\n\nSo, the points of intersection of the divisor y = 0 with V are (1, 0) and (-1, 0).\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection number of the divisors x = 0 and y = 0 on V. Since the divisors x = 0 and y = 0 do not intersect on V (i.e., there are no points (x, y) on V such that x = 0 and y = 0 simultaneously), the intersection number is 0."
