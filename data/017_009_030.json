    "message_2": "Since A is a cyclic group with 9 elements, it must be isomorphic to Z_9 (the integers modulo 9 under addition). Now, let's consider the possible structures of group B.\n\nSince B has 9 elements, and 9 = 3^2, the possible structures of B are determined by the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide the order of the group (9) and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible numbers of Sylow 3-subgroups are 1 and 9.\n\nIf there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it must be normal, and the group B would be a cyclic group of order 9. However, we are given that B is not isomorphic to A, so this case is not possible.\n\nIf there are 9 Sylow 3-subgroups, then B must be a non-cyclic group of order 9. The only such group is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3, which is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3 (the direct product of the integers modulo 3 under addition). \n\nSo, if B is not isomorphic to A, then the structure of B must be Z_3 × Z_3."
