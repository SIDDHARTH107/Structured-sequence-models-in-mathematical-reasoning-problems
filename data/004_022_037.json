    "message_1": "A farmer has 400 feet of fencing material to create a rectangular plot of land beside a river. If the river will act as one side of the plot, what are the dimensions of the rectangle that would provide the maximum area?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangle parallel to the river be x feet and the width perpendicular to the river be y feet. Since the river acts as one side of the plot, the farmer only needs to use the fencing material for the other three sides. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\nx + 2y = 400\n\nWe want to maximize the area A of the rectangle, which is given by:\n\nA = xy\n\nWe can solve for y in terms of x from the fencing equation:\n\ny = (400 - x) / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the area equation:\n\nA(x) = x((400 - x) / 2)\n\nA(x) = (400x - x^2) / 2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A(x) with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dx = (400 - 2x) / 2 = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2x = 400\nx = 200\n\nNow, substitute the value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (400 - 200) / 2\ny = 100\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle that would provide the maximum area are 200 feet parallel to the river and 100 feet perpendicular to the river."
