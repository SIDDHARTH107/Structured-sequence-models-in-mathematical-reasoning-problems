    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation with the given boundary conditions, we first note that the equation is Laplace's equation in polar coordinates. We can rewrite the equation in polar coordinates as:\n\n(∂²u/∂r²) + (1/r)(∂u/∂r) + (1/r²)(∂²u/∂θ²) + 3u = 0\n\nNow, we look for a solution of the form u(r, θ) = R(r)Θ(θ). Plugging this into the equation, we get:\n\n(R''(r)Θ(θ) + (1/r)R'(r)Θ(θ) + (1/r²)R(r)Θ''(θ) + 3R(r)Θ(θ)) = 0\n\nDividing by R(r)Θ(θ), we obtain:\n\n(R''(r)/R(r) + (1/r)R'(r)/R(r) + 3) + (Θ''(θ)/Θ(θ))/r² = 0\n\nSince the left side depends only on r and the right side depends only on θ, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nΘ''(θ) + λΘ(θ) = 0\nR''(r) + (1/r)R'(r) + (3 - λ/r²)R(r) = 0\n\nThe first equation is a standard linear ODE with constant coefficients. The general solution is:\n\nΘ(θ) = A*cos(√λ*θ) + B*sin(√λ*θ)\n\nThe second equation is a bit more complicated. However, we can guess a solution of the form R(r) = r^n. Plugging this into the equation, we get:\n\nn(n-1)r^(n-2) + (n-1)r^(n-2) + (3 - λ)r^(n-2) = 0\n\nThis equation holds for all r if and only if n(n-1) + n-1 + 3 - λ = 0. Solving for λ, we get λ = n² + 2n.\n\nNow, we need to satisfy the boundary conditions. We have:\n\nu(cos(θ), sin(θ)) = R(sin(θ))Θ(θ) = e^(4iθ) + e^(2iθ)\n\nComparing the coefficients of cos(nθ) and sin(nθ), we see that the only non-zero coefficients are for n = 2 and n = 4. Thus, we have:\n\nu(r, θ) = R_2(r)Θ_2(θ) + R_4(r)Θ_4(θ)\n\nwhere R_n(r) = r^n and Θ_n(θ) = A_n*cos(nθ) + B_n*sin(nθ).\n\nNow, we need to determine the coefficients A_n and B_n. We have:\n\nu(cos(θ), sin(θ)) = R_2(sin(θ))Θ_2(θ) + R_4(sin(θ))Θ_4(θ) = e^(4iθ) + e^(2iθ)\n\nComparing the coefficients of e^(inθ), we get:\n\nR_2(sin(θ))Θ_2(θ) = e^(2iθ)\nR_4(sin(θ))Θ_4(θ) = e^(4iθ)\n\nSince Θ_2(θ) = A_2*cos(2θ) + B_2*sin(2θ) and Θ_4(θ) = A_4*cos(4θ) + B_4*sin(4θ), we can see that A_2 = 0, B_2 = 1, A_4 = 1, and B_4 = 0. Thus, we have:\n\nΘ_2(θ) = sin(2θ)\nΘ_4(θ) = cos(4θ)\n\nFinally, the solution to the given partial differential equation with the given boundary conditions is:\n\nu(r, θ) = r^2*sin(2θ) + r^4*cos(4θ)"
