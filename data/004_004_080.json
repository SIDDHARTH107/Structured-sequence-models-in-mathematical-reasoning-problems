    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = 3x^2 + 4x - 5 between the limits x = 0 and x = 2, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nFirst, let's find the integral of the function:\n\nâˆ«(3x^2 + 4x - 5) dx\n\nTo integrate, we apply the power rule, which states that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1). So, we get:\n\n(3x^3)/3 + (4x^2)/2 - 5x + C\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the limits x = 0 and x = 2:\n\nF(2) - F(0) = [(2^3 + 2(2^2) - 5(2) + C) - (0^3 + 2(0^2) - 5(0) + C)]\n\nCalculating the values, we get:\n\n(8 + 8 - 10 + C) - (0 + 0 - 0 + C) = 6\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = 3x^2 + 4x - 5 between the limits x = 0 and x = 2 is 6 square units."
