    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, it touches the cube at the center of each face. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube.\n\nThe edge length of the cube is 6 cm, so the diameter of the sphere is also 6 cm. The radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, which is 3 cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is given by:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere V is the volume and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nSubstituting the radius value into the formula, we get:\n\nV = (4/3)π(3 cm)³\n\nV = (4/3)π(27 cm³)\n\nV = (4 * 27π cm³) / 3\n\nV = (108π cm³)\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is 108π cubic centimeters."
