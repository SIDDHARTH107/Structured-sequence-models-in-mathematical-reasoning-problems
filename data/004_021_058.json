    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x).\n\nThe first derivative, f'(x), is found by differentiating each term of the function with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(x^3)/dx - d(6x^2)/dx + d(9x)/dx + d(2)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation (d(x^n)/dx = n*x^(n-1)), we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative, f''(x), by differentiating f'(x) with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = d(3x^2)/dx - d(12x)/dx + d(9)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 is f''(x) = 6x - 12."
