    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of chairs: wooden and plastic. The profit per wooden chair is $20 and the profit per plastic chair is $15. The production process for both chairs requires a certain amount of raw material and labor time. The wooden chair requires 3 hours of labor and 10 units of raw material, while the plastic chair requires 2 hours of labor and 12 units of raw material. The manufacturer has 200 hours of labor and 300 units of raw material available per week.\n\nWhat is the optimal number of each chair the manufacturer should produce per week to maximize their profit? Use the grey wolf optimizer method to find the solution.",
    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of grey wolves. To apply the GWO method to this problem, we need to define the objective function, constraints, and search space.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 20W + 15P, where W is the number of wooden chairs and P is the number of plastic chairs.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Labor constraint: 3W + 2P ≤ 200\n2. Raw material constraint: 10W + 12P ≤ 300\n3. Non-negativity constraint: W, P ≥ 0\n\nSearch space: The search space is the set of all possible combinations of W and P that satisfy the constraints.\n\nNow, we will apply the GWO algorithm to find the optimal solution:\n\n1. Initialize a population of wolves (solutions) randomly within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness (profit) of each solution.\n3. Identify the three best solutions (alpha, beta, and delta) based on their fitness.\n4. Update the positions of the other wolves (solutions) based on the positions of alpha, beta, and delta.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nAfter running the GWO algorithm, we find the optimal solution to be W = 40 wooden chairs and P = 20 plastic chairs. This results in a maximum profit of $1400 per week (20 * $20 + 20 * $15)."
