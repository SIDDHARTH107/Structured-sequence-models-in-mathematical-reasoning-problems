    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the conservation of energy principle. When the first pendulum reaches its lowest point, all its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is then transferred to the second pendulum. We can set up the following equation:\n\nmgh1 = mgh2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the pendulum (which will cancel out), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), h1 is the initial height of the first pendulum, and h2 is the final height of the second pendulum.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial height (h1) of the first pendulum. We can use the following formula:\n\nh1 = L - Lcos(θ)\n\nwhere L is the length of the pendulum (1 meter) and θ is the initial angle (30 degrees).\n\nh1 = 1 - 1cos(30°)\nh1 ≈ 0.134 meters\n\nNow, let's find the final height (h2) of the second pendulum:\n\nmgh1 = mgh2\ngh1 = gh2\nh2 = h1\n\nh2 ≈ 0.134 meters\n\nNow, we can find the angle (θ2) that corresponds to this height for the second pendulum, which has a length of 1.5 meters:\n\nh2 = L - Lcos(θ2)\n\n0.134 = 1.5 - 1.5cos(θ2)\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for θ2:\n\ncos(θ2) = (1.5 - 0.134) / 1.5\ncos(θ2) ≈ 0.9107\n\nθ2 = arccos(0.9107)\nθ2 ≈ 24.6 degrees\n\nSo, the maximum angle that the second pendulum reaches is approximately 24.6 degrees."
