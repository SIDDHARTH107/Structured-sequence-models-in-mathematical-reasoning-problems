    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the true mean GPA of the entire student population using the bootstrap method with 1000 iterations, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new dataset by resampling the original dataset with replacement. This means that each time you pick a data point from the original dataset, you put it back before picking the next one. Do this 20 times to create a new dataset of the same size as the original.\n\n2. Calculate the mean GPA of the new dataset.\n\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for 1000 iterations, storing the mean GPA of each iteration.\n\n4. Sort the 1000 mean GPAs in ascending order.\n\n5. Find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the sorted mean GPAs. These percentiles represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nSince we don't have the actual dataset, we can't perform the bootstrap method directly. However, we can approximate the confidence interval using the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. In this case, the sample size is 20, which is large enough to assume normality.\n\nTo calculate the 95% confidence interval, we can use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95% confidence), σ is the standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nCI = 3.5 ± (1.96 * (0.2 / √20))\n\nCI = 3.5 ± (1.96 * (0.2 / 4.472))\n\nCI = 3.5 ± (1.96 * 0.04472)\n\nCI = 3.5 ± 0.08757\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true mean GPA of the entire student population is approximately (3.412, 3.588)."
