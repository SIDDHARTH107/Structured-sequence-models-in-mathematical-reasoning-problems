    "message_1": "A company has 15 employees who need to be assigned to 5 different teams. Each team must have exactly 3 employees. How many different ways can the company do the assignments?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We need to find the number of ways to choose 3 employees out of 15 for the first team, then 3 out of the remaining 12 for the second team, and so on.\n\nFor the first team, there are C(15,3) ways to choose 3 employees out of 15. C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items, and it is calculated as C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where ! denotes the factorial.\n\nC(15,3) = 15! / (3! * (15-3)!) = 455 ways\n\nFor the second team, there are C(12,3) ways to choose 3 employees out of the remaining 12.\n\nC(12,3) = 12! / (3! * (12-3)!) = 220 ways\n\nFor the third team, there are C(9,3) ways to choose 3 employees out of the remaining 9.\n\nC(9,3) = 9! / (3! * (9-3)!) = 84 ways\n\nFor the fourth team, there are C(6,3) ways to choose 3 employees out of the remaining 6.\n\nC(6,3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!) = 20 ways\n\nFinally, the last 3 employees will form the fifth team, so there is only 1 way to assign them.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways for each team together to find the total number of ways to assign all employees to the 5 teams:\n\nTotal ways = 455 * 220 * 84 * 20 * 1 = 16816800 ways\n\nSo, there are 16,816,800 different ways to assign the 15 employees to the 5 teams."
