    "message_1": "A student is planning a road trip across the country and has a car that can only carry a maximum weight of 500 pounds. There are five items the student wants to bring, each with a different weight: 80 lbs, 120 lbs, 200 lbs, 250 lbs, and 300 lbs. The student wants to know how many different ways he can pack their items without exceeding the car's weight limit. How many different ways can the student pack his items given a maximum weight of 500 lbs?",
    "message_2": "To find the different ways the student can pack the items without exceeding the car's weight limit, we can consider all possible combinations of the items and check if their total weight is less than or equal to 500 lbs.\n\n1. No items (0 lbs) - 1 way\n2. One item - 5 ways (80, 120, 200, 250, 300)\n3. Two items:\n   - 80 + 120 = 200 lbs\n   - 80 + 200 = 280 lbs\n   - 80 + 250 = 330 lbs\n   - 80 + 300 = 380 lbs\n   - 120 + 200 = 320 lbs\n   - 120 + 250 = 370 lbs\n   - 120 + 300 = 420 lbs\n   - 200 + 250 = 450 lbs\n   - 200 + 300 = 500 lbs\n   - 250 + 300 = 550 lbs (exceeds limit)\n   There are 9 valid combinations with two items.\n4. Three items:\n   - 80 + 120 + 200 = 400 lbs\n   - 80 + 120 + 250 = 450 lbs\n   - 80 + 120 + 300 = 500 lbs\n   - 80 + 200 + 250 = 530 lbs (exceeds limit)\n   - 80 + 200 + 300 = 580 lbs (exceeds limit)\n   - 80 + 250 + 300 = 630 lbs (exceeds limit)\n   - 120 + 200 + 250 = 570 lbs (exceeds limit)\n   - 120 + 200 + 300 = 620 lbs (exceeds limit)\n   - 120 + 250 + 300 = 670 lbs (exceeds limit)\n   There are 3 valid combinations with three items.\n5. Four items:\n   - 80 + 120 + 200 + 250 = 650 lbs (exceeds limit)\n   - 80 + 120 + 200 + 300 = 700 lbs (exceeds limit)\n   - 80 + 120 + 250 + 300 = 750 lbs (exceeds limit)\n   - 80 + 200 + 250 + 300 = 830 lbs (exceeds limit)\n   - 120 + 200 + 250 + 300 = 870 lbs (exceeds limit)\n   There are no valid combinations with four items.\n6. Five items:\n   - 80 + 120 + 200 + 250 + 300 = 950 lbs (exceeds limit)\n   There are no valid combinations with five items.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 18 different ways the student can pack their items without exceeding the car's weight limit of 500 lbs."
