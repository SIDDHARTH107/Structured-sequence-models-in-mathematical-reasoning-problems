    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA cone has a height of 8cm and a radius of 5cm. Determine the surface area of the cone in square centimeters (cm²).",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral surface area (a curved surface), and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle (base) is:\nA_base = π * r^2\nwhere r is the radius.\n\nThe formula for the lateral surface area of a cone is:\nA_lateral = π * r * l\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (l) using the Pythagorean theorem, since we have a right triangle formed by the height (h), radius (r), and slant height (l):\nl^2 = r^2 + h^2\n\nGiven the height (h) = 8 cm and radius (r) = 5 cm, we can find the slant height (l):\nl^2 = 5^2 + 8^2\nl^2 = 25 + 64\nl^2 = 89\nl = √89\nl ≈ 9.43 cm\n\nNow we can find the surface area of the cone:\n\nA_base = π * r^2\nA_base = π * 5^2\nA_base = 25π cm²\n\nA_lateral = π * r * l\nA_lateral = π * 5 * 9.43\nA_lateral ≈ 47.15π cm²\n\nFinally, add the base area and the lateral surface area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 25π + 47.15π\nA_total ≈ 72.15π cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cone is approximately 226.63 cm²."
