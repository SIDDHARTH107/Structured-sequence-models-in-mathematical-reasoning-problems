    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2.\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups of order 72 using the formula for the number of partitions of the exponents of the prime factors. In this case, the partitions for 2^3 are (3), (2,1), and (1,1,1), and the partitions for 3^2 are (2) and (1,1). Therefore, there are 3 * 2 = 6 possible abelian groups of order 72.\n3. Determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 72. This can be done by considering the possible structures of the groups and using the Sylow theorems. There are 4 non-abelian groups of order 72: one with a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, one with a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, and two with both Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups non-normal.\n\nSo, there are a total of 6 abelian groups + 4 non-abelian groups = 10 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
