    "message_1": "Consider a group G of order 30. If G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30, then how many generators does G have? If G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15, then how many elements of order 2 does G possess? Lastly, if G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 30, then what is the order of the conjugacy class containing an element of order 5 in G?",
    "message_2": "1. If G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30, then G is generated by an element of order 30. The number of generators of a cyclic group of order n is given by the Euler's totient function φ(n), which counts the number of positive integers less than n that are relatively prime to n. In this case, n = 30, and the prime factors of 30 are 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, φ(30) = 30 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/5) = 30 * (1/2) * (2/3) * (4/5) = 8. So, G has 8 generators.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15, then G has 15 elements of order 2. The dihedral group Dn has n elements of order 2, which are the reflections in the group. In this case, n = 15, so there are 15 elements of order 2 in G.\n\n3. If G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 30, then G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, say H, of order 5. Let x be an element of order 5 in G. The conjugacy class of x in G is the set of all elements of the form gxg^(-1) for g in G. Since H is normal, the conjugacy class of x is contained in H. The order of the conjugacy class of x is the index of the centralizer of x in G, which is |G : C_G(x)|. Since x has order 5, it is not in the center of G (otherwise, G would be abelian). Therefore, the centralizer of x in G is a proper subgroup of G containing H. The order of H is 5, which is a prime number, so the centralizer of x in G must have order 5 or 10. If the centralizer of x in G has order 5, then the conjugacy class of x has order 30/5 = 6. If the centralizer of x in G has order 10, then the conjugacy class of x has order 30/10 = 3. Since the conjugacy class of x is contained in H, which has order 5, the conjugacy class of x must have order 3."
