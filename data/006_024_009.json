    "message_1": "A train company sees that 30% of its trips to a certain destination are delayed due to bad weather conditions. What's the probability that out of the next 10 trips, at least 7 will be delayed due to bad weather?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, k delayed trips) in n trials (in this case, n = 10 trips)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a trip being delayed due to bad weather, which is 30% or 0.3)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of a trip not being delayed due to bad weather, which is 70% or 0.7)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 7 out of the next 10 trips will be delayed due to bad weather. This means we need to calculate the probability for 7, 8, 9, and 10 delayed trips and sum them up.\n\nP(X ≥ 7) = P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)\n\nLet's calculate each probability:\n\n1. P(X = 7):\nC(10, 7) = 10! / (7!3!) = 120\nP(X = 7) = 120 * (0.3)^7 * (0.7)^3 ≈ 0.2668\n\n2. P(X = 8):\nC(10, 8) = 10! / (8!2!) = 45\nP(X = 8) = 45 * (0.3)^8 * (0.7)^2 ≈ 0.0573\n\n3. P(X = 9):\nC(10, 9) = 10! / (9!1!) = 10\nP(X = 9) = 10 * (0.3)^9 * (0.7)^1 ≈ 0.0054\n\n4. P(X = 10):\nC(10, 10) = 10! / (10!0!) = 1\nP(X = 10) = 1 * (0.3)^10 * (0.7)^0 ≈ 0.00006\n\nNow, let's sum up the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 7) = 0.2668 + 0.0573 + 0.0054 + 0.00006 ≈ 0.3296\n\nSo, the probability that at least 7 out of the next 10 trips will be delayed due to bad weather is approximately 32.96%."
