    "message_1": "A group of 100 patients were diagnosed with a particular disease. Out of these, 60 survived for more than 5 years following the treatment. Using survival analysis, find out the probability of surviving for more than 5 years following the treatment for a random patient with the same disease.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of surviving for more than 5 years following the treatment for a random patient with the same disease, we can use the proportion of patients who survived for more than 5 years out of the total number of patients.\n\nProbability of surviving more than 5 years = (Number of patients who survived more than 5 years) / (Total number of patients)\n\nProbability of surviving more than 5 years = 60 / 100\n\nProbability of surviving more than 5 years = 0.6\n\nSo, the probability of surviving for more than 5 years following the treatment for a random patient with the same disease is 0.6 or 60%."
