    "message_1": "Consider the following partial differential equation (PDE) for a given image:\n\n∂u/∂t = 2∂^2u/∂x^2\n\nwhere u(x,t) represents the intensity of the image as a function of space coordinate x and time t. \n\nSuppose a 2D grayscale image with intensity values ranging from 0 to 255 is subject to this PDE with the following initial condition:\n\nu(x,0) = 50 for all x.\n\nDetermine the solution u(x,t) at the time t=0.05 seconds on the spatial interval x ∈ [0,1] with boundary conditions u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0.",
    "message_2": "To solve this PDE, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x,t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = 2X''(x)T(t)\n\nDivide both sides by 2X(x)T(t):\n\nT'(t) / (2T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ^2:\n\nT'(t) / (2T(t)) = -λ^2\nX''(x) / X(x) = -λ^2\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\nX''(x) + λ^2X(x) = 0\nT'(t) = -2λ^2T(t)\n\nSolve the ODE for X(x):\n\nX''(x) + λ^2X(x) = 0, with boundary conditions X(0) = X(1) = 0\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem with eigenfunctions X_n(x) = sin(nπx) and eigenvalues λ_n = nπ, where n is a positive integer.\n\nNow solve the ODE for T(t):\n\nT'(t) = -2λ^2T(t)\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE with the solution:\n\nT_n(t) = C_n * exp(-2(λ_n)^2 * t) = C_n * exp(-2(nπ)^2 * t)\n\nNow we have the general solution:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [C_n * sin(nπx) * exp(-2(nπ)^2 * t)]\n\nApply the initial condition u(x,0) = 50:\n\n50 = Σ [C_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nThis is a Fourier sine series, so we can find the coefficients C_n using the formula:\n\nC_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)] dx, from 0 to L (L = 1 in this case)\n\nC_n = 2 * ∫[50 * sin(nπx)] dx, from 0 to 1\n\nC_n = (100/πn) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) for odd n, and C_n = 0 for even n\n\nNow we have the solution:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [(100/πn) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) * sin(nπx) * exp(-2(nπ)^2 * t)]\n\nFinally, we can find the solution at t = 0.05:\n\nu(x,0.05) = Σ [(100/πn) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) * sin(nπx) * exp(-2(nπ)^2 * 0.05)]\n\nThis is an infinite series, but the exponential term will cause the series to converge rapidly. You can approximate the solution by taking a finite number of terms in the series."
