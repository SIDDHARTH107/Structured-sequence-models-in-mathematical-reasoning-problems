    "message_1": "In a system of linear equations, the first equation is 3x + 2y = 9, and the second equation is 6x + 4y = 18. Determine if the system of equations has a solution or not.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the system of equations has a solution or not, we can first check if the equations are consistent (have at least one solution) or inconsistent (have no solution). We can do this by comparing the coefficients of the variables in both equations.\n\nFirst equation: 3x + 2y = 9\nSecond equation: 6x + 4y = 18\n\nNotice that the second equation can be obtained by multiplying the first equation by 2:\n\n2 * (3x + 2y) = 2 * 9\n6x + 4y = 18\n\nSince the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation, the two equations are dependent, meaning they represent the same line. In this case, the system of equations has infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line is a solution to both equations."
