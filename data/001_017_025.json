    "message_2": "To solve the equation $\\log_2(x+4) + \\log_2(x-4) = 3$, we can use the properties of logarithms to combine the two logarithmic terms on the left side of the equation.\n\nUsing the product rule for logarithms, which states that $\\log_b{a} + \\log_b{c} = \\log_b{(a \\cdot c)}$, we can combine the two logarithmic terms:\n\n$\\log_2{(x+4)(x-4)} = 3$\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression inside the logarithm by expanding the product:\n\n$\\log_2{(x^2 - 16)} = 3$\n\nTo remove the logarithm, we can use the property that $b^{\\log_b{a}} = a$. In this case, we want to raise both sides of the equation to the power of 2:\n\n$2^{\\log_2{(x^2 - 16)}} = 2^3$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$x^2 - 16 = 8$\n\nNow, we can solve for x by adding 16 to both sides of the equation:\n\n$x^2 = 24$\n\nFinally, we take the square root of both sides:\n\n$x = \\pm\\sqrt{24}$\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\n$x = \\sqrt{24}$ and $x = -\\sqrt{24}$"
