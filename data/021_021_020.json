    "message_2": "Cuckoo Search (CS) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. In this algorithm, each egg in a nest represents a solution, and a cuckoo egg represents a new solution. The goal is to use the new solutions to replace the not-so-good solutions in the nests. Here, we will apply the CS algorithm to find the minimum value of the given function f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 5 with the constraints 0 ≤ x ≤ 5.\n\nParameters:\n- Population size = 10\n- Pa = 0.25 (probability of discovering an alien egg)\n- Alpha = 1.5 (step size scaling factor)\n\nAlgorithm steps:\n1. Initialize the population with 10 random solutions (nests) within the given constraints.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution.\n3. Generate a new solution (cuckoo egg) using a random walk with step size scaled by alpha.\n4. Choose a random nest to compare the fitness of the cuckoo egg with the nest's current solution.\n5. If the cuckoo egg has better fitness, replace the nest's solution with the cuckoo egg.\n6. With probability pa, replace some of the worst solutions with new random solutions.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nSince the CS algorithm involves random processes, it's not possible to provide an exact solution. However, after running the algorithm for a sufficient number of iterations, you can expect to find a solution close to the true minimum.\n\nThe true minimum of the function f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 5 can be found analytically by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 6 = 0\nx = 3\n\nThe minimum value of the function is:\n\nf(3) = 3^2 - 6*3 + 5 = 9 - 18 + 5 = -4\n\nSo, the true minimum value of f(x) is -4, and the corresponding value of x is 3. The Cuckoo Search algorithm should provide a solution close to these values."
