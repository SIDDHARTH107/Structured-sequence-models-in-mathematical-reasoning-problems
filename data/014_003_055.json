    "message_2": "To encrypt the message M=8 using the ElGamal encryption scheme, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random integer k, where 1 < k < p-1. Let's assume k=3.\n2. Compute the public key y = (alpha^d) mod p = (7^5) mod 11 = 10.\n3. Compute the first part of the ciphertext C1 = (alpha^k) mod p = (7^3) mod 11 = 2.\n4. Compute the second part of the ciphertext C2 = (M * (y^k)) mod p = (8 * (10^3)) mod 11 = 9.\n\nThe encrypted message (ciphertext) is the pair (C1, C2) = (2, 9).\n\nNow, to decrypt the message, your friend needs to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the shared secret S = (C1^d) mod p = (2^5) mod 11 = 9.\n2. Compute the modular inverse of S, denoted as S_inv. In this case, S_inv = 5, since (9 * 5) mod 11 = 1.\n3. Compute the original message M = (C2 * S_inv) mod p = (9 * 5) mod 11 = 8.\n\nSo, the decrypted message is M = 8."
