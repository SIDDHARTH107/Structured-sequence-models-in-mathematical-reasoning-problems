    "message_2": "To find the velocity and acceleration of the ball at t=3 seconds, we need to find the first and second derivatives of the position function s(t).\n\nThe position function is given by:\ns(t) = -4.9t^2 + 29.4t + 0.5\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of s(t) with respect to t, which represents the velocity function v(t):\nv(t) = ds/dt = -9.8t + 29.4\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative of s(t) with respect to t, which represents the acceleration function a(t):\na(t) = dv/dt = -9.8\n\nNow we can find the velocity and acceleration of the ball at t=3 seconds by plugging t=3 into the respective functions:\n\nVelocity at t=3 seconds:\nv(3) = -9.8(3) + 29.4\nv(3) = -29.4 + 29.4\nv(3) = 0 m/s\n\nAcceleration at t=3 seconds:\na(3) = -9.8\na(3) = -9.8 m/s²\n\nSo, the velocity of the ball at t=3 seconds is 0 m/s, and the acceleration is -9.8 m/s²."
