The payoffs of each player based on the combination of choices are given in the following matrix:\n\n```\n        1   2   3   4   5  \n    -----------------------\n1 | (7,7) (4,8) (1,6) (5,5) (2,4)  \n2 | (8,4) (5,5) (3,3) (6,1) (4,2)  \n3 | (6,1) (3,6) (2,2) (4,5) (1,4)  \n4 | (5,5) (1,6) (4,4) (3,3) (6,2)  \n5 | (4,2) (2,4) (1,1) (2,6) (5,5)  \n```\n\nAssuming each player wants to maximize their own payoff, find the Nash Equilibrium of this game.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash Equilibrium, we need to identify the strategies where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nFirst, let's find the best response for each player given the other player's strategy:\n\nFor Player 1:\n- If Player 2 chooses 1, the best response is 2 (payoff 8).\n- If Player 2 chooses 2, the best response is 1 (payoff 4).\n- If Player 2 chooses 3, the best response is 1 (payoff 1).\n- If Player 2 chooses 4, the best response is 2 (payoff 6).\n- If Player 2 chooses 5, the best response is 4 (payoff 6).\n\nFor Player 2:\n- If Player 1 chooses 1, the best response is 2 (payoff 8).\n- If Player 1 chooses 2, the best response is 1 (payoff 4).\n- If Player 1 chooses 3, the best response is 2 (payoff 6).\n- If Player 1 chooses 4, the best response is 1 (payoff 5).\n- If Player 1 chooses 5, the best response is 4 (payoff 6).\n\nNow, let's find the strategies where both players are playing their best responses:\n\n- (1, 2): Player 1 gets a payoff of 4, and Player 2 gets a payoff of 8.\n- (2, 1): Player 1 gets a payoff of 8, and Player 2 gets a payoff of 4.\n\nThese two strategy combinations are Nash Equilibria because neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. So, the Nash Equilibria of this game are (1, 2) and (2, 1)."
