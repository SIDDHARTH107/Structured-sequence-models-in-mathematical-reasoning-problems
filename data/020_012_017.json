    "message_1": "A company produces two products: Product A and Product B. The production of Product A requires 2 hours of labor and $5 of materials, while the production of Product B requires 5 hours of labor and $3 of materials. The company has 100 hours of labor and $200 of materials available. If the profit of Product A is $10 per unit and the profit of Product B is $8 per unit, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its total profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and materials are:\n2x + 5y ≤ 100 (labor constraint)\n5x + 3y ≤ 200 (material constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total profit is:\nP = 10x + 8y\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: 2x + 5y ≤ 100\ny ≤ (100 - 2x) / 5\n\n2. Material constraint: 5x + 3y ≤ 200\ny ≤ (200 - 5x) / 3\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. We will find the corner points of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the boundary lines:\n\n1. Intersection of labor constraint and material constraint:\n2x + 5y = 100\n5x + 3y = 200\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 20 and y = 12.\n\n2. Intersection of labor constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n2x + 5y = 100\n2(0) + 5y = 100\ny = 20\n\n3. Intersection of material constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n5x + 3y = 200\n5x + 3(0) = 200\nx = 40\n\nSo, the corner points of the feasible region are (0, 20), (20, 12), and (40, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 10x + 8y at each corner point:\n\n1. P(0, 20) = 10(0) + 8(20) = 160\n2. P(20, 12) = 10(20) + 8(12) = 200 + 96 = 296\n3. P(40, 0) = 10(40) + 8(0) = 400\n\nThe maximum total profit occurs at the point (40, 0), with a profit of $400. Therefore, the company should produce 40 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B to maximize its total profit."
