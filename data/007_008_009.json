    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p.\n\nWe want to find the remainder when 7^27 is divided by 10. Since 10 is not a prime number, we cannot directly apply Fermat's Little Theorem. However, we can use the theorem for the prime factors of 10, which are 2 and 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the remainder when 7^27 is divided by 2:\n7^27 ≡ 1^27 (mod 2) since 7 is odd\nSo, 7^27 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n\nNow, let's find the remainder when 7^27 is divided by 5. Since 5 is a prime number, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n7^4 ≡ 1 (mod 5) since 5-1 = 4\nNow, we can write 7^27 as (7^4)^6 * 7^3:\n7^27 ≡ (7^4)^6 * 7^3 (mod 5)\nSince 7^4 ≡ 1 (mod 5), we have:\n7^27 ≡ 1^6 * 7^3 (mod 5)\n7^27 ≡ 7^3 (mod 5)\n7^27 ≡ 343 (mod 5)\n7^27 ≡ 3 (mod 5)\n\nNow, we have the remainders when 7^27 is divided by 2 and 5. We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the remainder when 7^27 is divided by 10.\n\nLet x be the remainder when 7^27 is divided by 10. Then,\nx ≡ 1 (mod 2)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 5)\n\nSince 2 and 5 are coprime, we can find a solution for x. We can use the following method:\n\n1. Find the modular inverses:\n2 * 5_inv ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n5 * 2_inv ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n\n5_inv = 3 since 2 * 3 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2_inv = 1 since 5 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n\n2. Compute the solution:\nx ≡ 1 * 5 * 3 + 3 * 2 * 1 (mod 10)\nx ≡ 15 + 6 (mod 10)\nx ≡ 21 (mod 10)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^27 is divided by 10 is 1."
