    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 5  4 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 8  |\n    | 17 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A. To do this, we first calculate the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = (2 * 4) - (3 * 5) = 8 - 15 = -7\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, let's find the inverse of A, denoted as A^(-1).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A), where adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nThe adjugate of A is obtained by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the signs of the off-diagonal elements.\n\nadj(A) = |  4  -3 |\n         | -5   2 |\n\nNow, let's find A^(-1).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-7) * |  4  -3 |\n                 | -5   2 |\n\nA^(-1) = | -4/7  3/7  |\n         |  5/7 -2/7  |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y by multiplying A^(-1) with B.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\n| x |   | -4/7  3/7  |   | 8  |\n| y | = |  5/7 -2/7  | * | 17 |\n\n| x |   | (-4/7 * 8) + (3/7 * 17) |\n| y | = | (5/7 * 8) - (2/7 * 17)   |\n\n| x |   | -32/7 + 51/7 |\n| y | = | 40/7 - 34/7   |\n\n| x |   | 19/7  |\n| y | = |  6/7  |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 19/7 and y = 6/7."
