    "message_2": "There is no maximum number of states that a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can have with an input alphabet of size 3. A DFA can have any number of states, depending on the specific problem it is designed to solve or the language it is designed to recognize. The number of states can be as small as 1 or grow to an arbitrarily large number."
