    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2sin(x) + 1 = 0 for x in the interval [0, 2π], follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate sin(x):\n2sin(x) = -1\nsin(x) = -1/2\n\n2. Find the angles x in the interval [0, 2π] that have a sine of -1/2:\nx = arcsin(-1/2)\n\nThe two angles in the interval [0, 2π] that have a sine of -1/2 are:\nx = 7π/6 and x = 11π/6\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation 2sin(x) + 1 = 0 in the interval [0, 2π] are x = 7π/6 and x = 11π/6."
