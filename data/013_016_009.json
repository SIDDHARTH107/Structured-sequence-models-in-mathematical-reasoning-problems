    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem related to Moral Hazard in Game Theory:\n\nAssume that there are two employees, A and B, working for a company. The company can either invest in a safe project that generates a profit of $100,000 with a probability of 0.8, or in a risky project that generates a profit of $200,000 with a probability of 0.5. The probability of success or failure depends on the effort level of the employees, which can either be low or high. If both employees exert high effort, the probability of success is 0.9, whereas if they both exert low effort, the probability of success is 0.6. However, if one employee exerts high effort and the other exerts low effort, the probability of success is only 0.7. \n\nAssume that A is risk-neutral, and that B is risk-averse with a coefficient of absolute risk aversion of 0.5. What will be the effort level of each employee if the company chooses to invest in the risky project?",
    "message_2": "To determine the effort level of each employee, we need to analyze their expected utility from exerting high or low effort in the risky project. \n\nLet's denote the effort levels as follows:\n- A_H: A exerts high effort\n- A_L: A exerts low effort\n- B_H: B exerts high effort\n- B_L: B exerts low effort\n\nWe will calculate the expected utility for each employee under different combinations of effort levels.\n\n1. Both A and B exert high effort (A_H, B_H):\n\nProbability of success: 0.9\nExpected profit for A: 0.9 * $200,000 = $180,000\nExpected profit for B: 0.9 * $200,000 = $180,000\nUtility for B: -0.5 * (180,000)^2 = -$16,200,000,000\n\n2. A exerts high effort, B exerts low effort (A_H, B_L):\n\nProbability of success: 0.7\nExpected profit for A: 0.7 * $200,000 = $140,000\nExpected profit for B: 0.7 * $200,000 = $140,000\nUtility for B: -0.5 * (140,000)^2 = -$9,800,000,000\n\n3. A exerts low effort, B exerts high effort (A_L, B_H):\n\nProbability of success: 0.7\nExpected profit for A: 0.7 * $200,000 = $140,000\nExpected profit for B: 0.7 * $200,000 = $140,000\nUtility for B: -0.5 * (140,000)^2 = -$9,800,000,000\n\n4. Both A and B exert low effort (A_L, B_L):\n\nProbability of success: 0.6\nExpected profit for A: 0.6 * $200,000 = $120,000\nExpected profit for B: 0.6 * $200,000 = $120,000\nUtility for B: -0.5 * (120,000)^2 = -$7,200,000,000\n\nSince A is risk-neutral, they will choose the effort level that maximizes their expected profit. In this case, A will exert high effort (A_H) because the expected profit is higher when exerting high effort ($180,000) compared to low effort ($120,000).\n\nB, being risk-averse, will choose the effort level that maximizes their utility. Comparing the utilities for B under different effort combinations, we can see that the highest utility for B is when both A and B exert low effort (A_L, B_L) with a utility of -$7,200,000,000.\n\nTherefore, if the company chooses to invest in the risky project, employee A will exert high effort (A_H), and employee B will exert low effort (B_L)."
