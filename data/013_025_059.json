    "message_1": "In a game of Traveler's Dilemma, two travelers A and B are caught with identical antique pots at customs. The customs officials offer a deal: if one traveler confesses and the other stays silent, the confessor will receive a lighter sentence than the silent one. If both confess, both travelers will receive a moderate sentence, and if both stay silent, both will receive a light sentence. The jail sentences for each scenario are given in the table below:\n\n|Traveler A\\Traveler B | Confess | Stay Silent|\n|---------------------|---------|-----------|\n|Confess              | 5 years | 1 year     |\n|Stay Silent          | 6 years | 2 years    |\n\nIf traveler A chooses to confess, what is the best strategy for traveler B and what sentence will each traveler receive?",
    "message_2": "If traveler A chooses to confess, traveler B has two options: confess or stay silent. \n\nIf traveler B confesses, both travelers will receive a 5-year sentence. \nIf traveler B stays silent, traveler A will receive a 1-year sentence, and traveler B will receive a 6-year sentence.\n\nIn this scenario, the best strategy for traveler B is to also confess, as it results in a shorter sentence of 5 years compared to staying silent and receiving a 6-year sentence. So, if traveler A confesses and traveler B also confesses, both travelers will receive a 5-year sentence."
