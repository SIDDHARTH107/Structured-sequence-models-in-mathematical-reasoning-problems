Calculate the number of abelian groups of order 96 using the formula: p(n) = product of (p_i^(e_i + 1) - 1) / (p_i - 1), where p_i are the distinct prime factors and e_i are their respective exponents in the prime factorization.\n\nFor our case, p(96) = (2^(5+1) - 1) / (2 - 1) * (3^(1+1) - 1) / (3 - 1) = (63) * (8) = 504\n\n3. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order n: g(n) = (1/n) * sum(d(n) * p(n/d)), where d(n) are the divisors of n and p(n) is the number of abelian groups of order n.\n\nFor our case, the divisors of 96 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 96. We have already calculated p(96) = 504. We need to calculate p(n/d) for each divisor and then use the formula to find g(96).\n\np(1) = 1\np(2) = 1\np(3) = 1\np(4) = 2\np(6) = 2\np(8) = 5\np(12) = 5\np(16) = 14\np(24) = 15\np(32) = 51\np(48) = 52\n\nNow, we can calculate g(96) using the formula:\n\ng(96) = (1/96) * (1 * 504 + 2 * 1 + 3 * 1 + 4 * 2 + 6 * 2 + 8 * 5 + 12 * 5 + 16 * 14 + 24 * 15 + 32 * 51 + 48 * 52) = (1/96) * 6204 = 65\n\nSo, there are 65 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
