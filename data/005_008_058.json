    "message_2": "To find the three-month moving average for the months of August, September, and October, we need to first identify the sales data for these months. In the given data, August corresponds to the 8th month, September to the 9th month, and October to the 10th month. So, the sales data for these months are:\n\nAugust: 17,000\nSeptember: 19,000\nOctober: 18,000\n\nNow, we will calculate the moving average for these three months:\n\nThree-month moving average for August = (Sales of June + Sales of July + Sales of August) / 3\n= (12,000 + 16,000 + 17,000) / 3\n= 45,000 / 3\n= 15,000\n\nThree-month moving average for September = (Sales of July + Sales of August + Sales of September) / 3\n= (16,000 + 17,000 + 19,000) / 3\n= 52,000 / 3\n= 17,333.33 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nThree-month moving average for October = (Sales of August + Sales of September + Sales of October) / 3\n= (17,000 + 19,000 + 18,000) / 3\n= 54,000 / 3\n= 18,000\n\nSo, the three-month moving averages for August, September, and October are 15,000, 17,333.33, and 18,000, respectively."
