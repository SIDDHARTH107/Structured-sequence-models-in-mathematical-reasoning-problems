    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which are used to count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. The Stirling number of the second kind is denoted as S(n, k).\n\nIn this case, we have 10 people and want to divide them into 4 non-empty committees. So we need to find S(10, 4).\n\nThe formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe can use this formula to find S(10, 4) by first finding the values for smaller n and k:\n\nS(1, 1) = 1\nS(2, 1) = 1\nS(2, 2) = 1\nS(3, 1) = 1\nS(3, 2) = 3\nS(3, 3) = 1\nS(4, 1) = 1\nS(4, 2) = 7\nS(4, 3) = 6\nS(4, 4) = 1\nS(5, 1) = 1\nS(5, 2) = 15\nS(5, 3) = 25\nS(5, 4) = 10\nS(5, 5) = 1\nS(6, 1) = 1\nS(6, 2) = 31\nS(6, 3) = 90\nS(6, 4) = 65\nS(6, 5) = 15\nS(6, 6) = 1\nS(7, 1) = 1\nS(7, 2) = 63\nS(7, 3) = 301\nS(7, 4) = 350\nS(7, 5) = 140\nS(7, 6) = 21\nS(7, 7) = 1\nS(8, 1) = 1\nS(8, 2) = 127\nS(8, 3) = 966\nS(8, 4) = 1701\nS(8, 5) = 1050\nS(8, 6) = 266\nS(8, 7) = 28\nS(8, 8) = 1\nS(9, 1) = 1\nS(9, 2) = 255\nS(9, 3) = 3025\nS(9, 4) = 7770\nS(9, 5) = 6951\nS(9, 6) = 2646\nS(9, 7) = 462\nS(9, 8) = 36\nS(9, 9) = 1\n\nNow we can find S(10, 4) using the formula:\n\nS(10, 4) = 4 * S(9, 4) + S(9, 3)\nS(10, 4) = 4 * 7770 + 3025\nS(10, 4) = 31080 + 3025\nS(10, 4) = 34105\n\nSo there are 34,105 ways to divide 10 people into 4 non-empty committees when the order of the committees does not matter."
