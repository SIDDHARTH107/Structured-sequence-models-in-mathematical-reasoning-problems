    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in the first and second equations equal:\n\n2(x - 4y + 5z) = 2(-10)\n2x - 8y + 10z = -20\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the modified second equation:\n\n(2x - 8y + 10z) - (2x + y - 3z) = -20 - 13\n-9y + 13z = -33\n\nNext, multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of x in the second and third equations equal:\n\n3(x - 4y + 5z) = 3(-10)\n3x - 12y + 15z = -30\n\nNow, subtract the third equation from the modified second equation:\n\n(3x - 12y + 15z) - (3x + 2y - z) = -30 - 5.5\n-14y + 16z = -35.5\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n-9y + 13z = -33 (1)\n-14y + 16z = -35.5 (2)\n\nMultiply equation (1) by 14 and equation (2) by 9 to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n-126y + 182z = -462 (3)\n-126y + 144z = -319.5 (4)\n\nSubtract equation (4) from equation (3):\n\n(182z - 144z) = (-462 + 319.5)\n38z = -142.5\n\nNow, divide by 38 to find the value of z:\n\nz = -142.5 / 38\nz ≈ -3.75\n\nNow, substitute the value of z back into equation (1) to find the value of y:\n\n-9y + 13(-3.75) = -33\n-9y - 48.75 = -33\n-9y = 15.75\ny ≈ 15.75 / 9\ny ≈ 1.75\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z back into the original first equation to find the value of x:\n\n2x + 1.75 - 3(-3.75) = 13\n2x + 1.75 + 11.25 = 13\n2x = 13 - 13\nx = 0\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx ≈ 0\ny ≈ 1.75\nz ≈ -3.75"
