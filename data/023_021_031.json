    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given current function i(t) = 5sin(2π50t), we can use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nI(f) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} i(t) * e^(-j2πft) dt\n\nwhere I(f) is the Fourier transform of i(t), and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1).\n\nSince the given function is a sinusoidal function, we can expect that the Fourier transform will have a single frequency component at 50 Hz. Let's compute the Fourier transform:\n\nI(f) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} 5sin(2π50t) * e^(-j2πft) dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the Euler's formula:\n\nsin(x) = (e^(jx) - e^(-jx)) / (2j)\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\nI(f) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} 5((e^(j2π50t) - e^(-j2π50t)) / (2j)) * e^(-j2πft) dt\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nI(f) = (5/2j) * [∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(j2π50t) * e^(-j2πft) dt - ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-j2π50t) * e^(-j2πft) dt]\n\nLet's solve the two integrals separately:\n\n∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(j2π50t) * e^(-j2πft) dt = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-j2π(f-50)t) dt = δ(f-50)\n\n∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-j2π50t) * e^(-j2πft) dt = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-j2π(f+50)t) dt = δ(f+50)\n\nwhere δ(f) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we can plug these results back into the expression for I(f):\n\nI(f) = (5/2j) * [δ(f-50) - δ(f+50)]\n\nThis result shows that the Fourier transform of the given current function has two frequency components: one at 50 Hz and another at -50 Hz. The amplitudes of these components are 5/2j and -5/2j, respectively. The negative frequency component represents the complex conjugate of the positive frequency component, which is expected for a real-valued function like the given current function."
