    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and M is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, there are N = 4 self-similar pieces, and each piece is scaled down by a factor of M = 3 compared to the original curve.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension does not change with iterations, so the dimension will still be approximately 1.2619 after 8 iterations."
