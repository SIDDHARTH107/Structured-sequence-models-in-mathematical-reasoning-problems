Each factory has a certain production rate and each warehouse has a certain demand. The maximum capacity of transportation between any factory and warehouse is given as follows:\n\nFactory 1 can produce 50 units per day;\nFactory 2 can produce 60 units per day;\nFactory 3 can produce 40 units per day;\nFactory 4 can produce 70 units per day;\n\nWarehouse A demands 80 units per day;\nWarehouse B demands 50 units per day;\nWarehouse C demands 90 units per day.\n\nDetermine the maximum number of units that can be transported daily, satisfying the production rates of each factory and the demand of every warehouse.",
    "message_2": "To determine the maximum number of units that can be transported daily, we need to consider the production rates of each factory and the demand of every warehouse.\n\nTotal production capacity of all factories:\nFactory 1: 50 units/day\nFactory 2: 60 units/day\nFactory 3: 40 units/day\nFactory 4: 70 units/day\nTotal production capacity: 50 + 60 + 40 + 70 = 220 units/day\n\nTotal demand of all warehouses:\nWarehouse A: 80 units/day\nWarehouse B: 50 units/day\nWarehouse C: 90 units/day\nTotal demand: 80 + 50 + 90 = 220 units/day\n\nSince the total production capacity of all factories is equal to the total demand of all warehouses, it is possible to transport the maximum number of units daily, satisfying the production rates of each factory and the demand of every warehouse.\n\nThe maximum number of units that can be transported daily is 220 units."
