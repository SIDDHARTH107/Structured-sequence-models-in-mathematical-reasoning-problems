    "message_1": "Suppose a farmer has 200 acres of land to plant either corn or wheat. Each acre of corn requires 5 units of labor and 1 unit of fertilizer, while each acre of wheat requires 3 units of labor and 2 units of fertilizer. The farmer has 480 units of labor and 240 units of fertilizer available. If the profit from a corn crop is $400 per acre and from a wheat crop is $300 per acre, determine how many acres of each crop the farmer should plant in order to maximize profits.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of corn and y be the number of acres of wheat. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 200 (total acres of land)\n2. 5x + 3y ≤ 480 (total units of labor)\n3. x + 2y ≤ 240 (total units of fertilizer)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is P(x, y) = 400x + 300y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 200\n   y ≤ 200 - x\n\n2. 5x + 3y ≤ 480\n   y ≤ (480 - 5x) / 3\n\n3. x + 2y ≤ 240\n   y ≤ (240 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraint lines intersect. We can find these points by solving the equations:\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and 2:\nx + y = 200\n5x + 3y = 480\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 40 and y = 160.\n\nIntersection of constraint 1 and 3:\nx + y = 200\nx + 2y = 240\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 80 and y = 120.\n\nIntersection of constraint 2 and 3:\n5x + 3y = 480\nx + 2y = 240\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 72 and y = 84.\n\nNow we have the vertices of the feasible region: (0, 200), (40, 160), (80, 120), and (72, 84). We will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of these points:\n\nP(0, 200) = 400(0) + 300(200) = $60,000\nP(40, 160) = 400(40) + 300(160) = $64,000\nP(80, 120) = 400(80) + 300(120) = $68,000\nP(72, 84) = 400(72) + 300(84) = $63,600\n\nThe maximum profit of $68,000 is achieved when the farmer plants 80 acres of corn and 120 acres of wheat."
