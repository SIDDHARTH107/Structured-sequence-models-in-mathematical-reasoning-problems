    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we first need to form an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n|  2   1  -1 |  8  |\n| -3  -1   2 | -11 |\n| -1   1   3 |  5  |\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows.\nTo do this, we can perform the following row operations:\n- R2 = R2 + (3/2)R1\n- R3 = R3 + (1/2)R1\n\nThe augmented matrix becomes:\n\n```\n|  2    1   -1 |  8  |\n|  0   -1/2  1/2 | -7/2|\n|  0    3/2  5/2 | 21/2|\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second element in the third row.\nTo do this, we can perform the following row operation:\n- R3 = R3 - 3R2\n\nThe augmented matrix becomes:\n\n```\n|  2    1   -1 |  8  |\n|  0  -1/2  1/2 | -7/2|\n|  0    0    2 |  6  |\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\nFrom the last row, we have 2z = 6, so z = 3.\n\nStep 4: Back-substitute to find y and x.\nFrom the second row, we have -1/2y + 1/2(3) = -7/2, so y = 2.\nFrom the first row, we have 2x + 2 - 3 = 8, so x = 4.5.\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 4.5, y = 2, and z = 3."
