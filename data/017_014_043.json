    "message_2": "The group of rotational symmetries of a regular decagon has order 10, since there are 10 distinct rotations that map the decagon onto itself (including the identity rotation). This group is denoted as C_10, the cyclic group of order 10.\n\nNow, we need to find a group of order 20 that is isomorphic to C_10. The only group of order 20 that can be isomorphic to C_10 is the direct product of C_10 with a group of order 2, which is C_2. This is because the order of a direct product of two groups is the product of their orders, and 10 * 2 = 20.\n\nTherefore, the group of order 20 that is isomorphic to the group of rotational symmetries of a regular decagon is C_10 Ã— C_2."
