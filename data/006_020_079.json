    "message_1": "In a community of 500 people, 320 have a smartphone and 240 have a Facebook account. If having a smartphone and having a Facebook account are independent events, what is the probability that a person selected at random from the community has both a smartphone and a Facebook account?",
    "message_2": "Since having a smartphone and having a Facebook account are independent events, we can find the probability of both events occurring by multiplying the probabilities of each event.\n\nThe probability of having a smartphone is 320/500, and the probability of having a Facebook account is 240/500.\n\nP(having a smartphone and a Facebook account) = P(having a smartphone) * P(having a Facebook account)\n\nP(having a smartphone and a Facebook account) = (320/500) * (240/500)\n\nP(having a smartphone and a Facebook account) = 76800/250000\n\nP(having a smartphone and a Facebook account) = 0.3072\n\nSo, the probability that a person selected at random from the community has both a smartphone and a Facebook account is 0.3072 or 30.72%."
