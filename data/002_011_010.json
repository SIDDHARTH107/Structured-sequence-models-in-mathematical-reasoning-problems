    "message_1": "A right-angled triangle has one leg of length 6 cm and the hypotenuse of length 10 cm. Find the length of the other leg.",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs). \n\nLet's denote the length of the unknown leg as \"a\" and the given leg as \"b\" (b = 6 cm). The hypotenuse is denoted as \"c\" (c = 10 cm). The Pythagorean theorem can be written as:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nWe know the values of b and c, so we can plug them into the equation:\n\na^2 + 6^2 = 10^2\n\na^2 + 36 = 100\n\nNow, we can solve for a^2:\n\na^2 = 100 - 36\na^2 = 64\n\nTo find the length of the other leg (a), we take the square root of 64:\n\na = âˆš64\na = 8\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 8 cm."
