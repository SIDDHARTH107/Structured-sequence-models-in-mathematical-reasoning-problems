    "message_1": "A certain lottery game has a 1 in 10,000 chance of winning the jackpot prize. If you buy 5 tickets, what is the probability that you will win the jackpot prize in at least one of the tickets?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability method. Instead of finding the probability of winning the jackpot with at least one ticket, we will find the probability of not winning the jackpot with any of the tickets and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of not winning the jackpot with a single ticket is:\n1 - (1/10,000) = 9,999/10,000\n\nSince the tickets are independent events, the probability of not winning the jackpot with all 5 tickets is:\n(9,999/10,000)^5\n\nNow, we find the complementary probability of winning the jackpot with at least one ticket:\n1 - (9,999/10,000)^5 â‰ˆ 0.000499\n\nSo, the probability of winning the jackpot with at least one of the 5 tickets is approximately 0.000499 or 0.0499%."
