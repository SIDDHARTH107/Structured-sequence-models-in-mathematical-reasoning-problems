    "message_2": "To calculate the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we first note that 24 = 2^3 * 3. We will use the Sylow theorems to help us determine the possible structures of these groups.\n\nLet G be a group of order 24. By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we can consider the possible cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Both P and Q are normal in G, and G is the direct product of P and Q. Since P has order 8 and Q has order 3, G is isomorphic to C8 x C3 or D8 x C3, where D8 is the dihedral group of order 8.\n\n2. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and four Sylow 3-subgroups. P is normal in G, but the Sylow 3-subgroups are not. G is a semidirect product of P and a Sylow 3-subgroup Q. This gives us the non-abelian group of order 24, which is a semidirect product of C8 and C3.\n\n3. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Q is normal in G, but the Sylow 2-subgroups are not. G is a semidirect product of Q and a Sylow 2-subgroup P. This gives us the non-abelian group of order 24, which is a semidirect product of C3 and Q8, where Q8 is the quaternion group of order 8.\n\n4. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4: In this case, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Neither P nor Q are normal in G. This case does not give us any new non-isomorphic groups.\n\nIn summary, there are five non-isomorphic groups of order 24:\n\n1. C24 (cyclic group)\n2. C8 x C3 (direct product of two cyclic groups)\n3. D8 x C3 (direct product of dihedral group and cyclic group)\n4. Semidirect product of C8 and C3 (non-abelian group)\n5. Semidirect product of C3 and Q8 (non-abelian group)\n\nNote that the alternating group A5 is not relevant here, as it has order 60, not 24."
