    "message_2": "To find the number of terms in this arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of terms = (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1\n\nIn this sequence, the first term is 5, the last term is 101, and the common difference is 2.\n\nNumber of terms = (101 - 5) / 2 + 1\nNumber of terms = 96 / 2 + 1\nNumber of terms = 48 + 1\nNumber of terms = 49\n\nSo there are 49 terms in the sequence."
