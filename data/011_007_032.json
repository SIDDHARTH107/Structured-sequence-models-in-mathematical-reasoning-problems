    "message_2": "Let X be the number of children in a randomly selected family. Since a family can have either one or two children, X can take on the values 1 or 2. The probability of a family having one child is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nThe expected value of X, denoted as E(X), is the sum of the product of each value of X and its corresponding probability. In this case, E(X) = (1 * P(X=1)) + (2 * P(X=2)).\n\nE(X) = (1 * 0.6) + (2 * 0.4) = 0.6 + 0.8 = 1.4\n\nSo, the expected number of children in a randomly selected family is 1.4."
