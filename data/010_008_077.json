    "message_2": "A two-dimensional face in a simplicial complex is a triangle formed by connecting three vertices with three edges. To maximize the number of two-dimensional faces, we need to find the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the 6 vertices and 10 edges.\n\nA complete graph with 6 vertices (K6) has 6 choose 3 (6! / (3! * (6-3)!)) = 20 triangles. However, K6 has 15 edges (6 choose 2), which is more than the 10 edges we have in our simplicial complex.\n\nTo maximize the number of triangles, we can consider a complete graph with 5 vertices (K5), which has 10 edges (5 choose 2) and 10 triangles (5 choose 3). This graph can be extended to a simplicial complex by adding the 6th vertex without adding any new edges. In this case, the 6th vertex will not be part of any triangles, and the maximum number of two-dimensional faces remains the same as in K5.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of two-dimensional faces in a simplicial complex with 6 vertices and 10 edges is 10."
