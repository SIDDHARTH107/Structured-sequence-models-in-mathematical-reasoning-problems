    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we'll first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  1  1 |  9 ]\n[ 1 -1  1 |  2 ]\n[ 1  2 -1 | -3 ]\n```\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to get the matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  1 |  2 ]\n[ 2  1  1 |  9 ]\n[ 1  2 -1 | -3 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 2 and Row 3 with (-1 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  1 |  2 ]\n[ 0  3 -1 |  5 ]\n[ 0  3 -2 | -5 ]\n```\n\n3. Divide Row 2 by 3:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  1 |  2 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 |  5/3 ]\n[ 0  3 -2 | -5 ]\n```\n\n4. Replace Row 3 with (-3 * Row 2) + Row 3:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  1 |  2 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 |  5/3 ]\n[ 0  0 -1/3 | -10/3 ]\n```\n\n5. Divide Row 3 by (-1/3):\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  1 |  2 ]\n[ 0  1 -1/3 |  5/3 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 10 ]\n```\n\nNow that we have the matrix in row-echelon form, we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. From Row 3: z = 10\n2. From Row 2: y - (1/3)z = 5/3 => y - (1/3)(10) = 5/3 => y = 5\n3. From Row 1: x - y + z = 2 => x - 5 + 10 = 2 => x = -3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -3, y = 5, and z = 10."
