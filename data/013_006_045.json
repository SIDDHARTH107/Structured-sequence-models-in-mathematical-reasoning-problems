    "message_1": "Suppose John and Jane are hunting in the forest. They agreed to either hunt a stag, which can feed them for a week, or a hare, which can only feed them for a day. If either one of them hunts a hare, they don't get anything. However, hunting stag requires cooperation from both sides, which means they need to coordinate their actions. John has a 70% chance of successfully hunting a stag on his own, while Jane has a 60% chance of doing so. If they hunt together, they will have a 90% chance of successfully hunting a stag. \n\nAssuming that their only goal is to maximize their chances of getting fed for the week, what is the best strategy for John and Jane to take in this situation?",
    "message_2": "The best strategy for John and Jane to maximize their chances of getting fed for the week is to hunt the stag together. By doing so, they will have a 90% chance of successfully hunting a stag, which is higher than either of their individual chances (70% for John and 60% for Jane). This cooperative strategy will give them the highest probability of securing food for the week."
