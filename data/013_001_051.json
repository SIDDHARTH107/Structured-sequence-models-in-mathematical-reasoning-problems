    "message_1": "A game of Prisoner's Dilemma is played between two individuals. Each person can choose to cooperate or defect. If both persons cooperate, they each receive a payoff of 4. If one person cooperates while the other defects, the person who defects receives a payoff of 6 while the person who cooperated receives a payoff of 1. If both persons defect, they each receive a payoff of 2. What strategy should each person adopt to maximize their payoff?",
    "message_2": "In the Prisoner's Dilemma, the best strategy for each individual to maximize their payoff is to always defect. Here's why:\n\n1. If the other person cooperates, it's better to defect because the payoff for defecting (6) is greater than the payoff for cooperating (4).\n2. If the other person defects, it's still better to defect because the payoff for defecting (2) is greater than the payoff for cooperating (1).\n\nSo, regardless of the other person's choice, defecting always results in a higher payoff for the individual. This is known as the dominant strategy in the Prisoner's Dilemma. However, it's important to note that if both individuals followed the strategy of always cooperating, they would both receive a higher payoff (4) compared to both defecting (2). But due to the nature of the game, each individual will choose to defect to maximize their own payoff, leading to a less optimal outcome for both."
