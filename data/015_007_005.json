    "message_2": "The period-doubling route to chaos in a logistic map occurs when the parameter r increases, causing the system to undergo a series of bifurcations, each of which doubles the period of the system. \n\nInitially, the logistic map has a period of 1 (i.e., it converges to a fixed point). The first bifurcation occurs when r crosses the value of 3. At this point, the system's period doubles from 1 to 2. \n\nIn our case, since r = 3.7, which is greater than 3, the system has already undergone the first bifurcation. Therefore, the period of the system after the first bifurcation is 2."
