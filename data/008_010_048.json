    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the third equation to get rid of the fraction:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 3 (1)\n2x - 2y + 4z = -2 (2)\n-2x + y - 2z = 0 (3) (multiply the third equation by 2)\n\nNow let's perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third equations:\n\nAdd (2/3) times the first equation to the second equation:\n(2/3)(3x + 2y - z) = (2/3)(3)\n2x - 2y + 4z = -2 + 2 = 0\nSo, the new second equation is:\n0x - 4y + 5z = 0 (2')\n\nAdd (2/3) times the first equation to the third equation:\n(2/3)(3x + 2y - z) = (2/3)(3)\n-2x + y - 2z = 2\nSo, the new third equation is:\n0x + 4y - 5z = 2 (3')\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third equation:\n\nAdd the second equation to the third equation:\n0x - 4y + 5z = 0\n0x + 4y - 5z = 2\n-------------------\n0x + 0y + 0z = 2\n\nThis last equation (0 = 2) is not possible, which means the system of linear equations has no solution."
