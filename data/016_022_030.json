    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal structure that is formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The number of triangles at each level can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal triangles = 4^n\n\nwhere n is the level of the pyramid.\n\nFor the 4th level of the Sierpinski pyramid:\n\nTotal triangles = 4^4 = 256\n\nSo, there are 256 triangles in the 4th level of the Sierpinski pyramid."
