    "message_2": "The given system of linear equations is:\n\n2x + 3y = 4\n4x + 6y = 8\n\nFirst, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n(2 * 2x) + (2 * 3y) = (2 * 4)\n4x + 6y = 8\n\nSince the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation, these two equations are dependent and represent the same line. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of equations, and they cannot be reduced to a single unique solution for x and y."
