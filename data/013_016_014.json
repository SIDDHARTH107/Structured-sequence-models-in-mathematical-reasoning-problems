Package A offers a fixed salary of $50,000 per year, while Package B offers a base salary of $30,000 plus a commission of 10% on all sales made. \n\nThe employer estimates that there is a 60% chance that the employee will make $100,000 in sales during the year, and a 40% chance that she will only make $50,000 in sales during the year. \n\nAssuming the employee's goal is to maximize her income, which compensation package should she choose and how much income can she expect to earn in the coming year?",
    "message_2": "To determine which compensation package the employee should choose, we need to calculate the expected income for each package based on the given probabilities.\n\nPackage A:\nThe income is fixed at $50,000, so the expected income is $50,000.\n\nPackage B:\nThere is a 60% chance that the employee will make $100,000 in sales, and a 40% chance that she will make $50,000 in sales. We need to calculate the income for each scenario and then find the expected income.\n\nIf the employee makes $100,000 in sales:\nBase salary: $30,000\nCommission: 10% of $100,000 = $10,000\nTotal income: $30,000 + $10,000 = $40,000\n\nIf the employee makes $50,000 in sales:\nBase salary: $30,000\nCommission: 10% of $50,000 = $5,000\nTotal income: $30,000 + $5,000 = $35,000\n\nNow, we calculate the expected income for Package B:\n(0.6 * $40,000) + (0.4 * $35,000) = $24,000 + $14,000 = $38,000\n\nComparing the expected incomes:\nPackage A: $50,000\nPackage B: $38,000\n\nThe employee should choose Package A, as it offers a higher expected income of $50,000 per year."
