The groups are:\n\n1. Z_24 (cyclic group)\n2. Z_12 × Z_2\n3. Z_8 × Z_3\n4. Z_6 × Z_4\n5. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_2\n6. Z_3 × (Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2)\n7. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_3\n8. S_4 (symmetric group on 4 elements)\n9. A_4 × Z_2 (alternating group on 4 elements)\n10. SL(2, Z_3) (special linear group)\n11. Z_4 ⋊ Z_6\n12. Z_3 ⋊ Z_8\n13. Z_3 ⋊ Q_8 (quaternion group)\n14. Z_2 × S_3 × Z_2\n15. Z_2 × A_4\n\nThese groups have different structures and properties, and they are not isomorphic to each other."
