    "message_1": "Suppose a network has 1000 computers and is vulnerable to two types of cyber attacks: phishing and malware. The probability of a phishing attack occurring on any given computer is 0.05 while the probability of a malware attack occurring on any given computer is 0.03. What is the probability that a randomly chosen computer from the network will experience at least one type of cyber attack?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen computer will experience at least one type of cyber attack, we can use the complementary probability rule. That is, we can find the probability that a computer will not experience any cyber attack and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet A be the event of a phishing attack and B be the event of a malware attack.\n\nP(A) = 0.05 (probability of a phishing attack)\nP(B) = 0.03 (probability of a malware attack)\n\nWe want to find P(A ∪ B), the probability of a computer experiencing at least one type of cyber attack.\n\nUsing the complementary probability rule, we have:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 1 - P(A' ∩ B')\n\nWhere A' is the event of no phishing attack and B' is the event of no malware attack.\n\nNow, we can use the multiplication rule for independent events, since the occurrence of a phishing attack and a malware attack are assumed to be independent:\n\nP(A' ∩ B') = P(A') * P(B')\n\nThe probabilities of not having a phishing attack and not having a malware attack are:\n\nP(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95\nP(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.03 = 0.97\n\nNow, we can find P(A' ∩ B'):\n\nP(A' ∩ B') = P(A') * P(B') = 0.95 * 0.97 ≈ 0.9215\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of a computer experiencing at least one type of cyber attack:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 1 - P(A' ∩ B') = 1 - 0.9215 ≈ 0.0785\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen computer from the network will experience at least one type of cyber attack is approximately 0.0785 or 7.85%."
