    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and phase of the input signal using Fourier Transform analysis, we first need to express the output signal in terms of sine and cosine functions. The given output signal is:\n\ny(t) = 2cos(600πt + π/4)\n\nUsing the cosine angle addition formula, we can rewrite the output signal as:\n\ny(t) = 2[cos(600πt)cos(π/4) - sin(600πt)sin(π/4)]\n\nNow, we can express the output signal as a sum of sine and cosine functions:\n\ny(t) = √2cos(600πt) - √2sin(600πt)\n\nThe Fourier Transform of a continuous-time signal x(t) is given by:\n\nX(ω) = ∫[x(t)e^(-jωt)]dt\n\nApplying the Fourier Transform to the output signal y(t), we get:\n\nY(ω) = ∫[(√2cos(600πt) - √2sin(600πt))e^(-jωt)]dt\n\nNow, we can separate the integral into two parts:\n\nY(ω) = √2∫[cos(600πt)e^(-jωt)]dt - √2∫[sin(600πt)e^(-jωt)]dt\n\nLet's denote the first integral as I1 and the second integral as I2:\n\nI1 = ∫[cos(600πt)e^(-jωt)]dt\nI2 = ∫[sin(600πt)e^(-jωt)]dt\n\nUsing the integration by parts method, we can find the Fourier Transform of the output signal:\n\nI1 = (1/(jω + 600π))e^(-jωt)[jωcos(600πt) + 600πsin(600πt)] evaluated from -∞ to ∞\nI2 = (1/(jω - 600π))e^(-jωt)[-jωsin(600πt) + 600πcos(600πt)] evaluated from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier Transform of the output signal to get the input signal:\n\nx(t) = (1/2π)∫[Y(ω)e^(jωt)]dω\n\nSince the output signal is a sinusoidal signal with a frequency of 300 Hz, the input signal should also have the same frequency. Therefore, we can write the input signal as:\n\nx(t) = Acos(600πt + φ)\n\nTo find the amplitude A and phase φ of the input signal, we can compare the input signal x(t) with the output signal y(t):\n\nx(t) = Acos(600πt + φ) = √2cos(600πt) - √2sin(600πt)\n\nComparing the coefficients of the cosine and sine terms, we get:\n\nAcos(φ) = √2\nAsin(φ) = -√2\n\nDividing the second equation by the first equation, we get:\n\ntan(φ) = -1\n\nThus, φ = -π/4.\n\nNow, we can find the amplitude A using the first equation:\n\nAcos(-π/4) = √2\nA = 2\n\nSo, the amplitude and phase of the input signal are A = 2 and φ = -π/4."
