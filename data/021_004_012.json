    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nGiven a function f(x) = x^2, use a second-order forward finite difference method with a step size of h = 0.1 to approximate the derivative of f(x) at x = 1. \n\nHint: The formula for the second-order forward finite difference method is:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (-3f(x) + 4f(x+h) - f(x+2h)) / (2h)",
    "message_2": "To approximate the derivative of f(x) = x^2 at x = 1 using the second-order forward finite difference method, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate f(x) at x = 1, x + h, and x + 2h:\n   f(1) = 1^2 = 1\n   f(1.1) = (1.1)^2 = 1.21\n   f(1.2) = (1.2)^2 = 1.44\n\n2. Plug the values into the second-order forward finite difference formula:\n   f'(x) ≈ (-3f(x) + 4f(x+h) - f(x+2h)) / (2h)\n   f'(1) ≈ (-3(1) + 4(1.21) - 1.44) / (2 * 0.1)\n\n3. Calculate the result:\n   f'(1) ≈ (-3 + 4.84 - 1.44) / 0.2\n   f'(1) ≈ 0.4 / 0.2\n   f'(1) ≈ 2\n\nSo, using the second-order forward finite difference method with a step size of h = 0.1, the approximate derivative of f(x) = x^2 at x = 1 is 2."
