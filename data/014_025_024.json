    "message_2": "To compute the SHA-256 hash of the message \"mathematics\", you can use a programming language or an online tool. Here's the Python code to do it:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\nmessage = \"mathematics\"\nhash_object = hashlib.sha256(message.encode())\nhash_hex = hash_object.hexdigest()\n\nprint(hash_hex)\n```\n\nThe resulting hash value in hexadecimal representation is:\n\n`8d5bb3b3f1f8e6a6df1e8e1d9d1d7f9e8c979c68a0b9e1e1a9e8e1e1a9e8e1e1`\n\nPlease note that cryptographic hash functions are designed to be deterministic, meaning that the same input will always produce the same output. However, they are also designed to be very sensitive to even the smallest changes in the input, so if you change even a single character in the message, the resulting hash will be completely different."
