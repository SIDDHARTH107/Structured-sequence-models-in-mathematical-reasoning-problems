    "message_2": "Let's first consider a complete graph with 8 vertices (K8). The number of Hamiltonian cycles in a complete graph can be calculated using the formula (n-1)!/2, where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n = 8.\n\nSo, for K8, the number of Hamiltonian cycles is:\n(8-1)!/2 = 7!/2 = 5040/2 = 2520\n\nNow, we have a graph G with 8 vertices and edges between every pair of vertices except for one pair. This means that G is missing one edge compared to K8. Let's call the vertices missing the edge A and B.\n\nWhen we remove the edge between A and B, we are essentially removing all Hamiltonian cycles that include the edge (A, B). To find the number of Hamiltonian cycles that include the edge (A, B), we can consider A and B as a single \"combined\" vertex (AB). Now, we have a complete graph with 7 vertices (K7).\n\nThe number of Hamiltonian cycles in K7 is:\n(7-1)!/2 = 6!/2 = 720/2 = 360\n\nSo, there are 360 Hamiltonian cycles in K8 that include the edge (A, B). Since G is missing this edge, we need to subtract these cycles from the total number of Hamiltonian cycles in K8.\n\nThe number of Hamiltonian cycles in G is:\n2520 (K8) - 360 (cycles with edge A, B) = 2160\n\nTherefore, there are 2160 Hamiltonian cycles in the graph G with 8 vertices and edges between every pair of vertices except for one pair."
