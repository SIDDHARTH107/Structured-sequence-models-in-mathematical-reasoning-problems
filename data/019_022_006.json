Option 1 has a 50% chance of generating a profit of $10,000, a 30% chance of generating a profit of $5,000, and a 20% chance of generating no profit. Option 2 has a 40% chance of generating a profit of $12,000, a 40% chance of generating a profit of $4,000, and a 20% chance of generating no profit. Option 3 has a 60% chance of generating a profit of $6,000 and a 40% chance of generating no profit. Which option should the company choose based on expected value theory?",
    "message_2": "To determine which option the company should choose based on expected value theory, we need to calculate the expected value for each option. The expected value is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the value of that outcome and then summing the results.\n\nOption 1:\nExpected Value = (0.5 * $10,000) + (0.3 * $5,000) + (0.2 * $0)\nExpected Value = $5,000 + $1,500 + $0\nExpected Value = $6,500\n\nOption 2:\nExpected Value = (0.4 * $12,000) + (0.4 * $4,000) + (0.2 * $0)\nExpected Value = $4,800 + $1,600 + $0\nExpected Value = $6,400\n\nOption 3:\nExpected Value = (0.6 * $6,000) + (0.4 * $0)\nExpected Value = $3,600 + $0\nExpected Value = $3,600\n\nBased on expected value theory, the company should choose Option 1, as it has the highest expected value of $6,500."
