The distance between each location is given as follows:\n\n|           | Location A | Location B | Location C | Location D | Location E |\n|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Location A|    0       |   6        |   9        |   11       |   14       |\n| Location B|    6       |   0        |   4        |   6        |   8        |\n| Location C|    9       |   4        |   0        |   3        |   5        |\n| Location D|   11       |   6        |   3        |   0        |   3        |\n| Location E|   14       |   8        |   5        |   3        |   0        |\n\nWhat is the shortest distance for the courier to deliver all packages starting from Location A and returning to Location A?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance for the courier to deliver all packages starting from Location A and returning to Location A, we can use the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) approach. We will find the shortest route that visits each location exactly once and returns to the starting point.\n\nWe can solve this problem using the brute force method, which involves calculating the total distance for all possible routes and selecting the shortest one. There are 4! (4 factorial) possible routes since there are 4 other locations to visit (excluding the starting point).\n\nHere are all the possible routes and their total distances:\n\n1. A → B → C → D → E → A: 6 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 14 = 30\n2. A → B → C → E → D → A: 6 + 4 + 5 + 3 + 11 = 29\n3. A → B → D → C → E → A: 6 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 14 = 34\n4. A → B → D → E → C → A: 6 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 9 = 29\n5. A → B → E → C → D → A: 6 + 8 + 5 + 3 + 11 = 33\n6. A → B → E → D → C → A: 6 + 8 + 3 + 3 + 9 = 29\n\n7.

A → C → D → E → B → A: 9 + 3 + 3 + 8 + 6 = 29\n11. A → C → E → B → D → A: 9 + 5 + 8 + 6 + 11 = 39\n12. A → C → E → D → B → A: 9 + 5 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 29\n\n13. A → D → B → C → E → A: 11 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 14 = 40\n14. A → D → B → E → C → A: 11 + 6 + 8 + 5 + 9 = 39\n15. A → D → C → B → E → A: 11 + 3 + 4 + 8 + 14 = 40\n16. A → D → C → E → B → A: 11 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 6 = 33\n17. A → D → E → B → C → A: 11 + 3 + 8 + 4 + 9 = 35\n18. A → D → E → C → B → A: 11 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 6 = 29\n\n19. A → E → B → C → D → A: 14 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 11 = 40\n20. A → E → B → D → C → A: 14 + 8 + 6 + 3 + 9 = 40\n21. A → E → C → B → D → A: 14 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 11 = 40\n22.

A → E → D → C → B → A: 14 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 30\n\nThe shortest distance is 29, and there are four possible routes with this distance:\n\n1. A → B → C → E → D → A\n2. A → B → D → E → C → A\n3. A → B → E → D → C → A\n4. A → C → D → E → B → A\n\nSo, the shortest distance for the courier to deliver all packages starting from Location A and returning to Location A is 29."
