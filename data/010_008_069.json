    "message_2": "A simplex with 6 vertices in 3-dimensional space is a 5-simplex or a 5-dimensional simplex. To find the number of 2-dimensional faces (triangles) in a 5-simplex, we can use the binomial coefficient formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the number of vertices, k is the dimension of the face we are interested in, and C(n, k) is the number of k-dimensional faces in an n-simplex.\n\nIn this case, n = 6 and k = 3 (since a 2-dimensional face is a triangle, which has 3 vertices). So, we have:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\nC(6, 3) = 720 / (6 * 6)\nC(6, 3) = 720 / 36\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nSo, a 5-simplex with 6 vertices in 3-dimensional space has 20 2-dimensional faces (triangles)."
