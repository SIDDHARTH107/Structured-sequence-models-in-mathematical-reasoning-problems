    "message_2": "To find the Levi-Civita connection for the given metric tensor, we need to compute the Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols are given by the following formula:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} + \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l})$$\n\nSince the metric tensor is constant, all its partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates are zero:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} = \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} = \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} = 0$$\n\nTherefore, the Christoffel symbols are:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (0 + 0 - 0) = 0$$\n\nSo, all the Christoffel symbols are zero. This means that the Levi-Civita connection is flat, and there is no curvature in the manifold. The point $(1,2)$ does not affect the result, as the metric tensor is constant and independent of the coordinates."
