    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, N = 4 (each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller segments) and S = 3 (each segment is 1/3 the length of the original segment).\n\nD = log(4) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.261\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve that has gone through 6 iterations is approximately 1.261."
