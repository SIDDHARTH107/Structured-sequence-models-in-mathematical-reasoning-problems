    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to one of these groups, we will use the Sylow theorems and the structure of p-groups.\n\nSince the order of G is 32, which is 2^5, G is a 2-group. Let n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G. By the Sylow theorems, we know that n_2 must divide the order of G, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The only possibility for n_2 is 1, which means that G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which we will call P.\n\nSince P is the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of G, it must be normal in G. Now, we will analyze the structure of P. Since P is a group of order 2^5, it is a 2-group as well. By the classification of finite abelian groups, P must be isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C32 (cyclic group of order 32)\n2. C16 × C2\n3. C8 × C4\n4. C8 × C2 × C2\n5. C4 × C4 × C2\n6. C4 × C2 × C2 × C2\n7. C2 × C2 × C2 × C2 × C2\n\nNow, we will analyze each case to determine if G can be isomorphic to any of the given groups.\n\nCase 1: P is isomorphic to C32.\nIn this case, G has a normal subgroup of order 32, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C32. Since G has order 32 and there is a normal cyclic subgroup of order 32, G must be isomorphic to C32.\n\nCase 2: P is isomorphic to C16 × C2.\nIn this case, G has a normal subgroup of order 16, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16. Since G has order 32 and there is a normal cyclic subgroup of order 16, G must be isomorphic to the dihedral group D16.\n\nCases 3-7: P is isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 32.\nIn each of these cases, G has a normal subgroup P of order 32, which is isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32. Since G has order 32 and there is a normal non-abelian subgroup of order 32, G must be isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nIn conclusion, without more information about the group G, we cannot determine which specific group G is isomorphic to. However, we have shown that G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32."
