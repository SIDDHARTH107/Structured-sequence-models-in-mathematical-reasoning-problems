    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral of the function f(z) = (2z-1) / (z^2 + 9) along the closed contour C, we will use the method of residues. First, we need to find the poles of the function inside the contour C. The poles are the solutions of the denominator equal to zero:\n\nz^2 + 9 = 0\nz^2 = -9\nz = ±3i\n\nSince the contour C lies in the upper half of the complex plane, only the pole z = 3i is inside the contour. Now, we need to find the residue of the function at this pole. The residue of a function at a simple pole z = z0 is given by:\n\nRes(f(z), z0) = lim (z → z0) [(z - z0) * f(z)]\n\nIn our case, z0 = 3i, and f(z) = (2z-1) / (z^2 + 9). So, we have:\n\nRes(f(z), 3i) = lim (z → 3i) [(z - 3i) * (2z-1) / (z^2 + 9)]\n\nTo find the limit, we can use L'Hopital's rule, which states that if the limit of the ratio of two functions is of the form 0/0 or ∞/∞, then the limit of their derivatives is the same. In our case, we have:\n\nlim (z → 3i) [(z - 3i) * (2z-1) / (z^2 + 9)] = lim (z → 3i) [d(2z-1)/dz / d(z^2 + 9)/dz]\n\nTaking the derivatives, we get:\n\nd(2z-1)/dz = 2\nd(z^2 + 9)/dz = 2z\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limit:\n\nlim (z → 3i) [2 / (2 * 3i)] = 2 / (6i) = 1/3i\n\nNow that we have the residue, we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral. The residue theorem states that the integral of a function around a closed contour is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function inside the contour:\n\n∮C f(z) dz = 2πi * Σ Res(f(z), z0)\n\nIn our case, we have only one pole inside the contour, z = 3i, and its residue is 1/3i. So, we have:\n\n∮C f(z) dz = 2πi * (1/3i) = 2πi * (-i/3) = 2π * (-i^2) / 3 = (2π/3) * 1 = 2π/3\n\nTherefore, the integral of the function f(z) = (2z-1) / (z^2 + 9) along the closed contour C is equal to 2π/3."
