    "message_2": "The Gaussian curvature (K) of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nK = 1/R^2\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius (R) of the sphere is 10 cm, we can calculate the Gaussian curvature as follows:\n\nK = 1/(10^2)\nK = 1/100\nK = 0.01\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature at any point on the surface of the sphere is 0.01 cm^(-2)."
