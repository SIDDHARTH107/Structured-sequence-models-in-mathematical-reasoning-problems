    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism? (Round your answer to the nearest tenth)",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal squared is equal to the sum of the squares of the length, width, and height:\n\nDiagonal² = Length² + Width² + Height²\n\nIn this case, the length is 5 cm, the width is 4 cm, and the height is 3 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nDiagonal² = 5² + 4² + 3²\nDiagonal² = 25 + 16 + 9\nDiagonal² = 50\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 50 to get the length of the diagonal:\n\nDiagonal = √50 ≈ 7.1\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 7.1 cm (rounded to the nearest tenth)."
