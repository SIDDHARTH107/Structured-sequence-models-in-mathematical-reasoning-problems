    "message_1": "Consider the surface given by the equation x² + y² + z² = 4. What is the mean curvature of this surface at the point (1, 1, √2)?",
    "message_2": "The given surface is a sphere with radius 2 centered at the origin. The equation of the sphere is x² + y² + z² = 4. To find the mean curvature, we first need to find the principal curvatures k1 and k2. For a sphere, the principal curvatures are equal and can be found using the formula:\n\nk1 = k2 = 1/R\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, R = 2, so the principal curvatures are:\n\nk1 = k2 = 1/2\n\nNow, we can find the mean curvature (H) using the formula:\n\nH = (k1 + k2) / 2\n\nH = (1/2 + 1/2) / 2\n\nH = 1/2\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1, 1, √2) is 1/2."
