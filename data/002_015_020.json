    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (also known as the circumference) of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nC = 2πr\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the radius is 3 cm. So, we plug the values into the formula:\n\nC = 2 × 3.14159 × 3\n\nC ≈ 18.84954 cm\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 18.85 cm."
