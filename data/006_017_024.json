    "message_2": "To find the probability of a fatal accident occurring on this particular road, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of fatal accidents) / (Total number of accidents)\n\nIn this case, the number of fatal accidents is 10 and the total number of accidents is 1000. So the probability is:\n\nProbability = 10 / 1000 = 0.01\n\nTherefore, the probability of a fatal accident occurring on this road is 0.01, or 1%."
