    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape created by recursively removing cubes from an initial cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the whole structure are removed. This process is repeated for the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nThe formula to calculate the volume of a Menger sponge after n iterations is:\n\nV = a^3 * (20/27)^n\n\nwhere V is the volume, a is the side length of the initial cube, and n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, a = 27 cm and n = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = 27^3 * (20/27)^4\nV = 19683 * (20/27)^4\nV ≈ 19683 * 0.1602\nV ≈ 3153.24 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the Menger sponge after 4 iterations is approximately 3153.24 cubic centimeters."
