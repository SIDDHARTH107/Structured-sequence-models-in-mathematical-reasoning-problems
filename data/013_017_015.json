The value of a lemon to a buyer is $5,000 and the value of a non-lemon is $10,000. Assume that the seller of the car knows whether the car is a lemon or non-lemon but the buyer does not. What is the expected value of a used car purchased from the market?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of a used car purchased from the market, we need to multiply the value of each type of car by its probability of being sold and then sum the results.\n\nExpected value = (Value of a lemon * Probability of a lemon being sold) + (Value of a non-lemon * Probability of a non-lemon being sold)\n\nExpected value = ($5,000 * 0.6) + ($10,000 * 0.4)\n\nExpected value = $3,000 + $4,000\n\nExpected value = $7,000\n\nThe expected value of a used car purchased from the market is $7,000."
