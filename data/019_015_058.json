    "message_2": "To write a type-correct function in type theory that takes no arguments and returns a natural number equal to the sum of every pair of numbers in A that the function f can produce, we can define the function as follows:\n\nLet A be a type such that A = {n ∈ ℕ | n < 10}, where ℕ represents the set of natural numbers.\n\nLet f : A × A → ℕ be a function such that f(a, b) = a + b for all a, b ∈ A.\n\nNow, we define the function sumPairs : 1 → ℕ as follows:\n\nsumPairs(∗) = Σ(a, b ∈ A × A) f(a, b)\n\nHere, 1 is the unit type with a single element ∗, and Σ denotes the sum over all pairs (a, b) in A × A.\n\nThe function sumPairs takes no arguments (except the single element of the unit type) and returns a natural number equal to the sum of every pair of numbers in A that the function f can produce."
