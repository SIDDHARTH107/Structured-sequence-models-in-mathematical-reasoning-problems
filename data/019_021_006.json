    "message_1": "A group of four players are playing a simultaneous game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each player chooses one of these options at the same time without knowing the other players' choices. Each player earns 1 point for a win, 0 points for a tie, and -1 point for a loss. The following table shows the number of points that each player earns based on the pairs of their choices.\n\n|   | Rock | Paper | Scissors |\n|---|------|-------|----------|\n| Rock | 0 | -1 | 1 |\n| Paper | 1 | 0 | -1 |\n| Scissors | -1 | 1 | 0 |\n\nIf each player chooses their option randomly with equal probability, what is the expected number of points that each player will get?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of points for each player, we need to consider all possible combinations of choices and their probabilities. Since there are 3 choices for each of the 4 players, there are 3^4 = 81 possible combinations.\n\nLet's analyze the possible outcomes for a single player, say Player 1. We will calculate the probabilities of Player 1 getting 1 point, 0 points, and -1 point, and then find the expected value.\n\n1. Player 1 gets 1 point:\nThis happens when Player 1's choice beats exactly one other player's choice, and the other two players choose the option that Player 1's choice loses to. There are 3 ways this can happen (R-P-S, P-S-R, or S-R-P, where R is Rock, P is Paper, and S is Scissors). For each of these cases, there are 3! = 6 possible orderings of the other players' choices. So there are 3 * 6 = 18 combinations where Player 1 gets 1 point.\n\nProbability of getting 1 point = 18/81\n\n2. Player 1 gets 0 points:\nThis happens when all four players choose the same option or when there are two pairs of different choices (e.g., R-R-P-P). There are 3 combinations for the first case (all Rocks, all Papers, or all Scissors) and 3 combinations for the second case (R-R-P-P, P-P-S-S, or S-S-R-R).\n\nProbability of getting 0 points = (3 + 3)/81\n\n3. Player 1 gets -1 point:\nThis happens when Player 1's choice loses to exactly one other player's choice, and the other two players choose the option that Player 1's choice wins against. Similar to the case of getting 1 point, there are 3 ways this can happen (P-R-S, S-P-R, or R-S-P), and for each of these cases, there are 3! = 6 possible orderings of the other players' choices. So there are 3 * 6 = 18 combinations where Player 1 gets -1 point.\n\nProbability of getting -1 point = 18/81\n\nNow we can calculate the expected value for Player 1:\n\nExpected value = (1 point * Probability of getting 1 point) + (0 points * Probability of getting 0 points) + (-1 point * Probability of getting -1 point)\nExpected value = (1 * 18/81) + (0 * 6/81) + (-1 * 18/81)\nExpected value = (18 - 18)/81 = 0\n\nSince the game is symmetric, the expected number of points for each player is also 0."
