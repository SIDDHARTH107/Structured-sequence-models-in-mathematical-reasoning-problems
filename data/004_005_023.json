    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order linear differential equation y' + y = 2x with the initial condition y(0) = 1, we will first find the integrating factor and then solve for the particular solution.\n\n1. Find the integrating factor (IF):\nThe integrating factor is given by the formula IF = e^(∫P(x)dx), where P(x) is the coefficient of y in the given differential equation. In this case, P(x) = 1.\n\nIF = e^(∫1 dx) = e^x\n\n2. Multiply the given differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^x (y' + y) = e^x (2x)\n\nExpanding, we get:\n\ne^x y' + e^x y = 2x e^x\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product of y and the integrating factor (e^x y) with respect to x:\n\n(d/dx) (e^x y) = 2x e^x\n\n3. Integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(d/dx) (e^x y) dx = ∫2x e^x dx\n\nTo integrate the right side, we will use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 2x, dv = e^x dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = e^x\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula, ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du:\n\n∫2x e^x dx = 2x e^x - ∫2 e^x dx\n\nNow, integrate the remaining term:\n\n2x e^x - 2 ∫e^x dx = 2x e^x - 2e^x + C\n\nSo, we have:\n\ne^x y = 2x e^x - 2e^x + C\n\n4. Solve for y:\n\ny = 2x - 2 + Ce^(-x)\n\n5. Apply the initial condition y(0) = 1:\n\n1 = 2(0) - 2 + Ce^(0)\n1 = -2 + C\nC = 3\n\n6. Write the particular solution:\n\ny(x) = 2x - 2 + 3e^(-x)\n\nSo, the particular solution to the given initial value problem is y(x) = 2x - 2 + 3e^(-x)."
