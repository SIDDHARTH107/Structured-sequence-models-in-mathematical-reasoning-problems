    "message_2": "To calculate the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one triangle, then multiply it by 6 (since there are 6 triangles in a hexagon).\n\nThe formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is (side^2 * √3) / 4. In this case, the side length is 5 cm.\n\nArea of one equilateral triangle = (5^2 * √3) / 4\nArea of one equilateral triangle = (25 * √3) / 4\n\nNow, multiply the area of one triangle by 6 to find the area of the hexagon:\n\nArea of hexagon = 6 * (25 * √3) / 4\nArea of hexagon = (150 * √3) / 4\nArea of hexagon ≈ 64.95 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the regular hexagon with a side length of 5 cm is approximately 64.95 cm²."
