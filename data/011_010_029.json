    "message_2": "The Catalan numbers formula is not applicable to this problem. Instead, we can solve this problem using simple permutations.\n\nSince there are 4 different plays and each play can be performed on a different day, we can use the formula for permutations to find the number of ways to schedule the plays:\n\nNumber of ways = 4! (4 factorial)\n\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n\nSo, there are 24 different ways to schedule the 4 plays over the course of a week, ensuring that no two plays are performed on the same day."
