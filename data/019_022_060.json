The net profit (in thousands of dollars) for each possible outcome is shown in the table below:\n\n| Outcome  | Profit |\n|----------|--------|\n| Success  | 120    |\n| Failure  | -30    |\n\nIf there is a 60% chance of success and a 40% chance of failure, what is the expected profit for this investment?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected profit, we need to multiply the profit of each outcome by its probability and then sum the results. \n\nExpected Profit = (Probability of Success * Profit of Success) + (Probability of Failure * Profit of Failure)\n\nExpected Profit = (0.60 * 120) + (0.40 * -30)\n\nExpected Profit = (72) + (-12)\n\nExpected Profit = 60\n\nThe expected profit for this investment is $60,000."
