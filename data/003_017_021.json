    "message_2": "To find the average value of a continuous function on a given interval, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b - a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, f(x) = sin(x), a = 0, and b = π. So we have:\n\nAverage value = (1/(π - 0)) * ∫[0, π] sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of sin(x) from 0 to π:\n\n∫[0, π] sin(x) dx = [-cos(x)] from 0 to π\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n[-cos(π) - (-cos(0))] = [(-1) - (-1)] = 2\n\nNow, plug this value back into the average value formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/π) * 2 = 2/π\n\nSo, the average value of f(x) = sin(x) on the interval [0, π] is 2/π."
