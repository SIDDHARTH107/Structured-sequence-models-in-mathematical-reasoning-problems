    "message_2": "The provided solution is incorrect. Let's solve the problem again.\n\nA torus with two holes is a surface of genus 2. The Euler characteristic of a surface of genus g can be calculated using the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nFor a torus with two holes (genus 2), we have:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(2) = 2 - 4 = -2\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of a torus with two holes is -2."
