    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides, which measure 12cm and 14 cm, and the angle between them is 67 degrees. Find the area of the triangle using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C)\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the two sides (12 cm and 14 cm), and C is the angle between them (67 degrees).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (67 degrees) * (π / 180) ≈ 1.169 radians\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 12 cm * 14 cm * sin(1.169 radians) ≈ 84.0 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 84.0 cm²."
