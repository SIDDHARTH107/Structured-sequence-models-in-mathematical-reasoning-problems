If $a_k$ is the number of critical points of index $k$ in $f$, then Morse inequalities state that:\n$$a_0-a_1+a_2-\\cdots +(-1)^g a_{2g}\\geq 1-g,$$\nwhere $g$ is the genus of $\\Sigma_g$. \n\nConsider a surface of genus $2$ and a Morse function $f:\\Sigma_2\\to\\mathbb{R}$ with $8$ critical points of index $0$ and $5$ critical points of index $1$. How many critical points of index $2$ should $f$ have, for the Morse inequalities to be satisfied?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of critical points of index $2$ as $a_2$. We are given that $a_0 = 8$ and $a_1 = 5$. Since the surface has genus $2$, the Morse inequalities state that:\n\n$$a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - \\cdots + (-1)^4 a_{4} \\geq 1 - 2$$\n\nSince there are no critical points of index greater than $2$ in this case, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n$$8 - 5 + a_2 \\geq -1$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $a_2$:\n\n$$a_2 \\geq -1 - 3$$\n$$a_2 \\geq -4$$\n\nHowever, since $a_2$ represents the number of critical points, it must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the smallest possible value for $a_2$ that satisfies the Morse inequalities is $0$."
