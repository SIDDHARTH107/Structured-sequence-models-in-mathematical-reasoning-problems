    "message_2": "The function φ(n) is the Euler's totient function, which counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nWe are given that φ(n) = 12. We will find the possible values of n by considering the prime factorization of n and using the formula for the Euler's totient function:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nCase 1: n has only one prime factor.\nLet n = p^a, where p is prime and a is a positive integer. Then,\n\n12 = φ(n) = p^a * (1 - 1/p).\n\nSince 12 is not a prime power, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: n has two prime factors.\nLet n = p1^a1 * p2^a2, where p1 and p2 are distinct primes and a1, a2 are positive integers. Then,\n\n12 = φ(n) = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2).\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n12 = (p1^a1 - p1^(a1-1)) * (p2^a2 - p2^(a2-1)).\n\nNow, we consider the possible factor pairs of 12: (1, 12), (2, 6), and (3, 4).\n\n1. (1, 12): This gives p1^a1 - p1^(a1-1) = 1 and p2^a2 - p2^(a2-1) = 12. The first equation implies that p1 = 2 and a1 = 1. The second equation implies that p2^a2 - p2^(a2-1) = 12, which has no solution for prime p2 and positive integer a2.\n\n2. (2, 6): This gives p1^a1 - p1^(a1-1) = 2 and p2^a2 - p2^(a2-1) = 6. The first equation implies that p1 = 2 and a1 = 2. The second equation implies that p2^a2 - p2^(a2-1) = 6, which has a solution p2 = 3 and a2 = 1. Thus, n = 2^2 * 3^1 = 12 is a possible value.\n\n3. (3, 4): This gives p1^a1 - p1^(a1-1) = 3 and p2^a2 - p2^(a2-1) = 4. The first equation implies that p1 = 3 and a1 = 1. The second equation implies that p2^a2 - p2^(a2-1) = 4, which has a solution p2 = 2 and a2 = 3. Thus, n = 3^1 * 2^3 = 24 is a possible value.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of n are 12 and 24."
