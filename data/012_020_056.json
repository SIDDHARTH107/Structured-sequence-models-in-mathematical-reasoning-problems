    "message_2": "The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all graph automorphisms (i.e., isomorphisms from the graph to itself). In other words, it is the set of all permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relations between the vertices.\n\nFor the given graph, we can find the following automorphisms:\n\n1. Identity: A -> A, B -> B, C -> C, D -> D, E -> E\n2. Swap A and C: A -> C, B -> B, C -> A, D -> E, E -> D\n3. Swap D and E: A -> A, B -> B, C -> C, D -> E, E -> D\n4. Swap A and C, and swap D and E: A -> C, B -> B, C -> A, D -> E, E -> D\n\nThese are the only automorphisms that preserve the adjacency relations between the vertices. Therefore, the automorphism group of the given graph is a group with 4 elements, which can be represented as {Identity, Swap A and C, Swap D and E, Swap A and C and swap D and E}."
