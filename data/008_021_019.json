    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we first need to check if the matrix is singular. A matrix is singular if its determinant is zero. Let's find the determinant of the matrix formed by the coefficients of the variables.\n\nThe matrix A is:\n\n| 1  2 -3 |\n| 3 -6  9 |\n| 2  4 -6 |\n\nTo find the determinant, we can use the first row:\n\ndet(A) = 1 * det( | -6  9 | ) - 2 * det( | 3  9 | ) + (-3) * det( | 3 -6 | )\n              = 1 * (-6 * (-6) - 9 * 9) - 2 * (3 * (-6) - 9 * 9) + (-3) * (3 * 4 - 6 * (-6))\n\ndet(A) = 1 * (36 - 81) - 2 * (-18 - 81) - 3 * (12 + 36)\n          = 1 * (-45) + 2 * 99 - 3 * 48\n          = -45 + 198 - 144\n          = 9\n\nSince the determinant of the matrix A is not zero (det(A) = 9), the matrix is not singular. Therefore, we can proceed to solve the system of linear equations using the Cramer's rule or Gaussian elimination method.\n\nHowever, if you meant to solve the system of linear equations with a singular matrix, then this system does not meet that condition, as the matrix is not singular."
