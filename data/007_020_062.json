Choose a public key exponent e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1\n4. Compute the encrypted message c = m^e mod n, where m is the message\n\nGiven p = 11, q = 13, e = 7, and m = 5, let's perform these steps:\n\n1. n = p * q = 11 * 13 = 143\n2. φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (11-1) * (13-1) = 10 * 12 = 120\n3. e is already given as 7, and gcd(7, 120) = 1\n4. c = m^e mod n = 5^7 mod 143\n\nNow, let's compute 5^7 mod 143:\n\n5^7 = 78125\n78125 mod 143 = 67\n\nSo, the encrypted message c that Alice sends to Bob is 67."
