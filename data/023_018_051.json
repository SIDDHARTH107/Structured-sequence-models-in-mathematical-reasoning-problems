    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the system to a periodic input signal with frequency 0.5 Hz, we first need to represent the input signal as a Fourier series. Since the input signal is a periodic signal with frequency 0.5 Hz, we can represent it as a sinusoidal function:\n\nx(t) = A * sin(2 * pi * 0.5 * t)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the input signal.\n\nNow, we need to find the Laplace transform of the input signal:\n\nX(s) = L{x(t)} = L{A * sin(2 * pi * 0.5 * t)}\n\nUsing the Laplace transform formula for sine function:\n\nX(s) = A * (2 * pi * 0.5) / (s^2 + (2 * pi * 0.5)^2)\n\nNow, we can find the output signal Y(s) in the Laplace domain by multiplying the transfer function G(s) with the input signal X(s):\n\nY(s) = G(s) * X(s) = (s + 2) / (s^2 + 3s + 2) * A * (2 * pi * 0.5) / (s^2 + (2 * pi * 0.5)^2)\n\nTo find the steady-state response, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s):\n\ny(t) = L^(-1){Y(s)}\n\nBefore finding the inverse Laplace transform, we need to simplify the expression for Y(s). The transfer function G(s) can be factored as:\n\nG(s) = (s + 2) / ((s + 1)(s + 2)) = 1 / (s + 1)\n\nSo, Y(s) becomes:\n\nY(s) = (1 / (s + 1)) * A * (2 * pi * 0.5) / (s^2 + (2 * pi * 0.5)^2)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s):\n\ny(t) = L^(-1){(1 / (s + 1)) * A * (2 * pi * 0.5) / (s^2 + (2 * pi * 0.5)^2)}\n\nUsing the convolution theorem and the inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s+a) and 1/(s^2+b^2):\n\ny(t) = A * (2 * pi * 0.5) * e^(-t) * sin(2 * pi * 0.5 * t)\n\nThis is the steady-state response of the system to a periodic input signal with frequency 0.5 Hz."
