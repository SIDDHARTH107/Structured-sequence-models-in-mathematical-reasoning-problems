    "message_1": "Two competing gas stations are located on opposite sides of a highway, each deciding independently of the other their gas prices for the day. The price each station sets is denoted by a positive number. If they both set the same gas price, they will split the customers equally. But, if one station lowers its price, more customers will go to that station. Assume that the number of customers at each station is directly proportional to the difference in gas prices. If station A sets its gasoline price at $x, and station B sets its gasoline price at $y$, then the profit (in dollars) for station A is $(x-y)(200-4x)$ and for station B is $(y-x)(200-4y)$. Find the Nash Equilibrium of this game.\n\nPlease find the gas prices for station A and station B at Nash Equilibrium.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash Equilibrium, we need to find the gas prices for station A and station B such that neither station has an incentive to change its price, given the other station's price.\n\nFirst, let's find the best response for station A, given station B's price y. To do this, we need to maximize station A's profit function with respect to x:\n\nProfit_A = (x - y)(200 - 4x)\n\nTo maximize this, we can take the derivative with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Profit_A)/dx = (200 - 4x)(1) + (x - y)(-4) = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = (200 - 4y + 4y)/4 = 50\n\nNow, let's find the best response for station B, given station A's price x. To do this, we need to maximize station B's profit function with respect to y:\n\nProfit_B = (y - x)(200 - 4y)\n\nTo maximize this, we can take the derivative with respect to y and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Profit_B)/dy = (200 - 4y)(1) + (y - x)(-4) = 0\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = (200 - 4x + 4x)/4 = 50\n\nSo, the Nash Equilibrium occurs when both station A and station B set their gas prices at $50."
