    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the total Gaussian curvature of a surface S to its Euler characteristic χ(S) and can be expressed as:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ(S)\n\nwhere K is the Gaussian curvature and dA is the area element.\n\nFor a sphere of radius r, the Gaussian curvature K is constant and equal to 1/r^2. In our case, r = 5, so K = 1/25.\n\nNow, we need to find the Euler characteristic χ(S) of the surface S. Since S is a portion of a sphere, it is topologically equivalent to a sphere with some number of holes or handles. Let's denote the number of holes by h. The Euler characteristic of a surface with h holes is given by:\n\nχ(S) = 2 - 2h\n\nNow we can substitute the values of K and χ(S) into the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\n∫∫_S (1/25) dA = 2π(2 - 2h)\n\nTo solve for the area of the surface S, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nArea(S) = ∫∫_S dA = 50π(2 - 2h)\n\nHowever, without more information about the number of holes h or the specific shape of the surface S, we cannot determine the exact area or the Gauss-Bonnet theorem value for S."
