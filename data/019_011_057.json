    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem related to relevance logic:\n\nLet's consider two statements: \n\n- Statement A: \"If John gets an A in his math test, he will go to the cinema.\"\n- Statement B: \"John got an A in his math test.\"\n\nUsing relevance logic, determine whether the following statement is true or false:\n\n- Statement C: \"John went to the cinema.\"\n\nAnswer: \n\nIn relevance logic, Statement C is considered true only if Statement A is relevant to Statement B, i.e., if there is a logical connection between the two. \n\nIn this case, we can see that Statement A does have a logical connection to Statement B, since it describes a conditional relationship between John getting an A and going to the cinema, and Statement B affirms that John did in fact get an A. So, using relevance logic, we can conclude that Statement C is true: John went to the cinema.",
    "message_2": "Answer:\n\nUsing relevance logic, we can conclude that Statement C is true: John went to the cinema. This is because Statement A has a logical connection to Statement B, as it describes a conditional relationship between John getting an A and going to the cinema, and Statement B confirms that John did indeed get an A."
