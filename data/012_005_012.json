    "message_1": "A student is given a graph with 12 vertices and 20 edges. What is the diameter of the graph?",
    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. To find the diameter, we need more information about the structure of the graph. The number of vertices and edges alone is not enough to determine the diameter. \n\nIf you can provide more information about the graph, such as the adjacency matrix or a list of connected vertices, I can help you find the diameter."
