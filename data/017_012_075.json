    "message_2": "There are five distinct groups of order 16 up to isomorphism. These are:\n\n1. Cyclic group C16\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, C4 x C4\n3. Direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and a cyclic group of order 8, C2 x C8\n4. Dihedral group D8\n5. Non-abelian group of order 16, also known as the Quaternion group Q16\n\nNow, let's show that every group of order 16 belongs to one of these isomorphism classes.\n\nLet G be a group of order 16. Since 16 = 2^4, G is a p-group for p = 2. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G is equal to 1 mod 2 and divides 16. Therefore, G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup. Since G is a p-group, it has a non-trivial center Z(G). Let x be an element of Z(G) with order 2. Then, the order of G/Z(G) is 8.\n\nThere are two groups of order 8 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group C8 and the dihedral group D4. If G/Z(G) is isomorphic to C8, then G is isomorphic to a group of the form C2 x C8. If G/Z(G) is isomorphic to D4, then G is either isomorphic to D8 or Q16.\n\nNow, let's prove that the non-abelian group of order 16 (Q16) is not isomorphic to either C16 or D8.\n\nQ16 is not isomorphic to C16 because Q16 is non-abelian, while C16 is abelian.\n\nTo show that Q16 is not isomorphic to D8, we can compare their structures. Q16 has the presentation:\n\nQ16 = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k | i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1}\n\nD8 has the presentation:\n\nD8 = {r, s | r^4 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(-1)}\n\nQ16 has every non-identity element of order 4, while D8 has elements of order 2 and 4. Since the orders of elements in a group are preserved under isomorphism, Q16 and D8 cannot be isomorphic.\n\nThus, we have shown that every group of order 16 belongs to one of the five isomorphism classes mentioned above, and the non-abelian group of order 16 (Q16) is not isomorphic to either C16 or D8."
