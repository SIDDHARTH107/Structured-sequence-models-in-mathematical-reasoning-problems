    "message_1": "A pizza has a diameter of 16 inches. You cut out a slice that measures 60 degrees. What is the area of this slice of pizza?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the slice of pizza, we can use the formula for the area of a sector of a circle: \n\nArea of sector = (Central angle/360) * π * r^2\n\nIn this case, the diameter of the pizza is 16 inches, so the radius (r) is half of that, which is 8 inches. The central angle of the slice is 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (60/360) * π * 8^2\nArea of sector = (1/6) * π * 64\nArea of sector = (64π)/6\n\nThe area of the slice of pizza is (64π)/6 square inches."
