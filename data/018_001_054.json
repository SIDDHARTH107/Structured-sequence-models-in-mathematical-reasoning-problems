    "message_2": "Yes, the empty set ∅ is a subset of set A.\n\nProof: By definition, a set B is a subset of set A (denoted as B ⊆ A) if every element of B is also an element of A. The empty set ∅ contains no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in ∅ that are not in A. Consequently, the empty set ∅ is a subset of set A (and of any other set)."
