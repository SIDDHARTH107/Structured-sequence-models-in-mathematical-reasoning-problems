    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between points. In this case, we are looking for transformations that preserve the metric $g = dx^2 + 4dy^2$ and map the point $(1,1)$ to $(3,5)$. \n\nLet's consider a general transformation $(x', y') = (f(x, y), g(x, y))$. The metric in the transformed coordinates is given by:\n\n$g' = (dx')^2 + 4(dy')^2 = (f_x dx + f_y dy)^2 + 4(g_x dx + g_y dy)^2$\n\nHere, $f_x = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$, $f_y = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$, $g_x = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}$, and $g_y = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}$.\n\nFor the transformation to be an isometry, we must have $g' = g$, which implies:\n\n$(f_x)^2 + 4(g_x)^2 = 1$\n$(f_y)^2 + 4(g_y)^2 = 4$\n$f_x f_y + 4g_x g_y = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find functions $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$ that satisfy these conditions and map $(1,1)$ to $(3,5)$. Let's consider linear transformations of the form:\n\n$f(x, y) = ax + by + c$\n$g(x, y) = dx + ey + f$\n\nApplying the transformation to the point $(1,1)$, we get:\n\n$3 = a + b + c$\n$5 = d + e + f$\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives:\n\n$f_x = a$\n$f_y = b$\n$g_x = d$\n$g_y = e$\n\nSubstituting these into the conditions for an isometry, we get:\n\n$a^2 + 4d^2 = 1$\n$b^2 + 4e^2 = 4$\n$ab + 4de = 0$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the possible values of $a, b, d, e$. One possible solution is:\n\n$a = 1, b = 0, d = 0, e = 1$\n\nThis corresponds to the transformation:\n\n$f(x, y) = x + c$\n$g(x, y) = y + f$\n\nSubstituting the point $(1,1)$, we get:\n\n$c = 2$\n$f = 4$\n\nSo, the transformation is:\n\n$f(x, y) = x + 2$\n$g(x, y) = y + 4$\n\nThis is a translation by the vector $(2, 4)$, which is an isometry of the given metric. There may be other isometries, but this is one example that maps $(1,1)$ to $(3,5)$."
