    "message_2": "To find a formula for a(n) in terms of n, let's first look at the first few terms of the sequence:\n\na(0) = 1\na(1) = 2*a(0) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3\na(2) = 2*a(1) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7\na(3) = 2*a(2) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15\na(4) = 2*a(3) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31\n\nWe can observe a pattern here. The terms of the sequence are one less than the powers of 2:\n\na(0) = 2^1 - 1 = 1\na(1) = 2^2 - 1 = 3\na(2) = 2^3 - 1 = 7\na(3) = 2^4 - 1 = 15\na(4) = 2^5 - 1 = 31\n\nSo, the formula for a(n) in terms of n is:\n\na(n) = 2^(n+1) - 1"
