    "message_2": "To find the conformal mapping of the unit circle |z| < 1 onto the region bounded by the line segments [-1, 1] on the real axis and [0, i] on the imaginary axis, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Map the unit circle to the upper half-plane using the MÃ¶bius transformation:\n   w = (z - i)/(z + i)\n\n2. Map the upper half-plane to the right half-plane using the transformation:\n   u = w^2\n\n3. Map the right half-plane to the desired region using the transformation:\n   v = (u - 1)/2\n\nThe final conformal mapping is the composition of these three transformations:\nv(z) = (((z - i)/(z + i))^2 - 1)/2\n\nThis mapping will map the unit circle |z| < 1 onto the region bounded by the line segments [-1, 1] on the real axis and [0, i] on the imaginary axis."
