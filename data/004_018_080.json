    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^5, we will use the power rule. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nIn this case, f(x) = 4x^5, so n = 5. Applying the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 5 * 4x^(5-1)\nf'(x) = 20x^4\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^5 is f'(x) = 20x^4."
