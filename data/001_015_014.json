    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to rewrite the equation in a way that isolates x. We can do this by taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation. In this case, we will use the base 2 logarithm (log₂) since the equation involves 2 raised to a power.\n\n2^(x+1) = 16\n\nApplying log₂ to both sides:\n\nlog₂(2^(x+1)) = log₂(16)\n\nUsing the logarithm property that states logₐ(a^b) = b, we can simplify the left side of the equation:\n\nx + 1 = log₂(16)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of log₂(16). Since 2^4 = 16, we know that log₂(16) = 4.\n\nx + 1 = 4\n\nFinally, we can solve for x by subtracting 1 from both sides:\n\nx = 4 - 1\nx = 3\n\nSo, the solution to the equation 2^(x+1) = 16 is x = 3."
