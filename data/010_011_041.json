    "message_2": "To construct a smooth manifold structure on M, we need to cover M with a collection of open sets and provide smooth coordinate charts for each of these open sets. We will use stereographic projection to do this.\n\nConsider two open sets U1 and U2, where U1 is the set of all points in M with x3 ≠ 1 and U2 is the set of all points in M with x3 ≠ -1. Notice that U1 and U2 cover M, as any point on the unit sphere will have x3 ≠ 1 or x3 ≠ -1.\n\nNow, we define two stereographic projections from M to R^2:\n\n1. For a point x = (x1, x2, x3) in U1, define the map φ1: U1 → R^2 by φ1(x) = (x1 / (1 - x3), x2 / (1 - x3)).\n2. For a point x = (x1, x2, x3) in U2, define the map φ2: U2 → R^2 by φ2(x) = (x1 / (1 + x3), x2 / (1 + x3)).\n\nThese maps are smooth, and their inverses are also smooth:\n\n1. For a point (u, v) in R^2, the inverse map φ1^(-1): R^2 → U1 is given by φ1^(-1)(u, v) = ((2u) / (u^2 + v^2 + 1), (2v) / (u^2 + v^2 + 1), (u^2 + v^2 - 1) / (u^2 + v^2 + 1)).\n2. For a point (u, v) in R^2, the inverse map φ2^(-1): R^2 → U2 is given by φ2^(-1)(u, v) = ((2u) / (u^2 + v^2 + 1), (2v) / (u^2 + v^2 + 1), (-u^2 - v^2 + 1) / (u^2 + v^2 + 1)).\n\nNow, we need to show that the transition map φ2 ◦ φ1^(-1) is smooth. The transition map is defined on φ1(U1 ∩ U2) and maps to φ2(U1 ∩ U2). Let (u, v) ∈ φ1(U1 ∩ U2), then:\n\nφ2 ◦ φ1^(-1)(u, v) = φ2(φ1^(-1)(u, v)) = φ2(((2u) / (u^2 + v^2 + 1), (2v) / (u^2 + v^2 + 1), (u^2 + v^2 - 1) / (u^2 + v^2 + 1))).\n\nBy substituting the expressions for φ2 and φ1^(-1), we get:\n\nφ2 ◦ φ1^(-1)(u, v) = ((4u(u^2 + v^2 - 1)) / ((u^2 + v^2 + 1)^2 - 4(u^2 + v^2)), (4v(u^2 + v^2 - 1)) / ((u^2 + v^2 + 1)^2 - 4(u^2 + v^2))).\n\nThis transition map is smooth, as the denominator is never zero on φ1(U1 ∩ U2).\n\nThus, we have constructed a smooth manifold structure on M using the open sets U1 and U2 and the smooth coordinate charts φ1 and φ2. Since M is a smooth 2-dimensional manifold embedded in R^3, it is diffeomorphic to S^2, the surface of a unit sphere in R^3."
