    "message_2": "To compute the second Chern class c2(Y) of the complex submanifold Y, we can use the adjunction formula. The adjunction formula relates the Chern classes of a submanifold Y and its ambient manifold X. In our case, Y has codimension 2 in X, so the normal bundle of Y in X has rank 2.\n\nThe adjunction formula states that:\n\nc(TY) = c(TX) * c(NYX),\n\nwhere c(TY) and c(TX) are the total Chern classes of the tangent bundles of Y and X, respectively, and c(NYX) is the total Chern class of the normal bundle of Y in X.\n\nNow, let's compute the total Chern classes of the tangent bundles:\n\nc(TX) = 1 + c1(X) + c2(X) = 1 + 3H + c2(X),\nc(TY) = 1 + c1(Y) + c2(Y) = 1 + 2H + c2(Y).\n\nNext, we need to compute the total Chern class of the normal bundle c(NYX). Since the normal bundle has rank 2, we can write:\n\nc(NYX) = 1 + a + b,\n\nwhere a and b are the first Chern classes of the two line bundles that make up the normal bundle.\n\nNow, we can use the adjunction formula:\n\n1 + 2H + c2(Y) = (1 + 3H + c2(X)) * (1 + a + b).\n\nExpanding the right-hand side, we get:\n\n1 + 2H + c2(Y) = 1 + (3H + a + b) + (3H + a)(3H + b) + c2(X)(1 + a + b).\n\nComparing the coefficients of H, we have:\n\n2 = 3 + a + b.\n\nThus, a + b = -1.\n\nNow, let's compare the coefficients of H^2:\n\n0 = 9 + 3(a + b) + ab.\n\nSubstituting a + b = -1, we get:\n\n0 = 9 - 3 + ab,\n\nwhich implies that ab = -6.\n\nFinally, let's compare the coefficients of H^3:\n\nc2(Y) = c2(X) + (3H + a)(3H + b).\n\nSince Y has codimension 2 in X, we know that c2(Y) is a multiple of H^2. Therefore, we can write c2(Y) = kH^2 for some integer k.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nkH^2 = c2(X) - 6H^2.\n\nThus, c2(Y) = (c2(X) - 6H^2).\n\nIn summary, to find the second Chern class c2(Y) of the complex submanifold Y, we need to know the second Chern class c2(X) of the ambient manifold X. Then, we can compute c2(Y) using the formula:\n\nc2(Y) = c2(X) - 6H^2."
