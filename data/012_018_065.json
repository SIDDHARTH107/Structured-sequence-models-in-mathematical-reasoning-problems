    "message_2": "To disconnect the graph into two components, we need to find a cut vertex or cut edge that, when removed, will separate the graph into two disconnected subgraphs.\n\nLet's consider the best-case scenario, where the graph is a tree (i.e., it has no cycles). In a tree with n vertices, there are n-1 edges. In our case, with 8 vertices, there would be 7 edges. However, our graph has 12 edges, which means there are at least 5 additional edges that form cycles.\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario, where the graph is a complete graph (i.e., every vertex is connected to every other vertex). In a complete graph with n vertices, there are n*(n-1)/2 edges. In our case, with 8 vertices, there would be 8*7/2 = 28 edges. Since our graph has only 12 edges, it is not a complete graph.\n\nGiven that our graph has 8 vertices and 12 edges, it must have at least one cycle. To disconnect the graph into two components, we need to break this cycle. In the worst-case scenario, we would need to remove all the edges of the cycle. However, since the graph is not complete, there must be at least one vertex that is not part of the cycle. By removing the edge connecting this vertex to the cycle, we can disconnect the graph into two components.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed from the graph to disconnect it into two components is 1."
