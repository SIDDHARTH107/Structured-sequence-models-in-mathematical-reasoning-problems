    "message_2": "To find the non-abelian groups of order 36, we first examine the prime factorization of 36, which is 2^2 * 3^2. Now, we will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups and their structures.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, by Sylow's third theorem, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 9. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup, which is then normal. If n_2 = 9, the 2-Sylow subgroups are not normal.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, by Sylow's third theorem, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 = 4, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be either 1 or 4. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, which is then normal. If n_3 = 4, the 3-Sylow subgroups are not normal.\n\nNow, we consider the following cases:\n\n1. Both 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups are normal: In this case, the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which are both abelian (C_4 and C_9). The direct product of abelian groups is abelian, so this case does not give us a non-abelian group.\n\n2. The 2-Sylow subgroup is normal, and the 3-Sylow subgroup is not normal (n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4): In this case, we have a semidirect product of the normal 2-Sylow subgroup (C_4) and the 3-Sylow subgroup (C_9). There is only one non-trivial automorphism of C_4, which is inversion. There are two possible actions of C_9 on C_4: the trivial action and the action by inversion. The trivial action results in the direct product, which is abelian, so we discard it. The action by inversion gives us a non-abelian group, which we denote as G_1.\n\n3. The 2-Sylow subgroup is not normal, and the 3-Sylow subgroup is normal (n_2 = 9, n_3 = 1): In this case, we have a semidirect product of the normal 3-Sylow subgroup (C_9) and the 2-Sylow subgroup (C_4 or C_2 × C_2). There are six automorphisms of C_9, forming a group isomorphic to C_6. We have the following possibilities:\n\n  a) C_4 acting on C_9: There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from C_4 to the automorphism group of C_9, which is C_6. This gives us a non-abelian group, which we denote as G_2.\n\n  b) C_2 × C_2 acting on C_9: There are three non-trivial homomorphisms from C_2 × C_2 to the automorphism group of C_9, which is C_6. However, two of them are equivalent up to isomorphism, so we have two distinct non-abelian groups in this case, which we denote as G_3 and G_4.\n\n4. Both 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups are not normal (n_2 = 9, n_3 = 4): In this case, neither of the Sylow subgroups is normal, so we cannot form a semidirect product. However, this case is not possible, as a group of order 36 must have a normal Sylow subgroup (by the Sylow theorems).\n\nIn conclusion, there are 3 non-abelian groups of order 36 up to isomorphism: G_1, G_2, G_3, and G_4."
