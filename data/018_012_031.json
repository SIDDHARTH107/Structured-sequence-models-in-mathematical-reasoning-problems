    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A x B. A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find (A x B) ∩ {1}. Since {1} is not a set of ordered pairs, the intersection of (A x B) and {1} is the empty set, as there are no common elements between the two sets.\n\n(A x B) ∩ {1} = ∅\n\nNext, let's find (A x B) ∩ {2}. Similar to the previous step, the intersection of (A x B) and {2} is the empty set, as there are no common elements between the two sets.\n\n(A x B) ∩ {2} = ∅\n\nNow, let's find {(A x B) ∩ {2}} x B. Since (A x B) ∩ {2} = ∅, the Cartesian product of the empty set and B is also the empty set.\n\n{(A x B) ∩ {2}} x B = ∅ x B = ∅\n\nNow, we want to show that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection. To do this, we need to show that (A x B) ∩ C ≠ A x (B ∩ C) for some set C.\n\nLet C = {1, 2}. Then, B ∩ C = {2}.\n\nNow, let's find A x (B ∩ C):\n\nA x (B ∩ C) = A x {2} = {(1, 2), (2, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find (A x B) ∩ C:\n\n(A x B) ∩ C = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)} ∩ {1, 2} = ∅\n\nSince (A x B) ∩ C ≠ A x (B ∩ C), the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
