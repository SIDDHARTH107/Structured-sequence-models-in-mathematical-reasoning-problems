    "message_1": "A group of 10 volunteers are needed for a charity event. Each volunteer will receive a $20 gift card as compensation for their time. If only 5 volunteers show up, the event will be canceled and no one will receive the gift card. However, if all 10 volunteers show up, each volunteer will receive a bonus $10 gift card. If a volunteer knows that at least 3 other volunteers will show up, they will attend the event. What is the probability that all 10 volunteers will show up at the event?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the conditions under which each volunteer will attend the event. Since a volunteer will attend the event if they know that at least 3 other volunteers will show up, we can think of this as a chain reaction.\n\nLet's assume that the first 3 volunteers decide to attend the event. Once they have committed to attending, the 4th volunteer knows that at least 3 other volunteers will show up, so they will also attend. This continues for each subsequent volunteer, as each one knows that at least 3 other volunteers are attending.\n\nSince the first 3 volunteers are the key to starting this chain reaction, we need to calculate the probability that these 3 volunteers will decide to attend. Since each volunteer has 2 choices (attend or not attend), there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations of decisions for the first 3 volunteers. Only one of these combinations involves all 3 volunteers deciding to attend, so the probability of this happening is 1/8.\n\nOnce the first 3 volunteers have decided to attend, the rest of the volunteers will also attend, as they know that at least 3 other volunteers are attending. Therefore, the probability that all 10 volunteers will show up at the event is 1/8 or 12.5%."
