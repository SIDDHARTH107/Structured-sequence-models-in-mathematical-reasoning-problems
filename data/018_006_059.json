    "message_2": "To prove that the union of A and its complement (A') equals the universal set U, we need to show that every element in U is either in A or A', and that there are no elements in the union that are not in U.\n\nFirst, let's find the complement of A with respect to U. The complement of A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nA' = {6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the union of A and A'. The union of two sets contains all the elements that are in either of the sets.\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ∪ {6, 7} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nWe can see that the union of A and A' contains all the elements in the universal set U, and there are no elements in the union that are not in U. Therefore, we have proven that A and A complement union equals U."
