    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is Eulerian, we need to check if all vertices have an even degree. Since there are 8 vertices and 12 edges, let's try to distribute the degrees evenly among the vertices.\n\nLet's denote the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. We can distribute the degrees as follows:\n\nA: 4, B: 4, C: 2, D: 2, E: 4, F: 4, G: 2, H: 2\n\nNow, let's create a graph with these degrees:\n\nEdges: AB, AE, AF, BC, BE, BF, CD, DE, DF, EG, FG, GH\n\nAll vertices have an even degree, so the graph is Eulerian.\n\nAn Eulerian circuit for this graph can be:\n\nA -> B -> C -> D -> E -> A -> F -> B -> E -> G -> F -> H -> G\n\nTo determine if the graph is Hamiltonian, we need to find a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. We can try to find a Hamiltonian cycle for the graph:\n\nA -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> H -> A\n\nThis is a Hamiltonian cycle for the graph.\n\nIn conclusion, the graph is both Eulerian and Hamiltonian. The Eulerian circuit is A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> A -> F -> B -> E -> G -> F -> H -> G, and the Hamiltonian cycle is A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> H -> A."
