    "message_2": "a) To find the rational points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 4x, we can use the method of descent. First, we note that the point (0,0) is a rational point on the curve. Next, we consider the line y = mx + b that passes through (0,0) and another rational point (x', y') on the curve. We have:\n\ny^2 = (mx + b)^2 = x^3 + 4x\n\nSubstituting y = mx + b and x = 0, we get b = 0. So, the line is y = mx. Now, we substitute y = mx in the elliptic curve equation:\n\n(m^2)x^2 = x^3 + 4x\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nx^3 - m^2x^2 + 4x = 0\n\nFactoring out x, we have:\n\nx(x^2 - m^2x + 4) = 0\n\nSince x = 0 is already a rational point, we focus on the quadratic factor:\n\nx^2 - m^2x + 4 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nx = (m^2 ± √(m^4 - 16))/2\n\nFor x to be rational, the discriminant (m^4 - 16) must be a perfect square. Let m^4 - 16 = n^2 for some rational number n. Then, we have:\n\nm^4 - n^2 = 16\n\nThis is a difference of squares, so we can factor it as:\n\n(m^2 - n)(m^2 + n) = 16\n\nNow, we consider the divisors of 16: (1, 16), (2, 8), and (4, 4). Solving these systems of linear equations, we find the following rational values for (m, n):\n\n(1) m^2 - n = 1, m^2 + n = 16: m^2 = 8.5, which is not rational.\n(2) m^2 - n = 2, m^2 + n = 8: m^2 = 5, n = 3, m = ±√5\n(3) m^2 - n = 4, m^2 + n = 4: m^2 = 4, n = 0, which is not possible.\n\nSo, the only possible rational value for m is ±√5. Substituting this value into the equation for x, we get:\n\nx = (5 ± √(5^4 - 16))/2 = (5 ± 3)/2\n\nThis gives us two rational values for x: x = 1 and x = 4. Substituting these values back into the equation y = mx, we find the corresponding rational points on the elliptic curve:\n\nFor x = 1: y = ±√5\nFor x = 4: y = ±4√5\n\nThus, the rational points on the elliptic curve are (0, 0), (1, √5), (1, -√5), (4, 4√5), and (4, -4√5).\n\nb) To find a birational transformation that maps the elliptic curve to a circle, we can use the Weierstrass normal form. The given elliptic curve is already in the form y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B, with A = 0 and B = 4. The Weierstrass normal form is:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + Ax + B = (x^2 + u^2)(x^2 + v^2)\n\nWe want to find a rational transformation (x, y) -> (u, v) such that the equation holds. We can try the following transformation:\n\nu = x/y\nv = y/x\n\nSolving for x and y, we get:\n\nx = uv/(u^2 + v^2)\ny = (u^2 - v^2)/(u^2 + v^2)\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the elliptic curve equation, we get:\n\n((u^2 - v^2)^2)/(u^2 + v^2)^2 = (u^2v^2)/(u^2 + v^2)^2 + 4(uv/(u^2 + v^2))\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(u^2 - v^2)^2 = u^2v^2 + 4(u^2 + v^2)(uv)^2\n\nThis equation represents a circle in the (u, v)-plane. Thus, the birational transformation (x, y) -> (u, v) with x = uv/(u^2 + v^2) and y = (u^2 - v^2)/(u^2 + v^2) maps the elliptic curve to a circle."
