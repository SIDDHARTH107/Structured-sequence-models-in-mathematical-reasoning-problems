    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by iteratively filling the interstices between mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. In this case, we start with three mutually tangent circles of radius 1.\n\nLet's denote the curvature of a circle as k, which is the reciprocal of its radius (k = 1/r). For the three initial circles, their curvatures are k1 = k2 = k3 = 1.\n\nNow, we can use Descartes' Circle Theorem to find the curvature of the next circle that is tangent to the initial three circles. Descartes' Circle Theorem states that for four mutually tangent circles with curvatures k1, k2, k3, and k4, the following equation holds:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n\nWe know k1, k2, and k3, so we can solve for k4:\n\n(1 + 1 + 1 + k4)^2 = 2(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + k4^2)\n(3 + k4)^2 = 2(3 + k4^2)\n9 + 6k4 + k4^2 = 6 + 2k4^2\nk4^2 - 6k4 + 3 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get two possible values for k4:\n\nk4 = 3 ± 2√3\n\nThe positive solution corresponds to the circle inside the initial three circles, and the negative solution corresponds to the circle that encloses the initial three circles. Since we are constructing an Apollonian gasket, we are interested in the positive solution:\n\nk4 = 3 + 2√3\n\nNow, we can continue this process to find the curvatures of all the circles in the Apollonian gasket. However, it's important to note that the Apollonian gasket is a fractal, and the process of adding circles can continue infinitely. Therefore, the total number of circles needed to construct an Apollonian gasket is infinite."
