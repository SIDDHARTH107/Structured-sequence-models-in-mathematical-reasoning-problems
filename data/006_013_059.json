    "message_1": "A region has a 0.05 probability of experiencing a severe flood in any given year. What is the probability that the region will not have a severe flood in the next 10 years?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the region not having a severe flood in the next 10 years, we first need to find the probability of not having a flood in a single year. Since the probability of having a severe flood in any given year is 0.05, the probability of not having a severe flood in a single year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of not having a severe flood for 10 consecutive years. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of not having a flood in each individual year:\n\n0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.95^10 â‰ˆ 0.5987\n\nSo, the probability of the region not having a severe flood in the next 10 years is approximately 0.5987 or 59.87%."
