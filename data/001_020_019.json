    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |2x-4| = 6, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 4 = 6\nIn this case, we solve for x:\n2x = 6 + 4\n2x = 10\nx = 5\n\nCase 2: 2x - 4 = -6\nIn this case, we also solve for x:\n2x = -6 + 4\n2x = -2\nx = -1\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation |2x-4| = 6 are x = 5 and x = -1."
