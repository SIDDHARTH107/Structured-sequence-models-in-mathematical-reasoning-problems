    "message_1": "In a company, it is found that the probability of an accident happening in a particular department is 0.25. If there are 10 departments in the company, what is the probability that at least one department will experience an accident?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability concept. Instead of finding the probability of at least one department experiencing an accident, we can find the probability of no department experiencing an accident and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThe probability of no accident happening in a particular department is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.\n\nSince there are 10 departments, the probability of no accident happening in all 10 departments is (0.75)^10 = 0.0563 (rounded to four decimal places).\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one department experiencing an accident by subtracting the probability of no accidents from 1:\n\n1 - 0.0563 = 0.9437\n\nSo, the probability that at least one department will experience an accident is 0.9437, or 94.37%."
