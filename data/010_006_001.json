Let Y be the topological space obtained from X by adding another line segment to the same point on the circle where the earlier segment was attached. Determine the fundamental group of Y.",
    "message_2": "To determine the fundamental group of Y, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. Let's first analyze the topological space Y.\n\nY can be visualized as a circle with two line segments (rays) attached to the same point on the circle. Let's denote the circle as A, and the two line segments as B and C. The intersection of A, B, and C is a single point, which we'll call P.\n\nNow, let's apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. We need to find the fundamental groups of A, B, and C, as well as their pairwise intersections.\n\n1. The fundamental group of A (the circle) is isomorphic to the integers, denoted as π1(A) ≅ Z. This is because a circle has one hole, and the fundamental group counts the number of times a loop wraps around the hole.\n\n2. The fundamental groups of B and C (the line segments) are trivial, denoted as π1(B) ≅ π1(C) ≅ {1}. This is because line segments are contractible and have no holes.\n\n3. The pairwise intersections of A, B, and C are all the single point P. The fundamental group of a single point is trivial, denoted as π1(A ∩ B) ≅ π1(A ∩ C) ≅ π1(B ∩ C) ≅ {1}.\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The fundamental group of Y, denoted as π1(Y), is given by the following free product with amalgamation:\n\nπ1(Y) ≅ (π1(A) * π1(B) * π1(C)) / N\n\nwhere N is the normal subgroup generated by the relations a*b*c = 1 for a in π1(A ∩ B), b in π1(A ∩ C), and c in π1(B ∩ C).\n\nSince π1(B) and π1(C) are trivial, the free product simplifies to:\n\nπ1(Y) ≅ (π1(A) * {1} * {1}) / N ≅ π1(A) / N\n\nSince π1(A) ≅ Z, we have:\n\nπ1(Y) ≅ Z / N\n\nNow, we need to determine the normal subgroup N. Since the fundamental groups of the pairwise intersections are all trivial, the only relation we have is:\n\nN = <1>\n\nThus, the normal subgroup N is trivial, and we have:\n\nπ1(Y) ≅ Z / <1> ≅ Z\n\nSo, the fundamental group of the topological space Y is isomorphic to the integers, π1(Y) ≅ Z."
