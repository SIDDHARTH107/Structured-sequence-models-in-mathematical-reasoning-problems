    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, at each iteration, the square is divided into 5 smaller squares, so N = 5. The scaling factor s is the number of smaller squares along one side of the larger square, which is 3 for the Vicsek fractal.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Vicsek fractal is:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nThe number of iterations and the size of the initial square do not affect the Hausdorff dimension, as it is a property of the fractal itself. Therefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is approximately 1.465, regardless of the initial square size and the number of iterations."
