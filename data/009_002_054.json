    "message_1": "A town has a population of 100,000 and is facing an outbreak of an infectious disease. The rate at which new cases are reported is proportional to the number of people who are contagious, with a constant of proportionality 0.0025. At the start of the outbreak, there were 100 contagious individuals. How many people will be infected after 10 days?",
    "message_2": "We can model the growth of the number of infected individuals using a differential equation. Let I(t) be the number of infected individuals at time t (in days). The rate of change of I(t) with respect to time is proportional to the number of contagious individuals, so we have:\n\ndI/dt = k * I(t)\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality, which is given as 0.0025. This is a first-order linear differential equation, and its solution is:\n\nI(t) = I(0) * e^(kt)\n\nwhere I(0) is the initial number of infected individuals (100) and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nWe want to find the number of infected individuals after 10 days, so we need to find I(10):\n\nI(10) = 100 * e^(0.0025 * 10)\n\nI(10) = 100 * e^0.025\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nI(10) ≈ 100 * 1.02532 ≈ 102.532\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a person, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nI(10) ≈ 103\n\nAfter 10 days, approximately 103 people will be infected in the town."
