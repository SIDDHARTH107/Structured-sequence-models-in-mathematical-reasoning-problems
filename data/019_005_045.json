    "message_1": "Let's assume that there are four mathematicians, A, B, C, and D, in a room. Each of them wears a hat, which can either be black or white. The color of their hats is known to everyone except for themselves. They predict the color of their hats in the following way:\n\n- A predicts the color of B's hat\n- B predicts the color of C's hat\n- C predicts the color of D's hat\n- D predicts the color of A's hat\n\nIf all four mathematicians miraculously guess the color of their hats correctly, how many of them guessed that their hat was white?",
    "message_2": "This problem is impossible. Here's why:\n\nLet's say A's hat is white and B's hat is black. Then A would predict B's hat is black, which is correct. But B would predict C's hat is white, since B sees A's white hat. If C's hat is indeed white, then C would predict D's hat is black, since C sees A's white hat and B's black hat. But D would predict A's hat is white, since D sees B's black hat and C's white hat. This would mean that A guessed the color of their own hat, which is not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, if A's hat is black and B's hat is white, then A would predict B's hat is white, which is correct. But B would predict C's hat is black, since B sees A's black hat. If C's hat is indeed black, then C would predict D's hat is white, since C sees A's black hat and B's white hat. But D would predict A's hat is black, since D sees B's white hat and C's black hat. This would mean that A guessed the color of their own hat, which is not allowed.\n\nIn both cases, A ends up guessing the color of their own hat, which is not allowed by the problem's conditions. Therefore, it is impossible for all four mathematicians to guess the color of their hats correctly."
