    "message_1": "In a country with a population of 10 million people, a survey showed that 60% of the population supports the incumbent political party. What is the probability that if a random sample of 1,000 people is taken, at least 550 of them will support the incumbent political party?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution is appropriate here because we have a fixed number of trials (1,000 people), each with two possible outcomes (support or not support the incumbent party), and a constant probability of success (60% support).\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the binomial distribution. The mean is given by:\n\nμ = n * p\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (1,000 people) and p is the probability of success (0.6).\n\nμ = 1,000 * 0.6 = 600\n\nThe standard deviation is given by:\n\nσ = sqrt(n * p * (1 - p))\n\nσ = sqrt(1,000 * 0.6 * 0.4) = sqrt(240) ≈ 15.49\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that at least 550 people support the incumbent party, which means we want to find the probability of X ≥ 550. To do this, we can use the normal distribution's z-score to approximate the probability.\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nz = (550 - 600) / 15.49 ≈ -3.23\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score less than or equal to -3.23 is approximately 0.0006. However, since we want the probability of X ≥ 550, we need to find the complement of this probability.\n\nP(X ≥ 550) = 1 - P(X < 550) = 1 - 0.0006 = 0.9994\n\nSo, the probability that at least 550 people in the random sample of 1,000 will support the incumbent political party is approximately 0.9994 or 99.94%."
