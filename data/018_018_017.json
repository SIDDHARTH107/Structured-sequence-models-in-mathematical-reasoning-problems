    "message_2": "A △ B represents the symmetric difference between sets A and B. It contains elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. To find A △ B, we can list out the elements that are unique to each set:\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find B △ A:\n\nB △ A = {6, 7, 1, 2}\n\nBoth results contain the same elements, just listed in a different order. So, yes, both results match."
