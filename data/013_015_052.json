    "message_1": "Suppose a principal hires an agent to perform a task. The outcome of the task can be either success or failure, and the agent has a 60% chance of success and a 40% chance of failure. The principal assigns a cost of $10 to success and a cost of $20 to failure. What should the principal pay the agent if the agent completes the task and the principal wants to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the payment to the agent as P. The principal's profit will be the difference between the cost of success or failure and the payment to the agent.\n\nIf the agent succeeds, the principal's profit will be:\nProfit_success = Cost_success - P = $10 - P\n\nIf the agent fails, the principal's profit will be:\nProfit_failure = Cost_failure - P = $20 - P\n\nSince there is a 60% chance of success and a 40% chance of failure, we can calculate the expected profit for the principal as follows:\n\nExpected_profit = (0.6 * Profit_success) + (0.4 * Profit_failure)\n\nSubstitute the profit equations into the expected profit equation:\n\nExpected_profit = (0.6 * ($10 - P)) + (0.4 * ($20 - P))\n\nNow, we want to maximize the expected profit with respect to the payment P. To do this, we can take the derivative of the expected profit equation with respect to P and set it to zero:\n\nd(Expected_profit)/dP = -0.6 - 0.4 = -1\n\nSince the derivative is constant and negative, the expected profit will decrease as the payment P increases. Therefore, to maximize the profit, the principal should pay the agent the lowest possible amount, which is $0. However, in practice, the principal would need to pay the agent a reasonable amount to incentivize them to perform the task. The exact amount would depend on the specific situation and negotiation between the principal and the agent."
