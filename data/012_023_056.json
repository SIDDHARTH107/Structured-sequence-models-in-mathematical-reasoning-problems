    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (i.e., a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge).\n\nTo find the clique number of G, we need to find the largest complete subgraph in the given adjacency matrix.\n\nFirst, let's identify the complete subgraphs of size 3 (triangles):\n\n1. Vertices 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle (since they are all connected to each other).\n2. Vertices 4, 5, and 6 form a triangle.\n\nNow, let's check for complete subgraphs of size 4:\n\n1. Vertices 1, 3, 4, and 7 form a complete subgraph of size 4 (since they are all connected to each other).\n\nWe can stop here because a graph with 7 vertices cannot have a complete subgraph of size larger than 4 without having a smaller complete subgraph (which would be a contradiction).\n\nTherefore, the clique number of G is 4."
