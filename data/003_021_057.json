    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors A and B, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe dot product of A and B is given by:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nWhere θ is the angle between the vectors, |A| is the magnitude of vector A, and |B| is the magnitude of vector B.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of A and B:\n\nA · B = (2 * 3) + (5 * 7) = 6 + 35 = 41\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of A and B:\n\n|A| = √(2^2 + 5^2) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n|B| = √(3^2 + 7^2) = √(9 + 49) = √58\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula and solve for the angle θ:\n\n41 = √29 * √58 * cos(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by √29 * √58:\n\ncos(θ) = 41 / (√29 * √58)\n\nNow, find the inverse cosine (arccos) to get the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(41 / (√29 * √58))\n\nθ ≈ 0.724 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, multiply by (180/π):\n\nθ ≈ 0.724 * (180/π) ≈ 41.5 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors A and B is approximately 41.5 degrees."
