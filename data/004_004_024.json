    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x^2 and above the x-axis between x = 0 and x = 2, we need to evaluate the definite integral of the function y = x^2 with respect to x from 0 to 2.\n\nThe integral of x^2 with respect to x is (x^3)/3 + C, where C is the constant of integration. However, since we are evaluating a definite integral, we don't need to worry about the constant.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the limits of integration:\n\nâˆ«(x^2)dx from 0 to 2 = [(2^3)/3] - [(0^3)/3] = (8/3) - (0/3) = 8/3\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curve y = x^2, the x-axis, and the lines x = 0 and x = 2 is 8/3 square units."
