    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. The production of A requires 5 hours of work and the production of B requires 3 hours of work. The factory can allocate a maximum of 40 hours per week for production. The profit of each unit of A is $10 and the profit of each unit of B is $15. \n\nWhat is the optimal production schedule for the factory to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The total hours of work constraint can be represented as:\n\n5x + 3y ≤ 40\n\nThe profit function to be maximized is:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nTo find the optimal production schedule, we will first find the feasible region of the constraint and then evaluate the profit function at the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region:\n\n5x + 3y ≤ 40\ny ≤ (40 - 5x) / 3\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative (you can't produce a negative number of products), we have the following constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow we'll find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0: (0, 0)\n2. Intersection of x = 0 and y = (40 - 5x) / 3: (0, 40/3)\n3. Intersection of y = 0 and x = 8 (when 5x = 40): (8, 0)\n\nNow we'll evaluate the profit function at these vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 40/3) = 10(0) + 15(40/3) = $200\n3. P(8, 0) = 10(8) + 15(0) = $80\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 40/3), which means the factory should produce 0 units of product A and 40/3 ≈ 13.33 units of product B. However, since the factory can only produce whole units, it should produce 13 units of product B. This will result in a profit of 13 * $15 = $195."
