    "message_2": "First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n[ 3  2 -1 |  8 ]\n[ 2 -1  3 | -1 ]\n[ 4  1  1 |  3 ]\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we will perform the following row operations:\nR2 = R2 - (2/3)R1\nR3 = R3 - (4/3)R1\n\n[ 3   2  -1 |  8  ]\n[ 0  -3   5 | -7  ]\n[ 0  -1   3 | -5  ]\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo do this, we will perform the following row operation:\nR3 = R3 - (1/3)R2\n\n[ 3   2  -1 |  8  ]\n[ 0  -3   5 | -7  ]\n[ 0   0   2 | -4  ]\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nThe third row represents the equation 2z = -4. Dividing both sides by 2, we get z = -2.\n\nStep 4: Back-substitute to find y.\n\nThe second row represents the equation -3y + 5z = -7. Substituting the value of z, we get -3y + 5(-2) = -7. Solving for y, we get y = 1.\n\nStep 5: Back-substitute to find x.\n\nThe first row represents the equation 3x + 2y - z = 8. Substituting the values of y and z, we get 3x + 2(1) - (-2) = 8. Solving for x, we get x = 1.\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 1, and z = -2."
