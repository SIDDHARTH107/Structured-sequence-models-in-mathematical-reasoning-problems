    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Monte Carlo simulation, we will simulate the process of shipping 1000 products per day many times and count the number of times there are more than 120 defective products. The probability can then be estimated as the ratio of the number of times there are more than 120 defective products to the total number of simulations.\n\nLet's perform the simulation for 100,000 trials:\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries (numpy and random).\n2. Set the parameters (number of products per day, defective rate, number of trials, and threshold for defective products).\n3. Initialize a counter for the number of times there are more than 120 defective products.\n4. Run the simulation for 100,000 trials.\n5. Calculate the probability.\n\nHere's the Python code for the simulation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\n\nnum_products = 1000\ndefective_rate = 0.1\nnum_trials = 100000\ndefective_threshold = 120\n\n# Initialize the counter for the number of times there are more than 120 defective products\nnum_days_over_threshold = 0\n\n# Run the simulation for 100,000 trials\nfor _ in range(num_trials):\n    # Simulate the shipping of 1000 products with a 10% defective rate\n    defective_products = np.random.binomial(num_products, defective_rate)\n    \n    # Check if the number of defective products is greater than 120\n    if defective_products > defective_threshold:\n        num_days_over_threshold += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprobability = num_days_over_threshold / num_trials\n```\n\nAfter running the simulation, we can estimate the probability of having more than 120 defective products shipped in a certain day:\n\n```python\nprint(f\"The probability of shipping more than 120 defective products in a day is approximately {probability:.4f}\")\n```\n\nThe estimated probability will vary slightly each time the simulation is run, but it should be close to the true probability."
