    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(3,3) is the smallest number of vertices needed in a graph to guarantee that there is either a triangle with all edges of the same color or a triangle with all edges of different colors. R(3,3) is equal to 6. This means that in a graph with 6 vertices, there will always be either a monochromatic triangle (all edges of the same color) or a triangle with all edges of different colors."
