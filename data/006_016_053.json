    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces a certain product with a defect rate of 5%. If a customer orders 500 of these products, what is the probability that at least 25 of them will have a defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective products\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the total number of products (in this case, 500)\n- k is the number of defective products (in this case, we want at least 25)\n- p is the probability of a product being defective (in this case, 0.05)\n- 1-p is the probability of a product not being defective (in this case, 0.95)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having at least 25 defective products, we need to find the sum of the probabilities of having 25, 26, 27, ..., 500 defective products. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = 1 - P(X < 25) = 1 - Σ[P(X = k)] for k = 0 to 24\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probabilities for each value of k and sum them up:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = 1 - Σ[C(500, k) * 0.05^k * 0.95^(500-k)] for k = 0 to 24\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so it's best to use software or a calculator with a built-in binomial probability function to find the answer.\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find that:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) ≈ 0.9826\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25 of the 500 products will have a defect is approximately 98.26%."
