    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 1 meter is initially at a temperature of 20°C. The left end of the rod is kept at a constant temperature of 50°C while the right end is kept at a constant temperature of 30°C. Use Fourier transform to find the temperature distribution along the rod after 30 seconds if the diffusion coefficient of the metal is 0.1 m²/s.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution along the rod, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with the given boundary conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the diffusion coefficient (0.1 m²/s in this case).\n\nBoundary conditions:\nT(0,t) = 50°C (left end)\nT(1,t) = 30°C (right end)\n\nInitial condition:\nT(x,0) = 20°C\n\nTo solve this problem using Fourier transform, we first need to find the steady-state solution, which is the temperature distribution when the system reaches equilibrium. This can be found by setting ∂T(x,t)/∂t = 0:\n\n0 = α ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nThe steady-state solution is a linear function of x:\n\nT_steady(x) = Ax + B\n\nUsing the boundary conditions, we can find A and B:\n\nT_steady(0) = 50 => B = 50\nT_steady(1) = 30 => A + B = 30 => A = -20\n\nSo, T_steady(x) = -20x + 50\n\nNow, we need to find the transient solution, which is the difference between the actual temperature and the steady-state temperature:\n\nT_transient(x,t) = T(x,t) - T_steady(x)\n\nThe transient solution satisfies the following equation:\n\n∂T_transient(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²T_transient(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwith boundary conditions:\n\nT_transient(0,t) = 0\nT_transient(1,t) = 0\n\nand initial condition:\n\nT_transient(x,0) = -20x + 30\n\nWe can solve this equation using separation of variables and Fourier series:\n\nT_transient(x,t) = ∑[B_n * sin(nπx) * exp(-α(nπ)²t)]\n\nwhere B_n are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nTo find B_n, we use the initial condition:\n\n-20x + 30 = ∑[B_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nWe can find B_n by multiplying both sides by sin(mπx) and integrating from 0 to 1:\n\nB_m = 2 * ∫[-20x * sin(mπx) + 30 * sin(mπx)] dx from 0 to 1\n\nAfter integrating and simplifying, we get:\n\nB_m = (40/π²m²) * (1 - (-1)^m)\n\nNow, we can write the transient solution:\n\nT_transient(x,t) = ∑[(40/π²m²) * (1 - (-1)^m) * sin(mπx) * exp(-α(nπ)²t)]\n\nFinally, the temperature distribution along the rod is the sum of the steady-state and transient solutions:\n\nT(x,t) = T_steady(x) + T_transient(x,t)\n\nT(x,30) = -20x + 50 + ∑[(40/π²m²) * (1 - (-1)^m) * sin(mπx) * exp(-0.1(nπ)²*30)]\n\nThis is the temperature distribution along the rod after 30 seconds."
