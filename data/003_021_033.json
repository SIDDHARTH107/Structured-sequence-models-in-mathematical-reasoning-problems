    "message_2": "To find the vector product (cross product) of two vectors A and B, we can use the formula:\n\n|A x B| = |A| * |B| * sin(θ)\n\nwhere |A x B| is the magnitude of the cross product, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nGiven that the magnitudes of A and B are 8 and 11, respectively, and the angle between them is 45 degrees, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n|A x B| = 8 * 11 * sin(45)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n45 degrees = 45 * (π/180) radians ≈ 0.7854 radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the sine of the angle:\n\nsin(0.7854) ≈ 0.7071\n\nFinally, we can find the magnitude of the cross product:\n\n|A x B| = 8 * 11 * 0.7071 ≈ 62.2256\n\nSo, the magnitude of the vector product (cross product) of the two vectors A and B is approximately 62.23."
