    "message_1": "A traveling salesman needs to visit 5 different cities for business purposes. The distances (in miles) between each city are as follows: city 1 to city 2 = 10, city 1 to city 3 = 15, city 1 to city 4 = 20, city 1 to city 5 = 25, city 2 to city 3 = 35, city 2 to city 4 = 30, city 2 to city 5 = 20, city 3 to city 4 = 40, city 3 to city 5 = 25, city 4 to city 5 = 30. What is the shortest possible route the salesman could take to visit all 5 cities and return to the starting city?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible route, we can use the brute force method by calculating the total distance for each possible route and then selecting the route with the shortest distance. Since there are 5 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) possible routes, but since the starting city is fixed, we have (5-1)! = 4! = 24 possible routes to consider.\n\nLet's denote the cities as A, B, C, D, and E. We will list all possible routes starting from city A and calculate the total distance for each route:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E-A: 10 + 35 + 40 + 30 + 25 = 140\n2. A-B-C-E-D-A: 10 + 35 + 25 + 30 + 20 = 120\n3. A-B-D-C-E-A: 10 + 30 + 40 + 25 + 25 = 130\n4. A-B-D-E-C-A: 10 + 30 + 30 + 25 + 15 = 110\n5. A-B-E-C-D-A: 10 + 20 + 25 + 40 + 20 = 115\n6.

A-C-D-E-B-A: 15 + 40 + 30 + 30 + 10 = 125\n11. A-C-E-B-D-A: 15 + 25 + 20 + 30 + 20 = 110\n12. A-C-E-D-B-A: 15 + 25 + 30 + 40 + 10 = 120\n\n13. A-D-B-C-E-A: 20 + 30 + 35 + 25 + 25 = 135\n14. A-D-B-E-C-A: 20 + 30 + 20 + 25 + 15 = 110\n15. A-D-C-B-E-A: 20 + 40 + 35 + 20 + 25 = 140\n16. A-D-C-E-B-A: 20 + 40 + 25 + 25 + 10 = 120\n17. A-D-E-B-C-A: 20 + 30 + 20 + 35 + 15 = 120\n18. A-D-E-C-B-A: 20 + 30 + 25 + 25 + 10 = 110\n\n19. A-E-B-C-D-A: 25 + 20 + 35 + 40 + 20 = 140\n20. A-E-B-D-C-A: 25 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 15 = 130\n21. A-E-C-B-D-A: 25 + 25 + 35 + 30 + 20 = 135\n22.

A-E-D-C-B-A: 25 + 30 + 40 + 35 + 10 = 140\n\nNow, we can see that the shortest possible route is 110 miles, which can be achieved by taking the following routes: A-B-D-E-C-A, A-C-E-B-D-A, or A-D-E-C-B-A."
