    "message_2": "To apply the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 4. The derivative, f'(x), is given by:\n\nf'(x) = d(x^3 - 2x^2 + 4)/dx = 3x^2 - 4x\n\nNow, we will use the Newton-Raphson formula to find the root of the equation:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nOur initial guess is x0 = 1. Let's calculate f(x0) and f'(x0):\n\nf(x0) = f(1) = (1)^3 - 2(1)^2 + 4 = 1 - 2 + 4 = 3\nf'(x0) = f'(1) = 3(1)^2 - 4(1) = 3 - 4 = -1\n\nNow, we can find x1:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0) = 1 - (3 / -1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThe updated value of x is 4. Note that the Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method, and you may need to perform more iterations to get a more accurate root. However, based on the given initial guess and one iteration, the root of the equation is approximately x = 4."
