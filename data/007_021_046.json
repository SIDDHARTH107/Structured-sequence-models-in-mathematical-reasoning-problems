    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an algorithm for finding the non-trivial factors of a composite number. Here, we will use it to find the smallest factor of 3501.\n\n1. Choose a starting value x_1 and a function f(x). A common choice for f(x) is f(x) = x^2 + 1.\n2. Define a sequence x_1, x_2, x_3, ... by the recurrence relation x_{n+1} = f(x_n) modulo N, where N is the number we want to factor (in this case, N = 3501).\n3. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x_n - x_(2n)| and N for increasing values of n until a non-trivial factor is found.\n\nLet's start with x_1 = 2 and f(x) = x^2 + 1:\n\nx_2 = f(x_1) = 2^2 + 1 = 5 (mod 3501)\nx_3 = f(x_2) = 5^2 + 1 = 26 (mod 3501)\nx_4 = f(x_3) = 26^2 + 1 = 677 (mod 3501)\n\nNow we calculate x_(2n) values:\n\nx_4 = f(f(x_2)) = f(26) = 677 (mod 3501)\nx_6 = f(f(x_3)) = f(677) = 729 (mod 3501)\nx_8 = f(f(x_4)) = f(729) = 2894 (mod 3501)\n\nNow we calculate the GCDs:\n\nGCD(|x_2 - x_4|, 3501) = GCD(|5 - 677|, 3501) = GCD(672, 3501) = 1\nGCD(|x_3 - x_6|, 3501) = GCD(|26 - 729|, 3501) = GCD(703, 3501) = 1\nGCD(|x_4 - x_8|, 3501) = GCD(|677 - 2894|, 3501) = GCD(2217, 3501) = 13\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor: 13. So, the smallest factor of 3501 is 13."
