    "message_2": "The phase shift of a sinusoidal function is the horizontal shift applied to the function. In the given equation, y = 2sin(3x - π/4), the phase shift can be determined by looking at the term inside the sine function.\n\nThe general form of a sinusoidal function is y = A*sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn our case, we have y = 2sin(3(x - π/12)). Comparing this with the general form, we can see that the phase shift C is π/12.\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function y = 2sin(3x - π/4) is π/12."
