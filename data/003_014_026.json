    "message_2": "To find the values of y for the equation y = sin(x) when x is between 0 and 360 degrees, we can look at some key points on the graph.\n\n1. When x = 0 degrees, sin(0) = 0, so y = 0.\n2. When x = 90 degrees, sin(90) = 1, so y = 1.\n3. When x = 180 degrees, sin(180) = 0, so y = 0.\n4. When x = 270 degrees, sin(270) = -1, so y = -1.\n5. When x = 360 degrees, sin(360) = 0, so y = 0.\n\nThese are the key points on the graph. The graph of y = sin(x) is a wave that oscillates between -1 and 1, with a period of 360 degrees. It starts at (0, 0), goes up to (90, 1), back down to (180, 0), further down to (270, -1), and back up to (360, 0).\n\nTo draw the graph, plot these key points and connect them with a smooth curve that represents the sine function. The curve should have a wave-like shape, with one complete wave occurring between 0 and 360 degrees."
