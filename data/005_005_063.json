    "message_1": "A company produces light bulbs, and the lifetime of each bulb follows a normal distribution with a mean of 900 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours. What percentage of bulbs will last more than 1000 hours?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of bulbs that will last more than 1000 hours, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the value and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to standardize (1000 hours), μ is the mean (900 hours), and σ is the standard deviation (100 hours).\n\nz = (1000 - 900) / 100\nz = 100 / 100\nz = 1\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can use the z-table to find the probability. The z-table gives us the probability that a value is less than or equal to a given z-score. Since we want to find the percentage of bulbs that will last more than 1000 hours, we need to find the probability that a value is greater than or equal to a z-score of 1.\n\nUsing the z-table, we find that the probability for a z-score of 1 is approximately 0.8413. This means that there is an 84.13% chance that a bulb will last less than or equal to 1000 hours. To find the percentage of bulbs that will last more than 1000 hours, we subtract this probability from 1:\n\nPercentage of bulbs lasting more than 1000 hours = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n\nSo, approximately 15.87% of the bulbs will last more than 1000 hours."
