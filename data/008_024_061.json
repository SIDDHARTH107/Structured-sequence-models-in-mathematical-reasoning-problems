    "message_2": "First, we can observe that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2. This means that these two equations are not independent, and they represent the same line. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of equations.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y in terms of x using the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 11\n\n3y = 11 - 2x\n\ny = (11 - 2x)/3\n\nNow we have a general solution for y in terms of x. Since there are infinitely many solutions, we can choose any value for x, and we will get a corresponding value for y using the equation above."
