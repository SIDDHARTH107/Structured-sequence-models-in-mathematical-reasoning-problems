    "message_2": "An Eulerian path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. A graph has an Eulerian path if it has exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree (number of edges connected to the vertex). Let's check the degrees of the vertices in the given graph:\n\n1. Vertex 1: degree 2\n2. Vertex 2: degree 4\n3. Vertex 3: degree 2\n4. Vertex 4: degree 2\n5. Vertex 5: degree 4\n6. Vertex 6: degree 2\n\nAll vertices have even degrees, so the graph has an Eulerian path. One possible Eulerian path is: 1-2-3-6-5-4-1-2-5-6.\n\nA Hamiltonian path is a path in a graph that visits every vertex exactly once. The given graph has a Hamiltonian path. One possible Hamiltonian path is: 1-4-5-2-3-6."
