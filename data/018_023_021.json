    "message_2": "First, let's compute A △ B, which is the symmetric difference of sets A and B. The symmetric difference consists of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's compute the first expression:\n\n1. (A △ B) △ { (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) }\n\nSince A △ B = {1, 4}, we have:\n\n({1, 4}) △ { (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) }\n\nThis expression is not well-defined, as we are trying to compute the symmetric difference between a set of numbers and a set of ordered pairs. Therefore, we cannot compute this expression.\n\nNow, let's compute the second expression:\n\n2. A △ (B △ { (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) })\n\nAgain, we are trying to compute the symmetric difference between a set of numbers (B) and a set of ordered pairs { (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) }. This expression is also not well-defined, and we cannot compute it.\n\nSince both expressions are not well-defined, we cannot compare their results."
