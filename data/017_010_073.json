    "message_2": "A non-abelian group of order 10 must have a composition series with factors isomorphic to Z_2 and Z_5, since 10 = 2 * 5 and both 2 and 5 are prime. The only such group is the dihedral group D_10, which is the group of symmetries of a regular pentagon. D_10 is isomorphic to the semidirect product Z_5 â‹Š Z_2.\n\nIn D_10, the elements of order 2 are the reflections across the lines of symmetry of the pentagon. There are 5 such lines of symmetry, so there are 5 elements of order 2 in D_10."
