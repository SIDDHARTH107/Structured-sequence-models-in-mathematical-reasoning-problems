    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability. Let's denote the events as follows:\n\nA: Person has diabetes\nB: Person is over 40 years old\nC: Person has a family history of diabetes\n\nWe are asked to find the probability of a person having diabetes (A) given that the person is over 40 years old (B) and has a family history of the condition (C). In other words, we need to find P(A|B∩C).\n\nWe know the following probabilities:\n\nP(A|B) = 0.25 (25% of people over the age of 40 have diabetes)\nP(A|C) = 0.60 (60% of those with a family history of diabetes will develop the condition)\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(A|B∩C). We need more information about the relationship between age and family history, such as the probability of having a family history of diabetes given that the person is over 40 years old, or the joint probability of being over 40 and having a family history of diabetes.\n\nWithout this additional information, we cannot accurately calculate the probability of a person having diabetes given that they are over 40 years old and have a family history of the condition."
