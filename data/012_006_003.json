    "message_2": "To determine if the graph has an Eulerian path, we need to check the degrees of each vertex. An Eulerian path exists if there are exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree, and all other vertices have an even degree.\n\nLet's check the degrees of each vertex:\n- A: degree 3 (odd)\n- B: degree 3 (odd)\n- C: degree 4 (even)\n- D: degree 4 (even)\n- E: degree 2 (even)\n\nThere are exactly 2 vertices with odd degrees (A and B), so an Eulerian path exists. We can find one such path:\n\nA -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C -> A -> D -> B\n\nNow let's check for a Hamiltonian path. A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits each vertex exactly once.\n\nWe can try to find a Hamiltonian path in this graph:\n\nA -> B -> C -> D -> E\n\nThis path visits each vertex exactly once, so a Hamiltonian path exists.\n\nIn conclusion, the given graph has both an Eulerian path and a Hamiltonian path."
