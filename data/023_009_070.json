    "message_1": "A thin wire of length 10 cm is bent into a semi-circular shape. The wire is then fixed at the endpoints to form a boundary value problem. Use the Fourier transform to find the steady-state temperature distribution along the wire if the temperature at the boundary is given as T(x = 0) = T(x = 10) = 20°C and the wire is initially at a uniform temperature of 25°C. Assume that the thermal diffusivity of the wire is 0.4 cm²/s.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state temperature distribution along the wire, we can use the Fourier series solution to the heat equation. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is time, x is the position along the wire, and α is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nSince we are interested in the steady-state temperature distribution, we can set ∂T/∂t = 0:\n\n0 = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nNow, we can solve this equation using the boundary conditions T(x=0) = T(x=10) = 20°C:\n\nT(x) = A cos(kx) + B sin(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants and k is the wave number.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0) = A cos(0) + B sin(0) = 20\nT(10) = A cos(10k) + B sin(10k) = 20\n\nSince sin(0) = 0 and cos(0) = 1, the first equation simplifies to:\n\nA = 20\n\nNow, we need to find the value of B and k. To satisfy the second boundary condition, we can use the fact that the wire is bent into a semi-circular shape. This means that the wire must satisfy the periodic boundary condition:\n\nT(x) = T(x + πR)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the semi-circle. Since the length of the wire is 10 cm, the circumference of the full circle is 20 cm, and the radius is:\n\nR = (20/2π) cm\n\nNow, we can apply the periodic boundary condition:\n\nT(10) = T(10 + πR)\n20 = A cos(10k + πRk) + B sin(10k + πRk)\n\nSince A = 20:\n\n20 = 20 cos(10k + πRk) + B sin(10k + πRk)\n\nWe can now solve for B:\n\nB sin(10k + πRk) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be 0 (otherwise, the temperature would be constant), we must have:\n\nsin(10k + πRk) = 0\n\nThis implies that:\n\n10k + πRk = nπ\n\nwhere n is an integer. We can solve for k:\n\nk = nπ / (10 + πR)\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of A and k back into the equation for T(x):\n\nT(x) = 20 cos(nπx / (10 + πR)) + B sin(nπx / (10 + πR))\n\nFinally, we can use the initial condition that the wire is initially at a uniform temperature of 25°C to find the value of B:\n\n25 = 20 cos(nπx / (10 + πR)) + B sin(nπx / (10 + πR))\n\nSince the temperature is initially uniform, the sine term must be 0, and we have:\n\nB = 5\n\nSo, the steady-state temperature distribution along the wire is:\n\nT(x) = 20 cos(nπx / (10 + πR)) + 5 sin(nπx / (10 + πR))\n\nwhere n is an integer, and R is the radius of the semi-circle."
