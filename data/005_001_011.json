    "message_1": "A manufacturer of tennis balls claims that the mean weight of their tennis balls is 56 grams. You randomly select a sample of 25 tennis balls and find the mean weight to be 55 grams with a standard deviation of 2.5 grams. \n\nAssuming that the weights of the tennis balls follow a normal distribution, can you conclude, with a 95% level of confidence, that the mean weight of the tennis balls is different from the manufacturer's claim? Use hypothesis testing to support your conclusion.",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a two-tailed hypothesis test. We will use the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 56 grams (the mean weight of the tennis balls is equal to the manufacturer's claim)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 56 grams (the mean weight of the tennis balls is different from the manufacturer's claim)\n\nWe are given the following information:\nSample mean (x̄) = 55 grams\nSample size (n) = 25 tennis balls\nSample standard deviation (s) = 2.5 grams\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05 (for a 95% confidence level)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean:\nSE = s / √n = 2.5 / √25 = 2.5 / 5 = 0.5 grams\n\nNext, we will calculate the test statistic (t-score) using the following formula:\nt = (x̄ - μ) / SE = (55 - 56) / 0.5 = -1 / 0.5 = -2\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a 95% confidence level and 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.064.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-2) falls within the range of the critical t-values (-2.064 to 2.064), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that, with a 95% level of confidence, we cannot conclude that the mean weight of the tennis balls is different from the manufacturer's claim of 56 grams."
