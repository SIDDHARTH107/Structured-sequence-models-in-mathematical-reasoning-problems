    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of this graph, we can use the deletion-contraction method. Let P(G, k) denote the chromatic polynomial of graph G with k colors. We will use the edge connecting vertices D and E for the deletion-contraction method.\n\n1. Delete the edge DE: The resulting graph G' is:\n\n```\n   A----B\n  / \\   |\n C---D  E\n```\n\nNow, we need to find P(G', k).\n\n2. Contract the edge DE: The resulting graph G'' is:\n\n```\n   A----B\n  / \\   |\n C---D+E\n```\n\nNow, we need to find P(G'', k).\n\nFor G', there are no restrictions on the coloring, so we can color each vertex independently. Thus, P(G', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-4).\n\nFor G'', we have the following restrictions:\n\n- Vertex D+E must have a different color from A, B, and C.\n- Vertex A must have a different color from B and C.\n- Vertex B must have a different color from A.\n- Vertex C must have a different color from A.\n\nSo, P(G'', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\nNow, we can use the deletion-contraction method to find the chromatic polynomial of the original graph G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-4) - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)[(k-4) - 1] = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-5).\n\nThus, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph is P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-5)."
