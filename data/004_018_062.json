    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x³ using the power rule, we apply the rule which states that if f(x) = ax^n, then f'(x) = n * ax^(n-1).\n\nIn this case, a = 5, n = 3, and x = x. So, applying the power rule:\n\nf'(x) = 3 * 5x^(3-1)\nf'(x) = 15x^2\n\nThe derivative of the function f(x) = 5x³ is f'(x) = 15x^2."
