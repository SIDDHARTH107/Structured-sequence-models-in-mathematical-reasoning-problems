    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the length of the base is 8 units and the length of each of the two equal sides is 10 units. What is the length of the altitude drawn from the vertex dividing the base into two equal parts?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the altitude, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. Since the altitude divides the base into two equal parts, we can create a right triangle with the altitude as the height, half of the base (4 units) as the base, and one of the equal sides (10 units) as the hypotenuse.\n\nLet h be the length of the altitude. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nh^2 + (4)^2 = (10)^2\nh^2 + 16 = 100\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh^2 = 100 - 16\nh^2 = 84\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nh = √84 ≈ 9.165\n\nSo, the length of the altitude is approximately 9.165 units."
