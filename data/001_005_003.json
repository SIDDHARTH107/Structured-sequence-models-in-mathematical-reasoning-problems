    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 3x^2 + 4x - 7 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 3, b = 4, and c = -7.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant (the part inside the square root):\n\nDiscriminant = b^2 - 4ac\n= (4)^2 - 4(3)(-7)\n= 16 + 84\n= 100\n\nNow, we can plug the values of a, b, and the discriminant into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-4 ± √100) / 2(3)\n\nx = (-4 ± 10) / 6\n\nWe have two possible solutions:\n\n1) x = (-4 + 10) / 6\nx = 6 / 6\nx = 1\n\n2) x = (-4 - 10) / 6\nx = -14 / 6\nx = -7/3\n\nSo, the solutions to the quadratic equation 3x^2 + 4x - 7 = 0 are x = 1 and x = -7/3."
