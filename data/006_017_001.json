    "message_1": "What is the probability of a fatal accident occurring on a particular road in a year, given that historically the average number of fatal accidents on that road in a year is 3 and the total number of accidents, both fatal and non-fatal, during that period is 200?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a fatal accident occurring on a particular road in a year, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the average number of fatal accidents in a year, which is 3. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of accidents, both fatal and non-fatal, which is 200.\n\nSo, the probability of a fatal accident occurring on that road in a year is:\n\nProbability = 3 / 200 = 0.015\n\nAs a percentage, this probability is 0.015 * 100 = 1.5%.\n\nTherefore, there is a 1.5% chance of a fatal accident occurring on that road in a year."
