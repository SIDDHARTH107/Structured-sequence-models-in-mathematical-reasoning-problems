    "message_1": "A student wants to design a schedule for a 12-week study plan, where they will study three subjects A, B, and C each week. They want to ensure that each subject is studied exactly four times during the 12 weeks and on any given week they study any two subjects together. In how many ways can the student design their 12-week study plan?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem. The student will study two subjects each week, and there are three possible pairs of subjects: AB, AC, and BC. Since the student will study each subject exactly four times in 12 weeks, they will study each pair of subjects four times as well.\n\nWe can use combinatorics to solve this problem. We need to find the number of ways to arrange the study pairs in a 12-week schedule, with each pair occurring four times.\n\nWe can treat this as a problem of arranging 4 ABs, 4 ACs, and 4 BCs in a sequence of 12 weeks. This is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of a multiset.\n\nThe formula for the number of permutations of a multiset is:\n\nP(n; n1, n2, ..., nk) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the counts of each distinct item.\n\nIn our case, n = 12 (total weeks), n1 = 4 (count of AB pairs), n2 = 4 (count of AC pairs), and n3 = 4 (count of BC pairs).\n\nUsing the formula, we get:\n\nP(12; 4, 4, 4) = 12! / (4! * 4! * 4!)\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\n12! = 479001600\n4! = 24\n\nSo, the number of permutations is:\n\nP(12; 4, 4, 4) = 479001600 / (24 * 24 * 24) = 34650\n\nTherefore, the student can design their 12-week study plan in 34,650 different ways."
