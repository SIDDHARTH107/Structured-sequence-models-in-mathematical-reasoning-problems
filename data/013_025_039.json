    "message_1": "Suppose two airline passengers, Alice and Bob, each checked in a suitcase with a value of $1000. The airline offers them the following compensation options if both suitcases are lost:\n\n1. Alice and Bob each receive $1000\n2. Alice and Bob each receive $1500 if one of them claims the lost suitcase, but only $500 if both claim it.\n\nAssuming that Alice and Bob have no way of communicating with each other, what option should they choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best option for Alice and Bob, we can analyze the expected value of each option. The expected value is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the value of that outcome and then summing the results.\n\nLet's consider option 2 and analyze the possible outcomes:\n\n1. Alice claims the lost suitcase, and Bob does not. Alice receives $1500, and Bob receives $0.\n2. Alice does not claim the lost suitcase, and Bob does. Alice receives $0, and Bob receives $1500.\n3. Both Alice and Bob claim the lost suitcase. Alice and Bob each receive $500.\n\nSince Alice and Bob have no way of communicating, we can assume that they have a 50% chance of claiming the lost suitcase. Therefore, the probabilities for each outcome are:\n\n1. Probability (Alice claims, Bob doesn't) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n2. Probability (Alice doesn't claim, Bob does) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n3. Probability (Both claim) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected value for Alice and Bob in option 2:\n\nExpected value (Alice) = (0.25 * $1500) + (0.25 * $0) + (0.25 * $500) = $375 + $0 + $125 = $500\nExpected value (Bob) = (0.25 * $0) + (0.25 * $1500) + (0.25 * $500) = $0 + $375 + $125 = $500\n\nIn option 1, both Alice and Bob receive $1000 each if both suitcases are lost. Comparing the expected values of both options:\n\nOption 1: Alice and Bob each receive $1000\nOption 2: Alice and Bob each have an expected value of $500\n\nSince the expected value of option 1 is higher for both Alice and Bob, they should choose option 1."
