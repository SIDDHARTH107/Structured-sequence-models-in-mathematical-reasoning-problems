    "message_2": "To find all isometries of the given metric g = dx^2 + 4dy^2 + 4dz^2 on R^3, we need to find all transformations that preserve the distance between points in the space.\n\nLet T: R^3 â†’ R^3 be an isometry. Then, for any two points P(x1, y1, z1) and Q(x2, y2, z2) in R^3, the distance between P and Q must be equal to the distance between T(P) and T(Q).\n\nLet T be a linear transformation represented by a 3x3 matrix A:\n\nT(x, y, z) = A * (x, y, z)^T\n\nwhere A = [a_ij] is a 3x3 matrix and (x, y, z)^T is the transpose of the column vector (x, y, z).\n\nThe squared distance between P and Q in the metric g is given by:\n\nd^2(P, Q) = (x2 - x1)^2 + 4(y2 - y1)^2 + 4(z2 - z1)^2\n\nThe squared distance between T(P) and T(Q) is given by:\n\nd^2(T(P), T(Q)) = (a_11(x2 - x1) + a_12(y2 - y1) + a_13(z2 - z1))^2 + 4(a_21(x2 - x1) + a_22(y2 - y1) + a_23(z2 - z1))^2 + 4(a_31(x2 - x1) + a_32(y2 - y1) + a_33(z2 - z1))^2\n\nFor T to be an isometry, we must have:\n\nd^2(P, Q) = d^2(T(P), T(Q))\n\nThis equality must hold for all points P and Q in R^3. Comparing the coefficients of the squared differences, we obtain the following conditions on the matrix A:\n\n1. a_11^2 + a_12^2 + a_13^2 = 1\n2. a_21^2 + a_22^2 + a_23^2 = 1\n3. a_31^2 + a_32^2 + a_33^2 = 1\n4. a_11 * a_21 + a_12 * a_22 + a_13 * a_23 = 0\n5. a_11 * a_31 + a_12 * a_32 + a_13 * a_33 = 0\n6. a_21 * a_31 + a_22 * a_32 + a_23 * a_33 = 0\n\nThese conditions imply that the columns of A are orthonormal. Therefore, A is an orthogonal matrix. Moreover, since T preserves orientation, the determinant of A must be 1.\n\nThus, the isometries of the given metric are represented by 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. These transformations include rotations and reflections that preserve the metric."
