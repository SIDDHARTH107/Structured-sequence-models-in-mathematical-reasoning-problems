    "message_1": "In a group of 6 people, what is the minimum number of friendships required for there to be a group of 3 people who are mutual friends or a group of 3 people who are mutual strangers?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using Ramsey's theorem, which states that in any graph with enough vertices, there will always be a complete subgraph of a certain size with all edges of the same color. In this case, we are looking for a complete subgraph of size 3 (a triangle) with all edges either representing friendships (same color) or non-friendships (different color).\n\nLet's consider one person in the group of 6. This person can have at most 5 connections with the other people in the group. If at least 3 of these connections are friendships (same color), then there is a group of 3 mutual friends. If at least 3 of these connections are non-friendships (different color), then there is a group of 3 mutual strangers.\n\nSo, in the worst-case scenario, we can have 2 friendships and 3 non-friendships for the first person. Now, let's consider the second person. If they have a friendship with the first person, they can have at most 3 more friendships with the remaining 4 people. If they have a non-friendship with the first person, they can have at most 2 more non-friendships with the remaining 4 people. In either case, they must have at least 3 connections of the same type (friendship or non-friendship) with the remaining 4 people.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of friendships required for there to be a group of 3 people who are mutual friends or a group of 3 people who are mutual strangers is 3."
