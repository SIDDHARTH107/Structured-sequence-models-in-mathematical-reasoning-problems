    "message_1": "Suppose the Feistel cipher uses a 64-bit block size, a key size of 128 bits, and consists of 16 rounds. How many total rounds of encryption and decryption operations are needed to encrypt and decrypt a single block of data using the Feistel cipher?",
    "message_2": "In the Feistel cipher, the encryption and decryption processes are very similar, and both consist of the same number of rounds. Since the Feistel cipher in this case consists of 16 rounds, you would need 16 rounds for encryption and another 16 rounds for decryption. Therefore, a total of 16 + 16 = 32 rounds of operations are needed to encrypt and decrypt a single block of data using the Feistel cipher."
