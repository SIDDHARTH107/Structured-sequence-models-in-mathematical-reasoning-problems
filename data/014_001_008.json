    "message_1": "Let's say we have two prime numbers, p = 13 and q = 17. Use RSA encryption to encrypt the message M = 5. Show the full process of encryption, including finding n, phi(n), e, and the ciphertext C. Then, use RSA decryption to decrypt the ciphertext C and show how to obtain the original message M.",
    "message_2": "To use RSA encryption, we first need to find n, phi(n), e, and the ciphertext C. Then, we'll use RSA decryption to decrypt the ciphertext C and obtain the original message M.\n\n1. Compute n:\nn = p * q\nn = 13 * 17\nn = 221\n\n2. Compute phi(n):\nphi(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\nphi(n) = (13-1) * (17-1)\nphi(n) = 12 * 16\nphi(n) = 192\n\n3. Choose e:\nSelect an integer e such that 1 < e < phi(n) and gcd(e, phi(n)) = 1. A common choice for e is 3 or 65537. In this case, we can choose e = 3 since it satisfies the conditions.\n\n4. Compute the ciphertext C:\nC = M^e mod n\nC = 5^3 mod 221\nC = 125 mod 221\nC = 125\n\nNow, we have encrypted the message M = 5 as the ciphertext C = 125. Next, we'll use RSA decryption to obtain the original message M.\n\n5. Compute d:\nFind the multiplicative inverse of e (mod phi(n)). In other words, find an integer d such that (e * d) mod phi(n) = 1.\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 131.\n\n6. Decrypt the ciphertext C to obtain the original message M:\nM = C^d mod n\nM = 125^131 mod 221\nM = 5\n\nSo, the decrypted message M is 5, which is the original message. The full process of RSA encryption and decryption is shown below:\n\n- n = 221\n- phi(n) = 192\n- e = 3\n- Ciphertext C = 125\n- d = 131\n- Decrypted message M = 5"
