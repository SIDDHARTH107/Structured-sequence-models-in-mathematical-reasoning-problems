    "message_2": "To compute the exterior derivative of the 2-form $\\omega$, we will apply the exterior derivative to each of its components. Recall that the exterior derivative of a 2-form is a 3-form. Let's compute the exterior derivative of each component of $\\omega$:\n\n1. For the first component, $xydx$:\n$$d(xydx) = d(xy) \\wedge dx = (ydx + xdy) \\wedge dx = y(dx \\wedge dx) + x(dy \\wedge dx) = x(dy \\wedge dx),$$\nsince $dx \\wedge dx = 0$.\n\n2. For the second component, $xdy$:\n$$d(xdy) = d(x) \\wedge dy = dx \\wedge dy.$$\n\n3. For the third component, $\\sin(z)dz$:\n$$d(\\sin(z)dz) = d(\\sin(z)) \\wedge dz = (\\cos(z)dz) \\wedge dz = \\cos(z)(dz \\wedge dz) = 0,$$\nsince $dz \\wedge dz = 0$.\n\nNow, we can compute the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ by summing up the exterior derivatives of its components:\n\n$$d\\omega = d(xydx) + d(xdy) + d(\\sin(z)dz) = x(dy \\wedge dx) + dx \\wedge dy = -x(dx \\wedge dy) + dx \\wedge dy.$$\n\nThus, the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ on $M$ is:\n\n$$d\\omega = (1 - x)(dx \\wedge dy).$$"
