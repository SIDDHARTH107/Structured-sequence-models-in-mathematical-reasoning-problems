    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on a flat ground. A 20-meter long guy wire is attached to the top of the pole and anchored at a point on the ground that is 16 meters from the base of the pole. What is the minimum height of the pole (in meters) if the guy wire is at its maximum tension?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum height of the pole, we can use the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles. Let h be the height of the pole, and let the guy wire be the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the pole, the ground, and the guy wire. The base of the triangle is 16 meters.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the guy wire) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the height of the pole and the distance from the base of the pole to the anchor point on the ground).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n20^2 = h^2 + 16^2\n\n400 = h^2 + 256\n\nh^2 = 400 - 256\n\nh^2 = 144\n\nh = âˆš144\n\nh = 12\n\nThe minimum height of the pole is 12 meters."
