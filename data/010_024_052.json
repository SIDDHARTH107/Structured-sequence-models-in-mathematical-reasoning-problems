    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a triangle can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The formula for the area of a hyperbolic triangle with angles α, β, and γ is:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nGiven the angles of the triangle are 50°, 70°, and 60°, we can convert these to radians:\n\nα = 50° × (π/180) ≈ 0.8727 radians\nβ = 70° × (π/180) ≈ 1.2217 radians\nγ = 60° × (π/180) ≈ 1.0472 radians\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = π - (0.8727 + 1.2217 + 1.0472)\nArea ≈ π - 3.1416\nArea ≈ -0.0001\n\nHowever, due to rounding errors, the area is actually 0. The negative value is an artifact of the rounding process. So, the area of the hyperbolic triangle is 0."
