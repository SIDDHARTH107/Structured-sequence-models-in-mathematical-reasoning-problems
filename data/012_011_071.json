    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge (also known as a cut edge) is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph, we can identify the cut vertices and bridges as follows:\n\nCut vertices:\n1. Vertex A: Removing A disconnects the graph into two components: {B, C, D, E} and {F, G, H, I}.\n2. Vertex E: Removing E disconnects the graph into two components: {A, B, C, D} and {F, G, H, I}.\n\nBridges:\n1. Edge (A, E): Removing this edge disconnects the graph into two components: {A, B, C, D} and {E, F, G, H, I}.\n\nExplanation:\n- Removing vertex A breaks the connection between the left and right parts of the graph, as A is the only vertex connecting B and E.\n- Similarly, removing vertex E breaks the connection between the left and right parts of the graph, as E is the only vertex connecting A and F.\n- Removing edge (A, E) also breaks the connection between the left and right parts of the graph, as it is the only edge connecting A and E, which are the only vertices connecting the two parts of the graph.\n\nNo other vertices or edges, when removed, increase the number of connected components in the graph. Therefore, these are the only cut vertices and bridges in the given graph."
