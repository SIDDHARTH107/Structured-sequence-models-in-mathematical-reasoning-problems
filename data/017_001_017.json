    "message_2": "First, let's recall the definitions of the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4.\n\nC4 = {1, x, x^2, x^3} with the following Cayley table:\n\n|  1  |  x  | x^2 | x^3 |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|  1  |  x  | x^2 | x^3 |\n|  x  | x^2 | x^3 |  1  |\n| x^2 | x^3 |  1  |  x  |\n| x^3 |  1  |  x  | x^2 |\n\nV4 = {1, a, b, c} with the following Cayley table:\n\n|  1  |  a  |  b  |  c  |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|  1  |  a  |  b  |  c  |\n|  a  |  1  |  c  |  b  |\n|  b  |  c  |  1  |  a  |\n|  c  |  b  |  a  |  1  |\n\nNow, let's compare the given group G with C4 and V4. We can see that the Cayley table of G is identical to the Cayley table of V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nTo find the isomorphism between G and V4, we can define a function φ: G → V4 such that:\n\nφ(𝑒) = 1\nφ(𝑎) = a\nφ(𝑏) = b\nφ(𝑐) = c\n\nSince the Cayley tables of G and V4 are identical, this function preserves the group operation, and it is bijective. Thus, φ is an isomorphism between G and V4."
