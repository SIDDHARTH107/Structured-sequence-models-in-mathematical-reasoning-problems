    "message_2": "Let's denote the anticanonical divisor of X by -K_X. Since X is a Fano variety, -K_X is an ample divisor. The self-intersection number of -K_X is given as (-K_X)^4 = -4.\n\nNow, let's consider a line L in X. The degree of a line is defined as the intersection number of the line with the anticanonical divisor, i.e., deg(L) = L · (-K_X).\n\nBy the projection formula, we have:\n\nL · (-K_X) = (L · L · L · L) · (-K_X) = L^4 · (-K_X).\n\nSince the Picard group of X is isomorphic to Z, we can write L = a(-K_X) for some integer a. Then, we have:\n\ndeg(L) = (a(-K_X))^4 · (-K_X) = a^4(-K_X)^4 = a^4(-4).\n\nNow, we want to find the integer a. Since the degree of a line must be positive, we have a^4(-4) > 0, which implies that a^4 = 1. The only integer solution for a is a = 1.\n\nTherefore, the degree of a line in X is deg(L) = 1^4(-4) = -4."
