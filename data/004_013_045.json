    "message_2": "To find the maximum or minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 8x - 5, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by this quadratic function. Since the coefficient of the x^2 term (2) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, which means it has a minimum value.\n\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula x = -b/(2a), where a and b are the coefficients of the x^2 and x terms, respectively. In this case, a = 2 and b = 8.\n\nx = -8 / (2 * 2) = -8 / 4 = -2\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the y-coordinate (the minimum value of the function) by plugging this value back into the function:\n\nf(-2) = 2(-2)^2 + 8(-2) - 5 = 2(4) - 16 - 5 = 8 - 16 - 5 = -13\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 8x - 5 is -13."
