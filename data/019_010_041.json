    "message_1": "Consider a linear logic system consisting of three variables A, B, and C. If A implies B and B implies C, what is the maximum number of variables that can be true at any given time, assuming that only one variable can be true at a time?",
    "message_2": "In this linear logic system, if A is true, then B must be true (since A implies B), and if B is true, then C must be true (since B implies C). However, the condition states that only one variable can be true at a time. Therefore, the maximum number of variables that can be true at any given time is 1."
