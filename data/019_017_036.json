    "message_2": "To prove or disprove that A and B are elementarily equivalent, we need to show whether or not they satisfy the same first-order sentences in the language L. In other words, we need to find a sentence in L that is true in one structure but not in the other.\n\nConsider the following sentence in L:\n\n∃x (f(f(x)) = x)\n\nLet's see if this sentence is true in A and B.\n\nIn A, the domain is the set of real numbers R, and fA(x) = 2x. So, we need to find a real number x such that fA(fA(x)) = x. Let's compute fA(fA(x)):\n\nfA(fA(x)) = fA(2x) = 2(2x) = 4x\n\nNow, we need to find a real number x such that 4x = x. We can solve this equation:\n\n4x = x\n4x - x = 0\n3x = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo, in A, there exists a real number x (specifically, x = 0) such that fA(fA(x)) = x. Therefore, the sentence ∃x (f(f(x)) = x) is true in A.\n\nNow, let's check if the sentence is true in B. In B, the domain is the set of non-negative integers, and fB(x) = x + 1. We need to find a non-negative integer x such that fB(fB(x)) = x. Let's compute fB(fB(x)):\n\nfB(fB(x)) = fB(x + 1) = (x + 1) + 1 = x + 2\n\nNow, we need to find a non-negative integer x such that x + 2 = x. However, this is impossible, as adding 2 to a non-negative integer will always result in a different non-negative integer. Therefore, the sentence ∃x (f(f(x)) = x) is false in B.\n\nSince the sentence ∃x (f(f(x)) = x) is true in A but false in B, A and B are not elementarily equivalent."
