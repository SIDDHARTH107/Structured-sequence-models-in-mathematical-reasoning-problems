    "message_2": "To compute the Betti numbers of the simplicial complex $K$ using Morse homology, we first need to determine the critical cells of $K$. A critical cell is a cell whose boundary has a lower Morse index than the cell itself. In this case, we can consider the vertices, edges, and faces of the simplices as the cells.\n\nThe simplicial complex $K$ has the following cells:\n\n0-cells (vertices): $v_0=(0,0,0)$, $v_1=(1,0,0)$, $v_2=(0,1,0)$, $v_3=(0,0,1)$\n\n1-cells (edges): $e_1=[v_0,v_1]$, $e_2=[v_0,v_2]$, $e_3=[v_1,v_2]$, $e_4=[v_0,v_3]$\n\n2-cells (faces): $f_1=[v_0,v_1,v_2]$, $f_2=[v_0,v_1,v_3]$, $f_3=[v_0,v_2,v_3]$, $f_4=[v_1,v_2,v_3]$\n\nNow, we need to determine the critical cells. In this case, all 0-cells are critical since they have no boundary. The 1-cells $e_1$, $e_2$, and $e_4$ are critical since their boundaries are 0-cells, which have a lower Morse index. The 2-cell $f_1$ is critical since its boundary consists of the 1-cells $e_1$, $e_2$, and $e_3$, which have a lower Morse index.\n\nNow we can compute the Betti numbers using the critical cells:\n\n- $b_0$: The number of connected components. Since all 0-cells are critical, $b_0=4$.\n- $b_1$: The number of 1-dimensional holes. There are 3 critical 1-cells, so $b_1=3$.\n- $b_2$: The number of 2-dimensional holes. There is 1 critical 2-cell, so $b_2=1$.\n\nThus, the Betti numbers of the simplicial complex $K$ are $b_0=4$, $b_1=3$, and $b_2=1$."
