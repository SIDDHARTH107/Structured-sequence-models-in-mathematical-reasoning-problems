    "message_2": "If G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3, then G has the same structure as D3. The dihedral group D3 consists of the symmetries of an equilateral triangle, and it has 6 elements: the identity, two rotations (by 120° and 240°), and three reflections (across the three axes of symmetry).\n\nIn D3, the three reflections have order 2, since applying a reflection twice returns the triangle to its original position. Therefore, if G is isomorphic to D3, it has 3 elements of order 2.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6, then G has the same structure as C6. The cyclic group C6 has 6 elements, generated by a single element g with the property that g^6 = e (the identity element). The generators of C6 are the elements g^k, where k is relatively prime to 6 (i.e., the greatest common divisor of k and 6 is 1).\n\nThe numbers relatively prime to 6 are 1 and 5 (since 2, 3, and 4 share common divisors with 6). Therefore, there are two generators for C6: g^1 (which is just g) and g^5."
