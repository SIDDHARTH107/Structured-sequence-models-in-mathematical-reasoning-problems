    "message_1": "A student is standing 50 meters away from a tower. If the angle of elevation from the student's eye to the top of the tower is 35 degrees, what is the height of the tower? (round to the nearest tenth)",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tower, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 35 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the tower (h), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the student to the tower (50 meters).\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(35°) = h / 50\n\nTo find the height of the tower, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nh = 50 * tan(35°)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of the angle and calculate the height:\n\nh = 50 * tan(35°) ≈ 50 * 0.7002 ≈ 35.01\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth, the height of the tower is approximately 35.0 meters."
