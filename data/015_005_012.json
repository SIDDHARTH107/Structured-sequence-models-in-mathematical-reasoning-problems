    "message_2": "To find the values of a, b, and c for which the Rössler system exhibits chaotic behavior, we can refer to the well-known parameter values that lead to chaos in the Rössler system. These parameter values are:\n\na ≈ 0.2\nb ≈ 0.2\nc ≈ 5.7\n\nThese values are known to produce chaotic behavior in the Rössler system for a wide range of initial conditions, including the ones given (x(0) = 1, y(0) = 1, z(0) = 10). Keep in mind that these values are approximate, and other combinations of a, b, and c may also lead to chaotic behavior. However, these values are commonly used in the study of the Rössler system and its chaotic dynamics."
