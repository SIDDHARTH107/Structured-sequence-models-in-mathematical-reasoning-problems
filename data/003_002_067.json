    "message_2": "To find the values of sine, cosine, and tangent of a 60-degree angle in a right-angled triangle with a hypotenuse of length 10 units, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio of 1:√3:2, where the side opposite the 30-degree angle is half the length of the hypotenuse, and the side opposite the 60-degree angle is √3 times the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle.\n\nLet's label the sides of the triangle as follows:\n- Hypotenuse (opposite the 90-degree angle): 10 units\n- Side opposite the 60-degree angle: a\n- Side opposite the 30-degree angle: b\n\nSince the hypotenuse is 10 units, we can find the lengths of the other two sides using the ratio 1:√3:2.\n\nb = (1/2) * 10 = 5 units\na = √3 * b = √3 * 5 = 5√3 units\n\nNow we can find the sine, cosine, and tangent of the 60-degree angle:\n\nsin(60°) = opposite side / hypotenuse = a / 10 = (5√3) / 10 = √3 / 2\ncos(60°) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = b / 10 = 5 / 10 = 1 / 2\ntan(60°) = opposite side / adjacent side = a / b = (5√3) / 5 = √3\n\nSo, the values of sine, cosine, and tangent of the 60-degree angle are:\nsin(60°) = √3 / 2\ncos(60°) = 1 / 2\ntan(60°) = √3"
