    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature K at the point (1, 1, 0) of the surface, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms.\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the metric tensor, which is the dot product of the tangent vectors of the surface. Let's compute the tangent vectors:\n\n∂x/∂u = 1\n∂y/∂u = 0\n∂z/∂u = 2u\n\n∂x/∂v = 0\n∂y/∂v = 1\n∂z/∂v = -2v\n\nNow, let's compute the metric tensor:\n\nE = <∂x/∂u, ∂y/∂u, ∂z/∂u> • <∂x/∂u, ∂y/∂u, ∂z/∂u> = 1² + 0² + (2u)² = 1 + 4u²\nF = <∂x/∂u, ∂y/∂u, ∂z/∂u> • <∂x/∂v, ∂y/∂v, ∂z/∂v> = 1*0 + 0*1 + (2u)*(-2v) = -4uv\nG = <∂x/∂v, ∂y/∂v, ∂z/∂v> • <∂x/∂v, ∂y/∂v, ∂z/∂v> = 0² + 1² + (-2v)² = 1 + 4v²\n\nNow, let's compute the second fundamental form. We first need to compute the normal vector N to the surface:\n\nN = <∂x/∂u, ∂y/∂u, ∂z/∂u> x <∂x/∂v, ∂y/∂v, ∂z/∂v> = (0, -2u-2v, 1)\n\nNow, let's compute the second fundamental form:\n\nL = N • ∂²x/∂u² = 0\nM = N • ∂²x/∂u∂v = -2\nN = N • ∂²x/∂v² = 0\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M²) / (EG - F²)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 0), we have:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)² = 5\nF = -4(1)(1) = -4\nG = 1 + 4(1)² = 5\n\nL = 0\nM = -2\nN = 0\n\nK = (0 * 0 - (-2)²) / (5 * 5 - (-4)²) = (-4) / (25 - 16) = -4 / 9\n\nSo, the sectional curvature K at the point (1, 1, 0) of the surface is -4/9."
