    "message_1": "Suppose there are 100 players in a beauty contest game, and each player is asked to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the game is the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen. What strategy would you use to choose your number in order to maximize your chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize your chances of winning, you should try to predict the average number chosen by the other players and then choose a number that is 2/3 of that average.\n\nLet's assume that all players are rational and will also try to choose a number that is 2/3 of the average. If all players choose a number between 0 and 100, the average number chosen would be 50. Therefore, a rational player would choose 2/3 * 50 = 33.33.\n\nHowever, if all players are rational and think this way, then the new average would be 33.33. So, a more rational player would choose 2/3 * 33.33 = 22.22.\n\nThis process can be iterated, with each step assuming that the other players are also rational and will choose a number that is 2/3 of the previous average. After several iterations, the numbers chosen will converge to 0.\n\nIn practice, not all players may be perfectly rational, and some may choose numbers randomly or based on personal preferences. To account for this, you could choose a number slightly above 0, such as 1 or 2, to maximize your chances of winning. This strategy assumes that the other players will also choose numbers close to 0, and your number will be closest to 2/3 of the average."
