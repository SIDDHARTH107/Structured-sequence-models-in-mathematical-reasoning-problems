    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given differential equation y'' + 4y = 0, we first assume a solution of the form y(x) = e^(rx), where r is a complex constant. Then, the first and second derivatives of y(x) with respect to x are:\n\ny'(x) = r * e^(rx)\ny''(x) = r^2 * e^(rx)\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the given differential equation:\n\nr^2 * e^(rx) + 4 * e^(rx) = 0\n\nWe can factor out the exponential term e^(rx):\n\ne^(rx) * (r^2 + 4) = 0\n\nSince the exponential term e^(rx) is never equal to zero, we can divide both sides by e^(rx) and obtain the characteristic equation:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nNow, we solve for r:\n\nr^2 = -4\nr = Â±2i\n\nThus, we have two complex roots r1 = 2i and r2 = -2i. The general solution of the differential equation in terms of complex exponentials is:\n\ny(x) = C1 * e^(2ix) + C2 * e^(-2ix)\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are arbitrary complex constants."
