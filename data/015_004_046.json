    "message_2": "The main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is the largest connected region in the set, and it has a heart-like shape. The area of the main cardioid can be found using the formula for the area of a cardioid, which is given by:\n\n$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi a^2$\n\nwhere $a$ is the length of the longest diameter of the cardioid. In the case of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set, the longest diameter is equal to 2. Therefore, the area of the main cardioid is:\n\n$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (2)^2 = 2\\pi$\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is $2\\pi$ square units."
