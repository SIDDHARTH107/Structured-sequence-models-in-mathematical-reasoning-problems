Find the true direction of the plane's velocity and its ground speed. Use trigonometry to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the true direction of the plane's velocity and its ground speed, we need to break down the plane's velocity and the wind's velocity into their respective components (North-South and East-West) and then combine them.\n\nLet's denote the plane's velocity as P and the wind's velocity as W. We can break down these velocities into their components as follows:\n\nP_North = P * sin(60°)\nP_East = P * cos(60°)\n\nW_North = W * sin(30°)\nW_West = W * cos(30°)\n\nNow, we can find the net velocity components by adding the plane's and wind's components:\n\nNet_North = P_North + W_North\nNet_East = P_East - W_West (subtracting because the wind is blowing West)\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nP_North = 500 * sin(60°) ≈ 433.01 km/h\nP_East = 500 * cos(60°) ≈ 250 km/h\n\nW_North = 100 * sin(30°) = 50 km/h\nW_West = 100 * cos(30°) ≈ 86.60 km/h\n\nNet_North = 433.01 + 50 = 483.01 km/h\nNet_East = 250 - 86.60 ≈ 163.40 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the net velocity (ground speed) using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nGround_Speed = √(Net_North² + Net_East²)\nGround_Speed = √(483.01² + 163.40²) ≈ 507.46 km/h\n\nTo find the true direction, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nTrue_Direction = arctan(Net_North / Net_East)\nTrue_Direction = arctan(483.01 / 163.40) ≈ 71.07°\n\nSo, the true direction of the plane's velocity is approximately 71.07° North of East, and its ground speed is approximately 507.46 km/h."
