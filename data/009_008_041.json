    "message_1": "Consider the wave equation $u_{tt} = a^2 u_{xx}$ where $a=2$ represents the speed of sound in air. A guitar string is fixed at both ends and is 1 meter long. At time $t=0$, the string is plucked so that its initial shape is given by $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$. The string is at rest at time $t=0$, i.e. $u_t(x,0) = 0$. \n\nFind the solution for $u(x,t)$ that satisfies the initial conditions and the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0$.",
    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation with the given initial and boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other only on $t$:\n\n$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$\n\nSubstitute this into the wave equation:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) = a^2 X''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $a^2 X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{a^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{a^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$\n\n$T''(t) + a^2 \\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nSolve the spatial equation first:\n\n$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$\n\nThe general solution is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) + B\\sin(\\lambda x)$\n\nApply the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0$:\n\n$X(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 0$\n\n$X(1) = B\\sin(\\lambda) = 0$\n\nSince $B$ cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have $\\sin(\\lambda) = 0$. Therefore, $\\lambda = n\\pi$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. So, the spatial part of the solution is:\n\n$X_n(x) = B_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$\n\nNow, solve the temporal equation:\n\n$T''(t) + a^2 \\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$\n\n$T''(t) + 4n^2\\pi^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nThe general solution is:\n\n$T_n(t) = C_n\\cos(2n\\pi t) + D_n\\sin(2n\\pi t)$\n\nSince the string is initially at rest, $u_t(x,0) = 0$. Differentiate $u(x,t)$ with respect to $t$ and set $t=0$:\n\n$u_t(x,0) = X(x)T'(t)|_{t=0} = X(x)(-2n\\pi C_n\\sin(0) + 2n\\pi D_n\\cos(0)) = 2n\\pi D_n X(x)$\n\nSince $u_t(x,0) = 0$, we have $D_n = 0$. Thus, the temporal part of the solution is:\n\n$T_n(t) = C_n\\cos(2n\\pi t)$\n\nThe full solution is a sum of these spatial and temporal parts:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n\\sin(n\\pi x)\\cos(2n\\pi t)$\n\nNow, apply the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$:\n\n$\\sin(\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n\\sin(n\\pi x)\\cos(0)$\n\nComparing the terms, we see that $C_1 = 1$ and $C_n = 0$ for $n > 1$. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi t)$"
