    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem related to Cheap Talk in Game Theory:\n\nIn a coordination game, players A and B are trying to choose between two options, option X and option Y. If both players choose X, they each receive a payoff of 4. If both players choose Y, they each receive a payoff of 2. However, if one player chooses X and the other chooses Y, the player who chose X receives a payoff of 0 and the player who chose Y receives a payoff of 3.\n\nBefore the game begins, Player A is allowed to make a cheap talk statement to Player B, claiming that they will choose option X. Player B must then decide whether to believe Player A's statement or not.\n\nIf Player B believes Player A's statement and also chooses X, what is the resulting payoff for each player? If Player B does not believe Player A's statement and instead chooses Y, what is the resulting payoff for each player?",
    "message_2": "If Player B believes Player A's statement and also chooses X, both players choose X. In this case, the resulting payoff for each player is 4, as mentioned in the problem.\n\nIf Player B does not believe Player A's statement and instead chooses Y, we have two possible scenarios:\n\n1. Player A was truthful and chooses X: In this case, Player A receives a payoff of 0 (since they chose X), and Player B receives a payoff of 3 (since they chose Y).\n\n2. Player A was not truthful and also chooses Y: In this case, both players choose Y, and the resulting payoff for each player is 2.\n\nSo, depending on whether Player A was truthful or not, the resulting payoffs for each player when Player B chooses Y are either (0, 3) or (2, 2)."
