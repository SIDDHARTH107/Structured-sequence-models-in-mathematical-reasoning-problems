    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the system of linear equations with the coefficients in a matrix form (augmented matrix):\n\n|  3   2  -1 |  8  |\n|  2  -2   4 | -2  |\n| -1  0.5 -1 | 0.5 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows.\nTo do this, we can perform the following row operations:\n- R2 = R2 - (2/3)R1\n- R3 = R3 + R1\n\n|  3    2   -1 |  8    |\n|  0   -4    6 | -10  |\n|  0    2.5 -2 |  8.5 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second element in the third row.\nTo do this, we can perform the following row operation:\n- R3 = R3 - (2.5/-4)R2\n\n|  3    2    -1 |  8   |\n|  0   -4     6 | -10 |\n|  0    0   -1.5|  3  |\n\nStep 3: Normalize the third row by dividing by -1.5.\n\n|  3    2    -1 |  8   |\n|  0   -4     6 | -10 |\n|  0    0     1 | -2  |\n\nStep 4: Back-substitute to find the values of x, y, and z.\n- From the third row, we have z = -2.\n- From the second row, we have -4y + 6(-2) = -10, which gives y = 1.\n- From the first row, we have 3x + 2(1) - (-2) = 8, which gives x = 1.\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 1, and z = -2."
