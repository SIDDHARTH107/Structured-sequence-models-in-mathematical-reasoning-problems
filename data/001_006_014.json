    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic equation y = -2x^2 + 8x + 5, we can use the vertex formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a = -2, b = 8, and c = 5.\n\nx = -8 / (2 * -2)\nx = -8 / -4\nx = 2\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-value back into the equation:\n\ny = -2(2)^2 + 8(2) + 5\ny = -2(4) + 16 + 5\ny = -8 + 16 + 5\ny = 13\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation is (2, 13).\n\nThe line of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the x-coordinate of the vertex. In this case, the line of symmetry is x = 2.\n\nSince the coefficient of the x^2 term is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward, which means it has a maximum value. The maximum value of the quadratic equation is the y-coordinate of the vertex, which is 13.\n\nIn summary:\n- Vertex: (2, 13)\n- Line of symmetry: x = 2\n- Maximum value: 13"
