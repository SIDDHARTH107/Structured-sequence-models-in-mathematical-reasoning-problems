    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of 3-Sylow subgroups of G divides 27 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Therefore, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups is either 1 or 27. \n\nCase 1: There is only one 3-Sylow subgroup.\nIf there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, then it must be normal in G. Let H be this normal 3-Sylow subgroup. Since the order of H is 9, H is either isomorphic to C_9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C_3 × C_3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3). \n\nIf H is isomorphic to C_9, then G has an element of order 9, say g. Now, since G has order 27, there must be an element h in G such that the order of h is 3 and h is not in H. Then, G can be generated by g and h, and since the orders of g and h are relatively prime, G is a cyclic group of order 27.\n\nIf H is isomorphic to C_3 × C_3, then G is a semidirect product of H and a group of order 3. Since Aut(H) has order 6, there is only one possible homomorphism from the group of order 3 to Aut(H), which is the trivial homomorphism. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and a group of order 3, which is C_3 × C_3 × C_3.\n\nCase 2: There are 27 3-Sylow subgroups.\nIf there are 27 3-Sylow subgroups, then each of them has order 9. Since there are 27 such subgroups, there are a total of 27 * 8 = 216 elements of order 9 in G. However, this is a contradiction since G has only 27 elements. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 27 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9 (C_3 × C_3 × C_3)."
