    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1), we first need to find the first and second partial derivatives of z with respect to x and y.\n\nThe first partial derivatives are:\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = 2y\n\nThe second partial derivatives are:\n∂²z/∂x² = 2\n∂²z/∂y² = 2\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients E, F, and G of the first fundamental form, which are given by:\nE = 1 + (∂z/∂x)^2\nF = (∂z/∂x)(∂z/∂y)\nG = 1 + (∂z/∂y)^2\n\nAt the point (1,1), we have:\nE = 1 + (2*1)^2 = 5\nF = (2*1)(2*1) = 4\nG = 1 + (2*1)^2 = 5\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficients L, M, and N of the second fundamental form, which are given by:\nL = ∂²z/∂x² / sqrt(E)\nM = ∂²z/∂x∂y / sqrt(E*G - F^2)\nN = ∂²z/∂y² / sqrt(G)\n\nAt the point (1,1), we have:\nL = 2 / sqrt(5)\nM = 0 / sqrt(5*5 - 4^2) = 0\nN = 2 / sqrt(5)\n\nFinally, we can find the mean curvature H, which is given by:\nH = (L*N - M^2) / (2*(E*G - F^2))\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nH = ((2/sqrt(5))*(2/sqrt(5)) - 0^2) / (2*(5*5 - 4^2))\nH = (4/5) / (2*(25 - 16))\nH = (4/5) / (2*9)\nH = 4 / (2*5*9)\nH = 1 / (5*9)\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1) is H = 1/(5*9) or approximately 0.0222."
