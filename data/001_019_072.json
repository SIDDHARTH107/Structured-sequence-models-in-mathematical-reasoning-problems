    "message_2": "To solve the equation |3x - 4| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 4 = 7\nTo solve for x, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Add 4 to both sides of the equation:\n3x = 11\n\n2. Divide both sides by 3:\nx = 11/3\n\nSo, in case 1, x = 11/3.\n\nCase 2: 3x - 4 = -7\nTo solve for x, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Add 4 to both sides of the equation:\n3x = -3\n\n2. Divide both sides by 3:\nx = -1\n\nSo, in case 2, x = -1.\n\nThus, the solutions for the equation |3x - 4| = 7 are x = 11/3 and x = -1."
