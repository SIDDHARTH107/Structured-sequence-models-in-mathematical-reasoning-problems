    "message_2": "To maximize the area of the rectangle with a given perimeter, we will use variational optimization. Let's denote the length of the rectangle as L and the width as W. We are given that the perimeter P is 20 units.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nSince we know the perimeter is 20 units, we can write:\n\n20 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, let's solve for W:\n\nW = (20 - 2L) / 2 = 10 - L\n\nThe area A of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nA = L * W\n\nSubstitute the expression for W into the area formula:\n\nA = L * (10 - L)\n\nNow, we have the area A as a function of the length L:\n\nA(L) = 10L - L^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we will find the critical points by taking the derivative of A(L) with respect to L and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dL = 10 - 2L\n\nSet dA/dL = 0 and solve for L:\n\n0 = 10 - 2L\n2L = 10\nL = 5\n\nNow, substitute the value of L back into the expression for W:\n\nW = 10 - L = 10 - 5 = 5\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle that maximize the area are length L = 5 units and width W = 5 units. This is a square with an area of 25 square units."
