    "message_1": "In a market, there are two types of used cars: high-quality cars and low-quality cars. The fraction of high-quality cars is 0.6, and the fraction of low-quality cars is 0.4. A seller knows whether the car is high or low quality, but the buyer cannot tell any difference. A high-quality car is worth $10,000 to the buyer and $7,500 to the seller; a low-quality car is worth $5,000 to the buyer and $2,500 to the seller. If the buyer is willing to pay $6,000 for a car, what type of car is most likely to be sold in the market?",
    "message_2": "To determine which type of car is most likely to be sold in the market, we need to consider the profit a seller can make for each type of car.\n\nFor a high-quality car:\nSelling price: $6,000\nSeller's valuation: $7,500\nProfit: $6,000 - $7,500 = -$1,500\n\nFor a low-quality car:\nSelling price: $6,000\nSeller's valuation: $2,500\nProfit: $6,000 - $2,500 = $3,500\n\nSince the profit for selling a low-quality car is higher than the profit for selling a high-quality car, sellers are more likely to sell low-quality cars in the market when the buyer is willing to pay $6,000."
