    "message_1": "A magician performs a trick where they shuffle a deck of cards and then correctly guess the color of the top card. If the deck contains 26 red cards and 26 black cards, what is the probability that the magician successfully guesses the color of the top card?",
    "message_2": "Since there are 26 red cards and 26 black cards in the deck, the probability of the top card being red is 26/52, and the probability of the top card being black is also 26/52. If the magician guesses the color of the top card, they have a 1/2 chance of being correct (either red or black). Therefore, the probability of the magician successfully guessing the color of the top card is 1/2 or 50%."
