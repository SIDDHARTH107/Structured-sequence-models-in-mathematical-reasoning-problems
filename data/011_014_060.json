    "message_1": "Suppose there are 7 cities connected by roads, and each road connects two cities. How many different ways are there to travel from City A to City B if you must visit exactly 4 cities on the way?",
    "message_2": "Let's label the cities A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. We need to find the number of ways to travel from City A to City B, visiting exactly 4 cities on the way. \n\nSince we need to visit 4 cities on the way, the total number of cities in the path will be 6 (including City A and City B). \n\nWe can break this problem down into two steps:\n\n1. Choose 4 cities out of the remaining 5 cities (C, D, E, F, G) to visit on the way.\n2. Arrange these 4 cities in a sequence.\n\nStep 1: We can choose 4 cities out of 5 in 5C4 ways, which is:\n\n5C4 = 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 ways to choose 4 cities out of the remaining 5 cities.\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to arrange these 4 cities in a sequence. Since there are 4 cities, we can arrange them in 4! (4 factorial) ways:\n\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n\nNow, we multiply the results of both steps to get the total number of ways to travel from City A to City B, visiting exactly 4 cities on the way:\n\nTotal ways = Ways to choose 4 cities × Ways to arrange the chosen cities\nTotal ways = 5 × 24 = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 different ways to travel from City A to City B, visiting exactly 4 cities on the way."
