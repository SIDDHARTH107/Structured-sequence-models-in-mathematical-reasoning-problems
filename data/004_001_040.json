    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2, we will use the power rule, which states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1). \n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 is:\n\nf'(x) = 3(2x^(2-1)) = 6x\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) = 12\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 at x = 2 is 12."
