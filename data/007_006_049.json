    "message_2": "The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm and taking the remainder until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nLet's find the GCD of 48 and 60 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\nStep 1: Divide the larger number (60) by the smaller number (48) and find the remainder.\n60 รท 48 = 1 with a remainder of 12.\n\nStep 2: Replace the larger number (60) with the smaller number (48) and the smaller number with the remainder (12).\nNow we need to find the GCD of 48 and 12.\n\nStep 3: Divide the larger number (48) by the smaller number (12) and find the remainder.\n48 รท 12 = 4 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is 0, we stop here. The last non-zero remainder, which is 12, is the GCD of 48 and 60.\n\nSo, the GCD(48, 60) = 12."
