    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given signal f(t) = sin(5t) + cos(7t) + 3, we can use the following formulas for the Fourier transform of sine and cosine functions:\n\nFourier transform of sin(at): F(ω) = (1/2j) [δ(ω - a) - δ(ω + a)]\nFourier transform of cos(at): F(ω) = (1/2) [δ(ω - a) + δ(ω + a)]\n\nHere, δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nApplying these formulas to the given signal:\n\nFourier transform of sin(5t): (1/2j) [δ(ω - 5) - δ(ω + 5)]\nFourier transform of cos(7t): (1/2) [δ(ω - 7) + δ(ω + 7)]\n\nSince the Fourier transform is a linear operation, we can find the Fourier transform of the sum of these functions by adding their individual Fourier transforms. Additionally, the Fourier transform of a constant (3 in this case) is just the constant multiplied by the Dirac delta function at ω = 0:\n\nFourier transform of 3: 3δ(ω)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the given signal f(t) is:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2j) [δ(ω - 5) - δ(ω + 5)] + (1/2) [δ(ω - 7) + δ(ω + 7)] + 3δ(ω)\n\nNow, let's determine if the system is stable or not. In the context of signal processing, a system is considered stable if its impulse response is absolutely integrable. However, the given signal f(t) is not an impulse response of a system, but rather a signal itself. Therefore, it's not possible to determine the stability of a system based on the given information.\n\nIf you meant to ask if the signal is bounded or not, we can analyze the signal f(t) = sin(5t) + cos(7t) + 3. Both sine and cosine functions are bounded between -1 and 1. Therefore, the given signal f(t) is also bounded, as it's a sum of bounded functions and a constant."
