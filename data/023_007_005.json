    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the given signal f(t) = 5sin(2πt) + 3cos(4πt), we need to use the Fourier transform formula. However, since the given signal is already in the sum of sinusoids form, we can directly identify the Fourier coefficients.\n\nThe general form of a Fourier series representation of a signal is:\n\nf(t) = a0 + Σ[an * cos(2πnft) + bn * sin(2πnft)]\n\nwhere a0, an, and bn are the Fourier coefficients, and f is the frequency.\n\nComparing this general form with the given signal f(t) = 5sin(2πt) + 3cos(4πt), we can identify the Fourier coefficients directly:\n\na0 = 0 (since there is no constant term)\n\nFor the sine term 5sin(2πt), we have:\nn1 = 1 (since 2πt = 2π(1)t)\nb1 = 5\n\nFor the cosine term 3cos(4πt), we have:\nn2 = 2 (since 4πt = 2π(2)t)\na2 = 3\n\nSince there are no other sine or cosine terms in the given signal, all other Fourier coefficients (an for n ≠ 2 and bn for n ≠ 1) are zero.\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients for the given signal f(t) = 5sin(2πt) + 3cos(4πt) are:\n\na0 = 0\na1 = 0\na2 = 3\nb1 = 5\nb2 = 0\n\nand all other an and bn coefficients are zero."
