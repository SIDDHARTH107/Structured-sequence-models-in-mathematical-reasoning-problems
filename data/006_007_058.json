    "message_1": "Suppose the probability of a certain stock's price increasing in a given day is 0.6, while the probability of it decreasing is 0.4. If the stock's current price is $100, what is the expected value of the stock's price at the end of the day?",
    "message_2": "Let's assume that the stock price increases by $x when it increases and decreases by $y when it decreases. The expected value of the stock's price at the end of the day can be calculated using the formula:\n\nExpected Value = (Probability of Increase * Increase Amount) + (Probability of Decrease * Decrease Amount)\n\nSince we don't have the exact values of x and y, we can represent the expected value in terms of x and y:\n\nExpected Value = (0.6 * (100 + x)) + (0.4 * (100 - y))\n\nHowever, without knowing the values of x and y, we cannot provide a numerical expected value for the stock's price at the end of the day."
