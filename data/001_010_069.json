    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:\n   3x + 6 - 6 = 21 - 6\n   3x = 15\n\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n   3x / 3 = 15 / 3\n   x = 5\n\nSo, the value of x is 5."
