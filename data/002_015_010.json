    "message_2": "The perimeter of a circle, also known as the circumference, can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 8 cm. So, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = 2π(8)\n\nC ≈ 2 × 3.14 × 8\n\nC ≈ 6.28 × 8\n\nC ≈ 50.24\n\nTherefore, the perimeter (circumference) of the circle is approximately 50.24 cm."
