    "message_1": "In a school with 500 students, the probability of a student passing the Math test is 0.8 and the probability of a student passing the Science test is 0.7. What is the probability that a randomly selected student from the school will pass both the Math and Science tests?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected student will pass both the Math and Science tests, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of passing each test.\n\nProbability of passing Math test = 0.8\nProbability of passing Science test = 0.7\n\nProbability of passing both tests = Probability of passing Math test × Probability of passing Science test\n= 0.8 × 0.7\n= 0.56\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected student will pass both the Math and Science tests is 0.56 or 56%."
