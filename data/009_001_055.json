At the beginning of the year, there were 200 rabbits, and by the end of the year, there were 240. Assuming the rate of growth is proportional to the population size, how many rabbits will there be in 3 years?",
    "message_2": "Let P(t) be the population of rabbits at time t (in years). Since the growth rate is proportional to the population size, we can model the population growth using the exponential growth equation:\n\nP(t) = P0 * e^(kt)\n\nwhere P0 is the initial population, k is the growth constant, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nWe are given that at the beginning of the year (t = 0), there were 200 rabbits, so P0 = 200. At the end of the year (t = 1), there were 240 rabbits, so P(1) = 240. We can use this information to find the growth constant k:\n\n240 = 200 * e^(k)\n1.2 = e^(k)\n\nTo solve for k, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1.2) = ln(e^(k))\nln(1.2) = k\n\nNow we can find the population of rabbits in 3 years (t = 3) using the exponential growth equation:\n\nP(3) = 200 * e^(ln(1.2) * 3)\n\nP(3) = 200 * (1.2)^3\nP(3) = 200 * 1.728\nP(3) â‰ˆ 345.6\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a rabbit, we can round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there will be approximately 346 rabbits in 3 years."
