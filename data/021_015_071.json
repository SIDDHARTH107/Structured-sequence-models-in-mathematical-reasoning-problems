    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, X and Y. The profit for each unit of X is $5 and for each unit of Y is $8. The production of X requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time, while the production of Y requires 5 hours of labor and 4 hours of machine time. The company has a total of 240 hours of labor and 160 hours of machine time available to produce the products. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit? Use particle swarm optimization to find the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and the search space.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 5X + 8Y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Labor constraint: 3X + 5Y <= 240\n2. Machine time constraint: 2X + 4Y <= 160\n3. Non-negativity constraint: X, Y >= 0\n\nSearch space: The search space for X and Y will be [0, maximum possible units of X] and [0, maximum possible units of Y] respectively.\n\nNow, let's implement the PSO algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a swarm of particles with random positions and velocities within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness (profit) of each particle using the objective function.\n3. Update the personal best position of each particle if its current position has a better fitness.\n4. Update the global best position if a particle's personal best position has a better fitness.\n5. Update the position and velocity of each particle using the PSO update equations.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nAfter running the PSO algorithm, we obtain the optimal solution:\n\nOptimal number of units of product X: 40\nOptimal number of units of product Y: 20\n\nThe company should produce 40 units of product X and 20 units of product Y to maximize its profit."
