    "message_2": "To estimate the probability of the die landing on an odd number using Monte Carlo simulation, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Roll the die 1000 times and record the results.\n2. Count the number of times the die lands on an odd number (1, 3, or 5).\n3. Divide the number of odd rolls by the total number of rolls (1000).\n\nSince the die is fair, the theoretical probability of landing on an odd number is 1/2, as there are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, and 5) out of the 6 possible outcomes. \n\nIn a Monte Carlo simulation, the estimated probability will likely be close to the theoretical probability of 1/2, but it may not be exactly 1/2 due to the randomness of the simulation. The more rolls you simulate, the closer the estimated probability will be to the theoretical probability."
