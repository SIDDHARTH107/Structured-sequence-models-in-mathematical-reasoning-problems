    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n   [ 2  3 -1 |  4]\n   [ 4 -2  3 |  6]\n   [-2  1  2 |  2]\n\n2. Perform row operations to get an upper triangular matrix:\n\n   - Multiply the first row by 2 and subtract it from the second row to eliminate x from the second equation:\n\n     [ 2  3 -1 |  4]\n     [ 0 -8  5 | -2]\n     [-2  1  2 |  2]\n\n   - Multiply the first row by -1 and add it to the third row to eliminate x from the third equation:\n\n     [ 2  3 -1 |  4]\n     [ 0 -8  5 | -2]\n     [ 0  4  1 |  6]\n\n   - Multiply the second row by -1/2 and add it to the third row to eliminate y from the third equation:\n\n     [ 2  3 -1 |  4]\n     [ 0 -8  5 | -2]\n     [ 0  0 -1 |  2]\n\n3. Perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n   - From the third equation, we have -z = 2, so z = -2.\n   - Substitute z into the second equation: -8y + 5(-2) = -2, so -8y = 8, and y = -1.\n   - Substitute y and z into the first equation: 2x + 3(-1) - (-2) = 4, so 2x = 3, and x = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 3/2, y = -1, and z = -2."
