    "message_2": "The complement of a set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in A. In this case, the universal set U is the set of integers between 1 to 10, which can be written as U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. \n\nTo find the complement of the set A, we need to find all the elements in U that are not in A. \n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nComparing the elements of U and A, we can see that the elements 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are not in A. Therefore, the complement of A is:\n\nA' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the complement is unique. To do this, we will use a proof by contradiction. \n\nAssume that there is another complement of A, called B, such that B ≠ A'. Since B is a complement of A, it must contain all the elements in U that are not in A. This means that B must also contain the elements 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. However, this is exactly the same as the set A'. Therefore, B = A', which contradicts our assumption that B ≠ A'. \n\nThis contradiction proves that the complement of A is unique, and there cannot be another set that is a complement of A other than A' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}."
