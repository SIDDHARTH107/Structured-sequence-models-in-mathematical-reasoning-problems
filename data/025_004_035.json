    "message_2": "A rational curve can be represented by the equation:\n\ny(x) = (P(x))/(Q(x))\n\nwhere P(x) and Q(x) are polynomials.\n\nSince we have three points, we can assume that P(x) and Q(x) are at most quadratic polynomials:\n\nP(x) = a * x^2 + b * x + c\nQ(x) = d * x^2 + e * x + f\n\nNow, we can use the given points to create a system of equations:\n\n1. (1,1): 1 = (a * 1^2 + b * 1 + c) / (d * 1^2 + e * 1 + f)\n2. (2,3): 3 = (a * 2^2 + b * 2 + c) / (d * 2^2 + e * 2 + f)\n3. (4,5): 5 = (a * 4^2 + b * 4 + c) / (d * 4^2 + e * 4 + f)\n\nSimplifying the equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = d + e + f\n2. 4a + 2b + c = 4d + 2e + f\n3. 16a + 4b + c = 16d + 4e + f\n\nWe can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 and equation 3:\n\n2 - 1: 3a + b = 3d + e\n3 - 1: 15a + 3b = 15d + 3e\n\nDivide the second equation by 3:\n\n5a + b = 5d + e\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns:\n\n3a + b = 3d + e\n5a + b = 5d + e\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n2a = 2d\n\nSo, a = d.\n\nNow we can substitute a = d back into the first equation:\n\n3a + b = 3a + e\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nb = e\n\nSince we have a = d and b = e, we can rewrite the rational curve equation as:\n\ny(x) = (a * x^2 + b * x + c) / (a * x^2 + b * x + f)\n\nNow, we can use any of the given points to find the value of c and f. Let's use the point (1,1):\n\n1 = (a + b + c) / (a + b + f)\n\nSince a = d and b = e, we have:\n\n1 = (a + a + c) / (a + a + f)\n1 = (2a + c) / (2a + f)\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by (2a + f):\n\n2a + f = 2a + c\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nf = c\n\nNow, our rational curve equation becomes:\n\ny(x) = (a * x^2 + b * x + c) / (a * x^2 + b * x + c)\n\nSince a, b, and c are non-zero, this rational curve is actually a linear function:\n\ny(x) = 1\n\nHowever, this does not satisfy the given points. Therefore, there is no rational curve with quadratic polynomials P(x) and Q(x) that passes through the points (1,1), (2,3), and (4,5)."
