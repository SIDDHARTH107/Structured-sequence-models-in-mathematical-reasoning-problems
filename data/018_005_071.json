    "message_2": "First, we need to find the complement of set A with respect to the universal set X. The complement of set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in X that are not in A.\n\nA' = {x ∈ X | x ∉ A}\n\nSince A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, the complement of A is:\n\nA' = {6, 7}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of set A and its complement A'. The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ A' = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ A'}\n\nSince A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and A' = {6, 7}, there are no common elements between A and A'. Therefore, the intersection of A and A' is an empty set:\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nThis proves that the intersection of set A and its complement A' is an empty set."
