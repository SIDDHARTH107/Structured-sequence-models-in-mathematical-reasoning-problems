    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using the Rail Fence cipher with a depth of 3, we write the letters diagonally in a zigzag pattern as follows:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, we read off the message row by row:\n\nHOR ELWLD LO\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"HORELWLDLO\"."
