    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base area of 25 square meters and a height of 10 meters. Calculate the volume of the rectangular pyramid.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of a pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × Base Area × Height\n\nGiven that the base area is 25 square meters and the height is 10 meters, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 25 × 10\n\nVolume = (1/3) × 250\n\nVolume = 250/3\n\nVolume ≈ 83.33 cubic meters\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is approximately 83.33 cubic meters."
