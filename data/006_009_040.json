    "message_1": "Suppose a certain medical condition occurs in 5% of a population. If a random sample of 500 individuals is taken from this population, what is the probability that at least 20 individuals in the sample will have the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k individuals with the medical condition in the sample\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k individuals from a sample of n (in this case, 500)\n- p is the probability of an individual having the medical condition (5% or 0.05)\n- n is the sample size (500)\n- k is the number of individuals with the medical condition\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 20 individuals with the medical condition, so we need to calculate the probability of having 20, 21, 22, ..., 500 individuals with the condition and sum these probabilities.\n\nHowever, it's easier to calculate the complementary probability (i.e., the probability of having fewer than 20 individuals with the condition) and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we need to calculate the probability of having 0, 1, 2, ..., 19 individuals with the condition and sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X < 20) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19)\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of having at least 20 individuals with the condition:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = 1 - P(X < 20)\n\nCalculating P(X < 20) using the binomial probability formula and summing the probabilities, we get:\n\nP(X < 20) ≈ 0.358\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least 20 individuals with the condition:\n\nP(X ≥ 20) = 1 - P(X < 20) = 1 - 0.358 ≈ 0.642\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 individuals in the sample will have the medical condition is approximately 64.2%."
