    "message_2": "The Legendre symbol, denoted by $(\\frac{a}{p})$, is defined for an odd prime number $p$ and an integer $a$ not divisible by $p$. It takes the value:\n\n1. $(\\frac{a}{p}) = 1$ if $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ (i.e., there exists an integer $x$ such that $x^2 \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$)\n2. $(\\frac{a}{p}) = -1$ if $a$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $p$ (i.e., there does not exist an integer $x$ such that $x^2 \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$)\n\nSo, the value of $(\\frac{a}{p})$ depends on whether $a$ is a quadratic residue or a quadratic non-residue modulo $p$. We cannot determine the exact value without knowing the specific values of $a$ and $p$."
