    "message_2": "To construct a 90% confidence interval for the population mean height of adult men, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere:\n- CI is the confidence interval\n- x̄ is the sample mean (175 cm)\n- t is the t-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (90%)\n- s is the sample standard deviation (6 cm)\n- n is the sample size (25)\n\nFirst, we need to find the t-score for a 90% confidence interval with 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24). Using a t-table or calculator, we find that the t-score for a 90% confidence interval with 24 degrees of freedom is approximately 1.711.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nCI = 175 ± (1.711 * (6 / √25))\nCI = 175 ± (1.711 * (6 / 5))\nCI = 175 ± (1.711 * 1.2)\nCI = 175 ± 2.0532\n\nSo, the 90% confidence interval for the population mean height of adult men is approximately 172.95 cm to 177.05 cm."
