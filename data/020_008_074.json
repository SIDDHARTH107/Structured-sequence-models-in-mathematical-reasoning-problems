    "message_2": "To solve this transportation problem, we can use the Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM) to find an initial feasible solution and then apply the Stepping Stone Method or the Modified Distribution Method (MODI) to optimize the solution.\n\nStep 1: Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM)\n1. Calculate the penalty cost for each row and column by subtracting the smallest cost from the second smallest cost in each row and column.\n2. Select the row or column with the highest penalty cost.\n3. Allocate as many units as possible to the cell with the lowest cost in the selected row or column.\n4. Cross out the row or column that has reached its required supply or demand.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 until all supplies and demands are met.\n\nStep 2: Optimality Check and Improvement\n1. Use the Stepping Stone Method or the Modified Distribution Method (MODI) to check if the current solution is optimal.\n2. If the solution is not optimal, improve the solution by reallocating units based on the method used.\n3. Repeat steps 1-2 until an optimal solution is found.\n\nAfter applying the Vogel's Approximation Method and the Modified Distribution Method, we get the following optimal shipping plan:\n\n|   | DC1 | DC2 | DC3 | DC4 | DC5 | DC6 | DC7 | DC8 |\n|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| F1 |  0  |  200 |  0  |   0 |  0   |  0 |  0   |  0   |\n| F2 |  0  |    0 |  0  |   0 |  200 |  0 |  0   |  0   |\n| F3 |  200 |    0 |  0  |   0 |  0   |  0 |  0   |  0   |\n| F4 |  0  |    0 |  200 |   0 |  0   |  0 |  0   |  0   |\n| F5 |  0  |    0 |  0  |   200 |  0   |  0 |  0   |  0   |\n| F6 |  0  |    0 |  0  |   0 |  0   |  200 |  200 |  0   |\n\nThe total transportation cost for this optimal shipping plan is:\n\n(3 * 0) + (2 * 200) + (7 * 0) + (6 * 0) + (7 * 0) + (8 * 0) + (5 * 0) + (2 * 0) +\n(8 * 0) + (6 * 0) + (4 * 0) + (5 * 0) + (4 * 200) + (4 * 0) + (9 * 0) + (5 * 0) +\n(2 * 200) + (8 * 0) + (3 * 0) + (3 * 0) + (9 * 0) + (8 * 0) + (9 * 0) + (3 * 0) +\n(7 * 0) + (3 * 0) + (5 * 200) + (8 * 0) + (9 * 0) + (4 * 0) + (8 * 0) + (7 * 0) +\n(5 * 0) + (4 * 0) + (9 * 0) + (7 * 200) + (8 * 0) + (7 * 0) + (6 * 0) + (5 * 0) +\n(9 * 0) + (7 * 0) + (8 * 0) + (6 * 0) + (6 * 0) + (3 * 200) + (2 * 200) + (9 * 0)\n\n= 400 + 800 + 1000 + 1400 + 600 + 400 = 4600\n\nThe optimal shipping plan has a total transportation cost of 4600."
