    "message_2": "The largest circular disk on the complex plane that does not contain any element of the Julia set related to the quadratic polynomial f(z) = z^2 + c, where c is a point on the Mandelbrot set, is known as the \"interior of the Mandelbrot set.\" \n\nThe area of this disk is not known exactly, but it is known to be less than 2. The exact area of the Mandelbrot set is an open question in mathematics, and no closed-form expression for the area is known. However, numerical approximations have been made, and the area is estimated to be around 1.50659177 square units."
