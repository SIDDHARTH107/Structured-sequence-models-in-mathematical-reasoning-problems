    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let the order of G be 6, which can be factored as 2 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup in G.\n\nLet P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G, and Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Then, the order of P is 2, and the order of Q is 3.\n\nSince the index of the Sylow 3-subgroup |G:Q| = 2, by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is either 1 or 2. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it is normal in G. Similarly, since the index of the Sylow 2-subgroup |G:P| = 3, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is either 1 or 3. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, then it is also normal in G.\n\nCase 1: Both P and Q are normal in G.\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since both P and Q are normal, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 2 * 3 = 6. Thus, PQ = G. Since P and Q are cyclic (as they have prime order), G is the internal direct product of P and Q, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nCase 2: P is normal in G, and there are two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups.\nIn this case, let Q1 and Q2 be the two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P is normal in G, the product PQ1 and PQ2 are also subgroups of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q1 are relatively prime, we have |PQ1| = |P| * |Q1| = 2 * 3 = 6, and similarly, |PQ2| = 6. Thus, PQ1 = PQ2 = G. \n\nNow, let a be a generator of P, and b be a generator of Q1. Then, G = {1, a, b, ab, b^2, ab^2}. Since P is normal in G, we have b * a * b^(-1) = bab^(-1) âˆˆ P. Since a and b have orders 2 and 3, respectively, bab^(-1) can only be either 1 or a. If bab^(-1) = 1, then ab = ba, and G is abelian, which contradicts the fact that there are two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups. Therefore, bab^(-1) = a, and G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
