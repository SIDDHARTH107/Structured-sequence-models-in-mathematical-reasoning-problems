    "message_2": "Sophie Germain primes are prime numbers p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. Let's find the Sophie Germain primes between 50 and 100.\n\n1. 53 is prime, and 2(53) + 1 = 107 is also prime. So, 53 is a Sophie Germain prime.\n2. 59 is prime, and 2(59) + 1 = 119 is not prime. So, 59 is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n3. 61 is prime, and 2(61) + 1 = 123 is not prime. So, 61 is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n4. 67 is prime, and 2(67) + 1 = 135 is not prime. So, 67 is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n5. 71 is prime, and 2(71) + 1 = 143 is not prime. So, 71 is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n6. 73 is prime, and 2(73) + 1 = 147 is not prime. So, 73 is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n7. 79 is prime, and 2(79) + 1 = 159 is not prime. So, 79 is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n8. 83 is prime, and 2(83) + 1 = 167 is also prime. So, 83 is a Sophie Germain prime.\n9. 89 is prime, and 2(89) + 1 = 179 is also prime. So, 89 is a Sophie Germain prime.\n10. 97 is prime, and 2(97) + 1 = 195 is not prime. So, 97 is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n\nThere are 3 Sophie Germain primes between 50 and 100: 53, 83, and 89."
