    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function $f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 2$ over the interval $[-1, 2]$, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function:\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(2x^3 - 3x^2 + 2) = 6x^2 - 6x$\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n$6x^2 - 6x = 0$\n\nFactor out a $6x$:\n\n$6x(x - 1) = 0$\n\nSo, the critical points are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. \n\nNow, we need to check the value of the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval $[-1, 2]$:\n\n$f(-1) = 2(-1)^3 - 3(-1)^2 + 2 = -1$\n$f(0) = 2(0)^3 - 3(0)^2 + 2 = 2$\n$f(1) = 2(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 + 2 = 1$\n$f(2) = 2(2)^3 - 3(2)^2 + 2 = 8$\n\nThe maximum value of the function over the interval $[-1, 2]$ is $8$, which occurs at $x = 2$."
