    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos(2x) = 0.5, we first need to find the angles for which the cosine is equal to 0.5. We can use the inverse cosine function to find these angles:\n\n2x = cos^(-1)(0.5)\n\nSince we are looking for angles between 0 and 360 degrees, we need to consider the periodicity of the cosine function. The cosine function has a period of 360 degrees, so we need to find all angles between 0 and 720 degrees (since 2x can go up to 720) that satisfy the equation:\n\n2x = 60°, 300°\n\nNow we need to divide these angles by 2 to find the values of x:\n\nx = 30°, 150°\n\nSo the solutions for x in the given range are 30° and 150°."
