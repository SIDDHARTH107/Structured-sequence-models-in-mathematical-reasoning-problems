    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in the graph. A complete subgraph is a subgraph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph G with edge set: {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (4,6)}.\n\nWe can see that vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 form a complete subgraph, as every pair of these vertices is connected by an edge: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), and (3,4). This complete subgraph has 4 vertices, so it is a 4-clique.\n\nNow, let's check if there is a larger clique in the graph. The remaining vertices are 5 and 6. Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 4 and 6, and vertex 6 is connected to vertices 4 and 5. There is no edge between vertices 5 and 6 and any of the vertices 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, there is no larger clique than the 4-clique we found.\n\nThus, the clique number of the given graph G is 4."
