    "message_1": "Assume that a network is under cyber attack and there are three types of attacks A, B, and C. The probability of attack A occurring at any given moment is 0.3, attack B occurring is 0.4 and attack C occurring is 0.2. What is the probability of at least one type of attack occurring at a given moment?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one type of attack occurring at a given moment, we can use the complementary probability rule. We will first find the probability of none of the attacks occurring and then subtract it from 1.\n\nLet D be the event that no attack occurs. The probability of D occurring is the complement of the sum of the probabilities of A, B, and C occurring. Since the events are mutually exclusive (only one type of attack can occur at a time), we can simply subtract the probabilities of A, B, and C from 1.\n\nP(D) = 1 - (P(A) + P(B) + P(C))\n\nP(D) = 1 - (0.3 + 0.4 + 0.2)\n\nP(D) = 1 - 0.9\n\nP(D) = 0.1\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least one type of attack occurring, which is the complement of P(D).\n\nP(at least one attack) = 1 - P(D)\n\nP(at least one attack) = 1 - 0.1\n\nP(at least one attack) = 0.9\n\nSo, the probability of at least one type of attack occurring at a given moment is 0.9."
