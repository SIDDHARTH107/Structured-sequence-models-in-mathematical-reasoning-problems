    "message_2": "Let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension 3 over a field k with Hodge numbers h^{1,1}=19 and h^{2,1}=281. By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we know that the Hodge numbers of Y are determined by the Hodge numbers of X as follows:\n\nh^{p,0}(Y) = h^{p,0}(X) for p ≤ 2,\nh^{p,0}(Y) = h^{p-1,0}(X) for p ≥ 3.\n\nNow, let's compute the Hodge numbers of Y. Since Y is a smooth hypersurface in X defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4, it has dimension 2. Thus, we have:\n\nh^{0,0}(Y) = h^{0,0}(X) = 1 (by definition, as both X and Y are non-empty),\nh^{1,0}(Y) = h^{1,0}(X) = 0 (as X is a smooth projective variety),\nh^{2,0}(Y) = h^{2,0}(X) = 0 (as X is a smooth projective variety),\nh^{3,0}(Y) = h^{2,0}(X) = 0 (as X is a smooth projective variety).\n\nNow, we can compute the intersection cohomology groups I^p(Y) using the Hodge numbers of Y. Recall that the intersection cohomology groups are given by:\n\nI^p(Y) = H^{p,0}(Y) ⊕ H^{p-1,1}(Y) ⊕ ... ⊕ H^{0,p}(Y).\n\nThus, we have:\n\nI^0(Y) = H^{0,0}(Y) = k (the base field),\nI^1(Y) = H^{1,0}(Y) = 0,\nI^2(Y) = H^{2,0}(Y) ⊕ H^{1,1}(Y) = 19k,\nI^3(Y) = H^{3,0}(Y) ⊕ H^{2,1}(Y) = 281k,\nI^4(Y) = H^{2,2}(Y) = (h^{2,0}(Y) + h^{1,1}(Y) + h^{0,2}(Y))k = (0 + 19 + 0)k = 19k,\nI^5(Y) = H^{1,4}(Y) = 0,\nI^6(Y) = H^{0,6}(Y) = 0.\n\nSo, the intersection cohomology groups I^p(Y) are:\n\nI^0(Y) = k,\nI^1(Y) = 0,\nI^2(Y) = 19k,\nI^3(Y) = 281k,\nI^4(Y) = 19k,\nI^5(Y) = 0,\nI^6(Y) = 0."
