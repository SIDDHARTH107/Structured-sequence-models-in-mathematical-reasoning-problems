    "message_2": "The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers by dividing the larger number by the smaller number, then dividing the remainder by the smaller number, and so on until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nLet's find the GCD of 54 and 24 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1. Divide 54 by 24:\n   54 รท 24 = 2 with a remainder of 6.\n\n2. Divide the previous divisor (24) by the remainder (6):\n   24 รท 6 = 4 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we have reached a remainder of 0, the last non-zero remainder, which is 6, is the GCD of 54 and 24. Therefore, the GCD(54, 24) = 6."
