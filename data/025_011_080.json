    "message_2": "To find the number of rational points on the curve $2E$, we first need to understand the group law on elliptic curves and the process of point doubling.\n\nGiven an elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$ over a field $K$, the set of points on the curve, together with a special point called the point at infinity, form an abelian group under an operation called \"point addition\". The point at infinity, denoted by $\\mathcal{O}$, serves as the identity element of the group.\n\nPoint doubling is a special case of point addition, where we add a point $P$ to itself. The formula for point doubling is given by:\n\n$2P = (x_3, y_3)$, where\n$x_3 = \\frac{(3x_1^2 + A)^2}{4y_1^2} - 2x_1$\n$y_3 = \\frac{3x_1^2 + A}{2y_1}(x_1 - x_3) - y_1$\n\nNow, let's consider the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 1$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. To find the number of rational points on the curve $2E$, we need to find the number of rational points obtained by doubling each point of $E$.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the curve $2E$ is not a separate elliptic curve. The notation $2E$ refers to the set of points obtained by doubling each point of $E$. These points still lie on the same elliptic curve $E$.\n\nSo, to find the number of rational points on $2E$, we need to find the number of rational points on $E$ that can be obtained by doubling another rational point on $E$. This is equivalent to finding the number of rational points of order 2 on $E$.\n\nAn elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has a torsion subgroup that is isomorphic to either $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}/2n\\mathbb{Z}$, where $n$ is a positive integer. In the first case, there is only one point of order 2 (the point at infinity), and in the second case, there are three points of order 2.\n\nTo determine the torsion subgroup of $E$, we can use the Nagell-Lutz theorem, which states that if $E$ has a rational point $(x, y)$ of order $m > 1$, then $y = 0$ or $y^2 | \\Delta(E)$, where $\\Delta(E)$ is the discriminant of the curve. For our curve $E: y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 1$, the discriminant is $\\Delta(E) = -16(4(3)^3 + 27(1)^2) = -16(108 + 27) = -16(135) = -2160$.\n\nWe can now search for rational points $(x, y)$ on $E$ with $y^2 | \\Delta(E)$. Since $y^2 | -2160$, we have the possibilities $y = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6$. Checking these values, we find that there are no rational points of order 2 on $E$ other than the point at infinity.\n\nTherefore, the number of rational points on the curve $2E$ is 1, which is just the point at infinity."
