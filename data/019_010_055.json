    "message_1": "Let's start with a problem on linear logic. Consider the following formulas:\n\nA & B, A -> B, A ⊸ B\n\nFor each of these formulas, suppose we know that A is true. Determine which of the following statements about B must be true and which must be false, and explain your reasoning.\n\n1) B is true\n2) B is false\n3) We cannot determine whether B is true or false",
    "message_2": "For each of the formulas, let's analyze them one by one:\n\n1. A & B: This formula represents the logical conjunction (AND) of A and B. If A is true, then for the whole formula to be true, B must also be true. Therefore, in this case, statement 1 (B is true) must be true.\n\n2. A -> B: This formula represents the logical implication (IF-THEN) of A and B. If A is true, then the implication holds only if B is also true. Therefore, in this case, statement 1 (B is true) must be true.\n\n3. A ⊸ B: This formula represents the linear implication (linear logic) of A and B. In linear logic, resources are considered and cannot be reused. If A is true, it does not necessarily mean that B is true or false. We cannot determine the truth value of B based on the truth value of A alone. Therefore, in this case, statement 3 (We cannot determine whether B is true or false) must be true.\n\nIn summary:\n- For A & B and A -> B, B must be true if A is true.\n- For A ⊸ B, we cannot determine whether B is true or false if A is true."
