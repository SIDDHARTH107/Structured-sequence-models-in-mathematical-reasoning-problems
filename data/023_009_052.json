    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using the Fourier transform, we first need to rewrite the given differential equation in terms of the Fourier transform. Let's denote the Fourier transform of $u(x)$ as $\\hat{u}(k)$, where $k$ is the frequency variable. The Fourier transform of the second derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$ is $-k^2\\hat{u}(k)$. So, the given differential equation in the Fourier domain becomes:\n\n$-k^2\\hat{u}(k) + \\hat{u}(k) = 0$\n\nNow, let's solve this equation for $\\hat{u}(k)$:\n\n$\\hat{u}(k) (1 - k^2) = 0$\n\nThis equation implies that $\\hat{u}(k) = 0$ for $k \\neq \\pm 1$. For $k = \\pm 1$, we have:\n\n$u(x) = A\\cos(x) + B\\sin(x)$\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions to find the values of $A$ and $B$. Using $u(0) = 1$, we get:\n\n$1 = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) \\Rightarrow A = 1$\n\nNow, using $u(\\pi) = 1$, we get:\n\n$1 = \\cos(\\pi) + B\\sin(\\pi) \\Rightarrow B = 0$\n\nSo, the solution to the given boundary value problem is:\n\n$u(x) = \\cos(x)$"
