    "message_2": "To find the probability of finding at least one defective unit in a lot of 1,000, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability is the probability of the opposite event occurring, which in this case is the probability of finding no defective units in the lot.\n\nThe probability of not finding a defective unit is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince there are 1,000 units in the lot, the probability of not finding a defective unit for all 1,000 units is (0.95)^1000.\n\nNow, to find the probability of finding at least one defective unit, we subtract the probability of not finding any defective units from 1:\n\nP(at least one defective) = 1 - P(no defective units)\nP(at least one defective) = 1 - (0.95)^1000\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nP(at least one defective) ≈ 1 - 0.0000454\nP(at least one defective) ≈ 0.9999546\n\nSo, the probability of finding at least one defective unit in a lot of 1,000 is approximately 0.9999546 or 99.99546%."
