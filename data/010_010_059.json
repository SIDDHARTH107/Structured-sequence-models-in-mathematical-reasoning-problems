    "message_2": "(a) To find the critical points of $f$, we need to find the points where the gradient of $f$ is equal to the zero vector. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla f(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = (3x^2 - 3y^2, -6xy).$\n\nSetting the components of the gradient equal to zero, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0$\n$-6xy = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have either $x = 0$ or $y = 0$. \n\nIf $x = 0$, the first equation becomes $-3y^2 = 0$, which implies $y = 0$. So, one critical point is $(0,0)$.\n\nIf $y = 0$, the first equation becomes $3x^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 0$. This case leads to the same critical point $(0,0)$.\n\nThus, the only critical point of $f$ is $(0,0)$.\n\nTo classify the critical point, we compute the Hessian matrix of $f$:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n6x & -6y \\\\\n-6y & -6x\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nEvaluating the Hessian at the critical point $(0,0)$, we get:\n\n$H(f)(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSince the Hessian is not invertible, we cannot use the Second Derivative Test directly. However, we can analyze the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix for points near $(0,0)$. Notice that the determinant of the Hessian matrix is given by:\n\n$\\det(H(f)) = (6x)(-6x) - (-6y)(-6y) = -36x^2 - 36y^2$\n\nSince the determinant is negative for any point $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$, the Hessian matrix will have one positive eigenvalue and one negative eigenvalue. Therefore, the critical point $(0,0)$ is a saddle point.\n\n(b) To show that $f$ has exactly one global minimum, we first observe that $f(0,0) = 0^3 - 3(0)(0^2) = 0$. Now, let's consider the behavior of $f$ as $||(x,y)|| \\rightarrow \\infty$. We have:\n\n$f(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2 = x(x^2 - 3y^2)$\n\nAs $||(x,y)|| \\rightarrow \\infty$, either $x \\rightarrow \\infty$ or $y \\rightarrow \\infty$. In either case, $f(x,y) \\rightarrow \\infty$ or $f(x,y) \\rightarrow -\\infty$. This means that the function value goes to infinity or negative infinity as we move away from the origin. Since $f(0,0) = 0$, this implies that there must be a global minimum at $(0,0)$, and it is unique since the function value increases as we move away from the origin.\n\n(c) Morse theory states that the number of critical points of a function with function value less than or equal to a given constant is equal to the sum of the Betti numbers of the sublevel set up to that constant. In our case, the constant is $0$, and the only critical point is the saddle point at $(0,0)$ with function value $0$. \n\nThe sublevel set for $f$ with function value less than or equal to $0$ is given by:\n\n$S = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : f(x,y) \\leq 0\\}$\n\nSince $f(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$, we have:\n\n$S = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : x^3 \\geq 3xy^2\\}$\n\nThe Betti numbers of this sublevel set are $b_0 = 1$ and $b_1 = 0$. The sum of the Betti numbers is:\n\n$b_0 + b_1 = 1 + 0 = 1$\n\nThus, by Morse theory, there is exactly one critical point of $f$ with function value less than or equal to $0$."
