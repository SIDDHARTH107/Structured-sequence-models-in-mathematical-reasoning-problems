    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of people who prefer vanilla ice cream, we will use the following formula:\n\nCI = p ± Z * √(p(1-p)/n)\n\nwhere:\n- CI is the confidence interval\n- p is the sample proportion (320/1000 = 0.32)\n- Z is the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval (1.96)\n- n is the sample size (1000)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error:\n\nSE = √(p(1-p)/n) = √(0.32(1-0.32)/1000) = √(0.32(0.68)/1000) = √(0.2176/1000) = 0.0147\n\nNow, let's calculate the margin of error:\n\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * 0.0147 = 0.0288\n\nFinally, let's calculate the confidence interval:\n\nCI = p ± ME = 0.32 ± 0.0288 = (0.32 - 0.0288, 0.32 + 0.0288) = (0.2912, 0.3488)\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of people who prefer vanilla ice cream is (0.2912, 0.3488)."
