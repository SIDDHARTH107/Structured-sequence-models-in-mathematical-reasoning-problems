    "message_1": "A circle has a radius of 6 cm. Find the area of a sector of the circle if the central angle of the sector is 60 degrees.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this problem, the radius (r) is 6 cm and the central angle is 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) × π × 6²\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 36\n\nArea of sector = 6π cm²\n\nSo, the area of the sector is 6π square centimeters."
