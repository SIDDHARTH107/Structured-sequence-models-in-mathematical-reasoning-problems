Assuming that the bar is insulated on both ends, find the temperature distribution of the bar after 2 seconds using the Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution of the bar after 2 seconds using the Fourier transform, we first need to express the initial temperature distribution as a Fourier series. Since the bar is insulated on both ends, we can use the sine series representation:\n\nT(x,0) = sin(2*pi*x/10) - sin(4*pi*x/10)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution of the heat equation using the Fourier series:\n\nT(x,t) = âˆ‘[B_n * sin(n*pi*x/L) * exp(-n^2 * pi^2 * alpha * t / L^2)]\n\nwhere L is the length of the bar (10 cm), alpha is the thermal diffusivity (5 cm^2/s), and B_n are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nIn this case, we can see that the initial temperature distribution is already in the form of a sine series, so we can identify the Fourier coefficients directly:\n\nB_1 = 0 (since there is no sin(pi*x/10) term)\nB_2 = 1 (coefficient of sin(2*pi*x/10))\nB_3 = 0 (since there is no sin(3*pi*x/10) term)\nB_4 = -1 (coefficient of sin(4*pi*x/10))\n\nNow, we can plug these coefficients into the general solution of the heat equation:\n\nT(x,t) = B_2 * sin(2*pi*x/10) * exp(-2^2 * pi^2 * 5 * t / 10^2) - B_4 * sin(4*pi*x/10) * exp(-4^2 * pi^2 * 5 * t / 10^2)\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature distribution after 2 seconds by plugging in t = 2:\n\nT(x,2) = sin(2*pi*x/10) * exp(-4 * pi^2 * 5 * 2 / 10^2) - sin(4*pi*x/10) * exp(-16 * pi^2 * 5 * 2 / 10^2)\n\nT(x,2) = sin(2*pi*x/10) * exp(-2 * pi^2) - sin(4*pi*x/10) * exp(-8 * pi^2)\n\nThis is the temperature distribution of the bar after 2 seconds."
