    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between node A and node F, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance to the starting node (A) as 0 and the distance to all other nodes as infinity.\n2. Set the current node as the starting node (A).\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the tentative distance through the current node. If this distance is less than the current known distance, update the known distance.\n4. Mark the current node as visited.\n5. Select the unvisited node with the smallest known distance as the new current node and repeat steps 3-5 until all nodes have been visited or the target node (F) has been visited.\n\nApplying the algorithm:\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {A, B, C, D, E, F}; Distance: A=0, B=∞, C=∞, D=∞, E=∞, F=∞\n2. Current node: A\n3. Update distances: A=0, B=2, C=4, D=1, E=∞, F=∞\n4. Visited nodes: {A}\n5. New current node: D (smallest distance among unvisited nodes)\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {B, C, D, E, F}; Distance: A=0, B=2, C=4, D=1, E=∞, F=∞\n2. Current node: D\n3. Update distances: A=0, B=2, C=4, D=1, E=6, F=∞\n4. Visited nodes: {A, D}\n5. New current node: B (smallest distance among unvisited nodes)\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {B, C, E, F}; Distance: A=0, B=2, C=4, D=1, E=6, F=∞\n2. Current node: B\n3. Update distances: A=0, B=2, C=4, D=1, E=6, F=11\n4. Visited nodes: {A, D, B}\n5. New current node: C (smallest distance among unvisited nodes)\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {C, E, F}; Distance: A=0, B=2, C=4, D=1, E=6, F=11\n2. Current node: C\n3. Update distances: A=0, B=2, C=4, D=1, E=6, F=11\n4. Visited nodes: {A, D, B, C}\n5. New current node: E (smallest distance among unvisited nodes)\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {E, F}; Distance: A=0, B=2, C=4, D=1, E=6, F=11\n2. Current node: E\n3. Update distances: A=0, B=2, C=4, D=1, E=6, F=11\n4. Visited nodes: {A, D, B, C, E}\n5. New current node: F (smallest distance among unvisited nodes)\n\n1. Unvisited nodes: {F}; Distance: A=0, B=2, C=4, D=1, E=6, F=11\n2. Current node: F\n3. Update distances: A=0, B=2, C=4, D=1, E=6, F=11\n4. Visited nodes: {A, D, B, C, E, F}\n\nThe shortest path between node A and node F is A -> D -> E -> F, and the length of that path is 11."
