    "message_2": "Since ω is closed and non-exact, it represents a non-zero cohomology class in the k-th cohomology group H^k(M). By Poincaré duality, there exists a non-zero homology class in the (n-k)-th homology group H_(n-k)(M) that pairs non-trivially with the cohomology class of ω. Let [A] be such a homology class, and let A be a smooth, oriented submanifold of M of dimension n-k representing [A].\n\nNow, consider the intersection product of homology classes, which is a well-defined operation on the homology groups of M. For any singular k-chain σ in M, let [σ] be its homology class in H_k(M). The intersection product [A] ∩ [σ] is an element of H_1(M), and it can be represented by a 1-dimensional submanifold N of M.\n\nBy definition of the intersection product, the integral of ω over σ is equal to the intersection number of A and σ, which is the algebraic count of the intersection points of A and σ, weighted by the local orientation of A and σ at each intersection point. Since [A] and ω pair non-trivially, there exists at least one singular k-chain σ' such that the intersection number of A and σ' is non-zero. Therefore, the integral of ω over σ' is non-zero.\n\nNow, let N be the 1-dimensional submanifold of M representing the homology class [A] ∩ [σ']. We claim that N has the desired property. Indeed, for any singular k-chain σ in M that intersects N, the intersection number of A and σ is non-zero, since it is equal to the intersection number of A and σ'. Therefore, the integral of ω over σ is non-zero, as required.\n\nIn conclusion, there exists a submanifold N of dimension n-k+1 such that the integral of ω over any singular k-chain in M that intersects N is non-zero."
