    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method with N = 5 equally spaced nodes, we first need to discretize the spatial domain and create a mesh. Since we have N = 5 nodes, we will have 4 equally spaced elements. The nodes will be at x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.\n\nNext, we define the linear basis functions (also known as shape functions) for each element. Let $\\phi_i(x)$ be the basis function associated with node i. The basis functions are defined as:\n\n$\\phi_1(x) = \\begin{cases} \n      4x & 0 \\le x \\le 0.25 \\\\\n      0 & \\text{otherwise}\n   \\end{cases}$\n\n$\\phi_2(x) = \\begin{cases} \n      4(0.25 - x) & 0 \\le x \\le 0.25 \\\\\n      4(x - 0.5) & 0.25 \\le x \\le 0.5 \\\\\n      0 & \\text{otherwise}\n   \\end{cases}$\n\n$\\phi_3(x) = \\begin{cases} \n      4(0.5 - x) & 0.25 \\le x \\le 0.5 \\\\\n      4(x - 0.75) & 0.5 \\le x \\le 0.75 \\\\\n      0 & \\text{otherwise}\n   \\end{cases}$\n\n$\\phi_4(x) = \\begin{cases} \n      4(1 - x) & 0.75 \\le x \\le 1 \\\\\n      0 & \\text{otherwise}\n   \\end{cases}$\n\nNow, we approximate the solution u(x,t) as a linear combination of the basis functions:\n\n$u(x,t) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i(t) \\phi_i(x)$\n\nSubstitute this approximation into the PDE and apply the Galerkin method to obtain a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the coefficients $c_i(t)$. The resulting ODEs are:\n\n$\\frac{d c_1}{d t} = \\frac{16}{3} (c_2 - c_1)$\n\n$\\frac{d c_2}{d t} = \\frac{16}{3} (c_1 - 2c_2 + c_3)$\n\n$\\frac{d c_3}{d t} = \\frac{16}{3} (c_2 - 2c_3 + c_4)$\n\n$\\frac{d c_4}{d t} = \\frac{16}{3} (c_3 - c_4)$\n\nThe initial conditions for the coefficients are given by:\n\n$c_i(0) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sin(\\pi x) \\phi_i(x) dx$\n\nSolving these integrals, we get:\n\n$c_1(0) = \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} (1 - \\cos(\\pi/4))$\n\n$c_2(0) = \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} (\\cos(\\pi/4) - \\cos(\\pi/2))$\n\n$c_3(0) = \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} (\\cos(\\pi/2) - \\cos(3\\pi/4))$\n\n$c_4(0) = \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} (\\cos(3\\pi/4) - 1)$\n\nNow, we can solve the system of ODEs using a numerical method, such as the forward Euler method, with a small time step (e.g., $\\Delta t = 0.01$) until we reach the desired time $t = 0.1$. After solving the ODEs, we can compute the numerical solution $u(x,0.1)$ using the approximation:\n\n$u(x,0.1) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i(0.1) \\phi_i(x)$"
