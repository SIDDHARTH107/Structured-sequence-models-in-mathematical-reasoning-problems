    "message_1": "In a company's network of 1000 computers, the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on any given computer is 0.03. What is the probability that at least 30 computers in the network will be affected by a ransomware attack?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 30 computers will be affected by a ransomware attack, we can use the complement probability, which is the probability of the opposite event occurring. In this case, the opposite event is that fewer than 30 computers are affected by the ransomware attack.\n\nLet X be the number of computers affected by a ransomware attack. We want to find P(X ≥ 30). Using the complement probability, we have:\n\nP(X ≥ 30) = 1 - P(X < 30)\n\nSince the number of computers is large (1000) and the probability of a ransomware attack is relatively small (0.03), we can approximate this problem using the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is defined by the parameter λ (lambda), which is the average number of events (ransomware attacks) in the interval (number of computers). In this case, λ = 1000 * 0.03 = 30.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of fewer than 30 computers being affected using the Poisson distribution:\n\nP(X < 30) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 29)\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nUsing the PMF, we can calculate the probabilities for k = 0 to 29 and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 30) = Σ [(e^(-30) * 30^k) / k!] for k = 0 to 29\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least 30 computers being affected:\n\nP(X ≥ 30) = 1 - P(X < 30)\n\nCalculating this sum and subtracting it from 1 can be done using software or a calculator with Poisson distribution functions. The result is:\n\nP(X ≥ 30) ≈ 0.5934\n\nSo, the probability that at least 30 computers in the network will be affected by a ransomware attack is approximately 59.34%."
