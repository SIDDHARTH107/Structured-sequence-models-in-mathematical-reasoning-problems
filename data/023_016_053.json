    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of f(x), we need to compute the coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n. The general formula for the Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nwhere the sum is taken from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\n\nWe need to split this integral into three parts, corresponding to the three intervals where f(x) is defined:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (-1) dx + ∫[0, π/2] (3) dx + ∫[π/2, π] (2) dx]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(-1 * π) + (3 * π/2) + (2 * π/2)]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * (π)\n\na_0 = 1\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nAgain, we split this integral into three parts:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (-1) * cos(n * x) dx + ∫[0, π/2] (3) * cos(n * x) dx + ∫[π/2, π] (2) * cos(n * x) dx]\n\nNow, we integrate and simplify:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n) * sin(n * x) |[-π, 0] + (3/n) * sin(n * x) |[0, π/2] + (2/n) * sin(n * x) |[π/2, π]]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n) * (sin(n * π) - sin(0)) + (3/n) * (sin(n * π/2) - sin(0)) + (2/n) * (sin(n * π) - sin(n * π/2))]\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, we can simplify this to:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(3/n) * sin(n * π/2) + (2/n) * (-sin(n * π/2))]\n\na_n = (1/π) * (n * (3 - 2) * sin(n * π/2))\n\na_n = (1/π) * n * sin(n * π/2)\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nSplitting the integral into three parts:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (-1) * sin(n * x) dx + ∫[0, π/2] (3) * sin(n * x) dx + ∫[π/2, π] (2) * sin(n * x) dx]\n\nNow, we integrate and simplify:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/n) * cos(n * x) |[-π, 0] - (3/n) * cos(n * x) |[0, π/2] + (2/n) * cos(n * x) |[π/2, π]]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/n) * (cos(0) - cos(n * π)) - (3/n) * (cos(n * π/2) - cos(0)) + (2/n) * (cos(n * π) - cos(n * π/2))]\n\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n for all integer values of n, we can simplify this to:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/n) * (1 - (-1)^n) - (3/n) * (cos(n * π/2) - 1) + (2/n) * ((-1)^n - cos(n * π/2))]\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier series of f(x) up to the fourth harmonic:\n\nf(x) = 1/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x))\n\nf(x) = 1/2 + Σ[((1/π) * n * sin(n * π/2)) * cos(n * x) + ((1/π) * (1 - (-1)^n) - (3/n) * (cos(n * π/2) - 1) + (2/n) * ((-1)^n - cos(n * π/2))) * sin(n * x)]\n\nFor n = 1 to 4:\n\nf(x) ≈ 1/2 + a_1 * cos(x) + b_1 * sin(x) + a_2 * cos(2 * x) + b_2 * sin(2 * x) + a_3 * cos(3 * x) + b_3 * sin(3 * x) + a_4 * cos(4 * x) + b_4 * sin(4 * x)\n\nPlug in the values of a_n and b_n to get the Fourier series of f(x) up to the fourth harmonic."
