    "message_1": "In a network with 50 computers, the probability of a phishing attack occurring on any given computer is 0.08. What is the probability that at least 4 computers will experience a phishing attack in the next week?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 4 computers will experience a phishing attack, we can use the complementary probability. That is, we will find the probability that 0, 1, 2, or 3 computers experience a phishing attack and then subtract that from 1.\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of k successes (phishing attacks) in n trials (computers):\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (phishing attack), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (no phishing attack).\n\nFirst, let's find the probabilities for 0, 1, 2, and 3 phishing attacks:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(50, 0) * 0.08^0 * (1-0.08)^(50-0)\nP(X = 1) = C(50, 1) * 0.08^1 * (1-0.08)^(50-1)\nP(X = 2) = C(50, 2) * 0.08^2 * (1-0.08)^(50-2)\nP(X = 3) = C(50, 3) * 0.08^3 * (1-0.08)^(50-3)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 1 * 1 * 0.000002 ≈ 0.000002\nP(X = 1) ≈ 50 * 0.08 * 0.000006 ≈ 0.000024\nP(X = 2) ≈ 1225 * 0.0064 * 0.000020 ≈ 0.000196\nP(X = 3) ≈ 19600 * 0.000512 * 0.000065 ≈ 0.000655\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 4 phishing attacks by subtracting the sum of the probabilities of 0, 1, 2, and 3 phishing attacks from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 4) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3))\nP(X ≥ 4) ≈ 1 - (0.000002 + 0.000024 + 0.000196 + 0.000655)\nP(X ≥ 4) ≈ 1 - 0.000877\nP(X ≥ 4) ≈ 0.999123\n\nSo, the probability that at least 4 computers will experience a phishing attack in the next week is approximately 0.999 or 99.9%."
