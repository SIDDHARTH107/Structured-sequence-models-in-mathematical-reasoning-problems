Also, assume that the reaction $f(u)$ is given by $f(u) = au - bu^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive constants. \n\nDetermine the concentration profile $u(x,y,t)$ for different times $t$ and explain how the solution changes over time.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given reaction-diffusion equation with the given initial condition, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)$. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n$$ X(x)Y(y)\\dfrac{dT(t)}{dt} = D_1 X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + D_2 X(x)Y''(y)T(t) + (aX(x)Y(y)T(t) - bX^2(x)Y^2(y)T^2(t)) $$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)T(t)$:\n\n$$ \\dfrac{1}{T(t)}\\dfrac{dT(t)}{dt} = D_1 \\dfrac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + D_2 \\dfrac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} + a - b\\dfrac{X(x)Y(y)T(t)}{X(x)Y(y)} $$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $t$ and the right-hand side depends only on $x$ and $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-k^2$. Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $\\dfrac{1}{T(t)}\\dfrac{dT(t)}{dt} + k^2 = 0$\n2) $D_1 \\dfrac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + D_2 \\dfrac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} + a - b\\dfrac{X(x)Y(y)T(t)}{X(x)Y(y)} = -k^2$\n\nSolving the first ODE, we get:\n\n$$ \\dfrac{dT(t)}{dt} = -k^2T(t) $$\n\nThe solution to this ODE is:\n\n$$ T(t) = T_0 e^{-k^2t} $$\n\nwhere $T_0$ is a constant.\n\nNow, let's focus on the second ODE. Since $D_1 = D_2$, we can rewrite it as:\n\n$$ D \\dfrac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + D \\dfrac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} + a - b\\dfrac{X(x)Y(y)T(t)}{X(x)Y(y)} = -k^2 $$\n\nDividing both sides by $D$, we get:\n\n$$ \\dfrac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\dfrac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} + \\dfrac{a}{D} - b\\dfrac{X(x)Y(y)T(t)}{DX(x)Y(y)} = -\\dfrac{k^2}{D} $$\n\nNow, let's separate the variables:\n\n$$ \\dfrac{X''(x)}{X(x)} - b\\dfrac{X(x)T(t)}{DX(x)} = -\\dfrac{k^2}{D} - \\dfrac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} - \\dfrac{a}{D} $$\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $x$ and the right-hand side depends only on $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-m^2$. Thus, we have two more ordinary differential equations:\n\n3) $\\dfrac{X''(x)}{X(x)} - b\\dfrac{X(x)T(t)}{DX(x)} = -m^2$\n4) $-\\dfrac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} - \\dfrac{a}{D} = -k^2 - m^2$\n\nSolving the third ODE, we get:\n\n$$ X''(x) - m^2X(x) + bX(x)T(t) = 0 $$\n\nThe solution to this ODE is not straightforward, as it involves a time-dependent term. However, we can make an approximation by assuming that the time-dependent term is negligible for large times. In this case, the ODE becomes:\n\n$$ X''(x) - m^2X(x) = 0 $$\n\nThe solution to this ODE is:\n\n$$ X(x) = A\\cos(mx) + B\\sin(mx) $$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants.\n\nSolving the fourth ODE, we get:\n\n$$ Y''(y) + (k^2 + m^2 - \\dfrac{a}{D})Y(y) = 0 $$\n\nThe solution to this ODE is:\n\n$$ Y(y) = C\\cos(ny) + D\\sin(ny) $$\n\nwhere $n^2 = k^2 + m^2 - \\dfrac{a}{D}$, and $C$ and $D$ are constants.\n\nNow, the solution to the original PDE is given by:\n\n$$ u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t) = (A\\cos(mx) + B\\sin(mx))(C\\cos(ny) + D\\sin(ny))T_0 e^{-k^2t} $$\n\nTo find the constants $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $T_0$, we need to use the given initial condition and boundary conditions. However, this is a complicated task and may require numerical methods.\n\nAs for the concentration profile $u(x, y, t)$, it will change over time due to the diffusion and reaction terms. The diffusion will cause the concentration to spread out from the initial circular patch, while the reaction term will cause the concentration to increase or decrease depending on the values of $a$ and $b$. The exponential term $e^{-k^2t}$ in the solution indicates that the concentration will decay over time, with the rate of decay depending on the value of $k^2$."
