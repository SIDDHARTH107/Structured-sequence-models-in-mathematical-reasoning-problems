If the energy of the particle is given by E = 2 eV and the mass of the particle is m = 9.11 x 10^-31 kg, determine the wave function of the particle using Schrödinger's equation.",
    "message_2": "To determine the wave function of the particle, we need to solve the time-independent Schrödinger's equation for the given potential well:\n\n(-ħ²/2m) * (d²ψ(x)/dx²) + V(x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = 1.054 x 10^-34 Js), m is the mass of the particle, and ψ(x) is the wave function we want to find.\n\nSince V(x) = 0 for 0 < x < a, the equation simplifies to:\n\n(-ħ²/2m) * (d²ψ(x)/dx²) = Eψ(x)\n\nNow, let's rearrange the equation:\n\n(d²ψ(x)/dx²) = -(2mE/ħ²)ψ(x)\n\nLet k² = 2mE/ħ². Then, the equation becomes:\n\n(d²ψ(x)/dx²) = -k²ψ(x)\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution is given by:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nSince the potential is infinite at x = 0 and x = a, the wave function must be zero at these points (ψ(0) = ψ(a) = 0) to satisfy the boundary conditions.\n\nAt x = 0, ψ(0) = A * sin(0) + B * cos(0) = B. Since ψ(0) = 0, we have B = 0. So, the wave function simplifies to:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx)\n\nAt x = a, ψ(a) = A * sin(ka) = 0. Since A ≠ 0 (otherwise, the wave function would be trivial), we must have sin(ka) = 0. This implies that ka = nπ, where n is an integer. Thus, k = nπ/a.\n\nNow, let's find the energy E:\n\nE = ħ²k²/2m = ħ²(nπ/a)²/2m\n\nGiven E = 2 eV = 2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 J, we can solve for n:\n\n2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 J = (1.054 x 10^-34 Js)² * (nπ/a)² / (2 * 9.11 x 10^-31 kg)\n\nSolving for n, we get n = 1 (taking the lowest energy state, i.e., the ground state).\n\nNow, we need to normalize the wave function:\n\n1 = ∫|ψ(x)|² dx from 0 to a = ∫(A * sin(πx/a))² dx from 0 to a\n\n1 = A² * ∫(sin²(πx/a)) dx from 0 to a = A² * (a/2)\n\nA = sqrt(2/a)\n\nFinally, the normalized wave function of the particle is:\n\nψ(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(πx/a)"
