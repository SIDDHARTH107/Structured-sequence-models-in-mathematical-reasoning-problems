    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. In this case, A Δ B = {1, 3} since 1 is in A but not in B, and 3 is in B but not in A.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A Δ B) and {4}. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set. So, (A Δ B) × {4} = {(1, 4), (3, 4)}.\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B Δ A. Since the symmetric difference is commutative, B Δ A = A Δ B = {1, 3}.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of {4} and (B Δ A). So, {4} × (B Δ A) = {(4, 1), (4, 3)}.\n\nComparing the two results, we have (A Δ B) × {4} = {(1, 4), (3, 4)} and {4} × (B Δ A) = {(4, 1), (4, 3)}. These two sets are not equal, as the ordered pairs have different components. This shows that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product."
