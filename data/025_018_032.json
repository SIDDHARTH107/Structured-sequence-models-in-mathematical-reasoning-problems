    "message_2": "To show that C^2 ≥ 2, we will use the Hodge Index Theorem. The Hodge Index Theorem states that for any two divisors D and E on a smooth projective surface X, we have:\n\n(D.E)^2 ≤ (D^2)(E^2)\n\nwith equality if and only if D and E are proportional.\n\nIn our case, we have D = L and E = C. We are given that L^2 = 6 and L.C = 3. We want to show that C^2 ≥ 2. Applying the Hodge Index Theorem, we get:\n\n(L.C)^2 ≤ (L^2)(C^2)\n\n(3)^2 ≤ (6)(C^2)\n\n9 ≤ 6C^2\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 6:\n\n3/2 ≤ C^2\n\nSince C^2 is an integer (as it represents the self-intersection number of the curve C), the smallest integer value that satisfies this inequality is 2. Therefore, we have:\n\nC^2 ≥ 2"
