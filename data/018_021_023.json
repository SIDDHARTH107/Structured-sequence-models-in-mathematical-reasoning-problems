    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nA - B = {1}\nB - A = {5}\nA ∆ B = {1} ∪ {5} = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, we need to check if the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the intersection of A and B. The distributive property states that:\n\nA ∆ (B ∩ C) = (A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∆ C)\n\nLet's check if this holds true for our sets:\n\nA ∆ (B ∩ A) = A ∆ A = {} (since the symmetric difference of a set with itself is the empty set)\n\nNow, let's find (A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∆ A):\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∆ A) = ({1, 5}) ∩ {} = {}\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the intersection of A and B."
