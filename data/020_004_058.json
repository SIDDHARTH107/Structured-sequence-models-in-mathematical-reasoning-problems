    "message_1": "A steel company wants to produce two types of steel bars - Type A and Type B. The cost per ton of producing Type A steel is $1500 and for Type B steel is $2500. There are three raw materials required for the production - Raw Material 1, Raw Material 2, and Raw Material 3. The cost of raw material 1 per ton is $800, for Raw Material 2 is $1200, and for Raw material 3 is $2000.\n\nType A steel requires 2 tons of Raw Material 1, 3 tons of Raw Material 2, and 1 ton of Raw Material 3 per ton of steel produced. Type B steel requires 1 ton of Raw Material 1, 4 tons of Raw Material 2, and 3 tons of Raw Material 3 per ton of steel produced.\n\nIf the company has a budget of $500,000, what is the optimal combination of Type A and Type B steel the company should produce to maximize the profit, assuming the selling price for Type A steel and Type B steel is $3500 and $4500 per ton, respectively?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of tons of Type A steel produced and y be the number of tons of Type B steel produced.\n\nThe cost of producing Type A steel, including the raw materials, is:\nCost_A = 1500 + 2 * 800 + 3 * 1200 + 1 * 2000 = 1500 + 1600 + 3600 + 2000 = $8700 per ton\n\nThe cost of producing Type B steel, including the raw materials, is:\nCost_B = 2500 + 1 * 800 + 4 * 1200 + 3 * 2000 = 2500 + 800 + 4800 + 6000 = $14,100 per ton\n\nThe profit per ton of Type A steel is:\nProfit_A = Selling Price_A - Cost_A = 3500 - 8700 = -$5200 per ton\n\nThe profit per ton of Type B steel is:\nProfit_B = Selling Price_B - Cost_B = 4500 - 14100 = -$9600 per ton\n\nSince both types of steel have a negative profit per ton, the company should not produce any steel to maximize profit. The optimal combination is to produce 0 tons of Type A steel and 0 tons of Type B steel."
