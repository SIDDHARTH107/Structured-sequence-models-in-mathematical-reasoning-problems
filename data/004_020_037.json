    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force using integration, we can use the following formula:\n\nWork = ∫(F * dx) from x = 0 to x = 5\n\nwhere F is the force (10 N) and dx is the infinitesimal displacement.\n\nSince the force is constant, the integral becomes:\n\nWork = ∫(10 * dx) from x = 0 to x = 5\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to x:\n\nWork = 10 * ∫(dx) from x = 0 to x = 5\n\nWork = 10 * [x] from x = 0 to x = 5\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nWork = 10 * (5 - 0)\n\nWork = 10 * 5\n\nWork = 50 J\n\nSo, the work done by the force is 50 Joules."
