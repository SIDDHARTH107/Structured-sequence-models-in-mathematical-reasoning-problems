    "message_1": "Suppose you have a set of 100 statements about math, labeled 1 to 100. You know that statement 75 is true and statement 36 is false. Using Relevance logic, how many of the remaining statements can still be considered true or false without causing a contradiction in the system?",
    "message_2": "Relevance logic is a non-classical logic system that aims to avoid irrelevant implications, meaning that the premises of an argument must be relevant to the conclusion. However, without knowing the content of the 100 statements and their relationships to each other, it is impossible to determine how many of the remaining statements can be considered true or false without causing a contradiction in the system.\n\nIn relevance logic, the truth or falsity of a statement depends on its connection to other statements. Since we only know the truth value of statements 75 and 36, we cannot determine the truth values of the other statements without more information about their relationships to each other and to the known true and false statements."
