    "message_1": "A surface S is defined by the equation z = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy for all real values of x and y. What is the Gaussian curvature of surface S at the point (1, 1, -1)?",
    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface S at the point (1, 1, -1), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. The first fundamental form is given by the metric tensor, and the second fundamental form is given by the shape operator.\n\n1. First, we find the partial derivatives of z with respect to x and y:\n\n∂z/∂x = 3x^2 - 3y\n∂z/∂y = 3y^2 - 3x\n\n2. Next, we find the tangent vectors at the point (1, 1, -1):\n\nT_x = (1, 0, ∂z/∂x) = (1, 0, 0)\nT_y = (0, 1, ∂z/∂y) = (0, 1, 0)\n\n3. Now, we find the second partial derivatives of z:\n\n∂²z/∂x² = 6x\n∂²z/∂y² = 6y\n∂²z/∂x∂y = -3\n\n4. We find the normal vector N to the surface at the point (1, 1, -1):\n\nN = T_x × T_y = (0, 0, 1)\n\n5. We find the components of the shape operator:\n\nL = -N • (∂²z/∂x²) = -1(-6) = 6\nM = -N • (∂²z/∂x∂y) = -1(-3) = 3\nN = -N • (∂²z/∂y²) = -1(-6) = 6\n\n6. Finally, we find the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (LN - M²) / (EG - F²)\n\nIn this case, E = T_x • T_x = 1, F = T_x • T_y = 0, and G = T_y • T_y = 1. Therefore:\n\nK = (6 * 6 - 3 * 3) / (1 * 1 - 0 * 0) = (36 - 9) / 1 = 27\n\nThe Gaussian curvature of the surface S at the point (1, 1, -1) is 27."
