    "message_1": "A lighthouse is situated at point A on a cliff that is 120 meters above sea level. From the lighthouse, a boat is observed to be 500 meters from the base of the cliff. What is the distance between the boat and the top of the cliff? (Assume the boat is in level with the base of the cliff.)",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the boat and the top of the cliff, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. Let's denote the distance between the boat and the top of the cliff as C, the height of the cliff as A (120 meters), and the distance between the boat and the base of the cliff as B (500 meters).\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, A^2 + B^2 = C^2.\n\nWe have A = 120 meters and B = 500 meters. So,\n\n(120)^2 + (500)^2 = C^2\n14400 + 250000 = C^2\n264400 = C^2\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 264400 to get the value of C:\n\nC = √264400\nC ≈ 514.23 meters\n\nSo, the distance between the boat and the top of the cliff is approximately 514.23 meters."
