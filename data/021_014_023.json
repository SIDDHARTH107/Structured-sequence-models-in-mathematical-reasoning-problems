    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot run code or execute algorithms in real-time. However, I can provide you with a general outline of how to approach this problem using genetic algorithms.\n\n1. Initialization: Create an initial population of candidate solutions. Each solution is a vector of three variables (x1, x2, x3) that satisfy the constraints. For example, you can randomly generate values for x1, x2, and x3 such that 0 ≤ xi ≤ 1 and x1 + x2 + x3 = 1.\n\n2. Fitness Evaluation: Calculate the fitness of each solution in the population by evaluating the objective function f(x) = x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2.\n\n3. Selection: Select a subset of the population based on their fitness values. You can use methods like tournament selection, roulette wheel selection, or rank-based selection.\n\n4. Crossover: Perform crossover (recombination) on the selected solutions to create new offspring. For example, you can use one-point crossover, where a random crossover point is chosen, and the variables before the point are swapped between two parent solutions.\n\n5. Mutation: Apply mutation to the offspring by randomly changing the values of one or more variables (x1, x2, x3) within the given constraints. This helps to maintain diversity in the population and avoid premature convergence.\n\n6. Replacement: Replace the least fit individuals in the population with the new offspring.\n\n7. Termination: Repeat steps 2-6 until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of generations or a satisfactory fitness level.\n\n8. Solution: The best solution found during the algorithm's execution will be the one with the highest fitness value. This solution will provide the maximum value of f(x) and the corresponding values of x1, x2, and x3.\n\nRemember that genetic algorithms are heuristic methods, and the quality of the solution may depend on the choice of parameters and operators. You may need to experiment with different settings to achieve the best results."
