    "message_2": "To find the number of rational points on the elliptic curve E over the finite field Z/11Z, we will use the following equation:\n\ny^2 = x^3 - 5x + 7 (mod 11)\n\nWe will iterate through all possible values of x and y in the field Z/11Z, which are {0, 1, 2, ..., 10}, and check if the equation holds true. If it does, we count it as a rational point.\n\nLet's start with x = 0:\n\ny^2 = 0^3 - 5*0 + 7 (mod 11)\ny^2 = 7 (mod 11)\n\nThe possible values of y^2 (mod 11) are {0, 1, 4, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 4, 1}. Since 7 is not in this set, there are no points with x = 0.\n\nNow, let's check the other values of x:\n\nx = 1: y^2 = 1^3 - 5*1 + 7 (mod 11) = 3 (mod 11) => y = {5, 6}\nx = 2: y^2 = 2^3 - 5*2 + 7 (mod 11) = 1 (mod 11) => y = {1, 10}\nx = 3: y^2 = 3^3 - 5*3 + 7 (mod 11) = 9 (mod 11) => y = {3, 8}\nx = 4: y^2 = 4^3 - 5*4 + 7 (mod 11) = 0 (mod 11) => y = {0}\nx = 5: y^2 = 5^3 - 5*5 + 7 (mod 11) = 5 (mod 11) => y = {4, 7}\nx = 6: y^2 = 6^3 - 5*6 + 7 (mod 11) = 5 (mod 11) => y = {4, 7}\nx = 7: y^2 = 7^3 - 5*7 + 7 (mod 11) = 0 (mod 11) => y = {0}\nx = 8: y^2 = 8^3 - 5*8 + 7 (mod 11) = 9 (mod 11) => y = {3, 8}\nx = 9: y^2 = 9^3 - 5*9 + 7 (mod 11) = 1 (mod 11) => y = {1, 10}\nx = 10: y^2 = 10^3 - 5*10 + 7 (mod 11) = 3 (mod 11) => y = {5, 6}\n\nNow, let's count the number of rational points:\n\nx = 1: 2 points\nx = 2: 2 points\nx = 3: 2 points\nx = 4: 1 point\nx = 5: 2 points\nx = 6: 2 points\nx = 7: 1 point\nx = 8: 2 points\nx = 9: 2 points\nx = 10: 2 points\n\nTotal number of rational points: 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18.\n\nSo, there are 18 rational points on the elliptic curve E over the finite field Z/11Z."
