    "message_2": "To find all possible isomorphic groups of order 32, we will use the Sylow theorems and the fact that 32 = 2^5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in a group of order 32 must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility for the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is 1, which means that there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, and it is normal.\n\nLet G be a group of order 32. Since G has a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup, G must be a 2-group. We will now use the fact that every finite p-group is a direct product of its subgroups of smaller orders. In particular, G is a direct product of its subgroups of orders 2, 4, 8, and 16.\n\nNow, we will classify all groups of order 32 based on their structure. We will use the fact that every group of order 2^k is either cyclic or a direct product of smaller groups of order 2^k.\n\n1. Cyclic group C32: This is the simplest case, where G is a cyclic group of order 32.\n\n2. Dihedral group D16: This is the group of symmetries of a regular 16-gon. It has order 32 and is non-abelian.\n\n3-8. Six non-abelian groups of order 32: These groups can be constructed as direct products of smaller groups of order 2^k. We will list them as follows:\n\n   a. G = C2 × C2 × C2 × C2 × C2\n   b. G = C4 × C2 × C2 × C2\n   c. G = C8 × C2 × C2\n   d. G = C16 × C2\n   e. G = C4 × C4 × C2\n   f. G = C8 × C4\n\nEach of these groups is non-abelian and has order 32.\n\nNow, we will prove that these groups are isomorphic to either C32, D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\n1. C32: This group is isomorphic to itself.\n\n2. D16: This group is isomorphic to itself.\n\n3-8. Six non-abelian groups of order 32: Each of these groups is isomorphic to itself, as they are all distinct in their structure.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found all possible isomorphic groups of order 32, and we have shown that they are isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32."
