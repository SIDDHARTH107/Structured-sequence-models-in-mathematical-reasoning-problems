    "message_2": "A topological space is called a T1 space if, for every pair of distinct points x and y in the space, there exists an open set containing x but not y, and an open set containing y but not x.\n\nIn a metric space, the open balls centered at a point x with radius r > 0, defined as B(x, r) = {y ∈ X | d(x, y) < r}, form a basis for the topology. \n\nLet x and y be two distinct points in the metric space X with the given metric d(x, y). Since x ≠ y, we have d(x, y) = 1. Now, consider the open balls B(x, 1/2) and B(y, 1/2). \n\nFor any point z ∈ B(x, 1/2), we have d(x, z) < 1/2. Since d(x, y) = 1, it is clear that y ∉ B(x, 1/2). Similarly, for any point z ∈ B(y, 1/2), we have d(y, z) < 1/2, and thus x ∉ B(y, 1/2).\n\nTherefore, for any pair of distinct points x and y in the metric space X, we have found open sets B(x, 1/2) and B(y, 1/2) such that x ∈ B(x, 1/2) and y ∉ B(x, 1/2), and y ∈ B(y, 1/2) and x ∉ B(y, 1/2). This shows that the metric space X is a T1 space."
