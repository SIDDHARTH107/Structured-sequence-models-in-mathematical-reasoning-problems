    "message_1": "What is the correlation coefficient between the number of hours spent studying and the final exam score, if the data shows that out of 30 students, those who studied for less than 5 hours got an average score of 60 and those who studied for 5 or more hours got an average score of 80?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient, we need more specific data, such as the exact number of hours each student studied and their corresponding exam scores. The information provided only gives us the average scores for two groups of students, which is not enough to calculate the correlation coefficient.\n\nThe correlation coefficient, denoted as \"r,\" is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, with -1 indicating a strong negative relationship, 1 indicating a strong positive relationship, and 0 indicating no relationship.\n\nIf you can provide the individual data points for each student's study hours and exam scores, we can calculate the correlation coefficient."
