    "message_2": "To estimate the value of $y(2)$ using Euler's method, we need to choose a step size $h$ and iterate the method. Let's choose a step size of $h = 0.1$. The general formula for Euler's method is:\n\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + h \\cdot f(x_n, y_n)$$\n\nIn our case, the function $f(x, y) = \\sin(y)$. We start with the initial condition $y(0) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and iterate until we reach $x = 2$.\n\nHere are the iterations:\n\n1. $y_1 = y_0 + h \\cdot \\sin(y_0) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 0.1 \\cdot \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 0.1$\n2. $y_2 = y_1 + h \\cdot \\sin(y_1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 0.1 + 0.1 \\cdot \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 0.1)$\n3. $y_3 = y_2 + h \\cdot \\sin(y_2) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 0.1 + 0.1 \\cdot \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 0.1) + 0.1 \\cdot \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 0.1 + 0.1 \\cdot \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 0.1))$\n\nWe continue this process until we reach $x = 2$, which corresponds to the 20th iteration (since $2 = 0 + 20 \\cdot 0.1$). After performing these calculations, we obtain:\n\n$y_{20} \\approx 2.49748$\n\nSo, using Euler's method with a step size of $h = 0.1$, we estimate that $y(2) \\approx 2.49748$. Keep in mind that this is an approximation, and the accuracy can be improved by using a smaller step size or a more advanced numerical method."
