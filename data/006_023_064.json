    "message_2": "To find the expected number of consumers who will buy the new product, we can multiply the probability of a consumer buying the product by the total number of consumers targeted.\n\nExpected number of consumers = Probability of buying × Total number of consumers\nExpected number of consumers = 0.4 × 1000\nExpected number of consumers = 400\n\nSo, the company can expect 400 consumers to buy the new product."
