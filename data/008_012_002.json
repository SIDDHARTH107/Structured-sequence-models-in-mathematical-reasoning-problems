    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 2 -1  3 |\n    | 3  1  2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  8  |\n    |  1  |\n    | 14  |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = 1(-1)(2) - 1(3)(1) + 2(2)(3) - 2(-1)(-1) - 3(1)(2) - (-1)(3)(2)\n       = -2 - 3 + 12 - 4 - 6 + 6\n       = 3\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we can find the inverse of A using the formula A^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A), where adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nadj(A) = | (-1)(2) - (3)(1)   (3)(2) - (-1)(2)   (2)(-1) - (3)(1) |\n         | (1)(2) - (2)(3)   (2)(1) - (1)(1)   (3)(1) - (1)(2) |\n         | (1)(1) - (2)(-1)   (3)(-1) - (1)(2)   (2)(1) - (1)(2) |\n\nadj(A) = | -1  8 -5 |\n         | -4  1  1 |\n         |  3 -5  0 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1) by multiplying adj(A) by (1/det(A)).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/3) * | -1  8 -5 |\n                 | -4  1  1 |\n                 |  3 -5  0 |\n\nA^(-1) = | -1/3  8/3 -5/3 |\n         | -4/3  1/3  1/3 |\n         |  1   -5/3  0  |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z by multiplying A^(-1) by B.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = | -1/3  8/3 -5/3 |  |  8  |\n    | -4/3  1/3  1/3 |  |  1  |\n    |  1   -5/3  0  |  | 14  |\n\nX = | (-1/3)(8) + (8/3)(1) + (-5/3)(14) |\n    | (-4/3)(8) + (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(14) |\n    | (1)(8) + (-5/3)(1) + (0)(14) |\n\nX = | -8/3 + 8/3 - 70/3 |\n    | -32/3 + 1/3 + 14/3 |\n    | 8 - 5/3 |\n\nX = | -10/3 |\n    | -17/3 |\n    | 19/3  |\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the system of equations are:\n\nx = -10/3\ny = -17/3\nz = 19/3"
