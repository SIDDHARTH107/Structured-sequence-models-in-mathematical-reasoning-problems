    "message_2": "Let G be a non-abelian group of order 96. Then the order of G can be written as 96 = 2^5 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (denoted by n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (denoted by n_3) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2.\n2. n_3 divides 2^5 and n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3.\n\nFrom condition 1, the possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3. However, since G is non-abelian, it cannot have a unique Sylow 2-subgroup (otherwise, it would be a normal subgroup, and G would be a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, making it abelian). Therefore, n_2 = 3.\n\nFrom condition 2, the possible values for n_3 are 1, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, and 2^5. However, the only values that are congruent to 1 mod 3 are 1 and 2^3 = 8. Since G is non-abelian, it cannot have a unique Sylow 3-subgroup for the same reason as before. Therefore, n_3 = 8.\n\nIn conclusion, there exists a non-abelian group of order 96 with exactly n = 3 Sylow 2-subgroups."
