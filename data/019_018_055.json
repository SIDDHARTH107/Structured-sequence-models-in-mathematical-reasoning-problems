    "message_2": "The statement is false.\n\nTo prove this, we can use a counterexample. Let's consider the natural number n = 3.\n\n2n = 2(3) = 6\nn^2 = 3^2 = 9\n\nIn this case, 2n (6) is not greater than n^2 (9). Therefore, the statement is false, as it does not hold true for all natural numbers n."
