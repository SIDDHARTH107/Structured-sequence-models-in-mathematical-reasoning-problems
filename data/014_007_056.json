    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that a random 8-byte sequence appears somewhere in the ciphertext, we can use the concept of complementary probability. We will first find the probability that the 8-byte sequence does not appear in the ciphertext, and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that it does appear.\n\nThere are 2^64 possible 8-byte sequences, and the ciphertext is 1,000,000 bytes long. We can think of the problem as sliding an 8-byte window across the ciphertext and checking if the sequence appears in that window. There are 1,000,000 - 8 + 1 = 999,993 possible windows.\n\nThe probability that the 8-byte sequence does not appear in a single window is:\n\n1 - (1 / 2^64)\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the 8-byte sequence does not appear in any of the 999,993 windows. Since the windows are independent, we can multiply the probabilities:\n\n(1 - (1 / 2^64))^999,993\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability, which is the probability that the 8-byte sequence does appear in the ciphertext:\n\n1 - (1 - (1 / 2^64))^999,993"
