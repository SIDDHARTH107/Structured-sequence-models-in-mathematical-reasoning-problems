    "message_2": "To determine the third Chern class c3(X) in terms of y, we can use the Chern polynomial. For a complex manifold of complex dimension n, the Chern polynomial is given by:\n\nP(t) = det(I + tC),\n\nwhere I is the identity matrix and C is the curvature matrix of the manifold. The coefficients of the polynomial P(t) are the Chern classes of the manifold.\n\nFor a complex manifold of complex dimension 3, the Chern polynomial can be written as:\n\nP(t) = 1 + c1(X)t + c2(X)t^2 + c3(X)t^3.\n\nWe are given c1(X) = 2y^2 and c2(X) = 3y^3. We can substitute these values into the Chern polynomial:\n\nP(t) = 1 + (2y^2)t + (3y^3)t^2 + c3(X)t^3.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the total Chern class of a complex manifold is the product of the Chern classes of its canonical line bundles. In our case, the total Chern class is given by:\n\nc(X) = (1 + y)^3.\n\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n\nc(X) = 1 + 3y + 3y^2 + y^3.\n\nComparing the coefficients of the total Chern class and the Chern polynomial, we can determine the value of c3(X):\n\nc3(X) = y^3.\n\nSo, the third Chern class c3(X) in terms of y is:\n\nc3(X) = y^3."
