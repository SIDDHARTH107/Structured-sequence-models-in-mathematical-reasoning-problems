    "message_2": "To find the price of the call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to calculate the following variables:\n\n1. d1\n2. d2\n3. N(d1)\n4. N(d2)\n\nThe Black-Scholes equation for a call option is given by:\n\nCall option price = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nS = current stock price = $90\nX = strike price = $80\nT = time to expiration (in years) = 0.5 (6 months)\nr = risk-free interest rate = 0.03\nσ = volatility = 0.25\ne = Euler's number (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nd1 = (ln(90/80) + (0.03 + (0.25^2)/2) * 0.5) / (0.25 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 ≈ 0.6697\n\nd2 = 0.6697 - 0.25 * sqrt(0.5)\nd2 ≈ 0.4197\n\nNow, we need to find N(d1) and N(d2), which are the cumulative distribution function values for d1 and d2. Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator:\n\nN(d1) ≈ 0.7486\nN(d2) ≈ 0.6623\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Black-Scholes equation:\n\nCall option price = 90 * 0.7486 - 80 * e^(-0.03 * 0.5) * 0.6623\nCall option price ≈ 90 * 0.7486 - 80 * 0.9851 * 0.6623\nCall option price ≈ 67.374 - 52.343\nCall option price ≈ $15.031\n\nSo, the price of the call option using the Black-Scholes equation is approximately $15.03."
