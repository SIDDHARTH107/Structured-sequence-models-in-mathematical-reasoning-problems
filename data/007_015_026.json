    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. The first few Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, and so on. To find the ninth Mersenne prime, we need to find the ninth prime number n such that 2^n - 1 is also prime.\n\nThe first eight prime numbers for which 2^n - 1 is prime are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, and 31. The ninth such prime number is 61.\n\nTherefore, the ninth Mersenne prime is M_61 = 2^61 - 1 = 2,305,843,009,213,693,951."
