Use D = 0.001 cm^2/min and k = 0.01 min^-1.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state solution, we set ∂u/∂t = 0:\n\n0 = D∂^2u/∂x^2 - k u + u^2\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\nD∂^2u/∂x^2 = k u - u^2\n\nNow, we need to solve this nonlinear ordinary differential equation with the Neumann boundary conditions:\n\n∂u/∂x = 0 at x = 0 and x = L\n\nLet's first find the equilibrium points by setting the right-hand side of the equation to zero:\n\nk u - u^2 = 0\n\nu(k - u) = 0\n\nThe equilibrium points are u = 0 and u = k. Since the initial condition is u(x,0) = 1, we can assume that the steady-state solution is u = k.\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for the solution to reach 90% of the steady-state value. Let's denote the time as t_90. We have:\n\nu(x, t_90) = 0.9 * k\n\nWe can use the separation of variables method to solve the original partial differential equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = D∂^2u/∂x^2 - k u + u^2\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n(1/u^2 - 1/k) du = (D/k) ∂^2u/∂x^2 dt\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/u^2 - 1/k) du = ∫(D/k) ∂^2u/∂x^2 dt\n\n(1/k) ln|u^2 - k| = (D/k) ∂^2u/∂x^2 t + C\n\nNow, apply the initial condition u(x,0) = 1:\n\n(1/k) ln|1 - k| = C\n\nPlug C back into the equation:\n\n(1/k) ln|u^2 - k| = (D/k) ∂^2u/∂x^2 t + (1/k) ln|1 - k|\n\nNow, apply the condition u(x, t_90) = 0.9 * k:\n\n(1/k) ln|0.81k^2 - k| = (D/k) ∂^2u/∂x^2 t_90 + (1/k) ln|1 - k|\n\nSolve for t_90:\n\nt_90 = (k/D) * (∂^2u/∂x^2) * (ln|0.81k^2 - k| - ln|1 - k|)\n\nPlug in the given values for D and k:\n\nt_90 = (0.01/0.001) * (∂^2u/∂x^2) * (ln|0.81*(0.01)^2 - 0.01| - ln|1 - 0.01|)\n\nt_90 ≈ 10 * (∂^2u/∂x^2) * (ln|0.000809| - ln|0.99|)\n\nThe exact value of t_90 depends on the second derivative of u with respect to x, which is not given in the problem. However, this equation provides an estimate of the time it takes for the solution to reach 90% of the steady-state value."
