    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example problem for a math student to solve:\n\nLet S be a square with vertices at 1+2i, -1+2i, -1-2i, and 1-2i. Find a biholomorphic (i.e. conformal and bijective) map from the interior of S to the unit disk U = {z : |z| < 1}.",
    "message_2": "To find a biholomorphic map from the interior of the square S to the unit disk U, we can compose a series of simpler maps. Let's break down the problem into three steps:\n\n1. Map the square S to a rectangle with vertices at 1+i, -1+i, -1-i, and 1-i.\n2. Map the rectangle to the upper half-plane.\n3. Map the upper half-plane to the unit disk U.\n\nStep 1: Map the square S to a rectangle.\nWe can achieve this by applying a dilation in the imaginary direction. Define the map f(z) = z/2. Then, the vertices of the square S are mapped to the vertices of the rectangle:\n\nf(1+2i) = 1/2 + i\nf(-1+2i) = -1/2 + i\nf(-1-2i) = -1/2 - i\nf(1-2i) = 1/2 - i\n\nStep 2: Map the rectangle to the upper half-plane.\nWe can use the exponential function to map the rectangle to the upper half-plane. Define the map g(z) = e^(πiz). Then, the vertices of the rectangle are mapped to the upper half-plane:\n\ng(1/2 + i) = e^(πi(1/2 + i)) = e^(πi/2) * e^(-π) = i * e^(-π)\ng(-1/2 + i) = e^(πi(-1/2 + i)) = e^(-πi/2) * e^(-π) = -i * e^(-π)\ng(-1/2 - i) = e^(πi(-1/2 - i)) = e^(-πi/2) * e^(π) = -i * e^(π)\ng(1/2 - i) = e^(πi(1/2 - i)) = e^(πi/2) * e^(π) = i * e^(π)\n\nStep 3: Map the upper half-plane to the unit disk U.\nWe can use the Möbius transformation to map the upper half-plane to the unit disk. Define the map h(z) = (z - i)/(z + i). Then, the upper half-plane is mapped to the unit disk U.\n\nNow, we can compose the maps f, g, and h to obtain a biholomorphic map from the interior of the square S to the unit disk U:\n\nF(z) = h(g(f(z))) = h(g(z/2)) = h(e^(πiz/2))\n\nSo, the biholomorphic map F(z) = (e^(πiz/2) - i)/(e^(πiz/2) + i) maps the interior of the square S to the unit disk U."
