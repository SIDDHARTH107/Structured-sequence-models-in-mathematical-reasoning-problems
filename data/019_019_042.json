Find the smallest number in S that is not the sum of cubes of three smaller natural numbers.",
    "message_2": "To find the smallest number in S that is not the sum of cubes of three smaller natural numbers, we can start by listing the smallest possible sums of cubes and look for the smallest number that cannot be formed by these sums.\n\nWe know that 1³ = 1, 2³ = 8, 3³ = 27, 4³ = 64, and so on. Let's start by listing the sums of cubes of three smaller natural numbers:\n\n1³ + 1³ + 1³ = 3\n1³ + 1³ + 2³ = 10\n1³ + 1³ + 3³ = 29\n1³ + 2³ + 2³ = 17\n1³ + 2³ + 3³ = 36\n1³ + 3³ + 3³ = 55\n2³ + 2³ + 2³ = 24\n2³ + 2³ + 3³ = 43\n2³ + 3³ + 3³ = 62\n3³ + 3³ + 3³ = 81\n\nNow, let's look for the smallest number that cannot be formed by these sums. We can see that the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, and 62 can all be formed by the sums listed above.\n\nHowever, the number 63 cannot be formed by any of the sums listed above. Therefore, the smallest number in S that is not the sum of cubes of three smaller natural numbers is 63."
