    "message_2": "To construct a Morse-Smale complex for $f$, we first need to analyze the critical points and their indices. Since the Hessian matrix of $f$ has distinct eigenvalues at both critical points, we know that these critical points are non-degenerate. Let's compute the indices of the critical points.\n\nAt $(0,0)$, let the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix be $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ with $\\lambda_1 < \\lambda_2$. Since $(0,0)$ is a critical point, we have $\\nabla f(0,0) = 0$. Since the eigenvalues are distinct and non-zero, we know that the Hessian matrix is non-singular, and thus $(0,0)$ is a non-degenerate critical point. The index of $(0,0)$ is the number of negative eigenvalues, which is 1 in this case.\n\nSimilarly, at $(2,2)$, let the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix be $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ with $\\mu_1 < \\mu_2$. Since $(2,2)$ is a critical point, we have $\\nabla f(2,2) = 0$. The Hessian matrix is non-singular, and thus $(2,2)$ is a non-degenerate critical point. The index of $(2,2)$ is the number of negative eigenvalues, which is 0 in this case.\n\nNow we can construct the Morse-Smale complex. The Morse-Smale complex is a cell complex built from the critical points of $f$ and their indices. In this case, we have two critical points with indices 0 and 1. The 0-dimensional cell is generated by the critical point $(2,2)$, and the 1-dimensional cell is generated by the critical point $(0,0)$. The Morse-Smale complex is a 1-dimensional complex with one 0-cell and one 1-cell.\n\nTo compute the homology groups of the Morse-Smale complex, we can use the cellular homology approach. The cellular chain complex is given by:\n\n$C_0 \\xrightarrow{\\partial_1} C_1 \\xrightarrow{\\partial_2} C_2 \\rightarrow \\cdots$\n\nwhere $C_i$ is the free abelian group generated by the $i$-dimensional cells, and $\\partial_i$ is the boundary map. In this case, we have:\n\n$C_0 \\xrightarrow{\\partial_1} C_1$\n\nwhere $C_0 = \\mathbb{Z}$ is generated by the 0-cell, and $C_1 = \\mathbb{Z}$ is generated by the 1-cell. The boundary map $\\partial_1$ is trivial since the 1-cell has no boundary, so $\\partial_1 = 0$.\n\nThe homology groups are given by:\n\n$H_i = \\ker(\\partial_i) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_{i+1})$\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n$H_0 = \\ker(\\partial_1) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_2) = \\mathbb{Z} / 0 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n$H_1 = \\ker(\\partial_2) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_1) = 0 / 0 = 0$\n\nSo the homology groups of the Morse-Smale complex for $f$ are:\n\n$H_0 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n$H_1 = 0$\n\nand all other homology groups are trivial."
