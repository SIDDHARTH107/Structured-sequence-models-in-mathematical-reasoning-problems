    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. In each iteration, the perimeter of the Koch curve increases by a factor of 4/3.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the perimeter is multiplied by 4/3:\nP1 = 3 * (4/3) = 4\n\nAfter the second iteration, the perimeter is multiplied by 4/3 again:\nP2 = 4 * (4/3) = 16/3\n\nAfter the third iteration, the perimeter is multiplied by 4/3 once more:\nP3 = (16/3) * (4/3) = 64/9\n\nFinally, after the fourth iteration, the perimeter is multiplied by 4/3 for the last time:\nP4 = (64/9) * (4/3) = 256/27\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch island after the 4th iteration is 256/27."
