    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we will perform a series of operations on the augmented matrix to transform it into an upper triangular matrix, and then solve for the variables using back-substitution.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n| 2  3  4 | 20 |\n| 4  5  6 | 34 |\n| 6  7  8 | 48 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nDivide the first row by 2:\n\n| 1  1.5  2 | 10 |\n| 4  5    6 | 34 |\n| 6  7    8 | 48 |\n\nSubtract 4 times the first row from the second row:\n\n| 1  1.5  2 | 10 |\n| 0 -1 -2 | -6 |\n| 6  7    8 | 48 |\n\nSubtract 6 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  1.5  2 | 10 |\n| 0 -1 -2 | -6 |\n| 0  1    0 | -12 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nAdd the second row to the third row:\n\n| 1  1.5  2 | 10 |\n| 0 -1 -2 | -6 |\n| 0  0    -2 | -18 |\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nDivide the third row by -2:\n\n| 1  1.5  2 | 10 |\n| 0 -1 -2 | -6 |\n| 0  0    1 | 9 |\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nz = 9\n\ny - 2z = -6\ny - 2(9) = -6\ny = 12\n\nx + 1.5y + 2z = 10\nx + 1.5(12) + 2(9) = 10\nx = -11\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -11, y = 12, and z = 9."
