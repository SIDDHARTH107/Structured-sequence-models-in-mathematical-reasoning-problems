    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = -x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 3 using the ant colony optimization algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialization: Set up the search space, pheromone values, and parameters.\n2. Ant movement: Move ants through the search space based on pheromone values and heuristic information.\n3. Pheromone update: Update pheromone values based on the quality of the solutions found.\n4. Termination: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nStep 1: Initialization\n- Search space: -10 ≤ x ≤ 10 with a step size of 0.001, resulting in 20,001 possible x values.\n- Pheromone values: Initialize pheromone values (tau) for each x value to a small positive value, e.g., 0.1.\n- Parameters: Number of ants = 20, evaporation rate (rho) = 0.5.\n\nStep 2: Ant movement\n- For each ant, choose an initial x value based on the pheromone values (higher pheromone values have a higher probability of being chosen).\n- Calculate the function value f(x) for the chosen x value.\n- Move the ant to a neighboring x value (either left or right) based on the pheromone values and heuristic information (e.g., the difference in function values).\n- Repeat this process for a predefined number of steps or until the ant reaches the boundary of the search space.\n\nStep 3: Pheromone update\n- For each x value, update the pheromone value based on the quality of the solutions found by the ants that visited it.\n- Pheromone evaporation: tau(x) = (1 - rho) * tau(x).\n- Pheromone deposition: For each ant, deposit pheromone on the x values it visited proportional to the quality of the solution found (e.g., 1 / f(x)).\n- Update the pheromone values: tau(x) = tau(x) + deposited pheromone.\n\nStep 4: Termination\n- Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a predefined number of iterations or until the pheromone values converge.\n- The minimum value of the function is the lowest f(x) found by the ants during the search process.\n\nNote that the ant colony optimization algorithm is a heuristic method, and the solution found may not be the exact global minimum. However, it can provide a good approximation of the minimum value for complex optimization problems."
