    "message_2": "To compute the De Rham cohomology groups $H^k_{DR}(M)$ for $k=0,1,\\dots, n$, we first need to understand the De Rham complex of differential forms on $M$. The De Rham complex is given by the sequence of spaces of differential forms and their exterior derivatives:\n\n$$0 \\rightarrow \\Omega^0(M) \\xrightarrow{d} \\Omega^1(M) \\xrightarrow{d} \\cdots \\xrightarrow{d} \\Omega^n(M) \\rightarrow 0$$\n\nHere, $\\Omega^k(M)$ denotes the space of smooth $k$-forms on $M$, and $d$ is the exterior derivative, which takes a $k$-form to a $(k+1)$-form.\n\nThe De Rham cohomology groups $H^k_{DR}(M)$ are defined as the quotient of the space of closed $k$-forms (i.e., those whose exterior derivative is zero) by the space of exact $k$-forms (i.e., those that are the exterior derivative of a $(k-1)$-form). In other words:\n\n$$H^k_{DR}(M) = \\frac{\\ker(d: \\Omega^k(M) \\rightarrow \\Omega^{k+1}(M))}{\\operatorname{im}(d: \\Omega^{k-1}(M) \\rightarrow \\Omega^k(M))}$$\n\nNow, let's compute the De Rham cohomology groups for each $k$:\n\n1. For $k=0$, we have:\n\n$$H^0_{DR}(M) = \\frac{\\ker(d: \\Omega^0(M) \\rightarrow \\Omega^1(M))}{\\operatorname{im}(d: \\Omega^{-1}(M) \\rightarrow \\Omega^0(M))}$$\n\nSince there are no $(-1)$-forms, the denominator is trivial. The kernel of $d: \\Omega^0(M) \\rightarrow \\Omega^1(M)$ consists of constant functions, as their exterior derivative is zero. Therefore, $H^0_{DR}(M)$ is isomorphic to the space of constant functions on $M$. Since $M$ is connected, this space is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2. For $k=n$, we have:\n\n$$H^n_{DR}(M) = \\frac{\\ker(d: \\Omega^n(M) \\rightarrow \\Omega^{n+1}(M))}{\\operatorname{im}(d: \\Omega^{n-1}(M) \\rightarrow \\Omega^n(M))}$$\n\nSince there are no $(n+1)$-forms, the kernel is trivial. Therefore, $H^n_{DR}(M)$ is isomorphic to the space of closed $n$-forms modulo exact $n$-forms. By the Poincaré lemma, every closed $n$-form is locally exact. However, since $M$ is compact, a global argument is needed. By the Stokes' theorem, the integral of an exact $n$-form over $M$ is zero. If the integral of a closed $n$-form is nonzero, it cannot be exact. Therefore, $H^n_{DR}(M)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ if $M$ has a nonzero volume form, and is trivial otherwise.\n\n3. For $1 \\leq k \\leq n-1$, the De Rham cohomology groups $H^k_{DR}(M)$ depend on the topology of $M$. In general, they can be computed using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, the Künneth formula, or other algebraic topology tools."
