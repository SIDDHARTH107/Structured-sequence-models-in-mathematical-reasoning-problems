    "message_2": "To form a 9-digit number without using the digit 9, we have 8 choices for each digit (0-8). However, we have the constraint that the middle 5 digits cannot contain the digit 0. Let's break down the problem into parts:\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of ways to choose the middle 5 digits without the digit 0. We have 7 choices for each of these digits (1-8), so there are 7^5 ways to choose the middle 5 digits.\n\n2. Now, we need to find the number of ways to choose the first and last 2 digits. Since the first digit cannot be 0 (as it would not be a 9-digit number), we have 7 choices for the first digit (1-8). For the second digit, we have all 8 choices (0-8). Similarly, for the last 2 digits, we have 8 choices each.\n\nSo, the total number of 9-digit numbers that can be formed with these constraints is:\n\n(7 choices for the first digit) * (8 choices for the second digit) * (7^5 choices for the middle 5 digits) * (8 choices for the eighth digit) * (8 choices for the ninth digit)\n\n7 * 8 * 7^5 * 8 * 8 = 7 * 8^4 * 7^5\n\nTherefore, there are 7 * 8^4 * 7^5 = 2,097,152 9-digit numbers that can be formed with the given constraints."
