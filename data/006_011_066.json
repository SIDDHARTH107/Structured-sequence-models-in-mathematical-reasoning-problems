    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one accident occurring, we can first find the probability of no accidents occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no accidents occurring in a day is 1 - 0.12 = 0.88.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least one accident occurring, which is the complement of no accidents occurring. So, the probability of at least one accident occurring is:\n\n1 - (probability of no accidents) = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12.\n\nTherefore, the probability of having at least one accident in a workplace in a day is 0.12 or 12%."
