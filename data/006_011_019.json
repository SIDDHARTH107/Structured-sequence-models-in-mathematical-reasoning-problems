    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (accidents) in n trials (days)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (accident) on a single trial (day)\n- n is the number of trials (days)\n- k is the number of successes (accidents)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 100 days\n- k = 10 accidents\n- p = 0.15 (probability of an accident occurring on a single day)\n\nFirst, let's calculate nCk:\n\nnCk = 100! / (10!(100-10)!)\nnCk = 100! / (10!90!)\nnCk ≈ 17,310,309.84 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nNow, let's calculate p^k and (1-p)^(n-k):\n\np^k = (0.15)^10 ≈ 0.0000000573 (rounded to 10 decimal places)\n(1-p)^(n-k) = (1-0.15)^(100-10) = (0.85)^90 ≈ 0.0000022936 (rounded to 10 decimal places)\n\nFinally, let's plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 10) = nCk * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\nP(X = 10) ≈ 17,310,309.84 * 0.0000000573 * 0.0000022936\nP(X = 10) ≈ 0.0226 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nSo, the probability that the accident will occur exactly 10 times in 100 days is approximately 0.0226 or 2.26%."
