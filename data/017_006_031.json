    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 35. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. A cyclic group of order 35, denoted as Z_35.\n2. A direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, denoted as Z_5 × Z_7.\n\nWe will show that if G is not cyclic, then it must be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nFirst, note that the order of G is 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers. By Sylow's Theorems, we know that G has a Sylow 5-subgroup and a Sylow 7-subgroup. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 7-subgroup of G. Then, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7.\n\nNow, by Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted as n_5, divides |G|/5 = 7 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups in G, denoted as n_7, divides |G|/7 = 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. Thus, n_7 = 1.\n\nSince n_5 = n_7 = 1, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup in G. Let P and Q be these unique subgroups. Since P and Q are the only subgroups of their respective orders, they must be normal in G. \n\nNow, consider the elements in P and Q. Since |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7, by Lagrange's Theorem, the order of any element in P is either 1 or 5, and the order of any element in Q is either 1 or 7. Let p ∈ P and q ∈ Q be elements of order 5 and 7, respectively. Then, p^5 = e and q^7 = e, where e is the identity element in G.\n\nSince P and Q are normal in G, we can consider the set PQ = {pq : p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. We claim that PQ is a subgroup of G. To show this, we need to verify that PQ is closed under the group operation and inverses.\n\nLet x, y ∈ PQ, where x = p_1q_1 and y = p_2q_2 for some p_1, p_2 ∈ P and q_1, q_2 ∈ Q. Then, xy = (p_1q_1)(p_2q_2). Since P and Q are normal, we can commute the elements: xy = (p_1p_2)(q_1q_2). Note that p_1p_2 ∈ P and q_1q_2 ∈ Q, so xy ∈ PQ. Thus, PQ is closed under the group operation.\n\nNow, consider the inverse of x ∈ PQ, where x = pq for some p ∈ P and q ∈ Q. Since P and Q are normal, (pq)^(-1) = q^(-1)p^(-1) ∈ PQ. Thus, PQ is closed under inverses.\n\nSince PQ is closed under the group operation and inverses, it is a subgroup of G. Furthermore, |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 5 * 7 = 35, which is equal to the order of G. Thus, G = PQ.\n\nNow, we will show that the intersection of P and Q is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}. Suppose there exists an element x ∈ P ∩ Q. Then, x ∈ P and x ∈ Q. Since the order of any element in P is either 1 or 5, and the order of any element in Q is either 1 or 7, the order of x must be a divisor of both 5 and 7. The only such divisor is 1, so x must be the identity element e. Thus, P ∩ Q = {e}.\n\nSince G = PQ and P ∩ Q = {e}, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q. Since P and Q are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, i.e., G ≅ Z_5 × Z_7.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is not cyclic, then it must be isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
