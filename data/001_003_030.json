    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we need to make the coefficients of either x or y the same in both equations. In this case, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x the same:\n\n(2)(2x + 3y) = (2)(8)\n4x + 6y = 16 (1)\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n\n4x + 6y = 16\n4x - 5y = -7\n\nNext, we will subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x - 5y) = 16 - (-7)\n4x + 6y - 4x + 5y = 23\n11y = 23\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 23 / 11\ny = 2\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either equation to solve for x. We'll use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n2x + 3(2) = 8\n2x + 6 = 8\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n2x = 2\n\nNow, divide by 2:\n\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1 and y = 2."
