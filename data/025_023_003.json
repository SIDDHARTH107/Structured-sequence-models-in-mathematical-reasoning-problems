    "message_2": "To compute the intersection cohomology of a singular projective curve with irreducible components of degrees 2, 3, and 4, we will first need to determine the intersection matrix of the curve. Let the irreducible components be C1, C2, and C3 with degrees 2, 3, and 4, respectively.\n\nThe intersection matrix is given by:\n\n      | C1.C1  C1.C2  C1.C3 |\n  I = | C2.C1  C2.C2  C2.C3 |\n      | C3.C1  C3.C2  C3.C3 |\n\nwhere Ci.Cj denotes the intersection number of the components Ci and Cj.\n\nSince the curve is singular, there must be at least one intersection point between the components. Let's assume that C1 and C2 intersect at a single point, C2 and C3 intersect at a single point, and C1 and C3 intersect at a single point. Then, the intersection matrix becomes:\n\n      |  0   1   1 |\n  I = |  1   0   1 |\n      |  1   1   0 |\n\nNow, we can compute the intersection cohomology groups of the curve using the following formula:\n\n  IH^i(X) = H^i(X) ⊕ H^{i-2}(X) ⊕ ... ⊕ H^0(X)\n\nwhere IH^i(X) denotes the i-th intersection cohomology group, and H^i(X) denotes the i-th ordinary cohomology group.\n\nFor a projective curve, the only non-trivial ordinary cohomology groups are H^0(X) and H^2(X). The zeroth cohomology group, H^0(X), is the constant sheaf, and its dimension is equal to the number of irreducible components, which is 3 in this case. The second cohomology group, H^2(X), is given by the top exterior power of the intersection matrix, which is the determinant of the matrix:\n\n  det(I) = 0 - 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 0\n\nThus, H^2(X) = 0.\n\nNow, we can compute the intersection cohomology groups:\n\n  IH^0(X) = H^0(X) = 3\n  IH^1(X) = 0\n  IH^2(X) = H^2(X) = 0\n\nSo, the intersection cohomology of the singular projective curve with irreducible components of degrees 2, 3, and 4 is:\n\n  IH^0(X) = 3\n  IH^1(X) = 0\n  IH^2(X) = 0"
