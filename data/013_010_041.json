    "message_1": "Suppose there are two firms, A and B, that produce identical products in a Cournot duopoly market. The total cost function for each firm can be expressed as C(q) = 2q, where q represents the quantity produced by the firm. If the market demand curve is P = 10 - q, where P is the market price, what quantity should each firm produce and what price will prevail in the market?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the reaction functions for each firm, which represent the optimal quantity each firm should produce given the quantity produced by the other firm. We will then find the Nash equilibrium, which is the point where both firms' reaction functions intersect.\n\nFirst, let's find the total revenue for each firm. The total revenue for firm A is TR_A = P * q_A, and the total revenue for firm B is TR_B = P * q_B. Since the market demand curve is P = 10 - (q_A + q_B), we can substitute this into the total revenue equations:\n\nTR_A = (10 - (q_A + q_B)) * q_A\nTR_B = (10 - (q_A + q_B)) * q_B\n\nNext, we find the profit for each firm by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:\n\nπ_A = TR_A - C(q_A) = (10 - (q_A + q_B)) * q_A - 2q_A\nπ_B = TR_B - C(q_B) = (10 - (q_A + q_B)) * q_B - 2q_B\n\nNow, we find the first-order conditions by taking the partial derivatives of the profit functions with respect to each firm's quantity:\n\n∂π_A/∂q_A = 10 - 2q_A - q_B - 2 = 8 - 2q_A - q_B\n∂π_B/∂q_B = 10 - 2q_B - q_A - 2 = 8 - 2q_B - q_A\n\nSet the first-order conditions equal to zero and solve for each firm's quantity:\n\n8 - 2q_A - q_B = 0\n8 - 2q_B - q_A = 0\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\nq_A = 2\nq_B = 2\n\nSo, each firm should produce a quantity of 2 units. Now, we can find the market price by plugging these quantities into the market demand curve:\n\nP = 10 - (q_A + q_B) = 10 - (2 + 2) = 10 - 4 = 6\n\nThus, the market price will be $6."
