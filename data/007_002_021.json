    "message_2": "To find the smallest number that can be divided by both 6 and 8, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers. \n\nFirst, find the prime factors of each number:\n6 = 2 × 3\n8 = 2 × 2 × 2\n\nNow, take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either factorization:\n2^3 = 8 (from the prime factors of 8)\n3^1 = 3 (from the prime factors of 6)\n\nMultiply these highest powers together to get the LCM:\n8 × 3 = 24\n\nSo, the smallest number that can be divided by both 6 and 8 is 24."
