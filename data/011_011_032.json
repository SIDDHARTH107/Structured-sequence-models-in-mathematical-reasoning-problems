    "message_2": "A partition of a number is a way of writing it as a sum of positive integers. We want to find the number of partitions of 6 with at most 3 parts. We can list them out systematically:\n\n1. 1-part partitions:\n   6\n\n2. 2-part partitions:\n   5 + 1\n   4 + 2\n   3 + 3\n\n3. 3-part partitions:\n   4 + 1 + 1\n   3 + 2 + 1\n   2 + 2 + 2\n\nThere are 1 one-part partition, 3 two-part partitions, and 3 three-part partitions. So, there are a total of 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 ways to partition the number 6 with at most 3 parts."
