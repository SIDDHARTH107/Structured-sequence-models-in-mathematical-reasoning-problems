    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the angle sum of a triangle is less than 180 degrees. The formula for the angle sum of a hyperbolic triangle is:\n\nAngle sum = π - A - B - C\n\nwhere A, B, and C are the excess angles (in radians) of the triangle's vertices. The excess angle is the difference between the angle at a vertex and the corresponding angle in a Euclidean triangle (which is π/3 or 60 degrees for an equilateral triangle).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given angles to radians:\n\n60 degrees = (60 * π) / 180 = π/3 radians\n75 degrees = (75 * π) / 180 = (5π/12) radians\n90 degrees = (90 * π) / 180 = π/2 radians\n\nNow, we can find the excess angles:\n\nExcess angle A = π/3 - π/3 = 0\nExcess angle B = (5π/12) - π/3 = (π/12) radians\nExcess angle C = π/2 - π/3 = π/6 radians\n\nFinally, we can find the angle sum of the hyperbolic triangle:\n\nAngle sum = π - 0 - (π/12) - (π/6) = π - (π/12) - (2π/12) = π - (3π/12) = (9π/12) = (3π/4) radians\n\nConverting back to degrees:\n\nAngle sum = (3π/4) * (180/π) = 135 degrees\n\nSo, the total angle sum of the hyperbolic triangle with angles measuring 60 degrees, 75 degrees, and 90 degrees is 135 degrees."
