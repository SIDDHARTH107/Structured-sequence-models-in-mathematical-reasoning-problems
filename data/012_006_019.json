    "message_2": "A Hamiltonian path is a path in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once. To ensure that there is a Hamiltonian path in the graph, we need to make sure that the graph remains connected after removing edges.\n\nA connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges to remain connected. In this case, with 7 vertices, the graph must have at least 7-1=6 edges to remain connected.\n\nThe graph initially has 11 edges. To find the maximum number of edges that can be removed before there is no longer a Hamiltonian path, we can subtract the minimum number of edges required for the graph to remain connected:\n\n11 - 6 = 5\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of edges that can be removed from the graph before there is no longer a Hamiltonian path is 5."
