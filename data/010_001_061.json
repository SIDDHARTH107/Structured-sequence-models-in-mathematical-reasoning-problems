A set is closed if its complement is open. The complement of {b} is {a}, which is an open set in X. Therefore, {b} is a closed set.\n\n3. {a,b} is a closed set in X.\nTrue. A set is closed if its complement is open. The complement of {a, b} is the empty set ∅, which is an open set in X. Therefore, {a, b} is a closed set.\n\n4. {a,b} is an open set in X.\nTrue. Since {a, b} is an element of the topology T, it is considered an open set in X."
