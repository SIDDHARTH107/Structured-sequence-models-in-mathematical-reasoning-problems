    "message_1": "A signal f(t) contains two sinusoidal components with frequencies of 50 Hz and 80 Hz. Write the equation for f(t) and then calculate the Fourier transform to find the amplitude and phase of the two components.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the amplitudes of the two sinusoidal components as A1 and A2, and their respective phase angles as φ1 and φ2. The equation for f(t) can be written as:\n\nf(t) = A1 * sin(2π * 50 * t + φ1) + A2 * sin(2π * 80 * t + φ2)\n\nTo find the amplitude and phase of the two components, we can calculate the Fourier transform of f(t). The Fourier transform F(ω) of f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency. We can calculate the Fourier transform of f(t) by integrating the product of f(t) and the complex exponential function over time.\n\nFor the 50 Hz component, we have:\n\nF(50 * 2π) = ∫[A1 * sin(2π * 50 * t + φ1) * e^(-j * 2π * 50 * t)] dt\n\nFor the 80 Hz component, we have:\n\nF(80 * 2π) = ∫[A2 * sin(2π * 80 * t + φ2) * e^(-j * 2π * 80 * t)] dt\n\nBy solving these integrals, we can find the amplitude and phase of the two components. The amplitude of each component can be found by taking the magnitude of the corresponding Fourier transform value, and the phase can be found by taking the angle (in radians) of the corresponding Fourier transform value.\n\nAmplitude of 50 Hz component: |F(50 * 2π)|\nPhase of 50 Hz component: angle(F(50 * 2π))\n\nAmplitude of 80 Hz component: |F(80 * 2π)|\nPhase of 80 Hz component: angle(F(80 * 2π))\n\nNote that to solve these integrals and find the amplitude and phase of the two components, we need to know the values of A1, A2, φ1, and φ2."
