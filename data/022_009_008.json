    "message_2": "To find the interval of convergence for the given power series, we will use the ratio test. The ratio test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than 1, then the series converges.\n\nLet's consider the ratio of consecutive terms:\n\n$$\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{\\frac{(x-2)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}}{\\frac{(x-2)^n}{n!}}$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{(x-2)^{n+1} \\cdot n!}{(x-2)^n \\cdot (n+1)!}$$\n\nCancel out the common terms:\n\n$$\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{(x-2)}{n+1}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the limit as n approaches infinity:\n\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-2)}{n+1}\\right|$$\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the denominator grows without bound, and the limit becomes:\n\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-2)}{n+1}\\right| = 0$$\n\nSince the limit is 0, which is less than 1, the series converges for all values of x. Therefore, the interval of convergence is:\n\n$$(-\\infty, \\infty)$$"
