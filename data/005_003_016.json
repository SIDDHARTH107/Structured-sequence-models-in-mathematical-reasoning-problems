The data are given below:\n\n| Miles Driven (x) | Rental Fee (y) |\n| --- | --- |\n| 3 | 3.8 |\n| 6 | 6.2 |\n| 9 | 8.5 |\n| 12 | 12.4 |\n| 15 | 14.2 |\n| 18 | 16.5 |\n| 21 | 19.8 |\n\nUsing regression analysis, compute the equation of the line of best fit for the data and interpret the slope and intercept of the line in the context of the problem. Use the equation to predict the rental fee for a car that has been driven 10,000 miles.",
    "message_2": "To compute the equation of the line of best fit, we need to find the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b) of the line. We can use the following formulas:\n\nm = (n * Σ(xy) - Σx * Σy) / (n * Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2)\nb = (Σy - m * Σx) / n\n\nwhere n is the number of data points, Σ denotes the sum, and x and y are the individual data points.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the necessary sums:\n\nΣx = 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 21 = 84\nΣy = 3.8 + 6.2 + 8.5 + 12.4 + 14.2 + 16.5 + 19.8 = 81.4\nΣ(xy) = (3 * 3.8) + (6 * 6.2) + (9 * 8.5) + (12 * 12.4) + (15 * 14.2) + (18 * 16.5) + (21 * 19.8) = 1004.6\nΣ(x^2) = 3^2 + 6^2 + 9^2 + 12^2 + 15^2 + 18^2 + 21^2 = 3318\n\nNow, we can calculate the slope (m) and y-intercept (b):\n\nn = 7 (number of data points)\n\nm = (7 * 1004.6 - 84 * 81.4) / (7 * 3318 - 84^2) = (7032.2 - 6833.6) / (23226 - 7056) = 198.6 / 16170 ≈ 0.0123\n\nb = (81.4 - 0.0123 * 84) / 7 = (81.4 - 1.0322) / 7 ≈ 11.4811\n\nSo, the equation of the line of best fit is:\n\ny = 0.0123x + 11.4811\n\nNow, let's interpret the slope and intercept:\n\nThe slope (0.0123) represents the increase in rental fee (in thousands of dollars) for each additional thousand miles driven. The y-intercept (11.4811) represents the base rental fee (in thousands of dollars) for a car that has not been driven at all.\n\nFinally, let's predict the rental fee for a car that has been driven 10,000 miles:\n\ny = 0.0123 * 10 + 11.4811 = 0.123 + 11.4811 ≈ 11.6041\n\nSo, the predicted rental fee for a car that has been driven 10,000 miles is approximately $11,604.10."
