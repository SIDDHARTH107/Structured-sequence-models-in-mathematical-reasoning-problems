    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that increases in length with each iteration. The length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength after n iterations = (initial length) * (multiplier)^n\n\nFor the Gosper curve, the multiplier is 7^(1/2), which is approximately 2.645751311.\n\nSo, to find the total length of the Gosper curve after three iterations, we can plug in the values:\n\nLength after 3 iterations = (1 unit) * (2.645751311)^3\n\nLength after 3 iterations ≈ 1 * 18.520259177\n\nLength after 3 iterations ≈ 18.520259177 units"
