    "message_2": "To find the minimum and maximum values of $|f(z)|$ on the closed unit disc $|z| \\leq 1$, we can use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that if a function is holomorphic (complex differentiable) in a bounded domain, then the maximum of its modulus is attained on the boundary of the domain.\n\nFirst, note that $f(z) = z^2 + 2z + 2$ is a holomorphic function, as it is a polynomial. Now, let's consider the boundary of the unit disc, which is given by $|z| = 1$. We can write $z = e^{i\\theta}$ for some angle $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. Then, we have:\n\n$$f(e^{i\\theta}) = e^{2i\\theta} + 2e^{i\\theta} + 2$$\n\nNow, let's find the modulus of $f(e^{i\\theta})$:\n\n$$|f(e^{i\\theta})| = |e^{2i\\theta} + 2e^{i\\theta} + 2|$$\n\nTo find the minimum and maximum values of this expression, we can use the triangle inequality:\n\n$$|e^{2i\\theta} + 2e^{i\\theta}| \\leq |e^{2i\\theta} + 2e^{i\\theta} + 2| \\leq |e^{2i\\theta}| + |2e^{i\\theta}| + |2|$$\n\nSince $|e^{2i\\theta}| = 1$, $|e^{i\\theta}| = 1$, and $|2| = 2$, we have:\n\n$$1 \\leq |f(e^{i\\theta})| \\leq 5$$\n\nNow, we need to check if these bounds can be attained. For the lower bound, we can try to find a value of $\\theta$ such that $e^{2i\\theta} + 2e^{i\\theta} + 2 = 1$. This occurs when $e^{i\\theta} = -1$, which corresponds to $\\theta = \\pi$. So, the minimum value of $|f(z)|$ on the closed unit disc is $1$.\n\nFor the upper bound, we can try to find a value of $\\theta$ such that $e^{2i\\theta} + 2e^{i\\theta} + 2 = 5$. This occurs when $e^{i\\theta} = 1$, which corresponds to $\\theta = 0$. So, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on the closed unit disc is $5$.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum and maximum values of $|f(z)|$ on the closed unit disc $|z| \\leq 1$ are $1$ and $5$, respectively."
