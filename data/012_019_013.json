    "message_2": "To find the chromatic index of the given graph G, we need to determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges such that no two adjacent edges have the same color.\n\nWe can start by coloring the edges as follows:\n\n1. Color the edge AB with color 1.\n2. Color the edges AC, AD, BE, and BF with color 2.\n3. Color the edges CG, DH, EG, and FH with color 3.\n4. Color the edge GH with color 1.\n\nThe resulting colored graph will look like this:\n\n```\n   A —1— B\n  /2\\   /2\\\n C   D E   F\n  \\3/   \\3/\n   G —1— H\n```\n\nAs we can see, no two adjacent edges have the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index of the given graph G is 3."
