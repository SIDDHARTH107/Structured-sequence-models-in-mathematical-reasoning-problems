    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that the derivative of x^n (where n is a constant) is nx^(n-1).\n\nSo, let's find the derivative of each term in the function:\n\n1. The derivative of 3x^2:\nUsing the power rule, we get (2)(3)x^(2-1) = 6x.\n\n2. The derivative of 2x:\nUsing the power rule, we get (1)(2)x^(1-1) = 2.\n\n3. The derivative of -5 (a constant):\nThe derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, let's combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 2\n\nNow we need to find the value of the derivative at x = 4:\n\nf'(4) = 6(4) + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5 at x = 4 is 26."
