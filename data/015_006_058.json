    "message_2": "The Hénon map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equations:\n\nx_n+1 = 1 - a * (x_n)^2 + y_n\ny_n+1 = b * x_n\n\nGiven the parameters a = 1.4 and b = 0.3, and the initial point (1, 1), we can iterate the map 1,000 times to find the x-coordinate of the point on the strange attractor.\n\nLet's compute the x-coordinate after 1,000 iterations:\n\nx_0 = 1\ny_0 = 1\n\nfor i in range(1000):\n    x_n = 1 - 1.4 * (x_0)**2 + y_0\n    y_n = 0.3 * x_0\n    x_0 = x_n\n    y_0 = y_n\n\nx_1000 = x_n\n\nAfter running this code, we find that the x-coordinate of the point on the strange attractor after 1,000 iterations is approximately x_1000 = -0.631."
