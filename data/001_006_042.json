    "message_1": "A ball is thrown into the air from the top of a building with an initial velocity of 40 meters per second. Its height, h, in meters after t seconds is given by the equation h = -5t^2 + 40t + 80. \nWhat is the maximum height the ball reaches? At what time does it attain maximum height?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum height the ball reaches, we need to find the vertex of the parabolic function h(t) = -5t^2 + 40t + 80. The vertex of a parabola in the form f(t) = at^2 + bt + c is given by the formula t_vertex = -b / 2a.\n\nIn this case, a = -5 and b = 40. So, we have:\n\nt_vertex = -40 / (2 * -5) = -40 / -10 = 4\n\nThe ball attains its maximum height at t = 4 seconds.\n\nNow, to find the maximum height, we plug t_vertex back into the height equation:\n\nh(4) = -5(4)^2 + 40(4) + 80 = -5(16) + 160 + 80 = -80 + 160 + 80 = 160\n\nThe maximum height the ball reaches is 160 meters."
