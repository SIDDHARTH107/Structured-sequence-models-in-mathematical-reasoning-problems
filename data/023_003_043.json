    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using Fourier series, we first assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x) = A(x)cos(3x) + B(x)sin(3x)\n\nNow, we differentiate u(x) with respect to x:\n\n∂u/∂x = -3A(x)sin(3x) + 3B(x)cos(3x) + A'(x)cos(3x) + B'(x)sin(3x)\n\nAnd differentiate once more:\n\n∂²u/∂x² = -9A(x)cos(3x) - 9B(x)sin(3x) - 6A'(x)sin(3x) + 6B'(x)cos(3x) + A''(x)cos(3x) + B''(x)sin(3x)\n\nNow, we substitute the assumed solution and its derivatives into the given PDE:\n\n-9A(x)cos(3x) - 9B(x)sin(3x) - 6A'(x)sin(3x) + 6B'(x)cos(3x) + A''(x)cos(3x) + B''(x)sin(3x) + 9A(x)cos(3x) + 9B(x)sin(3x) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nA''(x)cos(3x) + B''(x)sin(3x) = 0\n\nSince cos(3x) and sin(3x) are linearly independent, their coefficients must be equal to zero:\n\nA''(x) = 0\nB''(x) = 0\n\nIntegrating twice, we get:\n\nA(x) = C1\nB(x) = C2\n\nWhere C1 and C2 are constants. Therefore, the general solution is:\n\nu(x) = C1cos(3x) + C2sin(3x)\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0) = u(2π)\nC1cos(0) + C2sin(0) = C1cos(6π) + C2sin(6π)\n\nSince cos(0) = cos(6π) = 1 and sin(0) = sin(6π) = 0, we get:\n\nC1 = C1\n\nThis doesn't give us any new information, so we move on to the second boundary condition:\n\n∂u/∂x(0) = ∂u/∂x(2π)\n-3C1sin(0) + 3C2cos(0) = -3C1sin(6π) + 3C2cos(6π)\n\nSince sin(0) = sin(6π) = 0 and cos(0) = cos(6π) = 1, we get:\n\n3C2 = 3C2\n\nThis also doesn't give us any new information. However, since the boundary conditions are satisfied for any values of C1 and C2, the solution u(x) is:\n\nu(x) = C1cos(3x) + C2sin(3x)\n\nWhere C1 and C2 are arbitrary constants."
