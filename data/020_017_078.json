    "message_1": "A bridge is being designed to span a river that is 100 meters wide. It is desired to have the angle formed by the two supports of the bridge and the river bank to be 60 degrees. If the cost of the bridge increases at a rate of $200 per degree, find the angle that will minimize the cost of building the bridge.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the angle formed by the two supports of the bridge and the river bank. The cost function C(x) is given by:\n\nC(x) = 200 * (x - 60)\n\nTo minimize the cost, we need to find the critical points of the cost function. To do this, we will find the derivative of the cost function with respect to x and set it equal to 0.\n\nC'(x) = d/dx (200 * (x - 60))\n\nC'(x) = 200\n\nSince the derivative is a constant, there are no critical points. However, we know that the angle x must be between 0 and 180 degrees, as it is not possible for the angle to be negative or greater than 180 degrees. Therefore, we will check the endpoints of the interval [0, 180] to see which one minimizes the cost function.\n\nC(0) = 200 * (0 - 60) = -12000\nC(180) = 200 * (180 - 60) = 24000\n\nSince the cost function is increasing, the minimum cost occurs at the lower endpoint of the interval, which is x = 0 degrees. However, a bridge with an angle of 0 degrees would not be practical, as it would not span the river. Therefore, the angle that minimizes the cost while still being practical is x = 60 degrees."
