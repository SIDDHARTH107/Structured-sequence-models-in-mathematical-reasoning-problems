    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the algebraic surface at the point (4, -1, 2), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the surface equation with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2yz - 3x - 4.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x - 3\n∂F/∂y = 2y + 2z\n∂F/∂z = 2z + 2y\n\nNow, evaluate the partial derivatives at the point (4, -1, 2):\n\n∂F/∂x(4, -1, 2) = 2(4) - 3 = 5\n∂F/∂y(4, -1, 2) = 2(-1) + 2(2) = 2\n∂F/∂z(4, -1, 2) = 2(2) + 2(-1) = 2\n\nThe gradient of F at the point (4, -1, 2) is (5, 2, 2). This gradient is the normal vector to the tangent plane at the point (4, -1, 2).\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent plane using the point-normal form:\n\n5(x - 4) + 2(y + 1) + 2(z - 2) = 0\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n5x - 20 + 2y + 2 + 2z - 4 = 0\n5x + 2y + 2z - 22 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane to the algebraic surface at the point (4, -1, 2) is:\n\n5x + 2y + 2z - 22 = 0"
