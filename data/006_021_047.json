    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (hailstorms) in n trials (days)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (hailstorm) on any given day (0.2)\n- n is the number of trials (days in June, which is 30)\n- k is the number of successes (hailstorms) we want to find the probability for\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least three days with a hailstorm, we need to find the probability of having 3, 4, 5, ..., 30 hailstorms and sum them up. However, it's easier to find the probability of having 0, 1, or 2 hailstorms and subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probabilities for 0, 1, and 2 hailstorms:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(30, 0) * (0.2)^0 * (1-0.2)^(30-0)\nP(X = 1) = C(30, 1) * (0.2)^1 * (1-0.2)^(30-1)\nP(X = 2) = C(30, 2) * (0.2)^2 * (1-0.2)^(30-2)\n\nCalculating these probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * (0.8)^30 ≈ 0.0011\nP(X = 1) = 30 * 0.2 * (0.8)^29 ≈ 0.0087\nP(X = 2) = (30*29)/2 * (0.2)^2 * (0.8)^28 ≈ 0.0292\n\nNow, we sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) ≈ 0.0011 + 0.0087 + 0.0292 ≈ 0.0390\n\nFinally, we subtract this sum from 1 to find the probability of having at least 3 hailstorms:\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) - P(X = 2) ≈ 1 - 0.0390 ≈ 0.9610\n\nSo, the probability of having at least three days with a hailstorm in June is approximately 0.9610 or 96.10%."
