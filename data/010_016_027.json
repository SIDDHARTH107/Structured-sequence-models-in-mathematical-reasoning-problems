    "message_2": "Let H be a generic hypersurface in X. We want to compute the intersection number I(S, H) of S and H.\n\nFirst, we note that the Poincaré dual of the fundamental class [X] is represented by a 0-dimensional homology class, which we denote by [pt]. Since X is a 3-dimensional manifold, the intersection form is given by the cup product:\n\nI(S, H) = ⟨S ∪ H, [pt]⟩,\n\nwhere ⟨ , ⟩ denotes the Kronecker pairing between homology and cohomology.\n\nNow, we use the fact that the fundamental class [X] = 3a. This means that the cohomology class [X]^* = 3a in H^3(X; Z), where [X]^* is the Poincaré dual of [X]. Since H is a generic hypersurface, it represents a nonzero class in H^2(X; Z). Let [H] denote this class.\n\nWe want to compute the cup product S ∪ H. Since S is a closed orientable surface of genus 2, it has a fundamental class [S] in H_2(X; Z). By Poincaré duality, there is a unique class [S]^* in H^1(X; Z) such that ⟨[S] ∪ [S]^*, [pt]⟩ = 1.\n\nNow, we can compute the cup product:\n\nS ∪ H = [S]^* ∪ [H].\n\nSince [S]^* is in H^1(X; Z) and [H] is in H^2(X; Z), their cup product [S]^* ∪ [H] is in H^3(X; Z). Therefore, we have\n\nI(S, H) = ⟨S ∪ H, [pt]⟩ = ⟨[S]^* ∪ [H], [pt]⟩.\n\nBy the properties of the Kronecker pairing, we have\n\n⟨[S]^* ∪ [H], [pt]⟩ = ⟨[S]^*, [H] ∪ [pt]⟩.\n\nSince [H] ∪ [pt] = [H], we get\n\nI(S, H) = ⟨[S]^*, [H]⟩.\n\nNow, we use the fact that the intersection form is unimodular and nondegenerate. This means that there exists a class [H'] in H^1(X; Z) such that ⟨[H'], [H]⟩ = 1. Therefore, we have\n\nI(S, H) = ⟨[S]^*, [H]⟩ = a⟨[H'], [H]⟩ = a.\n\nSince a is a nonzero integer, the intersection number of S and a generic hypersurface in X is equal to a."
