    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 6x + 8 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 1, b = 6, and c = 8.\n\nx = (-6 ± √(6^2 - 4 * 1 * 8)) / (2 * 1)\n\nx = (-6 ± √(36 - 32)) / 2\n\nx = (-6 ± √4) / 2\n\nx = (-6 ± 2) / 2\n\nThere are two possible solutions:\n\nx = (-6 + 2) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2\n\nx = (-6 - 2) / 2 = -8 / 2 = -4\n\nSo, the solutions to the quadratic equation x^2 + 6x + 8 = 0 are x = -2 and x = -4."
