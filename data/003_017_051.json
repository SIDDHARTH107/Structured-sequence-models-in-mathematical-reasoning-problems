    "message_2": "To find the average value of a continuous function on a given interval, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = 5sin(2x), and the interval is [0, π/2]. So, a = 0 and b = π/2.\n\nAverage value = (1/(π/2 - 0)) * ∫[0, π/2] 5sin(2x) dx\n\nAverage value = (2/π) * ∫[0, π/2] 5sin(2x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of 5sin(2x) with respect to x from 0 to π/2.\n\n∫5sin(2x) dx = -5/2 * cos(2x) + C\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the integral at the bounds of the interval:\n\n[-5/2 * cos(2(π/2)) - (-5/2 * cos(2(0)))]\n\n= [-5/2 * cos(π) - (-5/2 * cos(0))]\n\n= [-5/2 * (-1) - (-5/2 * 1)]\n\n= [5/2 + 5/2]\n\n= 5\n\nNow, we'll multiply this result by the (2/π) factor from the average value formula:\n\nAverage value = (2/π) * 5\n\nAverage value = 10/π\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = 5sin(2x) on the interval [0, π/2] is 10/π."
