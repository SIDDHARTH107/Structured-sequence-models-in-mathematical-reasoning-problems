    "message_1": "Consider a population of rabbits that doubles every 4 months. Starting with 5 rabbits, write a differential equation for the population growth and solve it to find the population after 1 year. Round your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "message_2": "To model the population growth of rabbits, we can use the exponential growth equation:\n\nP(t) = P0 * e^(kt)\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, P0 is the initial population, k is the growth rate, and t is the time in months.\n\nWe are given that the population doubles every 4 months. So, when t = 4, P(t) = 2 * P0. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n2 * P0 = P0 * e^(4k)\n\nDivide both sides by P0:\n\n2 = e^(4k)\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = 4k\n\nSolve for k:\n\nk = ln(2) / 4\n\nNow we have the growth rate k. We can plug this back into the exponential growth equation along with the initial population P0 = 5:\n\nP(t) = 5 * e^((ln(2)/4)t)\n\nWe want to find the population after 1 year, which is 12 months. So, we plug in t = 12:\n\nP(12) = 5 * e^((ln(2)/4)(12))\n\nP(12) ≈ 5 * e^(3ln(2))\n\nP(12) ≈ 5 * 2^3\n\nP(12) ≈ 5 * 8\n\nP(12) ≈ 40\n\nSo, after 1 year, the population of rabbits will be approximately 40."
