    "message_1": "A right triangle ABC has a hypotenuse of length 17 cm and one of its legs is 8 cm. What is the length of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the given leg as a and the unknown leg as b. Since it's a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the unknown leg:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the legs, and c is the hypotenuse.\n\nWe are given a = 8 cm and c = 17 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n8^2 + b^2 = 17^2\n64 + b^2 = 289\n\nNow, we can solve for b^2:\n\nb^2 = 289 - 64\nb^2 = 225\n\nTaking the square root of both sides to find the length of the other leg:\n\nb = âˆš225\nb = 15 cm\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 15 cm."
