Show that there exists a covering space $p:\\tilde{X}\\rightarrow X$ such that the group of deck transformations of $\\tilde{X}$ (the group of homeomorphisms that commute with the covering map) is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group. Additionally, determine the number of sheets of the covering space $\\tilde{X}$ over $X$.",
    "message_2": "Since $\\pi_1(X, x_0) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, we know that there is a normal subgroup $N \\trianglelefteq \\pi_1(X, x_0)$ such that the quotient group $\\pi_1(X, x_0) / N$ is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group, which we denote as $V_4$. The Klein 4-group has the following presentation:\n\n$$V_4 = \\{1, a, b, c\\} \\text{ with } a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = 1 \\text{ and } ab = c = ba.$$\n\nNow, consider the group homomorphism $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\to V_4$ defined by $\\phi(1) = a$ and $\\phi(2) = b$. This homomorphism is surjective, and its kernel is $N = \\{0, 2\\}$. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} / N \\cong V_4$.\n\nBy the Galois correspondence between covering spaces and subgroups of the fundamental group, there exists a covering space $p: \\tilde{X} \\to X$ such that $\\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x}_0) = N$, where $\\tilde{x}_0$ is a point in the fiber $p^{-1}(x_0)$. The group of deck transformations of $\\tilde{X}$ is isomorphic to the quotient group $\\pi_1(X, x_0) / \\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x}_0) = \\pi_1(X, x_0) / N \\cong V_4$.\n\nTo determine the number of sheets of the covering space $\\tilde{X}$ over $X$, we can use the fact that the number of sheets is equal to the index of the subgroup $\\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x}_0)$ in $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$. In this case, we have:\n\n$$[\\pi_1(X, x_0) : \\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x}_0)] = [\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} : N] = [\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} : \\{0, 2\\}] = 2.$$\n\nThus, the covering space $\\tilde{X}$ has 2 sheets over $X$."
