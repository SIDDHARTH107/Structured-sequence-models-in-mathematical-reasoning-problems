    "message_2": "The conformal map that transforms the upper-half plane onto the interior of the unit circle preserving the point at infinity is called the Möbius transformation. It can be defined as follows:\n\nGiven the upper-half plane H = {z ∈ ℂ : Im(z) > 0}, the Möbius transformation that maps H onto the interior of the unit circle D = {z ∈ ℂ : |z| < 1} is given by:\n\nf(z) = (z - i)/(z + i),\n\nwhere z ∈ H and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nThis transformation has the properties of being conformal (preserving angles) and maps the point at infinity to the boundary of the unit circle."
