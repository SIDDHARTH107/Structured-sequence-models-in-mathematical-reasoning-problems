    "message_2": "To show that the intersection of A and B is a subset of A and B, we first need to find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nIntersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, can be found as follows:\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nComparing the elements of A and B, we can see that the common elements are 2 and 4. Therefore, the intersection of A and B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nNow, we need to show that A ∩ B is a subset of both A and B. A set C is a subset of another set D, denoted as C ⊆ D, if every element of C is also an element of D.\n\nLet's check if A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x is also an element of A. Since A ∩ B = {2, 4}, and both 2 and 4 are elements of A, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nA ∩ B ⊆ A\n\nNow, let's check if A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x is also an element of B. Since A ∩ B = {2, 4}, and both 2 and 4 are elements of B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nA ∩ B ⊆ B\n\nThus, we have shown that the intersection of A and B, A ∩ B, is a subset of both A and B."
