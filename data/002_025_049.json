    "message_1": "An isosceles triangle has two equal sides with a length of 8 cm each. If the length of the remaining side is x cm, what is the value of x?",
    "message_2": "Since the problem does not specify the type of isosceles triangle or any angles, we cannot determine a unique value for x. However, we can provide a range for the possible values of x.\n\nIn an isosceles triangle, the two equal sides are called the legs, and the remaining side is called the base. The base can have a length between the difference and the sum of the lengths of the legs (excluding these values, as they would result in a degenerate triangle).\n\nSo, the possible range for the length of the base (x) is:\n\n8 - 8 < x < 8 + 8\n0 < x < 16\n\nTherefore, the value of x can be any number between 0 and 16, but not including 0 and 16."
