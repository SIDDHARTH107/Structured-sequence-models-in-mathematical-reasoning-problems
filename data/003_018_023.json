    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = sin(x) + cos(3x) at x = π/4, we first need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x.\n\nThe derivative of sin(x) with respect to x is cos(x).\nThe derivative of cos(3x) with respect to x is -3sin(3x) (using the chain rule).\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = sin(x) + cos(3x) is:\n\nf'(x) = cos(x) - 3sin(3x)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the derivative at x = π/4:\n\nf'(π/4) = cos(π/4) - 3sin(3(π/4))\n\ncos(π/4) = √2/2\nsin(3(π/4)) = sin(3π/4) = √2/2\n\nf'(π/4) = (√2/2) - 3(√2/2) = -2(√2/2) = -√2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = sin(x) + cos(3x) at x = π/4 is -√2."
