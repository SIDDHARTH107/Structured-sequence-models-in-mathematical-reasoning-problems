    "message_2": "To find the value of sin(60°) and cos(45°), we can use the properties of special triangles.\n\nFor sin(60°), consider an equilateral triangle with side length 2. If we cut it in half, we get a 30-60-90 right triangle, with the hypotenuse being 2, the side opposite the 60° angle being √3, and the side adjacent to the 60° angle being 1. The sine function is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. So, sin(60°) = (√3)/2.\n\nFor cos(45°), consider a 45-45-90 right triangle, where the two legs are equal in length and the hypotenuse is √2 times the length of each leg. Let the length of each leg be 1. Then, the hypotenuse is √2. The cosine function is defined as the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. Since both legs are equal in length, cos(45°) = 1/√2, which can also be written as √2/2.\n\nSo, sin(60°) = (√3)/2 and cos(45°) = √2/2."
