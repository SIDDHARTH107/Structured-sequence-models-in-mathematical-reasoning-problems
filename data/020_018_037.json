    "message_1": "A seller has a total of 10 items to sell, and two buyers are interested in buying them. The first buyer values the items at $50 each, while the second buyer values the items at $100 each. However, the second buyer is only interested in buying 6 items in total. What is the optimal allocation of items for the seller to maximize their revenue?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the revenue, the seller should allocate the items based on the buyers' valuations. Since the second buyer values the items at a higher price ($100 each) and is interested in buying 6 items, the seller should sell 6 items to the second buyer. This will generate a revenue of 6 * $100 = $600.\n\nThe remaining 4 items can be sold to the first buyer, who values them at $50 each. This will generate a revenue of 4 * $50 = $200.\n\nSo, the optimal allocation is 6 items to the second buyer and 4 items to the first buyer, resulting in a total revenue of $600 + $200 = $800."
