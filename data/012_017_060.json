    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges such that every vertex in the graph is incident to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges in the set share a common vertex.\n\nIn graph G, we can find a perfect matching:\n\n1. Connect vertex 1 to vertex 2.\n2. Connect vertex 3 to vertex 5.\n3. Connect vertex 4 to vertex 6.\n\nThe perfect matching consists of the edges (1, 2), (3, 5), and (4, 6). Each vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex in the matching, and no two edges share a common vertex."
