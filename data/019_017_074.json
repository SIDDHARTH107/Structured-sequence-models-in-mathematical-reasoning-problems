    "message_2": "Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with the relationship between formal languages and their interpretations, or models. However, the given statement can be proved using basic number theory and the concept of divisibility. Here's a proof using number theory:\n\nProof:\n\nLet x and y be positive integers such that x divides y. By definition of divisibility, there exists a positive integer k such that y = x * k.\n\nNow, we have three cases:\n\n1) k = 1: In this case, y = x * 1 = x, so x is equal to y.\n\n2) k > 1: Since k is a positive integer greater than 1, we have x * k > x * 1, which implies y > x. Thus, x is less than y.\n\n3) k < 1: This case is not possible, as k is a positive integer and cannot be less than 1.\n\nFrom cases 1 and 2, we can conclude that if x divides y, then x is less than or equal to y. This completes the proof."
