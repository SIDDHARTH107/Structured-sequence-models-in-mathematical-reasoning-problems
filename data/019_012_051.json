    "message_2": "Paraconsistent logic is a non-classical logic system that allows for contradictions to exist without leading to an explosion of truth values. However, the equation \"x + 5 = 12\" does not involve any contradictions, so we can solve it using classical logic.\n\nTo solve for x, we can simply subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\nx = 7\n\nSo, x = 7 is the solution to the equation \"x + 5 = 12\"."
