    "message_2": "To determine if the complex number c lies within the Mandelbrot set, we need to iterate the function f(z) = z^2 + c with z starting at 0 and see if the magnitude of z remains bounded (less than or equal to 2) after 100 iterations. If it does, then c is in the Mandelbrot set; otherwise, it is not.\n\nLet's denote the iterations as z_n, where n is the iteration number. We start with z_0 = 0, and we have:\n\nz_1 = z_0^2 + c = c\nz_2 = z_1^2 + c = (c^2 + c)\nz_3 = z_2^2 + c = ((c^2 + c)^2 + c)\n...\n\nWe need to check if the magnitude of z_n remains bounded after 100 iterations. To do this, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Set z = 0 and n = 0.\n2. Calculate z = z^2 + c.\n3. Check if the magnitude of z is greater than 2. If it is, then c is not in the Mandelbrot set.\n4. Increment n by 1. If n is less than 100, go back to step 2. Otherwise, c is in the Mandelbrot set.\n\nPlease provide the complex number c to check if it lies within the Mandelbrot set."
