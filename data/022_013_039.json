    "message_2": "The function f(z) = 3z^4 + 4iz^3 - 6z^2 + 2 is a polynomial function with complex coefficients. Polynomial functions are analytic everywhere in the complex plane, so f(z) is analytic.\n\nTo find the derivative of f(z), we can use the standard rules of differentiation:\n\nf'(z) = d/dz (3z^4 + 4iz^3 - 6z^2 + 2)\n     = 3 * d/dz (z^4) + 4i * d/dz (z^3) - 6 * d/dz (z^2) + d/dz (2)\n     = 3 * (4z^3) + 4i * (3z^2) - 6 * (2z) + 0\n     = 12z^3 + 12iz^2 - 12z\n\nSo, the derivative of f(z) is f'(z) = 12z^3 + 12iz^2 - 12z."
