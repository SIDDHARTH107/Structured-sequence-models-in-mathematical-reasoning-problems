    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2/x) + (3/2x) = 5/6, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator for x and 2x is 2x. \n\nNow, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:\n\n(2/x) * (2/2) + (3/2x) = (4/2x) + (3/2x)\n\nNow, we can add the fractions on the left side:\n\n(4/2x) + (3/2x) = 7/2x\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n7/2x = 5/6\n\nNow, we can solve for x by cross-multiplying:\n\n7 * 6 = 5 * 2x\n\n42 = 10x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 10:\n\nx = 42/10\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nx = 21/5\n\nSo, the solution for x is 21/5."
