    "message_2": "To find the chromatic index of the given graph, we can use Vizing's theorem, which states that the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G is either its maximum degree Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree Δ(G) of the graph. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it. In the given graph, we can see that the maximum degree is 3, as there are vertices with 3 edges connected to them.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the chromatic index is Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1. In this case, since the graph is not a complete graph (i.e., not every vertex is connected to every other vertex), we can try to color the edges using 3 colors.\n\nWe can color the edges as follows:\n\n1. Color the top-left edge (connecting vertices 1 and 2) with color 1.\n2. Color the top-right edge (connecting vertices 2 and 3) with color 2.\n3. Color the bottom-left edge (connecting vertices 1 and 4) with color 2.\n4. Color the bottom-right edge (connecting vertices 3 and 4) with color 1.\n5. Color the left-middle edge (connecting vertices 1 and 5) with color 3.\n6. Color the right-middle edge (connecting vertices 3 and 5) with color 3.\n7. Color the top-middle edge (connecting vertices 2 and 5) with color 1.\n8. Color the bottom-middle edge (connecting vertices 4 and 5) with color 2.\n\nAs we can see, we have successfully colored the edges of the graph using 3 colors, with no two adjacent edges having the same color. Therefore, the chromatic index of the graph is 3."
