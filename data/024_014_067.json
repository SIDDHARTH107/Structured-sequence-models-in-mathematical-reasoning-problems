    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of the vector field $V$ with respect to the vector field $W$, we use the Lie bracket of the two vector fields, which is defined as:\n\n$$[W, V] = WV - VW$$\n\nwhere $WV$ and $VW$ represent the action of the vector fields on each other. In our case, we have:\n\n$$WV = x\\partial_y(2x\\partial_x + y\\partial_y) - y\\partial_x(2x\\partial_x + y\\partial_y)$$\n\nNow, we compute the action of the partial derivatives on the vector fields:\n\n$$x\\partial_y(2x\\partial_x) = 0$$\n$$x\\partial_y(y\\partial_y) = x\\partial_y(y) = x$$\n$$y\\partial_x(2x\\partial_x) = y\\partial_x(2x) = 2y$$\n$$y\\partial_x(y\\partial_y) = 0$$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$$WV = x\\partial_y(2x\\partial_x + y\\partial_y) - y\\partial_x(2x\\partial_x + y\\partial_y) = x - 2y$$\n\nNow, we compute the action of $V$ on $W$:\n\n$$VW = (2x\\partial_x + y\\partial_y)(x\\partial_y - y\\partial_x)$$\n\nAgain, we compute the action of the partial derivatives on the vector fields:\n\n$$2x\\partial_x(x\\partial_y) = 2x\\partial_x(x) = 2x$$\n$$2x\\partial_x(-y\\partial_x) = -2x\\partial_x(y) = -2x$$\n$$y\\partial_y(x\\partial_y) = 0$$\n$$y\\partial_y(-y\\partial_x) = -y\\partial_y(y) = -y$$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$$VW = (2x\\partial_x + y\\partial_y)(x\\partial_y - y\\partial_x) = 2x - 2x - y = -y$$\n\nNow, we compute the Lie bracket $[W, V] = WV - VW$:\n\n$$[W, V] = (x - 2y) - (-y) = x - y$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate the Lie derivative at the point $(1, 2, 2) \\in S^2$:\n\n$$[W, V](1, 2, 2) = 1 - 2 = -1$$\n\nSo, the Lie derivative of the vector field $V$ with respect to the vector field $W$ at the point $(1, 2, 2) \\in S^2$ is $-1$."
