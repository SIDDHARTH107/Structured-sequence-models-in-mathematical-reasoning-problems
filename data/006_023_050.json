    "message_2": "To find the probability of a person buying a product from a market, we can use the formula for conditional probability:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)\n\nwhere P(A) is the probability of the person visiting the market, P(B|A) is the probability of the person buying the product given that they visit the market, and P(A and B) is the probability of both events occurring (the person visiting the market and buying the product).\n\nIn this case, P(A) = 0.6 and P(B|A) = 0.4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(A and B) = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24\n\nSo the probability of a person buying a product from the market is 0.24 or 24%."
