    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between node 1 and node 6, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or simply analyze the graph by following the paths and adding the weights of the edges.\n\nStarting from node 1, we have three possible paths to reach node 6:\n\n1. Path 1: 1 → 3 → 4 → 6\n   - Edge weights: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9\n\n2. Path 2: 1 → 3 → 6\n   - Edge weights: 1 + 7 = 8\n\n3. Path 3: 1 → 3 → 4 → 7 → 6\n   - Edge weights: 1 + 3 + 2 + 6 = 12\n\nComparing the total weights of the paths, we can see that Path 2 has the shortest distance with a total weight of 8. Therefore, the shortest path between node 1 and node 6 is 1 → 3 → 6."
