    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent (λ) is a measure of the rate at which nearby trajectories in a dynamical system diverge or converge. In the context of a weather system, it can help us understand the predictability of the system. The formula to calculate the Lyapunov exponent is:\n\nλ = (1/t) * ln(|δx(t)/δx(0)|)\n\nwhere t is the time, δx(t) is the uncertainty in the system at time t, and δx(0) is the initial uncertainty.\n\nIn this case, we are given the initial uncertainty (δx(0)) as 0.1 degrees Celsius, and the divergence rate as 0.01 degree Celsius per hour. We can rewrite the formula as:\n\nλ = (1/t) * ln(|(δx(0) + 0.01t)/δx(0)|)\n\nWe want to find the Lyapunov exponent for the given weather system. To do this, we need to find the time (t) at which the uncertainty has doubled. So, we set δx(t) = 2 * δx(0):\n\n2 * δx(0) = δx(0) + 0.01t\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt = (2 * δx(0) - δx(0)) / 0.01 = δx(0) / 0.01 = 0.1 / 0.01 = 10 hours\n\nNow, we can plug this value of t back into the formula for the Lyapunov exponent:\n\nλ = (1/10) * ln(|(0.1 + 0.01 * 10)/0.1|)\nλ = (1/10) * ln(2)\nλ ≈ 0.0693\n\nSo, the Lyapunov exponent of the weather system is approximately 0.0693 per hour. This positive value indicates that the system is indeed chaotic, as nearby trajectories in the system diverge over time, making long-term predictions difficult."
