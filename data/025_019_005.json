    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space of cubic forms vanishing on X, we will use the following approach:\n\n1. Compute the degree of X.\n2. Compute the dimension of the space of cubic forms in projective 3-space.\n3. Compute the dimension of the space of cubic forms vanishing on X using the formula: dim(V) = dim(P) - deg(X) + 1, where V is the space of cubic forms vanishing on X, P is the space of cubic forms in projective 3-space, and deg(X) is the degree of X.\n\nStep 1: Compute the degree of X\nThe degree of X is the number of intersection points of X with a general hyperplane in projective 3-space. Since X is a Fano variety given by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3 = 0, it is a cubic hypersurface. Therefore, the degree of X is 3.\n\nStep 2: Compute the dimension of the space of cubic forms in projective 3-space\nA cubic form in projective 3-space can be written as a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 in the variables x, y, z, and w. There are (3+4-1) choose (4-1) = 6 choose 3 = 20 monomials in such a polynomial. Therefore, the dimension of the space of cubic forms in projective 3-space is 20.\n\nStep 3: Compute the dimension of the space of cubic forms vanishing on X\nUsing the formula from the beginning, we have dim(V) = dim(P) - deg(X) + 1 = 20 - 3 + 1 = 18.\n\nSo, the dimension of the space of cubic forms vanishing on X is 18."
