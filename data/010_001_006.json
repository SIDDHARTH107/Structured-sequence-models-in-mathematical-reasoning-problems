    "message_2": "First, let's find the complements of B and C with respect to A:\n\nB' (complement of B) = A - B = {2, 4}\nC' (complement of C) = A - C = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNow, let's determine if B and C are open or closed:\n\nB = {1, 3, 5} is not a member of T and cannot be formed by taking the union of any members of T, so B is not open. However, its complement B' = {2, 4} is a subset of {1, 2} and {3, 4, 5}, which are both in T. Therefore, B is closed.\n\nC = {2, 4} is not a member of T and cannot be formed by taking the union of any members of T, so C is not open. Its complement C' = {1, 3, 5} is not a member of T and cannot be formed by taking the union of any members of T, so C' is not open either. Since C' is not open, C is not closed.\n\nIn conclusion, B is closed and C is neither open nor closed in this topological space."
