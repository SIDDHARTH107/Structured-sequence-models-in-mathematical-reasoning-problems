    "message_2": "To prove the combinatorial identity, we will use the definition of combinations and some algebraic manipulations.\n\nRecall that nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!) where n! denotes the factorial of n (i.e., the product of all positive integers up to n).\n\nLet's first compute the left-hand side of the identity:\n\n5C2 * (2+1) = (5! / (2!(5-2)!)) * 3\n= (5! / (2!3!)) * 3\n= (5 * 4 * 3! / (2 * 1 * 3!)) * 3\n= (5 * 4 / 2) * 3\n= 10 * 3\n= 30\n\nNow, let's compute the right-hand side of the identity:\n\n(5+1)C(2+1) = 6C3\n= 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n= (6 * 5 * 4 * 3! / (3! * 3!))\n= (6 * 5 * 4) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n= 30\n\nSince both sides of the identity are equal (30 = 30), the combinatorial identity holds true for this specific example.\n\nNow, let's prove the identity in general:\n\nnCr * (r+1) = (n+1)Cr+1\n\nUsing the definition of combinations:\n\n(n! / (r!(n-r)!)) * (r+1) = ((n+1)! / ((r+1)!(n+1-(r+1))!))\n\nMultiply both sides by r!(n-r)!:\n\nn! * (r+1) = (n+1)! / ((r+1)!(n-r)!)\n\nNow, multiply both sides by (r+1)!(n-r)!:\n\nn! * (r+1) * (r+1)!(n-r)! = (n+1)!\n\nSimplify the left-hand side:\n\n(n! * (r+1) * (r+1)!(n-r)!) / ((r+1)!(n-r)!) = (n+1)!\n\nCancel out the (r+1)!(n-r)! terms:\n\nn! * (r+1) = (n+1)!\n\nDivide both sides by n!:\n\n(r+1) = (n+1)! / n!\n\nSince (n+1)! = (n+1)n!, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n(r+1) = ((n+1)n!) / n!\n\nCancel out the n! terms:\n\n(r+1) = (n+1)\n\nThis equation shows that the combinatorial identity holds true in general."
