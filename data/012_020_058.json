    "message_2": "The given graph can be represented as two disjoint 4-cycles. Let's label the vertices of the first 4-cycle as A, B, C, and D, and the vertices of the second 4-cycle as E, F, G, and H, as shown below:\n\n```\nA --- B        E --- F\n|     |        |     |\nD --- C        H --- G\n```\n\nAn automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms.\n\nFor the first 4-cycle, there are 8 automorphisms: the identity (A, B, C, D), three rotations (B, C, D, A), (C, D, A, B), (D, A, B, C), and four reflections (A, D, C, B), (B, A, D, C), (C, B, A, D), (D, C, B, A).\n\nFor the second 4-cycle, there are also 8 automorphisms: the identity (E, F, G, H), three rotations (F, G, H, E), (G, H, E, F), (H, E, F, G), and four reflections (E, H, G, F), (F, E, H, G), (G, F, E, H), (H, G, F, E).\n\nSince the two 4-cycles are disjoint, the automorphisms of the entire graph G can be obtained by combining the automorphisms of each 4-cycle. Therefore, the automorphism group of G has 8 * 8 = 64 elements."
