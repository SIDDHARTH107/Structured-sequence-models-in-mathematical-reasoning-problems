    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B. Each unit of product A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time, while each unit of product B requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time. The company can have at most 270 hours of labor and 180 hours of machine time each week. Product A sells for $10 per unit and product B sells for $8 per unit. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its weekly revenue?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are as follows:\n3x + 2y ≤ 270 (labor constraint)\n2x + y ≤ 180 (machine constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the revenue is:\nR = 10x + 8y\n\nTo find the feasible region, we first solve the constraints for y:\n\nLabor constraint:\ny ≤ (270 - 3x)/2\n\nMachine constraint:\ny ≤ 180 - 2x\n\nNow, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of inequalities:\n\n1) Intersection of labor constraint and y-axis (x=0):\ny ≤ (270 - 3*0)/2\ny ≤ 135\n\n2) Intersection of machine constraint and y-axis (x=0):\ny ≤ 180 - 2*0\ny ≤ 180\n\n3) Intersection of labor constraint and x-axis (y=0):\nx ≤ 270/3\nx ≤ 90\n\n4) Intersection of machine constraint and x-axis (y=0):\nx ≤ 180/2\nx ≤ 90\n\n5) Intersection of labor constraint and machine constraint:\n3x + 2y = 270\n2x + y = 180\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\nx = 60\ny = 60\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are (0, 135), (0, 180), (90, 0), and (60, 60).\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1) R(0, 135) = 10(0) + 8(135) = 1080\n2) R(0, 180) = 10(0) + 8(180) = 1440\n3) R(90, 0) = 10(90) + 8(0) = 900\n4) R(60, 60) = 10(60) + 8(60) = 1080\n\nThe maximum revenue is $1440, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of product A and 180 units of product B."
