    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a raised to the power of p is congruent to a modulo p.\n\nIn this case, we have a = 121 and p = 5. Since 5 is a prime number, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n121^5 ≡ 121 (mod 5)\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when 121 is divided by 5. We can simply perform the division:\n\n121 ÷ 5 = 24 with a remainder of 1.\n\nSo, the remainder when 121 is divided by 5 is 1."
