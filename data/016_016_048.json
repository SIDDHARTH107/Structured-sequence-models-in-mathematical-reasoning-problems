    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Peano-Gosper curve or the flowsnake, is a space-filling fractal curve. With each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 7/3. To find the perimeter of the 6th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial Side Length * (Length Increase Factor) ^ Number of Iterations\n\nIn this case, the initial side length is 100 units, the length increase factor is 7/3, and the number of iterations is 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPerimeter = 100 * (7/3)^6\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nPerimeter ≈ 100 * 117.649\n\nPerimeter ≈ 11764.9 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 6th iteration of the Gosper curve fractal with an initial side length of 100 units is approximately 11,764.9 units."
