    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. To find the maximum size of an independent set in G, we can use a greedy algorithm to select non-adjacent vertices.\n\n1. Start with an empty set S.\n2. Choose a vertex with the smallest degree and add it to S. If there are multiple vertices with the same smallest degree, choose any one of them.\n3. Remove the chosen vertex and its neighbors from the graph.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until there are no vertices left in the graph.\n\nFollowing this algorithm, we can find the maximum size of an independent set in G:\n\n1. S = {}\n2. Choose vertex 1 (smallest degree, 1). S = {1}\n3. Remove vertex 1 and its neighbor (vertex 2) from the graph.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3:\n   - Choose vertex 3 (smallest degree, 1). S = {1, 3}\n   - Remove vertex 3 and its neighbor (vertex 4) from the graph.\n   - Choose vertex 5 (smallest degree, 1). S = {1, 3, 5}\n   - Remove vertex 5 and its neighbor (vertex 6) from the graph.\n   - No vertices left in the graph.\n\nThe maximum size of an independent set in G is 3, and the vertices belonging to such a set are {1, 3, 5}."
