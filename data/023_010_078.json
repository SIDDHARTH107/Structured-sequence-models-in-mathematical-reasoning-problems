    "message_1": "As per your requirements, here is a numerical problem based on the topic of \"Applying the Fourier transform to image processing\":\n\nSuppose you are given an image of size 256x256 pixels, which has been corrupted by noise. You want to remove the noise using the Fourier transform. For this, you decide to first apply the 2-D Fourier transform to the image to obtain its frequency domain representation. Then, you apply a Gaussian filter to the frequency domain image to remove high-frequency noise. Finally, you inverse-transform the filtered frequency domain image to obtain the denoised version of the original image.\n\nNow, you need to make a MATLAB program to implement these steps. Assume that the input image is stored as a matrix I of size 256x256, where the pixel values range from 0 to 255. The parameters of the Gaussian filter are: Ïƒ = 15 (standard deviation of the filter) and N = 30 (size of the filter, i.e., the filter is a square matrix of size 30x30).\n\nTask for the student: Write a MATLAB function to implement these steps and apply it to the given input image to obtain its denoised version. Write the resulting denoised image to a file in the current directory.",
    "message_2": "Here is a MATLAB function that implements the described steps to denoise the input image using the Fourier transform and Gaussian filter:\n\n```matlab\nfunction denoised_image = denoise_image(I, sigma, filter_size)\n    % Apply 2-D Fourier transform to the input image\n    F = fft2(I);\n\n    % Create Gaussian filter\n    [X, Y] = meshgrid(-floor(filter_size/2):floor(filter_size/2), -floor(filter_size/2):floor(filter_size/2));\n    G = exp(-(X.^2 + Y.^2) / (2 * sigma^2));\n    G = G / sum(G(:));\n\n    % Pad Gaussian filter to the size of the input image\n    padded_G = zeros(size(I));\n    padded_G(1:filter_size, 1:filter_size) = G;\n    padded_G = circshift(padded_G, [-floor(filter_size/2), -floor(filter_size/2)]);\n\n    % Apply Gaussian filter to the frequency domain image\n    filtered_F = F .* fft2(padded_G);\n\n    % Inverse-transform the filtered frequency domain image\n    denoised_image = real(ifft2(filtered_F));\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with the input image matrix `I`, the standard deviation `sigma`, and the filter size `filter_size`. For example:\n\n```matlab\n% Load input image (assuming it is a grayscale image)\nI = imread('input_image.png');\n\n% Denoise the image using the provided function\nsigma = 15;\nfilter_size = 30;\ndenoised_image = denoise_image(I, sigma, filter_size);\n\n% Save the denoised image to a file\nimwrite(denoised_image, 'denoised_image.png');\n```\n\nThis code will apply the denoising process to the input image and save the denoised image to a file named 'denoised_image.png' in the current directory."
