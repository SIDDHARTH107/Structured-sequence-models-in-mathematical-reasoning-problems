    "message_2": "To find the derivative f'(x) of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx + d(5x)/dx - d(2)/dx\n\nFor the first term, 3x^2:\nn = 2, so f'(x) = 2 * 3x^(2-1) = 6x\n\nFor the second term, 5x:\nn = 1, so f'(x) = 1 * 5x^(1-1) = 5\n\nFor the third term, -2:\nSince it's a constant, its derivative is 0.\n\nNow, combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 5\n\nNow we need to find the derivative f'(x) at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17\n\nSo, the derivative f'(x) at x = 2 is 17."
