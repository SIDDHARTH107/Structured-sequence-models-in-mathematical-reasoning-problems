    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron fractal is constructed by recursively removing smaller tetrahedrons from the initial larger tetrahedron. In each iteration, the number of tetrahedrons added is a power of 4.\n\n1st iteration: 4^0 = 1 tetrahedron (the initial large tetrahedron)\n2nd iteration: 4^1 = 4 tetrahedrons (4 smaller tetrahedrons added)\n3rd iteration: 4^2 = 16 tetrahedrons (16 even smaller tetrahedrons added)\n\nTo find the total number of tetrahedrons needed to construct the Sierpinski tetrahedron fractal up through the 3rd iteration, we sum the number of tetrahedrons in each iteration:\n\n1 + 4 + 16 = 21 tetrahedrons."
