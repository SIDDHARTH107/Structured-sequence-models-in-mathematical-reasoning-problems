The demand for tables decreases by 10% for each $10 increase in price. What is the optimal price that the manufacturer should charge to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the price of a table as P and the number of tables sold per month as Q. The cost per table is $100, and the current price is $200, with 100 tables sold per month.\n\nThe demand decreases by 10% for each $10 increase in price. So, for every $10 increase in price, the number of tables sold decreases by 10% of the initial 100 tables, which is 10 tables.\n\nLet x be the number of $10 increments in price. Then, the price function can be written as:\n\nP = 200 + 10x\n\nAnd the quantity function can be written as:\n\nQ = 100 - 10x\n\nThe profit function can be calculated as:\n\nProfit = (P - Cost) * Q\n\nSince the cost per table is $100, the profit function becomes:\n\nProfit = (P - 100) * Q\n\nNow, we can substitute the price and quantity functions into the profit function:\n\nProfit = ((200 + 10x) - 100) * (100 - 10x)\nProfit = (100 + 10x) * (100 - 10x)\n\nExpanding the profit function, we get:\n\nProfit = 10000 - 1000x + 1000x - 100x^2\nProfit = -100x^2 + 10000\n\nTo find the optimal price to maximize profit, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by the profit function. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nIn our case, a = -100 and b = 0, so:\n\nx = -0 / (2 * -100)\nx = 0\n\nSince x represents the number of $10 increments in price, and x = 0, there is no need to increase the price. Therefore, the optimal price to maximize profit is the current price of $200 per table."
