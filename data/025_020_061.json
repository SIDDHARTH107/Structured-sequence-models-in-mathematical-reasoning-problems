    "message_2": "To find the number of isolated rational points of X, we first need to understand the structure of the Calabi-Yau variety X. The equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + t^3 = 0 defines a Fermat cubic in CP^3. \n\nNow, consider the projective transformation (x, y, z, t) → (x, y, z, t + x + y + z). This transformation maps the Fermat cubic to the equation:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 + (t + x + y + z)^3 = 0.\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nt^3 + 3t^2(x + y + z) + 3t(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 0.\n\nNow, let's look for rational points on this variety. A rational point (x, y, z, t) on X has all its coordinates as rational numbers. Since X is a Calabi-Yau variety, it is smooth, and we can use the Jacobian criterion to check for isolated rational points.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix of X is given by the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x, y, z, and t:\n\nJ(X) = [∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, ∂f/∂z, ∂f/∂t],\n\nwhere f(x, y, z, t) = t^3 + 3t^2(x + y + z) + 3t(x^2 + y^2 + z^2).\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3t^2 + 6tx,\n∂f/∂y = 3t^2 + 6ty,\n∂f/∂z = 3t^2 + 6tz,\n∂f/∂t = 3t^2 + 6t(x + y + z).\n\nFor a point to be an isolated rational point, the rank of the Jacobian matrix must be less than the dimension of X, which is 3. However, the rank of J(X) is always 3, as the partial derivatives are linearly independent. Therefore, there are no isolated rational points on the Calabi-Yau variety X."
