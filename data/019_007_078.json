    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it's not possible to provide a precise numerical problem for the subtopic of non-monotonic logic, as it deals with reasoning under uncertainty and incomplete information, rather than numerical computations. Non-monotonic logic is about reasoning with assumptions that can later be retracted or modified. Can I help with anything else in mathematics?",
    "message_2": "Of course! I'd be happy to help with any other mathematical topic or problem you have in mind. Please provide the problem or topic you'd like assistance with, and I'll do my best to help you."
