    "message_2": "We are given that $f'(z) = f(z)$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, which is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. To solve this equation, we can use the integrating factor method.\n\nLet $g(z) = e^{-z}$ be the integrating factor. Then, we multiply both sides of the equation by $g(z)$:\n\n$e^{-z}f'(z) = e^{-z}f(z)$.\n\nNow, notice that the left-hand side is the derivative of the product $e^{-z}f(z)$:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dz}(e^{-z}f(z)) = e^{-z}f(z)$.\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $z$, we get:\n\n$e^{-z}f(z) = \\int e^{-z}f(z) dz + C$,\n\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. Now, we can solve for $f(z)$:\n\n$f(z) = e^z \\left(\\int e^{-z}f(z) dz + C\\right)$.\n\nSince $f(z)$ is an entire function, it must have a power series representation. The only entire function that satisfies the given differential equation and has a power series representation is the exponential function:\n\n$f(z) = Ce^z$,\n\nwhere $C$ is a constant.\n\nNow, we use the given condition $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1$ to find the value of $C$:\n\n$1 = Ce^{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$.\n\nSolving for $C$, we get:\n\n$C = e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$.\n\nThus, the entire function $f(z)$ that satisfies the given conditions is:\n\n$f(z) = e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{4}}e^z = e^{z-\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$."
