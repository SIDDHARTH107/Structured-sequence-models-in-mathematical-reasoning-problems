    "message_2": "To find the range of weights that contains the middle 50% of the candy bars, we need to find the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile of the weights. Since we know that 76% of the candy bars weigh between 54 g and 59 g, we can use this information to approximate the percentiles.\n\nLet's assume that the 25th percentile is at 54 g and the 75th percentile is at 59 g. This means that 50% of the candy bars are between these two weights, and the remaining 50% are either lighter or heavier. Since 76% of the candy bars are between 54 g and 59 g, the remaining 24% are either lighter or heavier.\n\nWe can divide this 24% equally between the lighter and heavier candy bars, so 12% are lighter than 54 g and 12% are heavier than 59 g. This means that the 25th percentile is at 54 g (12% lighter + 25% middle = 37% of the candy bars) and the 75th percentile is at 59 g (37% + 50% middle = 87% of the candy bars).\n\nSo, the approximate range of weights that contains the middle 50% of the candy bars is between 54 g and 59 g."
