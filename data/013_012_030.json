    "message_1": "In the context of Stackelberg Competition, a company is trying to decide how many units of a new product to produce. They know that their competitor will observe their production decision and react accordingly. If the company produces x units, the competitor will produce 2x - 10 units. The demand function for the product is given by Q = 100 - 2P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price.\n\nWhat is the profit-maximizing quantity of units the company should produce and what will be the equilibrium price and profit for the company in this scenario?",
    "message_2": "To find the profit-maximizing quantity of units the company should produce, we first need to find the total quantity produced in the market (Q) and the price (P) as a function of x. \n\nSince the company produces x units and the competitor produces 2x - 10 units, the total quantity produced in the market is:\n\nQ = x + (2x - 10)\n\nQ = 3x - 10\n\nNow, we can use the demand function to find the price as a function of Q:\n\nQ = 100 - 2P\n\nSubstitute the expression for Q in terms of x:\n\n3x - 10 = 100 - 2P\n\nNow, solve for P:\n\n2P = 100 - 3x + 10\n\n2P = 110 - 3x\n\nP = (110 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the profit function for the company. Profit is given by the formula:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nAssuming the cost function is C(x), the revenue function is given by:\n\nRevenue = Price * Quantity\n\nR(x) = P * x\n\nR(x) = ((110 - 3x) / 2) * x\n\nNow, we need to find the profit function:\n\nProfit = R(x) - C(x)\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the first derivative of the profit function with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Profit)/dx = 0\n\nHowever, without knowing the cost function C(x), we cannot find the exact profit-maximizing quantity of units the company should produce, nor the equilibrium price and profit for the company in this scenario. If you can provide the cost function, we can proceed with the calculations."
