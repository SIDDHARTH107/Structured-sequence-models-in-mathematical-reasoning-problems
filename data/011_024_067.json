    "message_1": "A factory has three machines that produce three different products. Each machine has a production capacity of 500, 600, and 700 units per day, respectively. The demand for the first product is 400 units per day, for the second product is 500 units per day, and for the third product is 600 units per day. Assuming there are no transportation costs, what is the maximum number of units of each product that the factory can produce and satisfy the demand? Use the network flow algorithm to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the network flow algorithm, we need to create a network graph with nodes representing the machines, products, and a source and sink node. The capacities of the edges represent the production capacities and demand.\n\n1. Create a source node (S) and connect it to the three machines (M1, M2, M3) with edges representing their production capacities (500, 600, and 700 units per day, respectively).\n\n2. Create a sink node (T) and connect it to the three products (P1, P2, P3) with edges representing their demand (400, 500, and 600 units per day, respectively).\n\n3. Connect each machine to each product with infinite capacity edges, as each machine can produce any product.\n\nThe network graph will look like this:\n\n```\nS --500--> M1 --∞--> P1 --400--> T\n  \\        |          ^\n   \\       |          |\n    \\      ∞          500\n     \\     |          |\n      \\    v          |\n       600--> M2 --∞--> P2 --500--> T\n        \\    |          ^\n         \\   |          |\n          \\  ∞          600\n           \\ |          |\n            v v         |\n           M3 --∞--> P3 --600--> T\n```\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum flow in this network graph. We can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the maximum flow.\n\n1. Start with an initial flow of 0 in all edges.\n2. Find an augmenting path from S to T using DFS or BFS.\n3. Update the flow along the augmenting path.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nAfter applying the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, we find that the maximum flow in the network is 1500 units per day, which is equal to the total demand for all products.\n\nThe final flow in the network graph will look like this:\n\n```\nS --500--> M1 --400--> P1 --400--> T\n  \\        |          ^\n   \\       |          |\n    \\      100        500\n     \\     |          |\n      \\    v          |\n       600--> M2 --500--> P2 --500--> T\n        \\    |          ^\n         \\   |          |\n          \\  100        600\n           \\ |          |\n            v v         |\n           M3 --600--> P3 --600--> T\n```\n\nThe maximum number of units of each product that the factory can produce and satisfy the demand is:\n\n- Product 1: 400 units per day\n- Product 2: 500 units per day\n- Product 3: 600 units per day"
