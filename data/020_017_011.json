    "message_2": "To find the maximum possible area of a rectangle with a given perimeter, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.\n\nIn this case, the perimeter is 20 units, so we have:\n\n20 = 2l + 2w\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n10 = l + w\n\nNow, we want to maximize the area of the rectangle, which is given by the formula A = lw. To do this, we can use the fact that the maximum area of a rectangle with a fixed perimeter occurs when the rectangle is a square (i.e., when l = w).\n\nSo, if l = w, we can rewrite the simplified perimeter equation as:\n\n10 = l + l\n\n10 = 2l\n\nl = 5\n\nSince l = w, we also have w = 5. Now we can find the maximum possible area:\n\nA = lw\nA = (5)(5)\nA = 25 square units\n\nSo, the maximum possible area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 20 units is 25 square units."
