C_24 × C_3 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 24 and 3)\n4. C_12 × C_6 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 12 and 6)\n5. C_9 × C_8 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 9 and 8)\n6. C_9 × (C_4 × C_2) (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 9, 4, and 2)\n7. C_3 × C_4 × C_6 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3, 4, and 6)\n8. C_3 × (C_2 × C_4 × C_2) (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3, 2, 4, and 2)\n9. (C_3 × C_3) ⋊ C_8 (semidirect product of direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3 and 3 with cyclic group of order 8)\n10. (C_3 × C_3) ⋊ C_4 (semidirect product of direct product of cyclic groups of orders 3 and 3 with cyclic group of order 4)\n\nThese groups can be found using the Sylow theorems and considering the possible structures of the Sylow subgroups."
