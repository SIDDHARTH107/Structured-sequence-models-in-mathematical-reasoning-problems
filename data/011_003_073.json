    "message_2": "In Pascal's triangle, the value of a number in a specific row and column can be found using the combination formula: C(n-1, r-1), where n is the row number and r is the column number.\n\nFor the 7th row and 4th column, we have:\n\nC(7-1, 4-1) = C(6, 3)\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!)\n\nC(6, 3) = 720 / (6 * 6)\n\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nSo, the value of the number in the 7th row and 4th column of Pascal's triangle is 20."
