    "message_1": "A teacher is designing a seating arrangement for her class of 12 students at a circular table. She wants to ensure that no student sits next to the same student in consecutive days. How many days does the teacher have to plan the seating arrangement before a student sits next to the same student again?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use a concept in combinatorics called circular permutations. In a circular permutation, the number of ways to arrange n objects in a circle is (n-1)!. \n\nIn this case, we have 12 students, so there are (12-1)! = 11! ways to arrange the students around the circular table. However, we need to consider the constraint that no student sits next to the same student in consecutive days.\n\nLet's consider the first day's arrangement as a fixed reference point. For the second day, we need to make sure that no student has the same neighbors as the first day. We can achieve this by rotating the arrangement by 2 positions (clockwise or counterclockwise). This ensures that each student will have different neighbors on the second day.\n\nFor the third day, we can rotate the arrangement by 4 positions (clockwise or counterclockwise) from the first day's arrangement. This will again ensure that each student has different neighbors.\n\nWe can continue this process, rotating the arrangement by 2 positions each day. However, after 6 days, we would have rotated the arrangement by 12 positions (2 positions per day * 6 days), which brings us back to the original arrangement. So, the students will have the same neighbors again on the 7th day.\n\nTherefore, the teacher has to plan the seating arrangement for 6 days before a student sits next to the same student again."
