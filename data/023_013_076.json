Using Fourier transform, determine the temperature distribution on the plate at time t = 5 seconds if the plate dimensions are 1 meter by 2 meters and the thermal diffusivity of the plate material is 0.1 m²/s.",
    "message_2": "To determine the temperature distribution on the plate, we will use the two-dimensional heat equation with Fourier transform. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x, y, t) / ∂t = α(∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂x² + ∂²T(x, y, t) / ∂y²)\n\nwhere T(x, y, t) is the temperature distribution, α is the thermal diffusivity, and (x, y) are the spatial coordinates.\n\nWe will use the following boundary and initial conditions:\n\n1. T(x, y, 0) = 100°C (initial temperature)\n2. T(0, y, t) = T(1, y, t) = 20°C (boundary condition along the x-axis)\n3. T(x, 0, t) = T(x, 2, t) = 20°C (boundary condition along the y-axis)\n\nNow, we will apply the Fourier transform to the heat equation and boundary conditions. The Fourier transform of the heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(kx, ky, t) / ∂t = -α(kx² + ky²)T(kx, ky, t)\n\nwhere T(kx, ky, t) is the Fourier transform of T(x, y, t), and (kx, ky) are the wave numbers in the x and y directions.\n\nThe solution of this equation is given by:\n\nT(kx, ky, t) = T(kx, ky, 0) * exp(-α(kx² + ky²)t)\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of the initial temperature distribution:\n\nT(kx, ky, 0) = ∫∫T(x, y, 0) * exp(-i(kx * x + ky * y)) dx dy\n\nSince the initial temperature is 100°C, we have:\n\nT(kx, ky, 0) = 100 * ∫∫exp(-i(kx * x + ky * y)) dx dy\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of T(kx, ky, t) to get the temperature distribution T(x, y, t):\n\nT(x, y, t) = (1 / (2 * π)²) * ∫∫T(kx, ky, t) * exp(i(kx * x + ky * y)) dkx dky\n\nPlugging in the values for α = 0.1 m²/s and t = 5 seconds, we can evaluate the integral numerically to obtain the temperature distribution T(x, y, 5) on the plate at time t = 5 seconds.\n\nPlease note that the actual calculation of the integral requires numerical methods, which are beyond the scope of this text-based platform. However, you can use software like MATLAB or Python to perform the numerical calculations and obtain the temperature distribution."
