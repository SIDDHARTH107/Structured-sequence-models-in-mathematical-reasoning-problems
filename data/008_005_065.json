First, we'll write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n| 2  3  4 | 18 |\n| 4 -2  3 |  3 |\n| 3 -1  2 |  7 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows.\nTo do this, we can subtract 2 times the first row from the second row and 1.5 times the first row from the third row.\n\n|  2   3   4 |  18 |\n|  0  -8  -5 | -33 |\n|  0  -5.5 -4 | -20 |\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -8 to make the second element in the second row equal to 1.\n\n|  2    3    4  |  18  |\n|  0    1  5/8  | 33/8 |\n|  0 -5.5  -4   | -20  |\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the second element in the third row.\nTo do this, we can add 5.5 times the second row to the third row.\n\n|  2    3    4  |  18   |\n|  0    1  5/8  | 33/8  |\n|  0    0 -39/8 | -71/8 |\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by -39/8 to make the third element in the third row equal to 1.\n\n|  2    3    4  |  18  |\n|  0    1  5/8  | 33/8 |\n|  0    0    1  |  71/39 |\n\nStep 5: Back-substitute to find the values of x, y, and z.\nFrom the third row, we have z = 71/39.\n\nNow, substitute z into the second row to find y:\ny + 5/8 * (71/39) = 33/8\ny = 33/8 - 5/8 * (71/39)\ny = (33*39 - 5*71) / (8*39)\ny = (1287 - 355) / 312\ny = 932 / 312\ny = 233 / 78\n\nFinally, substitute y and z into the first row to find x:\n2x + 3 * (233/78) + 4 * (71/39) = 18\n2x = 18 - 3 * (233/78) - 4 * (71/39)\n2x = (18*78*39 - 3*233*39 - 4*71*78) / (78*39)\n2x = (50868 - 27261 - 22104) / 3042\n2x = 1503 / 3042\nx = 1503 / 6084\nx = 751 / 3042\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\nx = 751/3042\ny = 233/78\nz = 71/39"
