    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral area (a curved surface) and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is:\nArea = π * r^2\nwhere r is the radius.\n\nThe formula for the lateral area of a cone is:\nLateral Area = π * r * l\nwhere r is the radius and l is the slant height.\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 5 cm and the slant height (l) is 12 cm:\n\n1. Calculate the area of the base:\nArea = π * (5^2) = 25π cm^2\n\n2. Calculate the lateral area:\nLateral Area = π * 5 * 12 = 60π cm^2\n\n3. Add the base area and the lateral area to find the total surface area:\nSurface Area = 25π + 60π = 85π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cone is 85π cm^2 or approximately 267.04 cm^2."
