    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\", we first need to create a 5x5 Playfair square using the key.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: MATHS (no duplicates in this case)\n2. Fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J) in the order they appear: MATHSBCDEFGIKLNOPQRUVWXYZ\n\nNow, we have the 5x5 Playfair square:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNext, we need to encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the Playfair square:\n\n1. Break the message into digraphs (pairs of letters): HE LL O (since L is repeated, we don't need to add any filler letters)\n2. For each digraph, find the corresponding letters in the Playfair square and apply the encryption rules:\n\n- HE: H is in row 1, column 4 and E is in row 2, column 5. They are not in the same row or column, so we replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other corner of the rectangle they form: H -> S, E -> F. So, HE -> SF.\n- LL: L is in row 3, column 4. Since both letters are the same, we can't form a rectangle. In this case, we replace each letter with the one immediately to its right, wrapping around if necessary: L -> N, L -> N. So, LL -> NN.\n- O: Since we have only one letter left, we need to add a filler letter (usually 'X') to form a digraph: OX. O is in row 4, column 1 and X is in row 5, column 3. They are not in the same row or column, so we replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other corner of the rectangle they form: O -> P, X -> W. So, OX -> PW.\n\nThe encrypted message is: SFNNPW"
