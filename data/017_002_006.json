    "message_2": "To find all subgroups of G, we will first list all the elements of G. Since G is a cyclic group of order 6 generated by the element a, we have:\n\nG = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}\n\nwhere e is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's find the subgroups of G. We know that a subgroup must contain the identity element e and be closed under the group operation. We will consider the powers of a and find the subgroups generated by these powers.\n\n1. The subgroup generated by a^1:\n\nH1 = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5} = G\n\n2. The subgroup generated by a^2:\n\nH2 = {e, a^2, (a^2)^2, (a^2)^3, ...} = {e, a^2, a^4}\n\n3. The subgroup generated by a^3:\n\nH3 = {e, a^3, (a^3)^2, (a^3)^3, ...} = {e, a^3}\n\n4. The subgroup generated by a^4:\n\nH4 = {e, a^4, (a^4)^2, (a^4)^3, ...} = {e, a^4, a^2}\n\nNotice that H4 is the same as H2, so we don't need to consider it as a separate subgroup.\n\n5. The subgroup generated by a^5:\n\nH5 = {e, a^5, (a^5)^2, (a^5)^3, ...} = {e, a^5, a^4, a^3, a^2, a} = G\n\nNotice that H5 is the same as H1, so we don't need to consider it as a separate subgroup.\n\n6. The trivial subgroup:\n\nH6 = {e}\n\nNow, we have found all the subgroups of G:\n\nH1 = G = {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5}\nH2 = {e, a^2, a^4}\nH3 = {e, a^3}\nH6 = {e}\n\nTo show that every subgroup of G is cyclic, we need to show that each subgroup can be generated by a single element.\n\n1. H1 is generated by a.\n2. H2 is generated by a^2.\n3. H3 is generated by a^3.\n4. H6 is generated by e.\n\nThus, every subgroup of G is cyclic."
