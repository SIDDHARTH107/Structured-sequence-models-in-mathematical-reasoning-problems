    "message_2": "To find the divisor D of degree two with support {P, Q}, we need to find the coefficients m and n such that D = mP + nQ, where m and n are integers.\n\nFirst, let's find the point R = P + Q on the elliptic curve E. To do this, we will use the addition formula for elliptic curves. The slope λ between P and Q is given by:\n\nλ = (y_Q - y_P) / (x_Q - x_P)\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of P and Q, we get:\n\nλ = (6 - (-sqrt(5))) / (-4 - 0) = (6 + sqrt(5)) / (-4)\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of R using the following formulas:\n\nx_R = λ² - x_P - x_Q\ny_R = λ(x_P - x_R) - y_P\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nx_R = ((6 + sqrt(5)) / (-4))^2 - 0 - (-4) = 25/16 - 4 = 1/16\ny_R = (6 + sqrt(5)) / (-4) * (0 - 1/16) - (-sqrt(5)) = -5/4 - sqrt(5)\n\nSo, R = (1/16, -5/4 - sqrt(5)).\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients m and n such that D = mP + nQ. Since D is a divisor of degree two, we have m + n = 2. We also know that -R = P + Q, so we can write:\n\nD = 2R\n\nNow, we can find the point 2R using the doubling formula for elliptic curves. The slope λ' for doubling R is given by:\n\nλ' = (3x_R² + 2Ax_R + B) / (2y_R)\n\nPlugging in the values for x_R, y_R, A = 4, and B = -5, we get:\n\nλ' = (3(1/16)² + 2(4)(1/16) - 5) / (2(-5/4 - sqrt(5))) = (3/256 + 1/2 - 5) / (-5/2 - 2sqrt(5))\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of 2R using the following formulas:\n\nx_2R = λ'² - 2x_R\ny_2R = λ'(x_R - x_2R) - y_R\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nx_2R = ((3/256 + 1/2 - 5) / (-5/2 - 2sqrt(5)))^2 - 2(1/16) = 0\ny_2R = ((3/256 + 1/2 - 5) / (-5/2 - 2sqrt(5))) * (1/16 - 0) - (-5/4 - sqrt(5)) = sqrt(5)\n\nSo, 2R = (0, sqrt(5)). Since D = 2R, we have D = (0, sqrt(5)).\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients m and n such that D = mP + nQ. Since D is a divisor of degree two, we have m + n = 2. We also know that -R = P + Q, so we can write:\n\nD = 2R = mP + nQ\n\nSince D = (0, sqrt(5)), P = (0, -sqrt(5)), and Q = (-4, 6), we can write:\n\n(0, sqrt(5)) = m(0, -sqrt(5)) + n(-4, 6)\n\nComparing the x and y coordinates, we get:\n\n0 = -4n\nsqrt(5) = -m*sqrt(5) + 6n\n\nSolving the first equation, we get n = 0. Plugging this into the second equation, we get:\n\nsqrt(5) = -m*sqrt(5)\n\nDividing both sides by sqrt(5), we get m = -1.\n\nSo, the divisor D of degree two with support {P, Q} is given by:\n\nD = -1P + 0Q = -P"
