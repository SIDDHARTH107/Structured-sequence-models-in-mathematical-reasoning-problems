    "message_2": "To find the value of the 6th term in the 8th row of Pascal's triangle, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the row number (starting from 0), k is the term position (starting from 0), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 (since the 8th row is indexed as 7, starting from 0) and k = 5 (since the 6th term is indexed as 5, starting from 0).\n\nC(7, 5) = 7! / (5!(7-5)!)\nC(7, 5) = 7! / (5!2!)\nC(7, 5) = (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((5*4*3*2*1)*(2*1))\nC(7, 5) = (7*6) / (2*1)\nC(7, 5) = 42 / 2\nC(7, 5) = 21\n\nThe value of the 6th term in the 8th row of Pascal's triangle is 21."
