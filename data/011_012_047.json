    "message_1": "In a class of 40 students, 20 play basketball, 15 play football, and 10 play both sports. How many students in the class do not play either basketball or football?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of students who do not play either basketball or football, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe number of students who play at least one of the sports is the sum of the number of students who play basketball and the number of students who play football, minus the number of students who play both sports (since they are counted twice).\n\nNumber of students who play at least one sport = (Number of students who play basketball) + (Number of students who play football) - (Number of students who play both sports)\n\nNumber of students who play at least one sport = 20 + 15 - 10 = 25\n\nNow, to find the number of students who do not play either sport, subtract the number of students who play at least one sport from the total number of students in the class.\n\nNumber of students who do not play either sport = (Total number of students) - (Number of students who play at least one sport)\n\nNumber of students who do not play either sport = 40 - 25 = 15\n\nSo, 15 students in the class do not play either basketball or football."
