    "message_2": "To graph the inequality y > 2x - 5, first, we need to graph the line y = 2x - 5. This line has a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of -5. So, we can plot the y-intercept at the point (0, -5) and use the slope to find another point on the line. With a slope of 2, we can go up 2 units and to the right 1 unit from the y-intercept to find another point (1, -3). Now, we can draw a dashed line through these two points because the inequality is \"greater than\" and not \"greater than or equal to.\"\n\nNext, we need to shade the region above the line. This is the region where all the points have a y-coordinate greater than the y-coordinate on the line.\n\nNow, let's identify three points that are solutions to the inequality:\n\n1. (2, 0): If we plug in x = 2, we get y = 2(2) - 5 = -1. Since 0 > -1, this point is a solution.\n2. (0, 0): If we plug in x = 0, we get y = 2(0) - 5 = -5. Since 0 > -5, this point is a solution.\n3. (3, 3): If we plug in x = 3, we get y = 2(3) - 5 = 1. Since 3 > 1, this point is a solution.\n\nSo, the three points (2, 0), (0, 0), and (3, 3) are solutions to the inequality y > 2x - 5."
