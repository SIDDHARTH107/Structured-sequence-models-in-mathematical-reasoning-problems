    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, and its length increases with each iteration (order). However, it is important to note that the Peano curve is a fractal, and as such, its length approaches infinity as the order increases. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a finite length for the Peano curve of order 3 or any other order, as its length will always approach infinity."
