    "message_2": "To compute the Euler characteristic of the Morse-Smale complex, we need to count the number of critical points of each index and then apply the formula:\n\nEuler characteristic = (# of index 0 critical points) - (# of index 1 critical points) + (# of index 2 critical points)\n\nIn this case, we have critical points at $0.25$, $0.5$, and $0.75$. The index pairs given are $(0, 1)$ and $(1, 2)$. This means we have one critical point of index 0, one critical point of index 1, and one critical point of index 2.\n\nApplying the formula:\n\nEuler characteristic = (1) - (1) + (1) = 1\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of this Morse-Smale complex is 1."
