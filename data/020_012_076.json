    "message_1": "A company wants to produce rectangular boxes with a volume of 250 cubic meters. The length of each box must be twice its width, and the height must be 1 meter less than the width. What are the optimal dimensions of the box that will result in the minimum cost for producing the box, if the cost of material for the base is $10 per square meter, and for the sides it is $6 per square meter?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the width of the box as w, the length as l, and the height as h. We are given the following relationships:\n\n1. l = 2w\n2. h = w - 1\n3. lwh = 250\n\nWe can substitute the first two relationships into the third to get:\n\n(2w)(w)(w - 1) = 250\n\nNow we can simplify and solve for w:\n\n2w^3 - 2w^2 = 250\nw^3 - w^2 = 125\nw^2(w - 1) = 125\n\nNow we need to find the dimensions that minimize the cost. The cost function is given by the cost of the base plus the cost of the sides:\n\nCost = 10lw + 6(lh + wh)\n\nSubstitute the relationships for l and h:\n\nCost = 10(2w)w + 6(2w(w - 1) + w(w - 1))\nCost = 20w^2 + 6(2w^2 - 2w + w^2 - w)\nCost = 20w^2 + 6(3w^2 - 3w)\nCost = 20w^2 + 18w^2 - 18w\nCost = 38w^2 - 18w\n\nTo minimize the cost, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to w and setting it to zero:\n\nd(Cost)/dw = 76w - 18 = 0\n76w = 18\nw = 18/76 = 9/38\n\nNow we can find the dimensions of the box:\n\nl = 2w = 2(9/38) = 9/19\nh = w - 1 = (9/38) - 1 = -29/38\n\nHowever, we cannot have a negative height. This means that we have found a local maximum, not a minimum. To find the minimum cost, we need to consider the endpoints of the domain for w. Since the volume is 250 cubic meters, the smallest possible width is when the height is 0 (w = 1), and the largest possible width is when the length is equal to the width (w = 5).\n\nFor w = 1:\nl = 2(1) = 2\nh = 1 - 1 = 0\nCost = 10(2)(1) + 6(2(0) + 1(0)) = 20\n\nFor w = 5:\nl = 2(5) = 10\nh = 5 - 1 = 4\nCost = 10(10)(5) + 6(10(4) + 5(4)) = 500 + 6(40 + 20) = 500 + 360 = 860\n\nSince the cost is lower when w = 1, the optimal dimensions for the box are width = 1 meter, length = 2 meters, and height = 0 meters. However, this solution doesn't make sense in a practical context, as a box with a height of 0 meters cannot hold any volume.\n\nIn this case, it is best to choose the dimensions with the smallest cost that still allows for a box with a non-zero height. In this case, the dimensions are width = 5 meters, length = 10 meters, and height = 4 meters, with a cost of $860."
