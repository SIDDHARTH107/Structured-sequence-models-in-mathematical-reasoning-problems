    "message_2": "The Chua circuit is a nonlinear electronic circuit that exhibits chaotic behavior. To determine the maximum output voltage, we need to analyze the circuit's behavior over time. However, due to the chaotic nature of the Chua circuit, it is not possible to provide an exact analytical solution for the maximum output voltage.\n\nInstead, we can use numerical methods to simulate the circuit's behavior and estimate the maximum output voltage. This can be done using software tools like MATLAB or Python, which can solve the differential equations governing the Chua circuit's behavior.\n\nHere is a brief outline of the steps to simulate the Chua circuit and estimate the maximum output voltage:\n\n1. Define the Chua circuit's equations, which are given by:\n\n   dx/dt = α * (y - x - h(x))\n   dy/dt = x - y + z\n   dz/dt = -β * y\n\n   where h(x) is a piecewise-linear function representing the nonlinear resistor in the Chua circuit.\n\n2. Set the initial conditions x(0) = 0.1, y(0) = -0.1, and z(0) = 0.2.\n\n3. Set the circuit parameters R1 = 220 ohms, R2 = 1.2 kohms, C1 = 10 nF, C2 = 100 nF, and α = 15.6. Calculate β = 1/(R2*C2) and the breakpoints and slopes for the piecewise-linear function h(x).\n\n4. Use a numerical solver (e.g., Runge-Kutta method) to solve the differential equations for a sufficient amount of time to observe the circuit's behavior.\n\n5. Analyze the output voltage (y) over time and estimate the maximum value.\n\nPlease note that this process requires programming skills and knowledge of numerical methods to implement and analyze the results."
