    "message_2": "To find the points of intersection between the two curves, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n$y = x^3 - 2x^2 + 4$\n$y = 2x^2 - x + 6$\n\nUsing Bezout's theorem, we first need to find the degree of the two curves. The first curve is a cubic curve (degree 3) and the second curve is a quadratic curve (degree 2).\n\nNow, we can set the two equations equal to each other to find the points of intersection:\n\n$x^3 - 2x^2 + 4 = 2x^2 - x + 6$\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$x^3 - 4x^2 + x - 2 = 0$\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points between two curves is equal to the product of their degrees, assuming no common components and counting multiplicities. In this case, the product of the degrees is 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean that there are exactly 6 intersection points, as some of them might be at infinity or have complex coordinates. To find the actual number of intersection points, we need to solve the cubic equation:\n\n$x^3 - 4x^2 + x - 2 = 0$\n\nThis equation doesn't have an obvious rational root, so we can use numerical methods (like the Newton-Raphson method) or graphing to find the real roots. Upon doing so, we find that there are 3 real roots (intersection points) for this equation.\n\nSo, there are 3 points of intersection between the two curves in the XY-plane."
