    "message_1": "A principal is willing to pay a maximum of $100,000 to an agent to complete a project. The agent can either complete the project on time and earn a profit of $50,000 or delay the project by one week and earn a profit of $60,000. However, the principal will lose $20,000 for each week of delay. Assume that the probability of completing the project on time is 0.8, and the probability of delaying the project is 0.2. What should be the minimum payment from the principal to the agent that will incentivize the agent to complete the project on time, assuming that the agent is profit-maximizing?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the additional payment from the principal to the agent for completing the project on time. The agent's expected profit for completing the project on time would be $50,000 + x, and the expected profit for delaying the project by one week would be $60,000.\n\nTo incentivize the agent to complete the project on time, the expected profit for completing the project on time should be greater than or equal to the expected profit for delaying the project:\n\n50,000 + x >= 60,000\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\nx >= 10,000\n\nSo, the minimum additional payment from the principal to the agent that will incentivize the agent to complete the project on time is $10,000."
