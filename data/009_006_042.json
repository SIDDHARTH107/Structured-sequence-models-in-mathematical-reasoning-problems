If the initial concentration of reactant is 0.5 mol/L, what will be the concentration of the reactant after 10 minutes?",
    "message_2": "For a first-order reaction, the rate equation can be expressed as:\n\nrate = k[A]\n\nwhere rate is the reaction rate, k is the rate constant, and [A] is the concentration of the reactant.\n\nFor a first-order reaction, the integrated rate law is given by:\n\nln([A]t / [A]0) = -kt\n\nwhere [A]t is the concentration of the reactant at time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration of the reactant, k is the rate constant, and t is the time.\n\nWe are given the initial concentration [A]0 = 0.5 mol/L, the rate constant k = 0.03 min⁻¹, and the time t = 10 minutes. We need to find the concentration of the reactant after 10 minutes, [A]t.\n\nUsing the integrated rate law:\n\nln([A]t / 0.5) = -0.03 * 10\n\nln([A]t / 0.5) = -0.3\n\nNow, we can exponentiate both sides to get rid of the natural logarithm:\n\n[A]t / 0.5 = e^(-0.3)\n\n[A]t = 0.5 * e^(-0.3)\n\n[A]t ≈ 0.5 * 0.7408182\n\n[A]t ≈ 0.3704091 mol/L\n\nSo, the concentration of the reactant after 10 minutes will be approximately 0.3704 mol/L."
