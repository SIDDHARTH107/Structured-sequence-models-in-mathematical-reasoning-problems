Let's denote the chromatic polynomial as P(G, k), where G is the graph and k is the number of colors.\n\n1. First, consider the edge (1,2). We can delete it and contract it.\n   - Deletion: Remove the edge (1,2) from G. The remaining edges are {(1,3),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5)}. Let's call this graph G1.\n   - Contraction: Merge vertices 1 and 2 into a single vertex, say vertex 1'. The resulting graph has edges {(1',3),(3,4),(4,5)}. Let's call this graph G2.\n\n2. Now, we need to find the chromatic polynomial for G1 and G2.\n\nFor G1:\n- Delete the edge (1,3) and contract it.\n  - Deletion: Remove the edge (1,3) from G1. The remaining edges are {(2,3),(3,4),(4,5)}. Let's call this graph G1a.\n  - Contraction: Merge vertices 1 and 3 into a single vertex, say vertex 1''. The resulting graph has edges {(1'',2),(1'',4),(4,5)}. Let's call this graph G1b.\n\nFor G2:\n- Delete the edge (1',3) and contract it.\n  - Deletion: Remove the edge (1',3) from G2. The remaining edges are {(3,4),(4,5)}. Let's call this graph G2a.\n  - Contraction: Merge vertices 1' and 3 into a single vertex, say vertex 1'''. The resulting graph has edges {(1''',4),(4,5)}. Let's call this graph G2b.\n\n3. Now, we need to find the chromatic polynomial for G1a, G1b, G2a, and G2b.\n\nFor G1a: P(G1a, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) (since it's a path graph with 5 vertices)\nFor G1b: P(G1b, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2) (since it's a tree with one vertex of degree 3)\nFor G2a: P(G2a, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2 (since it's a path graph with 4 vertices)\nFor G2b: P(G2b, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) (since it's a path graph with 3 vertices)\n\n4. Now, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm to find the chromatic polynomial of G.\n\nP(G, k) = P(G1, k) - P(G2, k) = (P(G1a, k) - P(G1b, k)) - (P(G2a, k) - P(G2b, k))\n\nP(G, k) = (k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) - k(k-1)^2(k-2)) - (k(k-1)(k-2)^2 - k(k-1)(k-2))\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) - k(k-1)^2(k-2) - k(k-1)(k-2)^2 + k(k-1)(k-2)\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 5k + 6)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of G is P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 5k + 6)."
