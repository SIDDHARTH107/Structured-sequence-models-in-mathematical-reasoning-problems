    "message_2": "This Schrödinger equation is similar to the quantum harmonic oscillator, but with a small shift in the potential. To find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, we can use the ladder operator method, which is a standard technique for solving the quantum harmonic oscillator problem.\n\nFirst, let's define the ladder operators:\n\na = (1/√2)(x + d/dx)\na† = (1/√2)(x - d/dx)\n\nThe commutation relation between these operators is [a, a†] = aa† - a†a = 1.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the Schrödinger equation in terms of the ladder operators:\n\nHψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nwhere H = (1/2)(a†a + aa†) - 1/8.\n\nUsing the commutation relation, we can rewrite H as:\n\nH = a†a + 1/2 - 1/8 = a†a + 3/8.\n\nNow, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the case n = 2. We know that the ground state eigenfunction ψ_0(x) is annihilated by the lowering operator a:\n\naψ_0(x) = 0.\n\nThe first excited state eigenfunction ψ_1(x) can be found by applying the raising operator a† to the ground state:\n\nψ_1(x) = a†ψ_0(x).\n\nSimilarly, the second excited state eigenfunction ψ_2(x) can be found by applying the raising operator a† to the first excited state:\n\nψ_2(x) = a†ψ_1(x) = a†(a†ψ_0(x)) = (a†)^2ψ_0(x).\n\nNow, let's find the eigenvalue E_2. Using the Hamiltonian H, we have:\n\nE_2 = Hψ_2(x) = (a†a + 3/8)ψ_2(x) = (a†a + 3/8)(a†)^2ψ_0(x).\n\nSince a† and a commute with each other, we can rewrite this as:\n\nE_2 = (a†)^2(a†a)ψ_0(x) + (3/8)(a†)^2ψ_0(x).\n\nNow, we know that the ground state energy E_0 is given by:\n\nE_0 = (1/2 - 1/8) = 3/8.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nE_2 = 2E_0 + 3/8 = 2(3/8) + 3/8 = 9/8.\n\nThus, the eigenvalue E_2 is 9/8.\n\nFinally, to find the normalized eigenfunction ψ_2(x), we need to normalize (a†)^2ψ_0(x). Since the ground state eigenfunction ψ_0(x) is a Gaussian function, we have:\n\nψ_0(x) = (1/π)^(1/4) * exp(-x^2/2).\n\nApplying the raising operator (a†)^2 to ψ_0(x) and normalizing the result, we get:\n\nψ_2(x) = N * (x^2 - 1) * exp(-x^2/2),\n\nwhere N is the normalization constant. To find N, we need to satisfy the normalization condition:\n\n∫ |ψ_2(x)|^2 dx = 1.\n\nSolving for N, we get:\n\nN = (1/√(2π)) * (1/√3).\n\nThus, the normalized eigenfunction ψ_2(x) is:\n\nψ_2(x) = (1/√(6π)) * (x^2 - 1) * exp(-x^2/2)."
