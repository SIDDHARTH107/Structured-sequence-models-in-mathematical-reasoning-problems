    "message_1": "Suppose you have a set of five books with different numbers of pages. You want to select three books to read, one for each day of the long weekend. On the first day, you want to read the thickest book, on the second day you want to read the book with the fewest pages, and on the third day you want to read the book with the second-highest number of pages. How many different book combinations can you choose from?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. On the first day, you want to read the thickest book. Since there are 5 books with different numbers of pages, there is only 1 thickest book.\n2. On the second day, you want to read the book with the fewest pages. Again, since there are 5 books with different numbers of pages, there is only 1 book with the fewest pages.\n3. On the third day, you want to read the book with the second-highest number of pages. Out of the remaining 3 books, there is only 1 book with the second-highest number of pages.\n\nNow, let's find the number of different book combinations you can choose from. Since the thickest and the book with the fewest pages are fixed, the only choice you have is for the third day. There are 3 remaining books to choose from for the third day.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 different book combinations you can choose from."
