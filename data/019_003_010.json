    "message_1": "Unfortunately, I cannot provide a precise numerical problem for modal logic as it deals with abstract concepts and not numerical calculations. Modal logic is a type of formal logic that deals with modalities, which are words or phrases that indicate uncertainty or necessity such as possibility, necessity, and contingency. A typical question in modal logic would use symbols such as ⊢ or ⊨ to indicate entailment or truth values, and not numerical values.",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are discussing modal logic and its abstract nature. If you have any other mathematical problems or questions related to other areas of mathematics, feel free to ask, and I will be happy to help you with those."
