    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient, we need the actual data points for the age and height of the 50 students. The information provided only gives the range of ages and heights, which is not enough to calculate the correlation coefficient.\n\nThe correlation coefficient (denoted as 'r') measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a strong negative relationship, 1 indicates a strong positive relationship, and 0 indicates no relationship. \n\nPlease provide the actual data points for the age and height of the 50 students, and then we can calculate the correlation coefficient."
