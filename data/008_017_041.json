    "message_2": "First, let's represent the given system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |   X = | x |   B = |  4 |\n    | 4  5  6 |       | y |       |  7 |\n    | 7  8  9 |       | z |       | 10 |\n\nAX = B\n\nNow, let's represent the matrix A in sparse matrix format. Sparse matrix format is a way to store only non-zero elements of the matrix along with their row and column indices. In this case, however, the matrix A is not sparse, as it does not have any zero elements. So, the sparse matrix representation of A will be the same as the original matrix A.\n\nNow, let's solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method:\n\n1. First, we need to eliminate the elements below the pivot element (1) in the first column:\n\nR2 = R2 - 4 * R1\nR3 = R3 - 7 * R1\n\nA = | 1  2   3  |   B = |  4  |\n    | 0 -3  -6  |       | -9  |\n    | 0 -6 -12  |       | -18 |\n\n2. Next, we need to eliminate the elements below the pivot element (-3) in the second column:\n\nR3 = R3 - 2 * R2\n\nA = | 1  2   3  |   B = |  4  |\n    | 0 -3  -6  |       | -9  |\n    | 0  0   0  |       |  0  |\n\nAt this point, we can see that the third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 0, which is a dependent equation. So, we have an infinite number of solutions for this system of linear equations.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express z as a free variable, say z = t, and solve for x and y in terms of t:\n\nFrom the second equation: -3y - 6t = -9\ny = (9 - 6t) / 3\ny = 3 - 2t\n\nFrom the first equation: x + 2(3 - 2t) + 3t = 4\nx = 4 - 6 + 4t + 3t\nx = -2 + 7t\n\nSo, the general solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -2 + 7t\ny = 3 - 2t\nz = t\n\nwhere t is any real number."
