    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and two adjacent angles of 45° and 60°. Find the perimeter of the triangle using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the vertices of the triangle as A, B, and C, with A being the vertex where the 45° and 60° angles meet, B being the vertex opposite the 45° angle, and C being the vertex opposite the 60° angle. The base BC has a length of 10 cm.\n\nWe can use the Law of Sines to find the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. The Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides. In this case, we have:\n\nAB / sin(60°) = AC / sin(45°)\n\nWe know that sin(45°) = √2 / 2 and sin(60°) = √3 / 2. We also know that the length of the base BC is 10 cm. To find the length of side AB, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°:\n\n∠ABC = 180° - 45° - 60° = 75°\n\nNow we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of side AB:\n\nAB / sin(60°) = BC / sin(75°)\n\nAB / (√3 / 2) = 10 / (sin(75°))\n\nAB = 10 * (√3 / 2) / sin(75°)\n\nNow we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of side AC:\n\nAC / sin(45°) = BC / sin(75°)\n\nAC / (√2 / 2) = 10 / sin(75°)\n\nAC = 10 * (√2 / 2) / sin(75°)\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of the three sides:\n\nPerimeter = AB + AC + BC\n\nPerimeter = (10 * (√3 / 2) / sin(75°)) + (10 * (√2 / 2) / sin(75°)) + 10\n\nTo find the exact value of the perimeter, we can use a calculator to find the values of sin(75°):\n\nsin(75°) ≈ 0.9659\n\nPerimeter ≈ (10 * (√3 / 2) / 0.9659) + (10 * (√2 / 2) / 0.9659) + 10\n\nPerimeter ≈ (8.6603 / 0.9659) + (7.0711 / 0.9659) + 10\n\nPerimeter ≈ 8.9615 + 7.3205 + 10\n\nPerimeter ≈ 26.282 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is approximately 26.282 cm."
