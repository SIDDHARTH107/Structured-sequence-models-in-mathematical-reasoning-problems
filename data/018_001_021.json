    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set is a subset of set A, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element in set A.\n\nLet's denote the empty set as ∅. By definition, the empty set contains no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A. \n\nSince there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A, it follows that every element in the empty set is also an element in set A. Thus, we can conclude that the empty set ∅ is a subset of set A, regardless of the number of elements in set A."
