    "message_2": "The quotient rule states that if you have a function f(x) = g(x) / h(x), then the derivative f'(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (g'(x) * h(x) - g(x) * h'(x)) / (h(x))^2\n\nIn this case, we have g(x) = 4x^2 - x and h(x) = 2x - 1. First, we need to find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x):\n\ng'(x) = d(4x^2 - x)/dx = 8x - 1\nh'(x) = d(2x - 1)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = ((8x - 1)(2x - 1) - (4x^2 - x)(2)) / (2x - 1)^2\n\nf'(x) = (16x^2 - 8x - 2x + 1 - 8x^2 + 2x) / (4x^2 - 4x + 1)\n\nf'(x) = (8x^2 - 8x + 1) / (4x^2 - 4x + 1)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (4x^2 - x) / (2x - 1) is:\n\nf'(x) = (8x^2 - 8x + 1) / (4x^2 - 4x + 1)"
