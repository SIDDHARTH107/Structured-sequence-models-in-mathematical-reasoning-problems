If the length of each side of the initial equilateral triangle is 1, and the number of iterations is 4, what is the total length of the curve?",
    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that is generated by replacing each straight line segment with a series of smaller segments following a specific pattern. In each iteration, the length of each segment is scaled by a factor of √(7)/2, and the number of segments increases by a factor of 7.\n\nLet's denote the length of each side of the initial equilateral triangle as L0 = 1. After the first iteration, the length of the curve will be L1 = 7 * (L0 * √(7)/2). After the second iteration, the length of the curve will be L2 = 7 * (L1 * √(7)/2), and so on.\n\nTo find the total length of the curve after 4 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nL4 = 7^4 * (L0 * (√(7)/2)^4)\n\nL4 = 2401 * (1 * (7/2)^4)\n\nL4 = 2401 * (1 * (16807/16))\n\nL4 = 2401 * (16807/16)\n\nL4 ≈ 2521.9375\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve after 4 iterations is approximately 2521.9375."
