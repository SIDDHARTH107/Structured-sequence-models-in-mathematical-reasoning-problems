    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 3, 4, 5} be two sets. Find the symmetric difference of A and B and the intersection of A and B. Using the symmetric difference of A and B, and the intersection of A and B, prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference A Δ B:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4} = {1, 5}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection. Let's denote another set C. We need to prove that:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) Δ (B ∩ C)\n\nLet's break down the left side of the equation:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ C = ({1, 5} ∩ C)\n\nNow, let's break down the right side of the equation:\n\n(A ∩ C) Δ (B ∩ C) = ({1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ C) Δ ({2, 3, 4, 5} ∩ C)\n\nNow, let's analyze the elements in the sets:\n\n1. If an element is in A ∩ C and B ∩ C, then it is in both A and B, so it cannot be in A Δ B. Therefore, it cannot be in (A Δ B) ∩ C.\n2. If an element is in A ∩ C but not in B ∩ C, then it is in A but not in B, so it is in A Δ B. Therefore, it is in (A Δ B) ∩ C.\n3. If an element is in B ∩ C but not in A ∩ C, then it is in B but not in A, so it is in A Δ B. Therefore, it is in (A Δ B) ∩ C.\n4. If an element is not in A ∩ C and not in B ∩ C, then it cannot be in (A Δ B) ∩ C.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that:\n\n(A Δ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) Δ (B ∩ C)\n\nThus, we have proved that the symmetric difference of two sets is distributive over intersection."
