    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 6 cm and a minor radius of 3 cm. What is the volume of the torus in cubic centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2π * major_radius)\n\nwhere minor_radius is the radius of the circular cross-section of the torus (in this case, 3 cm) and major_radius is the distance from the center of the circular cross-section to the center of the torus (in this case, 6 cm).\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nVolume = (π * 3^2) * (2π * 6)\nVolume = (π * 9) * (12π)\nVolume = 108π^2\n\nTherefore, the volume of the torus is approximately 108π^2 cubic centimeters, or approximately 3392.92 cubic centimeters."
