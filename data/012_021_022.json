    "message_2": "To determine the treewidth of a graph G with 10 vertices and 15 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the average degree of the graph.\n2. Use the average degree to estimate the treewidth.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the average degree of the graph\nThe average degree of a graph is given by the formula:\n\nAverage degree = (2 * number of edges) / number of vertices\n\nIn this case, the number of edges is 15 and the number of vertices is 10. So, the average degree is:\n\nAverage degree = (2 * 15) / 10 = 30 / 10 = 3\n\nStep 2: Estimate the treewidth\nThe treewidth of a graph is related to its average degree. In general, graphs with a higher average degree tend to have a higher treewidth. For a graph with an average degree of 3, we can estimate its treewidth to be around 2 or 3.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific structure of the graph, it is impossible to determine the exact treewidth. The treewidth can vary depending on how the vertices and edges are connected. In some cases, the treewidth could be lower or higher than the estimated value."
