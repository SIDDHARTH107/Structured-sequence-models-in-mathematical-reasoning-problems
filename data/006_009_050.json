    "message_1": "Suppose the prevalence of a certain medical condition in a population is 0.02. If a random sample of 500 people is taken from the population, what is the probability that at least 10 of them have the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "We can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, people with the medical condition) in n trials (the sample size)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the prevalence of the medical condition, 0.02)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the sample size, 500)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of people with the medical condition)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 10 people have the medical condition, so we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 10, 11, 12, ..., 500.\n\nHowever, it's easier to find the probability that fewer than 10 people have the medical condition and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least 10 people having the condition.\n\nSo, we'll find the sum of the probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 9:\n\nP(X < 10) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 9\n\nP(at least 10) = 1 - P(X < 10)\n\nLet's calculate P(X < 10):\n\nP(X < 10) = Σ C(500, k) * (0.02)^k * (0.98)^(500-k) for k = 0 to 9\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nP(X < 10) ≈ 0.0668\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 10 people having the medical condition:\n\nP(at least 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - 0.0668 ≈ 0.9332\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 people in the sample of 500 have the medical condition is approximately 0.9332, or 93.32%."
