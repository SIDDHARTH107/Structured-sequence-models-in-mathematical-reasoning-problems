    "message_2": "The given sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. To find the next term using the principle of mathematical induction, we can first establish a formula for the nth term of the sequence.\n\nLet's denote the nth term as T(n). Since the common difference is 2, we can express the sequence as:\n\nT(n) = 2n - 1\n\nNow, we can verify the formula for the first 5 terms:\n\nT(1) = 2(1) - 1 = 1\nT(2) = 2(2) - 1 = 3\nT(3) = 2(3) - 1 = 5\nT(4) = 2(4) - 1 = 7\nT(5) = 2(5) - 1 = 9\n\nThe formula holds true for the first 5 terms. Now, we can use the formula to find the next term:\n\nT(6) = 2(6) - 1 = 11\n\nSo, the next term of the sequence is 11."
