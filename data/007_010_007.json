When divided by 5, the remainder is 1.\n2. When divided by 7, the remainder is 3.\n\nWhat is the smallest positive integer that satisfies these conditions using the Chinese remainder theorem?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we first need to find the modular inverses. Let x be the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions. Then, we can write the following congruences:\n\nx ≡ 1 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nNow, let's use the Chinese remainder theorem. We have:\n\nM = 5 * 7 = 35\n\nNext, we need to find M1 and M2, where M1 = M/5 and M2 = M/7:\n\nM1 = 35 / 5 = 7\nM2 = 35 / 7 = 5\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses y1 and y2 such that:\n\ny1 ≡ M1^(-1) (mod 5)\ny2 ≡ M2^(-1) (mod 7)\n\nWe can find the modular inverses by trial and error:\n\nFor y1:\n7 * 1 ≡ 7 ≢ 1 (mod 5)\n7 * 2 ≡ 14 ≡ 4 (mod 5)\n7 * 3 ≡ 21 ≡ 1 (mod 5) => y1 = 3\n\nFor y2:\n5 * 1 ≡ 5 ≢ 1 (mod 7)\n5 * 2 ≡ 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n5 * 3 ≡ 15 ≡ 1 (mod 7) => y2 = 3\n\nNow, we can find x using the formula:\n\nx = (a1 * M1 * y1) + (a2 * M2 * y2) (mod M)\n\nwhere a1 and a2 are the remainders when divided by 5 and 7, respectively:\n\nx = (1 * 7 * 3) + (3 * 5 * 3) (mod 35)\nx = (21) + (45) (mod 35)\nx = 66 (mod 35)\nx ≡ 31 (mod 35)\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is x = 31."
