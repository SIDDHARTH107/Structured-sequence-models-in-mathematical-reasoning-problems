    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z - 1), we first look for the points where the denominator is zero. In this case, the denominator is zero when z = 1. So, we have one potential singularity at z = 1.\n\nNow, let's try to simplify the function by factoring the numerator:\n\nz^3 - 1 = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)\n\nSo, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z - 1) = [(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)]/(z - 1)\n\nWe can cancel out the (z - 1) terms:\n\nf(z) = z^2 + z + 1\n\nNow, we have a new function that is defined at z = 1. Since the original function f(z) can be simplified to a function that is defined at the potential singularity, the singularity at z = 1 is removable.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z - 1) has one removable singularity at z = 1. There are no poles or essential singularities."
