Find the Fourier series of this function.\n\nThe math student would need to use the formulas and techniques related to Fourier analysis to determine the coefficients of the Fourier series for this particular function, taking into account the periodic discontinuity in the interval (0, π).",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx))\n\nwhere the summation is from n=1 to infinity.\n\nWe can find a_0, a_n, and b_n using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)]dx over the interval (-π, π)\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx)]dx over the interval (-π, π)\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx)]dx over the interval (-π, π)\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫(2)dx from -π to 0 + ∫(-1)dx from 0 to π]\na_0 = (1/π) * [2x|(-π, 0) - x|(0, π)]\na_0 = (1/π) * [2(0) - 2(-π) - (π - 0)]\na_0 = (1/π) * (2π - π)\na_0 = 1\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫(2 * cos(nx))dx from -π to 0 + ∫(-1 * cos(nx))dx from 0 to π]\na_n = (1/π) * [(2/n) * sin(nx)|(-π, 0) - (1/n) * sin(nx)|(0, π)]\na_n = (1/π) * [(2/n) * (sin(0) - sin(-nπ)) - (1/n) * (sin(nπ) - sin(0))]\na_n = (1/π) * [(2/n) * 0 - (1/n) * 0]\na_n = 0\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(2 * sin(nx))dx from -π to 0 + ∫(-1 * sin(nx))dx from 0 to π]\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-2/n) * cos(nx)|(-π, 0) + (1/n) * cos(nx)|(0, π)]\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-2/n) * (cos(0) - cos(-nπ)) + (1/n) * (cos(nπ) - cos(0))]\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-2/n) * (1 - (-1)^n) + (1/n) * ((-1)^n - 1)]\n\nFor n = odd, b_n = (1/π) * [(-2/n) * (1 - (-1)) + (1/n) * ((-1) - 1)] = (1/π) * [(-2/n) * 2 + (1/n) * (-2)] = -4/nπ\nFor n = even, b_n = 0\n\nNow we can write the Fourier series for the given function:\n\nf(x) = 1/2 + Σ((-1)^((n-1)/2) * (4/nπ) * sin(nx)) for n odd, and 0 for n even\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given function with a periodic discontinuity."
