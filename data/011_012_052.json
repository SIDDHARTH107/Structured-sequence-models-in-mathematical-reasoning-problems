    "message_2": "Let's consider the two people who refuse to serve together as A and B. We can divide the problem into two cases:\n\nCase 1: A is on the committee, and B is not.\nIn this case, we need to choose 4 more people from the remaining 6 people (excluding B). This can be done in 6 choose 4 ways, which is C(6, 4) = 15 ways.\n\nCase 2: B is on the committee, and A is not.\nSimilarly, we need to choose 4 more people from the remaining 6 people (excluding A). This can also be done in 6 choose 4 ways, which is C(6, 4) = 15 ways.\n\nNow, we need to add the possibilities from both cases to get the total number of different committees that can be formed:\n\nTotal committees = Case 1 + Case 2 = 15 + 15 = 30 different committees."
