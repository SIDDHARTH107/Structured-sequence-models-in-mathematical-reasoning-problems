    "message_2": "To write a differential equation that describes the population growth, we can use the formula for exponential growth:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere dP/dt is the rate of change of the population, k is the growth rate, and P is the population at a given time t.\n\nIn this problem, the growth rate k is given as 3% per year, which can be written as 0.03. So, the differential equation becomes:\n\ndP/dt = 0.03P\n\nNow, we need to determine how long it will take for the population to double in size. Let P0 be the initial population (10,000) and P1 be the doubled population (20,000). We want to find the time t when P1 = 2P0.\n\nTo solve this, we can first separate the variables and integrate:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫0.03 dt\n\nln(P) = 0.03t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition P(0) = P0:\n\nln(P0) = 0.03(0) + C\nC = ln(P0)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln(P) = 0.03t + ln(P0)\n\nTo find the time t when the population doubles, we can plug in P1 = 2P0:\n\nln(2P0) = 0.03t + ln(P0)\n\nUsing the logarithmic property ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), we can simplify the equation:\n\nln(2) = 0.03t\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt = ln(2) / 0.03 ≈ 23.1 years\n\nSo, it will take approximately 23.1 years for the population to double in size."
