    "message_1": "A company produces two products A and B. The profit per unit of product A is $20, and the profit per unit of product B is $30. Each product requires two types of resources, resource X and resource Y. Product A requires 2 units of resource X and 3 units of resource Y, while product B requires 3 units of resource X and 2 units of resource Y. The company has 50 units of resource X and 60 units of resource Y. What is the optimal number of units of products A and B the company should produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let's use linear programming to solve this problem. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 20x + 30y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 50 (resource X constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 60 (resource Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product A)\ny ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for product B)\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 50\n   y ≤ (50 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. 3x + 2y ≤ 60\n   y ≤ (60 - 3x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 20), (15, 10), and (20, 0).\n\nNow we need to evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 20) = 20(0) + 30(20) = $600\n3. P(15, 10) = 20(15) + 30(10) = $600\n4. P(20, 0) = 20(20) + 30(0) = $400\n\nThe maximum profit is $600, which can be achieved by producing either 0 units of product A and 20 units of product B or 15 units of product A and 10 units of product B."
