    "message_2": "The empty set, denoted by ∅ or {}, is the subset of A that contains no elements. To prove that the empty set is a subset of set A using set theoretic symbols, we can use the definition of a subset.\n\nA set B is a subset of set A, denoted by B ⊆ A, if and only if every element of B is also an element of A. In other words, for all x, if x ∈ B, then x ∈ A.\n\nNow, let's consider the empty set ∅. By definition, the empty set has no elements. Therefore, there is no x such that x ∈ ∅. This means that the condition \"if x ∈ ∅, then x ∈ A\" is vacuously true, as there is no x for which the condition needs to be checked.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the empty set is a subset of set A, or symbolically, ∅ ⊆ A."
