    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the square wave signal, we need to compute the coefficients a_n and b_n for the trigonometric Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nωx) + b_n * sin(nωx)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π/T, T is the period of the signal, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor a square wave with a duty cycle of 40%, the waveform is positive for 40% of the period and negative for the remaining 60%. Since the waveform is odd, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to compute the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe b_n coefficients are given by:\n\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫ f(x) * sin(nωx) dx, where the integral is taken over one period.\n\nFor the given square wave, the period T = 2π, and the amplitude is 5. The waveform is positive from -π/2 to π/2 and negative from π/2 to 3π/2. Therefore, we can compute b_n as follows:\n\nb_n = (2/2π) * [∫(5 * sin(nωx) dx) from -π/2 to π/2 - ∫(5 * sin(nωx) dx) from π/2 to 3π/2]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(5 * sin(nωx) dx) from -π/2 to π/2 - ∫(5 * sin(nωx) dx) from π/2 to 3π/2]\n\nNow, we can integrate sin(nωx) with respect to x:\n\n∫(sin(nωx) dx) = -(1/nω) * cos(nωx)\n\nSo, the b_n coefficients become:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-5/nω) * (cos(nωπ/2) - cos(-nωπ/2)) - (-5/nω) * (cos(nω3π/2) - cos(nωπ/2))]\n\nSince ω = 2π/T = 2π/(2π) = 1, we have:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-5/n) * (cos(nπ/2) - cos(-nπ/2)) - (-5/n) * (cos(n3π/2) - cos(nπ/2))]\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier series up to the third harmonic (n = 1, 2, 3):\n\nb_1 = (1/π) * [(-5) * (cos(π/2) - cos(-π/2)) - (-5) * (cos(3π/2) - cos(π/2))]\nb_2 = (1/π) * [(-5/2) * (cos(π) - cos(-π)) - (-5/2) * (cos(3π) - cos(π))]\nb_3 = (1/π) * [(-5/3) * (cos(3π/2) - cos(-3π/2)) - (-5/3) * (cos(9π/2) - cos(3π/2))]\n\nEvaluating these expressions, we get:\n\nb_1 = (10/π)\nb_2 = 0\nb_3 = (10/3π)\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the signal up to the third harmonic is:\n\nf(x) = (10/π) * sin(x) + (10/3π) * sin(3x)"
