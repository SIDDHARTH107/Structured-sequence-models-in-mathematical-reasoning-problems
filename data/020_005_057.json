The production time and profit for each product are given below:\n\n| Product | Machine A (mins) | Machine B (mins) | Profit ($) |\n|---------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|\n| 1       | 4               | 6               | 8          |\n| 2       | 5               | 4               | 9          |\n| 3       | 7               | 3               | 7          |\n\nThe company has 22 hours available on machine A and 18 hours available on machine B. The company wants to determine the optimal product mix to maximize their profit.\n\nFormulate the problem as an integer programming problem and solve it.",
    "message_2": "To formulate this problem as an integer programming problem, we will use the following variables:\n\nLet x1, x2, and x3 represent the number of units produced for products 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit):\nMaximize P = 8x1 + 9x2 + 7x3\n\nConstraints (production time on machines A and B):\n4x1 + 5x2 + 7x3 <= 22 * 60 (Machine A time constraint, converted to minutes)\n6x1 + 4x2 + 3x3 <= 18 * 60 (Machine B time constraint, converted to minutes)\n\nNon-negativity and integer constraints:\nx1, x2, x3 >= 0 and integer values\n\nNow, we can solve this integer programming problem using an optimization solver or software. The optimal solution is:\n\nx1 = 120 (Product 1)\nx2 = 60 (Product 2)\nx3 = 0 (Product 3)\n\nThe maximum profit is P = 8(120) + 9(60) + 7(0) = $1,800."
