    "message_2": "A group of order 17 is a cyclic group, since 17 is a prime number. In a cyclic group of order 17, any element other than the identity element can be a generator. Let's denote the group as G and the generator as g. Then, the elements of the group can be represented as {e, g, g^2, g^3, ..., g^16}, where e is the identity element and g^i denotes the i-th power of the generator.\n\nSo, there is no unique generator for a group of order 17. Any element other than the identity element can serve as a generator."
