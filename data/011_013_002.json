    "message_2": "Polya's enumeration theorem is a combinatorial method used to count the number of distinct colorings of an object under a given group of symmetries. In this case, we want to count the number of distinct colorings of a cube with 4 red faces and 2 blue faces, up to rotation.\n\nThe cube has 24 rotational symmetries, which form the symmetry group of the cube. We can partition these symmetries into 5 conjugacy classes:\n\n1. Identity (1 rotation)\n2. 90-degree rotations about a face-centered axis (6 rotations)\n3. 180-degree rotations about a face-centered axis (3 rotations)\n4. 120-degree rotations about a vertex-centered axis (8 rotations)\n5. 180-degree rotations about an edge-centered axis (6 rotations)\n\nNow, we apply Polya's enumeration theorem. We need to compute the cycle index polynomial for the symmetry group of the cube. The cycle index polynomial is given by:\n\nP(G) = (1/|G|) * Î£ (p(g) * g)\n\nwhere G is the symmetry group, |G| is the order of the group, p(g) is the cycle structure of the permutation g, and the sum is taken over all elements g in G.\n\nFor each conjugacy class, we compute the cycle structure and multiply it by the size of the conjugacy class:\n\n1. Identity: (1^6) * 1 = 1\n2. 90-degree face rotations: (1^2 * 4^1) * 6 = 24\n3. 180-degree face rotations: (2^3) * 3 = 24\n4. 120-degree vertex rotations: (1^2 * 3^2) * 8 = 72\n5. 180-degree edge rotations: (1^2 * 2^2) * 6 = 24\n\nNow, we sum these values and divide by the order of the group (24):\n\nP(G) = (1/24) * (1 + 24 + 24 + 72 + 24) = (1/24) * 145\n\nNow, we substitute the number of colors (2) into the cycle index polynomial:\n\nP(G; 2) = (1/24) * (2^6 + 24 * 2^2 * 2^1 + 24 * 2^3 + 72 * 2^2 * 2^2 + 24 * 2^2 * 2^2) = (1/24) * 384\n\nFinally, we want to count the number of colorings with 4 red faces and 2 blue faces. We can do this using the chromatic polynomial:\n\nP(G; 4 red, 2 blue) = C(6, 4) * P(G; 2) = 15 * (1/24) * 384 = 240\n\nSo, there are 240 distinct ways to color the faces of a cube with 4 red faces and 2 blue faces, up to rotation."
