    "message_1": "A company has 10 employees, and they want to form 3 committees of 3, 4, and 3 employees each. In how many ways can they select the committees if one specific employee must be on each committee?",
    "message_2": "Let's call the specific employee E. Since E must be on each committee, we will first place E on each committee and then count the number of ways to select the remaining employees for each committee.\n\nAfter placing E on each committee, we now have:\n\n- Committee 1: E and 2 more employees needed (out of the remaining 9)\n- Committee 2: E and 3 more employees needed (out of the remaining 9)\n- Committee 3: E and 2 more employees needed (out of the remaining 9)\n\nNow, we will use combinations to determine the number of ways to select the remaining employees for each committee.\n\nFor Committee 1, we need to choose 2 employees out of the remaining 9. This can be done in C(9,2) ways, where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.\n\nC(9,2) = 9! / (2! * (9-2)!) = 36\n\nFor Committee 2, we need to choose 3 employees out of the remaining 9 (excluding E). This can be done in C(9,3) ways.\n\nC(9,3) = 9! / (3! * (9-3)!) = 84\n\nFor Committee 3, we need to choose 2 employees out of the remaining 6 (excluding E and the 3 employees already chosen for Committee 2). This can be done in C(6,2) ways.\n\nC(6,2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways to select employees for each committee to get the total number of ways to form the committees with E on each committee:\n\nTotal ways = 36 * 84 * 15 = 45360\n\nSo, there are 45,360 ways to select the committees with one specific employee on each committee."
