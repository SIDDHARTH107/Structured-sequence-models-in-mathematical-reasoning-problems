    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we sort the edges by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. (3, 4): 1\n2. (6, 7): 1\n3. (1, 2): 2\n4. (5, 6): 3\n5. (0, 1): 4\n6. (1, 7): 4\n7. (2, 3): 5\n8. (4, 5): 5\n9. (7, 0): 7\n10. (0, 6): 8\n\nNow, we add edges to the MST while making sure not to form any cycles:\n\n1. Add (3, 4): MST = {(3, 4)}, weight = 1\n2. Add (6, 7): MST = {(3, 4), (6, 7)}, weight = 2\n3. Add (1, 2): MST = {(3, 4), (6, 7), (1, 2)}, weight = 4\n4.

Add (1, 7): MST = {(3, 4), (6, 7), (1, 2), (5, 6), (0, 1), (1, 7)}, weight = 15\n\nAt this point, we have a connected graph that spans all 8 vertices, so we have found the minimum spanning tree.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is {(3, 4), (6, 7), (1, 2), (5, 6), (0, 1), (1, 7)} with a total weight of 15."
