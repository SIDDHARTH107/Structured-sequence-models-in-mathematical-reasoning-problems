    "message_2": "To solve the given Schrödinger equation using complex analysis methods, we can use the technique of transforming the equation into a more tractable form by introducing a new function and variable. Let's introduce a new function, $\\phi(z)$, and a new variable, $z$, defined as:\n\n$$\\psi(x) = e^{-\\frac{1}{2}x^2} \\phi(z)$$\n$$z = x^2$$\n\nNow, let's compute the first and second derivatives of $\\psi(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\\frac{d\\psi}{dx} = e^{-\\frac{1}{2}x^2} \\left(-x\\phi(z) + 2x\\frac{d\\phi}{dz}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = e^{-\\frac{1}{2}x^2} \\left((x^2 - 1)\\phi(z) + 4x^2\\frac{d\\phi}{dz} + 4x^2\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dz^2}\\right)$$\n\nNow, substitute these derivatives back into the original Schrödinger equation:\n\n$$e^{-\\frac{1}{2}x^2} \\left((x^2 - 1)\\phi(z) + 4x^2\\frac{d\\phi}{dz} + 4x^2\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dz^2}\\right) + (3-x^2)e^{-\\frac{1}{2}x^2}\\phi(z) = 0$$\n\nSince $e^{-\\frac{1}{2}x^2}$ is never zero, we can divide both sides by it:\n\n$$(x^2 - 1)\\phi(z) + 4x^2\\frac{d\\phi}{dz} + 4x^2\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dz^2} + (3-x^2)\\phi(z) = 0$$\n\nNow, substitute $z = x^2$:\n\n$$(z - 1)\\phi(z) + 4z\\frac{d\\phi}{dz} + 4z\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dz^2} + (3-z)\\phi(z) = 0$$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$$4z\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dz^2} + 4z\\frac{d\\phi}{dz} + (2z - 4)\\phi(z) = 0$$\n\nNow, we have a second-order linear differential equation with variable coefficients. This equation is known as the associated Legendre equation, and its solutions are the associated Legendre functions, $P_l^m(z)$ and $Q_l^m(z)$, where $l$ and $m$ are integers. The general solution for $\\phi(z)$ is given by:\n\n$$\\phi(z) = A P_l^m(z) + B Q_l^m(z)$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants. Finally, we can write the general solution for the original Schrödinger equation as:\n\n$$\\psi(x) = e^{-\\frac{1}{2}x^2} \\left(A P_l^m(x^2) + B Q_l^m(x^2)\\right)$$"
