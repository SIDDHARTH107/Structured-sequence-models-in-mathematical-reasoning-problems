    "message_2": "To find the price of the shirt after the discount is applied, we first need to calculate the amount of the discount. \n\nThe discount is 10% of the original price, which is $30. To find 10% of $30, we can multiply 30 by 0.10:\n\n$30 * 0.10 = $3\n\nNow, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:\n\n$30 - $3 = $27\n\nSo, the customer will pay $27 for the shirt after the discount is applied."
