    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 987,654,321 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) = (x^2 + 1) % N, where N is the number we want to factor (987,654,321 in this case).\n2. Choose two initial values for x and y, usually x = y = 2.\n3. Iterate the function for x and y, updating the values as follows:\n   x = f(x)\n   y = f(f(y))\n4. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between x and y, and N: gcd(abs(x - y), N).\n5. If the GCD is 1, continue iterating. If the GCD is equal to N, the algorithm failed. If the GCD is between 1 and N, we found a non-trivial factor.\n\nLet's perform the algorithm:\n\n1. f(x) = (x^2 + 1) % 987,654,321\n2. x = y = 2\n\nIteration 1:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) % 987,654,321 = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) % 987,654,321 = 26\ngcd(abs(5 - 26), 987,654,321) = gcd(21, 987,654,321) = 1 (continue)\n\nIteration 2:\nx = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) % 987,654,321 = 26\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) % 987,654,321 = 458330\ngcd(abs(26 - 458330), 987,654,321) = gcd(458304, 987,654,321) = 1 (continue)\n\nIteration 3:\nx = f(x) = (26^2 + 1) % 987,654,321 = 677\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(458330)) = f(511620) = (511620^2 + 1) % 987,654,321 = 91476794\ngcd(abs(677 - 91476794), 987,654,321) = gcd(91476067, 987,654,321) = 3 (found a non-trivial factor)\n\nThe smallest prime factor of 987,654,321 using Pollard's rho algorithm is 3."
