    "message_1": "A researcher wants to compare the reading speed of two groups A and B. A sample of 8 individuals is taken from group A, and another sample of 12 individuals is taken from group B. The reading speed of each individual is measured in words per minute. The researcher wants to know if there is a significant difference in the reading speed of the two groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The following are the reading speeds in words per minute for the two groups:\n\nGroup A: 230, 240, 250, 255, 260, 265, 270, 275\nGroup B: 220, 225, 230, 235, 245, 250, 255, 260, 265, 270, 275, 280\n\nWhat is the p-value for the Wilcoxon rank-sum test? Can the researcher reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level?",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we first need to combine the two groups and rank the reading speeds. Here are the combined and ranked data:\n\n1. 220 (B)\n2. 225 (B)\n3. 230 (A)\n4. 230 (B)\n5. 235 (B)\n6. 240 (A)\n7. 245 (B)\n8. 250 (A)\n9. 250 (B)\n10. 255 (A)\n11. 255 (B)\n12. 260 (A)\n13. 260 (B)\n14. 265 (A)\n15. 265 (B)\n16. 270 (A)\n17. 270 (B)\n18. 275 (A)\n19. 275 (B)\n20. 280 (B)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the rank sum for each group:\n\nGroup A: 3 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 = 87\nGroup B: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 + 20 = 114\n\nNext, we need to find the expected rank sum (E) and the standard deviation (SD) for each group. The formulas are:\n\nE = n1(n1 + n2 + 1) / 2\nSD = sqrt(n1 * n2 * (n1 + n2 + 1) / 12)\n\nWhere n1 and n2 are the sample sizes for groups A and B, respectively.\n\nFor Group A:\nE = 8 * (8 + 12 + 1) / 2 = 8 * 21 / 2 = 84\nSD = sqrt(8 * 12 * (8 + 12 + 1) / 12) = sqrt(96 * 21 / 12) = sqrt(168) ≈ 12.96\n\nNow, we can calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (RankSum - E) / SD = (87 - 84) / 12.96 ≈ 0.23\n\nFinally, we can find the p-value using a z-table or calculator. For a two-tailed test, we need to consider both tails:\n\np-value = 2 * P(Z > |z|) = 2 * P(Z > 0.23) ≈ 2 * 0.4082 ≈ 0.8164\n\nThe p-value is approximately 0.8164. Since this p-value is greater than the 5% significance level (0.05), the researcher cannot reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to suggest a significant difference in the reading speed of the two groups."
