Let $\\theta_1(z)$ be the first Jacobi theta function defined by $\\theta_1(z)=2\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty q^{(n+1/2)^2}$, where $q=e^{i\\pi z}$. \n\nCalculate the value of $\\theta_1\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{i}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2$.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the value of $\\theta_1\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{i}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2$, we first need to find the value of $q$ for this given complex number. Let $z = \\dfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{i}{2\\sqrt{3}}$. Then,\n\n$$q = e^{i\\pi z} = e^{\\dfrac{i\\pi}{2} - \\dfrac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{3}}}.$$\n\nNow, we can plug this value of $q$ into the definition of the first Jacobi theta function:\n\n$$\\theta_1(z) = 2\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty q^{(n+1/2)^2} = 2\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left(e^{\\dfrac{i\\pi}{2} - \\dfrac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{3}}}\\right)^{(n+1/2)^2}.$$\n\nTo evaluate this sum, we can use the properties of exponentials:\n\n$$\\theta_1(z) = 2\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty e^{i\\pi(n+1/2)^2 - \\dfrac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{3}}(n+1/2)^2}.$$\n\nNow, we can separate the real and imaginary parts of the exponent:\n\n$$\\theta_1(z) = 2\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty e^{-\\dfrac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{3}}(n+1/2)^2} \\cdot e^{i\\pi(n+1/2)^2}.$$\n\nThe first term in the product is a real number, while the second term is a complex number on the unit circle. To evaluate this sum, we can use the geometric series formula for the real part and the Euler formula for the imaginary part:\n\n$$\\theta_1(z) = 2\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty e^{-\\dfrac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{3}}(n+1/2)^2} \\cdot (\\cos(\\pi(n+1/2)^2) + i\\sin(\\pi(n+1/2)^2)).$$\n\nUnfortunately, this sum does not have a closed-form expression. However, we can approximate the value of $\\theta_1(z)$ by computing the first few terms of the series. The more terms we include, the more accurate our approximation will be."
