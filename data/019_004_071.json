    "message_1": "Suppose a train leaves station A at 10:00 AM and arrives at station B at 11:30 AM. Express the statement \"the train arrived at station B before 11:00 AM\" using temporal logic notation.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the event of the train leaving station A as p and the event of the train arriving at station B as q. According to the given information, the train leaves station A at 10:00 AM and arrives at station B at 11:30 AM. We want to express the statement \"the train arrived at station B before 11:00 AM\" using temporal logic notation.\n\nIn temporal logic, we can use the \"until\" operator (U) to express that one event happens before another event. In this case, we want to express that the train arrives at station B (q) before 11:00 AM, which is 1 hour after leaving station A (p).\n\nSo, we can write the statement as:\n\np U[0,1] q\n\nThis means that event p (train leaving station A) happens until event q (train arriving at station B) within the time interval [0, 1] hours. However, this statement is false according to the given information, as the train actually arrives at station B at 11:30 AM, which is 1.5 hours after leaving station A."
