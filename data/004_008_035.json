    "message_1": "A ball is thrown in the air with an initial velocity of 50 ft/s from a height of 10 feet. The height function of the ball can be modeled by h(t) = -16t^2 + 50t + 10, where t is the time in seconds. Find the slope of the tangent line to the height function of the ball at the point where t = 2 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the height function at t = 2 seconds, we need to find the derivative of the height function with respect to time (t) and then evaluate it at t = 2 seconds.\n\nThe height function is h(t) = -16t^2 + 50t + 10.\n\nThe derivative of h(t) with respect to t is:\n\nh'(t) = d(-16t^2 + 50t + 10)/dt = -32t + 50\n\nNow, we need to evaluate h'(t) at t = 2 seconds:\n\nh'(2) = -32(2) + 50 = -64 + 50 = -14\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the height function of the ball at t = 2 seconds is -14."
