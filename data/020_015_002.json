    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangle be L meters and the width be W meters. We are given that the total fencing to be used is 500 meters. Since the field is to be divided into two sections, there will be three lengths of fencing and two widths of fencing used. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n3L + 2W = 500\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions that will maximize the area of the rectangle. The area of the rectangle is given by:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nWe can solve for W in terms of L from the fencing equation:\n\n2W = 500 - 3L\nW = (500 - 3L) / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W into the area equation:\n\nArea = L * ((500 - 3L) / 2)\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area with respect to L and set it to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dL = (500 - 3L)/2 - (3/2)L = 0\n\nSolve for L:\n\n(500 - 3L)/2 - (3/2)L = 0\n500 - 3L = 3L\n6L = 500\nL = 500/6\nL ≈ 83.33 meters\n\nNow, substitute the value of L back into the equation for W:\n\nW = (500 - 3(83.33)) / 2\nW ≈ 83.33 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle that will maximize the area are approximately 83.33 meters by 83.33 meters."
