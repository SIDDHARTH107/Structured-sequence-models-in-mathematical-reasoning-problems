    "message_2": "To find the minimum size of the vertex cover for this graph, we can use the approximation algorithm for vertex cover, which is a greedy algorithm. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Start with an empty vertex cover set.\n2. While there are uncovered edges in the graph, do the following:\n   a. Pick an arbitrary uncovered edge (u, v).\n   b. Add both u and v to the vertex cover set.\n   c. Remove all edges connected to u and v from the graph.\n\nLet's apply the algorithm to the given graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges:\n\n1. Initialize an empty vertex cover set: VC = {}.\n2. Since we don't have the specific edges, we will consider the worst-case scenario. In the worst case, we would need to add all 7 vertices to the vertex cover set. However, since the graph has 10 edges, we can guarantee that at least one vertex has a degree of at least 3 (by the Pigeonhole Principle). Let's assume that vertex is u.\n\n   a. Pick an arbitrary uncovered edge (u, v).\n   b. Add u and v to the vertex cover set: VC = {u, v}.\n   c. Remove all edges connected to u and v. Since u has a degree of at least 3, we are left with at most 6 edges.\n\n3. Repeat step 2 until there are no more uncovered edges. In the worst case, we may need to add two more vertices for each of the remaining 6 edges, which would require adding 3 more pairs of vertices to the vertex cover set.\n\nIn the worst case, the minimum size of the vertex cover for this graph using the approximation algorithm is 7. Note that this is an upper bound, and the actual minimum vertex cover size could be smaller depending on the specific structure of the graph."
