    "message_1": "Assume that a cryptographic hash function generates a hash value of 128 bits for a message of 1024 bits. How many different messages can this hash function represent?",
    "message_2": "A cryptographic hash function generates a fixed-size hash value (in this case, 128 bits) for any input message. Since there are 128 bits in the hash value, there are 2^128 possible unique hash values that can be generated.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of different messages that can be represented by this hash function, which is a different concept. The message size is 1024 bits, so there are 2^1024 possible unique messages that can be created with this message size.\n\nIt's important to note that hash functions can have collisions, meaning that two different messages might produce the same hash value. In this case, since there are more possible messages (2^1024) than hash values (2^128), there will inevitably be collisions. However, the number of different messages that can be represented by this hash function is still 2^1024, as each message is unique, even if some of them share the same hash value."
