    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance between A and B along a geodesic path on the surface, we can use the method of calculus of variations. We want to minimize the length of the curve on the surface between the two points. The length of a curve on the surface can be expressed as:\n\nL = ∫√(1 + (∂z/∂x)^2 + (∂z/∂y)^2) ds\n\nwhere ds is an infinitesimal arc length along the curve. For the given surface, we have:\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = 2y\n\nSince the points A and B lie on the x-axis, we can assume that the geodesic path lies in the xz-plane, and thus y = 0. This simplifies the expression for the length of the curve to:\n\nL = ∫√(1 + (2x)^2) dx from x=1 to x=3\n\nNow, we can use the substitution method to solve the integral:\n\nLet u = 2x, then du = 2 dx, and dx = du/2.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nL = (1/2) ∫√(1 + u^2) du from u=2 to u=6\n\nThis integral represents the length of a curve on the surface of a right circular cone with vertex at the origin and axis along the z-axis. The integral is the arc length of a hyperbolic segment, which can be expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions:\n\nL = (1/2) * (sinh^(-1)(u)) from u=2 to u=6\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\nL = (1/2) * (sinh^(-1)(6) - sinh^(-1)(2))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nL ≈ 3.316\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance between A and B along a geodesic path on the surface is approximately 3.316 units."
