    "message_1": "A metallic sphere of radius 5 cm has a charge of 30 μC distributed uniformly on its surface. Find the electric potential at a point located at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the sphere. (Assume the electric potential is governed by Laplace's equation for electrostatics.)",
    "message_2": "To find the electric potential at a point located at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the sphere, we can use the formula for the electric potential due to a point charge:\n\nV = k * Q / r\n\nwhere V is the electric potential, k is the electrostatic constant (approximately 8.99 × 10^9 N m^2/C^2), Q is the charge on the sphere, and r is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point.\n\nIn this case, the charge Q is 30 μC (microcoulombs), which is equal to 30 × 10^-6 C (coulombs). The distance r is 10 cm, which is equal to 0.1 m (meters).\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nV = (8.99 × 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (30 × 10^-6 C) / (0.1 m)\n\nV = (8.99 × 10^9) * (30 × 10^-6) / 0.1\n\nV = 2.697 × 10^6 V\n\nSo the electric potential at a point located at a distance of 10 cm from the center of the sphere is approximately 2.697 × 10^6 volts."
