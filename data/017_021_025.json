    "message_2": "To find the possible number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible structures of the groups.\n\nThe prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2, so n_2 can be 1 or 3. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible structures of the groups:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, the group is isomorphic to the direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup, which is C_16 x C_3 (cyclic group of order 16 and cyclic group of order 3).\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, and the group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, there are two non-isomorphic groups: C_3 ⋊ C_16 and C_3 ⋊ (C_8 x C_2).\n\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, and the group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, there are two non-isomorphic groups: C_16 ⋊ C_3 and (C_8 x C_2) ⋊ C_3.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, there are multiple Sylow 2-subgroups and multiple Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, there are three non-isomorphic groups: (C_3 x C_3) ⋊ C_8, (C_3 x C_3) ⋊ (C_4 x C_2), and (C_3 x C_3) ⋊ Q_8 (where Q_8 is the quaternion group of order 8).\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8 possible non-isomorphic groups of order 48 with the corresponding structures mentioned above."
