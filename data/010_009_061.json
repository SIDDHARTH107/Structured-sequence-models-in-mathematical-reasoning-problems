    "message_1": "A square with a side length of 4 units is to be divided into smaller triangles using triangulation. How many triangles are required if each division results in three triangles meeting at each vertex?",
    "message_2": "Let's consider one vertex of the square. If three triangles meet at this vertex, then the angle sum at this vertex should be 180 degrees (since the angle sum of a triangle is 180 degrees, and each vertex of the square is 90 degrees). Therefore, each of the three triangles must have an angle of 60 degrees at the vertex.\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite vertex of the square. The same logic applies, and three triangles must meet at this vertex as well, each with an angle of 60 degrees. Since the side length of the square is 4 units, the distance between these two vertices is also 4 units. We can now form an equilateral triangle with side length 4 units, which has angles of 60 degrees at each vertex.\n\nThis equilateral triangle covers half of the square, and it is divided into two smaller equilateral triangles, each with side length 2 units. The other half of the square can be covered by another equilateral triangle with side length 4 units, which is also divided into two smaller equilateral triangles with side length 2 units.\n\nSo, the square is divided into a total of 4 smaller equilateral triangles."
