    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C4 (cyclic group of order 4) or V4 (Klein four-group), we will first analyze the possible structures of G and then construct its multiplication table.\n\nSince G has order 4, there are 4 elements in G. Let's denote them as {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element. We know that for any element x in G, x * x^{-1} = e.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible orders of the elements a, b, and c:\n\n1. If there exists an element of order 4, say a, then G is generated by that element and is cyclic. In this case, G is isomorphic to C4. The multiplication table for C4 is:\n\n   e a b c\n e e a b c\n a a b c e\n b b c e a\n c c e a b\n\n2. If there are no elements of order 4, then all non-identity elements must have order 2. In this case, we have:\n\n   a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e\n\nNow, let's construct the multiplication table for G:\n\n   e a b c\n e e a b c\n a a e ? ?\n b b ? e ?\n c c ? ? e\n\nSince a * a = e, we know that a is its own inverse. Similarly, b and c are their own inverses. Now, we need to determine the products a * b, a * c, and b * c.\n\nNote that a * b cannot be equal to a or b, because if a * b = a, then multiplying both sides by a^{-1} would imply that b = e, which is a contradiction. Similarly, a * b â‰  b. Therefore, a * b must be equal to c. By the same reasoning, a * c = b and b * c = a. The multiplication table for G is now:\n\n   e a b c\n e e a b c\n a a e c b\n b b c e a\n c c b a e\n\nThis is the multiplication table for the Klein four-group V4. In this case, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, depending on the orders of its elements."
