    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety defined by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0$, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$, and then find the points where all three partial derivatives vanish simultaneously.\n\nLet $f(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz$. Then, the partial derivatives are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 - 3xz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = 3z^2 - 3xy$\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$3x^2 - 3yz = 0$\n\n$3y^2 - 3xz = 0$\n\n$3z^2 - 3xy = 0$\n\nWe can simplify the system by dividing each equation by $3$:\n\n$x^2 - yz = 0$\n\n$y^2 - xz = 0$\n\n$z^2 - xy = 0$\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible solutions:\n\n1) If $x = 0$, then from the third equation, we have $z^2 = 0$, so $z = 0$. Then, from the second equation, we have $y^2 = 0$, so $y = 0$. Thus, $(0, 0, 0)$ is a singular point.\n\n2) If $x \\neq 0$, we can divide the second equation by $x$ and the first equation by $y$:\n\n$\\frac{y^2}{x} - z = 0$\n\n$x - \\frac{z^2}{y} = 0$\n\nNow, adding these two equations, we get:\n\n$x + \\frac{y^2}{x} = z + \\frac{z^2}{y}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $xy$, we have:\n\n$x^2y + y^3 = xyz + xz^2$\n\nSince $x \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $x$:\n\n$xy + y^2 = yz + z^2$\n\nNow, notice that this equation is the same as the third equation in the simplified system. Therefore, we have a dependent system of equations, and the only solution is the trivial one, which we already found: $(0, 0, 0)$.\n\nThus, the only singular point of the algebraic variety defined by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0$ is $(0, 0, 0)$."
