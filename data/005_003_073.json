Twelve students were randomly selected from the class and their data was collected as follows:\n\nHours of Study (x):     6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30\nFinal Exam Scores (y): 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 95, 96, 98, 100\n\na) Calculate the regression line equation for the given data.\nb) Predict the final exam score for a student who studied for 15 hours.\nc) Calculate the coefficient of determination (R²) for the regression line. What does this tell you about the strength of the relationship between hours of study and final exam scores?",
    "message_2": "a) To calculate the regression line equation, we first need to find the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a) using the following formulas:\n\nb = Σ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] / Σ(xi - x_mean)²\na = y_mean - b * x_mean\n\nwhere xi and yi are the individual data points, and x_mean and y_mean are the means of x and y, respectively.\n\nFirst, we calculate the means of x and y:\n\nx_mean = (6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 16 + 18 + 20 + 22 + 24 + 26 + 28 + 30) / 12 = 210 / 12 = 17.5\ny_mean = (60 + 65 + 70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 92 + 95 + 96 + 98 + 100) / 12 = 1006 / 12 = 83.833\n\nNext, we calculate the slope (b):\n\nΣ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] = (6 - 17.5)(60 - 83.833) + (8 - 17.5)(65 - 83.833) + ... + (30 - 17.5)(100 - 83.833) = 1026.5\n\nΣ(xi - x_mean)² = (6 - 17.5)² + (8 - 17.5)² + ... + (30 - 17.5)² = 868.75\n\nb = 1026.5 / 868.75 ≈ 1.1816\n\nNow, we calculate the y-intercept (a):\n\na = y_mean - b * x_mean = 83.833 - 1.1816 * 17.5 ≈ 62.967\n\nSo, the regression line equation is:\n\ny = 1.1816x + 62.967\n\nb) To predict the final exam score for a student who studied for 15 hours, we plug x = 15 into the regression line equation:\n\ny = 1.1816 * 15 + 62.967 ≈ 80.707\n\nThe predicted final exam score for a student who studied for 15 hours is approximately 80.71.\n\nc) To calculate the coefficient of determination (R²), we use the following formula:\n\nR² = [Σ(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)]² / [Σ(xi - x_mean)² * Σ(yi - y_mean)²]\n\nWe already calculated Σ(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean) = 1026.5 and Σ(xi - x_mean)² = 868.75. Now, we need to calculate Σ(yi - y_mean)²:\n\nΣ(yi - y_mean)² = (60 - 83.833)² + (65 - 83.833)² + ... + (100 - 83.833)² = 2933.166\n\nNow, we can calculate R²:\n\nR² = (1026.5)² / (868.75 * 2933.166) ≈ 0.957\n\nThe coefficient of determination (R²) is approximately 0.957, which indicates a strong positive relationship between hours of study and final exam scores. This means that about 95.7% of the variation in final exam scores can be explained by the variation in hours of study."
