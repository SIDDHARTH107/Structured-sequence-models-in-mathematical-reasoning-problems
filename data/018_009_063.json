    "message_2": "To find (A × B) × C and A × (B × C), we first need to find the Cartesian products A × B and B × C.\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB × C = {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)}\n\nNow, we can find (A × B) × C and A × (B × C):\n\n(A × B) × C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 3), 6), ((1, 4), 5), ((1, 4), 6), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 3), 6), ((2, 4), 5), ((2, 4), 6)}\n\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (3, 6)), (1, (4, 5)), (1, (4, 6)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (3, 6)), (2, (4, 5)), (2, (4, 6))}\n\nNow, let's verify that they are equal to each other:\n\n(A × B) × C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 3), 6), ((1, 4), 5), ((1, 4), 6), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 3), 6), ((2, 4), 5), ((2, 4), 6)}\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (3, 6)), (1, (4, 5)), (1, (4, 6)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (3, 6)), (2, (4, 5)), (2, (4, 6))}\n\nWe can see that the elements in both sets are the same, just written in a slightly different notation. We can rewrite the elements of A × (B × C) to match the notation of (A × B) × C:\n\nA × (B × C) = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 3), 6), ((1, 4), 5), ((1, 4), 6), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 3), 6), ((2, 4), 5), ((2, 4), 6)}\n\nNow, both sets are equal:\n\n(A × B) × C = A × (B × C)\n\nHence, we have verified that (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) are equal to each other."
