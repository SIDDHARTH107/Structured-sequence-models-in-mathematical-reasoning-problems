    "message_1": "A substitution cipher was created by replacing each letter of the alphabet with another letter. What is the number of possible ways to create a substitution cipher using the 26 letters of the alphabet?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of possible ways to create a substitution cipher using the 26 letters of the alphabet, we need to consider the number of permutations of the 26 letters. A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order.\n\nIn this case, we have 26 letters, and each letter can be replaced by any of the remaining 25 letters, then the next letter can be replaced by any of the remaining 24 letters, and so on. This can be represented mathematically as the factorial of the number of letters, which is 26!\n\n26! = 26 × 25 × 24 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000\n\nSo there are 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 possible ways to create a substitution cipher using the 26 letters of the alphabet."
