    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(2x) = cos(x) for 0 < x < 2π, we can use the double-angle identity for sine:\n\nsin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)\n\nSo, our equation becomes:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) = cos(x)\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by cos(x) (assuming cos(x) ≠ 0):\n\n2sin(x) = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nsin(x) = 1/2\n\nThe solutions for x in the interval 0 < x < 2π are:\n\nx = π/6 and x = 5π/6\n\nHowever, we need to check if cos(x) is not equal to 0 for these values:\n\ncos(π/6) = √3/2 ≠ 0\ncos(5π/6) = -√3/2 ≠ 0\n\nSo, both solutions are valid, and the solutions for x in the given interval are:\n\nx = π/6 and x = 5π/6"
