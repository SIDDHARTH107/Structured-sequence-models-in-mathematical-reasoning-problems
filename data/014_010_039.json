    "message_2": "In a substitution cipher with a fixed permutation, the shift is constant for all letters. Since the substitution for the letter 'a' is 'd', we can determine that the shift is 3 positions forward in the alphabet.\n\nTo find the substitution for the letter 'y', we will apply the same shift:\n\ny -> z -> a -> b\n\nSo, the substitution for the letter 'y' is 'b'."
