    "message_2": "To find the Reeb vector field $R_\\alpha$, we first need to compute the exterior derivative of the contact form $\\alpha$. Recall that the exterior derivative of a 1-form is given by:\n\n$$d\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial x} dx \\wedge dy + \\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial y} dy \\wedge dz + \\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial z} dz \\wedge dx$$\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial x} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial y} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial z} = y$$\n\nThus, the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$ is:\n\n$$d\\alpha = y dz \\wedge dx$$\n\nNow, we need to find the Reeb vector field $R_\\alpha$ such that:\n\n1. $\\alpha(R_\\alpha) = 1$\n2. $d\\alpha(R_\\alpha, \\cdot) = 0$\n\nLet $R_\\alpha = A(x,y,z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + B(x,y,z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + C(x,y,z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$, where $A(x,y,z)$, $B(x,y,z)$, and $C(x,y,z)$ are smooth functions on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Then, we have:\n\n1. $\\alpha(R_\\alpha) = A dx + y C dz = 1$\n2. $d\\alpha(R_\\alpha, \\cdot) = y C dz \\wedge dx = 0$\n\nFrom the first condition, we get $A = 1$ and $yC = 0$. Since $y$ can be any real number, we must have $C = 0$. Thus, the Reeb vector field is:\n\n$$R_\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + B(x,y,z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the flow of $R_\\alpha$ through the point $(0,0,1)$. Let $\\phi_t(x,y,z)$ be the flow of $R_\\alpha$ at time $t$. Then, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\phi_t(x,y,z) = R_\\alpha(\\phi_t(x,y,z))$$\n\nSince $R_\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + B(x,y,z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$, we have the following system of ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1, \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} = B(x,y,z), \\quad \\frac{dz}{dt} = 0$$\n\nIntegrating the first equation, we get $x(t) = t + x_0$, where $x_0$ is a constant. Since $z$ is constant, we have $z(t) = z_0$. Now, we need to find $y(t)$.\n\nSince $d\\alpha(R_\\alpha, \\cdot) = 0$, we have:\n\n$$0 = y C dz \\wedge dx(R_\\alpha, \\cdot) = y C \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$$\n\nAs $C = 0$, we have $B(x,y,z) = 0$. Thus, the Reeb vector field is:\n\n$$R_\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$$\n\nNow, integrating the second equation, we get $y(t) = y_0$, where $y_0$ is a constant. Therefore, the flow of $R_\\alpha$ is given by:\n\n$$\\phi_t(x,y,z) = (t + x_0, y_0, z_0)$$\n\nFinally, we need to find the flow through the point $(0,0,1)$. Setting $\\phi_0(0,0,1) = (0,0,1)$, we get $x_0 = 0$, $y_0 = 0$, and $z_0 = 1$. Thus, the flow of $R_\\alpha$ through the point $(0,0,1)$ is:\n\n$$\\phi_t(0,0,1) = (t, 0, 1)$$"
