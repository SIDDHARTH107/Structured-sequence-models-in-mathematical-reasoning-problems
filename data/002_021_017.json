    "message_1": "A sector of a circle has a central angle of 60° and a radius of 8 cm. Find the area of the sector.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle/360°) × π × radius²\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 60° and the radius is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (60°/360°) × π × (8 cm)²\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 64 cm²\n\nArea of sector = 64π/6 cm²\n\nArea of sector = 32π/3 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the sector is (32π/3) cm²."
