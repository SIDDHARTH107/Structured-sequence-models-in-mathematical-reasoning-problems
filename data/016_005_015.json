    "message_2": "The Cantor set is formed by iteratively removing the middle third of a line segment. After the first removal, we are left with two line segments, each with a length of 1/3 units. \n\nHowever, the Cantor set is an infinite process, and we continue to remove the middle third of each remaining segment infinitely many times. As we continue this process, the total length of the remaining segments will decrease, but the Cantor set itself is still uncountable and has a length of 0.\n\nSo, the length of the Cantor set after removing the middle third from the given segment whose length is 1 unit is 0."
