    "message_2": "To solve this problem using generating functions, we first need to understand the concept of a generating function. A generating function is a formal power series whose coefficients represent the terms of a sequence. In this case, we want to find the probability of getting exactly 6 heads when flipping 10 coins, each with a probability of 0.5 of landing heads up.\n\nLet's represent the probability of getting heads as H and tails as T. Since each coin has a probability of 0.5 of landing heads up, we have:\n\nH = 0.5 and T = 0.5\n\nNow, let's construct the generating function for a single coin flip:\n\nG(x) = Hx + T = 0.5x + 0.5\n\nSince we have 10 coins, we need to find the 10th power of this generating function:\n\nG(x)^10 = (0.5x + 0.5)^10\n\nExpanding this expression using the binomial theorem, we get:\n\nG(x)^10 = Σ (10 choose k) * (0.5x)^k * (0.5)^(10-k), where the sum is from k=0 to 10.\n\nNow, we want to find the coefficient of x^6 in the expansion, which represents the probability of getting exactly 6 heads:\n\nCoefficient of x^6 = (10 choose 6) * (0.5)^6 * (0.5)^(10-6)\n\nUsing the binomial coefficient formula, (10 choose 6) = 10! / (6! * 4!) = 210\n\nSo, the coefficient of x^6 = 210 * (0.5)^6 * (0.5)^4 = 210 * (0.5)^10\n\nThe probability of getting exactly 6 heads is:\n\nP(6 heads) = 210 * (0.5)^10 ≈ 0.2051\n\nThus, the probability of getting exactly 6 heads when flipping 10 coins is approximately 0.2051 or 20.51%."
