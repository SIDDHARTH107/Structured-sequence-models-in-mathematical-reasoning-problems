    "message_2": "To find the expected number of individuals infected with the disease, we can multiply the total number of people in the community by the probability of an individual being infected.\n\nExpected number of infected individuals = Total number of people × Probability of being infected\nExpected number of infected individuals = 5,000 × 0.12\nExpected number of infected individuals = 600\n\nSo, in this community, 600 individuals are expected to be infected with the disease."
