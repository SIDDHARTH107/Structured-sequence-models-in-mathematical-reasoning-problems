The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted A ∆ B, is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {2} (intersection of A and B)\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 3} - {2} = {1, 3}\n\nNow, let's find (A ∆ B) x {1}:\n\n(A ∆ B) x {1} = {1, 3} x {1} = {(1, 1), (3, 1)}\n\nNext, let's find (A x {1}) ∆ (B x {1}). First, we need to find A x {1} and B x {1}:\n\nA x {1} = {1, 2} x {1} = {(1, 1), (2, 1)}\nB x {1} = {2, 3} x {1} = {(2, 1), (3, 1)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of these two sets:\n\n(A x {1}) ∆ (B x {1}) = ({(1, 1), (2, 1)} ∪ {(2, 1), (3, 1)}) - ({(1, 1), (2, 1)} ∩ {(2, 1), (3, 1)})\n\n(A x {1}) ∆ (B x {1}) = ({(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)} - {(2, 1)}) = {(1, 1), (3, 1)}\n\nNow, let's find A x ({1} ∆ B):\n\nSince {1} ∆ B = {1, 3}, we have:\n\nA x ({1} ∆ B) = {1, 2} x {1, 3} = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)}\n\nComparing the two sets:\n\n(A ∆ B) x {1} = {(1, 1), (3, 1)}\n(A x {1}) ∆ (B x {1}) = {(1, 1), (3, 1)}\n\nThese two sets are equal:\n\n(A ∆ B) x {1} = (A x {1}) ∆ (B x {1})\n\nHowever, A x ({1} ∆ B) is not equal to either of these sets:\n\nA x ({1} ∆ B) = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)}\n\nThus, (A x {1}) ∆ (B x {1}) is not equal to A x ({1} ∆ B)."
