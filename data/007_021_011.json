    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 1396261 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function, usually f(x) = (x^2 + 1) % N, where N is the number we want to factor.\n2. Choose two initial values for x and y, usually x = y = 2.\n3. Iterate the function for x and y, updating x = f(x) and y = f(f(y)).\n4. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between x and y and the number N.\n5. If the GCD is 1, continue iterating. If the GCD is equal to N, choose new initial values for x and y. If the GCD is a factor of N, we found a non-trivial factor.\n\nNow, let's apply the algorithm to find the smallest prime factor of 1396261:\n\nN = 1396261\nf(x) = (x^2 + 1) % N\nx = y = 2\n\nIterate and calculate the GCD:\n\n1. x = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) % 1396261 = 5\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) % 1396261 = 26\n   GCD(|5 - 26|, 1396261) = GCD(21, 1396261) = 1\n\n2. x = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) % 1396261 = 26\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) % 1396261 = 1218986\n   GCD(|26 - 1218986|, 1396261) = GCD(1218960, 1396261) = 1\n\n3. x = f(x) = (26^2 + 1) % 1396261 = 677\n   y = f(f(y)) = f(f(1218986)) = f(1218986) = (1218986^2 + 1) % 1396261 = 1044682\n   GCD(|677 - 1044682|, 1396261) = GCD(1044005, 1396261) = 61\n\nThe smallest prime factor of 1396261 is 61."
