    "message_1": "A sample of radioactive material has an initial mass of 500 grams and a half-life of 10 days. How much of the material remains after 20 days?",
    "message_2": "To find out how much of the radioactive material remains after 20 days, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 500 grams, the half-life is 10 days, and the time elapsed is 20 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/2)^(20 / 10)\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/2)^2\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/4)\nFinal mass = 125 grams\n\nSo, after 20 days, 125 grams of the radioactive material remains."
