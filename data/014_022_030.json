    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create the 5x5 matrix using the key \"MATHS\":\n   Remove any duplicate letters from the key and fill the matrix row by row. Then fill in the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J) in alphabetical order.\n\n   M A T H S\n   B C D E F\n   G I K L N\n   O P Q R U\n   V W X Y Z\n\n2. Prepare the plaintext message:\n   Break the message into pairs of letters. If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them. If the message has an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end.\n\n   HE LX LO\n\n3. Encrypt each pair of letters:\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrap around to the beginning if needed).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrap around to the top if needed).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its row but in the other pair's column.\n\n   HE -> ZC\n   LX -> QF\n   LO -> RP\n\n4. Combine the encrypted pairs to get the ciphertext:\n\n   ZCQFRP\n\nSo, the ciphertext for the plaintext message \"HELLO\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\" is \"ZCQFRP\"."
