    "message_2": "First, let's find the union of A and B, which is denoted as A ∪ B. This is the set of all elements that are in A or in B or in both.\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}\n\nNow let's find the complements of A and B, denoted as A' and B'. The complements are the sets of all elements not in A and not in B, respectively. Since we are not given a universal set, we cannot determine the exact elements in A' and B'. However, we can still find the Cartesian products involving A' and B'.\n\nThe Cartesian product of two sets X and Y, denoted as X x Y, is the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) such that x is in X and y is in Y.\n\nNow let's find (A ∪ B) x A' and A' x B':\n\n(A ∪ B) x A' = {(1, a'), (2, a'), (3, a'), (4, a'), (6, a')}, where a' is an element in A'\n\nA' x B' = {(a', b')}, where a' is an element in A' and b' is an element in B'\n\nNow we need to show that the Cartesian product of (A ∪ B) and A' is not equal to the union of the Cartesian product of A' and B' and the Cartesian product of B' and A'.\n\n(A ∪ B) x A' = {(1, a'), (2, a'), (3, a'), (4, a'), (6, a')}\n\nA' x B' ∪ B' x A' = {(a', b')}\n\nAs we can see, the two sets are not equal. The set (A ∪ B) x A' contains ordered pairs with elements from A ∪ B in the first position and elements from A' in the second position. On the other hand, the set A' x B' ∪ B' x A' contains ordered pairs with elements from A' and B' in both positions. Therefore, the Cartesian product of (A ∪ B) and A' is not equal to the union of the Cartesian product of A' and B' and the Cartesian product of B' and A'."
