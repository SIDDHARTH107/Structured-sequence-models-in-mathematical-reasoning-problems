Denote by C^*(X/G, ℤ/p) the cohomology groups of the quotient space X/G with coefficients in ℤ/p (where p is a prime number). If H^2(X/G, ℤ/p) is non-trivial, prove that the action of G on X is not freely homotopic to the trivial action.",
    "message_2": "Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the action of G on X is freely homotopic to the trivial action. This means that there exists a homotopy H: X × G × I → X, where I = [0, 1], such that H(x, g, 0) = g * x and H(x, g, 1) = x for all x ∈ X and g ∈ G. \n\nNow, consider the projection map π: X → X/G, which sends each point x ∈ X to its orbit G * x. Since the action of G on X is continuous, the quotient space X/G is also a connected, compact topological space. \n\nWe can define a map F: X × G × I → X/G by F(x, g, t) = π(H(x, g, t)). This map is continuous, and we have F(x, g, 0) = π(g * x) and F(x, g, 1) = π(x) for all x ∈ X and g ∈ G. \n\nNow, let's consider the induced map on cohomology F*: H^2(X/G, ℤ/p) → H^2(X/G, ℤ/p). Since F(x, g, 1) = π(x) for all x ∈ X and g ∈ G, F is homotopic to the identity map on X/G. Therefore, F* is an isomorphism on cohomology.\n\nHowever, we are given that H^2(X/G, ℤ/p) is non-trivial. Since F* is an isomorphism, there must exist some non-trivial element α ∈ H^2(X/G, ℤ/p) such that F*(α) ≠ 0. But this contradicts our assumption that the action of G on X is freely homotopic to the trivial action, as F* should map all elements to 0 in this case.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that the action of G on X is freely homotopic to the trivial action must be false. Hence, the action of G on X is not freely homotopic to the trivial action."
