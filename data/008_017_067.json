    "message_2": "First, let's express the system of linear equations in matrix form. We can write it as AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  4  0 |\n    | 0  5  2 |\n    | 0  0  7 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 12 |\n    | 21 |\n    | 28 |\n\nNow, we can use the sparse matrix method to solve the system. Since the matrix A is already in upper triangular form (all the elements below the main diagonal are zero), we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStarting with the last equation (bottom row of the matrix A):\n\n7z = 28\nz = 28 / 7\nz = 4\n\nNow, substitute the value of z into the second equation (middle row of the matrix A):\n\n5y + 2z = 21\n5y + 2(4) = 21\n5y + 8 = 21\n5y = 13\ny = 13 / 5\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z into the first equation (top row of the matrix A):\n\n3x + 4y + 0z = 12\n3x + 4(13/5) = 12\n3x + 52/5 = 12\n\nTo solve for x, first multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n15x + 52 = 60\n15x = 8\nx = 8 / 15\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 8/15\ny = 13/5\nz = 4"
