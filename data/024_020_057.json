Determine the Hopf map, $h:S^3 \\rightarrow S^2$, which sends each point on $S^3$ to a point on $S^2$. Specifically, find the expression for $h(x,y,z,w)$ in terms of $(x,y,z,w)$.",
    "message_2": "The Hopf map, $h: S^3 \\rightarrow S^2$, can be defined as follows:\n\n$$h(x, y, z, w) = (u, v, w)$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$u = 2(xz + yw)$$\n$$v = 2(yz - xw)$$\n$$w = x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - w^2$$\n\nThis map sends each point $(x, y, z, w)$ on the unit 3-sphere $S^3$ to a point $(u, v, w)$ on the unit 2-sphere $S^2$. Note that the Hopf map is a continuous map between the two spheres and has interesting topological properties, such as being a nontrivial fiber bundle."
