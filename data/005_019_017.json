    "message_1": "Suppose a company has three machines that produce bolts. The machines are labeled A, B, and C. The percentage of bolts produced by machine A that are defective is 5%. The percentage of bolts produced by machine B that are defective is 3%. The percentage of bolts produced by machine C that are defective is 2%. Each machine produces 500 bolts each day, and the bolts are mixed together. What is the probability that a randomly selected bolt is defective?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected bolt is defective, we need to first find the total number of defective bolts produced by each machine and then divide that by the total number of bolts produced by all three machines.\n\nMachine A produces 5% defective bolts, so it produces 0.05 * 500 = 25 defective bolts per day.\nMachine B produces 3% defective bolts, so it produces 0.03 * 500 = 15 defective bolts per day.\nMachine C produces 2% defective bolts, so it produces 0.02 * 500 = 10 defective bolts per day.\n\nIn total, there are 25 + 15 + 10 = 50 defective bolts produced per day by all three machines.\n\nEach machine produces 500 bolts per day, so the total number of bolts produced by all three machines is 500 * 3 = 1500 bolts per day.\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected bolt is defective is the total number of defective bolts divided by the total number of bolts produced:\n\nProbability = (Number of defective bolts) / (Total number of bolts)\nProbability = 50 / 1500\nProbability = 1 / 30\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected bolt is defective is 1/30 or approximately 3.33%."
