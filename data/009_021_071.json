    "message_1": "Consider the partial differential equation \n\n∂u/∂t = 4∂²u/∂x²\n\nsubject to the initial conditions:\n\nu(x,0) = 5 for 0 ≤ x ≤ π \nu(x,0) = 0 for π ≤ x ≤ 2π\n\nand the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,t) = u(2π,t) = 0 for all t.\n\nFind the solution u(x,t) using the method of separation of variables.",
    "message_2": "To solve this PDE using the method of separation of variables, we assume that the solution u(x,t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we substitute this into the PDE:\n\n∂u/∂t = 4∂²u/∂x²\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = 4T(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 4XT:\n\n(1/4T)∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\n(1/4T)∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²\n(1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1) ∂²X(x)/∂x² + λ²X(x) = 0\n2) ∂T(t)/∂t + 4λ²T(t) = 0\n\nSolving the first ODE, we get:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions u(0,t) = u(2π,t) = 0, we get:\n\nX(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = A = 0\nX(2π) = B*sin(2πλ) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(2πλ) = 0, which implies that λ = n, where n is an integer. Thus, we have:\n\nX_n(x) = B_n*sin(nx)\n\nNow, we solve the second ODE:\n\n∂T(t)/∂t + 4n²T(t) = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\nT_n(t) = C_n*exp(-4n²t)\n\nNow, our solution is given by the product of X_n(x) and T_n(t):\n\nu_n(x,t) = X_n(x)T_n(t) = B_n*sin(nx)C_n*exp(-4n²t)\n\nSince the PDE is linear, the general solution is a sum of these solutions:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ B_n*C_n*sin(nx)exp(-4n²t)\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition u(x,0) = 5 for 0 ≤ x ≤ π and u(x,0) = 0 for π ≤ x ≤ 2π:\n\nu(x,0) = Σ B_n*C_n*sin(nx)\n\nFor 0 ≤ x ≤ π:\n\n5 = Σ B_n*C_n*sin(nx)\n\nFor π ≤ x ≤ 2π:\n\n0 = Σ B_n*C_n*sin(nx)\n\nWe can find the coefficients B_n*C_n by using Fourier sine series:\n\nB_n*C_n = (2/π)∫[0,π] 5*sin(nx)dx - (2/π)∫[π,2π] 0*sin(nx)dx\n\nThe second integral is zero, so we only need to compute the first integral:\n\nB_n*C_n = (2/π)∫[0,π] 5*sin(nx)dx = (10/π)[(-1/n)cos(nx)]|[0,π]\n\nFor n even, cos(nπ) = 1, and for n odd, cos(nπ) = -1. Therefore, the coefficients B_n*C_n are:\n\nB_n*C_n = 0 for n even\nB_n*C_n = (-20/nπ) for n odd\n\nNow, we can write the final solution:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [(-1)^(n+1) * 20/nπ] * sin(nx) * exp(-4n²t) for odd n\n\nThis is the solution to the given PDE with the specified initial and boundary conditions."
