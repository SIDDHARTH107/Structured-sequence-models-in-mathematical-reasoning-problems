    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension (D) of a self-similar fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Lévy C curve, the scaling factor (S) is 1/3 and there are 2 self-similar pieces (N = 2) in each iteration. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nD = log(2) / log(1/3)\n\nD ≈ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve is approximately 1.2619. This dimension remains the same regardless of the number of iterations, as the fractal's self-similar nature means its dimension is consistent across all iterations."
