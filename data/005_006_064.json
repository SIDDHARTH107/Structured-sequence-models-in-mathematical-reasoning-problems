    "message_1": "In a population of 500 college students, the mean height is 68 inches with a standard deviation of 3 inches. If a random sample of 50 students is taken from this population, what is the probability that the sample mean height is between 67.5 and 68.5 inches? (Assuming the sample is normally distributed due to the central limit theorem).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 68 inches, the population standard deviation (σ) is 3 inches, and the sample size (n) is 50 students.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean):\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\nσ_sample_mean = 3 / √50\nσ_sample_mean ≈ 0.4243 inches\n\nNow, we will calculate the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the sample mean height (67.5 and 68.5 inches, respectively):\n\nz_lower = (67.5 - μ) / σ_sample_mean\nz_lower = (67.5 - 68) / 0.4243\nz_lower ≈ -1.18\n\nz_upper = (68.5 - μ) / σ_sample_mean\nz_upper = (68.5 - 68) / 0.4243\nz_upper ≈ 1.18\n\nNow, we will use a z-table or calculator to find the probability between these two z-scores. The probability for z = -1.18 is approximately 0.1190, and the probability for z = 1.18 is approximately 0.8810.\n\nTo find the probability that the sample mean height is between 67.5 and 68.5 inches, we will subtract the probability of z_lower from the probability of z_upper:\n\nP(67.5 < sample mean < 68.5) = P(z_upper) - P(z_lower)\nP(67.5 < sample mean < 68.5) = 0.8810 - 0.1190\nP(67.5 < sample mean < 68.5) ≈ 0.7620\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sample mean height is between 67.5 and 68.5 inches is approximately 76.20%."
