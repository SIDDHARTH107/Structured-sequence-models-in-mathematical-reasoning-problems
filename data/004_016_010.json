    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, we have a car traveling from point A to point B over a distance of 60 miles in 2 hours. Let's denote the position function of the car as s(t), where s(t) represents the distance traveled by the car at time t.\n\nThe average speed of the car over the entire trip is given by the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken:\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance) / (Total time) = 60 miles / 2 hours = 30 mph\n\nNow, we need to find a point in time when the car was traveling at this average speed of 30 mph. According to the Mean Value Theorem, there must exist a point c in the interval (0, 2) such that the instantaneous speed (the derivative of the position function) at that point is equal to the average speed:\n\ns'(c) = 30 mph\n\nSince we don't have the explicit function s(t), we cannot find the exact value of c. However, the Mean Value Theorem guarantees that there exists at least one point c in the interval (0, 2) where the car was traveling at an instantaneous speed of 30 mph."
