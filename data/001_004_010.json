    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 1, b = -6, and c = 8.\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(1)(8))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 32)) / 2\n\nx = (6 ± √4) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (6 + 2) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4\n\nx = (6 - 2) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 2 and 4."
