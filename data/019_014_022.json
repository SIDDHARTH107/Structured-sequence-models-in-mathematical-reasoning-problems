    "message_2": "To prove that f(x) = x^2 is continuous using higher-order logic, we need to show that for any real number x in S and any ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that for all y in S, if |y - x| < δ, then |f(y) - f(x)| < ε.\n\nLet x be an arbitrary real number in S, and let ε > 0 be given. We want to find a δ > 0 such that for all y in S, if |y - x| < δ, then |f(y) - f(x)| < ε.\n\nConsider the function f(y) = y^2. We have:\n\n|f(y) - f(x)| = |y^2 - x^2| = |(y - x)(y + x)|\n\nWe want to bound this expression by ε. Since we are given that |y - x| < δ, we can use this to find a suitable bound for |y + x|. Notice that:\n\n|y + x| = |(y - x) + 2x| ≤ |y - x| + |2x|\n\nNow, we need to find a δ > 0 such that:\n\n|y - x|(|y - x| + |2x|) < ε\n\nWe can choose δ = min(1, ε/(|2x| + 1)). This choice ensures that δ > 0 and that |y - x| < 1.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n|y - x|(|y - x| + |2x|) < δ(|2x| + 1) ≤ ε\n\nThus, for any real number x in S and any ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that for all y in S, if |y - x| < δ, then |f(y) - f(x)| < ε. This proves that the function f(x) = x^2 is continuous over the set of all real numbers S using higher-order logic."
