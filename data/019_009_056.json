    "message_2": "Given that A and B imply C, we can write this as:\n\n(1) If A and B are true, then C is true.\n\nAnd given that not A implies not C, we can write this as:\n\n(2) If A is false, then C is false.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible truth values of A, B, and C:\n\nCase 1: A is true, B is true\nFrom (1), C must be true.\n\nCase 2: A is true, B is false\nWe don't have enough information to determine the truth value of C.\n\nCase 3: A is false, B is true\nFrom (2), C must be false.\n\nCase 4: A is false, B is false\nFrom (2), C must be false.\n\nFrom the above cases, we can see that the truth value of statement B does not have a direct impact on the truth value of statement C. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of statement B based on the given information."
