    "message_2": "The cuckoo search algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. It is not possible to provide an exact solution using this algorithm, as it is a nature-inspired search algorithm that provides approximate solutions. However, I can guide you through the steps of the algorithm and provide a general idea of how it works.\n\n1. Initialization: Generate an initial population of n host nests (solutions) randomly within the search space (in this case, the interval [-2, 2]).\n\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each nest (solution) by calculating the value of the function f(x) for each x in the nest.\n\n3. While the stopping criterion is not met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a desired level of accuracy), perform the following steps:\n\n   a. Choose a random nest (say, i) and generate a new solution (say, j) by applying a random walk (Levy flight) to the current solution.\n   \n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution (j). If it is better (i.e., has a lower value of f(x)) than the current solution (i), replace the current solution with the new solution.\n   \n   c. With a probability p, choose a random nest (say, k) and replace it with a new solution generated by applying a random walk (Levy flight) if the new solution is better than the current solution (k).\n   \n   d. Update the best solution found so far.\n\n4. The best solution found during the iterations is considered the approximate minimum value of the function f(x) and its corresponding x value.\n\nNote that the cuckoo search algorithm does not guarantee finding the exact minimum value, but it can provide a good approximation. To find the exact minimum value, you would need to use calculus-based optimization methods, such as finding the critical points by setting the derivative of the function equal to zero and analyzing the second derivative."
