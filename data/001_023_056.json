    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(2x) + cos(x) = 0 for values of x between 0 and 2π, we can use the double angle identity for sine: sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x). So the equation becomes:\n\n2sin(x)cos(x) + cos(x) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor out cos(x):\n\ncos(x)(2sin(x) + 1) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied when either cos(x) = 0 or 2sin(x) + 1 = 0.\n\nFor cos(x) = 0, we have:\n\nx = π/2, 3π/2\n\nFor 2sin(x) + 1 = 0, we have:\n\nsin(x) = -1/2\n\nx = arcsin(-1/2)\n\nx = -π/6, -5π/6\n\nHowever, since we are looking for solutions between 0 and 2π, we need to find the corresponding angles in that range:\n\nx = 11π/6, 7π/6\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the given range are:\n\nx = π/2, 3π/2, 11π/6, 7π/6"
