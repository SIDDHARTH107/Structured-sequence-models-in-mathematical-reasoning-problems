    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature (K) of the surface z = 2x^2 + 3y^2 at the point (1,1), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet the surface be parametrized by r(u,v) = (u, v, 2u^2 + 3v^2). Then, we can find the partial derivatives with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 4u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 6v)\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 16u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 24uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 36v^2\n\nAt the point (1,1), these coefficients become:\n\nE = 17\nF = 24\nG = 37\n\nNext, we need to find the second fundamental form coefficients. To do this, we first find the normal vector (N) to the surface:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (-4u, -6v, 1)\n\nAt the point (1,1), the normal vector becomes:\n\nN = (-4, -6, 1)\n\nNow, we can find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = N • r_uu = -8\nM = N • r_uv = -12\nN = N • r_vv = -18\n\nFinally, we can find the Gaussian curvature (K) using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\nK = (-8 * -18 - (-12)^2) / (17 * 37 - 24^2)\nK = (144 - 144) / (629 - 576)\nK = 0 / 53\nK = 0\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = 2x^2 + 3y^2 at the point (1,1) is 0."
