    "message_1": "A company produces two products: A and B. Each unit of A requires 3 units of material M and 2 units of material N, while each unit of B requires 2 units of material M and 4 units of material N. If there are 240 units of M and 200 units of N available for production, and the profit per unit of A is $5 and the profit per unit of B is $6, find the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The constraints for the available materials M and N can be written as:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 240 (Material M constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 200 (Material N constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 5x + 6y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\nFor the Material M constraint:\ny ≤ (240 - 3x) / 2\n\nFor the Material N constraint:\ny ≤ (200 - 2x) / 4\n\nSince x and y cannot be negative (we cannot produce a negative number of products), we also have:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the constraint equations:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0:\nx = 0, y = 0\n\n2. Intersection of x = 0 and 2x + 4y = 200:\nx = 0, y = 50\n\n3. Intersection of 3x + 2y = 240 and 2x + 4y = 200:\nx = 40, y = 30\n\n4. Intersection of 3x + 2y = 240 and x = 0:\nx = 0, y = 120 (This point is not in the feasible region because it does not satisfy the Material N constraint)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P at each vertex of the feasible region:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 6(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 50) = 5(0) + 6(50) = 300\n3. P(40, 30) = 5(40) + 6(30) = 200 + 180 = 380\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved at the point (40, 30), where the company should produce 40 units of product A and 30 units of product B. The maximum profit will be $380."
