    "message_1": "Let A be the set of even numbers between 2 and 10, and let B be the set of odd numbers between 1 and 9. Determine the intersection of A and its complement.",
    "message_2": "The set A contains the even numbers between 2 and 10, so A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. The complement of A, denoted as A', contains all the numbers that are not in A. Since we are considering the numbers between 1 and 10, the complement of A would be the set of odd numbers between 1 and 9, which is the same as set B. So, A' = B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nThe intersection of A and A' (or A ∩ A') represents the set of elements that are common to both A and A'. Since A contains even numbers and A' contains odd numbers, there are no common elements between the two sets.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of A and its complement, A ∩ A', is an empty set, denoted as ∅."
