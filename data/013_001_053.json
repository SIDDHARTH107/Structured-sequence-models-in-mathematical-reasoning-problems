    "message_1": "In a Prisoner's Dilemma game, two people are arrested and charged with a crime. They are offered a plea deal: if they both stay silent, they will be sentenced to one year in prison. However, if one confesses and the other stays silent, the confessor will be set free and the silent one will be sentenced to ten years in prison. If both confess, they will each be sentenced to five years in prison. \n\nSuppose that Player A always confesses and Player B randomly decides whether to confess or stay silent with a probability of 0.6. What is the expected payoff for each player in this scenario?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected payoff for each player, we need to consider the possible outcomes and their probabilities.\n\nSince Player A always confesses, there are two possible scenarios:\n\n1. Player B confesses (probability 0.6): Both players confess, so they each get 5 years in prison.\n2. Player B stays silent (probability 0.4): Player A confesses and Player B stays silent, so Player A is set free and Player B gets 10 years in prison.\n\nNow, we calculate the expected payoff for each player:\n\nExpected payoff for Player A:\n(0.6 * -5 years) + (0.4 * 0 years) = -3 years\n\nExpected payoff for Player B:\n(0.6 * -5 years) + (0.4 * -10 years) = -3 years - 4 years = -7 years\n\nSo, the expected payoff for Player A is -3 years in prison, and the expected payoff for Player B is -7 years in prison."
