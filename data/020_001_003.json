    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B, using two machines, X and Y. The production time for product A on the machines are 2 minutes on machine X and 5 minutes on machine Y. The production time for product B on the machines are 4 minutes on machine X and 3 minutes on machine Y. Machine X can be used for a maximum of 200 minutes a day and machine Y can be used for a maximum of 180 minutes a day. The profit per unit for product A is $10 and for product B is $15. Find the number of units of each product the company should produce daily to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "Let's use linear programming to solve this problem. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nThe constraints are given by the production times and machine availability:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 200 (Machine X constraint)\n5x + 3y ≤ 180 (Machine Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint for product A)\ny ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint for product B)\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 4y ≤ 200\n   Divide by 2: x + 2y ≤ 100\n   y ≤ -0.5x + 50\n\n2. 5x + 3y ≤ 180\n   y ≤ -5/3x + 60\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. We'll find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of the two lines:\n   -0.5x + 50 = -5/3x + 60\n   10/3x = 10\n   x = 3\n   y = -0.5(3) + 50 = 48.5\n\n2. Intersection of the first line with the x-axis (y = 0):\n   x + 2(0) ≤ 100\n   x = 100\n\n3. Intersection of the second line with the x-axis (y = 0):\n   5x + 3(0) ≤ 180\n   x = 36\n\n4. Intersection of the first line with the y-axis (x = 0):\n   2(0) + 4y ≤ 200\n   y = 50\n\n5. Intersection of the second line with the y-axis (x = 0):\n   5(0) + 3y ≤ 180\n   y = 60\n\nThe corner points of the feasible region are (0, 50), (0, 60), (3, 48.5), (36, 0), and (100, 0). Now, we'll evaluate the profit function at each of these points:\n\nP(0, 50) = 10(0) + 15(50) = 750\nP(0, 60) = 10(0) + 15(60) = 900\nP(3, 48.5) = 10(3) + 15(48.5) = 757.5\nP(36, 0) = 10(36) + 15(0) = 360\nP(100, 0) = 10(100) + 15(0) = 1000\n\nThe maximum profit is $1000, which occurs when the company produces 100 units of product A and 0 units of product B daily."
