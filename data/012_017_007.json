    "message_1": "Given a graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges, identify if the graph contains a perfect matching. If it does, provide an example of the perfect matching on the graph. If it does not, explain why.",
    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges share a vertex. In other words, a perfect matching pairs up all the vertices in the graph.\n\nFor a graph to have a perfect matching, it must satisfy the Tutte-Berge formula:\n\nmin(deg(u) + deg(v) - k) â‰¥ k - 1\n\nwhere u and v are any two non-adjacent vertices, deg(u) and deg(v) are their degrees, and k is the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges. Since the graph has an even number of vertices, it is possible for it to have a perfect matching. However, we need more information about the graph's structure to determine if a perfect matching exists or not.\n\nIf the graph is connected and has a minimum degree of at least 2, then it is likely to have a perfect matching. For example, consider the following graph with 8 vertices (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) and 12 edges:\n\nA - B - C - D\n|   |   |   |\nE - F - G - H\n\nIn this graph, we can find a perfect matching by pairing up the vertices as follows:\n\n(A, B), (C, D), (E, F), (G, H)\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific structure of the graph, we cannot definitively say whether it contains a perfect matching or not."
