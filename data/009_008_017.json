    "message_1": "Sure, here is a math problem for a student to solve:\n\nConsider a one-dimensional wave equation given as,\n\n$u_{tt} = 4u_{xx}$\n\nsubject to the initial conditions: $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$ and $u_t(x,0) = 0$.\n\nFind the solution $u(x,t)$ that satisfies the given equation and initial conditions for $t>0$ and $0 \\le x \\le 1$. Then, determine the behavior of the solution as $t$ approaches infinity.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given one-dimensional wave equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending on x and the other depending on t:\n\n$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, substitute this into the wave equation:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) = 4X''(x)T(t)$\n\nDivide both sides by $4X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{4T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, they must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{4T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$\n2) $T''(t) + 4\\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nSolve the first equation for X(x):\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) + B\\sin(\\lambda x)$\n\nSince the solution must be periodic with period 1, we have $X(0) = X(1)$. This implies that $A = 0$ and $\\lambda = n\\pi$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$. Thus,\n\n$X_n(x) = B_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$\n\nNow, solve the second equation for T(t):\n\n$T(t) = C\\cos(2\\lambda t) + D\\sin(2\\lambda t)$\n\nUsing the initial condition $u_t(x,0) = 0$, we have $D = 0$. Thus,\n\n$T_n(t) = C_n\\cos(2n\\pi t)$\n\nNow, the general solution is given by:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n\\sin(n\\pi x)\\cos(2n\\pi t)$\n\nUsing the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$, we have:\n\n$\\sin(\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$\n\nComparing the coefficients, we get $C_1 = 1$ and $C_n = 0$ for $n > 1$. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi t)$\n\nAs $t$ approaches infinity, the cosine term oscillates between -1 and 1, so the solution does not converge to a specific value. However, the amplitude of the oscillation remains constant, so the overall behavior of the solution remains bounded as $t$ approaches infinity."
