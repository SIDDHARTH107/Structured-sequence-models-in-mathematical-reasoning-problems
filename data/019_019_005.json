    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. First, we'll find the total number of binary strings of length 5, and then we'll subtract the number of strings that contain the sequence 101.\n\nTotal number of binary strings of length 5:\nSince each position in the string can be either a 0 or a 1, there are 2^5 = 32 possible binary strings of length 5.\n\nNow, let's find the number of strings that contain the sequence 101.\n\nCase 1: 101 is at the beginning of the string (101xx):\nThere are 2 possibilities for the last two positions (00, 01, 10, or 11), so there are 2 strings in this case.\n\nCase 2: 101 is in the middle of the string (x101x):\nThere are 2 possibilities for the first position (0 or 1) and 2 possibilities for the last position (0 or 1), so there are 2 * 2 = 4 strings in this case.\n\nCase 3: 101 is at the end of the string (xx101):\nThere are 2 possibilities for the first two positions (00, 01, 10, or 11), so there are 2 strings in this case.\n\nNow, we need to consider the overlap between these cases. There is only one string that has an overlap: 010101. This string is counted in both Case 1 and Case 3. So, we need to subtract 1 from the total count to account for this overlap.\n\nTotal number of strings containing 101 = 2 (Case 1) + 4 (Case 2) + 2 (Case 3) - 1 (overlap) = 7.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of strings containing 101 from the total number of binary strings of length 5:\n\nNumber of binary strings of length 5 without 101 = 32 (total) - 7 (with 101) = 25.\n\nSo, there are 25 binary strings of length 5 that do not contain the sequence 101."
