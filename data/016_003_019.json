    "message_2": "The area of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (π/4) * (2 - φ)^2\n\nwhere φ is the golden ratio, approximately equal to 1.618033988749895.\n\nArea = (π/4) * (2 - 1.618033988749895)^2\nArea ≈ (π/4) * (0.381966011250105)^2\nArea ≈ (π/4) * 0.145898033750315\nArea ≈ 0.114942044853296\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is approximately 0.114942044853296 square units."
