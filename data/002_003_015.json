    "message_2": "The surface area of a cube can be found using the formula: Surface Area = 6 * (edge length)^2.\n\nIn this case, the edge length is 6 cm. So, the surface area of the cube is:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * (6 cm)^2\nSurface Area = 6 * 36 cm^2\nSurface Area = 216 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 216 square centimeters."
