    "message_1": "A manufacturer of potato chips packages them in bags labeled as 500g, but the bags weights actually vary. To check the weights, the manufacturer takes a sample of 25 bags and records their weights. The average weight of the sample is 510g and the standard deviation is 12g. What is the 95% confidence interval estimate for the true mean weight of the bags of potato chips?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of the bags of potato chips, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, t is the t-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% in this case), s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nWe are given the following values:\nx̄ = 510g (sample mean)\ns = 12g (sample standard deviation)\nn = 25 (sample size)\n\nSince we are looking for a 95% confidence interval and our sample size is 25, we will use a t-distribution table to find the appropriate t-score. With 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24) and a 95% confidence level, the t-score is approximately 2.064.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nCI = 510 ± (2.064 * (12 / √25))\nCI = 510 ± (2.064 * (12 / 5))\nCI = 510 ± (2.064 * 2.4)\nCI = 510 ± 4.9536\n\nSo the 95% confidence interval estimate for the true mean weight of the bags of potato chips is approximately (505.0464g, 514.9536g)."
