    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x + 3) + log(x + 2) = log(180), we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property that log(a) + log(b) = log(a * b).\n\nApplying this property, we get:\n\nlog((x + 3)(x + 2)) = log(180)\n\nSince the logarithms are equal, their arguments must also be equal:\n\n(x + 3)(x + 2) = 180\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\nx^2 + 2x + 3x + 6 = 180\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\nx^2 + 5x + 6 = 180\n\nSubtracting 180 from both sides, we get a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 + 5x - 174 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 5, and c = -174. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-5 ± √(5^2 - 4(1)(-174))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 + 696)) / 2\n\nx = (-5 ± √721) / 2\n\nThe two possible values for x are:\n\nx = (-5 + √721) / 2 ≈ 11.79\nx = (-5 - √721) / 2 ≈ -15.79\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with logarithms, the arguments (x + 3) and (x + 2) must be positive. Therefore, the negative value of x is not a valid solution.\n\nSo, the only valid solution is:\n\nx ≈ 11.79"
