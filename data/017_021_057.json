    "message_2": "To prove that the group G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C48, the alternating group A4 × C4, or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48, we will first analyze the given presentation and then compare it with the structures of the mentioned groups.\n\nThe presentation of G is given by:\n\nG = <a, b, c, d, e, f | a^24 = b^2 = c^2 = d^2 = e^2 = f^2 = abcdef = 1, ab = ba, ac = ca, ad = da, ae = ea, af = fa, bc = cb, bd = db, be = eb, bf = fb, cd = dc, ce = ec, cf = fc, de = ed, df = fd, ef = fe>\n\nFrom the presentation, we can observe the following:\n\n1. The order of a is 24, and the orders of b, c, d, e, and f are 2.\n2. All pairs of elements commute with each other, i.e., G is an abelian group.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structures of the mentioned groups:\n\n1. Cyclic group C48: This group has a single generator, say g, and all its elements can be written as powers of g. The order of g is 48. Since the order of a in G is 24, G cannot be isomorphic to C48.\n\n2. Alternating group A4 × C4: This group is a direct product of A4 and C4. A4 is a non-abelian group of order 12, and C4 is a cyclic group of order 4. However, G is an abelian group, so it cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C4.\n\n3. Non-abelian groups of order 48: There are 14 non-abelian groups of order 48. Since G is an abelian group, it cannot be isomorphic to any of these non-abelian groups.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that the group G is not isomorphic to the cyclic group C48, the alternating group A4 × C4, or any of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48."
