    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, width of 6 cm and height of 8 cm. Find the length of its diagonal.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism are length = 10 cm, width = 6 cm, and height = 8 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDiagonal length = √(10² + 6² + 8²)\nDiagonal length = √(100 + 36 + 64)\nDiagonal length = √(200)\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √(200) cm, which is approximately 14.14 cm."
