    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the hill as H1, the height of the tree as H2, and the distance from the bottom of the hill to the top of the tree as D. We are given that the angle of elevation from the bottom of the hill to the top of the tree is 45 degrees, and D = 100 meters.\n\nWe can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation, the height of the hill plus the height of the tree (H1 + H2), and the distance D:\n\ntan(45) = (H1 + H2) / D\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = (H1 + H2) / 100\n\nNow, we need to find the height of the hill (H1). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the height of the hill, the distance D, and the distance from the bottom of the hill to the base of the tree (let's call it B):\n\nH1^2 + B^2 = D^2\n\nSince the angle of elevation from the bottom of the hill to the top of the hill is also 45 degrees (because the angle of elevation from the bottom of the hill to the top of the tree is 45 degrees), we can use the tangent function again:\n\ntan(45) = H1 / B\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = H1 / B\n\nSo, H1 = B.\n\nNow, we can substitute H1 for B in the Pythagorean theorem equation:\n\nH1^2 + H1^2 = D^2\n2 * H1^2 = D^2\n\nWe are given that D = 100 meters:\n\n2 * H1^2 = 100^2\nH1^2 = 100^2 / 2\nH1^2 = 5000\nH1 = sqrt(5000)\nH1 ≈ 70.71 meters\n\nNow that we have the height of the hill, we can find the height of the tree (H2) using the equation we derived earlier:\n\n1 = (H1 + H2) / 100\n100 = H1 + H2\n100 = 70.71 + H2\nH2 = 100 - 70.71\nH2 ≈ 29.29 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tree is approximately 29.29 meters."
