    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE), we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution u(x, y, t) can be written as a product of three functions, one depending on x, one depending on y, and one depending on t:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nNow, substitute this into the PDE:\n\n∂u/∂t = 2∂^2u/∂x^2 + 3∂^2u/∂y^2\nX(x)Y(y)∂T(t)/∂t = 2X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + 3X(x)Y''(y)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t):\n\n(1/T(t))∂T(t)/∂t = (2/X(x))X''(x) + (3/Y(y))Y''(y)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\n(1/T(t))∂T(t)/∂t = -λ\n(2/X(x))X''(x) + (3/Y(y))Y''(y) = -λ\n\nNow, we have three ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve:\n\n1) T'(t) = -λT(t)\n2) X''(x) = -(λ/2)X(x)\n3) Y''(y) = -(λ/3)Y(y)\n\nThe general solutions for these ODEs are:\n\n1) T(t) = Ce^(-λt)\n2) X(x) = A*cos(√(λ/2)x) + B*sin(√(λ/2)x)\n3) Y(y) = D*cos(√(λ/3)y) + E*sin(√(λ/3)y)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants A, B, C, D, and E such that the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = sin(x) + cos(y) is satisfied:\n\nu(x, y, 0) = X(x)Y(y)T(0) = (A*cos(√(λ/2)x) + B*sin(√(λ/2)x))(D*cos(√(λ/3)y) + E*sin(√(λ/3)y))C\n\nSince T(0) = C ≠ 0, we have:\n\nsin(x) + cos(y) = (A*cos(√(λ/2)x) + B*sin(√(λ/2)x))(D*cos(√(λ/3)y) + E*sin(√(λ/3)y))\n\nBy comparing the terms, we can see that λ = 2 and λ = 3 are the only possible values that can satisfy the initial condition. Thus, we have:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(x) + B*sin(x)\nY(y) = D*cos(√3y) + E*sin(√3y)\n\nNow, we can find the constants A, B, D, and E by comparing the terms:\n\nA = 1, B = 0, D = 1, E = 0\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t) = cos(x)cos(√3y)Ce^(-2t)\n\nNow, we need to find the solution at t = 2:\n\nu(x, y, 2) = cos(x)cos(√3y)Ce^(-4)"
