    "message_2": "The Bat Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the echolocation behavior of microbats. It is used to find the global minimum of complex optimization problems. However, for this simple quadratic function, we can find the minimum value using basic calculus methods. \n\nTo find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3, we can first find its derivative and set it to zero to find the critical points.\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 4\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n2x - 4 = 0\nx = 2\n\nNow, we can find the second derivative to determine if this critical point is a minimum or maximum:\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, the critical point x = 2 is a minimum. Now, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging x = 2 back into the original function:\n\nf(2) = (2)^2 - 4(2) + 3\nf(2) = 4 - 8 + 3\nf(2) = -1\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 is -1."
