    "message_2": "To determine the isometries of the given metric, we need to find the transformations that preserve the distances between points on the surface of the sphere. The metric is given by:\n\nds^2 = 4(dθ^2 + sin^2(θ) dφ^2)\n\nThis is the metric for a sphere of radius 2 in spherical coordinates. The isometries of a sphere are the transformations that preserve the distances between points on the sphere. These are the rotations and reflections.\n\n1. Rotations:\n\na) Rotation about the z-axis (vertical axis) by an angle α:\n\nθ' = θ\nφ' = φ + α\n\nb) Rotation about the x-axis by an angle β:\n\nθ' = arccos(cos(θ)cos(β) - sin(θ)sin(β)cos(φ))\nφ' = arctan2(sin(θ)sin(φ), cos(θ)sin(β) + sin(θ)cos(β)cos(φ))\n\nc) Rotation about the y-axis by an angle γ:\n\nθ' = arccos(cos(θ)cos(γ) + sin(θ)sin(γ)cos(φ))\nφ' = arctan2(sin(θ)sin(γ) - cos(θ)sin(γ)cos(φ), sin(φ))\n\n2. Reflections:\n\na) Reflection through the xy-plane (equatorial plane):\n\nθ' = π - θ\nφ' = φ\n\nb) Reflection through the xz-plane:\n\nθ' = θ\nφ' = -φ\n\nc) Reflection through the yz-plane:\n\nθ' = π - θ\nφ' = π - φ\n\nThese are the isometries of the given metric on the surface of a sphere of radius 2."
