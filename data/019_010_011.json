    "message_2": "In linear logic, we cannot directly infer whether John studied hard or not just by knowing that he passed the exam. The given statement is an implication, which can be represented as A ‚ä∏ B, where A is \"John studies hard\" and B is \"John passes the exam.\" Knowing that John passed the exam (B is true) does not necessarily imply that A is true in linear logic. It is possible that there were other factors that contributed to John passing the exam."
