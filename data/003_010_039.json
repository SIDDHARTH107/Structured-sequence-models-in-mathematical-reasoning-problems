    "message_2": "To find how far up the wall the ladder reaches, we can use the sine function in trigonometry. The sine function relates the ratio of the opposite side (the height up the wall) to the hypotenuse (the length of the ladder) in a right triangle.\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this case, the angle is 60 degrees and the hypotenuse is 10 meters long. We want to find the opposite side (the height up the wall).\n\nsin(60) = opposite side / 10\n\nFirst, we need to find the sine of 60 degrees. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sine of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3 divided by 2.\n\nsin(60) = √3 / 2\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into our equation:\n\n(√3 / 2) = opposite side / 10\n\nTo solve for the opposite side, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10:\n\nopposite side = 10 * (√3 / 2)\n\nopposite side = 5√3\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of the opposite side (the height up the wall) by calculating 5 times the square root of 3:\n\nopposite side ≈ 5 * 1.732\n\nopposite side ≈ 8.66\n\nSo, the ladder reaches approximately 8.66 meters up the wall, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a meter."
