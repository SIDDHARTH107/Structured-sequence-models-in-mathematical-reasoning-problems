    "message_1": "A hospital wants to analyze the effectiveness of two different painkillers. They administer the first painkiller to 20 patients and the second painkiller to another 25 patients. The patients are asked to rate their pain on a scale of 1 to 10 after taking the painkiller. Using a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test, determine if there is a significant difference in the effectiveness of the two painkillers at a 95% confidence level.",
    "message_2": "To perform a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test, we need the data (pain ratings) for the two groups of patients. Since the data is not provided, I will assume that we have the data and will guide you through the steps to perform the test.\n\n1. Combine the data from both groups and rank them from lowest to highest. Assign the same rank to tied values and average the ranks for the tied values.\n\n2. Calculate the sum of the ranks for each group (R1 for the first painkiller group and R2 for the second painkiller group).\n\n3. Calculate the expected rank sum for each group under the null hypothesis (no difference between the two painkillers). The expected rank sum for group 1 (E(R1)) is n1(n1 + n2 + 1) / 2, where n1 is the number of patients in group 1 (20 in this case) and n2 is the number of patients in group 2 (25 in this case). Similarly, calculate E(R2) for group 2.\n\n4. Calculate the variance of the rank sum for each group. The variance for group 1 (Var(R1)) is n1 * n2 * (n1 + n2 + 1) / 12. Similarly, calculate Var(R2) for group 2.\n\n5. Calculate the z-score for each group. The z-score for group 1 (z1) is (R1 - E(R1)) / sqrt(Var(R1)). Similarly, calculate z2 for group 2.\n\n6. Determine the critical z-value for a 95% confidence level. For a two-tailed test, the critical z-value is approximately Â±1.96.\n\n7. Compare the calculated z-scores to the critical z-value. If either z1 or z2 is greater than 1.96 or less than -1.96, there is a significant difference in the effectiveness of the two painkillers at a 95% confidence level.\n\nPlease provide the pain ratings for the two groups of patients, and I can help you perform the calculations and interpret the results."
