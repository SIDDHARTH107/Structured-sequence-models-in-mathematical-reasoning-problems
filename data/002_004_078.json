    "message_1": "A rectangular garden has a length of 10 meters and a width of 5 meters. What is the perimeter of the garden?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).\n\nIn this case, the length is 10 meters and the width is 5 meters. So, we plug in the values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2(10 + 5) = 2(15) = 30 meters.\n\nThe perimeter of the garden is 30 meters."
