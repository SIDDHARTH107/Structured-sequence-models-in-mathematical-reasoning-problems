    "message_2": "There are five non-isomorphic groups of order 60. These are:\n\n1. Cyclic group C_60\n2. Dihedral group D_30\n3. The alternating group A_5\n4. The direct product of C_3 and A_4, denoted as C_3 x A_4\n5. The direct product of C_5 and A_4, denoted as C_5 x A_4\n\nNow, let's determine which of these groups have subgroups of order 30:\n\n1. C_60: This group has a subgroup of order 30, which is also a cyclic group, denoted as C_30.\n2. D_30: This group has a subgroup of order 30, which is a cyclic group, denoted as C_30.\n3. A_5: This group does not have a subgroup of order 30 since the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group, and 30 does not divide 60.\n4. C_3 x A_4: This group does not have a subgroup of order 30 since the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group, and 30 does not divide 60.\n5. C_5 x A_4: This group does not have a subgroup of order 30 since the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group, and 30 does not divide 60.\n\nSo, out of the five non-isomorphic groups of order 60, only the cyclic group C_60 and the dihedral group D_30 have subgroups of order 30."
