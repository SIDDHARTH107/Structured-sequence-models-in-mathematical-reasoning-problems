    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the fact that the number of groups of order n is given by the number of conjugacy classes of the symmetric group S_n. \n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of 120: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the number of groups of order n:\n\nNumber of groups of order 120 = number of conjugacy classes of S_120 = number of partitions of 120 into powers of its prime factors.\n\nThe partitions of 120 into powers of its prime factors are:\n\n1. 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. 2^2 * 3^2 * 5\n3. 2 * 3^3 * 5\n4. 2^4 * 3 * 5\n5. 2^3 * 3^2 * 5\n6. 2^2 * 3 * 5^2\n7. 2 * 3^2 * 5^2\n8. 2^3 * 3 * 5^2\n\nThere are 8 partitions, which means there are 8 groups of order 120. However, we need to exclude the groups isomorphic to the cyclic group C120 and the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2.\n\nThe cyclic group C120 corresponds to the partition 2^3 * 3 * 5, and the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2 corresponds to the partition 2^2 * 3 * 5. \n\nSo, after excluding these two groups, there are 8 - 2 = 6 non-isomorphic groups of order 120 that are not isomorphic to the cyclic group C120 or the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2."
