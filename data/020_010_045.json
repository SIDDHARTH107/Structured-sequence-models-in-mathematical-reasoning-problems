    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit for product A is $10 and for product B is $15. Each product requires a certain amount of resources, such that product A requires 2 units of resource X and 1 unit of resource Y while product B requires 3 units of resource X and 2 units of resource Y. The company has a total of 50 units of resource X and 30 units of resource Y. The demand for product A is 20 units, and for product B is 15 units. However, due to market unpredictability, the demand for each product may vary by ±10%. What is the maximum profit that the company can guarantee, considering the uncertainty of the market?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum guaranteed profit, we need to consider the minimum demand for each product, which is 90% of the given demand.\n\nMinimum demand for product A: 20 * 0.9 = 18 units\nMinimum demand for product B: 15 * 0.9 = 13.5 units (rounded up to 14 units, since we cannot produce a fraction of a product)\n\nNow, we need to check if the company has enough resources to produce these minimum quantities.\n\nResource X required for product A: 18 * 2 = 36 units\nResource X required for product B: 14 * 3 = 42 units\nTotal resource X required: 36 + 42 = 78 units (which is more than the available 50 units)\n\nSince the company does not have enough resource X to produce the minimum demand for both products, we need to find the optimal production combination that maximizes profit while staying within the resource constraints.\n\nLet's denote the number of product A produced as x and the number of product B produced as y. The resource constraints can be written as:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 50 (resource X constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 30 (resource Y constraint)\n\nWe also have the demand constraints:\n\nx ≥ 18 (minimum demand for product A)\ny ≥ 14 (minimum demand for product B)\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\n\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nTo find the optimal production combination, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints on a graph and finding the feasible region. Then, we can analyze the vertices of the feasible region to find the maximum profit.\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the intersection of the constraints:\n\nx ≥ 18\ny ≥ 14\n2x + 3y ≤ 50\nx + 2y ≤ 30\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\n\nA: (18, 14)\nB: (20, 10)\nC: (10, 10)\n\nNow, we calculate the profit for each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 10 * 18 + 15 * 14 = 180 + 210 = $390\nP(B) = 10 * 20 + 15 * 10 = 200 + 150 = $350\nP(C) = 10 * 10 + 15 * 10 = 100 + 150 = $250\n\nThe maximum guaranteed profit is at vertex A, with a profit of $390."
