    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) and {5}, denoted as (A △ B) × {5}. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A △ B) × {5} = {(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian products of A × {5} and B × {5}:\n\nA × {5} = {(1, 5), (2, 5)}\nB × {5} = {(3, 5), (4, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A × {5}) and (B × {5}), denoted as (A × {5}) △ (B × {5}). \n\n(A × {5}) △ (B × {5}) = {(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)}\n\nComparing the two sets we found:\n\n(A △ B) × {5} = {(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)}\n(A × {5}) △ (B × {5}) = {(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)}\n\nIn this particular case, (A △ B) × {5} is equal to (A × {5}) △ (B × {5}). However, this does not prove that the Cartesian product is associative with respect to symmetric difference in general. In fact, it is not associative. Let's consider another example to show this:\n\nLet C = {1} and D = {2}. Then:\n\nC △ D = {1, 2}\n(C △ D) × {5} = {(1, 5), (2, 5)}\n\nC × {5} = {(1, 5)}\nD × {5} = {(2, 5)}\n(C × {5}) △ (D × {5}) = {(1, 5), (2, 5)}\n\nIn this case, (C △ D) × {5} is also equal to (C × {5}) △ (D × {5}). However, if we change the second set in the Cartesian product, the result will be different:\n\n(C △ D) × {3, 5} = {(1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 5)}\n\nC × {3, 5} = {(1, 3), (1, 5)}\nD × {3, 5} = {(2, 3), (2, 5)}\n(C × {3, 5}) △ (D × {3, 5}) = {(1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 5)}\n\nIn this case, (C △ D) × {3, 5} is equal to (C × {3, 5}) △ (D × {3, 5}). However, if we change the second set in the Cartesian product, the result will be different:\n\n(C △ D) × {3, 4} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nC × {3, 4} = {(1, 3), (1, 4)}\nD × {3, 4} = {(2, 3), (2, 4)}\n(C × {3, 4}) △ (D × {3, 4}) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nIn this case, (C △ D) × {3, 4} is not equal to (C × {3, 4}) △ (D × {3, 4}). This shows that the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to symmetric difference in general."
