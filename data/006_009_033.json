    "message_2": "The probability of randomly selecting a person from a population of 10,000 individuals and having them be diagnosed with a certain medical condition with a prevalence rate of 3% can be calculated as follows:\n\nProbability = (Number of individuals with the medical condition) / (Total population)\n\nSince the prevalence rate is 3%, there are 3% of 10,000 individuals with the medical condition:\n\nNumber of individuals with the medical condition = 0.03 * 10,000 = 300\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nProbability = 300 / 10,000 = 0.03 or 3%\n\nSo, the probability of randomly selecting a person from the population and having them be diagnosed with the medical condition is 3%."
