    "message_2": "To calculate the frequency at which the waves propagate through the liquid layer, we can use the formula:\n\nFrequency (f) = Velocity (v) / Wavelength (λ)\n\nFirst, we need to find the wavelength. Since the liquid layer has a thickness of 0.25 cm, we can assume that the wavelength is twice the thickness (as the wave travels up and down through the layer). Therefore, the wavelength (λ) is 0.5 cm.\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency:\n\nf = v / λ\nf = 500 cm/s / 0.5 cm\nf = 1000 Hz\n\nThe frequency at which the waves propagate through the liquid layer is 1000 Hz.\n\nNow, let's find the wave equation for the liquid layer using the Fourier Transform. The wave equation can be represented as:\n\nΨ(x, t) = A * sin(kx - ωt)\n\nwhere Ψ(x, t) is the wave function, A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, x is the position, ω is the angular frequency, and t is the time.\n\nThe wave number (k) can be calculated as:\n\nk = 2π / λ\n\nSubstituting the value of λ:\n\nk = 2π / 0.5 cm\nk = 4π cm^(-1)\n\nThe angular frequency (ω) can be calculated as:\n\nω = 2π * f\n\nSubstituting the value of f:\n\nω = 2π * 1000 Hz\nω = 2000π Hz\n\nNow, we can write the wave equation as:\n\nΨ(x, t) = A * sin(4πx - 2000πt)\n\nTo find the Fourier Transform of the wave equation, we can use the following formula:\n\nΨ(k, ω) = ∫∫ Ψ(x, t) * e^(-i(kx - ωt)) dx dt\n\nHowever, solving this integral is quite complex and requires advanced mathematical techniques. Therefore, we will leave the Fourier Transform of the wave equation in its general form:\n\nΨ(k, ω) = ∫∫ A * sin(4πx - 2000πt) * e^(-i(kx - ωt)) dx dt"
