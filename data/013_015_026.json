    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a math problem related to the Principal-Agent Problem in game theory:\n\nSuppose a principal hires an agent to produce a product. The agent's effort level (in hours) affects the quality of the product. The principal cannot directly observe the agent's effort level but can observe the product's quality. The agent's cost of effort is $10 per hour. If the product's quality is high, the principal will sell the product for $100 with probability 0.9; if the product quality is low, the principal will sell the product for $50 with probability 0.6. Assuming a risk-neutral principal, what is the agent's optimal effort level?",
    "message_2": "To find the agent's optimal effort level, we need to determine the effort level that maximizes the principal's expected profit, taking into account the agent's cost of effort.\n\nLet e be the agent's effort level (in hours). The agent's cost of effort is 10e.\n\nLet H be the event that the product quality is high, and L be the event that the product quality is low. We have:\n\nP(H|e) = 0.9e\nP(L|e) = 1 - 0.9e\n\nThe principal's expected profit is given by:\n\nE(Profit|e) = P(H|e) * 100 + P(L|e) * 50 - 10e\n\nSubstituting the probabilities:\n\nE(Profit|e) = (0.9e * 100) + ((1 - 0.9e) * 50) - 10e\n\nNow, we need to find the effort level e that maximizes the expected profit. To do this, we can take the derivative of the expected profit with respect to e and set it to zero:\n\ndE(Profit|e)/de = 90 - 40 - 10 = 0\n\nSolving for e:\n\ne = 50/50 = 1\n\nSo, the agent's optimal effort level is 1 hour."
