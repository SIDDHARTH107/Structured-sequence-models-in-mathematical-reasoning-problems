Using fuzzy logic, determine the degree of membership of the statement \"Today's production will be high\". The membership function for \"high production\" is defined as a triangle with its base ranging from 500 to 1000 units and its peak at 800 units.",
    "message_2": "To determine the degree of membership of the statement \"Today's production will be high\" using fuzzy logic, we need to calculate the membership value for the given triangular membership function.\n\nThe triangular membership function can be defined as:\n\nμ(x) = (x - a) / (b - a) for a ≤ x ≤ b\nμ(x) = (c - x) / (c - b) for b ≤ x ≤ c\nμ(x) = 0 otherwise\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the vertices of the triangle, and x is the input value.\n\nIn this case, the triangular membership function for \"high production\" has vertices a = 500, b = 800, and c = 1000.\n\nLet's assume today's production is X units. We can calculate the degree of membership for \"high production\" using the membership function:\n\n1. If X < 500 or X > 1000, then μ(X) = 0 (production is not considered high)\n2. If 500 ≤ X ≤ 800, then μ(X) = (X - 500) / (800 - 500)\n3. If 800 ≤ X ≤ 1000, then μ(X) = (1000 - X) / (1000 - 800)\n\nThe degree of membership of the statement \"Today's production will be high\" will be the value of μ(X) for the given production amount X."
