    "message_1": "A group of 6 friends are going on a road trip across the country. They have a list of 10 cities they want to visit and they want to plan their route to minimize the total distance they will travel. Using combinatorial optimization, what is the shortest possible distance they can travel if they visit all 10 cities exactly once? Assume that the distances between every pair of cities are known.",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance to travel while visiting all 10 cities exactly once, we can use the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) approach. However, without the actual distances between the cities, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. \n\nTo solve the TSP, you can use various algorithms and optimization techniques such as the nearest neighbor algorithm, branch and bound, dynamic programming, or genetic algorithms. These methods will help you find an optimal or near-optimal solution for the shortest possible distance to travel while visiting all 10 cities exactly once. Once you have the distances between every pair of cities, you can apply one of these algorithms to find the shortest possible distance."
