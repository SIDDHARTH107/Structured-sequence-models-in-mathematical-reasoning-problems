    "message_2": "To find the value of f(2) using the Fourier transform, we need to compute the inverse Fourier transform of F(ω). The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\nf(t) = (1/2π) ∫ F(ω) * e^(jωt) dω\n\nwhere the integral is taken over the entire frequency domain (-∞ to ∞). In this case, F(ω) = 4/(jω + 4). So, we need to compute:\n\nf(t) = (1/2π) ∫ (4/(jω + 4)) * e^(jωt) dω\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the residue theorem from complex analysis. First, we need to find the poles of the integrand. The integrand has a pole at ω = -4j. Since this pole is in the lower half-plane, we can close the contour in the lower half-plane and use the residue theorem.\n\nThe residue at ω = -4j is given by:\n\nResidue = lim_(ω -> -4j) (ω + 4j) * (4/(jω + 4)) * e^(jωt)\n        = 4 * e^(-4jt)\n\nNow, we can use the residue theorem to compute the integral:\n\nf(t) = (1/2π) * 2πi * (-4 * e^(-4jt))\n     = -4i * e^(-4jt)\n\nFinally, we want to find the value of f(2):\n\nf(2) = -4i * e^(-8j)\n\nf(2) = -4i * (cos(-8) + j*sin(-8))\n\nf(2) = -4i * (cos(8) - j*sin(8))\n\nMultiplying by -4i:\n\nf(2) = 4 * (sin(8) + j*cos(8))\n\nSince f(t) is a real function, the imaginary part should be zero. Therefore, the value of f(2) is:\n\nf(2) = 4 * sin(8)"
