    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5. The derivative f'(x) = 3x^2 - 2.\n\nThe Newton-Raphson formula is: x1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nLet's start with the initial guess x0 = 2.\n\n1st iteration:\nx1 = 2 - ( (2^3 - 2*2 - 5) / (3*(2^2) - 2) )\nx1 = 2 - ( (8 - 4 - 5) / (12 - 2) )\nx1 = 2 - ( -1 / 10 )\nx1 = 2 + 0.1\nx1 = 2.1\n\nNow, we'll use x1 as our new guess and repeat the process until we reach the desired accuracy (3 decimal places).\n\n2nd iteration:\nx2 = 2.1 - ( (2.1^3 - 2*2.1 - 5) / (3*(2.1^2) - 2) )\nx2 ≈ 2.094\n\n3rd iteration:\nx3 = 2.094 - ( (2.094^3 - 2*2.094 - 5) / (3*(2.094^2) - 2) )\nx3 ≈ 2.094\n\nSince x2 and x3 are the same up to 3 decimal places, we can conclude that the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5 using the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of x0 = 2 is approximately x ≈ 2.094."
