    "message_1": "A particle with mass 0.1 kg is in a potential energy field represented by the function $V(x) = x^2$, where $x$ is in meters. The particle is in a state described by the wave function $\\Psi(x)=c(2x-x^2)$, where $c$ is a normalization constant. Calculate the value of c so that the wave function is properly normalized, and determine the probability that the particle will be found at $x=1$.",
    "message_2": "To normalize the wave function, we need to find the value of c such that the integral of the square of the wave function over all space is equal to 1. In other words, we need to solve the following equation:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\Psi(x)|^2 dx = 1$$\n\nSince the potential energy function is $V(x) = x^2$, the particle is confined to the region where $x \\geq 0$. Also, the wave function $\\Psi(x) = c(2x - x^2)$ is zero at $x = 0$ and $x = 2$. Therefore, we can rewrite the normalization condition as:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{2} |c(2x - x^2)|^2 dx = 1$$\n\nNow, let's find the integral:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{2} c^2 (2x - x^2)^2 dx = c^2 \\int_{0}^{2} (4x^2 - 4x^3 + x^4) dx$$\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we find the antiderivative:\n\n$$c^2 \\left[\\frac{4}{3}x^3 - x^4 + \\frac{1}{5}x^5\\right]_0^2 = c^2 \\left[\\frac{32}{3} - 16 + \\frac{32}{5}\\right]$$\n\nNow, we set this equal to 1 and solve for c:\n\n$$c^2 \\left[\\frac{32}{3} - 16 + \\frac{32}{5}\\right] = 1$$\n\n$$c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\left[\\frac{32}{3} - 16 + \\frac{32}{5}\\right]}$$\n\n$$c = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\left[\\frac{32}{3} - 16 + \\frac{32}{5}\\right]}}$$\n\nNow that we have the normalization constant c, we can find the probability of finding the particle at $x = 1$. The probability density is given by $|\\Psi(x)|^2$. So, we have:\n\n$$P(x=1) = |\\Psi(1)|^2 = |c(2 - 1)|^2 = c^2$$\n\nSubstituting the value of c we found earlier:\n\n$$P(x=1) = \\frac{1}{\\left[\\frac{32}{3} - 16 + \\frac{32}{5}\\right]}$$\n\nSo, the probability of finding the particle at $x = 1$ is:\n\n$$P(x=1) = \\frac{1}{\\left[\\frac{32}{3} - 16 + \\frac{32}{5}\\right]}$$"
