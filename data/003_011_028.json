    "message_1": "A radio tower is 80 meters tall. From the top of the tower, an observer measures the angle of depression to a point on the ground to be 25 degrees. What is the distance between the tower and the point on the ground, to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the tower and the point on the ground, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. Let's denote the distance between the tower and the point on the ground as x.\n\nThe angle of depression is 25 degrees, which means the angle of elevation from the point on the ground to the top of the tower is also 25 degrees. We can set up the following equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(25°) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(25°) = (80 meters) / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 80 meters / tan(25°)\nx ≈ 80 meters / 0.4663\nx ≈ 171.6 meters\n\nTo the nearest meter, the distance between the tower and the point on the ground is approximately 172 meters."
