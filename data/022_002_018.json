    "message_2": "To find the conformal mapping, we can use the Möbius transformation. A Möbius transformation has the form:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $ad - bc \\neq 0$. We are given that $-1$ is mapped to $0$, so:\n\n$$0 = \\frac{a(-1) + b}{c(-1) + d}$$\n\nwhich implies that $b = d$. Now we need to find the image of the point $1$ under this conformal mapping. Since the unit disk is mapped to the upper half plane, the point $1$ must be mapped to $\\infty$. Therefore:\n\n$$\\infty = \\frac{a(1) + b}{c(1) + d}$$\n\nwhich implies that $a + b = 0$. Now we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + b}$$\n\nwith $a = -b$. We can choose $a = 1$ and $b = -1$ without loss of generality, so the conformal mapping is:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z - 1}{cz - 1}$$\n\nWe need to find the value of $c$ such that the unit circle is mapped to the upper half plane. We know that the imaginary part of $f(z)$ must be positive for $z$ on the unit circle. Let $z = e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. Then:\n\n$$f(e^{i\\theta}) = \\frac{e^{i\\theta} - 1}{ce^{i\\theta} - 1}$$\n\nThe imaginary part of $f(e^{i\\theta})$ is:\n\n$$\\operatorname{Im}(f(e^{i\\theta})) = \\frac{(1 - c)\\sin\\theta}{(1 - c\\cos\\theta)^2 + (c\\sin\\theta)^2}$$\n\nFor this to be positive for all $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, we must have $c = 1$. So the conformal mapping is:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z - 1}{z - 1} = 1$$\n\nNow we can find the image of the point $i$ under this conformal mapping:\n\n$$f(i) = \\frac{i - 1}{i - 1} = 1$$\n\nSo the image of the point $i$ under this conformal mapping is $1$."
