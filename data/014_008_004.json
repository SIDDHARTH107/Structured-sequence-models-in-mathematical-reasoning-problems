    "message_2": "To encode all possible combinations of 64-bit message blocks using a block cipher, you would need a key size of at least 64 bits. This is because a 64-bit key can have 2^64 different combinations, which is enough to uniquely encode or decode each of the 2^64 possible 64-bit message blocks."
