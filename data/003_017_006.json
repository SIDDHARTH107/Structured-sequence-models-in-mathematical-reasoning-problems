    "message_2": "To find the average height of the particle during one complete revolution, we need to integrate the height function over one period and then divide by the length of that period.\n\nThe period of the circular motion is given by the reciprocal of the frequency. Since the frequency is 2 revolutions per second, the period is 1/2 second.\n\nNow, we need to integrate the height function h(t) = 5 sin(4πt) over one period, which is from t = 0 to t = 1/2:\n\n∫(5 sin(4πt)) dt from 0 to 1/2\n\nTo integrate this function, we can use the substitution method. Let u = 4πt, so du/dt = 4π and dt = du/(4π).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\n∫(5 sin(u)) (du/(4π)) from u = 0 to u = 2π\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\n(5/(4π)) ∫(sin(u)) du from 0 to 2π\n\nThe integral of sin(u) is -cos(u), so we have:\n\n(5/(4π)) [-cos(u)] from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n(5/(4π))[-cos(2π) + cos(0)]\n\ncos(2π) = 1 and cos(0) = 1, so we have:\n\n(5/(4π))[-1 + 1] = 0\n\nSince the integral is 0, the average height of the particle during one complete revolution is 0. This makes sense because the particle is moving in a sinusoidal motion, and the positive and negative heights cancel each other out over one complete revolution."
