    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid, we will use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the area of each disk formed by the rotation of the region around the y-axis. The area of each disk is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the disk.\n\nSince we are rotating around the y-axis, we need to express x in terms of y. From the equation y = x^2, we can solve for x:\n\nx = sqrt(y)\n\nNow, the radius of each disk is given by the x-coordinate, which is sqrt(y). So, the area of each disk is:\n\nA(y) = π(sqrt(y))^2 = πy\n\nNow, we need to integrate the area function A(y) with respect to y over the interval [0, 4]:\n\nVolume = ∫[0, 4] A(y) dy = ∫[0, 4] πy dy\n\nTo integrate, we use the power rule:\n\n∫y dy = (1/2)y^2 + C\n\nSo, the volume is:\n\nVolume = π[(1/2)(4)^2 - (1/2)(0)^2] = π[8 - 0] = 8π\n\nThus, the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by the curves y = x^2, x = 0, and y = 4 about the y-axis is 8π cubic units."
