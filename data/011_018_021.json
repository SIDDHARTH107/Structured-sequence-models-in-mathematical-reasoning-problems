    "message_1": "Consider a block design with 8 points and 4 blocks, each block having 3 points. If each pair of points occurs together exactly once, then how many pairs of points are there in total?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of pairs of points, we can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of points and k is the size of the pairs we want to form.\n\nIn this case, n = 8 (total points) and k = 2 (pairs of points). So, the total number of pairs of points is:\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!)\n= 8! / (2!6!)\n= (8 × 7 × 6!)/(2 × 6!)\n= (8 × 7)/2\n= 28\n\nThere are 28 pairs of points in total."
