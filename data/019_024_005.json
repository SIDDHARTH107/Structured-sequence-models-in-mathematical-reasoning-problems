    "message_2": "Abductive logic is not used for calculating probabilities. However, we can determine if the number 51 is divisible by 3 by simply dividing it by 3.\n\n51 รท 3 = 17\n\nSince 51 is divisible by 3 with no remainder, it is indeed divisible by 3. The probability of a fact being true is either 0 or 1, and in this case, since 51 is divisible by 3, the probability is 1 (or 100%)."
