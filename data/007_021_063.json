    "message_2": "To find a nontrivial factor of n = 105927 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) modulo n. A common choice is f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod n.\n2. Choose a random starting value x_0.\n3. Iterate the function to generate a sequence of values: x_1 = f(x_0), x_2 = f(x_1), ...\n4. Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x_i - x_(2i)| and n for increasing i until a nontrivial factor is found.\n\nLet's choose x_0 = 2 and use f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod 105927.\n\nNow, we will generate the sequence and compute the GCD:\n\ni = 1:\nx_1 = f(x_0) = (2^2 + 1) mod 105927 = 5\nx_2 = f(x_1) = (5^2 + 1) mod 105927 = 26\nGCD(|x_1 - x_2|, 105927) = GCD(|5 - 26|, 105927) = GCD(21, 105927) = 3\n\nWe found a nontrivial factor: 3. Therefore, 3 is a factor of 105927. To find the other factor, we can divide 105927 by 3:\n\n105927 / 3 = 35309\n\nSo, the nontrivial factors of 105927 are 3 and 35309."
