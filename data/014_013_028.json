Let the key matrix be: \n\n[3 2]\n\n[5 7] \n\nNote: In Hill cipher, the plaintext is divided into blocks of fixed size, and then each block is multiplied by a key matrix modulo a certain number (usually 26 for the English alphabet). The resulting values are then converted back into letters to produce the ciphertext.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext \"MATH\" using the Hill cipher method with the given 2x2 encryption matrix, we first need to convert the letters into numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25):\n\nM = 12\nA = 0\nT = 19\nH = 7\n\nNow, we divide the plaintext into blocks of size 2:\n\nBlock 1: [12 0]\nBlock 2: [19 7]\n\nNext, we multiply each block by the key matrix modulo 26:\n\nKey matrix:\n[3 2]\n[5 7]\n\nBlock 1:\n[12 0] * [3 2] = [36 0] (mod 26) = [10 0]\n          [5 7]\n\nBlock 2:\n[19 7] * [3 2] = [57 14] (mod 26) = [5 14]\n          [5 7]\n\nNow, we convert the resulting values back into letters:\n\n10 -> K\n0 -> A\n5 -> F\n14 -> O\n\nSo, the ciphertext for the plaintext \"MATH\" using the given key matrix is \"KAFO\"."
