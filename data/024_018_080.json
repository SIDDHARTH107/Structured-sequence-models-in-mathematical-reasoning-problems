    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface at the given point, we first need to find the Gaussian curvature. The Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula:\n\nK = det(II)/det(I),\n\nwhere I and II are the first and second fundamental forms of the surface, respectively.\n\nFirst, we need to find the normal vector N to the surface at the given point (1,1,sqrt(2)). The gradient of the function f(x,y,z) gives the normal vector:\n\n∇f(x,y,z) = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\nAt the point (1,1,sqrt(2)), the normal vector N is:\n\nN = (2, 2, 2sqrt(2))\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients of the first fundamental form (I):\n\nE = v • v = (1,1,0) • (1,1,0) = 2\nF = v • w = (1,1,0) • (-1,1,0) = 0\nG = w • w = (-1,1,0) • (-1,1,0) = 2\n\nThe first fundamental form I is:\n\nI = | E  F |\n    | F  G |\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficients of the second fundamental form (II). We can find these by taking the second derivatives of the surface function f(x,y,z) and evaluating them at the given point:\n\nL = v • ∇²f(N) • v = (1,1,0) • (4, 4, 4) • (1,1,0) = 8\nM = v • ∇²f(N) • w = (1,1,0) • (4, 4, 4) • (-1,1,0) = 0\nN = w • ∇²f(N) • w = (-1,1,0) • (4, 4, 4) • (-1,1,0) = 8\n\nThe second fundamental form II is:\n\nII = | L  M |\n     | M  N |\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = det(II)/det(I) = (8*8 - 0*0)/(2*2 - 0*0) = 64/4 = 16\n\nThe sectional curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,sqrt(2)) with tangent vectors v and w is 16."
