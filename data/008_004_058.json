    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the third equation is a multiple of the first equation (2x + 4y - 6z = 2*(x + 2y - 3z)). This means that the third equation does not provide any new information, and we can ignore it. Now we have the following system of linear equations:\n\nx + 2y - 3z = 0\n3x - 2y - z = 0\n\nWe can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. We will use the elimination method. Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x the same:\n\n3(x + 2y - 3z) = 3(0)\n1(3x - 2y - z) = 1(0)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n3x + 6y - 9z = 0\n3x - 2y - z = 0\n\nNow subtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n(3x + 6y - 9z) - (3x - 2y - z) = 0 - 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n8y - 8z = 0\n\nNow divide both sides by 8:\n\ny - z = 0\n\nNow we have y = z. Since we have infinitely many solutions, we can express the solution in terms of a parameter, let's say t:\n\ny = t\nz = t\n\nNow we can substitute y back into the first equation:\n\nx + 2y - 3z = 0\nx + 2t - 3t = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nx - t = 0\n\nSo, x = t.\n\nThe general solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is:\n\nx = t\ny = t\nz = t\n\nWhere t is any real number."
