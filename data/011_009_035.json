    "message_2": "To partition a set of n distinct elements into non-empty subsets, we can use the Bell number, which is denoted as B(n). The Bell number can be calculated using the Bell triangle or through the Dobinski's formula. However, for small values of n, it's easier to use the known Bell numbers.\n\nThe first few Bell numbers are:\nB(0) = 1\nB(1) = 1\nB(2) = 2\nB(3) = 5\nB(4) = 15\nB(5) = 52\nB(6) = 203\n\nSo, there are 203 ways to partition a set of 6 distinct elements into non-empty subsets."
