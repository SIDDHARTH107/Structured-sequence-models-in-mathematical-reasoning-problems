Find the minimum number of triangles we can create if we are only allowed to use edges of the triangle and the midpoints of those edges as vertices of the smaller triangles.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the number of smaller triangles, we can connect the midpoints of the edges of triangle ABC. Let's label the midpoints as follows: D is the midpoint of AB, E is the midpoint of BC, and F is the midpoint of AC.\n\nNow, connect the points D, E, and F to form a triangle DEF inside the triangle ABC. This divides the triangle ABC into 4 smaller triangles: ADF, DFE, EFB, and BDE.\n\nSo, the minimum number of triangles we can create is 4."
