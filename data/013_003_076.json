    "message_1": "In the Ultimatum Game, Player A is given $10 and can offer any amount to Player B, who can either accept or reject the offer. If Player B accepts, the money is split according to the offer. If Player B rejects the offer, both players receive nothing. If Player A proposes to keep $7 and offer $3 to Player B, what is the probability that Player B will accept the offer?",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot provide a specific probability for Player B accepting the offer without any additional information about the players' preferences, strategies, or historical data. The Ultimatum Game involves human decision-making, which can be influenced by various factors such as fairness, rationality, and risk aversion.\n\nHowever, if we assume that Player B is rational and only cares about maximizing their own monetary gain, they should accept any offer greater than $0, as receiving some money is better than receiving nothing. In this case, the probability of Player B accepting the $3 offer would be 1 (or 100%).\n\nOn the other hand, if Player B values fairness and is willing to reject offers they perceive as unfair, the probability of accepting the $3 offer could be lower. This would depend on Player B's individual preferences and their perception of a fair split."
