    "message_2": "To find the current in the circuit at time t=0.025 seconds, we first need to find the impedance (Z) of the circuit. The impedance of an RLC circuit is given by:\n\nZ = √(R^2 + (XL - XC)^2)\n\nwhere XL is the inductive reactance and XC is the capacitive reactance. XL and XC can be calculated using the following formulas:\n\nXL = 2 * π * f * L\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * f * C)\n\nGiven the values R=4 ohms, L=2 H, C=1/4 F, and f=50 Hz, we can calculate XL and XC:\n\nXL = 2 * π * 50 * 2 = 628.32 ohms\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * 50 * 1/4) = 1.273 ohms\n\nNow we can calculate the impedance Z:\n\nZ = √(4^2 + (628.32 - 1.273)^2) = √(16 + 627.047^2) ≈ 627.05 ohms\n\nNow that we have the impedance, we can find the current in the circuit. The voltage source has an amplitude of 10 V and a frequency of 50 Hz, so the instantaneous voltage at time t=0.025 seconds is:\n\nV(t) = 10 * sin(2 * π * 50 * 0.025) = 10 * sin(π) = 0 V\n\nSince the instantaneous voltage at t=0.025 seconds is 0 V, the current in the circuit at this time is also 0 A."
