The probabilities of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$ after one step are given by the following matrix:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.2 & 0.8 & 0\\\\\n0.1 & 0.4 & 0.5\\\\\n0.3 & 0.6 & 0.1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\n\nwhere the rows represent the initial states and the columns represent the final states.
