    "message_2": "To find the value of p that maximizes Player 1's expected payoff, we first need to find the expected payoff for Player 1 when playing U with probability p and D with probability 1-p against Player 2's strategies L and R.\n\nLet q be the probability that Player 2 plays strategy L and (1-q) be the probability that Player 2 plays strategy R. The expected payoff for Player 1 when playing U with probability p and D with probability 1-p is given by:\n\nExpected Payoff = p * ( -3q + 5(1-q) ) + (1-p) * ( 7q -1(1-q) )\n\nNow, we need to find the value of p that maximizes this expression. To do this, we can take the derivative of the expected payoff with respect to p and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Expected Payoff)/dp = -3q + 5(1-q) - 7q + 1(1-q) = 0\n\nSolving for q, we get:\n\nq = 1/3\n\nNow, we can plug this value of q back into the expected payoff expression:\n\nExpected Payoff = p * ( -3(1/3) + 5(1-(1/3)) ) + (1-p) * ( 7(1/3) -1(1-(1/3)) )\n\nExpected Payoff = p * ( -1 + 10/3 ) + (1-p) * ( 7/3 - 2/3 )\n\nExpected Payoff = p * (7/3) + (1-p) * (5/3)\n\nNow, we can take the derivative of the expected payoff with respect to p and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Expected Payoff)/dp = 7/3 - 10/3 = 0\n\nHowever, this equation has no solution for p. This means that the expected payoff is not maximized for any specific value of p. Instead, we can analyze the expected payoff expression directly:\n\nExpected Payoff = p * (7/3) + (1-p) * (5/3)\n\nAs p increases from 0 to 1, the expected payoff increases from 5/3 to 7/3. Therefore, to maximize the expected payoff, Player 1 should always play strategy D (i.e., p = 0). In this case, the expected payoff for Player 1 is 7/3."
