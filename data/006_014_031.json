    "message_1": "A computer system has 5 components, each of which works independently with a probability of 0.95. Find the probability that at least one component will fail.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one component will fail, we can first find the probability that all components will work and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single component works is 0.95. Since the components work independently, the probability that all 5 components work is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(all components work) = 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.95^5 ≈ 0.7737809375\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one component will fail by subtracting the probability that all components work from 1:\n\nP(at least one component fails) = 1 - P(all components work) ≈ 1 - 0.7737809375 ≈ 0.2262190625\n\nSo, the probability that at least one component will fail is approximately 0.2262 or 22.62%."
