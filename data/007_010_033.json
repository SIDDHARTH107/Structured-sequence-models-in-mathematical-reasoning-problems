    "message_1": "Suppose a number when divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1, and when divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 2. What is the smallest possible positive number that satisfies both of these conditions according to the Chinese remainder theorem?",
    "message_2": "Let the number be x. According to the Chinese remainder theorem, we have the following system of linear congruences:\n\nx ≡ 1 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 4)\n\nTo solve this system, we first find the modular inverses. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12. We have:\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, we multiply each congruence by the modular inverse of the other:\n\nx ≡ 1 * 4 (mod 3 * 4)\nx ≡ 2 * 3 (mod 4 * 3)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx ≡ 4 (mod 12)\nx ≡ 6 (mod 12)\n\nNow, we can find the smallest positive number that satisfies both congruences. We can start by listing the numbers that satisfy each congruence:\n\nx ≡ 4 (mod 12): 4, 16, 28, 40, ...\nx ≡ 6 (mod 12): 6, 18, 30, 42, ...\n\nThe smallest positive number that appears in both lists is 42. Therefore, the smallest possible positive number that satisfies both conditions is 42."
