    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 7cm, a width of 3cm, and a height of 5cm. What is the length of the diagonal of this rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nIn this case, the length is 7cm, the width is 3cm, and the height is 5cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiagonal length = √(7² + 3² + 5²)\nDiagonal length = √(49 + 9 + 25)\nDiagonal length = √(83)\n\nThe length of the diagonal of this rectangular prism is √(83) cm, which is approximately 9.11 cm."
