If they are isomorphic, provide the isomorphism (a one-to-one correspondence that preserves the adjacency of the vertices) between the two graphs.",
    "message_2": "To determine if Graph A and Graph B are isomorphic, we need to check if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices that preserves the adjacency of the vertices. Since Graph A has 5 vertices and Graph B has 6 vertices, there cannot be a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices. \n\nTherefore, Graph A and Graph B are not isomorphic."
