    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.\n\nFor the given graph, let's find all the automorphisms. We can start by considering the possible images of vertex 1 under an automorphism:\n\n1. If the image of vertex 1 is itself (i.e., 1 stays fixed), then the only possibility is the identity automorphism, which maps each vertex to itself: (1)(2)(3)(4).\n\n2. If the image of vertex 1 is vertex 2, then vertex 2 must be mapped to one of its neighbors, either 1 or 3. If vertex 2 is mapped to 1, we get the automorphism (1 2)(3 4). If vertex 2 is mapped to 3, we get the automorphism (1 2 3 4).\n\n3. If the image of vertex 1 is vertex 3, then vertex 3 must be mapped to one of its neighbors, either 1 or 4. If vertex 3 is mapped to 1, we get the automorphism (1 3)(2 4). If vertex 3 is mapped to 4, we get the automorphism (1 3 4 2).\n\n4. If the image of vertex 1 is vertex 4, then vertex 4 must be mapped to one of its neighbors, either 1 or 3. If vertex 4 is mapped to 1, we get the automorphism (1 4 3 2). If vertex 4 is mapped to 3, we get the automorphism (1 4)(2 3).\n\nSo, the automorphism group of this graph is the set of all these automorphisms:\n\n{ (1)(2)(3)(4), (1 2)(3 4), (1 2 3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 3 4 2), (1 4 3 2), (1 4)(2 3) }\n\nThis group has 8 elements and is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4, which is the symmetry group of a square."
