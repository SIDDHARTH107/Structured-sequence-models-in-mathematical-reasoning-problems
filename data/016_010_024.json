    "message_2": "The Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the interstices between mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. In the case of an initial configuration of 3 mutually tangent circles with radius 1, we can calculate the total number of circles in the 5th iteration using the following recursive formula:\n\nTotal number of circles at iteration n = 2^n + 1\n\nThis formula is derived from the fact that each new iteration adds twice as many circles as the previous iteration, plus the initial 3 circles.\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nTotal number of circles = 2^5 + 1 = 32 + 1 = 33\n\nSo, there are 33 circles in the 5th iteration of the Apollonian gasket with the given initial configuration."
