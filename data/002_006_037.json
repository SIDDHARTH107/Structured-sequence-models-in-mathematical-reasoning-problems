    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference = π * diameter\n\nIn this case, the diameter of the pizza is 14 inches. Therefore, the circumference is:\n\nCircumference = π * 14 inches ≈ 3.14159 * 14 inches ≈ 43.98 inches\n\nThe circumference of the pizza is approximately 43.98 inches."
