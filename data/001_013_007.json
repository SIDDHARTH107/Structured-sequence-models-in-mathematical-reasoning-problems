    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(x - 3) = 2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n(√(x - 3))^2 = 2^2\n\n2. Simplify the equation:\nx - 3 = 4\n\n3. Add 3 to both sides of the equation to isolate x:\nx = 4 + 3\n\n4. Simplify to find the value of x:\nx = 7\n\nSo, the solution to the equation √(x - 3) = 2 is x = 7."
