    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the objective function, we need to consider all possible combinations of values for X and Y, and their corresponding probabilities. The objective function can be written as Z = X * x + Y * y.\n\nLet's calculate the expected values for X and Y first:\n\nE(X) = 1 * 0.2 + 2 * 0.4 + 3 * 0.3 + 4 * 0.1 = 0.2 + 0.8 + 0.9 + 0.4 = 2.3\nE(Y) = 1 * 0.3 + 2 * 0.2 + 3 * 0.1 + 4 * 0.4 = 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.3 + 1.6 = 2.6\n\nNow we need to find the optimal values of x and y that satisfy the constraints and maximize the objective function Z = 2.3x + 2.6y.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. 0 <= x <= 5\n2. 0 <= y <= 10\n3. x + y <= 12\n\nLet's analyze the constraint x + y <= 12:\n- If x = 0, then y can be at most 12.\n- If x = 5, then y can be at most 7.\n\nSo, the possible values for x and y are:\n1. (x, y) = (0, 12) but y is limited to 10, so (x, y) = (0, 10)\n2. (x, y) = (5, 7)\n\nNow let's calculate the objective function values for these points:\n\nZ(0, 10) = 2.3 * 0 + 2.6 * 10 = 26\nZ(5, 7) = 2.3 * 5 + 2.6 * 7 = 11.5 + 18.2 = 29.7\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 29.7 at the point (5, 7).\n\nSince the coefficients of x and y in the objective function are given by random variables X and Y, the expected value of the objective function is the maximum value, which is 29.7."
