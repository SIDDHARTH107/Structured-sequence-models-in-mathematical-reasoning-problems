    "message_2": "To find the minimum weight spanning tree of this graph, we can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm. I will use Kruskal's algorithm here.\n\nFirst, sort all the edges in the graph by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. (A, B) - 1\n2. (B, C) - 2\n3. (B, D) - 3\n4. (C, D) - 4\n5. (A, E) - 5\n6. (D, E) - 6\n\nNow, we'll go through the sorted list and add edges to the minimum weight spanning tree while making sure we don't create any cycles.\n\n1. Add (A, B) - 1\n2. Add (B, C) - 2\n3. Add (B, D) - 3\n4. Skip (C, D) - 4 (since it would create a cycle)\n5. Add (A, E) - 5\n6. Skip (D, E) - 6 (since it would create a cycle)\n\nThe minimum weight spanning tree consists of the edges (A, B), (B, C), (B, D), and (A, E) with a total weight of 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11.\n\nHere's a visualization of the minimum weight spanning tree:\n\n```\nA --1-- B --2-- C\n \\      |\n 5      3\n  \\      \\\n   E      D\n```"
