    "message_1": "In a Beauty Contest Game with 10 players, each player chooses a number between 0 and 100, and the winner is the player whose number is closest to two-thirds of the average of all the numbers chosen. What number should each player choose to maximise their chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their chances of winning, each player should try to predict what the other players will choose and then choose a number that is two-thirds of the predicted average. This is because the winning number is closest to two-thirds of the actual average of all chosen numbers.\n\nLet's assume that all players think rationally and believe that the other players will choose numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 100. In this case, the expected average would be 50 (since the average of 0 and 100 is 50). Therefore, a rational player would choose two-thirds of 50, which is 33.33.\n\nHowever, if all players think this way, then the new expected average would be 33.33, and a more rational player would choose two-thirds of 33.33, which is approximately 22.22.\n\nThis process can be repeated, and the chosen numbers will converge to 0. To see this, let's denote the nth step of this reasoning process as x_n. We have:\n\nx_0 = 100 (initial upper bound)\nx_1 = 2/3 * x_0 = 66.67\nx_2 = 2/3 * x_1 ≈ 44.44\nx_3 = 2/3 * x_2 ≈ 29.63\nx_4 = 2/3 * x_3 ≈ 19.75\n...\n\nAs n approaches infinity, x_n approaches 0.\n\nIn practice, not all players may go through this deep reasoning process, and the best strategy would depend on the level of rationality of the other players. However, choosing a number close to 0 would generally be a better strategy in this game to maximize the chances of winning."
