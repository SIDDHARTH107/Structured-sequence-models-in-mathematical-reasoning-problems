    "message_2": "To find the minimum point of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 8x^2 + 3x - 5 using the quasi-Newton method, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the gradient (first derivative) of the function.\n2. Compute the Hessian (second derivative) of the function.\n3. Update the guess for the minimum point using the quasi-Newton formula.\n\nStep 1: Compute the gradient (first derivative) of the function.\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 16x + 3\n\nStep 2: Compute the Hessian (second derivative) of the function.\nf''(x) = 12x^2 - 24x + 16\n\nNow, we will use the quasi-Newton method to update our guess for the minimum point. We will start with an initial guess of x0 = 3.\n\nStep 3: Update the guess for the minimum point using the quasi-Newton formula.\nx1 = x0 - f'(x0) / f''(x0)\n\nFirst, we need to compute f'(3) and f''(3):\nf'(3) = 4(3)^3 - 12(3)^2 + 16(3) + 3 = 108 - 108 + 48 + 3 = 51\nf''(3) = 12(3)^2 - 24(3) + 16 = 108 - 72 + 16 = 52\n\nNow, we can update our guess for the minimum point:\nx1 = 3 - 51 / 52 = 3 - 0.980769 = 2.019231\n\nSo, after one iteration of the quasi-Newton method, our updated guess for the minimum point is x1 = 2.019231. We can continue this process for more iterations to get a more accurate estimate of the minimum point. However, it's important to note that the quasi-Newton method may not always converge to the true minimum point, and the choice of the initial guess can affect the results."
