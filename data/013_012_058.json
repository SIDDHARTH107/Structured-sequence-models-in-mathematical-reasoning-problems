    "message_1": "In a Stackelberg game, a leader firm chooses its production quantity before a follower firm chooses its production quantity. The market demand is given by P = 100 - Q, where P is the product price and Q is the total quantity of products produced by both firms. The leader firm has a marginal cost of $20 per unit, and the follower firm has a marginal cost of $30 per unit. What is the Stackelberg equilibrium quantity produced by both firms?",
    "message_2": "To find the Stackelberg equilibrium quantity produced by both firms, we need to first find the reaction function of the follower firm and then find the profit-maximizing quantity for the leader firm.\n\n1. Find the reaction function of the follower firm:\nThe follower firm's profit function is given by:\nπ_F = (P - MC_F) * q_F = (100 - Q - MC_F) * q_F = (100 - (q_L + q_F) - 30) * q_F = (70 - q_L - q_F) * q_F\n\nTo maximize its profit, the follower firm will choose q_F such that its marginal profit is equal to its marginal cost:\nd(π_F) / dq_F = 70 - q_L - 2 * q_F = 30\n\nSolving for q_F, we get the reaction function of the follower firm:\nq_F = (70 - q_L) / 2\n\n2. Find the profit-maximizing quantity for the leader firm:\nThe leader firm's profit function is given by:\nπ_L = (P - MC_L) * q_L = (100 - Q - MC_L) * q_L = (100 - (q_L + q_F) - 20) * q_L = (80 - q_L - q_F) * q_L\n\nSubstitute the reaction function of the follower firm into the leader firm's profit function:\nπ_L = (80 - q_L - ((70 - q_L) / 2)) * q_L = (90 - (3/2) * q_L) * q_L\n\nTo maximize its profit, the leader firm will choose q_L such that its marginal profit is equal to its marginal cost:\nd(π_L) / dq_L = 90 - 3 * q_L = 20\n\nSolving for q_L, we get the profit-maximizing quantity for the leader firm:\nq_L = (90 - 20) / 3 = 70 / 3\n\n3. Find the equilibrium quantity produced by both firms:\nSubstitute the profit-maximizing quantity for the leader firm into the reaction function of the follower firm:\nq_F = (70 - (70 / 3)) / 2 = (70 * 2 / 3) / 2 = 70 / 3\n\nThe Stackelberg equilibrium quantity produced by both firms is:\nQ = q_L + q_F = 70 / 3 + 70 / 3 = 140 / 3 ≈ 46.67 units"
