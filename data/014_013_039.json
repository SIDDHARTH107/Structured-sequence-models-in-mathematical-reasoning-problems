Here's a question for a math student studying Hill Cipher:\n\nFind the ciphertext that results from encrypting the plaintext message \"MATH\" using the Hill Cipher with the encryption matrix:\n\n```\n|2 3|\n|1 4|\n```\n\nNote: In the Hill Cipher, each letter in the plaintext is represented by a number, such as A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, and so on. The encryption matrix is used to transform groups of letters (represented as column vectors) into ciphertext groups.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext message \"MATH\" using the Hill Cipher with the given encryption matrix, follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the letters to their corresponding numerical values: M = 12, A = 0, T = 19, H = 7.\n2. Arrange the numerical values into column vectors: [12, 0] and [19, 7].\n3. Multiply the encryption matrix by each column vector:\n\nFor the first column vector [12, 0]:\n```\n|2 3| |12|   |(2*12 + 3*0) % 26|   |24 % 26|   |24|\n|1 4| | 0| = |(1*12 + 4*0) % 26| = |12 % 26| = |12|\n```\n\nFor the second column vector [19, 7]:\n```\n|2 3| |19|   |(2*19 + 3*7) % 26|   |61 % 26|   | 9|\n|1 4| | 7| = |(1*19 + 4*7) % 26| = |47 % 26| = |21|\n```\n\n4. Convert the resulting numerical values back to letters: 24 = X, 12 = M, 9 = J, 21 = V.\n5. Combine the letters to form the ciphertext: \"XMJV\".\n\nSo, the ciphertext resulting from encrypting the plaintext message \"MATH\" using the Hill Cipher with the given encryption matrix is \"XMJV\"."
