    "message_1": "Suppose two travelers, A and B, are flying separately to the same destination. They both have to pay a baggage fee, but they do not know the exact fee. However, they do know that the fee will be a whole number between 1 and 100 dollars. Both travelers want to pay the lowest possible fee, but they do not know what the other will choose. If their chosen fees differ by more than 1 dollar, then the traveler who chose the lower fee will get to keep the difference. If their chosen fees differ by 1 dollar or less, then both travelers will pay the higher fee. What is the optimal fee that each traveler should choose?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation. If both travelers choose the same fee, they will both pay that fee. If one traveler chooses a fee that is 1 dollar more than the other, they will both pay the higher fee. If one traveler chooses a fee that is more than 1 dollar higher than the other, the traveler who chose the lower fee will get to keep the difference.\n\nIn this situation, both travelers want to minimize their fee, so they will try to choose a fee that is as low as possible while still being higher than the other traveler's fee. This creates a game of trying to outguess the other traveler.\n\nThe optimal strategy for both travelers is to choose a fee of 2 dollars. Here's why:\n\n1. If both travelers choose 1 dollar, they will both pay 1 dollar, which is the lowest possible fee.\n2. If one traveler chooses 1 dollar and the other chooses 2 dollars, they will both pay 2 dollars, which is still a relatively low fee.\n3. If one traveler chooses 1 dollar and the other chooses a fee higher than 2 dollars, the traveler who chose 1 dollar will get to keep the difference, which is a good outcome for them.\n\nBy choosing a fee of 2 dollars, both travelers ensure that they will pay a relatively low fee, regardless of what the other traveler chooses. If they both choose 2 dollars, they will both pay 2 dollars. If one chooses 2 dollars and the other chooses a higher fee, the traveler who chose 2 dollars will get to keep the difference. This strategy minimizes the risk of paying a high fee while still giving each traveler a chance to pay a low fee."
