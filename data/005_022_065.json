    "message_1": "A company produces light bulbs and claims that the average life of their bulbs is 1000 hours with a standard deviation of 50 hours. But a sample of 50 bulbs was taken and it was found that the average bulb life was 985 hours. \n\nUsing the method of the 5% trimmed mean, calculate the average life of the bulbs and determine if the company's claim is justified.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 5% trimmed mean, we first need to remove the lowest 5% and highest 5% of the data points in the sample. Since we have a sample of 50 bulbs, we will remove the lowest 2.5 bulbs and the highest 2.5 bulbs (5% of 50 is 2.5, but we can't remove half a bulb, so we will round up to 3 bulbs).\n\n1. First, we need to arrange the bulb life data in ascending order. Unfortunately, we don't have the individual bulb life data, so we will have to make some assumptions. Let's assume that the data is normally distributed around the sample mean of 985 hours.\n\n2. Since we don't have the actual data, we can't remove the exact lowest and highest 3 bulbs. However, we can estimate the trimmed mean using the sample mean and standard deviation. The formula for the 5% trimmed mean is:\n\nTrimmed Mean = Sample Mean + (0.45 * Standard Deviation)\n\n3. We have the sample mean (985 hours) and the standard deviation (50 hours), so we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nTrimmed Mean = 985 + (0.45 * 50)\nTrimmed Mean = 985 + 22.5\nTrimmed Mean = 1007.5 hours\n\nThe 5% trimmed mean is 1007.5 hours, which is slightly higher than the company's claim of 1000 hours. Based on this calculation, the company's claim seems to be justified. However, it's important to note that this analysis is based on assumptions and estimations, and having the actual bulb life data would provide a more accurate result."
