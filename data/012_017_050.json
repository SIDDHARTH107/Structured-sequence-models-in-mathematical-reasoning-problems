    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges that covers every vertex exactly once. In this graph, there are two perfect matchings:\n\n1. Edges (A, X) and (B, C) and (D, X)\n2. Edges (A, B) and (C, D) and (X, X)\n\nIn the first perfect matching, vertex A is connected to vertex X, vertex B is connected to vertex C, and vertex D is connected to vertex X. In the second perfect matching, vertex A is connected to vertex B, vertex C is connected to vertex D, and vertex X is connected to itself."
