    "message_2": "To calculate the number of faces of the simplicial complex K, we need to count the number of vertices, edges, and triangles.\n\nVertices: There are 4 vertices {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nEdges: We can list all the edges by looking at the triangles:\nTriangle 123 has edges {12, 13, 23}\nTriangle 124 has edges {12, 14, 24}\nTriangle 234 has edges {23, 24, 34}\nCombining these, we have the edges {12, 13, 23, 14, 24, 34}, which is a total of 6 edges.\n\nTriangles: There are 3 triangles {123, 124, 234}.\n\nNow, we can sum up the number of vertices, edges, and triangles to find the total number of faces:\nFaces = Vertices + Edges + Triangles = 4 + 6 + 3 = 13.\n\nSo, the simplicial complex K has 13 faces."
