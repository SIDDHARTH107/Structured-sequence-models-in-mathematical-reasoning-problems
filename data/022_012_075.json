    "message_2": "Let $f(z)$ be a meromorphic function on the complex plane with a pole of order 2 at $z=0$ and residue $3$. Since $f(z)$ has a pole of order 2 at $z=0$, we can write $f(z)$ in the form:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{A}{z^2} + \\frac{3}{z} + g(z),$$\n\nwhere $A$ is a constant and $g(z)$ is a holomorphic function on the complex plane. The residue of $f(z)$ at $z=0$ is given by the coefficient of $\\frac{1}{z}$, which is $3$.\n\nNow, we want to find all such functions $f(z)$ that are bounded on the complex plane. We know that a meromorphic function is bounded if and only if it is constant. So, we want to find all constant functions $f(z)$ that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nSince $g(z)$ is holomorphic on the complex plane, it is bounded near $z=0$. Therefore, the only way for $f(z)$ to be bounded is if the terms $\\frac{A}{z^2}$ and $\\frac{3}{z}$ cancel each other out as $z$ approaches infinity. This means that $A=0$.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{3}{z} + g(z),$$\n\nwhere $g(z)$ is a holomorphic function on the complex plane. Since $f(z)$ is constant, it follows that $g(z)$ must be a constant function as well. Let $g(z) = C$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{3}{z} + C.$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is bounded, we must have $C = 0$. Therefore, the only meromorphic function on the complex plane that is bounded and has a pole of order 2 at $z=0$ with residue $3$ is:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{3}{z}.$$"
