(Assuming that each division results in the creation of four new smaller curves with the same shape as the original curve.)",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of times the Lévy C curve needs to be divided as n. After each division, the total curve length is multiplied by 4^(1/2), since each division results in the creation of four new smaller curves with the same shape as the original curve.\n\nSo, after n divisions, the total curve length will be:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (4^(1/2))^n\n\nWe want the total curve length to be 100 units, and the initial length is 1 unit. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n100 = 1 * (4^(1/2))^n\n\nNow, we need to solve for n:\n\n100 = (4^(1/2))^n\n100 = 2^n\n\nTo solve for n, we can take the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(100) = log(2^n)\nlog(100) = n * log(2)\n\nNow, divide by log(2) to isolate n:\n\nn = log(100) / log(2)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nn ≈ 6.643856\n\nSince n must be a whole number (we can't divide the curve a fraction of a time), we need to round up to the next whole number:\n\nn = 7\n\nSo, the Lévy C curve needs to be divided 7 times in order to reach a total curve length of 100 units."
