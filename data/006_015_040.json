    "message_1": "Suppose a network has 10 entry points, and on any day, each entry point is vulnerable to a cyber attack with a probability of 0.05. What is the probability of at least one entry point being attacked in a given day?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one entry point being attacked, it's easier to first find the probability of none of the entry points being attacked and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of an entry point not being attacked is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince there are 10 entry points, the probability of none of them being attacked is 0.95^10 ≈ 0.5987.\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least one entry point being attacked, we subtract the probability of none being attacked from 1:\n\n1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013.\n\nSo, the probability of at least one entry point being attacked in a given day is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
