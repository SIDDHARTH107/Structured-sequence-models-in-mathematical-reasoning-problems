    "message_1": "Let A be a set such that A = {3, 4, 5}. Find the size of the power set of A and compare it with the size of set A. Show that the power set of set A is always larger.",
    "message_2": "The power set of a set A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and the set A itself. The size of the power set of A is given by the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in set A.\n\nIn this case, set A has 3 elements: A = {3, 4, 5}. Therefore, the size of the power set of A is 2^3 = 8.\n\nNow let's list the elements of the power set of A:\nP(A) = {âˆ…, {3}, {4}, {5}, {3, 4}, {3, 5}, {4, 5}, {3, 4, 5}}\n\nAs we can see, the power set P(A) has 8 elements, while the set A has only 3 elements. Thus, the size of the power set of A is larger than the size of set A.\n\nIn general, for any set A with n elements, the size of its power set will be 2^n, which is always larger than n. This is because the function 2^n is an exponential function that grows faster than the linear function n."
