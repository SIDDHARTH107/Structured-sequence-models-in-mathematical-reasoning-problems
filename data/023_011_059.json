    "message_2": "The given function is f(x) = cos(2πx). Since this function is already a single cosine term, its Fourier series representation is simply itself. Therefore, the Fourier series representation of f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = cos(2πx)\n\nNow, let's find the amplitude and phase of each harmonic component using the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-jωx)] dx\n\nFor a periodic function, we can use the Fourier series coefficients instead. The Fourier series coefficients are given by:\n\na_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * cos(2πnx/T)] dx (for n = 0, 1, 2, ...)\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * sin(2πnx/T)] dx (for n = 1, 2, ...)\n\nSince f(x) is an even function (cosine is even), all b_n coefficients will be zero. The period of f(x) is T = 1. Therefore, we can calculate the a_n coefficients:\n\na_0 = (2/1) * ∫[cos(2πx) * cos(0)] dx from 0 to 1\na_n = (2/1) * ∫[cos(2πx) * cos(2πnx)] dx from 0 to 1 (for n = 1, 2, ...)\n\nBy calculating these integrals, we find that:\n\na_0 = 0\na_n = 1 if n = 1\na_n = 0 for n ≠ 1\n\nThus, the Fourier series representation of f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = cos(2πx)\n\nThe amplitude of the harmonic component is 1, and the phase is 0 (since there is no phase shift in the cosine term)."
