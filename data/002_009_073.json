    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of a cylinder, we need to find the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. In this case, the radius is 4 cm.\n\nArea of one circular base = π(4^2) = 16π square centimeters\n\nSince there are two bases, we multiply this by 2:\n\nTotal area of both bases = 2 * 16π = 32π square centimeters\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height. In this case, the radius is 4 cm and the height is 8 cm.\n\nLateral surface area = 2π(4)(8) = 64π square centimeters\n\nNow, we add the areas of the bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\n\nTotal surface area = 32π + 64π = 96π square centimeters\n\nSince π is approximately 3.14, we can calculate the numerical value:\n\nTotal surface area ≈ 96 * 3.14 = 301.44 square centimeters"
