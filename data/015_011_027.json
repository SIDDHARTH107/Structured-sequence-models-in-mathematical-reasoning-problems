    "message_1": "What is the maximum angle of deflection of the second pendulum bob for a double pendulum system with bob masses of 1 kg and 2 kg, a length of 1 m for each rod, and an initial angle of 10 degrees for both bobs with no initial angular velocity?",
    "message_2": "The double pendulum system is a complex and chaotic system, which means that it is highly sensitive to initial conditions and does not have a simple closed-form solution for the motion of the pendulum bobs. To find the maximum angle of deflection of the second pendulum bob, we would need to solve the equations of motion numerically.\n\nThe equations of motion for a double pendulum system can be derived using the Lagrangian method. The Lagrangian (L) is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy (T) and the potential energy (V) of the system:\n\nL = T - V\n\nFor the given double pendulum system, the kinetic energy (T) and potential energy (V) can be expressed as:\n\nT = (1/2) * m1 * v1^2 + (1/2) * m2 * v2^2\nV = m1 * g * h1 + m2 * g * h2\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the bobs, v1 and v2 are their velocities, h1 and h2 are their heights relative to the reference point, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2).\n\nUsing the given initial conditions (masses, lengths, and angles), we can write the equations of motion for the double pendulum system. These equations are nonlinear and coupled, making them difficult to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to solve these equations and find the maximum angle of deflection of the second pendulum bob.\n\nTo do this, you would need to write a program or use software like MATLAB or Python to implement the numerical method and solve the equations of motion. The maximum angle of deflection of the second pendulum bob will depend on the specific trajectory of the system, which is highly sensitive to the initial conditions."
