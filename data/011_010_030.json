    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from a group of 10 people without any restrictions. Then, we will find the number of ways to form a committee with those two particular people and subtract that from the total number of ways.\n\n1. Total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from a group of 10 people without any restrictions:\n\nThis can be calculated using combinations, which is given by the formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of people and r is the number of people to be selected.\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n= 10! / (5!5!)\n= (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n= 252\n\nSo, there are 252 ways to form a committee of 5 members from a group of 10 people without any restrictions.\n\n2. Number of ways to form a committee with those two particular people:\n\nIf those two particular people are both on the committee, we need to select 3 more members from the remaining 8 people.\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n= 8! / (3!5!)\n= (8 × 7 × 6) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n= 56\n\nSo, there are 56 ways to form a committee with those two particular people.\n\n3. Number of ways to form a committee such that no two particular people are both on the committee:\n\nWe subtract the number of ways to form a committee with those two particular people from the total number of ways without any restrictions.\n\nTotal ways = 252 - 56 = 196\n\nTherefore, there are 196 ways to form a committee of 5 members from a group of 10 people such that no two particular people are both on the committee."
