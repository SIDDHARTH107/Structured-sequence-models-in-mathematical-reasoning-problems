    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = 2cos(3x), we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's denote the outer function as g(u) = 2cos(u) and the inner function as h(x) = 3x.\n\nNow, we find the derivatives of g(u) and h(x):\n\ng'(u) = -2sin(u)\nh'(x) = 3\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x)\n\nf'(x) = -2sin(3x) * 3\n\nf'(x) = -6sin(3x)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 2cos(3x) is f'(x) = -6sin(3x)."
