    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. In other words, it is the number of integers k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n for which the greatest common divisor gcd(n, k) = 1.\n\nTo compute the value of Euler's totient function for a given number n, we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor n = 36, we first find its prime factors:\n\n36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n\nNow, we can plug these prime factors into the formula:\n\nφ(36) = 36 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3)\nφ(36) = 36 * (1/2) * (2/3)\nφ(36) = 18 * (2/3)\nφ(36) = 12\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for 36 is 12."
