    "message_2": "To compute the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface by the position vector r(u,v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2). Then, we can find the first and second partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we can compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 2uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNext, we need to find the second fundamental form coefficients. To do this, we first find the unit normal vector N:\n\nN = (r_u × r_v) / |r_u × r_v|\nN = (-2u, -2v, 1) / sqrt(1 + 4(u^2 + v^2))\n\nNow, we can find the second derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nThen, we can compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = N • r_uu = -4u / sqrt(1 + 4(u^2 + v^2))\nM = N • r_uv = -2v / sqrt(1 + 4(u^2 + v^2))\nN = N • r_vv = -4v / sqrt(1 + 4(u^2 + v^2))\n\nFinally, we can compute the mean curvature H at the point (1,1,2):\n\nH = (1/2) * ((EG - F^2) * (LN + NM - M^2) - 2FM * (LM + MN) + G * (L^2 + 2LM - M^2)) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have u = 1 and v = 1:\n\nE = 5\nF = 2\nG = 5\nL = -2 / sqrt(9)\nM = -1 / sqrt(9)\nN = -2 / sqrt(9)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula for H, we get:\n\nH = (1/2) * ((5 * 5 - 2^2) * ((-2 / sqrt(9))^2 + 2(-2 / sqrt(9))(-1 / sqrt(9)) - (-1 / sqrt(9))^2)) / (5 * 5 - 2^2)\nH = (1/2) * (21 * (4/9 + 4/9 - 1/9)) / 21\nH = (1/2) * (7/3)\nH = 7/6\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2) is 7/6."
