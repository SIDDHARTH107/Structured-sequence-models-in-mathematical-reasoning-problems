    "message_2": "To find the order and type of the pole of f(z) at infinity, we first need to consider the function g(w) = f(1/w), where w = 1/z. This substitution will allow us to analyze the behavior of f(z) as z approaches infinity by studying g(w) as w approaches 0.\n\nSo, let's find g(w):\n\ng(w) = f(1/w) = (1/w)^3 - 2(1/w)^2 + 3(1/w) - 6\n\nNow, we'll multiply both sides by w^3 to simplify the expression:\n\nw^3 * g(w) = 1 - 2w + 3w^2 - 6w^3\n\nNow, let's find the Laurent series expansion of g(w) around w = 0:\n\ng(w) = (1/w^3) * (1 - 2w + 3w^2 - 6w^3)\n\nSince the Laurent series expansion of g(w) has a term with a negative power of w (1/w^3), g(w) has a pole at w = 0. The order of the pole is the smallest exponent of w in the denominator, which is 3 in this case.\n\nNow, let's go back to f(z) and analyze its behavior at infinity. Since g(w) has a pole of order 3 at w = 0, f(z) has a pole of order 3 at z = âˆž.\n\nTherefore, the order of the pole of f(z) at infinity is 3, and the type of the pole is a simple pole."
