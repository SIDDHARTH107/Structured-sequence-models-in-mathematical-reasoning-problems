    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos(x) + 2sin(x) = √3, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin(2θ) = 2sin(θ)cos(θ)\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given equation in terms of sin(2θ):\n\ncos(x) + 2sin(x) = √3\ncos(x) = √3 - 2sin(x)\n\nNow, let's square both sides of the equation:\n\ncos^2(x) = (√3 - 2sin(x))^2\n\nSince cos^2(x) + sin^2(x) = 1, we can replace cos^2(x) with 1 - sin^2(x):\n\n1 - sin^2(x) = (√3 - 2sin(x))^2\n\nExpanding the right side of the equation:\n\n1 - sin^2(x) = 3 - 4√3sin(x) + 4sin^2(x)\n\nNow, let's move all terms to the left side of the equation:\n\n5sin^2(x) + 4√3sin(x) + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of sin(x). Let's solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nsin(x) = (-B ± √(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A\n\nIn this case, A = 5, B = 4√3, and C = 2:\n\nsin(x) = (-(4√3) ± √((4√3)^2 - 4(5)(2))) / (2(5))\n\nsin(x) = (-4√3 ± √(48 - 40)) / 10\n\nsin(x) = (-4√3 ± √8) / 10\n\nsin(x) = (-4√3 ± 2√2) / 10\n\nsin(x) = -2√3/5 ± √2/5\n\nNow, we need to find the angles x for which sin(x) = -2√3/5 and sin(x) = √2/5.\n\nFor sin(x) = -2√3/5:\n\nx = arcsin(-2√3/5) ≈ -41.81°\n\nSince x must be between 0° and 360°, we can add 360° to this value:\n\nx ≈ 360° - 41.81° ≈ 318.19°\n\nFor sin(x) = √2/5:\n\nx = arcsin(√2/5) ≈ 16.26°\n\nSo, the solutions for x are approximately 16.26° and 318.19°."
