    "message_2": "To find the fixed points, we need to solve the equation 𝑥 = 𝑟𝑥(1 − 𝑥) for x. \n\nLet's find the fixed points for each value of r:\n\n1. r = 3.2\n   𝑥 = 3.2𝑥(1 − 𝑥)\n   𝑥 = 3.2𝑥 - 3.2𝑥^2\n\n2. r = 3.5\n   𝑥 = 3.5𝑥(1 − 𝑥)\n   𝑥 = 3.5𝑥 - 3.5𝑥^2\n\n3. r = 3.8\n   𝑥 = 3.8𝑥(1 − 𝑥)\n   𝑥 = 3.8𝑥 - 3.8𝑥^2\n\nFor each equation, we have two fixed points: x = 0 and x = 1 - 1/r.\n\n1. r = 3.2\n   Fixed points: x = 0 and x = 1 - 1/3.2 = 0.6875\n\n2. r = 3.5\n   Fixed points: x = 0 and x = 1 - 1/3.5 = 0.7143\n\n3. r = 3.8\n   Fixed points: x = 0 and x = 1 - 1/3.8 = 0.7368\n\nNow, let's determine the stability of each fixed point. To do this, we need to find the derivative of the logistic equation with respect to x and evaluate it at each fixed point. If the absolute value of the derivative is less than 1, the fixed point is stable; otherwise, it is unstable.\n\nThe derivative of the logistic equation is:\nd(𝑟𝑥(1 − 𝑥))/dx = 𝑟(1 - 2𝑥)\n\n1. r = 3.2\n   - At x = 0: |3.2(1 - 0)| = 3.2 (unstable)\n   - At x = 0.6875: |3.2(1 - 2*0.6875)| = |3.2(-0.375)| = 1.2 (unstable)\n\n2. r = 3.5\n   - At x = 0: |3.5(1 - 0)| = 3.5 (unstable)\n   - At x = 0.7143: |3.5(1 - 2*0.7143)| = |3.5(-0.4286)| = 1.5 (unstable)\n\n3. r = 3.8\n   - At x = 0: |3.8(1 - 0)| = 3.8 (unstable)\n   - At x = 0.7368: |3.8(1 - 2*0.7368)| = |3.8(-0.4736)| = 1.8 (unstable)\n\nIn conclusion, for all three values of r (3.2, 3.5, and 3.8), both fixed points are unstable."
