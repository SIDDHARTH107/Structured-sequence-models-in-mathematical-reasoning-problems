    "message_1": "A rectangle has a length of 10 cm and a width of 5 cm. What is the perimeter of the rectangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you can use the formula P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, the length (L) is 10 cm and the width (W) is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 2(10 + 5)\nP = 2(15)\nP = 30 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 30 cm."
