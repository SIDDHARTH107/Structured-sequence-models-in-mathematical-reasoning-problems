    "message_1": "A guitar string is plucked at time t = 0 and the resulting wave produced on the string is given by y(x,t) = 0.02sin(2πx)e^(-100π^2t), where x is the distance along the string and y is the displacement of the string from its resting position. Using the Fourier transform, find the frequency components of the wave propagation problem, and determine the time it takes for the amplitude of the wave to decrease to half its initial value.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency components of the wave, we can use the Fourier transform. However, since the given function y(x,t) is already in the form of a sinusoidal function multiplied by an exponential decay term, we can directly identify the frequency components from the function itself.\n\nThe sinusoidal part of the function is sin(2πx), which has an angular frequency of 2π. To convert this to a regular frequency, we divide by 2π:\n\nFrequency = (2π) / (2π) = 1 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency component of the wave is 1 Hz.\n\nNow, let's determine the time it takes for the amplitude of the wave to decrease to half its initial value. The amplitude of the wave is given by the exponential decay term e^(-100π^2t). We want to find the time t when the amplitude is half of its initial value (0.02):\n\n0.5 = e^(-100π^2t)\n\nTo solve for t, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.5) = -100π^2t\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt = ln(0.5) / (-100π^2)\n\nt ≈ 0.00005066 seconds\n\nSo, it takes approximately 0.00005066 seconds for the amplitude of the wave to decrease to half its initial value."
