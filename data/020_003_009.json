    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company has 3 machines that can be used to produce the products, and each machine works for a certain number of hours per day. The production time required for each product on each machine is given in the table below:\n\n|                | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Product A      | 1         | 2         | 2         |\n| Product B      | 2         | 1         | 4         |\n\nThe company can generate a profit of $10 for each unit of Product A and $12 for each unit of Product B. The company wants to know how many units of each product they should produce daily to generate the maximum profit.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can generate, and how many units of each product should be produced daily to achieve this?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum profit and the number of units of each product to produce daily, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B produced daily. The objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 10x + 12y\n\nThe constraints are based on the production time for each machine:\n\nMachine 1: x + 2y ≤ H1 (where H1 is the number of hours Machine 1 works per day)\nMachine 2: 2x + y ≤ H2 (where H2 is the number of hours Machine 2 works per day)\nMachine 3: 2x + 4y ≤ H3 (where H3 is the number of hours Machine 3 works per day)\n\nAdditionally, we have the non-negativity constraints:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we need the number of hours each machine works per day (H1, H2, and H3). Once we have these values, we can find the optimal solution (x, y) and the maximum profit."
