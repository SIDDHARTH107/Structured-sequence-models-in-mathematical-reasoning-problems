    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x - 5 < 7, follow these steps:\n\n1. Add 5 to both sides of the inequality:\n3x - 5 + 5 < 7 + 5\n3x < 12\n\n2. Divide both sides by 3:\n3x/3 < 12/3\nx < 4\n\nThe solution set for the inequality is x < 4.\n\nWhen graphed on a number line, you would place an open circle at 4 (since x is strictly less than 4 and not equal to 4) and shade the line to the left of the open circle, indicating all values of x less than 4."
