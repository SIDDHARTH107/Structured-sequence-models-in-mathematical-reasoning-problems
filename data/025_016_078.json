    "message_2": "(a) To show that the point P = (-1, 1) lies on both curves, we need to substitute the coordinates of P into the equations of both curves and check if they satisfy the equations.\n\nFor C1: 2x + y^2 = 3\n2(-1) + (1)^2 = 3\n-2 + 1 = -1 ≠ 3\n\nSince -1 ≠ 3, the point P = (-1, 1) does not lie on C1.\n\nFor C2: x^3 - 3y^2 = 4\n(-1)^3 - 3(1)^2 = 4\n-1 - 3 = -4 ≠ 4\n\nSince -4 ≠ 4, the point P = (-1, 1) does not lie on C2.\n\nSo, the point P = (-1, 1) does not lie on both curves.\n\n(b) Since the point P does not lie on C1, we cannot find the equation of the line that passes through P and is tangent to C1.\n\n(c) Similarly, since the point P does not lie on C2, we cannot find the equation of the line that passes through P and is tangent to C2.\n\n(d) To find the intersection points of C1 and C2, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the equations of both curves:\n\n2x + y^2 = 3\nx^3 - 3y^2 = 4\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express y^2 as:\n\ny^2 = 3 - 2x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y^2 into the second equation:\n\nx^3 - 3(3 - 2x) = 4\nx^3 - 9 + 6x = 4\nx^3 + 6x - 13 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is not straightforward. However, we can use numerical methods (e.g., the Newton-Raphson method) or graphing software to find the approximate intersection points:\n\nx ≈ -1.620, y ≈ 1.897\nx ≈ 1.303, y ≈ 0.764\nx ≈ 1.317, y ≈ -1.081\n\nSo, the intersection points of C1 and C2 are approximately (-1.620, 1.897), (1.303, 0.764), and (1.317, -1.081).\n\n(e) Two curves are isomorphic if there exists a bijective (one-to-one and onto) mapping between their points that preserves their structure. In this case, since the equations of C1 and C2 are different and their graphs have different shapes, there is no such mapping between their points. Therefore, C1 and C2 are not isomorphic."
