    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 48 isomorphic to G, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3. \n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide the order of the group (48) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide the order of the group (48) and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nNow, we consider the possible structures of G based on the values of n_2 and n_3:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, G is the direct product of its Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup, which are both normal. This results in an abelian group, so it does not meet our requirement of being non-abelian.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. The Sylow 2-subgroup has order 16, and there are two possible groups of order 16 up to isomorphism: Z_16 (cyclic) and Z_2 x Z_8 (elementary abelian). If the Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_16, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Z_16 and Z_3, which results in a non-abelian group. If the Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_2 x Z_8, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Z_2 x Z_8 and Z_3, which also results in a non-abelian group. Therefore, there are two non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. The Sylow 3-subgroup has order 3, and there is only one group of order 3 up to isomorphism: Z_3 (cyclic). In this case, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Z_3 and the Sylow 2-subgroup. However, since the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, this results in a direct product, which is abelian. Therefore, there are no non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then both the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups are not unique. In this case, it is difficult to determine the structure of G without more information.\n\nIn summary, there are at least two non-abelian groups of order 48 isomorphic to G, as shown in case 2. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine if there are additional non-abelian groups in case 4."
