    "message_2": "To factor the given polynomial, 4x^2 + 12x - 16, we can first find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the coefficients, which is 4. We can then factor out the GCF from the polynomial:\n\n4(x^2 + 3x - 4)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. We are looking for two binomials (ax + b)(cx + d) such that:\n\n1. a * c = 1 (coefficient of x^2)\n2. b * d = -4 (constant term)\n3. ad + bc = 3 (coefficient of x)\n\nIn this case, the two binomials that meet these conditions are (x + 4)(x - 1). So, the factored form of the polynomial is:\n\n4(x + 4)(x - 1)"
