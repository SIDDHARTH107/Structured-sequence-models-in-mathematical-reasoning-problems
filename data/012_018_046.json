    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph G into two disjoint subgraphs, we need to ensure that there is no path between any pair of vertices in the two subgraphs. In other words, we need to break the connectivity of the graph.\n\nLet's consider the minimum number of vertices in one of the subgraphs. If one subgraph has only one vertex, then the other subgraph will have the remaining 9 vertices. In this case, we need to remove all the edges connected to that single vertex in order to disconnect the graph.\n\nA complete graph with 9 vertices (K9) has the maximum number of edges, which is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of edges in Kn = n(n-1)/2\n\nFor K9, the number of edges is:\n\nNumber of edges = 9(9-1)/2 = 9*8/2 = 36\n\nSince the original graph G has only 15 edges, it is not a complete graph. Therefore, the vertex with the highest degree (number of edges connected to it) in G will have a degree less than 9. Let's assume the vertex with the highest degree has a degree of d.\n\nTo disconnect the graph, we need to remove all d edges connected to this vertex. Since d is the maximum degree in the graph, removing these edges will ensure that there is no path between the vertex and any other vertex in the other subgraph.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect G into two disjoint subgraphs is d, where d is the maximum degree of a vertex in G."
