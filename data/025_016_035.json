    "message_2": "Since X is birational to the projective plane P^2, there exists a rational map ϕ : X → P^2 and its inverse ψ : P^2 → X such that ϕ ◦ ψ and ψ ◦ ϕ are the identity maps on P^2 and X, respectively. To find the rational map ϕ, we need to find a set of rational functions on X that separates points and tangent vectors.\n\nLet f(x, y, z) be a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3. We can write it as:\n\nf(x, y, z) = a_0x^3 + a_1x^2y + a_2xy^2 + a_3y^3 + a_4x^2z + a_5xyz + a_6y^2z + a_7xz^2 + a_8yz^2 + a_9z^3 = 0\n\nNow, consider the following rational functions on X:\n\ng_1(x, y, z) = x/z\ng_2(x, y, z) = y/z\n\nThese functions are well-defined on X, except at the point [0:0:1]. We can define the rational map ϕ : X → P^2 as:\n\nϕ([x:y:z]) = [g_1(x, y, z) : g_2(x, y, z) : 1] = [x:y:z]\n\nThis map is well-defined on X, except at the point [0:0:1]. However, since X is birational to P^2, there exists an open subset U ⊆ X such that ϕ is an isomorphism between U and its image ϕ(U) ⊆ P^2. Thus, we can find the inverse map ψ : P^2 → X by restricting ϕ to U and taking its inverse.\n\nTo summarize, the rational map ϕ : X → P^2 induced by the birational morphism is given by:\n\nϕ([x:y:z]) = [x:y:z]"
