    "message_2": "To find the distance traveled by the car, we can use the equation of motion:\n\ndistance = initial_velocity × time + 0.5 × acceleration × time^2\n\nwhere\ninitial_velocity = 20 m/s\nacceleration = 5 m/s^2\ntime = 6 seconds\n\ndistance = 20 × 6 + 0.5 × 5 × 6^2\n\ndistance = 120 + 0.5 × 5 × 36\n\ndistance = 120 + 90\n\ndistance = 210 meters\n\nThe car travels 210 meters in the first 6 seconds."
