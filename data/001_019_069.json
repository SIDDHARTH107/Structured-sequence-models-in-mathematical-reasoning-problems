    "message_2": "To solve the equation |3x - 2| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 2 is positive or zero\nIn this case, we can write the equation as:\n3x - 2 = 7\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n3x = 9\nx = 3\n\nCase 2: 3x - 2 is negative\nIn this case, we can write the equation as:\n-(3x - 2) = 7\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n3x - 2 = -7\n3x = -5\nx = -5/3\n\nSo, the solutions for x are x = 3 and x = -5/3."
