    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices of the polygon as vertices of the triangles, we can use the concept of triangulation. Triangulation is the process of dividing a polygon into non-overlapping triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.\n\nFor a simple polygon with n vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed through triangulation is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = n - 2\n\nIn this case, we have a polygon with 10 vertices. Applying the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = 10 - 2 = 8\n\nSo, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices of the polygon as vertices of the triangles is 8."
