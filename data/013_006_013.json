    "message_1": "Two friends, Alice and Bob, go hunting for deer and rabbits in the forest. They can either hunt together and catch a stag, which is worth 4 points, or they can hunt separately and catch a rabbit, which is worth only 1 point. If they hunt separately and one of them gets a rabbit while the other gets nothing, they both get 0 points. Alice knows that Bob will cooperate if she does, but she also knows that if she goes hunting alone while Bob cooperates, she can catch a rabbit and get 2 points. \n\nAssuming that Alice and Bob act rationally to maximize their points, what strategy should Alice choose to maximize her points? And what is the expected number of points she would get?",
    "message_2": "Alice should choose to cooperate with Bob and hunt together for the stag. Since Bob will cooperate if Alice does, they will both maximize their points by working together to catch the stag, which is worth 4 points. If Alice were to hunt alone, she could only get a maximum of 2 points, which is less than the 4 points they would get by cooperating.\n\nThe expected number of points Alice would get by cooperating with Bob is 4 points, as they are both acting rationally to maximize their points and will successfully catch the stag together."
