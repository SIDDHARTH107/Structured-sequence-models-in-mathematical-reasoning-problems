    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree of this graph, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we sort the edges by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. AD: 1\n2. BC: 2\n3. EG: 2\n4. AB: 4\n5. BD: 3\n6. CF: 3\n7. AC: 5\n8. DE: 5\n9. CE: 6\n10. EF: 6\n11. BE: 7\n12. DF: 7\n13. CD: 8\n14. FG: 9\n\nNow, we add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure not to create any cycles:\n\n1. Add AD (A-D)\n2. Add BC (A-D, B-C)\n3. Add EG (A-D, B-C, E-G)\n4. Add BD (A-D, B-C-D, E-G)\n5. Add CF (A-D, B-C-D-F, E-G)\n6. Add AB (A-B-C-D-F, E-G)\n\nAt this point, we have a minimum spanning tree that connects all the nodes:\n\nA-B-C-D-F and E-G\n\nThe minimum spanning tree has the following edges and weights:\n\nAD: 1\nBC: 2\nEG: 2\nAB: 4\nBD: 3\nCF: 3\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 15."
