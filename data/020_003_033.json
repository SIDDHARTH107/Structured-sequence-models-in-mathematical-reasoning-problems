    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products A and B. The profit margin for each A product is $5 and for each B product, it is $4. The company has 300 units of raw material and each A product requires 2 units of raw material, while each B product requires only 1 unit of raw material. The company wants to maximize their profit given the raw material constraint. \nWhat is the optimal number of products A and B the company should produce to maximize their profit and what is the maximum profit they can earn?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of A products and y be the number of B products.\n\nThe profit function can be represented as:\nProfit = 5x + 4y\n\nThe raw material constraint can be represented as:\n2x + y ≤ 300\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal values of x and y that satisfy the constraint.\n\nFirst, let's express y in terms of x using the constraint equation:\ny ≤ 300 - 2x\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x and y that maximize the profit function. Since the profit function is linear, the maximum profit will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region defined by the constraint.\n\nThere are three vertices to consider:\n1. x = 0, y = 300 (all raw material used for B products)\n2. x = 150, y = 0 (all raw material used for A products)\n3. x = 100, y = 100 (a mix of A and B products)\n\nLet's calculate the profit for each vertex:\n1. Profit = 5(0) + 4(300) = $1200\n2. Profit = 5(150) + 4(0) = $750\n3. Profit = 5(100) + 4(100) = $900\n\nThe maximum profit of $1200 occurs when the company produces 0 A products and 300 B products."
