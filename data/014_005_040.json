    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob using digital signatures. Alice's private key consists of two prime numbers, p=17 and q=23, and a random integer d=5. Her public key consists of two values, n=pq and e=13. Alice's message is \"HELLO\". Using RSA algorithm, calculate the signature of the message that Alice sends to Bob.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the signature of the message \"HELLO\" using the RSA algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the message into a numerical representation.\n2. Calculate the signature using Alice's private key (p, q, d).\n3. Send the message and the signature to Bob.\n\nStep 1: Convert the message into a numerical representation\nWe can use the ASCII values of the characters in the message \"HELLO\" to represent it numerically. Here are the ASCII values of each character:\n\nH: 72\nE: 69\nL: 76\nL: 76\nO: 79\n\nWe can concatenate these values to form a single number: 7269767679\n\nStep 2: Calculate the signature using Alice's private key (p, q, d)\nAlice's private key consists of p=17, q=23, and d=5. We also know her public key, which consists of n=pq and e=13. First, we need to calculate n:\n\nn = p * q = 17 * 23 = 391\n\nNow, we can calculate the signature (S) using the numerical representation of the message (M) and Alice's private key (d):\n\nS = M^d mod n\nS = 7269767679^5 mod 391\n\nCalculating this value, we get:\n\nS = 235\n\nStep 3: Send the message and the signature to Bob\nAlice sends the message \"HELLO\" and the signature 235 to Bob. Bob can then use Alice's public key (n, e) to verify the signature and confirm that the message was indeed sent by Alice."
