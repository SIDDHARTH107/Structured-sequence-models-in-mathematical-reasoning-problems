    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the player's free throw success rate)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of free throws attempted)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of free throws made)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 5 (the player attempts 5 free throws)\n- k = 3 (we want to find the probability of making exactly 3 free throws)\n- p = 0.8 (the player's average free throw success rate is 80%)\n\nFirst, let's calculate nCk (5 choose 3):\n\n5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 5! / (3!2!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(2*1)) = 120 / (6*2) = 10\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = (10) * (0.8^3) * (1-0.8)^(5-3)\n\nP(X = 3) = 10 * (0.512) * (0.2^2)\n\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.512 * 0.04\n\nP(X = 3) = 5.12 * 0.04\n\nP(X = 3) â‰ˆ 0.2048\n\nSo, the probability of the basketball player making exactly 3 out of 5 free throws with an 80% success rate is approximately 20.48%."
