Factory A can produce 10 units per day at a cost of $100 per unit, while factory B can produce 15 units per day at a cost of $120 per unit. The company wants to produce 200 units of the product each day, with a minimum cost. Using the bat algorithm, determine the optimal number of units to be produced at each factory that will minimize the company's cost per day.",
    "message_2": "The bat algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the echolocation behavior of microbats. However, for this problem, we can solve it using linear programming, which is more suitable and efficient for this type of problem.\n\nLet x be the number of units produced by Factory A and y be the number of units produced by Factory B. We want to minimize the total cost, which can be represented as:\n\nCost = 100x + 120y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nx + y = 200 (The company wants to produce 200 units per day)\nx ≤ 10 (Factory A can produce up to 10 units per day)\ny ≤ 15 (Factory B can produce up to 15 units per day)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (The number of units produced cannot be negative)\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem graphically by plotting the feasible region and finding the minimum cost point.\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 15), (10, 15), (10, 190), and (0, 200). We can evaluate the cost function at each of these vertices:\n\nCost(0, 15) = 100(0) + 120(15) = $1,800\nCost(10, 15) = 100(10) + 120(15) = $2,800\nCost(10, 190) = 100(10) + 120(190) = $23,800\nCost(0, 200) = 100(0) + 120(200) = $24,000\n\nThe minimum cost is $1,800, which occurs when Factory A produces 0 units and Factory B produces 15 units. However, this solution does not meet the requirement of producing 200 units per day. The next lowest cost is $2,800, which occurs when Factory A produces 10 units and Factory B produces 15 units. This solution meets the requirement of producing 200 units per day (10 from Factory A and 190 from Factory B).\n\nSo, the optimal number of units to be produced at each factory to minimize the company's cost per day is 10 units at Factory A and 190 units at Factory B."
