    "message_2": "To find the order and type of the zero of the complex function f(z) = z^5 - 2z^3 + z^2 - 2 at z = 0, we need to determine the smallest exponent of z in the function.\n\nf(z) = z^5 - 2z^3 + z^2 - 2\n\nThe smallest exponent of z in the function is 2, which corresponds to the term z^2. Therefore, the order of the zero at z = 0 is 2.\n\nSince the order of the zero is 2, it is a double zero or a zero of multiplicity 2. The type of the zero is determined by the order, so the type of the zero at z = 0 is a double zero."
