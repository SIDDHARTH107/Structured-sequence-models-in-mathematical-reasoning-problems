    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 7 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is its surface area?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the surface area (SA) of a rectangular prism is:\n\nSA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: length (l) = 7 cm, width (w) = 4 cm, and height (h) = 5 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSA = 2(7)(4) + 2(7)(5) + 2(4)(5)\nSA = 2(28) + 2(35) + 2(20)\nSA = 56 + 70 + 40\nSA = 166\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 166 square centimeters."
