    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression $2^3 \\cdot 2^5$, we use the rule that states when multiplying two exponential expressions with the same base, we add the exponents. In this case, the base is 2 and the exponents are 3 and 5.\n\n$2^3 \\cdot 2^5 = 2^{(3+5)} = 2^8$\n\nSo, the simplified exponential expression is $2^8$."
