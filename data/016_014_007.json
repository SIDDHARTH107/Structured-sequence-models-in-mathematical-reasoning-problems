    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a Lévy C curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor a Lévy C curve, there are N = 4 self-similar pieces, and the scaling factor S is equal to the square root of 2.\n\nIn this case, the step size is given as 0.01, but this does not affect the Hausdorff dimension, as it only scales the overall size of the curve. The number of iterations (1000) also does not affect the Hausdorff dimension, as it only increases the complexity of the curve.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of a Lévy C curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(√2) ≈ 2\n\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of a Lévy C curve generated by 1000 iterations with a step size of 0.01 is approximately 2."
