Find all possible divisors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.\n3. Determine the number of groups of each order:\n\n   a. There is always one group of order 1 (the trivial group).\n   b. For orders 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18, we can use Sylow's theorems to determine the number of possible groups:\n\n      - Order 2: There is one group, Z_2 (cyclic group of order 2).\n      - Order 3: There is one group, Z_3 (cyclic group of order 3).\n      - Order 4: There are two groups, Z_4 and Z_2 x Z_2.\n      - Order 6: There is one group, Z_6 (cyclic group of order 6).\n      - Order 9: There are two groups, Z_9 and Z_3 x Z_3.\n      - Order 12: There are five groups, Z_12, Z_3 x Z_4, A_4 (alternating group), D_6 (dihedral group), and Q (quaternion group).\n      - Order 18: There are three groups, Z_18, Z_3 x Z_6, and D_9 (dihedral group).\n\n4. Determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 36:\n\n   a. Using the divisors of 36 and the groups of each order, we can construct groups of order 36 using direct products and semi-direct products.\n   b. After analyzing the possibilities, we find that there are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36: Z_36, Z_4 x Z_9, Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_9, and Z_6 x Z_6.\n\nSo, there are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36."
