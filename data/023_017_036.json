    "message_1": "A fluid is flowing through a cylindrical pipe with a diameter of 5 cm. The velocity profile of the fluid is given by u(r) = 10r(1-r^2) cm/s, where r is the radial distance from the center of the pipe. Use the Fourier transform to determine the velocity at a point 2 cm from the center of the pipe.",
    "message_2": "The Fourier transform is not the appropriate method to solve this problem. Instead, we can directly use the given velocity profile formula to find the velocity at a point 2 cm from the center of the pipe.\n\nThe velocity profile is given by u(r) = 10r(1-r^2) cm/s, where r is the radial distance from the center of the pipe. We are asked to find the velocity at a point 2 cm from the center of the pipe, so we can simply plug r = 2 cm into the formula:\n\nu(2) = 10 * 2 * (1 - (2^2))\nu(2) = 20 * (1 - 4)\nu(2) = 20 * (-3)\nu(2) = -60 cm/s\n\nThe velocity at a point 2 cm from the center of the pipe is -60 cm/s."
