    "message_1": "Here is a question for a math student to solve related to Factor Analysis in Statistics:\n\nSuppose you conducted a factor analysis on a set of variables, and found that there are three underlying factors that explain the variance in your data. The eigenvalues for these factors were 2.5, 1.8, and 1.2, respectively. What proportion of the variance is explained by each of the three factors? Please round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the proportion of the variance explained by each factor, we first need to find the total variance explained by all three factors. We do this by summing the eigenvalues:\n\nTotal variance = 2.5 + 1.8 + 1.2 = 5.5\n\nNow, we can find the proportion of the variance explained by each factor by dividing each factor's eigenvalue by the total variance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:\n\nFactor 1 proportion = (2.5 / 5.5) * 100 = 45.45%\nFactor 2 proportion = (1.8 / 5.5) * 100 = 32.73%\nFactor 3 proportion = (1.2 / 5.5) * 100 = 21.82%\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the proportions of the variance explained by each factor are:\n\nFactor 1: 45.45%\nFactor 2: 32.73%\nFactor 3: 21.82%"
