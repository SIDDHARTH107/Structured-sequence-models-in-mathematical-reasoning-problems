    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters: population size, maximum number of iterations, cognitive and social coefficients, and the velocity limits.\n2. Generate an initial population of particles with random positions and velocities.\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each particle.\n4. Update the personal best and global best positions.\n5. Update the velocities and positions of the particles.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the maximum number of iterations is reached or the convergence criterion is met.\n\nLet's assume the following parameters for the PSO algorithm:\n\n- Population size: 30\n- Maximum number of iterations: 100\n- Cognitive coefficient (c1): 2\n- Social coefficient (c2): 2\n- Velocity limits: [-1, 1]\n\nNow, we will implement the PSO algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters as mentioned above.\n2. Generate an initial population of 30 particles with random positions (x, y) and velocities (vx, vy) within the search space and considering the constraint x+y<=4.\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each particle by calculating the value of f(x, y) for each particle.\n4. Update the personal best positions (pbest) for each particle if the current position has a better fitness value.\n5. Update the global best position (gbest) if any particle has a better fitness value than the current global best.\n6. Update the velocities (vx, vy) and positions (x, y) of the particles using the following equations:\n\n   vx_new = w * vx_old + c1 * rand() * (pbest_x - x_old) + c2 * rand() * (gbest_x - x_old)\n   vy_new = w * vy_old + c1 * rand() * (pbest_y - y_old) + c2 * rand() * (gbest_y - y_old)\n\n   x_new = x_old + vx_new\n   y_new = y_old + vy_new\n\n   where w is the inertia weight, which can be set to a constant value (e.g., 0.7) or can be decreased linearly over the iterations.\n\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 for 100 iterations or until the convergence criterion is met (e.g., the change in gbest is smaller than a predefined threshold).\n\nAfter running the PSO algorithm with the given parameters and problem, we will obtain the optimal values of x and y that minimize the function f(x, y) subject to the constraint x+y<=4. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the PSO algorithm. However, the optimal solution should be close to x=1 and y=3, which gives the minimum value of f(x, y) = 1."
