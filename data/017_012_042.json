A group of order 16 is cyclic if and only if it has an element of order 16. \n\n2. If G is dihedral, then it is isomorphic to D8. A group of order 16 is dihedral if it has an element of order 8 and an element of order 2 that does not commute with the element of order 8.\n\n3. If G is non-abelian, then it is not isomorphic to C16 (since C16 is abelian) and not isomorphic to D8 (since D8 is also abelian). \n\nTo determine which of these properties G has, we can use the Sylow theorems. Since 16 = 2^4, the Sylow 2-subgroups of G have order 16. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G is congruent to 1 mod 2 and divides 16. Thus, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G can be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.\n\nIf G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, then that subgroup is normal in G, and G is a semi-direct product of its Sylow 2-subgroup and a subgroup of order 1 (since 16 is a power of a prime). In this case, G is cyclic and isomorphic to C16.\n\nIf G has more than one Sylow 2-subgroup, then G is not cyclic. If G has an element of order 8 and an element of order 2 that does not commute with the element of order 8, then G is dihedral and isomorphic to D8. Otherwise, G is a non-abelian group of order 16 that is not isomorphic to D8.\n\nIn summary, to determine whether G is isomorphic to C16, D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16, we need to examine the structure of G and its elements. Without more information about G, we cannot definitively determine which group it is isomorphic to."
