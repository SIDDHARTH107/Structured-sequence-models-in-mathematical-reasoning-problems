    "message_2": "To find the volume of the tank using integration, we will first set up the problem using cylindrical shells. Let's consider a thin cylindrical shell with radius r and height h at a distance x from the apex of the cone. The thickness of this shell is dx.\n\nWe know that the radius and height of the cone are related by the ratio 3/4. So, we can write the height of the cone in terms of its radius as:\n\nh = (4/3)r\n\nNow, we need to find the height of the cylindrical shell (h) in terms of x. Using similar triangles, we have:\n\nh/x = 4/3\n\nh = (4/3)x\n\nThe volume of the cylindrical shell is given by:\n\ndV = 2πrh dx\n\nSubstituting h = (4/3)x, we get:\n\ndV = 2πr((4/3)x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the limits of integration. The limits of integration for x will be from 0 to 4, as the height of the cone is 4 meters.\n\nThe volume of the tank is the sum of the volumes of all the cylindrical shells, so we integrate dV with respect to x:\n\nV = ∫(2πr((4/3)x) dx) from 0 to 4\n\nTo find r in terms of x, we can use the similar triangles property again:\n\nr/x = 3/4\n\nr = (3/4)x\n\nNow, substituting r = (3/4)x, we get:\n\nV = ∫(2π((3/4)x)((4/3)x) dx) from 0 to 4\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nV = ∫(6πx^2 dx) from 0 to 4\n\nNow, integrate with respect to x:\n\nV = 6π∫(x^2 dx) from 0 to 4\n\nV = 6π[(1/3)x^3] from 0 to 4\n\nV = 6π[(1/3)(4^3) - (1/3)(0^3)]\n\nV = 6π[(1/3)(64)]\n\nV = 6π(64/3)\n\nV = 128π\n\nSo, the volume of the tank is 128π cubic meters."
