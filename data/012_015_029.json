    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is connected or not, we can use the fact that a graph with n vertices is connected if it has at least (n-1) edges. In this case, n = 10, so the minimum number of edges required for the graph to be connected is (10-1) = 9 edges.\n\nSince the graph G has 17 edges, which is greater than the minimum required 9 edges, we can conclude that the graph is connected.\n\nNow, to find the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph, we can use the fact that removing (n-1) edges from a connected graph with n vertices will disconnect the graph. In this case, n = 10, so removing (10-1) = 9 edges will disconnect the graph.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph G is 9."
