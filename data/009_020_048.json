Determine the optimal control function $u=u(t)$ that minimizes the cost function for $T=4$.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal control function $u(t)$, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, let's define the Hamiltonian function $H$ as follows:\n\n$H(x, y, u, p_x, p_y) = x^2 + u^2 + p_x(y) + p_y(u - 2x)$\n\nwhere $p_x$ and $p_y$ are the costate variables. According to the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the optimal control $u^*(t)$ minimizes the Hamiltonian function. Thus, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial u} = 2u + p_y = 0$\n\nSolving for $u$, we get the optimal control function:\n\n$u^*(t) = -\\frac{1}{2}p_y(t)$\n\nNow, we need to find the costate equations. The costate equations are given by:\n\n$\\frac{dp_x}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = -2x - p_y(-2)$\n\n$\\frac{dp_y}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = -p_x$\n\nNow, we have a system of four first-order differential equations:\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = y$\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{2}p_y - 2x$\n\n$\\frac{dp_x}{dt} = 2x + 2p_y$\n\n$\\frac{dp_y}{dt} = -p_x$\n\nwith the initial conditions $x(0) = 0$, $y(0) = 0$, and the transversality conditions $p_x(T) = 0$ and $p_y(T) = 0$ for $T = 4$.\n\nTo solve this system of differential equations, we can use numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method. However, finding an analytical solution for this system is difficult. Therefore, we will leave the solution in this form:\n\n$u^*(t) = -\\frac{1}{2}p_y(t)$\n\nwhere $p_y(t)$ is the solution of the costate equation system with the given initial and transversality conditions."
