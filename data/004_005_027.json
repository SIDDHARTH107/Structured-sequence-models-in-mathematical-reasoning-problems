    "message_2": "To find the particular solution y(x), we need to integrate the given differential equation and apply the initial condition.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n\ndy/dx = 3x^2 - 6x\n\nNow, we'll integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(dy) = ∫(3x^2 - 6x) dx\n\ny(x) = ∫(3x^2) dx - ∫(6x) dx\n\ny(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + C\n\nNow, we'll apply the initial condition y(0) = 2:\n\n2 = (0)^3 - 3(0)^2 + C\n\n2 = C\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\ny(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2"
