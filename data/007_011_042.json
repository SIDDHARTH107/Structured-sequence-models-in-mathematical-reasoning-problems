In other words, a number x is a quadratic residue modulo p if there exists an integer y such that x ≡ y^2 (mod p).\n\nTo find all quadratic residues of 17, we will calculate the squares of the integers from 1 to 8 (since 17 is a prime number and we only need to check up to (17-1)/2) and then reduce them modulo 17.\n\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 17)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 17)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n4^2 ≡ 16 (mod 17)\n5^2 ≡ 25 ≡ 8 (mod 17)\n6^2 ≡ 36 ≡ 2 (mod 17)\n7^2 ≡ 49 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n8^2 ≡ 64 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n\nThe quadratic residues of 17 are the distinct results we obtained: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16}."
