    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n6x^2 + 12x = 6x(x + 2)\n\nDenominator:\n9x^3 - 3x^2 = 3x^2(3x - 1)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(6x(x + 2)) / (3x^2(3x - 1))\n\nNext, we can simplify the expression by canceling out the common factors:\n\n(2 * 3x(x + 2)) / (3x^2(3x - 1))\n\nThe common factor of 3x can be canceled out:\n\n(2(x + 2)) / (x(3x - 1))\n\nThe simplified rational expression is:\n\n(2(x + 2)) / (x(3x - 1))"
