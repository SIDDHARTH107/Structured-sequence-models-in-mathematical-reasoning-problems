    "message_1": "Consider a market with two firms, A and B, producing a homogeneous product. The inverse demand function for the product is given by P = 30 - Q, where P is the price of the product and Q is the total quantity produced by both firms. The cost function for each firm is C(Q) = 4Q. Determine the Cournot-Nash equilibrium for this market, assuming that each firm chooses its quantity of production simultaneously.",
    "message_2": "To find the Cournot-Nash equilibrium, we first need to find the reaction functions for both firms. The reaction function shows the optimal quantity a firm should produce given the quantity produced by the other firm.\n\nLet qA and qB be the quantities produced by firm A and firm B, respectively. Then, the total quantity produced in the market is Q = qA + qB. The inverse demand function is P = 30 - Q, so the revenue function for each firm is:\n\nRevenue for firm A: R_A = P * qA = (30 - Q) * qA = (30 - (qA + qB)) * qA\nRevenue for firm B: R_B = P * qB = (30 - Q) * qB = (30 - (qA + qB)) * qB\n\nNow, we find the profit function for each firm by subtracting the cost function from the revenue function:\n\nProfit for firm A: π_A = R_A - C(qA) = (30 - (qA + qB)) * qA - 4qA\nProfit for firm B: π_B = R_B - C(qB) = (30 - (qA + qB)) * qB - 4qB\n\nNext, we find the first-order conditions by taking the partial derivatives of the profit functions with respect to each firm's quantity:\n\n∂π_A/∂qA = 26 - 2qA - qB = 0\n∂π_B/∂qB = 26 - 2qB - qA = 0\n\nNow, we solve this system of linear equations to find the Cournot-Nash equilibrium quantities:\n\nFrom the first equation, we get: qB = 26 - 2qA\nSubstitute this into the second equation: 26 - 2(26 - 2qA) - qA = 0\n\nSolve for qA:\n52 - 4qA - qA = 0\n5qA = 52\nqA = 10.4\n\nNow, substitute qA back into the equation for qB:\nqB = 26 - 2(10.4)\nqB = 26 - 20.8\nqB = 5.2\n\nSo, the Cournot-Nash equilibrium quantities are qA = 10.4 and qB = 5.2.\n\nTo find the equilibrium price, substitute these quantities into the inverse demand function:\nP = 30 - Q = 30 - (10.4 + 5.2) = 30 - 15.6 = 14.4\n\nThus, the Cournot-Nash equilibrium for this market is (qA, qB, P) = (10.4, 5.2, 14.4)."
