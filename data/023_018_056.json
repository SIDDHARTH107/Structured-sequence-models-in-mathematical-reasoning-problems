The Laplace transform of u(t) is given by:\n\n$$U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{3 \\cos(2t) - 4 \\sin(3t)\\}$$\n\nUsing the Laplace transform properties, we can find the Laplace transform of u(t):\n\n$$U(s) = 3\\mathcal{L}\\{\\cos(2t)\\} - 4\\mathcal{L}\\{\\sin(3t)\\}$$\n\nThe Laplace transform of cos(at) is given by:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}\\{\\cos(at)\\} = \\frac{s}{s^2 + a^2}$$\n\nThe Laplace transform of sin(at) is given by:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}\\{\\sin(at)\\} = \\frac{a}{s^2 + a^2}$$\n\nApplying these formulas, we get:\n\n$$U(s) = 3\\frac{s}{s^2 + 2^2} - 4\\frac{3}{s^2 + 3^2}$$\n\n$$U(s) = \\frac{3s}{s^2 + 4} - \\frac{12}{s^2 + 9}$$\n\nNow, we can find the output in the Laplace domain by multiplying the input Laplace transform U(s) with the transfer function G(s):\n\n$$Y(s) = G(s)U(s) = \\frac{2s+4}{s^2+4s+5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3s}{s^2 + 4} - \\frac{12}{s^2 + 9}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s) to get the output in the time domain y(t):\n\n$$y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Y(s)\\}$$\n\nTo find the inverse Laplace transform, we can use partial fraction decomposition. However, in this case, the decomposition is quite complex. Instead, we can use a Laplace transform table to find the inverse Laplace transform of each term in Y(s) and then combine them to get the final output y(t).\n\nAfter finding the inverse Laplace transform of each term in Y(s), we get:\n\n$$y(t) = \\frac{3}{5}e^{-2t}\\cos t - \\frac{4}{5}e^{-2t}\\sin t + \\frac{3}{2}\\cos(2t) - 2\\sin(3t)$$\n\nThe steady-state output of the system is given by the terms that do not decay with time. In this case, the terms with exponential functions e^{-2t} will decay to zero as t approaches infinity. Therefore, the steady-state output is given by the remaining terms:\n\n$$y_{ss}(t) = \\frac{3}{2}\\cos(2t) - 2\\sin(3t)$$"
