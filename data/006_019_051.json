    "message_1": "What is the probability of a certain political party winning the election in a country, given that the party has a 60% approval rating in the polls and there are two additional parties competing with approval ratings of 20% and 10% respectively?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of the political party with a 60% approval rating winning the election, we can simply divide their approval rating by the total approval ratings of all three parties.\n\nTotal approval ratings of all three parties = 60% (Party 1) + 20% (Party 2) + 10% (Party 3) = 90%\n\nProbability of Party 1 winning the election = (Party 1's approval rating) / (Total approval ratings)\n\nProbability = (60%) / (90%) = 2/3 = 0.6667 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nSo, the probability of the political party with a 60% approval rating winning the election is approximately 66.67%."
