    "message_2": "To find the number of different 5-card hands that can be dealt from a standard deck of 52 cards, we can use the combination formula. The combination formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial (the product of all positive integers up to that number).\n\nIn this case, n = 52 (total number of cards in the deck) and k = 5 (number of cards in a hand).\n\nC(52, 5) = 52! / (5!(52-5)!)\n\nC(52, 5) = 52! / (5!47!)\n\nC(52, 5) = (52 × 51 × 50 × 49 × 48) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(52, 5) = 2,598,960\n\nSo, there are 2,598,960 different 5-card hands that can be dealt from a standard deck of 52 cards."
