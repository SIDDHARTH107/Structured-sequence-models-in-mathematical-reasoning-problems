    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of a graph G, we need to use the following recursive formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G/e; x, y) if e is not a loop or a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = x * T(G - e; x, y) if e is a loop, and\nT(G; x, y) = y * T(G - e; x, y) if e is a bridge.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific structure of the graph G, we cannot compute the Tutte polynomial directly. The Tutte polynomial depends on the arrangement of vertices and edges in the graph, and there can be multiple graphs with 6 vertices and 8 edges.\n\nIf you provide more information about the graph, such as its adjacency matrix or a list of its edges, we can compute the Tutte polynomial for that specific graph."
