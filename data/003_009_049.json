    "message_2": "In a right-angled triangle, the sum of the other two angles is 90 degrees. Since one angle is 30 degrees, the other angle must be 60 degrees. This means we have a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the side lengths have a specific ratio. The side opposite the 30-degree angle (the shortest side) is half the length of the hypotenuse, and the side opposite the 60-degree angle (the longer leg) is the square root of 3 times the shortest side.\n\nSince the hypotenuse is 10 cm, the shortest side (opposite the 30-degree angle) is 10/2 = 5 cm. The longer leg (opposite the 60-degree angle) is 5 * sqrt(3) cm.\n\nTo find the perimeter, add the side lengths together: 5 cm + 5 * sqrt(3) cm + 10 cm = 15 cm + 5 * sqrt(3) cm."
