    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products A and B. The production process of A requires 2 hours of machine time and 3 hours of labor time, while the process of B requires 1 hour of machine time and 5 hours of labor time. The total available machine time is 40 hours and the total available labor time is 60 hours. The profit per unit of A is $5 and the profit per unit of B is $4. How many units of A and B should the factory produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal number of units of A and B to produce. Let x be the number of units of A and y be the number of units of B. We can set up the following linear programming problem:\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 5x + 4y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Machine time: 2x + y ≤ 40\n2. Labor time: 3x + 5y ≤ 60\n3. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 40\ny ≤ -2x + 40\n\n2. 3x + 5y ≤ 60\ny ≤ (-3/5)x + 12\n\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region:\n1. Intersection of y = -2x + 40 and y = (-3/5)x + 12\n-2x + 40 = (-3/5)x + 12\n(7/5)x = 28\nx = 20\ny = -2(20) + 40 = 0\n\nVertex 1: (20, 0)\n\n2. Intersection of y = (-3/5)x + 12 and x-axis (y = 0)\n0 = (-3/5)x + 12\nx = 20\n\nVertex 2: (20, 0) (same as Vertex 1)\n\n3. Intersection of y = -2x + 40 and y-axis (x = 0)\ny = -2(0) + 40\ny = 40\n\nVertex 3: (0, 40)\n\n4. Intersection of y = (-3/5)x + 12 and x-axis (y = 0)\n0 = (-3/5)x + 12\nx = 20\n\nVertex 4: (20, 0) (same as Vertex 1)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(20, 0) = 5(20) + 4(0) = 100\n2. P(0, 40) = 5(0) + 4(40) = 160\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex (0, 40), which means the factory should produce 0 units of A and 40 units of B to maximize their profit. The maximum profit will be $160."
