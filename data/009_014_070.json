    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nA certain population of bacteria has a carrying capacity of 250, and currently has a population of 75. The rate of growth at any time is proportional to both the current population and the difference between the carrying capacity and the current population. If the initial growth rate is 5 bacteria per hour, write a logistic growth model and use it to find the population of bacteria after 10 hours (rounded to the nearest whole number).",
    "message_2": "To create a logistic growth model, we can use the following equation:\n\ndP/dt = r * P * (1 - P/K)\n\nwhere:\n- dP/dt is the rate of population growth\n- r is the growth rate constant\n- P is the current population\n- K is the carrying capacity\n\nWe are given that the initial growth rate is 5 bacteria per hour when the population is 75. We can use this information to find the growth rate constant (r).\n\n5 = r * 75 * (1 - 75/250)\n\nSolving for r:\n\n5 = r * 75 * (175/250)\n5 = r * 75 * (7/10)\nr = 5 / (75 * 7/10)\nr = 50/21\n\nNow that we have the growth rate constant, we can write the logistic growth model:\n\ndP/dt = (50/21) * P * (1 - P/250)\n\nTo find the population after 10 hours, we need to solve this differential equation. We can use the following formula for logistic growth:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P₀) / P₀ * e^(-r*t))\n\nwhere:\n- P(t) is the population at time t\n- P₀ is the initial population\n- t is the time in hours\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nP(10) = 250 / (1 + (250 - 75) / 75 * e^(-(50/21)*10))\n\nP(10) = 250 / (1 + 175 / 75 * e^(-500/21))\n\nNow, we can calculate the population after 10 hours:\n\nP(10) ≈ 250 / (1 + 2.333 * e^(-23.81))\nP(10) ≈ 250 / (1 + 0.012)\nP(10) ≈ 250 / 1.012\nP(10) ≈ 246.53\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, the population of bacteria after 10 hours is approximately 247."
