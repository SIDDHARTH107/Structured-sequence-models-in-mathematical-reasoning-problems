    "message_2": "To determine whether the set A = {1} ∪ {2} is compact in X, we need to show that every open cover of A has a finite subcover.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary open cover of A. Since A has only two points, 1 and 2, there must be at least one open set U_1 in the open cover that contains 1, and at least one open set U_2 in the open cover that contains 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the subspace topology on X. Since X = [0, 1] ∪ [2, 3], any open set in X can be written as the union of open intervals in [0, 1] and [2, 3]. Therefore, U_1 must contain an open interval around 1, and U_2 must contain an open interval around 2.\n\nSince U_1 contains 1 and U_2 contains 2, the sets U_1 and U_2 together cover A. Thus, we have found a finite subcover of the open cover, consisting of just U_1 and U_2.\n\nSince we have shown that every open cover of A has a finite subcover, we can conclude that A is compact in X."
