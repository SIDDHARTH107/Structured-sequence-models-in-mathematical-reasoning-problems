    "message_1": "A local ice cream parlor sells cones and sundaes. The owner wants to maximize profits by setting the prices. The cost of producing one cone is $1.50, and the cost of producing one sundae is $2.00. The parlor has estimated the following demand equations:\n\n- Cones: Q = 200 - 10P\n- Sundaes: Q = 150 - 5P\n\nWhere Q is the quantity of ice cream sold and P is the price of one item.\n\nWhat should be the price of cones and sundaes to maximize the total profit of the ice cream parlor, assuming that all the ice cream produced is sold?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total profit, we need to find the price for cones and sundaes that maximizes the profit function for each item. The profit function for each item is given by:\n\nProfit = (Price - Cost) * Quantity\n\nFor cones, let's denote the price as Pc and the quantity as Qc. The profit function for cones is:\n\nProfit_c = (Pc - 1.50) * (200 - 10Pc)\n\nFor sundaes, let's denote the price as Ps and the quantity as Qs. The profit function for sundaes is:\n\nProfit_s = (Ps - 2.00) * (150 - 5Ps)\n\nTo maximize the profit functions, we need to find the critical points by taking the first derivative with respect to the price and setting it equal to zero.\n\nFor cones:\n\nd(Profit_c)/dPc = (200 - 10Pc) * (-10) + (Pc - 1.50) * (-10) = 0\n\nSolving for Pc:\n\n-2000 + 100Pc + 10Pc - 15 = 0\n110Pc = 2015\nPc = 2015 / 110\nPc ≈ 18.32\n\nFor sundaes:\n\nd(Profit_s)/dPs = (150 - 5Ps) * (-5) + (Ps - 2.00) * (-5) = 0\n\nSolving for Ps:\n\n-750 + 25Ps + 5Ps - 10 = 0\n30Ps = 760\nPs = 760 / 30\nPs ≈ 25.33\n\nSo, to maximize the total profit, the ice cream parlor should set the price of cones at approximately $18.32 and the price of sundaes at approximately $25.33."
