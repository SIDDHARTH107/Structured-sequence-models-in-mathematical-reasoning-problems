    "message_1": "A lighthouse is 100 feet high. A ship is approaching the shore and the angle of depression to the top of the lighthouse is 25 degrees. How far is the ship from the base of the lighthouse? Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a foot.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. We have the angle of depression (25 degrees) and the height of the lighthouse (100 feet). We can set up a right triangle with the height of the lighthouse as the opposite side, and the distance from the ship to the base of the lighthouse as the adjacent side.\n\nWe can use the formula:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite/adjacent\n\nIn this case:\n\ntan(25) = 100/adjacent\n\nNow, we need to solve for the adjacent side (the distance from the ship to the base of the lighthouse):\n\nadjacent = 100/tan(25)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nadjacent â‰ˆ 213.2 feet\n\nSo, the ship is approximately 213.2 feet away from the base of the lighthouse."
