    "message_1": "A plane is flying with a velocity of 500 km/h towards east. If the wind is blowing from north with a velocity of 100 km/h, what is the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity of the plane? Use trigonometry to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the resultant velocity of the plane, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry.\n\nLet Vp be the velocity of the plane (500 km/h east), Vw be the velocity of the wind (100 km/h north), and Vr be the resultant velocity.\n\nWe can represent the velocities as vectors. The eastward velocity (Vp) can be represented as a vector along the x-axis, and the northward velocity (Vw) can be represented as a vector along the y-axis.\n\nVp = 500i (east)\nVw = 100j (north)\n\nTo find the resultant velocity (Vr), we can add the two vectors:\n\nVr = Vp + Vw\nVr = (500i + 100j)\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the resultant velocity using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n|Vr| = √((500)^2 + (100)^2)\n|Vr| = √(250000 + 10000)\n|Vr| = √260000\n|Vr| ≈ 509.9 km/h\n\nNext, we can find the direction of the resultant velocity using trigonometry. We can use the arctangent function to find the angle θ between the resultant velocity and the eastward direction (x-axis):\n\ntan(θ) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(θ) = (100) / (500)\n\nθ = arctan(100/500)\nθ ≈ 11.3° (north of east)\n\nSo, the magnitude of the resultant velocity of the plane is approximately 509.9 km/h, and its direction is 11.3° north of east."
