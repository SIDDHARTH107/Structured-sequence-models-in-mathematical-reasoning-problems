    "message_2": "To determine the possible numbers of Sylow 3-subgroups in a group of order 24, we use Sylow's Theorems. Let G be a group of order 24, and let n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of G. By Sylow's Theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_3 divides the order of G, which is 24.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Among these, only 1 and 4 satisfy the second condition (being congruent to 1 modulo 3). Therefore, there are either 1 or 4 Sylow 3-subgroups in a group of order 24.\n\nNow, let's discuss how this result leads to the existence of the five non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\n1. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it is normal in G. In this case, G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup as well (by a similar argument using Sylow's Theorems). This leads to the two non-abelian groups: the semidirect product of Z_3 and Z_8 (Z_3 ⋊ Z_8) and the semidirect product of Z_3 and Z_4 × Z_2 (Z_3 ⋊ (Z_4 × Z_2)).\n\n2. If there are four Sylow 3-subgroups, then G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup. This leads to the three non-abelian groups: the semidirect product of Z_3 × Z_3 and Z_2 (Z_3 × Z_3 ⋊ Z_2), the semidirect product of Z_3 and Z_4 × Z_2 with a different action than in case 1 (Z_3 ⋊' (Z_4 × Z_2)), and the semidirect product of Z_3 × Z_3 and Z_2 with a different action than in case 1 (Z_3 × Z_3 ⋊' Z_2).\n\nIn summary, there are two possibilities for the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in a group of order 24: either 1 or 4. This result, combined with the properties of Sylow 2-subgroups, leads to the existence of the five non-abelian groups of order 24."
