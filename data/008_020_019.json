    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the matrix method, we first need to represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  3  5 | 10 ]\n[ 3  2  4 |  8 ]\n[ 4  5  3 | 12 ]\n```\n\nHowever, the matrix method for solving systems of linear equations with non-square matrices is not applicable here, as the given matrix is already a square matrix (3x3). Instead, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to solve this system.\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have the largest pivot element in the first row:\n\n```\n[ 3  2  4 |  8 ]\n[ 2  3  5 | 10 ]\n[ 4  5  3 | 12 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element in Row 2 and Row 3:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - (2/3) * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - (4/3) * Row 1\n\n```\n[  3   2    4  |   8  ]\n[  0   5/3  7/3 |  2/3 ]\n[  0   7/3  1/3 |  4/3 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Multiply Row 2 by 3/5 to make the pivot element 1:\n\n```\n[  3   2    4  |   8  ]\n[  0   1    7/5 |  2/5 ]\n[  0   7/3  1/3 |  4/3 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the second element in Row 3:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - (7/3) * Row 2\n\n```\n[  3   2    4  |   8  ]\n[  0   1    7/5 |  2/5 ]\n[  0   0   -8/5 |  6/5 ]\n```\n\nStep 5: Multiply Row 3 by -5/8 to make the pivot element 1:\n\n```\n[  3   2    4  |   8  ]\n[  0   1    7/5 |  2/5 ]\n[  0   0    1   | -3/4 ]\n```\n\nNow we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = -3/4\n\ny = (2/5) - (7/5) * z = 1\n\nx = (8 - 2y - 4z) / 3 = 2\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 1, and z = -3/4."
