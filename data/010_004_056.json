    "message_1": "Let X = [0,1] and Y = [0,2]. Define a continuous function f: X → Y. Is f a uniformly continuous function?",
    "message_2": "Yes, f is a uniformly continuous function.\n\nTo show that f is uniformly continuous, we need to prove that for any ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that for any x, y in X, if |x - y| < δ, then |f(x) - f(y)| < ε.\n\nSince f is continuous on the compact interval X = [0, 1], it is also uniformly continuous on X. This is a consequence of the Heine-Cantor theorem, which states that any continuous function defined on a compact set is uniformly continuous.\n\nTherefore, f is a uniformly continuous function on X."
