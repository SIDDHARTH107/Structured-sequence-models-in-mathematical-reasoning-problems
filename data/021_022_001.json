    "message_1": "Sure, here's an example numerical problem for a math student to solve using the Firefly Algorithm to optimize the solution:\n\nA company is planning to release two new products in the coming year, a smartphone and a tablet. The cost of producing each smartphone is $200 and the cost of producing each tablet is $300. They estimate that they can sell the smartphones for $600 each and the tablets for $800 each. They want to maximize their profits while producing no more than 500 units of each product. Using the Firefly Algorithm, determine how many smartphones and tablets they should produce to maximize their profits.",
    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies. It is typically used for continuous optimization problems, while the given problem is a discrete optimization problem. However, we can still attempt to apply the Firefly Algorithm to this problem, but the final solution may need to be rounded to the nearest integer values.\n\nLet x be the number of smartphones and y be the number of tablets produced. The objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 400x + 500y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\nx + y ≤ 500\n\nTo apply the Firefly Algorithm, we need to define the following parameters:\n\n1. Number of fireflies (n): This is the number of potential solutions that the algorithm will explore. Let's choose n = 50.\n2. Light intensity (I): This represents the quality of a solution. In this case, it is the profit value.\n3. Attractiveness (β): This is a function of the distance between two fireflies. It determines how much a firefly is attracted to another firefly with higher light intensity.\n4. Randomization parameter (α): This controls the randomness in the movement of fireflies.\n\nNow, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the positions of the n fireflies randomly within the feasible region.\n2. Evaluate the light intensity (profit) for each firefly.\n3. Update the positions of the fireflies based on their attractiveness and the randomization parameter.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a predetermined number of iterations or until convergence.\n\nAfter running the Firefly Algorithm, we will obtain the optimal (or near-optimal) values for x and y. Since the number of smartphones and tablets must be integers, we will round the values to the nearest integers.\n\nPlease note that the Firefly Algorithm may not guarantee an optimal solution for this problem, as it is designed for continuous optimization problems. For a more accurate solution, you may consider using integer programming or other combinatorial optimization techniques."
