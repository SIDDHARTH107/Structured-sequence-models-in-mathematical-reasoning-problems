    "message_1": "Consider the system of linear equations:\n2x + y = 5\n4x + 2y = 11\n\nSolve the system of equations using gaussian elimination, and find the solution for the variables x and y. However, this time, the coefficient matrix has an ill-conditioned matrix of:\n[2 1]\n[4 2] \n\nRound off the values of x and y to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "First, let's write down the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n[2  1 | 5]\n[4  2 | 11]\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to find the solution for x and y.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1 in the first row:\n\n[1  0.5 | 2.5]\n[4  2  | 11]\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with the second row minus 4 times the first row to eliminate the leading 4 in the second row:\n\n[1  0.5 |  2.5]\n[0  0   |  1]\n\nNotice that we have a row of all zeros except for the last entry, which means the system is inconsistent and has no solution. Therefore, there is no solution for x and y in this system of linear equations."
