    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 27, we will use the fact that 27 = 3^3. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of groups of order p^n (where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer) is determined by the number of partitions of n.\n\nIn our case, p = 3 and n = 3. There are two partitions of 3: 3 itself and 1+1+1. This means that there are two non-isomorphic groups of order 27. One of them is the abelian group Z_27 (the cyclic group of order 27), and the other is a non-abelian group.\n\nNow let's show that the non-abelian group of order 27 is one of them. Consider the group G with the following presentation:\n\nG = ⟨a, b | a^9 = b^3 = 1, b^(-1) * a * b = a^4⟩\n\nThis group has order 27 since there are 9 possible powers of a and 3 possible powers of b, and the relations show that every element of G can be written in the form a^i * b^j, where 0 ≤ i ≤ 8 and 0 ≤ j ≤ 2.\n\nTo show that G is non-abelian, we can check that the commutator [a, b] = a^(-1) * b^(-1) * a * b is not equal to the identity element:\n\n[a, b] = a^(-1) * b^(-1) * a * b = a^8 * b^2 * a * b = a^8 * b^2 * a^4 * b = a^(8+4) * b^2 * b = a^3 ≠ 1\n\nThus, G is a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nFinally, we need to prove that there cannot be any other non-isomorphic group of order 27. Suppose there exists another non-isomorphic group H of order 27. Since we already know that there are only two non-isomorphic groups of order 27, H must be isomorphic to either Z_27 or G.\n\nIf H is isomorphic to Z_27, then H is abelian, which contradicts the assumption that H is non-abelian. If H is isomorphic to G, then H is not distinct from G, which contradicts the assumption that H is another non-isomorphic group of order 27.\n\nTherefore, there cannot be any other non-isomorphic group of order 27 besides Z_27 and G."
