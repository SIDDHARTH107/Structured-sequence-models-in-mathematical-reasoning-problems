Let $f:M\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a Morse function with only two critical points, one of index $k$ and one of index $n-k$, where $0<k<n/2$. Using Morse homology and the coefficients of a field $F$, compute the rank of $H_{k}(M;F)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the rank of $H_k(M; F)$ using Morse homology, we first need to understand the Morse complex $C_*(M; F)$ and the boundary operator $\\partial_*: C_* \\to C_{*-1}$.\n\nSince $f$ has only two critical points, the Morse complex $C_*(M; F)$ is concentrated in degrees $k$ and $n-k$. Let $x$ and $y$ be the critical points of index $k$ and $n-k$, respectively. Then, $C_k(M; F) = Fx$ and $C_{n-k}(M; F) = Fy$, where $Fx$ and $Fy$ are free $F$-modules generated by $x$ and $y$.\n\nNow, we need to compute the boundary operator $\\partial_*$. Since there are no critical points of index $k-1$ and $n-k-1$, we have $\\partial_k = 0$ and $\\partial_{n-k+1} = 0$. Therefore, the only non-trivial boundary map is $\\partial_{n-k}: C_{n-k}(M; F) \\to C_k(M; F)$.\n\nTo compute $\\partial_{n-k}(y)$, we need to count the number of gradient flow lines from $y$ to $x$ mod $F$. Let $N$ be the number of such flow lines. Then, $\\partial_{n-k}(y) = N \\cdot x$.\n\nNow, we can compute the homology groups. Since $\\partial_k = 0$, we have $H_k(M; F) = \\ker \\partial_k / \\operatorname{im} \\partial_{n-k} = C_k(M; F) / \\operatorname{im} \\partial_{n-k}$. Since $\\partial_{n-k}(y) = N \\cdot x$, the rank of $H_k(M; F)$ is given by the rank of $C_k(M; F)$ modulo the rank of $\\operatorname{im} \\partial_{n-k}$.\n\nIf $N \\neq 0$ mod $F$, then $\\operatorname{im} \\partial_{n-k} = Fx$, and the rank of $H_k(M; F)$ is $0$. If $N = 0$ mod $F$, then $\\operatorname{im} \\partial_{n-k} = 0$, and the rank of $H_k(M; F)$ is the rank of $C_k(M; F)$, which is $1$.\n\nIn conclusion, the rank of $H_k(M; F)$ is $1$ if the number of gradient flow lines from the critical point of index $n-k$ to the critical point of index $k$ is $0$ mod $F$, and $0$ otherwise."
