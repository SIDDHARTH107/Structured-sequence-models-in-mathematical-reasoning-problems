    "message_2": "To solve the complex number equation 2z^2 + 5z + 3i = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 5, and c = 3i. Let's plug these values into the formula:\n\nz = (-(5) ± √((5)^2 - 4(2)(3i))) / 2(2)\n\nz = (-5 ± √(25 - 24i)) / 4\n\nNow, we need to simplify the expression inside the square root. To do this, we can rewrite the square root of a complex number in polar form. Let's first find the magnitude and argument of the complex number 25 - 24i:\n\nMagnitude: r = √(Re^2 + Im^2) = √(25^2 + (-24)^2) = √(625 + 576) = √1201\n\nArgument: θ = arctan(Im/Re) = arctan(-24/25)\n\nNow we can write the complex number in polar form:\n\n25 - 24i = √1201 * (cos(θ) + i*sin(θ))\n\nTaking the square root of a complex number in polar form involves taking the square root of the magnitude and dividing the argument by 2:\n\n√(25 - 24i) = √(√1201) * (cos(θ/2) + i*sin(θ/2))\n\nNow we can substitute this back into our original equation:\n\nz = (-5 ± (√(√1201) * (cos(θ/2) + i*sin(θ/2)))) / 4\n\nWe have two solutions for z, one with the positive square root and one with the negative square root:\n\nz1 = (-5 + (√(√1201) * (cos(θ/2) + i*sin(θ/2)))) / 4\nz2 = (-5 - (√(√1201) * (cos(θ/2) + i*sin(θ/2)))) / 4\n\nThese are the two complex solutions to the equation 2z^2 + 5z + 3i = 0."
