    "message_1": "Here's a problem for a math student related to non-parametric statistics:\n\n\"Suppose you have two independent samples of numerical data and want to test if their medians are equal using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Sample A has 8 observations with a median of 5.5 and sample B has 10 observations with a median of 7. Calculate the test statistic, U, and find the p-value for a two-sided test with α = 0.05.\"",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we first need to combine the two samples and rank the observations from smallest to largest. However, we don't have the actual observations, only the medians. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact U statistic and p-value for this problem.\n\nIn general, to calculate the U statistic, you would follow these steps:\n\n1. Combine the two samples and rank the observations from smallest to largest.\n2. Calculate the sum of the ranks for each sample (R1 for sample A and R2 for sample B).\n3. Calculate the U statistic for each sample using the following formulas:\n\n   U1 = R1 - (n1 * (n1 + 1)) / 2\n   U2 = R2 - (n2 * (n2 + 1)) / 2\n\n   where n1 and n2 are the number of observations in samples A and B, respectively.\n\n4. The smaller of the two U values (U1 and U2) is the test statistic.\n\nTo find the p-value, you would compare the test statistic to the critical values of the Wilcoxon rank-sum distribution for the given sample sizes and α level. If the test statistic is smaller than the critical value, you would reject the null hypothesis that the medians are equal.\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, we cannot perform these calculations without the actual observations."
