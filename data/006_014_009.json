    "message_1": "A certain technological system has two critical components that can fail independently. The probability that the first component fails is 0.1 and the probability that the second component fails is 0.05. What is the probability that at least one component fails?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one component fails, we can use the complementary probability that neither component fails and subtract it from 1.\n\nThe probability that the first component does not fail is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\nThe probability that the second component does not fail is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the components fail independently, the probability that both components do not fail is the product of their individual probabilities of not failing:\n\nP(neither fails) = P(first does not fail) * P(second does not fail) = 0.9 * 0.95 = 0.855.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one component fails by subtracting the probability that neither fails from 1:\n\nP(at least one fails) = 1 - P(neither fails) = 1 - 0.855 = 0.145.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one component fails is 0.145."
