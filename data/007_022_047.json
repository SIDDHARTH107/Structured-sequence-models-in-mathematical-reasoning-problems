    "message_2": "To find the order of the point (2, 2) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 5 over the field Z11, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that n * (2, 2) = O, where O is the point at infinity (the identity element for elliptic curve addition).\n\nWe will use the elliptic curve point addition formula to find multiples of the point (2, 2) until we reach the point at infinity. The formula for point addition is as follows:\n\nIf P = (x1, y1) and Q = (x2, y2), then P + Q = (x3, y3), where\nx3 = (λ^2 - x1 - x2) mod p\ny3 = (λ(x1 - x3) - y1) mod p\nλ = (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1) mod p\n\nFor point doubling (P = Q), the formula for λ is:\nλ = (3x1^2 + a) * (2y1)^(-1) mod p\n\nHere, a = 5 and p = 11.\n\nLet's compute the multiples of (2, 2):\n\n1 * (2, 2) = (2, 2)\n\nFor point doubling, we have:\nλ = (3 * 2^2 + 5) * (2 * 2)^(-1) mod 11\nλ = (12 + 5) * 4^(-1) mod 11\nλ = 17 * 3 mod 11\nλ = 51 mod 11\nλ = 7\n\nx3 = (7^2 - 2 - 2) mod 11\nx3 = (49 - 4) mod 11\nx3 = 45 mod 11\nx3 = 1\n\ny3 = (7 * (2 - 1) - 2) mod 11\ny3 = (7 - 2) mod 11\ny3 = 5 mod 11\ny3 = 5\n\n2 * (2, 2) = (1, 5)\n\nNow, let's add (2, 2) and (1, 5):\nλ = (5 - 2) * (1 - 2)^(-1) mod 11\nλ = 3 * (-1)^(-1) mod 11\nλ = 3 * 11 mod 11\nλ = 33 mod 11\nλ = 0\n\nSince λ = 0, this means that the sum of the points (2, 2) and (1, 5) is the point at infinity O.\n\nThus, the order of the point (2, 2) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 5 over the field Z11 is 3."
