    "message_2": "To find the expected number of pedestrians hit by a car daily, we can multiply the probability of a pedestrian being hit by a car (0.02) by the total number of pedestrians crossing the road every day (500).\n\nExpected number of pedestrians hit daily = (Probability of being hit) × (Total number of pedestrians)\n= 0.02 × 500\n= 10\n\nSo, the expected number of pedestrians that will be hit by a car daily is 10."
