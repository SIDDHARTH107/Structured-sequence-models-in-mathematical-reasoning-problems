    "message_1": "Consider the following homogeneous system of linear equations:\n\nx - 2y + z = 0\\\n2x + y - 3z = 0\\\n3x - y + 4z = 0\n\nWhat are the values of x, y, and z that satisfy this system of equations?",
    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we'll write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n| 1 -2  1 | 0 |\n| 2  1 -3 | 0 |\n| 3 -1  4 | 0 |\n\nNow, we'll perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1 -2  1 | 0 |\n| 0  5 -5 | 0 |\n| 0  5 -1 | 0 |\n\n2. Divide the second row by 5:\n\n| 1 -2  1 | 0 |\n| 0  1 -1 | 0 |\n| 0  5 -1 | 0 |\n\n3. Subtract 5 times the second row from the third row, and add 2 times the second row to the first row:\n\n| 1  0  1 | 0 |\n| 0  1 -1 | 0 |\n| 0  0  4 | 0 |\n\n4. Divide the third row by 4:\n\n| 1  0  1 | 0 |\n| 0  1 -1 | 0 |\n| 0  0  1 | 0 |\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 0.\n\nFrom the second row, we have y - z = y = 0.\n\nFrom the first row, we have x + z = x = 0.\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
