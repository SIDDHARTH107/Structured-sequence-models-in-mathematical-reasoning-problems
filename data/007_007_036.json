    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n2x + 3y = 13\n\nNow, we need to find positive integer solutions for x and y. We can start by finding a particular solution and then using the general solution formula for Diophantine equations.\n\nLet's try different values for x and see if we can find a positive integer value for y:\n\n1. If x = 1, then 2(1) + 3y = 13, which gives y = (13 - 2) / 3 = 11 / 3, which is not an integer.\n2. If x = 2, then 2(2) + 3y = 13, which gives y = (13 - 4) / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3.\n\nSo, we have found a particular solution: x = 2 and y = 3.\n\nNow, let's find the general solution for the Diophantine equation. The general solution for the equation ax + by = c, where a and b are coefficients, and c is a constant, is given by:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere x0 and y0 are the particular solution, d is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b, and n is an integer.\n\nIn our case, a = 2, b = 3, and d = GCD(2, 3) = 1. So, the general solution is:\n\nx = 2 + 3n\ny = 3 - 2n\n\nNow, we need to find the positive integer solutions for x and y. Let's try different values for n:\n\n1. If n = 0, then x = 2 and y = 3, which is the particular solution we found earlier.\n2. If n = 1, then x = 2 + 3(1) = 5 and y = 3 - 2(1) = 1. This is another positive integer solution: x = 5 and y = 1.\n\nIf we try n = 2 or greater, we will get negative values for y, which are not allowed in this problem.\n\nSo, the positive integer solutions for the Diophantine equation 4x + 6y = 26 are (x, y) = (2, 3) and (x, y) = (5, 1)."
