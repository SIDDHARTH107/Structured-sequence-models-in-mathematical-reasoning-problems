    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for the student to solve:\n\n\"A particle with a mass of 0.5 kg is moving in a straight line with a velocity of 2 m/s. After 3 seconds, its velocity changes to 6 m/s due to a constant force acting on it. Calculate the magnitude of the force acting on the particle.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n\nFirst, we need to find the acceleration of the particle. Acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time it takes for the change to occur. In this case, the initial velocity (v1) is 2 m/s, the final velocity (v2) is 6 m/s, and the time (t) is 3 seconds.\n\nAcceleration (a) = (v2 - v1) / t\na = (6 m/s - 2 m/s) / 3 s\na = 4 m/s / 3 s\na = 4/3 m/s²\n\nNow that we have the acceleration, we can find the force acting on the particle using Newton's second law:\n\nForce (F) = mass (m) × acceleration (a)\nF = 0.5 kg × 4/3 m/s²\nF = 2/3 kg·m/s²\nF = 2/3 N\n\nSo, the magnitude of the force acting on the particle is 2/3 N (Newtons)."
