    "message_2": "To find the y-intercept, we need to determine the value of y when x = 0. Plugging x = 0 into the equation:\n\ny = 2(0) + 5\ny = 0 + 5\ny = 5\n\nSo, the y-intercept is at the point (0, 5).\n\nTo find the x-intercept, we need to determine the value of x when y = 0. Plugging y = 0 into the equation:\n\n0 = 2x + 5\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n-5 = 2x\nx = -5/2\nx = -2.5\n\nSo, the x-intercept is at the point (-2.5, 0)."
