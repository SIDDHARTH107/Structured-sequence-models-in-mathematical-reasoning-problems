    "message_1": "A math class consists of 25 students with test scores ranging from 55 to 98. Determine if there are any outliers in the data using the Z-score and Tukey's method. Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there are any outliers in the data using the Z-score and Tukey's method, we first need to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and interquartile range (IQR) of the test scores.\n\nHowever, we don't have the individual test scores, so we cannot calculate the exact mean, standard deviation, and IQR. We can only provide the general method to identify outliers using Z-score and Tukey's method.\n\n1. Z-score method:\na. Calculate the mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ) of the test scores.\nb. Calculate the Z-score for each test score using the formula: Z = (X - µ) / σ\nc. Determine the critical Z-value for the given significance level (0.05). For a two-tailed test, the critical Z-value is approximately ±1.96.\nd. If the Z-score of any test score is less than -1.96 or greater than 1.96, it is considered an outlier.\n\n2. Tukey's method:\na. Calculate the first quartile (Q1), the third quartile (Q3), and the interquartile range (IQR) of the test scores. IQR = Q3 - Q1.\nb. Determine the lower and upper bounds for outliers using the formulas: Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR and Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR.\nc. If any test score is less than the lower bound or greater than the upper bound, it is considered an outlier.\n\nWithout the individual test scores, we cannot determine if there are any outliers in the data. However, you can follow these steps to identify outliers if you have the complete dataset."
