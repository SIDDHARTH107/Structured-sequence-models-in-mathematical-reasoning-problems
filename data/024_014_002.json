    "message_1": "A precise numerical problem for the student to solve could be: \n\nLet M be the manifold defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 in R^3, with the vector field V = (xy, yz, zx). Determine the Lie derivative of V with respect to the vector field X = (x, y, z) at the point p = (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3).",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of V with respect to X, we first need to find the Lie bracket [X, V]. The Lie bracket of two vector fields X and V is defined as [X, V] = (X(V) - V(X)), where X(V) and V(X) are the action of the vector fields on each other.\n\nLet X = (x, y, z) and V = (xy, yz, zx). Then, we compute the action of X on V and V on X:\n\nX(V) = x ∂/∂x (xy) + y ∂/∂y (yz) + z ∂/∂z (zx)\n     = x(y + 0) + y(0 + z) + z(x + 0)\n     = xy + yz + xz\n\nV(X) = xy ∂/∂x (x) + yz ∂/∂y (y) + zx ∂/∂z (z)\n     = xy(1) + yz(1) + zx(1)\n     = xy + yz + zx\n\nNow, we compute the Lie bracket [X, V] = X(V) - V(X):\n\n[X, V] = (xy + yz + xz) - (xy + yz + zx)\n       = 0\n\nThe Lie derivative of V with respect to X is zero. Therefore, at the point p = (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3), the Lie derivative of V with respect to X is also zero."
