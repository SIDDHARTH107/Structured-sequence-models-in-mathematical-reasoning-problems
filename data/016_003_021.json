    "message_2": "The largest \"bulb\" of the Mandelbrot Set, centered at (-1.75, 0), is the cardioid-shaped region attached to the main body of the set. The area of this cardioid can be calculated using the formula for the area of a cardioid:\n\nArea = (1/2) * π * a^2\n\nwhere 'a' is the radius of the cardioid. In the case of the Mandelbrot Set, the radius of the largest bulb is 1/4. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * π * (1/4)^2\nArea = (1/2) * π * (1/16)\nArea = π/32\n\nSo, the area of the largest \"bulb\" of the Mandelbrot Set centered at (-1.75, 0) is π/32 or approximately 0.09817477042."
