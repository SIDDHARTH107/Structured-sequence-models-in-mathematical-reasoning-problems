    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4} = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, we need to show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to intersection. Commutativity means that the order of the operation does not matter, i.e., A ∆ B = B ∆ A. However, this is not what we are asked to prove. We are asked to prove that the symmetric difference is not commutative with respect to intersection, which means we need to show that (A ∆ B) ∩ A ≠ A ∩ (B ∆ A).\n\nWe have already found A ∆ B = {1, 5}. Now let's find B ∆ A:\n\nB ∆ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB ∩ A = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nB ∆ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4} = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find (A ∆ B) ∩ A and A ∩ (B ∆ A):\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ A = {1, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4} = {1}\nA ∩ (B ∆ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ {1, 5} = {1}\n\nSince (A ∆ B) ∩ A = A ∩ (B ∆ A), the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to intersection. However, the original problem statement asked to show that it is not commutative. This is a contradiction, and the problem statement is incorrect. The symmetric difference of A and B is indeed commutative with respect to intersection."
