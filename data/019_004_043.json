    "message_2": "To find the smallest natural number n, we need to find a number such that its last two digits plus any number between 1 and 19 results in 21. Let's start by finding the smallest number that ends in 21 when added to 19.\n\n21 - 19 = 2\n\nSo, the smallest natural number n is 2. When we count from 2 to 21 (2 + 19), we will encounter the number 21, which has the last two digits of the current year (2021)."
