    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n6x^2 - 12x = 6x(x - 2)\n\nDenominator:\n2x^2 - 4x = 2x(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can write the rational expression as:\n\n(6x(x - 2)) / (2x(x - 2))\n\nSince (x - 2) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out:\n\n(6x) / (2x)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression by dividing both terms by their greatest common divisor, which is 2x:\n\n(6x) / (2x) = (6/2)(x/x) = 3\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n3"
