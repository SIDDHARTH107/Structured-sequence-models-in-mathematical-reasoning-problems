    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, player 1 is given $10 and is tasked with deciding how much money to give to player 2. If player 2 accepts the amount given by player 1, they each keep their respective amounts of money. However, if player 2 rejects the amount given by player 1, both players receive $0. Assuming player 2 is rational and will only accept an offer that gives them at least $4, what is the maximum amount that player 1 can give to player 2 without risking rejection?",
    "message_2": "Since player 2 is rational and will only accept an offer that gives them at least $4, the maximum amount that player 1 can give to player 2 without risking rejection is $4. This way, player 1 can keep $6 for themselves, and player 2 will accept the offer because it meets their minimum requirement of $4."
