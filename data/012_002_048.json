What is the minimum number of colors required to color the graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color? Find the chromatic number of G.",
    "message_2": "To find the chromatic number of the graph G, we need to determine the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. We can use the greedy coloring algorithm to find an upper bound for the chromatic number.\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color 1.\n2. Vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 1, so color vertex 2 with color 2.\n3. Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 2, so color vertex 3 with color 1.\n4. Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 3, so color vertex 4 with color 2.\n5. Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 2 and 3, so color vertex 5 with color 3.\n6. Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertices 4 and 7, so color vertex 6 with color 1.\n7. Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertices 1 and 6, so color vertex 7 with color 2.\n8. Vertex 8 is adjacent to vertex 1, so color vertex 8 with color 2.\n9. Vertex 9 is adjacent to vertices 6 and 8, so color vertex 9 with color 3.\n10. Vertex 10 is adjacent to vertices 5 and 7, so color vertex 10 with color 1.\n\nThe greedy coloring algorithm gives us a coloring with 3 colors. Now, let's check if it's possible to color the graph with only 2 colors. Suppose we color vertex 1 with color 1. Then, vertex 2 must be colored with color 2. Vertex 3 must be colored with color 1, vertex 4 with color 2, and vertex 5 with color 1. Now, vertex 5 is adjacent to both vertices 2 and 3, which are already colored with colors 2 and 1, respectively. Therefore, it's impossible to color the graph with only 2 colors.\n\nThus, the minimum number of colors required to color the graph G is 3, and the chromatic number of G is 3."
