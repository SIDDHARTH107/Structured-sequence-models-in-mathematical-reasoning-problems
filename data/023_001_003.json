    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given periodic function f(t), we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the following Fourier series representation:\n\nf(t) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nωt) + b_n * sin(nωt)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π/T, n is an integer, and the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor a periodic function with period T = 2π, ω = 2π/T = 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the constant term a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/T) * ∫[f(t) dt] from 0 to T\n\nSince T = 2π, we have:\n\na_0 = (1/2π) * ∫[5 + 3cos(2t) - 2sin(3t) dt] from 0 to 2π\n\na_0 = (1/2π) * [5t + (3/2)sin(2t) + (2/3)cos(3t)] from 0 to 2π\n\na_0 = (1/2π) * [(5*2π) + (3/2)(0) + (2/3)(0) - (5*0) - (3/2)(0) - (2/3)(0)]\n\na_0 = (1/2π) * (10π)\n\na_0 = 5\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients a_n and b_n:\n\na_n = (1/T) * ∫[f(t) * cos(nωt) dt] from 0 to T\n\nb_n = (1/T) * ∫[f(t) * sin(nωt) dt] from 0 to T\n\nSince f(t) = 5 + 3cos(2t) - 2sin(3t), we can see that the function is already in the form of a Fourier series. Thus, we can directly identify the coefficients:\n\na_0 = 5 (already found)\na_1 = 0 (no cos(t) term)\na_2 = 3 (coefficient of cos(2t))\na_3 = 0 (no cos(3t) term)\nb_1 = 0 (no sin(t) term)\nb_2 = 0 (no sin(2t) term)\nb_3 = -2 (coefficient of sin(3t))\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the periodic function f(t) for one period is:\n\nf(t) = 5 + 3cos(2t) - 2sin(3t)"
