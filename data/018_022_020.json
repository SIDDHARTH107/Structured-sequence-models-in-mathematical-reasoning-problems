    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, then find the symmetric difference between A and B using this Cartesian product. Show that the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) - ({2, 3}) = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of the symmetric difference with respect to A and B.\n\n(A Δ B) x A = {1, 4} x {1, 2, 3} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\n(A Δ B) x B = {1, 4} x {2, 3, 4} = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A Δ B) x A ≠ (A Δ B) x B. Therefore, the symmetric difference of A and B is not commutative with respect to the Cartesian product."
