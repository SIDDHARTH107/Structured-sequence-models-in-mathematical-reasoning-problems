    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob and sign it with her private key, which is a 5-digit prime number. She uses the RSA algorithm with a modulus of 3233 and a public exponent of 17. If she wants to sign the message \"HELLO\", what is the digital signature value she should calculate and send to Bob?",
    "message_2": "To sign the message \"HELLO\" using the RSA algorithm, Alice needs to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the message \"HELLO\" into a numerical representation. We can use the ASCII values of the characters: H=72, E=69, L=76, L=76, O=79. Concatenating these values, we get the numerical representation: 7269767679.\n\n2. Calculate the digital signature value (S) using the formula: S â‰¡ M^d mod n, where M is the numerical representation of the message, d is Alice's private key, and n is the modulus (3233 in this case).\n\nSince we don't know Alice's private key (d), we cannot calculate the exact digital signature value (S) she should send to Bob. However, we can outline the process she should follow to calculate it."
