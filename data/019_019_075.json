    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the number of trailing zeros in a decimal representation of a number is determined by the number of times it can be divided by 10. Since 10 = 2 * 5, we need to find the smallest k such that 2^k contains n factors of 5 in its decimal representation.\n\nLet's denote the smallest k as f(n). We can write the equation:\n\n2^k = 10^n * m\n\nwhere m is an integer not divisible by 10. Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get:\n\nk = n * log2(10) + log2(m)\n\nSince k is an integer, log2(m) must be an integer as well. We can find the smallest k by finding the smallest m such that log2(m) is an integer.\n\nNow, let's find the smallest k for a given n:\n\n1. Initialize k = n * log2(10), rounded up to the nearest integer.\n2. Check if 2^k has n consecutive zeros in its decimal representation.\n3. If it does, return k. If not, increment k and repeat step 2.\n\nLet's find the smallest k for n = 3 using this algorithm:\n\n1. k = ceil(3 * log2(10)) = ceil(9.966) = 10\n2. 2^10 = 1024, which has 3 consecutive zeros.\n3. Return k = 10.\n\nSo, for n = 3, the smallest k is 10."
