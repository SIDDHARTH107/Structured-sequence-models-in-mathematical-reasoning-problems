    "message_1": "A student needs to schedule a final exam timetable for 10 courses over 5 days. Each course can only be scheduled once and each day can only have a maximum of 4 exams. How many different possible timetables can the student create?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We need to distribute 10 courses over 5 days, with a maximum of 4 exams per day. Let's break this down into cases based on the number of exams per day.\n\nCase 1: 4 exams on Day 1, 2 exams on Day 2, and 1 exam on each of the remaining days (Days 3, 4, and 5).\nThe number of ways to choose 4 exams for Day 1 is C(10,4) = 210.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 exams for Day 2 from the remaining 6 is C(6,2) = 15.\nThe number of ways to arrange the remaining 4 exams over the last 3 days is 4!/(1!1!1!1!) = 24.\nSo, the total number of ways for Case 1 is 210 * 15 * 24 = 75,600.\n\nCase 2: 4 exams on Day 1, 3 exams on Day 2, 2 exams on Day 3, and 1 exam on each of the remaining days (Days 4 and 5).\nThe number of ways to choose 4 exams for Day 1 is C(10,4) = 210.\nThe number of ways to choose 3 exams for Day 2 from the remaining 6 is C(6,3) = 20.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 exams for Day 3 from the remaining 3 is C(3,2) = 3.\nThe number of ways to arrange the remaining exam over the last 2 days is 2!/(1!1!) = 2.\nSo, the total number of ways for Case 2 is 210 * 20 * 3 * 2 = 25,200.\n\nAdding the number of ways for both cases, we get 75,600 + 25,200 = 100,800.\n\nTherefore, the student can create 100,800 different possible timetables."
