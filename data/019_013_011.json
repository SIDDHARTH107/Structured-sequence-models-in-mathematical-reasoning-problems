    "message_2": "It is not possible to construct a subset of Q that contains only irrational numbers, as Q is the set of all rational numbers by definition. Irrational numbers are not part of the set Q. Instead, you can define a set I of all irrational numbers using second-order logic.\n\nLet I be the set of all irrational numbers. Using second-order logic, we can define I as follows:\n\n∀x (x ∈ I ↔ ¬(∃p, q ∈ ℤ (q ≠ 0 ∧ x = p/q)))\n\nThis statement says that for all x, x is an element of I if and only if there do not exist integers p and q such that q is not equal to 0 and x is equal to the fraction p/q. This definition captures the essence of irrational numbers, which cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers."
