    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation (1.5 times the first equation). Therefore, the second equation does not provide any new information, and we can ignore it.\n\nNow we are left with two equations:\n\n1) 2x + 4y - 6z = 0\n2) -x - 2y + 3z = 0\n\nWe can simplify the first equation by dividing by 2:\n\n1) x + 2y - 3z = 0\n\nNow, we can add the first equation to the second equation to eliminate x:\n\n(x + 2y - 3z) + (-x - 2y + 3z) = 0 + 0\n0 = 0\n\nSince we are left with 0 = 0, which is always true, this system has infinitely many solutions. To find the general solution, we can express one variable in terms of the others. Let's express x in terms of y and z:\n\nx = -2y + 3z\n\nNow we can write the general solution as:\n\n(x, y, z) = (-2y + 3z, y, z)\n\nwhere y and z can be any real numbers."
