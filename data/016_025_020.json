    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that is formed by repeatedly removing triangles from the previous iteration. In each iteration, the number of triangles removed is equal to the number of triangles in the previous iteration. \n\nLet's denote the number of triangles in the nth iteration as T(n). In the first iteration, T(1) = 1, since there is only one equilateral triangle.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the number of triangles removed is equal to the number of triangles in the previous iteration, and the number of triangles remaining is multiplied by 3. Therefore, we can express the number of triangles in the nth iteration as:\n\nT(n) = 3 * T(n-1) - T(n-2)\n\nNow, let's find the number of triangles in the 6th iteration using this formula:\n\nT(2) = 3 * T(1) - T(0) = 3 * 1 - 0 = 3\nT(3) = 3 * T(2) - T(1) = 3 * 3 - 1 = 8\nT(4) = 3 * T(3) - T(2) = 3 * 8 - 3 = 21\nT(5) = 3 * T(4) - T(3) = 3 * 21 - 8 = 55\nT(6) = 3 * T(5) - T(4) = 3 * 55 - 21 = 144\n\nSo, the total number of triangles in the 6th iteration of the Sierpinski sieve is 144."
