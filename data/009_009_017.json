    "message_1": "Consider a particle in a one-dimensional box of length L. The particle has mass m and is bound by the potential energy V(x) = 0 for 0 < x < L and infinity otherwise. Using the Schrödinger equation, find the allowed energy levels En and corresponding wavefunctions ψn for the particle. Let L = 1 nm, m = 9.11 × 10^31 kg (mass of an electron), and h-bar = 1.05 × 10^-34 J·s (reduced Planck's constant). What are the lowest two energy levels and their corresponding wavefunctions?",
    "message_2": "To find the allowed energy levels and corresponding wavefunctions for the particle, we need to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n\n(-ħ² / 2m) * (d²ψ/dx²) + V(x) * ψ = E * ψ\n\nSince V(x) = 0 for 0 < x < L, the equation simplifies to:\n\n(-ħ² / 2m) * (d²ψ/dx²) = E * ψ\n\nNow, let's solve the differential equation:\n\n(d²ψ/dx²) = (-2mE / ħ²) * ψ\n\nLet k² = (2mE / ħ²), then the equation becomes:\n\n(d²ψ/dx²) = -k² * ψ\n\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(L) = 0:\n\nψ(0) = A * sin(0) + B * cos(0) = B = 0 (since the wavefunction must be finite)\n\nSo, ψ(x) = A * sin(kx)\n\nNow, apply the other boundary condition:\n\nψ(L) = A * sin(kL) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the wavefunction would be trivial), we require sin(kL) = 0. This means that kL = nπ, where n is an integer. Therefore, k = nπ/L.\n\nNow we can find the energy levels:\n\nE_n = (ħ² * k²) / 2m = (ħ² * (nπ/L)²) / 2m\n\nPlugging in the given values for L, m, and ħ:\n\nE_n = (1.05 × 10^-34 J·s)² * (nπ/1 nm)² / (2 * 9.11 × 10^-31 kg) = (n²π²ħ²) / (2mL²)\n\nNow, let's find the lowest two energy levels (n = 1 and n = 2):\n\nE_1 = (1²π²(1.05 × 10^-34)²) / (2 * 9.11 × 10^-31 * (1 × 10^-9)²) = 6.024 × 10^-19 J\n\nE_2 = (2²π²(1.05 × 10^-34)²) / (2 * 9.11 × 10^-31 * (1 × 10^-9)²) = 2.410 × 10^-18 J\n\nNow let's find the corresponding wavefunctions. We need to normalize the wavefunction:\n\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n∫ (A * sin(kx))² dx = 1\n\nA² * ∫ sin²(kx) dx = 1\n\nA² * (L/2) = 1\n\nA = √(2/L) = √(2 nm^-1)\n\nSo, the wavefunctions are:\n\nψ_1(x) = √(2 nm^-1) * sin(1πx/L) = √(2 nm^-1) * sin(πx)\n\nψ_2(x) = √(2 nm^-1) * sin(2πx/L) = √(2 nm^-1) * sin(2πx)\n\nIn conclusion, the lowest two energy levels are:\n\nE_1 = 6.024 × 10^-19 J, ψ_1(x) = √(2 nm^-1) * sin(πx)\n\nE_2 = 2.410 × 10^-18 J, ψ_2(x) = √(2 nm^-1) * sin(2πx)"
