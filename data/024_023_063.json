    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves distances between points. On a sphere, there are three types of isometries: rotations, reflections, and the identity transformation. We will consider each type and determine which ones fix a point on the equator.\n\n1. Identity transformation: This transformation leaves every point unchanged, so it fixes every point on the equator.\n\n2. Rotations: A rotation around an axis that passes through the center of the sphere and is perpendicular to the equator will fix a point on the equator. In this case, the axis of rotation is the polar axis (the line connecting the North and South poles). Any rotation around this axis will fix all points on the equator. The angle of rotation can be any value between 0 and 360 degrees.\n\n3. Reflections: A reflection across a plane that contains the center of the sphere and the fixed point on the equator will also fix that point. There are infinitely many such planes, each determined by the fixed point and the center of the sphere. For example, if the fixed point is at longitude 0 degrees, the plane of reflection can be the one that contains the prime meridian (the line of longitude 0 degrees) and the center of the sphere.\n\nIn summary, there are infinitely many isometries that fix a point on the equator of a sphere with radius 3:\n\n- The identity transformation\n- Rotations around the polar axis with any angle between 0 and 360 degrees\n- Reflections across any plane containing the center of the sphere and the fixed point on the equator"
