    "message_1": "Suppose we want to find a number that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 7 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 11. What is the smallest possible positive integer that satisfies these conditions?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let x be the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions. We have the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 5 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 6 (mod 11)\n\nFirst, we find the modular inverses. Let's denote the modular inverse of 7 modulo 11 as a, and the modular inverse of 11 modulo 7 as b. We need to find a and b such that:\n\n7a ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n11b ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nWe can find a and b by trying out different values:\n\nFor a:\n7 * 1 ≡ 7 (mod 11)\n7 * 2 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n7 * 3 ≡ 10 (mod 11)\n7 * 4 ≡ 6 (mod 11)\n7 * 5 ≡ 2 (mod 11)\n7 * 6 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n7 * 7 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n7 * 8 ≡ 1 (mod 11)  -> a = 8\n\nFor b:\n11 * 1 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n11 * 2 ≡ 1 (mod 7)  -> b = 2\n\nNow, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem formula:\n\nx = (5 * 11 * b + 6 * 7 * a) % (7 * 11)\n\nx = (5 * 11 * 2 + 6 * 7 * 8) % 77\nx = (110 + 336) % 77\nx = 446 % 77\nx = 40\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is 40."
