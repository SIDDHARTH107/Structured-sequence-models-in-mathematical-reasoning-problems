    "message_1": "Auction Theory Question: \n\nA sealed-bid auction is held for a rare painting. Three bidders are involved, with valuations of 2000, 3000, and 4000 dollars respectively. The highest bidder will get the painting and pay their bid amount. If there is a tie between the highest bidders, a coin-flip will be used to determine the winner. What is the expected payoff for each bidder if they use a strategy of bidding their true valuation?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected payoff for each bidder, we need to consider the probability of winning the auction and the amount they would pay if they win.\n\nBidder 1 (valuation of 2000):\nBidder 1 can only win if both Bidder 2 and Bidder 3 bid less than 2000. However, since they are bidding their true valuation, Bidder 1 will never win the auction.\n\nExpected payoff for Bidder 1 = 0\n\nBidder 2 (valuation of 3000):\nBidder 2 can win if Bidder 3 bids less than 3000. Since Bidder 3 is bidding their true valuation, this will never happen. However, Bidder 2 can win if there is a tie between Bidder 2 and Bidder 3, which will occur with a probability of 0.5 (coin flip).\n\nExpected payoff for Bidder 2 = 0.5 * (3000 - 3000) = 0\n\nBidder 3 (valuation of 4000):\nBidder 3 will always win the auction since their valuation is the highest. They will pay their bid amount, which is 4000.\n\nExpected payoff for Bidder 3 = (4000 - 4000) = 0\n\nIn this scenario, when all bidders use a strategy of bidding their true valuation, the expected payoff for each bidder is 0."
