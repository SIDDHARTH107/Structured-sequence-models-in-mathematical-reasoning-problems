    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one case of financial fraud occurring in a year, we can use the complementary probability rule. This rule states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nLet A be the event that at least one case of financial fraud occurs in a year. Then, the complementary event, A', is that no cases of financial fraud occur in a year. Since the probability of a single case of fraud occurring is 0.15, the probability of a single case of fraud not occurring is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.\n\nSince the occurrence of fraud cases within a company are independent events, the probability of no cases of financial fraud occurring in a year is simply the product of the probabilities of no fraud occurring for each case. In this case, there is only one case, so the probability of no cases of financial fraud occurring in a year is 0.85.\n\nNow, we can use the complementary probability rule to find the probability of at least one case of financial fraud occurring in a year:\n\nP(A) = 1 - P(A')\nP(A) = 1 - 0.85\nP(A) = 0.15\n\nSo, the probability that a company experiences at least one case of financial fraud in a year is 0.15, or 15%."
