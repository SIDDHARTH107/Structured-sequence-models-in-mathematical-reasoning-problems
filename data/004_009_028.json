    "message_2": "To find the derivative of h(x) = f(x) * g(x), we will use the product rule. The product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nh'(x) = f'(x) * g(x) + f(x) * g'(x)\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x).\n\nf(x) = x^2 * cos(x)\nf'(x) = d(x^2 * cos(x))/dx\n\nTo find the derivative of f(x), we will use the product rule again:\n\nf'(x) = (d(x^2)/dx) * cos(x) + x^2 * (d(cos(x))/dx)\n\nNow, we find the derivatives of x^2 and cos(x):\n\nd(x^2)/dx = 2x\nd(cos(x))/dx = -sin(x)\n\nNow, plug these derivatives back into the expression for f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = (2x) * cos(x) + x^2 * (-sin(x))\nf'(x) = 2x * cos(x) - x^2 * sin(x)\n\nNext, we find the derivative of g(x):\n\ng(x) = e^x\ng'(x) = d(e^x)/dx = e^x\n\nNow, we have the derivatives of f(x) and g(x), so we can find the derivative of h(x):\n\nh'(x) = f'(x) * g(x) + f(x) * g'(x)\nh'(x) = (2x * cos(x) - x^2 * sin(x)) * e^x + (x^2 * cos(x)) * e^x\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of h(x) at x = 1:\n\nh'(1) = (2 * 1 * cos(1) - 1^2 * sin(1)) * e^1 + (1^2 * cos(1)) * e^1\nh'(1) = (2 * cos(1) - sin(1)) * e + cos(1) * e\n\nThis is the derivative of h(x) = f(x) * g(x) at x = 1."
