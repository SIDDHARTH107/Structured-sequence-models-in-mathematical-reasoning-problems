    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 1m experiences a sudden change in temperature from 20°C to 80°C at one end, while the other end is maintained at 20°C. The rod has a cross-sectional area of 0.01m² and a thermal conductivity of 400 W/mK. Using Fourier transform, find the temperature distribution along the rod at any time after the sudden temperature change.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution along the rod at any time after the sudden temperature change, we can use the 1D heat conduction equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material, which can be calculated as:\n\nα = k/(ρc)\n\nHere, k is the thermal conductivity (400 W/mK), ρ is the density of the material, and c is the specific heat capacity. Since we are not given the values of ρ and c, we cannot calculate α. However, we can still proceed with the general solution using Fourier transform.\n\nFirst, we apply the Fourier transform to the heat conduction equation:\n\n∂T(k,t)/∂t = -αk²T(k,t)\n\nNow, we can solve this first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for T(k,t):\n\nT(k,t) = T(k,0) * exp(-αk²t)\n\nHere, T(k,0) is the Fourier transform of the initial temperature distribution. Since the rod experiences a sudden change in temperature from 20°C to 80°C at one end, the initial temperature distribution can be represented as:\n\nT(x,0) = 20 + 60 * δ(x)\n\nwhere δ(x) is the Dirac delta function. Now, we can find the Fourier transform of T(x,0):\n\nT(k,0) = ∫[20 + 60 * δ(x)] * exp(-ikx) dx = 20 + 60 * exp(-ik*0) = 20 + 60\n\nNow, we have:\n\nT(k,t) = (20 + 60) * exp(-αk²t)\n\nTo find the temperature distribution T(x,t), we need to apply the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nT(x,t) = (1/2π) * ∫(80 * exp(-αk²t) * exp(ikx)) dk\n\nThis integral does not have a closed-form solution, but it can be solved numerically for specific values of α and t.\n\nIn summary, the temperature distribution along the rod at any time after the sudden temperature change can be found using the 1D heat conduction equation and Fourier transform. However, without the values of density and specific heat capacity, we cannot calculate the thermal diffusivity and provide a numerical solution for the temperature distribution T(x,t)."
