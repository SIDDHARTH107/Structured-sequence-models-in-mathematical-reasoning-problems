    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(5x-3) - log(x+2) = log 7, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b) to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation:\n\nlog((5x-3)/(x+2)) = log 7\n\nNow, since the logarithms are equal, we can set the arguments (the expressions inside the logarithms) equal to each other:\n\n(5x-3)/(x+2) = 7\n\nNext, we can solve for x by clearing the fraction. To do this, multiply both sides of the equation by (x+2):\n\n(5x-3) = 7(x+2)\n\nNow, distribute the 7 on the right side of the equation:\n\n5x - 3 = 7x + 14\n\nNext, move all the terms with x to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side:\n\n-3 - 14 = 7x - 5x\n\n-17 = 2x\n\nNow, divide by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx = -17/2\n\nSo, the solution is x = -17/2."
