    "message_1": "Let X be a closed, oriented, non-singular surface of genus g with a fixed orientation, and let A and B be two non-intersecting simple closed curves on X. Suppose that A and B each represent a non-trivial element in H_1(X;Z). Compute the intersection number of A and B, i.e., the integer (A ∩ B) obtained by counting the number of points in the intersection A ∩ B, taking signs into account.",
    "message_2": "Since A and B are non-intersecting simple closed curves on X, their intersection number (A ∩ B) is 0. This is because there are no points in the intersection A ∩ B, as they do not intersect. The intersection number counts the number of points in the intersection, taking signs into account, but in this case, there are no points to count. Therefore, the intersection number of A and B is 0."
