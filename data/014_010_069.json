    "message_1": "Suppose you have a message \"HELLO\" that needs to be encrypted using a substitution cipher. The substitution rule is to shift each letter by 3 positions in the alphabet, so A becomes D, B becomes E and so on. What is the encrypted message for \"HELLO\"?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the given substitution cipher, we shift each letter by 3 positions in the alphabet:\n\nH -> K (shifted 3 positions: I, J, K)\nE -> H (shifted 3 positions: F, G, H)\nL -> O (shifted 3 positions: M, N, O)\nL -> O (shifted 3 positions: M, N, O)\nO -> R (shifted 3 positions: P, Q, R)\n\nSo, the encrypted message for \"HELLO\" is \"KHOOR\"."
