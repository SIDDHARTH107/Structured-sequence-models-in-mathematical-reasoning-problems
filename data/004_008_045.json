    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at a given point, we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given x-value.\n\nThe given function is y = x^2 - 4x + 3.\n\nTo find the derivative, we'll use the power rule, which states that if y = x^n, then the derivative dy/dx = n*x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\nThe derivative of x^2 is 2x^(2-1) = 2x.\nThe derivative of -4x is -4x^(1-1) = -4.\nThe derivative of the constant term 3 is 0, as constants have no effect on the slope.\n\nSo, the derivative of the function is:\n\ndy/dx = 2x - 4\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the derivative at x = 2:\n\ndy/dx(2) = 2(2) - 4\ndy/dx(2) = 4 - 4\ndy/dx(2) = 0\n\nThe slope of the tangent line to the curve y = x^2 - 4x + 3 at x = 2 is 0."
