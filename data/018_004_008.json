    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Since the problem does not provide a specific universal set, let's assume that U is the set of all positive integers from 1 to 12. \n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}\n\nNow, the complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nA' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}\n\nBy comparing the elements in set A and set U, we can find the elements that are not in set A:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12}\n\nNow, to show that the complement is unique, we need to prove that there is no other set that can be the complement of set A. \n\nSuppose there is another set B that is also the complement of set A. This means that B must contain all the elements in U that are not in A. Since A' already contains all the elements in U that are not in A, set B must be equal to A'. Therefore, there can be no other set that is the complement of set A, and the complement is unique."
