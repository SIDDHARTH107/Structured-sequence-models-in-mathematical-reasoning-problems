    "message_1": "A non-monotonic logic problem for a math student:\n\nSuppose a basket contains 10 apples, 5 of which are red and 5 are green. If we remove 3 apples at random and observe that they are all green, what is the probability that the next apple we select from the basket will also be green?",
    "message_2": "After removing 3 green apples from the basket, there are now 7 apples left in the basket: 5 red apples and 2 green apples. The probability of selecting a green apple next is the ratio of the number of green apples to the total number of apples remaining in the basket.\n\nProbability of selecting a green apple = (Number of green apples) / (Total number of apples)\n\nProbability = 2 green apples / 7 total apples\n\nProbability = 2/7 â‰ˆ 0.286\n\nSo, the probability that the next apple selected from the basket will be green is approximately 0.286 or 28.6%."
