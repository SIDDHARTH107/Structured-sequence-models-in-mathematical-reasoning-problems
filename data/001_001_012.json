    "message_2": "To find the value of x, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Add 7 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x on one side:\n3x - 7 + 7 = 8 + 7\n3x = 15\n\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:\n3x / 3 = 15 / 3\nx = 5\n\nSo, the value of x in the equation 3x - 7 = 8 is x = 5."
