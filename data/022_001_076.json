    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{1+z}$ from the region $Re(z) > -1$ to the region $Re(z) < -1$, we can rewrite the function in a different form that converges in the desired region.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the function using a geometric series:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{1}{1+z} = \\frac{1}{1-(-z)} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-z)^n$\n\nThis representation converges for $|(-z)| < 1$, which is equivalent to $|z| < 1$. However, we want to find the analytic continuation for $Re(z) < -1$. To do this, let's make a substitution:\n\nLet $w = -z$, so $z = -w$. Then, we have:\n\n$f(-w) = \\frac{1}{1 - w} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} w^n$\n\nNow, this representation converges for $|w| < 1$, which is equivalent to $|-z| < 1$. Since we are looking for the analytic continuation in the region $Re(z) < -1$, we have $Re(-z) > 1$, which means that $Re(w) > 1$. Thus, the series converges in the desired region.\n\nFinally, we substitute back $z = -w$ to obtain the analytic continuation of the function:\n\n$f(z) = f(-(-z)) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-z)^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n z^n$\n\nThis representation of the function converges in the region $Re(z) < -1$, and it is the analytic continuation of the original function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{1+z}$ in that region."
