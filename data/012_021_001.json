    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph, we can first try to find a tree decomposition of the graph and then determine the width of that decomposition.\n\nThe given graph can be decomposed into the following tree:\n\n```\n       1\n      / \\\n     2   3\n          \\\n           4\n            \\\n             5\n            / \\\n           6   7\n                \\\n                 8\n```\n\nNow, we can create a tree decomposition using the following bags:\n\nBag 1: {1, 2, 3}\nBag 2: {1, 3, 4}\nBag 3: {3, 4, 5}\nBag 4: {4, 5}\nBag 5: {5, 6, 7}\nBag 6: {5, 7, 8}\nBag 7: {6, 7}\nBag 8: {7, 8}\n\nThe tree decomposition looks like this:\n\n```\n  1---2---3---4---5---6\n       |       |\n       7-------8\n```\n\nThe width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus 1. In this case, the largest bag has 3 vertices, so the treewidth of the given graph is 3 - 1 = 2."
