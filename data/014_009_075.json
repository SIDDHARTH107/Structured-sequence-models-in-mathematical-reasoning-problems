    "message_1": "In a Feistel cipher with 6 rounds, the plaintext is divided into two 4-bit halves (L and R) and the key used for each round is 5 bits. If the initial plaintext is 1100 0110 and the key for each round is generated from a 10-bit key using a key scheduler, what is the resulting ciphertext after all 6 rounds of encryption?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the Feistel cipher structure and its encryption process. In a Feistel cipher, the plaintext is divided into two halves (L and R), and each round consists of a substitution step (applying a round function F to one half) and a permutation step (swapping the two halves). The round function F takes the current half and the round key as input and produces a 4-bit output.\n\nGiven the initial plaintext 1100 0110, we have:\n\nL0 = 1100\nR0 = 0110\n\nWe don't have the 10-bit key or the key scheduler, so we cannot compute the exact ciphertext. However, we can describe the process for each round.\n\nFor each round i (1 to 6), the following operations are performed:\n\n1. Compute the round key Ki using the key scheduler and the 10-bit key.\n2. Apply the round function F to Ri-1 and Ki, resulting in a 4-bit output Fi.\n3. Calculate Li = Ri-1 XOR Fi.\n4. Swap the two halves: Ri = Li-1.\n\nAfter 6 rounds, the final ciphertext is formed by concatenating L6 and R6.\n\nSince we don't have the 10-bit key or the key scheduler, we cannot compute the exact ciphertext. However, we have described the process for each round, and this process would be applied to the given plaintext and key to obtain the ciphertext in a Feistel cipher with 6 rounds."
