    "message_2": "To solve the equation |2x + 3| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x + 3 is positive or zero\nIn this case, we can simply remove the absolute value sign and solve the equation:\n\n2x + 3 = 7\n\nNow, subtract 3 from both sides:\n\n2x = 4\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 2\n\nCase 2: 2x + 3 is negative\nIn this case, we need to change the sign of the expression inside the absolute value sign:\n\n-(2x + 3) = 7\n\nNow, distribute the negative sign:\n\n-2x - 3 = 7\n\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n\n-2x = 10\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\nx = -5\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 2 and -5."
