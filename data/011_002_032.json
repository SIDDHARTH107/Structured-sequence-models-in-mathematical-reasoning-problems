    "message_2": "To find the number of different committees that can be created, we will use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (10 in this case), k is the number of people in the committee (5 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n\nNow, let's plug these values back into the combination formula:\n\nC(10, 5) = 3,628,800 / (120 × 120)\n\nC(10, 5) = 3,628,800 / 14,400\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo, there are 252 different committees that can be created from a group of 10 people."
