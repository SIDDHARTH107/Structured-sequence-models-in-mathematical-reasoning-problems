    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the number of segments in the Koch curve increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the number of segments is 4, and the length of each segment is 2/3 meters.\nAfter the second iteration, the number of segments is 4^2 = 16, and the length of each segment is (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9 meters.\nAfter the third iteration, the number of segments is 4^3 = 64, and the length of each segment is (2/9)*(1/3) = 2/27 meters.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total perimeter of the Koch island after the third iteration by multiplying the number of segments by the length of each segment:\n\nPerimeter = (Number of segments) * (Length of each segment)\nPerimeter = 64 * (2/27)\nPerimeter = 128/27 meters â‰ˆ 4.74 meters"
