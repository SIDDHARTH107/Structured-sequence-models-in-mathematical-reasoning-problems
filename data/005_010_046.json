    "message_1": "A factory that produces light bulbs receives a shipment of bulbs from a supplier. The supplier indicates that each bulb has a 2% chance of being defective. A quality control inspector randomly selects 100 bulbs from the shipment and tests them. The inspector finds that 4 of the bulbs are defective. \n\nWhat is the probability that the entire shipment contains at least 10% defective bulbs, assuming a Bayesian perspective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Bayesian theorem, which states:\n\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability that the entire shipment contains at least 10% defective bulbs (event A) given that the inspector found 4 defective bulbs in a sample of 100 (event B).\n\nFirst, we need to define our prior probability, P(A). Since we don't have any information about the probability of having at least 10% defective bulbs, we can assume a uniform prior distribution. This means that the probability of having at least 10% defective bulbs is the same as the probability of having less than 10% defective bulbs. Therefore, P(A) = 0.5.\n\nNext, we need to find the likelihood, P(B|A). This is the probability of finding 4 defective bulbs in a sample of 100, given that the entire shipment contains at least 10% defective bulbs. We can use the binomial probability formula for this:\n\nP(B|A) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, n is the sample size (100), k is the number of defective bulbs (4), and p is the probability of a bulb being defective (at least 10%).\n\nSince we are considering at least 10% defective bulbs, we will calculate the likelihood for 10% and then integrate over the range of possible probabilities (from 10% to 100%). However, this integration is quite complex and requires advanced mathematical techniques. Instead, we can approximate the likelihood by considering the probability at 10% defective bulbs:\n\nP(B|A) ≈ C(100, 4) * (0.1)^4 * (0.9)^96\n\nP(B|A) ≈ 3921225 * 0.0001 * 0.301194\n\nP(B|A) ≈ 0.0118\n\nNow, we need to find the marginal probability, P(B). This is the probability of finding 4 defective bulbs in a sample of 100, regardless of the percentage of defective bulbs in the entire shipment. Since we don't have enough information to calculate this directly, we can use the law of total probability:\n\nP(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)\n\nwhere P(B|¬A) is the probability of finding 4 defective bulbs in a sample of 100, given that the entire shipment contains less than 10% defective bulbs, and P(¬A) is the probability of having less than 10% defective bulbs (which is also 0.5).\n\nWe already know P(B|A) and P(A), so we need to find P(B|¬A). We can use the binomial probability formula again, but this time with a probability of 2% defective bulbs (as indicated by the supplier):\n\nP(B|¬A) = C(100, 4) * (0.02)^4 * (0.98)^96\n\nP(B|¬A) ≈ 3921225 * 0.00000016 * 0.669260\n\nP(B|¬A) ≈ 0.0416\n\nNow we can calculate P(B):\n\nP(B) = 0.0118 * 0.5 + 0.0416 * 0.5\n\nP(B) ≈ 0.0267\n\nFinally, we can use the Bayesian theorem to find the probability that the entire shipment contains at least 10% defective bulbs, given that the inspector found 4 defective bulbs in a sample of 100:\n\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n\nP(A|B) = (0.0118 * 0.5) / 0.0267\n\nP(A|B) ≈ 0.2213\n\nSo, the probability that the entire shipment contains at least 10% defective bulbs, assuming a Bayesian perspective, is approximately 22.13%."
