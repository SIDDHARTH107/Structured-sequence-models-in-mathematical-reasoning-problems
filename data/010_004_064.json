    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the contrapositive. We will show that if the entire collection {U.sub.a} has an empty intersection, then there exists a finite subcollection {U.sub1, ..., U.subn} of {U.sub.a} with an empty intersection. This is equivalent to proving the original statement.\n\nAssume that the intersection of the entire collection {U.sub.a} is empty, i.e.,\n\n∩(U.sub.a) = ∅.\n\nNow, consider the closed sets C.sub.a = X \\ U.sub.a, which are the complements of the open sets U.sub.a in X. Since the intersection of the U.sub.a's is empty, the union of the C.sub.a's must be the entire space X:\n\n∪(C.sub.a) = X.\n\nSince X is compact, there must exist a finite subcollection {C.sub1, ..., C.subn} of {C.sub.a} whose union is still X:\n\n∪(C.sub1, ..., C.subn) = X.\n\nNow, consider the corresponding open sets {U.sub1, ..., U.subn} for these closed sets. Since the union of the closed sets is X, the intersection of the open sets must be empty:\n\n∩(U.sub1, ..., U.subn) = ∅.\n\nThus, we have shown that if the entire collection {U.sub.a} has an empty intersection, then there exists a finite subcollection {U.sub1, ..., U.subn} of {U.sub.a} with an empty intersection. This proves the contrapositive, and therefore the original statement is true:\n\nIf X is compact and every finite subcollection of an open cover has a non-empty intersection, then the entire open cover also has a non-empty intersection."
