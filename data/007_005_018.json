    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6, 9, and 15, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n- 6 = 2 × 3\n- 9 = 3 × 3\n- 15 = 3 × 5\n\n2. Identify the highest power of each prime factor in the given numbers:\n- The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6)\n- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9)\n- The highest power of 5 is 5^1 (from 15)\n\n3. Multiply the highest powers of each prime factor together:\nLCM = 2^1 × 3^2 × 5^1 = 2 × 9 × 5 = 18 × 5 = 90\n\nSo, the least common multiple (LCM) of 6, 9, and 15 is 90."
