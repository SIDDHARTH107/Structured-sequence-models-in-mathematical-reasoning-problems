    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to solve optimization problems, but it is not easy to implement in a text-based environment like this. However, I can help you find the minimum value of the function using calculus.\n\nThe given function is f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1.\n\nTo find the minimum value of the function, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of the function and setting it to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 2\n\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n\n2x + 2 = 0\nx = -1\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum or maximum. We can do this by taking the second derivative of the function and checking its sign at the critical point.\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, the critical point x = -1 is a minimum.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging the critical point back into the original function:\n\nf(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 1 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 is 0, which occurs at x = -1."
