Suppose each critical point is non-degenerate. Find the Betti numbers of the sublevel sets $M_t=\\{x \\in S^1 : f(x) \\leq t\\}$ for $t=0,1,2,3,4$.",
    "message_2": "Let's first recall the definition of Betti numbers. The $k$-th Betti number $b_k$ of a topological space $X$ is the rank of its $k$-th homology group $H_k(X)$. In simpler terms, $b_0$ counts the number of connected components, $b_1$ counts the number of \"holes\" or \"loops\", and higher Betti numbers count higher-dimensional holes.\n\nNow, let's analyze the sublevel sets $M_t$ for different values of $t$.\n\n1. $t = 0$: Since the minimum value of $f$ is $1$, there are no points in $S^1$ such that $f(x) \\leq 0$. Therefore, $M_0$ is an empty set, and its Betti numbers are $b_0 = 0$ and $b_1 = 0$.\n\n2. $t = 1$: At this level, $M_1$ consists of a single point $p_1$. It is a connected set with no holes, so its Betti numbers are $b_0 = 1$ and $b_1 = 0$.\n\n3. $t = 2$: The sublevel set $M_2$ includes the points $p_1$ and $p_2$. Since $f$ is smooth and has non-degenerate critical points, there must be a smooth arc connecting $p_1$ and $p_2$ in $M_2$. This set is still connected and has no holes, so its Betti numbers are $b_0 = 1$ and $b_1 = 0$.\n\n4. $t = 3$: Now, $M_3$ includes all three critical points $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$. Since $f$ is smooth and has non-degenerate critical points, there must be smooth arcs connecting $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ in $M_3$. This forms a loop, so the Betti numbers are $b_0 = 1$ (one connected component) and $b_1 = 1$ (one loop).\n\n5. $t = 4$: At this level, $M_4$ includes the entire circle $S^1$, as all points have function values less than or equal to 4. The Betti numbers for a circle are $b_0 = 1$ (one connected component) and $b_1 = 1$ (one loop).\n\nIn summary, the Betti numbers for the sublevel sets $M_t$ are:\n\n- $t = 0$: $b_0 = 0$, $b_1 = 0$\n- $t = 1$: $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 0$\n- $t = 2$: $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 0$\n- $t = 3$: $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 1$\n- $t = 4$: $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 1$"
