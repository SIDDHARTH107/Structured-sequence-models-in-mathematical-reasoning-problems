    "message_2": "To decode the ciphertext \"YXQXPPKZNLLB\" using cryptanalysis of Hill Cipher, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the ciphertext into numerical form using the alphabetical index (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).\n2. Find the inverse of the key matrix modulo 26.\n3. Multiply the ciphertext matrix with the inverse key matrix modulo 26.\n4. Convert the resulting matrix back into letters to obtain the plaintext.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. Convert the ciphertext into numerical form:\n   YXQXPPKZNLLB -> 24 23 16 23 15 15 10 25 13 11 11 1\n\n2. Find the inverse of the key matrix modulo 26:\n   Key matrix: [5 8; 7 6]\n   Determinant: (5 * 6) - (8 * 7) = -26\n   Since the determinant is -26, which is equivalent to 0 modulo 26, the matrix does not have an inverse modulo 26. \n\nThis means that the given key matrix is not valid for a Hill Cipher, and we cannot decode the ciphertext using this key matrix. Please check the key matrix and try again."
