    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle in the triangle, we will first find the largest angle, which is opposite the longest side (9). Then, we will use the Law of Sines to find the other two angles and determine which one is the smallest.\n\nLet's denote the angles as A, B, and C, and the sides opposite to them as a, b, and c, respectively. In this case, let's assume angle A is opposite side a = 5, angle B is opposite side b = 7, and angle C is opposite side c = 9.\n\nWe will use the Law of Cosines to find the largest angle (C) first:\n\ncos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab)\ncos(C) = (5^2 + 7^2 - 9^2) / (2 * 5 * 7)\ncos(C) = (25 + 49 - 81) / 70\ncos(C) = (-7) / 70\n\nNow, find the angle C:\nC = arccos(-7/70) ≈ 95.71°\n\nNow, we will use the Law of Sines to find angle A:\n\nsin(A) / a = sin(C) / c\nsin(A) / 5 = sin(95.71°) / 9\n\nSolve for sin(A):\nsin(A) = (5 * sin(95.71°)) / 9\nsin(A) ≈ 0.529\n\nNow, find the angle A:\nA = arcsin(0.529) ≈ 32.01°\n\nFinally, we can find angle B by subtracting the other two angles from 180° (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°):\n\nB = 180° - A - C\nB = 180° - 32.01° - 95.71°\nB ≈ 52.28°\n\nNow that we have all three angles, we can determine the smallest angle:\n\nA ≈ 32.01°\nB ≈ 52.28°\nC ≈ 95.71°\n\nThe smallest angle is A, which is approximately 32.01°."
