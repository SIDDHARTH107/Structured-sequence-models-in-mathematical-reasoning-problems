    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales. To find the minimum value of the given function using WOA, we need to implement the algorithm and run it for a certain number of iterations. It's important to note that the WOA is a heuristic algorithm, and the results may vary slightly between runs.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the WOA:\n\n1. Initialize a population of whales (solutions) randomly within the search space.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each whale in the population.\n3. Update the position of each whale based on the best solution found so far, using the mathematical models inspired by the humpback whale's hunting behavior.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a certain number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n5. The best solution found during the iterations represents the minimum value of the function.\n\nUnfortunately, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute code or run algorithms directly. However, you can implement the WOA in a programming language like Python and use it to find the minimum value of the given function. There are also libraries available, such as \"PyWhale\" in Python, which implement the WOA and can be used to solve optimization problems."
