    "message_1": "A company wants to design a rectangular metal banner with an area of 500 square inches. The top and bottom edges will cost $2 per inch to cut, while the side edges will only cost $1 per inch to cut. If the company wants to minimize the cost of cutting the edges, what dimensions should the metal banner have?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the top and bottom edges be x inches and the length of the side edges be y inches. The area of the rectangular metal banner is given by A = xy, and we know that A = 500 square inches. So, we have:\n\nxy = 500 (1)\n\nThe cost of cutting the edges is given by the cost of cutting the top and bottom edges plus the cost of cutting the side edges. Since the top and bottom edges cost $2 per inch to cut and the side edges cost $1 per inch to cut, the total cost C can be expressed as:\n\nC = 2x + 2(2y) = 2x + 4y (2)\n\nWe want to minimize the cost C, subject to the constraint given by equation (1). To do this, we can first solve equation (1) for x or y and then substitute it into equation (2) to get a single-variable equation. Let's solve equation (1) for x:\n\nx = 500/y (3)\n\nNow substitute equation (3) into equation (2):\n\nC = 2(500/y) + 4y\nC = 1000/y + 4y\n\nTo minimize the cost C, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of C with respect to y and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndC/dy = -1000/y^2 + 4\n\nNow set dC/dy = 0 and solve for y:\n\n0 = -1000/y^2 + 4\n1000/y^2 = 4\ny^2 = 1000/4\ny^2 = 250\ny = √250\ny ≈ 15.81 inches\n\nNow we can find the value of x using equation (3):\n\nx = 500/y\nx = 500/15.81\nx ≈ 31.62 inches\n\nSo, to minimize the cost of cutting the edges, the company should design the metal banner with dimensions approximately 31.62 inches by 15.81 inches."
