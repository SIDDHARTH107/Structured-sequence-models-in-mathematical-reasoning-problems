    "message_2": "Since X is a smooth projective variety over the complex numbers, we can use the Hodge decomposition theorem. The Hodge decomposition theorem states that the cohomology group H^k(X, C) can be decomposed into a direct sum of Hodge components:\n\nH^k(X, C) = ⊕_{p+q=k} H^{p,q}(X)\n\nwhere H^{p,q}(X) is the set of harmonic (p, q)-forms on X. The Betti numbers are the dimensions of the cohomology groups, and the Hodge numbers h^{p,q} are the dimensions of the Hodge components:\n\nb_k(X) = dim H^k(X, C) and h^{p,q}(X) = dim H^{p,q}(X)\n\nBy the Hodge symmetry, we have h^{p,q}(X) = h^{q,p}(X). In particular, we are interested in the third Betti number b_3(X), which can be written as:\n\nb_3(X) = h^{3,0}(X) + h^{2,1}(X) + h^{1,2}(X) + h^{0,3}(X)\n\nSince the cohomology ring of X is generated by H^2(X) and H^4(X) as an algebra, it follows that the only non-zero Hodge components in H^3(X, C) are h^{1,2}(X) and h^{2,1}(X). Therefore, we have:\n\nb_3(X) = h^{1,2}(X) + h^{2,1}(X)\n\nNow, consider the cup product map:\n\nH^1(X) x H^2(X) → H^3(X)\n\nSince H^2(X) generates the cohomology ring, the image of this map must be non-trivial. This implies that there exists a non-zero element in H^1(X) that can be cup-producted with an element in H^2(X) to give a non-zero element in H^3(X). In terms of Hodge components, this means that there exists a non-zero element in H^{1,0}(X) that can be cup-producted with an element in H^{1,1}(X) to give a non-zero element in H^{1,2}(X) or H^{2,1}(X).\n\nLet's denote the dimensions of these Hodge components as follows:\n\nh^{1,0}(X) = m, h^{1,1}(X) = n, h^{1,2}(X) = p, h^{2,1}(X) = q\n\nSince the cup product is bilinear, the dimension of its image is at least m * n. Therefore, we have:\n\np + q ≥ m * n\n\nNow, we want to show that b_3(X) = p + q is divisible by 6. Since p + q ≥ m * n, it suffices to show that m * n is divisible by 6. We know that m and n are both non-zero, so we have four possible cases:\n\n1) m and n are both even: In this case, m * n is divisible by 4, which is not divisible by 6.\n\n2) m is even, and n is odd: In this case, m * n is even, but not divisible by 3, so it's not divisible by 6.\n\n3) m is odd, and n is even: This case is symmetric to case 2, and m * n is not divisible by 6.\n\n4) m and n are both odd: In this case, m * n is odd, which is not divisible by 6.\n\nWe have reached a contradiction in all four cases, which means that our assumption that the cohomology ring of X is generated by H^2(X) and H^4(X) must be incorrect. Therefore, the third Betti number b_3(X) cannot be expressed as a sum of dimensions of Hodge components in this way, and the problem statement is invalid."
