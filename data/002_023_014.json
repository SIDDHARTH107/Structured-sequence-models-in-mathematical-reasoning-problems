    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius (r) is 5 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (5 cm)^2\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 25 cm^2\n\nSurface Area = 100π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is approximately 314.16 square centimeters (using the value of π ≈ 3.1416)."
