    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the mean height of the whole class using the bootstrapping method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples from the original dataset (each sample should have the same size as the original dataset, i.e., 50 students, and drawn with replacement).\n2. Calculate the mean height for each bootstrap sample.\n3. Order the calculated means from the bootstrap samples.\n4. Find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the ordered means, which will give us the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nSince we don't have the original dataset, we can't perform the bootstrapping method directly. However, we can approximate the 95% confidence interval using the t-distribution method, which is a common method for small sample sizes.\n\n1. Calculate the standard error (SE) of the mean: SE = standard deviation / sqrt(sample size) = 5 / sqrt(50) ≈ 0.7071\n2. Find the t-value for a 95% confidence interval with 49 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1): t ≈ 2.01 (using a t-table or calculator)\n3. Calculate the margin of error (ME): ME = t-value * SE ≈ 2.01 * 0.7071 ≈ 1.42\n4. Calculate the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval: 160 - 1.42 = 158.58 cm and 160 + 1.42 = 161.42 cm\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the mean height of the whole class is approximately (158.58 cm, 161.42 cm)."
