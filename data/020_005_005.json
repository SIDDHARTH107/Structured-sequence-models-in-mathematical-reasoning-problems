    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: type A and type B. The company has a total of 50 units of raw material and 40 units of labor available each day. Each unit of type A requires 2 units of raw material and 1 unit of labor, while each unit of type B requires 1 unit of raw material and 3 units of labor. The profit per unit of type A is $10 and the profit per unit of type B is $15. \n\nFormulate an integer programming model to maximize the daily profit for the company. How many units of each product should the company produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of type A produced and y be the number of units of type B produced.\n\nObjective function (daily profit to be maximized):\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nConstraints (raw material and labor availability):\n2x + y ≤ 50 (raw material constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 40 (labor constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nWe need to find the values of x and y that maximize the objective function P, while satisfying the constraints.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 50\ny ≤ -2x + 50\n\n2. x + 3y ≤ 40\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 40/3\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0,0), (0, 13.33), (20, 10), and (25, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0,13.33) = 10(0) + 15(13.33) = $199.95\n3. P(20,10) = 10(20) + 15(10) = $350\n4. P(25,0) = 10(25) + 15(0) = $250\n\nThe maximum daily profit occurs at point (20,10), with a profit of $350. Therefore, the company should produce 20 units of type A and 10 units of type B to maximize their daily profit."
