    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from node A to node E using Dijkstra's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and a table to store the shortest distance to each node from the starting node (A). Initialize the distance to the starting node as 0 and the distance to all other nodes as infinity.\n\n```\nUnvisited: {A, B, C, D, E, F}\nDistances: {A: 0, B: ∞, C: ∞, D: ∞, E: ∞, F: ∞}\n```\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (A) and update the distances of its neighbors. Mark the node as visited.\n\n```\nVisited: {A}\nUnvisited: {B, C, D, E, F}\nDistances: {A: 0, B: 3, C: ∞, D: 2, E: 6, F: ∞}\n```\n\n3. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (D) and update the distances of its neighbors. Mark the node as visited.\n\n```\nVisited: {A, D}\nUnvisited: {B, C, E, F}\nDistances: {A: 0, B: 3, C: ∞, D: 2, E: 6, F: ∞}\n```\n\nNote that the distance to node E (6) is not updated because the path through D (2 + 8 = 10) is longer than the current distance.\n\n4. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (B) and update the distances of its neighbors. Mark the node as visited.\n\n```\nVisited: {A, D, B}\nUnvisited: {C, E, F}\nDistances: {A: 0, B: 3, C: 8, D: 2, E: 6, F: 4}\n```\n\n5. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (F) and update the distances of its neighbors. Mark the node as visited.\n\n```\nVisited: {A, D, B, F}\nUnvisited: {C, E}\nDistances: {A: 0, B: 3, C: 8, D: 2, E: 6, F: 4}\n```\n\nNote that the distance to node E (6) is not updated because the path through F (4 + 2 = 6) is equal to the current distance.\n\n6. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (E) and mark it as visited. Since E is our destination node, we can stop the algorithm here.\n\n```\nVisited: {A, D, B, F, E}\nUnvisited: {C}\nDistances: {A: 0, B: 3, C: 8, D: 2, E: 6, F: 4}\n```\n\nThe shortest path from node A to node E is A -> B -> F -> E with a total distance of 6."
