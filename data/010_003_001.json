    "message_2": "Let X be a compact space with 10 points, and let's denote these points as {x1, x2, ..., x10}. Since every two distinct points in X can be separated by open neighborhoods, for each pair of points (xi, xj) with i ≠ j, there exist open sets Ui and Uj such that xi ∈ Ui, xj ∈ Uj, and Ui ∩ Uj = ∅.\n\nNow, let's consider the collection of all possible open sets that can be formed by taking unions of these open neighborhoods. Since there are 10 points, there are 2^10 = 1024 possible subsets of X, including the empty set and X itself. However, not all of these subsets are open sets. We need to exclude the sets that cannot be expressed as a union of open neighborhoods.\n\nFirst, let's consider the empty set, which is always an open set. So, we have at least one open set.\n\nNext, let's consider the singletons {xi}. Since every two distinct points can be separated by open neighborhoods, there exists an open set containing xi and not containing any other point. Therefore, there are 10 open sets corresponding to the singletons.\n\nNow, let's consider the sets with two points {xi, xj}. Since every two distinct points can be separated by open neighborhoods, there exists an open set containing both xi and xj and not containing any other point. There are C(10, 2) = 45 such sets.\n\nSimilarly, for sets with three points {xi, xj, xk}, there exists an open set containing all three points and not containing any other point. There are C(10, 3) = 120 such sets.\n\nContinuing this process, we have:\n\n- C(10, 4) = 210 open sets with four points.\n- C(10, 5) = 252 open sets with five points.\n- C(10, 6) = 210 open sets with six points.\n- C(10, 7) = 120 open sets with seven points.\n- C(10, 8) = 45 open sets with eight points.\n- C(10, 9) = 10 open sets with nine points.\n\nFinally, the entire set X is itself an open set.\n\nSo, the total number of open sets in X is:\n\n1 (empty set) + 10 (singletons) + 45 (two points) + 120 (three points) + 210 (four points) + 252 (five points) + 210 (six points) + 120 (seven points) + 45 (eight points) + 10 (nine points) + 1 (whole set) = 1024.\n\nThus, there are 1024 open sets in the compact topological space X with 10 points."
