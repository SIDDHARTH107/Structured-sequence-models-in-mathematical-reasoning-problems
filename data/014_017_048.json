    "message_1": "Suppose you are given an encrypted message consisting of only lowercase English letters. After performing frequency analysis, you find that the letter 'a' appears 25 times, 'b' appears 35 times, 'c' appears 18 times and 'd' appears 22 times. Assuming that the message is written in English, estimate the frequency of the letter 'e' in the original message.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the frequency of the letter 'e' in the original message, we can use the relative frequencies of letters in the English language. According to the frequency analysis of English letters, the most common letters are 'e', 't', 'a', 'o', 'i', 'n', 's', 'h', 'r', 'd', and so on.\n\nThe given information tells us the frequency of 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' in the encrypted message. We can use the frequency of 'a' and 'd' to estimate the frequency of 'e', as they are close in frequency in the English language.\n\nThe frequency of 'a' in English is approximately 8.2%, and the frequency of 'd' is approximately 4.3%. The frequency of 'e' is approximately 12.7%. We can use these percentages to estimate the frequency of 'e' in the original message.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of letters in the encrypted message:\nTotal letters = 25 (a) + 35 (b) + 18 (c) + 22 (d) = 100\n\nNow, let's find the average frequency of 'a' and 'd' in the encrypted message:\nAverage frequency of 'a' and 'd' = (25 + 22) / 2 = 23.5\n\nNext, we can find the ratio of the frequency of 'e' to the average frequency of 'a' and 'd' in English:\nRatio = (12.7% (e) / ((8.2% (a) + 4.3% (d)) / 2)) = 12.7% / 6.25% ≈ 2.032\n\nNow, we can estimate the frequency of 'e' in the original message by multiplying the average frequency of 'a' and 'd' in the encrypted message by the ratio:\nEstimated frequency of 'e' = 23.5 * 2.032 ≈ 47.75\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a letter, we can round the result to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the estimated frequency of the letter 'e' in the original message is approximately 48 times."
