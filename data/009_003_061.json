    "message_1": "Sure! Here's an example precise numerical problem for a math student to solve within the subject of differential equations and heat transfer:\n\nA metal plate of length 5 cm, width 4 cm, and thickness 1 cm initially has a temperature distribution of T(x,y,0) = 120 + (x^2 + y^2)/10, where x and y are measured in centimeters. The plate is then placed in a furnace where the temperature is held constant at 400°C for 5 hours. Use the heat diffusion equation to model the change in temperature over time within the metal plate, assuming that the temperature is constant on the edges of the plate and that the metal plate's thermal diffusivity is 0.1 cm^2/s. Determine the temperature distribution T(x,y,t) within the metal plate at t=2.5 hours.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat diffusion equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α(∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y²)\n\nwhere T(x, y, t) is the temperature distribution, α is the thermal diffusivity, and t is the time.\n\nGiven the boundary conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables to solve the heat diffusion equation. We assume that the solution can be written as a product of functions of x, y, and t:\n\nT(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat diffusion equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)dT(t)/dt = α(X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t))\n\nDividing both sides by αXYT, we obtain:\n\n(1/αT)dT/dt = X''/X + Y''/Y\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\n(1/αT)dT/dt = -λ\nX''/X = -μ\nY''/Y = -(λ - μ)\n\nNow we have three ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n(1) dT/dt + αλT = 0\n(2) X'' + μX = 0\n(3) Y'' + (λ - μ)Y = 0\n\nSolving equation (1) for T(t), we get:\n\nT(t) = C1 * exp(-αλt)\n\nSolving equation (2) for X(x) and equation (3) for Y(y), we get:\n\nX(x) = C2 * cos(√μx) + C3 * sin(√μx)\nY(y) = C4 * cosh(√(λ - μ)y) + C5 * sinh(√(λ - μ)y)\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions:\n\nT(x, 0, t) = T(x, 4, t) = 400\nX(0) = X(5) = 0\n\nApplying the boundary conditions to X(x) and Y(y), we get:\n\nC2 = 0\nC4 = 400\nC5 = 0\n\nSo, the solutions for X(x) and Y(y) are:\n\nX(x) = C3 * sin(√μx)\nY(y) = 400 * cosh(√(λ - μ)y)\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvalues λ and μ that satisfy the boundary conditions. We can do this by using Fourier series:\n\nT(x, y, 0) = 120 + (x^2 + y^2)/10 = Σ Σ A(m, n) * sin(mπx/5) * cosh(nπy/4)\n\nwhere A(m, n) are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nTo find A(m, n), we need to solve the following equation:\n\nA(m, n) = (16/π²mn) * ∫∫ (120 + (x^2 + y^2)/10) * sin(mπx/5) * cosh(nπy/4) dx dy\n\nNow, we can write the solution for T(x, y, t) as:\n\nT(x, y, t) = Σ Σ A(m, n) * sin(mπx/5) * cosh(nπy/4) * exp(-αλt)\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature distribution at t = 2.5 hours (9000 seconds) by plugging in the values:\n\nT(x, y, 9000) = Σ Σ A(m, n) * sin(mπx/5) * cosh(nπy/4) * exp(-0.1λ * 9000)\n\nThis is the temperature distribution within the metal plate at t = 2.5 hours. To find the exact temperature at any point (x, y), we need to calculate the Fourier coefficients A(m, n) and then evaluate the sum."
