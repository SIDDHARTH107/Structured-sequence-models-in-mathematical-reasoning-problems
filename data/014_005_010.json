If the hash of the message is 17, what should be the value of the private key exponent so that the digital signature of the message is valid?",
    "message_2": "To find the private key exponent (d) in the RSA algorithm, we need to compute the modular inverse of the public exponent (e) with respect to the totient of the modulus (φ(n)). The modulus n is given as 209.\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factors of the modulus n. Since 209 is a small number, we can easily find its prime factors by trial division:\n\n209 = 11 * 19\n\nNow, we can compute the totient of the modulus:\n\nφ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = (11 - 1) * (19 - 1) = 10 * 18 = 180\n\nNext, we need to find the modular inverse of the public exponent e = 5 with respect to φ(n) = 180. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse:\n\n5 * d ≡ 1 (mod 180)\n\nBy applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that:\n\nd = 29\n\nSo, the private key exponent (d) should be 29 for the digital signature of the message to be valid."
