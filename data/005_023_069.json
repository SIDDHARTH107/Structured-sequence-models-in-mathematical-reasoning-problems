    "message_1": "A company produced 100 units of a product, and the average weight of each unit is 50g with a standard deviation of 2g. However, one of the units weighed 62g. Is this unit considered an outlier? Explain your reasoning.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the unit with a weight of 62g is an outlier, we can use the z-score method. The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean. A general rule of thumb is that if the z-score is greater than 3 or less than -3, the data point can be considered an outlier.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the z-score for the unit with a weight of 62g. The formula for the z-score is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the data point (62g), μ is the mean (50g), and σ is the standard deviation (2g).\n\nz = (62 - 50) / 2\nz = 12 / 2\nz = 6\n\nThe z-score for the unit with a weight of 62g is 6, which is greater than 3. Therefore, this unit can be considered an outlier."
