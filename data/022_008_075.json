    "message_2": "To find the number of roots of f(z) in the closed disk |z| ≤ 2, we can apply Rouche's theorem. Rouche's theorem states that if two analytic functions f(z) and g(z) satisfy |f(z) - g(z)| < |f(z)| + |g(z)| on a closed contour, then f(z) and g(z) have the same number of zeros inside the contour, counting multiplicities.\n\nLet's consider the function g(z) = z^3. We want to show that |f(z) - g(z)| < |f(z)| + |g(z)| on the circle |z| = 2.\n\nOn the circle |z| = 2, we have:\n\n|f(z) - g(z)| = |2z^2 + 3z - 4|\n|f(z)| = |z^3 + 2z^2 + 3z - 4|\n|g(z)| = |z^3|\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of |2z^2 + 3z - 4| on the circle |z| = 2:\n\n|2z^2 + 3z - 4| ≤ 2|z|^2 + 3|z| + 4\n= 2(2^2) + 3(2) + 4\n= 16 + 6 + 4\n= 26\n\nOn the other hand, |z^3| on the circle |z| = 2 is:\n\n|z^3| = |(2)^3| = 8\n\nSince 26 < 8 + 8, Rouche's theorem applies, and f(z) has the same number of roots as g(z) inside the circle |z| = 2. Since g(z) = z^3 has 3 roots (counting multiplicities) at z = 0, f(z) also has 3 roots inside the closed disk |z| ≤ 2."
