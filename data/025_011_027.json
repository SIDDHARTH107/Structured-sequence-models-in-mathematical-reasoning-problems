    "message_2": "Let E be an elliptic curve defined over the field of complex numbers C. Recall that a torsion point P on E is a point such that there exists a positive integer n for which nP = O, where O is the identity element of the elliptic curve and nP denotes the nth multiple of the point P.\n\nWe want to show that there are at most finitely many non-trivial torsion points on E. To do this, we will use the fact that E can be embedded into its complex torus, which is isomorphic to C/Z + Zτ, where τ is a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part.\n\nConsider the Weierstrass ℘-function and its derivative ℘'(z), which are meromorphic functions on C with periods 1 and τ. The elliptic curve E can be represented in the Weierstrass form:\n\nE: y^2 = 4x^3 - g_2x - g_3,\n\nwhere g_2 and g_3 are constants related to the ℘-function and its derivative. The map φ: C/Z + Zτ → E given by\n\nφ(z) = (℘(z), ℘'(z))\n\nis an isomorphism between the complex torus and the elliptic curve E.\n\nNow, let P be a torsion point of order n on E. Then nP = O, and since φ is an isomorphism, there exists a point z in C/Z + Zτ such that φ(z) = P. Moreover, we have\n\nφ(nz) = nφ(z) = nP = O.\n\nSince φ is periodic with periods 1 and τ, this implies that nz is also a point in the complex torus C/Z + Zτ. Thus, nz = m + m'τ for some integers m and m'. Dividing by n, we get\n\nz = (m/n) + (m'/n)τ.\n\nSince z is in C/Z + Zτ, the real and imaginary parts of z must be in the interval [0, 1). Therefore, there are only finitely many possibilities for the fractions m/n and m'/n, as they must be rational numbers with denominator at most n.\n\nAs a result, there are only finitely many possible points z in the complex torus that can correspond to torsion points on E under the isomorphism φ. This implies that there are at most finitely many non-trivial torsion points on the elliptic curve E."
