    "message_1": "A group of math students are playing the Prisoner's Dilemma game. Each student has the option to either cooperate or defect, with the following payoffs:\n\n- If both students cooperate, each receives 5 points.\n- If both students defect, each receives 2 points.\n- If one student cooperates and the other defects, the defector receives 7 points and the cooperator receives 1 point.\n\nStudent A must decide whether to cooperate or defect, without knowing what Student B will do. If Student A chooses to cooperate, what is the best option for Student B to maximize their payoff?",
    "message_2": "If Student A chooses to cooperate, the best option for Student B to maximize their payoff is to defect. In this case, Student B will receive 7 points, while Student A will receive 1 point."
