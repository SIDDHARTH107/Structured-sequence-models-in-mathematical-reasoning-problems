    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve at t = 1, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to t.\n\nFirst derivatives:\nx'(t) = 6t + 4\ny'(t) = 6t^2 - 10t - 2\nz'(t) = 10t - 2\n\nSecond derivatives:\nx''(t) = 6\ny''(t) = 12t - 10\nz''(t) = 10\n\nNow, we evaluate the first and second derivatives at t = 1:\nx'(1) = 6 + 4 = 10\ny'(1) = 6 - 10 - 2 = -6\nz'(1) = 10 - 2 = 8\n\nx''(1) = 6\ny''(1) = 12 - 10 = 2\nz''(1) = 10\n\nThe tangent vector T(t) is given by the first derivatives:\nT(t) = <x'(t), y'(t), z'(t)>\nT(1) = <10, -6, 8>\n\nThe curvature, k, is given by the formula:\nk = ||T'(t)|| / ||T(t)||^3\n\nT'(t) = <x''(t), y''(t), z''(t)>\nT'(1) = <6, 2, 10>\n\nNow, we find the magnitudes of T(1) and T'(1):\n||T(1)|| = sqrt(10^2 + (-6)^2 + 8^2) = sqrt(200)\n||T'(1)|| = sqrt(6^2 + 2^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(140)\n\nNow, we can find the curvature k:\nk = (sqrt(140)) / (sqrt(200))^3 = sqrt(140) / (200 * sqrt(200)) ≈ 0.0185\n\nTo find the torsion, τ, we need to compute the cross product of T(t) and T'(t), and then divide by the cube of the magnitude of T(t).\n\nN(t) = T(t) x T'(t)\nN(1) = <10, -6, 8> x <6, 2, 10>\nN(1) = <-52, -40, 52>\n\nNow, we find the dot product of N(t) and T'(t):\nN(1) • T'(1) = -52 * 6 + (-40) * 2 + 52 * 10 = -312 - 80 + 520 = 128\n\nFinally, we can find the torsion τ:\nτ = (N(1) • T'(1)) / ||T(t)||^3\nτ = 128 / (200 * sqrt(200)) ≈ 0.0085\n\nSo, the curvature k ≈ 0.0185 and the torsion τ ≈ 0.0085 at t = 1."
