    "message_2": "The maximum Lyapunov exponent of the Rössler system can be estimated numerically. The Rössler system is a set of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nGiven the parameters a = 0.2, b = 0.2, and c = 5.7, we can estimate the maximum Lyapunov exponent using numerical methods, such as the Wolf algorithm or the Rosenstein algorithm. However, these calculations are beyond the scope of a simple text-based response.\n\nI recommend using specialized software or programming languages, such as MATLAB or Python, to estimate the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the given Rössler system parameters."
