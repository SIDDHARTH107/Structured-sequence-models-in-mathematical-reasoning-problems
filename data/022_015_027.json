    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of $f(z) = \\sqrt{z-1}$ to the lower half plane, we will use the Schwarz reflection principle. The Schwarz reflection principle states that if a function is analytic in a domain and continuous on its boundary, then its reflection across the boundary is also analytic.\n\nFirst, let's consider the reflection of $f(z)$ across the real axis. We have:\n\n$$f(\\bar{z}) = \\sqrt{\\bar{z} - 1}$$\n\nNow, we want to find the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the lower half plane. According to the given conditions, $f(z)$ satisfies the equation $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})} = f(z)$ on the real axis for $z > 1$. Therefore, we can write the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ to the lower half plane as:\n\n$$f_{\\text{lower}}(z) = \\overline{f(\\bar{z})} = \\overline{\\sqrt{\\bar{z} - 1}}$$\n\nSo, the analytic continuation of $f(z) = \\sqrt{z-1}$ to the lower half plane is given by:\n\n$$f_{\\text{lower}}(z) = \\overline{\\sqrt{\\bar{z} - 1}}$$"
