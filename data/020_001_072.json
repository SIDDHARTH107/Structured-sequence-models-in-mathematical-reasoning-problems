    "message_1": "A farmer has 100 acres of land and wants to plant wheat and corn. The cost of planting an acre of wheat is $200, and the cost of planting an acre of corn is $150. The farmer has $25,000 to spend on planting the two crops. The farmer can sell a bushel of wheat for $10 and sell a bushel of corn for $7. The farm can produce a maximum of 2000 bushels of wheat and 3000 bushels of corn. How many acres of wheat and corn should the farmer plant to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of wheat and y be the number of acres of corn. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 100 (total acres constraint)\n2. 200x + 150y ≤ 25,000 (total cost constraint)\n\nWe also have the production constraints:\n\n3. x ≤ 2000 (maximum wheat production)\n4. y ≤ 3000 (maximum corn production)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 10 * bushels of wheat + 7 * bushels of corn\n\nSince we don't have the information about how many bushels are produced per acre for each crop, we will assume that the farmer can produce B1 bushels of wheat per acre and B2 bushels of corn per acre. Then the profit function becomes:\n\nProfit = 10 * (B1 * x) + 7 * (B2 * y)\n\nNow we need to find the values of x and y that maximize the profit function while satisfying the constraints.\n\nFirst, let's solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\n1. y ≤ 100 - x\n2. y ≤ (25,000 - 200x) / 150\n\nSince x and y are both non-negative, we have the following system of inequalities:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\ny ≤ 100 - x\ny ≤ (25,000 - 200x) / 150\n\nWe will now graph these inequalities and find the feasible region.\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 100), (75, 25), and (100, 0). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. Profit at (0, 0) = 10 * (B1 * 0) + 7 * (B2 * 0) = 0\n2. Profit at (0, 100) = 10 * (B1 * 0) + 7 * (B2 * 100) = 700 * B2\n3. Profit at (75, 25) = 10 * (B1 * 75) + 7 * (B2 * 25) = 750 * B1 + 175 * B2\n4. Profit at (100, 0) = 10 * (B1 * 100) + 7 * (B2 * 0) = 1000 * B1\n\nSince B1 and B2 are positive, the maximum profit will be achieved at either point (75, 25) or point (100, 0), depending on the values of B1 and B2. The farmer should plant either 75 acres of wheat and 25 acres of corn or 100 acres of wheat and no corn to maximize profit, depending on the bushels produced per acre for each crop."
