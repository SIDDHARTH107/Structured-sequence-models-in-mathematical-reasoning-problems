    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function $f(z)= \\frac{z^2+4}{(z+1)(z^2+1)}$ at its pole $z=i$, we can make use of the formula for computing the residue of a function at a simple pole:\n\nResidue = $\\lim_{z \\to i} (z - i) f(z)$\n\nFirst, let's simplify the function $f(z)$:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{z^2+4}{(z+1)(z^2+1)} = \\frac{(z^2+1)+3}{(z+1)(z^2+1)} = \\frac{(z^2+1)}{(z+1)(z^2+1)} + \\frac{3}{(z+1)(z^2+1)}$\n\nSince $z=i$ is a pole of $f(z)$, we know that $(z^2+1)$ has a factor of $(z-i)$. Let's perform polynomial long division to find the other factor:\n\n$(z^2+1) \\div (z-i) = (z+i)$\n\nSo, we can rewrite $f(z)$ as:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{(z^2+1)}{(z+1)(z-i)(z+i)} + \\frac{3}{(z+1)(z^2+1)}$\n\nNow, let's compute the residue:\n\nResidue = $\\lim_{z \\to i} (z - i) f(z) = \\lim_{z \\to i} (z - i) \\left(\\frac{(z^2+1)}{(z+1)(z-i)(z+i)} + \\frac{3}{(z+1)(z^2+1)}\\right)$\n\nSince the first term has a factor of $(z-i)$ in the denominator, it will cancel out with the $(z-i)$ in the limit, leaving us with:\n\nResidue = $\\lim_{z \\to i} \\left(\\frac{3}{(z+1)(z^2+1)}\\right)$\n\nNow, we can plug in $z=i$:\n\nResidue = $\\frac{3}{(i+1)((i)^2+1)} = \\frac{3}{(i+1)(-1+1)}$\n\nThe denominator becomes 0, which means the residue is undefined. However, this is not possible since we know that $z=i$ is a simple pole. This contradiction arises because we made an error in the simplification of $f(z)$.\n\nLet's go back to the original function:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{z^2+4}{(z+1)(z^2+1)}$\n\nNow, let's compute the residue using the correct formula:\n\nResidue = $\\lim_{z \\to i} (z - i) f(z) = \\lim_{z \\to i} (z - i) \\frac{z^2+4}{(z+1)(z^2+1)}$\n\nTo evaluate this limit, we can use L'Hopital's rule. Differentiating the numerator and denominator with respect to $z$, we get:\n\nNumerator: $2z$\n\nDenominator: $(1)(z^2+1) + (z+1)(2z)$\n\nNow, let's plug in $z=i$:\n\nNumerator: $2i$\n\nDenominator: $(1)((i)^2+1) + (i+1)(2i) = (1)(-1+1) + (i+1)(2i) = 2i^2 + 2i = -2 + 2i$\n\nNow, we can compute the limit:\n\nResidue = $\\frac{2i}{-2 + 2i}$\n\nTo express the residue in standard form, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\nResidue = $\\frac{2i(-2 - 2i)}{(-2 + 2i)(-2 - 2i)} = \\frac{-4i - 4i^2}{4 + 4i^2} = \\frac{-4i + 4}{4 - 4} = \\frac{-4i + 4}{0}$\n\nAgain, we get a denominator of 0, which means the residue is undefined. This is not possible since we know that $z=i$ is a simple pole. This contradiction arises because we made an error in applying L'Hopital's rule, which is not applicable in this case.\n\nInstead, let's rewrite the function $f(z)$ as:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{(z^2+1)+3}{(z+1)(z^2+1)} = 1 + \\frac{3}{(z+1)(z^2+1)}$\n\nNow, let's compute the residue:\n\nResidue = $\\lim_{z \\to i} (z - i) f(z) = \\lim_{z \\to i} (z - i) \\left(1 + \\frac{3}{(z+1)(z^2+1)}\\right)$\n\nSince the first term does not have a factor of $(z-i)$ in the denominator, it will not contribute to the residue. So, we only need to consider the second term:\n\nResidue = $\\lim_{z \\to i} (z - i) \\frac{3}{(z+1)(z^2+1)}$\n\nNow, we can plug in $z=i$:\n\nResidue = $(i - i) \\frac{3}{(i+1)((i)^2+1)} = 0 \\cdot \\frac{3}{(i+1)(-1+1)} = 0$\n\nSo, the residue of the function $f(z)= \\frac{z^2+4}{(z+1)(z^2+1)}$ at its pole $z=i$ is 0."
