    "message_1": "A company is considering whether to invest in a new production facility that will cost $500,000 to build. The probability of success for the project is estimated to be 0.7, while the probability of failure is estimated to be 0.3. If the project is successful, the company will receive a profit of $1,000,000. If the project fails, the company will suffer a loss of $200,000. Is it a good decision for the company to invest in the new production facility?",
    "message_2": "To determine if it is a good decision for the company to invest in the new production facility, we can calculate the expected value of the investment. The expected value is the sum of the possible outcomes, each multiplied by their respective probabilities.\n\nExpected value (EV) = (Probability of success * Profit) + (Probability of failure * Loss)\n\nEV = (0.7 * $1,000,000) - (0.3 * $200,000)\n\nEV = ($700,000) - ($60,000)\n\nEV = $640,000\n\nSince the expected value of the investment is positive ($640,000), it is a good decision for the company to invest in the new production facility."
