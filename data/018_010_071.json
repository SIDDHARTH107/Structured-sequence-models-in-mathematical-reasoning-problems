    "message_2": "First, let's find B ∪ {5}. The union of two sets is the set containing all elements from both sets. So, B ∪ {5} = {3, 4, 5}.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product A × (B ∪ {5}). The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. So, A × (B ∪ {5}) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}.\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product A × B. A × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\nFinally, let's find the difference (A × (B ∪ {5})) \\ (A × B). This is the set of elements in A × (B ∪ {5}) that are not in A × B. So, (A × (B ∪ {5})) \\ (A × B) = {(1, 5), (2, 5)}.\n\nTherefore, the solution is {(1, 5), (2, 5)}."
