    "message_1": "Here's an example of a higher-order logic problem for a math student: \n\nLet P: x is a prime number and Q: y is an odd number. Determine if the following statement is true or false:\n\n(∀x)((P(x) ∧ Q(x)) → ((∀y)(Q(y) → P(x*y+1))))\n\nIn other words, does the statement \"for all prime numbers x and odd numbers y, if y is odd then x multiplied by y plus 1 is also prime\" hold true or false in higher-order logic?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the statement is true or false, we can test it with specific values for x and y.\n\nLet x = 3 (a prime number) and y = 3 (an odd number).\n\nAccording to the statement, if y is odd (which it is), then x multiplied by y plus 1 should also be prime.\n\nx * y + 1 = 3 * 3 + 1 = 10\n\n10 is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself (2 and 5).\n\nTherefore, the statement is false in higher-order logic."
