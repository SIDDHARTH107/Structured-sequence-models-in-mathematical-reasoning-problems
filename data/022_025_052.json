    "message_2": "To find the poles of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2 + 1}$, we need to find the values of z for which the function is undefined. This occurs when the denominator is equal to zero.\n\nSo, we need to solve the equation $z^2 + 1 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in the complex domain.\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for z:\n\n$z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = 0$, and $c = 1$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$z = \\frac{-0 \\pm \\sqrt{0^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}$\n\n$z = \\frac{\\pm \\sqrt{-4}}{2}$\n\nNow, we can simplify the square root of -4 as $2i$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit. So, we have:\n\n$z = \\frac{\\pm 2i}{2}$\n\n$z = \\pm i$\n\nThus, the poles of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2 + 1}$ are $z = i$ and $z = -i$."
