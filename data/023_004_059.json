    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-2|x|), we first need to define the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform F(k) of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the integral is taken over the entire real line.\n\nIn this case, f(x) = e^(-2|x|). We can split the integral into two parts, one for x ≥ 0 and one for x < 0:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-2x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx + ∫[e^(2x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, where the first integral is taken over [0, ∞) and the second integral is taken over (-∞, 0).\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials and integrate each part separately:\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-2x - 2πikx)] dx from 0 to ∞ + ∫[e^(2x - 2πikx)] dx from -∞ to 0.\n\nTo evaluate these integrals, we can use integration by parts or recognize them as integrals of the form ∫[e^(ax)] dx = (1/a)e^(ax) + C, where a is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor the first integral:\n\n∫[e^(-2x - 2πikx)] dx = (-1/2 - πik)^(-1) * e^(-2x - 2πikx) evaluated from 0 to ∞.\n\nFor the second integral:\n\n∫[e^(2x - 2πikx)] dx = (1/2 - πik)^(-1) * e^(2x - 2πikx) evaluated from -∞ to 0.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limits:\n\nF(k) = [(-1/2 - πik)^(-1) * (0 - e^(0))] + [(1/2 - πik)^(-1) * (e^(0) - 0)]\nF(k) = (-1/2 - πik)^(-1) + (1/2 - πik)^(-1)\n\nFinally, we can simplify the expression by finding a common denominator:\n\nF(k) = [(-1/2 - πik + 1/2 - πik) / ((-1/2 - πik)(1/2 - πik))]\nF(k) = (-2πik) / (1/4 - (πik)^2 + πik)\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-2|x|):\n\nF(k) = (-2πik) / (1/4 - (πik)^2 + πik)"
