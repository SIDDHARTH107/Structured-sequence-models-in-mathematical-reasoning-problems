    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x), we need to determine the coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ. Since the function is odd, we know that aₙ = 0 for all n. The function has a period of 2π, so we will use the formulas for bₙ and a₀ for a function with period 2π.\n\na₀ = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\n\nSince f(x) is odd, the integral of f(x) over the symmetric interval [-π, π] is 0. Therefore, a₀ = 0.\n\nNow, let's find bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) is odd and sin(nx) is odd, their product is even. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * ∫[0, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nNow, we need to split the integral into two parts, one for 0 < x < π and one for -π < x < 0:\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (-1) * sin(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] (1) * sin(nx) dx]\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [-∫[-π, 0] sin(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] sin(nx) dx]\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [-(-cos(nx)/n)|[-π, 0] + (cos(nx)/n)|[0, π]]\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [(cos(nπ)/n - 1/n) - (cos(0)/n - 1/n)]\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * [(cos(nπ)/n - 1/n) + (1/n - 1/n)]\n\nbₙ = (2/π) * (cos(nπ)/n)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ (2/π) * (cos(nπ)/n) * sin(nx)\n\nTo find the value of f(x) at x = π/2, we plug in x = π/2:\n\nf(π/2) = Σ (2/π) * (cos(nπ)/n) * sin(nπ/2)\n\nNotice that when n is even, sin(nπ/2) = 0, so we only need to consider odd values of n. Let m = 2k - 1, where k is a positive integer. Then:\n\nf(π/2) = Σ (2/π) * (cos((2k-1)π)/(2k-1)) * sin((2k-1)π/2)\n\nNow, cos((2k-1)π) = -1^(2k-1) = -1 for all k, and sin((2k-1)π/2) = 1 for all k. Therefore:\n\nf(π/2) = Σ (2/π) * (-1/(2k-1))\n\nSince f(x) = 1 for 0 < x < π, we have:\n\nf(π/2) = 1\n\nSo, the value of the function f(x) at x = π/2 is 1."
