    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two, and can be represented as M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is a prime number. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 1 million, we can start by testing prime values of n and checking if the resulting Mersenne number is prime.\n\nAfter testing a few prime values of n, we find that when n = 31, the Mersenne number is:\n\nM_31 = 2^31 - 1 = 2,147,483,647\n\n2,147,483,647 is a prime number, and it is greater than 1 million. Therefore, the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 1 million is 2,147,483,647."
