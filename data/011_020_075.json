Product X requires 2 hours of assembly time and 1 hour of packaging time, product Y requires 1 hour of assembly time and 2 hours of packaging time, and product Z requires 1 hour of assembly time and 1 hour of packaging time. \n\nIf the factory has 10 hours of assembly time available and 8 hours of packaging time available, how many units of each product should be produced to maximize the total production?",
    "message_2": "Let's use linear programming to solve this problem. Let x, y, and z represent the number of units of products X, Y, and Z, respectively. We want to maximize the total production, which is x + y + z.\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n2x + y + z ≤ 10 (assembly time constraint)\nx + 2y + z ≤ 8 (packaging time constraint)\nx, y, z ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nWe can rewrite the constraints as follows:\ny + z ≤ 10 - 2x\ny + z ≤ 8 - x\n\nNow, we can find the feasible region by graphing these inequalities:\n\n1. y + z = 10 - 2x\n   z = 10 - 2x - y\n\n2. y + z = 8 - x\n   z = 8 - x - y\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 3), and (4, 0).\n\nNow, we can evaluate the objective function (x + y + z) at each vertex:\n\n1. (0, 0): x + y + z = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n2. (0, 4): x + y + z = 0 + 4 + (8 - 0 - 4) = 4 + 4 = 8\n3. (2, 3): x + y + z = 2 + 3 + (8 - 2 - 3) = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8\n4. (4, 0): x + y + z = 4 + 0 + (10 - 2*4 - 0) = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nThe maximum total production is 8 units, which can be achieved by producing either 4 units of product Y (vertex (0, 4)) or 2 units of product X and 3 units of product Y (vertex (2, 3))."
