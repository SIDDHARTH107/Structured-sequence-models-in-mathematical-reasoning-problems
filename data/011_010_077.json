    "message_1": "A flower bed is in the form of a grid of 4 by 4. How many paths are there from the bottom left corner to the top right corner if each step must go either up or right and the path cannot go above the diagonal? (Hint: the answer involves a Catalan number).",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Catalan numbers. The nth Catalan number can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n)\n\nIn this case, we have a 4x4 grid, so we need to find the 3rd Catalan number (since we start counting from 0). \n\nC(3) = (1/(3+1)) * (2*3 choose 3)\nC(3) = (1/4) * (6 choose 3)\nC(3) = (1/4) * (6! / (3! * 3!))\nC(3) = (1/4) * (720 / (6 * 6))\nC(3) = (1/4) * (720 / 36)\nC(3) = (1/4) * 20\nC(3) = 5\n\nSo there are 5 paths from the bottom left corner to the top right corner without going above the diagonal in a 4x4 grid."
