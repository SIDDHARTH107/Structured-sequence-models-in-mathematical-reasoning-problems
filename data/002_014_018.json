    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is its total surface area?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length × width.\n\nA rectangular prism has three pairs of congruent faces:\n\n1. Two faces with dimensions 8 cm × 5 cm (length × width)\n2. Two faces with dimensions 8 cm × 3 cm (length × height)\n3. Two faces with dimensions 5 cm × 3 cm (width × height)\n\nNow, let's find the area of each pair of faces:\n\n1. Area of two faces with dimensions 8 cm × 5 cm: 2 × (8 × 5) = 2 × 40 = 80 square cm\n2. Area of two faces with dimensions 8 cm × 3 cm: 2 × (8 × 3) = 2 × 24 = 48 square cm\n3. Area of two faces with dimensions 5 cm × 3 cm: 2 × (5 × 3) = 2 × 15 = 30 square cm\n\nFinally, let's add the areas of all the pairs of faces to find the total surface area:\n\nTotal surface area = 80 + 48 + 30 = 158 square cm"
