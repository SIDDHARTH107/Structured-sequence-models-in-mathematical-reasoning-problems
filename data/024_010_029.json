    "message_1": "Consider the 2-dimensional manifold, given by the surface of a sphere with radius r. Suppose we have a metric on this manifold given by: \n\ng = (r^2 sin^2(theta)) d(phi)^2 + (r^2) d(theta)^2\n\nFind the Levi-Civita connection of this metric.",
    "message_2": "To find the Levi-Civita connection, we need to compute the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, which are given by:\n\nΓ^i_{jk} = (1/2) * g^(il) * (∂g_{lj}/∂x^k + ∂g_{lk}/∂x^j - ∂g_{jk}/∂x^l)\n\nHere, g^(il) is the inverse of the metric tensor g_{il}. Since our metric is diagonal, the inverse is also diagonal, and we have:\n\ng^(11) = 1/(r^2) and g^(22) = 1/(r^2 * sin^2(theta))\n\nNow, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the metric components. Since g_{11} = r^2 and g_{22} = r^2 * sin^2(theta), we have:\n\n∂g_{11}/∂θ = 0\n∂g_{11}/∂φ = 0\n∂g_{22}/∂θ = 2 * r^2 * sin(θ) * cos(θ)\n∂g_{22}/∂φ = 0\n\nNow we can compute the non-zero Christoffel symbols:\n\nΓ^1_{22} = (1/2) * g^(11) * (∂g_{12}/∂x^2 + ∂g_{22}/∂x^1 - ∂g_{21}/∂x^2)\n          = (1/2) * (1/r^2) * (0 + 2 * r^2 * sin(θ) * cos(θ) - 0)\n          = sin(θ) * cos(θ)\n\nΓ^2_{12} = (1/2) * g^(22) * (∂g_{11}/∂x^2 + ∂g_{21}/∂x^1 - ∂g_{12}/∂x^1)\n          = (1/2) * (1/(r^2 * sin^2(θ))) * (0 + 0 - 0)\n          = 0\n\nΓ^2_{21} = Γ^2_{12} = 0\n\nSo, the non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n\nΓ^1_{22} = sin(θ) * cos(θ)\nΓ^2_{12} = Γ^2_{21} = 0\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection is then given by these Christoffel symbols:\n\n∇ = {Γ^i_{jk}} = {Γ^1_{22}, Γ^2_{12}, Γ^2_{21}} = {sin(θ) * cos(θ), 0, 0}"
