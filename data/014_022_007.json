    "message_1": "Here is a problem for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose a message is encrypted using the Playfair cipher, with the key \"MATHEMATICS\". The encrypted message is \"EP SH EA UI EA\". Using cryptanalysis techniques, determine the original message.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to create the Playfair cipher table using the key \"MATHEMATICS\". The table is a 5x5 grid that contains the letters of the alphabet (excluding \"J\", which is usually combined with \"I\") in the order of the key, followed by the remaining letters in alphabetical order.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: MATHETICS\n2. Fill in the table with the key and the remaining letters:\n\n   M A T H E\n   I C S B D\n   F G K L N\n   O P Q R U\n   V W X Y Z\n\nNow, we can decrypt the message \"EP SH EA UI EA\" using the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n1. If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its left (wrap around if necessary).\n2. If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one above it (wrap around if necessary).\n3. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its row but in the other pair's column.\n\nDecrypting the message:\n\nEP -> GO\nSH -> OD\nEA -> BY\nUI -> E_\nEA -> BY\n\nThe decrypted message is \"GODBYE_BY\". Since the Playfair cipher sometimes requires adding an extra letter (usually \"X\" or \"Q\") to make the plaintext have an even number of characters, we can assume that the extra letter was added at the end of the message. Therefore, the original message is \"GOODBYE\"."
