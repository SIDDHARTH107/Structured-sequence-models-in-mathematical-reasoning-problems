    "message_1": "A game consists of spinning a wheel divided into 5 equal sections colored blue, red, yellow, green, and white. If a player bets on blue, what is the probability of winning the game?",
    "message_2": "Since there are 5 equal sections on the wheel and 1 of them is blue, the probability of winning the game by betting on blue is 1 out of 5. In probability notation, this can be written as:\n\nP(winning by betting on blue) = 1/5 or 0.2 or 20%"
