    "message_1": "A manufacturing plant produces two types of products: A and B. The revenue generated from selling each unit of A is $10, and from selling each unit of B is $20. The plant has 100 hours of labour available for manufacturing the products. Each unit of A requires 1 hour of labour and each unit of B requires 2 hours of labour. However, because of the volatile market conditions, the revenue per unit may decrease by 10%. If the plant wants to maximize its revenue, how many units of A and B should they produce? And how much revenue will they generate?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for the labor hours are:\n1x + 2y â‰¤ 100 (since each unit of A requires 1 hour and each unit of B requires 2 hours)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the revenue is:\nR = 10x + 20y (since each unit of A generates $10 and each unit of B generates $20)\n\nHowever, due to the volatile market conditions, the revenue per unit may decrease by 10%. So, the worst-case scenario for the revenue function is:\nR = 0.9(10x + 20y) = 9x + 18y\n\nNow, we need to maximize the worst-case revenue function subject to the labor constraint.\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will analyze the corner points of the feasible region determined by the constraint:\n\n1. (0, 0): R = 9(0) + 18(0) = $0\n2. (100, 0): R = 9(100) + 18(0) = $900\n3. (0, 50): R = 9(0) + 18(50) = $900\n\nThe maximum worst-case revenue is $900, which can be achieved by producing either 100 units of product A or 50 units of product B. The plant can choose either option based on other factors such as market demand or storage capacity."
