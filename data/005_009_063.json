    "message_1": "A group of 10 students took a test where the maximum score was 100. The scores are as follows:\n\n60, 75, 85, 50, 40, 65, 80, 70, 65, 75\n\nCalculate the median, range, and interquartile range of the scores.",
    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the scores in ascending order:\n\n40, 50, 60, 65, 65, 70, 75, 75, 80, 85\n\n1. Median: Since there are 10 scores (an even number), the median will be the average of the middle two scores. The middle two scores are 65 and 70. The median is (65 + 70) / 2 = 67.5.\n\n2. Range: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest scores. The highest score is 85, and the lowest score is 40. The range is 85 - 40 = 45.\n\n3. Interquartile Range (IQR): To find the IQR, we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). Since there are 10 scores, we can find Q1 by taking the median of the lower half of the scores (not including the overall median) and Q3 by taking the median of the upper half of the scores (not including the overall median).\n\nQ1: The lower half of the scores is 40, 50, 60, 65, 65. The median of these scores is 60.\nQ3: The upper half of the scores is 70, 75, 75, 80, 85. The median of these scores is 75.\n\nThe IQR is the difference between Q3 and Q1: IQR = 75 - 60 = 15.\n\nSo, the median is 67.5, the range is 45, and the interquartile range is 15."
