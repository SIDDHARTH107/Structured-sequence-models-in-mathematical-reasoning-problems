    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form, and then back-substitute to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| 2  3  1 |  5 |\n| 1  2 -1 |  1 |\n| 3 -1  2 | -3 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\nTo do this, we can replace the second row with (-1/2) * (first row) + (second row) and replace the third row with (-3/2) * (first row) + (third row).\n\n|  2   3   1 |   5  |\n|  0   0.5 -2 |  -1.5|\n|  0  -5.5  0.5| -10.5|\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\nTo do this, we can replace the third row with (11) * (second row) + (third row).\n\n|  2   3    1  |   5  |\n|  0   0.5  -2 |  -1.5|\n|  0   0    -21| -26  |\n\nStep 3: Normalize the third row by dividing by -21.\n\n|  2   3    1  |   5  |\n|  0   0.5  -2 |  -1.5|\n|  0   0     1 |   26/21 |\n\nNow we have the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix. Let's perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 26/21.\n\nNow substitute z into the second row equation: 0.5y - 2(26/21) = -1.5\nSolve for y: y = -3\n\nNow substitute y and z into the first row equation: 2x + 3(-3) + (26/21) = 5\nSolve for x: x = 2\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = -3, and z = 26/21."
