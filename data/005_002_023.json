    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of 100 apples, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Z-score * (Population Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nGiven:\nSample Mean = 150 grams\nPopulation Standard Deviation = 20 grams\nSample Size = 100 apples\nZ-score for 95% confidence interval = 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 150 ± (1.96 * (20 / √100))\n\nConfidence Interval = 150 ± (1.96 * (20 / 10))\n\nConfidence Interval = 150 ± (1.96 * 2)\n\nConfidence Interval = 150 ± 3.92\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of 100 apples is (146.08, 153.92) grams."
