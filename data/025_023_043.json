    "message_2": "The given equation $y^3 + z^3 = x^3$ defines a complex projective curve in the complex projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$, not in the complex projective 3-space. \n\nTo compute the intersection cohomology of this curve, we first need to find its genus. The curve is a plane curve of degree 3, so we can use the formula for the genus of a plane curve:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$,\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the curve. In this case, $d = 3$, so the genus is:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$.\n\nNow, we can compute the intersection cohomology groups. For a smooth projective curve of genus $g$, the intersection cohomology groups are given by:\n\n$IH^0(C) = \\mathbb{C}$,\n$IH^1(C) = H^1(C, \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathbb{C}^{2g}$,\n$IH^2(C) = \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nIn this case, since the genus is 1, we have:\n\n$IH^0(C) = \\mathbb{C}$,\n$IH^1(C) = \\mathbb{C}^2$,\n$IH^2(C) = \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nSo, the intersection cohomology of the complex projective curve given by the equation $y^3 + z^3 = x^3$ in the complex projective plane is:\n\n$IH^*(C) = \\mathbb{C} \\oplus \\mathbb{C}^2 \\oplus \\mathbb{C}$."
