Suppose that the fiber over each point of $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ is the $2$-dimensional vector space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. \nWhat is the Euler characteristic of this vector bundle?",
    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a vector bundle is the alternating sum of the dimensions of its cohomology groups. In this case, we have a rank-2 vector bundle over the base space $\\mathbb{R}P^2$. Let's denote this vector bundle as $E$.\n\nFirst, we need to compute the cohomology groups of the base space $\\mathbb{R}P^2$. The cohomology ring of $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ is given by:\n\n$H^*(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = \\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^3)$,\n\nwhere $x$ is a generator of $H^1(\\mathbb{R}P^2)$ and has degree 1. Thus, the cohomology groups are:\n\n$H^0(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H^1(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H^2(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H^k(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = 0$ for $k > 2$.\n\nNow, we can compute the Euler characteristic of the vector bundle $E$ using the Whitney sum formula:\n\n$\\chi(E) = \\chi(\\mathbb{R}P^2) \\cdot \\chi(\\mathbb{R}^2)$,\n\nwhere $\\chi(\\mathbb{R}P^2)$ is the Euler characteristic of the base space, and $\\chi(\\mathbb{R}^2)$ is the Euler characteristic of the fiber.\n\nThe Euler characteristic of $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ is given by the alternating sum of the dimensions of its cohomology groups:\n\n$\\chi(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = \\dim H^0(\\mathbb{R}P^2) - \\dim H^1(\\mathbb{R}P^2) + \\dim H^2(\\mathbb{R}P^2) = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1$.\n\nThe Euler characteristic of the fiber $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is 1, since it is a contractible space.\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of the vector bundle $E$ is:\n\n$\\chi(E) = \\chi(\\mathbb{R}P^2) \\cdot \\chi(\\mathbb{R}^2) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$."
