Apply the Riemann mapping theorem to find a biholomorphic map $F:D \\to U$, where $U$ is the open unit disk centered at $3+i$ with radius 2, such that $F(0)=3+i$. What is the expression of $F(z)$?",
    "message_2": "To find a biholomorphic map $F:D \\to U$, we will first find a biholomorphic map from $D$ to the standard unit disk and then compose it with a biholomorphic map from the standard unit disk to $U$.\n\nFirst, we need to find a biholomorphic map $g:D \\to D'$, where $D'$ is the standard unit disk $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}: |z|<1\\}$, such that $g(0)=0$. We can use the given function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{2}(z+1)$, which maps $D$ to a disk of radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ centered at $\\frac{1}{2}$. To map this to the standard unit disk, we can apply a dilation and translation:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{z+1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{z}{2}.$$\n\nNow, we need to find a biholomorphic map $h:D' \\to U$, where $U$ is the open unit disk centered at $3+i$ with radius 2, such that $h(0)=3+i$. We can use a dilation and translation for this:\n\n$$h(z) = 2z + (3+i).$$\n\nFinally, we can find the desired biholomorphic map $F:D \\to U$ by composing $g$ and $h$:\n\n$$F(z) = h(g(z)) = h\\left(\\frac{z}{2}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{z}{2}\\right) + (3+i) = z + (3+i).$$\n\nSo, the expression for $F(z)$ is:\n\n$$F(z) = z + (3+i).$$"
