    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. The production time for A is 2 hours and for B is 3 hours. The factory has 120 hours of production time available per week. The profit for product A is $100 per unit and for product B is $150 per unit. How many units of each product should the factory produce per week to maximize their profit? Use Harmony Search Algorithm to solve the optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the Harmony Search Algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the problem parameters:\n   - Harmony Memory Size (HMS): The number of solutions in the harmony memory (e.g., 10)\n   - Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR): The probability of selecting a value from the harmony memory (e.g., 0.8)\n   - Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR): The probability of adjusting a selected value (e.g., 0.3)\n   - Number of iterations (NI): The number of times the algorithm will be executed (e.g., 1000)\n   - Objective function: Maximize profit P = 100A + 150B, subject to the constraint 2A + 3B <= 120\n\n2. Initialize the harmony memory:\n   - Generate HMS random solutions (A, B) that satisfy the constraint, and calculate their profits.\n\n3. Improvise a new harmony:\n   - For each decision variable (A and B), decide whether to select a value from the harmony memory (with probability HMCR) or generate a new random value.\n   - If a value is selected from the harmony memory, decide whether to adjust it (with probability PAR) by adding or subtracting a random amount within a specified range.\n\n4. Update the harmony memory:\n   - If the new harmony's profit is better than the worst harmony in the memory, replace the worst harmony with the new one.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for NI iterations.\n\n6. Return the best solution found in the harmony memory.\n\nHere's a simplified implementation of the Harmony Search Algorithm:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef objective_function(A, B):\n    return 100 * A + 150 * B\n\ndef constraint(A, B):\n    return 2 * A + 3 * B <= 120\n\ndef generate_random_solution():\n    while True:\n        A = random.randint(0, 60)\n        B = random.randint(0, 40)\n        if constraint(A, B):\n            return (A, B)\n\ndef harmony_search(HMS, HMCR, PAR, NI):\n    harmony_memory = [generate_random_solution() for _ in range(HMS)]\n\n    for _ in range(NI):\n        new_harmony = []\n        for var in range(2):\n            if random.random() < HMCR:\n                value = random.choice(harmony_memory)[var]\n                if random.random() < PAR:\n                    value += random.randint(-5, 5)\n            else:\n                value = random.randint(0, 60 if var == 0 else 40)\n            new_harmony.append(value)\n\n        if constraint(*new_harmony) and objective_function(*new_harmony) > min(objective_function(*h) for h in harmony_memory):\n            harmony_memory.remove(min(harmony_memory, key=objective_function))\n            harmony_memory.append(new_harmony)\n\n    return max(harmony_memory, key=objective_function)\n\nbest_solution = harmony_search(10, 0.8, 0.3, 1000)\nprint(f\"Best solution: A = {best_solution[0]}, B = {best_solution[1]}, Profit = ${objective_function(*best_solution)}\")\n```\n\nThis implementation may not give the exact optimal solution due to the randomness involved, but it should provide a good approximation. Run the code multiple times to get different results and choose the best one."
