    "message_2": "First, let's prove that there exist two disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V for a topological space X that is both T4 and regular.\n\nSince X is T4, it is also T1 (T4 implies T1). Therefore, for each x in A and y in B, there exist open sets U_x containing x and V_y containing y such that U_x ∩ V_y = ∅ (this is because T1 spaces have the property that for any two distinct points, there exist disjoint open sets containing each of them).\n\nNow, consider the open cover {U_x} of A. Since X is regular, it is also normal (regularity and normality are equivalent for T1 spaces). Therefore, X has a locally finite open refinement {W_x} of {U_x}. This means that for each x in A, there exists an open set W_x containing x such that W_x ⊆ U_x, and the collection {W_x} is locally finite (i.e., every point in X has a neighborhood that intersects only finitely many W_x).\n\nSimilarly, we can find a locally finite open refinement {Z_y} of {V_y} for B.\n\nNow, let U = ⋃_{x in A} W_x and V = ⋃_{y in B} Z_y. Since A and B are disjoint, U and V are disjoint as well. Furthermore, A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V by construction.\n\nTo show that U and V are open, we need to show that they are the union of open sets. Since each W_x and Z_y are open, their unions U and V are also open. Thus, we have found disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\nNow, let's determine whether X is a T4 space for the given topology T.\n\nRecall that a space is T4 if and only if it is both T1 and normal. A space is T1 if for any two distinct points, there exist disjoint open sets containing each of them. A space is normal if for any two disjoint closed sets, there exist disjoint open sets containing each of them.\n\nLet's check if X is T1:\n\n- For points 1 and 2, we have open sets {1} and {2, 3}.\n- For points 1 and 3, we have open sets {1} and {2, 3}.\n- For points 1 and 4, we have open sets {1} and {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n- For points 2 and 3, we have open sets {2, 3} and {2, 3}.\n- For points 2 and 4, we have open sets {2, 3} and {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n- For points 3 and 4, we have open sets {2, 3} and {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nIn each case, we can find disjoint open sets containing the distinct points, so X is T1.\n\nNow let's check if X is normal. The only nontrivial closed sets in this topology are {4} and {1, 4}. Since {4} is a subset of every open set containing 1, there are no disjoint open sets containing {4} and {1, 4}. Therefore, X is not normal.\n\nSince X is not normal, it cannot be T4."
