    "message_1": "Suppose two pizza restaurants, Domino's and Pizza Hut, are competing in a market with identical pizzas. Each restaurant chooses a price for their pizza simultaneously and independently. The customer will always choose the cheaper pizza. The cost of making one pizza for both restaurants is $5. Domino's has a marginal cost of producing a pizza at $3, while Pizza Hut's marginal cost is $4. What is the Nash Equilibrium in this market and what are the profits for each pizza restaurant at equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash Equilibrium, we need to analyze the best response functions of both Domino's and Pizza Hut. Let's denote the price chosen by Domino's as P_D and the price chosen by Pizza Hut as P_H.\n\nDomino's best response function:\nIf P_D < P_H, Domino's will get all the customers and maximize its profit by setting P_D as close to P_H as possible, while still being lower. In this case, the profit for Domino's will be (P_D - $3) * Q, where Q is the quantity of pizzas sold.\nIf P_D = P_H, both restaurants will share the market, and Domino's profit will be (P_D - $3) * (Q/2).\nIf P_D > P_H, Domino's will get no customers, and its profit will be 0.\n\nPizza Hut's best response function:\nIf P_H < P_D, Pizza Hut will get all the customers and maximize its profit by setting P_H as close to P_D as possible, while still being lower. In this case, the profit for Pizza Hut will be (P_H - $4) * Q.\nIf P_H = P_D, both restaurants will share the market, and Pizza Hut's profit will be (P_H - $4) * (Q/2).\nIf P_H > P_D, Pizza Hut will get no customers, and its profit will be 0.\n\nNow, let's find the Nash Equilibrium, where both restaurants are choosing their best response given the other's choice.\n\nIf P_D = P_H, both restaurants will share the market, and their profits will be (P_D - $3) * (Q/2) for Domino's and (P_H - $4) * (Q/2) for Pizza Hut. Since both restaurants want to maximize their profits, they will set their prices as low as possible without going below their respective marginal costs.\n\nThe Nash Equilibrium occurs when P_D = P_H and both restaurants are setting their prices as low as possible without going below their marginal costs. Since Domino's has a lower marginal cost ($3) than Pizza Hut ($4), Domino's will set its price at $4, and Pizza Hut will match that price to share the market.\n\nAt the Nash Equilibrium, P_D = P_H = $4, and the profits for each restaurant are:\n\nDomino's profit: (P_D - $3) * (Q/2) = ($4 - $3) * (Q/2) = $1 * (Q/2) = Q/2\nPizza Hut's profit: (P_H - $4) * (Q/2) = ($4 - $4) * (Q/2) = $0 * (Q/2) = 0\n\nSo, at the Nash Equilibrium, Domino's makes a profit of Q/2, while Pizza Hut makes no profit."
