    "message_2": "To calculate the value of the call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we also need the stock's volatility (standard deviation of the stock's returns). Let's assume the volatility is 30% per year.\n\nThe Black-Scholes equation for the call option value (C) is:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nS = current stock price ($50)\nX = strike price ($60)\nr = risk-free interest rate (0.03)\nT = time to maturity (0.5 years, since it's 6 months)\nN(x) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nd1 and d2 are calculated as follows:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nwhere:\nσ = stock's volatility (0.3)\nln(x) = natural logarithm of x\nsqrt(x) = square root of x\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(50/60) + (0.03 + (0.3^2)/2) * 0.5) / (0.3 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 = (-0.1823 + (0.03 + 0.045) * 0.5) / (0.3 * 0.7071)\nd1 = (-0.1823 + 0.0375) / 0.2121\nd1 = -0.6828\n\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\nd2 = -0.6828 - 0.3 * 0.7071\nd2 = -0.6828 - 0.2121\nd2 = -0.8949\n\nNext, we need to find the values of N(d1) and N(d2). Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we get:\n\nN(-0.6828) = 0.2475\nN(-0.8949) = 0.1856\n\nNow, we can calculate the call option value:\n\nC = 50 * 0.2475 - 60 * e^(-0.03 * 0.5) * 0.1856\nC = 12.375 - 60 * 0.9851 * 0.1856\nC = 12.375 - 10.936\nC = 1.439\n\nSo, the value of the corresponding call option is approximately $1.44."
