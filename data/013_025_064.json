    "message_1": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, two travelers with identical antique pottery arrive at the airport baggage claim. The airline has damaged both pots and each traveler must fill out a claim form indicating the value of the item. The catch is that the airline will only compensate each traveler the lesser of the two values indicated on the forms. Assuming the value of the pot is an integer between 2 and 100, what is the Nash equilibrium for this game?",
    "message_2": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, the Nash equilibrium occurs when both travelers choose the lowest possible value for their pots, which in this case is 2. \n\nHere's why: If both travelers choose the same value, they will both receive that value as compensation. However, if one traveler chooses a higher value, they risk receiving the lower value chosen by the other traveler. Therefore, each traveler has an incentive to choose a value slightly lower than the other traveler to ensure they receive compensation. This process continues until both travelers reach the lowest possible value, which is 2 in this case. \n\nAt this point, neither traveler has an incentive to change their strategy, as choosing a higher value would not result in a higher compensation. Thus, the Nash equilibrium is when both travelers choose the value of 2."
