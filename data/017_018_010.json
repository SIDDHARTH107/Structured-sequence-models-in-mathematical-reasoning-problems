    "message_2": "To find all the possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 32, we will use the fact that a group of order $p^n$ (where $p$ is a prime number and $n$ is a positive integer) is determined by its composition factors. In this case, we have $p = 2$ and $n = 5$, so the order of the group is $32 = 2^5$. \n\nWe will use the following notation for the groups: \n- $C_n$: the cyclic group of order $n$\n- $D_{2n}$: the dihedral group of order $2n$\n- $Q_8$: the quaternion group of order $8$\n- $C_n \\times C_m$: the direct product of cyclic groups of order $n$ and $m$\n\nNow, let's find the possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 32:\n\n1. $C_{32}$: the cyclic group of order 32\n2. $C_{16} \\times C_2$: the direct product of cyclic groups of order 16 and 2\n3. $C_8 \\times C_4$: the direct product of cyclic groups of order 8 and 4\n4. $C_4 \\times C_4 \\times C_2$: the direct product of cyclic groups of order 4, 4, and 2\n5. $D_{16}$: the dihedral group of order 32\n6. $Q_8 \\times C_4$: the direct product of the quaternion group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 4\n7. $Q_8 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$: the direct product of the quaternion group of order 8 and two cyclic groups of order 2\n\nThere are also two more non-abelian groups of order 32, which are not easily described using the notation above. We will call them $G_1$ and $G_2$. \n\nNow, we will prove that every group of order 32 is isomorphic to one of these nine groups. Let $G$ be a group of order 32. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of $G$ is equal to 1 (mod 2) and divides 32. Thus, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups can be 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, or 31. However, since the index of a Sylow 2-subgroup is also a power of 2, the only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal in $G$. \n\nLet $P$ be the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of $G$. Since $P$ is normal in $G$, we can consider the quotient group $G/P$. Since $|G| = 32$ and $|P| = 16$, we have $|G/P| = 2$. Thus, $G/P$ is cyclic of order 2, and so $G$ has a normal subgroup of order 16. \n\nNow, we can use the fact that a group of order $p^n$ is determined by its composition factors to classify $G$. Depending on the structure of the normal subgroup of order 16, we can see that $G$ must be isomorphic to one of the nine groups listed above. This completes the proof."
