    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. A maximum independent set is an independent set of the largest possible size.\n\nIn the given graph, we can find a maximum independent set by selecting the following vertices: {A, D, G, H}. This set has 4 vertices, and no two vertices are adjacent. \n\nThere is no independent set with more than 4 vertices in this graph, so the maximum independent set is {A, D, G, H}."
