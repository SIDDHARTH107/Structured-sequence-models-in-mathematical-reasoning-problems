    "message_2": "To solve the equation tan x = 1/3 for 0 < x < 360, we need to find the angles x in the specified range that have a tangent value of 1/3.\n\nStep 1: Find the reference angle\nWe can start by finding the reference angle (the angle in the first quadrant) that has a tangent value of 1/3. We can use the inverse tangent function (arctan) to do this:\n\nreference angle = arctan(1/3)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nreference angle ≈ 18.43°\n\nStep 2: Find the angles in the specified range\nNow we need to find the angles in the specified range (0 < x < 360) that have the same tangent value as the reference angle. Since the tangent function is positive in both the first and third quadrants, we can find the angles in these quadrants:\n\nAngle in the first quadrant: x = reference angle\nx ≈ 18.43°\n\nAngle in the third quadrant: x = 180 + reference angle\nx ≈ 180 + 18.43\nx ≈ 198.43°\n\nSo, the two angles x in the specified range that have a tangent value of 1/3 are approximately 18.43° and 198.43°."
