    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we need to add the lengths of all three sides. Since we already know the lengths of all three sides, we don't actually need to use trigonometry to find the perimeter. \n\nPerimeter = side1 + side2 + side3\nPerimeter = 6 cm + 8 cm + 10 cm\nPerimeter = 24 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is 24 cm."
