    "message_2": "To find the maximal amplitude of the forced van der Pol oscillator, we first need to write down its equation of motion. The equation for a forced van der Pol oscillator is given by:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} - \\mu(1 - x^2)\\dot{x} + \\omega_0^2 x = F \\cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nwhere $x(t)$ is the displacement, $\\mu$ is the damping parameter, $\\omega_0$ is the natural frequency, $F$ is the forcing strength, and $\\omega$ is the driving frequency.\n\nFor the given problem, we have $\\mu = 2$, $\\omega_0 = 1$, $F = 1.5$, and $\\omega = 0.8$. To find the maximal amplitude, we need to find the steady-state solution of the oscillator. In the steady-state, the displacement $x(t)$ can be written as:\n\n$$x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta)$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude and $\\delta$ is the phase shift. Substituting this into the equation of motion and using the trigonometric identities, we get:\n\n$$(-\\omega^2 A + \\omega_0^2 A) \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta) - 2\\mu\\omega A \\sin(\\omega t - \\delta) = F \\cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nComparing the coefficients of $\\cos(\\omega t)$ and $\\sin(\\omega t)$, we get two equations:\n\n$$-\\omega^2 A + \\omega_0^2 A = F$$\n$$-2\\mu\\omega A = 0$$\n\nThe second equation gives us that either $A = 0$ or $\\mu = 0$. Since we are given $\\mu = 2$, the amplitude $A$ must be nonzero. Solving the first equation for $A$, we get:\n\n$$A(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2) = F$$\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\n$$A(1^2 - 0.8^2) = 1.5$$\n$$A(1 - 0.64) = 1.5$$\n$$A(0.36) = 1.5$$\n\nSolving for $A$, we get:\n\n$$A = \\frac{1.5}{0.36} \\approx 4.167$$\n\nTherefore, the maximal amplitude achieved by the forced van der Pol oscillator with the given parameters is approximately $4.167$."
