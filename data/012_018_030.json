    "message_2": "To disconnect the graph G, we need to remove enough edges such that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we need to create at least two separate components in the graph.\n\nA connected graph with n vertices has a minimum of n-1 edges. Therefore, to create two separate components, we need to have at least 7 edges in one component and at least 1 edge in the other component.\n\nSince the graph G has 12 edges, we can calculate the minimum number of edges that need to be removed as follows:\n\nMinimum edges to remove = Total edges - (Edges in first component + Edges in second component)\n= 12 - (7 + 1)\n= 12 - 8\n= 4\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed in order to disconnect the graph is 4."
