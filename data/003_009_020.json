    "message_2": "In a right triangle, the sum of the other two angles is 90 degrees. Since one angle is 60 degrees, the other angle must be 30 degrees. This is a 30-60-90 right triangle. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side lengths have a specific ratio: the side opposite the 30-degree angle is half the length of the hypotenuse, and the side opposite the 60-degree angle is the length of the 30-degree side times the square root of 3.\n\nLet's find the side lengths:\n1. Side opposite the 30-degree angle (shorter leg): 10 cm / 2 = 5 cm\n2. Side opposite the 60-degree angle (longer leg): 5 cm * √3 ≈ 8.66 cm\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter by adding the side lengths:\nPerimeter = 5 cm + 8.66 cm + 10 cm ≈ 23.66 cm"
