    "message_2": "To analyze the stability of the spring-mass system using Fourier analysis, we first need to find the equation of motion for the system. The equation of motion for a spring-mass system is given by Hooke's law:\n\nm * a = -k * x\n\nwhere m is the mass (3 kg), a is the acceleration, k is the spring constant (10 N/m), and x is the displacement.\n\nThe acceleration is the second derivative of displacement with respect to time, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nm * (d^2x/dt^2) = -k * x\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for m and k:\n\n3 * (d^2x/dt^2) = -10 * x\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation, which has the general solution:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ω * t) + B * sin(ω * t)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and ω is the angular frequency, which can be found using the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nPlugging in the values for k and m:\n\nω = sqrt(10/3)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants A and B using the initial conditions. The initial displacement is 5 cm (0.05 m), and the initial velocity is 2 m/s. Using these initial conditions:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(0) + B * sin(0) = 0.05\nv(0) = -A * ω * sin(0) + B * ω * cos(0) = 2\n\nFrom the first equation, we get A = 0.05. From the second equation, we get B = 2/ω. So, the equation of motion for the system is:\n\nx(t) = 0.05 * cos(ω * t) + (2/ω) * sin(ω * t)\n\nNow, we can use Fourier analysis to determine the stability of the system. However, it's important to note that Fourier analysis is typically used for non-periodic or non-linear systems. In this case, the spring-mass system is linear and has a periodic solution, so the stability can be directly inferred from the equation of motion.\n\nSince the equation of motion has a sinusoidal form with constant amplitude, the system is stable. The displacement will oscillate with a constant amplitude, and there will be no exponential growth or decay in the system's response."
