    "message_2": "First, let's define the universal set U, which contains all the elements in A and B. For simplicity, let's assume U = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Now we can find the complements of A and B:\n\nComplement of A = A' = {3, 4}\nComplement of B = B' = {1, 2}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n1. A x (complement of B) = A x B' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}\n2. (Complement of A) x (Complement of B) = A' x B' = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n3.
