    "message_2": "To solve the given trigonometric equation, we can treat it as a quadratic equation in terms of sin(x). Let y = sin(x), then the equation becomes:\n\n2y^2 - 3y + 1 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor this quadratic equation:\n\n(2y - 1)(y - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for y:\n\n1) 2y - 1 = 0 => y = 1/2\n2) y - 1 = 0 => y = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding values of x for each solution of y:\n\n1) sin(x) = 1/2\nThe values of x that satisfy this equation in the interval [0, 2π] are x = π/6 and x = 5π/6.\n\n2) sin(x) = 1\nThe value of x that satisfies this equation in the interval [0, 2π] is x = π/2.\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the given interval are x = π/6, x = 5π/6, and x = π/2."
