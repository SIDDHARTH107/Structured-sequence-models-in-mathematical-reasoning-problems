    "message_2": "We will first prove the general statement and then verify the specific case of a smooth cubic surface in projective 3-space.\n\nLet X be a Fano variety in projective space with degree d. We want to show that the dimension of the vector space of global sections of the anti-canonical bundle of X is at least (d-1)^2 + 1.\n\nRecall that the anti-canonical bundle of X is given by the dual of the canonical bundle, i.e., K_X^(-1). Since X is a Fano variety, the anti-canonical bundle is ample. Let L = K_X^(-1).\n\nBy the Riemann-Roch theorem for smooth projective varieties, we have:\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) + h^2(X, L) = χ(X, L) = deg(L) + 1,\n\nwhere h^i(X, L) denotes the dimension of the i-th cohomology group of L, and χ(X, L) is the Euler characteristic of L.\n\nSince L is ample, by the Kodaira vanishing theorem, we have h^i(X, L) = 0 for all i > 0. Therefore, h^0(X, L) = deg(L) + 1.\n\nNow, we know that the degree of X is d, and the degree of L is given by the intersection number L^n, where n is the dimension of X. Since X is a Fano variety, we have L^n = d. Thus, deg(L) = d.\n\nFinally, we have h^0(X, L) = deg(L) + 1 = d + 1. Since d ≥ 2 (as X is a Fano variety), we have h^0(X, L) ≥ (d-1)^2 + 1.\n\nNow, let's verify the specific case of a smooth cubic surface in projective 3-space. In this case, X is a degree 3 Fano variety, so d = 3. By the general result above, we have:\n\nh^0(X, L) ≥ (3-1)^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nHowever, for a smooth cubic surface in projective 3-space, it is well-known that the dimension of the vector space of global sections of the anti-canonical bundle is actually 20. This can be computed explicitly using the adjunction formula and the fact that the canonical bundle of projective 3-space is O(-4). In this case, the anti-canonical bundle is given by O(4), and the global sections correspond to the homogeneous polynomials of degree 4 in the coordinates of projective 3-space. There are 5 choose 4 = 5 ways to choose 4 coordinates from 5 (including the homogeneous coordinate), so the dimension of the vector space of global sections is 5^2 = 20.\n\nThus, the general result holds for the specific case of a smooth cubic surface in projective 3-space, with the dimension of the vector space of global sections of the anti-canonical bundle being 20."
