    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √(24), we need to find the prime factors of 24 and look for any pairs of the same factor.\n\n24 can be factored into 2 × 12, and then 12 can be further factored into 2 × 6, and finally, 6 can be factored into 2 × 3. So, the prime factorization of 24 is 2 × 2 × 2 × 3.\n\nNow, we can group the factors into pairs: (2 × 2) × 2 × 3. We have one pair of 2s, so we can take it out of the square root.\n\n√(24) = √((2 × 2) × 2 × 3) = 2√(2 × 3) = 2√(6)\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is 2√(6)."
