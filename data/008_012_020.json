    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to represent the system in matrix form:\n\nAX = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x and y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2 |\n    | 3 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 5 |\n    | 2 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (A^(-1)). To do this, we first find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = (1 * -5) - (2 * 3) = -5 - 6 = -11\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere adj(A) is the adjugate of A. The adjugate of A is found by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements:\n\nadj(A) = | -5 -2 |\n         | -3  1 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (-1/-11) * | -5 -2 |\n                     | -3  1 |\n\nA^(-1) = (1/11) * | -5 -2 |\n                  | -3  1 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 5/11  2/11 |\n         | 3/11 -1/11 |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = |  5/11  2/11 | * | 5 |\n    |  3/11 -1/11 |   | 2 |\n\nMultiplying the matrices, we get:\n\nX = | (5/11 * 5) + (2/11 * 2) |\n    | (3/11 * 5) - (1/11 * 2) |\n\nX = | 25/11 + 4/11 |\n    | 15/11 - 2/11 |\n\nX = | 29/11 |\n    | 13/11 |\n\nSo, the values of x and y are:\n\nx = 29/11\ny = 13/11"
