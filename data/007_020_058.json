    "message_2": "To encrypt the message M = 17 using RSA encryption, Alice needs to compute the ciphertext C using the public key (e, n) = (7, 55). The encryption formula is:\n\nC ≡ M^e (mod n)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nC ≡ 17^7 (mod 55)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 17^7:\n\n17^7 = 410338673\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when this number is divided by 55:\n\nC ≡ 410338673 (mod 55)\nC = 410338673 % 55\nC = 8\n\nSo, the encrypted message that Alice should send to Bob is C = 8."
