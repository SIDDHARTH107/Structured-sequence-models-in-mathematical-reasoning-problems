    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |2x - 4| = 6, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 4 = 6\nIn this case, we can solve for x as follows:\n2x - 4 + 4 = 6 + 4\n2x = 10\nx = 10/2\nx = 5\n\nCase 2: 2x - 4 = -6\nIn this case, we can solve for x as follows:\n2x - 4 + 4 = -6 + 4\n2x = -2\nx = -2/2\nx = -1\n\nSo, the solutions for the absolute value equation |2x - 4| = 6 are x = 5 and x = -1."
