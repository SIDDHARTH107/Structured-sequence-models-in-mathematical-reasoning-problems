    "message_2": "A complete graph with 6 vertices is denoted as K6. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nTo calculate the total number of paths of length 3 starting from a given vertex, we can break it down into steps:\n\n1. Choose the first edge: Since the graph is complete, there are 5 other vertices to choose from for the first edge. So, there are 5 choices for the first edge.\n\n2. Choose the second edge: After choosing the first edge, there are 4 remaining vertices to choose from for the second edge (since we cannot go back to the starting vertex in a path). So, there are 4 choices for the second edge.\n\n3. Choose the third edge: After choosing the second edge, there are 3 remaining vertices to choose from for the third edge (again, we cannot go back to the starting vertex or the vertex of the second edge). So, there are 3 choices for the third edge.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of choices for each edge to get the total number of paths of length 3 starting from a given vertex:\n\nTotal paths = 5 choices (first edge) × 4 choices (second edge) × 3 choices (third edge) = 5 × 4 × 3 = 60 paths."
