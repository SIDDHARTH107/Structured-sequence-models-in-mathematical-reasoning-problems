    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(z) = z^3 - 4z^2 + 6z - 5, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that the derivative of z^n, where n is a constant, is n * z^(n-1).\n\nSo, the derivative of f(z) with respect to z, denoted as f'(z), is:\n\nf'(z) = d/dz (z^3 - 4z^2 + 6z - 5)\nf'(z) = 3z^2 - 8z + 6\n\nNow, we will evaluate f'(z) at z = 2i:\n\nf'(2i) = 3(2i)^2 - 8(2i) + 6\nf'(2i) = 3(-4) - 16i + 6\nf'(2i) = -12 - 16i + 6\nf'(2i) = -6 - 16i\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(z) = z^3 - 4z^2 + 6z - 5 evaluated at z = 2i is f'(2i) = -6 - 16i."
