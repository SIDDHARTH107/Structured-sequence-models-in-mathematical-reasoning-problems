    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using a Vigenere cipher with the secret key \"MATH\", we first need to repeat the key to match the length of the message. In this case, the repeated key is \"MATHM\".\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere square to encrypt each letter of the message. The Vigenere square is a 26x26 table of letters, where each row is shifted one position to the left compared to the previous row. The first row starts with the alphabet (A-Z), and the last row ends with the alphabet (Z-A).\n\nTo encrypt, we find the intersection of the row corresponding to the letter in the key and the column corresponding to the letter in the message.\n\n1. H (from key M) and H (from message HELLO) -> intersection is Z\n2. E (from key A) and E (from message HELLO) -> intersection is E\n3. L (from key T) and L (from message HELLO) -> intersection is O\n4. L (from key H) and L (from message HELLO) -> intersection is S\n5. O (from key M) and O (from message HELLO) -> intersection is B\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"ZEOSB\"."
