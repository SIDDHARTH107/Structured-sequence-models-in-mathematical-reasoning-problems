    "message_2": "According to the Goldbach Conjecture, every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. This conjecture has been tested extensively for even integers up to very large values, and it holds true for all tested cases. However, it has not been proven or disproven for all even integers.\n\nAs a mathematician, I cannot provide a smallest even integer greater than 2 that cannot be written as the sum of two prime numbers, as it would contradict the Goldbach Conjecture, which is still an open question in mathematics."
