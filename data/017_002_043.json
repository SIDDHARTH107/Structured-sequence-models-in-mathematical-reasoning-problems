For each divisor d, there exists a unique subgroup of G of order d, which is generated by the element a^(15/d).\n\n1. For d = 1, the subgroup is {e}, where e is the identity element of G. This subgroup is cyclic since it has only one element.\n\n2. For d = 3, the subgroup is generated by the element a^5, i.e., H_3 = <a^5> = {e, a^5, (a^5)^2 = a^10}. This subgroup is cyclic since it is generated by a single element a^5.\n\n3. For d = 5, the subgroup is generated by the element a^3, i.e., H_5 = <a^3> = {e, a^3, (a^3)^2 = a^6, (a^3)^3 = a^9, (a^3)^4 = a^12}. This subgroup is cyclic since it is generated by a single element a^3.\n\n4. For d = 15, the subgroup is G itself, i.e., H_15 = <a> = {e, a, a^2, ..., a^14}. This subgroup is cyclic since it is generated by a single element a.\n\nNow, we will prove that every subgroup of G is cyclic. Let H be an arbitrary subgroup of G. Since G is a cyclic group of order 15, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of H must be a divisor of 15. As we have already found all the subgroups of G corresponding to each divisor of 15, and each of these subgroups is cyclic, it follows that every subgroup of G is cyclic."
