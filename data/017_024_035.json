    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C96, the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, or one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96, we will analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 96, which can be factored as 2^5 * 3. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n2. n_3 divides 2^5 and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nFrom condition 1, n_2 can be 1 or 3. From condition 2, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 16.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 32 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are normal in G. The order of the product P_2P_3 is |P_2| * |P_3| / |P_2 ∩ P_3| = 32 * 3 / 1 = 96. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3.\n\nSince P_2 is a 2-group of order 32, it can be either cyclic (C32) or a non-abelian group. If P_2 is cyclic, then G is isomorphic to C32 × C3, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C96. If P_2 is non-abelian, then G is isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since P_3 is unique and normal in G, we can consider the semidirect product of a Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and P_3. Depending on the choice of P_2 and the action of P_3 on P_2, G can be isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4 or 16\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 32 and multiple Sylow 3-subgroups. We can consider the semidirect product of P_2 and a Sylow 3-subgroup P_3. Depending on the choice of P_2 and the action of P_3 on P_2, G can be isomorphic to one of the non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C96, the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2 (which is one of the non-abelian groups of order 96), or one of the other 195 non-abelian groups of order 96. To determine the specific isomorphism type of G, more information about the structure of G or its subgroups is needed."
