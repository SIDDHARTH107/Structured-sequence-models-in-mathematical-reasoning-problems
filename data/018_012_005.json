To do this, we need to show that (A × B) ∩ A ≠ A × (B ∩ A) and (B × A) ∩ A ≠ B × (A ∩ A).\n\nFirst, let's find B ∩ A and A ∩ A:\n\nB ∩ A = {2}\nA ∩ A = A = {1, 2}\n\nNow, let's find A × (B ∩ A) and B × (A ∩ A):\n\nA × (B ∩ A) = A × {2} = {(1, 2), (2, 2)}\nB × (A ∩ A) = B × A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare the results:\n\n(A × B) ∩ A = ∅ ≠ A × (B ∩ A) = {(1, 2), (2, 2)}\n(B × A) ∩ A = ∅ ≠ B × (A ∩ A) = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nSince (A × B) ∩ A ≠ A × (B ∩ A) and (B × A) ∩ A ≠ B × (A ∩ A), we have proven that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
