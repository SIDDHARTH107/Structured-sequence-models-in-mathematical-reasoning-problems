    "message_2": "To solve the homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the system in matrix form:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 3 -1  4 | 0 ]\n[ 2  3 -2 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the x terms in the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we can subtract 3 times the first row from the second row and subtract 2 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -7  7 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -1  0 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -7:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -1  0 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the y terms in the first and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we can subtract 2 times the second row from the first row and add the second row to the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0 -1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Multiply the third row by -1:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 5: Eliminate the z term in the first and second rows.\n\nTo do this, we can subtract the third row from the first row and add the third row to the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1  0  0 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1  0 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nThe resulting matrix corresponds to the system of equations:\n\nx = 0\ny = 0\nz = 0\n\nSo, the solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
