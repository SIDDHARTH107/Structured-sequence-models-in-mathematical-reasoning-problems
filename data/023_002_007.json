    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π], we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n.\n\nThe formulas for a_n and b_n are:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx, for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx, for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSince f(x) = x is an odd function, all the a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to compute the b_n coefficients.\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx\n\nTo compute the integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(nx) - ∫ (-1/n) * cos(nx) dx] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(nx) + (1/n^2) * sin(nx)] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/n^2) * sin(nπ) - (1/n^2) * sin(-nπ)] = 0 (since sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n)\n\nHowever, we made an error in the integration by parts. We should have used:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1/n) * cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(nx) + ∫ (1/n) * cos(nx) dx] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(nx) + (1/n^2) * sin(nx)] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-π/n) * cos(nπ) - (-π/n) * cos(-nπ)]\n\nb_n = { (2/π) * (1/n) if n is odd, 0 if n is even }\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x is:\n\nf(x) = ∑[(2/π) * (1/n) * sin(nx)] for odd n\n\nNow, let's determine if the Fourier series converges pointwise at x = 0 and uniformly on [-π, π].\n\nAt x = 0, the Fourier series becomes:\n\nf(0) = ∑[(2/π) * (1/n) * sin(0)] = 0\n\nSince f(0) = 0, the Fourier series converges pointwise at x = 0.\n\nTo check for uniform convergence, we can use the Dirichlet's criterion. Since f(x) = x is piecewise continuous and has a piecewise continuous derivative on the interval [-π, π], the Fourier series converges uniformly on [-π, π]."
