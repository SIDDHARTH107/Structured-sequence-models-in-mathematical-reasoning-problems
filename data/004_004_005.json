    "message_2": "To find the area underneath the curve f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 1 between the bounds x = 0 and x = 4, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given bounds.\n\nThe integral of f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 1 is:\n\nâˆ«(x^2 - 3x + 1)dx = (1/3)x^3 - (3/2)x^2 + x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the bounds x = 0 and x = 4:\n\nF(4) = (1/3)(4)^3 - (3/2)(4)^2 + (4)\nF(0) = (1/3)(0)^3 - (3/2)(0)^2 + (0)\n\nF(4) = (1/3)(64) - (3/2)(16) + 4 = 64/3 - 24 + 4\nF(0) = 0\n\nNow, subtract F(0) from F(4) to find the area underneath the curve:\n\nArea = F(4) - F(0) = (64/3 - 24 + 4) - 0 = (64/3 - 72/3 + 12/3) = (-8/3)\n\nHowever, since the area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nArea = |-8/3| = 8/3\n\nSo, the area underneath the curve f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 1 between the bounds x = 0 and x = 4 is 8/3 square units."
