    "message_1": "A crate of mass 20 kg is pulled up a ramp that is 5 meters long and inclined at an angle of 30 degrees. A force of 100 N is applied to the crate to drag it up the ramp. Find the work done by the force in pulling the crate up the ramp.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force in pulling the crate up the ramp, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = Force x Distance x cos(theta)\n\nwhere Force is the applied force (100 N), Distance is the length of the ramp (5 meters), and theta is the angle between the force and the direction of motion (30 degrees).\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of the angle:\n\ncos(30) = 0.866\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nWork = 100 N x 5 meters x 0.866\n\nWork = 500 x 0.866\n\nWork = 433 Nm\n\nSo, the work done by the force in pulling the crate up the ramp is 433 Nm (Newton meters)."
