    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2, we will apply the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nFor our function, we have three terms: 3x^2, 5x, and -2.\n\n1. Differentiating 3x^2:\n   Using the power rule, we get (2) * 3x^(2-1) = 6x.\n\n2. Differentiating 5x:\n   Using the power rule, we get (1) * 5x^(1-1) = 5.\n\n3. Differentiating -2 (constant term):\n   The derivative of a constant is 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 5\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2 is f'(x) = 6x + 5."
