    "message_2": "To find the polynomial of degree 3 that passes through the given data points using Lagrange interpolation, we can use the formula:\n\nP(x) = L_0(x) * y_0 + L_1(x) * y_1 + L_2(x) * y_2 + L_3(x) * y_3\n\nwhere L_i(x) are the Lagrange basis polynomials and y_i are the y-values of the given data points.\n\nThe Lagrange basis polynomials are defined as:\n\nL_i(x) = Π((x - x_j) / (x_i - x_j)) for j ≠ i\n\nFor the given data points (1, 4), (2, 7), (3, 11), and (4, 16), we can calculate the Lagrange basis polynomials as follows:\n\nL_0(x) = ((x - 2) * (x - 3) * (x - 4)) / ((1 - 2) * (1 - 3) * (1 - 4)) = (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) / 6\n\nL_1(x) = ((x - 1) * (x - 3) * (x - 4)) / ((2 - 1) * (2 - 3) * (2 - 4)) = (x - 1)(x - 3)(x - 4) / -2\n\nL_2(x) = ((x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 4)) / ((3 - 1) * (3 - 2) * (3 - 4)) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 4) / 2\n\nL_3(x) = ((x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3)) / ((4 - 1) * (4 - 2) * (4 - 3)) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) / 6\n\nNow, we can find the polynomial P(x) by plugging in the y-values:\n\nP(x) = 4L_0(x) + 7L_1(x) + 11L_2(x) + 16L_3(x)\n\nTo estimate the value at x = 2.5, we can plug in x = 2.5 into the polynomial P(x):\n\nP(2.5) = 4L_0(2.5) + 7L_1(2.5) + 11L_2(2.5) + 16L_3(2.5)\n\nCalculating the values of the Lagrange basis polynomials at x = 2.5:\n\nL_0(2.5) = (0.5)(-0.5)(-1.5) / 6 = 0.25\nL_1(2.5) = (1.5)(-0.5)(-1.5) / -2 = -1.125\nL_2(2.5) = (1.5)(0.5)(-1.5) / 2 = -0.375\nL_3(2.5) = (1.5)(0.5)(-0.5) / 6 = -0.125\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into P(2.5):\n\nP(2.5) = 4(0.25) + 7(-1.125) + 11(-0.375) + 16(-0.125) = 1 - 7.875 - 4.125 - 2 = -13\n\nSo, the estimated value at x = 2.5 is -13."
