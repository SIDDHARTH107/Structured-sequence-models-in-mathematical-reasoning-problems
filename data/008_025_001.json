    "message_2": "First, we can try to solve this system of linear equations using the substitution method. Let's solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 7 - 2y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n3(7 - 2y) + 6y = 21\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n21 - 6y + 6y = 21\n\nAs we can see, the y terms cancel each other out, and we are left with:\n\n21 = 21\n\nSince this statement is always true, it means that the two equations are dependent and have infinitely many solutions. The system is consistent, and the equations represent the same line in the coordinate plane."
