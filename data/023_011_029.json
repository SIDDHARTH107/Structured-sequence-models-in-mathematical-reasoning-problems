    "message_2": "The given voltage signal V(t) is already in the form of a sum of sinusoidal functions, so we don't need to use the Fourier transform to find the amplitude and frequency of each constituent wave. The Fourier transform is used to convert a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation, but in this case, the signal is already given in terms of its frequency components.\n\nThe given voltage signal is:\n\nV(t) = 5 + 8cos(100πt) + 4cos(300πt) + 2cos(500πt)\n\nWe can directly read the amplitude and frequency of each constituent wave from this equation:\n\n1. The first wave has an amplitude of 8 and a frequency of 100π rad/s or 50 Hz (since frequency in Hz = (angular frequency in rad/s) / (2π)).\n2. The second wave has an amplitude of 4 and a frequency of 300π rad/s or 150 Hz.\n3. The third wave has an amplitude of 2 and a frequency of 500π rad/s or 250 Hz.\n\nSo, the amplitudes and frequencies of the constituent waves are:\n\n1. Amplitude: 8, Frequency: 50 Hz\n2. Amplitude: 4, Frequency: 150 Hz\n3. Amplitude: 2, Frequency: 250 Hz"
