    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, students getting an A grade) out of n trials (students)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, a student getting an A grade)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of students)\n- k is the number of successes we want to find the probability for (in this case, 10 students getting an A grade)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 50 (number of students)\n- k = 10 (number of students we want to get an A grade)\n- p = 0.2 (probability of a student getting an A grade)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(50, 10), which is the number of combinations of 50 students taken 10 at a time:\n\nC(50, 10) = 50! / (10! * (50-10)!)\nC(50, 10) = 50! / (10! * 40!)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 10) = C(50, 10) * 0.2^10 * (1-0.2)^(50-10)\nP(X = 10) = C(50, 10) * 0.2^10 * 0.8^40\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nC(50, 10) = 10272278170\n0.2^10 = 0.0000001024\n0.8^40 = 0.00033554432\n\nNow, multiply these values together:\n\nP(X = 10) = 10272278170 * 0.0000001024 * 0.00033554432\nP(X = 10) â‰ˆ 0.0353\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 10 students out of 50 will score an A grade in the math exam is approximately 0.0353 or 3.53%."
