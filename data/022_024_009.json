Suppose the temperature satisfies the following heat equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = k(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nwhere k is the thermal diffusivity coefficient of the solid.\n\nIf the boundary condition is given by:\n\nu(x,y,0) = sin(πx)sin(πy) \n\nand \n\nu(0,y,t) = u(1,y,t) = u(x,0,t) = u(x,1,t) = 0 \n\nfor all t > 0, find u(x,y,t) at x = 0.5, y = 0.5, and t = 0.1 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = k(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y))T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by kXYT, we obtain:\n\nT'(t) / (kT(t)) = (X''(x) / X(x)) + (Y''(y) / Y(y))\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / (kT(t)) = -λ\nX''(x) / X(x) + Y''(y) / Y(y) = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) = -λX(x)\nY''(y) = (λ - μ)Y(y)\n\nwith boundary conditions X(0) = X(1) = 0 and Y(0) = Y(1) = 0. The solutions to these equations are:\n\nX(x) = sin(nπx), where n is an integer\nY(y) = sin(mπy), where m is an integer\n\nand λ = n²π², μ = m²π². The general solution to the heat equation is then:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑∑A_nm sin(nπx) sin(mπy) e^(-k(n²+m²)π²t)\n\nwhere A_nm are constants determined by the initial condition:\n\nu(x, y, 0) = sin(πx) sin(πy) = ∑∑A_nm sin(nπx) sin(mπy)\n\nComparing the initial condition to the general solution, we see that A_11 = 1 and all other A_nm = 0. Thus, the solution is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = sin(πx) sin(πy) e^(-2kπ²t)\n\nNow we can find u(0.5, 0.5, 0.1) by plugging in the values:\n\nu(0.5, 0.5, 0.1) = sin(π(0.5)) sin(π(0.5)) e^(-2kπ²(0.1))\n\nu(0.5, 0.5, 0.1) = (1/2)(1/2)e^(-0.2kπ²) = (1/4)e^(-0.2kπ²)"
