    "message_2": "To find the period of the signal in the time domain, we need to identify the fundamental frequency of the signal. The fundamental frequency is the smallest frequency that is present in the signal, and it can be found by looking at the Dirac delta functions in the Fourier transform.\n\nIn the given Fourier transform, we have three Dirac delta functions:\n\n1. δ(ω - 2π)\n2. δ(ω - 5π/3)\n3. δ(ω - 7π/3)\n\nThe corresponding frequencies are:\n\n1. ω1 = 2π\n2. ω2 = 5π/3\n3. ω3 = 7π/3\n\nThe fundamental frequency is the smallest of these frequencies:\n\nω0 = min(ω1, ω2, ω3) = 2π\n\nNow, we can find the period of the signal in the time domain using the relation:\n\nT = 2π / ω0 = 2π / (2π) = 1\n\nSo, the period of the signal in the time domain is T = 1.\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier series of the signal. The Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(t) = Σ [Cn * exp(jnω0t)]\n\nwhere Cn are the Fourier coefficients, and ω0 is the fundamental frequency.\n\nFrom the given Fourier transform, we can identify the Fourier coefficients:\n\nC1 = 2\nC2 = 3cos(3ω) = 3cos(6π)\nC3 = -4i sin(3ω) = -4i sin(6π)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series as:\n\nf(t) = 2 * exp(j2πt) + 3cos(6π) * exp(j5π/3t) - 4i sin(6π) * exp(j7π/3t)\n\nSince cos(6π) = 1 and sin(6π) = 0, the Fourier series simplifies to:\n\nf(t) = 2 * exp(j2πt) + 3 * exp(j5π/3t)\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the signal in the time domain. To plot the Fourier series, you can use any mathematical software or online tool that supports complex exponential functions."
