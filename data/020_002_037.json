    "message_2": "To solve this nonlinear programming problem, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, let's define the constraint function g(x, y) and the Lagrangian function L(x, y, λ):\n\ng(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 25\nL(x, y, λ) = 2x + y + λ(x^2 + y^2 - 25)\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of L(x, y, λ) and set it equal to zero:\n\n∇L(x, y, λ) = (dL/dx, dL/dy, dL/dλ) = (2 + 2λx, 1 + 2λy, x^2 + y^2 - 25)\n\nSetting the gradient equal to zero, we get the following system of equations:\n\n1) 2 + 2λx = 0\n2) 1 + 2λy = 0\n3) x^2 + y^2 = 25\n\nFrom equations (1) and (2), we can express λ in terms of x and y:\n\nλ = -1/(2x) and λ = -1/(2y)\n\nSince both expressions are equal to λ, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n-1/(2x) = -1/(2y)\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\ny = x\n\nNow, we can substitute y = x into equation (3):\n\nx^2 + x^2 = 25\n2x^2 = 25\nx^2 = 25/2\nx = ±√(25/2)\n\nSince y = x, we have two possible solutions for (x, y):\n\n(x, y) = (√(25/2), √(25/2)) and (x, y) = (-√(25/2), -√(25/2))\n\nNow, we need to determine which solution maximizes the objective function f(x, y) = 2x + y:\n\nf(√(25/2), √(25/2)) = 2√(25/2) + √(25/2) = 3√(25/2)\nf(-√(25/2), -√(25/2)) = -2√(25/2) - √(25/2) = -3√(25/2)\n\nSince 3√(25/2) > -3√(25/2), the maximum value of f(x, y) is 3√(25/2), and the values of x and y that yield this maximum value are x = √(25/2) and y = √(25/2)."
