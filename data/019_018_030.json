    "message_2": "Let's consider two odd integers, a and b. By definition, an odd integer can be represented as 2n + 1, where n is an integer.\n\nSo, let a = 2m + 1 and b = 2n + 1, where m and n are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of a and b:\n\na + b = (2m + 1) + (2n + 1)\n\nCombine the like terms:\n\na + b = 2m + 2n + 2\n\nFactor out the 2:\n\na + b = 2(m + n + 1)\n\nLet k = m + n + 1, where k is also an integer since the sum of integers is an integer.\n\nSo, a + b = 2k\n\nSince a + b is a multiple of 2, it is an even integer. Therefore, the sum of two odd integers is an even integer. QED."
