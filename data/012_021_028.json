    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph, we need to find a tree decomposition of the graph with the minimum size of the largest bag. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node (called a bag) is a subset of vertices of the graph, and it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices of the graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there exists a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the graph, the set of bags containing v forms a connected subtree.\n\nHere is one possible tree decomposition of the given graph:\n\n```\n  {1,2,3}\n   /   \\\n{1,2,4} {1,3,6}\n  |       |\n{1,2,5} {3,5,6}\n  |       |\n{2,5,7} {5,6,7}\n```\n\nIn this tree decomposition, the largest bag size is 3. We can't find a tree decomposition with a smaller largest bag size, so the treewidth of the given graph is 3 - 1 = 2."
