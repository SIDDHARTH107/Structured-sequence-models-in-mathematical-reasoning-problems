    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. In other words, it is the minimum number of colors required for a proper edge coloring.\n\nFor the given graph G, we can observe that it is a complete graph with 5 vertices, denoted as K_5. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nThe chromatic index of a complete graph K_n with n vertices can be determined using the following rule:\n\n1. If n is even, the chromatic index is n.\n2. If n is odd, the chromatic index is n+1.\n\nSince the given graph G is a complete graph with 5 vertices (odd number), its chromatic index is 5 + 1 = 6."
