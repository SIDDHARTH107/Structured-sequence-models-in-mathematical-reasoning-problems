    "message_2": "To find the Nash Equilibrium, we need to identify the best responses for each player.\n\nFor Player 1:\n- If Player 2 chooses L, Player 1's best response is T (5 > 2).\n- If Player 2 chooses R, Player 1's best response is B (4 > 1).\n\nFor Player 2:\n- If Player 1 chooses T, Player 2's best response is R (3 > 1).\n- If Player 1 chooses B, Player 2's best response is R (4 > 2).\n\nNow, we look for the strategies where both players are playing their best responses. In this case, it is when Player 1 chooses B and Player 2 chooses R. The Nash Equilibrium is the strategy profile (B, R) with the payoff (4, 4)."
