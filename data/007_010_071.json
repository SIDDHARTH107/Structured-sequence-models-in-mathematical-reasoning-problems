Find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n$ is congruent to both $x$ and $y$ modulo both $7$ and $5$.\"",
    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ that is congruent to both $x$ and $y$ modulo both $7$ and $5$, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We are given the following congruences:\n\n1. $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$\n2. $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$\n3. $y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$\n4. $y \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$\n\nFirst, we find a common solution for $x$:\n\nSince $7$ and $5$ are coprime, we can find integers $m$ and $n$ such that $7m + 5n = 1$. Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that $m = 3$ and $n = -4$. Then, we can find a common solution for $x$ as follows:\n\n$x = 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot (-4) + 2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 3 = -60 + 42 = -18$\n\nSince we want the smallest positive integer, we can add the least common multiple of $7$ and $5$, which is $35$, to get:\n\n$x = -18 + 35 = 17$\n\nNow, we find a common solution for $y$:\n\nUsing the same values of $m$ and $n$, we can find a common solution for $y$ as follows:\n\n$y = 1 \\cdot 5 \\cdot (-4) + 4 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 3 = -20 + 84 = 64$\n\nSince $64$ is already positive, we don't need to add the least common multiple of $7$ and $5$.\n\nFinally, we want to find the smallest positive integer $n$ that is congruent to both $x$ and $y$ modulo both $7$ and $5$. Since $x \\equiv 17 \\pmod{35}$ and $y \\equiv 64 \\pmod{35}$, we can see that $n$ must be congruent to both $17$ and $64$ modulo $35$. The smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition is:\n\n$n = 17 + 35k$\n\nSince $17$ is already congruent to $64$ modulo $35$, the smallest positive integer $n$ is:\n\n$n = 17$"
