    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a certain stock price increasing on any given day is 0.6, while the probability of it decreasing is 0.4. If the stock starts at a price of $100, what is the probability that it will increase to $110 within the next two days?",
    "message_2": "To reach a price of $110 within the next two days, the stock price must increase on both days. We can calculate the probability of this happening by multiplying the probability of the stock price increasing on each day.\n\nProbability of increasing on Day 1: 0.6\nProbability of increasing on Day 2: 0.6\n\nProbability of increasing on both days: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36\n\nTherefore, the probability that the stock price will increase to $110 within the next two days is 0.36 or 36%."
