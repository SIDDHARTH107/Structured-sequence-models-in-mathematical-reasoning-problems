    "message_2": "A Nash equilibrium occurs when each player chooses a strategy that is the best response to the other player's strategy, and no player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy.\n\nIn this Chicken Game, there are two Nash equilibria:\n\n1. Player 1 swerves, and Player 2 doesn't swerve. In this case, the payoffs are (5, 0). If Player 1 deviates and doesn't swerve, their payoff decreases from 5 to -10. If Player 2 deviates and swerves, their payoff decreases from 0 to -1.\n\n2. Player 1 doesn't swerve, and Player 2 swerves. In this case, the payoffs are (0, 5). If Player 1 deviates and swerves, their payoff decreases from 0 to -1. If Player 2 deviates and doesn't swerve, their payoff decreases from 5 to -10.\n\nSo, the Nash equilibria for this game are:\n\n1. (Player 1 swerves, Player 2 doesn't swerve) with payoffs (5, 0)\n2. (Player 1 doesn't swerve, Player 2 swerves) with payoffs (0, 5)"
