    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x with period 2π, we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the series:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the sum is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nThe coefficients are given by the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(0 * x)] dx from -π to π\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)] dx from -π to π\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x)] dx from -π to π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1 / π) * ∫[x * cos(0 * x)] dx from -π to π\na_0 = (1 / π) * ∫[x] dx from -π to π\na_0 = (1 / π) * [(x^2 / 2) | from -π to π]\na_0 = (1 / π) * [(π^2 / 2) - (-π^2 / 2)]\na_0 = (1 / π) * (π^2)\na_0 = 0\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[x * cos(n * x)] dx from -π to π\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = cos(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = (1 / n) * sin(n * x)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫[x * cos(n * x)] dx = x * (1 / n) * sin(n * x) - ∫[(1 / n) * sin(n * x) dx]\n\nNow, integrate the remaining integral:\n\n∫[(1 / n) * sin(n * x) dx] = (-1 / n^2) * cos(n * x)\n\nSo, the original integral becomes:\n\n∫[x * cos(n * x)] dx = x * (1 / n) * sin(n * x) + (1 / n^2) * cos(n * x)\n\nNow, we can find a_n:\n\na_n = (1 / π) * [x * (1 / n) * sin(n * x) + (1 / n^2) * cos(n * x) | from -π to π]\n\nAfter evaluating the expression at the limits, we find that all terms cancel out:\n\na_n = 0\n\nFinally, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[x * sin(n * x)] dx from -π to π\n\nAgain, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = dx, v = (-1 / n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\n\n∫[x * sin(n * x)] dx = x * (-1 / n) * cos(n * x) - ∫[(-1 / n) * cos(n * x) dx]\n\nNow, integrate the remaining integral:\n\n∫[(-1 / n) * cos(n * x) dx] = (-1 / n^2) * sin(n * x)\n\nSo, the original integral becomes:\n\n∫[x * sin(n * x)] dx = x * (-1 / n) * cos(n * x) + (1 / n^2) * sin(n * x)\n\nNow, we can find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * [x * (-1 / n) * cos(n * x) + (1 / n^2) * sin(n * x) | from -π to π]\n\nAfter evaluating the expression at the limits, we get:\n\nb_n = (2 / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nSo, the Fourier series of f(x) = x with period 2π is:\n\nf(x) = Σ[(2 / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the sum is from n = 1 to infinity."
