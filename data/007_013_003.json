    "message_2": "According to the Goldbach Conjecture, every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This conjecture has been tested extensively for even integers up to very large values, and it has been found to hold true in every case. However, it has not been proven or disproven for all even integers.\n\nSo, as of now, there is no known smallest even integer greater than 2 that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers."
