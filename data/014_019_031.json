    "message_1": "A transposition cipher is created by shifting the letters of a message by a certain number of positions. If a message \"HELLO WORLD\" is encrypted using a transposition cipher where every second letter is shifted one position to the right, what would be the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using a transposition cipher where every second letter is shifted one position to the right, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify every second letter: E, L, O, O, L\n2. Shift each of these letters one position to the right in the alphabet: F, M, P, P, M\n3. Replace the original letters with the shifted letters: HFLMP WPPMD\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"HFLMP WPPMD\"."
