    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot execute code or run algorithms directly. However, I can guide you through the steps to implement a genetic algorithm to find the minimum value of the given function.\n\n1. Initialization: Create an initial population of 50 random individuals (x-values) within the interval [0, 5].\n\n2. Evaluation: Calculate the fitness of each individual in the population by evaluating the function f(x) for each x-value. Since we are looking for the minimum value, the fitness can be defined as the negative of the function value: fitness(x) = -f(x).\n\n3. Selection: Select parents for reproduction based on their fitness. You can use methods like roulette wheel selection or tournament selection.\n\n4. Crossover: Perform crossover (recombination) between pairs of parents to create offspring. You can use methods like single-point crossover or uniform crossover.\n\n5. Mutation: With a mutation rate of 0.02, apply mutation to the offspring by randomly changing a small portion of their x-values. This helps maintain diversity in the population and prevents premature convergence.\n\n6. Replacement: Replace some or all of the individuals in the current population with the offspring, depending on the chosen replacement strategy (e.g., elitism or generational replacement).\n\n7. Termination: Repeat steps 2-6 for a certain number of generations or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., no improvement in the best fitness for a number of consecutive generations).\n\n8. Result: The best individual in the final population represents the approximate minimum value of the function f(x).\n\nTo implement this algorithm in a programming language like Python, you can use libraries such as DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) or PyGAD (Python Genetic Algorithm for Data Science).\n\nAfter running the genetic algorithm optimization, you will obtain an approximate minimum value for the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5 over the interval [0, 5]."
