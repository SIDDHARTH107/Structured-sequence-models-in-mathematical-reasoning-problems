    "message_1": "Consider a Stackelberg competition between two firms. The demand function for the market is Q=100-2P. The follower firm (Firm 2) knows that the leader firm (Firm 1) has a production capacity of 30 units. Firm 2 can produce at a marginal cost of $10 per unit.\n\nIf Firm 1 maximizes its profit, what will be the price and quantity it will produce? What will be the profit made by both firms?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the reaction function of Firm 2 (the follower firm). The reaction function shows the optimal quantity that Firm 2 should produce given the quantity produced by Firm 1.\n\nThe inverse demand function is given by P = 50 - 0.5Q. Firm 2's total revenue is TR2 = P * q2 = (50 - 0.5(Q1 + q2)) * q2. Firm 2's total cost is TC2 = 10 * q2. Therefore, Firm 2's profit function is:\n\nπ2 = TR2 - TC2 = (50 - 0.5(Q1 + q2)) * q2 - 10 * q2.\n\nTo find the reaction function, we differentiate the profit function with respect to q2 and set the result equal to zero:\n\ndπ2/dq2 = (50 - 0.5(Q1 + q2)) - 0.5q2 - 10 = 0.\n\nSolving for q2, we get the reaction function for Firm 2:\n\nq2 = 40 - 0.5Q1.\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal quantity for Firm 1 to maximize its profit. Firm 1's total revenue is TR1 = P * Q1 = (50 - 0.5(Q1 + q2)) * Q1. Firm 1's total cost is TC1 = 0 (since it has a production capacity of 30 units). Therefore, Firm 1's profit function is:\n\nπ1 = TR1 - TC1 = (50 - 0.5(Q1 + q2)) * Q1.\n\nSubstitute the reaction function of Firm 2 into the profit function of Firm 1:\n\nπ1 = (50 - 0.5(Q1 + (40 - 0.5Q1))) * Q1.\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nπ1 = (50 - 0.5Q1 - 20 + 0.25Q1) * Q1 = (30 - 0.25Q1) * Q1.\n\nTo maximize its profit, Firm 1 should differentiate the profit function with respect to Q1 and set the result equal to zero:\n\ndπ1/dQ1 = 30 - 0.5Q1 = 0.\n\nSolving for Q1, we get:\n\nQ1 = 60.\n\nHowever, Firm 1 has a production capacity of 30 units, so it will produce Q1 = 30 units.\n\nNow, we can find the quantity produced by Firm 2 using its reaction function:\n\nq2 = 40 - 0.5 * 30 = 40 - 15 = 25.\n\nThe total quantity produced in the market is Q = Q1 + q2 = 30 + 25 = 55.\n\nUsing the inverse demand function, we can find the market price:\n\nP = 50 - 0.5 * 55 = 50 - 27.5 = 22.5.\n\nNow, we can calculate the profits for both firms. For Firm 1:\n\nTR1 = P * Q1 = 22.5 * 30 = 675.\nTC1 = 0 (since it has a production capacity of 30 units).\nπ1 = TR1 - TC1 = 675 - 0 = 675.\n\nFor Firm 2:\n\nTR2 = P * q2 = 22.5 * 25 = 562.5.\nTC2 = 10 * q2 = 10 * 25 = 250.\nπ2 = TR2 - TC2 = 562.5 - 250 = 312.5.\n\nIn conclusion, Firm 1 will produce 30 units at a price of $22.5, making a profit of $675. Firm 2 will produce 25 units and make a profit of $312.5."
