    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a bipartite graph G is a set of edges that covers every vertex exactly once. In other words, each vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex in the matching.\n\nIn this case, we have a bipartite graph G with 10 vertices on the left and 12 vertices on the right. The degree of each vertex in G is 3, meaning that each vertex is connected to 3 other vertices.\n\nFirst, let's check if a perfect matching is possible in this graph. According to Hall's Marriage Theorem, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a perfect matching in a bipartite graph is that for any subset S of vertices on one side of the graph, the number of vertices in the neighborhood of S (denoted as N(S)) is at least as large as the number of vertices in S.\n\nIn this case, since each vertex has a degree of 3, any subset S of vertices on the left side will have at least 3|S| edges connecting to the right side. However, since there are only 12 vertices on the right side, the maximum number of vertices that can be connected to a subset S is 12. Therefore, a perfect matching is only possible if the size of the subset S is less than or equal to 4.\n\nNow, let's try to find a perfect matching in this graph. Since there are 10 vertices on the left side and 12 vertices on the right side, a perfect matching would require that each vertex on the left side is connected to a unique vertex on the right side. However, since each vertex on the left side has a degree of 3, there will be at least two vertices on the left side that share a common neighbor on the right side. This means that a perfect matching is not possible in this graph.\n\nIn conclusion, there does not exist a perfect matching in the given bipartite graph G."
