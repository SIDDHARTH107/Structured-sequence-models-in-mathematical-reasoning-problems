    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose we have an image file that is 512 pixels wide and 256 pixels tall. We want to apply the Fourier transform to this image to analyze its frequency components. How many coefficients will there be in the resulting transformed image?",
    "message_2": "To apply the Fourier transform to an image, we perform the 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The 2D DFT is computed for each point in the image, so the resulting transformed image will have the same dimensions as the original image.\n\nIn this case, the original image is 512 pixels wide and 256 pixels tall. Therefore, the transformed image will also be 512 pixels wide and 256 pixels tall.\n\nTo find the total number of coefficients in the transformed image, we simply multiply the width and height:\n\nNumber of coefficients = width × height\nNumber of coefficients = 512 × 256\nNumber of coefficients = 131072\n\nSo, there will be 131,072 coefficients in the resulting transformed image."
