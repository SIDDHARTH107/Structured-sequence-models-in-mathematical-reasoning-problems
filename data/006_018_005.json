    "message_2": "To find the expected number of companies that will have experienced financial fraud, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected number = Probability of financial fraud * Number of companies investigated\n\nExpected number = 0.02 * 500\n\nExpected number = 10\n\nSo, the expected number of companies that will have experienced financial fraud is 10."
