Find the dimension of the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of A when q is a root of unity of order n.\n\n(Note: This problem involves applying tools from representation theory and algebraic geometry to study the structure of the algebra A and its representations.)",
    "message_2": "Let A be the non-commutative algebra generated by two elements x and y satisfying the relation xy = qyx, where q is a non-zero complex number and a root of unity of order n. That is, q^n = 1.\n\nTo find the dimension of the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of A, we can use the fact that A is a quotient of the polynomial algebra C<x, y> by the ideal generated by the relation (xy - qyx). \n\nConsider the Verma module V(λ) with highest weight λ, generated by a highest weight vector v_λ such that x.v_λ = λv_λ and y.v_λ = 0. Then, using the relation xy = qyx, we have:\n\nx(yv_λ) = q(yx)v_λ = q(λ - λq)v_λ = (λ - λq^2)v_λ.\n\nNow, let's consider the action of the powers of y on v_λ:\n\ny^k.v_λ = 0 for k > 0, and\ny^k.x.v_λ = (λ - λq^2)^k.v_λ for k ≥ 0.\n\nSince q is a root of unity of order n, we have q^n = 1, and thus (λ - λq^2)^n = (λ - λ)^n = 0. Therefore, the action of y^n on V(λ) is trivial, and the dimension of the irreducible representation V(λ) is at most n.\n\nNow, let's show that there exists an irreducible representation of dimension n. Consider the vector space V = C^n with basis {v_0, v_1, ..., v_(n-1)}. Define the action of x and y on V as follows:\n\nx.v_k = q^k v_k for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1, and\ny.v_k = v_(k+1) for k = 0, 1, ..., n-2, and y.v_(n-1) = 0.\n\nIt is easy to check that this action satisfies the relation xy = qyx. Moreover, the submodule generated by v_(n-1) is the whole space V, so V is an irreducible representation of A. Therefore, the dimension of the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of A when q is a root of unity of order n is n."
