    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2cos(3x) + 1 = 0 for x in the interval [0, 2π], follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate the cosine function:\n2cos(3x) + 1 = 0\n2cos(3x) = -1\ncos(3x) = -1/2\n\n2. Find the general solution for the angle inside the cosine function:\nSince the cosine function is negative, we know that the angle 3x must be in the second or third quadrant. The reference angle for cos(3x) = -1/2 is π/3. Thus, the general solution for 3x is:\n\n3x = π - π/3 + 2kπ or 3x = π + π/3 + 2kπ, where k is an integer.\n\n3x = 2π/3 + 2kπ or 3x = 4π/3 + 2kπ\n\n3. Divide by 3 to find the general solution for x:\nx = (2π/3 + 2kπ)/3 or x = (4π/3 + 2kπ)/3\n\nx = 2π/9 + (2kπ)/3 or x = 4π/9 + (2kπ)/3\n\n4. Find the specific solutions for x in the interval [0, 2π]:\nFor the first general solution, x = 2π/9 + (2kπ)/3, we have:\n\nk = 0: x = 2π/9\nk = 1: x = 2π/9 + 2π/3 = 8π/9\nk = 2: x = 2π/9 + 4π/3 = 14π/9 > 2π (out of the interval)\n\nFor the second general solution, x = 4π/9 + (2kπ)/3, we have:\n\nk = 0: x = 4π/9\nk = 1: x = 4π/9 + 2π/3 = 10π/9\nk = 2: x = 4π/9 + 4π/3 = 16π/9 > 2π (out of the interval)\n\nSo, the specific solutions for x in the interval [0, 2π] are:\n\nx = 2π/9, 8π/9, 4π/9, and 10π/9."
