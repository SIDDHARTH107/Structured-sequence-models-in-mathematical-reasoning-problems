    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 7x^3 + 2x - 1 using the power rule, we need to apply the power rule to each term in the function. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\n1. For the term 3x^4, n = 4. So, the derivative is (4)(3)x^(4-1) = 12x^3.\n2. For the term -7x^3, n = 3. So, the derivative is (3)(-7)x^(3-1) = -21x^2.\n3. For the term 2x, n = 1. So, the derivative is (1)(2)x^(1-1) = 2x^0 = 2.\n4. For the constant term -1, the derivative is 0, as the derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 21x^2 + 2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 7x^3 + 2x - 1 is f'(x) = 12x^3 - 21x^2 + 2."
