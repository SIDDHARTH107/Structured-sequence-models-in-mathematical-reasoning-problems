    "message_2": "The number of different Latin squares of order n (i.e., n x n squares) is not a simple formula, and it is not known for all values of n. However, the number of Latin squares of order 9 (using the digits 1 to 9) has been calculated.\n\nThe number of different 9x9 Latin squares is 552,475,149,615,689,041.\n\nSo, the group of students can create 552,475,149,615,689,041 different Latin squares using the digits 1 to 9."
