    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 8x - 5 = 0, we can try to factor it or use numerical methods. In this case, let's try factoring by using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that any rational root of the polynomial P(x) = a_nx^n + a_(n-1)x^(n-1) + ... + a_1x + a_0, where all coefficients are integers, must be of the form ±p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term a_0 and q is a factor of the leading coefficient a_n.\n\nFor our polynomial, the constant term is -5 and the leading coefficient is 2. The factors of -5 are ±1, ±5, and the factors of 2 are ±1, ±2. Therefore, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±5, ±1/2, and ±5/2.\n\nNow, let's test these possible roots:\n\nP(1) = 2(1)^3 + 5(1)^2 - 8(1) - 5 = 2 + 5 - 8 - 5 = -6 ≠ 0\nP(-1) = 2(-1)^3 + 5(-1)^2 - 8(-1) - 5 = -2 + 5 + 8 - 5 = 6 ≠ 0\nP(5) = 2(5)^3 + 5(5)^2 - 8(5) - 5 = 250 + 125 - 40 - 5 = 330 ≠ 0\nP(-5) = 2(-5)^3 + 5(-5)^2 - 8(-5) - 5 = -250 + 125 + 40 - 5 = -90 ≠ 0\nP(1/2) = 2(1/2)^3 + 5(1/2)^2 - 8(1/2) - 5 = 1/4 + 5/4 - 4 - 5 = 0\nP(-1/2) = 2(-1/2)^3 + 5(-1/2)^2 - 8(-1/2) - 5 ≠ 0\nP(5/2) ≠ 0\nP(-5/2) ≠ 0\n\nWe found that x = 1/2 is a root of the polynomial. Now we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(2x^3 + 5x^2 - 8x - 5) / (x - 1/2) = 2x^2 + 6x + 5\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation to solve:\n\n2x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the remaining roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 6, and c = 5:\n\nx = (-6 ± √(6^2 - 4(2)(5))) / (2(2))\nx = (-6 ± √(36 - 40)) / 4\nx = (-6 ± √(-4)) / 4\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the remaining roots are complex:\n\nx = (-6 ± 2i) / 4\nx = -3/2 ± 1/2i\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial equation 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 8x - 5 = 0 are x = 1/2, x = -3/2 + 1/2i, and x = -3/2 - 1/2i."
