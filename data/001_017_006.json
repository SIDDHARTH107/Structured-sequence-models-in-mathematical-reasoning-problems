    "message_2": "To solve the equation $\\log_2 (3x+8) - \\log_2 (x+1) = 3$, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property that states $\\log_b a - \\log_b c = \\log_b \\frac{a}{c}$. Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\n$\\log_2 \\frac{3x+8}{x+1} = 3$\n\nNow, we can remove the logarithm by raising both sides of the equation to the base 2:\n\n$2^{\\log_2 \\frac{3x+8}{x+1}} = 2^3$\n\n$\\frac{3x+8}{x+1} = 8$\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides by $(x+1)$ and simplifying:\n\n$(3x+8) = 8(x+1)$\n\n$3x+8 = 8x+8$\n\nNow, subtract 3x from both sides:\n\n$8 = 5x+8$\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n$0 = 5x$\n\nFinally, divide by 5:\n\n$x = 0$\n\nSo, the solution for x is 0."
