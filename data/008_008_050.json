    "message_1": "A furniture company produces two types of chairs: wooden chairs and plastic chairs. Each wooden chair takes 2 hours to produce and sells for $80, while each plastic chair takes 1.5 hours to produce and sells for $60. The company can only allocate a maximum of 120 hours for woodworking and 90 hours for plastic molding per week. How many of each type of chair should the company produce to maximize their weekly revenue?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of wooden chairs and y be the number of plastic chairs produced.\n\nThe constraints for the production time are:\n2x <= 120 (woodworking hours)\n1.5y <= 90 (plastic molding hours)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the revenue is:\nRevenue = 80x + 60y\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the constraints for x and y:\nx <= 60 (woodworking hours)\ny <= 60 (plastic molding hours)\n\nNow we'll find the corner points of the feasible region:\n(0, 0) - No chairs produced\n(60, 0) - Only wooden chairs produced\n(0, 60) - Only plastic chairs produced\n(60, 60) - Both wooden and plastic chairs produced, but this point is not feasible because it exceeds the allocated hours for woodworking and plastic molding.\n\nNow we'll calculate the revenue for each feasible corner point:\n(0, 0): Revenue = 80(0) + 60(0) = $0\n(60, 0): Revenue = 80(60) + 60(0) = $4800\n(0, 60): Revenue = 80(0) + 60(60) = $3600\n\nThe maximum revenue is achieved when the company produces 60 wooden chairs and no plastic chairs, with a total revenue of $4800 per week."
