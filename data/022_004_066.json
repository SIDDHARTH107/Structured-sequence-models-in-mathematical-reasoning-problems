    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function $f(z) = \\frac{z^2 + 2z + 1}{z^2 - 1}$, we first need to find the points where the denominator is equal to zero. \n\nThe denominator is $z^2 - 1 = (z - 1)(z + 1)$. Thus, the singularities occur at $z = 1$ and $z = -1$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the type of each singularity. \n\n1. Singularity at $z = 1$:\n\nWe can factor the numerator as follows: $z^2 + 2z + 1 = (z + 1)^2$. So, we can rewrite the function as:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{(z + 1)^2}{(z - 1)(z + 1)}$\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common factor $(z + 1)$:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{z + 1}{z - 1}$\n\nSince the function is now well-defined at $z = 1$, the singularity at $z = 1$ is a removable singularity.\n\n2. Singularity at $z = -1$:\n\nWe already factored the numerator and found that $f(z) = \\frac{(z + 1)^2}{(z - 1)(z + 1)}$. The function is not well-defined at $z = -1$, and the highest power of $(z + 1)$ in the denominator is 1. Therefore, the singularity at $z = -1$ is a pole of order 1 (simple pole).\n\nIn summary, the function $f(z) = \\frac{z^2 + 2z + 1}{z^2 - 1}$ has a removable singularity at $z = 1$ and a simple pole at $z = -1$."
