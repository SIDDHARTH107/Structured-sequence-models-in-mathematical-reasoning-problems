    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. The profits per unit for Product A and Product B are $10 and $15, respectively. The company has a budget of $5000 to spend on producing these products. Additionally, the company has a production capacity of 500 units per week. Product A requires 2 hours of production time per unit, while Product B requires 3 hours of production time per unit. \n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of each product that the company should produce in order to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit function: P(x, y) = 10x + 15y.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Budget constraint: 10x + 15y ≤ 5000\n2. Production capacity constraint: x + y ≤ 500\n3. Production time constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 1000 (assuming 1000 hours of production time available per week)\n4. Non-negativity constraint: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we will solve the system of inequalities to find the feasible region:\n\n1. y ≤ (5000 - 10x) / 15\n2. y ≤ 500 - x\n3. y ≤ (1000 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow we will find the points of intersection of these inequalities:\n\nIntersection of (1) and (2):\n(5000 - 10x) / 15 = 500 - x\n5000 - 10x = 7500 - 15x\n5x = 2500\nx = 500\n\ny = 500 - 500 = 0\n\nIntersection of (1) and (3):\n(5000 - 10x) / 15 = (1000 - 2x) / 3\n1000 - 2x = 5000 - 10x\n8x = 4000\nx = 500\n\ny = (1000 - 2 * 500) / 3 = 0\n\nIntersection of (2) and (3):\n500 - x = (1000 - 2x) / 3\n1500 - 3x = 1000 - 2x\nx = 500\n\ny = 500 - 500 = 0\n\nAll three intersections result in the same point (500, 0). This means that the company should produce 500 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B to maximize their profit.\n\nThe maximum profit will be P(500, 0) = 10 * 500 + 15 * 0 = $5000."
