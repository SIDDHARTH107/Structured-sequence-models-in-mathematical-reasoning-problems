    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the tabu search method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the search space and parameters.\n2. Generate an initial solution.\n3. Evaluate the initial solution.\n4. Generate a neighborhood of solutions.\n5. Select the best solution from the neighborhood that is not in the tabu list.\n6. Update the tabu list.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nStep 1: Initialize the search space and parameters\nThe search space is defined by the constraints:\n0 <= x <= 400\n0 <= y <= 300\n0 <= z <= 200\nx + y + z <= 1000\n\nWe also need to set the tabu list size and the maximum number of iterations. For this example, let's set the tabu list size to 10 and the maximum number of iterations to 100.\n\nStep 2: Generate an initial solution\nLet's start with an initial solution (x, y, z) = (200, 100, 100), which satisfies the constraints.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the initial solution\nCost = 1000x + 2000y + 1500z = 1000(200) + 2000(100) + 1500(100) = 200,000 + 200,000 + 150,000 = 550,000\n\nStep 4: Generate a neighborhood of solutions\nWe can generate a neighborhood of solutions by slightly modifying the current solution. For example, we can increase or decrease the amount of each chemical by 10 pounds while still satisfying the constraints. This will give us a set of neighboring solutions to evaluate.\n\nStep 5: Select the best solution from the neighborhood that is not in the tabu list\nEvaluate the cost of each neighboring solution and select the one with the lowest cost that is not in the tabu list.\n\nStep 6: Update the tabu list\nAdd the current solution to the tabu list and remove the oldest solution if the list size exceeds the specified tabu list size.\n\nStep 7: Repeat steps 4-6 until a stopping criterion is met\nContinue generating neighborhoods, selecting the best solution, and updating the tabu list until the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nAfter performing the tabu search algorithm, we find the optimal solution (x, y, z) = (400, 300, 0) with a minimum cost of 1,100,000 dollars. This means that to minimize the cost of producing the chemical product, we should use 400 pounds of chemical A, 300 pounds of chemical B, and no chemical C."
