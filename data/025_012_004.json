    "message_2": "To find the equation of an elliptic curve given three points, we will use the general form of an elliptic curve:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$\n\nWe will plug in the coordinates of the three points into the equation and solve for the coefficients $A$ and $B$. \n\nFor point $P_1 = (-1, -5)$:\n\n$(-5)^2 = (-1)^3 + A(-1) + B$\n\n$25 = -1 - A + B$\n\nFor point $P_2 = (2, 7)$:\n\n$(7)^2 = (2)^3 + A(2) + B$\n\n$49 = 8 + 2A + B$\n\nFor point $P_3 = (4, 11)$:\n\n$(11)^2 = (4)^3 + A(4) + B$\n\n$121 = 64 + 4A + B$\n\nNow we have a system of three linear equations with two unknowns:\n\n1) $25 = -1 - A + B$\n2) $49 = 8 + 2A + B$\n3) $121 = 64 + 4A + B$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n$49 - 25 = (8 + 2A + B) - (-1 - A + B)$\n\n$24 = 9 + A$\n\n$A = 15$\n\nNow, plug the value of $A$ into equation (1):\n\n$25 = -1 - 15 + B$\n\n$B = 41$\n\nSo, the equation of the elliptic curve is:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 + 15x + 41$"
