    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between nodes A and C, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or simply analyze the graph visually. In this case, the graph is small enough to analyze visually.\n\nThere are three possible paths from A to C:\n\n1. A -> B -> C: The length of this path is 5 (A to B) + 3 (B to C) = 8.\n2. A -> D -> C: The length of this path is 9 (A to D) + 2 (D to C) = 11.\n3. A -> B -> D -> C: The length of this path is 5 (A to B) + 6 (B to D) + 2 (D to C) = 13.\n\nThe shortest path between nodes A and C is the first path (A -> B -> C) with a length of 8."
