    "message_2": "The Feigenbaum constant, denoted by δ, is a universal constant that appears in the period-doubling bifurcation sequence of chaotic systems. It is approximately equal to 4.6692.\n\nTo find the value of a at which the third bifurcation occurs, we can use the following formula:\n\na_n = a_(n-1) + (a_(n-1) - a_(n-2))/δ\n\nwhere a_n is the value of a at the nth bifurcation, and δ is the Feigenbaum constant.\n\nGiven that the first bifurcation occurs at a = 2 (a_1 = 2), we need to find the values of a_2 and a_3.\n\nLet's assume a_2 and a_3 are unknown. We can set up the following equations:\n\na_2 = a_1 + (a_1 - a_0)/δ\na_3 = a_2 + (a_2 - a_1)/δ\n\nWe don't have the value of a_0, but we can use the fact that the difference between consecutive a values converges to the Feigenbaum constant:\n\n(a_1 - a_0)/δ ≈ (a_2 - a_1)/δ\n\nSolving for a_0, we get:\n\na_0 ≈ a_1 - (a_2 - a_1)\na_0 ≈ 2 - (a_2 - 2)\n\nNow we can substitute this back into the equation for a_2:\n\na_2 = 2 + (2 - (2 - (a_2 - 2)))/δ\na_2 = 2 + (a_2 - 2)/δ\n\nRearranging and solving for a_2, we get:\n\na_2 ≈ 2 + (4.6692 - 2)/4.6692\na_2 ≈ 3.2449\n\nNow we can find a_3:\n\na_3 = a_2 + (a_2 - a_1)/δ\na_3 = 3.2449 + (3.2449 - 2)/4.6692\na_3 ≈ 3.5644\n\nSo, the third bifurcation occurs at a ≈ 3.5644, and the corresponding Feigenbaum constant is approximately 4.6692."
