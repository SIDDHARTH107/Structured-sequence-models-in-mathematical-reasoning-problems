    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nTo find the chromatic number of the given graph, we can try to color the vertices using the minimum number of colors possible.\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A.\n```\n     A\n    / \\\n   /   \\\n  2     3\n / \\   / \\\n4   5-6\n```\n\n2. Color vertices 2 and 3 with color B, since they are both adjacent to vertex 1.\n```\n     A\n    / \\\n   /   \\\n  B     B\n / \\   / \\\n4   5-6\n```\n\n3. Color vertices 4 and 6 with color A, since they are both adjacent to vertex 2 and 3, respectively.\n```\n     A\n    / \\\n   /   \\\n  B     B\n / \\   / \\\nA   5-A\n```\n\n4. Finally, color vertex 5 with color C, since it is adjacent to vertices 2, 4, and 6, which have colors B and A.\n```\n     A\n    / \\\n   /   \\\n  B     B\n / \\   / \\\nA   C-A\n```\n\nWe have successfully colored the graph using 3 colors, and it is not possible to color it with fewer colors. Therefore, the chromatic number of the graph is 3."
