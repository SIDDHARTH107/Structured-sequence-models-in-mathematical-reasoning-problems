    "message_2": "To determine if the system has a solution, we can first check if the equations are multiples of each other. If they are, then the system is either dependent (infinite solutions) or inconsistent (no solution).\n\nDivide the second equation by 2:\n\n(1/2)(4x - 6y) = (1/2)(14)\n\n2x - 3y = 7\n\nWe can see that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. This means the two equations represent the same line, and the system is dependent. There are infinite solutions for this system, as any point on the line will satisfy both equations."
