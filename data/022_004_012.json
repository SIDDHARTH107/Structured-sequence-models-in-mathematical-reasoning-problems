    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) = 1/(z^3 + 1) at the singularity z = eiπ/3, we first need to factor the denominator:\n\nz^3 + 1 = (z + 1)(z^2 - z + 1)\n\nNow, we can see that z = eiπ/3 is a root of the second factor:\n\n(eiπ/3)^2 - eiπ/3 + 1 = -1/2 - (√3/2)i - eiπ/3 + 1\n\nMultiplying eiπ/3 by its complex conjugate, we get:\n\n(eiπ/3)(e-iπ/3) = e^0 = 1\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n-1/2 - (√3/2)i - 1 + 1 = -1/2 - (√3/2)i\n\nNow, we can use the residue formula for simple poles:\n\nRes[f(z), z0] = lim(z->z0) [(z - z0) * f(z)]\n\nIn our case, z0 = eiπ/3. So, we have:\n\nRes[f(z), eiπ/3] = lim(z->eiπ/3) [(z - eiπ/3) * 1/(z^3 + 1)]\n\nSince z = eiπ/3 is a root of the second factor in the denominator, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(z) = 1/[(z + 1)(z - eiπ/3)(z - e-iπ/3)]\n\nNow, we can find the residue:\n\nRes[f(z), eiπ/3] = lim(z->eiπ/3) [(z - eiπ/3) * 1/[(z + 1)(z - eiπ/3)(z - e-iπ/3)]]\n\nThe (z - eiπ/3) term cancels out:\n\nRes[f(z), eiπ/3] = lim(z->eiπ/3) [1/((z + 1)(z - e-iπ/3))]\n\nNow, we can plug in z = eiπ/3:\n\nRes[f(z), eiπ/3] = 1/[((eiπ/3) + 1)(eiπ/3 - e-iπ/3)]\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nRes[f(z), eiπ/3] = 1/[(1/2 + (√3/2)i)(2(√3/2)i)]\n\nRes[f(z), eiπ/3] = 1/[(1/2 + (√3/2)i)(√3i)]\n\nNow, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\nRes[f(z), eiπ/3] = [(1/2 - (√3/2)i)(1/2 - (√3/2)i)]/[(1/2 + (√3/2)i)(1/2 - (√3/2)i)(√3i)]\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nRes[f(z), eiπ/3] = (1/4 + (√3/4)i)/[(1/4)(3)(√3i)]\n\nRes[f(z), eiπ/3] = (1 + √3i)/(3√3i)\n\nFinally, we can divide both the real and imaginary parts by 3√3i:\n\nRes[f(z), eiπ/3] = (1/3√3 - i)/i\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by -i, we get:\n\nRes[f(z), eiπ/3] = (-1/3 + √3/3i)\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) = 1/(z^3 + 1) at the singularity z = eiπ/3 is:\n\nRes[f(z), eiπ/3] = -1/3 + (√3/3)i"
