    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon Curve is a fractal created by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The perimeter of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the perimeter is 2 units (the original segment plus one additional segment of the same length). With each subsequent iteration, the number of segments doubles, and the length of each segment is divided by the square root of 2 (since each segment is now part of a right-angled triangle with the original segment length as the hypotenuse).\n\nLet's denote the perimeter after n iterations as P(n). After 10 iterations, the number of segments will be 2^10 = 1024, and the length of each segment will be 1 / (sqrt(2))^10.\n\nP(10) = 1024 * (1 / (sqrt(2))^10)\nP(10) = 1024 * (1 / (2^5))\nP(10) = 1024 / 32\nP(10) = 32\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Heighway Dragon Curve after 10 iterations is 32 units."
