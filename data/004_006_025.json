    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 10, we first need to find its first derivative and then set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nThe first derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x - 9\n\nNow, we set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 6x - 9 = 0\n\nWe can factor out a 3 from the equation:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 3 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two critical points:\n\nx = 3 and x = -1\n\nNow, we need to determine whether these critical points correspond to a maximum, minimum, or saddle point. To do this, we can use the second derivative test.\n\nThe second derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 6\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 6 = 12 > 0\nf''(-1) = 6(-1) - 6 = -12 < 0\n\nSince f''(3) > 0, the critical point x = 3 corresponds to a local minimum. And since f''(-1) < 0, the critical point x = -1 corresponds to a local maximum.\n\nIn summary, the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 10 has a local maximum at x = -1 and a local minimum at x = 3."
