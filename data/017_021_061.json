    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 48: 48 = 2^4 * 3^1\n2. Find the number of possible abelian groups: We can use the formula for the number of abelian groups of a given order, which is the product of the partition numbers of the exponents in the prime factorization. For 48, the partition numbers for 4 and 1 are 5 and 1, respectively. So, there are 5 * 1 = 5 abelian groups of order 48.\n3. Find the number of non-abelian groups: To do this, we can use the following formula for the number of non-abelian groups of order p^a * q^b, where p and q are distinct primes, and a and b are positive integers:\n\n   (p^(a-1) * (p-1)) * (q^(b-1) * (q-1))\n\n   For 48, p = 2, a = 4, q = 3, and b = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n   (2^(4-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(1-1) * (3-1)) = (8 * 1) * (1 * 2) = 16\n\n4. Subtract the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups: 16 - 5 = 11\n\nSo, there are 11 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nIn total, there are 5 abelian groups + 11 non-abelian groups = 16 non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
