    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given differential equation, we first need to find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is formed by replacing the derivatives with powers of $r$:\n\n$$\nr^2 - 6r + 9 = 0.\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$$\nr = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},\n$$\n\nwhere $a = 1$, $b = -6$, and $c = 9$. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n$$\nr = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(1)(9)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 36}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm 0}{2}.\n$$\n\nSince there is only one distinct root, $r = 3$, the general solution of the given differential equation is:\n\n$$\ny(x) = (A + Bx)e^{3x},\n$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are arbitrary complex constants."
