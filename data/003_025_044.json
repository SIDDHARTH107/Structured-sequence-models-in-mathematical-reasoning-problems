    "message_1": "A boat travels at a speed of 15 km/hr in a direction of 60 degrees east of north. What is the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity relative to the water?",
    "message_2": "The boat's velocity relative to the water can be represented as a vector. We can break down this vector into its components in the north and east directions.\n\nThe northward component of the velocity (Vn) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVn = V * cos(θ)\n\nWhere V is the magnitude of the velocity (15 km/hr) and θ is the angle (60 degrees) east of north.\n\nVn = 15 * cos(60) = 15 * 0.5 = 7.5 km/hr\n\nThe eastward component of the velocity (Ve) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVe = V * sin(θ)\n\nVe = 15 * sin(60) = 15 * (√3/2) = 15 * 0.866 = 12.99 km/hr\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the boat's velocity relative to the water using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nMagnitude = √(Vn² + Ve²) = √(7.5² + 12.99²) = √(56.25 + 168.72) = √224.97 ≈ 14.998 km/hr\n\nTo find the direction, we can use the arctangent function:\n\nDirection = arctan(Ve / Vn) = arctan(12.99 / 7.5) = 60 degrees east of north\n\nSo, the magnitude of the boat's velocity relative to the water is approximately 14.998 km/hr, and the direction is 60 degrees east of north."
