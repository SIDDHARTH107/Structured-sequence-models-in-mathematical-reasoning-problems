    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C, respectively. In this case, we have a = 7, b = 9, and c = 12. We want to find the measure of angle B.\n\nUsing the law of cosines, we have:\n\nb^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac * cos(B)\n\nWe can plug in the values of a, b, and c:\n\n9^2 = 7^2 + 12^2 - 2 * 7 * 12 * cos(B)\n\n81 = 49 + 144 - 168 * cos(B)\n\nNow, we can solve for cos(B):\n\n32 = 168 * cos(B)\n\ncos(B) = 32 / 168\n\ncos(B) ≈ 0.190476\n\nNow, we can find the measure of angle B by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value we found for cos(B):\n\nB = arccos(0.190476)\n\nB ≈ 79.19°\n\nSo, the measure of the angle opposite the side with length 9 is approximately 79.19°."
