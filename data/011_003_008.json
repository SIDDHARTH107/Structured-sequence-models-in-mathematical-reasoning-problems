    "message_2": "In Pascal's Triangle, the value of an entry can be found using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the row number (starting from 0), k is the entry number (starting from 0), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nFor the 10th row and the 7th entry, we have n = 10 and k = 6 (since we start counting from 0).\n\nC(10, 6) = 10! / (6!(10-6)!)\nC(10, 6) = 10! / (6!4!)\nC(10, 6) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\nC(10, 6) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (6 × 5 × 4)\nC(10, 6) = 5040 / 720\nC(10, 6) = 7\n\nSo, the value of the 10th row and the 7th entry in Pascal's Triangle is 7."
