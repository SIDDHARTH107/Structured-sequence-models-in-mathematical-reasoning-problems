    "message_1": "In a certain neighborhood, the probability of a robbery occurring on any given day is 0.05. What is the probability that there will be no robbery in this neighborhood in 30 consecutive days?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of no robbery occurring in the neighborhood in 30 consecutive days, we need to find the probability of the complementary event (no robbery) happening each day and then multiply those probabilities together for all 30 days.\n\nThe probability of no robbery occurring on any given day is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of this happening for 30 consecutive days. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities together:\n\n0.95^30 â‰ˆ 0.2146\n\nSo, the probability of no robbery occurring in the neighborhood in 30 consecutive days is approximately 21.46%."
