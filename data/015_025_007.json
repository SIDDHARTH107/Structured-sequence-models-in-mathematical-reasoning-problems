    "message_1": "A math student is studying the chaotic behavior of the forced van der Pol oscillator with the following differential equation:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - \\mu(1-x^2)\\frac{dx}{dt} + x = A\\cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nwhere $\\mu=1$, $A=2$, $\\omega=\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$ and the initial conditions are $x(0)=0$ and $\\dfrac{dx}{dt}(0)=0.1$.\n\nThe student needs to find the amplitude of the steady-state response of this oscillator.",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude of the steady-state response of the forced van der Pol oscillator, we first need to find the particular solution of the given differential equation. Since the forcing function is a cosine function, we assume a particular solution of the form:\n\n$$x_p(t) = X\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$$\n\nwhere $X$ is the amplitude and $\\phi$ is the phase shift. Now, we need to find the first and second derivatives of $x_p(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{dx_p}{dt} = -X\\omega\\sin(\\omega t - \\phi)$$\n$$\\frac{d^2x_p}{dt^2} = -X\\omega^2\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$$\n\nSubstitute these derivatives and the given values of $\\mu$, $A$, and $\\omega$ into the differential equation:\n\n$$-X\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{2} - \\phi\\right) - (1 - X^2\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{2} - \\phi\\right))(-X\\pi\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{2} - \\phi\\right)) + X\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{2} - \\phi\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{2}\\right)$$\n\nNow, equate the coefficients of the cosine and sine terms:\n\n$$-X\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\right) + X = 2$$\n$$-X\\pi(1 - X^2\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{2} - \\phi\\right)) = 0$$\n\nSolve the first equation for $X$:\n\n$$X\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{4} - 1\\right) = 2$$\n$$X = \\frac{2}{\\frac{\\pi^2}{4} - 1}$$\n\nSince the second equation is multiplied by $-X\\pi$, it will be satisfied as long as the first equation is satisfied. Therefore, the amplitude of the steady-state response is:\n\n$$X = \\frac{2}{\\frac{\\pi^2}{4} - 1}$$"
