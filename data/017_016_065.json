    "message_2": "To show that there exists an element a in G such that a has order 27, we will use the Sylow theorems. \n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. For any prime power p^k that divides the order of a group G (|G|), there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of order p^k in G.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups in G, denoted by n_p, satisfies the following conditions:\n   a) n_p divides the index [G : P], where P is a Sylow p-subgroup.\n   b) n_p is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nNow, let's apply the Sylow theorems to our group G of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, we have a prime power p^k = 3^3. By the first Sylow theorem, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup P of order 3^3 = 27 in G.\n\nLet n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G. By the third Sylow theorem, n_3 must divide the index [G : P] = |G|/|P| = 27/27 = 1. The only divisor of 1 is 1 itself, so n_3 = 1. Also, n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3, which is satisfied since 1 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\n\nSince n_3 = 1, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup in G, which is P. By the second Sylow theorem, all Sylow 3-subgroups are conjugate to each other, but since there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, P is a normal subgroup of G. In other words, P is unique.\n\nNow, we know that P is a subgroup of G with order 27, and it is normal in G. Since |P| = |G|, we have P = G. Therefore, G is a group of order 27, and it is isomorphic to a Sylow 3-subgroup of itself.\n\nRecall that a group of order p^k, where p is prime, is called a p-group. It is a well-known fact that p-groups have non-trivial center (i.e., the center of the group has more than just the identity element). In our case, G is a 3-group, so its center Z(G) is non-trivial.\n\nLet a be an element in Z(G) such that a ≠ e (the identity element). Since a is in the center of G, it commutes with all elements of G. The order of a, denoted by |a|, must divide the order of G, which is 27. The possible orders of a are 1, 3, 9, and 27. Since a ≠ e, the order of a cannot be 1. \n\nNow, let's assume that the order of a is 3 or 9. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by a, denoted by <a>, has order 3 or 9, respectively. Since <a> is a subgroup of G, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of <a> must divide the order of G. However, if the order of <a> is 3 or 9, then G would have a proper non-trivial subgroup, which contradicts the fact that G is a simple group (i.e., it has no proper non-trivial normal subgroups). Therefore, the order of a cannot be 3 or 9.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that the order of a is 27. Thus, there exists an element a in G such that a has order 27. Since a has order 27, it generates a cyclic subgroup of order 27, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27."
