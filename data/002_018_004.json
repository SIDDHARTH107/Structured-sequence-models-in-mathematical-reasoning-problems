    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to find its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half the side length of the cube.\n\nRadius = Side length of cube / 2\nRadius = 6 units / 2\nRadius = 3 units\n\nNow we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nVolume = (4/3) * π * (3 units)^3\nVolume = (4/3) * π * 27 cubic units\nVolume ≈ 36π cubic units\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 113.10 cubic units."
