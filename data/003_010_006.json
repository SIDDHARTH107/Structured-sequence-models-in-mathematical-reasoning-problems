    "message_1": "A student standing 20 meters away from a tree measures an angle of elevation of 30 degrees between the ground and the top of the tree. What is the approximate height of the tree? Round your answer to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tree, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 30 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the tree (which we want to find), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance between the student and the tree, which is 20 meters.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(30°) = height / 20\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 20:\n\nheight = 20 * tan(30°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 30 degrees:\n\ntan(30°) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can multiply this value by 20 to find the height:\n\nheight ≈ 20 * 0.577\nheight ≈ 11.54\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the approximate height of the tree is 12 meters."
