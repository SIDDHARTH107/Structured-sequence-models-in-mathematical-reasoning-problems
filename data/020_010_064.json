    "message_1": "An airline company operates a fleet of five airplanes that make daily flights from City A to City B. The airline wants to minimize its fuel expense while making sure that each flight is guaranteed to arrive on time. The airplanes' fuel consumption varies from flight to flight, and the airline knows the range of possible fuel consumption for each flight. The flight times are deterministic, i.e., the airline knows exactly how long each flight will take. What is the best allocation of fuel to each airplane for each flight that minimizes the total fuel cost of the airline while ensuring that each flight always arrives on time?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total fuel cost while ensuring that each flight always arrives on time, the airline should allocate fuel to each airplane based on the minimum fuel consumption for each flight. This can be done by following these steps:\n\n1. Identify the range of possible fuel consumption for each flight.\n2. Allocate the minimum fuel consumption value from the range to each airplane for each flight.\n3. Ensure that the allocated fuel is sufficient for each airplane to complete its flight and arrive on time.\n\nLet's denote the range of possible fuel consumption for each flight as follows:\n\n- Flight 1: [F1_min, F1_max]\n- Flight 2: [F2_min, F2_max]\n- Flight 3: [F3_min, F3_max]\n- Flight 4: [F4_min, F4_max]\n- Flight 5: [F5_min, F5_max]\n\nThe best allocation of fuel to each airplane for each flight would be:\n\n- Airplane 1: F1_min\n- Airplane 2: F2_min\n- Airplane 3: F3_min\n- Airplane 4: F4_min\n- Airplane 5: F5_min\n\nBy allocating the minimum fuel consumption value for each flight, the airline can minimize its total fuel cost while ensuring that each flight arrives on time."
