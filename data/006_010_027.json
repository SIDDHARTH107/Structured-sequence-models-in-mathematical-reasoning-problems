    "message_1": "Out of a population of 10,000 individuals, 800 are over the age of 60 and 200 of them have been diagnosed with a certain disease. What is the probability of an individual over the age of 60 being affected by the disease?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of an individual over the age of 60 being affected by the disease, we need to divide the number of individuals over the age of 60 with the disease by the total number of individuals over the age of 60.\n\nProbability = (Number of individuals over 60 with the disease) / (Total number of individuals over 60)\n\nProbability = 200 / 800\n\nProbability = 0.25 or 25%\n\nSo, the probability of an individual over the age of 60 being affected by the disease is 25%."
