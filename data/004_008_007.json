    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = 3x² + 2x - 4 at x = 5, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x and then evaluate it at x = 5.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = 3x² + 2x - 4 with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x² + 2x - 4)/dx = 6x + 2\n\nNow, we need to evaluate f'(x) at x = 5:\n\nf'(5) = 6(5) + 2 = 30 + 2 = 32\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = 3x² + 2x - 4 at x = 5 is 32."
