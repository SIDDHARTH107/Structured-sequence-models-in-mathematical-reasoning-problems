    "message_1": "A survey shows that 35% of people in a certain market prefer brand A of a specific product. If you randomly select 10 people from this market, what is the probability that exactly 6 of them will prefer brand A?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, people preferring brand A)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of people selected, which is 10)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of people preferring brand A, which is 6)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of preferring brand A, which is 0.35)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of not preferring brand A, which is 0.65)\n\nPlugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(X = 6) = C(10, 6) * 0.35^6 * 0.65^4\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(10, 6), which is the number of ways to choose 6 people out of 10:\n\nC(10, 6) = 10! / (6! * (10-6)!)\n          = 10! / (6! * 4!)\n          = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n          = 210\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 6) = 210 * 0.35^6 * 0.65^4\n          ≈ 210 * 0.001838 * 0.178506\n          ≈ 0.0694\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 6 out of 10 people will prefer brand A is approximately 0.0694 or 6.94%."
