    "message_2": "To solve the equation, we can use the properties of logarithms. Specifically, we can use the property log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b):\n\nlog((2x+10)/(x+5)) = 1\n\nNow, we can remove the logarithm by raising both sides of the equation to the base 10:\n\n(2x+10)/(x+5) = 10^1\n\n(2x+10)/(x+5) = 10\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply:\n\n2x + 10 = 10(x + 5)\n\n2x + 10 = 10x + 50\n\nNow, we can isolate the variable x:\n\n-8x = -40\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, the solution for x is 5."
