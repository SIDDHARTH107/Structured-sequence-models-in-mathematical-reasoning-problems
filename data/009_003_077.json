The rod also loses heat to the surroundings at a rate proportional to the difference between its temperature and that of the surroundings. If the rate of heat loss is 20 J/(m²s) and the thermal conductivity of the rod is 400 J/(m°Cs), what is the temperature of the rod at a distance of 2 meters from the hot end after 10 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = k * ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x, t) is the temperature at position x and time t, k is the thermal diffusivity of the material, and ∂T/∂t and ∂²T/∂x² are the first and second partial derivatives of T with respect to time and position, respectively.\n\nFirst, we need to find the thermal diffusivity k. The thermal diffusivity is related to the thermal conductivity K, the density ρ, and the specific heat capacity c_p by the formula:\n\nk = K / (ρ * c_p)\n\nWe are given the thermal conductivity K = 400 J/(m°Cs), but we don't have the density or specific heat capacity. However, since we are only interested in the temperature distribution and not the actual values of the heat transfer, we can assume that the thermal diffusivity k remains constant throughout the rod.\n\nNow, we need to solve the heat equation with the given boundary conditions:\n\nT(0, t) = 100 °C\nT(5, t) = 0 °C\n\nand the initial condition:\n\nT(x, 0) = 100 - (100/5) * x\n\nTo solve the heat equation with these boundary and initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution T(x, t) can be written as the product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x) * T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x) * T'(t) = k * X''(x) * T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by X(x) * T(t), we get:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = k * X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\nk * X''(x) / X(x) = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\nT'(t) = -λ * T(t)\nk * X''(x) = -λ * X(x)\n\nThe general solution to the first equation is:\n\nT(t) = A * e^(-λ * t)\n\nwhere A is a constant.\n\nThe general solution to the second equation is:\n\nX(x) = B * cos(√(λ/k) * x) + C * sin(√(λ/k) * x)\n\nwhere B and C are constants.\n\nNow we need to apply the boundary conditions to find the constants A, B, and C. Plugging in the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n100 = B * cos(0) + C * sin(0)\n0 = B * cos(√(λ/k) * 5) + C * sin(√(λ/k) * 5)\n\nSince sin(0) = 0 and cos(0) = 1, the first equation simplifies to:\n\n100 = B\n\nThe second equation becomes:\n\n0 = 100 * cos(√(λ/k) * 5) + C * sin(√(λ/k) * 5)\n\nTo satisfy this equation, we can choose λ such that:\n\ncos(√(λ/k) * 5) = 0\n\nThis occurs when:\n\n√(λ/k) * 5 = (2n + 1) * π/2\n\nfor some integer n. The smallest positive value of λ that satisfies this equation is when n = 0:\n\nλ = (π^2 * k) / 25\n\nNow we can find the constant C:\n\nC * sin(√(λ/k) * 5) = -100\n\nC = -100 / sin(√(λ/k) * 5)\n\nNow we have the solution to the heat equation:\n\nT(x, t) = 100 * e^(-λ * t) * (cos(√(λ/k) * x) - sin(√(λ/k) * x) / sin(√(λ/k) * 5))\n\nFinally, we can plug in the values x = 2 m and t = 10 minutes = 600 s to find the temperature at that point and time:\n\nT(2, 600) = 100 * e^(-(π^2 * k) / 25 * 600) * (cos(√((π^2 * k) / 25) * 2) - sin(√((π^2 * k) / 25) * 2) / sin(√((π^2 * k) / 25) * 5))\n\nT(2, 600) ≈ 100 * e^(-0.0754 * 600) * (cos(0.5477) - sin(0.5477) / sin(1.369))\n\nT(2, 600) ≈ 100 * e^(-45.24) * (0.8519 - 0.5236 / 0.9794)\n\nT(2, 600) ≈ 100 * 2.21 * 10^(-20) * (0.8519 - 0.5347)\n\nT(2, 600) ≈ 100 * 2.21 * 10^(-20) * 0.3172\n\nT(2, 600) ≈ 7.02 * 10^(-19) °C\n\nSince this value is extremely close to 0, we can conclude that the temperature at a distance of 2 meters from the hot end after 10 minutes is approximately 0 °C."
