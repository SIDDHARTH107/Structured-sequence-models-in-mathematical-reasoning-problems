    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid generated by rotating the pyramid about an axis passing through one of its edges that is perpendicular to the base, we can use the Pappus's centroid theorem. This theorem states that the volume of a solid generated by revolving a plane figure about an external axis is equal to the product of the area of the figure and the distance traveled by its centroid during the rotation.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the pyramid's base. Since it's a square with side length 4 cm, the area is:\n\nA = 4 * 4 = 16 square cm\n\nNow, let's find the centroid of the pyramid's base. For a square, the centroid is located at the intersection of its diagonals. The distance from the centroid to the midpoint of the edge of the square is half of the diagonal length. To find the diagonal length, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nd = √(4^2 + 4^2) = √(16 + 16) = √32\n\nNow, the distance from the centroid to the midpoint of the edge is half of the diagonal length:\n\ndistance = d / 2 = √32 / 2 = √8\n\nSince the pyramid is rotated about an axis passing through one of its edges that is perpendicular to the base, the centroid of the base will travel along a circle with a radius equal to the distance we just found. The circumference of this circle is:\n\nC = 2 * π * √8\n\nNow, we can apply Pappus's centroid theorem to find the volume of the solid generated by rotating the pyramid:\n\nVolume = Area * Circumference = 16 * (2 * π * √8)\n\nVolume = 32 * π * √8\n\nNow, let's round the answer to the nearest hundredth:\n\nVolume ≈ 179.67 cubic cm"
