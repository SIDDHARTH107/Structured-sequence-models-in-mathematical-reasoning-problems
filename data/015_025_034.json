    "message_1": "A researcher is studying the forced van der Pol oscillator, which is described by the following differential equation:\n\ny'' - μ(1-y^2)y' + ω^2y = A cos(βt)\n\nwhere y is the displacement of the oscillator from its equilibrium position, t is time, μ, ω, A, and β are constants.\n\nAssuming μ = 0.25, ω = 1, A = 1, and β = 4, find the amplitude of the oscillator when the forcing frequency matches the natural frequency of the oscillator (i.e., ω = β). Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "When the forcing frequency matches the natural frequency of the oscillator (ω = β), the differential equation becomes:\n\ny'' - μ(1-y^2)y' + ω^2y = A cos(ωt)\n\nGiven μ = 0.25, ω = 1, and A = 1, the equation becomes:\n\ny'' - 0.25(1-y^2)y' + y = cos(t)\n\nTo find the amplitude of the oscillator, we need to find the steady-state solution of the differential equation. We assume a solution of the form:\n\ny(t) = Y*cos(t + φ)\n\nwhere Y is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. Taking the first and second derivatives of y(t) with respect to t, we get:\n\ny'(t) = -Y*sin(t + φ)\ny''(t) = -Y*cos(t + φ)\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the differential equation, we get:\n\n-Y*cos(t + φ) - 0.25(1-Y^2)*(-Y*sin(t + φ)) + Y*cos(t + φ) = cos(t)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nY*cos(t + φ) - 0.25Y(1-Y^2)*sin(t + φ) = cos(t)\n\nNow, we equate the coefficients of the cosine and sine terms on both sides of the equation:\n\nY = 1 (for the cosine terms)\n-0.25Y(1-Y^2) = 0 (for the sine terms)\n\nSince Y = 1, the sine term equation becomes:\n\n-0.25(1-Y^2) = 0\n\nSolving for Y, we get:\n\n1 - Y^2 = 0\nY^2 = 1\nY = ±1\n\nSince the amplitude cannot be negative, we choose the positive value:\n\nY = 1\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the oscillator when the forcing frequency matches the natural frequency is 1.00 (rounded to two decimal places)."
