    "message_2": "It is not possible for a group of order 10 to be isomorphic to the group of permutations of five elements. The group of permutations of five elements is the symmetric group S_5, which has order 5! = 120, not 10. \n\nHowever, if you meant to ask for a subgroup of S_5 that has order 10, then we can find one and show it is isomorphic to a known group of order 10.\n\nThe only group of order 10 (up to isomorphism) is the dihedral group D_5, which is the group of symmetries of a regular pentagon. D_5 can be represented as the set of all permutations of the form {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} that can be obtained by rotating or reflecting a regular pentagon with vertices labeled 1 through 5.\n\nD_5 has 10 elements: 5 rotations (including the identity) and 5 reflections. The rotations are given by the cyclic permutations (12345), (13524), (15243), (12453), and the identity permutation (1)(2)(3)(4)(5). The reflections are given by the permutations (15)(24), (25)(34), (35)(41), (45)(12), and (51)(23).\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup H of S_5 generated by the permutations (12345) and (15)(24). H has at most 10 elements since D_5 has order 10. Moreover, the elements of H are distinct, so H has exactly 10 elements. Thus, H is a subgroup of S_5 of order 10.\n\nTo show that H is isomorphic to D_5, we can define an isomorphism φ: D_5 → H as follows:\n\n1. Map the identity element of D_5 to the identity element of H: φ((1)(2)(3)(4)(5)) = (1)(2)(3)(4)(5).\n2. Map the rotations of D_5 to the corresponding rotations in H: φ((12345)) = (12345), φ((13524)) = (13524), φ((15243)) = (15243), and φ((12453)) = (12453).\n3. Map the reflections of D_5 to the corresponding reflections in H: φ((15)(24)) = (15)(24), φ((25)(34)) = (25)(34), φ((35)(41)) = (35)(41), φ((45)(12)) = (45)(12), and φ((51)(23)) = (51)(23).\n\nIt is easy to verify that φ is a bijection and that it preserves the group operation, i.e., φ(ab) = φ(a)φ(b) for all a, b in D_5. Therefore, φ is an isomorphism, and H is isomorphic to D_5."
