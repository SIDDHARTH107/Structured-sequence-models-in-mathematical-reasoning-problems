    "message_1": "You are given the partial differential equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = 3 ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwith the initial condition:\n\nu(x,0) = sin(x)\n\nFind the solution u(x,t) using the method of separation of variables. Then, evaluate u(x,t) at x=π/2 and t=2. Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the method of separation of variables, we assume that the solution u(x,t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we substitute this into the given PDE:\n\n∂u/∂t = 3 ∂²u/∂x²\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = 3 T(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 3XT:\n\n(1/3T)∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\n(1/3T)∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²\n(1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²X(x)\n∂T(t)/∂t = -3λ²T(t)\n\nSolving the first ODE, we get:\n\nX(x) = A sin(λx) + B cos(λx)\n\nApplying the initial condition u(x,0) = sin(x), we have:\n\nsin(x) = X(x)T(0) = (A sin(λx) + B cos(λx))T(0)\n\nComparing the coefficients, we get A = 1, B = 0, and λ = 1. So, X(x) = sin(x).\n\nNow, we solve the second ODE:\n\n∂T(t)/∂t = -3λ²T(t)\n∂T(t)/∂t = -3T(t)\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\nT(t) = C exp(-3t)\n\nThus, the solution u(x,t) is:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t) = sin(x) exp(-3t)\n\nNow, we evaluate u(x,t) at x=π/2 and t=2:\n\nu(π/2, 2) = sin(π/2) exp(-3*2) = 1 * exp(-6) ≈ 0.00248\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the answer is 0.00."
