    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = (2x + 1)^3 with respect to x, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if we have a composite function f(g(x)), then the derivative of f with respect to x is given by:\n\nf'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nIn this case, we have f(u) = u^3 and g(x) = 2x + 1. So, we need to find the derivatives of f(u) and g(x) with respect to their respective variables.\n\nf'(u) = d(u^3)/du = 3u^2\ng'(x) = d(2x + 1)/dx = 2\n\nNow, we can apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)\nf'(x) = (3(2x + 1)^2) * 2\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = 6(2x + 1)^2"
