Raise each ASCII code to the power of e (the encryption exponent) and then take the remainder when divided by n (the modulus).\n\nLet's do this step by step:\n\n1. Convert \"HELLO\" to ASCII codes:\nH - 72\nE - 69\nL - 76\nL - 76\nO - 79\n\n2. Encrypt each ASCII code using the public key (e = 17, n = 55):\nEncrypted H: 72^17 % 55 = 23\nEncrypted E: 69^17 % 55 = 52\nEncrypted L: 76^17 % 55 = 41\nEncrypted L: 76^17 % 55 = 41\nEncrypted O: 79^17 % 55 = 49\n\nThe encrypted message is the sequence of these encrypted numbers: 23, 52, 41, 41, 49."
