    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the algebraic surface at the point (1, -1, 0), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xyz - 1. Then, we need to find the partial derivatives of F with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x + 2yz\n∂F/∂y = 2y + 2xz\n∂F/∂z = 2z + 2xy\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1, -1, 0):\n\n∂F/∂x(1, -1, 0) = 2(1) + 2(-1)(0) = 2\n∂F/∂y(1, -1, 0) = 2(-1) + 2(1)(0) = -2\n∂F/∂z(1, -1, 0) = 2(0) + 2(1)(-1) = -2\n\nThe gradient of F at the point (1, -1, 0) is given by the vector (2, -2, -2). This gradient is normal to the tangent plane at the point (1, -1, 0). Therefore, the equation of the tangent plane can be written as:\n\n2(x - 1) - 2(y + 1) - 2(z - 0) = 0\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2x - 2y - 2z = 0"
