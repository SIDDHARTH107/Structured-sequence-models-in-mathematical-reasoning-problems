    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety V, we need to compute the partial derivatives of both equations with respect to x and y, and then solve the system of equations formed by setting these partial derivatives equal to zero.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 - 3 and g(x, y) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + y. We compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x - 2y\n∂f/∂y = -2x + 2y\n∂g/∂x = 3x^2 - 6x + 2\n∂g/∂y = 1\n\nNow we set these partial derivatives equal to zero and solve the system of equations:\n\n2x - 2y = 0\n-2x + 2y = 0\n3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0\n1 = 0\n\nThe last equation, 1 = 0, is a contradiction, which means there are no singular points for the algebraic variety V."
