    "message_2": "To find the vertex, x-intercepts, and y-intercept of the absolute value equation y = |2x - 4| + 3, we will first analyze the equation and rewrite it in a more convenient form.\n\nThe equation y = |2x - 4| + 3 represents a transformation of the basic absolute value function y = |x|. The function is shifted 4 units to the right and 3 units up. The vertex of the function is the point where the absolute value function changes its direction. \n\nTo find the vertex, we can set the expression inside the absolute value to 0:\n\n2x - 4 = 0\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nNow we can plug this x-value back into the equation to find the corresponding y-value:\n\ny = |2(2) - 4| + 3\ny = |0| + 3\ny = 3\n\nSo, the vertex of the function is (2, 3).\n\nNext, we will find the x-intercepts. To do this, we set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = |2x - 4| + 3\n-3 = |2x - 4|\n\nSince the absolute value of a number cannot be negative, there are no x-intercepts for this function.\n\nFinally, we will find the y-intercept. To do this, we set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = |2(0) - 4| + 3\ny = |-4| + 3\ny = 4 + 3\ny = 7\n\nSo, the y-intercept of the function is (0, 7).\n\nIn summary, the vertex of the absolute value equation y = |2x - 4| + 3 is (2, 3), there are no x-intercepts, and the y-intercept is (0, 7)."
