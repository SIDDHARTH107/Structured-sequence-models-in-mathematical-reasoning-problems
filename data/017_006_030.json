    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 35, we know that |G| = 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are prime numbers. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exist subgroups of G of orders 5 and 7, say H and K, respectively.\n\nLet n_5 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups and n_7 be the number of Sylow 7-subgroups. By Sylow's third theorem, we have:\n\n1. n_5 divides 7 and n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n2. n_7 divides 5 and n_7 is congruent to 1 modulo 7.\n\nFrom condition 1, we see that n_5 can only be 1 since it must divide 7 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Similarly, from condition 2, we see that n_7 can only be 1 since it must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7.\n\nSince n_5 = n_7 = 1, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup in G. Let H be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup and K be the unique Sylow 7-subgroup. Since H and K are the only subgroups of their respective orders, they must be normal in G.\n\nNow, consider the product HK of elements from H and K. Since H and K are normal in G, the product HK is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of H and K are relatively prime (5 and 7), by the product formula for the order of a subgroup, we have |HK| = |H||K| = 5 * 7 = 35.\n\nSince |HK| = |G|, we have HK = G. Thus, G is the internal direct product of H and K. Since both H and K are cyclic (as they are groups of prime order), G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic (if there exists an element of order 35) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
