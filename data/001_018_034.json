    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression log(base 2)[(2^5)/(2^3 * 2^2)], we can first simplify the expression inside the logarithm.\n\n(2^5)/(2^3 * 2^2) = (2^5)/(2^(3+2)) = 2^(5-5) = 2^0\n\nSince any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, we have:\n\nlog(base 2)[(2^5)/(2^3 * 2^2)] = log(base 2)[2^0] = log(base 2)[1]\n\nNow, we know that the logarithm of 1 to any base is always 0, so:\n\nlog(base 2)[1] = 0\n\nTherefore, the simplified logarithmic expression is 0."
