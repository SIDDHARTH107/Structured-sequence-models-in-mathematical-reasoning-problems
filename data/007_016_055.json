    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. To find the smallest Sophie Germain prime larger than 30, we will check prime numbers greater than 30 and see if 2p + 1 is also prime.\n\nThe prime numbers greater than 30 are 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, and so on. Let's check them one by one:\n\n1. For p = 31, 2p + 1 = 2(31) + 1 = 63, which is not prime (divisible by 3 and 21).\n2. For p = 37, 2p + 1 = 2(37) + 1 = 75, which is not prime (divisible by 3 and 25).\n3. For p = 41, 2p + 1 = 2(41) + 1 = 83, which is prime.\n\nSo, the smallest Sophie Germain prime larger than 30 is 41."
