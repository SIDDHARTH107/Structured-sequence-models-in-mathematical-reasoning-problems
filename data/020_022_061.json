    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The production process for both products requires two types of resources: Resource 1 and Resource 2. The factory has 800 units of Resource 1 and 1200 units of Resource 2 available each production cycle. The production process for Product A requires 4 units of Resource 1 and 6 units of Resource 2, while the production process for Product B requires 6 units of Resource 1 and 3 units of Resource 2. Each unit of product A sells for $10 and each unit of product B sells for $8. What is the optimal production mix for the factory to maximize its revenue?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced and y be the number of units of Product B produced. We want to maximize the revenue, which can be represented by the objective function:\n\nRevenue = 10x + 8y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n4x + 6y ≤ 800 (Resource 1 constraint)\n6x + 3y ≤ 1200 (Resource 2 constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraints)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n4x + 6y = 800\ny = (800 - 4x) / 6\n\n6x + 3y = 1200\ny = (1200 - 6x) / 3\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. We will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:\n\n1) Intersection of Resource 1 and Resource 2 constraints:\n4x + 6y = 800\n6x + 3y = 1200\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 3, we get:\n12x + 18y = 2400\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the modified first equation:\n6x + 15y = 1200\ny = (1200 - 6x) / 15\ny = 80 - 2x/5\n\nSubstituting this into the Resource 1 constraint:\n4x + 6(80 - 2x/5) = 800\n4x + 480 - 12x/5 = 800\n20x - 12x = 1600 - 2400\n8x = 800\nx = 100\n\ny = 80 - 2(100)/5\ny = 80 - 40\ny = 40\n\nSo, the intersection point is (100, 40).\n\n2) Intersection of Resource 1 constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n4x + 6(0) = 800\nx = 200\n\n3) Intersection of Resource 2 constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n6(0) + 3y = 1200\ny = 400\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are (0, 400), (200, 0), and (100, 40).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function (Revenue) at each vertex:\n\n1) (0, 400):\nRevenue = 10(0) + 8(400) = 0 + 3200 = $3200\n\n2) (200, 0):\nRevenue = 10(200) + 8(0) = 2000 + 0 = $2000\n\n3) (100, 40):\nRevenue = 10(100) + 8(40) = 1000 + 320 = $1320\n\nThe optimal production mix is to produce 0 units of Product A and 400 units of Product B, which will result in a maximum revenue of $3200."
