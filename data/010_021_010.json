    "message_2": "To find the symplectic area enclosed by the curve γ(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), 2t) for t ∈ [0, 2π] in R³, we first need to compute the symplectic form ω on R³. In this case, the standard symplectic form on R³ is given by:\n\nω = dx ∧ dy + dz ∧ dw\n\nHowever, our curve γ(t) is only defined in terms of (x, y, z) coordinates. To compute the symplectic area, we need to find a suitable 2-dimensional subspace of R³ that the curve lies in. We can do this by finding the tangent vector to the curve and then taking the symplectic orthogonal complement.\n\nFirst, compute the tangent vector to the curve:\n\nγ'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 2)\n\nNow, we need to find a vector that is orthogonal to γ'(t) with respect to the symplectic form ω. Since ω = dx ∧ dy + dz ∧ dw, we can see that the vector (2, 0, -cos(t), sin(t)) is orthogonal to γ'(t) with respect to ω:\n\nω(γ'(t), (2, 0, -cos(t), sin(t))) = (-sin(t))(0) + (cos(t))(-cos(t)) + 2(sin(t)) = 0\n\nNow, we have a 2-dimensional subspace of R³ spanned by the vectors γ'(t) and (2, 0, -cos(t), sin(t)). To compute the symplectic area enclosed by the curve, we need to integrate the symplectic form ω over this subspace along the curve γ(t) for t ∈ [0, 2π]:\n\n∫₀²π ω(γ'(t), (2, 0, -cos(t), sin(t))) dt = ∫₀²π 0 dt = 0\n\nSo, the symplectic area enclosed by the curve γ(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), 2t) for t ∈ [0, 2π] in R³ is 0."
