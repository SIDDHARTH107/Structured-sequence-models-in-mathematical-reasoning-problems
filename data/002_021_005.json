    "message_1": "The central angle of a circle sector is 120 degrees and the radius of the circle is 8 cm. What is the area of the sector?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r^2\n\nwhere the central angle is given as 120 degrees and the radius (r) is 8 cm.\n\nArea of sector = (120 / 360) × π × 8^2\n\nArea of sector = (1/3) × π × 64\n\nArea of sector = 64π/3 cm²\n\nThe area of the sector is approximately 67.03 cm²."
