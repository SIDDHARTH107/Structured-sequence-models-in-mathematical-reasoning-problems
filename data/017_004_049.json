    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order p^2, where p is a prime number (in this case, p = 5). We want to show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n\nFirst, note that the number of elements of order p in G is a multiple of p by the Sylow theorems. Let n_p be the number of elements of order p in G. Then, we have:\n\nn_p ≡ 1 (mod p) and n_p | p^2\n\nSince p is a prime number, the divisors of p^2 are 1, p, and p^2. We know that n_p cannot be 1, because then G would have only one element of order p, which is not possible for a nontrivial group. Therefore, n_p must be either p or p^2.\n\nCase 1: n_p = p^2\nIn this case, every non-identity element of G has order p. Let a, b ∈ G be two non-identity elements such that a ≠ b. Then, the subgroup generated by a and b, denoted by ⟨a, b⟩, has at least p^2 elements, because every element in ⟨a, b⟩ has order p. Since |G| = p^2, we have ⟨a, b⟩ = G. Thus, G is a cyclic group generated by a and b.\n\nCase 2: n_p = p\nIn this case, there are p elements of order p in G. Let H be a subgroup of G with order p. Then, |G:H| = p, and by the Sylow theorems, H is a normal subgroup of G. Let K be another subgroup of G with order p, such that H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Then, the product HK = {hk | h ∈ H, k ∈ K} has p^2 elements, and since |G| = p^2, we have HK = G.\n\nNow, we claim that G is isomorphic to the direct product H × K. Define a map φ: H × K → G by φ(h, k) = hk. We will show that φ is an isomorphism.\n\n1. φ is a homomorphism: Let (h1, k1), (h2, k2) ∈ H × K. Then,\nφ((h1, k1)(h2, k2)) = φ(h1h2, k1k2) = h1h2k1k2.\nSince H is normal in G, we have h2k1 = k1h2. Thus,\nh1h2k1k2 = h1(k1h2)k2 = (h1k1)(h2k2) = φ(h1, k1)φ(h2, k2).\n\n2. φ is injective: Suppose φ(h, k) = e. Then, hk = e, which implies h = k^(-1). Since h ∈ H and k^(-1) ∈ K, we have h = k^(-1) ∈ H ∩ K. But H ∩ K = {e}, so h = k^(-1) = e, and (h, k) = (e, e) is the identity element in H × K.\n\n3. φ is surjective: For any g ∈ G, we can write g = hk, where h ∈ H and k ∈ K (since HK = G). Then, φ(h, k) = hk = g, so φ is surjective.\n\nThus, φ is an isomorphism, and G is isomorphic to the direct product H × K.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order p^2, where p is a prime, is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p."
