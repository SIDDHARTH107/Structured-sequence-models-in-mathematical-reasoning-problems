    "message_1": "Suppose that you are using a Feistel cipher with 3 rounds and a block size of 64 bits. Each of the round keys is 16 bits long. If the 64-bit plaintext input is `1100111101011110`, what would be the ciphertext output after the 3 rounds of encryption with the Feistel cipher?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need more information about the Feistel cipher being used, specifically the round function F and the round keys for each round. The Feistel cipher is a symmetric key algorithm that works by dividing the plaintext into two halves and applying a round function F to one half, then XORing the result with the other half. This process is repeated for a specified number of rounds.\n\nIn this case, we have a 3-round Feistel cipher with a 64-bit plaintext input `1100111101011110`. However, we need the round function F and the 16-bit round keys for each round to compute the ciphertext output. Please provide the round function and round keys to proceed with the calculation."
