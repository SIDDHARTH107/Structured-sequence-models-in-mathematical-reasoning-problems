    "message_1": "A rectangular garden has a length of 12 feet and a width of 8 feet. What is the perimeter of the garden?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you can use the formula P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, the length (L) is 12 feet and the width (W) is 8 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 2(12 + 8)\nP = 2(20)\nP = 40 feet\n\nSo, the perimeter of the garden is 40 feet."
