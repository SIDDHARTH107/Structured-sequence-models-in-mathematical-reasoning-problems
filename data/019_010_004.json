    "message_2": "To solve this linear logic formula, we will use the basic rules of linear logic. The main idea is to use the cut rule to eliminate the common term B from both sides of the linear implication.\n\n1. (A ⊗ B) ⊸ B , A ⊗ (C ⊸ B)\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the formula using the cut rule:\n\n2. (A ⊗ B) ⊸ B , A ⊗ (C ⊸ B) |- B\n\nNow, we will use the cut rule on A:\n\n3. (A ⊗ B) ⊸ B , (C ⊸ B) |- A\n\nNext, we will use the cut rule on C:\n\n4. (A ⊗ B) ⊸ B , B |- C\n\nFinally, we will use the cut rule on B:\n\n5. (A ⊗ B) ⊸ B |- B\n\nNow, we can use the definition of linear implication to rewrite the formula:\n\n6. (A ⊗ B) ⊗ B^-1 |- B\n\nSince B ⊗ B^-1 is the identity, we can simplify the formula:\n\n7. A ⊗ B |- B\n\nThis is the final result of the linear logic formula. It states that if we have A ⊗ B, we can deduce B."
