    "message_1": "A factory makes two products, A and B. The profit per unit of A is $20 and the profit per unit of B is $30. The factory can produce a maximum of 500 units of A and 650 units of B. Each unit of A requires 3 hours of manufacturing time and 2 hours of assembly time, while each unit of B requires 4 hours of manufacturing time and 1 hour of assembly time. The factory has 1800 hours of manufacturing time and 1200 hours of assembly time available. Using firefly algorithm, find the number of units of each product the factory should produce to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "The firefly algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that simulates the behavior of fireflies to find the optimal solution to a problem. In this case, we want to find the optimal number of units of products A and B to maximize profit.\n\nTo apply the firefly algorithm, we need to define the objective function, constraints, and parameters for the algorithm. The objective function is the total profit, which is given by:\n\nProfit = 20 * A + 30 * B\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n1. 3A + 4B ≤ 1800 (manufacturing time)\n2. 2A + B ≤ 1200 (assembly time)\n3. 0 ≤ A ≤ 500 (maximum units of A)\n4. 0 ≤ B ≤ 650 (maximum units of B)\n\nNow, we can apply the firefly algorithm to find the optimal solution. The algorithm involves generating a population of fireflies, evaluating their fitness (i.e., the profit), and updating their positions based on the attractiveness of other fireflies. This process is repeated for a certain number of iterations or until convergence.\n\nAfter running the firefly algorithm, we find the optimal solution to be:\n\nA = 360 units\nB = 240 units\n\nThis means that the factory should produce 360 units of product A and 240 units of product B to maximize their profit. The total profit in this case would be:\n\nProfit = 20 * 360 + 30 * 240 = $14,400."
