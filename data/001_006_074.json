    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation y = 2x² + 4x - 3, we first need to find the x-intercepts (the points where the parabola crosses the x-axis). To do this, we set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x² + 4x - 3\n\nTo solve for x, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 4, and c = -3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-4 ± √(4² - 4(2)(-3))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (-4 ± √(16 + 24)) / 4\n\nx = (-4 ± √40) / 4\n\nx = (-4 ± 2√10) / 4\n\nx = -1 ± √10 / 2\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = -1 + √10 / 2 and x = -1 - √10 / 2.\n\nNow, to find the vertex of the parabola, we can use the formula:\n\nx_vertex = -b / 2a\n\nx_vertex = -4 / (2(2))\n\nx_vertex = -4 / 4\n\nx_vertex = -1\n\nTo find the y-coordinate of the vertex, plug the x_vertex back into the original equation:\n\ny_vertex = 2(-1)² + 4(-1) - 3\n\ny_vertex = 2 - 4 - 3\n\ny_vertex = -5\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (-1, -5).\n\nNow we can graph the parabola on a coordinate plane. Plot the vertex (-1, -5) and the x-intercepts (-1 + √10 / 2, 0) and (-1 - √10 / 2, 0). The parabola will be symmetric with respect to the vertical line x = -1, and it will open upwards since the coefficient of the x² term is positive.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the graph:\n\n```\ny\n|\n|                 *\n|              *     *\n|           *         *\n|        *             *\n|     *                 *\n|  *                     *\n|---------------------------\nx\n```\n\nThe exact graph can be plotted using graphing software or a graphing calculator."
