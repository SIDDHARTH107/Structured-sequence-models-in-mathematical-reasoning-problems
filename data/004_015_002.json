    "message_2": "To find the points of inflection, we need to find the second derivative of the function and then determine where it changes its sign.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 12x + 9) = 6x - 12\n\nTo find the points of inflection, we need to find the values of x where the second derivative changes its sign. This occurs when the second derivative is equal to zero:\n\n6x - 12 = 0\n6x = 12\nx = 2\n\nNow we have the x-coordinate of the point of inflection. To find the y-coordinate, we plug this value back into the original function:\n\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 9(2) + 2 = 8 - 24 + 18 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the point of inflection is (2, 4)."
