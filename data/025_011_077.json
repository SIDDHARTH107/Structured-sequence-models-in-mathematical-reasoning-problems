    "message_2": "The statement is incorrect. The group of rational points $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ on an elliptic curve can be infinite even if $a$ and $b$ are both integers. In fact, it is a famous theorem in number theory called Mordell's Theorem which states that the group of rational points on an elliptic curve is always finitely generated. This means that $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ can be written as the sum of a finite torsion subgroup and a free abelian group of finite rank.\n\nTo give a counterexample to the statement, consider the elliptic curve $E$ given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - x$. Here, $a = 0$ and $b = -1$, which are both integers. The rational points on this curve include $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(-1,0)$, and the point at infinity, which is the identity element in the group law of the elliptic curve. However, there are infinitely many more rational points on this curve. For example, the point $(\\frac{5}{4}, \\frac{3}{8})$ is also a rational point on the curve, and there are infinitely many others.\n\nTherefore, the group of rational points $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ being finite is not equivalent to $a$ and $b$ being integers."
