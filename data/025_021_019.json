    "message_1": "Suppose that a mirror pair of Calabi-Yau 3-folds have Hodge numbers h11 = h21 = 387 and h12 = h22 = 3. What is the mirror symmetry's prediction for the number of rational curves of degree d that are contained in a general hypersurface of degree 9 on the ambient projective 5-space?",
    "message_2": "To compute the number of rational curves of degree d on a Calabi-Yau 3-fold, we can use the mirror symmetry and the genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants. According to the mirror symmetry, the generating function for the genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants is given by the Yukawa coupling, which can be computed from the prepotential F.\n\nFor the given Calabi-Yau 3-fold with Hodge numbers h11 = h21 = 387 and h12 = h22 = 3, the prepotential F is a cubic polynomial in the complexified Kähler moduli space, given by:\n\nF = (t1^3 + t2^3 + t3^3)/6 + C * (t1 * t2 * t3),\n\nwhere t1, t2, and t3 are the Kähler parameters, and C is a constant determined by the intersection numbers of the Calabi-Yau 3-fold.\n\nThe Yukawa coupling K is given by the second derivative of F with respect to the Kähler parameters:\n\nK = d^2F/dt1 dt2 = C.\n\nNow, we can compute the generating function for the genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants, which is given by the exponential of the Yukawa coupling:\n\nZ = exp(K) = exp(C).\n\nThe number of rational curves of degree d on the Calabi-Yau 3-fold is given by the coefficient of q^d in the power series expansion of Z, where q = exp(t1 + t2 + t3). Since Z is a constant, its power series expansion has only one term, which is Z itself. Therefore, the number of rational curves of degree d is zero for all d > 0.\n\nIn conclusion, the mirror symmetry's prediction for the number of rational curves of degree d contained in a general hypersurface of degree 9 on the ambient projective 5-space is 0 for all d > 0."
