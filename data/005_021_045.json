The sample mean age was 35 years with a standard deviation of 5 years. Use bootstrapping to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true population mean age.",
    "message_2": "Bootstrapping is a resampling technique that involves drawing random samples with replacement from the original dataset to estimate the population parameter. In this case, we want to estimate the true population mean age and its 95% confidence interval. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. Draw a large number of random samples (e.g., 10,000) with replacement from the original dataset of 10 employees. Each sample should also have 10 employees.\n\n2. Calculate the mean age for each of these 10,000 samples.\n\n3. Arrange the calculated means in ascending order.\n\n4. Find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the means. These percentiles will give us the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nNote that since we don't have the actual data, we cannot perform the bootstrapping procedure. However, we can provide a general formula for the confidence interval using the given information.\n\nGiven:\nSample mean (x̄) = 35 years\nSample standard deviation (s) = 5 years\nSample size (n) = 10 employees\n\nStandard error (SE) = s / √n = 5 / √10 ≈ 1.58\n\nUsing the t-distribution (since the population standard deviation is unknown) and assuming a 95% confidence level, we can find the t-value for a two-tailed test with 9 degrees of freedom (n - 1). From the t-table or using a calculator, the t-value is approximately 2.262.\n\nMargin of error (ME) = t-value * SE ≈ 2.262 * 1.58 ≈ 3.58\n\n95% confidence interval for the true population mean age:\nLower bound = x̄ - ME ≈ 35 - 3.58 ≈ 31.42 years\nUpper bound = x̄ + ME ≈ 35 + 3.58 ≈ 38.58 years\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean age is approximately (31.42, 38.58) years."
