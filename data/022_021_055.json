    "message_2": "To find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = 5/(s^2 + 2s + 10), we first need to rewrite the denominator in the form of a standard Laplace transform of a damped sinusoidal function. The standard form is L{e^(-at)sin(bt)} = b/((s+a)^2 + b^2).\n\n1. Complete the square for the denominator:\n\ns^2 + 2s + 10 = (s + 1)^2 + 9\n\nNow, we have F(s) = 5/((s + 1)^2 + 9).\n\n2. Identify the values of a and b:\n\nIn this case, a = 1 and b = 3.\n\n3. Use the inverse Laplace transform formula:\n\nThe inverse Laplace transform of F(s) is f(t) = L^(-1){5/((s + 1)^2 + 9)} = e^(-at)sin(bt) * (5/b)\n\n4. Substitute the values of a and b:\n\nf(t) = e^(-1*t)sin(3t) * (5/3)\n\nSo, the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) is:\n\nf(t) = (5/3)e^(-t)sin(3t)"
