If person D learns a new fact and person E forgets one fact they knew before, how many people in the group now know exactly 2 facts each?",
    "message_2": "Let's first list the number of facts each person knows before person D learns a new fact and person E forgets one:\n\nPerson A: 5 facts\nPerson B: 3 facts\nPerson C: 2 facts\nPerson D: 1 fact\nPerson E: 1 fact\nPerson F: 1 fact\nPerson G: 1 fact\nPerson H: 1 fact\nPerson I: 1 fact\nPerson J: 1 fact\n\nNow, let's update the list after person D learns a new fact and person E forgets one:\n\nPerson A: 5 facts\nPerson B: 3 facts\nPerson C: 2 facts\nPerson D: 2 facts (1 + 1)\nPerson E: 0 facts (1 - 1)\nPerson F: 1 fact\nPerson G: 1 fact\nPerson H: 1 fact\nPerson I: 1 fact\nPerson J: 1 fact\n\nNow we can count the number of people who know exactly 2 facts each:\n\nPerson C: 2 facts\nPerson D: 2 facts\n\nThere are now 2 people in the group who know exactly 2 facts each."
