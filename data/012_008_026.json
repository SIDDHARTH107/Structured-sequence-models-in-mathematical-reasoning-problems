    "message_2": "Yes, this graph is planar. A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing each other. The given graph can be drawn without any edge crossings. The planar representation of the graph is the same as the given representation:\n\n```\nA -- B -- C\n|    |    |\nD -- E -- F\n```\n\nIn this representation, no edges are crossing each other, so the graph is planar."
