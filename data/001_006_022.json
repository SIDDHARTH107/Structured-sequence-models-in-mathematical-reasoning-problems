    "message_2": "To graph the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 - 6x + 4, we first need to find the vertex, x-intercepts, and y-intercepts.\n\n1. Vertex:\nThe vertex of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c can be found using the formula x = -b/(2a). In this case, a = 2 and b = -6.\n\nx = -(-6) / (2 * 2) = 6 / 4 = 3/2\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate back into the equation:\n\ny = 2(3/2)^2 - 6(3/2) + 4\ny = 2(9/4) - 9 + 4\ny = 9/2 - 9 + 4\ny = 9/2 - 5/2\ny = 4/2\ny = 2\n\nSo, the vertex is at the point (3/2, 2).\n\n2. X-intercepts:\nTo find the x-intercepts, we set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x^2 - 6x + 4\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(2)(4))) / (2 * 2)\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 32)) / 4\nx = (6 ± √4) / 4\nx = (6 ± 2) / 4\n\nThere are two x-intercepts:\nx = (6 + 2) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2\nx = (6 - 2) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are at the points (1, 0) and (2, 0).\n\n3. Y-intercept:\nTo find the y-intercept, we set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 2(0)^2 - 6(0) + 4\ny = 4\n\nSo, the y-intercept is at the point (0, 4).\n\nNow, we can graph the quadratic equation with the vertex at (3/2, 2), x-intercepts at (1, 0) and (2, 0), and y-intercept at (0, 4)."
