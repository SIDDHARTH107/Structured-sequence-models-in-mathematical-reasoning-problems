    "message_1": "A math student needs to show that a group G of order 16 is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C16, D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16. Determine which group G is isomorphic to if it has exactly four elements of order 2.",
    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 16 with exactly four elements of order 2. We will determine which group G is isomorphic to among C16, D8, or a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nFirst, let's recall some facts about groups:\n\n1. The order of an element divides the order of the group (Lagrange's theorem).\n2. A group of order p^n, where p is a prime number, is called a p-group.\n3. The center of a group, Z(G), is the set of all elements that commute with every element in the group.\n4. If G is a p-group, then the center Z(G) is nontrivial (i.e., it contains more than just the identity element).\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information:\n\nSince G has order 16, it is a 2-group (p=2 and n=4). By fact 4, the center Z(G) is nontrivial. Let's consider the possible orders of Z(G):\n\nCase 1: |Z(G)| = 16\nIn this case, Z(G) = G, which means G is abelian. Since G has exactly four elements of order 2, it cannot be isomorphic to C16 (which has only one element of order 2). Therefore, G must be isomorphic to D8 in this case.\n\nCase 2: |Z(G)| = 8\nIn this case, G/Z(G) has order 2, which means G/Z(G) is isomorphic to C2. By the correspondence theorem, G has a normal subgroup N of order 8. Since N has index 2 in G, it is also a maximal subgroup of G. Now, G/N is isomorphic to C2, which means G is a semidirect product of N and C2. Since N is a group of order 8, it is either isomorphic to C8 or D4. If N is isomorphic to C8, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of C8 and C2, which is D8. If N is isomorphic to D4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of D4 and C2, which is a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nCase 3: |Z(G)| = 4\nIn this case, G/Z(G) has order 4, which means G/Z(G) is isomorphic to either C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). If G/Z(G) is isomorphic to C4, then G has a normal subgroup N of order 4. Since N has index 4 in G, it is also a maximal subgroup of G. Now, G/N is isomorphic to C4, which means G is a semidirect product of N and C4. Since N is a group of order 4, it is either isomorphic to C4 or V4. If N is isomorphic to C4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of C4 and C4, which is a non-abelian group of order 16. If N is isomorphic to V4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of V4 and C4, which is also a non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nCase 4: |Z(G)| = 2\nIn this case, G/Z(G) has order 8, which means G/Z(G) is isomorphic to either C8 or D4. However, this case is not possible because the center of a group of order 8 must have at least 4 elements (by fact 4), which contradicts the assumption that |Z(G)| = 2.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either isomorphic to D8 or a non-abelian group of order 16."
