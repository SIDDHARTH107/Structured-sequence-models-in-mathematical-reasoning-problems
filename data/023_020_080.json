    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval -π to π, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n, b_n, and a_0.\n\nThe formulas for the coefficients are:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) = x^2 is an even function, all b_n coefficients will be zero. Now, let's find a_0 and a_n.\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 dx = (1/π) * [(x^3)/3] | (-π, π) = (1/π) * [(π^3)/3 - (-π^3)/3] = (2/3) * π^2\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * cos(nx) dx\n\nTo find a_n, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x^2, dv = cos(nx) dx\n\ndu = 2x dx, v = (1/n) * sin(nx)\n\nNow, we can integrate by parts:\n\n∫[-π, π] x^2 * cos(nx) dx = (x^2 * (1/n) * sin(nx)) | (-π, π) - ∫[-π, π] 2x * (1/n) * sin(nx) dx\n\nThe first term evaluates to zero since sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n. Now, we need to integrate the second term:\n\n∫[-π, π] 2x * (1/n) * sin(nx) dx\n\nAgain, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 2x, dv = (1/n) * sin(nx) dx\n\ndu = 2 dx, v = (-1/n^2) * cos(nx)\n\nNow, we can integrate by parts:\n\n∫[-π, π] 2x * (1/n) * sin(nx) dx = (2x * (-1/n^2) * cos(nx)) | (-π, π) - ∫[-π, π] 2 * (-1/n^2) * cos(nx) dx\n\nThe first term evaluates to zero since cos(nπ) = 1 or -1 for all integer values of n. Now, we need to integrate the second term:\n\n∫[-π, π] 2 * (-1/n^2) * cos(nx) dx = (-2/n^2) * ∫[-π, π] cos(nx) dx = (-2/n^2) * [(1/n) * sin(nx)] | (-π, π)\n\nThis term also evaluates to zero since sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n. Thus, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nSo, the Fourier series for f(x) = x^2 on the interval -π to π is:\n\nf(x) = (2/3) * π^2\n\nNow, we need to show that the series converges uniformly to f(x) for all x in the interval.\n\nSince f(x) = x^2 is continuous and has continuous derivatives of all orders on the interval -π to π, it satisfies the conditions of the Dirichlet's theorem. Therefore, the Fourier series converges uniformly to f(x) = x^2 on the interval -π to π."
