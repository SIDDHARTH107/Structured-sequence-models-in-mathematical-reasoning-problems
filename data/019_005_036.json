    "message_1": "Unfortunately, it is not possible to create a precise numerical problem for epistemic logic as it deals with knowledge and beliefs rather than mathematical calculations. Epistemic logic is a branch of logic that studies reasoning about knowledge and belief. It focuses on how agents reason and communicate about their beliefs and knowledge. Therefore, a problem related to Epistemic logic would involve analyzing reasoning patterns involving beliefs and knowledge rather than numerical calculations.",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are emphasizing the nature of epistemic logic and its focus on knowledge and beliefs rather than numerical calculations. As a mathematician, I am more suited to solving mathematical problems. If you have any mathematical problems or questions, please feel free to ask, and I will be happy to help."
