    "message_2": "To prove that (A × B) × C = A × (B × C), we will first find the Cartesian products of the sets and then show that the resulting sets are equal.\n\nRecall that the Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nFirst, let's find A × B:\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) × C:\n(A × B) × C = {((1, 3), 5), ((1, 3), 6), ((1, 4), 5), ((1, 4), 6), ((2, 3), 5), ((2, 3), 6), ((2, 4), 5), ((2, 4), 6)}\n\nNext, let's find B × C:\nB × C = {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)}\n\nNow, let's find A × (B × C):\nA × (B × C) = {(1, (3, 5)), (1, (3, 6)), (1, (4, 5)), (1, (4, 6)), (2, (3, 5)), (2, (3, 6)), (2, (4, 5)), (2, (4, 6))}\n\nNow, we can rewrite the elements of (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) as triplets instead of nested pairs:\n\n(A × B) × C = {(1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 5), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6)}\n\nA × (B × C) = {(1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 5), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6)}\n\nAs we can see, the resulting sets are equal:\n\n(A × B) × C = A × (B × C)\n\nHence, we have proved that (A × B) × C = A × (B × C) for the given sets A, B, and C."
