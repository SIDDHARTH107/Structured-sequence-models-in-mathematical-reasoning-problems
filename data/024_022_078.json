    "message_2": "To find all isometries of the given Riemannian metric that fix the point $(1,0,0)$, we first note that an isometry is a diffeomorphism that preserves the metric. In other words, if $\\phi: \\mathbb{S}^2 \\to \\mathbb{S}^2$ is an isometry, then for any two points $p, q \\in \\mathbb{S}^2$, we have $g_p(u,v) = g_{\\phi(p)}(d\\phi_p(u), d\\phi_p(v))$ for all tangent vectors $u, v \\in T_p\\mathbb{S}^2$.\n\nSince we are considering isometries that fix the point $(1,0,0)$, we can restrict our attention to the orthogonal group $O(3)$, which consists of all linear transformations that preserve the Euclidean metric in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Specifically, we are interested in the subgroup of $O(3)$ that fixes the point $(1,0,0)$, which is the stabilizer subgroup of $(1,0,0)$.\n\nLet $A \\in O(3)$ be an isometry that fixes $(1,0,0)$. Then, we have $A(1,0,0) = (1,0,0)$. This implies that the first column of $A$ is $(1,0,0)^T$. Now, let $a = (a_1, a_2, a_3)^T$ and $b = (b_1, b_2, b_3)^T$ be the second and third columns of $A$, respectively. Since $A$ is orthogonal, we have:\n\n1. $a \\cdot a = b \\cdot b = 1$ (i.e., $a$ and $b$ are unit vectors)\n2. $a \\cdot b = 0$ (i.e., $a$ and $b$ are orthogonal)\n3. $(1,0,0) \\cdot a = (1,0,0) \\cdot b = 0$ (i.e., $a$ and $b$ are orthogonal to $(1,0,0)$)\n\nFrom the third condition, we have $a_1 = b_1 = 0$. Thus, $a = (0, a_2, a_3)^T$ and $b = (0, b_2, b_3)^T$. The first and second conditions imply that $a_2^2 + a_3^2 = b_2^2 + b_3^2 = 1$ and $a_2b_2 + a_3b_3 = 0$. This means that $a$ and $b$ are unit vectors in the $yz$-plane that are orthogonal to each other.\n\nNow, let $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be the angles between the positive $y$-axis and $a$ and $b$, respectively. Then, we have $a = (0, \\cos\\alpha, \\sin\\alpha)^T$ and $b = (0, \\cos\\beta, \\sin\\beta)^T$. Since $a$ and $b$ are orthogonal, we have $\\cos\\alpha\\cos\\beta + \\sin\\alpha\\sin\\beta = 0$, which implies that $\\beta = \\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, any isometry that fixes $(1,0,0)$ can be represented by a matrix of the form:\n\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\cos\\alpha & -\\sin\\alpha \\\\\n0 & \\sin\\alpha & \\cos\\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix},$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. These are precisely the rotations about the $x$-axis by an angle $\\alpha$. Thus, the isometries of the given Riemannian metric that fix the point $(1,0,0)$ are the rotations about the $x$-axis."
