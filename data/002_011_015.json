    "message_1": "A right triangle has legs measuring 3cm and 4cm. What is the length of the hypotenuse?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, a = 3cm and b = 4cm.\n\nThe formula is: c^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nSubstitute the values:\nc^2 = (3cm)^2 + (4cm)^2\nc^2 = 9cm^2 + 16cm^2\nc^2 = 25cm^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse (c):\nc = âˆš(25cm^2)\nc = 5cm\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse is 5cm."
