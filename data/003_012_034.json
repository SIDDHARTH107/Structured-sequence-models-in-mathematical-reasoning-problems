If the angle of elevation of the telescope to the top of the flag pole is 35 degrees, and the height of the building is 20 meters, what is the height of the flag pole from the ground?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. Let's denote the height of the flag pole as h meters, and the horizontal distance between the building and the flag pole as d meters. We can form a right triangle with the building, the flag pole, and the ground.\n\nThe angle of elevation of the telescope to the top of the flag pole is 35 degrees. So, we have:\n\ntan(35°) = (h - 20) / d\n\nWe need to find the height of the flag pole (h), but first, we need to find the horizontal distance (d) between the building and the flag pole.\n\nTo find d, we can use the complementary angle (90° - 35° = 55°) and the height of the building (20 meters). Using the tangent function again:\n\ntan(55°) = 20 / d\n\nNow, we can solve for d:\n\nd = 20 / tan(55°)\nd ≈ 15.02 meters\n\nNow that we have the value of d, we can find the height of the flag pole (h) using the tangent function with the angle of elevation (35°):\n\ntan(35°) = (h - 20) / 15.02\n\nNow, solve for h:\n\nh - 20 = 15.02 * tan(35°)\nh - 20 ≈ 15.02 * 0.7002\nh - 20 ≈ 10.52\nh ≈ 30.52 meters\n\nSo, the height of the flag pole from the ground is approximately 30.52 meters."
