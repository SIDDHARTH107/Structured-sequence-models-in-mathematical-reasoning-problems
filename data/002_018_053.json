    "message_2": "To find the volume of the sphere inscribed in a cube, we first need to find the diameter of the sphere, which is equal to the side length of the cube. In this case, the side length of the cube is 10 cm, so the diameter of the sphere is also 10 cm.\n\nThe radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, so the radius is 5 cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nSubstitute the radius (5 cm) into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(5)^3\nV = (4/3)π(125)\nV = (500/3)π\n\nThe volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube is approximately 523.6 cubic centimeters."
