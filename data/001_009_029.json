    "message_2": "To solve the algebraic expression for x, we need to simplify the equation and isolate x on one side. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Distribute the numbers outside the parentheses:\n5(x - 3) + 2x = 3(x + 4) + 6\n5x - 15 + 2x = 3x + 12 + 6\n\n2. Combine like terms on each side of the equation:\n7x - 15 = 3x + 18\n\n3. Move the x terms to one side and the constant terms to the other side:\n7x - 3x = 18 + 15\n4x = 33\n\n4. Divide by the coefficient of x to isolate x:\nx = 33 / 4\n\nSo, x = 33/4."
