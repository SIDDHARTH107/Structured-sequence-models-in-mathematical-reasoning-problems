    "message_1": "A cube has a side length of 6 cm. Find the volume of the sphere inscribed inside it. Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed inside the cube, its diameter is equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the radius (r) of the sphere is half of the side length of the cube:\n\nr = 6 cm / 2 = 3 cm\n\nNow we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nV = (4/3)π(3 cm)^3\n\nV = (4/3)π(27 cm^3)\n\nV = 36π cm^3 ≈ 113.10 cm^3\n\nThe volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 113.10 cubic centimeters."
