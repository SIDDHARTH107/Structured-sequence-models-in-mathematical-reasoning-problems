    "message_2": "Let's first find the circumference of the cylindrical surface. The formula for the circumference of a circle is given by C = 2πr, where r is the radius. In this case, the radius is 2 units, so the circumference is C = 2π(2) = 4π units.\n\nNow, we have a circle with diameter equal to the circumference of the cylindrical surface, which is 4π units. The radius of this circle is half of the diameter, so it's r = (4π)/2 = 2π units.\n\nLet's represent a point on this circle in the complex plane as z = re^(iθ), where r = 2π and θ is the angle. Now, we apply the conformal map f(z) = z^2:\n\nf(z) = (2πe^(iθ))^2 = (2π)^2 * e^(2iθ) = 4π^2 * e^(2iθ).\n\nThe image of the circle under the conformal map is a circle with radius 4π^2 and angle 2θ."
