    "message_2": "To find the second Chern class c_2(X) of the complex manifold X, we can use the Chern classes relation for complex manifolds of complex dimension 2, which is given by:\n\nc_2(X) = c_1(X)^2 - 2c_1(X)\n\nWe are given that the first Chern class c_1(X) = -3. Now, we can plug this value into the relation:\n\nc_2(X) = (-3)^2 - 2(-3)\nc_2(X) = 9 + 6\nc_2(X) = 15\n\nTherefore, the second Chern class c_2(X) of the complex manifold X is 15."
