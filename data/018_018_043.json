    "message_2": "The symmetric difference between two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it consists of elements that are unique to each set.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union (A ∪ B) and intersection (A ∩ B) of the sets A and B:\n\nA ∪ B = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\nA ∩ B = {4, 6}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference A Δ B:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} - {4, 6} = {2, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference is commutative. To do this, we need to show that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince the union and intersection are commutative (A ∪ B = B ∪ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A), we have:\n\nB Δ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} - {4, 6} = {2, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nThus, A Δ B = B Δ A, which proves that the symmetric difference is commutative."
