    "message_1": "A cylindrical container has a radius of 10 cm and a height of 20 cm. Water is flowing in at a rate of 0.5 cubic cm per second. Find the rate of increase of the water depth in the container, assuming that the water is being mixed continuously and that it is flowing out at the same rate as it is flowing in. Use the Navier-Stokes equations to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Since the water is flowing in and out at the same rate, the volume of the water in the container remains constant. Therefore, there is no increase in the water depth, and the rate of increase of the water depth is 0 cm/s. \n\nIn this case, the Navier-Stokes equations are not necessary to solve the problem, as the problem simplifies due to the constant volume condition."
