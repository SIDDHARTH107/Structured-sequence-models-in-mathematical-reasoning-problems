    "message_1": "Suppose a bakery sells an average of 60 loaves of bread per day, with a standard deviation of 5 loaves. If the number of loaves sold in a day is normally distributed, what is the probability of selling between 55 and 65 loaves on a given day?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of selling between 55 and 65 loaves on a given day, we can use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-scores for 55 and 65 loaves:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nFor 55 loaves:\nz1 = (55 - 60) / 5 = -1\n\nFor 65 loaves:\nz2 = (65 - 60) / 5 = 1\n\nNow, we will look up the z-scores in the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the corresponding probabilities:\n\nP(z1) = P(-1) ≈ 0.1587\nP(z2) = P(1) ≈ 0.8413\n\nTo find the probability of selling between 55 and 65 loaves, we need to find the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(55 < X < 65) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826\n\nSo, the probability of selling between 55 and 65 loaves on a given day is approximately 68.26%."
