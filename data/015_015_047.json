    "message_1": "What is the maximum number of oscillations that can occur in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction within a time period of 50 seconds if the average frequency of oscillations is 0.4 Hz and the range of oscillation frequency is between 0.2 Hz and 0.6 Hz?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of oscillations, we should consider the highest frequency within the given range, which is 0.6 Hz. \n\nTo calculate the number of oscillations within the 50 seconds time period, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of oscillations = Frequency × Time\n\nNumber of oscillations = 0.6 Hz × 50 s\n\nNumber of oscillations = 30\n\nSo, the maximum number of oscillations that can occur in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction within a time period of 50 seconds is 30."
