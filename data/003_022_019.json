    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √((-1)^2 + 2^2) = √(1 + 4) = √5\n|B| = √(3^2 + (-4)^2) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B. We can calculate the dot product using the formula:\n\nA · B = A_x * B_x + A_y * B_y\n\nA · B = (-1) * 3 + 2 * (-4) = -3 - 8 = -11\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = (-11) / (√5 * 5)\ncos(θ) = -11 / (5√5)\n\nNow, we can find the dot product using the trigonometric formula:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\nA · B = (√5) * 5 * (-11 / (5√5))\n\nThe 5 and √5 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nA · B = -11\n\nSo, the dot product of vectors A and B is -11."
