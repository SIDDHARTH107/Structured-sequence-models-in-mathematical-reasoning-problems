    "message_1": "A group of 6 friends are planning a road trip and they have 3 cars. Each car can accommodate a maximum of 4 people including the driver. If the friends decide to divide themselves equally among the cars, what is the probability that at least one car will have only girls since there are 3 girls and 3 boys in the group?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one car will have only girls, we can first find the total number of ways to divide the 6 friends into 3 cars and then find the number of ways to divide them such that at least one car has only girls.\n\nTotal number of ways to divide 6 friends into 3 cars with 2 people in each car:\n\nWe can use the multinomial coefficient formula for this:\n\n(6!)/(2! * 2! * 2!) = 720 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90 ways\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to divide them such that at least one car has only girls:\n\nCase 1: One car has only girls, and the other two cars have a mix of boys and girls.\n\nThere are 3 ways to choose which car will have only girls. Then, there are 3! ways to arrange the girls in that car. For the remaining 3 boys and 1 girl, there are 4! ways to arrange them in the other two cars. However, we need to divide by 2! for each car since the order of the people within the cars doesn't matter.\n\nNumber of ways for Case 1: 3 * (3!) * (4!) / (2! * 2!) = 3 * 6 * 24 / (2 * 2) = 108\n\nCase 2: Two cars have only girls, and the third car has only boys.\n\nThere are 3 ways to choose which car will have only boys. Then, there are 3! ways to arrange the boys in that car. For the remaining 3 girls, there are 3! ways to arrange them in the other two cars. However, we need to divide by 2! for each car since the order of the people within the cars doesn't matter.\n\nNumber of ways for Case 2: 3 * (3!) * (3!) / (2! * 2!) = 3 * 6 * 6 / (2 * 2) = 27\n\nTotal number of ways with at least one car having only girls: 108 + 27 = 135\n\nNow, we can find the probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of ways with at least one car having only girls) / (Total number of ways to divide 6 friends into 3 cars)\n\nProbability = 135 / 90 = 1.5\n\nHowever, since the probability cannot be greater than 1, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's reevaluate the problem.\n\nWhen we calculated the number of ways for Case 1, we overcounted the arrangements. We need to account for the fact that there are 2 boys and 1 girl left to be distributed among the two remaining cars. There are 3 ways to choose which car the remaining girl will go in, and then there are 2! ways to arrange the boys in the other car.\n\nSo, the corrected number of ways for Case 1: 3 * (3!) * 3 * (2!) = 3 * 6 * 3 * 2 = 108\n\nNow, the total number of ways with at least one car having only girls is: 108 + 27 = 135\n\nThe corrected probability is:\n\nProbability = 135 / 90 = 3 / 2 = 1.5\n\nAgain, we have a probability greater than 1, which is not possible. We made another mistake in our calculations. Let's reevaluate the problem once more.\n\nWe should consider the combinations instead of permutations for arranging the friends in the cars, as the order within the cars doesn't matter.\n\nTotal number of ways to divide 6 friends into 3 cars with 2 people in each car:\n\nWe can use the combinations formula for this:\n\nC(6,2) * C(4,2) = (6!/(2! * 4!)) * (4!/(2! * 2!)) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to divide them such that at least one car has only girls:\n\nCase 1: One car has only girls, and the other two cars have a mix of boys and girls.\n\nThere are 3 ways to choose which car will have only girls. Then, there are C(3,2) ways to choose 2 girls out of 3 to be in that car. For the remaining 3 boys and 1 girl, there are C(4,2) ways to choose 2 people for one of the remaining cars.\n\nNumber of ways for Case 1: 3 * C(3,2) * C(4,2) = 3 * 3 * 6 = 54\n\nCase 2: Two cars have only girls, and the third car has only boys.\n\nThere are 3 ways to choose which car will have only boys. Then, there are C(3,2) ways to choose 2 girls out of 3 to be in one of the girl-only cars. The remaining girl will be in the other girl-only car.\n\nNumber of ways for Case 2: 3 * C(3,2) = 3 * 3 = 9\n\nTotal number of ways with at least one car having only girls: 54 + 9 = 63\n\nNow, we can find the probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of ways with at least one car having only girls) / (Total number of ways to divide 6 friends into 3 cars)\n\nProbability = 63 / 90 = 7 / 10 = 0.7\n\nSo, the probability that at least one car will have only girls is 0.7 or 70%."
