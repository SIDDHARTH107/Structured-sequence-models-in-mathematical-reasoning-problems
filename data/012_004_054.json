    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm, we will start with an arbitrary vertex and then iteratively add the edge with the smallest weight that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside the tree. We will continue this process until all vertices are included in the tree.\n\nLet's start with vertex A:\n\n1. Add vertex A to the tree.\n2. Find the edge with the smallest weight connected to A: edge (A, B) with weight 2.\n3. Add vertex B and edge (A, B) to the tree.\n\nCurrent tree: A - (2) - B\n\nNow, we have vertices A and B in the tree. Let's find the edge with the smallest weight connected to either A or B:\n\n4. Edge (B, C) with weight 3 is the smallest weight edge connected to the tree.\n5. Add vertex C and edge (B, C) to the tree.\n\nCurrent tree: A - (2) - B - (3) - C\n\nNow, we have vertices A, B, and C in the tree. Let's find the edge with the smallest weight connected to A, B, or C:\n\n6. Edge (C, D) with weight 1 is the smallest weight edge connected to the tree.\n7. Add vertex D and edge (C, D) to the tree.\n\nCurrent tree: A - (2) - B - (3) - C - (1) - D\n\nNow, we have vertices A, B, C, and D in the tree. Let's find the edge with the smallest weight connected to A, B, C, or D:\n\n8. Edge (D, E) with weight 4 is the smallest weight edge connected to the tree.\n9. Add vertex E and edge (D, E) to the tree.\n\nCurrent tree: A - (2) - B - (3) - C - (1) - D - (4) - E\n\nAll vertices are now included in the tree, so we have found the minimum spanning tree:\n\nMinimum spanning tree: A - (2) - B - (3) - C - (1) - D - (4) - E\n\nTo calculate the total weight of the minimum spanning tree, we sum the weights of all the edges:\n\nTotal weight = 2 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 10"
