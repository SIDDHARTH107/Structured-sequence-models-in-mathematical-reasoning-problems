    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the firefly algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the firefly population with random solutions (x1, x2) within the feasible region.\n2. Define the objective function f(x1, x2) and constraints.\n3. Set the algorithm parameters: number of fireflies, maximum iterations, alpha (randomness), beta (attractiveness), and gamma (light absorption).\n4. Evaluate the fitness of each firefly based on the objective function and constraints.\n5. Update the firefly positions based on the attractiveness and distance between fireflies.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the maximum number of iterations is reached or convergence is achieved.\n7.
