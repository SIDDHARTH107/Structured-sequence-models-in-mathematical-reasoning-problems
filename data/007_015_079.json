    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. The first few Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, and 131071, corresponding to n = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, and 17.\n\nThe 7th Mersenne prime number corresponds to n = 19. Therefore, the 7th Mersenne prime number is:\n\nM_19 = 2^19 - 1 = 524288 - 1 = 524287"
