    "message_1": "An elementary school has a total of 300 students. If the probability of a student passing the final mathematics exam is 0.8, what is the expected number of students who will pass the exam at the end of the semester?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of students who will pass the exam, we can multiply the total number of students by the probability of passing the exam.\n\nExpected number of students passing = Total number of students × Probability of passing\nExpected number of students passing = 300 × 0.8\nExpected number of students passing = 240\n\nSo, the expected number of students who will pass the exam at the end of the semester is 240."
