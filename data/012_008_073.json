    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have v = 12 and e = 23. We want to find out if there exists a value for f that satisfies the equation.\n\nHowever, before we do that, let's check if the graph G satisfies the necessary condition for being planar using Kuratowski's theorem. According to this theorem, a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on two sets of 3 vertices).\n\nFor a graph to be a subdivision of K5 or K3,3, it must have at least as many edges as either of these graphs. K5 has 10 edges, and K3,3 has 9 edges. Since our graph has 23 edges, it is possible that it contains a subdivision of K5 or K3,3.\n\nNow let's check the maximum number of edges a planar graph with 12 vertices can have using the inequality:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nPlugging in v = 12, we get:\n\ne ≤ 3(12) - 6\ne ≤ 36 - 6\ne ≤ 30\n\nSince 23 ≤ 30, it is still possible for the graph to be planar. Now let's go back to Euler's formula and solve for f:\n\n12 - 23 + f = 2\nf = 13\n\nSo, if the graph G is planar, it would have 13 faces. However, we cannot conclusively determine if G is planar without more information about the specific connections between vertices. If it turns out that G does not contain a subdivision of K5 or K3,3, then it would be planar with 13 faces."
