    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B, and the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B ∆ A. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1} ∪ {4} = {1, 4}\nB ∆ A = (B - A) ∪ (A - B) = {4} ∪ {1} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's calculate the Cartesian product of (A ∆ B) and (B ∆ A). The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A ∆ B) x (B ∆ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nSince the Cartesian product of (A ∆ B) and (B ∆ A) is the same, they are equal."
