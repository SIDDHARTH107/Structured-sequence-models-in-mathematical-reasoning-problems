Let Σ be a closed and connected surface smoothly embedded in T such that Σ is symplectic and its homology class [Σ] is non-zero. Show that the Floer homology of Σ is not trivial, i.e., there exists at least one generator in the Floer complex CF(Σ) and the corresponding Floer homology group is non-zero.\n\n(Note: This question is quite difficult and assumes a lot of background knowledge in topology, symplectic geometry, and Floer theory. It may not be suitable for an undergraduate-level math student.)",
    "message_2": "To show that the Floer homology of Σ is non-trivial, we will first need to establish some preliminary results.\n\n1. The standard torus T is a symplectic manifold with a symplectic form ω. This can be shown by considering the standard embedding of T into R^3 and pulling back the standard symplectic form on R^3 to T.\n\n2. The surface Σ is symplectic, meaning that it is a submanifold of T such that the restriction of ω to Σ is non-degenerate. This is given in the problem statement.\n\n3. The homology class [Σ] is non-zero, which means that Σ is not homologous to a point in T. This is also given in the problem statement.\n\nNow, we can proceed with the proof.\n\nSince Σ is a symplectic submanifold of T, it inherits a symplectic form ω_Σ from the ambient symplectic form ω. We can then consider the Floer complex CF(Σ) associated with the symplectic manifold (Σ, ω_Σ). The Floer complex is generated by the critical points of a Morse function f on Σ, and the differential in the complex counts the number of gradient flow lines between critical points.\n\nTo show that the Floer homology of Σ is non-trivial, we need to find at least one generator in the Floer complex CF(Σ) such that its Floer homology group is non-zero. Since Σ is a closed and connected surface, we can choose a Morse function f on Σ with at least one critical point (for example, the height function with respect to a suitable Riemannian metric on Σ). Let p be a critical point of f.\n\nNow, consider the Floer differential ∂ applied to the generator p. Since p is a critical point of f, the Floer differential counts the number of gradient flow lines from p to other critical points of f. However, since Σ is symplectic and its homology class [Σ] is non-zero, there must be at least one other critical point q of f such that there is a non-trivial gradient flow line from p to q. This implies that ∂(p) ≠ 0, and therefore the Floer homology group associated with the generator p is non-zero.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that there exists at least one generator in the Floer complex CF(Σ) with a non-zero Floer homology group, which implies that the Floer homology of Σ is non-trivial."
