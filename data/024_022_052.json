    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves distances between points. In a 2-dimensional Euclidean space, there are four types of isometries: translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections. We will consider each type and determine if it maps the point (0,0) to the point (3,4).\n\n1. Translation:\nA translation is simply a shift in the plane. To map (0,0) to (3,4), we can translate the plane by the vector (3,4). This isometry is given by the transformation T(x,y) = (x+3, y+4).\n\n2. Rotation:\nA rotation is a transformation around a fixed point. To map (0,0) to (3,4), we can rotate the plane by an angle θ around a point (a,b) such that the distance between (0,0) and (a,b) is equal to the distance between (3,4) and (a,b). The distance between (0,0) and (3,4) is 5, so we need to find a point (a,b) such that the distance between (a,b) and (0,0) is 5/2. One such point is (3/2, 2). We can then rotate the plane by an angle of 180 degrees (π radians) around this point. This isometry is given by the transformation R(x,y) = (3 - x, 4 - y).\n\n3. Reflection:\nA reflection is a transformation across a line. To map (0,0) to (3,4), we can reflect the plane across the line that is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting (0,0) and (3,4). This line has the equation y = (2/3)x. This isometry is given by the transformation Ref(x,y) = (x - (4/5)(x^2 + y^2 - 3x), y + (4/5)(2x - y - 3x)).\n\n4. Glide reflection:\nA glide reflection is a combination of a reflection and a translation along the line of reflection. However, since (0,0) and (3,4) are not symmetric with respect to any line, there is no glide reflection that maps (0,0) to (3,4).\n\nIn summary, there are three isometries that map the point (0,0) to the point (3,4) in a 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold with Euclidean metric:\n\n1. Translation: T(x,y) = (x+3, y+4)\n2. Rotation: R(x,y) = (3 - x, 4 - y)\n3. Reflection: Ref(x,y) = (x - (4/5)(x^2 + y^2 - 3x), y + (4/5)(2x - y - 3x))"
