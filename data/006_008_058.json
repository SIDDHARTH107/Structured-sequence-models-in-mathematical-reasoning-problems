    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in June)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on a single trial (day)\n- n is the total number of trials (days in June)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days) we want to find the probability for\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 30 (days in June)\n- k = 20 (rainy days)\n- p = 0.6 (60% chance of rain)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate nCk, which is the number of combinations of 30 items taken 20 at a time:\n\nnCk = C(30, 20) = 30! / (20! * (30-20)!)\nwhere \"!\" denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(30, 20) = 30! / (20! * 10!) = 30045015\n\nNext, we need to calculate p^k and (1-p)^(n-k):\n\np^k = 0.6^20 ≈ 0.0000369\n(1-p)^(n-k) = (1 - 0.6)^(30-20) = 0.4^10 ≈ 0.00010486\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 20) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\nP(X = 20) = 30045015 * 0.0000369 * 0.00010486 ≈ 0.114558\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain on exactly 20 days in June is approximately 11.46%."
