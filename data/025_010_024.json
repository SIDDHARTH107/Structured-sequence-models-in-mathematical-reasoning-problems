    "message_1": "Let X be a non-singular projective curve of genus 3, represented as an algebraic variety over the field of complex numbers. Let L be a line bundle on X such that h^0(X,L) = 3 and h^1(X,L) = 1. Compute the degree of L using Riemann-Roch theorem.",
    "message_2": "The Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves states that for any line bundle L on a curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nh^0(X, L) - h^1(X, L) = deg(L) - g + 1\n\nIn our case, we are given that X is a curve of genus g = 3, h^0(X, L) = 3, and h^1(X, L) = 1. Plugging these values into the Riemann-Roch theorem, we get:\n\n3 - 1 = deg(L) - 3 + 1\n\nSimplifying the equation, we have:\n\n2 = deg(L) - 2\n\nNow, solving for the degree of L, we get:\n\ndeg(L) = 4\n\nSo, the degree of the line bundle L on the curve X is 4."
