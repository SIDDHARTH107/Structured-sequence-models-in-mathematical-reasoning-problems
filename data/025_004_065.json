    "message_2": "To find the number of points that the rational curve C with degree 7 has on the smooth cubic surface S, we can use the intersection theory. In algebraic geometry, the intersection number of two algebraic varieties is a fundamental invariant that describes the way the varieties intersect.\n\nLet S be a smooth cubic surface in projective 3-space, given by a homogeneous polynomial F(x, y, z, w) of degree 3. Let C be a rational curve in S with degree 7, given by a parameterization [x(t), y(t), z(t), w(t)], where x(t), y(t), z(t), and w(t) are homogeneous polynomials of degree 7.\n\nThe intersection of C and S is given by the points where F(x(t), y(t), z(t), w(t)) = 0. Since F is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 and x(t), y(t), z(t), w(t) are homogeneous polynomials of degree 7, F(x(t), y(t), z(t), w(t)) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 21 in t.\n\nBy BÃ©zout's theorem, the number of intersection points between C and S is equal to the product of their degrees, which is 3 * 7 = 21. However, this count may include complex points and points at infinity. Since we are interested in the number of points on the curve C that lie on the surface S, we need to consider only the real points.\n\nThe actual number of real points of intersection depends on the specific forms of the surface S and the curve C, and it may be less than or equal to 21. In general, it is not possible to determine the exact number of real intersection points without more information about the surface and the curve."
