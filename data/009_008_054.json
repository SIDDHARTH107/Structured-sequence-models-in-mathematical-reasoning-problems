Find the amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and period of the wave.",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and period of the wave, we need to analyze the given wave equation:\n\ny(x,t) = 0.05 sin(10t - 0.04x)\n\nThis equation is in the form:\n\ny(x,t) = A sin(kx - ωt)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, and ω is the angular frequency.\n\n1. Amplitude (A):\nThe amplitude is the maximum displacement of the medium from its equilibrium position. In the given equation, the amplitude is 0.05 meters.\n\n2. Wavelength (λ):\nThe wavelength is the distance between two consecutive points that are in phase (e.g., two consecutive crests or troughs). The wave number (k) is related to the wavelength by the formula:\n\nk = 2π/λ\n\nIn the given equation, k = 0.04. Solving for λ:\n\nλ = 2π/k = 2π/0.04 ≈ 157.08 meters\n\n3. Frequency (f) and Period (T):\nThe frequency is the number of oscillations (or cycles) per unit time, and the period is the time it takes for one complete oscillation (or cycle). The angular frequency (ω) is related to the frequency by the formula:\n\nω = 2πf\n\nIn the given equation, ω = 10. Solving for f:\n\nf = ω/(2π) = 10/(2π) ≈ 1.59 Hz\n\nThe period (T) is the reciprocal of the frequency:\n\nT = 1/f ≈ 1/1.59 ≈ 0.63 seconds\n\nIn summary, the wave has an amplitude of 0.05 meters, a wavelength of approximately 157.08 meters, a frequency of approximately 1.59 Hz, and a period of approximately 0.63 seconds."
