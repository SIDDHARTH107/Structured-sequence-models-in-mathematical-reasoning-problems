The distances between each location are as follows: \n\n- A to B: 10 km\n- A to C: 15 km\n- A to D: 12 km\n- B to C: 8 km\n- B to D: 14 km\n- C to D: 6 km\n\nWhat is the optimal route for the delivery van given these distances?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we need to consider all possible routes and calculate the total distance for each route. Since we start at A and end at B, we only need to consider the order in which we visit C and D. There are two possible routes:\n\n1. A → C → D → B\n2. A → D → C → B\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance for each route:\n\n1. A → C → D → B: A to C (15 km) + C to D (6 km) + D to B (14 km) = 15 + 6 + 14 = 35 km\n2. A → D → C → B: A to D (12 km) + D to C (6 km) + C to B (8 km) = 12 + 6 + 8 = 26 km\n\nComparing the two routes, the second route (A → D → C → B) has the shortest distance of 26 km. Therefore, the optimal route for the delivery van is A → D → C → B."
