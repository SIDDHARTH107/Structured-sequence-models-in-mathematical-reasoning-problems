    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Then, the given partial differential equation becomes:\n\n$$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $x$ and the right side depends only on $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-\\lambda$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$$\n$$\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda$$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$$\n$$Y''(y) - \\lambda Y(y) = 0$$\n\nLet's solve the $X(x)$ equation first. The general solution to this equation is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $u(x, 0) = \\cos(x)$, we get:\n\n$$X(x)Y(0) = \\cos(x)$$\n\nSince $Y(0)$ cannot be zero, we have $X(x) = \\cos(x)$, which implies that $\\lambda = 1$ and $A = 1$, $B = 0$. So, the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = \\cos(x)$$\n\nNow, let's solve the $Y(y)$ equation. The general solution to this equation is:\n\n$$Y(y) = C\\cosh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y) + D\\sinh(\\sqrt{\\lambda}y)$$\n\nSince $\\lambda = 1$, we have:\n\n$$Y(y) = C\\cosh(y) + D\\sinh(y)$$\n\nApplying the boundary condition $u(0, y) = \\sin(y)$, we get:\n\n$$X(0)Y(y) = \\sin(y)$$\n\nSince $X(0) = 1$, we have $Y(y) = \\sin(y)$, which implies that $C = 0$ and $D = 1$. So, the solution for $Y(y)$ is:\n\n$$Y(y) = \\sinh(y)$$\n\nFinally, the solution to the boundary value problem is:\n\n$$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y) = \\cos(x)\\sinh(y)$$"
