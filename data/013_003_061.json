    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, two players are given a sum of money to divide between them. Player 1 offers a split of $100 between themselves and Player 2, who can either accept or reject the offer. If Player 2 accepts, the money is split as proposed. If Player 2 rejects the offer, neither player receives any money.\n\nSuppose Player 1 offers a split of $60 to themselves and $40 to Player 2. What minimum offer would Player 2 have to accept in order to receive a larger share of the money?",
    "message_2": "In order for Player 2 to receive a larger share of the money, they would need to receive more than half of the total sum, which is more than $50. The minimum offer that Player 2 would have to accept to receive a larger share would be $51, with Player 1 receiving $49."
