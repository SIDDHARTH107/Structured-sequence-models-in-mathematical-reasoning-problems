    "message_2": "In Linear Logic, the \"!\" (exclamation mark) is called an exponential, which is used to express that a resource can be duplicated or discarded. The \"&\" (ampersand) represents a tensor, which is a connective that combines two resources. The \"⊢\" (turnstile) symbolizes that the expression on the left entails the expression on the right.\n\nGiven the expression !(x & 5) ⊢ !x or !(x & 5) ⊢ !5, we can interpret it as follows:\n\nIf we have a resource that is a combination of x and 5 (x & 5), and we can duplicate or discard this resource, then we can either have a resource that is just x (!x) or a resource that is just 5 (!5).\n\nHowever, since Linear Logic is a substructural logic, it does not have the usual structural rules of classical logic, such as weakening, contraction, and exchange. Therefore, we cannot directly solve for x in this expression as we would in classical logic.\n\nInstead, we can only conclude that if we have a resource that is a combination of x and 5, then we can have a resource that is just x or a resource that is just 5."
