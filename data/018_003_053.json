    "message_2": "To find the union of set A and set B, we combine all the elements from both sets without repeating any elements. \n\nA = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nB = {3, 6, 9}\n\nThe union of set A and set B is:\n\nA ∪ B = {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}\n\nNow, we need to show that the resulting set is a superset of both sets. A set C is a superset of set A if every element of A is also an element of C. Similarly, C is a superset of set B if every element of B is also an element of C.\n\nFor set A:\n2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ A ∪ B\n8 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nFor set B:\n3 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ A ∪ B\n9 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element of set A and set B is also an element of the union set A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B is a superset of both sets A and B."
