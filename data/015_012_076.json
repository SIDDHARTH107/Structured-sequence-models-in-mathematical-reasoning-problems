    "message_2": "The Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions to the Lorenz system, which is a system of three ordinary differential equations. The Lorenz attractor is a fractal structure in 3D space, and it is not a well-defined region for a double integral. \n\nHowever, if you want to evaluate the given double integral over a specific region in the xy-plane, you can provide the limits of integration or a well-defined region. Otherwise, it is not possible to evaluate the integral over the Lorenz attractor in 3D space."
