    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: A person shakes hands with at least 3 other people.\nCase 2: A person shakes hands with at most 2 other people.\n\nIn Case 1, if a person shakes hands with at least 3 other people, then either they form a group of 3 people who have shaken hands with each other, or there is a group of 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other. In this case, the minimum number of handshakes is 3.\n\nIn Case 2, if every person shakes hands with at most 2 other people, then there must be at least one person who shakes hands with exactly 2 other people. Let's call this person A. Now, there are 3 remaining people (excluding A and the two people A shook hands with). If any of these 3 remaining people shake hands with each other, then we have a group of 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other (A and the two people A shook hands with). If none of these 3 remaining people shake hands with each other, then they form a group of 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other. In this case, the minimum number of handshakes is also 3.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of handshakes that must occur in order to guarantee that there are either 3 people who have shaken hands with each other or 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other is 3."
