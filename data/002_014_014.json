    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is the surface area of this rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: 2 of each type (length x width, length x height, and width x height).\n\n1. Length x Width: 6 cm x 4 cm = 24 square cm\nThere are 2 of these faces, so 24 x 2 = 48 square cm\n\n2. Length x Height: 6 cm x 5 cm = 30 square cm\nThere are 2 of these faces, so 30 x 2 = 60 square cm\n\n3. Width x Height: 4 cm x 5 cm = 20 square cm\nThere are 2 of these faces, so 20 x 2 = 40 square cm\n\nNow, add the areas of all the faces together:\n48 + 60 + 40 = 148 square cm\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 148 square cm."
