    "message_2": "The given statement asserts the existence of a relation R that is symmetric, meaning that if R(x, y) holds, then R(y, x) must also hold, and vice versa.\n\nTo find the smallest possible cardinality of a non-empty set A such that there exists a relation R on A satisfying the statement, we can consider the simplest case: a set with only one element. Let A = {a}, where 'a' is an arbitrary element.\n\nNow, we define the relation R on A as follows: R(a, a). Since there is only one element in A, the relation R is symmetric by definition, as R(a, a) ↔ R(a, a) is true.\n\nThus, the smallest possible cardinality of a non-empty set A such that there exists a relation R on A satisfying the given statement is 1."
