    "message_2": "Since there are only three possible outcomes in a soccer match (team A wins, team B wins, or a draw), the probabilities of all outcomes must add up to 1. \n\nLet P(draw) be the probability of the match ending in a draw. \n\nP(team A wins) + P(team B wins) + P(draw) = 1\n\n0.6 (team A winning) + 0.3 (team B winning) + P(draw) = 1\n\n0.9 + P(draw) = 1\n\nP(draw) = 1 - 0.9\n\nP(draw) = 0.1\n\nThe probability that the match ends in a draw is 0.1 or 10%."
