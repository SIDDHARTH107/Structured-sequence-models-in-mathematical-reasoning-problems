    "message_1": "A radioactive substance has a half-life of 10 days. If there are initially 100 grams of the substance, how many grams will be left after 30 days?",
    "message_2": "To determine the amount of the radioactive substance remaining after 30 days, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 100 grams, the time elapsed is 30 days, and the half-life is 10 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 100 * (1/2)^(30 / 10)\nFinal amount = 100 * (1/2)^3\nFinal amount = 100 * (1/8)\nFinal amount = 12.5 grams\n\nSo, after 30 days, there will be 12.5 grams of the radioactive substance remaining."
