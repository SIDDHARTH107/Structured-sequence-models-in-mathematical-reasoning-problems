    "message_2": "To solve the rational equation (2/x) + (3/x^2) = 5/4, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator for x and x^2 is x^2. \n\nNow, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:\n\n(2x/x^2) + (3/x^2) = 5/4\n\nNow, we can combine the fractions on the left side:\n\n(2x + 3)/x^2 = 5/4\n\nTo get rid of the fractions, we can cross-multiply:\n\n4(2x + 3) = 5x^2\n\nNow, distribute the 4 on the left side:\n\n8x + 12 = 5x^2\n\nRearrange the equation to set it equal to zero:\n\n5x^2 - 8x - 12 = 0\n\nNow, we can try to solve for x by factoring, but this quadratic equation does not factor easily. Instead, we will use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 5, b = -8, and c = -12. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (8 ± √((-8)^2 - 4(5)(-12))) / (2(5))\n\nx = (8 ± √(64 + 240)) / 10\n\nx = (8 ± √304) / 10\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = (8 + √304) / 10\nx = (8 - √304) / 10\n\nThese are the two possible values for x that satisfy the given rational equation."
