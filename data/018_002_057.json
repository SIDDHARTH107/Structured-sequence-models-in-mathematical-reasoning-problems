    "message_2": "To prove that A ∩ B is a subset of A and B respectively, we need to show that every element in A ∩ B is also an element of A and B.\n\nTheorem: If x ∈ A ∩ B, then x ∈ A and x ∈ B.\n\nProof:\n\nLet's first find the intersection of sets A and B, which is A ∩ B.\n\nA ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\n\nComparing the elements of sets A and B, we can see that the common elements are 3 and 9. Therefore,\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 9}\n\nNow, let's take an arbitrary element x from A ∩ B. Since there are only two elements in A ∩ B, we can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: x = 3\nIn this case, x is an element of both A and B, as 3 is present in both sets.\n\nCase 2: x = 9\nIn this case, x is also an element of both A and B, as 9 is present in both sets.\n\nIn both cases, x ∈ A and x ∈ B. Therefore, we have shown that if x ∈ A ∩ B, then x ∈ A and x ∈ B.\n\nHence, A ∩ B is a subset of A and B respectively."
