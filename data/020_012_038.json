The profits earned by producing one unit of A and B are $4 and $5 respectively. The company has two machines, X and Y, both of which are required to produce both types of products. The time required to produce one unit of A and B on machine X is 1 hour and 2 hours respectively, while the corresponding times on machine Y are 3 hours and 2 hours respectively. The company has 60 hours of production time available on machine X and 80 hours on machine Y. \n\nAssuming that the company wants to maximize its profit, how many units of A and B should it produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 4x + 5y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1x + 2y ≤ 60 (Machine X's available time)\n3x + 2y ≤ 80 (Machine Y's available time)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 1x + 2y = 60\n   y = 30 - 0.5x\n\n2. 3x + 2y = 80\n   y = 40 - 1.5x\n\nThe intersection points of the feasible region are:\n\nA(0, 0)\nB(0, 30)\nC(20, 20)\nD(40, 0)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P at each of these points:\n\nP(A) = 4(0) + 5(0) = 0\nP(B) = 4(0) + 5(30) = 150\nP(C) = 4(20) + 5(20) = 180\nP(D) = 4(40) + 5(0) = 160\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point C, where the company produces 20 units of product A and 20 units of product B. The maximum profit is $180."
