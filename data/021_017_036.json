    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Differential Evolution algorithm, we will use the Python programming language and the Scipy library, which has a built-in differential_evolution function. Here's the code to find the minimum value of the given function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import differential_evolution\n\ndef f(x):\n    return np.sin(x[0]) + np.cos(x[1])\n\nbounds = [(0, 6), (0, 4)]\n\nresult = differential_evolution(f, bounds, popsize=50, maxiter=200)\n\nprint(\"Minimum value of f(x, y):\", result.fun)\nprint(\"x and y values:\", result.x)\n```\n\nThis code defines the function f(x) and the bounds for x and y. Then, it calls the differential_evolution function with the given parameters (population size 50 and maximum of 200 generations). Finally, it prints the minimum value of the function and the corresponding x and y values.\n\nPlease note that the result may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the Differential Evolution algorithm."
