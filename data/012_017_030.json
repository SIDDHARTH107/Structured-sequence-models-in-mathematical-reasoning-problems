    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges in a graph such that every vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex, and no two edges share a vertex. In other words, it's a set of disjoint pairs of vertices.\n\nFor a graph to have a perfect matching, it must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The graph must have an even number of vertices.\n2. The graph must satisfy Tutte's theorem, which states that for any subset U of the vertices, the number of vertices in the set U that are not in the perfect matching is less than or equal to the number of vertices in the odd-sized components of the graph induced by the vertices not in U.\n\nLet's check if the given graph with 8 vertices and 14 edges satisfies these conditions:\n\n1. The graph has an even number of vertices (8), so the first condition is satisfied.\n\n2. To check the second condition, we need to examine all possible subsets U of the vertices. However, since the graph has 14 edges, which is close to the maximum number of edges possible for a graph with 8 vertices (the maximum being 8 * (8 - 1) / 2 = 28 / 2 = 14), it is highly likely that the graph is well-connected and satisfies Tutte's theorem. \n\nWithout more information about the specific connections between vertices, we cannot definitively determine whether or not there exists a perfect matching. However, given the high number of edges and the even number of vertices, it is likely that a perfect matching exists in this graph."
