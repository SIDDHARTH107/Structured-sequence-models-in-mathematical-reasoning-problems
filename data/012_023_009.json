    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (i.e., a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge).\n\nIn the given graph G, we can observe the following cliques:\n\n1. {1,2,3,4} is a clique of size 4, as every pair of vertices in this set is connected by an edge.\n2. {4,5} is a clique of size 2.\n3. {5,6} is a clique of size 2.\n\nThere are no cliques of size 5 or 6 in the graph G. Therefore, the clique number of the graph G is 4."
