    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of vertices needed to cover all the edges of G, we can use the Vertex Cover problem approach. In this problem, we want to find the smallest set of vertices such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set.\n\nA complete graph with 7 vertices (K7) has 21 edges, but our graph G has only 10 edges. Therefore, it is not a complete graph. In the worst case, one vertex is connected to all other 6 vertices, which means it has a degree of 6. In this case, we would need at least 2 vertices to cover all the edges.\n\nLet's consider the following cases:\n\n1. One vertex with degree 6 (connected to all other vertices) and the remaining vertices with degrees less than or equal to 3. In this case, we need at least 2 vertices to cover all the edges.\n\n2. Two vertices with degree 5 (each connected to 5 other vertices). In this case, we need at least 3 vertices to cover all the edges.\n\n3. Three vertices with degree 4 (each connected to 4 other vertices). In this case, we need at least 3 vertices to cover all the edges.\n\n4. Four vertices with degree 3 (each connected to 3 other vertices). In this case, we need at least 4 vertices to cover all the edges.\n\nSince we are looking for the minimum number of vertices needed to cover all the edges, we can conclude that the minimum number of vertices needed is 2."
