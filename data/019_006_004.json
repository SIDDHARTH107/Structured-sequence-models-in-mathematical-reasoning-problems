    "message_1": "Sorry, As an AI language model, I cannot provide a numeric problem for Deontic Logic as it is a branch of logic that deals with the ways in which statements can be modified by terms such as 'obligatory', 'permissible', or 'forbidden'. It is concerned with normative concepts and the reasoning involved in decisions about what ought to be done, rather than with numerical problems.",
    "message_2": "That's correct. Deontic logic is not about solving numerical problems, but rather about understanding and analyzing normative statements and concepts. If you have any other mathematical problem or question, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help."
