    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the particular solution and the complementary solution of the given Duffing oscillator equation. The equation is a non-linear second-order differential equation, which makes it difficult to find an exact solution. However, we can use numerical methods to approximate the solution.\n\nOne common numerical method for solving second-order differential equations is the Runge-Kutta method. First, we need to rewrite the given equation as a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\n1. x' = y\n2. y' = 5cos(3t) - 0.1y - x + x^3\n\nNow, we can apply the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to solve this system of equations with the initial conditions x(0) = 1 and y(0) = x'(0) = 0. The method consists of the following steps:\n\n1. Define the step size (h) and the number of steps (n). For this problem, let's take h = 0.01 and n = 500 (since we want to find the value of x at t = 5 seconds).\n\n2. Initialize the variables x, y, and t with their initial values (1, 0, and 0, respectively).\n\n3. Iterate through the following steps for i = 1 to n:\n\n   a. Calculate k1_x = h * y\n   b. Calculate k1_y = h * (5cos(3t) - 0.1y - x + x^3)\n   c. Update x_temp = x + 0.5 * k1_x and y_temp = y + 0.5 * k1_y\n   d. Calculate k2_x = h * y_temp\n   e. Calculate k2_y = h * (5cos(3(t + 0.5 * h)) - 0.1 * y_temp - x_temp + x_temp^3)\n   f. Update x_temp = x + 0.5 * k2_x and y_temp = y + 0.5 * k2_y\n   g. Calculate k3_x = h * y_temp\n   h. Calculate k3_y = h * (5cos(3(t + 0.5 * h)) - 0.1 * y_temp - x_temp + x_temp^3)\n   i. Update x_temp = x + k3_x and y_temp = y + k3_y\n   j. Calculate k4_x = h * y_temp\n   k. Calculate k4_y = h * (5cos(3(t + h)) - 0.1 * y_temp - x_temp + x_temp^3)\n   l. Update x = x + (k1_x + 2 * k2_x + 2 * k3_x + k4_x) / 6\n   m. Update y = y + (k1_y + 2 * k2_y + 2 * k3_y + k4_y) / 6\n   n. Update t = t + h\n\n4. After completing the iteration, the value of x at t = 5 seconds will be stored in the variable x.\n\nBy implementing this method in a programming language (e.g., Python, MATLAB, etc.), we can find the approximate value of x at t = 5 seconds. Note that the accuracy of the solution depends on the step size (h) and the number of steps (n). A smaller step size and a larger number of steps will generally result in a more accurate solution, but it will also require more computation time."
