How many steps are required by a Turing machine to compute this function for a binary string of length n?",
    "message_2": "To show that the function f(x) is computable, we need to provide a description of a Turing machine that computes it. Here's a high-level description of a Turing machine that computes f(x):\n\n1. Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Read the input string from left to right.\n3. For each symbol in the input string:\n   a. If the symbol is 1, increment the counter.\n   b. If the symbol is 0, do nothing.\n4. After reading the entire input string, check the counter:\n   a. If the counter is even, output 1.\n   b. If the counter is odd, output 0.\n\nNow let's analyze the number of steps required by this Turing machine to compute f(x) for a binary string of length n.\n\n1. Initializing the counter takes 1 step.\n2. Reading the input string takes n steps (one for each symbol).\n3. For each symbol in the input string:\n   a. If the symbol is 1, incrementing the counter takes 1 step.\n   b. If the symbol is 0, doing nothing takes 1 step.\n   In the worst case, all symbols are 1's, so this step takes n steps.\n4. Checking the counter and outputting the result takes 1 step.\n\nIn total, the Turing machine takes 1 + n + n + 1 = 2n + 2 steps to compute f(x) for a binary string of length n."
