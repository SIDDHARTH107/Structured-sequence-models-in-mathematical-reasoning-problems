    "message_1": "Suppose a company has 5 employees and wants to form a committee consisting of 2 employees. How many different committees can the company form assuming that the order of selection does not matter and no employee can serve on the committee more than once?",
    "message_2": "To form a committee of 2 employees from a group of 5 employees, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of employees (5 in this case), k is the number of employees to be selected for the committee (2 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!3!)\n\nC(5, 2) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1)(3 * 2 * 1))\n\nC(5, 2) = (120) / (2 * 6)\n\nC(5, 2) = 120 / 12\n\nC(5, 2) = 10\n\nSo, the company can form 10 different committees with 2 employees each."
