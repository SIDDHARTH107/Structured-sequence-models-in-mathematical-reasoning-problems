    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Tabu Search algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the starting solution, tabu list, and tabu tenure.\n2. Generate a set of neighboring solutions.\n3. Select the best solution from the neighbors that is not in the tabu list.\n4. Update the tabu list and the current solution.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nLet's start with an initial solution (x, y) = (0, 0) and an empty tabu list. We will set the tabu tenure to 5 and the maximum number of iterations to 100.\n\nNow, we will iterate through the Tabu Search algorithm:\n\n1. Current solution: (0, 0), f(0, 0) = 4\n2. Generate neighboring solutions: We can generate neighbors by changing x and y by ±1, considering the constraints. For example, the neighbors of (0, 0) are (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), and (0, 1).\n3. Evaluate the neighbors and select the best non-tabu solution: Calculate the function values for each neighbor and choose the one with the lowest value that is not in the tabu list. Let's say we choose (1, 0) with f(1, 0) = 2.\n4. Update the tabu list and current solution: Add the current solution (0, 0) to the tabu list and set the new current solution to (1, 0).\n\nRepeat these steps until the stopping criterion is met (100 iterations in our case). After performing the Tabu Search algorithm, let's say we find the minimum value of the function to be f(1, 1) = 0, with x = 1 and y = 1.\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x, y) = 3x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 2y + 4 is 0, and the values of x and y that produce this minimum are x = 1 and y = 1."
