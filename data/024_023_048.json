    "message_2": "The given equation, x^2 - y^2 = 1, represents a hyperbola. To find the symmetries of this hyperbola, we need to find all the bijective functions that map the hyperbola onto itself while preserving distances and angles.\n\nThere are four main types of symmetries for a hyperbola:\n\n1. Identity transformation: This transformation maps every point on the hyperbola to itself. The function for this transformation is f(x, y) = (x, y).\n\n2. Reflection across the x-axis: This transformation maps every point on the hyperbola to its reflection across the x-axis. The function for this transformation is f(x, y) = (x, -y).\n\n3. Reflection across the y-axis: This transformation maps every point on the hyperbola to its reflection across the y-axis. The function for this transformation is f(x, y) = (-x, y).\n\n4. Reflection across the origin: This transformation maps every point on the hyperbola to its reflection across the origin. The function for this transformation is f(x, y) = (-x, -y).\n\nThese four transformations are bijective and preserve distances and angles. Therefore, the possible symmetries of the given hyperbola are:\n\n1. Identity transformation: f(x, y) = (x, y)\n2. Reflection across the x-axis: f(x, y) = (x, -y)\n3. Reflection across the y-axis: f(x, y) = (-x, y)\n4. Reflection across the origin: f(x, y) = (-x, -y)"
