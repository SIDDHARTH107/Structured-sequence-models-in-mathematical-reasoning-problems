    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = sin(2x) - cos(3x), we'll use the chain rule.\n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of sin(2x) with respect to x:\nd/dx [sin(2x)] = cos(2x) * d/dx [2x] = cos(2x) * 2 = 2cos(2x)\n\nNext, let's find the derivative of cos(3x) with respect to x:\nd/dx [cos(3x)] = -sin(3x) * d/dx [3x] = -sin(3x) * 3 = -3sin(3x)\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of f(x) by combining the derivatives of sin(2x) and cos(3x):\nf'(x) = 2cos(2x) - 3sin(3x)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = pi/6:\nf'(pi/6) = 2cos(2(pi/6)) - 3sin(3(pi/6))\nf'(pi/6) = 2cos(pi/3) - 3sin(pi/2)\n\nWe know that cos(pi/3) = 1/2 and sin(pi/2) = 1, so we can substitute these values into the equation:\nf'(pi/6) = 2(1/2) - 3(1)\nf'(pi/6) = 1 - 3\nf'(pi/6) = -2\n\nSo, the value of the derivative at x = pi/6 is -2."
