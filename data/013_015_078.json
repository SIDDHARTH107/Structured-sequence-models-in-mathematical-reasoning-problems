    "message_1": "Suppose a principal hires an agent to perform a task, and there are three possible outcomes: a successful outcome with a reward of $3000, an unsuccessful outcome with a penalty of $1000, and a mediocre outcome with no reward or penalty. The agent can either exert high effort, with a cost of $1500, or low effort, with a cost of $500. The probability of success is 0.6 if high effort is exerted, and 0.3 if low effort is exerted. What is the optimal choice for the agent, and what is the expected payoff for both the principal and the agent?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal choice for the agent, we need to calculate the expected payoff for both high effort and low effort. \n\nHigh effort:\n- Probability of success: 0.6\n- Probability of unsuccessful outcome: 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2 (assuming the remaining probability is split evenly between unsuccessful and mediocre outcomes)\n- Probability of mediocre outcome: 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2\n\nExpected payoff for high effort:\n(0.6 * $3000) - (0.2 * $1000) - $1500 = $1800 - $200 - $1500 = $100\n\nLow effort:\n- Probability of success: 0.3\n- Probability of unsuccessful outcome: 0.7 * 0.5 = 0.35\n- Probability of mediocre outcome: 0.7 * 0.5 = 0.35\n\nExpected payoff for low effort:\n(0.3 * $3000) - (0.35 * $1000) - $500 = $900 - $350 - $500 = $50\n\nSince the expected payoff for high effort ($100) is greater than the expected payoff for low effort ($50), the optimal choice for the agent is to exert high effort.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected payoff for the principal:\n\nExpected payoff for principal with high effort:\n(0.6 * $3000) - (0.2 * $1000) = $1800 - $200 = $1600\n\nExpected payoff for principal with low effort:\n(0.3 * $3000) - (0.35 * $1000) = $900 - $350 = $550\n\nThe expected payoff for the principal is higher when the agent exerts high effort ($1600) compared to low effort ($550)."
