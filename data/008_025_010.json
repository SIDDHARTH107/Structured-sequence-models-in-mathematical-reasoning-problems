    "message_2": "First, let's try to simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n2x + 3y = 8\n\nNow we can see that both equations are the same. This means that the two lines represented by these equations are actually the same line. In this case, there are infinitely many solutions for this system, as every point on the line is a solution."
