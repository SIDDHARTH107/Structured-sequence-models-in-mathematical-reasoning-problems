    "message_2": "To solve for x, we can start by rewriting the equation:\n\n2^(x + 1) = 32\n\nWe know that 32 is also a power of 2 (2^5 = 32). So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2^(x + 1) = 2^5\n\nSince the bases are the same (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx + 1 = 5\n\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting 1 from both sides:\n\nx = 5 - 1\nx = 4\n\nSo, the solution is x = 4."
