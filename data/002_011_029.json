    "message_1": "A ladder is leaned against a wall such that the ladder makes a right angle with the ground. If the ladder is 20 feet tall and the base of the ladder is 16 feet away from the wall, what is the length of the ladder? Use the Pythagorean theorem to solve.",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the ladder acts as the hypotenuse, and the distance from the wall and the height of the wall act as the other two sides. Let's denote the length of the ladder as c, the distance from the wall as a (16 feet), and the height of the wall as b (20 feet).\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nWe are given a = 16 feet and b = 20 feet. Plugging these values into the equation:\n\nc² = (16)² + (20)²\nc² = 256 + 400\nc² = 656\n\nNow, to find the length of the ladder (c), we need to take the square root of 656:\n\nc = √656\nc ≈ 25.61 feet\n\nSo, the length of the ladder is approximately 25.61 feet."
