    "message_2": "To find f'(g(2)) using the chain rule, we first need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(t). \n\nLet's find the derivative of f(x) = (5x^3 - 4x^2 + 7x - 9)^4 with respect to x. Using the chain rule, we have:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [(5x^3 - 4x^2 + 7x - 9)^4]\n       = 4(5x^3 - 4x^2 + 7x - 9)^3 * d/dx (5x^3 - 4x^2 + 7x - 9)\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the inner function (5x^3 - 4x^2 + 7x - 9) with respect to x:\n\nd/dx (5x^3 - 4x^2 + 7x - 9) = 15x^2 - 8x + 7\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = 4(5x^3 - 4x^2 + 7x - 9)^3 * (15x^2 - 8x + 7)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of g(t) with respect to t. Since we don't have an explicit expression for g(t), we cannot find g'(t). However, we can still find f'(g(2)) using the given information that g(2) = 1.\n\nSince g(2) = 1, we can substitute this into the expression for f'(x):\n\nf'(g(2)) = f'(1) = 4(5(1)^3 - 4(1)^2 + 7(1) - 9)^3 * (15(1)^2 - 8(1) + 7)\n\nf'(1) = 4(5 - 4 + 7 - 9)^3 * (15 - 8 + 7)\n\nf'(1) = 4(-1)^3 * 14\n\nf'(1) = 4(-1) * 14\n\nf'(g(2)) = f'(1) = -56"
