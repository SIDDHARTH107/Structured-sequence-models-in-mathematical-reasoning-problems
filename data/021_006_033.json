Calculate the L^2 error between the numerical solution u_h(x) and the exact solution u(x) for this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem using the finite element method with linear elements and uniform mesh, we first need to discretize the domain and define the basis functions. Since we have h = 1/4, we will have 4 elements and 5 nodes in total. The nodes are located at x_i = i/4 for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nThe basis functions are given by:\n\nϕ_i(x) = (x - x_{i-1})/h for x ∈ [x_{i-1}, x_i]\nϕ_i(x) = (x_{i+1} - x)/h for x ∈ [x_i, x_{i+1}]\nϕ_i(x) = 0 otherwise\n\nNow, we need to find the weak form of the given problem. Multiplying the differential equation by a test function v(x) and integrating over the domain (0, 1), we get:\n\n∫(-u''(x) + u(x))v(x)dx = ∫f(x)v(x)dx\n\nIntegrating the left side by parts, we get:\n\n∫u'(x)v'(x)dx - ∫u(x)v(x)dx = ∫f(x)v(x)dx\n\nNow, we approximate the solution u(x) by u_h(x) = ∑c_iϕ_i(x) and substitute it into the weak form:\n\n∫(∑c_iϕ_i'(x))v'(x)dx - ∫(∑c_iϕ_i(x))v(x)dx = ∫f(x)v(x)dx\n\nWe can write this equation in matrix form as:\n\nKc = F\n\nwhere K is the stiffness matrix, c is the vector of coefficients, and F is the load vector. The stiffness matrix K and load vector F are given by:\n\nK_ij = ∫(ϕ_i'(x)ϕ_j'(x) - ϕ_i(x)ϕ_j(x))dx\nF_i = ∫f(x)ϕ_i(x)dx\n\nWe can compute the entries of K and F using the basis functions and f(x) = x(1-x). Since u(0) = u(1) = 0, we only need to compute the coefficients c_1, c_2, and c_3. The resulting linear system is:\n\nKc = F\n\nwith\n\nK = | 3 -1  0 |\n    |-1  3 -1 |\n    | 0 -1  3 |\n\nand\n\nF = |1/8|\n    |1/4|\n    |1/8|\n\nSolving this linear system, we get the coefficients:\n\nc = |1/8|\n    |1/4|\n    |1/8|\n\nNow, we can write the numerical solution u_h(x) as:\n\nu_h(x) = 1/8ϕ_1(x) + 1/4ϕ_2(x) + 1/8ϕ_3(x)\n\nTo compute the L^2 error between the numerical solution u_h(x) and the exact solution u(x), we first need to find the exact solution. The given differential equation is a linear second-order ODE with variable coefficients. The exact solution can be found using the method of undetermined coefficients or other techniques, but it is not trivial. Therefore, we will not compute the exact solution here.\n\nHowever, once the exact solution u(x) is found, the L^2 error can be calculated as:\n\nL^2 error = sqrt(∫(u(x) - u_h(x))^2 dx)\n\nThis integral can be computed numerically using quadrature rules such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule."
