    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x² - y² at the point (1, -1, 0), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms.\n\nLet S be the surface defined by the function F(x, y, z) = x² - y² - z = 0. The gradient of F is given by:\n\n∇F = (Fx, Fy, Fz) = (2x, -2y, -1)\n\nAt the point (1, -1, 0), the gradient is:\n\n∇F(1, -1, 0) = (2, 2, -1)\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form. The coefficients are given by:\n\nE = (∇F • ∇F) = (2² + 2² + (-1)²) = 9\nF = 0 (since the surface is given by an equation of the form z = f(x, y))\nG = (∇F • ∇F) = (2² + 2² + (-1)²) = 9\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form. The coefficients are given by:\n\nL = -Fxx / |∇F| = -2 / sqrt(9) = -2/3\nM = -Fxy / |∇F| = 0\nN = -Fyy / |∇F| = 2 / sqrt(9) = 2/3\n\nFinally, we compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M²) / (EG - F²)\n\nK = ((-2/3)(2/3) - 0²) / (9 - 0²) = (-4/9) / 9 = -4/81\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x² - y² at the point (1, -1, 0) is -4/81."
