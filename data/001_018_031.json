    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression, we'll use the properties of logarithms:\n\n1. log_b(a) + log_b(c) = log_b(ac)\n2. log_b(a) - log_b(c) = log_b(a/c)\n3. n * log_b(a) = log_b(a^n)\n\nNow, let's apply these properties to the given expression:\n\nlog(base 2) 16 + log(base 2) (1/4) - 2 log(base 2) 8\n\nFirst, we'll apply property 1:\n\nlog(base 2) (16 * 1/4) - 2 log(base 2) 8\n\nNow, we'll simplify the multiplication inside the logarithm:\n\nlog(base 2) 4 - 2 log(base 2) 8\n\nNext, we'll apply property 3 to the second term:\n\nlog(base 2) 4 - log(base 2) 8^2\n\nNow, we'll simplify the exponent inside the logarithm:\n\nlog(base 2) 4 - log(base 2) 64\n\nFinally, we'll apply property 2:\n\nlog(base 2) (4/64)\n\nNow, we'll simplify the division inside the logarithm:\n\nlog(base 2) (1/16)\n\nThis is the simplified logarithmic expression."
