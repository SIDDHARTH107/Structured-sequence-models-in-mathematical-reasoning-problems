    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg measuring 5 cm and the hypotenuse measuring 13 cm. What is the length of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs). Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nIn this problem, we are given the length of one leg (a = 5 cm) and the length of the hypotenuse (c = 13 cm). We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\n13² = 5² + b²\n169 = 25 + b²\n144 = b²\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides:\n\nb = √144\nb = 12\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 12 cm."
