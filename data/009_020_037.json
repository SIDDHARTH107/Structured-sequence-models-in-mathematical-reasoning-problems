If the initial concentration is 40, what is the concentration after 10 minutes if k = 0.03/min? Also, find the optimal concentration that maximizes the rate of reaction.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to solve the given differential equation y' = ky(100 - y) with the initial condition y(0) = 40.\n\nThis is a first-order separable differential equation. We can rewrite it as:\n\ndy/dt = ky(100 - y)\n\nRearrange the terms to separate the variables:\n\ndy/(y(100 - y)) = k dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/(y(100 - y))) dy = ∫ k dt\n\nTo solve the integral on the left side, we can use partial fraction decomposition:\n\n1/(y(100 - y)) = A/y + B/(100 - y)\n\n1 = A(100 - y) + By\n\nComparing the coefficients, we have:\n\nA = B\n100A = 1\n\nA = 1/100\nB = 1/100\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/100 (1/y + 1/(100 - y))) dy = ∫ 0.03 dt\n\n(1/100) (ln|y| - ln|100 - y|) = 0.03t + C\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition y(0) = 40:\n\n(1/100) (ln|40| - ln|60|) = C\n\nC = (1/100) (ln(2/3))\n\nNow, we have the general solution:\n\n(1/100) (ln|y| - ln|100 - y|) = 0.03t + (1/100) (ln(2/3))\n\nTo find the concentration after 10 minutes, plug in t = 10:\n\n(1/100) (ln|y| - ln|100 - y|) = 0.03(10) + (1/100) (ln(2/3))\n\n(1/100) (ln|y| - ln|100 - y|) = 0.3 + (1/100) (ln(2/3))\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\nln|y| - ln|100 - y| = 100(0.3 + ln(2/3))\n\nln(y/(100 - y)) = 30 + ln(2/3)\n\ny/(100 - y) = e^(30 + ln(2/3))\n\ny = (100 - y) * (2/3) * e^30\n\ny = 200/3 * e^30 - y * (2/3) * e^30\n\n(5/3)y = 200/3 * e^30\n\ny = 40 * e^30\n\nThe concentration after 10 minutes is approximately 40 * e^30.\n\nTo find the optimal concentration that maximizes the rate of reaction, we need to find the maximum of the function y' = ky(100 - y). To do this, we can take the derivative of y' with respect to y and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(y')/dy = k(100 - 2y)\n\nSet d(y')/dy = 0:\n\nk(100 - 2y) = 0\n\n100 - 2y = 0\n\ny = 50\n\nThe optimal concentration that maximizes the rate of reaction is 50."
