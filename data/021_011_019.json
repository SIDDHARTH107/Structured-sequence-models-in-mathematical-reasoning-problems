    "message_1": "Here's an example numerical problem:\n\nA manufacturing company produces two products, product X and product Y. Each unit of product X brings in $100 in profit, while each unit of product Y brings in $150 in profit. The company has a total of 60 units of raw materials and 80 hours of labor available. It takes 2 units of raw materials and 1 hour of labor to produce one unit of product X, while producing one unit of product Y requires 1 unit of raw materials and 2 hours of labor. Using the conjugate gradient method, what is the maximum profit the company can make?",
    "message_2": "The conjugate gradient method is not the most suitable method for solving this problem, as it is a linear programming problem. Instead, we can use the simplex method or graphical method to find the maximum profit. In this case, we will use the graphical method.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y. We have the following constraints:\n\n2x + y ≤ 60 (raw materials constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 80 (labor constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is:\n\nP = 100x + 150y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 60\ny ≤ -2x + 60\n\n2. x + 2y ≤ 80\ny ≤ -0.5x + 40\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points A(0,0), B(0,40), C(20,30), and D(30,0). Now, we will evaluate the objective function at each of these vertices:\n\nP(A) = 100(0) + 150(0) = $0\nP(B) = 100(0) + 150(40) = $6,000\nP(C) = 100(20) + 150(30) = $6,500\nP(D) = 100(30) + 150(0) = $3,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point C, with 20 units of product X and 30 units of product Y, resulting in a profit of $6,500."
