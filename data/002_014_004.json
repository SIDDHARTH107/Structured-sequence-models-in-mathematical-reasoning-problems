    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 12 cm, width of 8 cm, and height of 5 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has 6 faces: top, bottom, front, back, left, and right.\n\nThe area of the top and bottom faces can be found by multiplying the length by the width:\nArea_top/bottom = 12 cm * 8 cm = 96 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, we multiply by 2:\n2 * 96 cm² = 192 cm²\n\nThe area of the front and back faces can be found by multiplying the length by the height:\nArea_front/back = 12 cm * 5 cm = 60 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, we multiply by 2:\n2 * 60 cm² = 120 cm²\n\nThe area of the left and right faces can be found by multiplying the width by the height:\nArea_left/right = 8 cm * 5 cm = 40 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, we multiply by 2:\n2 * 40 cm² = 80 cm²\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together:\nSurface area = 192 cm² + 120 cm² + 80 cm² = 392 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 392 cm²."
