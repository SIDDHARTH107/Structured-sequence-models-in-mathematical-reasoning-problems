    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F) in the graph G:\n\nV = 16 (vertices)\nE = 24 (edges)\n\nTo find the number of faces (F), we can use the fact that each face is surrounded by at least 3 edges. So, we can divide the total number of edges by 3 and round up to get the minimum number of faces:\n\nF = ceil(E/3) = ceil(24/3) = 8\n\nNow, we can plug these values into Euler's formula:\n\n16 - 24 + 8 = 2 - 2g\n0 = 2 - 2g\ng = 1\n\nSo, the genus of the given graph G is 1."
