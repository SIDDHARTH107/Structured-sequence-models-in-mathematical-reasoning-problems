    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 20. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (i.e., subgroups of order 2) divides the order of the group and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. In this case, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 20 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are 1 and 5.\n\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let H be the unique Sylow 2-subgroup, and let K be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Since the orders of H and K are relatively prime, by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G is a semidirect product of H and K. In this case, G is either the cyclic group C20 (if the action of K on H is trivial) or the dihedral group D10 (if the action of K on H is nontrivial).\n\nIf there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, then each of them contains one element of order 2 (besides the identity). Since these subgroups are distinct, there are 5 elements of order 2 in G. In this case, G cannot be isomorphic to C20 or D10, as neither of these groups has 5 elements of order 2. Therefore, G must be a non-abelian group of order 20.\n\nIn summary, there can be either 1 or 5 elements of order 2 in a group of order 20. The possible types of such groups are the cyclic group C20, the dihedral group D10, and the non-abelian group of order 20."
