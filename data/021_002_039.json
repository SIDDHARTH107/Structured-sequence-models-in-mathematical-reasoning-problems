    "message_2": "To find the eigenvector and eigenvalue for the largest eigenvalue using the power iteration method, follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose an initial vector b0 with non-zero components. For simplicity, let's choose b0 = [1; 1].\n2. Perform the following steps iteratively:\n   a. Calculate the product of the matrix A and the vector b: Ab\n   b. Normalize the resulting vector Ab to get the new vector b.\n   c. Repeat steps a and b until the vector b converges.\n\nLet's perform the power iteration method:\n\nIteration 1:\nb0 = [1; 1]\nAb0 = [5*1 + 1*1; 2*1 + 4*1] = [6; 6]\nb1 = Ab0 / ||Ab0|| = [6/7.211; 6/7.211] = [0.832; 0.832]\n\nIteration 2:\nAb1 = [5*0.832 + 1*0.832; 2*0.832 + 4*0.832] = [4.992; 4.992]\nb2 = Ab1 / ||Ab1|| = [4.992/7.070; 4.992/7.070] = [0.707; 0.707]\n\nIteration 3:\nAb2 = [5*0.707 + 1*0.707; 2*0.707 + 4*0.707] = [4.242; 4.242]\nb3 = Ab2 / ||Ab2|| = [4.242/6.000; 4.242/6.000] = [0.707; 0.707]\n\nThe vector b has converged to [0.707; 0.707]. This is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. To find the eigenvalue, we can use the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nEigenvalue = (b^T * A * b) / (b^T * b)\n\nEigenvalue = ([0.707 0.707] * [5 1; 2 4] * [0.707; 0.707]) / ([0.707 0.707] * [0.707; 0.707])\n\nEigenvalue = (6) / (1) = 6\n\nSo, the largest eigenvalue is 6, and the corresponding eigenvector is [0.707; 0.707]."
