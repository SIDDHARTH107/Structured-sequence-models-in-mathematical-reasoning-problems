    "message_1": "Let $C$ be a smooth algebraic curve of genus $g\\geq 0$ over an algebraically closed field $k$. Suppose that $D$ is an effective divisor of degree $d$ on $C$. What is the dimension of the vector space $H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D))$ of global sections of the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D)$?",
    "message_2": "The dimension of the vector space $H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D))$ of global sections of the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D)$ is given by the Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor $D$ on a smooth algebraic curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = d - g + 1$\n\nwhere $l(D)$ denotes the dimension of the vector space $H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D))$, $K_C$ is the canonical divisor of $C$, and $d$ is the degree of the divisor $D$. \n\nSince $D$ is an effective divisor, we have $l(K_C - D) \\geq 0$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$l(D) \\geq d - g + 1$\n\nNow, we need to find the exact value of $l(D)$. This depends on the specific curve $C$ and the divisor $D$. In general, we can't give an explicit formula for $l(D)$ without more information about the curve and the divisor. However, we can say that the dimension of the vector space $H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D))$ is at least $d - g + 1$."
