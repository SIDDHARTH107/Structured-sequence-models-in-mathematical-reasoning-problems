    "message_1": "Consider the algebraic variety given by the equation:\n\n$$V: x^2+y^2+z^2-2xyz=0$$\n\nLet $C$ be the curve on $V$ given by the intersection of $V$ with the plane $x+y+z=0$. Compute the degree of $C$.",
    "message_2": "To find the degree of the curve $C$, we first need to find the equation of the curve by substituting the equation of the plane into the equation of the variety $V$.\n\nThe equation of the plane is $x + y + z = 0$. We can solve for one of the variables, say $z$, and get $z = -x - y$. Now, substitute this into the equation of the variety $V$:\n\n$$x^2 + y^2 + (-x - y)^2 - 2xy(-x - y) = 0$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$x^2 + y^2 + x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 2x^2y - 2y^2x = 0$$\n\n$$2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2xy - 2x^2y - 2y^2x = 0$$\n\nNow, let's find the degree of this equation. The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of its variables. The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of its terms. In our case, the terms with the highest degree are $-2x^2y$ and $-2y^2x$, both with degree $3$. Therefore, the degree of the curve $C$ is $3$."
