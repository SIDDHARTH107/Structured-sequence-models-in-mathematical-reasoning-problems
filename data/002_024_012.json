    "message_1": "A trapezium with bases of length 6 cm and 12 cm and a height of 8 cm is given. Find its perimeter in centimeters.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides (the non-parallel sides). Let's call these sides a and b.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of these sides. Since the trapezium is not an isosceles trapezium, we need to divide it into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the vertices of the shorter base (6 cm) to the longer base (12 cm).\n\nLet's call the point where the perpendicular line meets the longer base as point M. Now, we have two right triangles: one with legs of length 8 cm and (12 - 6)/2 = 3 cm, and the other with legs of length 8 cm and 6 + 3 = 9 cm.\n\nFor the first right triangle, we have:\na^2 = 8^2 + 3^2\na^2 = 64 + 9\na^2 = 73\na = √73\n\nFor the second right triangle, we have:\nb^2 = 8^2 + 9^2\nb^2 = 64 + 81\nb^2 = 145\nb = √145\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding the lengths of all four sides:\nPerimeter = 6 + 12 + √73 + √145\nPerimeter ≈ 18 + 8.54 + 12.04\nPerimeter ≈ 38.58 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 38.58 centimeters."
