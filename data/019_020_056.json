    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values in a list of size n, you can iterate through the list once, comparing each element to the current maximum and minimum values. If an element is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum value. If an element is less than the current minimum, update the minimum value.\n\nSince you only need to iterate through the list once, the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the list."
