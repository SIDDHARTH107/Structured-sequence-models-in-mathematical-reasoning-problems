    "message_2": "To determine whether the given group is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. A cyclic group of order n has exactly one element of order d for each divisor d of n.\n2. A group of order p^n (where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer) is called a p-group. In a p-group, the number of elements of order p is a multiple of p-1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given group:\n\n1. The group has order 27, which is 3^3, so it's a 3-group.\n2. There is exactly 1 element of order 1 (the identity element), which is consistent with both cyclic and non-abelian groups.\n3. There are 9 elements of order 3. Since 9 is a multiple of 3-1=2, this is consistent with the group being a 3-group. However, a cyclic group of order 27 would have exactly one element of order 3 (since 3 is a divisor of 27), so this fact contradicts the group being cyclic.\n4. There are 17 elements of order 27. This is not a multiple of 3-1=2, so this fact contradicts the group being a 3-group.\n\nBased on the given information, the group cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group C27, as it has more than one element of order 3. However, the number of elements of order 27 does not follow the property of a 3-group, which means that the given information is inconsistent, and we cannot conclude that the group is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27 either."
