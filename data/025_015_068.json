    "message_2": "To find the points where the surface intersects the xz-plane, we need to set y = 0 since the xz-plane is defined by all points with y-coordinate equal to 0. The equation of the surface becomes:\n\n3x^2 - 2(0)^2 + z^2 = 1\n3x^2 + z^2 = 1\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for x and z. This is an equation of an ellipse in the xz-plane. To find the points of intersection, we can solve for x or z in terms of the other variable.\n\nLet's solve for x:\n\n3x^2 = 1 - z^2\nx^2 = (1 - z^2) / 3\nx = ±√((1 - z^2) / 3)\n\nNow, we can find the points where the surface intersects the xz-plane by considering the range of z values for which the equation is valid. Since the equation represents an ellipse, z will range from -1 to 1.\n\nFor z = -1:\nx = ±√((1 - (-1)^2) / 3) = ±√(0) = 0\n\nFor z = 1:\nx = ±√((1 - 1^2) / 3) = ±√(0) = 0\n\nFor z = 0:\nx = ±√((1 - 0^2) / 3) = ±√(1/3)\n\nSo, the points where the surface intersects the xz-plane are:\n\n(√(1/3), 0, -1), (-√(1/3), 0, -1), (√(1/3), 0, 1), and (-√(1/3), 0, 1)."
