    "message_1": "A certain community has a population of 10,000 people. A contagious disease is spreading through the community, and the governing body has predicted that the spread can be modeled using the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = 0.0002 P (10000 - P)\n\nwhere P is the number of people infected at time t. If the initial number of infected individuals is 100, how many people will be infected after 2 weeks (14 days)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to solve the given differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = 0.0002 P (10000 - P)\n\nThis is a separable differential equation, so we can rewrite it as:\n\n(1/P) dP = 0.0002 (10000 - P) dt\n\nNow, we integrate both sides:\n\n∫ (1/P) dP = ∫ 0.0002 (10000 - P) dt\n\nLet's solve the left side of the equation:\n\n∫ (1/P) dP = ln|P| + C1\n\nNow, let's solve the right side of the equation:\n\n∫ 0.0002 (10000 - P) dt = 0.0002 (10000t - (1/2)Pt) + C2\n\nNow, we can combine both sides of the equation:\n\nln|P| = 0.0002 (10000t - (1/2)Pt) + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition that P(0) = 100:\n\nln|100| = 0.0002 (10000(0) - (1/2)(100)(0)) + C\n\nln|100| = C\n\nC = ln|100|\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln|P| = 0.0002 (10000t - (1/2)Pt) + ln|100|\n\nTo solve for P, we can take the exponent of both sides:\n\nP = e^(0.0002 (10000t - (1/2)Pt) + ln|100|)\n\nNow, we can plug in t = 14 days to find the number of infected individuals after 2 weeks:\n\nP(14) = e^(0.0002 (10000(14) - (1/2)P(14)(14)) + ln|100|)\n\nLet's denote P(14) as P14:\n\nP14 = e^(0.0002 (10000(14) - (1/2)P14(14)) + ln|100|)\n\nTo solve for P14, we can use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or a root-finding algorithm. Using a calculator or software, we find:\n\nP14 ≈ 8637\n\nSo, after 2 weeks (14 days), approximately 8637 people will be infected in the community."
