    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x + 2)(2x - 1) using the product rule, we first need to identify the two functions being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2\nv(x) = 2x - 1\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of these functions:\n\nu'(x) = 2x + 3\nv'(x) = 2\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. In other words:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nNow, we just need to plug in the functions and their derivatives:\n\nf'(x) = (2x + 3)(2x - 1) + (x^2 + 3x + 2)(2)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = (4x^2 - 2x + 6x - 3) + (2x^2 + 6x + 4)\n\nf'(x) = 4x^2 + 4x - 3 + 2x^2 + 6x + 4\n\nFinally, combine like terms:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x + 1\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x + 2)(2x - 1) is f'(x) = 6x^2 + 10x + 1."
