    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The number of smaller tetrahedra at each level of iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of tetrahedra at level n = 4^n\n\nTo find the total number of smaller tetrahedra required to build the Sierpinski tetrahedron up to the 4th level of iteration, we need to sum the number of tetrahedra at each level from 1 to 4:\n\nTotal tetrahedra = (4^1) + (4^2) + (4^3) + (4^4)\nTotal tetrahedra = 4 + 16 + 64 + 256\nTotal tetrahedra = 340\n\nSo, a total of 340 smaller tetrahedra are required to build the Sierpinski tetrahedron up to the 4th level of iteration."
