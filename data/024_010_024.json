    "message_2": "To find the Levi-Civita connection of the given Riemannian metric $g = dx^2 + 4dy^2$, we need to compute the Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols are given by the following formula:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})$$\n\nHere, $g^{kl}$ is the inverse of the metric tensor $g_{kl}$. In our case, the metric tensor is given by:\n\n$$g_{kl} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe inverse of this matrix is:\n\n$$g^{kl} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{4} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the metric tensor components:\n\n$$\\partial_i g_{jl} = \\partial_j g_{il} = \\partial_l g_{ij} = 0$$\n\nThis is because the metric tensor components are constants and their partial derivatives with respect to any coordinate are zero.\n\nThus, the Christoffel symbols are:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij}) = 0$$\n\nSo, all the Christoffel symbols are zero at any point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. In particular, they are also zero at the point $(1, 2)$."
