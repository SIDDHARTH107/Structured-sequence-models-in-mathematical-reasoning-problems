    "message_2": "The Henon-Heiles system is a 2D Hamiltonian system that describes the motion of a particle in a plane under the influence of a potential. The Hamiltonian for the system is given by:\n\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y) = 1/2 (p_x^2 + p_y^2) + 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) + x^2*y - 1/3*y^3\n\nwhere x and y are the position coordinates, and p_x and p_y are the corresponding momenta. The equations of motion for the system are derived from Hamilton's equations:\n\ndx/dt = ∂H/∂p_x = p_x\ndy/dt = ∂H/∂p_y = p_y\ndp_x/dt = -∂H/∂x = -x - 2*x*y\ndp_y/dt = -∂H/∂y = -y - x^2 + y^2\n\nTo solve the system with the given initial conditions x(0) = 0.1, y(0) = 0.2, p_x(0) = 0.1, and p_y(0) = 0.1 for a total time T = 100, we need to numerically integrate these equations of motion. This can be done using various numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method or the Verlet algorithm.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I cannot perform numerical computations directly. To solve this problem, you can use a numerical solver in a programming language like Python, MATLAB, or Mathematica. Here's an example of how to do this in Python using the SciPy library:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef henon_heiles(t, state):\n    x, y, p_x, p_y = state\n    dxdt = p_x\n    dydt = p_y\n    dp_xdt = -x - 2*x*y\n    dp_ydt = -y - x**2 + y**2\n    return [dxdt, dydt, dp_xdt, dp_ydt]\n\ninitial_conditions = [0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1]\nt_span = (0, 100)\nt_eval = np.linspace(0, 100, 1000)\n\nsolution = solve_ivp(henon_heiles, t_span, initial_conditions, t_eval=t_eval)\n\nplt.plot(solution.y[0], solution.y[1])\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.title('Henon-Heiles Orbit')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code will plot the orbit of the Henon-Heiles system with the given initial conditions for a total time T = 100."
