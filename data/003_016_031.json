    "message_2": "The general form of a cosine function is y = A*cos(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn the given function, y = 3cos(2x - π/4), we can see that A = 3, B = 2, and C = π/4. There is no vertical shift, so D = 0.\n\nThe phase shift is C, which is π/4. However, to find the actual phase shift, we need to divide it by the frequency (B). So, the phase shift is (π/4) / 2 = π/8.\n\nTherefore, the phase shift of the function is π/8."
