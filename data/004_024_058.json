    "message_2": "To find the value of dy/dx at point (2,1), we first need to differentiate the given equation with respect to x using implicit differentiation. \n\nGiven equation: x^2y^3 + xy^2 = 9\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx(x^2y^3) + d/dx(xy^2) = d/dx(9)\n\nUsing the product rule for differentiation, (uv)' = u'v + uv':\n\n(2x*y^3 + x^2 * 3y^2 * dy/dx) + (y^2 + x * 2y * dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we plug in the point (2,1) into the equation:\n\n(2*2*1^3 + 2^2 * 3*1^2 * dy/dx) + (1^2 + 2 * 2*1 * dy/dx) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n(4 + 12 * dy/dx) + (1 + 4 * dy/dx) = 0\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n16 * dy/dx = -5\n\nNow, solve for dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = -5/16\n\nSo, the value of dy/dx at point (2,1) is -5/16."
