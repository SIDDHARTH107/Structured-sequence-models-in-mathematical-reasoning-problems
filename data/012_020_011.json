In other words, an automorphism is a bijective function that maps the vertices of the graph onto itself such that the edge structure is preserved.\n\nFor the given graph G, we can find the automorphism group by considering the possible permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relation.\n\n1. The identity automorphism: A -> A, B -> B, C -> C, D -> D, E -> E\n2. Swapping B and E: A -> A, B -> E, C -> C, D -> D, E -> B\n3. Swapping B and C: A -> A, B -> C, C -> B, D -> D, E -> E\n4. Swapping B, C, and E: A -> A, B -> E, C -> B, D -> D, E -> C\n\nThese are the only automorphisms that preserve the adjacency relation in graph G. Therefore, the automorphism group of G is:\n\nAut(G) = { (A, B, C, D, E), (A, E, C, D, B), (A, C, B, D, E), (A, E, B, D, C) }"
