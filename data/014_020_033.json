    "message_2": "To find the ciphertext using the Vigenere square, we first need to repeat the key \"MATH\" to match the length of the plaintext \"NUMBERS\". The repeated key is \"MATHMA\".\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere square to encrypt each letter of the plaintext using the corresponding letter of the repeated key.\n\n1. N (plaintext) and M (key): The intersection of row N and column M in the Vigenere square is Z.\n2. U (plaintext) and A (key): Since A doesn't shift the letter, the encrypted letter remains U.\n3. M (plaintext) and T (key): The intersection of row M and column T in the Vigenere square is W.\n4. B (plaintext) and H (key): The intersection of row B and column H in the Vigenere square is I.\n5. E (plaintext) and M (key): The intersection of row E and column M in the Vigenere square is R.\n6. R (plaintext) and A (key): Since A doesn't shift the letter, the encrypted letter remains R.\n\nSo, the ciphertext for the plaintext \"NUMBERS\" using the key \"MATH\" is \"ZUWIRR\"."
