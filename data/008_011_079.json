    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing the columns with the constants (Dx, Dy, Dz). Finally, we will find the values of x, y, and z by dividing the determinants of the matrices by the determinant of the coefficient matrix.\n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n\n| 1  2  3 |\n| 2  3  1 |\n| 3  1  1 |\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D):\n\nD = | 1  2  3 | = 1 * | 3  1 | - 2 * | 2  1 | + 3 * | 2  3 |\n    | 2  3  1 |       | 1  1 |       | 3  1 |       | 3  1 |\n\nD = 1 * (3 - 1) - 2 * (2 - 3) + 3 * (2 - 9)\nD = 1 * 2 + 2 * 1 - 3 * 7\nD = 2 + 2 - 21\nD = -17\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the first column with the constants (Dx):\n\nDx = | 10  2  3 | = 10 * | 3  1 | - 2 * | 5  1 | + 3 * | 5  3 |\n     |  5  3  1 |        | 1  1 |       | 8  1 |       | 8  1 |\n\nDx = 10 * (3 - 1) - 2 * (5 - 8) + 3 * (5 - 24)\nDx = 10 * 2 + 2 * 3 - 3 * 19\nDx = 20 + 6 - 57\nDx = -31\n\nNow, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the second column with the constants (Dy):\n\nDy = | 1  10  3 | = 1 * | 5  1 | - 10 * | 2  1 | + 3 * | 2  5 |\n     | 2   5  1 |       | 8  1 |        | 3  1 |       | 3  8 |\n\nDy = 1 * (5 - 8) - 10 * (2 - 3) + 3 * (16 - 15)\nDy = -3 + 10 + 3\nDy = 10\n\nFinally, let's find the determinant of the matrix obtained by replacing the third column with the constants (Dz):\n\nDz = | 1  2  10 | = 1 * | 2  5 | - 2 * | 3  5 | + 10 * | 3  2 |\n     | 2  3   5 |       | 3  8 |       | 1  8 |        | 1  3 |\n\nDz = 1 * (16 - 15) - 2 * (24 - 5) + 10 * (3 - 2)\nDz = 1 - 2 * 19 + 10\nDz = 1 - 38 + 10\nDz = -27\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nx = Dx / D = -31 / -17 = 31/17\ny = Dy / D = 10 / -17 = -10/17\nz = Dz / D = -27 / -17 = 27/17\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 31/17\ny = -10/17\nz = 27/17"
