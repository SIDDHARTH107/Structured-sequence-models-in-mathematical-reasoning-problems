    "message_1": "What is the perimeter of the 4th iteration of the Vicsek fractal if the initial square has a side length of 1 unit?\n\n(Note: The Vicsek fractal is created by dividing a square into 9 equal smaller squares and removing the center one, then repeating the process with each remaining square. The self-similarity property means that the shape of the fractal remains the same no matter what scale it is viewed at.)",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the 4th iteration of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nPerimeter = P * (N ^ k)\n\nwhere P is the initial perimeter, N is the scaling factor, and k is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, the initial perimeter P is 4 (since the initial square has a side length of 1 unit), and the scaling factor N is 3 (since each side is divided into 3 equal parts).\n\nSo, for the 4th iteration (k = 4), we have:\n\nPerimeter = 4 * (3 ^ 4)\nPerimeter = 4 * 81\nPerimeter = 324\n\nThe perimeter of the 4th iteration of the Vicsek fractal with an initial side length of 1 unit is 324 units."
