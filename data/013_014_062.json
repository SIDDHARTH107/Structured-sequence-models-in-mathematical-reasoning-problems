The auction is set up such that the highest bidder wins the item and pays the second-highest price. More specifically, if bidder 1 bids b₁ and bidder 2 bids b₂, then bidder 1 receives the item and pays b₂ if b₁ > b₂; otherwise, bidder 2 receives the item and pays b₁ (i.e. the winner pays the price of the second-highest bid). \n\nIf bidder 1's private valuation is 20 dollars and bidder 2's private valuation is 30 dollars, what amount should each bidder bid in order to maximize their expected utility? Assume that each bidder wants to maximize their expected utility, and that the valuations are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniformly between 1 dollar and 50 dollars.",
    "message_2": "In this second-price auction, also known as a Vickrey auction, the dominant strategy for each bidder is to bid their true valuation. This is because bidding their true valuation maximizes their expected utility, regardless of the other bidder's strategy.\n\nTo see why this is the case, let's consider bidder 1 with a valuation of 20 dollars. If bidder 1 bids below their valuation, say 15 dollars, they risk losing the auction to bidder 2 even if bidder 2's valuation is lower than 20 dollars. In this case, bidder 1 would have won the auction by bidding their true valuation and would have paid a price lower than their valuation, resulting in positive utility. By bidding below their valuation, bidder 1 decreases their chances of winning the auction and thus decreases their expected utility.\n\nOn the other hand, if bidder 1 bids above their valuation, say 25 dollars, they risk winning the auction but paying more than their valuation, resulting in negative utility. Since the winner pays the second-highest bid, bidding above their valuation does not increase the price they would pay if they win, but it does increase the risk of winning the auction at a price higher than their valuation, which decreases their expected utility.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy for each bidder is to bid their true valuation. In this case, bidder 1 should bid 20 dollars, and bidder 2 should bid 30 dollars."
