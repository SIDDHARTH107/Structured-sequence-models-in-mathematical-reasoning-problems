Determine the number of points that fall inside a quarter of the unit circle that is centered at the origin, and use this value to estimate the value of pi.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the value of pi using the Monte Carlo simulation, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Generate 10,000 random points within the square bounded by the coordinates (-1, -1) and (1, 1).\n2. Count the number of points that fall inside a quarter of the unit circle centered at the origin.\n3. Use the ratio of points inside the quarter circle to the total points to estimate the value of pi.\n\nSince we are not able to generate random points here, let's assume that we have generated 10,000 random points and N of them fall inside the quarter of the unit circle.\n\nThe area of the square is 2 * 2 = 4 square units, and the area of the quarter circle is (pi * (1^2)) / 4, where 1 is the radius of the circle. The ratio of the area of the quarter circle to the area of the square is:\n\n(pi/4) / 4 = pi / 16\n\nNow, we can use the ratio of points inside the quarter circle to the total points to estimate the value of pi:\n\n(N / 10,000) = pi / 16\n\nTo estimate the value of pi, we can rearrange the equation:\n\npi = 16 * (N / 10,000)\n\nOnce you have the value of N (the number of points inside the quarter circle), you can plug it into the equation above to estimate the value of pi."
