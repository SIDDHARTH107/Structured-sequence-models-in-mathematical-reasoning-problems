    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2/x) + (3/x^2) = 1/4, we will first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator for x and x^2 is x^2. \n\nNow, we will rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:\n\n(2x/x^2) + (3/x^2) = 1/4\n\nNow that the fractions on the left side of the equation have the same denominator, we can combine them:\n\n(2x + 3)/x^2 = 1/4\n\nTo solve for x, we will first cross-multiply:\n\n4(2x + 3) = x^2\n\nNow, distribute the 4:\n\n8x + 12 = x^2\n\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 8x - 12 = 0\n\nNow, we will solve the quadratic equation. We can do this by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. In this case, we will use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 1, b = -8, and c = -12. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nx = (8 ± √((-8)^2 - 4(1)(-12))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (8 ± √(64 + 48)) / 2\n\nx = (8 ± √112) / 2\n\nx = (8 ± 4√7) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify by dividing each term by 2:\n\nx = 4 ± 2√7\n\nSo, the two possible solutions for x are:\n\nx = 4 + 2√7 and x = 4 - 2√7"
