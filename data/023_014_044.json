    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(x^2/2), we will use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = ∫[from -infinity to +infinity] f(x) e^(-ikx) dx\n\nFirst, let's plug in the given function f(x) = e^(x^2/2) into the definition:\n\nF(k) = ∫[from -infinity to +infinity] e^(x^2/2) e^(-ikx) dx\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials:\n\nF(k) = ∫[from -infinity to +infinity] e^(x^2/2 - ikx) dx\n\nThis integral is not easy to solve directly, but we can use a trick by completing the square in the exponent. Let's rewrite the exponent as follows:\n\nx^2/2 - ikx = (x^2 - 2ikx)/2\n\nNow, we need to add and subtract a term to complete the square:\n\n(x^2 - 2ikx + (ik)^2) / 2 - (ik)^2 / 2\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n((x - ik)^2) / 2 - (k^2) / 2\n\nNow, we can rewrite the Fourier transform with the completed square:\n\nF(k) = ∫[from -infinity to +infinity] e^(((x - ik)^2) / 2 - (k^2) / 2) dx\n\nNext, we can separate the exponentials:\n\nF(k) = e^(-(k^2) / 2) ∫[from -infinity to +infinity] e^(((x - ik)^2) / 2) dx\n\nNow, we recognize that the remaining integral is a Gaussian integral with a complex shift. The Gaussian integral is given by:\n\n∫[from -infinity to +infinity] e^(-ax^2) dx = sqrt(pi/a)\n\nIn our case, a = 1/2, and the complex shift does not affect the result of the integral. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n\n∫[from -infinity to +infinity] e^(((x - ik)^2) / 2) dx = sqrt(pi/(1/2)) = sqrt(2pi)\n\nFinally, we can write the Fourier transform as:\n\nF(k) = e^(-(k^2) / 2) * sqrt(2pi)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(x^2/2) is:\n\nF(k) = sqrt(2pi) * e^(-(k^2) / 2)"
