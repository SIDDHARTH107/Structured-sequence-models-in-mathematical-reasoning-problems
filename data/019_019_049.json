    "message_2": "The function f(x) = x^2 + 1 is computable because it can be calculated using a finite number of steps for any given input x.\n\nAlgorithm to compute the value of f(x) for a given input x:\n\n1. Take the input value x.\n2. Multiply x by itself (x * x) to get x^2.\n3. Add 1 to the result of x^2 (x^2 + 1).\n4. The result is the value of f(x).\n\nFor example, if the input value x is 3, the algorithm would compute f(3) as follows:\n\n1. Take the input value x = 3.\n2. Multiply x by itself (3 * 3) to get x^2 = 9.\n3. Add 1 to the result of x^2 (9 + 1) = 10.\n4. The result is the value of f(3) = 10."
