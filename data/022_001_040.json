    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the function f(z) = sqrt(z-1) with a branch cut along the negative real axis, we first rewrite the function in polar form. Let w = z - 1, so f(z) = sqrt(w). \n\nNow, let's express w in polar form: w = r * e^(iθ), where r = |w| and θ is the argument of w. Since we have a branch cut along the negative real axis, we choose the principal value of the argument, which is in the range (-π, π]. \n\nFor the given point z = 2 + 3i, we have w = z - 1 = 1 + 3i. To find r and θ, we use the following formulas:\n\nr = |w| = sqrt(Re(w)^2 + Im(w)^2) = sqrt(1^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(10)\nθ = arg(w) = atan2(Im(w), Re(w)) = atan2(3, 1) ≈ 1.249\n\nNow, we can write w in polar form: w = sqrt(10) * e^(1.249i)\n\nNext, we find the square root of w:\n\nsqrt(w) = sqrt(r) * e^(iθ/2) = sqrt(sqrt(10)) * e^(1.249i/2)\n\nNow, we can find the square root of 10 and divide the angle by 2:\n\nsqrt(sqrt(10)) ≈ 1.778\n1.249/2 ≈ 0.625\n\nSo, the analytic continuation of f(z) = sqrt(z-1) at the point z = 2 + 3i is:\n\nf(z) = 1.778 * e^(0.625i)\n\nFinally, we convert this back to rectangular form:\n\nf(z) = 1.778 * (cos(0.625) + i * sin(0.625)) ≈ 1.674 + 1.080i\n\nThus, the analytic continuation of f(z) = sqrt(z-1) at the point z = 2 + 3i is approximately 1.674 + 1.080i."
