    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 180 and 216, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (216) by the smaller number (180) and find the remainder.\n   216 รท 180 = 1 with a remainder of 36.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (216) with the smaller number (180) and the smaller number with the remainder (36).\n   Now we need to find the GCD of 180 and 36.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (180) by the smaller number (36) and find the remainder.\n   180 รท 36 = 5 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 36. Therefore, the GCD of 180 and 216 is 36."
