    "message_2": "To color the vertices of this graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need a minimum of 3 colors. \n\nHere's one possible coloring:\n\n1. Color A with color 1\n2. Color B with color 2\n3. Color C with color 3\n4. Color D with color 2\n5. Color E with color 1\n\nIn this coloring, no two adjacent vertices have the same color."
