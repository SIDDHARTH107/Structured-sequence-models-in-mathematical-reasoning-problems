    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a periodic signal can be found using the Fourier series representation. For a given function f(t) with period T, the Fourier series representation is given by:\n\nf(t) = a0 + Σ[an * cos(nω0t) + bn * sin(nω0t)]\n\nwhere ω0 = 2π/T, an and bn are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is from n=1 to infinity.\n\nIn this case, f(t) is already given as a sum of sine functions:\n\nf(t) = 3sin(2πt) + 2sin(4πt) + sin(6πt)\n\nComparing this to the Fourier series representation, we can see that:\n\na0 = 0\nb1 = 3, b2 = 2, b3 = 1, and all other bn = 0 for n > 3\nan = 0 for all n\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of the given function is:\n\nf(t) = 3sin(2πt) + 2sin(4πt) + sin(6πt)\n\nThe Fourier transform is not applicable to periodic functions, as it is used for non-periodic functions. However, the Fourier series representation provides the frequency-domain representation of the periodic signal, which is the goal of the Fourier transform."
