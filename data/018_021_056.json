    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 3, 4, 5} be two sets. Find the symmetric difference of the two sets, and then find the intersection of the symmetric difference of A and B with the set C = {2, 3}. Prove that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the intersection of A, B, and C.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the symmetric difference of A and B with the set C = {2, 3}.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ C = {1, 5} ∩ {2, 3}\n\nSince there are no common elements between the two sets, their intersection is an empty set:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ C = ∅\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the intersection of A, B, and C. To do this, we need to show that:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B ∩ C) = (A ∆ B) ∩ A ∩ B ∩ C\n\nSince (A ∆ B) = {1, 5} and A ∩ B ∩ C = {2, 3} ∩ {4}, which is an empty set, we have:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ (A ∩ B ∩ C) = {1, 5} ∩ ∅ = ∅\n\nOn the other hand,\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ A ∩ B ∩ C = {1, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4, 5} ∩ {2, 3} = ∅\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, we have proven that the symmetric difference of A and B is distributive over the intersection of A, B, and C."
