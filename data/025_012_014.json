    "message_2": "To find the equation of an elliptic curve in Weierstrass form with discriminant -163, we need to find the values of a, b, and c such that the discriminant Δ = -16(4a^3c + 27b^2c^2 - a^2b^2c + 18abc - 4ac^3 - 27b^2) = -163.\n\nLet's first simplify the equation by setting a = 0. This will make the equation easier to work with, and it will still be a valid elliptic curve. Now, the equation takes the form y^2 + xy + y = x^3 + bx + c.\n\nThe discriminant simplifies to Δ = -16(27b^2c^2 + 18bc - 4c^3 - 27b^2) = -163.\n\nNow, let's try some small integer values for b and c to see if we can find a solution that satisfies the discriminant equation. After some trial and error, we find that b = 1 and c = 1 satisfy the equation:\n\nΔ = -16(27(1)^2(1)^2 + 18(1)(1) - 4(1)^3 - 27(1)^2) = -163.\n\nSo, the equation of the elliptic curve in Weierstrass form with discriminant -163 is:\n\ny^2 + xy + y = x^3 + x + 1."
