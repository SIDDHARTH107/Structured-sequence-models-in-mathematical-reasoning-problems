    "message_2": "To solve this stochastic differential equation (SDE), we first rewrite it in the form of a linear SDE:\n\ndX = (0.5X)dt + (0.1X)dW\n\nThis SDE has the form:\n\ndX = (μX)dt + (σX)dW\n\nwhere μ = 0.5 and σ = 0.1.\n\nNow, we can use the solution of a linear SDE, which is given by:\n\nX(t) = X(0) * exp((μ - (σ^2)/2)t + σW(t))\n\nIn our case, X(0) = 1, μ = 0.5, σ = 0.1, and t = 2. So, we have:\n\nX(2) = exp((0.5 - (0.1^2)/2) * 2 + 0.1 * W(2))\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected value and variance of X(2).\n\nExpected value:\n\nE[X(2)] = E[exp((0.5 - (0.1^2)/2) * 2 + 0.1 * W(2))]\n\nSince W(t) is a normal random variable with mean 0 and variance t, W(2) is a normal random variable with mean 0 and variance 2. Therefore, we have:\n\nE[X(2)] = exp((0.5 - (0.1^2)/2) * 2) * E[exp(0.1 * W(2))]\n\nUsing the moment generating function of a normal random variable, we get:\n\nE[exp(0.1 * W(2))] = exp((0.1^2) * 2 / 2) = exp(0.01)\n\nSo, the expected value of X(2) is:\n\nE[X(2)] = exp((0.5 - (0.1^2)/2) * 2) * exp(0.01) ≈ 3.039\n\nVariance:\n\nVar[X(2)] = E[X(2)^2] - (E[X(2)])^2\n\nFirst, we calculate E[X(2)^2]:\n\nE[X(2)^2] = E[exp(2 * ((0.5 - (0.1^2)/2) * 2 + 0.1 * W(2)))]\n\nE[X(2)^2] = exp(2 * (0.5 - (0.1^2)/2) * 2) * E[exp(0.2 * W(2))]\n\nUsing the moment generating function of a normal random variable again, we get:\n\nE[exp(0.2 * W(2))] = exp((0.2^2) * 2 / 2) = exp(0.04)\n\nSo, the expected value of X(2)^2 is:\n\nE[X(2)^2] = exp(2 * (0.5 - (0.1^2)/2) * 2) * exp(0.04) ≈ 9.357\n\nNow, we can calculate the variance of X(2):\n\nVar[X(2)] = E[X(2)^2] - (E[X(2)])^2 ≈ 9.357 - (3.039)^2 ≈ 0.402\n\nSo, the expected value of X at time t=2 is approximately 3.039, and the variance is approximately 0.402."
