    "message_1": "A metal rod has a length of 5 m and is initially at a temperature of 100°C. If one end of the rod is exposed to a heat source that maintains a temperature of 500°C and the other end is kept at a constant temperature of 50°C, use Fourier analysis and the Fourier transform to determine the temperature distribution along the rod after 10 minutes. The thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.05 m²/min.",
    "message_2": "To determine the temperature distribution along the rod after 10 minutes, we can use the one-dimensional heat equation with boundary conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity (0.05 m²/min in this case).\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1. T(0,t) = 500°C (one end of the rod is exposed to a heat source)\n2. T(5,t) = 50°C (the other end is kept at a constant temperature)\n3. T(x,0) = 100°C (initial temperature of the rod)\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending on x and the other depending on t:\n\nT(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation and dividing by T(x,t), we get:\n\n(1/T) ∂T/∂t = (α/X) ∂²X/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call -λ:\n\n(1/T) ∂T/∂t = -λ\n(α/X) ∂²X/∂x² = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. dT/dt + λT = 0\n2. d²X/dx² + (λ/α)X = 0\n\nSolving the first equation for T(t), we get:\n\nT(t) = A * e^(-λt)\n\nSolving the second equation for X(x) depends on the value of λ/α. Since the boundary conditions are non-homogeneous, we can use a Fourier sine series to represent the solution:\n\nX(x) = B * sin(√(λ/α) * x)\n\nNow the general solution is:\n\nT(x,t) = ∑[A_n * e^(-λ_n * t) * sin(√(λ_n/α) * x)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we can use the initial condition T(x,0) = 100°C:\n\n100 = ∑[A_n * sin(√(λ_n/α) * x)]\n\nWe can use the Fourier sine series to find A_n:\n\nA_n = (2/L) * ∫[100 * sin(n * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nwhere L is the length of the rod (5 m).\n\nNow we need to satisfy the boundary conditions T(0,t) = 500°C and T(5,t) = 50°C. To do this, we can modify the general solution by adding a function F(x) that satisfies these conditions:\n\nT(x,t) = F(x) + ∑[A_n * e^(-λ_n * t) * sin(√(λ_n/α) * x)]\n\nWe can choose F(x) = 500 - 90x/5, which satisfies the boundary conditions.\n\nNow we have the temperature distribution along the rod after 10 minutes:\n\nT(x,t) = (500 - 90x/5) + ∑[A_n * e^(-λ_n * t) * sin(√(λ_n/α) * x)]\n\nTo find the exact temperature distribution, we would need to calculate the coefficients A_n and λ_n, which can be done numerically. However, this expression gives us a general idea of how the temperature will change along the rod over time."
