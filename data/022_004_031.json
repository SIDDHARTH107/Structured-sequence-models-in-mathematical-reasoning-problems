    "message_2": "To determine the type and order of the singularity of the complex function f(z) at z = 1, we first need to find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) around z = 1.\n\nf(z) = (z^2 - 2z + 1)/(z^3 - 5z^2 + 7z - 3)\n\nFirst, we can factor the numerator and denominator:\n\nf(z) = [(z - 1)(z - 1)]/[(z - 1)(z^2 - 4z + 3)]\n\nNow, we can cancel the common factor (z - 1):\n\nf(z) = (z - 1)/(z^2 - 4z + 3)\n\nNext, we want to find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) around z = 1. To do this, we can use partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = A/(z - 1) + B/(z - 3) + C/(z - 1)^2\n\nMultiplying both sides by (z - 1)^2(z - 3), we get:\n\n(z - 1) = A(z - 1)(z - 3) + B(z - 1)^2 + C(z - 3)\n\nNow, we can solve for A, B, and C by plugging in the appropriate values of z:\n\n1. z = 1:\n0 = -2A + 0 + 0\nA = 0\n\n2. z = 3:\n2 = 0 + 4B - 2C\nB - C = 1/2\n\nSince A = 0, we can simplify the equation:\n\n(z - 1) = B(z - 1)^2 + C(z - 3)\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion around z = 1:\n\nf(z) = B/(z - 1) + C/(z - 1)^2\n\nSince B - C = 1/2, we can choose B = 1/2 and C = 0:\n\nf(z) = (1/2)/(z - 1)\n\nNow, we can determine the type and order of the singularity at z = 1:\n\nThe function f(z) has a simple pole (a pole of order 1) at z = 1, since the Laurent series expansion has a term with a negative power of (z - 1) and the coefficient of the (z - 1)^(-1) term is nonzero."
