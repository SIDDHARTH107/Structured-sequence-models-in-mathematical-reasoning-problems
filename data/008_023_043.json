    "message_2": "First, let's solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination.\n\n1. Divide the first equation by 5 to get the first pivot:\n$x - 0.4y + 0.8z = 1.3$\n\n2. Eliminate x from the second and third equations:\nMultiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation:\n$5y - 2.6z = -0.6$\n\nMultiply the first equation by 1 and add it to the third equation:\n$1.6y + 6.8z = 11.2$\n\n3. Divide the second equation by 5 to get the second pivot:\n$y - 0.52z = -0.12$\n\n4. Eliminate y from the third equation:\nMultiply the second equation by 1.6 and subtract it from the third equation:\n$5.632z = 11.392$\n\n5. Divide the third equation by 5.632 to get the third pivot:\n$z = 2.024$\n\nNow, we can find x and y using back-substitution:\n\n4. Substitute z into the second equation to find y:\n$y - 0.52(2.024) = -0.12$\n$y = 0.932$\n\n5. Substitute y and z into the first equation to find x:\n$x - 0.4(0.932) + 0.8(2.024) = 1.3$\n$x = 0.568$\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately x = 0.568, y = 0.932, and z = 2.024.\n\nNow, let's find the error bounds for each variable. Since the data has an error margin of +/- 0.1, we can create an interval for each constant in the equations:\n\n$6.5 \\pm 0.1 \\Rightarrow [6.4, 6.6]$\n$2.2 \\pm 0.1 \\Rightarrow [2.1, 2.3]$\n$9.9 \\pm 0.1 \\Rightarrow [9.8, 10]$\n\nTo find the error bounds for x, y, and z, we can solve the system of equations using the endpoints of the intervals:\n\nLower bounds:\n$5x - 2y + 4z = 6.4$\n$2x + 3y - z = 2.1$\n$-x + 2y + 6z = 9.8$\n\nUpper bounds:\n$5x - 2y + 4z = 6.6$\n$2x + 3y - z = 2.3$\n$-x + 2y + 6z = 10$\n\nSolving these two systems of equations using Gaussian elimination, we get the following approximate solutions:\n\nLower bounds: x = 0.548, y = 0.912, z = 1.994\nUpper bounds: x = 0.588, y = 0.952, z = 2.054\n\nThus, the error bounds for each variable are approximately:\n\n$x \\in [0.548, 0.588]$\n$y \\in [0.912, 0.952]$\n$z \\in [1.994, 2.054]$"
