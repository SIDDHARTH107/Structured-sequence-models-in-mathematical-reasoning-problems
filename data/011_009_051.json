    "message_2": "To partition a set of n distinct elements, we use the Bell number, which is the number of ways to partition a set of n elements. The Bell number can be calculated using the Bell triangle or through the Dobinski's formula. \n\nFor a set of 5 distinct elements, the Bell number is B(5). Using the Bell triangle or looking it up in a table, we find that B(5) = 52.\n\nSo, there are 52 ways to partition a set of 5 distinct elements."
