    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the curve, we first need to compute the first, second, and third derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to t.\n\nFirst derivatives:\nx'(t) = 4t - 3\ny'(t) = 4\nz'(t) = 2t\n\nSecond derivatives:\nx''(t) = 4\ny''(t) = 0\nz''(t) = 2\n\nThird derivatives:\nx'''(t) = 0\ny'''(t) = 0\nz'''(t) = 0\n\nNow, let's find the curvature (k) of the curve. The formula for curvature is:\n\nk(t) = ||T'(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nwhere T(t) is the unit tangent vector, T'(t) is the derivative of the unit tangent vector, and r'(t) is the first derivative of the position vector.\n\nFirst, we find the magnitude of the first derivative:\n\n||r'(t)|| = sqrt((4t - 3)^2 + 4^2 + (2t)^2)\n\nAt t = 2:\n||r'(2)|| = sqrt((4*2 - 3)^2 + 4^2 + (2*2)^2) = sqrt(25) = 5\n\nNow, we find the unit tangent vector T(t):\n\nT(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)||\n\nAt t = 2:\nT(2) = (1, 4/5, 4/5)\n\nNow, we find the derivative of the unit tangent vector T'(t):\n\nT'(t) = (x''(t), y''(t), z''(t)) / ||r'(t)|| - (x'(t), y'(t), z'(t)) * (x''(t) * x'(t) + y''(t) * y'(t) + z''(t) * z'(t)) / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nAt t = 2:\nT'(2) = (4, 0, 2) / 5 - (1, 4/5, 4/5) * (4 * (4*2 - 3) + 0 * 4 + 2 * (2*2)) / 5^3\nT'(2) = (4/5, -4/25, 2/5)\n\nNow, we find the magnitude of T'(t):\n\n||T'(2)|| = sqrt((4/5)^2 + (-4/25)^2 + (2/5)^2) = 2/5\n\nFinally, we find the curvature k(t):\n\nk(2) = ||T'(2)|| / ||r'(2)||^3 = (2/5) / 5^3 = 2/625\n\nNow, let's find the torsion (τ) of the curve. The formula for torsion is:\n\nτ(t) = (T'(t) x T''(t)) • r'''(t) / ||T'(t)||^2\n\nwhere T''(t) is the second derivative of the unit tangent vector, and r'''(t) is the third derivative of the position vector.\n\nFirst, we find the cross product of T'(t) and T''(t):\n\nT'(2) x T''(2) = (4/5, -4/25, 2/5) x (0, 0, 0) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nNow, we find the dot product of the cross product and r'''(t):\n\n(0, 0, 0) • (0, 0, 0) = 0\n\nFinally, we find the torsion τ(t):\n\nτ(2) = 0 / (2/5)^2 = 0\n\nSo, the curvature of the curve at t = 2 is k(2) = 2/625, and the torsion of the curve at t = 2 is τ(2) = 0."
