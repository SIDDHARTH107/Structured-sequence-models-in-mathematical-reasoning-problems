Determine the modulus n, the totient of n, the public key exponent e, and the private key exponent d. Use these values to encrypt the message \"MATH\" into ciphertext.",
    "message_2": "To use RSA encryption, we first need to calculate the modulus n, the totient of n, the public key exponent e, and the private key exponent d.\n\n1. Calculate the modulus n:\nn = p * q\nn = 17 * 19\nn = 323\n\n2. Calculate the totient of n (Euler's totient function):\nϕ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\nϕ(n) = (17 - 1) * (19 - 1)\nϕ(n) = 16 * 18\nϕ(n) = 288\n\n3. Choose a public key exponent e:\ne must be a number that is relatively prime to ϕ(n) and 1 < e < ϕ(n). We can choose e = 3, as it is a common choice and satisfies the conditions.\n\n4. Calculate the private key exponent d:\nd ≡ e^(-1) mod ϕ(n)\nTo find the modular inverse, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. We need to find a value for d such that (e * d) % ϕ(n) = 1.\n\nAfter applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 195.\n\nNow that we have the public key (n, e) = (323, 3) and the private key (n, d) = (323, 195), we can encrypt the message \"MATH\".\n\nFirst, we need to convert the message into numerical form. We can use the ASCII values of the characters:\nM = 77, A = 65, T = 84, H = 72\n\nNext, we encrypt each numerical value using the public key (n, e):\nCiphertext = (Plaintext^e) % n\n\nCiphertext for M (77):\n(77^3) % 323 = 88\n\nCiphertext for A (65):\n(65^3) % 323 = 255\n\nCiphertext for T (84):\n(84^3) % 323 = 104\n\nCiphertext for H (72):\n(72^3) % 323 = 108\n\nThe encrypted message (ciphertext) is: 88 255 104 108."
