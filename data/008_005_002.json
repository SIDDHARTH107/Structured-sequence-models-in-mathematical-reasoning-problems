    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n| 2  3 -1 | 7\n| 4 -2  2 | 2\n| 6  1 -4 | 1\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the x terms below the first row.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2*R1\nR3 = R3 - 3*R1\n\n|  2   3  -1 |  7\n|  0  -8   4 | -12\n|  0  -8   1 | -20\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -8 to get a leading 1 in the second row.\n\nR2 = R2 / -8\n\n|  2   3  -1 |  7\n|  0   1 -0.5 |  1.5\n|  0  -8   1 | -20\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the y terms below the second row.\n\nR3 = R3 + 8*R2\n\n|  2   3  -1 |  7\n|  0   1 -0.5 |  1.5\n|  0   0  -3 | -8\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by -3 to get a leading 1 in the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 / -3\n\n|  2   3  -1 |  7\n|  0   1 -0.5 |  1.5\n|  0   0   1 |  8/3\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\nz = 8/3\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\ny - 0.5z = 1.5\ny - 0.5(8/3) = 1.5\ny - 4/3 = 1.5\ny = 1.5 + 4/3\ny = 9/2\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n2x + 3y - z = 7\n2x + 3(9/2) - 8/3 = 7\n2x + 27/2 - 8/3 = 7\n2x = 7 - 27/2 + 8/3\n2x = (21 - 27 + 8)/6\n2x = 2/6\nx = 1/3\n\nSo, the solution for the given system of linear equations is x = 1/3, y = 9/2, and z = 8/3."
