    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C30, D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nRecall that the order of a group G is the number of its elements, and a Sylow p-subgroup is a subgroup of G whose order is the highest power of a prime p that divides the order of G.\n\nThe order of G is 30 = 2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 15 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 10 and is congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 10. Finally, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 6 and is congruent to 1 mod 5, so n_5 can only be 1.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Since the orders of P_2, P_3, and P_5 are pairwise coprime, their intersection is trivial, and their product |P_2| * |P_3| * |P_5| = 2 * 3 * 5 = 30. Thus, G is the internal direct product of P_2, P_3, and P_5, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 10, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5, both of which are normal in G. Let P_3 be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P_2 and P_5 are normal, their product is also normal, and G is the semidirect product of P_2 * P_5 and P_3. Since |P_2 * P_5| = 10 and |P_3| = 3, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 10, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5, which is normal in G. Let P_2 be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups, and P_3 be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P_5 is normal, G is the semidirect product of P_5 and P_2 * P_3. Since |P_5| = 5 and |P_2 * P_3| = 6, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nThus, we have shown that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30."
