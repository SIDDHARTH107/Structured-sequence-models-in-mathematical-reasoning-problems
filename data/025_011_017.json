    "message_2": "To find the coordinates of the point $P+Q$, we will use the addition law for points on an elliptic curve. The equation of the curve is $y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 1$. Let $P = (x_1, y_1) = (0, 1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2) = (-1, 0)$.\n\nThe slope of the line passing through $P$ and $Q$ is given by:\n\n$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{0 - 1}{-1 - 0} = \\frac{-1}{-1} = 1$\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of the point $P+Q = R = (x_3, y_3)$ using the following formulas:\n\n$x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2 = 1^2 - 0 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2$\n\n$y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 = 1(0 - 2) - 1 = -2 - 1 = -3$\n\nSo, the coordinates of the point $P+Q = R = (x_3, y_3) = (2, -3)$."
