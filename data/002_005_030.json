    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has dimensions of 6 cm by 8 cm by 10 cm. What is the length of its diagonal?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem:\n\nd = √(l² + w² + h²)\n\nwhere d is the diagonal, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height of the rectangular prism.\n\nIn this case, l = 6 cm, w = 8 cm, and h = 10 cm.\n\nd = √(6² + 8² + 10²)\nd = √(36 + 64 + 100)\nd = √(200)\n\nThe length of the diagonal is √(200) cm, which is approximately 14.14 cm."
