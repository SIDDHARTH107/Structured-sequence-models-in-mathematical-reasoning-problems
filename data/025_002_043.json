    "message_2": "To determine the number of points in the (L1+L2)-linear system on X, we can use the intersection theory. Since L1 and L2 are very ample line bundles, they correspond to divisors D1 and D2 on X, respectively. The intersection of D1 and D2 is transversal, which means that the intersection number is well-defined.\n\nThe (L1+L2)-linear system corresponds to the complete linear system |D1+D2|, which is the set of effective divisors linearly equivalent to D1+D2. To find the number of points in this linear system, we need to compute the intersection number (D1+D2)·(D1+D2).\n\nBy the properties of intersection numbers, we have:\n\n(D1+D2)·(D1+D2) = D1·D1 + 2D1·D2 + D2·D2.\n\nNow, we need to compute these intersection numbers. Since L1 and L2 are very ample, the intersection numbers D1·D1, D1·D2, and D2·D2 are all non-negative integers.\n\nLet n = dim(X), the dimension of the projective variety X. By the degree-genus formula, we have:\n\nD1·D1 = deg(L1)^n / n!,\nD1·D2 = deg(L1)^{n-1} * deg(L2) / (n-1)!,\nD2·D2 = deg(L2)^n / n!.\n\nTherefore, the intersection number (D1+D2)·(D1+D2) is given by:\n\n(D1+D2)·(D1+D2) = (deg(L1)^n + 2deg(L1)^{n-1} * deg(L2) + deg(L2)^n) / n!.\n\nThis intersection number represents the number of points in the (L1+L2)-linear system on X. Note that this number depends on the degrees of L1 and L2, as well as the dimension of the projective variety X."
