    "message_1": "Consider the following reaction: $A \\longrightarrow B + C$. The rate of disappearance of $A$ is proportional to its concentration at any time. Initially, the concentration of $A$ is 20 mol/L and after 10 minutes, it is found to be 5 mol/L. Find the rate constant and the time taken for the concentration of $A$ to reduce to half of its initial value.",
    "message_2": "Since the rate of disappearance of A is proportional to its concentration, we can write the rate law as:\n\nRate = -d[A]/dt = k[A]\n\nwhere [A] is the concentration of A, t is time, k is the rate constant, and d[A]/dt is the rate of change of the concentration of A with respect to time.\n\nThis is a first-order reaction, so we can integrate the rate law to find the relationship between the concentration of A and time:\n\n∫(d[A]/[A]) = ∫(k dt)\n\nTaking the integral, we get:\n\nln[A] = -kt + C\n\nwhere C is the integration constant. To find C, we can use the initial condition:\n\nln(20) = -k(0) + C\n\nC = ln(20)\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln[A] = -kt + ln(20)\n\nWe are given that after 10 minutes, the concentration of A is 5 mol/L:\n\nln(5) = -k(10) + ln(20)\n\nNow we can solve for k:\n\n-k(10) = ln(5) - ln(20)\nk = (ln(20) - ln(5))/10\nk = ln(4)/10\nk ≈ 0.1386 min^(-1)\n\nNow we want to find the time it takes for the concentration of A to reduce to half of its initial value, which is 10 mol/L:\n\nln(10) = -k(t) + ln(20)\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt = (ln(20) - ln(10))/k\nt = ln(2)/k\nt ≈ 5 minutes\n\nSo the rate constant, k, is approximately 0.1386 min^(-1), and it takes about 5 minutes for the concentration of A to reduce to half of its initial value."
