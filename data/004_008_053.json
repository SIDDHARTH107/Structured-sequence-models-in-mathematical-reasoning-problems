    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at a specific point, we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) and then evaluate it at the given x-value.\n\nThe function is f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x + 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x + 1)/dx\nf'(x) = 3(2x^2) - 2(5x) + 3\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 10x + 3\n\nNow, let's evaluate f'(x) at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2)^2 - 10(2) + 3\nf'(2) = 6(4) - 20 + 3\nf'(2) = 24 - 20 + 3\nf'(2) = 7\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at x = 2 is 7."
