    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext \"HELLO WORLD\" using the Playfair Cipher with the key \"MATHS\" and the letter \"X\" as the filler, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 matrix using the key \"MATHS\" and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding \"J\" since \"I\" and \"J\" are considered the same in the Playfair cipher).\n\n   M A T H S\n   B C D E F\n   G I K L N\n   O P Q R U\n   V W X Y Z\n\n2. Split the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert the filler letter \"X\" between them. If the plaintext has an odd number of letters, add the filler letter \"X\" at the end.\n\n   HE LX LO WO RX LD\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the Playfair encryption rules:\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrap around if necessary).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrap around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle.\n\n   HE -> ZS\n   LX -> QN\n   LO -> FN\n   WO -> UV\n   RX -> YK\n   LD -> MC\n\n4. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the ciphertext:\n\n   ZSQNFNUVYKMC\n\nSo, the ciphertext for the given plaintext \"HELLO WORLD\" using the key \"MATHS\" and the letter \"X\" as the filler is \"ZSQNFNUVYKMC\"."
