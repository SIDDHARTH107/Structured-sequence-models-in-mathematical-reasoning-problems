    "message_2": "To find the probability that the mean life of the sample is greater than 410 hours, we will use the z-score formula for sample means:\n\nz = (X̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nwhere X̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nμ = 400 hours (the claimed mean life of the light bulbs)\nσ = 20 hours (the standard deviation of the light bulb life)\nn = 36 (the sample size)\nX̄ = 410 hours (the sample mean we want to find the probability for)\n\nPlugging these values into the z-score formula, we get:\n\nz = (410 - 400) / (20 / √36) = 10 / (20 / 6) = 10 / (20/6) = 10 / (10/3) = 10 * (3/10) = 3\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is greater than 3. We can use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find the probability for a z-score of 3. \n\nLooking up a z-score of 3 in the z-table, we find that the probability is 0.9987. However, this is the probability of the z-score being less than 3. Since we want the probability of the z-score being greater than 3, we need to subtract this value from 1:\n\nP(z > 3) = 1 - P(z < 3) = 1 - 0.9987 = 0.0013\n\nSo, the probability that the mean life of the sample is greater than 410 hours is 0.0013, or 0.13%."
