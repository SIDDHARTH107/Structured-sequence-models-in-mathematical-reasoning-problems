    "message_2": "First, we note that the order of G is 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (let's call them P_5) divides 12 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. This means that there is either 1 or 6 Sylow 5-subgroups. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (let's call them P_3) divides 20 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3, which means there is either 1 or 10 Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nIf there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, then it is normal in G. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it is also normal in G. In this case, G would have a normal subgroup of order 3 and a normal subgroup of order 5. Since their orders are coprime, their intersection would be trivial, and by the product formula, G would be isomorphic to the direct product of these two normal subgroups, which is a contradiction since G is non-abelian.\n\nThus, there must be 6 Sylow 5-subgroups and 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P_5 be one of the Sylow 5-subgroups and P_3 be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Then |P_5| = 5 and |P_3| = 3. Since P_5 and P_3 have coprime orders, by the product formula, the subgroup generated by P_5 and P_3 has order |P_5| * |P_3| = 15.\n\nNow, consider the action of G on the set of its Sylow 5-subgroups by conjugation. This action gives a homomorphism φ: G → S_6, where S_6 is the symmetric group on 6 elements. The kernel of φ, K, is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in all Sylow 5-subgroups. Since G is non-abelian, K cannot be G itself, so K must be a proper subgroup of G. Moreover, since G has no normal subgroups of order 15 (as shown above), K cannot be the subgroup generated by P_5 and P_3. Thus, K must be a subgroup of order 2^2 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/K. This group has order 60/12 = 5, so it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C_5. This means that G has a normal subgroup of order 12, which we will denote by N.\n\nNow, we have a normal subgroup N of order 12 and a subgroup P_5 of order 5. Since their orders are coprime, their intersection is trivial, and by the product formula, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of N and P_5. The isomorphism type of G is determined by the action of P_5 on N by conjugation.\n\nTo determine the possible actions of P_5 on N, we can use the fact that the automorphism group of N, Aut(N), has order 12 (since N is isomorphic to A_4, the alternating group on 4 elements). The possible homomorphisms from P_5 to Aut(N) correspond to the possible actions of P_5 on N. Since P_5 is cyclic of order 5, there are at most 5 possible non-isomorphic actions, which correspond to the 5 possible subgroups of Aut(N) of order 5.\n\nTherefore, there are at most 5 non-isomorphic groups G that can be formed as the semidirect product of N and P_5. However, since there are 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, and G is not isomorphic to A_5 × C_2, G must be one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nTo compute the isomorphism between G and one of these 32 non-abelian groups, we can use the following procedure:\n\n1. Determine the normal subgroup N of order 12 and a subgroup P_5 of order 5 in G.\n2. Determine the action of P_5 on N by conjugation.\n3. Identify the corresponding homomorphism from P_5 to Aut(N).\n4. Use this homomorphism to construct the semidirect product of N and P_5.\n5. Verify that the resulting group is one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, and we can compute the isomorphism between G and one of these groups using the procedure outlined above."
