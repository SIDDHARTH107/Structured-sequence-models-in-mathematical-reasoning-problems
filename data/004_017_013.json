    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) between x = 1 and x = 4, we can use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] sqrt(1 + ((3/2)x^(1/2))^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] sqrt(1 + (9/4)x) dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral. This integral does not have an elementary antiderivative, so we can't find an explicit expression for the arc length. However, we can approximate the integral using numerical methods, such as Simpson's rule or a numerical integration calculator.\n\nUsing a numerical integration calculator, we find:\n\nL ≈ 6.260990336\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) between x = 1 and x = 4 is approximately 6.26 units."
