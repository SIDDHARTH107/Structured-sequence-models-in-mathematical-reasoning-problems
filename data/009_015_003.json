    "message_1": "Sure! Here's an example question for a math student to solve:\n\nA radioactive isotope has a half-life of 30 years. If the initial amount of the isotope is 200 grams, how much will be left after 120 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 200 grams, the half-life is 30 years, and the time elapsed is 120 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal amount = 200 * (1/2)^(120 / 30)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of half-lives that have passed:\n\n120 years / 30 years/half-life = 4 half-lives\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the formula:\n\nFinal amount = 200 * (1/2)^4\n\nFinal amount = 200 * (1/16)\n\nFinal amount = 12.5 grams\n\nSo, after 120 years, there will be 12.5 grams of the radioactive isotope left."
