    "message_1": "A message needs to be digitally signed using the RSA algorithm. The public key is (n = 77, e = 7) and the private key is (n = 77, d = 43). The message to be signed has a numerical representation of 13. What is the digital signature value for this message using the private key method?",
    "message_2": "To sign the message using the RSA algorithm and the private key, we need to compute the digital signature value (S) using the following formula:\n\nS = M^d mod n\n\nwhere M is the numerical representation of the message, d is the private exponent, and n is the modulus.\n\nIn this case, M = 13, d = 43, and n = 77. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nS = 13^43 mod 77\n\nTo compute this, we can use the exponentiation by squaring method to reduce the number of multiplications:\n\n1. 13^1 mod 77 = 13\n2. 13^2 mod 77 = 169 mod 77 = 15\n3. 13^4 mod 77 = 15^2 mod 77 = 225 mod 77 = 71\n4. 13^8 mod 77 = 71^2 mod 77 = 5041 mod 77 = 1\n5. 13^16 mod 77 = 1^2 mod 77 = 1\n6. 13^32 mod 77 = 1^2 mod 77 = 1\n\nNow, we can compute 13^43 mod 77 by multiplying the appropriate powers together:\n\n13^43 = 13^(32+8+2+1) = 13^32 * 13^8 * 13^2 * 13^1\n\nS = (1 * 1 * 15 * 13) mod 77 = 195 mod 77 = 64\n\nSo, the digital signature value for the message using the private key method is 64."
