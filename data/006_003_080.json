    "message_1": "If you draw one card at random from a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing a heart card?",
    "message_2": "In a standard deck of 52 cards, there are 13 heart cards (Ace through King of hearts). To find the probability of drawing a heart card, you can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 13 (drawing a heart card), and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (total cards in the deck).\n\nProbability = 13/52 = 1/4 = 0.25\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a heart card from a standard deck of 52 cards is 0.25 or 25%."
