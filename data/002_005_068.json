    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 8 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of this rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the length (l), width (w), and height (h):\n\nd^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2\n\nIn this case, l = 10 cm, w = 6 cm, and h = 8 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nd^2 = (10)^2 + (6)^2 + (8)^2\nd^2 = 100 + 36 + 64\nd^2 = 200\n\nNow, to find the length of the diagonal (d), we take the square root of both sides:\n\nd = √200\nd ≈ 14.14 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 14.14 cm."
