    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal curve that can be constructed by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half, and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The order of the curve refers to the number of times the paper is folded.\n\nThe total length of the Heighway dragon curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (side length of unit square) × (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the side length of each unit square is 2 cm, and the order of the curve is 6. So, we can calculate the total length as follows:\n\nLength = 2 × (2^6) = 2 × 64 = 128 cm\n\nTherefore, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve of order 6 with a side length of 2 cm for each unit square is 128 cm."
