    "message_1": "Here is a nonlinear programming problem for a math student to solve: \n\nA company produces two types of products, A and B. Each A product requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor time, while each B product requires 2 hours of machine time and 4 hours of labor time. The company has a total of 100 machine hours and 80 labor hours available per day. If the profit of each A product is $5 and each B product is $10, how many of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of A products and y be the number of B products produced.\n\nThe constraints for the problem are:\n\n1. Machine time: 3x + 2y ≤ 100\n2. Labor time: 2x + 4y ≤ 80\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 10y\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint inequalities to find the feasible region:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 100\n   y ≤ (100 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. 2x + 4y ≤ 80\n   y ≤ (80 - 2x) / 4\n   y ≤ (20 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 20), (20, 10), and (40, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 10(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 20) = 5(0) + 10(20) = $200\n3. P(20, 10) = 5(20) + 10(10) = $200\n4. P(40, 0) = 5(40) + 10(0) = $200\n\nThe maximum profit is $200, which can be achieved by producing any of the following combinations: 0 A products and 20 B products, 20 A products and 10 B products, or 40 A products and 0 B products."
