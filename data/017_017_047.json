If it is isomorphic to any of the groups mentioned above, find an explicit isomorphism between G and the corresponding group.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of the mentioned groups, we will use the Sylow theorems. The order of G is 30, which can be factored as 2 * 3 * 5. Therefore, we will consider the Sylow 2-subgroups, Sylow 3-subgroups, and Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, denoted by n_2, must divide 15 (the index of 2 in 30) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, or 15. \n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, denoted by n_3, must divide 10 (the index of 3 in 30) and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 or 10.\n\n3. Sylow 5-subgroups: The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, denoted by n_5, must divide 6 (the index of 5 in 30) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possible value for n_5 is 1.\n\nNow, we know that if there is a unique Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p, then that subgroup is normal in G. Since n_5 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, say P_5, which is normal in G. The order of P_5 is 5, so P_5 is isomorphic to C5, the cyclic group of order 5.\n\nIf n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, say P_3, which is normal in G. In this case, the order of P_3 is 3, so P_3 is isomorphic to C3, the cyclic group of order 3. Since P_3 and P_5 are both normal in G and their intersection is trivial (only the identity element), G would be isomorphic to the direct product of P_3 and P_5, which is C3 x C5, and this is isomorphic to C30, the cyclic group of order 30. The isomorphism can be given by the mapping φ: G → C30, where φ(g) = a^(k_1) * b^(k_2), with g in G, a and b being the generators of P_3 and P_5 respectively, and k_1 and k_2 being the corresponding powers.\n\nIf n_3 = 10, then G cannot be isomorphic to C30, as C30 has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, G must have a non-normal Sylow 3-subgroup. Since G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, G cannot be isomorphic to the dihedral group D15, as D15 has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nIn summary, G can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30 or the non-abelian group of order 30. If G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, then it is isomorphic to C30, and the isomorphism can be given by the mapping φ: G → C30, where φ(g) = a^(k_1) * b^(k_2), with g in G, a and b being the generators of the unique Sylow 3-subgroup and the unique Sylow 5-subgroup respectively, and k_1 and k_2 being the corresponding powers. If G has 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, then it is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 30."
