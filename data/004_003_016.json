    "message_1": "A rectangular metal sheet of length 20 cm and width 10 cm has two smaller squares of equal size cut out of each corner. The sheet is then folded into an open-top box. Find the dimensions of the box when its volume is maximum.",
    "message_2": "Let the side length of the smaller squares cut out from each corner be x cm. After cutting out the squares and folding the sheet, the dimensions of the open-top box will be:\n\nLength: 20 - 2x\nWidth: 10 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume V of the box can be calculated as:\n\nV = (20 - 2x)(10 - 2x)x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the volume function with respect to x and setting it to 0. Then, we will check the second derivative to confirm that it is a maximum.\n\nFirst, let's expand the volume function:\n\nV = 4x^3 - 60x^2 + 200x\n\nNow, let's find the first derivative dV/dx:\n\ndV/dx = 12x^2 - 120x + 200\n\nSetting dV/dx to 0 to find the critical points:\n\n12x^2 - 120x + 200 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 4:\n\n3x^2 - 30x + 50 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nFor our equation, a = 3, b = -30, and c = 50:\n\nx = (30 ± √((-30)^2 - 4(3)(50))) / (2(3))\nx = (30 ± √(900 - 600)) / 6\nx = (30 ± √300) / 6\n\nThere are two possible values for x:\n\nx1 = (30 + √300) / 6 ≈ 5.82\nx2 = (30 - √300) / 6 ≈ 2.85\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative d^2V/dx^2 to check for concavity:\n\nd^2V/dx^2 = 24x - 120\n\nWe will check the concavity for both x1 and x2:\n\nd^2V/dx^2 (x1) ≈ 24(5.82) - 120 < 0, so it's a maximum.\nd^2V/dx^2 (x2) ≈ 24(2.85) - 120 > 0, so it's a minimum.\n\nSince we are looking for the maximum volume, we will use x1 ≈ 5.82 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the dimensions of the box:\n\nLength: 20 - 2x1 ≈ 20 - 2(5.82) ≈ 8.36 cm\nWidth: 10 - 2x1 ≈ 10 - 2(5.82) ≈ -1.64 cm\nHeight: x1 ≈ 5.82 cm\n\nHowever, the width cannot be negative, which means that x1 is not a valid solution. Therefore, we will use x2 ≈ 2.85 cm:\n\nLength: 20 - 2x2 ≈ 20 - 2(2.85) ≈ 14.3 cm\nWidth: 10 - 2x2 ≈ 10 - 2(2.85) ≈ 4.3 cm\nHeight: x2 ≈ 2.85 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box when its volume is maximum are approximately 14.3 cm x 4.3 cm x 2.85 cm."
