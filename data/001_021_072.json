    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0, we can try to find its roots by factoring or using numerical methods. In this case, we will attempt to factor the polynomial.\n\nFirst, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (6) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (2).\n\nThe factors of 6 are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6, and the factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±1/2, and ±3/2.\n\nBy testing these values, we find that x = 1 is a root of the polynomial:\n\n2(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 - 11(1) + 6 = 2 - 3 - 11 + 6 = 0\n\nNow that we know x = 1 is a root, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(2x^3 - 3x^2 - 11x + 6) / (x - 1)\n\nUsing synthetic division or long division, we find the quotient to be:\n\n2x^2 + x - 6\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the quadratic factor. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 1, and c = -6:\n\nx = (-(1) ± √((1)^2 - 4(2)(-6))) / 2(2)\nx = (-1 ± √(1 + 48)) / 4\nx = (-1 ± √49) / 4\nx = (-1 ± 7) / 4\n\nThis gives us two more roots:\n\nx = (-1 + 7) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 3/2\nx = (-1 - 7) / 4 = -8 / 4 = -2\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial equation 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0 are x = 1, x = 3/2, and x = -2."
