    "message_1": "A cable company is laying a fiber optic cable from point A to point B, which is 1000 meters away. The cable company has two choices: run the cable underground for $x$ meters at a cost of $\\$400$ per meter and then run the cable overhead for the remaining distance at a cost of $\\$200$ per meter or run the cable overhead for the entire distance at a cost of $\\$300$ per meter. \nWhat is the minimum cost for the cable company?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze both choices:\n\nChoice 1: Run the cable underground for $x$ meters and then overhead for the remaining distance.\nCost = $400x + 200(1000 - x)$\n\nChoice 2: Run the cable overhead for the entire distance.\nCost = $300(1000)$ = $300,000$\n\nTo find the minimum cost, we need to find the value of $x$ that minimizes the cost of Choice 1 and compare it to the cost of Choice 2.\n\nCost of Choice 1 = $400x + 200(1000 - x)$ = $400x + 200,000 - 200x$ = $200x + 200,000$\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum value of this function. Since the function is linear, the minimum value will occur at one of the endpoints. In this case, the endpoints are when $x = 0$ and $x = 1000$.\n\nWhen $x = 0$, the cost of Choice 1 is $200(0) + 200,000 = 200,000$.\nWhen $x = 1000$, the cost of Choice 1 is $200(1000) + 200,000 = 400,000$.\n\nThe minimum cost of Choice 1 is $200,000$ when $x = 0$. Comparing this to the cost of Choice 2, which is $300,000$, we can see that the minimum cost for the cable company is $200,000$."
