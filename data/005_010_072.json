    "message_1": "Suppose that a company produces light bulbs, and the probability that a light bulb will fail after 1000 hours of use is 0.05. If a customer purchased 12 light bulbs, what is the probability that exactly 2 of these light bulbs will fail within 1000 hours of use, according to the Bayesian statistic method?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that exactly 2 out of 12 light bulbs will fail within 1000 hours of use, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is not specific to Bayesian statistics but is a general probability calculation. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, light bulbs failing) out of n trials (in this case, 12 light bulbs)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a light bulb failing, which is 0.05)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 12 light bulbs)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 2 light bulbs failing)\n\nPlugging in the values for this problem:\n\nP(X=2) = C(12, 2) * 0.05^2 * (1-0.05)^(12-2)\n\nC(12, 2) can be calculated as:\n\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2! * (12-2)!)\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2! * 10!)\nC(12, 2) = 66\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X=2) = 66 * 0.05^2 * (1-0.05)^(12-2)\nP(X=2) = 66 * 0.0025 * 0.95^10\nP(X=2) â‰ˆ 0.2834\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 2 out of 12 light bulbs will fail within 1000 hours of use is approximately 0.2834 or 28.34%."
