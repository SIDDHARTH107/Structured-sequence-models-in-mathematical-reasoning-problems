    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution in the plate after 100 seconds, we can use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, which is given by:\n\nT(x, t) = T_initial + (T_boundary - T_initial) * erf(x / (2 * sqrt(α * t)))\n\nwhere T(x, t) is the temperature at position x and time t, T_initial is the initial temperature of the plate, T_boundary is the temperature of the surrounding environment, α is the thermal diffusivity, and erf is the error function.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n\nT_initial = 200°C\nT_boundary = 25°C\nα = 0.1 cm²/s\nt = 100 s\n\nWe want to find the temperature distribution in the plate, so we need to find T(x, 100) for x in the range [0, 2] cm. We can do this by plugging in the values into the equation:\n\nT(x, 100) = 200 + (25 - 200) * erf(x / (2 * sqrt(0.1 * 100)))\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature at different positions x in the plate:\n\nFor x = 0 cm:\nT(0, 100) = 200 + (25 - 200) * erf(0) = 200°C\n\nFor x = 1 cm:\nT(1, 100) = 200 + (25 - 200) * erf(1 / (2 * sqrt(10))) ≈ 200 - 175 * erf(0.1581) ≈ 200 - 175 * 0.1765 ≈ 169.1°C\n\nFor x = 2 cm:\nT(2, 100) = 200 + (25 - 200) * erf(2 / (2 * sqrt(10))) ≈ 200 - 175 * erf(0.3162) ≈ 200 - 175 * 0.2967 ≈ 148.1°C\n\nSo, the temperature distribution in the plate after 100 seconds is approximately:\n\nT(0, 100) = 200°C\nT(1, 100) = 169.1°C\nT(2, 100) = 148.1°C"
