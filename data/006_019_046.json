    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a female candidate winning the presidential election, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the successful outcomes are the female candidates winning, and there are 3 female candidates. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of candidates, which is 3 female candidates + 6 male candidates = 9 candidates.\n\nSo, the probability of a female candidate winning the presidential election is:\n\nProbability = 3 (successful outcomes) / 9 (total possible outcomes) = 1/3 or approximately 0.3333, which is 33.33% when expressed as a percentage."
