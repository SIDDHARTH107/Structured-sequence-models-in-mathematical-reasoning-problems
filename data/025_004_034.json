    "message_2": "First, let's find the degree of C. The degree of a curve is the number of intersection points with a generic hyperplane. In the projective plane, a generic hyperplane is given by the equation $ax+by+cz=0$. We want to find the number of intersection points between C and this hyperplane.\n\nSubstitute the parameterization of C into the hyperplane equation:\n\n$$a(t^2-1)+b(t^2+1)-2ct=0$$\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n$$(a+b)t^2-2ct+(a-b)=0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in t. A generic hyperplane will intersect C at two distinct points if the discriminant of this quadratic equation is positive. The discriminant is given by:\n\n$$\\Delta = (-2c)^2 - 4(a+b)(a-b) = 4c^2 - 4(a^2 - b^2)$$\n\nFor a generic hyperplane, we can assume that $\\Delta > 0$. Therefore, the degree of C is 2.\n\nNow, let's find the genus of X. The genus of a plane curve defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree d is given by the formula:\n\n$$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$$\n\nIn our case, the curve X is defined by the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=0$, which is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2. So, we can find the genus of X by plugging d=2 into the formula:\n\n$$g = \\frac{(2-1)(2-2)}{2} = \\frac{1 \\cdot 0}{2} = 0$$\n\nThus, the degree of C is 2 and the genus of X is 0."
