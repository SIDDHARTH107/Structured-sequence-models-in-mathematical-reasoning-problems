    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 12, and let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G.\n\n1. Since the order of G is 12 = 2^2 * 3, by the Sylow theorems, we have the following possibilities for n_2 and n_3:\n\n   - n_2 ∈ {1, 3} and n_3 ∈ {1, 4}\n\n2. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, say H, of G. Since H is the unique Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal in G. Similarly, if n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, say K, of G, and K is normal in G.\n\n3. If both n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup H of order 4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup K of order 3. Since H and K are both normal in G, their product HK is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of H and K are relatively prime, we have |HK| = |H||K| = 12, so HK = G. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, which is the cyclic group C12.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then G has three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup K of order 3. Since K is normal in G, for any Sylow 2-subgroup H, the product HK is a subgroup of G. As before, we have |HK| = |H||K| = 12, so HK = G. Moreover, since G has no element of order 6, it follows that H and K must intersect trivially, i.e., H ∩ K = {e}. Thus, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of H and K, which is the dihedral group D6.\n\n5. The remaining case is when n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4. However, this case cannot occur, because if there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup H of order 4, then H is normal in G, and G would have a normal Sylow 3-subgroup as well, which would lead to G being isomorphic to C12, as shown in step 3.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 12 with no element of order 6, then G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12 or the dihedral group D6."
