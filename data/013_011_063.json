    "message_1": "Consider two firms selling identical products. Firm 1 has a marginal cost of production of $5 and Firm 2 has a marginal cost of production of $8. They simultaneously decide on the price they will sell their product for. What is the Nash Equilibrium of this Bertrand Competition?",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition with identical products, the Nash equilibrium occurs when both firms choose a price equal to their marginal cost of production, and neither firm has an incentive to change its price given the other firm's price.\n\nIn this case, Firm 1 has a marginal cost of $5 and Firm 2 has a marginal cost of $8. If Firm 1 sets its price at $5, it will capture the entire market, as its price is lower than Firm 2's marginal cost. Firm 2 cannot lower its price below $8, as it would incur a loss for each unit sold.\n\nTherefore, the Nash equilibrium in this Bertrand competition is for Firm 1 to set its price at $5 and capture the entire market, while Firm 2 sets its price at $8 and sells no units. Neither firm has an incentive to change its price given the other firm's price."
