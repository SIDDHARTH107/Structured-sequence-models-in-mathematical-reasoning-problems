    "message_1": "Suppose you have six apples and you want to divide them among your three friends. However, you want to make sure that each friend receives a different number of apples. Using the Chinese remainder theorem, determine the total number of ways you can do this.",
    "message_2": "The Chinese remainder theorem may not be the most suitable method for solving this problem. Instead, we can use combinatorics to find the total number of ways to divide the apples among the three friends.\n\nLet's denote the number of apples each friend receives as A, B, and C, where A ≠ B ≠ C. Since we have 6 apples in total, we can list the possible combinations as follows:\n\n1. A = 0, B = 1, C = 5\n2. A = 0, B = 2, C = 4\n3. A = 0, B = 3, C = 3 (This combination is not valid since B = C)\n4. A = 1, B = 2, C = 3\n\nThere are 3 valid combinations in which each friend receives a different number of apples. Therefore, there are 3 ways to divide the 6 apples among the three friends such that each friend receives a different number of apples."
