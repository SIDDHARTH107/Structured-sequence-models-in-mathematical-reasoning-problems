    "message_2": "To find the number of rational curves of degree $d=3$ on the mirror quintic Calabi-Yau, we can use the Gromov-Witten invariants. The Gromov-Witten invariants count the number of rational curves of a given degree on a Calabi-Yau manifold.\n\nFor the quintic Calabi-Yau in $\\mathbb{P}^4$, the Gromov-Witten invariants are given by the generating function:\n\n$F(q) = \\sum_{d=1}^{\\infty} n_d q^d$\n\nwhere $n_d$ is the number of rational curves of degree $d$ on the Calabi-Yau manifold, and $q$ is a formal variable.\n\nThe mirror symmetry conjecture states that the generating function $F(q)$ for the quintic Calabi-Yau in $\\mathbb{P}^4$ is related to the generating function $F^{\\text{mirror}}(q)$ for the mirror quintic Calabi-Yau by the following equation:\n\n$F^{\\text{mirror}}(q) = \\frac{1}{(1-q)^5} F(q)$\n\nFor the quintic Calabi-Yau in $\\mathbb{P}^4$, the Gromov-Witten invariants are known, and we have:\n\n$F(q) = 2875q + 609250q^2 + 317206375q^3 + \\cdots$\n\nNow, we can compute the generating function $F^{\\text{mirror}}(q)$ for the mirror quintic Calabi-Yau:\n\n$F^{\\text{mirror}}(q) = \\frac{1}{(1-q)^5} (2875q + 609250q^2 + 317206375q^3 + \\cdots)$\n\nExpanding the series, we get:\n\n$F^{\\text{mirror}}(q) = 2875q + 143750q^2 + 317206375q^3 + \\cdots$\n\nThus, the number of rational curves of degree $d=3$ on the mirror quintic Calabi-Yau is given by the coefficient of $q^3$ in the generating function $F^{\\text{mirror}}(q)$, which is $317206375$."
