    "message_2": "To show that there exists an integer k such that rk(E) + k is divisible by n, we can use the concept of the Euler class of a vector bundle. The Euler class is an element of the cohomology group H^n(X; Z), where X is the base space and n is the dimension of the manifold.\n\nFor a compact, connected, oriented manifold X of dimension n, the Euler characteristic χ(X) is an integer that is invariant under homotopy equivalence. By the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, the Euler characteristic can be computed as the integral of the Euler class over the manifold:\n\nχ(X) = ∫_X e(E)\n\nSince the Euler class is an element of H^n(X; Z), its integral over X is an integer. Thus, χ(X) is an integer.\n\nNow, consider the Whitney sum formula, which relates the Euler class of a direct sum of vector bundles to the Euler classes of the individual bundles:\n\ne(E ⊕ F) = e(E) ∪ e(F)\n\nIn our case, let F be a trivial bundle of rank k, i.e., F = X × R^k. Then E ⊕ F is a vector bundle of rank r + k. Since the Euler class of a trivial bundle is 1, we have:\n\ne(E ⊕ F) = e(E) ∪ 1 = e(E)\n\nNow, let's compute the Euler characteristic of the manifold X with respect to the vector bundle E ⊕ F:\n\nχ(X) = ∫_X e(E ⊕ F) = ∫_X e(E)\n\nSince χ(X) is an integer and e(E) is an element of H^n(X; Z), it follows that there exists an integer k such that rk(E) + k is divisible by n.\n\nNow, let's find the value of k when r = 3 and n = 4. We want to find k such that 3k is divisible by 4. The smallest positive integer k that satisfies this condition is k = 4. Thus, when r = 3 and n = 4, the value of k is 4."
