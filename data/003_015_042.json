    "message_1": "A math student needs to find the period and amplitude of the function y = 3sin(2x + π/3).\nWhat is the period and amplitude of this function?",
    "message_2": "The given function is y = 3sin(2x + π/3).\n\nThe amplitude of the function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function, which in this case is 3. So, the amplitude is 3.\n\nThe period of the function is determined by the coefficient of x inside the sine function. The general formula for the period of a sine function is (2π)/|B|, where B is the coefficient of x. In this case, B = 2. So, the period is (2π)/2 = π.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the function is 3 and the period is π."
