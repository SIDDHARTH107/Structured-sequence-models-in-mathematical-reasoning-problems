    "message_1": "Suppose a thief steals a bag and wants to fill it with maximum value items he can get from a store. The thief has a bag that can hold up to 10 kilograms of items. The store has 4 items for sale:\n\nItem 1: 4 kilograms, worth $10\nItem 2: 3 kilograms, worth $8\nItem 3: 2 kilograms, worth $5\nItem 4: 1 kilogram, worth $3\n\nWhat are the items that the thief should put in his bag to maximize the value, assuming he can't take a fraction of an item?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the value, we need to calculate the value per kilogram for each item:\n\nItem 1: $10 / 4 kg = $2.50 per kg\nItem 2: $8 / 3 kg = $2.67 per kg\nItem 3: $5 / 2 kg = $2.50 per kg\nItem 4: $3 / 1 kg = $3.00 per kg\n\nNow, we should prioritize the items with the highest value per kilogram:\n\n1. Item 4: 1 kg, $3.00 per kg\n2. Item 2: 3 kg, $2.67 per kg\n3. Item 1 and Item 3: 4 kg and 2 kg, both $2.50 per kg\n\nThe thief should start by taking as many of the highest value per kilogram items as possible, then move to the next highest, and so on.\n\n1. Take 1 of Item 4 (1 kg, $3) - 1 kg used, 9 kg remaining\n2. Take 3 of Item 2 (9 kg, $24) - 9 kg used, 0 kg remaining\n\nThe thief should take 1 of Item 4 and 3 of Item 2, which will fill the 10 kg bag and have a total value of $27."
