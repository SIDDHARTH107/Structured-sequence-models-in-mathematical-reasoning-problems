    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to find the values of x when y = 0. So, we set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = |x - 3| - 2\n\nNow, we need to consider two cases: when (x - 3) is positive or zero, and when (x - 3) is negative.\n\nCase 1: (x - 3) â‰¥ 0\n0 = |x - 3| - 2\n2 = x - 3\nx = 5\n\nCase 2: (x - 3) < 0\n0 = |- (x - 3)| - 2\n2 = - (x - 3)\nx - 3 = -2\nx = 1\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = 1 and x = 5."
