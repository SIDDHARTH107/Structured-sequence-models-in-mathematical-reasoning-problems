    "message_1": "Suppose you have 5 different colored marbles and you want to form a chain from these marbles, where the first position should be occupied by an odd-colored marble and the last position must be occupied by a blue-colored marble. In how many ways can you form such a chain?",
    "message_2": "Let's label the marbles with different colors as follows: O1, O2, O3, E1, and E2. Here, O1, O2, and O3 are odd-colored marbles, and E1 and E2 are even-colored marbles. We are given that the first position should be occupied by an odd-colored marble, and the last position must be occupied by a blue-colored marble. Let's assume that the blue-colored marble is E1.\n\nNow, we have 4 positions left to fill with the remaining 4 marbles (O1, O2, O3, and E2). Since the order matters, we can use the permutation formula to find the number of ways to arrange these 4 marbles in 4 positions:\n\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n\nHere, n = 4 (number of marbles) and r = 4 (number of positions).\n\nP(4, 4) = 4! / (4 - 4)!\nP(4, 4) = 4! / 0!\nP(4, 4) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 / 1\nP(4, 4) = 24\n\nSo, there are 24 ways to arrange the remaining 4 marbles in the 4 positions.\n\nSince the first position is already occupied by an odd-colored marble and the last position is occupied by a blue-colored marble (E1), we have a total of 24 ways to form a chain with the given conditions."
