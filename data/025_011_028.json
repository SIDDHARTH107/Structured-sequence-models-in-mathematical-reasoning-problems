    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the abelian variety A over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_5$, we will plug in all the possible values of $x$ and $y$ from the field $\\mathbb{F}_5$ into the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 1$ and count the number of solutions.\n\nThe finite field $\\mathbb{F}_5$ has elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. We will go through each value of $x$ and check if there is a corresponding value of $y$ that satisfies the equation.\n\n1. For $x = 0$: $y^2 = 0^3 + 1 = 1$. The possible values of $y$ are 1 and 4, since $1^2 = 4^2 = 1$ in $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\n2. For $x = 1$: $y^2 = 1^3 + 1 = 2$. There are no solutions for $y$ in this case, since no element in $\\mathbb{F}_5$ squares to 2.\n3. For $x = 2$: $y^2 = 2^3 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 4$. The possible values of $y$ are 2 and 3, since $2^2 = 3^2 = 4$ in $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\n4. For $x = 3$: $y^2 = 3^3 + 1 = 27 + 1 = 3$. There are no solutions for $y$ in this case, since no element in $\\mathbb{F}_5$ squares to 3.\n5. For $x = 4$: $y^2 = 4^3 + 1 = 64 + 1 = 0$. The only possible value of $y$ is 0, since $0^2 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\n\nSo, there are 5 points on the abelian variety A over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_5$: (0, 1), (0, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), and (4, 0)."
