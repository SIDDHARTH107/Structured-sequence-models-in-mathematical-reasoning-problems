    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 4. We will show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4.\n\nFirst, note that by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 4. Since G has order 4, there must be an identity element e with order 1.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G contains an element of order 4.\nLet g be an element in G with order 4. Then, G = {e, g, g^2, g^3}, and G is a cyclic group generated by g. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4.\n\nCase 2: G does not contain an element of order 4.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let a and b be two distinct non-identity elements in G. Since both a and b have order 2, we have a^2 = e and b^2 = e. Now, consider the product ab. Since G has only 4 elements, the product ab must be either e, a, or b. If ab = e, then b = a^{-1}, which implies that G = {e, a, a^2} = {e, a, e}, a contradiction since G has 4 elements. If ab = a, then b = e, which is a contradiction since b is a non-identity element. Similarly, if ab = b, then a = e, which is a contradiction since a is a non-identity element. Therefore, ab must be a distinct element from e, a, and b. Let ab = c. Then G = {e, a, b, c}, and we have the following relations: a^2 = e, b^2 = e, c^2 = (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = ee = e. Thus, G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 4, it is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4. To determine which group G is isomorphic to, one needs to examine the elements and their orders in G. If there is an element of order 4, G is isomorphic to C4; otherwise, G is isomorphic to V4."
