The function can be approximated by a Fourier series with the following coefficients:\n\n- a0 = 100\n- a1 = 20\n- a2 = -10\n- a3 = 5\n- a4 = -2\n\nCalculate the stock price at t = 0.5 years.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the stock price at t = 0.5 years, we need to evaluate the Fourier series at t = 0.5. The Fourier series for a periodic function with period T (in this case, T = 1 year) can be represented as:\n\nf(t) = a0 + Σ[an * cos(2πnt/T) + bn * sin(2πnt/T)]\n\nSince we are only given the an coefficients, we can assume that the bn coefficients are zero. Therefore, the Fourier series simplifies to:\n\nf(t) = a0 + Σ[an * cos(2πnt/T)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given coefficients and the value of t = 0.5 years:\n\nf(0.5) = 100 + 20 * cos(2π * 1 * 0.5) - 10 * cos(2π * 2 * 0.5) + 5 * cos(2π * 3 * 0.5) - 2 * cos(2π * 4 * 0.5)\n\nf(0.5) = 100 + 20 * cos(π) - 10 * cos(2π) + 5 * cos(3π) - 2 * cos(4π)\n\nUsing the cosine values:\n\nf(0.5) = 100 - 20 * 1 - 10 * 1 + 5 * (-1) - 2 * 1\n\nf(0.5) = 100 - 20 - 10 - 5 - 2\n\nf(0.5) = 63\n\nSo, the stock price at t = 0.5 years is $63."
