    "message_2": "To find the impulse response of the communication network, we need to take the inverse Fourier transform of the transfer function H(f). The impulse response is represented as h(t) in the time domain.\n\nH(f) = 3jf / (j2f + 5)\n\nLet's first rewrite the transfer function H(f) in terms of the Laplace transform, replacing jf with s:\n\nH(s) = 3s / (2s + 5)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of H(s) to get the impulse response h(t) in the time domain. \n\nh(t) = L^(-1){3s / (2s + 5)}\n\nTo find the inverse Laplace transform, we can use partial fraction decomposition. We can rewrite H(s) as:\n\nH(s) = A / (2s + 5)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (2s + 5):\n\n3s = A(2s + 5)\n\nTo find the value of A, we can set s = 0:\n\nA = 3s / 5\n\nNow, we can rewrite H(s) as:\n\nH(s) = (3s / 5) / (2s + 5)\n\nTaking the inverse Laplace transform:\n\nh(t) = L^(-1){(3s / 5) / (2s + 5)}\n\nh(t) = (3/5) * L^(-1){1 / (2s + 5)}\n\nNow, we know that the inverse Laplace transform of 1 / (as + b) is (1/a) * e^(-b*t/a):\n\nh(t) = (3/5) * (1/2) * e^(-5t/2)\n\nh(t) = (3/10) * e^(-5t/2)\n\nSo, the impulse response of the communication network in the time domain is:\n\nh(t) = (3/10) * e^(-5t/2)"
