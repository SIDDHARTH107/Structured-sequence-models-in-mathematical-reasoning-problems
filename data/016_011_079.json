    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a fractal is a measure of its complexity and self-similarity. For the Vicsek fractal, the Hausdorff dimension is independent of the side length. \n\nTo calculate the Hausdorff dimension, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are 5 self-similar pieces (N = 5), and each piece is scaled down by a factor of 3 (s = 3). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal is approximately 1.465, regardless of the side length."
