    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 2x - x^2 over the interval 0 < x < 2π, we first need to define the function over the interval. Since there are discontinuities at x = π/2 and x = 3π/2, we can define the function as follows:\n\nf(x) = { 2x - x^2, 0 < x < π/2\n         { g(x), π/2 < x < 3π/2\n         { 2x - x^2, 3π/2 < x < 2π\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier series representation of f(x) using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x)]dx from 0 to L\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nπx/L)]dx from 0 to L\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)]dx from 0 to L\n\nwhere L = π (half of the interval length) and n is a positive integer.\n\nFirst, we find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫(2x - x^2)dx from 0 to π/2 + ∫(g(x))dx from π/2 to 3π/2 + ∫(2x - x^2)dx from 3π/2 to 2π]\n\nSince g(x) is not given, we cannot compute the integral for g(x). However, we can compute the other two integrals:\n\n∫(2x - x^2)dx from 0 to π/2 = [(x^2 - (1/3)x^3) evaluated from 0 to π/2] = (π^2/4 - π^3/24)\n∫(2x - x^2)dx from 3π/2 to 2π = [(x^2 - (1/3)x^3) evaluated from 3π/2 to 2π] = (2π^2 - 8π^3/3) - (9π^2/4 - 27π^3/8)\n\nNow, we find a_n:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [∫(2x - x^2) * cos(nπx/π)dx from 0 to π/2 + ∫(g(x) * cos(nπx/π))dx from π/2 to 3π/2 + ∫(2x - x^2) * cos(nπx/π)dx from 3π/2 to 2π]\n\nAgain, we cannot compute the integral for g(x). However, we can compute the other two integrals using integration by parts.\n\nFinally, we find b_n:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [∫(2x - x^2) * sin(nπx/π)dx from 0 to π/2 + ∫(g(x) * sin(nπx/π))dx from π/2 to 3π/2 + ∫(2x - x^2) * sin(nπx/π)dx from 3π/2 to 2π]\n\nAgain, we cannot compute the integral for g(x). However, we can compute the other two integrals using integration by parts.\n\nIn summary, the Fourier series representation of f(x) is:\n\nf(x) ≈ a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are given by the formulas above, and the summation is taken over all positive integers n. However, without the information about g(x), we cannot compute the exact Fourier series representation."
