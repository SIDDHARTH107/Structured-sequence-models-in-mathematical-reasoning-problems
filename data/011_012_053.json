    "message_1": "Suppose there are 50 students in a class. 20 students like to play soccer, 25 students like to play basketball, and 15 students like to play both soccer and basketball. How many students in the class do not like soccer or basketball at all?",
    "message_2": "To find out how many students do not like soccer or basketball at all, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal number of students = 50\nNumber of students who like soccer = 20\nNumber of students who like basketball = 25\nNumber of students who like both soccer and basketball = 15\n\nFirst, we find the number of students who like either soccer or basketball (or both). To do this, we add the number of students who like soccer and the number of students who like basketball, and then subtract the number of students who like both (since they are counted twice).\n\nNumber of students who like soccer or basketball = (Number of students who like soccer) + (Number of students who like basketball) - (Number of students who like both)\n\nNumber of students who like soccer or basketball = 20 + 25 - 15 = 30\n\nNow, to find the number of students who do not like soccer or basketball at all, we subtract the number of students who like soccer or basketball from the total number of students.\n\nNumber of students who do not like soccer or basketball = (Total number of students) - (Number of students who like soccer or basketball)\n\nNumber of students who do not like soccer or basketball = 50 - 30 = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 students in the class who do not like soccer or basketball at all."
