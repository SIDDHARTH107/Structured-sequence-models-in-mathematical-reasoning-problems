    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the system of linear equations in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and b is the column vector of constants (3, 10, 8).\n\nA = | 1  2  1 |\n    | 2  8  1 |\n    | 0  3  3 |\n\nb = | 3  |\n    | 10 |\n    | 8  |\n\nNow, we'll perform the Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. The Cholesky decomposition is a method used to decompose a symmetric, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. In this case, A = LL^T, where L is a lower triangular matrix and L^T is its transpose.\n\nL = | l11  0    0  |\n    | l21  l22  0  |\n    | 0    l32  l33|\n\nL^T = | l11  l21  0   |\n      | 0    l22  l32 |\n      | 0    0    l33 |\n\nTo find the elements of L, we use the following equations:\n\nl11 = sqrt(a11) = sqrt(1) = 1\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 2 / 1 = 2\nl22 = sqrt(a22 - l21^2) = sqrt(8 - 2^2) = sqrt(4) = 2\nl32 = a32 / l22 = 3 / 2 = 1.5\nl33 = sqrt(a33 - l32^2) = sqrt(3 - 1.5^2) = sqrt(1.75)\n\nSo, the L matrix is:\n\nL = | 1    0     0    |\n    | 2    2     0    |\n    | 0    1.5   sqrt(1.75) |\n\nNow, we solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n| 1    0     0    | | y1 |   | 3  |\n| 2    2     0    | | y2 | = | 10 |\n| 0    1.5   sqrt(1.75) | | y3 |   | 8  |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 3 / 1 = 3\ny2 = (10 - 2 * y1) / 2 = (10 - 6) / 2 = 2\ny3 = (8 - 1.5 * y2) / sqrt(1.75) = (8 - 3) / sqrt(1.75) = 5 / sqrt(1.75)\n\nNow, we solve the system L^T x = y for x:\n\n| 1    2     0    | | x1 |   | 3  |\n| 0    2     1.5  | | x2 | = | 2  |\n| 0    0     sqrt(1.75) | | x3 |   | 5 / sqrt(1.75) |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx3 = (5 / sqrt(1.75)) / sqrt(1.75) = 5 / 1.75 = 20/7\nx2 = (2 - 1.5 * x3) / 2 = (2 - 1.5 * 20/7) / 2 = -1/7\nx1 = (3 - 2 * x2) / 1 = (3 + 2/7) / 1 = 23/7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 23/7\ny = -1/7\nz = 20/7"
