    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2, we first need to find its first derivative, f'(x), and then set it equal to zero to solve for the critical points.\n\nThe first derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nTo make it easier to solve, we can divide the entire equation by 3:\n\n0 = x^2 - 4x + 3\n\nNow, factor the quadratic equation:\n\n0 = (x - 3)(x - 1)\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3."
