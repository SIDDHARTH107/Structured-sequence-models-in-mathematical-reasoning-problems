Further, suppose that $f(x)$ is real-valued for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Show that $f(z)$ can be reflected across the real axis to obtain a holomorphic function on the lower half plane $\\text{Im}(z) < 0$.\n\nSpecifically, let $g(z)$ denote the reflection of $f(z)$ across the real axis (i.e., $g(z) = \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$ for $z \\notin \\mathbb{R}$). Show that $g(z)$ is holomorphic in $\\text{Im}(z) < 0$ and extends continuously to the real axis such that $g(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nThen, solve for $g(z)$ for the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{1+z^2}$, where $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.",
    "message_2": "To show that $g(z)$ is holomorphic in $\\text{Im}(z) < 0$, we first note that $f(z)$ is holomorphic in the upper half plane, so its complex conjugate $f(\\overline{z})$ is anti-holomorphic in the lower half plane. This means that the derivative of $f(\\overline{z})$ with respect to $\\overline{z}$ exists and is continuous in the lower half plane. Now, since $g(z) = \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$, taking the complex conjugate of both sides gives $\\overline{g(z)} = f(\\overline{z})$. \n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to $z$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{d\\overline{g(z)}}{dz} = \\frac{df(\\overline{z})}{d\\overline{z}} \\frac{d\\overline{z}}{dz}$\n\nSince $f(\\overline{z})$ is anti-holomorphic, its derivative with respect to $\\overline{z}$ exists and is continuous. Also, $\\frac{d\\overline{z}}{dz} = 1$. Therefore, the derivative of $\\overline{g(z)}$ with respect to $z$ exists and is continuous, which implies that $g(z)$ is holomorphic in the lower half plane.\n\nNow, we show that $g(z)$ extends continuously to the real axis such that $g(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $f(z)$ is continuous on the real axis and $f(x)$ is real-valued for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have:\n\n$g(x) = \\overline{f(\\overline{x})} = \\overline{f(x)} = f(x)$\n\nThus, $g(z)$ extends continuously to the real axis and agrees with $f(z)$ on the real axis.\n\nNow, let's find $g(z)$ for the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{1+z^2}$. We have:\n\n$g(z) = \\overline{f(\\overline{z})} = \\overline{\\frac{1}{1+\\overline{z}^2}}$\n\nTo find the complex conjugate of the function, we first find the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\n$\\overline{1+\\overline{z}^2} = \\overline{1} + \\overline{\\overline{z}}^2 = 1 + z^2$\n\nNow, we can find the complex conjugate of the function:\n\n$g(z) = \\frac{\\overline{1}}{\\overline{1+z^2}} = \\frac{1}{1+z^2}$\n\nSo, $g(z) = \\frac{1}{1+z^2}$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ with $\\text{Im}(z) < 0$."
