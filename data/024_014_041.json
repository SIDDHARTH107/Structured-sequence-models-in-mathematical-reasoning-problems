    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of vector field V along vector field Y, we use the Lie bracket [Y, V]. The Lie bracket is defined as [Y, V] = Y(V) - V(Y), where Y(V) and V(Y) are the action of Y on V and the action of V on Y, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's compute Y(V):\n\nY(V) = (2x∂/∂x + ∂/∂y)(x^2 ∂/∂x + x∂/∂y)\n     = 2x∂/∂x(x^2 ∂/∂x + x∂/∂y) + ∂/∂y(x^2 ∂/∂x + x∂/∂y)\n\nNow, apply the product rule:\n\nY(V) = 2x(2x ∂/∂x + x ∂/∂y) + (2x^2 ∂/∂y + x ∂/∂x)\n\nNext, compute V(Y):\n\nV(Y) = (x^2 ∂/∂x + x∂/∂y)(2x∂/∂x + ∂/∂y)\n     = x^2 ∂/∂x(2x ∂/∂x + ∂/∂y) + x∂/∂y(2x ∂/∂x + ∂/∂y)\n\nApply the product rule:\n\nV(Y) = x^2(2 ∂/∂x + x ∂/∂y) + x(2x ∂/∂y + ∂/∂x)\n\nNow, compute the Lie bracket [Y, V] = Y(V) - V(Y):\n\n[Y, V] = (2x(2x ∂/∂x + x ∂/∂y) + (2x^2 ∂/∂y + x ∂/∂x)) - (x^2(2 ∂/∂x + x ∂/∂y) + x(2x ∂/∂y + ∂/∂x))\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n[Y, V] = 2x^2 ∂/∂x + x^2 ∂/∂y\n\nFinally, evaluate the Lie derivative at the point (2, 3):\n\nL_Y(V)(2, 3) = (2(2)^2 ∂/∂x + (2)^2 ∂/∂y) = 8 ∂/∂x + 4 ∂/∂y\n\nThus, the Lie derivative of V along Y at the point (2, 3) is 8 ∂/∂x + 4 ∂/∂y."
