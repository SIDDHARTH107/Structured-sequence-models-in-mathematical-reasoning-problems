    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the composite function f(x) using the chain rule, we need to find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x) and then multiply them together.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of g(x) with respect to x:\ng(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2\ng'(x) = 6x + 5\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of h(x) with respect to x:\nh(x) = x^3\nh'(x) = 3x^2\n\nNow, we can use the chain rule to find the derivative of f(x):\nf(x) = h(g(x))\nf'(x) = h'(g(x)) * g'(x)\n\nSubstitute the derivatives we found earlier:\nf'(x) = 3(3x^2 + 5x - 2)^2 * (6x + 5)\n\nNow, we need to find f'(2):\nf'(2) = 3(3(2)^2 + 5(2) - 2)^2 * (6(2) + 5)\nf'(2) = 3(12 + 10 - 2)^2 * (12 + 5)\nf'(2) = 3(20)^2 * (17)\nf'(2) = 3(400) * 17\nf'(2) = 1200 * 17\nf'(2) = 20400\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) at x = 2 is 20,400."
