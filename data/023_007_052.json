    "message_1": "Consider a periodic signal with a period of 2 seconds. The signal is described by the function f(t) = sin(2πt) + 2cos(4πt) - 3sin(6πt). \n\nWhat are the amplitudes and frequencies of the sine and cosine components in the signal's Fourier series representation?",
    "message_2": "The given function f(t) is already in the form of a Fourier series representation, which is a sum of sine and cosine functions with different frequencies and amplitudes. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(t) = a0 + Σ[an * cos(nωt) + bn * sin(nωt)]\n\nwhere a0, an, and bn are the coefficients, ω is the angular frequency, and n is the harmonic number.\n\nIn this case, the function f(t) is given as:\n\nf(t) = sin(2πt) + 2cos(4πt) - 3sin(6πt)\n\nComparing this with the general form of the Fourier series, we can identify the amplitudes and frequencies of the sine and cosine components:\n\n1. Sine component with frequency ω1 = 2π (1st harmonic):\nAmplitude: b1 = 1\n\n2. Cosine component with frequency ω2 = 4π (2nd harmonic):\nAmplitude: a2 = 2\n\n3. Sine component with frequency ω3 = 6π (3rd harmonic):\nAmplitude: b3 = -3\n\nThere is no constant term (a0) in this function.\n\nSo, the amplitudes and frequencies of the sine and cosine components in the signal's Fourier series representation are:\n\n1. Sine component: Amplitude = 1, Frequency = 2π\n2. Cosine component: Amplitude = 2, Frequency = 4π\n3. Sine component: Amplitude = -3, Frequency = 6π"
