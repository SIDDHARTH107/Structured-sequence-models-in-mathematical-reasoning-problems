    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection of A and B, which is denoted by A ∩ B. Since A and B have no common elements, their intersection is the empty set, denoted by ∅.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and A, denoted by (A ∩ B) x A. Since (A ∩ B) is an empty set, the Cartesian product of an empty set with any set is also an empty set. Therefore, (A ∩ B) x A = ∅.\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted by A x B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. So, A x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and A, denoted by A x A. A x A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)}.\n\nFinally, let's find the intersection of (A x B) and (A x A), denoted by (A x B) ∩ (A x A). Since there are no common ordered pairs between A x B and A x A, their intersection is the empty set. Therefore, (A x B) ∩ (A x A) = ∅.\n\nIn conclusion, (A ∩ B) x A = ∅ and (A x B) ∩ (A x A) = ∅."
