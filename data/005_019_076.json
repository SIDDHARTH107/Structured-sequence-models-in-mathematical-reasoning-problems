    "message_1": "Suppose a basketball player has a free throw shooting percentage of 70%. If the player misses a free throw, the probability that he makes the second free throw is 50%. \n\nWhat is the probability that the player will make exactly 3 out of 5 free throws?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the player will make exactly 3 out of 5 free throws, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, 5 free throws), k is the number of successful trials (3 made free throws), p is the probability of success (70% or 0.7), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nFirst, let's find C(5, 3):\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\nC(5, 3) = 120 / (6 * 2)\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.7^3 * (1-0.7)^(5-3)\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.7^3 * 0.3^2\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.343 * 0.09\nP(X = 3) â‰ˆ 0.3105\n\nSo, the probability that the player will make exactly 3 out of 5 free throws is approximately 31.05%."
