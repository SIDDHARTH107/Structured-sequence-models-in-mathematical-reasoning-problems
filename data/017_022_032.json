    "message_2": "To determine the isomorphism class of G, we first look at the possible structures of a group of order 60. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there are Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor of the order of G.\n\nLet n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G. By Sylow's third theorem, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 15 and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2.\n2. n_3 divides 20 and n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3.\n3. n_5 divides 12 and n_5 is congruent to 1 mod 5.\n\nFrom these conditions, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. n_2 can be 1, 3, 5, or 15.\n2. n_3 can be 1, 4, or 10.\n3. n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor, and these subgroups are normal in G. Then G is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and G is isomorphic to C_4 × C_3 × C_5, which is a cyclic group of order 60, C60.\n\nCase 2: n_5 = 6\nIn this case, G has six Sylow 5-subgroups. Since the index of a Sylow 5-subgroup is 12, by the action of G on the set of its Sylow 5-subgroups, we get a homomorphism from G to S_6. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all Sylow 5-subgroups, and it is a normal subgroup of G. If the kernel is trivial, then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_6, and the only subgroup of order 60 in S_6 is A5. If the kernel is nontrivial, then G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of the kernel and A5.\n\nCase 3: n_3 = 10\nIn this case, G has ten Sylow 3-subgroups. Since the index of a Sylow 3-subgroup is 20, by the action of G on the set of its Sylow 3-subgroups, we get a homomorphism from G to S_{10}. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all Sylow 3-subgroups, and it is a normal subgroup of G. If the kernel is trivial, then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_{10}, and the only subgroup of order 60 in S_{10} is A5 × C2. If the kernel is nontrivial, then G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of the kernel and A5 × C2.\n\nIn summary, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5, the direct product A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, which are semidirect products of normal subgroups with A5 or A5 × C2. To determine which isomorphism class G belongs to, more information about the group structure is needed."
