    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the given matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented in matrix form as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A = | 2  1 |, X = | x |, and B = | 7  |\n          | 4  3 |       | y |        | 19 |\n\nStep 1: LU Decomposition\n\nWe will decompose matrix A into L and U matrices:\n\nL = | 1  0 |, U = | 2  1 |\n      | l21 1 |       | 0  u22 |\n\nTo find the values of l21, u22, we perform the following calculations:\n\nl21 = a21 / u11 = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nu22 = a22 - l21 * u12 = 3 - 2 * 1 = 1\n\nSo, the L and U matrices are:\n\nL = | 1  0 |\n      | 2  1 |\n\nU = | 2  1 |\n      | 0  1 |\n\nStep 2: Solve the equation L * Y = B for Y\n\n| 1  0 | | y1 |   | 7  |\n| 2  1 | | y2 | = | 19 |\n\nFrom the first equation, we get:\n\ny1 = 7\n\nFrom the second equation, we get:\n\n2 * y1 + y2 = 19\n2 * 7 + y2 = 19\ny2 = 19 - 14 = 5\n\nSo, Y = | 7 |\n          | 5 |\n\nStep 3: Solve the equation U * X = Y for X\n\n| 2  1 | | x |   | 7 |\n| 0  1 | | y | = | 5 |\n\nFrom the second equation, we get:\n\ny = 5\n\nFrom the first equation, we get:\n\n2 * x + y = 7\n2 * x + 5 = 7\n2 * x = 2\nx = 1\n\nSo, X = | 1 |\n          | 5 |\n\nTherefore, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1 and y = 5."
