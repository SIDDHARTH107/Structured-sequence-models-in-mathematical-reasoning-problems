    "message_1": "A stream cipher generates a random binary sequence based on a seed key. A particular stream cipher generates a keystream that consists of the sequence: 0110, 1011, 1110, 0001, 1001, ... If the stream cipher uses a seed key of 1100, what would be the first 4 digits of the keystream generated by this stream cipher?",
    "message_2": "To determine the first 4 digits of the keystream generated by this stream cipher with a seed key of 1100, we need to understand the pattern or algorithm used by the stream cipher. However, the information provided is not sufficient to determine the pattern or algorithm.\n\nIf we had more information about the stream cipher's algorithm or how the seed key is used to generate the keystream, we could potentially determine the first 4 digits of the keystream. Without that information, it is impossible to provide an accurate answer."
