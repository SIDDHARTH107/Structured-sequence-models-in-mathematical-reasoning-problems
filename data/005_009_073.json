The test scores of both groups are given below:\n```\nGroup A: 85, 72, 90, 68, 78, 80, 82, 94, 76, 89\nGroup B: 90, 87, 75, 82, 80, 85, 92, 88, 78, 81\n```\nUsing Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test, can you determine if there is a significant difference in the median test scores of both groups?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in the median test scores of both groups using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Combine the scores from both groups and sort them in ascending order.\n2. Assign ranks to the sorted scores. In case of ties, assign the average rank.\n3. Calculate the rank sum for each group.\n4. Determine the test statistic (W) and compare it to the critical value or calculate the p-value.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Combine and sort the scores:\n```\n68, 72, 75, 78, 78, 80, 80, 81, 82, 82, 85, 85, 87, 88, 89, 90, 90, 92, 94\n```\n\n2. Assign ranks to the sorted scores:\n```\n1, 2, 3, 4.5, 4.5, 6.5, 6.5, 8, 9.5, 9.5, 11.5, 11.5, 13, 14, 15, 16.5, 16.5, 18, 19\n```\n\n3. Calculate the rank sum for each group:\n\nGroup A ranks: 1, 2, 4.5, 6.5, 9.5, 11.5, 15, 16.5, 18, 19\nGroup A rank sum: 1 + 2 + 4.5 + 6.5 + 9.5 + 11.5 + 15 + 16.5 + 18 + 19 = 104\n\nGroup B ranks: 3, 4.5, 6.5, 8, 9.5, 11.5, 13, 14, 16.5, 20\nGroup B rank sum: 3 + 4.5 + 6.5 + 8 + 9.5 + 11.5 + 13 + 14 + 16.5 + 20 = 106\n\n4. Determine the test statistic (W) and compare it to the critical value or calculate the p-value:\n\nIn this case, we will use the smaller rank sum as our test statistic W. So, W = 104.\n\nFor a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and sample sizes of 10 for both groups, the critical values for the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test are 40 and 170. If our test statistic W falls outside this range, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the median test scores of both groups.\n\nSince our test statistic W = 104 falls within the critical range (40, 170), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is no significant difference in the median test scores of Group A and Group B using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test at a 0.05 significance level."
