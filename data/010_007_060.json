    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of X, we first need to understand the space X obtained by identifying the opposite edges of a square. This space is known as the torus, which can be visualized as a doughnut shape.\n\nNow, let's find the fundamental group of the torus. We will use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which states that if a space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected subsets A and B, then the fundamental group of X can be computed as the free product of the fundamental groups of A and B, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the images of the fundamental group of their intersection.\n\nLet A and B be two overlapping open sets that cover the torus, such that A is a small open neighborhood around one point on the torus and B is the torus with a small open disk removed. Then, A is contractible (i.e., homotopy equivalent to a point), and B is homotopy equivalent to the wedge sum of two circles, S^1 ∨ S^1.\n\nThe intersection of A and B is also contractible, so its fundamental group is trivial. Therefore, the Seifert-van Kampen theorem tells us that the fundamental group of the torus is the free product of the fundamental groups of A and B, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the images of the fundamental group of their intersection. Since the fundamental group of A and the intersection is trivial, we have:\n\nπ₁(X) ≅ π₁(B) ≅ π₁(S^1 ∨ S^1)\n\nThe fundamental group of the wedge sum of two circles is the free group on two generators, which can be represented as:\n\nπ₁(S^1 ∨ S^1) ≅ ⟨a, b⟩\n\nwhere a and b are the generators corresponding to the two circles.\n\nThus, the fundamental group of the torus X is:\n\nπ₁(X) ≅ ⟨a, b⟩\n\nThis group is isomorphic to the direct product of two infinite cyclic groups, Z × Z:\n\nπ₁(X) ≅ Z × Z"
