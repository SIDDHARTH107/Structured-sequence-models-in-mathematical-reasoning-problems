    "message_2": "To solve the given initial value problem, we first find the characteristic equation of the given differential equation:\n\nr^2 + 2r + 2 = 0\n\nNow, we solve for r using the quadratic formula:\n\nr = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 2, and c = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nr = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1)\nr = (-2 ± √(-4)) / 2\nr = -1 ± √(-1)\nr = -1 ± i\n\nSo, we have two complex roots: r1 = -1 + i and r2 = -1 - i.\n\nNow, we can write the general solution of the given differential equation as:\n\ny(z) = C1 * e^((-1 + i)z) + C2 * e^((-1 - i)z)\n\nTo find the constants C1 and C2, we use the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 0 => C1 * e^(0) + C2 * e^(0) = 0 => C1 + C2 = 0\ny'(0) = 1\n\nTo find y'(z), we differentiate y(z) with respect to z:\n\ny'(z) = (-1 + i)C1 * e^((-1 + i)z) + (-1 - i)C2 * e^((-1 - i)z)\n\nNow, we apply the second initial condition:\n\ny'(0) = 1 => (-1 + i)C1 * e^(0) + (-1 - i)C2 * e^(0) = 1\n=> (-1 + i)C1 + (-1 - i)C2 = 1\n\nWe already know that C1 + C2 = 0, so C2 = -C1. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:\n\n(-1 + i)C1 + (-1 - i)(-C1) = 1\n(2i)C1 = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for C1:\n\nC1 = 1 / (2i) = -i/2\n\nSince C2 = -C1, we have C2 = i/2.\n\nFinally, we can write the solution of the initial value problem as:\n\ny(z) = -i/2 * e^((-1 + i)z) + i/2 * e^((-1 - i)z)"
