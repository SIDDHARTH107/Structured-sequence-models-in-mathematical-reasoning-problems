    "message_2": "To verify that (A ∪ B)' × B' ≠ A' × B', we will first find the complements of the sets A, B, and (A ∪ B), and then find the Cartesian products of the respective complements.\n\nLet U be the universal set, such that A, B ⊆ U. For simplicity, let's assume U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. \n\nNow, we find the complements of A, B, and (A ∪ B):\n\nA' = U - A = {4, 5, 6, 7}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}\n(A ∪ B)' = U - (A ∪ B) = U - {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} = {6, 7}\n\nNext, we find the Cartesian products of the respective complements:\n\n(A ∪ B)' × B' = {6, 7} × {1, 2, 3, 6, 7} = {(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,6), (6,7), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,6), (7,7)}\n\nA' × B' = {4, 5, 6, 7} × {1, 2, 3, 6, 7} = {(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,6), (4,7), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,6), (5,7), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,6), (6,7), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,6), (7,7)}\n\nComparing the two Cartesian products, we can see that (A ∪ B)' × B' ≠ A' × B'. The elements (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,6), (4,7), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,6), and (5,7) are present in A' × B' but not in (A ∪ B)' × B'. \n\nThis shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement using the sets A and B."
