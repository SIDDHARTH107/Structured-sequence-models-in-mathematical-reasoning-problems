    "message_1": "Consider a European call option with a strike price of $50, a time to maturity of 1 year, and underlying asset following the Black-Scholes-Merton equation with a constant risk-free rate of 5% and a stochastic volatility that follows the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process with parameters $\\kappa=0.5, \\theta=0.3, \\sigma=0.1$. If the current asset price is $55$, what is the price of the option according to the Black-Scholes-Merton model with stochastic volatility? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To price the European call option with stochastic volatility, we first need to find the expected volatility over the time to maturity. Since the volatility follows the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process, we can use the mean reversion property to find the expected volatility at the time of maturity.\n\nThe expected volatility at time t, given the initial volatility V(0), is given by:\n\n$E[V(t)] = \\theta + (V(0) - \\theta)e^{-\\kappa t}$\n\nAssuming the initial volatility V(0) is equal to the long-term mean $\\theta$, we have:\n\n$E[V(t)] = \\theta + (\\theta - \\theta)e^{-\\kappa t} = \\theta$\n\nSo, the expected volatility over the time to maturity is 0.3.\n\nNow, we can use the Black-Scholes-Merton model to price the European call option. The formula for the call option price is:\n\n$C = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)$\n\nwhere\n\n$d_1 = \\frac{ln(\\frac{S_0}{K}) + (r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})T}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}}$\n\n$d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T}$\n\n$S_0$ is the current asset price, $K$ is the strike price, $r$ is the risk-free rate, $\\sigma$ is the expected volatility, $T$ is the time to maturity, and $N(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$d_1 = \\frac{ln(\\frac{55}{50}) + (0.05 + \\frac{0.3^2}{2})(1)}{0.3 \\sqrt{1}} \\approx 0.759$\n\n$d_2 = 0.759 - 0.3 \\sqrt{1} \\approx 0.459$\n\n$C = 55 N(0.759) - 50 e^{-0.05(1)} N(0.459) \\approx 55(0.776) - 50(0.9512)(0.676) \\approx 42.68 - 32.14 \\approx 10.54$\n\nSo, the price of the European call option according to the Black-Scholes-Merton model with stochastic volatility is approximately $10.54."
