    "message_1": "Suppose you have $20,000 to invest in two stocks: A and B. Stock A has an expected return of 7% and a standard deviation of 12%, while stock B has an expected return of 10% and a standard deviation of 15%. The correlation between the two stocks is 0.5. What is the optimal investment, in dollars, for each stock to achieve the highest possible return with the lowest possible risk?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal investment in each stock, we need to calculate the portfolio weights that minimize the portfolio risk while maximizing the return. We can do this using the concept of the efficient frontier and the portfolio variance formula.\n\nLet x be the proportion of the investment in stock A and (1-x) be the proportion of the investment in stock B. The expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as:\n\nRp = x * Expected Return of A + (1-x) * Expected Return of B\n\nThe portfolio variance (σp^2) can be calculated as:\n\nσp^2 = (x^2 * σA^2) + ((1-x)^2 * σB^2) + (2 * x * (1-x) * ρAB * σA * σB)\n\nWhere σA and σB are the standard deviations of stocks A and B, and ρAB is the correlation between the two stocks.\n\nGiven the values:\nExpected Return of A = 7% = 0.07\nExpected Return of B = 10% = 0.10\nσA = 12% = 0.12\nσB = 15% = 0.15\nρAB = 0.5\n\nWe can plug these values into the portfolio variance formula:\n\nσp^2 = (x^2 * 0.12^2) + ((1-x)^2 * 0.15^2) + (2 * x * (1-x) * 0.5 * 0.12 * 0.15)\n\nTo find the optimal investment, we need to minimize the portfolio variance while maximizing the return. This can be done using calculus and optimization techniques, but for simplicity, we can use numerical methods to find the optimal value of x.\n\nBy testing different values of x, we find that the optimal value is approximately x = 0.63. This means that 63% of the investment should be in stock A, and the remaining 37% should be in stock B.\n\nNow, we can calculate the optimal investment in dollars for each stock:\n\nInvestment in A = 0.63 * $20,000 = $12,600\nInvestment in B = 0.37 * $20,000 = $7,400\n\nSo, the optimal investment is $12,600 in stock A and $7,400 in stock B to achieve the highest possible return with the lowest possible risk."
