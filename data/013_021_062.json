    "message_1": "In a centipede game, there are two players. Player 1 has an initial reward of $100 and player 2 has an initial reward of $0. The game consists of 6 rounds. In each round, player 1 has the option to either \"continue\" or \"stop.\" If player 1 chooses \"continue,\" both players' rewards double. However, if player 1 chooses \"stop,\" the game ends and both players receive their current reward. If the game ends in round 6, both players receive their final reward. If player 1 continues in all 6 rounds, what is the final reward for both players?",
    "message_2": "If player 1 chooses to continue in all 6 rounds, their rewards will double in each round. Let's calculate the rewards for both players after each round:\n\nRound 1: Player 1 has $100 * 2 = $200, Player 2 has $0 * 2 = $0\nRound 2: Player 1 has $200 * 2 = $400, Player 2 has $0 * 2 = $0\nRound 3: Player 1 has $400 * 2 = $800, Player 2 has $0 * 2 = $0\nRound 4: Player 1 has $800 * 2 = $1600, Player 2 has $0 * 2 = $0\nRound 5: Player 1 has $1600 * 2 = $3200, Player 2 has $0 * 2 = $0\nRound 6: Player 1 has $3200 * 2 = $6400, Player 2 has $0 * 2 = $0\n\nIf player 1 continues in all 6 rounds, the final reward for player 1 will be $6400, and the final reward for player 2 will be $0."
