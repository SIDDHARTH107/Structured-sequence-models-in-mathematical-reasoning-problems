    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of y in both equations equal:\n\n1) 4x - 3y = 5\n2) 6x + 3y = 3\n\nNow, we will add both equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(4x - 3y) + (6x + 3y) = 5 + 3\n4x + 6x = 8\n10x = 8\nx = 8/10\nx = 4/5\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into either equation to find the value of y. We will use the second equation:\n\n2x + y = 1\n2(4/5) + y = 1\n8/5 + y = 1\n\nTo solve for y, subtract 8/5 from both sides:\n\ny = 1 - 8/5\ny = (5 - 8)/5\ny = -3/5\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 4/5 and y = -3/5."
