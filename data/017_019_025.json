In other words, prove that there does not exist any other group of order 36 except for cyclic group C36, alternating group A4 × C3 or nine non-abelian groups of order 36.",
    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 36. Since 36 = 2^2 * 3^2, by the Sylow theorems, we know that there exist Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Let P_2 and P_3 denote the Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup of G, respectively.\n\nFirst, consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4. If n_3 = 1, then P_3 is a normal subgroup of G. If n_3 = 4, then by the Sylow theorems, there must be a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S_4. Since the alternating group A_4 has index 2 in S_4, the kernel of this homomorphism must be a normal subgroup of G of order 9. Thus, in either case, there exists a normal subgroup of G of order 9, which we denote by N.\n\nNow, consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 9 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 9. If n_2 = 1, then P_2 is a normal subgroup of G. If n_2 = 9, then the action of G on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S_9. Since the alternating group A_9 has index 2 in S_9, the kernel of this homomorphism must be a normal subgroup of G of order 4. Thus, in either case, there exists a normal subgroup of G of order 4, which we denote by M.\n\nNow, we have normal subgroups N and M of G with orders 9 and 4, respectively. Since the orders of N and M are relatively prime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., N ∩ M = {e}. By the second isomorphism theorem, we have G ≅ NM, where NM is the internal direct product of N and M.\n\nSince N has order 9 and M has order 4, they are isomorphic to C_9 and C_4 or C_2 × C_2, respectively. Thus, we have the following possibilities for the structure of G:\n\n1. G ≅ C_9 × C_4: In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C36.\n\n2. G ≅ C_9 × (C_2 × C_2): In this case, G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C3.\n\n3. G ≅ (C_3 × C_3) × C_4: In this case, G is isomorphic to one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\n4. G ≅ (C_3 × C_3) × (C_2 × C_2): In this case, G is isomorphic to one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nIn all cases, G is isomorphic to one of the groups mentioned in the problem statement. Therefore, there does not exist any other group of order 36 except for the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, or the nine non-abelian groups of order 36."
