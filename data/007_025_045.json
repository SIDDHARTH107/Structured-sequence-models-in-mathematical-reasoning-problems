    "message_1": "Alice and Bob want to agree on a secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method. Alice chooses a prime number $p=17$ and a primitive root modulo $p$, which is $g=3$. Alice's private key is $a=5$ and Bob's private key is $b=9$. They exchange their public keys and obtain $A=g^a \\mod p$ and $B=g^b \\mod p$. What is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob agreed upon?",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute Alice's public key $A$ and Bob's public key $B$:\n\n$A = g^a \\mod p = 3^5 \\mod 17 = 243 \\mod 17 = 11$\n\n$B = g^b \\mod p = 3^9 \\mod 17 = 19683 \\mod 17 = 13$\n\nNow, Alice and Bob can compute the shared secret key using each other's public key and their own private key:\n\nShared secret key for Alice: $S_A = B^a \\mod p = 13^5 \\mod 17 = 371293 \\mod 17 = 3$\n\nShared secret key for Bob: $S_B = A^b \\mod p = 11^9 \\mod 17 = 2357947691 \\mod 17 = 3$\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have computed the same shared secret key, which is $3$."
