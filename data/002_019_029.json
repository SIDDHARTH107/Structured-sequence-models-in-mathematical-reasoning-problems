    "message_1": "A cone has a height of 8 cm and a radius of 4 cm. What is its surface area to the nearest tenth?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral surface area (a curved surface). The formula for the surface area of a cone is given by:\n\nSurface Area = πr² (base area) + πrL (lateral surface area)\n\nwhere r is the radius, L is the slant height, and π is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slant height (L) using the Pythagorean theorem, since we have a right triangle formed by the height (h), radius (r), and slant height (L):\n\nL² = r² + h²\n\nGiven the height (h) is 8 cm and the radius (r) is 4 cm:\n\nL² = 4² + 8²\nL² = 16 + 64\nL² = 80\nL = √80 ≈ 8.9 cm (rounded to the nearest tenth)\n\nNow, we can find the surface area:\n\nSurface Area = π(4²) + π(4)(8.9)\nSurface Area = 3.14159(16) + 3.14159(4)(8.9)\nSurface Area ≈ 50.265 + 112.266\nSurface Area ≈ 162.531 cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 162.5 cm² to the nearest tenth."
