    "message_2": "A Gosper curve is a fractal curve that is generated by replacing each line segment with a series of smaller line segments according to a specific pattern. In each iteration, each line segment is replaced by 7 smaller line segments. \n\nAfter the first iteration, the number of line segments in the Gosper curve is 3 * 7 = 21, since there are 3 sides in the equilateral triangle and each side is replaced by 7 smaller line segments.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the number of line segments is multiplied by 7. So, after 4 iterations, the number of line segments will be:\n\n21 * 7^3 = 21 * 343 = 7203\n\nSo, there will be 7203 line segments in the Gosper curve after 4 iterations."
