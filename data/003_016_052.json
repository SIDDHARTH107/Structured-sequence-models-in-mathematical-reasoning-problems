    "message_2": "The phase shift of a sinusoidal function is the horizontal shift of the function from its standard position. In general, the equation for a sinusoidal function can be written as:\n\ny = A sin(Bx - C) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn the given function, y = 2 sin(2x - 3π/2), we can see that:\n\nA = 2 (amplitude)\nB = 2 (frequency)\nC = 3π/2 (phase shift)\nD = 0 (vertical shift)\n\nThe phase shift of the function is C = 3π/2."
