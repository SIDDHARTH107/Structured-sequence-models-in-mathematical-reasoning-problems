    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first need to take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. Recall that the Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx\n\nwhere F(k) is the Fourier transform of f(x) and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nLet Y(k) be the Fourier transform of y(x), then the Fourier transform of y''(x) is given by (2πik)^2 Y(k). So, taking the Fourier transform of both sides of the given differential equation, we get:\n\n(2πik)^2 Y(k) + Y(k) = 4F(sin(3x))\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of 4sin(3x). Using the properties of the Fourier transform, we have:\n\nF(4sin(3x)) = 4F(sin(3x)) = 4[δ(k - 3/2π) - δ(k + 3/2π)]/2i\n\nwhere δ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in terms of Y(k):\n\nY(k)[(2πik)^2 + 1] = 4[δ(k - 3/2π) - δ(k + 3/2π)]/2i\n\nTo find Y(k), we can divide both sides by [(2πik)^2 + 1]:\n\nY(k) = 4[δ(k - 3/2π) - δ(k + 3/2π)]/[(2πik)^2 + 1] * 1/2i\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(k) to get the solution y(x). The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\ny(x) = ∫[Y(k) * e^(2πikx)] dk\n\nPlugging in the expression for Y(k), we get:\n\ny(x) = ∫{4[δ(k - 3/2π) - δ(k + 3/2π)]/[(2πik)^2 + 1] * 1/2i * e^(2πikx)} dk\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral using the properties of the Dirac delta function:\n\ny(x) = 4/2i [e^(3ix)/(9 - 1) - e^(-3ix)/(-9 - 1)]\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\ny(x) = (1/2i) [e^(3ix) - e^(-3ix)]\n\nNow, we can rewrite this expression in terms of sine and cosine functions using Euler's formula:\n\ny(x) = (1/2i) [(cos(3x) + isin(3x)) - (cos(-3x) + isin(-3x))]\n\ny(x) = (1/2i) [2isin(3x)]\n\nFinally, we get the solution:\n\ny(x) = sin(3x)\n\nThis is the solution to the given differential equation with the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0."
