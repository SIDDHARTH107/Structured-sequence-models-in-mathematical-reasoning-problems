    "message_1": "A math student is given a graph G with 11 vertices and 16 edges. The student is asked to determine if the graph G is planar or not. Can the student prove that the graph is planar or can they find a subgraph that is homeomorphic to K_{3,3} or K_5, indicating that the graph is not planar?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is planar or not, we can use Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to K_5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K_{3,3} (complete bipartite graph on two sets of 3 vertices).\n\nFirst, let's check if the graph G violates the necessary conditions for planarity given by Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. For a planar graph, the number of edges E must satisfy the inequality E ≤ 3V - 6.\n\nIn our case, V = 11 and E = 16. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\n16 ≤ 3(11) - 6\n16 ≤ 33 - 6\n16 ≤ 27\n\nSince the inequality holds, it is possible that the graph G is planar, but we still need to check if it contains a subgraph homeomorphic to K_5 or K_{3,3}.\n\nWithout knowing the specific structure of the graph G, we cannot definitively say whether it contains a subgraph homeomorphic to K_5 or K_{3,3}. However, since the graph satisfies the necessary conditions for planarity, it is possible that the graph is planar. The student would need to analyze the specific structure of the graph G to determine if it contains a subgraph homeomorphic to K_5 or K_{3,3}. If they find such a subgraph, then the graph is not planar; otherwise, the graph is planar."
