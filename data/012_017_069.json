    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges in which each vertex of the graph is connected to exactly one other vertex, and no two edges share a vertex. In other words, a perfect matching is a set of disjoint edges that cover all vertices of the graph.\n\nFor a graph with 6 vertices, a perfect matching would consist of 3 disjoint edges, each connecting a pair of vertices. \n\nTo find the number of perfect matchings in a graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Count the number of ways to choose 3 edges from the 9 available edges.\n2. For each combination of 3 edges, check if it forms a perfect matching (i.e., no two edges share a vertex).\n3. Sum up the number of perfect matchings found in step 2.\n\nLet's calculate the number of ways to choose 3 edges from the 9 available edges. This can be done using the binomial coefficient formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, edges), k is the number of items to choose (in this case, 3), and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!(9-3)!) = 9! / (3!6!) = 362880 / (6 * 720) = 84\n\nSo, there are 84 ways to choose 3 edges from the 9 available edges. However, not all of these combinations will form a perfect matching.\n\nTo determine the number of perfect matchings, we need to analyze the structure of the graph. Unfortunately, without knowing the specific connections between the vertices, we cannot provide an exact number of perfect matchings. The number of perfect matchings will depend on the arrangement of the edges in the graph.\n\nIf you provide more information about the graph's structure, we can help you determine the number of perfect matchings."
