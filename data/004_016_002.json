    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the instantaneous rate of change (derivative) at c is equal to the average rate of change over the interval [a, b].\n\nLet f(t) be the position function of the car, where t is the time in hours. We are given that the car travels a distance of 200 km in 2 hours. Therefore, we have:\n\nf(2) - f(0) = 200 km\n\nThe average speed of the car is the total distance traveled divided by the time taken:\n\nAverage speed = (f(2) - f(0)) / (2 - 0) = 200 km / 2 hours = 100 km/h\n\nNow, we need to find a time c in the interval (0, 2) such that the car's instantaneous speed (the derivative of the position function, f'(c)) is equal to its average speed.\n\nBy the Mean Value Theorem, since f(t) is continuous on [0, 2] and differentiable on (0, 2), there exists a time c in the interval (0, 2) such that:\n\nf'(c) = (f(2) - f(0)) / (2 - 0)\n\nf'(c) = 100 km/h\n\nSo, there exists a time c during the 2 hours where the car's instantaneous speed is equal to its average speed of 100 km/h."
