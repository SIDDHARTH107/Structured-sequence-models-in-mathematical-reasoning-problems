    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player A is given $10 and must propose a split to Player B. Player B can either accept or reject the proposal. If Player B accepts, both players receive the proposed split. If Player B rejects, both players receive $0. If Player B is risk-averse, what is the lowest percentage of the split that Player A can propose and still have a greater than 50% chance of Player B accepting the proposal? Assume that Player B's utility function is concave, and that there are only two possible outcomes for Player B: $0 or $x, where $x is the proposed split.",
    "message_2": "To find the lowest percentage of the split that Player A can propose and still have a greater than 50% chance of Player B accepting the proposal, we need to consider Player B's risk aversion and utility function. Since Player B's utility function is concave, they prefer a certain outcome over a risky one with the same expected value. \n\nLet U(x) be Player B's utility function, where x is the amount of money received. Since Player B is risk-averse, U(x) is concave, meaning that U'(x) > 0 and U''(x) < 0. \n\nPlayer B will accept the proposal if their expected utility from accepting the proposal is greater than their expected utility from rejecting it. If Player B accepts the proposal, they receive $x, and their utility is U(x). If Player B rejects the proposal, they receive $0, and their utility is U(0). \n\nTo find the lowest percentage of the split that Player A can propose and still have a greater than 50% chance of Player B accepting the proposal, we need to find the smallest x such that:\n\nU(x) > 0.5 * U(0) + 0.5 * U(10)\n\nSince U(0) = 0 for a risk-averse individual, the inequality simplifies to:\n\nU(x) > 0.5 * U(10)\n\nUnfortunately, without knowing the specific form of Player B's utility function, we cannot solve for the exact value of x. However, we can say that Player A should propose a split that gives Player B an amount x such that their utility from receiving x is greater than half of their utility from receiving the full $10. This will ensure that Player B has a greater than 50% chance of accepting the proposal."
