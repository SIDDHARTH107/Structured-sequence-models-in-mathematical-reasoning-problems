    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian of the algebraic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 12, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. Let F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 7x - 12. Then, we have:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 - 7\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we can form the Jacobian matrix J, which is a 2x2 matrix containing these partial derivatives:\n\nJ = | ∂F/∂x  ∂F/∂y |\n      | -3x^2 - 7  2y  |\n\nThe Jacobian of the algebraic curve is this matrix J."
