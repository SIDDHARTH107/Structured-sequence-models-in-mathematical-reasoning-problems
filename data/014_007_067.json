    "message_1": "A stream cipher generates a pseudorandom keystream using a key and an initialization vector. Suppose a stream cipher uses a 128-bit key, and the initialization vector is 64 bits long. If the keystream generated by the cipher is used to encrypt a message of 1024 bits, how long will the resulting ciphertext be in bits?",
    "message_2": "In a stream cipher, the plaintext message is encrypted by combining it with the keystream using the XOR operation. The length of the ciphertext will be the same as the length of the plaintext message since the XOR operation does not change the length of the data. Therefore, the resulting ciphertext will be 1024 bits long."
