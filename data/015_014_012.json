    "message_2": "To compute the Lyapunov exponent of the Lorenz system, we first need to linearize the system around its fixed points. The fixed points can be found by setting the derivatives equal to zero and solving for x, y, and z:\n\nσ(y - x) = 0,\nx(ρ - z) - y = 0,\nxy - βz = 0.\n\nThere are three fixed points for the given parameter values (σ = 10, β = 8/3, ρ = 28):\n\n1. (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)\n2. (x, y, z) = (sqrt(β(ρ-1)), sqrt(β(ρ-1)), ρ-1) ≈ (8.485, 8.485, 27)\n3. (x, y, z) = (-sqrt(β(ρ-1)), -sqrt(β(ρ-1)), ρ-1) ≈ (-8.485, -8.485, 27)\n\nNow, we linearize the system by computing the Jacobian matrix:\n\nJ(x, y, z) = | -σ    σ    0  |\n             | ρ-z  -1   -x  |\n             |  y    x   -β  |\n\nNext, we evaluate the Jacobian matrix at each fixed point and compute the eigenvalues. The Lyapunov exponent is the maximum real part of the eigenvalues for each fixed point.\n\nFor the fixed point (0, 0, 0), the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(0, 0, 0) = | -10  10   0  |\n             |  28  -1   0  |\n             |  0    0  -8/3|\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are λ1 ≈ -13.86, λ2 ≈ 0.86, and λ3 ≈ -8/3. The maximum real part is λ2 ≈ 0.86.\n\nFor the other two fixed points, the Jacobian matrices are the same, so we only need to compute the eigenvalues once:\n\nJ(±8.485, ±8.485, 27) = | -10  10   0    |\n                         |  1   -1  -8.485|\n                         |  8.485 8.485 -8/3|\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are λ1 ≈ -22.15, λ2 ≈ -1.73, and λ3 ≈ 11.89. The maximum real part is λ3 ≈ 11.89.\n\nThe largest Lyapunov exponent among all fixed points is λ3 ≈ 11.89, which indicates that the Lorenz system with the given initial conditions and parameter values is chaotic."
