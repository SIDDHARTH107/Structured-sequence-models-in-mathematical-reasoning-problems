The cost of constructing each road is given below:\n\nRoad 1: $8, Road 2: $6, Road 3: $10, Road 4: $7, Road 5: $5, Road 6: $9, Road 7: $11, Road 8: $8, Road 9: $3\n\nFind the minimum cost of building a road network that connects all the neighborhoods.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost of building a road network that connects all the neighborhoods, we can use Kruskal's algorithm, which is a minimum spanning tree algorithm. The algorithm works by sorting the roads by their cost and then selecting the roads with the lowest cost that do not form a cycle.\n\nFirst, let's sort the roads by their cost:\n\n1. Road 9: $3\n2. Road 5: $5\n3. Road 2: $6\n4. Road 4: $7\n5. Road 1: $8\n6. Road 8: $8\n7. Road 6: $9\n8. Road 3: $10\n9. Road 7: $11\n\nNow, let's apply Kruskal's algorithm:\n\n1. Select Road 9: $3 (no cycle formed)\n2. Select Road 5: $5 (no cycle formed)\n3. Select Road 2: $6 (no cycle formed)\n4. Select Road 4: $7 (no cycle formed)\n5. Select Road 1: $8 (cycle formed, skip)\n6. Select Road 8: $8 (no cycle formed)\n\nAt this point, all 6 neighborhoods are connected, and we have found the minimum spanning tree.\n\nThe minimum cost of building a road network that connects all the neighborhoods is the sum of the costs of the selected roads: $3 + $5 + $6 + $7 + $8 = $29."
