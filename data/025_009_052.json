    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the subvariety $\\mathcal{M}_3[7]$ of $\\mathcal{M}_3$, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem and the Hurwitz formula.\n\nLet $C$ be a smooth algebraic curve of genus $g=3$ and let $f: C \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$ be a degree $d=7$ map. By the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K-D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$\n\nwhere $D$ is a divisor on $C$, $K$ is the canonical divisor, and $l(D)$ denotes the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles bounded by $D$. Since $f$ is a degree $7$ map, we have $D = 7f^*(\\infty)$, where $\\infty$ is a point in $\\mathbb{P}^1$. Then, $\\deg(D) = 7$.\n\nBy the Hurwitz formula, we have:\n\n$2g(C) - 2 = \\deg(f) (2g(\\mathbb{P}^1) - 2) + \\deg(R)$\n\nwhere $g(C) = 3$, $g(\\mathbb{P}^1) = 0$, $\\deg(f) = 7$, and $R$ is the ramification divisor of $f$. Thus, we get:\n\n$2(3) - 2 = 7(2(0) - 2) + \\deg(R)$\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n$4 = -14 + \\deg(R)$\n\nand we find that $\\deg(R) = 18$. Now, we can compute $l(D)$ and $l(K-D)$ using the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\n$l(D) - l(K-D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g = 7 + 1 - 3 = 5$\n\nSince $l(D) \\geq 1$, we have $l(K-D) \\leq 4$. Now, we can compute the dimension of the space of degree $7$ maps to $\\mathbb{P}^1$:\n\n$\\dim(\\mathcal{M}_3[7]) = l(D) + \\deg(R) - 1 = 5 + 18 - 1 = 22$\n\nSo, the dimension of the subvariety $\\mathcal{M}_3[7]$ of $\\mathcal{M}_3$ consisting of those curves that have a degree $7$ map to $\\mathbb{P}^1$ is 22."
