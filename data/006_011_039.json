    "message_2": "We can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, workers getting injured) in n trials (number of workers)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, a worker getting injured)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of workers)\n- k is the number of successes we want to find the probability for (in this case, 10 workers getting injured)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 200 (number of workers)\n- k = 10 (number of workers we want to get injured)\n- p = 0.05 (probability of a worker getting injured)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(200, 10):\n\nC(200, 10) = 200! / (10!(200-10)!)\nC(200, 10) = 200! / (10!190!)\n\nNow, let's calculate p^k and (1-p)^(n-k):\n\np^k = 0.05^10\n(1-p)^(n-k) = (1-0.05)^(200-10) = 0.95^190\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 10) = C(200, 10) * 0.05^10 * 0.95^190\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 10) â‰ˆ 0.0354\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 10 workers will get injured in a given month is approximately 0.0354 or 3.54%."
