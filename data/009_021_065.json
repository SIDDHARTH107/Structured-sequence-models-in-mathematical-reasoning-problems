    "message_2": "To solve the 2D heat equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution u(x, y, t) can be written as a product of functions of x, y, and t:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the heat equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = k(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²) => X(x)Y(y)∂T(t)/∂t = k(X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t))\n\nNow, divide both sides by u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t):\n\n(1/T(t))∂T(t)/∂t = k(1/X(x))X''(x) + k(1/Y(y))Y''(y)\n\nSince the left side is a function of t only and the right side is a function of x and y only, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ²:\n\n(1/T(t))∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²\n(1/X(x))X''(x) + (1/Y(y))Y''(y) = -λ²/k\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) = -λ²kX(x)\nY''(y) = -λ²kY(y)\n\nThe general solutions for these equations are:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λ√kx) + B*sin(λ√kx)\nY(y) = C*cos(λ√ky) + D*sin(λ√ky)\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = sin(πx)cos(πy):\n\nsin(πx)cos(πy) = (A*cos(λ√kx) + B*sin(λ√kx))(C*cos(λ√ky) + D*sin(λ√ky))\n\nBy comparing the terms, we can see that B = 1, A = C = 0, and λ√k = π. Thus, λ = π/√k.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nX(x) = sin(πx)\nY(y) = cos(πy)\n\nFor the time-dependent part, we have the following ODE:\n\n(1/T(t))∂T(t)/∂t = -λ² => ∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²T(t)\n\nSolving this ODE, we get:\n\nT(t) = E*exp(-λ²t) = E*exp(-(π²/√k)t)\n\nNow, we have:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t) = sin(πx)cos(πy)E*exp(-(π²/√k)t)\n\nSince u(x, y, 0) = sin(πx)cos(πy), we can determine that E = 1. Thus, the temperature distribution u(x, y, t) is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = sin(πx)cos(πy)exp(-(π²/√k)t)\n\nNow, we can find the temperature distribution at time t = 0.1 and k = 1:\n\nu(x, y, 0.1) = sin(πx)cos(πy)exp(-π²(0.1))"
