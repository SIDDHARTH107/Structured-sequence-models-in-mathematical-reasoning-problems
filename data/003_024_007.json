    "message_2": "To calculate the projection of vector v onto vector w using trigonometry, we need to find the angle between the two vectors and the magnitude of vector v. Then, we can use the dot product formula to find the projection.\n\n1. Find the angle between the two vectors:\nFirst, we need to find the dot product of v and w:\nv · w = (-4 * 1) + (3 * 2) = -4 + 6 = 2\n\nNext, find the magnitudes of v and w:\n||v|| = √((-4)^2 + 3^2) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5\n||w|| = √(1^2 + 2^2) = √(1 + 4) = √5\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle between v and w:\ncos(θ) = (v · w) / (||v|| ||w||) = 2 / (5 * √5) = 2 / (5√5)\n\n2. Find the projection of vector v onto vector w:\nThe projection of v onto w is given by the formula:\nproj_w(v) = (v · w) / ||w||^2 * w\n\nWe already found the dot product (v · w) and the magnitude of w (||w||). Now, we just need to plug in the values and find the projection:\n\nproj_w(v) = (2 / (5 * √5)^2) * [1, 2]\nproj_w(v) = (2 / 25) * [1, 2]\nproj_w(v) = [2/25, 4/25]\n\nSo, the projection of vector v onto vector w is [2/25, 4/25]."
