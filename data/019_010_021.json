Consider the formula (x ⊸ y) * x. \n\nIf x = 3 and y = 6, what is the value of the formula?",
    "message_2": "Given the formula (x ⊸ y) * x, where ⊸ represents division and * represents multiplication, we can rewrite the formula as (x/y) * x.\n\nNow, we are given x = 3 and y = 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n(3/6) * 3\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we have:\n\n(1/2) * 3\n\nMultiplying, we get the final value:\n\n1.5"
