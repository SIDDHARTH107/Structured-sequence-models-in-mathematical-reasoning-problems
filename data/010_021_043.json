    "message_1": "Consider a symplectic manifold $(M, \\omega)$ where $M$ has dimension $4$ and $\\omega$ is a non-degenerate two-form. Let $S \\subset M$ be a symplectic submanifold of dimension $2$. \n\nIf we know that $[S]$ is a primitive homology class, i.e., there does not exist any other homology class $[S']$ in $M$ such that $[S] = k[S']$ for some integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, then what is the value of $\\int_S \\omega$?",
    "message_2": "Since $S$ is a symplectic submanifold of dimension $2$, the restriction of the symplectic form $\\omega$ to $S$ is non-degenerate. This means that $\\omega$ is a volume form on $S$. Therefore, the integral $\\int_S \\omega$ computes the symplectic volume of $S$.\n\nNow, since $[S]$ is a primitive homology class, it means that the symplectic volume of $S$ is minimal among all symplectic submanifolds in the same homology class. In particular, this implies that the symplectic volume of $S$ is nonzero, because if it were zero, then any multiple of $S$ would also have zero volume, contradicting the primitivity of $[S]$.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific symplectic manifold $(M, \\omega)$ and the submanifold $S$, we cannot determine the exact value of $\\int_S \\omega$. We can only conclude that it is nonzero."
