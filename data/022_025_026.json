    "message_2": "To find the energy of the first excited state, we can use the energy eigenvalue formula for a quantum harmonic oscillator:\n\n$$E_n = \\hbar\\omega\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $E_n$ is the energy of the $n$-th energy level, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\omega$ is the oscillator frequency, and $n$ is the quantum number of the energy level. For the first excited state, $n = 1$.\n\nGiven the values $\\omega = 2.5$ and $m = 2$, we can plug these into the formula:\n\n$$E_1 = \\hbar(2.5)\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n\nTo find the value of $E_1$, we need to know the value of $\\hbar$. The reduced Planck constant is approximately $\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s}$.\n\n$$E_1 \\approx (1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s})(2.5)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)$$\n\n$$E_1 \\approx 3.962 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J}$$\n\nSo, the energy of the first excited state for a particle in a harmonic oscillator with $\\omega = 2.5$ and $m = 2$ is approximately $3.962 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J}$."
