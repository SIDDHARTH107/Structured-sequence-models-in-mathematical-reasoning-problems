    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal, and its length increases with each iteration. The length of the curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial length) * (sqrt(2))^n\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after 4 iterations. Plugging the values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * (sqrt(2))^4\nLength = 1 * (2^2)\nLength = 1 * 4\nLength = 4 units\n\nSo, the length of the Lévy C curve after 4 iterations is 4 units."
