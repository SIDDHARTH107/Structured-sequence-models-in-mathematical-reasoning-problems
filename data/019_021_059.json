The outcome of the game depends on their choices according to the payoff matrix below:\n\n|   | B1  | B2  | B3  |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| A1  | 8, 5  | 3, 2  | 1, 6  |\n| A2  | 2, 6  | 7, 4  | 4, 2  |\n\nWhat is the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob, assuming they are both rational and play to maximize their payoff? What is the Nash equilibrium for this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the best responses for each player given the other player's strategy. \n\nFor Alice:\n- If Bob chooses B1, Alice should choose A1 (8 > 2).\n- If Bob chooses B2, Alice should choose A2 (7 > 3).\n- If Bob chooses B3, Alice should choose A1 (1 > 4).\n\nFor Bob:\n- If Alice chooses A1, Bob should choose B1 (5 > 2 and 5 > 6).\n- If Alice chooses A2, Bob should choose B2 (6 > 4 and 6 > 2).\n\nNow, we look for the intersection of these best responses to find the Nash equilibrium.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium is (A1, B1), where Alice chooses A1 and Bob chooses B1. In this case, the payoffs are (8, 5) for Alice and Bob, respectively."
