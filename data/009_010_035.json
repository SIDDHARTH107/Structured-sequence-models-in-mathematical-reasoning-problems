    "message_1": "A European call option with a strike price of $100 has a time to maturity of 6 months. The stock price is currently trading at $120 and the risk-free interest rate is 4%. Using the Black-Scholes equation, find the value of the call option.",
    "message_2": "To find the value of the European call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to first calculate the values of d1 and d2, which are given by the following formulas:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + σ²/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nWhere:\nS = current stock price\nK = strike price\nr = risk-free interest rate\nσ = volatility of the stock\nT = time to maturity\n\nHowever, we are not given the value of σ (volatility) in the problem. Without the volatility, we cannot calculate the value of the call option using the Black-Scholes equation. Please provide the volatility of the stock to proceed with the calculation."
