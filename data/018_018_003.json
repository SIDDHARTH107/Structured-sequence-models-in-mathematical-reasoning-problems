    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A△B, is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the two sets minus their intersection.\n\nFirst, let's find the intersection of A and B, which is the set of elements that are common to both A and B:\nA ∩ B = {3}\n\nNow, let's find the union of A and B, which is the set of all elements that are in either A or B:\nA ∪ B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 9}\n\nFinally, let's find the symmetric difference A△B by subtracting the intersection from the union:\nA△B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 9} - {3} = {1, 5, 7, 6, 9}\n\nNow, let's verify that the symmetric difference is commutative, i.e., A△B = B△A.\n\nWe already found A△B = {1, 5, 7, 6, 9}. Now let's find B△A:\n\nB△A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 9} - {3} = {1, 5, 7, 6, 9}\n\nAs we can see, A△B = {1, 5, 7, 6, 9} and B△A = {1, 5, 7, 6, 9}, which means A△B = B△A. Therefore, the symmetric difference is commutative."
