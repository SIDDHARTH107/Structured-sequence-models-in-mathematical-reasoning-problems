The data is as follows:\n\nNumber of Hours Studied (x): 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 4, 6, 5, 3\nGrades Obtained (y): 80, 85, 70, 90, 85, 95, 80, 92, 88, 75\n\nUsing correlation analysis, determine the correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied per day and the grades obtained in tests for these students.",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r) between the number of hours studied per day (x) and the grades obtained in tests (y), we will use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean of x (x̄) and the mean of y (ȳ):\n\nx̄ = (3 + 4 + 2 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 3) / 10 = 45 / 10 = 4.5\nȳ = (80 + 85 + 70 + 90 + 85 + 95 + 80 + 92 + 88 + 75) / 10 = 840 / 10 = 84\n\nNext, we will calculate the values of (xi - x̄), (yi - ȳ), (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ), (xi - x̄)², and (yi - ȳ)² for each data point:\n\n| xi | yi | xi - x̄ | yi - ȳ | (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) | (xi - x̄)² | (yi - ȳ)² |\n|----|----|--------|--------|----------------|-----------|-----------|\n|  3 | 80 |   -1.5 |     -4 |            6   |      2.25 |       16  |\n|  4 | 85 |   -0.5 |      1 |           -0.5 |      0.25 |        1  |\n|  2 | 70 |   -2.5 |    -14 |           35   |      6.25 |      196  |\n|  5 | 90 |    0.5 |      6 |            3   |      0.25 |       36  |\n|  6 | 85 |    1.5 |      1 |            1.5 |      2.25 |        1  |\n|  7 | 95 |    2.5 |     11 |           27.5 |      6.25 |      121  |\n|  4 | 80 |   -0.5 |     -4 |            2   |      0.25 |       16  |\n|  6 | 92 |    1.5 |      8 |           12   |      2.25 |       64  |\n|  5 | 88 |    0.5 |      4 |            2   |      0.25 |       16  |\n|  3 | 75 |   -1.5 |     -9 |           13.5 |      2.25 |       81  |\n\nNow, we will find the sum of the values in the columns (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ), (xi - x̄)², and (yi - ȳ)²:\n\nΣ(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) = 6 - 0.5 + 35 + 3 + 1.5 + 27.5 + 2 + 12 + 2 + 13.5 = 102\nΣ(xi - x̄)² = 2.25 + 0.25 + 6.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 + 6.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 = 22.5\nΣ(yi - ȳ)² = 16 + 1 + 196 + 36 + 1 + 121 + 16 + 64 + 16 + 81 = 548\n\nFinally, we will plug these values into the formula for r:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\nr = 102 / √(22.5 * 548)\nr ≈ 102 / √(12330)\nr ≈ 102 / 111.03\nr ≈ 0.918\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied per day and the grades obtained in tests for these students is approximately 0.918, which indicates a strong positive correlation."
