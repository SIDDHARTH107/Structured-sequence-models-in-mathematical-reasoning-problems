    "message_1": "Two players play the game of matching pennies. Each player simultaneously flips a penny and hides the result. If the pennies match (i.e., both heads or both tails), player 1 gets $1 from player 2. If the pennies do not match, player 2 gets $1 from player 1. \n\nIf player 1 decides to always flip a head, what is the best strategy for player 2? And what is the expected payoff for player 1 and player 2?",
    "message_2": "Since player 1 always flips a head, the best strategy for player 2 is to also always flip a head. This way, player 2 will always match player 1's penny, and player 1 will always win.\n\nThe expected payoff for player 1 is $1 per game, as they will always win. The expected payoff for player 2 is -$1 per game, as they will always lose."
