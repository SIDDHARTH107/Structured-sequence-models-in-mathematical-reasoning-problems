    "message_2": "The natural frequency (f) of a spring-mass system can be found using the formula:\n\nf = (1 / 2π) * √(k / m)\n\nwhere k is the force constant of the spring, and m is the mass of the system.\n\nWe are given the natural frequency (f) as 4 Hz and the mass (m) as 2 kg. We need to find the force constant (k).\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the formula to solve for k:\n\nk = (2πf)² * m\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\nk = (2π * 4)² * 2\n\nk = (8π)² * 2\n\nk = 64π² * 2\n\nk ≈ 401.07 N/m\n\nSo, the force constant of the spring is approximately 401.07 N/m."
