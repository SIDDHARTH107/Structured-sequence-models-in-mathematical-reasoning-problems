    "message_1": "A company has two choices of projects to invest in, Project A and Project B. Project A has a 75% chance of earning a profit of $50,000 and a 25% chance of earning no profit. Project B has a 50% chance of earning a profit of $80,000 and a 50% chance of earning a profit of $20,000. However, the company's employees are considering whether to put in extra effort or not, which would increase the probability of success by 10% for each project. Given this scenario, the employees have an incentive to put in extra effort if the profit-sharing ratio is more than a certain threshold. What is the threshold profit-sharing ratio that the company should set in order to ensure that the employees will put in the extra effort for both projects?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the expected profit for each project without the extra effort:\n\nExpected profit for Project A = (0.75 * $50,000) + (0.25 * $0) = $37,500\nExpected profit for Project B = (0.50 * $80,000) + (0.50 * $20,000) = $50,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected profit for each project with the extra effort:\n\nExpected profit for Project A with extra effort = (0.85 * $50,000) + (0.15 * $0) = $42,500\nExpected profit for Project B with extra effort = (0.60 * $80,000) + (0.40 * $20,000) = $52,000\n\nNow, let's find the difference in expected profit for each project with and without extra effort:\n\nDifference in expected profit for Project A = $42,500 - $37,500 = $5,000\nDifference in expected profit for Project B = $52,000 - $50,000 = $2,000\n\nNow, let's find the threshold profit-sharing ratio for each project. The threshold profit-sharing ratio is the ratio at which the employees' share of the increased profit is equal to or greater than the cost of their extra effort.\n\nLet x be the threshold profit-sharing ratio, and let C be the cost of extra effort for the employees.\n\nFor Project A:\nx * $5,000 >= C\nx >= C / $5,000\n\nFor Project B:\nx * $2,000 >= C\nx >= C / $2,000\n\nSince we want the employees to put in extra effort for both projects, we need to find the maximum of the two threshold ratios:\n\nx >= max(C / $5,000, C / $2,000)\n\nTo ensure that the employees will put in the extra effort for both projects, the company should set the threshold profit-sharing ratio to be equal to or greater than the maximum of the two threshold ratios."
