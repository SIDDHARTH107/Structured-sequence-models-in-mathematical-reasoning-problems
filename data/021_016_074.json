    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can explain the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) method and guide you through the process, but I cannot perform the actual simulation or computation. ACO is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It is used to find approximate solutions to difficult optimization problems.\n\nHere's an outline of the ACO method for this problem:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters: Set the number of ants, the pheromone evaporation rate, and the number of iterations.\n\n2. Generate random initial solutions: Each ant generates a random solution (x, y) within the feasible region defined by the constraints.\n\n3. Evaluate the solutions: Calculate the objective function value f(x) for each solution.\n\n4. Update the pheromone levels: Increase the pheromone levels on the path between the current solution and the best solution found so far. The pheromone levels represent the attractiveness of a particular solution.\n\n5. Evaporate the pheromone: Decrease the pheromone levels on all paths by a certain factor to simulate evaporation.\n\n6. Generate new solutions: Each ant generates a new solution (x, y) based on the updated pheromone levels and the constraints.\n\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 for the specified number of iterations.\n\n8. Identify the best solution: After the final iteration, select the solution with the lowest objective function value as the optimal solution.\n\nTo implement the ACO algorithm, you would need to use a programming language like Python or MATLAB and run the simulation to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the objective function f(x)."
