To find the quadratic residue of 29 modulo 83, we need to find a number x such that x^2 â‰¡ 29 (mod 83).\n\nFirst, let's check if 29 is a quadratic residue modulo 83. We can use the Legendre symbol to do this:\n\n(29/83) = 29^((83-1)/2) (mod 83)\n= 29^41 (mod 83)\n\nWe can use exponentiation by squaring to compute this efficiently:\n\n29^1 (mod 83) = 29\n29^2 (mod 83) = 29 * 29 (mod 83) = 841 (mod 83) = 16\n29^4 (mod 83) = 16 * 16 (mod 83) = 256 (mod 83) = 7\n29^8 (mod 83) = 7 * 7 (mod 83) = 49 (mod 83)\n29^16 (mod 83) = 49 * 49 (mod 83) = 2401 (mod 83) = 56\n29^32 (mod 83) = 56 * 56 (mod 83) = 3136 (mod 83) = 74\n\nNow, we can multiply the necessary powers together:\n\n29^41 (mod 83) = 29^32 * 29^8 * 29^1 (mod 83)\n= 74 * 49 * 29 (mod 83)\n= 105518 (mod 83)\n= 1\n\nSince the Legendre symbol (29/83) is 1, 29 is a quadratic residue modulo 83.\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 29 modulo 83. One way to do this is by using the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm, but for simplicity, we can just try squaring numbers from 1 to 41 (since there are two square roots for each quadratic residue modulo a prime, and they are symmetric around the middle value, which is 42 in this case).\n\nAfter trying different values, we find that:\n\n19^2 (mod 83) = 361 (mod 83) = 29\n\nSo, one of the square roots of 29 modulo 83 is 19. The other square root is the symmetric value around 42, which is:\n\n42 - 19 = 23\n\nThus, the quadratic residues of 29 modulo 83 are 19 and 23."
