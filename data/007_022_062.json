    "message_2": "To find the order of the point P(17, 10) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 11x + 13 over the finite field F_{29}, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that nP = O, where O is the point at infinity (the identity element in the group of points on the elliptic curve).\n\nWe will use the point addition and point doubling formulas for elliptic curves to compute multiples of P until we find the point at infinity.\n\nPoint doubling formula (for 2P):\n- x_{2P} = (3x_P^2 + a) * (2y_P)^(-1) mod p\n- y_{2P} = (x_P - x_{2P}) * (3x_P^2 + a) * (2y_P)^(-1) - y_P mod p\n\nPoint addition formula (for P + Q):\n- x_{P+Q} = (y_Q - y_P) * (x_Q - x_P)^(-1) mod p\n- y_{P+Q} = (y_P - y_{P+Q}) * (x_Q - x_P)^(-1) * (x_{P+Q} - x_P) mod p\n\nHere, a = 11, p = 29, and P = (17, 10).\n\nFirst, we compute 2P:\n- x_{2P} = (3 * 17^2 + 11) * (2 * 10)^(-1) mod 29\n- x_{2P} = (867 + 11) * 20^(-1) mod 29\n- x_{2P} = 878 * 3 mod 29\n- x_{2P} = 2634 mod 29\n- x_{2P} = 5\n\n- y_{2P} = (17 - 5) * (867 + 11) * 20^(-1) - 10 mod 29\n- y_{2P} = 12 * 878 * 3 - 10 mod 29\n- y_{2P} = 31584 - 10 mod 29\n- y_{2P} = 31574 mod 29\n- y_{2P} = 6\n\nSo, 2P = (5, 6).\n\nNext, we compute 3P = P + 2P:\n- x_{3P} = (6 - 10) * (5 - 17)^(-1) mod 29\n- x_{3P} = (-4) * (-12)^(-1) mod 29\n- x_{3P} = (-4) * 12 mod 29\n- x_{3P} = -48 mod 29\n- x_{3P} = 10\n\n- y_{3P} = (10 - 6) * (5 - 17)^(-1) * (10 - 17) mod 29\n- y_{3P} = 4 * (-12)^(-1) * (-7) mod 29\n- y_{3P} = 4 * 12 * (-7) mod 29\n- y_{3P} = -336 mod 29\n- y_{3P} = 3\n\nSo, 3P = (10, 3).\n\nNext, we compute 4P = 2P + 2P:\n- x_{4P} = (6 - 6) * (5 - 5)^(-1) mod 29\nSince the denominator is 0, we have reached the point at infinity (O).\n\nThus, the order of the point P(17, 10) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 11x + 13 over the finite field F_{29} is 4."
