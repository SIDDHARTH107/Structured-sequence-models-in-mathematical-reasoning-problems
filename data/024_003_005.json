    "message_2": "To compute the Gaussian curvature K of the surface z = x² + y² at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface S by the position vector r(u, v) = (u, v, u² + v²). Then, the partial derivatives with respect to u and v are:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u²\nF = r_u • r_v = 2uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v²\n\nNext, we compute the normal vector N to the surface:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (-2u, -2v, 1)\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients by taking the second derivatives of r(u, v) and projecting them onto the normal vector N:\n\nL = N • r_uu = N • (0, 0, 2) = 2\nM = N • r_uv = N • (0, 0, 0) = 0\nN = N • r_vv = N • (0, 0, 2) = 2\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M²) / (EG - F²)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1²) = 5\nF = 2(1)(1) = 2\nG = 1 + 4(1²) = 5\nL = 2\nM = 0\nN = 2\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nK = (2 * 2 - 0²) / (5 * 5 - 2²) = 4 / 21\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature K at the point (1, 1, 2) is 4/21."
