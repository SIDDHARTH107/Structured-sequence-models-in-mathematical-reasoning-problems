    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = 2sin(3t), we will use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over the entire real line.\n\nFor f(t) = 2sin(3t), the Fourier transform is:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[2sin(3t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let:\n\nu = 2sin(3t) => du = 6cos(3t) dt\ndv = e^(-jωt) dt => v = (-1/jω) * e^(-jωt)\n\nNow, using integration by parts:\n\nF(ω) = uv - ∫v du\nF(ω) = [(-2/jω) * sin(3t) * e^(-jωt)] - ∫[(-1/jω) * e^(-jωt) * 6cos(3t) dt]\n\nF(ω) = (-2/jω) * sin(3t) * e^(-jωt) + (6/jω) * ∫[cos(3t) * e^(-jωt) dt]\n\nNow, we need to integrate the remaining integral. We can use integration by parts again:\n\nu = cos(3t) => du = -3sin(3t) dt\ndv = e^(-jωt) dt => v = (-1/jω) * e^(-jωt)\n\nF(ω) = (-2/jω) * sin(3t) * e^(-jωt) + (6/jω) * [(-1/jω) * cos(3t) * e^(-jωt) - ∫[(-1/jω) * e^(-jωt) * (-3sin(3t)) dt]]\n\nF(ω) = (-2/jω) * sin(3t) * e^(-jωt) + (6/j^2ω^2) * cos(3t) * e^(-jωt) + (3/j^2ω^2) * ∫[sin(3t) * e^(-jωt) dt]\n\nNow, we have the same integral as before, but with a constant factor of (3/j^2ω^2). To get rid of the integral, we can move it to the left side of the equation:\n\n(1 - (3/j^2ω^2)) * F(ω) = (-2/jω) * sin(3t) * e^(-jωt) + (6/j^2ω^2) * cos(3t) * e^(-jωt)\n\nNow, divide both sides by (1 - (3/j^2ω^2)):\n\nF(ω) = [(-2/jω) * sin(3t) * e^(-jωt) + (6/j^2ω^2) * cos(3t) * e^(-jωt)] / (1 - (3/j^2ω^2))\n\nNow, we need to find the limits of the integral as t goes from -∞ to +∞. Since sin(3t) and cos(3t) are bounded functions, and e^(-jωt) oscillates between -1 and 1, the limits of the integral will be zero:\n\nF(ω) = [(-2/jω) * 0 + (6/j^2ω^2) * 0] / (1 - (3/j^2ω^2))\nF(ω) = 0\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of f(t) = 2sin(3t) is F(ω) = 0 for all frequencies up to ω = 6."
