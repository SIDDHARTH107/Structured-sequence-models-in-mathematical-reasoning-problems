    "message_2": "To determine the trend in the given set of monthly sales data, we can calculate the average increase in sales per month.\n\n1. Calculate the difference in sales between each consecutive month:\n   Feb - Jan = 12,000 - 10,000 = 2,000\n   Mar - Feb = 14,500 - 12,000 = 2,500\n   Apr - Mar = 13,000 - 14,500 = -1,500\n   May - Apr = 15,000 - 13,000 = 2,000\n   Jun - May = 16,500 - 15,000 = 1,500\n\n2. Calculate the average increase in sales per month:\n   (2,000 + 2,500 - 1,500 + 2,000 + 1,500) / 5 = 6,500 / 5 = 1,300\n\nThe trend in the given set of monthly sales data is an average increase of $1,300 per month."
