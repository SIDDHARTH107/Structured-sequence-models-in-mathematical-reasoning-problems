    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first cross-multiply:\n\n(6x + 3)(2x - 3) = (3x + 2)(x - 2)\n\nNow, we will expand both sides:\n\n12x^2 - 18x + 6x - 9 = 3x^2 - 6x + 2x - 4\n\nNow, we will simplify the equation:\n\n12x^2 - 12x - 9 = 3x^2 - 4x - 4\n\nNow, we will move all the terms to one side:\n\n12x^2 - 3x^2 - 12x + 4x - 9 + 4 = 0\n\n9x^2 - 8x - 5 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. Unfortunately, this equation does not factor easily, so we will use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 9, b = -8, and c = -5:\n\nx = (8 ± √((-8)^2 - 4(9)(-5))) / 2(9)\n\nx = (8 ± √(64 + 180)) / 18\n\nx = (8 ± √244) / 18\n\nx = (8 ± 2√61) / 18\n\nSo, the two possible values for x are:\n\nx = (8 + 2√61) / 18\nx = (8 - 2√61) / 18"
