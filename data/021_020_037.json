    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot execute the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm in real-time. However, I can provide you with a general outline of how to use the ABC algorithm to find the minimum value of the given function f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 12x + 5 over the interval [-2, 4].\n\nThe Artificial Bee Colony algorithm is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. It consists of three main components: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The algorithm starts with an initial population of solutions (food sources) and iteratively updates them to find the best solution.\n\nHere's a general outline of the ABC algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the population of solutions (food sources) randomly within the given interval [-2, 4]. The number of food sources is typically equal to the number of employed bees.\n\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each food source using the objective function f(x).\n\n3. Repeat the following steps until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum number of iterations or minimum error threshold):\n\n   a. Employed bees phase: Each employed bee modifies its current food source (solution) by applying a local search strategy. The new solution is then evaluated, and the bee selects the better solution (either the original or the new one) based on fitness.\n   \n   b. Onlooker bees phase: Onlooker bees probabilistically choose food sources based on their fitness (better solutions have a higher probability of being chosen). Each onlooker bee then modifies the chosen food source using the same local search strategy as employed bees and selects the better solution based on fitness.\n   \n   c. Scout bees phase: If a food source has not been improved for a certain number of iterations (called the \"limit\"), it is abandoned, and a scout bee generates a new random solution within the given interval.\n   \n   d. Update the best solution found so far.\n\n4. Return the best solution found.\n\nTo apply the ABC algorithm to the given function f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 12x + 5, you would need to implement the algorithm in a programming language like Python, MATLAB, or R, and define the objective function and search interval accordingly.\n\nRemember that the ABC algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, so it may not always find the exact global minimum, but it can provide a good approximation in many cases."
