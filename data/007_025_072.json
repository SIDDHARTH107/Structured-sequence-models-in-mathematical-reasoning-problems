    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g is the primitive root, a is Alice's secret number, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret number.\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as K_A = B^a mod p.\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as K_B = A^b mod p.\n5. If the protocol is executed correctly, K_A and K_B should be equal, and this value is the shared secret key.\n\nLet's calculate the shared secret key:\n\n1. A = 2^3 mod 11 = 8 mod 11 = 8\n2. B = 2^4 mod 11 = 16 mod 11 = 5\n3. K_A = 5^3 mod 11 = 125 mod 11 = 4\n4. K_B = 8^4 mod 11 = 4096 mod 11 = 4\n\nSince K_A and K_B are equal, the shared secret key is 4."
