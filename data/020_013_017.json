    "message_2": "Semi-definite programming (SDP) is not the most suitable method for solving this problem, as it involves linear constraints and a linear objective function. Instead, linear programming (LP) would be more appropriate. However, I will provide a solution using LP, and you can compare it with the SDP method if you wish.\n\nTo solve this problem using linear programming, we can rewrite the constraints in the standard form:\n\n1. x1 + x2 ≤ 3\n2. x1 - x2 ≤ 1\n3. x1 ≥ 0\n4. x2 ≥ 0\n5. x1 + 2x2 - 6 ≤ 0\n\nNow, we can set up the LP problem:\n\nMaximize: Z = x1 + x2\n\nSubject to:\n1. x1 + x2 ≤ 3\n2. x1 - x2 ≤ 1\n3. x1 ≥ 0\n4. x2 ≥ 0\n5. x1 + 2x2 ≤ 6\n\nTo solve this LP problem, we can use the graphical method or the simplex method. Using the graphical method, we can plot the constraints and find the feasible region. The feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 2), and (2, 0). Evaluating the objective function Z = x1 + x2 at these vertices, we get:\n\n1. Z(0, 0) = 0\n2. Z(0, 3) = 3\n3. Z(1, 2) = 3\n4. Z(2, 0) = 2\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 3, which occurs at the vertices (0, 3) and (1, 2). Therefore, the optimal solution is either x1 = 0 and x2 = 3 or x1 = 1 and x2 = 2."
