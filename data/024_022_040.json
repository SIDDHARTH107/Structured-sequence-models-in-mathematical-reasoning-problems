    "message_2": "To find all isometries that map the hyperbolic paraboloid given by the equation $z = x^2 - y^2$ to itself, we first need to find the Riemannian metric induced from $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Let $M$ be the hyperbolic paraboloid, and let $\\phi: U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to M$ be a local parametrization of $M$ given by $\\phi(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - v^2)$. Then the induced metric on $M$ is given by the pullback of the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^3$:\n\n$$g = \\phi^*g_{\\mathbb{R}^3} = \\begin{pmatrix} E & F \\\\ F & G \\end{pmatrix},$$\n\nwhere $E = \\langle \\phi_u, \\phi_u \\rangle$, $F = \\langle \\phi_u, \\phi_v \\rangle$, and $G = \\langle \\phi_v, \\phi_v \\rangle$. We have:\n\n$$\\phi_u = (1, 0, 2u), \\quad \\phi_v = (0, 1, -2v).$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$E = \\langle \\phi_u, \\phi_u \\rangle = 1 + 4u^2, \\quad F = \\langle \\phi_u, \\phi_v \\rangle = -4uv, \\quad G = \\langle \\phi_v, \\phi_v \\rangle = 1 + 4v^2.$$\n\nNow, let $f: M \\to M$ be an isometry. We want to find all possible forms of $f$. Since $f$ is an isometry, it must preserve the Riemannian metric, i.e., $f^*g = g$. Let $f(p) = (x', y', z')$, where $p = (x, y, z) \\in M$. Then we have:\n\n$$z' = x'^2 - y'^2 = (x')^2 - (y')^2.$$\n\nSince $f$ is an isometry, it must preserve the Euclidean distance between points in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, $f$ must be a composition of translations, rotations, and reflections. Let's consider each case:\n\n1. Translations: If $f$ is a translation, then $f(p) = p + (a, b, c)$ for some constants $a, b, c$. However, this would imply that $z + c = (x + a)^2 - (y + b)^2$, which is not of the form $z = x^2 - y^2$. Thus, there are no translations that map the hyperbolic paraboloid to itself.\n\n2. Rotations: If $f$ is a rotation, then $f(p) = Rp$ for some orthogonal matrix $R$. Since the hyperbolic paraboloid is symmetric with respect to the $z$-axis, we can consider rotations around the $z$-axis by an angle $\\theta$. In this case, $f(p) = (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta, x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta, z)$. This transformation preserves the equation $z = x^2 - y^2$.\n\n3. Reflections: If $f$ is a reflection, then $f(p) = Sp$ for some diagonal matrix $S = \\text{diag}(s_1, s_2, s_3)$ with $s_i = \\pm 1$. We can consider the following reflections:\n\n   a. Reflection through the $xz$-plane: $f(p) = (x, -y, z)$. This transformation preserves the equation $z = x^2 - y^2$.\n   \n   b. Reflection through the $yz$-plane: $f(p) = (-x, y, z)$. This transformation preserves the equation $z = x^2 - y^2$.\n   \n   c. Reflection through the $xy$-plane: $f(p) = (x, y, -z)$. This transformation does not preserve the equation $z = x^2 - y^2$.\n\nIn summary, the isometries that map the hyperbolic paraboloid $z = x^2 - y^2$ to itself are rotations around the $z$-axis and reflections through the $xz$- and $yz$-planes."
