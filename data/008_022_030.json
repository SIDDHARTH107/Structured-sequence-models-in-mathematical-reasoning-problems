    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n[2  1 | 5]\n[1  1 | 3]\n\nNext, we want to eliminate the x term in the second row. To do this, we can subtract half of the first row from the second row:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - (1/2) * Row1\n\nThis gives us the new augmented matrix:\n\n[2  1 | 5]\n[0  1/2 | 1/2]\n\nNow, we can read the second equation as:\n\n(1/2)y = 1/2\n\nTo solve for y, we multiply both sides by 2:\n\ny = 1\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the first equation:\n\n2x + y = 5\n2x + 1 = 5\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n2x = 4\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2 and y = 1."
