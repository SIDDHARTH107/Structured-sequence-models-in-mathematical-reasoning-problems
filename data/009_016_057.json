(Note: You can use Laplace's equation and the method of separation of variables to solve this problem.)",
    "message_2": "To find the electric potential V at point P located 0.05 m from the rod, we need to use the formula for the electric potential due to a continuous charge distribution. For a charged rod with linear charge density λ, the electric potential at a distance r from the rod can be given by:\n\nV(r) = ∫(k * λ * ds) / r\n\nwhere k is the electrostatic constant (8.99 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2), λ is the linear charge density (10 * 10^-9 C/m), ds is an infinitesimal segment of the rod, and r is the distance from the rod to point P (0.05 m).\n\nLet's consider the rod to be lying along the x-axis, with one end at x = 0 and the other end at x = 0.1 m. We can choose a small segment of length dx at a distance x from the origin. The distance r from the segment to point P can be given by:\n\nr = √(x^2 + 0.05^2)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nV(0.05) = ∫(k * λ * dx) / √(x^2 + 0.05^2)\n\nThe limits of integration are from 0 to 0.1 m:\n\nV(0.05) = ∫(8.99 * 10^9 * 10 * 10^-9 dx) / √(x^2 + 0.05^2) from 0 to 0.1\n\nV(0.05) = 89.9 * ∫(dx) / √(x^2 + 0.05^2) from 0 to 0.1\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let x = 0.05 * sinh(u), so dx = 0.05 * cosh(u) du. The limits of integration will change accordingly:\n\nx = 0 => u = 0\nx = 0.1 => u = asinh(0.1/0.05) = asinh(2)\n\nNow, the integral becomes:\n\nV(0.05) = 89.9 * ∫(0.05 * cosh(u) du) / √(0.05^2 * (sinh^2(u) + 1)) from 0 to asinh(2)\n\nV(0.05) = 89.9 * ∫(cosh(u) du) from 0 to asinh(2)\n\nNow, we can integrate cosh(u) with respect to u:\n\nV(0.05) = 89.9 * [sinh(u)] from 0 to asinh(2)\n\nV(0.05) = 89.9 * (sinh(asinh(2)) - sinh(0))\n\nV(0.05) = 89.9 * (2 - 0)\n\nV(0.05) = 179.8 V\n\nSo, the electric potential V at point P located 0.05 m from the rod is 179.8 V."
