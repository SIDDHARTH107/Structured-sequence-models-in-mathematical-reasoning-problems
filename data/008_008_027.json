    "message_1": "A bakery produces two types of cakes: chocolate cakes and vanilla cakes. Each chocolate cake requires 3 cups of flour, 2 cups of sugar, and 1 cup of butter. Each vanilla cake requires 2 cups of flour, 3 cups of sugar, and 1 cup of butter. The bakery has 180 cups of flour, 150 cups of sugar, and 80 cups of butter available. \n\nIf the profit for each chocolate cake sold is $20, and the profit for each vanilla cake sold is $30, how many of each cake should the bakery produce to maximize its profit?",
