    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the first cohomology group H^1(X,Q) of X with coefficients in Q, we can use the genus-degree formula for algebraic curves. The genus-degree formula relates the genus g of a curve to the degree d of the curve as follows:\n\ng = (d-1)(d-2)/2\n\nThe given equation y^2 = x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4 is a cubic equation (degree 3) in x. Therefore, d = 3.\n\nNow, we can plug d into the genus-degree formula:\n\ng = (3-1)(3-2)/2 = 2*1/2 = 1\n\nSo, the genus of the curve X is 1.\n\nFor an algebraic curve over the field of rational numbers Q, the dimension of the first cohomology group H^1(X,Q) is equal to twice the genus of the curve:\n\ndim H^1(X,Q) = 2g = 2*1 = 2\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the first cohomology group H^1(X,Q) of X with coefficients in Q is 2."
