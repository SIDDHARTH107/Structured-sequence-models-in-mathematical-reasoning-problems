    "message_2": "In a non-abelian group of order 32, the possible numbers of elements of order 2 are 1, 15, and 31.\n\nAn example of such a group is the dihedral group D_16, which is the group of symmetries of a regular 16-gon. It has 32 elements, with 16 rotations and 16 reflections. The rotations form a cyclic subgroup of order 16, and the reflections are the elements of order 2.\n\nThe elements of order 2 in D_16 are the 15 reflections and the rotation by 180 degrees. We can represent the elements of D_16 as pairs (r, s), where r is a rotation and s is a reflection. The identity element is (0, 0), and the rotation by 180 degrees is (8, 0). The reflections can be represented as (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), ..., (14, 1), (15, 1).\n\nSo, the elements of order 2 in D_16 are:\n\n(8, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (10, 1), (11, 1), (12, 1), (13, 1), (14, 1), and (15, 1)."
