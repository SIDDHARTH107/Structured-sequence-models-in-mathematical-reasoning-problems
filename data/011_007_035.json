    "message_1": "A small company has 5 employees, and they want to distribute 8 different tasks among themselves such that each employee gets at least 1 task. In how many ways can this be done?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. First, we need to find the total number of ways to distribute the tasks without any restrictions. Then, we will subtract the number of ways where at least one employee doesn't get a task.\n\n1. Total number of ways to distribute the tasks without any restrictions:\nWe can use the stars and bars method here. We have 8 tasks (stars) and 4 separators (bars) to divide them among 5 employees. So, the total number of ways is C(12, 4), where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12-4)!) = 495\n\n2. Number of ways where at least one employee doesn't get a task:\nWe can use the complementary principle here. We will find the number of ways to distribute the tasks among 4 employees, and then subtract it from the total number of ways found in step 1.\n\nUsing the stars and bars method again, we have 8 tasks (stars) and 3 separators (bars) to divide them among 4 employees. So, the total number of ways is C(11, 3).\n\nC(11, 3) = 11! / (3! * (11-3)!) = 165\n\n3. Final answer:\nNow, we will subtract the number of ways found in step 2 from the total number of ways found in step 1.\n\n495 - 165 = 330\n\nSo, there are 330 ways to distribute the 8 tasks among the 5 employees such that each employee gets at least 1 task."
