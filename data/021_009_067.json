    "message_2": "To use the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. This will give us the gradient or slope of the function at any given point x.\n\nf(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 5\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2 - 4x + 5)/dx = 4x - 4\n\nNow, we will perform 10 iterations of the gradient descent method, starting from x = 1 and taking a step size of 0.1.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = x0 - step_size * f'(x0)\nx1 = 1 - 0.1 * (4 * 1 - 4)\nx1 = 1 - 0.1 * 0\nx1 = 1\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = x1 - step_size * f'(x1)\nx2 = 1 - 0.1 * (4 * 1 - 4)\nx2 = 1 - 0.1 * 0\nx2 = 1\n\nSince the value of x is not changing after the first iteration, it means that we have reached the minimum value of the function. This is because the gradient (derivative) at x = 1 is 0, which indicates a minimum or maximum point. In this case, it's a minimum because the coefficient of the x^2 term is positive.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of the function f(x) at x = 1:\n\nf(1) = 2 * (1)^2 - 4 * (1) + 5\nf(1) = 2 - 4 + 5\nf(1) = 3\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 5 is 3, which occurs at x = 1."
