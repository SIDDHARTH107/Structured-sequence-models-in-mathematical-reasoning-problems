    "message_2": "The length of the Hilbert curve increases with each iteration. In each iteration, the number of segments increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is divided by 2.\n\nSo, for the 5th iteration, the length of the Hilbert curve can be calculated as follows:\n\nLength = (Number of segments in the 5th iteration) * (Length of each segment in the 5th iteration)\n\nNumber of segments in the 5th iteration = 4^5 = 1024\nLength of each segment in the 5th iteration = 1 / (2^4) = 1/16\n\nLength = 1024 * (1/16) = 64\n\nThe length of the 5th iteration of the Hilbert curve is 64."
