    "message_1": "A math teacher conducted a survey on a group of 100 students to determine how many of them like calculus. Out of the first 50 surveyed, 40 students liked calculus. Out of the next 30 students surveyed, 20 students liked calculus. What is the probability that the next student surveyed will like calculus, if the teacher follows the same survey pattern?",
    "message_2": "To determine the probability that the next student surveyed will like calculus, we can look at the pattern of the previous surveys. \n\nOut of the first 50 students, 40 liked calculus, which is a 40/50 = 4/5 = 80% probability.\nOut of the next 30 students, 20 liked calculus, which is a 20/30 = 2/3 â‰ˆ 66.67% probability.\n\nSince the teacher is following the same survey pattern, we can assume that the probability for the next student will be somewhere between 80% and 66.67%. However, we cannot determine the exact probability without more information about the survey pattern or the overall preferences of the students."
