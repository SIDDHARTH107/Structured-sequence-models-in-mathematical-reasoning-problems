    "message_1": "In a group of 5 volunteers, each has the choice to either donate $10 or not donate anything for a charity fundraiser. If at least 3 volunteers donate, the charity receives a total of $80. However, if fewer than 3 volunteers donate, the charity receives nothing. What is the best strategy for the volunteers to maximize the amount of money donated to the charity?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the amount of money donated to the charity, the volunteers should aim to have at least 3 of them donate $10 each. This way, the charity is guaranteed to receive the $80. \n\nHere are the possible scenarios:\n\n1. All 5 volunteers donate $10 each: The charity receives $80.\n2. 4 volunteers donate $10 each: The charity receives $80.\n3. 3 volunteers donate $10 each: The charity receives $80.\n4. 2 volunteers donate $10 each: The charity receives nothing.\n5. 1 volunteer donates $10: The charity receives nothing.\n6. No volunteers donate: The charity receives nothing.\n\nThe best strategy for the volunteers is to coordinate and ensure that at least 3 of them donate $10 each. They can do this by discussing and agreeing on who will donate before making their decision. This way, they can maximize the amount of money donated to the charity while minimizing the individual financial burden."
