    "message_2": "To find the total length of the Koch island after four iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal length = Initial length × (Length increase factor) ^ Number of iterations\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, the length increase factor is 4/3, and the number of iterations is 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nTotal length = 1 × (4/3) ^ 4\nTotal length = 1 × (256/81)\nTotal length = 256/81 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Koch island after four iterations is 256/81 units."
