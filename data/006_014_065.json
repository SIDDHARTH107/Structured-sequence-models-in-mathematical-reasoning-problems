    "message_2": "To find the probability of having at least one failure in the system during a day, we can first find the probability of having no failures and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a single component not failing during a day is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nSince there are 5 components, the probability of all components not failing during a day is (0.98)^5.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least one failure by subtracting the probability of no failures from 1:\n\nProbability of at least one failure = 1 - (0.98)^5 ≈ 1 - 0.9039207968 ≈ 0.0960792032.\n\nSo, the probability of having at least one failure in the system during a day is approximately 9.61%."
