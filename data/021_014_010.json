    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The profit per unit for Product A is $5 and for Product B is $8. The production process requires two machines, Machine X and Machine Y, and each product requires a different amount of time on each machine. Product A requires 3 hours on Machine X and 1 hour on Machine Y, while Product B requires 2 hours on Machine X and 2 hours on Machine Y. \n\nThe company has a total of 300 hours per week available on Machine X and 180 hours per week available on Machine Y. Determine the number of units of Product A and Product B the company should produce each week in order to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the machines' available hours are:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 300 (Machine X)\nx + 2y ≤ 180 (Machine Y)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 5x + 8y\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\nFrom Machine X constraint:\ny ≤ (300 - 3x)/2\n\nFrom Machine Y constraint:\ny ≤ (180 - x)/2\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by plotting these inequalities on a graph. The feasible region will be the area where both inequalities are satisfied.\n\nNext, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region, which are the points where the constraint lines intersect. These vertices are the potential solutions for the problem.\n\nThe vertices are:\n(0, 0), (0, 90), (60, 60), and (100, 0)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function P = 5x + 8y at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0\nP(0, 90) = 5(0) + 8(90) = 720\nP(60, 60) = 5(60) + 8(60) = 780\nP(100, 0) = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (60, 60), with a profit of $780.\n\nTherefore, the company should produce 60 units of Product A and 60 units of Product B each week to maximize its profit."
