    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we'll first rewrite the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  1  1 |      x = | x |      b = |  6  |\n    | 2  3  4 |          | y |          | 20  |\n    | 4  5  6 |          | z |          | 36  |\n\nNow, we'll perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we'll decompose A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and the upper triangular matrix R.\n\nFirst, we'll find the orthonormal basis for the column space of A:\n\nu1 = a1 = (1, 2, 4)\ne1 = u1/||u1|| = (1/√21, 2/√21, 4/√21)\n\nu2 = a2 - (a2·e1)e1 = (1, 3, 5) - (26/21)(1/√21, 2/√21, 4/√21) = (-1/3, 1/3, 2/3)\ne2 = u2/||u2|| = (-1/√6, 1/√6, 2/√6)\n\nu3 = a3 - (a3·e1)e1 - (a3·e2)e2 = (1, 4, 6) - (36/21)(1/√21, 2/√21, 4/√21) - (12/6)(-1/√6, 1/√6, 2/√6) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nSince u3 is the zero vector, we have a dependent column, and the system has infinitely many solutions. However, we can still find a particular solution by ignoring the dependent column and solving the reduced system.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nQ = | 1/√21  -1/√6 |\n    | 2/√21   1/√6 |\n    | 4/√21   2/√6 |\n\nR = | √21  26/21 |\n    |  0    2/√6  |\n\nNow, we'll solve Rx = Q^Tb:\n\nQ^Tb = | 1/√21  2/√21  4/√21 | |  6  | = |  6√21/21  |\n       |-1/√6   1/√6  2/√6  | | 20  |   |  8/√6     |\n                              | 36  |\n\nNow, we have a 2x2 system:\n\n√21 * x1 + 26/21 * x2 = 6√21/21\n-1/√6 * x1 + 2/√6 * x2 = 8/√6\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx1 = 1\nx2 = 2\n\nSince the third column was dependent, we can set x3 to any value, and the system will still hold. So, we have infinitely many solutions of the form:\n\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 3 - x - y = 3 - 1 - 2 = 0 + t, where t is any real number."
