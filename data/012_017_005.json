    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex, and no two edges share a vertex. In other words, a perfect matching is a way to pair up the vertices such that each pair is connected by an edge.\n\nFor a graph with 8 vertices, we need to find the number of ways to pair up the vertices. This can be calculated using the double factorial function, which is defined as the product of all the integers from 1 to n with the same parity as n. For even numbers, the double factorial is denoted as n!! = n(n-2)(n-4)...(4)(2).\n\nSo, for a graph with 8 vertices, the number of perfect matchings can be calculated as:\n\n8!! = 8 × 6 × 4 × 2 = 384\n\nHowever, this assumes that there is an edge between every pair of vertices, which might not be the case in a general graph. The actual number of perfect matchings depends on the specific structure of the graph and its edges. If you have more information about the graph, you can use that to determine the number of perfect matchings."
