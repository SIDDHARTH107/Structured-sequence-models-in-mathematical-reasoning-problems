    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a hyperbolic triangle is determined by its angles. The formula for the area of a hyperbolic triangle is given by:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nwhere α, β, and γ are the angles of the triangle.\n\nGiven the angles of the triangle are 60 degrees, 70 degrees, and 50 degrees, we first need to convert these angles to radians:\n\nα = 60 degrees = (60 * π) / 180 = π/3 radians\nβ = 70 degrees = (70 * π) / 180 = 7π/18 radians\nγ = 50 degrees = (50 * π) / 180 = 5π/18 radians\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = π - (π/3 + 7π/18 + 5π/18)\nArea = π - (6π/18 + 7π/18 + 5π/18)\nArea = π - (18π/18)\nArea = π - π\nArea = 0\n\nThe area of this hyperbolic triangle is 0. However, this result is contradictory to the hyperbolic geometry, as the sum of the angles in a hyperbolic triangle must be less than 180 degrees (π radians). The given angles (60, 70, and 50 degrees) sum up to 180 degrees, which is not possible for a hyperbolic triangle. Therefore, the problem statement is incorrect, and the triangle cannot exist in hyperbolic geometry."
