    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a person having a certain medical condition is 0.15. If a sample of 300 people is taken, what is the expected number of people who have the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of people with the medical condition in a sample of 300 people, we can use the formula:\n\nExpected number = Probability of having the condition × Sample size\n\nIn this case, the probability of having the condition is 0.15 and the sample size is 300. So, we can calculate the expected number as follows:\n\nExpected number = 0.15 × 300 = 45\n\nTherefore, the expected number of people with the medical condition in a sample of 300 people is 45."
