    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold makes a 90-degree angle. The perimeter of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nAfter each iteration, the number of segments in the curve doubles, and the length of each segment is divided by the square root of 2. So, after 10 iterations, there will be 2^10 = 1024 segments, and the length of each segment will be 1/(sqrt(2))^10 = 1/(2^5) = 1/32 units.\n\nThe perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after 10 iterations is the product of the number of segments and the length of each segment:\n\nPerimeter = 1024 * (1/32) = 32 units."
