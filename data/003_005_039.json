    "message_2": "To find the principal value of arccos(-0.5), we need to find the angle whose cosine is -0.5.\n\nIn radians, this angle is 2π/3 or 120° in degrees. This is because the cosine of 2π/3 (or 120°) is -0.5, and it lies in the principal value range of arccos, which is [0, π] in radians or [0°, 180°] in degrees.\n\nSo, the principal value of arccos(-0.5) is 2π/3 radians or 120°."
