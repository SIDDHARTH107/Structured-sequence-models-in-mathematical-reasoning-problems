    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the fact that a topological space X with topology T satisfying the T4 separation axiom, also known as a normal space, has the property that for any two disjoint closed sets A and B in X, there exist disjoint open sets U and V containing A and B, respectively.\n\nSince X is a normal space and A and B are disjoint closed sets, by the definition of normality, there exist open sets U and V in the topology T such that A ⊆ U, B ⊆ V, and U ∩ V = ∅.\n\nThus, we have found two disjoint open sets U and V containing A and B, respectively, as required."
