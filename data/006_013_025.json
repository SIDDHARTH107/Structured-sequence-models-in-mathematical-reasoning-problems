    "message_2": "Let X be the number of floods in the next 5 years. Since the occurrence of floods is a Poisson process with a constant rate of arrival, we can model X as a Poisson random variable with parameter λ = 3 floods/year * 5 years = 15 floods.\n\nWe want to find the probability P(X ≥ 10). To do this, we can use the complement rule: P(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9).\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of a Poisson random variable is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), λ is the average number of events (in this case, floods), and k is the number of events we are interested in.\n\nUsing the PMF, we can find the probability P(X ≤ 9) by summing the probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 9:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 9\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9)\n\nNow, we can calculate the individual probabilities using the PMF formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-15) * 15^0) / 0! = e^(-15)\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-15) * 15^1) / 1! = 15 * e^(-15)\nP(X = 2) = (e^(-15) * 15^2) / 2! = (225/2) * e^(-15)\n...\nP(X = 9) = (e^(-15) * 15^9) / 9! = (15^9 / 362880) * e^(-15)\n\nNow, sum up these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = e^(-15) + 15 * e^(-15) + (225/2) * e^(-15) + ... + (15^9 / 362880) * e^(-15)\n\nFinally, use the complement rule to find the probability P(X ≥ 10):\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9) = 1 - [e^(-15) + 15 * e^(-15) + (225/2) * e^(-15) + ... + (15^9 / 362880) * e^(-15)]\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum and the final probability, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) ≈ 0.9512\n\nSo, the probability that there will be at least 10 floods in the region in the next 5 years is approximately 0.9512 or 95.12%."
