    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two curves defined by polynomials f(x, y) and g(x, y) is equal to the product of the degrees of the two polynomials, assuming that the intersection points are finite and counted with their multiplicities.\n\nIn this case, we have f(x) and g(x) as given. To apply Bezout's theorem, we need to express them as bivariate polynomials f(x, y) and g(x, y). We can do this by setting y = f(x) and y = g(x) and then rearranging the equations to have y on one side:\n\nf(x, y) = y - x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x - 2\ng(x, y) = y - 2x^3 + x^2 - 4x + 1\n\nNow we have two bivariate polynomials. The degree of f(x, y) is 3 (from the x^3 term) and the degree of g(x, y) is also 3 (from the 2x^3 term). According to Bezout's theorem, the number of intersection points is the product of the degrees, which is 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 intersection points of the curves defined by f(x) and g(x) in the plane, counted with their multiplicities."
