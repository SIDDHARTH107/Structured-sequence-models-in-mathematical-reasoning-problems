    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  2  3 |  6 ]\n[ 4 -5  6 | -3 ]\n[ 7  8 -9 | 12 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row:\n```\n[ 1  2  3 |  6 ]\n[ 0 -13 -6 | -27 ]\n[ 7  8 -9 | 12 ]\n```\n\n2. Subtract 7 times the first row from the third row:\n```\n[ 1  2  3 |  6 ]\n[ 0 -13 -6 | -27 ]\n[ 0 -6 -30 | -30 ]\n```\n\n3. Divide the second row by -13:\n```\n[ 1  2  3 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1  6/13 | 27/13 ]\n[ 0 -6 -30 | -30 ]\n```\n\n4. Add 6 times the second row to the third row:\n```\n[ 1  2  3 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1  6/13 | 27/13 ]\n[ 0  0 -12 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. Divide the third row by -12:\n```\n[ 1  2  3 |  6 ]\n[ 0  1  6/13 | 27/13 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 0.\n\n2. Substitute z into the second row and solve for y:\n```\ny + 6/13(0) = 27/13\ny = 27/13\n```\n\n3. Substitute y and z into the first row and solve for x:\n```\nx + 2(27/13) + 3(0) = 6\nx = 6 - 54/13\nx = 78/13 - 54/13\nx = 24/13\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 24/13, y = 27/13, and z = 0."
