    "message_2": "To determine the degree and genus of the curve $C$, we first need to find a homogeneous polynomial equation that describes the curve in the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2$. We can do this by eliminating the parameter $t$ from the parametric representation of the curve.\n\nThe parametric representation of the curve is given by $C(t) = [t^3, t^2, t]$. We can write this in terms of homogeneous coordinates $[X:Y:Z]$ as follows:\n\n$$X = t^3, \\quad Y = t^2, \\quad Z = t.$$\n\nNow, we can eliminate the parameter $t$ by expressing it in terms of the other variables. From the third equation, we have:\n\n$$t = Z.$$\n\nSubstituting this into the first two equations, we get:\n\n$$X = Z^3, \\quad Y = Z^2.$$\n\nNow, we can write a homogeneous polynomial equation for the curve:\n\n$$X - Z^3 = 0.$$\n\nThe degree of the curve is the highest degree of the polynomial equation, which in this case is 3. \n\nTo find the genus of the curve, we can use the formula for a plane curve:\n\n$$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2},$$\n\nwhere $g$ is the genus and $d$ is the degree of the curve. In this case, $d = 3$, so we have:\n\n$$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1.$$\n\nTherefore, the degree of the curve $C$ is 3 and its genus is 1."
