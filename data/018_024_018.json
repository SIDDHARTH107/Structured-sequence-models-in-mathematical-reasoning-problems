    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nA △ B = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and A △ B. The complement of a set is the set of elements not in the given set. For this problem, we need to know the universal set U. Since it's not given, let's assume U contains all the elements in A and B.\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n(A △ B)' = U - (A △ B) = {2, 3, 4}\nA' = U - A = {5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A △ B)' and A':\n\n((A △ B)' △ A') = ({2, 3, 4} △ {5})\n\n((A △ B)' △ A') = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is distributive over complement. If it is distributive, then the following equation should hold:\n\n(A △ B)' △ A' = (A' △ B') △ (A' △ B)\n\nWe already found (A △ B)' △ A' = {2, 3, 4, 5}. Now let's find A' △ B', A' △ B, and their symmetric difference:\n\nA' = {5}\nB' = U - B = {1}\n\nA' △ B' = {1, 5}\nA' △ B = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A' △ B') and (A' △ B):\n\n(A' △ B') △ (A' △ B) = ({1, 5} △ {2, 3, 4, 5}) = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nSince (A △ B)' △ A' ≠ (A' △ B') △ (A' △ B), the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement."
