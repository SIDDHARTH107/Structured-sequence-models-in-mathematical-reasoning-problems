    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of a storm occurring on a specific day in a particular region is 0.4. If there are 30 days in a month, what is the probability that there will be at least 8 days with storms during that month?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 8 days with storms, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (storms) in n trials (days)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (storm) on a single trial (day)\n- n is the number of trials (days)\n- k is the number of successes (storms)\n\nIn this case, n = 30 (days in a month), p = 0.4 (probability of a storm on a specific day), and we want to find the probability of at least 8 days with storms, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 8 to k = 30.\n\nP(X >= 8) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 8 to 30\n\nP(X >= 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + ... + P(X = 30)\n\nWe can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 8) ≈ 0.0013 + 0.0039 + 0.0095 + ... + 0.0000 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nP(X >= 8) ≈ 0.9668\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 8 days with storms during the month is approximately 0.9668 or 96.68%."
