    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A×B. The Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA×B = {(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and B, denoted as A∩B. The intersection is the set of elements that are common to both A and B.\n\nA∩B = {} (empty set, since there are no common elements)\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of B and C, denoted as B∩C.\n\nB∩C = {3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and (B∩C), denoted as A×(B∩C).\n\nA×(B∩C) = {(2,3), (4,3)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A and C, denoted as A×C.\n\nA×C = {(2,2), (2,3), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A×B) and (A×C), denoted as (A×B) ∩ (A×C).\n\n(A×B) ∩ (A×C) = {(2,3), (4,3)}\n\nWe can see that A×(B∩C) = {(2,3), (4,3)} and (A×B) ∩ (A×C) = {(2,3), (4,3)}.
