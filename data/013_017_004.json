    "message_1": "A used car dealer has two cars for sale. Car A is a 2010 model with 80,000 miles that he bought for $5,000. Car B is a 2015 model with 20,000 miles that he bought for $10,000. However, the dealer knows that Car A has a mechanical issue that will cost $1,000 to fix, and he is offering both cars for sale for $9,000 each.\n\nAssuming that a buyer does not know which car has the issue, and they are willing to pay $8,000 for a car with zero mechanical issues, what is the probability that a buyer will choose Car A instead of Car B?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a buyer will choose Car A instead of Car B, we need to consider the possible outcomes and the likelihood of each outcome.\n\nThere are two possible outcomes: the buyer chooses Car A or the buyer chooses Car B. Since the buyer does not know which car has the mechanical issue, they are equally likely to choose either car. Therefore, the probability of choosing Car A is 1/2, and the probability of choosing Car B is also 1/2.\n\nSo, the probability that a buyer will choose Car A instead of Car B is 1/2 or 50%."
