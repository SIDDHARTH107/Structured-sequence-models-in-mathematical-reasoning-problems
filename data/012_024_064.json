    "message_2": "The genus of a graph is the minimum number of handles required on a surface to embed the graph without any edge crossings. To find the genus of a complete graph K_n, we can use the formula:\n\ng = (m - 3n + 6) / 6\n\nwhere g is the genus, n is the number of vertices, and m is the number of edges in the graph.\n\nFor a complete graph K_6, there are 6 vertices and 15 edges (since m = n(n-1)/2). Plugging these values into the formula:\n\ng = (15 - 3*6 + 6) / 6\ng = (15 - 18 + 6) / 6\ng = 3 / 6\ng = 0.5\n\nHowever, the genus must be an integer, so we round up to the nearest integer:\n\ng = 1\n\nSo, the genus of a complete graph K_6 is 1."
