    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 3sin(2x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = 3sin(2x)\ndy/dx = d(3sin(2x))/dx\n\nThe outer function is 3 times the sine of something, and the inner function is 2x. \n\nThe derivative of the outer function (3sin(u)) with respect to u is 3cos(u), and the derivative of the inner function (2x) with respect to x is 2.\n\nNow, we'll apply the chain rule:\n\ndy/dx = (3cos(u)) * (2)\ndy/dx = 6cos(2x)\n\nNow we need to find the value of the derivative at x = pi/6:\n\ndy/dx = 6cos(2(pi/6))\ndy/dx = 6cos(pi/3)\n\ncos(pi/3) = 1/2, so:\n\ndy/dx = 6(1/2)\ndy/dx = 3\n\nThe value of the derivative at x = pi/6 is 3."
