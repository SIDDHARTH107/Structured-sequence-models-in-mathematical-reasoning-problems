    "message_2": "The area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * π * (1 - 1/4)^2\n\nArea ≈ (1/2) * π * (3/4)^2\n\nArea ≈ (1/2) * π * (9/16)\n\nArea ≈ (9/32) * π\n\nArea ≈ 0.88357 * π\n\nArea ≈ 2.775\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is approximately 2.78 (rounded to the nearest hundredth)."
