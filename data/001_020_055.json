    "message_2": "To solve the equation |3x + 5| - 2 = 7, first add 2 to both sides of the equation:\n\n|3x + 5| = 9\n\nNow, we have to consider two cases, since the absolute value can be positive or negative:\n\nCase 1: 3x + 5 = 9\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n3x = 4\nDivide by 3:\nx = 4/3\n\nCase 2: 3x + 5 = -9\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n3x = -14\nDivide by 3:\nx = -14/3\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 4/3 and -14/3."
