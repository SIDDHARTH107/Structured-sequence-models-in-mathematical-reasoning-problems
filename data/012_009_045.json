    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 7 vertices and the following degree sequence: {3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1}. Is this degree sequence valid? If so, draw a possible graph G that corresponds to this degree sequence. If not, explain why not.",
    "message_2": "Yes, this degree sequence is valid. To check if a degree sequence is valid, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15, which is an odd number. Since the sum of the degrees must be even, this degree sequence is not valid.\n\nHowever, there is an error in the above explanation. The Handshaking Lemma is indeed true, but it is not a sufficient condition to determine if a degree sequence is valid or not. A better approach is to use the Havel-Hakimi algorithm, which is as follows:\n\n1. Sort the degree sequence in non-increasing order.\n2. Remove the first number (the highest degree) from the sequence, and reduce the next numbers in the sequence by 1 for as many times as the removed number.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until either the sequence becomes all zeros (in which case the degree sequence is valid) or it becomes impossible to continue (in which case the degree sequence is not valid).\n\nLet's apply the Havel-Hakimi algorithm to the given degree sequence:\n\n1. The sequence is already sorted: {3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1}.\n2. Remove the first number (3) and reduce the next three numbers by 1: {2, 2, 1, 1, 1}.\n3. Sort the sequence: {2, 2, 1, 1, 1}.\n4. Remove the first number (2) and reduce the next two numbers by 1: {1, 0, 1, 1}.\n5. Sort the sequence: {1, 1, 1, 0}.\n6. Remove the first number (1) and reduce the next number by 1: {0, 1, 0}.\n7. Sort the sequence: {1, 0, 0}.\n8. Remove the first number (1) and reduce the next number by 1: {0, 0}.\n\nThe sequence has become all zeros, so the degree sequence is valid.\n\nNow, let's draw a possible graph G that corresponds to this degree sequence:\n\nLabel the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, with degrees 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, and 1, respectively.\n\n1. Connect vertices A, B, and C to form a triangle (each has degree 2 now).\n2. Connect vertex A to vertex D (A has degree 3 now).\n3. Connect vertex B to vertex E (B has degree 3 now).\n4. Connect vertex C to vertex F (C has degree 3 now).\n5. Connect vertices F and G (F and G have degree 1 now).\n\nThe resulting graph G has the desired degree sequence:\n\nA: connected to B, C, D (degree 3)\nB: connected to A, C, E (degree 3)\nC: connected to A, B, F (degree 3)\nD: connected to A (degree 2)\nE: connected to B (degree 2)\nF: connected to C, G (degree 1)\nG: connected to F (degree 1)"
