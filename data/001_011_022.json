    "message_2": "To solve the equation (4x + 2)/(6x - 3) = (6x + 9)/(9x - 3), we will first find a common denominator and then cross-multiply.\n\nThe given equation is:\n\n(4x + 2)/(6x - 3) = (6x + 9)/(9x - 3)\n\nThe least common multiple of the denominators (6x - 3) and (9x - 3) is 18x - 9. Now, we will multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator (18x - 9):\n\n(18x - 9)(4x + 2)/(6x - 3) = (18x - 9)(6x + 9)/(9x - 3)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the denominators:\n\n(18x - 9)(4x + 2) = (18x - 9)(6x + 9)\n\nNow, we will expand both sides of the equation:\n\n(18x - 9)(4x) + (18x - 9)(2) = (18x - 9)(6x) + (18x - 9)(9)\n\n72x^2 - 36x + 36x - 18 = 108x^2 - 54x + 162x - 81\n\nNow, we will simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n72x^2 - 18 = 108x^2 - 54x + 162x - 81\n\nNow, we will move all the terms to one side of the equation:\n\n108x^2 - 72x^2 - 54x + 162x - 18 + 81 = 0\n\n36x^2 + 108x + 63 = 0\n\nNow, we will try to factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(6x + 9)(6x + 7) = 0\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\n\n6x + 9 = 0 or 6x + 7 = 0\n\nFor the first equation:\n\n6x = -9\nx = -9/6\nx = -3/2\n\nFor the second equation:\n\n6x = -7\nx = -7/6\n\nSo, the solutions for x are -3/2 and -7/6."
