Prove that X is a Hausdorff space.\n\nNote to the student: In this problem, you need to use your knowledge of separation axioms and the definition of the Hausdorff property to prove that X satisfies this property.",
    "message_2": "To prove that X is a Hausdorff space, we need to show that for any two distinct points x, y ∈ X, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V.\n\nSince X is a topological space where every two distinct points can be separated by open sets, we know that for any x, y ∈ X with x ≠ y, there exist open sets U_x and V_y such that x ∈ U_x, y ∈ V_y, and U_x ∩ V_y ≠ ∅.\n\nNow, we want to show that we can find disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V. Since U_x ∩ V_y ≠ ∅, there exists a point z ∈ U_x ∩ V_y. Since z is in both U_x and V_y, we can find open sets U_z and V_z such that z ∈ U_z, z ∈ V_z, and U_z ∩ V_z = ∅.\n\nNow, consider the open sets U = U_x ∩ U_z and V = V_y ∩ V_z. We have x ∈ U and y ∈ V, since x ∈ U_x, z ∈ U_z, y ∈ V_y, and z ∈ V_z. Moreover, U ∩ V = (U_x ∩ U_z) ∩ (V_y ∩ V_z) = (U_x ∩ V_y) ∩ (U_z ∩ V_z) = ∅, since U_z ∩ V_z = ∅.\n\nThus, for any two distinct points x, y ∈ X, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V. Therefore, X is a Hausdorff space."
