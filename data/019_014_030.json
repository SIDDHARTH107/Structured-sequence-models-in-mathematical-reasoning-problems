    "message_1": "Let f be a higher-order logic function that takes two sets as arguments and returns their union. Suppose A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5} are two sets. What is the value of f(A, B)?",
    "message_2": "The value of f(A, B) is the union of sets A and B. The union of two sets is the set containing all elements from both sets, without duplication. In this case, f(A, B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}."
