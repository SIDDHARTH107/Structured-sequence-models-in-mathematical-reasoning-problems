The characteristic equation is given by:\n\n$$r^2 + 4 = 0$$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get:\n\n$$r^2 = -4$$\n$$r = \\pm 2i$$\n\nSince the roots are complex, the general solution of the differential equation is given by:\n\n$$y(t) = C_1 \\cos(2t) + C_2 \\sin(2t)$$\n\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are arbitrary constants."
