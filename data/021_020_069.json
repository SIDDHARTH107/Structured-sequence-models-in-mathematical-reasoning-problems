    "message_2": "The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the intelligent foraging behavior of honey bees. To find the minimum value of the given function using the ABC algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of solutions (food sources) randomly.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution.\n3. Perform the employed bee phase: Generate new solutions (candidate food sources) by modifying the current solutions, and evaluate their fitness.\n4. Perform the onlooker bee phase: Select the best solutions based on their fitness, generate new solutions by modifying the selected solutions, and evaluate their fitness.\n5. Update the best solution found so far.\n6. Perform the scout bee phase: If a solution cannot be improved after a certain number of iterations, replace it with a new randomly generated solution.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the ABC algorithm to find the minimum value of the given function:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**3 - 12*x**2 + 48*x + 7\n\ndef fitness(x):\n    return 1 / (1 + f(x))\n\ndef generate_new_solution(x, partner_x, phi):\n    return x + phi * (x - partner_x)\n\ndef ABC_algorithm(population_size, max_iterations):\n    lower_bound = -10\n    upper_bound = 20\n    dimension = 1\n\n    # Step 1: Initialize the population of solutions randomly\n    population = [random.uniform(lower_bound, upper_bound) for _ in range(population_size)]\n\n    best_solution = min(population, key=f)\n    best_fitness = fitness(best_solution)\n\n    for iteration in range(max_iterations):\n        # Step 3: Employed bee phase\n        for i in range(population_size):\n            partner_i = random.randint(0, population_size - 1)\n            while partner_i == i:\n                partner_i = random.randint(0, population_size - 1)\n\n            phi = random.uniform(-1, 1)\n            new_solution = generate_new_solution(population[i], population[partner_i], phi)\n\n            if fitness(new_solution) > fitness(population[i]):\n                population[i] = new_solution\n\n        # Step 4: Onlooker bee phase\n        probabilities = [fitness(x) / sum(fitness(x) for x in population) for x in population]\n        for i in range(population_size):\n            partner_i = random.choices(range(population_size), probabilities)[0]\n            while partner_i == i:\n                partner_i = random.choices(range(population_size), probabilities)[0]\n\n            phi = random.uniform(-1, 1)\n            new_solution = generate_new_solution(population[i], population[partner_i], phi)\n\n            if fitness(new_solution) > fitness(population[i]):\n                population[i] = new_solution\n\n        # Step 5: Update the best solution found so far\n        current_best_solution = min(population, key=f)\n        if fitness(current_best_solution) > best_fitness:\n            best_solution = current_best_solution\n            best_fitness = fitness(best_solution)\n\n    return best_solution, f(best_solution)\n\npopulation_size = 50\nmax_iterations = 1000\nbest_solution, min_value = ABC_algorithm(population_size, max_iterations)\nprint(f\"Best solution: x = {best_solution}, Minimum value: f(x) = {min_value}\")\n```\n\nThis implementation may not be the most efficient or accurate, but it demonstrates the basic steps of the ABC algorithm. The result will vary due to the random nature of the algorithm, but it should give a reasonable approximation of the minimum value of the function."
