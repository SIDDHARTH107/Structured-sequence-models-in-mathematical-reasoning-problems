    "message_2": "To find the number of points where the sphere and torus intersect, we need to analyze their equations and see where they coincide.\n\nLet the sphere be centered at the origin with radius 2. Its equation is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2^2 = 4\n\nNow, let the torus be centered at the origin with major radius R = 3 and minor radius r = 1. Its equation is:\n\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + R^2 - r^2)^2 = 4R^2(x^2 + y^2)\n\nSubstitute the values of R and r:\n\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 3^2 - 1^2)^2 = 4(3^2)(x^2 + y^2)\n\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2)\n\nNow, substitute the equation of the sphere into the equation of the torus:\n\n(4 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2)\n\n12^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2)\n\nDivide both sides by 36:\n\n4 = x^2 + y^2\n\nNow, we have a circle with radius 2 in the xy-plane. The torus and sphere intersect along this circle. To find the number of points where they intersect, we need to find the points on the circle that lie on the surface of the torus.\n\nThe equation of the torus can be rewritten as:\n\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 - 36(x^2 + y^2) = 0\n\nSince we know that x^2 + y^2 = 4, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n(4 + z^2 + 8)^2 - 36(4) = 0\n\n(12 + z^2)^2 - 144 = 0\n\nNow, let u = 12 + z^2:\n\nu^2 - 144 = 0\n\n(u - 12)(u + 12) = 0\n\nu = 12 or u = -12\n\nSince z^2 cannot be negative, we only consider u = 12:\n\n12 + z^2 = 12\n\nz^2 = 0\n\nz = 0\n\nSo, there is only one value for z, which means the sphere and torus intersect along a circle in the xy-plane with z = 0. The number of points where they intersect is infinite, as they share a continuous curve (circle) on their surfaces."
