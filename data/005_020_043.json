    "message_1": "Suppose you are simulating rolling a fair six-sided die 1000 times using a Monte Carlo simulation. Approximately how many times should you expect to roll a 3?",
    "message_2": "Since the die is fair, each of the six sides has an equal probability of being rolled, which is 1/6. To find the expected number of times you would roll a 3 in 1000 rolls, you can multiply the probability of rolling a 3 (1/6) by the total number of rolls (1000).\n\nExpected number of 3s = (1/6) * 1000 = 166.67\n\nSo, you should expect to roll a 3 approximately 167 times in 1000 rolls."
