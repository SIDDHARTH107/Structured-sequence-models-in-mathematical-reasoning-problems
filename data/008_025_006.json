    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2. So, these two equations are not independent, and they represent the same line. In this case, there are infinitely many solutions, and any pair (x, y) that satisfies one equation will satisfy the other as well.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve one of the equations for one of the variables. Let's solve the first equation for y:\n\n3y = 7 + 2x\ny = (7 + 2x) / 3\n\nNow, for any value of x, we can find the corresponding value of y using this equation. This represents the general solution to the system of linear equations."
