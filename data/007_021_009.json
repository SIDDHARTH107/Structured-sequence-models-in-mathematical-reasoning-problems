    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an algorithm for finding a non-trivial factor of a composite number. Let's apply it to the number 142857.\n\n1. Choose a starting value x_0 and a function f(x). A common choice for f(x) is f(x) = x^2 + 1 (mod N), where N is the number we want to factor. Let's choose x_0 = 2.\n\n2. Initialize two variables x and y to x_0, and set the greatest common divisor (GCD) to 1.\n\n3. Iterate the following steps until GCD is not 1 or N:\n   a. Update x to f(x) (mod N).\n   b. Update y to f(f(y)) (mod N).\n   c. Update GCD to gcd(|x - y|, N).\n\nLet's perform the iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) % 142857 = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) % 142857 = 26\nGCD = gcd(|5 - 26|, 142857) = gcd(21, 142857) = 1\n\nIteration 2:\nx = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) % 142857 = 26\ny = f(f(y)) = f(26) = (26^2 + 1) % 142857 = 677\nGCD = gcd(|26 - 677|, 142857) = gcd(651, 142857) = 1\n\nIteration 3:\nx = f(x) = (26^2 + 1) % 142857 = 677\ny = f(f(y)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) % 142857 = 1683\nGCD = gcd(|677 - 1683|, 142857) = gcd(1006, 142857) = 1\n\nIteration 4:\nx = f(x) = (677^2 + 1) % 142857 = 1683\ny = f(f(y)) = f(1683) = (1683^2 + 1) % 142857 = 14284\nGCD = gcd(|1683 - 14284|, 142857) = gcd(12601, 142857) = 3\n\nNow we have found a non-trivial factor of 142857, which is 3."
