    "message_2": "The given function is y = 3sin(2x - π/3). This function is in the form y = A sin(Bx - C) + D, where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, C determines the phase shift, and D determines the vertical displacement.\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, A = 3, so the amplitude is 3.\n\n2. Period: The period of a sine function is given by the formula (2π)/B, where B is the coefficient of x inside the sine function. In this case, B = 2, so the period is (2π)/2 = π.\n\n3. Phase shift (C): The phase shift is given by the formula C/B, where C is the constant inside the sine function and B is the coefficient of x inside the sine function. In this case, C = π/3 and B = 2, so the phase shift is (π/3)/2 = π/6. Since the phase shift is positive, the graph shifts to the right by π/6.\n\n4. Vertical displacement (D): There is no constant added or subtracted from the sine function in this case, so the vertical displacement is 0.\n\nTo graph the function over one period, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw the x-axis and y-axis.\n2. Mark the amplitude on the y-axis (3 and -3).\n3. Mark the period on the x-axis (π).\n4. Mark the phase shift on the x-axis (π/6).\n5. Draw the sine curve starting from the phase shift, reaching the maximum amplitude at π/4, returning to the x-axis at π/2, reaching the minimum amplitude at 3π/4, and returning to the x-axis at π.\n\nThe graph of the function y = 3sin(2x - π/3) over one period will have an amplitude of 3, a period of π, a phase shift of π/6 to the right, and no vertical displacement."
