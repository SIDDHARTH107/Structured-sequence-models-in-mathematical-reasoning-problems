    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series coefficients a₀, aₙ, and bₙ for the function f(x) = x² - 4 with period 2π, we will use the following formulas:\n\na₀ = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) dx] from -L to L\naₙ = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nωx) dx] from -L to L\nbₙ = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nωx) dx] from -L to L\n\nwhere L = π (half of the period), ω = 2π/L = 2, and n is a non-zero integer.\n\nFirst, let's find a₀:\n\na₀ = (1/π) * ∫[(x² - 4) dx] from -π to π\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [x³/3 - 4x] from -π to π\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [(π³/3 - 4π) - (-π³/3 + 4π)]\n\na₀ = (1/π) * (2π³/3 - 8π)\n\na₀ = 2π²/3 - 8\n\nNow, let's find aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * ∫[(x² - 4) * cos(2nx) dx] from -π to π\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x² - 4, dv = cos(2nx) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = (1/2n) * sin(2nx)\n\nNow, we have:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(1/2n) * (x² - 4) * sin(2nx) - ∫(1/2n) * 2x * sin(2nx) dx] from -π to π\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(1/2n) * (x² - 4) * sin(2nx) - (1/2n) * ∫2x * sin(2nx) dx] from -π to π\n\nTo solve the remaining integral, we can use integration by parts again:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(2nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/2n) * cos(2nx)\n\nNow, we have:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(1/2n) * (x² - 4) * sin(2nx) + (1/4n²) * x * cos(2nx) + (1/4n²) * ∫cos(2nx) dx] from -π to π\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(1/2n) * (x² - 4) * sin(2nx) + (1/4n²) * x * cos(2nx) + (1/8n³) * sin(2nx)] from -π to π\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(1/2n) * (π² - 4) * sin(2nπ) + (1/4n²) * π * cos(2nπ) + (1/8n³) * sin(2nπ) - ((1/2n) * (-π² - 4) * sin(-2nπ) + (1/4n²) * (-π) * cos(-2nπ) + (1/8n³) * sin(-2nπ))]\n\nSince sin(2nπ) = 0 and cos(2nπ) = 1 for all integer values of n, we have:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(1/4n²) * π - (1/4n²) * (-π)]\n\naₙ = (1/2n²) * π\n\nFinally, let's find bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * ∫[(x² - 4) * sin(2nx) dx] from -π to π\n\nSince f(x) is an even function and sin(2nx) is an odd function, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, bₙ = 0.\n\nIn summary, the Fourier series coefficients for the function f(x) = x² - 4 with period 2π are:\n\na₀ = 2π²/3 - 8\naₙ = (1/2n²) * π\nbₙ = 0"
