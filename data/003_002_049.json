    "message_1": "Consider a right-angled triangle with angle A = 30 degrees and hypotenuse length of 10 units. What are the values of the sine, cosine, and tangent of angle A?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the right-angled triangle as follows:\n\n- Hypotenuse (opposite the right angle): c = 10 units\n- Side opposite angle A: a\n- Side adjacent to angle A: b\n\nWe know that angle A = 30 degrees. We can use the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios to find the values of these trigonometric functions for angle A.\n\n1. Sine (sin):\nsin(A) = opposite side / hypotenuse\nsin(30) = a / 10\n\nWe know that sin(30) = 1/2 (from the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle or the unit circle). Therefore:\n1/2 = a / 10\na = 5 units\n\n2. Cosine (cos):\ncos(A) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\ncos(30) = b / 10\n\nWe know that cos(30) = √3/2 (from the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle or the unit circle). Therefore:\n√3/2 = b / 10\nb = 5√3 units\n\n3. Tangent (tan):\ntan(A) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(30) = a / b\n\nWe know that tan(30) = 1/√3 (from the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle or the unit circle). Therefore:\ntan(30) = 5 / (5√3)\ntan(30) = 1/√3\n\nSo, the values of the sine, cosine, and tangent of angle A are:\n\nsin(30) = 1/2\ncos(30) = √3/2\ntan(30) = 1/√3"
