    "message_1": "Let M be a smooth manifold of dimension d, and let alpha be a closed 2-form on M. Suppose that alpha represents a nonzero element of the second De Rham cohomology group, H^2(M). Determine whether alpha is exact or not, i.e., whether there is a 1-form beta such that alpha = d beta.",
    "message_2": "Since α represents a nonzero element of the second De Rham cohomology group H^2(M), this means that α is a closed 2-form (dα = 0) but not exact. If α were exact, it would be the exterior derivative of some 1-form β, i.e., α = dβ. However, this would mean that α represents the zero element in H^2(M), which contradicts the given information.\n\nTherefore, α is not exact, and there is no 1-form β such that α = dβ."
