Their marginal cost of production is $5 per unit. The inverse demand curve for their product is represented by P = 50 - Q, where P is the price per unit and Q is the total quantity produced by both firms. If each firm decides on a quantity to produce simultaneously, what will be the quantity produced and price charged in the market equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the Cournot equilibrium, which is the point at which both firms have no incentive to change their production quantities. We'll do this by finding the reaction functions for both firms and then solving for the equilibrium quantities.\n\nLet qA and qB be the quantities produced by firm A and firm B, respectively. The total quantity produced in the market, Q, is the sum of the quantities produced by both firms: Q = qA + qB.\n\nThe inverse demand curve is given by P = 50 - Q. We can substitute Q with qA + qB: P = 50 - (qA + qB).\n\nThe revenue for each firm is the product of the price and the quantity produced: R = P * q. So, the revenue for firm A is RA = (50 - (qA + qB)) * qA, and the revenue for firm B is RB = (50 - (qA + qB)) * qB.\n\nThe marginal cost of production is $5 per unit for both firms. Therefore, the profit for each firm is the difference between the revenue and the cost of production: πA = RA - 5qA and πB = RB - 5qB.\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to find the first-order conditions for profit maximization for each firm. We'll take the partial derivatives of the profit functions with respect to the quantities produced and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂πA/∂qA = ∂((50 - (qA + qB)) * qA - 5qA)/∂qA = 0\n∂πB/∂qB = ∂((50 - (qA + qB)) * qB - 5qB)/∂qB = 0\n\nSolving these first-order conditions, we get the reaction functions for both firms:\n\nqA = (45 - qB)/2\nqB = (45 - qA)/2\n\nNow we can solve for the equilibrium quantities by substituting one reaction function into the other:\n\nqA = (45 - ((45 - qA)/2))/2\n\nSolving for qA, we get:\n\nqA = 30/3 = 10\n\nNow we can find qB by substituting qA back into the reaction function for firm B:\n\nqB = (45 - 10)/2 = 35/2 = 17.5\n\nSo, in the Cournot equilibrium, firm A will produce 10 units, and firm B will produce 17.5 units. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = qA + qB = 10 + 17.5 = 27.5.\n\nFinally, we can find the price charged in the market equilibrium by substituting Q back into the inverse demand curve:\n\nP = 50 - 27.5 = 22.5\n\nThus, in the market equilibrium, the quantity produced is 27.5 units, and the price charged is $22.5 per unit."
