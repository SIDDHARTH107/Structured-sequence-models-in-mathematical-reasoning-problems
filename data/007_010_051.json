    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we can set up the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 2 (mod 9)\n\nFirst, we need to find the product of the moduli: N = 5 * 7 * 9 = 315.\n\nNext, we need to compute the partial products:\nN1 = N/5 = 315/5 = 63\nN2 = N/7 = 315/7 = 45\nN3 = N/9 = 315/9 = 35\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products:\ny1 = 63^(-1) (mod 5) = 3 (since 63 * 3 ≡ 1 (mod 5))\ny2 = 45^(-1) (mod 7) = 5 (since 45 * 5 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\ny3 = 35^(-1) (mod 9) = 2 (since 35 * 2 ≡ 1 (mod 9))\n\nFinally, we can compute the solution x:\nx = (2 * 63 * 3) + (3 * 45 * 5) + (2 * 35 * 2) = 378 + 675 + 140 = 1193\n\nHowever, we need the smallest positive integer, so we should take the result modulo N:\nx = 1193 (mod 315) = 263\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given congruences is x = 263."
