    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 32, we can use the fact that the order of a group is equal to the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. Since 32 = 2^5, we are looking for the number of non-isomorphic 2-groups of order 32.\n\nWe can use the following theorem: If G is a group of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer, then G has a normal subgroup of order p^k for each k between 0 and n.\n\nUsing this theorem, we can find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 32 by considering the possible structures of their subgroups of order 2^k for k = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n1. If G has a normal subgroup of order 16, then G is a semi-direct product of this subgroup with a subgroup of order 2. There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 16: the cyclic group Z_16 and the direct product Z_8 x Z_2. In the first case, there is only one possible semi-direct product, which is the dihedral group D_32. In the second case, there are two possible semi-direct products, one of which is the quaternion group Q_32. Thus, there are three non-isomorphic groups of order 32 with a normal subgroup of order 16.\n\n2. If G has a normal subgroup of order 8, then G is a semi-direct product of this subgroup with a subgroup of order 4. There are three non-isomorphic groups of order 8: the cyclic group Z_8, the direct product Z_4 x Z_2, and the quaternion group Q_8. In the first case, there are two possible semi-direct products, one of which is the dihedral group D_16. In the second case, there are four possible semi-direct products, one of which is the quaternion group Q_16. In the third case, there is only one possible semi-direct product, which is the dihedral group D_8. Thus, there are six non-isomorphic groups of order 32 with a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\n3. If G has a normal subgroup of order 4, then G is a semi-direct product of this subgroup with a subgroup of order 8. There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 4: the cyclic group Z_4 and the direct product Z_2 x Z_2. In the first case, there are four possible semi-direct products, one of which is the dihedral group D_4. In the second case, there are eight possible semi-direct products, one of which is the quaternion group Q_4. Thus, there are eleven non-isomorphic groups of order 32 with a normal subgroup of order 4.\n\n4. If G has a normal subgroup of order 2, then G is a semi-direct product of this subgroup with a subgroup of order 16. There is only one non-isomorphic group of order 2: the cyclic group Z_2. In this case, there are sixteen possible semi-direct products, one of which is the dihedral group D_2. Thus, there are fifteen non-isomorphic groups of order 32 with a normal subgroup of order 2.\n\n5. If G has no normal subgroups of order 2^k for k = 1, 2, 3, or 4, then G is a simple group of order 32. However, there are no simple groups of order 32.\n\nIn total, there are 3 + 6 + 11 + 15 = 35 non-isomorphic groups of order 32."
