    "message_1": "Consider a necklace with 4 beads, each of which can be any of the colors: red, blue, or green. How many distinct necklaces can be made? (Assume rotations are considered equivalent.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Burnside's Lemma, which states that the number of distinct necklaces can be found by averaging the number of fixed points under each symmetry operation. In this case, there are two symmetry operations: the identity operation (no rotation) and the 180-degree rotation.\n\n1. Identity operation (no rotation): There are 3^4 = 81 fixed points, as each bead can be any of the 3 colors independently.\n\n2. 180-degree rotation: This operation swaps the first and third beads and the second and fourth beads. The necklace is fixed under this operation if the first and third beads are the same color and the second and fourth beads are the same color. There are 3 choices for the color of the first and third beads and 3 choices for the color of the second and fourth beads, giving a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fixed points.\n\nNow, we average the number of fixed points under these two operations: (81 + 9) / 2 = 45 distinct necklaces."
