    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's find the partial derivatives of x, y, and z with respect to u and v:\n\nx_u = ∂x/∂u = -2sin(u)sin(v)\nx_v = ∂x/∂v = 2cos(u)cos(v)\n\ny_u = ∂y/∂u = 2cos(u)sin(v)\ny_v = ∂y/∂v = 2sin(u)cos(v)\n\nz_u = ∂z/∂u = 0\nz_v = ∂z/∂v = -2sin(v)\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\n\nE = <x_u, x_u> = (-2sin(u)sin(v))^2 = 4sin^2(u)sin^2(v)\nF = <x_u, x_v> = (-2sin(u)sin(v))(2cos(u)cos(v)) = -4sin(u)cos(u)sin(v)cos(v)\nG = <x_v, x_v> = (2cos(u)cos(v))^2 = 4cos^2(u)cos^2(v)\n\nNext, we need to find the second fundamental form coefficients.
