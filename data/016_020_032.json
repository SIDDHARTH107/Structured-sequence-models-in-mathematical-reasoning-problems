    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Sierpinski pyramid or Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. After each iteration, the number of smaller tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nThe formula to calculate the number of smaller tetrahedra after n iterations is:\n\nNumber of smaller tetrahedra = (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nNumber of smaller tetrahedra = (4^5 - 1) / 3\nNumber of smaller tetrahedra = (1024 - 1) / 3\nNumber of smaller tetrahedra = 1023 / 3\nNumber of smaller tetrahedra = 341\n\nSo, after the 5th iteration of the construction process, a Sierpinski tetrahedron is made up of 341 smaller tetrahedra."
