    "message_2": "To decrypt a Vigenère cipher with a given keyword, we need to reverse the encryption process. The Vigenère cipher uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted along some number of positions in the alphabet based on the corresponding letter in the keyword.\n\nHere's the decryption process step by step:\n\n1. Write down the ciphertext: VHZYCMKXBAZA\n2. Write down the keyword below the ciphertext, repeating it as necessary: MATHMATHMATH\n3. For each letter pair, subtract the keyword letter's position in the alphabet (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25) from the ciphertext letter's position, modulo 26.\n4. Convert the resulting numbers back to letters.\n\nLet's decrypt the ciphertext:\n\nV - M = 21 - 12 = 9  -> J\nH - A = 7 - 0 = 7  -> H\nZ - T = 25 - 19 = 6 -> G\nY - H = 24 - 7 = 17 -> R\nC - M = 2 - 12 = -10 (mod 26) = 16 -> Q\nM - A = 12 - 0 = 12 -> M\nK - T = 10 - 19 = -9 (mod 26) = 17 -> R\nX - H = 23 - 7 = 16 -> Q\nB - M = 1 - 12 = -11 (mod 26) = 15 -> P\nA - A = 0 - 0 = 0 -> A\nZ - T = 25 - 19 = 6 -> G\nA - H = 0 - 7 = -7 (mod 26) = 19 -> T\n\nThe decrypted plaintext is: JHGRQMRQPAGT"
