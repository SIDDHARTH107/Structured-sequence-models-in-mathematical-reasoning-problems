    "message_2": "First, let's write the block matrix for this system. The block matrix is a partitioned matrix that consists of the coefficients of the variables and the constants on the other side of the equal sign. In this case, the block matrix is:\n\n| 1  1  1 | |x|   | 6 |\n| 2  3  4 | |y| = |20|\n| 3  4  5 | |z|   |28|\n\nNow, let's use block elimination to solve for x, y, and z. Block elimination is a method that involves eliminating variables one by one until we have a triangular system that can be solved using back substitution.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third equations.\n\nTo do this, we can subtract the first equation multiplied by an appropriate factor from the second and third equations. \n\nFor the second equation, we can subtract the first equation multiplied by 2:\n\n(2x + 3y + 4z) - 2(x + y + z) = 20 - 2(6)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\ny + 2z = 8\n\nFor the third equation, we can subtract the first equation multiplied by 3:\n\n(3x + 4y + 5z) - 3(x + y + z) = 28 - 3(6)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\ny + 2z = 10\n\nNow our system of equations is:\n\nx + y + z = 6\ny + 2z = 8\ny + 2z = 10\n\nStep 2: Notice that the second and third equations are inconsistent.\n\nThe second and third equations are:\n\ny + 2z = 8\ny + 2z = 10\n\nThese two equations cannot both be true at the same time, as they imply that 8 = 10, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no solution for x, y, and z that satisfies all three equations simultaneously. The system of linear equations is inconsistent."
