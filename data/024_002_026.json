    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance between point A and point B along the surface of the sphere, we can use the arc length formula for a circle. Since both points are on the equator, they lie on a great circle (a circle with the same diameter as the sphere).\n\nThe formula for the arc length of a circle is:\n\nArc length = radius × angle (in radians)\n\nThe angle between the two points is 90 degrees, which is equivalent to π/2 radians.\n\nThe radius of the sphere is given as 2 units.\n\nSo, the arc length (shortest distance) between point A and point B is:\n\nArc length = 2 × (π/2) = π units"
