    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular hexagon, we simply multiply the side length by the number of sides. In this case, the side length is 6 centimeters and there are 6 sides in a hexagon.\n\nPerimeter = side length × number of sides\nPerimeter = 6 cm × 6\nPerimeter = 36 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the hexagon is 36 centimeters."
