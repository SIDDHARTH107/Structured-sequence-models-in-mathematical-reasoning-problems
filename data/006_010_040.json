    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of a population of 2500 individuals, 320 will be affected by a particular disease if the historical data shows that the disease affects 12% of the entire population?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (in this case, 320 individuals affected by the disease)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the population of 2500 individuals)\n- x is the number of successes (in this case, 320 individuals affected by the disease)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the historical data shows that the disease affects 12% of the entire population, so p = 0.12)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, which can be calculated using the formula: n! / (x!(n-x)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(320) = (2500C320) * (0.12^320) * (1-0.12)^(2500-320)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 2500C320:\n\n2500! / (320!(2500-320)!) = 2500! / (320! * 2180!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nP(320) ≈ (2500C320) * (0.12^320) * (0.88^2180)\n\nCalculating this probability directly can be computationally intensive. However, we can use an approximation like the normal distribution to estimate the probability.\n\nMean (μ) = n * p = 2500 * 0.12 = 300\nStandard deviation (σ) = sqrt(n * p * (1-p)) = sqrt(2500 * 0.12 * 0.88) ≈ 16.07\n\nNow, we can standardize the value of x (320) using the z-score formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ = (320 - 300) / 16.07 ≈ 1.24\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we can find the probability of getting a z-score of 1.24, which is approximately 0.1075. However, this is the probability of getting a value less than 320. To find the probability of getting exactly 320, we can subtract the probability of getting a value less than 319:\n\nz = (319 - 300) / 16.07 ≈ 1.18\nP(z < 1.18) ≈ 0.881\n\nSo, the probability of exactly 320 individuals being affected by the disease is approximately:\n\nP(320) ≈ P(z < 1.24) - P(z < 1.18) ≈ 0.1075 - 0.881 ≈ 0.0105 or 1.05%"
