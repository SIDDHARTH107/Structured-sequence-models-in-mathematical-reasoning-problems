    "message_2": "A minimal model of a smooth projective curve X is a curve that is birationally equivalent to X and has the minimal possible number of singularities. In the case of a curve of genus 3, we can use the canonical embedding to find the minimal models.\n\nThe canonical divisor K_X is a divisor on X associated with the canonical line bundle, and its degree is given by the formula deg(K_X) = 2g - 2, where g is the genus of the curve. In our case, deg(K_X) = 2(3) - 2 = 4.\n\nThe canonical map φ_K: X → |K_X|^* is an embedding of X into the projective space P^3, where |K_X|^* is the dual of the complete linear system of K_X. This embedding is called the canonical embedding, and the image of X under this map is a curve in P^3.\n\nSince the canonical divisor has degree 4, the canonical embedding maps X to a curve of degree 4 in P^3. This curve is a complete intersection of two quadric surfaces in P^3. The minimal models of X are the curves that can be obtained by choosing different pairs of quadric surfaces whose intersection is a smooth curve of genus 3.\n\nThere are two types of minimal models for a smooth projective curve of genus 3:\n\n1. A smooth quartic curve in P^2: This is a curve of degree 4 in the projective plane, defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4. It is a minimal model because it has no singularities. The genus of a smooth quartic curve in P^2 is 3, so it is a minimal model of X.\n\n2. A smooth plane curve of degree 3 in P^3 (a twisted cubic curve): This curve can be obtained as the complete intersection of two quadric surfaces in P^3. It is a minimal model because it has no singularities, and its genus is also 3.\n\nIn summary, the minimal models of a smooth projective curve of genus 3 are the smooth quartic curves in P^2 and the twisted cubic curves in P^3."
