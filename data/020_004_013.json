    "message_1": "A factory produces two products, product X and product Y. The profit from producing one unit of X is $15 while the profit from producing one unit of Y is $12. There are 100 units of raw material available and the production capacity is 60 units per day. To produce one unit of X, it requires 1 unit of raw material and 2 units of production capacity, while to produce one unit of Y, it requires 2 units of raw material and 1 unit of production capacity. What is the maximum profit that the factory can obtain each day? Formulate this problem as a Quadratic Programming problem.",
    "message_2": "To formulate this problem as a Quadratic Programming problem, we first need to define our decision variables, objective function, and constraints.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product X produced per day and y be the number of units of product Y produced per day.\n\nObjective function:\nThe objective is to maximize the profit, which is given by the profit per unit of X times the number of units of X produced plus the profit per unit of Y times the number of units of Y produced. In mathematical terms, the objective function is:\n\nMaximize P(x, y) = 15x + 12y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Raw material constraint: The total raw material used for producing X and Y should not exceed 100 units per day.\n1x + 2y ≤ 100\n\n2. Production capacity constraint: The total production capacity used for producing X and Y should not exceed 60 units per day.\n2x + 1y ≤ 60\n\n3. Non-negativity constraint: The number of units produced for both X and Y should be non-negative.\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe Quadratic Programming problem can be formulated as:\n\nMaximize P(x, y) = 15x + 12y\n\nSubject to:\n1x + 2y ≤ 100\n2x + 1y ≤ 60\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nNote: This problem is actually a Linear Programming problem since the objective function and constraints are all linear. Quadratic Programming problems involve quadratic objective functions or constraints."
