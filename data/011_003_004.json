    "message_2": "To find the number of different combinations of 5 items that can be selected from a set of 8 items, we can use the binomial coefficient formula, which is also represented in Pascal's Triangle. The binomial coefficient formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items, n! is the factorial of n, and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nIn this case, we want to find C(8, 5):\n\nC(8, 5) = 8! / (5!(8-5)!)\n\nFirst, we calculate the factorials:\n\n8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n(8-5)! = 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nC(8, 5) = 40,320 / (120 × 6) = 40,320 / 720 = 56\n\nSo, there are 56 different combinations of 5 items that can be selected from a set of 8 items using Pascal's Triangle."
