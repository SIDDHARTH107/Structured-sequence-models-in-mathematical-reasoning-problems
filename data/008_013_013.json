    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the coefficient matrix, X is the variable matrix, and B is the constant matrix.\n\nA = | 2  3  5 |\n    | 4  5  7 |\n    | 3 -2  6 |\n\nB = | 20 |\n    | 32 |\n    | 10 |\n\nStep 1: LU Decomposition\n\nPerforming LU decomposition on matrix A, we get:\n\nL = | 1   0   0 |\n    | 2   1   0 |\n    | 1.5 -4   1 |\n\nU = | 2  3   5  |\n    | 0 -1  -3 |\n    | 0  0   0.5|\n\nStep 2: Solve L * Y = B for Y\n\nWe have L as:\n\n| 1   0   0 |   | y1 |   | 20 |\n| 2   1   0 | * | y2 | = | 32 |\n| 1.5 -4   1 |   | y3 |   | 10 |\n\nSolving for Y, we get:\n\ny1 = 20\ny2 = 32 - 2 * y1 = -8\ny3 = 10 - 1.5 * y1 + 4 * y2 = 2\n\nSo, Y = | 20 |\n         | -8 |\n         |  2 |\n\nStep 3: Solve U * X = Y for X\n\nWe have U as:\n\n| 2  3   5  |   | x1 |   | 20 |\n| 0 -1  -3  | * | x2 | = | -8 |\n| 0  0   0.5|   | x3 |   |  2 |\n\nSolving for X, we get:\n\nx3 = 2 / 0.5 = 4\nx2 = (-8 + 3 * x3) / -1 = 4\nx1 = (20 - 3 * x2 - 5 * x3) / 2 = 1\n\nSo, X = | 1 |\n         | 4 |\n         | 4 |\n\nThus, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 4, and z = 4."
