    "message_1": "A manufacturer wants to produce boxes of cereal with a weight of 500 grams. However, due to the variability in the production process, the weight of each box may vary slightly. Using fuzzy logic, determine the minimum and maximum weight limits that each box can have so that it can be considered within the acceptable weight range. Assume a tolerance of 5% of the target weight.",
    "message_2": "To determine the minimum and maximum weight limits using fuzzy logic with a tolerance of 5%, we first need to calculate 5% of the target weight (500 grams).\n\n5% of 500 grams = (5/100) * 500 = 25 grams\n\nNow, we can calculate the minimum and maximum weight limits by subtracting and adding the tolerance value to the target weight, respectively.\n\nMinimum weight limit = Target weight - Tolerance\nMinimum weight limit = 500 grams - 25 grams = 475 grams\n\nMaximum weight limit = Target weight + Tolerance\nMaximum weight limit = 500 grams + 25 grams = 525 grams\n\nSo, using fuzzy logic with a tolerance of 5%, the acceptable weight range for the cereal boxes is between 475 grams and 525 grams."
