    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg with length 6 cm and another leg with length 8 cm. What is the length of the hypotenuse?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b).\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nIn this case, a = 6 cm and b = 8 cm. So, we have:\n\nc^2 = 6^2 + 8^2\nc^2 = 36 + 64\nc^2 = 100\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nc = âˆš100\nc = 10 cm\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse is 10 cm."
