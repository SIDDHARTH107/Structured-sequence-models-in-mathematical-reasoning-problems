    "message_2": "We are given that G is a group of order 18. We want to show that G must be isomorphic to either C18 (the cyclic group of order 18), the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6.\n\nStep 1: Sylow Theorems\nBy the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n3) and the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n2) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n3 divides 18 and n3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n2 divides 9 and n2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n\nFrom condition 1, we have that n3 can be 1 or 6. From condition 2, we have that n2 can be 1 or 3.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing Sylow 3-subgroups\nIf n3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, say P, of order 3. Since P is the only subgroup of order 3, it must be normal in G. \n\nIf n3 = 6, then there are 6 Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, we can't conclude that there is a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup.\n\nStep 3: Analyzing Sylow 2-subgroups\nIf n2 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, say Q, of order 6. Since Q is the only subgroup of order 6, it must be normal in G. \n\nIf n2 = 3, then there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups. In this case, we can't conclude that there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nStep 4: Considering the possibilities\nNow we consider the possible combinations of n3 and n2:\n\nCase 1: n3 = 1 and n2 = 1\nIn this case, both P and Q are normal in G. Since |P| = 3 and |Q| = 6, we have that |P ∩ Q| = 1. By the direct product theorem, we have that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q. Since P is a cyclic group of order 3 and Q is a group of order 6, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6.\n\nCase 2: n3 = 1 and n2 = 3\nIn this case, P is normal in G, but there is no unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup. However, since there is a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, G has a quotient group G/P of order 6. This quotient group can be either cyclic (isomorphic to C6) or non-cyclic (isomorphic to S3). If G/P is cyclic, then G is an extension of P by a cyclic group of order 6, and G is isomorphic to C18. If G/P is non-cyclic, then G is an extension of P by S3, and G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nCase 3: n3 = 6 and n2 = 1\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, and the same conclusions apply.\n\nCase 4: n3 = 6 and n2 = 3\nIn this case, there is no unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup or Sylow 2-subgroup. However, we can rule out this case because it contradicts the fact that G has a non-trivial center (by the class equation). If G had no normal subgroups of order 3 or 6, then its center would be trivial, which is not possible.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6."
