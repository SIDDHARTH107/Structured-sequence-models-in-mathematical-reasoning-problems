The company has 150 units of material A and 70 units of material B available for production. Each widget sold generates a profit of $10. Find the optimal number of widgets the company should produce to maximize its profit using the whale optimization algorithm.",
    "message_2": "The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to solve optimization problems, but it is not suitable for solving this particular problem directly, as this is a linear programming problem with constraints. Instead, we can solve this problem using a more straightforward approach.\n\nLet x be the number of widgets produced. The company's constraints are:\n\n5x <= 150 (material A constraint)\n7x <= 70 (material B constraint)\n\nFirst, we can find the maximum number of widgets that can be produced based on each constraint:\n\nFor material A:\nx <= 150 / 5\nx <= 30\n\nFor material B:\nx <= 70 / 7\nx <= 10\n\nSince the company needs to satisfy both constraints, it should produce the minimum of these two values:\n\nx = min(30, 10)\nx = 10\n\nThus, the company should produce 10 widgets to maximize its profit without violating the constraints. The total profit generated would be:\n\nProfit = 10 * $10 = $100"
