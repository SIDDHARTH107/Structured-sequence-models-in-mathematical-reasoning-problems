    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of different ways the letters of the word \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\" can be arranged, we need to find the total number of permutations of the letters, considering that some letters are repeated.\n\nThe word \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\" has 12 letters, with the following frequency of each letter:\nC - 1, R - 2, Y - 1, P - 2, T - 1, O - 1, G - 1, A - 1, H - 1\n\nThe formula for finding the number of permutations with repetitions is:\n\nn! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of letters, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the frequencies of each unique letter.\n\nIn this case, the formula would be:\n\n12! / (1! * 2! * 1! * 2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!)\n\n12! / (2! * 2!) = 479001600 / 4 = 119750400\n\nSo, there are 119,750,400 different ways the letters of the word \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\" can be arranged using transposition ciphers."
