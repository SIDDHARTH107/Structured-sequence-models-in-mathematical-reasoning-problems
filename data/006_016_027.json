    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of a product being defective is 0.2. If a company produces 500 products, what is the probability that exactly 100 of them will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x defective products\n- n is the total number of products (500 in this case)\n- x is the number of defective products (100 in this case)\n- p is the probability of a product being defective (0.2 in this case)\n- q is the probability of a product not being defective (1 - p = 0.8 in this case)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of choosing x items from a set of n items, which can be calculated as n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(100) = (500C100) * (0.2^100) * (0.8^400)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 500C100:\n\n500C100 = 500! / (100! * (500-100)!)\n         = 500! / (100! * 400!)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator or software to compute the values:\n\n500C100 ≈ 2.456942e+134\n(0.2^100) ≈ 1.267651e-70\n(0.8^400) ≈ 2.037036e-90\n\nMultiplying these values together:\n\nP(100) ≈ 2.456942e+134 * 1.267651e-70 * 2.037036e-90\nP(100) ≈ 6.386068e-26\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 100 defective products out of 500 is approximately 6.39 x 10^(-26)."
