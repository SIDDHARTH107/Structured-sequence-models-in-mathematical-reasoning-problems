    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(θ)\n\nHowever, we don't have the angle θ. To find the angle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse and then use the inverse trigonometric functions.\n\nLet's call the base a, the height b, and the hypotenuse c. We have:\n\na = 8 meters\nb = 11 meters\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\nc^2 = 8^2 + 11^2\nc^2 = 64 + 121\nc^2 = 185\nc = √185 ≈ 13.60 meters\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ using the inverse trigonometric functions. Let's use the sine function:\n\nsin(θ) = opposite side / hypotenuse\nsin(θ) = b / c\nsin(θ) = 11 / 13.60\n\nθ = arcsin(11 / 13.60) ≈ 54.46°\n\nNow that we have the angle, we can find the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(θ)\nArea = (1/2) * 8 * 11 * sin(54.46°)\nArea ≈ 0.5 * 8 * 11 * 0.816\nArea ≈ 35.84 square meters\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 35.84 square meters."
