    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance to the starting node (node 1) as 0 and the distance to all other nodes as infinity.\n   Distances: [0, ∞, ∞, ∞]\n   Unvisited: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\n2. Set the current node as the starting node (node 1) and calculate the tentative distance to all its neighbors.\n   Distances: [0, 2, 8, ∞]\n   Unvisited: {2, 3, 4}\n\n3. Mark the current node (node 1) as visited and select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance as the new current node (node 2).\n   Distances: [0, 2, 8, ∞]\n   Unvisited: {3, 4}\n\n4. Update the tentative distances of the neighbors of the current node (node 2).\n   Distances: [0, 2, 8, 7]\n   Unvisited: {3, 4}\n\n5. Mark the current node (node 2) as visited and select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance as the new current node (node 4).\n   Distances: [0, 2, 8, 7]\n   Unvisited: {3}\n\n6. Update the tentative distances of the neighbors of the current node (node 4).\n   Distances: [0, 2, 7, 7]\n   Unvisited: {3}\n\n7. Mark the current node (node 4) as visited and select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance as the new current node (node 3).\n   Distances: [0, 2, 7, 7]\n   Unvisited: {}\n\n8. Mark the current node (node 3) as visited. Since there are no more unvisited nodes, the algorithm is complete.\n\nThe shortest path from node 1 to node 4 has a length of 7."
