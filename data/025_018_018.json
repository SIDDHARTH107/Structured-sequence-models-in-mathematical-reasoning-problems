    "message_1": "Consider the curve in the projective plane given by the equation $y^2z = x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z)$, where $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is a fixed parameter. Let $C$ be the closure of the affine curve defined by the same equation, obtained by adding the point at infinity. Show that if $\\lambda \\not\\in \\{0,1,\\infty\\}$, then $C$ is a smooth curve of genus one.",
    "message_2": "To show that $C$ is a smooth curve of genus one, we need to check two things: first, that the curve is smooth, and second, that its genus is one.\n\n1. Smoothness:\n\nTo check the smoothness of the curve, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$, and then check that their gradients are not all zero at any point on the curve.\n\nThe equation of the curve is given by $F(x, y, z) = y^2z - x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z) = 0$. Let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 + 2x(1+\\lambda)z - \\lambda(1-\\lambda)z^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = y^2 - x^2 + 2x(\\lambda-1)z - \\lambda x^2$\n\nNow, we need to check that the gradients are not all zero at any point on the curve. Suppose that the gradients are all zero at a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ on the curve. Then we have:\n\n$-3x_0^2 + 2x_0(1+\\lambda)z_0 - \\lambda(1-\\lambda)z_0^2 = 0$\n\n$2y_0z_0 = 0$\n\n$y_0^2 - x_0^2 + 2x_0(\\lambda-1)z_0 - \\lambda x_0^2 = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: $y_0 = 0$. In this case, the curve equation becomes $0 = x_0(x_0-z_0)(x_0-\\lambda z_0)$. Since $\\lambda \\not\\in \\{0,1,\\infty\\}$, we have three distinct points: $(0:0:1)$, $(1:0:0)$, and $(\\lambda:0:0)$. These points are not collinear, so they don't lie on a line in the projective plane, and the curve is smooth at these points.\n\nCase 2: $z_0 = 0$. In this case, the curve equation becomes $y_0^2 = x_0^3$. This is a smooth cubic curve, so the curve is smooth at these points.\n\nThus, in both cases, the curve is smooth.\n\n2. Genus:\n\nTo compute the genus of the curve, we can use the formula for the genus of a plane curve given by the degree $d$: $g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$. In our case, the degree of the curve is $3$, so the genus is:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$\n\nSo, the genus of the curve is one.\n\nIn conclusion, if $\\lambda \\not\\in \\{0,1,\\infty\\}$, then $C$ is a smooth curve of genus one."
