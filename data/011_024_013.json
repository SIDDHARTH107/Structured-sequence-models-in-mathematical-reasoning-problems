What is the minimum cost of transportation?\n\n|   | Warehouse 1 | Warehouse 2 | Warehouse 3 |\n|:-:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|\n| A |      100    |      150    |      200    |\n| B |      200    |      250    |      100    |\n| C |      300    |      200    |      150    |\n\nAssuming the cost per unit of transportation is the same for each warehouse, how many units should be transported to each warehouse to minimize the cost of transportation?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of transportation, we should transport the units to the warehouses with the shortest distances. We can do this by comparing the distances for each warehouse and choosing the shortest one.\n\nFor Warehouse 1, the shortest distance is from factory A with a distance of 100.\nFor Warehouse 2, the shortest distance is from factory C with a distance of 200.\nFor Warehouse 3, the shortest distance is from factory B with a distance of 100.\n\nLet x, y, and z be the number of units transported to Warehouse 1, Warehouse 2, and Warehouse 3, respectively. We have the following equation:\n\nx + y + z = 850\n\nWe want to minimize the cost, which is the sum of the distances multiplied by the number of units transported:\n\nCost = 100x + 200y + 100z\n\nSince we want to minimize the cost, we should transport as many units as possible to the warehouses with the shortest distances, which are Warehouse 1 and Warehouse 3. Let's assume we transport all 850 units to Warehouse 1 and Warehouse 3:\n\nx + z = 850\n\nNow we need to find the optimal distribution of units between these two warehouses. Since the distances are the same (100), we can distribute the units evenly between them:\n\nx = 425\nz = 425\n\nSo, to minimize the cost of transportation, the company should transport 425 units to Warehouse 1 from factory A, 0 units to Warehouse 2, and 425 units to Warehouse 3 from factory B."
