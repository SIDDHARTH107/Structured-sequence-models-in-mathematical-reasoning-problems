    "message_2": "To solve this optimal control problem, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, we define the Hamiltonian function H as follows:\n\nH(y, u, p, t) = y^2 + u^2 + p(u - y)\n\nwhere p(t) is the costate variable (also known as the adjoint variable).\n\nNext, we need to find the necessary conditions for optimality. According to the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the optimal control u(t) should satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. ∂H/∂u = 0\n2. p'(t) = -∂H/∂y\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂H/∂u = 2u + p\n∂H/∂y = 2y - p\n\nFrom condition 1, we have:\n\n2u + p = 0\nu = -p/2\n\nNow, let's compute p'(t) using condition 2:\n\np'(t) = -∂H/∂y = -2y + p\n\nSubstitute u = -p/2 into the system of differential equations:\n\ny'(t) = -p/2\nu'(t) = -y(t)\n\nNow, we have a new system of differential equations:\n\ny'(t) = -p/2\np'(t) = -2y + p\nu'(t) = -y(t)\n\nwith the boundary conditions y(0) = 0 and y(1) = 1.\n\nTo solve this system of differential equations, we can use the method of variation of constants. Let's assume that y(t) = A(t)cos(t) + B(t)sin(t). Then, we have:\n\ny'(t) = A'(t)cos(t) - A(t)sin(t) + B'(t)sin(t) + B(t)cos(t)\n\nNow, we can find A'(t) and B'(t) by comparing the coefficients of cos(t) and sin(t):\n\nA'(t)cos(t) + B'(t)sin(t) = -p/2\n-A(t)sin(t) + B(t)cos(t) = y'(t)\n\nNow, we can solve for A'(t) and B'(t):\n\nA'(t) = -p/2cos(t) - y'(t)sin(t)\nB'(t) = -p/2sin(t) + y'(t)cos(t)\n\nIntegrating A'(t) and B'(t) with respect to t, we get:\n\nA(t) = ∫[-p/2cos(t) - y'(t)sin(t)]dt\nB(t) = ∫[-p/2sin(t) + y'(t)cos(t)]dt\n\nNow, we can substitute A(t) and B(t) back into the expression for y(t):\n\ny(t) = A(t)cos(t) + B(t)sin(t)\n\nFinally, we can use the boundary conditions y(0) = 0 and y(1) = 1 to find the optimal control u(t) and the corresponding trajectory y(t):\n\ny(0) = A(0)cos(0) + B(0)sin(0) = 0\ny(1) = A(1)cos(1) + B(1)sin(1) = 1\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nA(0) = 0\nA(1) = -cos(1)\nB(1) = (1 + cos(1))/sin(1)\n\nThus, the optimal control u(t) and the corresponding trajectory y(t) are given by:\n\nu(t) = -p/2 = -[-cos(1)cos(t) + ((1 + cos(1))/sin(1))sin(t)]/2\ny(t) = -cos(1)cos(t) + ((1 + cos(1))/sin(1))sin(t)"
