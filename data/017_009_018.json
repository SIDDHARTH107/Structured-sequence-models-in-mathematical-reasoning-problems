    "message_2": "First, let's recall some basic facts about groups of order p^2, where p is a prime number. In our case, p = 3, so the order of G is 9.\n\n1. A group of order p^2 has either one or two distinct subgroups of order p.\n2. If there is only one subgroup of order p, then the group is cyclic.\n3. If there are two distinct subgroups of order p, then the group is non-abelian.\n\nNow, let's prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nCase 1: G has only one subgroup of order 3.\n\nIn this case, G must be cyclic, since a group of order p^2 with only one subgroup of order p is cyclic. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9.\n\nCase 2: G has two distinct subgroups of order 3.\n\nLet H and K be the two distinct subgroups of order 3 in G. Since the order of G is 9, the order of H and K must be 3. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in H and K must divide the order of the group, so the order of any element in H and K must be 1 or 3. Since H and K are non-trivial subgroups, they must contain elements of order 3.\n\nNow, let h be an element of order 3 in H, and k be an element of order 3 in K. Since H and K are distinct, h and k must be distinct elements in G. Also, since the order of G is 9, the order of hk must divide 9, so the order of hk must be 1, 3, or 9.\n\nIf the order of hk is 1, then hk = e (the identity element), which implies that h = k^(-1), which is a contradiction since h and k are distinct elements in G.\n\nIf the order of hk is 3, then hk belongs to a subgroup of order 3. But since H and K are the only subgroups of order 3 in G, and h and k are distinct elements in H and K respectively, hk cannot belong to either H or K. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the order of hk must be 9. Since G has an element of order 9, G must be a non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9. Furthermore, every non-cyclic group of order 9 must be non-abelian, as shown in Case 2."
