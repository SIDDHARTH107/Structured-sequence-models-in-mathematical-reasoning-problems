    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of this specific outcome, we can use the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of trials (in this case, 3 coin tosses), k is the number of successful outcomes (2 heads), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 3! = 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!)\nC(3, 2) = 6 / (2 × 1)\nC(3, 2) = 3\n\nThere are 3 possible combinations of getting 2 heads and 1 tail in 3 coin tosses: HHT, HTH, and THH.\n\nSince a fair coin has a 50% chance of landing heads up and a 50% chance of landing tails up, the probability of each combination is:\n\nP(HHT) = P(HTH) = P(THH) = 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.125\n\nTo find the total probability of winning the game, we add the probabilities of each combination:\n\nP(winning) = P(HHT) + P(HTH) + P(THH) = 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.125 = 0.375\n\nSo, the probability of winning the game is 0.375 or 37.5%."
