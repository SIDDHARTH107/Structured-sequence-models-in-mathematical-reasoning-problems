    "message_1": "A right triangle has a leg of length 8 cm and a hypotenuse of length 17 cm. What is the length of the other leg of the triangle, rounded to the nearest tenth of a centimeter?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the length of the other leg \"b\".\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\na² + b² = c²\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nWe are given that one leg (a) has a length of 8 cm and the hypotenuse (c) has a length of 17 cm. We can plug these values into the formula:\n\n8² + b² = 17²\n\n64 + b² = 289\n\nNow, we can solve for b²:\n\nb² = 289 - 64\nb² = 225\n\nTo find the length of the other leg (b), we take the square root of 225:\n\nb = √225\nb = 15\n\nSo, the length of the other leg of the triangle is 15 cm."
