    "message_2": "First, let's write down the mathematical expression in predicate logic that represents the given statement:\n\n∃p (Prime(p) ∧ ∀n P(n, p))\n\nThis expression states that there exists a prime number p such that for every natural number n, n is divisible by p.\n\nNow, let's analyze this statement to see if it's true or false.\n\nRecall that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.\n\nSuppose there exists a prime number p such that for every natural number n, P(n, p). This means that every natural number n is divisible by p, i.e., n = p * k for some natural number k.\n\nHowever, this statement contradicts the definition of prime numbers. If p is a prime number, then there must be at least one natural number n that is not divisible by p (other than 1 and p itself). For example, if p = 2, then 3 is not divisible by 2. Similarly, if p = 3, then 2 is not divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, the given statement is false, and there does not exist a prime number p such that for every natural number n, P(n, p)."
