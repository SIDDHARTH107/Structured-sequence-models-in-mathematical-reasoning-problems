    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. To find the diameter, we first need to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. We can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for this purpose.\n\nHere's the adjacency matrix with the direct distances between vertices:\n\n```\n0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nAfter applying the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, we get the following matrix with the shortest path distances between all pairs of vertices:\n\n```\n0 1 2 1 1 1 1 3 3 3\n1 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2\n2 1 0 2 2 3 3 1 1 1\n1 1 2 0 1 2 2 3 3 3\n1 1 2 1 0 1 1 3 3 3\n1 2 3 2 1 0 1 4 4 4\n1 2 3 2 1 1 0 4 4 4\n3 2 1 3 3 4 4 0 1 1\n3 2 1 3 3 4 4 1 0 1\n3 2 1 3 3 4 4 1 1 0\n```\n\nNow, we need to find the largest value in this matrix, which represents the longest shortest path between any two vertices. The largest value is 4, which is the diameter of the graph."
