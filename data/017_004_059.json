    "message_2": "To show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. If a group has order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer, then the group has a subgroup of order p^i for every 0 ≤ i ≤ n (by the Sylow theorems).\n\n2. If a group has order p^2, where p is a prime number, then the group is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 9. Since 9 = 3^2, G has order 3^2. By fact 1, G has a subgroup H of order 3. Since the order of H is prime, H is cyclic, and so there exists an element a in G such that H = ⟨a⟩ and the order of a is 3.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/H. Since |G| = 9 and |H| = 3, we have |G/H| = 9/3 = 3. Since G/H has prime order, G/H is cyclic. Let bH be a generator of G/H, where b is an element of G. Then, the order of bH in G/H is 3.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: The order of b in G is 3. In this case, G is generated by a and b, both of which have order 3. Since the orders of a and b are coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3, i.e., G ≅ ⟨a⟩ × ⟨b⟩.\n\nCase 2: The order of b in G is 9. In this case, G is generated by b, which has order 9. Since G is generated by a single element of order 9, G is cyclic.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3."
