    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3. We will consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The only possibility is n_2 = 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The possibilities are n_3 = 1 or 4.\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. By the Sylow theorems, both P and Q are normal in the group G. Since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, G is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q, which is the cyclic group C48.\n\n2. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P is normal in G, G acts on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation. This action gives a homomorphism from G to S4. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of the Sylow 3-subgroups, which is trivial. Thus, G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S4. Since |G| = 48 > 24 = |S4|, this case is impossible.\n\n3. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Since Q is normal in G, G acts on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation. This action gives a homomorphism from G to S3. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of the Sylow 2-subgroups, which is a subgroup of order 16. Thus, G is an extension of Q by a group of order 16. There are two non-abelian groups of order 16: the dihedral group D8 and the quaternion group Q8. The resulting groups are the semidirect products Q ⋊ D8 and Q ⋊ Q8.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, G is an extension of a group of order 3 by a group of order 16. The only possibility is the alternating group A4 × C4.\n\nIn conclusion, there are five non-isomorphic groups of order 48: the cyclic group C48, the alternating group A4 × C4, and the two non-abelian semidirect products Q ⋊ D8 and Q ⋊ Q8. Any group of order 48 is isomorphic to one of these groups."
