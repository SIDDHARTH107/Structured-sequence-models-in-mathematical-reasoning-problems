Determine the chromatic index of G.\n\n```\n   1---2\n  / \\ / \\\n 3---4---5\n  \\ / \\ /\n   6---7\n```\n\nIn other words, what is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the edges of G such that no two adjacent edges have the same color?",
    "message_2": "To find the chromatic index of the graph G, we need to determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges such that no two adjacent edges have the same color.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree (Δ) of the graph G. The maximum degree is the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex. In this graph, vertices 3, 4, and 6 each have a degree of 4, which is the maximum degree.\n\nAccording to Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G is either equal to the maximum degree Δ or Δ + 1. So, in this case, the chromatic index is either 4 or 5.\n\nNow, let's try to color the edges using 4 colors. We can use the following edge coloring:\n\n```\n   1---2 (color 1)\n  / \\ / \\\n 3---4---5 (color 2)\n  \\ / \\ /\n   6---7 (color 3)\n```\n\nColor the other edges as follows:\n\n```\n1-3: color 2\n1-4: color 3\n2-4: color 4\n2-5: color 3\n3-6: color 1\n4-6: color 4\n4-7: color 1\n5-7: color 2\n```\n\nThe final colored graph looks like this:\n\n```\n   1---2 (color 1)\n  /2\\1/3\\\n 3---4---5 (color 2)\n  \\4/1\\2/\n   6---7 (color 3)\n```\n\nSince we were able to properly color the edges of the graph G using 4 colors, the chromatic index χ'(G) is 4."
