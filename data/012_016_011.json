    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of a graph G, we need to know the structure of the graph. Since you only provided the number of vertices (5) and edges (7), we cannot determine the exact structure of the graph. However, we can provide some general information about the Tutte polynomial.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial, T_G(x, y), is a two-variable polynomial that encodes information about the graph G. It is defined as:\n\nT_G(x, y) = âˆ‘(r, k) a(r, k) x^(r - k) y^(k - 1)\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all subgraphs H of G, r is the number of connected components in H, k is the number of connected components in G, and a(r, k) is the number of subgraphs H of G with r connected components and k connected components in G.\n\nFor a graph with 5 vertices and 7 edges, the Tutte polynomial will be a polynomial in x and y with terms depending on the structure of the graph. To find the exact Tutte polynomial for your graph, you would need to provide more information about the graph's structure, such as the adjacency matrix or a list of edges."
