    "message_1": "A marketing research firm conducting surveys found that in each survey, 70% of customers who purchased a product were satisfied with it, while 30% were dissatisfied. If a customer buys a product and is satisfied with it, what is the probability that they will be satisfied with a product they purchase the next time?",
    "message_2": "The problem statement does not provide any information about the correlation between a customer's satisfaction with their first purchase and their satisfaction with their next purchase. Therefore, we have to assume that the probability of a customer being satisfied with their next purchase is independent of their satisfaction with their first purchase.\n\nIn this case, the probability that a customer will be satisfied with a product they purchase the next time is the same as the overall probability of a customer being satisfied with a product, which is 70%."
