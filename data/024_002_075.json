    "message_2": "To find the geodesic path on the surface of a sphere, we can use the concept of great circles. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere, and its plane passes through the center of the sphere. The shortest path between two points on the surface of a sphere lies along the great circle connecting those points.\n\nFirst, let's find the great circle that passes through the points (3, 4, 0) and (-4, -3, 0). To do this, we can find the normal vector to the plane containing the great circle.\n\nLet A = (3, 4, 0) and B = (-4, -3, 0). The vectors from the origin to these points are OA = A and OB = B. The cross product of OA and OB gives the normal vector to the plane containing the great circle:\n\nN = OA × OB = (3, 4, 0) × (-4, -3, 0) = (0, 0, 25)\n\nNow, let's parameterize the great circle using spherical coordinates. The spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) are related to the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) by:\n\nx = r * sin(θ) * cos(φ)\ny = r * sin(θ) * sin(φ)\nz = r * cos(θ)\n\nSince the sphere has a radius of 5, we have r = 5. The plane containing the great circle has the equation:\n\nN · (x, y, z) = 0\n(0, 0, 25) · (5 * sin(θ) * cos(φ), 5 * sin(θ) * sin(φ), 5 * cos(θ)) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n25 * cos(θ) = 0\n\nThis implies that θ = π/2, which means the great circle lies in the xy-plane.\n\nNow, we can parameterize the great circle using the angle φ:\n\nx = 5 * sin(π/2) * cos(φ) = 5 * cos(φ)\ny = 5 * sin(π/2) * sin(φ) = 5 * sin(φ)\nz = 5 * cos(π/2) = 0\n\nTo find the values of φ corresponding to points A and B, we can use the inverse trigonometric functions:\n\nφ_A = atan2(4, 3) ≈ 0.93 radians\nφ_B = atan2(-3, -4) ≈ -2.21 radians\n\nSo, the geodesic path on the surface of the sphere from point A to point B can be described by the parameterized great circle equation:\n\n(x, y, z) = (5 * cos(φ), 5 * sin(φ), 0)\n\nwhere φ ranges from 0.93 radians to -2.21 radians (or equivalently, from 0.93 radians to 4.07 radians)."
