    "message_2": "To determine the degree of membership of the number 7 in the fuzzy set A, we need to find the value of the membership function μA(x) at x = 7.\n\nAccording to the given membership function:\n\nμA(x) = {0 if x<5; (x-5)/5 if 5<=x<=10; 1 if x>10}\n\nSince 7 is between 5 and 10 (5<=7<=10), we will use the second part of the membership function:\n\nμA(7) = (7-5)/5 = 2/5 = 0.4\n\nTherefore, the degree of membership of the number 7 in the fuzzy set A is 0.4."
