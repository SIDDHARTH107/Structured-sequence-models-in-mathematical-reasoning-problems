    "message_2": "Let's first recall some basic facts about groups of order p^2, where p is a prime number. In our case, p = 3, so the order of G is 9.\n\n1. A group of order p^2 is either isomorphic to the cyclic group of order p^2 or the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p (i.e., Z_p × Z_p).\n\n2. In a cyclic group of order n, there is exactly one element of order d for each divisor d of n.\n\nNow, let's consider the two possible cases for G:\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_9.\n\nIn this case, there is exactly one element of order 3 in G (since 3 is a divisor of 9).\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to the direct product Z_3 × Z_3.\n\nIn this case, there are 3 elements of order 1 in G (the identity element in each component), and the remaining 6 elements have order 3.\n\nSo, in either case, there are at least 1 and at most 6 elements of order 3 in G. However, we can also use the following fact:\n\nFact: In a finite group, the number of elements of order d is a multiple of the Euler's totient function φ(d).\n\nIn our case, d = 3, and φ(3) = 2. Therefore, the number of elements of order 3 in G must be a multiple of 2. Since we already know that there are at least 1 and at most 6 elements of order 3 in G, the only possible number of elements of order 3 in G is 2 or 6.\n\nNow, let's use the fact that the sum of the orders of all elements in a group is equal to the order of the group. In our case, the sum of the orders of all elements in G is 9. If there are 2 elements of order 3 in G, then the sum of the orders of the remaining 7 elements must be 9 - 2 * 3 = 3. However, this is not possible, as the order of each element in a group must be at least 1.\n\nTherefore, the only possible number of elements of order 3 in G is 6."
