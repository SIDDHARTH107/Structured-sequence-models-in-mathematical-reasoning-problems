    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player A proposes a split of a $100 bill with Player B. Player B can either accept the split or reject it, in which case both players receive nothing. If Player B is willing to accept any offer greater than or equal to $30, what is the highest offer that Player A can make to ensure that Player B accepts the offer?",
    "message_2": "Since Player B is willing to accept any offer greater than or equal to $30, the highest offer that Player A can make to ensure that Player B accepts the offer is $70. This would result in a split of $70 for Player A and $30 for Player B."
