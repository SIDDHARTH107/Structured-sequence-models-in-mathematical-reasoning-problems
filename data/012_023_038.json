    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (i.e., the largest set of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge).\n\nLet's analyze the given graph:\n\nVertices: A, B, C, D, E\nEdges: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, DE\n\nWe can see that there is a complete subgraph with 4 vertices: A, B, C, and D. This is because every pair of these vertices is connected by an edge (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD). There is no complete subgraph with all 5 vertices since vertex E is only connected to vertex D.\n\nTherefore, the clique number of the given graph is 4."
