    "message_2": "To find the order, type, and zeros of the meromorphic function f(z) = z^3 / (z-1)^2, we first need to identify its poles and zeros.\n\nZeros:\nA zero of a meromorphic function is a point where the function equals zero. In this case, we need to find the values of z for which the numerator z^3 is equal to zero. This occurs when z = 0. Since the exponent of z in the numerator is 3, the zero at z = 0 has multiplicity 3.\n\nPoles:\nA pole of a meromorphic function is a point where the function goes to infinity. In this case, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator (z-1)^2 is equal to zero. This occurs when z = 1. Since the exponent of (z-1) in the denominator is 2, the pole at z = 1 has order 2.\n\nOrder:\nThe order of a meromorphic function is the maximum of the orders of its poles. In this case, the function has a single pole of order 2, so the order of the function is 2.\n\nType:\nThe type of a meromorphic function is the number of poles in the extended complex plane (including the point at infinity). In this case, the function has only one pole at z = 1, so the type of the function is 1.\n\nZeros: z = 0 with multiplicity 3\nOrder: 2\nType: 1"
