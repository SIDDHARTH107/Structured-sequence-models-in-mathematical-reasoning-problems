    "message_1": "Suppose you are observing a tree from a distance of 20 meters. If the angle of elevation to the top of the tree is 45 degrees, what is the height of the tree?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tree, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and the distance from the tree is 20 meters. We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(45) = height / 20\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = height / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the tree:\n\nheight = 20 * 1\n\nheight = 20 meters\n\nSo, the height of the tree is 20 meters."
