    "message_2": "A prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest prime gap after the number 200, we need to find the first pair of consecutive prime numbers after 200.\n\nThe prime numbers after 200 are 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, ...\n\nThe consecutive prime numbers with the smallest gap are 227 and 229. The prime gap between them is:\n\n229 - 227 = 2\n\nSo, the smallest prime gap that occurs after the number 200 is 2."
