    "message_1": "A student is given a topological space X with the following information: \n\n- X is a solid torus, i.e., an object in 3-dimensional Euclidean space that can be obtained by rotating a disk about a line in the plane of the disk that does not intersect the disk.\n- X has a differential form ω = (x + y) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz defined on it.\n\nThe question to be solved is: \n\nWhat is the De Rham cohomology group H^3(X) of X with respect to ω?",
    "message_2": "To compute the De Rham cohomology group H^3(X) of the solid torus X with respect to the differential form ω = (x + y) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz, we first need to understand the structure of the cohomology groups for a solid torus.\n\nA solid torus is a 3-dimensional manifold, and its De Rham cohomology groups are given by:\n\nH^0(X) = R (the constant functions)\nH^1(X) = R^2 (generated by the two non-contractible loops)\nH^2(X) = R (generated by the non-contractible 2-dimensional surface)\nH^3(X) = 0 (since the solid torus is a 3-dimensional manifold)\n\nNow, let's consider the given differential form ω = (x + y) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz. This is a 3-form on the solid torus X. Since H^3(X) = 0, there are no non-trivial 3-forms on X. Therefore, ω must be an exact form, meaning there exists a 2-form η such that dη = ω.\n\nIn conclusion, the De Rham cohomology group H^3(X) of the solid torus X with respect to the differential form ω = (x + y) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz is trivial, i.e., H^3(X) = 0."
