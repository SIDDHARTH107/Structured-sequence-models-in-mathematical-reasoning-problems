    "message_2": "To determine if f(z) is an analytic function, we need to check if it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations. First, let's rewrite f(z) in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let z = x + iy, where x and y are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit. Then,\n\nf(z) = (x + iy)^2 + 3(x + iy) + 2\n     = (x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy) + (3x + 3iy) + 2\n     = (x^2 - y^2 + 3x + 2) + i(2xy + 3y)\n\nNow, let u(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 + 3x + 2 and v(x, y) = 2xy + 3y. Then, f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y).\n\nTo check if f(z) is analytic, we need to verify if the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold:\n\n1. ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y\n2. ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂u/∂x = 2x + 3\n∂u/∂y = -2y\n∂v/∂x = 2y\n∂v/∂y = 2x + 3\n\nComparing the partial derivatives, we see that the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold:\n\n1. ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y (2x + 3 = 2x + 3)\n2. ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x (-2y = -2y)\n\nSince the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied, f(z) is an analytic function.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of f(z). The derivative of an analytic function can be found using either ∂u/∂x + i∂v/∂x or ∂v/∂y - i∂u/∂y (both expressions will give the same result). Let's use the first expression:\n\nf'(z) = ∂u/∂x + i∂v/∂x\n       = (2x + 3) + i(2y)\n\nSince z = x + iy, we can rewrite the derivative in terms of z:\n\nf'(z) = 2(x + iy) + 3\n       = 2z + 3\n\nSo, the derivative of f(z) = z^2 + 3z + 2 is f'(z) = 2z + 3."
