We can use the method of Ferrers diagrams to solve this problem.\n\nHere are the possible partitions of 10 into distinct parts:\n\n1. 10\n2. 9 + 1\n3. 8 + 2\n4. 7 + 3\n5. 6 + 4\n6. 6 + 3 + 1\n7. 5 + 4 + 1\n8. 5 + 3 + 2\n9. 4 + 3 + 2 + 1\n\nThere are 9 ways to partition the number 10 into distinct parts."
