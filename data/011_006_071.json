    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of $x^4$ in the generating function $G(x) = (1+x)^5$, we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that for any non-negative integer $n$ and any real numbers $a$ and $b$:\n\n$(a+b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$\n\nIn our case, $a = 1$, $b = x$, and $n = 5$. We want to find the coefficient of $x^4$, which means we need to find the term with $k = 4$:\n\n$\\binom{5}{4} (1)^{5-4} (x)^4 = \\binom{5}{4} (1)^1 (x)^4$\n\n$\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as:\n\n$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$\\binom{5}{4} = \\frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \\frac{5!}{4!1!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)(1)} = 5$\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into our expression:\n\n$5 (1)^1 (x)^4 = 5x^4$\n\nThus, the coefficient of $x^4$ in the generating function $G(x) = (1+x)^5$ is $\\boxed{5}$."
