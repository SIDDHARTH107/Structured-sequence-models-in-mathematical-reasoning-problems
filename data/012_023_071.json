    "message_2": "To find the clique number, we need to find the largest complete subgraph in the given graph. A complete subgraph is a subgraph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph:\n\nV = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nE = {{1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,4}, {2,5}, {2,6}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {5,6}}\n\nWe can see that there is a complete subgraph with vertices {1, 2, 4} and edges {{1,2}, {1,4}, {2,4}}. This is a 3-clique.\n\nThere is no 4-clique or larger in the graph, as no vertex has a degree of 4 or more.\n\nTherefore, the clique number of the given graph is 3."
