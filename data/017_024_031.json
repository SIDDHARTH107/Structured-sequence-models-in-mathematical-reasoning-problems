    "message_1": "How many non-isomorphic groups of order 96 are there, and can you determine which types of groups they are (cyclic, alternating, or non-abelian)?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we will use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. Therefore, we will consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor the Sylow 2-subgroups, by the Sylow theorems, the number of such subgroups must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. This gives us two possibilities: 1 or 3 Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nFor the Sylow 3-subgroups, the number of such subgroups must divide 32 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. This gives us two possibilities: 1 or 4 Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nNow, we consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. One Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup: In this case, the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and there is only one such group, which is cyclic (Z_96).\n\n2. One Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups: In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of its Sylow subgroups. There are two possible actions of the Sylow 3-subgroup on the Sylow 2-subgroup, giving us two non-isomorphic groups. Both of these groups are non-abelian.\n\n3. Three Sylow 2-subgroups and one Sylow 3-subgroup: In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of its Sylow subgroups. There are four possible actions of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the Sylow 3-subgroup, giving us four non-isomorphic groups. All of these groups are non-abelian.\n\n4. Three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups: In this case, there are no groups that satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 96. One of them is cyclic, and the other six are non-abelian. There are no alternating groups of order 96, as the smallest alternating group that is not cyclic is A_4, which has order 12."
