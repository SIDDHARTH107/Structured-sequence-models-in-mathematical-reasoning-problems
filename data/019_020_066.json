    "message_1": "What is the time complexity of a mathematical algorithm that can sort a list of 1000 numbers in ascending order using quicksort?",
    "message_2": "The time complexity of the quicksort algorithm depends on the choice of the pivot element and the distribution of the input data. In the best case, the time complexity is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the list. In the worst case, the time complexity is O(n^2). However, the average case is also O(n log n), which makes quicksort a popular and efficient sorting algorithm in practice."
