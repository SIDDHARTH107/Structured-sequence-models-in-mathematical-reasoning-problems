    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the algebraic variety defined by the polynomial function f(x, y) = x^3 - y^3 - xy^2, we need to compute the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y, and then find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - y^2\n∂f/∂y = -3y^2 - 2xy\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 - y^2 = 0  (1)\n-3y^2 - 2xy = 0  (2)\n\nFrom equation (2), we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny(-3y - 2x) = 0\ny = 0 or y = -2x/3\n\nNow, let's substitute these values of y into equation (1):\n\nCase 1: y = 0\n3x^2 - 0 = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo, one singularity is at the point (0, 0).\n\nCase 2: y = -2x/3\n3x^2 - (-2x/3)^2 = 0\n3x^2 - (4x^2/9) = 0\n(27x^2 - 4x^2)/9 = 0\n23x^2 = 0\nx = 0\n\nIn this case, y = -2x/3 = 0.\n\nSo, there is only one singularity at the point (0, 0)."
