    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of the composite number 8051 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random starting point x_0 and a function f(x) (usually f(x) = x^2 + 1).\n2. Generate a sequence of numbers using the function f(x) and the previous number in the sequence.\n3. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difference between two numbers in the sequence and the composite number.\n4. If the GCD is not 1 or the composite number, it is a non-trivial factor of the composite number.\n\nLet's start with x_0 = 2 and f(x) = x^2 + 1.\n\n1. x_1 = f(x_0) = f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5\n2. x_2 = f(x_1) = f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26\n3. GCD(x_2 - x_1, 8051) = GCD(26 - 5, 8051) = GCD(21, 8051) = 1 (no factor found)\n\nContinue the process:\n\n4. x_3 = f(x_2) = f(26) = 26^2 + 1 = 677\n5. GCD(x_3 - x_1, 8051) = GCD(677 - 5, 8051) = GCD(672, 8051) = 1 (no factor found)\n\nContinue the process:\n\n6. x_4 = f(x_3) = f(677) = 677^2 + 1 = 458330\n7. GCD(x_4 - x_2, 8051) = GCD(458330 - 26, 8051) = GCD(458304, 8051) = 83 (factor found)\n\nThe smallest prime factor of the composite number 8051 using Pollard's rho algorithm is 83."
