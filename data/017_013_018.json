    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 18, we will consider each of the cases mentioned.\n\n1. Cyclic group C18: There is only one cyclic group of order 18, which is generated by an element of order 18.\n\n2. Non-abelian group of order 18: There is only one non-abelian group of order 18, which is the semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 6. This group is non-abelian and not isomorphic to the cyclic group C18.\n\n3. Direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6: The cyclic group of order 3 has only one isomorphism class, which is C3. The group of order 6 has two isomorphism classes: the cyclic group C6 and the symmetric group S3. Therefore, there are two possible direct products: C3 x C6 and C3 x S3. Both of these groups are abelian and not isomorphic to the cyclic group C18 or the non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 18: the cyclic group C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, the direct product C3 x C6, and the direct product C3 x S3."
