The maximum amount of flow that can be sent through each connection per hour is shown in the table below:\n\n|Connection | Maximum Amount of Flow (liters/hour)|\n|-----------| --------------------------------------|\n|A to B     | 600                                        |\n|B to C     | 800                                        |\n|A to C     | 400                                        |\n|A to D     | 500                                        |\n|C to D     | 700                                        |\n|B to D     | 900                                        |\n\nWhat is the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from city A to city D through this network?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from city A to city D, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will start by finding the bottleneck capacities in each possible path from A to D.\n\nThere are three possible paths from A to D:\n\n1. A → B → C → D\n2. A → B → D\n3. A → C → D\n\nLet's find the bottleneck capacities for each path:\n\n1. A → B → C → D:\n   - A to B: 600 liters/hour\n   - B to C: 800 liters/hour\n   - C to D: 700 liters/hour\n   The bottleneck capacity for this path is the minimum of these values, which is 600 liters/hour.\n\n2. A → B → D:\n   - A to B: 600 liters/hour\n   - B to D: 900 liters/hour\n   The bottleneck capacity for this path is the minimum of these values, which is 600 liters/hour.\n\n3. A → C → D:\n   - A to C: 400 liters/hour\n   - C to D: 700 liters/hour\n   The bottleneck capacity for this path is the minimum of these values, which is 400 liters/hour.\n\nNow, we will find the maximum flow by adding the bottleneck capacities of the paths:\n\nMaximum flow = 600 (A → B → C → D) + 600 (A → B → D) + 400 (A → C → D) = 1600 liters/hour.\n\nSo, the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from city A to city D through this network is 1600 liters/hour."
