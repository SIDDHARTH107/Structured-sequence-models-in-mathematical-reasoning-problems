    "message_1": "A store sells a product for $50 and has a fixed cost of $500 to produce it. The demand function for the product is given by: \nQ = 500 - 10P\nwhere Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price. \n\nWhat price should the store set to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we first need to find the revenue function, which is the product of the price and the quantity demanded: R(P) = P * Q. Then, we'll find the cost function, which is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost (the product of the price and the quantity produced). Finally, we'll find the profit function, which is the difference between the revenue and the cost functions, and then we'll find the price that maximizes the profit.\n\n1. Find the revenue function:\nR(P) = P * Q = P * (500 - 10P)\n\n2. Find the cost function:\nThe fixed cost is $500, and the variable cost is the product of the price and the quantity produced. Since the quantity produced is equal to the quantity demanded, the variable cost is P * Q. So, the cost function is:\nC(P) = 500 + P * Q = 500 + P * (500 - 10P)\n\n3. Find the profit function:\nProfit(P) = Revenue(P) - Cost(P) = R(P) - C(P)\n\n4. Substitute the revenue and cost functions into the profit function:\nProfit(P) = (P * (500 - 10P)) - (500 + P * (500 - 10P))\n\n5. Simplify the profit function:\nProfit(P) = (500P - 10P^2) - (500 + 500P - 10P^2)\nProfit(P) = -10P^2 + 500P - 500\n\n6. To find the price that maximizes the profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking the first derivative with respect to P and setting it equal to 0:\nd(Profit)/dP = -20P + 500 = 0\n\n7. Solve for P:\n-20P + 500 = 0\n20P = 500\nP = 25\n\nSo, the store should set the price at $25 to maximize its profit."
