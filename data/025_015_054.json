    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane passing through the points (1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), and (3, 4, 5), we first need to find the normal vector of the plane.\n\nLet A(1, 2, 3), B(2, 3, 4), and C(3, 4, 5). We can find two vectors on the plane by subtracting the coordinates of A from B and C:\n\nVector AB = B - A = (2 - 1, 3 - 2, 4 - 3) = (1, 1, 1)\nVector AC = C - A = (3 - 1, 4 - 2, 5 - 3) = (2, 2, 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the cross product of these two vectors to get the normal vector of the plane:\n\nN = AB Ã— AC\n\nHowever, we can see that AB and AC are parallel vectors (AC = 2 * AB), so their cross product will be the zero vector. This means that the points are collinear, and there is no unique plane that passes through all three points."
