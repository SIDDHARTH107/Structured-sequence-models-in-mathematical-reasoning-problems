    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors u and v using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of u and v:\n\n|u| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|v| = √(5² + (-1)²) = √(25 + 1) = √26\n\nNow, let's find the angle between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (|u| |v|)\n\nwhere u · v is the dot product of u and v. To find the dot product, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = u₁v₁ + u₂v₂\n\nu · v = (3)(5) + (4)(-1) = 15 - 4 = 11\n\nNow, we can find the angle between the two vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (11) / (5 * √26)\n\nNow, we can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ) = 5 * √26 * (11) / (5 * √26) = 11\n\nSo, the dot product of u and v is 11."
