    "message_2": "To find the solution to this homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 2 -3  2 | 0 ]\n[-3  7 -5 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2:\n```\n[ 2 -3  2 | 0 ]\n[ 1  2 -1 | 0 ]\n[-3  7 -5 | 0 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-1/2) * Row 1 + Row 2:\n```\n[  2  -3   2 | 0 ]\n[  0   3.5 -1.5 | 0 ]\n[ -3   7  -5 | 0 ]\n```\n\n3. Replace Row 3 with (3/2) * Row 1 + Row 3:\n```\n[  2  -3   2 | 0 ]\n[  0  3.5 -1.5 | 0 ]\n[  0   1.5 -2.5 | 0 ]\n```\n\n4. Replace Row 3 with (2/7) * Row 2 + Row 3:\n```\n[  2  -3   2 | 0 ]\n[  0  3.5 -1.5 | 0 ]\n[  0   0  -2 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we can write the system of linear equations from the row-echelon form:\n\n```\n2x - 3y + 2z = 0\n3.5y - 1.5z = 0\n-2z = 0\n```\n\nFrom the third equation, we have z = 0. Now, we can use back-substitution to find y and x:\n\n```\n3.5y - 1.5z = 0\n3.5y = 1.5 * 0\ny = 0\n```\n\n```\n2x - 3y + 2z = 0\n2x = 3 * 0 - 2 * 0\nx = 0\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
