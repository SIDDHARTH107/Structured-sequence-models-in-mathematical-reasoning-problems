    "message_1": "A student needs to find the period and amplitude of the given trigonometric function: \nf(x) = 4cos(3x + π/4)\nWhat is the period and amplitude of this function?",
    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the given trigonometric function, we need to analyze the function:\n\nf(x) = 4cos(3x + π/4)\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a trigonometric function is the absolute value of the coefficient of the cosine or sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 4. Therefore, the amplitude is |4| = 4.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a trigonometric function is the length of one complete cycle of the function. For the cosine and sine functions, the period is determined by the coefficient of the variable x inside the function. In this case, the coefficient is 3. The period of the basic cosine function is 2π. To find the period of the given function, we divide the period of the basic cosine function by the coefficient of x:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / 3\n\nSo, the period of the given function is (2π) / 3.\n\nIn conclusion, the amplitude of the function f(x) = 4cos(3x + π/4) is 4, and the period is (2π) / 3."
