    "message_1": "A factory produces 500 units of a product every day. The probability of any one unit being defective is 0.05. What is the probability that exactly 25 units are defective in a given week (7 days)?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective units\n- n is the total number of units produced in a week\n- k is the number of defective units we want to find the probability for (25 in this case)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k defective units from n total units, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of a unit being defective (0.05)\n- 1-p is the probability of a unit not being defective (0.95)\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of units produced in a week:\n\nUnits produced per day = 500\nDays in a week = 7\nTotal units produced in a week (n) = 500 * 7 = 3500\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 25) = (3500C25) * (0.05^25) * (0.95^(3500-25))\n\nCalculating the combinations (3500C25):\n\n3500! / (25!(3500-25)!) = 3500! / (25! * 3475!)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the factorial and combinations, we get:\n\n(3500C25) = 2.407e+23 (approximately)\n\nNow, let's calculate the other parts of the formula:\n\n(0.05^25) = 9.313e-34 (approximately)\n(0.95^(3500-25)) = (0.95^3475) = 1.798e-60 (approximately)\n\nFinally, we can multiply all the values together:\n\nP(X = 25) = 2.407e+23 * 9.313e-34 * 1.798e-60 = 3.982e-70 (approximately)\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 25 defective units in a week is approximately 3.982e-70."
