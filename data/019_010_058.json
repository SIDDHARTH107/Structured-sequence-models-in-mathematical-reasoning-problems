    "message_2": "In linear logic, the symbols ⊗, ⊸ represent linear logic connectives. The ⊗ symbol represents the \"tensor\" or \"multiplicative conjunction\" operation, and the ⊸ symbol represents the \"linear implication\" operation. However, these operations are not directly applicable to numerical values like A=2, B=3, and C=5.\n\nIt seems like there might be some confusion in the problem statement. If you meant a different type of equation or operation, please provide more information or clarify the problem, and I'd be happy to help you solve it."
