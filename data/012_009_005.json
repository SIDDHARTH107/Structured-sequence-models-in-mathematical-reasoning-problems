    "message_2": "Yes, this degree sequence is possible. To show this, we can construct a labeled graph with this degree sequence.\n\nLet's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. We can assign the degrees as follows:\n\nA: 3\nB: 3\nC: 3\nD: 2\nE: 2\nF: 1\nG: 1\n\nNow, we can draw the graph by connecting the vertices according to their degrees:\n\n1. Connect A, B, and C to form a triangle (A-B, B-C, and C-A). This will give each of them a degree of 2.\n2. Connect D to A and B (D-A and D-B). This will give D a degree of 2 and increase the degrees of A and B to 3.\n3. Connect E to B and C (E-B and E-C). This will give E a degree of 2 and increase the degree of C to 3.\n4. Connect F to A (F-A). This will give F a degree of 1.\n5. Connect G to C (G-C). This will give G a degree of 1.\n\nThe resulting graph has the desired degree sequence {3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1}."
