    "message_2": "Wilson's theorem states that for a natural number p greater than 1, p is a prime number if and only if (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p).\n\nThe least positive integer greater than 1 for which Wilson's theorem is not true would be a composite number (non-prime) that satisfies the congruence (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p). However, no such composite number exists, as Wilson's theorem is a proven result that holds for all prime and composite numbers greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, there is no least positive integer greater than 1 for which Wilson's theorem is not true."
