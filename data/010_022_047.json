    "message_2": "First, let's find the equation of the circle $C$. Since it has a radius of 4 and is centered at the origin, its equation is:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 = 4^2 = 16$\n\nNow, we are given the equation of the line $L$ as $y = 8$. We want to find the points of intersection between $C$ and $L$. To do this, we can substitute the equation of $L$ into the equation of $C$:\n\n$x^2 + (8)^2 = 16$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$x^2 = 16 - 64 = -48$\n\nSince there is no real solution for $x^2 = -48$, there are no points of intersection between the circle $C$ and the line $L$. Therefore, we cannot find the points of intersection closest to and farthest from the point $P$."
