    "message_1": "How many non-abelian groups of order 72 are there and what are they? Provide the list of all non-abelian groups of order 72 along with their structures (i.e. their multiplication tables).",
    "message_2": "There are 9 non-abelian groups of order 72. The list of these groups is as follows:\n\n1. S_3 × Z_4 × Z_3\n2. S_3 × Z_2 × Z_6\n3. S_3 × Z_12\n4. S_3 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_3 × Z_3\n5. S_3 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_9\n6. S_3 × Z_2 × Z_18\n7. S_3 × Z_36\n8. S_3 × Z_4 × Z_9\n9. S_3 × Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_3\n\nHowever, providing the complete multiplication tables for all these groups is not feasible in this format, as each table would have 72 rows and 72 columns, resulting in a total of 5184 entries per table. Instead, I will provide a brief description of the structure of each group.\n\n1. S_3 × Z_4 × Z_3: Direct product of the symmetric group of degree 3, a cyclic group of order 4, and a cyclic group of order 3.\n2. S_3 × Z_2 × Z_6: Direct product of the symmetric group of degree 3, a cyclic group of order 2, and a cyclic group of order 6.\n3. S_3 × Z_12: Direct product of the symmetric group of degree 3 and a cyclic group of order 12.\n4. S_3 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_3 × Z_3: Direct product of the symmetric group of degree 3, two cyclic groups of order 2, and two cyclic groups of order 3.\n5. S_3 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_9: Direct product of the symmetric group of degree 3, two cyclic groups of order 2, and a cyclic group of order 9.\n6. S_3 × Z_2 × Z_18: Direct product of the symmetric group of degree 3, a cyclic group of order 2, and a cyclic group of order 18.\n7. S_3 × Z_36: Direct product of the symmetric group of degree 3 and a cyclic group of order 36.\n8. S_3 × Z_4 × Z_9: Direct product of the symmetric group of degree 3, a cyclic group of order 4, and a cyclic group of order 9.\n9. S_3 × Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_3: Direct product of the symmetric group of degree 3, a cyclic group of order 4, and two cyclic groups of order 3.\n\nTo study these groups further, you can use software like GAP (Groups, Algorithms, Programming) or Magma to explore their properties and generate their multiplication tables."
