    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is defined as:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞\n\nFor the given function f(x) = e^(-x^2/2), we need to find its Fourier transform F(k):\n\nF(k) = ∫[e^(-x^2/2) * e^(-2πikx)] dx, from -∞ to ∞\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the Gaussian integral formula:\n\n∫[e^(-ax^2)] dx = √(π/a), from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we need to rewrite the integral in the form of a Gaussian integral. We can do this by completing the square in the exponent:\n\n-x^2/2 - 2πikx = -(x^2 + 4πikx)/2\n\nNow, complete the square:\n\n-(x^2 + 4πikx + (2πk)^2)/2 + (2πk)^2/2 = -(x + 2πik)^2/2 + (2πk)^2/2\n\nNow, substitute this back into the integral:\n\nF(k) = e^((2πk)^2/2) * ∫[e^(-(x + 2πik)^2/2)] dx, from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we can use the Gaussian integral formula:\n\nF(k) = e^((2πk)^2/2) * √(π/(1/2)) = e^((2πk)^2/2) * √(2π)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-x^2/2) is F(k) = e^((2πk)^2/2) * √(2π)."
