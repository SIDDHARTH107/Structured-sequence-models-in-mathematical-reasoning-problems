    "message_2": "The Henon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, and its equations of motion are given by:\n\ndx/dt = p_x\ndy/dt = p_y\ndp_x/dt = -x - 2 * α * x * y\ndp_y/dt = -y - α * (x^2 - y^2)\n\nwith initial conditions (x, y, p_x, p_y) = (1, 0, 0, 1) and parameter values α = 1 and β = 1.\n\nTo compute the maximum Lyapunov exponent (MLE) for this system, we need to numerically integrate the equations of motion along with the variational equations to obtain the time evolution of the tangent vector. The MLE is then given by the exponential growth rate of the tangent vector.\n\nThe variational equations for the Henon-Heiles system are:\n\ndξ_x/dt = ξ_p_x\ndξ_y/dt = ξ_p_y\ndξ_p_x/dt = -ξ_x - 2 * α * (y * ξ_x + x * ξ_y)\ndξ_p_y/dt = -ξ_y - α * (2 * x * ξ_x - 2 * y * ξ_y)\n\nwith initial conditions for the tangent vector ξ = (ξ_x, ξ_y, ξ_p_x, ξ_p_y) = (1, 0, 0, 0).\n\nNumerically integrating these equations and computing the MLE requires specialized numerical methods and software. It is not possible to provide an exact value for the MLE without performing these numerical calculations.\n\nHowever, you can use software like Python with the SciPy library or MATLAB to perform the numerical integration and compute the MLE for the given initial conditions and parameter values."
