    "message_1": "A student needs to assign five tasks (A, B, C, D, E) to five workers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Each worker can only handle one task, and each task must be assigned to one worker. The time required for each worker to complete each task is given in the table below:\n\n|      | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n|------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 |\n| B | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |\n| C | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |\n| D | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |\n| E | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |\n\nThe goal is to find the assignment that minimizes the total time required for all tasks to be completed. What is the optimal assignment, and what is the total time required?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal assignment, we can use the Hungarian Algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Find the smallest element in each row and subtract it from all elements in that row.\n   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n   |---|---|---|---|---|---|\n   | A | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n   | B | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n   | C | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n   | D | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n   | E | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n\n2. Find the smallest element in each column and subtract it from all elements in that column.\n   The matrix is already reduced, so no changes are needed.\n\n3. Cover all zeros in the matrix using the minimum number of lines (rows and columns).\n   We can cover all zeros using 3 lines: one horizontal line through row A, one horizontal line through row B, and one vertical line through column 1.\n\n4. Since the number of lines (3) is less than the number of tasks/workers (5), we need to continue with the algorithm.\n\n5. Find the smallest uncovered element (1) and subtract it from all uncovered elements. Add it to the elements that are covered by two lines. Leave the covered elements unchanged.\n   |   | 1 | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |\n   |---|---|----|----|----|----|\n   | A | 0 | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |\n   | B | 0 | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |\n   | C | 0 | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |\n   | D | 0 | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |\n   | E | 0 | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the number of lines equals the number of tasks/workers.\n   We can now cover all zeros using 5 lines: one horizontal line through row A, one horizontal line through row B, one horizontal line through row C, one vertical line through column 1, and one vertical line through column 2.\n\n7. Find the optimal assignment by selecting a zero from each row and column.\n   A possible optimal assignment is:\n   - Task A to Worker 1\n   - Task B to Worker 2\n   - Task C to Worker 3\n   - Task D to Worker 4\n   - Task E to Worker 5\n\n8. Calculate the total time required for this assignment.\n   Total time = 9 (A1) + 8 (B2) + 12 (C3) + 11 (D4) + 15 (E5) = 55\n\nThe optimal assignment is A1, B2, C3, D4, and E5, with a total time required of 55."
