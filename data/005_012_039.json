    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces light bulbs, and the standard deviation in the length of these bulbs is known to be 0.5 cm. A sample of 25 bulbs is chosen at random, and the lengths are measured. What is the probability that the sample mean length of the bulbs is within 0.1 cm of the population mean length? (Assume the population mean length to be 8 cm.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normally distributed if the sample size is large enough (n ≥ 30) or if the population is normally distributed. In this case, we will assume that the population of light bulb lengths is normally distributed.\n\nGiven:\nPopulation mean (μ) = 8 cm\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = 0.5 cm\nSample size (n) = 25\nMargin of error (E) = 0.1 cm\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nStandard deviation of the sample mean (σ_x̄) = σ / √n\n\nσ_x̄ = 0.5 cm / √25\nσ_x̄ = 0.5 cm / 5\nσ_x̄ = 0.1 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean length is within 0.1 cm of the population mean length. This means we want to find the probability that the sample mean is between 7.9 cm and 8.1 cm.\n\nTo do this, we will use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_x̄\n\nFor the lower bound (7.9 cm):\n\nz1 = (7.9 - 8) / 0.1\nz1 = -0.1 / 0.1\nz1 = -1\n\nFor the upper bound (8.1 cm):\n\nz2 = (8.1 - 8) / 0.1\nz2 = 0.1 / 0.1\nz2 = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is between -1 and 1. We can look this up in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator or software that can compute the cumulative probability.\n\nP(-1 < z < 1) = P(z < 1) - P(z < -1)\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n\nP(z < 1) ≈ 0.8413\nP(z < -1) ≈ 0.1587\n\nP(-1 < z < 1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587\nP(-1 < z < 1) ≈ 0.6826\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean length of the bulbs is within 0.1 cm of the population mean length is approximately 68.26%."
