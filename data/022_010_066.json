    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the given function, we first perform partial fraction decomposition. We have:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^3 + z^2} = \\frac{1}{z^2(z + 1)}$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite this as:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{A}{z} + \\frac{B}{z^2} + \\frac{C}{z + 1}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $z^2(z + 1)$, we get:\n\n$$1 = A(z^2)(z + 1) + B(z)(z + 1) + C(z^2)$$\n\nNow, we can solve for A, B, and C by setting z to specific values:\n\n1. Set $z = 0$:\n\n$$1 = A(0)(1) + B(0)(1) + C(0) \\Rightarrow C = 0$$\n\n2. Set $z = -1$:\n\n$$1 = A(1)(0) + B(-1)(0) + 0 \\Rightarrow \\text{No new information}$$\n\n3. Differentiate both sides with respect to z:\n\n$$0 = A(3z^2 + 2z) + B(2z + 1)$$\n\nNow, set $z = 0$:\n\n$$0 = A(0) + B(1) \\Rightarrow B = 0$$\n\nSo, we have $A = 1$ and $B = C = 0$. Thus, our function becomes:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$$\n\nSince this is already a Laurent series, we don't need to expand it further. The radius of convergence is infinite, as the series converges for all $z \\neq 0$. On an Argand diagram, the region of convergence would be the entire complex plane, excluding the origin (0, 0)."
