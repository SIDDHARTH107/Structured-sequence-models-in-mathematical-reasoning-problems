    "message_1": "A math student needs to solve the following trigonometric equation:\n\n2sin(x) = √3\n\nThe student needs to find the value(s) of x (in degrees or radians) that satisfies this equation within the given domain.",
    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation 2sin(x) = √3, we first need to isolate x. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nsin(x) = (√3) / 2\n\nNow we need to find the angle x for which the sine function equals (√3) / 2. We know that sin(60°) = sin(π/3) = (√3) / 2. However, since the sine function is periodic, there are more solutions within the given domain. The general solution for x can be written as:\n\nx = nπ + (-1)^n * (π/3)\n\nwhere n is an integer. This general solution will give all possible values of x that satisfy the equation 2sin(x) = √3 within the given domain. If a specific domain is provided, we can find the specific values of x that satisfy the equation within that domain by substituting different integer values for n."
