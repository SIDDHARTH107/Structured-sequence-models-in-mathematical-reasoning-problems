    "message_2": "Assume for the sake of contradiction that A is not closed. Then there exists a point x ∈ X \\ A such that x is a limit point of A. This means that for every open neighborhood U of x, U ∩ A ≠ ∅.\n\nSince X is Hausdorff, for each a ∈ A, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods U_a containing a and V_a containing x. The collection {U_a | a ∈ A} is an open cover of A. Since A is compact, there exists a finite subcover {U_{a_1}, U_{a_2}, ..., U_{a_n}}. Let V = V_{a_1} ∩ V_{a_2} ∩ ... ∩ V_{a_n}. V is an open neighborhood of x.\n\nNow, V ∩ A = ∅, because if there were a point a ∈ A ∩ V, then a would be in some U_{a_i}, but U_{a_i} and V_{a_i} are disjoint by construction. This contradicts the assumption that x is a limit point of A, since we have found an open neighborhood V of x such that V ∩ A = ∅.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that A is not closed must be false, and A is indeed closed."
