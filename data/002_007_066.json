    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 12 cm and the top base measures 10 cm while the bottom base measures 18 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (top base + bottom base) * height\n\nIn this case, the top base is 10 cm, the bottom base is 18 cm, and the height is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (10 + 18) * 12\nArea = (1/2) * (28) * 12\nArea = 14 * 12\nArea = 168 cmÂ²\n\nSo the area of the trapezoid is 168 square centimeters."
