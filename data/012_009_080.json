    "message_2": "No, it is not possible for such a graph to exist. To justify this answer, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nIn this case, the degree sequence is (4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0), so the sum of the degrees is 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 11. According to the Handshaking Lemma, this sum should be an even number (since it is equal to twice the number of edges), but 11 is an odd number. Therefore, a graph with this degree sequence cannot exist."
