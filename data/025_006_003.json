    "message_2": "To compute the first cohomology group $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, we will use the long exact sequence in cohomology associated with the exponential sequence of sheaves on $X$. The exponential sequence is given by:\n\n$$0 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}_X \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}_X^* \\rightarrow 0$$\n\nHere, $\\mathcal{O}_X$ is the sheaf of holomorphic functions on $X$, and $\\mathcal{O}_X^*$ is the sheaf of nowhere vanishing holomorphic functions on $X$. Taking the cohomology of this sequence, we get the long exact sequence:\n\n$$0 \\rightarrow H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\rightarrow H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X^*) \\rightarrow H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\rightarrow \\cdots$$\n\nNow, we compute the relevant cohomology groups:\n\n1. $H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, since the global sections of the constant sheaf $\\mathbb{Z}$ are just the integers.\n\n2. $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = \\mathbb{C}$, since the global holomorphic functions on a compact complex manifold are constant.\n\n3. $H^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X^*) = \\mathbb{C}^*$, since the global nowhere vanishing holomorphic functions on a compact complex manifold are constant and nonzero.\n\n4. $H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) = 0$, since $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{C}^3$ and thus has trivial first cohomology by the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem.\n\nNow, we have the following exact sequence:\n\n$$0 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^* \\rightarrow H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow 0$$\n\nThe map from $\\mathbb{C}$ to $\\mathbb{C}^*$ is given by the exponential map $z \\mapsto e^z$. The kernel of this map is $2\\pi i \\mathbb{Z}$, which is the image of the map from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{C}^*/2\\pi i \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$$\n\nSo, the first cohomology group of $X$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$."
