    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at point c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, we can consider the position function of the car, s(t), which is continuous and differentiable. We are given the car's speed at different intervals, and we need to find the average speed over the entire journey.\n\nFirst, let's find the total distance traveled by the car. In the first 2 hours, the car travels at a speed of 60 km/hr. So, the distance covered in the first 2 hours is:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\nDistance = 60 km/hr × 2 hr = 120 km\n\nIn the next 1 hour, the car travels at a speed of 80 km/hr. So, the distance covered in the next hour is:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\nDistance = 80 km/hr × 1 hr = 80 km\n\nNow, let's find the total distance traveled by the car over the entire 3-hour journey:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance in first 2 hours + Distance in next 1 hour\nTotal Distance = 120 km + 80 km = 200 km\n\nTo find the average speed of the car, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n\nTotal Time = 2 hr (first part) + 1 hr (second part) = 3 hr\n\nAverage Speed = 200 km / 3 hr = 66.67 km/hr\n\nSo, the average speed of the car over the 3-hour journey is 66.67 km/hr."
