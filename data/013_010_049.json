    "message_1": "Consider two firms A and B in a Cournot duopoly setting with the demand function given by P = 120 - Q, where Q is the total quantity supplied by both firms. The marginal cost of production for firm A is 10 and for firm B is 20. What is the Nash equilibrium quantity supplied by each firm and the resulting market price?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium quantity supplied by each firm and the resulting market price, we first need to find the reaction functions for both firms. The reaction function shows the optimal quantity a firm should produce given the quantity produced by the other firm.\n\nLet qA and qB be the quantities produced by firm A and firm B, respectively. Then, Q = qA + qB.\n\nThe profit function for firm A is given by:\nπA = (P - MC_A) * qA = (120 - Q - 10) * qA = (110 - qA - qB) * qA\n\nTo maximize its profit, firm A will choose qA such that its marginal profit is equal to its marginal cost:\nd(πA)/dqA = 110 - 2qA - qB = 10 (MC_A)\n\nSimilarly, the profit function for firm B is given by:\nπB = (P - MC_B) * qB = (120 - Q - 20) * qB = (100 - qA - qB) * qB\n\nTo maximize its profit, firm B will choose qB such that its marginal profit is equal to its marginal cost:\nd(πB)/dqB = 100 - qA - 2qB = 20 (MC_B)\n\nNow we have the reaction functions for both firms:\n1) 100 - 2qA - qB = 10\n2) 80 - qA - 2qB = 20\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\nqA = 30\nqB = 20\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium quantity supplied by firm A is 30 units, and by firm B is 20 units. The total quantity supplied in the market is Q = qA + qB = 30 + 20 = 50.\n\nNow, we can find the resulting market price using the demand function:\nP = 120 - Q = 120 - 50 = 70\n\nThus, the Nash equilibrium quantities supplied by each firm are 30 units for firm A and 20 units for firm B, and the resulting market price is 70."
