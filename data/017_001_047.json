    "message_2": "To prove whether G is isomorphic to C4 or V4, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on its order and the properties of its elements.\n\nFirst, let's recall some definitions and theorems:\n\n1. A group G is called cyclic if there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g. In this case, g is called a generator of G.\n\n2. The order of an element g in a group G is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e, where e is the identity element of G.\n\n3. Lagrange's Theorem: In a finite group G, the order of any subgroup H of G divides the order of G.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible structures of G:\n\nSince G has order 4, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 4. Note that the identity element has order 1, and there must be at least one element of order 2 or 4.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\n\nIf G has an element of order 4, say g, then G = {e, g, g^2, g^3}. In this case, G is a cyclic group generated by g, and G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: G has no elements of order 4, but has an element of order 2.\n\nIn this case, let's say G = {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element, and a, b, and c are elements of order 2. Then, we have:\n\na^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e\n\nNow, let's consider the product of two distinct elements, say ab. Since a and b have order 2, (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = ee = e. Therefore, ab has order 2. Since a and b are distinct, ab cannot be equal to a or b. Also, ab cannot be equal to e, as a and b are non-identity elements. Thus, ab = c.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that bc = a and ac = b. Therefore, G is a group with elements {e, a, b, c} satisfying:\n\na^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e\nab = c\nbc = a\nac = b\n\nThis is precisely the structure of the Klein four-group V4. Hence, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, a group G of order 4 is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C4 if it has an element of order 4, or isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4 if it has no elements of order 4 but has elements of order 2."
