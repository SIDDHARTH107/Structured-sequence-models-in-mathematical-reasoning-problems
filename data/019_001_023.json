    "message_1": "Let's say a math student wants to make a purchase and has two discount coupons: one for 20% off and another for $15 off. The store allows the use of only one coupon per purchase. If the original price of the item is $80, which coupon would result in a bigger discount and what would be the final price after the discount?",
    "message_2": "Let's calculate the discount for each coupon and compare them.\n\n1. 20% off coupon:\nDiscount = 20% of $80 = (20/100) * $80 = $16\nFinal price = Original price - Discount = $80 - $16 = $64\n\n2. $15 off coupon:\nDiscount = $15\nFinal price = Original price - Discount = $80 - $15 = $65\n\nComparing the two discounts, the 20% off coupon results in a bigger discount. The final price after using the 20% off coupon would be $64."
