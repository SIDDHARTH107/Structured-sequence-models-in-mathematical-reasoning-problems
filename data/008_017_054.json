    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first represent the system in matrix form:\n\nA = | 3  4  0 |   X = | x |   B = |  6  |\n    | 0  2 -5 |       | y |       | -7  |\n    | 0  0  6 |       | z |       | 18  |\n\nNow, we can represent the matrix A as a sparse matrix since it has some zero elements. The sparse matrix representation of A is:\n\nA_sparse = {(0, 0): 3, (0, 1): 4, (1, 1): 2, (1, 2): -5, (2, 2): 6}\n\nNow, we can solve the system of linear equations using back-substitution:\n\n1. Solve for z: 6z = 18 => z = 18 / 6 => z = 3\n2. Solve for y: 2y - 5z = -7 => 2y - 5(3) = -7 => 2y - 15 = -7 => 2y = 8 => y = 4\n3. Solve for x: 3x + 4y = 6 => 3x + 4(4) = 6 => 3x + 16 = 6 => 3x = -10 => x = -10/3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = -10/3\ny = 4\nz = 3"
