The player who removes the last stone wins the game. If A goes first and N = 5, who has a winning strategy?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the possible moves for each player:\n\n1. If A removes 1 stone, then there are 4 stones left. B can remove 1 or 2 stones.\n   a) If B removes 1 stone, there are 3 stones left for A. A can remove 1 or 2 stones.\n      i) If A removes 1 stone, there are 2 stones left for B. B removes both stones and wins.\n      ii) If A removes 2 stones, there is 1 stone left for B. B removes the last stone and wins.\n   b) If B removes 2 stones, there are 2 stones left for A. A removes both stones and wins.\n\n2. If A removes 2 stones, then there are 3 stones left. B can remove 1 or 2 stones.\n   a) If B removes 1 stone, there are 2 stones left for A. A removes both stones and wins.\n   b) If B removes 2 stones, there is 1 stone left for A. A removes the last stone and wins.\n\nAs we can see, no matter what B does, A has a winning strategy. So, in this case, player A has a winning strategy when N = 5."
