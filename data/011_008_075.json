    "message_1": "In how many ways can you arrange 5 distinct books on a shelf if 2 of them (A and B) must be kept together and another 2 (C and D) must be kept together as well?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can treat the pairs of books (A and B) and (C and D) as single entities. So, we have 3 entities to arrange: the pair (A, B), the pair (C, D), and the remaining book E. We can arrange these 3 entities in 3! = 6 ways.\n\nNow, within each pair, we can arrange the books in 2! = 2 ways. So, for the pair (A, B), we have 2 ways (AB or BA), and for the pair (C, D), we also have 2 ways (CD or DC).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 5 distinct books on a shelf with the given conditions is:\n\n(3! ways to arrange the entities) × (2! ways to arrange A and B) × (2! ways to arrange C and D) = 6 × 2 × 2 = 24 ways."
