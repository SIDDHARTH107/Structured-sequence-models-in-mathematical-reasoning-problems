    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Outlier Detection:\n\nA statistics class of 20 students took a test and received the following scores: \n\n55, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 105, and 110.\n\nDetermine the outlier(s) using the 1.5 x IQR rule.",
    "message_2": "To find the outliers using the 1.5 x IQR rule, we first need to find the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n\nStep 1: Arrange the data in ascending order:\n55, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 105, 110\n\nStep 2: Find Q1 (the median of the first half) and Q3 (the median of the second half):\nSince there are 20 data points, we can divide the data into two equal halves of 10 data points each.\n\nFirst half: 55, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 93, 94\nSecond half: 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 105, 110\n\nQ1 = Median of the first half = (80 + 85) / 2 = 82.5\nQ3 = Median of the second half = (99 + 100) / 2 = 99.5\n\nStep 3: Calculate the IQR:\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 99.5 - 82.5 = 17\n\nStep 4: Calculate the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\nLower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 82.5 - 1.5 * 17 = 82.5 - 25.5 = 57\nUpper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 99.5 + 1.5 * 17 = 99.5 + 25.5 = 125\n\nStep 5: Identify the outliers:\nAny data point below the lower bound or above the upper bound is considered an outlier. In this case, the score 55 is below the lower bound (57), and the score 110 is above the upper bound (125).\n\nSo, the outliers are 55 and 110."
