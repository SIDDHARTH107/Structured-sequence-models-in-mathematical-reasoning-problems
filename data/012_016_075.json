    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of a graph G, we need to know the specific structure of the graph. The Tutte polynomial, T_G(x, y), is a two-variable polynomial that encodes various properties of the graph G, such as the number of spanning trees, the number of connected components, and the chromatic polynomial.\n\nSince you only provided the number of vertices (6) and edges (8) of the graph G, we cannot determine the exact structure of the graph and therefore cannot compute the Tutte polynomial. Please provide more information about the graph, such as the adjacency matrix or the list of edges, and we can then compute the Tutte polynomial for you."
