    "message_1": "Consider a square with sides of length 2. We want to subdivide this square into triangles using the following procedure: First, we draw a line through the center of the square parallel to one of its sides. Then, we draw a line through the center of each resulting rectangle parallel to the other side of the square. Finally, we draw a diagonal in each resulting square. How many triangles are in this subdivision?",
    "message_2": "When we draw a line through the center of the square parallel to one of its sides, we get two rectangles. Then, when we draw a line through the center of each resulting rectangle parallel to the other side of the square, we get four smaller squares. Finally, when we draw a diagonal in each resulting square, we get 2 triangles per square.\n\nSince there are 4 squares, we have a total of 4 * 2 = 8 triangles in this subdivision."
