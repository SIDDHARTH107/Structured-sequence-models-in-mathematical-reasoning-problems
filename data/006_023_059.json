    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected customer will make a purchase, we can simply use the percentage of customers who make a purchase.\n\nSince 45% of the customers make a purchase, the probability that a randomly selected customer will make a purchase is 45% or 0.45 (as a decimal)."
