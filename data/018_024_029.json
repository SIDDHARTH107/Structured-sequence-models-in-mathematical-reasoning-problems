    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}. Find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and its complement, and then find the symmetric difference of the complements of A and B. Show that the two results are not equal, thus proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A ∆ B, denoted as (A ∆ B)'.\nAssuming the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B, then U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The complement of a set is the set of elements in the universal set that are not in the given set.\n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {1, 2, 5, 6} = {3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and its complement, (A ∆ B) ∆ (A ∆ B)'.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ (A ∆ B)' = {1, 2, 5, 6} ∆ {3, 4} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNext, let's find the complements of A and B, denoted as A' and B'.\n\nA' = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {1, 2, 3, 4} = {5, 6}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4, 5, 6} = {1, 2}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the complements of A and B, A' ∆ B'.\n\nA' ∆ B' = {5, 6} ∆ {1, 2} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nComparing the two results:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ (A ∆ B)' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nSince (A ∆ B) ∆ (A ∆ B)' ≠ A' ∆ B', we have shown that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement."
