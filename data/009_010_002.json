    "message_2": "To find the price of a European call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to use the following formula:\n\nCall option price = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rt) * N(d2)\n\nWhere:\nS = current stock price ($75)\nX = strike price ($80)\nr = risk-free interest rate (0.05)\nt = time to expiration (3 months = 0.25 years)\nN(x) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * t) / (σ * sqrt(t))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(t)\n\nWhere:\nln(x) = natural logarithm of x\nσ = volatility (0.2)\nsqrt(x) = square root of x\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(75/80) + (0.05 + (0.2^2)/2) * 0.25) / (0.2 * sqrt(0.25))\nd1 = (-0.0645 + (0.05 + 0.02) * 0.25) / (0.2 * 0.5)\nd1 = (-0.0645 + 0.0175) / 0.1\nd1 = -0.47\n\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(t)\nd2 = -0.47 - 0.2 * 0.5\nd2 = -0.57\n\nNow, we need to find the cumulative distribution function values for d1 and d2:\n\nN(-0.47) = 0.3192\nN(-0.57) = 0.2843\n\nFinally, let's calculate the call option price:\n\nCall option price = 75 * 0.3192 - 80 * e^(-0.05 * 0.25) * 0.2843\nCall option price = 23.94 - 80 * 0.9876 * 0.2843\nCall option price = 23.94 - 22.46\nCall option price = $1.48\n\nSo, the price of the European call option with a strike price of $80 and expiration in 3 months is approximately $1.48."
