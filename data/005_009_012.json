    "message_2": "To find the median of a data set, we first need to arrange the numbers in ascending order, which is already done in this case. Then, we find the middle value(s). If there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\nIn this data set, there are 20 values, which is an even number. So, we need to find the average of the two middle values.\n\nThe two middle values are the 10th and 11th values, which are 30 and 31.\n\nThe median is the average of these two values:\n\n(30 + 31) / 2 = 61 / 2 = 30.5\n\nSo, the median of this data set is 30.5."
