    "message_2": "To find the intersection of the two surfaces, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9$ and $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n\n$z^2 + z^2 = 9$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$2z^2 = 9$\n\nNow, we can solve for $z^2$:\n\n$z^2 = \\frac{9}{2}$\n\nSince we are considering complex numbers, we have two possible values for $z$:\n\n$z = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}$\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the second equation to find the corresponding values of $x$ and $y$:\n\nFor $z = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}$:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{2}$\n\nFor $z = -\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}$:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 = \\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{2}$\n\nIn both cases, we have the same equation for $x^2 + y^2$. This equation represents a circle in the complex plane with radius $\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}$. Since a circle has infinitely many points, there are infinitely many intersection points of these surfaces over the complex numbers.\n\nThe degree of the intersection is the maximum number of intersection points that can be found by varying the coefficients of the equations. In this case, the degree of the intersection is infinite, as there are infinitely many intersection points."
