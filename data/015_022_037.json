    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a nonlinear delay differential equation given by:\n\ndx(t)/dt = βx(t-τ)/(1 + x(t-τ)^n) - γx(t)\n\nwhere x(t) is the variable of interest, β, γ, and n are positive constants, and τ is the time delay.\n\nThe bifurcation parameter value at which the Mackey-Glass equation undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation from a stable fixed point to chaos depends on the specific values of β, γ, n, and τ. There is no single value that can be given without knowing these parameters. However, it is known that the Mackey-Glass equation can exhibit chaotic behavior for certain parameter values, such as β = 0.2, γ = 0.1, n = 10, and τ = 17."
