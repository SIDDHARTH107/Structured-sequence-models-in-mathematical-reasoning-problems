    "message_2": "To compute the De Rham cohomology class $[\\omega]$ of the 2-form $\\omega = dx \\wedge dy + dy \\wedge dz$, we first need to determine if $\\omega$ is a closed form, i.e., if $d\\omega = 0$. If $\\omega$ is closed, then we can proceed to find if it is exact, i.e., if there exists a 1-form $\\alpha$ such that $\\omega = d\\alpha$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the exterior derivative $d\\omega$:\n\n$d\\omega = d(dx \\wedge dy + dy \\wedge dz) = d(dx \\wedge dy) + d(dy \\wedge dz)$.\n\nRecall that the exterior derivative is a graded derivation, so we have:\n\n$d(dx \\wedge dy) = (ddx) \\wedge dy - dx \\wedge (ddy)$,\n\n$d(dy \\wedge dz) = (ddy) \\wedge dz - dy \\wedge (ddz)$.\n\nSince $d^2 = 0$ for any smooth function, we get:\n\n$d(dx \\wedge dy) = 0 \\wedge dy - dx \\wedge 0 = 0$,\n\n$d(dy \\wedge dz) = 0 \\wedge dz - dy \\wedge 0 = 0$.\n\nThus, $d\\omega = 0 + 0 = 0$, which means that $\\omega$ is a closed form.\n\nNow we need to check if $\\omega$ is exact. Suppose there exists a 1-form $\\alpha = f dx + g dy + h dz$ such that $d\\alpha = \\omega$. Then:\n\n$d\\alpha = df \\wedge dx + dg \\wedge dy + dh \\wedge dz$.\n\nUsing the graded derivation property again, we have:\n\n$d\\alpha = (df \\wedge dx + dg \\wedge dy + dh \\wedge dz) = (df \\wedge dx) + (dg \\wedge dy) + (dh \\wedge dz)$.\n\nComparing this with $\\omega = dx \\wedge dy + dy \\wedge dz$, we get the following system of equations:\n\n1. $df \\wedge dx = 0$,\n2. $dg \\wedge dy = dx \\wedge dy$,\n3. $dh \\wedge dz = dy \\wedge dz$.\n\nFrom equation (1), we see that $df = 0$, which implies that $f$ is a constant function. From equations (2) and (3), we have $dg = dx$ and $dh = dy$. Integrating these equations, we get $g = x + c_1$ and $h = y + c_2$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants.\n\nThus, the 1-form $\\alpha = f dx + g dy + h dz = c_1 dx + (x + c_2) dy + (y + c_3) dz$ satisfies $d\\alpha = \\omega$. This means that $\\omega$ is an exact form.\n\nSince $\\omega$ is both closed and exact, its De Rham cohomology class $[\\omega]$ is trivial, i.e., $[\\omega] = 0$."
