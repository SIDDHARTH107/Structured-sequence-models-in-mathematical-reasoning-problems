    "message_1": "A designer wants to create a quilt pattern using 12 different fabrics. Each block of the quilt will be made up of 4 of the fabrics. How many blocks can the designer create if she wants to use all 12 fabrics exactly once in each block?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, the designer has 12 different fabrics (n = 12) and wants to use 4 of them in each block (k = 4).\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12-4)!)\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4!8!)\n\nC(12, 4) = (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(12, 4) = (12 × 11 × 10 × 9) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(12, 4) = 11880 / 24\n\nC(12, 4) = 495\n\nSo, the designer can create 495 different blocks using all 12 fabrics exactly once in each block."
