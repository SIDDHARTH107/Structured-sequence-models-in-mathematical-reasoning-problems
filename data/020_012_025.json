    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Global optimization:\n\nSuppose you want to maximize the volume of a rectangular box with a fixed surface area of 100 square meters. What are the dimensions of the box that result in the maximum volume?\n\nHint: You can start by using calculus to find the critical points of the volume function and then check whether each critical point corresponds to a local maximum or minimum using the second derivative test. Finally, check the endpoints of the function to make sure that you are indeed at the global maximum.",
    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be x, y, and z. The volume V and surface area S of the box can be represented as follows:\n\nV = xyz\nS = 2(xy + xz + yz) = 100\n\nWe want to maximize the volume V subject to the constraint S = 100. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the Lagrangian function L:\n\nL(x, y, z, λ) = xyz - λ(2(xy + xz + yz) - 100)\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by taking the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, z, and λ, and setting them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x = yz - λ(2y + 2z) = 0\n∂L/∂y = xz - λ(2x + 2z) = 0\n∂L/∂z = xy - λ(2x + 2y) = 0\n∂L/∂λ = 2(xy + xz + yz) - 100 = 0\n\nNow we have a system of four equations with four unknowns. We can solve this system by first eliminating λ from the first three equations:\n\nx(∂L/∂x) = y(∂L/∂y) = z(∂L/∂z)\n\nxyz - λ(2xy + 2xz) = xyz - λ(2yx + 2yz) = xyz - λ(2zx + 2zy)\n\nThis implies that the three terms in parentheses are equal:\n\n2xy + 2xz = 2yx + 2yz = 2zx + 2zy\n\nSince x, y, and z are all positive, we can conclude that x = y = z. Now we can use the surface area constraint to find the value of x:\n\nS = 2(xy + xz + yz) = 100\n100 = 2(x^2 + x^2 + x^2)\n100 = 6x^2\nx^2 = 100/6 = 50/3\n\nSo, x = y = z = √(50/3) ≈ 4.08 meters. Therefore, the dimensions of the box that result in the maximum volume are approximately 4.08 meters × 4.08 meters × 4.08 meters."
