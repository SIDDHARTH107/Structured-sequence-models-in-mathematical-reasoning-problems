    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 30 is 2 × 3 × 5. \n\nLet G be a group of order 30. By Sylow's theorems, we know that:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) divides 15 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 10 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) divides 6 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can only be 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5. Since they are all normal, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3 × P_5, which is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_3 × Z_5, or Z_30. \n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5, both of which are normal. Let P_2 be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Then G is a semidirect product of P_3 × P_5 by P_2. Since P_3 × P_5 is isomorphic to Z_15, we have G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of Z_15 by Z_2. There are two possible actions of Z_2 on Z_15, trivial and non-trivial. The trivial action gives the direct product Z_2 × Z_15, which is isomorphic to Z_30. The non-trivial action gives a non-abelian group of order 30, which we will denote as G'.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 10, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5, both of which are normal. However, this case is not possible, as it would imply that there are 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, each of order 3, and their pairwise intersections are trivial. This would mean there are at least 1 + 8 × 2 = 17 elements of order 3 in G, but G has only 30 - 1 - 4 - 24 = 1 element left to assign orders to, which is a contradiction.\n\nThus, there are only two distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 30: the cyclic group Z_30 and the non-abelian group G'."
