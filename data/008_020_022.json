    "message_2": "To find the solution to the system of linear equations Ax = b, we need to find the vector x that satisfies this equation. Since A is a non-square matrix (2x2), we can use the method of least squares to find an approximate solution.\n\nFirst, let's write down the system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y = 5\n-1x - 6y = 6\n\nNow, let's write the augmented matrix for this system:\n\n[ 2   3 | 5 ]\n[-1  -6 | 6 ]\n\nWe will perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the matrix:\n\n1. Swap row 1 and row 2:\n\n[-1  -6 | 6 ]\n[ 2   3 | 5 ]\n\n2. Multiply row 1 by -1/2:\n\n[ 1/2  3 | -3 ]\n[ 2    3 |  5 ]\n\n3. Replace row 2 with row 2 - 4 * row 1:\n\n[ 1/2  3 | -3 ]\n[ 0  -9 | 17 ]\n\n4. Multiply row 1 by 2 and row 2 by -1/9:\n\n[ 1  6 | -6 ]\n[ 0  1 | -17/9 ]\n\nNow we have the row echelon form of the matrix:\n\n[ 1  6 | -6 ]\n[ 0  1 | -17/9 ]\n\nFrom this, we can write the system of linear equations:\n\nx + 6y = -6\ny = -17/9\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = -6 - 6y\nx = -6 - 6(-17/9)\nx = -6 + 34/3\nx = (-18 + 34) / 3\nx = 16 / 3\n\nSo, the approximate solution to the system of linear equations Ax = b is:\n\nx = 16/3\ny = -17/9\n\nIn vector form, the solution is:\n\nx = ⎡ 16/3 ⎤\n      ⎣-17/9 ⎦"
