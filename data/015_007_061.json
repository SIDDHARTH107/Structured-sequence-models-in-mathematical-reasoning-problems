    "message_2": "To compute the first ten iterates of the logistic map with x_0 = 0.2 and r = 3.5, we can use the formula x_n+1 = r*x_n*(1-x_n) iteratively:\n\nx_1 = 3.5 * 0.2 * (1 - 0.2) = 0.56\nx_2 = 3.5 * 0.56 * (1 - 0.56) ≈ 0.8624\nx_3 = 3.5 * 0.8624 * (1 - 0.8624) ≈ 0.4165\nx_4 = 3.5 * 0.4165 * (1 - 0.4165) ≈ 0.8498\nx_5 = 3.5 * 0.8498 * (1 - 0.8498) ≈ 0.4446\nx_6 = 3.5 * 0.4446 * (1 - 0.4446) ≈ 0.8633\nx_7 = 3.5 * 0.8633 * (1 - 0.8633) ≈ 0.4119\nx_8 = 3.5 * 0.4119 * (1 - 0.4119) ≈ 0.8459\nx_9 = 3.5 * 0.8459 * (1 - 0.8459) ≈ 0.4573\nx_10 = 3.5 * 0.4573 * (1 - 0.4573) ≈ 0.8672\n\nTo plot these values on a graph, you can use any graphing software or tool and plot the points (1, 0.56), (2, 0.8624), (3, 0.4165), (4, 0.8498), (5, 0.4446), (6, 0.8633), (7, 0.4119), (8, 0.8459), (9, 0.4573), and (10, 0.8672).\n\nThe first value of r at which the logistic map becomes chaotic is approximately r ≈ 3.57. This is known as the onset of chaos, and it occurs at the Feigenbaum point. Beyond this value, the behavior of the logistic map becomes increasingly complex and unpredictable."
