Suppose we have a manifold $M$ that is obtained by gluing two tori along their boundaries. Calculate the partition function $Z(M)$ in terms of the partition functions of the individual tori.",
    "message_2": "Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be the two tori with partition functions $Z(T_1)$ and $Z(T_2)$, respectively. We will denote the gluing of the tori along their boundaries by $M = T_1 \\# T_2$. To compute the partition function $Z(M)$, we need to consider the path integral over all field configurations on $M$.\n\nFirst, let's cut open the tori along their boundaries, which are circles. We can represent each torus as a square with opposite sides identified. When we cut open the tori, we obtain two annuli, each with two boundary circles. Now, we can glue the annuli together along one pair of boundary circles to obtain the manifold $M$. \n\nTo compute the partition function $Z(M)$, we need to sum over all field configurations on $M$. We can do this by summing over all field configurations on the annuli, and then identifying the field configurations on the glued boundary circles. This identification is equivalent to taking the trace of the product of the field configurations on the boundary circles.\n\nLet's denote the field configurations on the boundary circles of the annuli as $A_1$ and $A_2$. Then, the partition function $Z(M)$ can be written as:\n\n$$Z(M) = \\sum_{A_1, A_2} \\langle A_1 | Z(T_1) | A_2 \\rangle \\langle A_2 | Z(T_2) | A_1 \\rangle$$\n\nHere, $\\langle A_1 | Z(T_1) | A_2 \\rangle$ and $\\langle A_2 | Z(T_2) | A_1 \\rangle$ are the matrix elements of the partition functions $Z(T_1)$ and $Z(T_2)$, respectively, in the basis of field configurations on the boundary circles.\n\nNow, we can use the property of the trace, which states that the trace of a product of matrices is invariant under cyclic permutations:\n\n$$\\text{Tr}(AB) = \\text{Tr}(BA)$$\n\nApplying this property to the partition function $Z(M)$, we obtain:\n\n$$Z(M) = \\sum_{A_1, A_2} \\langle A_1 | Z(T_1) Z(T_2) | A_1 \\rangle = \\text{Tr}(Z(T_1) Z(T_2))$$\n\nThus, the partition function of the manifold $M$ obtained by gluing two tori along their boundaries is given by the trace of the product of the partition functions of the individual tori:\n\n$$Z(M) = \\text{Tr}(Z(T_1) Z(T_2))$$"
