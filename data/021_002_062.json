    "message_2": "The power iteration method is an iterative algorithm used to find the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector of a matrix. Given a matrix A and an initial guess vector x, the algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. Normalize the initial guess vector x.\n2. Multiply A by the normalized x to get a new vector y.\n3. Normalize y.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\n\nLet's apply the power iteration method to the given matrix A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] and initial guess vector x = [1, 1].\n\nStep 1: Normalize the initial guess vector x.\nx = [1, 1]\n||x|| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)\nNormalized x = [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] = [0.7071, 0.7071]\n\nNow, we will iterate through the power iteration method until convergence.\n\nIteration 1:\nStep 2: Multiply A by the normalized x.\ny = A * x = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] * [0.7071, 0.7071] = [2.1213, 4.9497]\n\nStep 3: Normalize y.\n||y|| = sqrt(2.1213^2 + 4.9497^2) = 5.3723\nNormalized y = [0.3949, 0.9189]\n\nIteration 2:\nStep 2: Multiply A by the normalized y.\ny = A * y = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] * [0.3949, 0.9189] = [2.2327, 5.0913]\n\nStep 3: Normalize y.\n||y|| = sqrt(2.2327^2 + 5.0913^2) = 5.4649\nNormalized y = [0.4082, 0.9129]\n\nWe can see that the normalized y is not changing significantly after the second iteration. Therefore, we can stop the iteration process here and consider the normalized y as the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue.\n\nEigenvector = [0.4082, 0.9129]\n\nTo find the largest eigenvalue, we can use the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nEigenvalue = (y^T * A * y) / (y^T * y)\n\nEigenvalue = ([0.4082, 0.9129] * [[1, 2], [3, 4]] * [0.4082, 0.9129]) / ([0.4082, 0.9129] * [0.4082, 0.9129])\nEigenvalue = (5.3240) / (1)\nEigenvalue â‰ˆ 5.3240\n\nSo, the largest eigenvalue is approximately 5.3240, and its corresponding eigenvector is [0.4082, 0.9129]."
