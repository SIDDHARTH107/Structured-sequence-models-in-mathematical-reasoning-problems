    "message_2": "In this problem, we are looking for the number of permutations of the first three finishers among the 10 runners. \n\nFor the first place, there are 10 options (any of the 10 runners). Once the first place is determined, there are 9 options left for the second place. And after the first two places are determined, there are 8 options left for the third place.\n\nSo, the total number of different ways the first three runners can finish the race is:\n\n10 (options for 1st place) * 9 (options for 2nd place) * 8 (options for 3rd place) = 720 different ways."
