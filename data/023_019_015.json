    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the LTI system, we need to analyze the poles of the transfer function H(s). A system is stable if all the poles have negative real parts. \n\nFirst, let's find the poles of the transfer function by setting the denominator equal to zero:\n\ns^2 + 6s + 8 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 6, and c = 8. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (-6 ± √(6^2 - 4 * 1 * 8)) / 2 * 1\ns = (-6 ± √(36 - 32)) / 2\ns = (-6 ± √4) / 2\ns = (-6 ± 2) / 2\n\nThis gives us two poles:\n\ns1 = (-6 + 2) / 2 = -2\ns2 = (-6 - 2) / 2 = -4\n\nBoth poles have negative real parts (-2 and -4), so the system is stable."
