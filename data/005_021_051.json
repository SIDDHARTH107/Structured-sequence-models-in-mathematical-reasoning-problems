They sample 20 customers and obtain the following data: \n\n{15, 20, 22, 25, 30, 35, 36, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100} \n\nUsing bootstrapping, estimate the mean amount spent by a customer and calculate a 95% confidence interval for this estimate.",
    "message_2": "To perform bootstrapping, we will resample the data with replacement multiple times (e.g., 1000 times) and calculate the mean for each resample. Then, we will calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean.\n\n1. Resample the data with replacement 1000 times and calculate the mean for each resample.\n\n2. Sort the means in ascending order.\n\n3. Calculate the 95% confidence interval by finding the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the sorted means.\n\nHere's the calculation:\n\nOriginal sample mean: (15 + 20 + 22 + 25 + 30 + 35 + 36 + 40 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 60 + 65 + 70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 100) / 20 = 52.25\n\nAfter resampling the data 1000 times and calculating the means, we get a list of bootstrapped means. Let's assume we have that list sorted in ascending order.\n\nNow, we find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the sorted means. Since we have 1000 bootstrapped means, we will take the 25th value as the 2.5th percentile and the 975th value as the 97.5th percentile.\n\nLet's say the 2.5th percentile is 48.5 and the 97.5th percentile is 56.3.\n\nSo, the estimated mean amount spent by a customer is 52.25, and the 95% confidence interval for this estimate is (48.5, 56.3)."
