    "message_2": "To find the time at which the temperature of the object was increasing at the maximum rate, we need to find the maximum of the rate of change of the temperature function T(t) with respect to time t. This can be done by finding the first derivative of T(t) with respect to t and then finding the critical points of the first derivative.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of T(t) with respect to t:\n\nT(t) = t^2 - 6t + 8\ndT/dt = 2t - 6\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points of the first derivative. Critical points occur when the derivative is equal to zero or is undefined. In this case, the derivative is a linear function, so it will never be undefined. We can set the derivative equal to zero and solve for t:\n\n2t - 6 = 0\n2t = 6\nt = 3\n\nNow we have found the critical point t = 3. To determine if this critical point corresponds to a maximum rate of increase, we can find the second derivative of T(t) with respect to t and evaluate it at the critical point:\n\nT(t) = t^2 - 6t + 8\ndT/dt = 2t - 6\nd^2T/dt^2 = 2\n\nThe second derivative is a constant value of 2, which is greater than zero. This means that the function T(t) is concave up at all points, and the critical point we found corresponds to a local minimum. However, since there is only one critical point, this local minimum is also the global minimum. Therefore, the temperature of the object was increasing at the maximum rate at time t = 3 minutes."
