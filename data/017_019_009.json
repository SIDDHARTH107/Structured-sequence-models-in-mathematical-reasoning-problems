    "message_2": "There are nine non-abelian groups of order 36, but not all of them are isomorphic to either C36 or A4 × C3. C36 is an abelian group, so none of the non-abelian groups can be isomorphic to it. The nine non-abelian groups of order 36 are:\n\n1. S3 × C6\n2. A4 × C3\n3. (C3 × C3) ⋊ C4\n4. (C6 × C3) ⋊ C2\n5. (C9 × C2) ⋊ C2\n6. C3 ⋊ C12\n7. C6 ⋊ C6\n8. C18 ⋊ C2\n9. C9 ⋊ C4\n\nOut of these nine groups, only A4 × C3 is isomorphic to the direct product of A4 and C3. The isomorphism is the identity map, as the group structure is already given as the direct product of A4 and C3:\n\nϕ: A4 × C3 → A4 × C3\nϕ((a, b)) = (a, b)\n\nwhere a ∈ A4 and b ∈ C3. This is an isomorphism because it is a bijective homomorphism."
