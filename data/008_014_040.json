    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the QR decomposition method, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |\n    | 3 -4  5 |\n    | 2  1  7 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 10 |\n    |  2 |\n    |  5 |\n\nNow, we need to perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we need to find orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R:\n\nQ = |  0.2673  0.8729 -0.4082 |\n    |  0.8018 -0.2182 -0.5567 |\n    |  0.5345 -0.4364  0.7245 |\n\nR = |  3.7417  0.8018  6.9631 |\n    |  0      5.4772 -0.2182 |\n    |  0      0       2.4495 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation QRx = b. We can do this by first solving the equation Q^Tb = y, and then solving the equation Rx = y.\n\nQ^Tb = |  0.2673  0.8018  0.5345 | | 10 |   |  3.7417 |\n       |  0.8729 -0.2182 -0.4364 | |  2 | = | -5.4772 |\n       | -0.4082 -0.5567  0.7245 | |  5 |   |  2.4495 |\n\nNow, we have the equation Ry = |  3.7417 |\n                                | -5.4772 |\n                                |  2.4495 |\n\nSolving this system of linear equations, we get:\n\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = -1\n\nSo, the exact numerical values for x, y, and z are 1, 2, and -1, respectively."
