    "message_1": "On a certain road, the probability that a car accident involves only one car is 0.65. If there are 10 car accidents on this road, what is the probability that at least 7 of them will only involve one car?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a one-car accident)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of car accidents)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of one-car accidents)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 7 out of 10 car accidents involve only one car. This means we need to find the probability for 7, 8, 9, and 10 one-car accidents and sum them up.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for each case:\n\n1. P(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * 0.65^7 * (1-0.65)^(10-7)\n2. P(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * 0.65^8 * (1-0.65)^(10-8)\n3. P(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * 0.65^9 * (1-0.65)^(10-9)\n4. P(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * 0.65^10 * (1-0.65)^(10-10)\n\nNow, let's calculate the combination values:\n\n1. C(10, 7) = 10! / (7!(10-7)!) = 120\n2. C(10, 8) = 10! / (8!(10-8)!) = 45\n3. C(10, 9) = 10! / (9!(10-9)!) = 10\n4. C(10, 10) = 10! / (10!(10-10)!) = 1\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the probability formula:\n\n1. P(X = 7) = 120 * 0.65^7 * 0.35^3 ≈ 0.200\n2. P(X = 8) = 45 * 0.65^8 * 0.35^2 ≈ 0.120\n3. P(X = 9) = 10 * 0.65^9 * 0.35^1 ≈ 0.032\n4. P(X = 10) = 1 * 0.65^10 * 0.35^0 ≈ 0.002\n\nFinally, let's sum up these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 7) = P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) ≈ 0.200 + 0.120 + 0.032 + 0.002 ≈ 0.354\n\nSo, the probability that at least 7 out of 10 car accidents involve only one car is approximately 0.354 or 35.4%."
