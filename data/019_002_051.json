    "message_1": "Solve the predicate logic problem: \nIf x is a positive even number, then it can be expressed in the form of x = 2n, where n is a positive integer. Find two different positive even numbers that can be expressed in this form with values of n being 3 and 5.",
    "message_2": "To find the two different positive even numbers, we can plug in the given values of n (3 and 5) into the equation x = 2n.\n\nFor n = 3:\nx = 2 * 3\nx = 6\n\nFor n = 5:\nx = 2 * 5\nx = 10\n\nSo, the two different positive even numbers are 6 and 10."
