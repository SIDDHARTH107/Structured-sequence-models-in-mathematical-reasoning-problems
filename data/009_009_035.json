    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we first need to convert the given energy from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). \n\n1 eV = 1.602 × 10^-19 J\n\nSo, 2.5 eV = 2.5 * (1.602 × 10^-19 J) = 4.005 × 10^-19 J\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the energy levels of a particle in an infinite potential well:\n\nE_n = (n^2 * h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the particle, n is the energy level (quantum number), h is the Planck's constant (6.626 × 10^-34 Js), m is the mass of the particle, and L is the width of the well.\n\nWe are given E_n = 4.005 × 10^-19 J, m = 9.11 × 10^-31 kg, and L = 5 nm = 5 × 10^-9 m. We need to find the quantum number n.\n\nRearranging the formula for n:\n\nn^2 = (8 * m * L^2 * E_n) / h^2\n\nn^2 = (8 * (9.11 × 10^-31 kg) * (5 × 10^-9 m)^2 * (4.005 × 10^-19 J)) / (6.626 × 10^-34 Js)^2\n\nn^2 ≈ 33.49\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nn ≈ √33.49 ≈ 5.78\n\nSince n must be an integer, we can conclude that there is no solution for the given energy level of 2.5 eV in a 5 nm wide infinite potential well. The energy level does not correspond to a valid quantum state for the given system."
