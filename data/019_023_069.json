    "message_2": "The sequence follows the pattern of adding 4 to each previous term. We can find the 10th term by continuing this pattern:\n\n1st term: 5\n2nd term: 5 + 4 = 9\n3rd term: 9 + 4 = 13\n4th term: 13 + 4 = 17\n5th term: 17 + 4 = 21\n6th term: 21 + 4 = 25\n7th term: 25 + 4 = 29\n8th term: 29 + 4 = 33\n9th term: 33 + 4 = 37\n10th term: 37 + 4 = 41\n\nSo, the 10th term of the sequence is 41."
