    "message_1": "A survey was conducted on 50 students to find out their heights in centimeters. The mean height was found to be 167cm and the standard deviation was 5.5cm. However, later it was discovered that two students gave incorrect measurements, and their heights were actually 120cm and 220cm. Find the median height of the students using the concept of robust statistics.",
    "message_2": "To find the median height using the concept of robust statistics, we will first remove the outliers (the two incorrect measurements) and then calculate the median of the remaining data.\n\nFirst, let's find the sum of the heights of all 50 students using the given mean height:\n\nMean height = (Sum of heights) / Number of students\n167 = (Sum of heights) / 50\n\nSum of heights = 167 * 50 = 8350 cm\n\nNow, let's subtract the incorrect measurements and add the correct ones:\n\nAdjusted sum of heights = 8350 - 120 - 220 + 120 + 220 = 8350 cm\n\nSince the sum of heights remains the same, the mean height remains the same as well (167 cm).\n\nNow, we have 48 students' heights (excluding the two outliers). To find the median, we need to arrange the heights in ascending order and find the middle value(s). However, we don't have the individual heights, so we can't arrange them in order.\n\nIn this case, we can use the concept of robust statistics, which states that the median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean. Since the mean height remains the same after removing the outliers, and we know that the median is less affected by outliers, we can assume that the median height is approximately equal to the mean height.\n\nTherefore, the median height of the students is approximately 167 cm."
