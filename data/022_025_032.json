In this case, the wave function is given by ψ(x) = A exp(-bx²). \n\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|:\n\n|ψ(x)| = |A exp(-bx²)|\n\nSince A and b are constants and exp(-bx²) is always positive, we can write:\n\n|ψ(x)| = A exp(-bx²)\n\nNow, let's find the probability density function, P(x), by squaring the magnitude of the wave function:\n\nP(x) = |ψ(x)|² = (A exp(-bx²))²\n\nP(x) = A² exp(-2bx²)\n\nSo, the probability density function for this particle is P(x) = A² exp(-2bx²)."
