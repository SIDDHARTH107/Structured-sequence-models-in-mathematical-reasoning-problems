    "message_2": "To factor the quadratic polynomial 6x^2 - 13x - 5, we can use the \"ac method\" or \"factoring by grouping.\"\n\nStep 1: Multiply the leading coefficient (6) by the constant term (-5) to get -30.\n\nStep 2: Find two numbers that multiply to -30 and add up to the middle coefficient (-13). These numbers are -15 and 2.\n\nStep 3: Rewrite the middle term (-13x) as the sum of the two numbers found in step 2: -15x + 2x.\n\n6x^2 - 13x - 5 = 6x^2 - 15x + 2x - 5\n\nStep 4: Factor by grouping. Group the first two terms and the last two terms.\n\n(6x^2 - 15x) + (2x - 5)\n\nStep 5: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from each group.\n\n3x(2x - 5) + 1(2x - 5)\n\nStep 6: Notice that both terms have a common factor of (2x - 5). Factor this out.\n\n(3x + 1)(2x - 5)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial 6x^2 - 13x - 5 is (3x + 1)(2x - 5)."
