    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by the given function, we will use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the area of the cross-sectional disks along the axis of rotation.\n\nThe area of a disk is given by A(x) = πr^2, where r is the radius of the disk. In this case, the radius is given by the function y = x^(2/3).\n\nSo, A(x) = π(x^(2/3))^2 = πx^(4/3).\n\nNow, we will integrate A(x) with respect to x from 0 to 1 to find the volume of the solid:\n\nV = ∫[0, 1] A(x) dx = ∫[0, 1] πx^(4/3) dx\n\nTo integrate, we will use the power rule for integration:\n\n∫x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C\n\nSo, V = π ∫[0, 1] x^(4/3) dx = π [(x^(7/3))/(7/3)] [0, 1]\n\nNow, we will evaluate the integral at the bounds:\n\nV = π [(1^(7/3))/(7/3) - (0^(7/3))/(7/3)]\n\nSince 1 raised to any power is 1 and 0 raised to any power is 0, we have:\n\nV = π [(1)/(7/3)] = π(3/7)\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by the graph of the function y = x^(2/3), the x-axis, and the vertical lines x = 0 and x = 1 about the x-axis is V = (3/7)π cubic units."
