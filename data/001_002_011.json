    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem:\n\nGiven the equation y = 2x - 1, graph the line and find the y-intercept and the slope of the line. Then, use the equation to find the value of y when x = 5.",
    "message_2": "To graph the line, we can start by finding two points on the line. We can use the y-intercept and another point by plugging in a value for x.\n\n1. Find the y-intercept:\nThe y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, which means x = 0. Plugging x = 0 into the equation:\n\ny = 2(0) - 1\ny = -1\n\nSo the y-intercept is the point (0, -1).\n\n2. Find another point on the line:\nLet's choose x = 1:\n\ny = 2(1) - 1\ny = 2 - 1\ny = 1\n\nSo another point on the line is (1, 1).\n\nNow we can graph the line using these two points.\n\n3. Find the slope of the line:\nThe slope of the line is the coefficient of x in the equation, which is 2. So the slope is 2.\n\n4. Find the value of y when x = 5:\nPlug x = 5 into the equation:\n\ny = 2(5) - 1\ny = 10 - 1\ny = 9\n\nSo when x = 5, y = 9.\n\nIn summary, the line can be graphed using the points (0, -1) and (1, 1), the y-intercept is (0, -1), the slope is 2, and when x = 5, y = 9."
