    "message_2": "To find out how many smaller pyramids are needed to fill the larger pyramid, we need to find the ratio of their volumes.\n\nThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated using the formula: V = (1/3) * base_area * height\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the larger pyramid:\nBase area of the larger pyramid = (1/2) * base_edge_length * base_edge_length\nBase area = (1/2) * 6 * 6 = 18 cm²\nVolume of the larger pyramid = (1/3) * 18 * 5 = 30 cm³\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the smaller pyramid:\nBase area of the smaller pyramid = (1/2) * base_edge_length * base_edge_length\nBase area = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2 cm²\nVolume of the smaller pyramid = (1/3) * 2 * 1.67 ≈ 1.11 cm³\n\nNow, we can find the number of smaller pyramids needed to fill the larger pyramid by dividing the volume of the larger pyramid by the volume of the smaller pyramid:\n\nNumber of smaller pyramids = Volume of the larger pyramid / Volume of the smaller pyramid\nNumber of smaller pyramids = 30 cm³ / 1.11 cm³ ≈ 27\n\nSo, approximately 27 smaller pyramids are needed to completely fill the larger pyramid."
