    "message_2": "We can solve this system of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method. First, we will write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 7 |\n| 2  1  4 | 8 |\n| 3  4  5 | 9 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first element of the second and third rows.\nTo do this, we will subtract 2 times the first row from the second row and 3 times the first row from the third row.\n\n| 1  2  3 |  7  |\n| 0 -3 -2 | -6  |\n| 0 -2 -4 | -12 |\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -3 to make the second element of the second row equal to 1.\n\n| 1  2   3 |  7  |\n| 0  1  2/3|  2  |\n| 0 -2 -4  | -12 |\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the second element of the third row.\nTo do this, we will add 2 times the second row to the third row.\n\n| 1  2   3  |  7  |\n| 0  1  2/3 |  2  |\n| 0  0 -2/3 | -8  |\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by -2/3 to make the third element of the third row equal to 1.\n\n| 1  2   3  |  7  |\n| 0  1  2/3 |  2  |\n| 0  0   1  |  4  |\n\nStep 5: Use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\nFrom the third row, we have z = 4.\nNow, substitute z into the second row: y + 2/3 * 4 = 2 => y = 2 - 8/3 = -2/3.\nFinally, substitute y and z into the first row: x + 2*(-2/3) + 3*4 = 7 => x = 7 - 6 = 1.\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = -2/3, and z = 4."
