    "message_2": "To find the time-domain response of the system to a sinusoidal input, we first need to find the system's response in the frequency domain and then apply the inverse Fourier transform.\n\nGiven the sinusoidal input x(t) = 2sin(t), we can find its Laplace transform X(s):\n\nX(s) = L{2sin(t)} = 2L{sin(t)} = 2(1 / (s^2 + 1))\n\nNow, we can find the system's response in the frequency domain Y(s) by multiplying the transfer function H(s) with the input's Laplace transform X(s):\n\nY(s) = H(s) * X(s) = [(s + 3) / (s^2 - 4s + 3)] * [2 / (s^2 + 1)]\n\nTo find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s), we first need to simplify the expression. We can factor the denominator of H(s):\n\n(s^2 - 4s + 3) = (s - 1)(s - 3)\n\nNow, Y(s) becomes:\n\nY(s) = 2(s + 3) / [(s - 1)(s - 3)(s^2 + 1)]\n\nTo find the inverse Laplace transform, we can perform partial fraction decomposition on Y(s):\n\nY(s) = A / (s - 1) + B / (s - 3) + Cs / (s^2 + 1) + D / (s^2 + 1)\n\nBy solving for the coefficients A, B, C, and D, we get:\n\nA = 1/2, B = -1/2, C = 1, D = 3\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:\n\ny(t) = L^(-1){Y(s)} = L^(-1){1/2 / (s - 1) - 1/2 / (s - 3) + s / (s^2 + 1) + 3 / (s^2 + 1)}\n\ny(t) = (1/2)e^(t) - (1/2)e^(3t) + cos(t) + 3sin(t)\n\nSo, the time-domain response of the system to the sinusoidal input is:\n\ny(t) = (1/2)e^(t) - (1/2)e^(3t) + cos(t) + 3sin(t)"
