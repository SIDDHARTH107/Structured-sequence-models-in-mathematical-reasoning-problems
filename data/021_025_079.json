    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of humpback whales. It is used to find the global minimum of complex optimization problems. However, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute the WOA directly. Instead, I can guide you through the general steps of the algorithm.\n\n1. Initialize a population of whales (candidate solutions) randomly within the search space [0, 10].\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each whale (calculate the value of f(x) for each whale's position).\n3. Determine the best whale (the one with the lowest f(x) value).\n4. Update the position of each whale using the mathematical model of the WOA, which includes encircling prey, bubble-net attacking, and searching for prey.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a predetermined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., the minimum value of f(x) converges).\n\nAfter running the WOA, you will obtain the minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding x value. Note that the WOA is a stochastic algorithm, so the results may vary between different runs.\n\nFor a more accurate answer, you can use numerical optimization libraries in programming languages like Python or MATLAB to implement and run the WOA. Alternatively, you can use other optimization algorithms like the gradient descent method or the Nelder-Mead method to find the minimum value of f(x) within the given search space."
