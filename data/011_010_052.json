    "message_2": "Let's break this problem down. First, we need to determine how many ways there are to enter the park. Since there are 5 entrances, there are 5 ways to enter the park.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many ways there are to exit the park using a different path. Since there are 10 walking paths in total, and we want to exclude the entrance path, there are 9 remaining paths to exit the park.\n\nNow, we simply multiply the number of ways to enter the park (5) by the number of ways to exit the park using a different path (9):\n\n5 entrances * 9 different exit paths = 45 different ways to enter and exit the park using different paths."
