    "message_2": "To find the integral of sin(x) dx from x = 0 to x = π/2, we first need to find the antiderivative of sin(x). The antiderivative of sin(x) is -cos(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration. \n\nNow, we need to evaluate the definite integral:\n\n∫(sin(x) dx) from 0 to π/2 = [-cos(x)] from 0 to π/2\n\nTo evaluate this, we plug in the limits of integration:\n\n[-cos(π/2)] - [-cos(0)]\n\ncos(π/2) = 0 and cos(0) = 1, so the expression becomes:\n\n0 - (-1) = 1\n\nTherefore, the integral of sin(x) dx from x = 0 to x = π/2 is 1."
