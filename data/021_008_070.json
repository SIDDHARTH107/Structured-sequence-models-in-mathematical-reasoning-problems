    "message_2": "To solve the system of nonlinear equations using Newton's method, we first need to define the functions and their Jacobian matrix.\n\nLet f1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 5 and f2(x, y) = x^2 - y. The system of nonlinear equations can be written as:\n\nf1(x, y) = 0\nf2(x, y) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the Jacobian matrix of the functions, which is the matrix of their first-order partial derivatives:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f1/∂x  ∂f1/∂y |\n         | ∂f2/∂x  ∂f2/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n∂f1/∂x = 2x\n∂f1/∂y = 2y\n∂f2/∂x = 2x\n∂f2/∂y = -1\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x  2y |\n         | 2x  -1 |\n\nNow, we apply Newton's method iteratively to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations. We start with an initial guess (x0, y0) and update it using the following formula:\n\n(x, y) = (x0, y0) - J(x0, y0)^(-1) * F(x0, y0)\n\nwhere F(x0, y0) is the vector of the functions evaluated at (x0, y0), and J(x0, y0)^(-1) is the inverse of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at (x0, y0).\n\nLet's choose an initial guess (x0, y0) = (1, 1). Then, we have:\n\nF(x0, y0) = | f1(1, 1) |\n            | f2(1, 1) |\n\n          = | -3 |\n            |  0 |\n\nJ(x0, y0) = | 2  2 |\n            | 2 -1 |\n\nTo find the inverse of J(x0, y0), we use the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix:\n\nJ(x0, y0)^(-1) = (1/det(J(x0, y0))) * | -1 -2 |\n                                        | -2  2 |\n\nwhere det(J(x0, y0)) is the determinant of J(x0, y0), which is:\n\ndet(J(x0, y0)) = (2 * -1) - (2 * 2) = -6\n\nSo, J(x0, y0)^(-1) = | 1/6  1/3 |\n                     | 1/3 -1/3 |\n\nNow, we can update our guess for (x, y):\n\n(x, y) = (1, 1) - J(x0, y0)^(-1) * F(x0, y0)\n\n       = (1, 1) - | 1/6  1/3 | * | -3 |\n                   | 1/3 -1/3 |   |  0 |\n\n       = (1, 1) - | 1 |\n                   | 1 |\n\n       = (0, 0)\n\nAfter one iteration, we have found the solution (x, y) = (0, 0), which satisfies both equations:\n\nf1(0, 0) = 0^2 + 0^2 - 5 = -5 + 5 = 0\nf2(0, 0) = 0^2 - 0 = 0\n\nSo, the values of x and y that satisfy both equations are x = 0 and y = 0."
