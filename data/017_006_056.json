    "message_2": "To determine the possible groups of order 35, we can use the fact that the order of a group is equal to the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. In this case, the order of the group is 35, which is the product of two prime numbers, 5 and 7. So, we have two Sylow subgroups, one of order 5 and one of order 7.\n\nLet's denote the Sylow 5-subgroup as P_5 and the Sylow 7-subgroup as P_7. By Sylow's Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 7 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups (n_7) must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. In both cases, the only possible value is 1. Thus, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup and a unique Sylow 7-subgroup.\n\nSince both P_5 and P_7 are unique, they are both normal subgroups of the group G of order 35. Now, we can use the fact that if H and K are normal subgroups of G with relatively prime orders, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K. In this case, P_5 and P_7 have relatively prime orders (5 and 7), so G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_5 and P_7.\n\nSince P_5 and P_7 are cyclic groups of prime order, their direct product is also cyclic. Therefore, the group of order 35 is cyclic and isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
