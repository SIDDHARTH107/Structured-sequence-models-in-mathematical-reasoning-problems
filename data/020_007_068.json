The possible profits and resource requirements for each project are as follows:\n\n| Project | Profit ($)| Resource Requirement (staff-weeks) |\n| ------- | ------- | ------- |\n| A | 100 | 3 |\n| B | 150 | 4 |\n| C | 75 | 2 |\n| D | 200 | 5 |\n| E | 50 | 1 |\n| F | 90 | 3 |\n| G | 120 | 4 |\n\nAssuming the company wants to maximize their total profits while staying within their staff-weeks constraints, which 4 projects should they choose to undertake?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total profits while staying within the resource constraints, we can calculate the profit per staff-week for each project and then select the projects with the highest profit per staff-week until the resource limit is reached.\n\nProfit per staff-week for each project:\n\n| Project | Profit ($)| Resource Requirement (staff-weeks) | Profit per staff-week |\n| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\n| A | 100 | 3 | 33.33 |\n| B | 150 | 4 | 37.5 |\n| C | 75 | 2 | 37.5 |\n| D | 200 | 5 | 40 |\n| E | 50 | 1 | 50 |\n| F | 90 | 3 | 30 |\n| G | 120 | 4 | 30 |\n\nSorted by profit per staff-week:\n\n1. E: 50\n2. D: 40\n3. B: 37.5\n4. C: 37.5\n5. A: 33.33\n6. F: 30\n7. G: 30\n\nNow, we will select the projects with the highest profit per staff-week until the resource limit (15 staff-weeks) is reached:\n\n1. Project E: 1 staff-week, total profit = $50\n2. Project D: 5 staff-weeks, total profit = $250 (E + D)\n3. Project B: 4 staff-weeks, total profit = $400 (E + D + B)\n4. Project C: 2 staff-weeks, total profit = $475 (E + D + B + C)\n\nAt this point, we have reached the resource limit of 15 staff-weeks (1 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 12 staff-weeks). Therefore, the company should choose projects E, D, B, and C to maximize their total profits, which will be $475."
