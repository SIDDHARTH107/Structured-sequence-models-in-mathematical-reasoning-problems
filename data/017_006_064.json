    "message_1": "A group has an order of 35 which is not cyclic. Determine the possible values of p and q, where p and q are distinct primes, such that this group is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders p and q.",
    "message_2": "Since the order of the group is 35 and it is not cyclic, it must be the product of two distinct prime numbers. The prime factorization of 35 is 5 * 7. Therefore, the possible values for p and q are 5 and 7.\n\nThe group is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, which can be represented as C_5 Ã— C_7."
