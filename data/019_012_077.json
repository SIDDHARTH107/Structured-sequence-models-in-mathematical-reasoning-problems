    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it's not possible to provide a numerical problem related to paraconsistent logic since it does not rely on numerical calculations or values. Paraconsistent logic deals with the existence of contradictions in logic and finding ways to reason with them. \n\nHowever, I can suggest a question related to paraconsistent logic that a math student can solve:\n\n\"How can one reason with contradictory statements in a logical argument using paraconsistent logic?\"",
    "message_2": "In paraconsistent logic, one can reason with contradictory statements in a logical argument by allowing contradictions to exist without causing the entire system to collapse into triviality. This is done by rejecting the principle of explosion, which states that from a contradiction, any conclusion can be derived.\n\nTo reason with contradictory statements using paraconsistent logic, one can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the contradictory statements: Recognize the statements that are contradictory, i.e., both a statement and its negation are considered true.\n\n2. Use a paraconsistent logical system: Choose a logical system that allows for contradictions, such as LP (Logics of Formal Inconsistency) or relevant logics (R).\n\n3. Apply the rules of the chosen system: Use the rules and axioms of the chosen paraconsistent logical system to reason with the contradictory statements. These rules will allow you to draw conclusions without the principle of explosion coming into play.\n\n4. Analyze the conclusions: Examine the conclusions derived from the paraconsistent logical system. These conclusions may be different from those obtained using classical logic, as they do not rely on the principle of explosion.\n\n5. Evaluate the results: Assess the validity and usefulness of the conclusions obtained through paraconsistent reasoning. This may involve comparing the results to those obtained using classical logic or other non-classical logics.\n\nBy following these steps, one can reason with contradictory statements in a logical argument using paraconsistent logic, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of situations where contradictions may arise."
