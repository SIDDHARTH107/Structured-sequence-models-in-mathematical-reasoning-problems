    "message_2": "To solve this equation, we need to consider the different cases for the absolute value expressions:\n\nCase 1: x + 3 ≥ 0 and y - 2 ≥ 0\nIn this case, |x + 3| = x + 3 and |y - 2| = y - 2. The equation becomes:\n(x + 3) + (y - 2) = 10\nx + y + 3 - 2 = 10\nx + y = 9\n\nCase 2: x + 3 ≥ 0 and y - 2 < 0\nIn this case, |x + 3| = x + 3 and |y - 2| = -(y - 2). The equation becomes:\n(x + 3) - (y - 2) = 10\nx - y + 3 + 2 = 10\nx - y = 5\n\nCase 3: x + 3 < 0 and y - 2 ≥ 0\nIn this case, |x + 3| = -(x + 3) and |y - 2| = y - 2. The equation becomes:\n-(x + 3) + (y - 2) = 10\n-y - 3 + y - 2 = 10\n-2x = 15\nx = -7.5\n\nCase 4: x + 3 < 0 and y - 2 < 0\nIn this case, |x + 3| = -(x + 3) and |y - 2| = -(y - 2). The equation becomes:\n-(x + 3) - (y - 2) = 10\n-x - 3 - y + 2 = 10\n-x - y = 11\n\nNow we have four different cases with different equations. We can't find specific values for x and y because there are infinitely many solutions for each case. However, we can express y in terms of x for each case:\n\nCase 1: y = 9 - x\nCase 2: y = x - 5\nCase 3: x = -7.5 (no specific equation for y since x is a constant)\nCase 4: y = -11 + x\n\nThese are the equations representing the different cases for the values of x and y that satisfy the given equation."
