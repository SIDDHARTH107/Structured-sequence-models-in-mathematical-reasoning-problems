    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use related rates. We are given the rate at which the volume of the balloon is increasing (4 cubic inches per minute) and need to find the rate at which the surface area is increasing when the radius is 5 inches.\n\nFirst, let's write down the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere:\n\nVolume (V) = (4/3)πr^3\nSurface Area (A) = 4πr^2\n\nWe are given dV/dt = 4 cubic inches per minute. We need to find dA/dt when r = 5 inches.\n\nTo find dA/dt, we will first differentiate the surface area formula with respect to time (t):\n\ndA/dt = d(4πr^2)/dt\ndA/dt = 8πr(dr/dt)\n\nNow, we need to find dr/dt. To do this, we will differentiate the volume formula with respect to time (t):\n\ndV/dt = d((4/3)πr^3)/dt\n4 = 4πr^2(dr/dt)\n\nNow, we can solve for dr/dt:\n\ndr/dt = 1/(πr^2)\n\nWhen the radius is 5 inches, dr/dt is:\n\ndr/dt = 1/(π(5^2))\ndr/dt = 1/(25π)\n\nNow, we can plug this value of dr/dt back into the equation for dA/dt:\n\ndA/dt = 8πr(dr/dt)\ndA/dt = 8π(5)(1/(25π))\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n\ndA/dt = (40/25)π\ndA/dt = (8/5)π\n\nSo, when the radius of the balloon is 5 inches, the surface area is increasing at a rate of (8/5)π square inches per minute."
