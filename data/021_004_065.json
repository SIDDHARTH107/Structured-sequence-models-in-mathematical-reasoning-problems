    "message_2": "The five-point formula for the second derivative is given by:\n\nf''(x) ≈ (f(x-2h) - 2f(x-h) + 2f(x+h) - f(x+2h)) / (2h^2)\n\nWe are given the function f(x) = cos(x), the point x = π/4, and the step size h = 0.1. Let's calculate the second derivative using the five-point formula:\n\nf''(π/4) ≈ (cos(π/4 - 2*0.1) - 2cos(π/4 - 0.1) + 2cos(π/4 + 0.1) - cos(π/4 + 2*0.1)) / (2 * 0.1^2)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cosine values for each of the points:\n\ncos(π/4 - 2*0.1) ≈ cos(0.7854 - 0.2) ≈ cos(0.5854) ≈ 0.8378\ncos(π/4 - 0.1) ≈ cos(0.7854 - 0.1) ≈ cos(0.6854) ≈ 0.7648\ncos(π/4 + 0.1) ≈ cos(0.7854 + 0.1) ≈ cos(0.8854) ≈ 0.6361\ncos(π/4 + 2*0.1) ≈ cos(0.7854 + 0.2) ≈ cos(0.9854) ≈ 0.5567\n\nNow, plug these values into the five-point formula:\n\nf''(π/4) ≈ (0.8378 - 2*0.7648 + 2*0.6361 - 0.5567) / (2 * 0.1^2)\nf''(π/4) ≈ (-0.1804) / 0.02\nf''(π/4) ≈ -9.02\n\nSo, the estimated second derivative of f(x) = cos(x) at x = π/4 using the five-point formula with a step size of h = 0.1 is approximately -9.02."
