    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one clown will successfully juggle six balls, we can first find the probability that none of the clowns will successfully juggle six balls and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of a clown not successfully juggling six balls is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nSince there are 5 clowns, the probability that none of them will successfully juggle six balls is 0.8^5 = 0.32768.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one clown will successfully juggle six balls by subtracting the probability that none of them will from 1:\n\n1 - 0.32768 = 0.67232.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one clown will successfully juggle six balls in the performance is approximately 0.67232 or 67.23%."
