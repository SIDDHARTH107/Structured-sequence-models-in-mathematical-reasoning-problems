    "message_2": "The rail fence cipher arranges the plaintext message in a zigzag pattern along a set number of rails (in this case, 3 rails). Then, the encrypted message is formed by reading the characters along each rail from left to right.\n\nHere's how the plaintext \"HELLOWORLD\" would be arranged along 3 rails:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, reading the characters along each rail from left to right, the encrypted message is: \"HORELWLDLO\"."
