    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all vertices in the graph such that each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the matching. In other words, every vertex is paired with exactly one other vertex.\n\nTo determine whether the graph has a perfect matching, we can use the Tutte-Berge formula. The Tutte-Berge formula states that for a graph G with an even number of vertices, the size of the maximum matching is equal to (1/2) * (|V(G)| - odd(G)), where |V(G)| is the number of vertices in G, and odd(G) is the minimum number of odd-degree vertices in any subset of G.\n\nIn this graph, we have 8 vertices, which is an even number. Let's calculate the degree of each vertex:\n\n- A: degree 3\n- B: degree 3\n- C: degree 3\n- D: degree 3\n- E: degree 3\n- F: degree 3\n- G: degree 3\n- H: degree 3\n\nNow, let's find the minimum number of odd-degree vertices in any subset of G. Since all vertices have odd degree, any subset will have an even number of odd-degree vertices. Therefore, odd(G) = 0.\n\nApplying the Tutte-Berge formula:\n\nMaximum matching size = (1/2) * (|V(G)| - odd(G)) = (1/2) * (8 - 0) = 4\n\nSince the maximum matching size is 4, there is a perfect matching in the graph. Now, let's find the edges that are part of the perfect matching.\n\nOne possible perfect matching is:\n\n- A paired with B (edge AB)\n- C paired with D (edge CD)\n- E paired with F (edge EF)\n- G paired with H (edge GH)\n\nSo, the edges that are part of the perfect matching are AB, CD, EF, and GH."
