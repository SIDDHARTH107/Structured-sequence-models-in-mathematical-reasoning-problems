    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) = (3z-1)/(z^2+z-2) around the point z=1, we first factor the denominator:\n\nz^2 + z - 2 = (z - 1)(z + 2)\n\nNow, we perform a partial fraction decomposition:\n\n(3z - 1)/((z - 1)(z + 2)) = A/(z - 1) + B/(z + 2)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (z - 1)(z + 2) to clear the denominators, we get:\n\n3z - 1 = A(z + 2) + B(z - 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in convenient values for z:\n\nz = 1: 3(1) - 1 = A(1 + 2) => A = 2/3\n\nz = -2: 3(-2) - 1 = B(-2 - 1) => B = 1/3\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\nf(z) = (2/3)/(z - 1) + (1/3)/(z + 2)\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion around z = 1 by expanding each term as a geometric series:\n\n(2/3)/(z - 1) = (2/3) * (1/(1 - (z - 1))) = (2/3) * Σ((z - 1)^n)\n\n(1/3)/(z + 2) = (1/3) * (1/(3 - (z - 1))) = (1/3) * Σ((1/3)^n * (z - 1)^n)\n\nThe Laurent series expansion of f(z) around z = 1 is then:\n\nf(z) = (2/3) * Σ((z - 1)^n) + (1/3) * Σ((1/3)^n * (z - 1)^n)\n\nTo find the radius of convergence, we can use the ratio test:\n\nlim (n -> ∞) |a_{n+1}/a_n| = lim (n -> ∞) |(z - 1)/(z - 1)| = 1 for the first series\n\nlim (n -> ∞) |a_{n+1}/a_n| = lim (n -> ∞) |(1/3)(z - 1)/(z - 1)| = 1/3 for the second series\n\nThe radius of convergence for the first series is ∞, and for the second series, it is 3. Since the second series has a smaller radius of convergence, the overall radius of convergence for the Laurent series expansion of f(z) is 3."
