    "message_2": "The Hopf map h: S^3 -> S^2 is a continuous map from the 3-sphere S^3 to the 2-sphere S^2. It is defined by h(z, w) = z * conj(w), where z, w ∈ C and |z|^2 + |w|^2 = 1. To determine the Hopf map, we first need to express the complex numbers z and w in terms of their real and imaginary parts. Let z = x + yi and w = u + vi, where x, y, u, and v are real numbers.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the condition |z|^2 + |w|^2 = 1 as follows:\n\n(x^2 + y^2) + (u^2 + v^2) = 1.\n\nNext, we compute the product z * conj(w):\n\nz * conj(w) = (x + yi)(u - vi) = xu + yv + i(yu - xv).\n\nNow, we can express the Hopf map h(z, w) in terms of real coordinates:\n\nh(x, y, u, v) = (xu + yv, yu - xv).\n\nTo map this to the 2-sphere S^2 in R^3, we can use the stereographic projection. The stereographic projection maps a point (x, y, z) in R^3 to a point (X, Y, Z) on the 2-sphere S^2 as follows:\n\nX = 2x / (1 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2),\nY = 2y / (1 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2),\nZ = 2z / (1 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2).\n\nApplying the stereographic projection to h(x, y, u, v), we get:\n\nX = 2(xu + yv) / (1 + (xu + yv)^2 + (yu - xv)^2),\nY = 2(yu - xv) / (1 + (xu + yv)^2 + (yu - xv)^2),\nZ = (1 - (xu + yv)^2 - (yu - xv)^2) / (1 + (xu + yv)^2 + (yu - xv)^2).\n\nThis gives us the Hopf map h: S^3 -> S^2 in terms of real coordinates."
