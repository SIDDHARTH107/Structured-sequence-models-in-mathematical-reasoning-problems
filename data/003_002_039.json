    "message_2": "First, we need to find the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the legs of the triangle (base and height), and c is the hypotenuse. In this case, a = 8cm and b = 15cm.\n\n8^2 + 15^2 = c^2\n64 + 225 = c^2\n289 = c^2\nc = √289\nc = 17cm\n\nNow that we have the hypotenuse, we can find the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios of the angle (let's call it θ) opposite to the base:\n\nsin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse = height/hypotenuse = 15/17\n\ncos(θ) = adjacent/hypotenuse = base/hypotenuse = 8/17\n\ntan(θ) = opposite/adjacent = height/base = 15/8\n\nSo, the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios of the angle opposite to the base are:\n\nsin(θ) = 15/17\ncos(θ) = 8/17\ntan(θ) = 15/8"
