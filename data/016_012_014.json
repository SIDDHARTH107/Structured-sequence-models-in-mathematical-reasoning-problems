    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, and its length increases with each iteration. In each iteration, the curve is divided into 9 equal parts, and each part is scaled down to 1/3 of its original length. \n\nTo find the length of the Peano curve after the 6th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial Length) * (Scaling Factor)^(Number of Iterations)\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, the scaling factor is 9/3 = 3, and the number of iterations is 6.\n\nLength = 1 * (3)^6\nLength = 1 * 729\nLength = 729 units\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve after the 6th iteration is 729 units."
