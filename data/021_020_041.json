    "message_2": "The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. The algorithm consists of three types of bees: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The algorithm iteratively updates the positions of these bees to find the optimal solution.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the ABC algorithm to find the minimum value of f(x) over the interval [0, 5]:\n\n1. Initialize the population of bees with random positions (x values) in the interval [0, 5].\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each bee using the function f(x).\n3. Repeat the following steps until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations):\n   a. Employed bees phase: For each employed bee, generate a new position in the neighborhood of its current position and evaluate its fitness. If the new position has better fitness, replace the current position with the new one.\n   b. Onlooker bees phase: Select the best positions from the employed bees based on their fitness. For each onlooker bee, generate a new position in the neighborhood of the selected position and evaluate its fitness. If the new position has better fitness, replace the selected position with the new one.\n   c. Scout bees phase: If an employed bee's position has not been improved for a certain number of iterations, replace it with a new random position in the interval [0, 5].\n   d. Update the best solution found so far.\n\nAfter the algorithm converges or reaches the stopping criterion, the best solution found is the minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding x value.\n\nNote that the ABC algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, and the solution found may not be the exact global minimum. However, it can provide a good approximation of the optimal solution. To improve the accuracy of the solution, you can increase the population size, the number of iterations, or fine-tune other algorithm parameters."
