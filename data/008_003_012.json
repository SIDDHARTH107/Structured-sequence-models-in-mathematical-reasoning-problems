    "message_2": "To find the rank of the given matrix, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to bring it to its row echelon form or reduced row echelon form. Let's perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nOriginal matrix:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nSubtract 4 times the first row from the second row:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & -3 & -6 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nSubtract 7 times the first row from the third row:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & -3 & -6 \\\\\n0 & -6 & -12 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nDivide the second row by -3:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & -6 & -12 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nAdd 6 times the second row to the third row:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe matrix is now in row echelon form. We can see that there are two non-zero rows, so the rank of the matrix is 2."
