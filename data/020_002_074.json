    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products A and B. To make one unit of product A, they require 2 units of raw material 1, 4 units of raw material 2 and 1 unit of raw material 3. To make one unit of product B they require 3 units of raw material 1, 1 unit of raw material 2 and 2 units of raw material 3.  The company has 200 units of raw material 1, 120 units of raw material 2 and 150 units of raw material 3. If the company wants to maximize their profit by producing the products, where the profit of one unit of product A is 50 and that of B is 65, what should be the production levels of A and B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for raw materials are as follows:\n\n1. Raw material 1: 2x + 3y ≤ 200\n2. Raw material 2: 4x + y ≤ 120\n3. Raw material 3: x + 2y ≤ 150\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 50x + 65y\n\nTo find the production levels of A and B, we need to solve this linear programming problem. We can start by finding the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 200\n   y ≤ (200 - 2x) / 3\n\n2. 4x + y ≤ 120\n   y ≤ 120 - 4x\n\n3. x + 2y ≤ 150\n   y ≤ (150 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0,0), (0,50), (20,40), (30,0). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. Profit at (0,0): 50(0) + 65(0) = 0\n2. Profit at (0,50): 50(0) + 65(50) = 3250\n3. Profit at (20,40): 50(20) + 65(40) = 1000 + 2600 = 3600\n4. Profit at (30,0): 50(30) + 65(0) = 1500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (20,40), with a profit of 3600. Therefore, the company should produce 20 units of product A and 40 units of product B to maximize their profit."
