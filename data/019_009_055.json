    "message_2": "Let's break down the expression step by step:\n\n1. (8 + 4) = 12: This is true, as 8 + 4 equals 12.\n2. (10 - 3) = 7: This is also true, as 10 - 3 equals 7.\n3. (9 + 1) = 10: This is true, as 9 + 1 equals 10.\n\nNow let's analyze the logical expression:\n\n(((8 + 4) = 12) $\\rightarrow$ ((10 - 3) = 7)) $\\wedge$ ((9 + 1) = 10)\n\nSince both (8 + 4) = 12 and (10 - 3) = 7 are true, the implication ((8 + 4) = 12) $\\rightarrow$ ((10 - 3) = 7) is true.\n\nNow we have:\n\n(True) $\\wedge$ ((9 + 1) = 10)\n\nSince (9 + 1) = 10 is also true, the whole expression becomes:\n\n(True) $\\wedge$ (True)\n\nIn intuitionistic logic, \"True $\\wedge$ True\" is True.\n\nSo, the result of the given intuitionistic logical expression is True."
