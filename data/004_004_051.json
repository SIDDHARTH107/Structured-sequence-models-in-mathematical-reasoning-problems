    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = x^2 + 3x - 1 between x = 0 and x = 5, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 5.\n\nThe function is y = x^2 + 3x - 1. Let's integrate it:\n\nâˆ«(x^2 + 3x - 1) dx = (1/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 - x + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 5:\n\n[(1/3)(5)^3 + (3/2)(5)^2 - (5)] - [(1/3)(0)^3 + (3/2)(0)^2 - (0)]\n\n= [(1/3)(125) + (3/2)(25) - 5] - [0]\n\n= [41.67 + 37.5 - 5] - [0]\n\n= 74.17\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = x^2 + 3x - 1 between x = 0 and x = 5 is approximately 74.17 square units."
