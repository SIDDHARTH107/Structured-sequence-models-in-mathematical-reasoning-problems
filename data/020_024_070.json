    "message_1": "Suppose a company manufactures a certain product and sells it at $60 per unit. The production cost for each unit is $30. The company wants to increase its profit by optimizing the selling price. If the market demand equation for the product is q = 500 - 5p, where q is the quantity demanded and p is the selling price in dollars, what should be the selling price per unit to maximize the company's profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the company's profit, we need to find the selling price per unit that maximizes the profit function. The profit function can be defined as:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nRevenue is the product of the selling price (p) and the quantity demanded (q), and the cost is the product of the production cost per unit and the quantity demanded (q). So, the profit function can be written as:\n\nProfit = pq - 30q\n\nNow, we need to substitute the market demand equation (q = 500 - 5p) into the profit function:\n\nProfit = p(500 - 5p) - 30(500 - 5p)\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\nProfit = 500p - 5p^2 - 15000 + 150p\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nProfit = -5p^2 + 650p - 15000\n\nTo find the selling price that maximizes the profit, we need to find the vertex of this quadratic equation. The x-coordinate of the vertex (p) can be found using the formula:\n\np = -b / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = -5 and b = 650, so:\n\np = -650 / (2 * -5)\n\np = 65\n\nSo, the selling price per unit that maximizes the company's profit is $65."
