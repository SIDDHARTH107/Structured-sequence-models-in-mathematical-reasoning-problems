    "message_1": "A study was conducted on the age distribution of students in a university. A random sample of 100 students was taken, and their ages were recorded. The sample mean and standard deviation were calculated to be 21.5 years and 3.2 years, respectively. Using bootstrapping, estimate the standard error of the mean for this sample.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the standard error of the mean using bootstrapping, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a large number of bootstrap samples from the original sample (with replacement). In this case, let's draw 1000 bootstrap samples, each containing 100 students.\n2. Calculate the mean of each bootstrap sample.\n3. Calculate the standard deviation of the means obtained in step 2.\n\nHowever, since we don't have the actual data, we can use the formula for the standard error of the mean as an approximation:\n\nStandard Error of the Mean (SEM) = Standard Deviation (SD) / sqrt(Sample Size)\n\nIn this case, the sample size is 100, and the standard deviation is 3.2 years:\n\nSEM = 3.2 / sqrt(100)\nSEM = 3.2 / 10\nSEM â‰ˆ 0.32 years\n\nSo, the estimated standard error of the mean for this sample is approximately 0.32 years."
