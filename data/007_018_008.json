    "message_2": "The Goldbach Conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This conjecture has been tested extensively for even integers up to very large values, and it has been found to hold true in all tested cases. However, it remains unproven, so we cannot definitively say that there is no smallest even integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.\n\nIf the Goldbach Conjecture is proven to be true, then there would be no such even integer. If it is proven to be false, then there would be a smallest even integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, but we do not currently know what that integer would be."
