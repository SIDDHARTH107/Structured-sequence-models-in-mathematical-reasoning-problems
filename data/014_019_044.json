    "message_1": "Suppose a message has been encrypted using a transposition cipher and the length of the message is 150 characters. If the message is divided into 15 rows and encrypted, how long will each row be?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of each row, you need to divide the total number of characters by the number of rows. In this case, the message has 150 characters and is divided into 15 rows.\n\nLength of each row = Total number of characters / Number of rows\nLength of each row = 150 / 15\nLength of each row = 10\n\nSo, each row will be 10 characters long."
