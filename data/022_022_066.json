    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of a function, we need to work with a real-valued function of a real variable. The function f(z) = |z|, where z is a complex number, is not suitable for finding the Fourier transform directly. However, we can consider the real and imaginary parts of z separately and find the Fourier transform of the absolute value function for real numbers.\n\nLet x be a real number, and let g(x) = |x|. The Fourier transform of g(x) is given by:\n\nG(k) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} g(x) e^{-2πikx} dx\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts, one for x < 0 and one for x > 0:\n\nG(k) = ∫_{-∞}^{0} (-x) e^{-2πikx} dx + ∫_{0}^{∞} x e^{-2πikx} dx\n\nWe can solve these integrals using integration by parts:\n\nLet u = -x and dv = e^{-2πikx} dx for the first integral, and u = x and dv = e^{-2πikx} dx for the second integral. Then, du = -dx and v = (-1/(2πik)) e^{-2πikx} for the first integral, and du = dx and v = (-1/(2πik)) e^{-2πikx} for the second integral.\n\nNow, we can apply integration by parts:\n\nG(k) = [(-x)(-1/(2πik)) e^{-2πikx}]_{-∞}^{0} - ∫_{-∞}^{0} (-1/(2πik)) e^{-2πikx} (-dx) + [(x)(-1/(2πik)) e^{-2πikx}]_{0}^{∞} - ∫_{0}^{∞} (-1/(2πik)) e^{-2πikx} dx\n\nG(k) = (1/(2πik)) ∫_{-∞}^{0} e^{-2πikx} dx + (1/(2πik)) ∫_{0}^{∞} e^{-2πikx} dx\n\nNow, we can combine the integrals:\n\nG(k) = (1/(2πik)) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^{-2πikx} dx\n\nThis integral is the Fourier transform of the sign function, which is given by:\n\nG(k) = (1/(2πik)) (2π) i\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform of the absolute value function g(x) = |x| is:\n\nG(k) = 1/k"
