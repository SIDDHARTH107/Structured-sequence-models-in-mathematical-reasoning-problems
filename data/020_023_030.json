    "message_1": "Sure! Here is an example of a problem on optimal portfolio selection for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose you are an investor with $500,000 to invest in two assets: stock A and stock B. The expected return and standard deviation for each stock are given in the table below:\n\n| Asset | Expected Return | Standard Deviation |\n|-------|----------------|--------------------|\n| A     | 10%            | 15%                 |\n| B     | 15%            | 20%                 |\n\nAssume that the returns of the two stocks are uncorrelated. What is the optimal investment strategy that minimizes the portfolio risk while achieving an expected return of 12%?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal investment strategy, we need to determine the weights of stock A and stock B in the portfolio that minimize the portfolio risk (standard deviation) while achieving an expected return of 12%.\n\nLet x be the weight of stock A in the portfolio, and (1-x) be the weight of stock B. The expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as:\n\nRp = x * Expected Return of A + (1-x) * Expected Return of B\n\nWe want to achieve an expected return of 12%, so:\n\n0.12 = 0.1x + 0.15(1-x)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n0.12 = 0.1x + 0.15 - 0.15x\n0.12 - 0.15 = -0.05x\nx = (0.12 - 0.15) / -0.05\nx ≈ 0.6\n\nSo, the weight of stock A in the portfolio is approximately 0.6, and the weight of stock B is approximately 0.4 (1 - 0.6).\n\nNow, we can calculate the portfolio risk (standard deviation). Since the returns of the two stocks are uncorrelated, the portfolio variance (σ²) is:\n\nσ² = x² * (Standard Deviation of A)² + (1-x)² * (Standard Deviation of B)²\n\nσ² = (0.6)² * (0.15)² + (0.4)² * (0.20)²\nσ² = 0.36 * 0.0225 + 0.16 * 0.04\nσ² ≈ 0.01494\n\nNow, we can find the portfolio standard deviation (σ) by taking the square root of the portfolio variance:\n\nσ = √0.01494\nσ ≈ 0.12225\n\nSo, the optimal investment strategy that minimizes the portfolio risk while achieving an expected return of 12% is to invest approximately 60% of the $500,000 in stock A and 40% in stock B. The portfolio risk (standard deviation) is approximately 12.23%."
