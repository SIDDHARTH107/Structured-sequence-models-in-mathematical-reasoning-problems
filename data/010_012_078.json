    "message_2": "To determine if f is a smooth function, we need to check if it is differentiable at every point in its domain. A function is smooth if it has continuous derivatives of all orders.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when x is irrational. The function f(x) = x^(5/2) is smooth for all x in M because it is a power function with a rational exponent greater than 1. This means that it has continuous derivatives of all orders for x ≥ 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when x is rational. The function f(x) = 0 is also smooth for all x in M because it is a constant function, which has continuous derivatives of all orders for x ≥ 0.\n\nHowever, we need to check if the function f is differentiable at the points where it transitions between the two cases, i.e., at the points where x changes from rational to irrational or vice versa.\n\nLet's consider a point x₀ in M. If x₀ is irrational, then f(x₀) = x₀^(5/2). If x₀ is rational, then f(x₀) = 0. In either case, we can find a sequence of rational numbers {r_n} and a sequence of irrational numbers {i_n} that both converge to x₀. \n\nFor the sequence of rational numbers {r_n}, we have f(r_n) = 0 for all n. For the sequence of irrational numbers {i_n}, we have f(i_n) = i_n^(5/2) for all n. Since the limit of f(r_n) as n approaches infinity is 0 and the limit of f(i_n) as n approaches infinity is x₀^(5/2), the function f is not continuous at x₀. \n\nSince f is not continuous at x₀, it cannot be differentiable at x₀. Therefore, f is not a smooth function."
