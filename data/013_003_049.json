    "message_1": "Consider an Ultimatum Game with two players. The first player, A, is offered a sum of $100 and they must propose a division of this amount with the second player, B. If player B accepts, then the money is divided according to A's proposal. If player B rejects, then neither player receives anything. If player B's minimum acceptable offer is $30 or more, what offer should player A make in order to maximize their chances of acceptance?",
    "message_2": "In order to maximize their chances of acceptance, player A should offer player B the minimum acceptable amount, which is $30. This way, player A can keep the maximum amount for themselves ($70) while still meeting player B's minimum requirement, thus increasing the likelihood that player B will accept the offer."
