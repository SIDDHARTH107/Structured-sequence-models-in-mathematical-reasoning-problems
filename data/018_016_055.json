    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B (A x B) and B and A (B x A).\n\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B} = {(1, 2), (1, 3)}\n\nB x A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A} = {(2, 1), (3, 1)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of (A x B) and (B x A) and the union of (B x A) and (A x B).\n\n(A x B) union (B x A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1)}\n\n(B x A) union (A x B) = {(2, 1), (3, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, both (A x B) union (B x A) and (B x A) union (A x B) result in the same set. However, this does not imply that the Cartesian product is commutative with respect to union. The commutativity of the Cartesian product would mean that A x B = B x A, which is not the case here, as A x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3)} and B x A = {(2, 1), (3, 1)}. Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union."
