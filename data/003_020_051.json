    "message_1": "A flagpole stands vertically on level ground. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of the pole is 42°, and from a point 10 meters closer to the pole, the angle of elevation is 52°. How tall is the flagpole?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the flagpole as h, the distance from the first point to the base of the flagpole as x, and the distance from the second point to the base of the flagpole as (x-10).\n\nWe can use the tangent function to set up two equations:\n\ntan(42°) = h/x\ntan(52°) = h/(x-10)\n\nNow we can solve the system of equations. First, we can solve the first equation for h:\n\nh = x * tan(42°)\n\nNext, we can substitute this expression for h into the second equation:\n\ntan(52°) = (x * tan(42°)) / (x-10)\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\nx * tan(52°) = x * tan(42°) - 10 * tan(42°) * tan(52°)\n\nx * (tan(52°) - tan(42°)) = -10 * tan(42°) * tan(52°)\n\nx = -10 * tan(42°) * tan(52°) / (tan(52°) - tan(42°))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nx ≈ 32.09 meters\n\nNow we can find the height of the flagpole by substituting the value of x back into the equation for h:\n\nh = 32.09 * tan(42°)\n\nh ≈ 23.07 meters\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is approximately 23.07 meters."
