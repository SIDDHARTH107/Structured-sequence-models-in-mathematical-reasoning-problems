    "message_2": "The given signal is already in the sum of sinusoids form, which is:\n\n$f(t) = 2\\sin(10\\pi t) + 5\\cos(6\\pi t) + \\cos(20\\pi t)$\n\nWe can rewrite the sine term as a cosine term with a phase shift:\n\n$2\\sin(10\\pi t) = 2\\cos(10\\pi t - \\frac{\\pi}{2})$\n\nNow, the signal is in the sum of cosines form:\n\n$f(t) = 2\\cos(10\\pi t - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) + 5\\cos(6\\pi t) + \\cos(20\\pi t)$\n\nEach term represents a component of the signal with its amplitude, frequency, and phase shift:\n\n1. Component 1:\n   - Amplitude: 2\n   - Frequency: $10\\pi$ rad/s (or 5 Hz)\n   - Phase shift: $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n\n2. Component 2:\n   - Amplitude: 5\n   - Frequency: $6\\pi$ rad/s (or 3 Hz)\n   - Phase shift: 0\n\n3. Component 3:\n   - Amplitude: 1\n   - Frequency: $20\\pi$ rad/s (or 10 Hz)\n   - Phase shift: 0\n\nSo, the amplitudes and frequencies of each component are:\n\n- Component 1: Amplitude = 2, Frequency = 5 Hz\n- Component 2: Amplitude = 5, Frequency = 3 Hz\n- Component 3: Amplitude = 1, Frequency = 10 Hz"
