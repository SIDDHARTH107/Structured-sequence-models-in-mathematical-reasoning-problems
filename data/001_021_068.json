    "message_2": "To find the real roots of the given polynomial equation x^3 + 5x^2 - 8x - 48 = 0, we can use the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root p/q, then p is a factor of the constant term, and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn our case, the constant term is -48, and the leading coefficient is 1. The factors of -48 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, ±16, ±24, and ±48. Since the leading coefficient is 1, the possible rational roots are the factors of -48.\n\nNow, we can test these possible rational roots by substituting them into the polynomial equation:\n\n1. x = 1: (1)^3 + 5(1)^2 - 8(1) - 48 = -50 (not a root)\n2. x = -1: (-1)^3 + 5(-1)^2 - 8(-1) - 48 = -40 (not a root)\n3. x = 2: (2)^3 + 5(2)^2 - 8(2) - 48 = 0 (a root)\n\nWe found a rational root x = 2. Now, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(x^3 + 5x^2 - 8x - 48) / (x - 2) = x^2 + 7x + 24\n\nNow, we have the quadratic equation x^2 + 7x + 24 = 0. We can use the quadratic formula to find the remaining real roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 7, and c = 24:\n\nx = (-7 ± √(7^2 - 4(1)(24))) / 2(1)\nx = (-7 ± √(49 - 96)) / 2\nx = (-7 ± √(-47)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no more real roots. Therefore, the only real root of the polynomial equation x^3 + 5x^2 - 8x - 48 = 0 is x = 2."
