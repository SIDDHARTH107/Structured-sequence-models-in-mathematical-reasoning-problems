    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will use the augmented matrix and row reduction (Gaussian elimination) to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| 3  2 -1 | 6 |\n| 1 -1  2 | 1 |\n| 2  1  1 | 1 |\n\nNow, we will perform row reduction to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n| 1 -1  2 | 1 |\n| 3  2 -1 | 6 |\n| 2  1  1 | 1 |\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-3 * Row 1) + Row 2 and Row 3 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 3:\n\n| 1 -1  2 |  1  |\n| 0  5 -7 |  3  |\n| 0  3 -3 | -1  |\n\n3. Divide Row 2 by 5 to get a 1 in the second row, second column:\n\n| 1 -1  2 |  1  |\n| 0  1 -7/5 |  3/5  |\n| 0  3 -3 | -1  |\n\n4. Replace Row 1 with (Row 2 + Row 1) and Row 3 with (-3 * Row 2) + Row 3:\n\n| 1  0  1/5 |  8/5  |\n| 0  1 -7/5 |  3/5  |\n| 0  0  2 | -2  |\n\n5. Divide Row 3 by 2:\n\n| 1  0  1/5 |  8/5  |\n| 0  1 -7/5 |  3/5  |\n| 0  0  1 | -1  |\n\n6. Replace Row 1 with (-1/5 * Row 3) + Row 1 and Row 2 with (7/5 * Row 3) + Row 2:\n\n| 1  0  0 |  1  |\n| 0  1  0 |  0  |\n| 0  0  1 | -1  |\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form, and we can read the solution directly:\n\nx = 1\ny = 0\nz = -1\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the system of equations are x = 1, y = 0, and z = -1."
