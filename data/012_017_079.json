    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 6 vertices and 7 edges. Determine whether this graph has a perfect matching or not.",
    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges that covers every vertex exactly once. In other words, each vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex, and no two edges share a vertex.\n\nFor a graph to have a perfect matching, it must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The graph must have an even number of vertices.\n2. The graph must be connected, meaning that there is a path between every pair of vertices.\n\nIn this case, the graph has 6 vertices, which is an even number, so the first condition is satisfied. However, we cannot determine whether the graph is connected or not just by knowing the number of vertices and edges. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether this graph has a perfect matching or not without more information about the structure of the graph."
