    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the technique of Ito's lemma. Ito's lemma states that if X(t) is a stochastic process satisfying the stochastic differential equation:\n\ndX(t) = μ(t, X(t))dt + σ(t, X(t))dW(t)\n\nand if f(t, X(t)) is a twice continuously differentiable function, then the process Y(t) = f(t, X(t)) satisfies the following stochastic differential equation:\n\ndY(t) = ( ∂f/∂t + μ ∂f/∂x + 0.5 σ^2 ∂^2f/∂x^2 ) dt + σ ∂f/∂x dW(t)\n\nIn our case, we have μ(t, X(t)) = 2X(t) and σ(t, X(t)) = 3. We want to find E[X(1)] and Var[X(1)]. To do this, we will first find the process Y(t) = ln(X(t)). \n\nApplying Ito's lemma to f(t, X(t)) = ln(X(t)), we have:\n\n∂f/∂t = 0 (since f does not depend on t)\n∂f/∂x = 1/X(t)\n∂^2f/∂x^2 = -1/X(t)^2\n\nPlugging these values into Ito's lemma, we get:\n\ndY(t) = (0 + 2X(t) * 1/X(t) - 0.5 * 3^2 * (-1/X(t)^2)) dt + 3 * 1/X(t) dW(t)\ndY(t) = (2 - 4.5/X(t)) dt + 3/X(t) dW(t)\n\nNow, we integrate both sides from 0 to 1:\n\n∫[0 to 1] dY(t) = ∫[0 to 1] (2 - 4.5/X(t)) dt + ∫[0 to 1] 3/X(t) dW(t)\n\nSince Y(t) = ln(X(t)), we have:\n\nln(X(1)) - ln(X(0)) = ∫[0 to 1] (2 - 4.5/X(t)) dt + ∫[0 to 1] 3/X(t) dW(t)\n\nGiven X(0) = 1, we have:\n\nln(X(1)) = 2 + ∫[0 to 1] (-4.5/X(t)) dt + ∫[0 to 1] 3/X(t) dW(t)\n\nTaking the expectation of both sides:\n\nE[ln(X(1))] = 2 + E[∫[0 to 1] (-4.5/X(t)) dt] + E[∫[0 to 1] 3/X(t) dW(t)]\n\nSince the expectation of the stochastic integral is zero, we have:\n\nE[ln(X(1))] = 2 + E[∫[0 to 1] (-4.5/X(t)) dt]\n\nNow, we exponentiate both sides:\n\nE[X(1)] = e^(2 + E[∫[0 to 1] (-4.5/X(t)) dt])\n\nSince X(t) is a positive process, we can approximate E[∫[0 to 1] (-4.5/X(t)) dt] ≈ -4.5 * E[∫[0 to 1] (1/X(t)) dt] ≈ 0. Thus,\n\nE[X(1)] ≈ e^2\n\nNow, we need to find the variance of X(1). We know that:\n\nVar[X(1)] = E[X(1)^2] - (E[X(1)])^2\n\nWe already found E[X(1)] ≈ e^2. To find E[X(1)^2], we can apply Ito's lemma to f(t, X(t)) = (X(t))^2:\n\n∂f/∂t = 0\n∂f/∂x = 2X(t)\n∂^2f/∂x^2 = 2\n\nPlugging these values into Ito's lemma, we get:\n\nd(X(t)^2) = (2X(t) * 2X(t) + 0.5 * 3^2 * 2) dt + 3 * 2X(t) dW(t)\n\nIntegrating both sides from 0 to 1:\n\nX(1)^2 - X(0)^2 = ∫[0 to 1] (4X(t)^2 + 4.5) dt + ∫[0 to 1] 6X(t) dW(t)\n\nGiven X(0) = 1, we have:\n\nX(1)^2 = 1 + ∫[0 to 1] (4X(t)^2 + 4.5) dt + ∫[0 to 1] 6X(t) dW(t)\n\nTaking the expectation of both sides:\n\nE[X(1)^2] = 1 + E[∫[0 to 1] (4X(t)^2 + 4.5) dt] + E[∫[0 to 1] 6X(t) dW(t)]\n\nSince the expectation of the stochastic integral is zero, we have:\n\nE[X(1)^2] = 1 + E[∫[0 to 1] (4X(t)^2 + 4.5) dt]\n\nNow, we can approximate E[∫[0 to 1] (4X(t)^2 + 4.5) dt] ≈ ∫[0 to 1] (4E[X(t)^2] + 4.5) dt. Since E[X(t)^2] ≈ (E[X(t)])^2 for a positive process, we have:\n\nE[X(1)^2] ≈ 1 + ∫[0 to 1] (4(e^2)^2 + 4.5) dt\nE[X(1)^2] ≈ 1 + (16e^4 + 4.5)\n\nFinally, we can find the variance of X(1):\n\nVar[X(1)] = E[X(1)^2] - (E[X(1)])^2\nVar[X(1)] ≈ (1 + 16e^4 + 4.5) - (e^2)^2\nVar[X(1)] ≈ 16e^4 - e^4 + 4.5\n\nSo, the expected value of X(1) is approximately e^2, and the variance of X(1) is approximately 16e^4 - e^4 + 4.5."
