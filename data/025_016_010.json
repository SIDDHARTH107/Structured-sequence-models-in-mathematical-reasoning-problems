    "message_2": "To find a birational morphism from $C$ to $D$, we need to find a rational map $\\phi: C \\to D$ that is invertible, i.e., there exists a rational map $\\psi: D \\to C$ such that $\\phi \\circ \\psi = \\text{id}_D$ and $\\psi \\circ \\phi = \\text{id}_C$.\n\nLet's try to find a linear transformation of the form $(x, y) \\mapsto (ax + b, cy + d)$ that maps points on $C$ to points on $D$. We have:\n\n$$(cy + d)^2 = (ax + b)^3 + 8(ax + b) + 16$$\n\nSubstituting $y^2 = x^3 + 4x + 4$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$$(c(x^3 + 4x + 4) + d)^2 = (ax + b)^3 + 8(ax + b) + 16$$\n\nNow we need to find constants $a, b, c, d$ such that this equation holds for all $x$. Comparing the coefficients of the powers of $x$, we get the following system of equations:\n\n1. $a^3 = c^2$\n2. $3a^2b = 4c^2$\n3. $3ab^2 + 8a = 8c$\n4. $b^3 + 8b + 16 = 4d^2$\n\nFrom equation (1), we have $c = a\\sqrt{a}$, and substituting this into equation (2), we get $3a^2b = 4a^3 \\Rightarrow b = \\frac{4}{3}a$. Now substituting these values into equation (3), we get:\n\n$$3a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}a\\right)^2 + 8a = 8a\\sqrt{a} \\Rightarrow 16a^3 + 8a = 8a\\sqrt{a}$$\n\nDividing by $8a$, we get $2a^2 + 1 = \\sqrt{a}$. Squaring both sides, we have $4a^4 + 4a^2 + 1 = a$. This is a quartic equation in $a$, which can be solved numerically or by other methods. One possible solution is $a = 1$. In this case, we have $c = 1$ and $b = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into equation (4), we get:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^3 + \\frac{32}{3} + 16 = 4d^2 \\Rightarrow \\frac{64}{27} + \\frac{32}{3} + 16 = 4d^2$$\n\nSolving for $d$, we get $d = \\pm \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThus, we have found a birational morphism $\\phi: C \\to D$ given by:\n\n$$(x, y) \\mapsto \\left(x + \\frac{4}{3}, y \\pm \\frac{2}{3}\\right)$$\n\nNow we need to find the inverse map $\\psi: D \\to C$. Since the transformation is linear, we can simply invert the coefficients:\n\n$$(x', y') \\mapsto \\left(x' - \\frac{4}{3}, y' \\mp \\frac{2}{3}\\right)$$\n\nSo, there exists a birational morphism from $C$ to $D$ given by $\\phi(x, y) = \\left(x + \\frac{4}{3}, y \\pm \\frac{2}{3}\\right)$ with inverse $\\psi(x', y') = \\left(x' - \\frac{4}{3}, y' \\mp \\frac{2}{3}\\right)$."
