    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective units\n- n is the total number of units produced in a week (7 days)\n- k is the number of defective units\n- p is the probability of a unit being defective (2% or 0.02)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of units produced in a week:\n\nn = 1,000 units/day * 7 days = 7,000 units\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 15 defective units, which means we need to find the probability of having 15, 16, 17, ..., up to 7,000 defective units. To find the probability of having at least 15 defective units, we can calculate the probability of having 0 to 14 defective units and subtract that from 1:\n\nP(X >= 15) = 1 - P(X < 15) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 14)]\n\nNow, we will calculate the probabilities for each value of k from 0 to 14 using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWe will sum these probabilities and subtract the result from 1 to find the probability of having at least 15 defective units:\n\nP(X >= 15) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 14)]\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities and summing them, we get:\n\nP(X >= 15) = 1 - 0.0016 = 0.9984\n\nSo, the probability of having at least 15 defective units produced in a week is approximately 0.9984 or 99.84%."
