The company has collected data on the sales of each type of clothing over the past 6 months. Using Principal Component Analysis, find the first Principal Component (PC1) that explains the most variance in the sales data.\n\nSales Data (in thousands):\n- Shirts: 10, 12, 8, 11, 9, 7\n- Pants: 6, 8, 12, 9, 10, 11\n- Dresses: 5, 7, 10, 6, 8, 9\n- Skirts: 9, 6, 8, 7, 11, 12\n- Jackets: 3, 5, 6, 7, 4, 9",
    "message_2": "To find the first Principal Component (PC1) using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), follow these steps:\n\n1. Standardize the data\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix\n3. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix\n4. Choose the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue as PC1\n\nStep 1: Standardize the data\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean and standard deviation for each type of clothing:\n\nShirts: mean = (10+12+8+11+9+7)/6 = 9.5, std = 1.87\nPants: mean = (6+8+12+9+10+11)/6 = 9.33, std = 2.25\nDresses: mean = (5+7+10+6+8+9)/6 = 7.5, std = 1.87\nSkirts: mean = (9+6+8+7+11+12)/6 = 8.83, std = 2.48\nJackets: mean = (3+5+6+7+4+9)/6 = 5.67, std = 1.97\n\nNow, subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation for each data point:\n\nShirts: (0.27, 1.34, -0.80, 0.80, -0.27, -1.34)\nPants: (-1.48, -0.59, 1.19, -0.15, 0.30, 0.74)\nDresses: (-1.34, -0.27, 1.34, -0.80, 0.27, 0.80)\nSkirts: (0.07, -1.14, -0.34, -0.74, 0.87, 1.28)\nJackets: (-1.35, -0.34, 0.17, 0.68, -0.85, 1.69)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the covariance matrix\n\nUsing the standardized data, calculate the covariance matrix:\n\n|  1.00  -0.15   0.99   0.14  -0.98 |\n| -0.15   1.00  -0.15  -0.99   0.15 |\n|  0.99  -0.15   1.00   0.14  -0.98 |\n|  0.14  -0.99   0.14   1.00  -0.15 |\n| -0.98   0.15  -0.98  -0.15   1.00 |\n\nStep 3: Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix\n\nEigenvalues: λ1 = 3.49, λ2 = 1.51, λ3 = 0.00, λ4 = 0.00, λ5 = 0.00\nEigenvectors: v1 = (0.45, -0.45, 0.45, -0.45, -0.45), v2 = (-0.45, -0.45, -0.45, 0.45, 0.45), v3, v4, and v5 are not relevant for PC1.\n\nStep 4: Choose the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue as PC1\n\nThe eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue (λ1 = 3.49) is v1 = (0.45, -0.45, 0.45, -0.45, -0.45).\n\nSo, the first Principal Component (PC1) is (0.45, -0.45, 0.45, -0.45, -0.45)."
