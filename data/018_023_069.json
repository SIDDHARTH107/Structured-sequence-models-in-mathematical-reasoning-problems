    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3} - {2} = {1, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) △ A and A △ (B △ A).\n\n1. (A △ B) △ A:\n(A △ B) △ A = ({1, 3} ∪ {1, 2}) - ({1, 3} ∩ {1, 2}) = {1, 2, 3} - {1} = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) △ A with A:\n((A △ B) △ A) × A = {2, 3} × {1, 2} = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\n2.

However, this does not prove that it is always associative for all sets."
