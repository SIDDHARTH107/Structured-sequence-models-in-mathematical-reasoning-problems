The Investor has $10 and can choose to give any amount of money to the Responder. Whatever amount the Investor gives, it will be tripled by the experimenter, and the Responder will then decide how much of the tripled amount to give back to the Investor. If the Investor gives $x to the Responder and the Responder decides to give back $y, then the final payouts will be as follows:\n\n- Investor: $10 - $x + $3y\n- Responder: $x - $3y\n\nWhat is the optimal amount for the Investor to give the Responder in order to maximize their own payout assuming the Responder will act rationally to maximize their own payout too?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal amount for the Investor to give the Responder, we need to analyze the Responder's decision-making process first. The Responder will act rationally to maximize their own payout, which is given by the formula:\n\nResponder's payout = $x - $3y\n\nSince the Responder wants to maximize this payout, they will choose a value of $y$ that maximizes their payout given the value of $x$ (the amount the Investor gives).\n\nLet's differentiate the Responder's payout with respect to $y$:\n\nd(Responder's payout) / dy = d($x - $3y) / dy = -$3\n\nSince the derivative is constant and negative, the Responder's payout is a decreasing function of $y$. This means that the Responder will choose the smallest possible value of $y$ to maximize their payout. In this case, the smallest possible value of $y$ is 0, as the Responder can choose not to give anything back to the Investor.\n\nNow, let's analyze the Investor's decision-making process. The Investor's payout is given by the formula:\n\nInvestor's payout = $10 - $x + $3y\n\nSince the Responder will always choose $y = 0$, the Investor's payout becomes:\n\nInvestor's payout = $10 - $x\n\nTo maximize their payout, the Investor should choose the smallest possible value of $x$. In this case, the smallest possible value of $x$ is 0, as the Investor can choose not to give anything to the Responder.\n\nSo, the optimal amount for the Investor to give the Responder is $0. This way, the Investor maximizes their own payout, which will be $10, and the Responder's payout will be $0."
