    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem related to the Principal-Agent Problem in game theory:\n\nSuppose there is a company that wants to hire a sales agent to sell their product. The company knows that the agent has access to information about the market that they do not have. However, the company is concerned that the agent may not put forth their best effort to sell the product. To incentivize the agent to work hard, the company decides to offer a contract that pays a commission based on the number of products sold. Suppose the agent has two effort levels: High and Low. If the agent puts forth High effort, they will sell 100 units with probability 0.8 and 50 units with probability 0.2. If the agent puts forth Low effort, they will sell 50 units with probability 0.8 and 10 units with probability 0.2. The company's profits are $10 per unit sold, minus a fixed fee of $500 paid to the agent.\n\nWhat commission rate should the company offer to maximize their profit, and what effort level should the agent choose?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the commission rate as c. The company's profit function can be written as follows:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Commission - Fixed Fee\n\nFor High effort:\nExpected units sold = (0.8 * 100) + (0.2 * 50) = 80 + 10 = 90 units\nExpected revenue = 90 * $10 = $900\nExpected commission = 90 * c\nProfit_High = $900 - 90c - $500\n\nFor Low effort:\nExpected units sold = (0.8 * 50) + (0.2 * 10) = 40 + 2 = 42 units\nExpected revenue = 42 * $10 = $420\nExpected commission = 42 * c\nProfit_Low = $420 - 42c - $500\n\nThe company wants to set the commission rate c such that the agent chooses High effort. This means that the agent's expected commission from High effort should be greater than or equal to the expected commission from Low effort:\n\n90c >= 42c\n\nSolving for c, we get:\n\nc >= 42c / 90\nc >= 0.4667 (approximately)\n\nSo, the company should offer a commission rate of at least 46.67% to incentivize the agent to choose High effort. Note that this is the minimum commission rate required to make the agent indifferent between High and Low effort. The company may choose to offer a slightly higher commission rate to ensure that the agent strictly prefers High effort.\n\nWith this commission rate, the agent should choose the High effort level, as it will result in a higher expected commission."
