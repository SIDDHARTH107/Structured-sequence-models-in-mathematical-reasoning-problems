    "message_2": "To solve the equation z + 3i = 2 - 5i for z, we need to find the real part and the imaginary part of z.\n\nLet z = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit.\n\nNow, we can write the equation as:\n\na + bi + 3i = 2 - 5i\n\nNow, we can equate the real parts and the imaginary parts:\n\nReal parts: a = 2\nImaginary parts: b + 3 = -5\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb = -5 - 3\nb = -8\n\nSo, z = a + bi = 2 - 8i."
