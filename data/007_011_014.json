    "message_2": "A quadratic residue modulo n is an integer x such that there exists an integer y satisfying the congruence y^2 ≡ x (mod n). To find the quadratic residue of 14 modulo 19, we need to find a y such that y^2 ≡ 14 (mod 19).\n\nLet's check the squares of the integers from 1 to 18 (mod 19):\n\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 19)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 19)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 19)\n4^2 ≡ 16 (mod 19)\n5^2 ≡ 6 (mod 19)\n6^2 ≡ 17 (mod 19)\n7^2 ≡ 11 (mod 19)\n8^2 ≡ 7 (mod 19)\n9^2 ≡ 5 (mod 19)\n10^2 ≡ 5 (mod 19)\n11^2 ≡ 7 (mod 19)\n12^2 ≡ 11 (mod 19)\n13^2 ≡ 17 (mod 19)\n14^2 ≡ 6 (mod 19)\n15^2 ≡ 16 (mod 19)\n16^2 ≡ 9 (mod 19)\n17^2 ≡ 4 (mod 19)\n18^2 ≡ 1 (mod 19)\n\nNone of the squares of the integers from 1 to 18 are congruent to 14 modulo 19. Therefore, 14 is not a quadratic residue modulo 19."
