    "message_2": "(a) Prove that G has an element of order 2.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Since the order of G is 6, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The identity element has order 1, so we need to show that there exists an element of order 2.\n\nSuppose for contradiction that there is no element of order 2 in G. Then the only possible orders for the non-identity elements are 3 and 6. If there is an element of order 6, then G is cyclic and has an element of order 2 (namely, the square of the element of order 6), which contradicts our assumption. So all non-identity elements must have order 3.\n\nLet a and b be two distinct non-identity elements in G. Then the subgroup generated by a has three elements: {e, a, a^2}, and the subgroup generated by b has three elements: {e, b, b^2}. Since a and b are distinct, their subgroups must intersect only at the identity element. Therefore, we have at least 5 distinct elements in G: e, a, a^2, b, b^2. But G has only 6 elements, so the remaining element must be a product of some of these elements, say ab. However, (ab)^2 = a^2 * b^2, which cannot be the identity element since a^2 and b^2 are not the identity. This contradicts our assumption that there is no element of order 2 in G. Therefore, G must have an element of order 2.\n\n(b) Prove that G has at least one subgroup of order 3.\n\nBy Cauchy's theorem, if the order of G is divisible by a prime number p, then G has an element of order p. Since the order of G is 6, which is divisible by the prime number 3, G must have an element of order 3. Let x be an element of order 3 in G. Then the subgroup generated by x, denoted by <x>, has order 3 and consists of the elements {e, x, x^2}. Thus, G has at least one subgroup of order 3.\n\n(c) Use parts (a) and (b) to show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3.\n\nLet x be an element of order 3 and y be an element of order 2 in G. If there exists an element z in G with order 6, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C6, since a cyclic group of order 6 has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nIf there is no element of order 6 in G, then all non-identity elements must have orders 2 or 3. In this case, we claim that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3. The dihedral group D3 consists of the symmetries of an equilateral triangle and has 6 elements: the identity, two rotations (of order 3), and three reflections (of order 2). We can define a map φ: G → D3 as follows:\n\nφ(e) = identity\nφ(x) = 120-degree rotation\nφ(x^2) = 240-degree rotation\nφ(y) = reflection across one axis\nφ(xy) = reflection across another axis\nφ(x^2y) = reflection across the third axis\n\nWe can verify that this map is a homomorphism, as it preserves the group operation:\n\nφ(x^3) = φ(e) = identity\nφ(y^2) = φ(e) = identity\nφ((xy)^2) = φ(x^2yxy) = φ(x^3) = identity\n\nSince φ is a bijection and a homomorphism, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
