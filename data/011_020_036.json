    "message_1": "A company has six available employees to work on a project, but they only have the budget to hire three of them. In how many ways can they choose three workers for the project?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways to choose three workers from six employees, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of employees (6) and k is the number of workers to be chosen (3).\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!3!)\n\nC(6, 3) = (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(3*2*1))\n\nC(6, 3) = (720) / (6*6)\n\nC(6, 3) = 720 / 36\n\nC(6, 3) = 20\n\nSo there are 20 different ways to choose three workers from the six available employees."
