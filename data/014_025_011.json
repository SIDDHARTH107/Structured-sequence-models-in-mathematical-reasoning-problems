    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot provide the exact hexadecimal representation of the hash value without knowing the specific hash function being used. However, if we assume the hash function is SHA-256, a widely used cryptographic hash function, then the hexadecimal representation of the hash value for the input message \"hello world\" would be:\n\n`7509e5bda0c762d2bac7f90d758b5b2263fa01ccbc542ab5e3df163be08e6ca9`\n\nKeep in mind that different hash functions will produce different hash values for the same input message."
