    "message_1": "Suppose there are two players, A and B, in a Cheap Talk game. Player A has two actions (1 and 2) and player B has two actions (L and R). If A chooses action 1, B gets a payoff of 5 if they choose action L and 3 if they choose action R. If A chooses action 2, B gets a payoff of 7 if they choose action L and 1 if they choose action R. However, before A chooses an action, they can send a message to B. If A sends the message \"L\", B will know that A will choose action 1 with probability 0.9 and action 2 with probability 0.1. If A sends the message \"R\", B will know that A will choose action 1 with probability 0.1 and action 2 with probability 0.9. What is A's optimal message if they want to maximize their expected payoff?",
    "message_2": "To find A's optimal message, we need to calculate the expected payoff for B for each message and compare them. \n\n1. If A sends the message \"L\":\n- The probability of A choosing action 1 is 0.9, and B's payoff is 5 if they choose action L. So, the expected payoff for this case is 0.9 * 5 = 4.5.\n- The probability of A choosing action 2 is 0.1, and B's payoff is 7 if they choose action L. So, the expected payoff for this case is 0.1 * 7 = 0.7.\n- The total expected payoff for B if A sends the message \"L\" and B chooses action L is 4.5 + 0.7 = 5.2.\n\n2. If A sends the message \"R\":\n- The probability of A choosing action 1 is 0.1, and B's payoff is 3 if they choose action R. So, the expected payoff for this case is 0.1 * 3 = 0.3.\n- The probability of A choosing action 2 is 0.9, and B's payoff is 1 if they choose action R. So, the expected payoff for this case is 0.9 * 1 = 0.9.\n- The total expected payoff for B if A sends the message \"R\" and B chooses action R is 0.3 + 0.9 = 1.2.\n\nComparing the expected payoffs, we see that B's expected payoff is higher when A sends the message \"L\" (5.2) than when A sends the message \"R\" (1.2). Therefore, A's optimal message to maximize their expected payoff is \"L\"."
