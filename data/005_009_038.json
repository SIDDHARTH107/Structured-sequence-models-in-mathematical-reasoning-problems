    "message_2": "To calculate the median and mode of the dataset, we first need to organize the data in ascending order:\n\n{5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10}\n\nMedian:\nThe median is the middle value of the dataset when it is ordered. Since there are 10 scores (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values (5th and 6th values).\n\n5th value: 7\n6th value: 7\n\nMedian = (7 + 7) / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7\n\nMode:\nThe mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the dataset. We can see that the number 7 appears three times, which is more frequent than any other value.\n\nMode = 7\n\nSo, the median of the dataset is 7, and the mode is also 7."
