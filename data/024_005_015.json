    "message_1": "Consider the surface defined by the equation: \nz = x^2 - 2y^2\n\nWhat are the principal curvatures at the point (1, -1, 2) ?",
    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures at the point (1, -1, 2), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nGiven the surface z = x^2 - 2y^2, we can define the position vector r(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - 2v^2), where x = u and y = v.\n\nNow, we compute the first derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, -4v)\n\nNext, we compute the second derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, -4)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 0\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 16v^2\n\nAnd the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\nL = r_uu • N = 2 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 16v^2)\nM = r_uv • N = 0\nN = r_vv • N = -4 / sqrt(1 + 4u^2 + 16v^2)\n\nAt the point (1, -1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = -1. So we can compute the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms at this point:\nE = 5, F = 0, G = 17\nL = 2 / sqrt(21), M = 0, N = -4 / sqrt(21)\n\nNow, we can compute the principal curvatures k1 and k2 using the following formula:\n\nk1, k2 = (LG - M^2) / (EG - F^2) ± sqrt(((LG - M^2) / (EG - F^2))^2 - (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2))\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nk1, k2 = (10 / 85) ± sqrt(((10 / 85)^2 - (8 / 85)))\n\nk1, k2 = 1/17 ± sqrt(1/289)\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1, -1, 2) are:\n\nk1 = 1/17 + sqrt(1/289) ≈ 0.0706\nk2 = 1/17 - sqrt(1/289) ≈ 0.0182"
