    "message_1": "Assuming that in a community of 500 people, 300 people like to attend social events. What is the probability that at least 150 of those people will attend an upcoming event?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 150 of the 300 people who like to attend social events will attend an upcoming event, we can use the binomial probability formula. However, calculating the probability for each case (150, 151, 152, ..., 300) can be quite tedious. Instead, we can find the probability that fewer than 150 people attend and subtract it from 1 to find the probability that at least 150 people attend.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, people attending the event)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the 300 people who like to attend social events)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of people attending the event)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability that a person will attend the event)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability that a person will not attend the event)\n\nWe don't have enough information to determine the exact probability (p) that a person will attend the event. However, we can make some assumptions or gather more data to estimate the probability. For example, we could look at the attendance rates of previous events or survey the community members to get an idea of their likelihood of attending the event.\n\nOnce we have an estimate for p, we can use the binomial probability formula to find the probability that fewer than 150 people attend the event:\n\nP(X < 150) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 149)\n\nFinally, we can subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that at least 150 people attend the event:\n\nP(X â‰¥ 150) = 1 - P(X < 150)"
