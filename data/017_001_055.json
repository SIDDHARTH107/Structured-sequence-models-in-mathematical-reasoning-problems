    "message_2": "Suppose for the sake of contradiction that both a and b have order 2. That is, a^2 = e and b^2 = e, where e is the identity element of G. Since G has order 4, there are only 4 elements in G: e, a, b, and some other element, say c.\n\nNow, consider the product ab. We know that (ab)^2 = abab. Since a^2 = e, we have abab = aeb = ab. Since a is not equal to the identity element, we can multiply both sides by a^(-1) on the left to get b = a^(-1)bab. Now, we know that b^2 = e, so bb = e. Thus, we have a^(-1)bab = a^(-1)bae = a^(-1)ba. Multiplying both sides by a on the right, we get a^(-1)ba^2 = a^(-1)ba, which simplifies to a^(-1)b = a^(-1)ba.\n\nNow, multiply both sides by a on the right again to get a^(-1)ba = a^(-1)baa. Since a^2 = e, we have a^(-1)ba = a^(-1)be = a^(-1)b. Since a is not equal to the identity element, a^(-1) is also not equal to the identity element, so we can multiply both sides by a^(-1)^(-1) on the left to get b = a.\n\nBut this is a contradiction, since we assumed that a and b are distinct elements of G. Therefore, our assumption that both a and b have order 2 must be false. Thus, a and b cannot both have order 2."
