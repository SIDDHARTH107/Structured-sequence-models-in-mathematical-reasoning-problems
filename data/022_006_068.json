    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum moduli of f(z) over the closed disk {|z| ≤ 2}, we will first rewrite f(z) in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let z = x + iy, where x and y are real numbers. Then,\n\nf(z) = (x + iy)^2 + 2(x + iy) + 1\n     = (x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 1) + i(2xy + 2y)\n\nNow, let u(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 + 2x + 1 and v(x, y) = 2xy + 2y be the real and imaginary parts of f(z), respectively. The modulus of f(z) is given by:\n\n|f(z)| = √(u^2 + v^2)\n\nWe want to find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)| over the closed disk {|z| ≤ 2}, which corresponds to the region where x^2 + y^2 ≤ 4.\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)|, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We want to maximize and minimize the function g(x, y) = u^2 + v^2 subject to the constraint x^2 + y^2 ≤ 4.\n\nThe gradient of g(x, y) is given by:\n\n∇g(x, y) = (4x^3 + 12x^2 - 4y^2 + 8, 8xy + 8y)\n\nThe gradient of the constraint function h(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 4 is:\n\n∇h(x, y) = (2x, 2y)\n\nNow, we set ∇g(x, y) = λ∇h(x, y) for some constant λ:\n\n(4x^3 + 12x^2 - 4y^2 + 8, 8xy + 8y) = λ(2x, 2y)\n\nThis gives us the following system of equations:\n\n4x^3 + 12x^2 - 4y^2 + 8 = 2λx\n8xy + 8y = 2λy\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\n1. y ≠ 0: In this case, we can divide the second equation by 2y to get:\n\n4x + 4 = λ\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n4x^3 + 12x^2 - 4y^2 + 8 = 2x(4x + 4)\n4x^3 + 12x^2 - 4y^2 + 8 = 8x^2 + 8x\n4x^3 + 4x^2 - 4y^2 = 0\nx^2(4x + 4 - 4y^2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possibilities:\n\na. x = 0: In this case, the constraint equation becomes y^2 = 4, so y = ±2. The points (0, 2) and (0, -2) are on the boundary of the disk.\n\nb. 4x + 4 - 4y^2 = 0: In this case, we have:\n\n4x = 4y^2 - 4\nx = y^2 - 1\n\nSubstituting this into the constraint equation, we get:\n\n(y^2 - 1)^2 + y^2 = 4\ny^4 - 2y^2 + 1 + y^2 = 4\ny^4 - y^2 - 3 = 0\n\nThis quartic equation does not have any real solutions for y, so there are no points on the boundary of the disk that satisfy this condition.\n\n2. y = 0: In this case, the constraint equation becomes x^2 = 4, so x = ±2. The points (2, 0) and (-2, 0) are on the boundary of the disk.\n\nNow, we evaluate |f(z)| at the points (0, 2), (0, -2), (2, 0), and (-2, 0):\n\n|f(0, 2)| = √((0^2 - 2^2 + 2*0 + 1)^2 + (2*0*2 + 2*2)^2) = √(9^2 + 4^2) = √97\n|f(0, -2)| = √((0^2 - (-2)^2 + 2*0 + 1)^2 + (2*0*(-2) + 2*(-2))^2) = √(9^2 + 4^2) = √97\n|f(2, 0)| = √(((2^2 - 0^2 + 2*2 + 1)^2 + (2*2*0 + 2*0)^2) = √(49^2 + 0^2) = 49\n|f(-2, 0)| = √(((-2)^2 - 0^2 + 2*(-2) + 1)^2 + (2*(-2)*0 + 2*0)^2) = √(1^2 + 0^2) = 1\n\nThus, the maximum modulus of f(z) over the closed disk {|z| ≤ 2} is 49, and the minimum modulus is 1."
