    "message_2": "To determine if G contains an Eulerian path, we need to check the degrees of the vertices. A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it is connected and has exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree.\n\nSince we don't have the specific graph, we can only analyze the possibilities. With 8 vertices and 12 edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 12 = 24. Since the sum of degrees is even, there must be an even number of vertices with odd degrees.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. All vertices have even degrees: In this case, G has an Eulerian circuit (which is also an Eulerian path). However, without the specific graph, we cannot find the sequence of edges.\n\n2. Two vertices have odd degrees, and the rest have even degrees: In this case, G has an Eulerian path. However, without the specific graph, we cannot find the sequence of edges.\n\n3. Four or more vertices have odd degrees: In this case, G does not have an Eulerian path.\n\nNow, let's consider the Hamiltonian path. A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. Unfortunately, without the specific graph, we cannot determine if G has a Hamiltonian path or not, as it depends on the arrangement of the edges."
