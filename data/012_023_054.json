    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of vertices in a fully connected subgraph (also known as the clique number), we need to identify the largest complete subgraph in the given graph. A complete subgraph is a subgraph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph:\n\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nEdges: {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)}\n\nWe can start by looking for triangles (3-cliques) in the graph:\n\n1. Triangle with vertices {1, 2, 3} and edges {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)}\n2. Triangle with vertices {2, 4, 5} and edges {(2,4), (4,5), (3,5)}\n3. Triangle with vertices {4, 5, 6} and edges {(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)}\n\nThere are no larger complete subgraphs (4-cliques, 5-cliques, or 6-cliques) in the given graph.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of vertices in a fully connected subgraph (the clique number) of this graph is 3."
