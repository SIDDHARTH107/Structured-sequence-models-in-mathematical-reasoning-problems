    "message_2": "To find the height of the tree, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle is 45 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the tree (which we want to find), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the base of the tree, which is 20 feet.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(45) = height / 20\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = height / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 20 * 1\n\nheight = 20 feet\n\nSo, the height of the tree is approximately 20 feet."
