    "message_1": "The temperature of a rod of length 10 cm varies along its length and time according to the heat transfer equation: \n\n∂u/∂t = 5 ∂²u/∂x² \n\nwhere u(x,t) is the temperature in Celsius at position x and time t. The rod is initially at a uniform temperature of 20°C and is held at 10°C at both ends. Find the temperature distribution along the rod after 2 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting this into the heat transfer equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = 5X''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5X(x)T(t):\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\nX''(x) / X(x) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1) T'(t) = -λT(t)\n2) X''(x) = -λX(x)\n\nSolving the second equation, we get the general solution:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(√λx) + B*sin(√λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, u(0, t) = 10°C and u(10, t) = 10°C:\n\nX(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) => A = 10\nX(10) = 10*cos(√λ*10) + B*sin(√λ*10) => B*sin(√λ*10) = 0\n\nSince B cannot be zero (otherwise, the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(√λ*10) = 0. Therefore, √λ*10 = nπ, where n is an integer. So, λ = (nπ/10)^2.\n\nNow, we have the eigenfunctions:\n\nX_n(x) = 10*cos(nπx/10)\n\nSolving the first equation, we get the general solution:\n\nT(t) = C*exp(-λt)\n\nNow, we have the eigenfunctions:\n\nu_n(x, t) = 10*cos(nπx/10) * exp(-(nπ/10)^2 * 5t)\n\nTo find the initial condition, we use the Fourier series:\n\nu(x, 0) = 20 = Σ [a_n * cos(nπx/10)]\n\nSince the initial condition is an even function, all the sine terms will be zero. The coefficients a_n can be found using the orthogonality property:\n\na_n = (2/L) * ∫[u(x, 0) * cos(nπx/10)]dx from 0 to 10\n\na_0 = (2/10) * ∫[20]dx from 0 to 10 = 20\na_n = (2/10) * ∫[20 * cos(nπx/10)]dx from 0 to 10 = (20/nπ) * [sin(nπ) - sin(0)] = 0\n\nSo, the initial condition is u(x, 0) = 20. Therefore, the temperature distribution along the rod after 2 seconds is:\n\nu(x, t) = 20\n\nThe temperature distribution remains constant along the rod at 20°C after 2 seconds."
