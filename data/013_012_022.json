    "message_1": "Suppose there are two firms in the market, firm A and firm B, that produce identical products. Firm B is the follower and must select its quantity to maximize profit given the quantity chosen by firm A, the leader. The demand function is given by Q = 10 - P, where Q is the total quantity demanded and P is the price. The cost function for each firm is C = 2Q, where C is the total cost.\n\nIf firm A chooses to produce 4 units of output, what quantity should firm B produce to maximize its profit in a Stackelberg competition?",
    "message_2": "To find the quantity firm B should produce to maximize its profit, we first need to find the residual demand function for firm B. Since firm A produces 4 units, the residual demand for firm B is the total demand minus firm A's production:\n\nQ_B = (10 - P) - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the price as a function of Q_B. To do this, we can rewrite the demand function as:\n\nP = 10 - (Q_A + Q_B)\n\nSince firm A produces 4 units, we have:\n\nP = 10 - (4 + Q_B)\n\nNext, we need to find the revenue function for firm B. Revenue is the product of price and quantity:\n\nR_B = P * Q_B = (10 - (4 + Q_B)) * Q_B = (6 - Q_B) * Q_B = 6Q_B - Q_B^2\n\nNow, we need to find the profit function for firm B. Profit is the difference between revenue and cost:\n\nΠ_B = R_B - C_B = (6Q_B - Q_B^2) - 2Q_B = 4Q_B - Q_B^2\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the first-order condition by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to Q_B and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndΠ_B/dQ_B = 4 - 2Q_B = 0\n\nSolving for Q_B, we get:\n\nQ_B = 2\n\nSo, firm B should produce 2 units of output to maximize its profit in a Stackelberg competition when firm A produces 4 units."
