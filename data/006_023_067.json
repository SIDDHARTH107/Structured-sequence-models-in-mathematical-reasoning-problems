    "message_2": "To find the probability that a customer buys both products, we need to know if the events of buying the first product and buying the second product are independent or not. If they are independent, we can simply multiply the probabilities. If they are not independent, we need more information to calculate the probability.\n\nAssuming the events are independent, the probability that a customer buys both products is:\n\nP(both products) = P(product 1) * P(product 2) = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24\n\nSo, the probability that the customer buys both products is 0.24 or 24%."
