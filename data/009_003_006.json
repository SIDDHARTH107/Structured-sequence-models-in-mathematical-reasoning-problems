The plate is 5 mm thick and has a thermal diffusivity of 0.001 m^2/s. Find the temperature of the plate at a depth of 2 mm after 10 minutes from the start of the cooling process.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature of the plate at a depth of 2 mm after 10 minutes from the start of the cooling process, we can use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation for a semi-infinite solid, which is given by:\n\nT(x, t) = T_initial + (T_surface - T_initial) * erf(x / (2 * sqrt(α * t)))\n\nwhere T(x, t) is the temperature at depth x and time t, T_initial is the initial temperature of the plate, T_surface is the temperature of the water bath, erf is the error function, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x and t are the depth and time, respectively.\n\nGiven:\nT_initial = 100°C\nT_surface = 50°C\nα = 0.001 m^2/s\nx = 2 mm = 0.002 m\nt = 10 minutes = 600 s\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nT(0.002, 600) = 100 + (50 - 100) * erf(0.002 / (2 * sqrt(0.001 * 600)))\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value inside the error function:\n\n0.002 / (2 * sqrt(0.001 * 600)) = 0.002 / (2 * sqrt(0.6)) ≈ 0.002 / 1.095 ≈ 0.001826\n\nNow, we can find the value of the error function:\n\nerf(0.001826) ≈ 0.002\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nT(0.002, 600) = 100 + (50 - 100) * 0.002 = 100 - 50 * 0.002 = 100 - 0.1 = 99.9°C\n\nSo, the temperature of the plate at a depth of 2 mm after 10 minutes from the start of the cooling process is approximately 99.9°C."
