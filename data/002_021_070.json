    "message_1": "A pizza place sells large pizzas with a diameter of 20 inches. If you were to cut out a sector from one of these pizzas with a central angle of 60 degrees, what would be the area of that sector in square inches?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r²\n\nwhere the central angle is given in degrees, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius of the pizza. Since the diameter is 20 inches, the radius is half of that, which is 10 inches.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) × π × 10²\n\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 100\n\nArea of sector = (100π)/6\n\nArea of sector ≈ 52.36 square inches\n\nSo, the area of the sector with a central angle of 60 degrees is approximately 52.36 square inches."
