    "message_1": "In the game of Chicken, Player A and Player B drive their cars towards each other. The first player to swerve loses the game, but if neither player swerves, they both crash and lose. In a particular game, Player A has a 70% chance of swerving and Player B has a 60% chance of swerving. What is the probability that neither player swerves and they both crash?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that neither player swerves and they both crash, we need to find the probability that both Player A and Player B do not swerve. \n\nThe probability that Player A does not swerve is 1 - 0.70 = 0.30 (30%).\nThe probability that Player B does not swerve is 1 - 0.60 = 0.40 (40%).\n\nTo find the probability that both events occur, we multiply the probabilities:\n\n0.30 * 0.40 = 0.12 (12%).\n\nSo, there is a 12% chance that neither player swerves and they both crash."
