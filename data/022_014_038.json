    "message_2": "To find the complex function f(z), we need to find a function F(z) such that f(z) is the derivative of F(z) with respect to z. In other words, we need to find an analytic function F(z) = U(x, y) + iV(x, y) such that:\n\n∂U/∂x = ∂V/∂y and ∂U/∂y = -∂V/∂x\n\nGiven u(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 and v(x, y) = 2xy, we can rewrite the Cauchy-Riemann equations as:\n\n∂U/∂x = 2x = ∂V/∂y\n∂U/∂y = -2y = -∂V/∂x\n\nNow, we need to find the functions U(x, y) and V(x, y) that satisfy these equations.\n\nIntegrating the first equation with respect to x, we get:\n\nU(x, y) = x^2 + g(y)\n\nNow, we differentiate U(x, y) with respect to y:\n\n∂U/∂y = g'(y)\n\nSince ∂U/∂y = -2y, we have:\n\ng'(y) = -2y\n\nIntegrating g'(y) with respect to y, we get:\n\ng(y) = -y^2 + C\n\nNow, we have U(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 + C, where C is a constant. Since u(x, y) = x^2 - y^2, we can conclude that C = 0. Thus, U(x, y) = x^2 - y^2.\n\nNow, we need to find V(x, y). We know that ∂V/∂x = -2y. Integrating this with respect to x, we get:\n\nV(x, y) = -2xy + h(y)\n\nNow, we differentiate V(x, y) with respect to y:\n\n∂V/∂y = -2x + h'(y)\n\nSince ∂V/∂y = 2x, we have:\n\nh'(y) = 2x\n\nHowever, since h'(y) should not depend on x, this implies that h(y) must be a constant. Let's call this constant D. Thus, V(x, y) = 2xy + D. Since v(x, y) = 2xy, we can conclude that D = 0. Thus, V(x, y) = 2xy.\n\nFinally, we have found the analytic function F(z) = U(x, y) + iV(x, y) = (x^2 - y^2) + i(2xy). Therefore, the complex function f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) = (x^2 - y^2) + i(2xy)."
