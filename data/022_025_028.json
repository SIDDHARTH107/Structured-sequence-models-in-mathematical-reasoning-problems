    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a one-dimensional infinite square well potential, we first need to set up the equation. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional potential V(x) is given by:\n\n(-ħ²/2m) * (d²ψ(x)/dx²) + V(x) * ψ(x) = E * ψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, ψ(x) is the wave function of the particle, and E is the energy eigenvalue.\n\nFor an infinite square well potential, V(x) = 0 inside the well (0 < x < L) and V(x) = ∞ outside the well. In our case, the width of the well L = 1 nm. Since the potential is infinite outside the well, the wave function must be zero outside the well. Inside the well, the Schrödinger equation simplifies to:\n\n(-ħ²/2m) * (d²ψ(x)/dx²) = E * ψ(x)\n\nNow, let's convert the energy eigenvalue E from electron volts (eV) to joules (J):\n\nE = 500 eV * (1.60218 × 10⁻¹⁹ J/eV) ≈ 8.0109 × 10⁻¹⁷ J\n\nNext, let's assume the particle is an electron, so its mass m = 9.109 × 10⁻³¹ kg, and ħ = 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s. Plugging these values into the Schrödinger equation, we get:\n\n(-1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s²/2 * 9.109 × 10⁻³¹ kg) * (d²ψ(x)/dx²) = (8.0109 × 10⁻¹⁷ J) * ψ(x)\n\nSolving this second-order differential equation, we find that the wave function inside the well is given by:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, and k = sqrt(2mE/ħ²). Since ψ(0) = 0 (due to the infinite potential at x = 0), we have:\n\n0 = A * sin(0) + B * cos(0) => B = 0\n\nThus, the wave function inside the well is:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx)\n\nNow, we need to find the constant A and the value of k. To do this, we use the boundary condition ψ(L) = 0:\n\n0 = A * sin(kL)\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise, the wave function would be trivially zero everywhere), we must have:\n\nsin(kL) = 0\n\nThis implies that kL = nπ, where n is an integer. Therefore, k = nπ/L. In our case, L = 1 nm, so:\n\nk = nπ nm⁻¹\n\nNow, we can normalize the wave function by requiring that the integral of |ψ(x)|² over the well is equal to 1:\n\n∫₀ᴸ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nPlugging in our expression for ψ(x), we get:\n\n∫₀ᴸ (A * sin(kx))² dx = 1\n\nSolving this integral and using the value of k, we find that:\n\nA = sqrt(2/L)\n\nFinally, the normalized wave function for the quantum particle in the one-dimensional infinite square well potential with width 1 nm and energy eigenvalue E = 500 eV is:\n\nψ(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(nπx/L)\n\nwhere n is an integer, and the corresponding energy eigenvalues are given by:\n\nE_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²)"
