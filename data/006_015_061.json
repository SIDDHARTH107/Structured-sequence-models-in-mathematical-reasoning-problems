What is the probability that at least one cyber attack will occur on the network in a given week?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one cyber attack occurring, we can first find the probability of no cyber attacks occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet A be the event of a phishing attack, B be the event of a malware attack, and C be the event of a DoS attack.\n\nThe probability of no phishing attack (A') is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.\nThe probability of no malware attack (B') is 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.\nThe probability of no DoS attack (C') is 1 - P(C) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nAssuming the events are independent, the probability of no cyber attacks occurring (A' ∩ B' ∩ C') is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\nP(A' ∩ B' ∩ C') = P(A') * P(B') * P(C') = 0.85 * 0.90 * 0.95 = 0.72525.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one cyber attack occurring by subtracting the probability of no cyber attacks from 1:\n\nP(At least one cyber attack) = 1 - P(No cyber attacks) = 1 - 0.72525 = 0.27475.\n\nSo, the probability of at least one cyber attack occurring in a given week is approximately 0.27475 or 27.475%."
