    "message_1": "A high school has 500 students, out of which 300 are boys and 200 are girls. The probability of a boy graduating with honors is 0.6, whereas the probability of a girl graduating with honors is 0.4. What is the probability that a student chosen at random from the school will be a girl who does not graduate with honors?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a student chosen at random will be a girl who does not graduate with honors, we need to first find the probability of a girl not graduating with honors. \n\nSince the probability of a girl graduating with honors is 0.4, the probability of a girl not graduating with honors is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of choosing a girl from the school. There are 200 girls out of 500 students, so the probability of choosing a girl is 200/500 = 2/5 = 0.4.\n\nFinally, we multiply the probability of choosing a girl by the probability of a girl not graduating with honors: 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24.\n\nSo, the probability that a student chosen at random from the school will be a girl who does not graduate with honors is 0.24 or 24%."
