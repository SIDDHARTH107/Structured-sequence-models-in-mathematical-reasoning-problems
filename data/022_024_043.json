Also, consider the initial and boundary conditions:\n\nu(z,0) = 0  for 0≤|z|≤1/2, u(z,0) =1  for 1/2<|z|<1,\nu(e^(iθ),t) = 0  for 0≤θ≤π, u(e^(iθ),t) = sin(t(1-e^(iθ))) for π≤θ≤2π.\n\nFind the solution u(z,t) of the heat equation subject to the given conditions, for t>0, given that k=1.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation with the given conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let u(z, t) = R(r)Θ(θ)T(t), where z = re^(iθ) and r = |z|. Then, the heat equation becomes:\n\nR''(r)Θ(θ)T(t) + (1/r)R'(r)Θ(θ)T(t) + (1/r^2)R(r)Θ''(θ)T(t) = T'(t)R(r)Θ(θ) + sin(t(z-1)).\n\nDivide both sides by R(r)Θ(θ)T(t):\n\n(R''(r)/R(r) + (1/r)R'(r)/R(r) + (1/r^2)Θ''(θ)/Θ(θ)) = T'(t)/T(t) + sin(t(z-1))/(R(r)Θ(θ)T(t)).\n\nSince the left side depends only on r and θ, and the right side depends only on t, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ. Now we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. T'(t) = -λT(t) + sin(t(z-1)),\n2. R''(r) + (1/r)R'(r) + (1/r^2)Θ''(θ) = -λR(r).\n\nFor equation (1), we can solve it using an integrating factor. Let I(t) = e^(λt), then:\n\nT'(t)e^(λt) + λT(t)e^(λt) = sin(t(z-1))e^(λt).\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫(T'(t)e^(λt) + λT(t)e^(λt)) dt = ∫sin(t(z-1))e^(λt) dt + C₁.\n\nNow, we can solve equation (2) by separation of variables. Let R(r)Θ(θ) = -λR(r), then:\n\nΘ''(θ)/Θ(θ) = -r^2(R''(r) + (1/r)R'(r))/R(r) - λr^2.\n\nSince the left side depends only on θ and the right side depends only on r, both sides must be equal to a constant, say μ. Now we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n3. Θ''(θ) = μΘ(θ),\n4. R''(r) + (1/r)R'(r) = (λ - μr^2)R(r).\n\nFor equation (3), we can solve it using the boundary conditions:\n\nΘ(0) = 0, Θ(π) = 0.\n\nThe general solution of equation (3) is:\n\nΘ(θ) = A*cos(√μθ) + B*sin(√μθ).\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nΘ(0) = A = 0, Θ(π) = B*sin(√μπ) = 0.\n\nSince B ≠ 0, we have sin(√μπ) = 0, which implies that μ = n^2, where n is an integer. Thus, the solution of equation (3) is:\n\nΘ(θ) = B_n*sin(nθ), where n is an integer.\n\nFor equation (4), we can solve it using the initial conditions:\n\nR(0) = 0, R(1/2) = 0, R(1) = 1.\n\nThe general solution of equation (4) is:\n\nR(r) = C_n*r^(n+1) + D_n*r^(1-n).\n\nApplying the initial conditions, we get:\n\nR(0) = 0, R(1/2) = C_n*(1/2)^(n+1) + D_n*(1/2)^(1-n) = 0, R(1) = C_n + D_n = 1.\n\nSolving the system of equations, we obtain:\n\nC_n = 1/(2^n - 2^(1-n)), D_n = -1/(2^n - 2^(1-n)).\n\nThus, the solution of equation (4) is:\n\nR(r) = (1/(2^n - 2^(1-n)))*r^(n+1) - (1/(2^n - 2^(1-n)))*r^(1-n).\n\nFinally, the solution u(z, t) of the heat equation is given by:\n\nu(z, t) = ∑[B_n*sin(nθ)*((1/(2^n - 2^(1-n)))*r^(n+1) - (1/(2^n - 2^(1-n)))*r^(1-n))*e^(-λt)],\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all integers n, and B_n, λ, and μ are determined by the boundary and initial conditions."
