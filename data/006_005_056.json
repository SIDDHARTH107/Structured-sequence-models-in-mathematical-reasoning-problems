    "message_1": "A department store has recorded that the average number of customers entering the store is 20 per hour. What is the probability that exactly 30 customers will enter the store in a given hour?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson probability formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, customers entering the store) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nThe formula for the Poisson probability is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing exactly k events (customers) in the given interval (1 hour)\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of events (customers) in the interval (20 customers per hour)\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for (30 customers)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nIn this case, λ = 20 and k = 30. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(X = 30) = (e^(-20) * 20^30) / 30!\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\n1. Calculate e^(-20): \ne^(-20) ≈ 2.06115362243856 × 10^(-9)\n\n2. Calculate 20^30:\n20^30 ≈ 1.099511627776 × 10^26\n\n3. Calculate 30! (30 factorial):\n30! = 30 × 29 × 28 × ... × 2 × 1 = 2.65252859812191 × 10^32\n\n4. Plug these values back into the formula:\nP(X = 30) = (2.06115362243856 × 10^(-9) * 1.099511627776 × 10^26) / 2.65252859812191 × 10^32\n\n5. Calculate the probability:\nP(X = 30) ≈ 8.58230733128578 × 10^(-7)\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 30 customers will enter the store in a given hour is approximately 8.582 × 10^(-7) or 0.0000008582."
