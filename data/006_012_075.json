    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, thefts) in n trials (households)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of a single success (theft)\n- n is the number of trials (households)\n- k is the number of successes (thefts)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 20 (households)\n- k = 3 (thefts)\n- p = 0.15 (probability of a theft)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(20, 3):\n\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!(20-3)!)\nC(20, 3) = 20! / (3!17!)\nC(20, 3) = (20 * 19 * 18 * 17!)/(3 * 2 * 1 * 17!)\nC(20, 3) = (20 * 19 * 18)/(3 * 2 * 1)\nC(20, 3) = 1140\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability using the binomial formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(20, 3) * 0.15^3 * (1-0.15)^(20-3)\nP(X = 3) = 1140 * 0.15^3 * 0.85^17\nP(X = 3) â‰ˆ 0.2429\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 3 out of 20 randomly selected households in this neighborhood will experience a theft is approximately 0.2429 or 24.29%."
