    "message_1": "Suppose you intercept a ciphertext message that was encrypted using Playfair cipher with a key \"MATHS\". The message is: \"OYEYGLVYGQGNYHNZRSVJ\".\nUsing cryptanalysis technique, find the plaintext of the message.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using the Playfair cipher, we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair square using the key \"MATHS\". The square is filled with the remaining letters of the alphabet in order, excluding J (since I and J are treated as the same letter in the Playfair cipher).\n\nThe Playfair square with the key \"MATHS\" looks like this:\n\nM A T H S\nB C D E F\nG I K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we will decrypt the ciphertext \"OYEYGLVYGQGNYHNZRSVJ\" using the Playfair square:\n\n1. Break the ciphertext into digraphs: OY EY GL VY GQ GN YH NZ RS VJ\n2. For each digraph, apply the decryption rules of the Playfair cipher:\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its left (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one above it (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its row but in the column of the other letter.\n\nDecrypting the digraphs:\n\nOY -> PL\nEY -> AY\nGL -> AI\nVY -> RF\nGQ -> AI\nGN -> R_\nYH -> ME\nNZ -> NT\nRS -> IC\nVJ -> ES\n\nThe decrypted digraphs are: PL AY FA IR AI R_ ME NT IC ES\n\nCombine the digraphs to get the plaintext: \"PLAYFAIRAIRMENTICES\"\n\nSince the Playfair cipher sometimes adds an extra letter (usually 'X') to make digraphs, the actual plaintext might be slightly different. However, based on the decrypted text, it appears that the plaintext message is: \"PLAYFAIRAIMENTICES\"."
