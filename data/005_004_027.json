To compare the mean lifespan of the batteries, a sample of 20 batteries is taken from each type, and the lifespan in hours is recorded for each. Conduct an ANOVA to determine if there is a significant difference between the mean lifespan of the four types of batteries at a significance level of 0.05. \n\nThe data is as follows:\n\nType 1: 98, 104, 100, 102, 96, 104, 100, 98, 102, 96, 102, 104, 100, 98, 102, 96, 100, 98, 104, 102\n\nType 2: 102, 104, 108, 106, 108, 104, 102, 106, 108, 102, 106, 104, 108, 106, 102, 104, 108, 106, 102, 104\n\nType 3: 96, 100, 98, 100, 96, 98, 100, 96, 98, 100, 96, 98, 100, 96, 98, 100, 96, 98, 100, 96\n\nType 4: 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 92, 94, 96, 98",
    "message_2": "To conduct an ANOVA test, we first need to calculate the means and variances for each type of battery, as well as the overall mean.\n\nType 1 mean (M1) = (98+104+100+102+96+104+100+98+102+96+102+104+100+98+102+96+100+98+104+102)/20 = 100.4\nType 2 mean (M2) = (102+104+108+106+108+104+102+106+108+102+106+104+108+106+102+104+108+106+102+104)/20 = 105.2\nType 3 mean (M3) = (96+100+98+100+96+98+100+96+98+100+96+98+100+96+98+100+96+98+100+96)/20 = 98\nType 4 mean (M4) = (90+92+94+96+98+100+92+94+96+98+100+92+94+96+98+100+92+94+96+98)/20 = 96\n\nOverall mean (M) = (100.4+105.2+98+96)/4 = 99.9\n\nNow, we calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB), sum of squares within groups (SSW), and the total sum of squares (SST).\n\nSSB = Σn_i(M_i - M)^2 = 20(100.4-99.9)^2 + 20(105.2-99.9)^2 + 20(98-99.9)^2 + 20(96-99.9)^2 = 20(0.5^2 + 5.3^2 + (-1.9)^2 + (-3.9)^2) = 20(0.25 + 28.09 + 3.61 + 15.21) = 20(47.16) = 943.2\n\nSSW = ΣΣ(x_ij - M_i)^2, where x_ij is the j-th observation in the i-th group. We can calculate the SSW for each group and then sum them up:\n\nSSW1 = Σ(x_ij - M1)^2 for Type 1 = 2(1.6^2) + 4(0.4^2) + 2(2.4^2) + 4(4.4^2) = 2(2.56) + 4(0.16) + 2(5.76) + 4(19.36) = 5.12 + 0.64 + 11.52 + 77.44 = 94.72\nSSW2 = Σ(x_ij - M2)^2 for Type 2 = 10(1.2^2) + 6(2.2^2) + 4(3.2^2) = 10(1.44) + 6(4.84) + 4(10.24) = 14.4 + 29.04 + 40.96 = 84.4\nSSW3 = Σ(x_ij - M3)^2 for Type 3 = 10(2^2) + 10(0^2) = 10(4) + 0 = 40\nSSW4 = Σ(x_ij - M4)^2 for Type 4 = 6(2^2) + 6(4^2) + 2(6^2) + 6(0^2) = 6(4) + 6(16) + 2(36) + 0 = 24 + 96 + 72 = 192\n\nSSW = SSW1 + SSW2 + SSW3 + SSW4 = 94.72 + 84.4 + 40 + 192 = 411.12\n\nSST = SSB + SSW = 943.2 + 411.12 = 1354.32\n\nNow, we calculate the mean squares between groups (MSB), mean squares within groups (MSW), and the F-statistic.\n\nMSB = SSB/(k-1) = 943.2/(4-1) = 943.2/3 = 314.4, where k is the number of groups (4 in this case)\nMSW = SSW/(N-k) = 411.12/(80-4) = 411.12/76 = 5.41, where N is the total number of observations (80 in this case)\n\nF-statistic = MSB/MSW = 314.4/5.41 = 58.1\n\nNow, we compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table with (k-1) and (N-k) degrees of freedom at a significance level of 0.05. In this case, the critical value is F(3,76) = 2.76.\n\nSince the F-statistic (58.1) is greater than the critical value (2.76), we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the mean lifespan of the four types of batteries. Therefore, there is a significant difference between the mean lifespan of the four types of batteries at a significance level of 0.05."
