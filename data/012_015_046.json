    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is connected or not, we can use the fact that a graph with n vertices is connected if it has at least (n-1) edges and the edges are distributed in such a way that there is a path between every pair of vertices.\n\nIn this case, G has 10 vertices, so it needs at least (10-1) = 9 edges to be connected. Since G has 15 edges, which is more than the minimum required, it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, we cannot definitively say that the graph is connected without knowing the distribution of the edges. There could be a situation where the edges are not distributed in a way that connects all the vertices.\n\nIn conclusion, it is possible for the graph G to be connected, but we cannot definitively say it is connected without more information about the distribution of the edges."
