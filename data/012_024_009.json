    "message_2": "To determine the smallest possible genus of a graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs and its generalization for graphs embedded on surfaces of higher genus.\n\nEuler's formula for planar graphs states that for a connected graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nThe generalization of Euler's formula for graphs embedded on surfaces of genus g is:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nWe are given a graph with 10 vertices (V = 10) and 15 edges (E = 15). We want to find the smallest possible genus g for this graph.\n\nFirst, let's check if the graph can be planar (g = 0). If the graph is planar, then:\n\n10 - 15 + F = 2\n\nF = 7\n\nHowever, for a planar graph, the number of edges must satisfy the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n\n15 ≤ 24\n\nSince this inequality holds, it is possible that the graph is planar. However, we need to check if there exists a planar graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges. One such example is the complete bipartite graph K(5,5), which has 10 vertices and 15 edges and is planar. Therefore, the smallest possible genus of the given graph is 0."
