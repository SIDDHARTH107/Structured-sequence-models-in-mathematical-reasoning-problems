    "message_2": "The logistic map equation Xn+1 = r*Xn*(1 - Xn) undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation and transitions from stable periodic behavior to chaotic behavior when the value of r is approximately 3.57. This value is known as the onset of chaos, and it marks the beginning of the chaotic regime in the logistic map."
