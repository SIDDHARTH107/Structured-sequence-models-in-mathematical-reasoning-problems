    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed, we can use the concept of graph coloring and the chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph with 6 vertices, and each vertex is connected to at least 3 other vertices. This means that the graph is not bipartite, as a bipartite graph would have each vertex connected to at most half of the other vertices.\n\nSince the graph is not bipartite, we know that the chromatic number is greater than 2. Now, we need to determine if it is possible to color the graph with 3 colors. We can try to construct a graph with the given conditions and attempt to color it with 3 colors.\n\nConsider a graph with vertices A, B, C, D, E, and F. We can connect A to B, C, and D; B to A, C, and E; C to A, B, and F; D to A, E, and F; E to B, D, and F; and F to C, D, and E. This graph satisfies the condition that each vertex is connected to at least 3 other vertices.\n\nNow, let's try to color the graph with 3 colors: red, blue, and green.\n\n1. Color vertex A with red.\n2. Color vertex B with blue (since it's connected to A).\n3. Color vertex C with green (since it's connected to A and B).\n4. Color vertex D with blue (since it's connected to A and C).\n5. Color vertex E with red (since it's connected to B and D).\n6. Color vertex F with green (since it's connected to C and D).\n\nWe have successfully colored the graph with 3 colors, so the minimum number of colors needed is 3."
