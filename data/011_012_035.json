    "message_1": "Suppose we have a set of integers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. How many integer combinations of three numbers can be made such that at least one of the numbers is odd?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary counting principle. Instead of directly counting the combinations with at least one odd number, we will count the combinations with no odd numbers (i.e., all even numbers) and subtract that from the total number of combinations.\n\nThere are 3 even numbers in the set: {2, 4, 6}. The number of ways to choose 3 numbers from this set is C(3,3), which is 1. This represents the combination {2, 4, 6}.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways to choose 3 numbers from the original set of 7 integers. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of elements and k is the number of elements to choose.\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) = 7! / (3!4!) = (7 × 6 × 5) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 35\n\nNow, we subtract the number of combinations with no odd numbers from the total number of combinations:\n\n35 - 1 = 34\n\nSo, there are 34 integer combinations of three numbers such that at least one of the numbers is odd."
