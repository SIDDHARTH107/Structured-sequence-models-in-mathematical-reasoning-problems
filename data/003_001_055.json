    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In other words, a^2 + b^2 = c^2.\n\nIn this case, we are given the length of the hypotenuse (c = 10) and the length of one of the other sides (a = 6). We need to find the length of the opposite side (b).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can set up the equation:\n\n6^2 + b^2 = 10^2\n\n36 + b^2 = 100\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 100 - 36\nb^2 = 64\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nb = âˆš64\nb = 8\n\nSo, the length of the opposite side is 8."
