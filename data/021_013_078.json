    "message_1": "Consider the following optimization problem: \n\nMinimize the function f(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 4x^2 + 2x - 5, over the interval [-1, 2], using the simulated annealing method. \n\nWhat is the minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding value of x that minimizes the function? Use a cooling schedule with a starting temperature of 500, cooling rate of 0.95, and a stopping temperature of 0.01. Use a step size of 0.1 for the random walk in each iteration.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using the simulated annealing method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the temperature T to the starting temperature (500).\n2. Choose an initial value for x randomly from the interval [-1, 2].\n3. Calculate the function value f(x) for the initial x.\n4. Repeat the following steps until the temperature T is less than the stopping temperature (0.01):\n   a. Generate a new candidate solution x_new by adding a random value between -0.1 and 0.1 to the current x.\n   b. If x_new is outside the interval [-1, 2], discard it and generate a new candidate solution.\n   c. Calculate the function value f(x_new) for the new candidate solution.\n   d. Calculate the change in function value Δf = f(x_new) - f(x).\n   e. If Δf < 0, accept the new candidate solution (i.e., set x = x_new).\n   f. If Δf >= 0, accept the new candidate solution with probability exp(-Δf / T).\n   g. Update the temperature T by multiplying it with the cooling rate (0.95).\n\nAfter the algorithm stops, the current value of x will be the approximate solution that minimizes the function f(x). The minimum value of f(x) can be calculated by plugging this x value into the function.\n\nPlease note that the simulated annealing method is a heuristic algorithm, and the solution may not be the exact global minimum. The result may vary depending on the random walk and the cooling schedule parameters."
