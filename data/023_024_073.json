Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nFinally, let's find the coefficients b_n:\n\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(t) * sin(nωt) dt] from 0 to T\nb_n = (1/2) * ∫[-1 * sin(nωt) dt] from 0 to 1 + (1/2) * ∫[0 * sin(nωt) dt] from 1 to 2\nb_n = (1/2) * [1/nω * cos(nωt)] from 0 to 1 + 0\nb_n = (1/2) * [1/nω * (cos(nω) - cos(0))]\nb_n = (1/2nω) * (cos(nω) - 1)\n\nSince ω = π, we have:\n\nb_n = (1/2nπ) * (cos(nπ) - 1)\n\nNow we have all the coefficients:\n\na_0 = -1/2\na_n = 0 for all n\nb_n = (1/2nπ) * (cos(nπ) - 1)\n\nSo the Fourier series representation of f(t) is:\n\nf(t) = -1/2 + Σ [(1/2nπ) * (cos(nπ) - 1) * sin(nπt)] for n = 1 to infinity"
