    "message_1": "The problem is to minimize the function f(x) = x^2 - 5cos(2x) over the interval [0, 10] using the simulated annealing method. Find the minimum value of the function and the corresponding value of x.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the temperature T and the initial solution x_current.\n2. Generate a random neighboring solution x_neighbor.\n3. Calculate the change in the objective function Δf = f(x_neighbor) - f(x_current).\n4. If Δf < 0, accept the new solution x_neighbor as x_current.\n5. If Δf > 0, accept the new solution x_neighbor as x_current with probability exp(-Δf/T).\n6. Decrease the temperature T according to a cooling schedule.\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the stopping criterion is met (e.g., a certain number of iterations or a minimum temperature is reached).\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the simulated annealing method for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 - 5 * np.cos(2 * x)\n\ndef simulated_annealing(T_init, cooling_rate, num_iterations, x_bounds):\n    T = T_init\n    x_current = np.random.uniform(x_bounds[0], x_bounds[1])\n    f_current = f(x_current)\n\n    for _ in range(num_iterations):\n        x_neighbor = np.random.uniform(x_bounds[0], x_bounds[1])\n        f_neighbor = f(x_neighbor)\n\n        delta_f = f_neighbor - f_current\n\n        if delta_f < 0 or np.random.rand() < np.exp(-delta_f / T):\n            x_current = x_neighbor\n            f_current = f_neighbor\n\n        T *= cooling_rate\n\n    return x_current, f_current\n\nT_init = 100\ncooling_rate = 0.99\nnum_iterations = 1000\nx_bounds = [0, 10]\n\nx_min, f_min = simulated_annealing(T_init, cooling_rate, num_iterations, x_bounds)\n\nprint(\"Minimum value of the function: {:.4f}\".format(f_min))\nprint(\"Corresponding value of x: {:.4f}\".format(x_min))\n```\n\nPlease note that the simulated annealing method is a stochastic optimization technique, so the results may vary between different runs. You can run the algorithm multiple times and choose the best solution found."
