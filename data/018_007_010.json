    "message_2": "Let S be a set with 3 elements, i.e., S = {a, b, c}. The power set of S, denoted as P(S), is the set of all possible subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself.\n\nP(S) = {âˆ…, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}\n\nThere are 8 elements in the power set of S. We can compute this number using the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the set S. In this case, n = 3, so the number of elements in the power set of S is 2^3 = 8.\n\nNow, we need to prove that the number of elements in the power set of S is always greater than the number of elements in S itself. Since the number of elements in S is 3, we need to show that 8 > 3, which is true.\n\nIn general, for any set S with n elements, the number of elements in the power set of S is 2^n. Since 2^n is an exponential function, it grows much faster than the linear function n. Therefore, for any set S with n elements, the number of elements in the power set of S (2^n) will always be greater than the number of elements in S (n) itself."
