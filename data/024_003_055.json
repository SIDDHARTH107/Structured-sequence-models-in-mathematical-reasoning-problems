    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = xy at the origin (0,0,0), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. \n\nLet's parameterize the surface by the coordinates (u, v) such that x = u, y = v, and z = uv. Then, the position vector of the surface is given by:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, uv)\n\nNow, we find the first derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, v)\nr_v = (0, 1, u)\n\nNext, we find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + v^2\nF = r_u • r_v = uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + u^2\n\nNow, we find the second derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 0)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 1)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 0)\n\nNext, we find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = r_uu • N = 0\nM = r_uv • N = -1\nN = r_vv • N = 0\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K using the first and second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the origin (0,0,0), we have u = 0 and v = 0. Therefore, E = 1, F = 0, G = 1, L = 0, M = -1, and N = 0. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nK = (0 - (-1)^2) / (1 - 0^2) = -1\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = xy at the origin (0,0,0) is -1."
