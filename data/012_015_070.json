    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph is connected or not, we can use the fact that a graph with n vertices is connected if it has at least (n-1) edges and the edges are distributed in such a way that there is a path between any two vertices.\n\nIn this case, we have a graph with 7 vertices. The minimum number of edges required to make it connected is (7-1) = 6 edges.\n\nSince our graph has 10 edges, which is more than the minimum required, it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, we cannot guarantee that it is connected without knowing the specific distribution of the edges. There could be a scenario where the edges are not distributed in a way that connects all vertices.\n\nIn conclusion, it is possible for the graph to be connected, but we cannot determine for sure without more information about the distribution of the edges."
