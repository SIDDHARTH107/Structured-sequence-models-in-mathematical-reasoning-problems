    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, and then find the Cartesian product of B and A. Take their union and show that they are not the same.",
    "message_2": "The Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. \n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nThe Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B × A, is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A.\n\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's take the union of A × B and B × A:\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nWe can see that the elements in A × B are not the same as the elements in B × A, as the ordered pairs have different components. Therefore, A × B and B × A are not the same, and their union contains all the distinct ordered pairs from both sets."
