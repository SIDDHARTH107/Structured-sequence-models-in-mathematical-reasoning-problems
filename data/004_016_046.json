    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, let's consider the position function of the car, s(t), where s(t) represents the distance traveled by the car at time t. The function s(t) is continuous and differentiable on the interval [0, 2] since the car is moving continuously during the 2 hours.\n\nThe average rate of change of the position function over the interval [0, 2] is given by:\n\n(Δs) / (Δt) = (s(2) - s(0)) / (2 - 0)\n\nSince the car travels 120 km in 2 hours, we have:\n\n(Δs) / (Δt) = (120 - 0) / (2 - 0) = 120 / 2 = 60 km/h\n\nNow, we need to find a point c in the interval (0, 2) such that the derivative of the position function, s'(t), is equal to the average rate of change:\n\ns'(c) = 60 km/h\n\ns'(t) represents the instantaneous velocity of the car at time t. According to the Mean Value Theorem, since s(t) is continuous on [0, 2] and differentiable on (0, 2), there must exist a point c in the interval (0, 2) such that s'(c) = 60 km/h.\n\nTherefore, we have proved that there was a moment during the trip when the car was traveling at exactly 60 km/h."
