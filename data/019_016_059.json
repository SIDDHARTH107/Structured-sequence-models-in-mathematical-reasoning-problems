    "message_2": "To find the number of elements in set A after removing the elements in set B, we can simply subtract the number of elements in set B from the number of elements in set A.\n\nSet A has 9 elements, and set B has 4 elements. So after removing the elements in set B from set A, we have:\n\n9 - 4 = 5 elements\n\nSo, there are 5 elements in set A after removing the elements in set B."
