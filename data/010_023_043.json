    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of crossing changes required to transform one knot into another, we can use the concept of knot invariants. In particular, we can use the Jones polynomial, which is an invariant under the Reidemeister moves and can detect the unknot.\n\nThe Jones polynomial for the knot 6_1 is V(6_1)(t) = t^2 - t^3 + t^4 - t^5 + t^6, and for the knot 3_1, it is V(3_1)(t) = t - 1 + t^(-1).\n\nSince the Jones polynomials for these two knots are different, we know that at least one crossing change is required to transform one knot into the other. However, we need to determine the minimum number of crossing changes required.\n\nTo do this, we can use the concept of the unknotting number, which is the minimum number of crossing changes required to transform a knot into the unknot. The unknotting number for the knot 6_1 is 1, and for the knot 3_1, it is also 1.\n\nSince both knots have an unknotting number of 1, we can transform each knot into the unknot with a single crossing change. Therefore, the minimum number of crossing changes required to transform the knot 6_1 into the knot 3_1 is 2. One crossing change to transform 6_1 into the unknot, and another crossing change to transform the unknot into 3_1."
