    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2(e^x) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together: u(x) = x^2 and v(x) = e^x.\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is given by:\n\nd(uv)/dx = u(dv/dx) + v(du/dx)\n\nNow, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x) with respect to x:\n\ndu/dx = d(x^2)/dx = 2x\ndv/dx = d(e^x)/dx = e^x\n\nNow, we apply the product rule:\n\nd(uv)/dx = u(dv/dx) + v(du/dx)\ndf/dx = x^2(e^x) + e^x(2x)\n\nNow, we find the derivative of the function f(x) at x = 3:\n\ndf/dx(3) = (3^2)(e^3) + (e^3)(2(3))\ndf/dx(3) = 9e^3 + 6e^3\ndf/dx(3) = 15e^3\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2(e^x) at x = 3 is 15e^3."
