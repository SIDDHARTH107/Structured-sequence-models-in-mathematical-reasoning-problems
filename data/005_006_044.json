    "message_1": "A manufacturer of light bulbs knows that the lifetimes of its light bulbs are normally distributed with a mean lifetime of 2700 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours. If a retailer orders 200 of these light bulbs, what is the probability that the average lifetime of these bulbs will be less than 2705 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution. In this case, we are given the population mean (µ = 2700 hours) and population standard deviation (σ = 100 hours). We are also given the sample size (n = 200) and the value for which we want to find the probability (x̄ = 2705 hours).\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample means, which is given by the formula:\n\nσ_x̄ = σ / √n\n\nσ_x̄ = 100 / √200\nσ_x̄ ≈ 7.071\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the given value of x̄. The z-score is given by the formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - µ) / σ_x̄\n\nz = (2705 - 2700) / 7.071\nz ≈ 0.707\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the average lifetime of the bulbs will be less than 2705 hours, which is the same as finding the area under the standard normal distribution curve to the left of the z-score 0.707. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find this probability.\n\nP(Z < 0.707) ≈ 0.760\n\nSo, the probability that the average lifetime of the 200 light bulbs will be less than 2705 hours is approximately 0.760 or 76%."
