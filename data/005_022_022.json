    "message_1": "A researcher wants to study the average height of 20 people in a specific region. However, the data set is contaminated with some outliers. Calculate the median height of the 20 people after removing the top and bottom 10% of the data.",
    "message_2": "To remove the top and bottom 10% of the data, we first need to determine how many data points to remove from each end. Since there are 20 people in the data set, 10% of 20 is 2. So, we will remove the 2 highest and 2 lowest heights from the data set.\n\nAfter removing the top and bottom 10%, we are left with 16 data points. To find the median height, we need to find the middle value(s) of the remaining data points.\n\nSince there are 16 data points, there is an even number of values, so the median will be the average of the two middle values. To find these values, we will take the 8th and 9th values in the ordered data set.\n\nLet's assume the ordered data set (after removing the outliers) is as follows:\n\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7, h8, h9, h10, h11, h12, h13, h14, h15, h16\n\nThe median height will be the average of h8 and h9:\n\nMedian height = (h8 + h9) / 2"
