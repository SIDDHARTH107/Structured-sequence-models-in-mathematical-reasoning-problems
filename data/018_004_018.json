    "message_2": "To prove that B and C are unique complements of A, we need to show that B and C are the only sets that satisfy the properties of a complement of A. A complement of a set A, denoted as A', is a set that contains all the elements that are not in A, and when A and A' are combined, they form the universal set U.\n\nIn this case, the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nLet's verify that B and C are complements of A:\n\n1. A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} = U\n2. A ∩ B = {} (empty set)\n3. A ∪ C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} = U\n4. A ∩ C = {} (empty set)\n\nNow, let's assume there exists another set D that is also a complement of A. This means that:\n\n1. A ∪ D = U\n2. A ∩ D = {} (empty set)\n\nSince A ∪ D = U, and we know that A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, then D must contain all the elements that are not in A. However, this is exactly the definition of the complements B and C. Therefore, D must be either equal to B or C.\n\nIn other words, there cannot be another set D that is a complement of A without being equal to either B or C. This proves that B and C are unique complements of A."
