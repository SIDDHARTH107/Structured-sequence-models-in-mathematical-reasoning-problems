    "message_2": "This system of linear equations does not have a unique solution. To see why, let's try to solve it using the method of substitution or elimination.\n\nFirst, notice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 4\n\nWhich is the same as the first equation. This means that the two equations are not independent, and they represent the same line in the xy-plane.\n\nSince the two equations represent the same line, there are infinitely many solutions that satisfy both equations. In other words, any point on the line 2x + 3y = 4 is a solution to the system of equations. To express the solutions in terms of one variable, we can solve for y in terms of x (or vice versa):\n\n3y = -2x + 4\ny = (-2/3)x + 4/3\n\nSo, the solutions to the system of equations are given by the set of points (x, y) such that y = (-2/3)x + 4/3."
