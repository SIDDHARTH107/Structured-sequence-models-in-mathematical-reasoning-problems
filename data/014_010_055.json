    "message_2": "Yes, I can figure out the original message. Using the given substitution pattern, we can decrypt the message as follows:\n\nH -> G (a -> h, so h -> a + 7 -> g)\nt -> o (b -> t, so t -> b + 7 -> o)\nf -> r (c -> f, so f -> c + 7 -> r)\nx -> e (d -> x, so x -> d + 7 -> e)\nm -> a (e -> m, so m -> e + 7 -> a)\n\nFollowing this pattern, we can decrypt the entire message:\n\nHtfxm nyby npj xtwtbm tkf hytwz\nGreat work on secret code for giants\n\nSo, the original message was: \"Great work on secret code for giants\"."
