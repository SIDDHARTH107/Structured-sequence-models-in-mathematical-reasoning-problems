    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector $\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ along the curve $\\gamma(t) = (t, t, t)$, we first need to find the tangent vector of the curve $\\gamma(t)$. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the curve with respect to the parameter $t$:\n\n$\\gamma'(t) = \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt} = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\1\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNow, we need to find a connection on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Since we are working in Euclidean space, we can use the Levi-Civita connection, which is given by:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} = 0$.\n\nThis equation states that the covariant derivative of the vector $\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ along the tangent vector $\\gamma'(t)$ is zero. In other words, the vector is parallel transported along the curve.\n\nSince the covariant derivative is zero, the vector remains unchanged along the curve. Therefore, the parallel transport of the vector $\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ along the curve $\\gamma(t)$ from the point $(0,0,0)$ to the point $(1,1,1)$ is:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$."
