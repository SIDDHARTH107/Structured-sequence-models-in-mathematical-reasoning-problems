    "message_2": "To use the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x - 4. The derivative, f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 3\n\nNow, we apply the Newton-Raphson formula:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nOur initial guess is x0 = 1. We plug this into the formula:\n\nx1 = 1 - (1^3 - 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 4) / (3(1)^2 - 4(1) + 3)\nx1 = 1 - (-2) / 2\nx1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nNow, we repeat the process with x1 = 2:\n\nx2 = x1 - f(x1) / f'(x1)\nx2 = 2 - (2^3 - 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 4) / (3(2)^2 - 4(2) + 3)\nx2 = 2 - (8 - 8 + 6 - 4) / (12 - 8 + 3)\nx2 = 2 - (2) / 7\nx2 ≈ 1.7143\n\nWe can continue this process until the result converges to the desired accuracy. In this case, we have reached 4 decimal places of accuracy with x2 ≈ 1.7143. Therefore, the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x - 4, using the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of x0 = 1, is approximately 1.7143."
