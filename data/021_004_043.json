    "message_1": "Suppose you have a continuous function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1. Use the 3-point forward difference formula to approximate the first derivative of f at x = 2 with a step size of h = 0.1, and then use the 3-point backward difference formula to approximate the first derivative of f at x = 2 with the same step size. Compare the results obtained with the exact value of f'(2).",
    "message_2": "To approximate the first derivative of f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 at x = 2 using the 3-point forward difference formula, we need to evaluate the function at x = 2, x = 2 + h, and x = 2 + 2h, where h = 0.1.\n\nf(2) = (2)^2 + 2(2) + 1 = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9\nf(2 + h) = (2.1)^2 + 2(2.1) + 1 = 4.41 + 4.2 + 1 = 9.61\nf(2 + 2h) = (2.2)^2 + 2(2.2) + 1 = 4.84 + 4.4 + 1 = 10.24\n\nNow, we can apply the 3-point forward difference formula:\nf'(2) ≈ (-3/2)f(2) + 2f(2 + h) - (1/2)f(2 + 2h) = (-3/2)(9) + 2(9.61) - (1/2)(10.24) = -13.5 + 19.22 - 5.12 = 0.6\n\nNext, we will use the 3-point backward difference formula. For this, we need to evaluate the function at x = 2 - 2h, x = 2 - h, and x = 2.\n\nf(2 - 2h) = (1.8)^2 + 2(1.8) + 1 = 3.24 + 3.6 + 1 = 7.84\nf(2 - h) = (1.9)^2 + 2(1.9) + 1 = 3.61 + 3.8 + 1 = 8.41\n\nNow, we can apply the 3-point backward difference formula:\nf'(2) ≈ (1/2)f(2 - 2h) - 2f(2 - h) + (3/2)f(2) = (1/2)(7.84) - 2(8.41) + (3/2)(9) = 3.92 - 16.82 + 13.5 = 0.6\n\nBoth the forward and backward difference formulas give us an approximation of f'(2) = 0.6.\n\nNow, let's find the exact value of f'(x) by taking the derivative of f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1:\nf'(x) = 2x + 2\n\nNow, we can find the exact value of f'(2):\nf'(2) = 2(2) + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nComparing the results, we can see that both the forward and backward difference approximations give us f'(2) = 0.6, while the exact value is f'(2) = 6. The approximations have an error of 5.4."
