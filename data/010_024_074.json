    "message_2": "To find the volume of a hyperbolic cylinder in hyperbolic space, we need to use the formula for the volume of a hyperbolic cylinder:\n\nV = 2π sinh(r) * h\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the base radius, h is the height, and sinh is the hyperbolic sine function.\n\nIn this case, the base radius r is 5 and the height h is 8. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = 2π sinh(5) * 8\n\nNow, we need to find the value of sinh(5):\n\nsinh(5) ≈ 74.20321058\n\nNow, we can find the volume:\n\nV ≈ 2π * 74.20321058 * 8\nV ≈ 3.14159265 * 74.20321058 * 8\nV ≈ 1857.7184308\n\nSo, the volume of the hyperbolic cylinder with a base radius of 5 and a height of 8 in hyperbolic space is approximately 1857.72 cubic units."
