    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the structure of the given group G. We can see that the order of G is 20, not 40. Now, let's find the order of each element:\n\n- Order of e is 1 (identity element).\n- Order of a, b, c, and d is 4 (e.g., a^4 = e).\n- Order of f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, and t is 2 (e.g., f^2 = e).\n\nNow, let's find the subgroups of G. We can see that there are two cyclic subgroups of order 4:\n\n- H1 = {e, a, b, c} with a^4 = e.\n- H2 = {e, d, c, b} with d^4 = e.\n\nAnd there is a subgroup of order 2:\n\n- H3 = {e, f} with f^2 = e.\n\nWe can see that the group G is non-abelian since, for example, ab ≠ ba. Now, let's find the group G is isomorphic to. There are two non-abelian groups of order 20: the dihedral group D_10 and the semidirect product of Z_4 and Z_5, denoted as Z_4 ⋊ Z_5.\n\nThe dihedral group D_10 has elements of order 2 and 10, while our group G has elements of order 2 and 4. So, G cannot be isomorphic to D_10.\n\nNow, let's check if G is isomorphic to Z_4 ⋊ Z_5. The semidirect product of Z_4 and Z_5 has the following structure:\n\n- Z_4 = {1, a, a^2, a^3} with a^4 = 1.\n- Z_5 = {1, b, b^2, b^3, b^4} with b^5 = 1.\n- ab = ba^r for some r in {1, 2, 3}.\n\nIn our group G, we can identify the following elements:\n\n- a = a (order 4).\n- b = f (order 2).\n\nNow, let's check the relation ab = ba^r:\n\n- af = fa (r = 1).\n\nSo, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product Z_4 ⋊ Z_5 with r = 1."
