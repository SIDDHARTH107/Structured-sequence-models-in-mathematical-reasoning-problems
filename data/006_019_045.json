    "message_1": "In a country, the probability of a certain political event occurring in any given year is 0.35. What is the probability of this event not occurring in the next 3 years?",
    "message_2": "The probability of the event not occurring in a single year is 1 - 0.35 = 0.65. To find the probability of the event not occurring in the next 3 years, we need to multiply the probabilities of it not occurring in each of those years:\n\n0.65 * 0.65 * 0.65 = 0.274625\n\nSo, the probability of the event not occurring in the next 3 years is approximately 0.275 or 27.5%."
