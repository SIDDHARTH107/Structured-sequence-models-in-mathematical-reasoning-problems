    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the first equation by 3 to make the coefficients of y in both equations equal:\n\n(2x + y) * 3 = 5 * 3\n6x + 3y = 15\n\nNow we have the two equations:\n\n6x + 3y = 15\n4x - 3y = 6\n\nNext, we will add the two equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(6x + 3y) + (4x - 3y) = 15 + 6\n6x + 3y + 4x - 3y = 21\n10x = 21\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\n\n10x = 21\nx = 21 / 10\nx = 2.1\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of y. We will use the first equation:\n\n2x + y = 5\n2(2.1) + y = 5\n4.2 + y = 5\n\nNow, we will solve for y:\n\ny = 5 - 4.2\ny = 0.8\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2.1 and y = 0.8."
