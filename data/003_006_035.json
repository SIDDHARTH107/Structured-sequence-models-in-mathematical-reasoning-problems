    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Law of Sines, which states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides. In this case, we have:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nWe are given angle A = 78°, angle B = 38°, and side a = 10 units. We can find angle C by using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°:\n\nC = 180° - A - B = 180° - 78° - 38° = 64°\n\nNow we can use the Law of Sines to find side b:\n\nb / sin(B) = a / sin(A)\nb / sin(38°) = 10 / sin(78°)\n\nTo isolate b, we can multiply both sides by sin(38°):\n\nb = 10 * sin(38°) / sin(78°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nb ≈ 6.36 units\n\nNow we can use the Law of Sines to find side c:\n\nc / sin(C) = a / sin(A)\nc / sin(64°) = 10 / sin(78°)\n\nTo isolate c, we can multiply both sides by sin(64°):\n\nc = 10 * sin(64°) / sin(78°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nc ≈ 9.39 units\n\nSo, the length of side b is approximately 6.36 units, and the length of side c is approximately 9.39 units."
