    "message_1": "A grocery store has 10 different types of fruits. Every day, the manager picks 5 types of fruits to sell in a fruit basket. How many ways can the manager choose the fruits to include in the basket?",
    "message_2": "The manager needs to choose 5 types of fruits out of 10. This is a combination problem since the order of the fruits does not matter. We can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 10 types of fruits) and k is the number of items to choose (in this case, 5 types of fruits).\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo, there are 252 ways the manager can choose the fruits to include in the basket."
