    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of A, denoted as A', consists of all the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nLet's assume U = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} for this problem.\n\nNow, we can find the complement of A, A' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}. In other words, A' contains all the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nA' = {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nNext, we find the intersection of A and its complement, A ∩ A'. The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ A' = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ A'}\n\nSince A and A' have no common elements, their intersection is the empty set:\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nTo verify this using set theory, we can use the definition of the empty set and the complement of a set. The empty set is a subset of every set, including A and A'. Since A and A' have no common elements, their intersection must be the empty set.\n\nThus, we have verified that the intersection of A and its complement is indeed the empty set using set theory."
