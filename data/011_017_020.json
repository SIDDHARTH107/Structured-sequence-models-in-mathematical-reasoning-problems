    "message_1": "A group of 5 friends want to organize a carpool to attend a concert. There are 5 cars available and each car fits exactly 2 people. In how many ways can the group be arranged to use all the cars without any person repeating a car or riding with someone they do not like? (Hint: Use Latin Square theory to solve. Assume that the group of friends consists of friends A, B, C, D, and E, and that they will only ride with their preferred companions.)",
    "message_2": "Let's first list the preferred companions for each friend:\n\nA: B, C\nB: A, D\nC: A, E\nD: B, E\nE: C, D\n\nNow, we will use Latin Square theory to solve the problem. A Latin Square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.\n\nWe will create a 5x5 Latin Square with the friends as rows and the cars as columns. Each cell will represent a pair of friends riding together in a specific car.\n\nSince there are 5 cars, we will use the numbers 1 to 5 to represent the cars. We will fill the Latin Square according to the preferred companions of each friend.\n\n1 2 3 4 5 (Cars)\n---------\nA B C D E (Friends)\nB A D E C\nC E A B D\nD C E A B\nE D B C A\n\nIn this Latin Square, each row represents a friend and each column represents a car. The intersection of a row and a column represents the friend that the person in that row will ride with in the car represented by that column.\n\nFor example, the intersection of row A and column 1 is B, meaning that friend A will ride with friend B in car 1.\n\nNow, we need to count the number of valid arrangements. We can do this by counting the number of valid Latin Squares that can be formed with the given constraints.\n\nThere are 2 valid Latin Squares for this problem:\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n---------\nA B C D E\nB A D E C\nC E A B D\nD C E A B\nE D B C A\n\nand\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n---------\nA C B E D\nB D A C E\nC A E D B\nD E C B A\nE B D A C\n\nSo, there are 2 ways the group of friends can be arranged to use all the cars without any person repeating a car or riding with someone they do not like."
