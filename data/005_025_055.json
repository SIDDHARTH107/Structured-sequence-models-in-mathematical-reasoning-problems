    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of bananas from the same population, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (t * (s / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (120 grams)\nt = t-score (from the t-distribution table, for a 95% confidence level and 49 degrees of freedom, which is approximately 2.01)\ns = sample standard deviation (10 grams)\nn = sample size (50 bananas)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\n\nCI = 120 ± (2.01 * (10 / √50))\n\nCI = 120 ± (2.01 * (10 / 7.071))\n\nCI = 120 ± (2.01 * 1.414)\n\nCI = 120 ± 2.84\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true mean weight of bananas from the same population is approximately 117.16 grams to 122.84 grams."
