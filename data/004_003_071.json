    "message_2": "Let x be the length and width of the square base, and h be the height of the box. The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = x^2 * h = 400\n\nWe want to minimize the surface area of the box, which is given by:\n\nS = x^2 + 4xh\n\nSince we know the volume, we can solve for h in terms of x:\n\nh = 400 / x^2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the surface area equation:\n\nS(x) = x^2 + 4x(400 / x^2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nS(x) = x^2 + 1600 / x\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of S(x) with respect to x and setting it to zero:\n\ndS/dx = 2x - 1600 / x^2\n\nSet the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n2x - 1600 / x^2 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by x^2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n2x^3 - 1600 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx^3 = 800\nx = (800)^(1/3)\nx ≈ 9.283 cm\n\nNow, find the height using the expression for h:\n\nh = 400 / x^2\nh ≈ 400 / (9.283)^2\nh ≈ 4.641 cm\n\nSo, the dimensions that minimize the amount of material used to make the box are approximately length = width = 9.283 cm and height = 4.641 cm."
