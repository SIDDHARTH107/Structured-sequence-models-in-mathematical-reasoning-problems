    "message_2": "To find the point on the curve where the tangent line has a slope of 5, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 2, which represents the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^2 + 3x - 2)\n\nUsing the power rule and sum/difference rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 3\n\nNow, we want to find the point where the slope of the tangent line is 5, so we set f'(x) equal to 5:\n\n5 = 2x + 3\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\n2x = 2\nx = 1\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate, we can find the corresponding y-coordinate by plugging x back into the original function f(x):\n\nf(1) = (1)^2 + 3(1) - 2\nf(1) = 1 + 3 - 2\nf(1) = 2\n\nSo, the point on the curve where the tangent line has a slope of 5 is (1, 2)."
