    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression $2^{10} \\div 2^5$, we can use the rule for dividing exponential expressions with the same base: $a^{m} \\div a^{n} = a^{m-n}$. In this case, the base is 2, and the exponents are 10 and 5.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$2^{10} \\div 2^5 = 2^{10-5} = 2^5$\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is $2^5$."
