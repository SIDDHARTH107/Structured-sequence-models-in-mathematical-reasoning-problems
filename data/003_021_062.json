    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n𝐴 · 𝐵 = |𝐴| |𝐵| cos(θ)\n\nwhere 𝐴 · 𝐵 is the dot product of the vectors, |𝐴| and |𝐵| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the vectors 𝐴 and 𝐵:\n\n𝐴 · 𝐵 = (3)(5) + (-4)(2) = 15 - 8 = 7\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n|𝐴| = √(3² + (-4)²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|𝐵| = √(5² + 2²) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n7 = 5 * √29 * cos(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by 5 * √29:\n\ncos(θ) = 7 / (5 * √29)\n\nNow, find the inverse cosine (arccos) to get the angle in radians:\n\nθ = arccos(7 / (5 * √29))\n\nConvert the angle from radians to degrees:\n\nθ = (180/π) * arccos(7 / (5 * √29))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 43.58°\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors is approximately 43.58°."
