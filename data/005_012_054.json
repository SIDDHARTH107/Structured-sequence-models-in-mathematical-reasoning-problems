They randomly select 100 customers and find that their average age is 35 years old with a standard deviation of 5 years. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true average age of the company's customers in the region.",
    "message_2": "To construct a 95% confidence interval for the true average age of the company's customers in the region, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence interval = Sample mean ± (Critical value * Standard error)\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 35 years, the sample size is 100, and the standard deviation is 5 years. Since we want a 95% confidence interval, we will use a critical value of 1.96, which corresponds to the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) for a 95% confidence level.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard error = Standard deviation / √Sample size\nStandard error = 5 / √100\nStandard error = 5 / 10\nStandard error = 0.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of error = Critical value * Standard error\nMargin of error = 1.96 * 0.5\nMargin of error = 0.98\n\nFinally, we can construct the 95% confidence interval:\n\nConfidence interval = Sample mean ± Margin of error\nConfidence interval = 35 ± 0.98\n\nLower limit = 35 - 0.98 = 34.02 years\nUpper limit = 35 + 0.98 = 35.98 years\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true average age of the company's customers in the region is (34.02, 35.98) years."
