Otherwise, suppose that every element in G has order 1, 2, 4, or 5. Prove that G is isomorphic to either the dihedral group D10 or the non-abelian group of order 20.",
    "message_2": "First, let's assume that G has an element of order 20. Let this element be g. Since the order of g is 20, we know that g^20 = e (the identity element) and g^k ≠ e for any 0 < k < 20. Thus, the set {e, g, g^2, ..., g^19} contains 20 distinct elements, which means that this set is equal to G. Therefore, G is generated by a single element g, and so G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20.\n\nNow, let's assume that every element in G has order 1, 2, 4, or 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a subgroup of order 5 and a subgroup of order 4. Let H be a subgroup of order 5 and K be a subgroup of order 4. Since 5 is prime, H must be cyclic and isomorphic to C5. K must be either cyclic (isomorphic to C4) or isomorphic to the Klein four-group (V4).\n\nNotice that |H| = 5 and |K| = 4 are relatively prime, so |H ∩ K| = 1, which means H ∩ K = {e}. By the product formula, we have |HK| = |H| * |K| / |H ∩ K| = 5 * 4 / 1 = 20. Since |HK| = |G|, we have HK = G.\n\nNow, we consider two cases:\n\n1) If K is isomorphic to C4, then G is isomorphic to the external direct product of H and K, which is C5 × C4. However, C5 × C4 is isomorphic to C20, which contradicts our assumption that G does not have an element of order 20. Therefore, K cannot be isomorphic to C4.\n\n2) If K is isomorphic to V4, then G is isomorphic to the external direct product of H and K, which is C5 × V4. In this case, G is a non-abelian group of order 20. To see that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D10, we can define a group homomorphism φ: G → D10 such that φ maps the generator of H to a rotation of order 5 and the generators of K to reflections. Since H and K have relatively prime orders, φ is an isomorphism.\n\nIn conclusion, if G has an element of order 20, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C20. If every element in G has order 1, 2, 4, or 5, then G is isomorphic to either the dihedral group D10 or the non-abelian group of order 20."
