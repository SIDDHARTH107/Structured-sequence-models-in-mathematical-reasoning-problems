    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, X and Y. Each unit of X requires 2 hours of machine time and 3 hours of labor, and brings a profit of $50. Each unit of Y requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor, and brings a profit of $40. The company has 100 hours of machine time and 90 hours of labor available per day. Using Tabu Search, what is the maximum daily profit the company can earn from producing these two products?",
    "message_2": "Tabu Search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is used to find the best solution to a problem by exploring the solution space and avoiding previously visited solutions. In this case, we will use Tabu Search to find the optimal production plan for the company to maximize its daily profit.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced. The objective function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = 50x + 40y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 100 (machine time constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 90 (labor time constraint)\nx, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nTo apply Tabu Search, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a starting solution (x, y) and set the Tabu List size.\n2. Generate a set of neighboring solutions.\n3. Choose the best solution from the neighbors that is not in the Tabu List.\n4. Update the Tabu List and repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a target profit value).\n\nHowever, in this case, the problem can be solved more efficiently using linear programming methods, such as the Simplex algorithm or graphical methods. Using graphical methods, we can plot the constraint lines and find the feasible region. Then, we can find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nThe constraint lines are:\n\n2x + 3y = 100\n3x + 2y = 90\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 30), (20, 20), and (30, 0). Evaluating the objective function at each vertex, we get:\n\nProfit(0, 0) = 50(0) + 40(0) = $0\nProfit(0, 30) = 50(0) + 40(30) = $1200\nProfit(20, 20) = 50(20) + 40(20) = $1800\nProfit(30, 0) = 50(30) + 40(0) = $1500\n\nThe maximum daily profit is $1800, which is achieved by producing 20 units of product X and 20 units of product Y."
