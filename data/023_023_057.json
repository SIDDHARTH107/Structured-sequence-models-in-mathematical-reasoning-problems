    "message_2": "To find the frequency components of the given function f(x) = sin(3x) + cos(5x) using the Fourier Transform, we first need to express the function in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\nEuler's formula: e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)\n\nSo, we can rewrite f(x) as:\n\nf(x) = Im(e^(i3x)) + Re(e^(i5x))\n\nNow, we can apply the Fourier Transform F(ω) to f(x):\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-iωx)] dx, where the integral is taken over the entire real line.\n\nSince f(x) is a sum of two functions, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[Im(e^(i3x)) * e^(-iωx)] dx + ∫[Re(e^(i5x)) * e^(-iωx)] dx\n\nLet's solve each integral separately:\n\n1) ∫[Im(e^(i3x)) * e^(-iωx)] dx = ∫[Im(e^(i(3-ω)x))] dx\n\nThis integral is non-zero only when ω = 3, so we have a delta function:\n\n∫[Im(e^(i(3-ω)x))] dx = 2π * δ(ω - 3)\n\n2) ∫[Re(e^(i5x)) * e^(-iωx)] dx = ∫[Re(e^(i(5-ω)x))] dx\n\nThis integral is non-zero only when ω = 5, so we have another delta function:\n\n∫[Re(e^(i(5-ω)x))] dx = 2π * δ(ω - 5)\n\nNow, we can combine the results:\n\nF(ω) = 2π * δ(ω - 3) + 2π * δ(ω - 5)\n\nSo, the frequency components of the given function f(x) = sin(3x) + cos(5x) are ω1 = 3 and ω2 = 5."
