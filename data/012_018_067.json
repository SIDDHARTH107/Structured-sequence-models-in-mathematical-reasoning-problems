    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph into two components, we need to find a cut that separates the graph into two disjoint sets of vertices. The minimum number of edges that need to be removed to achieve this is equal to the size of the minimum cut.\n\nIn a connected graph with n vertices, the minimum cut can be found by considering the minimum degree of any vertex in the graph. Let's denote this minimum degree as d_min. This is because, by removing all the edges connected to the vertex with the minimum degree, we can disconnect the graph into two components.\n\nSince G has 8 vertices and 12 edges, the average degree of a vertex in G is (2 * 12) / 8 = 3. Therefore, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or less (d_min â‰¤ 3).\n\nIf d_min = 1, then we only need to remove 1 edge to disconnect the graph.\nIf d_min = 2, then we need to remove 2 edges to disconnect the graph.\nIf d_min = 3, then we need to remove 3 edges to disconnect the graph.\n\nSince we are looking for the minimum number of edges to be removed, we will consider the case where d_min = 1. Therefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph G into two components is 1."
