Finally, if G has no element of order 20 or 10, then prove that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 20.",
    "message_2": "1. If G has an element of order 20:\n\nLet a be an element of G with order 20. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by a, denoted by <a>, has 20 elements. Since the order of <a> is equal to the order of G, we have that G = <a>. Therefore, G is a cyclic group of order 20. Since there is only one cyclic group of order 20 up to isomorphism, G is isomorphic to C20.\n\n2. If G does not have an element of order 20, but has an element of order 10:\n\nLet b be an element of G with order 10. Then, the cyclic subgroup generated by b, denoted by <b>, has 10 elements. Since G has order 20 and <b> has order 10, there must be another element c in G that is not in <b>. Let the order of c be 2 (since the only divisors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20, and we know that G has no element of order 20, and the order of b is 10).\n\nNow, consider the elements of the form bc, where b is in <b> and c is the element of order 2. We claim that these elements are distinct and not in <b>. Suppose bc = b'c for some b, b' in <b>. Then, b = b' since c has order 2 and c^2 = e (the identity element). This shows that the elements of the form bc are distinct. Furthermore, if bc is in <b>, then c = b^(-1)(bc) is also in <b>, which is a contradiction since c is not in <b>. Thus, the elements of the form bc are distinct and not in <b>.\n\nSince G has 20 elements, and we have found 10 elements in <b> and 10 distinct elements of the form bc, we have accounted for all elements in G. The group operation in G can be described by the following relations: b^10 = e, c^2 = e, and cb = b^(-1)c. This is precisely the presentation of the dihedral group D10. Therefore, G is isomorphic to D10.\n\n3. If G has no element of order 20 or 10:\n\nSince G has order 20, by the Sylow theorems, G has a subgroup of order 5 and a subgroup of order 4. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 4-subgroup of G. Then, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 4. Since the order of P is prime, P is cyclic and isomorphic to C5. Similarly, since the order of Q is 4, Q is either isomorphic to C4 or to the Klein four-group V4.\n\nNow, since G has no element of order 10, P and Q must have trivial intersection (i.e., P âˆ© Q = {e}). By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G is congruent to 1 modulo 5 and divides 4. Thus, there can be either 1 or 4 Sylow 5-subgroups. Similarly, the number of Sylow 4-subgroups of G is congruent to 1 modulo 4 and divides 5. Thus, there can be either 1 or 5 Sylow 4-subgroups.\n\nSince G has no element of order 20 or 10, there must be more than one Sylow 5-subgroup and more than one Sylow 4-subgroup. Thus, there are 4 Sylow 5-subgroups and 5 Sylow 4-subgroups. By counting the number of elements in G, we have:\n\n|G| = 1 + 4(5-1) + 5(4-1) = 1 + 16 + 15 = 32,\n\nwhich is a contradiction since G has order 20. Therefore, G cannot have no element of order 20 or 10."
