    "message_1": "Let X be a complex projective variety of dimension 3 and let L be an ample line bundle on X. Consider the Mori cone of X, denoted by Mori(X). Suppose that the Mori cone of X is generated by the classes [E1], [E2], and [L], where [E1] and [E2] are the classes of two rational curves in X that are numerically equivalent to the class of a line in P^3. Given that [E1]^3=[E2]^3=-1, [E1].[E2]=1 and [L].[E1]=[L].[E2]=0, compute the self-intersection [L.L] in terms of the classes of [E1] and [E2].",
    "message_2": "To compute the self-intersection [L.L] in terms of the classes of [E1] and [E2], we will use the intersection product on the Chow ring of X. Since [E1] and [E2] are numerically equivalent to the class of a line in P^3, we can write [E1] = a[L] + b[E2] and [E2] = c[L] + d[E1] for some integers a, b, c, and d.\n\nNow, we are given that [E1]^3 = [E2]^3 = -1 and [E1].[E2] = 1. Using these equations, we can write:\n\n(E1)^3 = (a[L] + b[E2])^3 = -1\n(E2)^3 = (c[L] + d[E1])^3 = -1\n(E1).(E2) = (a[L] + b[E2]).(c[L] + d[E1]) = 1\n\nExpanding the first two equations, we get:\n\na^3[L^3] + 3a^2b[L^2][E2] + 3ab^2[L][E2]^2 + b^3[E2]^3 = -1\nc^3[L^3] + 3c^2d[L^2][E1] + 3cd^2[L][E1]^2 + d^3[E1]^3 = -1\n\nWe know that [L].[E1] = [L].[E2] = 0, so the terms with [L][E1] and [L][E2] vanish. We are left with:\n\na^3[L^3] + b^3[E2]^3 = -1\nc^3[L^3] + d^3[E1]^3 = -1\n\nNow, we can use the third equation:\n\n1 = (a[L] + b[E2]).(c[L] + d[E1]) = ac[L^2] + ad[L][E1] + bc[L][E2] + bd[E1][E2]\n\nSince [L].[E1] = [L].[E2] = 0, we have:\n\n1 = ac[L^2] + bd[E1][E2]\n\nWe want to compute [L.L], which is the coefficient of [L^2] in the above equation. We can rearrange the equation to get:\n\n[L^2] = (1 - bd[E1][E2]) / ac\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for [E1] and [E2] in terms of [L], [E1], and [E2]:\n\n[L^2] = (1 - bd(a[L] + b[E2])(c[L] + d[E1])) / ac\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n[L^2] = (1 - abcd[E1][E2]) / ac\n\nSince we are looking for the self-intersection [L.L], we can ignore the terms involving [E1] and [E2] and focus on the term without them:\n\n[L.L] = 1 / ac\n\nThis is the self-intersection of [L] in terms of the classes of [E1] and [E2]."
