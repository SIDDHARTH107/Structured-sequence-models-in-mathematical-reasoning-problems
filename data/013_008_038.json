    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem related to Public Goods Game from the perspective of a math student to solve:\n\nIn a group of five individuals, each person can contribute any amount between 0 and 10 dollars into a shared pool. The total amount contributed is then multiplied by 1.5 and distributed equally among all group members, regardless of how much they contributed themselves. However, non-donors receive nothing from the pool.\n\nAssuming that all individuals concern only with their personal payoff and behave rationally, what is the Nash equilibrium of this Public Goods Game? In other words, what is the optimal amount each person should contribute so as to maximize their own benefit?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to determine the optimal contribution for each individual, assuming that the other individuals are also contributing optimally.\n\nLet's denote the contribution of each individual as c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5. The total amount contributed to the pool is the sum of these contributions: C = c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5.\n\nThe total amount in the pool after the 1.5 multiplier is 1.5 * C. This amount is then distributed equally among all group members who contributed, so each contributor receives (1.5 * C) / 5.\n\nThe payoff for each individual is the amount they receive from the pool minus their contribution. For example, the payoff for individual 1 is ((1.5 * C) / 5) - c1.\n\nIn a Nash equilibrium, each individual's contribution should be such that they cannot increase their payoff by changing their contribution, given the contributions of the other individuals.\n\nIf an individual contributes nothing (ci = 0), they receive nothing from the pool. If they contribute a small positive amount, their payoff will be positive because the 1.5 multiplier increases the total pool. However, as they increase their contribution, their payoff will decrease because the cost of their contribution outweighs the benefit they receive from the pool.\n\nIn this game, the Nash equilibrium is for each individual to contribute nothing (c1 = c2 = c3 = c4 = c5 = 0). This is because if any individual increases their contribution, their payoff will decrease, given that the other individuals are contributing nothing. In this equilibrium, each individual's payoff is 0, and they cannot increase their payoff by changing their contribution."
