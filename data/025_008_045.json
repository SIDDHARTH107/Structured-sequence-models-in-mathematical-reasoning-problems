    "message_2": "Given the Picard number $\\rho = 10$, we can use the formula provided to find the Hodge number $h^{1,1}$ of a K3 surface:\n\n$h^{1,1} = 1 + \\frac{\\rho(\\rho - 1)}{2} - \\sum_{i=1}^{h^{1,1}}\\operatorname{rank}(H^{1,1}(X,\\mathbb{Z}))$\n\nSince a K3 surface always has $h^{2,0} = h^{0,2} = 0$, the sum term in the formula is also 0. Therefore, we can simplify the formula to:\n\n$h^{1,1} = 1 + \\frac{\\rho(\\rho - 1)}{2}$\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of $\\rho = 10$:\n\n$h^{1,1} = 1 + \\frac{10(10 - 1)}{2} = 1 + \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 1 + 45 = 46$\n\nSo, the Hodge number $h^{1,1}$ of a K3 surface with Picard number $\\rho = 10$ is 46."
