If point A is 5 km east of point B and the car traveled at an average speed of 60 km/h, prove that there was a moment during the journey when the car was traveling exactly to the west. (Hint: Use the mean value theorem for derivatives.)",
    "message_2": "To prove that there was a moment during the journey when the car was traveling exactly to the west, we need to show that there was a moment when the car's velocity was -60 km/h (negative because it's traveling to the west).\n\nLet's consider a function f(t) that represents the position of the car along the straight road at time t, where t is in hours. We know that f(0) = 5 km (the initial position) and f(T) = 0 km (the final position), where T is the total time taken for the journey.\n\nSince the car traveled at an average speed of 60 km/h, we can find the total time taken for the journey:\n\n5 km / 60 km/h = 1/12 h\n\nSo, T = 1/12 h.\n\nNow, let's apply the mean value theorem for derivatives. The mean value theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that:\n\nf'(c) = (f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a)\n\nIn our case, the function f(t) is continuous on the closed interval [0, 1/12] and differentiable on the open interval (0, 1/12). Therefore, there exists a point c in the interval (0, 1/12) such that:\n\nf'(c) = (f(1/12) - f(0)) / (1/12 - 0)\n\nf'(c) = (0 - 5) / (1/12)\n\nf'(c) = -60\n\nSince f'(c) represents the velocity of the car at time c, we have shown that there was a moment during the journey when the car was traveling exactly to the west with a velocity of -60 km/h."
