    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector of the pizza, we need to calculate the arc length and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius of the pizza. Since the diameter is 16 inches, the radius (r) is half of that:\n\nr = 16 / 2 = 8 inches\n\nNow, let's find the arc length. The formula for the arc length (L) of a circle is:\n\nL = (θ/360) * 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 45 degrees, and the radius is 8 inches. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nL = (45/360) * 2π(8)\nL = (1/8) * 16π\nL = 2π inches\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the sector, we add the arc length to the two radii:\n\nPerimeter = L + 2r\nPerimeter = 2π + 2(8)\nPerimeter = 2π + 16\n\nThe perimeter of the sector is 2π + 16 inches."
