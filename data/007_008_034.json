    "message_2": "We will use the concept of modular arithmetic to solve this problem. We want to find the remainder when 7^28 is divided by 29, which can be written as:\n\n7^28 ≡ r (mod 29)\n\nFirst, let's find the smallest power of 7 that is congruent to 1 modulo 29. We can do this by checking successive powers of 7:\n\n7^1 ≡ 7 (mod 29)\n7^2 ≡ 20 (mod 29)\n7^3 ≡ 24 (mod 29)\n7^4 ≡ 23 (mod 29)\n7^5 ≡ 25 (mod 29)\n7^6 ≡ 1 (mod 29)\n\nWe found that 7^6 ≡ 1 (mod 29). Now, we can use this result to simplify the original expression:\n\n7^28 ≡ (7^6)^4 * 7^4 ≡ 1^4 * 7^4 ≡ 7^4 (mod 29)\n\nNow we just need to find the remainder when 7^4 is divided by 29:\n\n7^4 ≡ 23 (mod 29)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^28 is divided by 29 is 23."
