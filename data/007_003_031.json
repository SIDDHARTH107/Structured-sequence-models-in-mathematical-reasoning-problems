    "message_2": "Since $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ and $b \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$, we can write $a = 7m + 3$ and $b = 7n + 5$ for some integers $m$ and $n$. Now, we want to find the value of $ab$ modulo 7.\n\nWe have $ab = (7m + 3)(7n + 5) = 49mn + 35m + 21n + 15$. Notice that $49mn$, $35m$, and $21n$ are all divisible by 7. Therefore, we only need to consider the remainder of $15$ when divided by 7.\n\nSo, $ab \\equiv 15 \\pmod{7}$. Since $15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$, we have $ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$."
