    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with a singular coefficient matrix, we first need to determine if the system has a solution. We can do this by checking if the system is consistent.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n```\n3x + 4y - 2z = 9\n6x + 8y - 4z = 18\n9x + 12y - 6z = 27\n```\n\nWe can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are linearly dependent, and the system has infinitely many solutions or no solution.\n\nTo check for consistency, we can see if the constant terms (9, 18, and 27) follow the same pattern as the coefficients. Since 18 is 2 times 9, and 27 is 3 times 9, the system is consistent.\n\nSince the system is consistent and the equations are linearly dependent, there are infinitely many solutions. We can express the solutions in terms of a free variable. Let's solve for x and y in terms of z.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n3x + 4y - 2z = 9\n\nWe can isolate x:\nx = (9 - 4y + 2z) / 3\n\nNow, we can express y in terms of z by choosing z as a free variable:\ny = y\n\nSo, the general solution for this system of linear equations is:\nx = (9 - 4y + 2z) / 3\ny = y\nz = z"
