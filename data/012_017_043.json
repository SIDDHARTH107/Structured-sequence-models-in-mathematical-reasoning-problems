    "message_2": "A perfect matching in an undirected graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex, and no two edges share a vertex.\n\nIn this graph, there are two possible perfect matchings:\n\n1. Edge AB and edge CD\n2. Edge AC and edge BD\n\nSo, the maximum number of perfect matchings in this graph is 2."
