    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph G with 10 vertices so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color depends on the structure of the graph. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph (every vertex is connected to every other vertex). In this case, we can use the chromatic number formula for complete graphs:\n\nChromatic number = χ(G) = n if the graph is odd, and χ(G) = n + 1 if the graph is even.\n\nSince our graph has 10 vertices, which is an even number, the minimum number of colors needed is:\n\nχ(G) = 10 + 1 = 11 colors."
