Compute the inverse of a'^a mod P, where a is the private key and P is the prime number from the public key.\n2. Multiply the inverse by b mod P to obtain the plaintext message.\n\nGiven the information:\n\nPublic key (P, α, β) = (23, 5, 10)\nPrivate key a = 7\nCiphertext (a', b) = (3, 18)\n\nStep 1: Compute the inverse of a'^a mod P\na'^a mod P = 3^7 mod 23 = 1877 mod 23 = 10\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of 10 mod 23. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for this.\n\nExtended Euclidean Algorithm for 10 and 23:\n23 = 2 * 10 + 3\n10 = 3 * 3 + 1\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equations:\n1 = 10 - 3 * 3\n1 = 10 - 3 * (23 - 2 * 10)\n1 = 10 - 3 * 23 + 6 * 10\n1 = 6 * 10 - 3 * 23\n\nSo, the inverse of 10 mod 23 is 6.\n\nStep 2: Multiply the inverse by b mod P\nplaintext = (inverse * b) mod P = (6 * 18) mod 23 = 108 mod 23 = 16\n\nThe plaintext message is 16."
