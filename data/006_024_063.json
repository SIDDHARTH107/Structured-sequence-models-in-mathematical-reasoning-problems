    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, buses arriving on time) out of n trials (total number of buses)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, a bus being on time)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the number of buses)\n- k is the number of successes we want to find the probability for (in this case, 7 buses arriving on time)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 8 (total number of buses)\n- k = 7 (we want to find the probability of exactly 7 buses arriving on time)\n- p = 0.75 (probability of a bus being on time)\n\nFirst, let's find C(n, k) or C(8, 7). This is calculated as:\n\nC(8, 7) = 8! / (7! * (8-7)!)\nC(8, 7) = 8! / (7! * 1!)\nC(8, 7) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2) / (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2)\nC(8, 7) = 8\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 7) = C(8, 7) * p^7 * (1-p)^(8-7)\nP(X = 7) = 8 * (0.75)^7 * (1-0.75)^(8-7)\nP(X = 7) = 8 * (0.75)^7 * (0.25)^1\nP(X = 7) = 8 * 0.1335 * 0.25\nP(X = 7) â‰ˆ 0.267\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 7 out of 8 buses arrive on time is approximately 0.267 or 26.7%."
