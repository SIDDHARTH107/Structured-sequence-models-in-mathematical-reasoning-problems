    "message_2": "First, let's determine if $f(z)$ is analytic for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. A function is analytic if it is differentiable in a neighborhood of every point in its domain. Since $f(z)$ is a polynomial function, it is differentiable everywhere in the complex plane, and thus it is analytic for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nNow, let's find the power series representation of $f(z)$ centered at $z=2$. To do this, we will use the Taylor series formula:\n\n$$f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(n)}(2)}{n!}(z-2)^n$$\n\nwhere $f^{(n)}(2)$ denotes the $n$-th derivative of $f(z)$ evaluated at $z=2$. Let's compute the first few derivatives of $f(z)$:\n\n$f(z) = z^3 - 3z^2 + 5z - 7$\n\n$f'(z) = 3z^2 - 6z + 5$\n\n$f''(z) = 6z - 6$\n\n$f'''(z) = 6$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is a cubic polynomial, all higher-order derivatives will be zero. Now, let's evaluate the derivatives at $z=2$:\n\n$f(2) = 2^3 - 3(2)^2 + 5(2) - 7 = 8 - 12 + 10 - 7 = -1$\n\n$f'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 6(2) + 5 = 12 - 12 + 5 = 5$\n\n$f''(2) = 6(2) - 6 = 6$\n\n$f'''(2) = 6$\n\nNow, we can write the power series representation of $f(z)$ centered at $z=2$:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{-1}{0!}(z-2)^0 + \\frac{5}{1!}(z-2)^1 + \\frac{6}{2!}(z-2)^2 + \\frac{6}{3!}(z-2)^3$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$f(z) = -1 + 5(z-2) + 3(z-2)^2 + (z-2)^3$$\n\nSo, the power series representation of $f(z)$ centered at $z=2$ is:\n\n$$f(z) = (z-2)^3 + 3(z-2)^2 + 5(z-2) - 1$$"
