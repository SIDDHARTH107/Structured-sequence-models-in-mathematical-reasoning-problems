    "message_2": "To find the expected value of X at time t=1, we can use the property of the expected value of the stochastic differential equation. The given stochastic differential equation is:\n\ndX = 3X dt + 2X dW\n\nFirst, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\ndX/X = 3 dt + 2 dW\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides of the equation from 0 to t:\n\n∫(dX/X) = ∫(3 dt) + ∫(2 dW)\n\nTaking the integral, we get:\n\nln(X(t)/X(0)) = 3t + 2W(t)\n\nSince we want to find the expected value of X at time t=1, we can plug in t=1:\n\nln(X(1)/X(0)) = 3(1) + 2W(1)\n\nNow, we can exponentiate both sides:\n\nX(1)/X(0) = e^(3 + 2W(1))\n\nSince X(0) = 5, we have:\n\nX(1) = 5 * e^(3 + 2W(1))\n\nNow, we want to find the expected value of X(1). We can use the property that the expected value of the exponential of a standard Wiener process is:\n\nE[e^(aW(t))] = e^((a^2 * t)/2)\n\nIn our case, a = 2 and t = 1, so:\n\nE[e^(2W(1))] = e^((2^2 * 1)/2) = e^2\n\nNow, we can find the expected value of X(1):\n\nE[X(1)] = 5 * E[e^(3 + 2W(1))] = 5 * e^3 * E[e^(2W(1))] = 5 * e^3 * e^2 = 5 * e^5\n\nSo, the expected value of X at time t=1 is:\n\nE[X(1)] = 5 * e^5 ≈ 744.261"
