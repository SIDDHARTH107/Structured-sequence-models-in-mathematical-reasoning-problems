    "message_2": "To evaluate the Cauchy principal value integral, we will use complex analysis techniques, specifically contour integration. We will consider the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{(z - 1)(z + 2)}$ and integrate it over a contour that consists of two parts: a straight line segment from $-1$ to $1$ on the real axis, and a semicircle in the upper half-plane with radius $R$ centered at the origin, where $R > 3$. The contour integral is given by:\n\n$$\\oint_C f(z) \\, dz = \\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) \\, dx + \\int_{\\text{arc}} f(z) \\, dz$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ has simple poles at $z = 1$ and $z = -2$, we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the contour integral. The residue theorem states that for a function with isolated singularities inside a closed contour $C$:\n\n$$\\oint_C f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\sum_{k=1}^n \\text{Res}(f, z_k)$$\n\nwhere $\\text{Res}(f, z_k)$ is the residue of $f$ at the singularity $z_k$. In our case, only the pole at $z = -2$ is inside the contour, so we only need to find the residue at this point:\n\n$$\\text{Res}(f, -2) = \\lim_{z \\to -2} (z + 2) f(z) = \\lim_{z \\to -2} \\frac{1}{(z - 1)} = \\frac{1}{-3}$$\n\nNow, we can apply the residue theorem:\n\n$$\\oint_C f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}$$\n\nNext, we need to show that the integral over the semicircular arc goes to zero as $R \\to \\infty$. We can use the ML-inequality for this. The length of the arc is $L = \\pi R$, and we can bound the function $f(z)$ on the arc by:\n\n$$|f(z)| = \\left|\\frac{1}{(z - 1)(z + 2)}\\right| \\leq \\frac{1}{(R - 1)(R - 3)}$$\n\nThe ML-inequality states that:\n\n$$\\left|\\int_{\\text{arc}} f(z) \\, dz\\right| \\leq ML$$\n\nSubstituting our values, we get:\n\n$$\\left|\\int_{\\text{arc}} f(z) \\, dz\\right| \\leq \\frac{\\pi R}{(R - 1)(R - 3)}$$\n\nAs $R \\to \\infty$, the right-hand side goes to zero, so the integral over the arc goes to zero as well:\n\n$$\\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\int_{\\text{arc}} f(z) \\, dz = 0$$\n\nNow, we can find the Cauchy principal value integral:\n\n$$\\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{dx}{(x - 1)(x + 2)} = \\oint_C f(z) \\, dz - \\int_{\\text{arc}} f(z) \\, dz = -\\frac{2\\pi i}{3} - 0 = -\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}$$\n\nHowever, since the original integral is real-valued, the imaginary part should be zero. This means that the Cauchy principal value of the integral is actually zero:\n\n$$\\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{dx}{(x - 1)(x + 2)} = 0$$"
