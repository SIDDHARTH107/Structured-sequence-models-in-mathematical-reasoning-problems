    "message_2": "The smallest number of states a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) must have to accept the language given by the regular expression (a + b)*abb is 5 states.\n\nHere's an explanation:\n\n1. The initial state (q0) represents that no characters have been read yet. From this state, if an 'a' is read, the DFA moves to state q1, and if a 'b' is read, it stays in the initial state q0.\n2. State q1 represents that one 'a' has been read. From this state, if an 'a' is read, the DFA stays in state q1, and if a 'b' is read, it moves to state q2.\n3. State q2 represents that the substring \"ab\" has been read. From this state, if an 'a' is read, the DFA moves back to state q1, and if a 'b' is read, it moves to state q3.\n4. State q3 represents that the substring \"abb\" has been read. From this state, if an 'a' is read, the DFA moves to state q1, and if a 'b' is read, it stays in state q3.\n5. State q4 is the final state, which represents that the required substring \"abb\" has been read.\n\nSo, the smallest DFA for the given regular expression has 5 states."
