    "message_2": "We will show that any group G of order 9 must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C9, and therefore cannot be isomorphic to any non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nFirst, note that the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2). By the Sylow Theorems, we know that there exists a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P in G, which is normal in G. Since the order of P is 9, we have |P| = 9.\n\nNow, let's consider the elements of P. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in P must divide the order of P, which is 9. Thus, the possible orders of elements in P are 1, 3, and 9. Since there is only one identity element in a group, there must be at least one element of order 9 in P.\n\nLet g be an element of order 9 in P. Then, the subgroup generated by g, denoted as ⟨g⟩, has order 9. Since |⟨g⟩| = |P|, we have ⟨g⟩ = P. This means that P is a cyclic group generated by g, and since P is normal in G and has the same order as G, we have G = P.\n\nTherefore, G is a cyclic group of order 9, which is isomorphic to C9. This proves that any group of order 9 must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C9, and cannot be isomorphic to any non-abelian group of order 9."
