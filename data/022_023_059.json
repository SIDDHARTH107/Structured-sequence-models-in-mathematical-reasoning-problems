Let us also assume that $u(x,t)$ is periodic in $x$ with period $L$, that is, $u(x+L,t) = u(x,t)$ for all $x$ and $t$. Find the general solution of this equation in terms of Fourier series, that is, express $u(x,t)$ as a sum of complex exponentials of the form $\\exp(i(\\omega t - kx))$, where $\\omega$ and $k$ are real constants.",
    "message_2": "Since $u(x,t)$ is periodic in $x$ with period $L$, we can represent it as a Fourier series:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} A_n(t) e^{i\\frac{2\\pi nx}{L}},$$\n\nwhere $A_n(t)$ are complex-valued functions of time $t$. Now, we will substitute this Fourier series representation into the wave equation and find the time-dependent coefficients $A_n(t)$.\n\nTaking the second partial derivative with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} -\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n}{L}\\right)^2 A_n(t) e^{i\\frac{2\\pi nx}{L}}.$$\n\nTaking the second partial derivative with respect to $t$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{d^2 A_n(t)}{dt^2} e^{i\\frac{2\\pi nx}{L}}.$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the wave equation:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{d^2 A_n(t)}{dt^2} e^{i\\frac{2\\pi nx}{L}} = c^2 \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} -\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n}{L}\\right)^2 A_n(t) e^{i\\frac{2\\pi nx}{L}}.$$\n\nSince the complex exponentials form an orthogonal basis, we can equate the coefficients of each exponential term:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2 A_n(t)}{dt^2} = -c^2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi n}{L}\\right)^2 A_n(t).$$\n\nThis is a simple harmonic oscillator equation for each $A_n(t)$. The general solution for each $A_n(t)$ is:\n\n$$A_n(t) = C_n e^{i\\omega_n t} + D_n e^{-i\\omega_n t},$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_n = c\\frac{2\\pi n}{L}$, and $C_n$ and $D_n$ are complex constants. Substituting this back into the Fourier series representation of $u(x,t)$, we get:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(C_n e^{i\\omega_n t} + D_n e^{-i\\omega_n t}\\right) e^{i\\frac{2\\pi nx}{L}}.$$\n\nFinally, we can rewrite this as a sum of complex exponentials of the form $\\exp(i(\\omega t - kx))$:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(C_n e^{i(\\omega_n t - \\frac{2\\pi nx}{L})} + D_n e^{-i(\\omega_n t - \\frac{2\\pi nx}{L})}\\right).$$\n\nHere, $\\omega_n = c\\frac{2\\pi n}{L}$ and $k_n = \\frac{2\\pi n}{L}$ are the real constants, and $C_n$ and $D_n$ are complex constants determined by the initial conditions of the problem."
