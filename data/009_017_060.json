If $\\rho=0$ and the electric field strength $E$ is given by $E(x,y,0)=x^2-y^2$, $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial z}(x,y,0)=0$, find the value of $E$ at the point $(1,2,3)$.",
    "message_2": "Since $\\rho = 0$, the given differential equation becomes Laplace's equation:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial y^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial z^2}=0$$\n\nWe are given the boundary conditions $E(x, y, 0) = x^2 - y^2$ and $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial z}(x, y, 0) = 0$. To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $E(x, y, z) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)$. Substituting this into Laplace's equation, we get:\n\n$$X''(x)Y(y)Z(z) + X(x)Y''(y)Z(z) + X(x)Y(y)Z''(z) = 0$$\n\nDividing both sides by $XYZ$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} + \\frac{Z''(z)}{Z(z)} = 0$$\n\nNow, let's separate the variables:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} - \\frac{Z''(z)}{Z(z)} = k$$\n\nwhere $k$ is a separation constant. We now have three ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1. $X''(x) - kX(x) = 0$\n2. $Y''(y) + kY(y) = 0$\n3. $Z''(z) + kZ(z) = 0$\n\nThe general solutions for these equations are:\n\n1. $X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{k}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{k}x)$\n2. $Y(y) = C\\cos(\\sqrt{k}y) + D\\sin(\\sqrt{k}y)$\n3. $Z(z) = E\\cosh(\\sqrt{k}z) + F\\sinh(\\sqrt{k}z)$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n$$E(x, y, 0) = X(x)Y(y)Z(0) = x^2 - y^2$$\n\nSince $Z(0) = E\\cosh(0) + F\\sinh(0) = E$, we have:\n\n$$X(x)Y(y) = \\frac{x^2 - y^2}{E}$$\n\nWe also have:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial z}(x, y, 0) = X(x)Y(y)Z'(0) = 0$$\n\nSince $Z'(0) = E\\sinh(0) + F\\cosh(0) = F$, we have:\n\n$$X(x)Y(y) = 0$$\n\nThis is a contradiction, as $X(x)Y(y)$ cannot be both $\\frac{x^2 - y^2}{E}$ and $0$ at the same time. Therefore, the given boundary conditions are inconsistent with Laplace's equation, and there is no solution for $E(x, y, z)$ that satisfies both boundary conditions."
