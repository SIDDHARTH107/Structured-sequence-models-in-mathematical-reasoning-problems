Suppose that there exists a continuous map $f : X \\rightarrow S^1$ which induces an isomorphism on the first cohomology group with integer coefficients. What is the degree of this map $f$?",
    "message_2": "Since $f$ induces an isomorphism on the first cohomology group with integer coefficients, we have $f^*: H^1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is an isomorphism. We know that $H^1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by the fundamental class $[\\alpha]$ of the generator of the fundamental group of $S^1$. \n\nNow, let's consider the induced map $f^*$ on cohomology. Since $f^*$ is an isomorphism, there exists an integer $n$ such that $f^*([\\alpha]) = n \\cdot [x]$, where $[x]$ is the generator of $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$. \n\nThe degree of the map $f$ is defined as the integer $n$ such that $f^*([\\alpha]) = n \\cdot [x]$. In this case, we have $n \\cdot [x] \\in H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$. Since $[x]$ generates $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$, the integer $n$ must be coprime to 5. Thus, the degree of the map $f$ is an integer $n$ such that $\\gcd(n, 5) = 1$."
