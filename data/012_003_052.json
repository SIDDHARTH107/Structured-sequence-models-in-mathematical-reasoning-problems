    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of non-adjacent vertices that can be chosen from this graph such that no two chosen vertices are connected by an edge, we can use the concept of an independent set.\n\nAn independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. In this graph, we can choose the following independent sets:\n\n1. Vertices A, C, and E\n2. Vertices B, D, and F\n\nBoth of these independent sets have 3 vertices, and it is not possible to choose a larger independent set without violating the condition that no two chosen vertices are connected by an edge.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of non-adjacent vertices that can be chosen from this graph is 3."
