    "message_2": "In first-order logic, a model is a structure that satisfies all the sentences in a given theory. The first-order theory of natural numbers, also known as Peano Arithmetic, has a unique model up to isomorphism, which is the standard model of natural numbers (ℕ, 0, S).\n\nThe axioms of Peano Arithmetic are:\n\n1. 0 is a natural number.\n2. For every natural number x, S(x) is a natural number.\n3. For all natural numbers x and y, if S(x) = S(y), then x = y.\n4. For all natural numbers x, S(x) ≠ 0.\n5. Induction: If a set of natural numbers contains 0 and is closed under the successor function, then it contains all natural numbers.\n\nThe standard model of natural numbers (ℕ, 0, S) satisfies all these axioms. Since the axioms are first-order, by the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem, there are models of Peano Arithmetic of all infinite cardinalities. However, these non-standard models are elementarily equivalent to the standard model, meaning they satisfy the same first-order sentences, but they are not isomorphic to the standard model.\n\nSo, there are infinitely many models of the first-order theory of natural numbers, one for each infinite cardinality. However, they all share the same first-order properties, and there is only one model up to isomorphism, which is the standard model of natural numbers (ℕ, 0, S)."
