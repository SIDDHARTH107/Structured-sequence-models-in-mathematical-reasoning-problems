    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE), we can use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution $u(x, y)$ can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $y$. That is,\n\n$$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the PDE and divide both sides by $u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)Y(y) - X(x)Y''(y) + 4X'(x)Y(y)}{X(x)Y(y)} = 0$$\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $y$ to the other side:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x) + 4X'(x)}{X(x)} = \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $x$ and the right side depends only on $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $k$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x) + 4X'(x)}{X(x)} = \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = k$$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve:\n\n1. $X''(x) + 4X'(x) - kX(x) = 0$\n2. $Y''(y) + kY(y) = 0$\n\nLet's solve the first ODE:\n\n$$X''(x) + 4X'(x) - kX(x) = 0$$\n\nThis is a second-order linear ODE with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\n$$r^2 + 4r - k = 0$$\n\nDepending on the value of $k$, we have three cases:\n\nCase 1: $k > 4$\n\nIn this case, the characteristic equation has two distinct real roots, say $r_1$ and $r_2$. The general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = c_1 e^{r_1 x} + c_2 e^{r_2 x}$$\n\nCase 2: $k = 4$\n\nIn this case, the characteristic equation has a repeated real root, say $r_0$. The general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = (c_1 + c_2 x) e^{r_0 x}$$\n\nCase 3: $k < 4$\n\nIn this case, the characteristic equation has two complex conjugate roots, say $r_1 = a + bi$ and $r_2 = a - bi$. The general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = e^{ax}(c_1 \\cos(bx) + c_2 \\sin(bx))$$\n\nNow, let's solve the second ODE:\n\n$$Y''(y) + kY(y) = 0$$\n\nThis is a second-order linear ODE with constant coefficients. The general solution for $Y(y)$ is:\n\n$$Y(y) = c_3 \\cos(\\sqrt{k}y) + c_4 \\sin(\\sqrt{k}y)$$\n\nFinally, we can write the general solution for the PDE by combining the solutions for $X(x)$ and $Y(y)$:\n\n$$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$$\n\nDepending on the value of $k$, the general solution will have different forms. However, the general idea is that the solution will be a linear combination of products of functions of $x$ and $y$. The coefficients $c_1, c_2, c_3,$ and $c_4$ can be determined by boundary conditions or initial conditions, if provided."
