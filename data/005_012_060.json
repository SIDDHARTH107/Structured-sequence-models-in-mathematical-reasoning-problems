    "message_1": "A drug manufacturer claims that the mean lifespan of their pill is 60 days with a standard deviation of 3 days. A sample of 25 pills is randomly selected. What is the probability that the sample mean lifespan is greater than 62 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the z-score formula for sample means:\n\nz = (X̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n\nwhere X̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, we have:\nμ = 60 days (the mean lifespan of the pill)\nσ = 3 days (the standard deviation of the pill's lifespan)\nn = 25 (the sample size)\nX̄ = 62 days (the sample mean we want to find the probability for)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the z-score formula:\n\nz = (62 - 60) / (3 / √25)\nz = 2 / (3 / 5)\nz = 2 / 0.6\nz ≈ 3.33\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find the probability that the sample mean lifespan is greater than 62 days. \n\nLooking up a z-score of 3.33 in a z-table, we find that the area to the left of this z-score is approximately 0.9996. Since we want the probability that the sample mean lifespan is greater than 62 days, we need to find the area to the right of the z-score:\n\nP(X̄ > 62) = 1 - P(X̄ ≤ 62)\nP(X̄ > 62) = 1 - 0.9996\nP(X̄ > 62) ≈ 0.0004\n\nSo, the probability that the sample mean lifespan is greater than 62 days is approximately 0.0004 or 0.04%."
