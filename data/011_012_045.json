    "message_2": "To find out how many students don't like either music or art, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal number of students liking music or art = (Number of students liking music) + (Number of students liking art) - (Number of students liking both music and art)\n\nTotal number of students liking music or art = 10 + 12 - 8 = 14\n\nNow, we can find out the number of students who don't like either music or art by subtracting the number of students who like music or art from the total number of students in the class.\n\nNumber of students who don't like either music or art = (Total number of students) - (Total number of students liking music or art)\n\nNumber of students who don't like either music or art = 25 - 14 = 11\n\nSo, 11 students don't like either music or art."
