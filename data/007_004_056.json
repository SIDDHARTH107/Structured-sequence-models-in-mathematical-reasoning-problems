    "message_2": "The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 128 and 144 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (144) by the smaller number (128) and find the remainder.\n   144 รท 128 = 1 with a remainder of 16.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (144) with the smaller number (128) and the smaller number with the remainder (16).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 128 and 16.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (128) by the smaller number (16) and find the remainder.\n   128 รท 16 = 8 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD of 128 and 144 is the smaller number in the last step, which is 16."
