    "message_2": "A Morse function is a smooth function that has non-degenerate critical points, meaning that the Hessian matrix (the matrix of second partial derivatives) is non-singular at each critical point. The index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at that point.\n\nMorse theory states that the number of critical points of index k is equal to the k-th Betti number of the underlying manifold. In this case, the manifold is $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which has Betti numbers $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 0$, and $b_2 = 0$.\n\nSince we are given that there are critical points at $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$ with index $0$ and index $1$, respectively, we can see that the Morse function already accounts for the non-zero Betti numbers $b_0$ and $b_1$. Therefore, the number of critical points of $f$ that have index $2$ is equal to the second Betti number, which is $b_2 = 0$. So, there are no critical points of index $2$."
