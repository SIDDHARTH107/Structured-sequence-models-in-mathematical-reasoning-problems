    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 2, we need to find the points where the second derivative of the function changes its sign.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x + 2) = 3x^2 - 3\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 3) = 6x\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to find the values of x for which f''(x) = 0:\n\n6x = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo, there is one inflection point at x = 0. To find the corresponding y-coordinate, plug this value of x back into the original function f(x):\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 3(0) + 2 = 2\n\nThus, the inflection point of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 2 is at (0, 2)."
