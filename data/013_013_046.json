    "message_1": "Suppose there are three bidders participating in an auction for an antique vase. The valuations for the vase by each bidder are as follows: \n\nBidder 1: $400 \nBidder 2: $500 \nBidder 3: $600 \n\nAssuming each bidder has private valuations (i.e. they only know their own valuation and not those of the other bidders), what would be the optimal bidding strategy for each bidder if the auction follows a second-price sealed-bid format (i.e. the highest bidder wins but pays the second highest bid)?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the optimal strategy for each bidder is to bid their true valuation. This is because they will never pay more than their valuation, and bidding their true valuation maximizes their chances of winning when it is profitable to do so.\n\nSo, the optimal bidding strategy for each bidder would be:\n\nBidder 1: Bid $400\nBidder 2: Bid $500\nBidder 3: Bid $600\n\nIn this scenario, Bidder 3 would win the auction and pay the second-highest bid, which is $500."
