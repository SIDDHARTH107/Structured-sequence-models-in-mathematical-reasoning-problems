    "message_2": "The power set of a set A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. The size of the power set of A is given by the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in A.\n\nIn this case, the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} has 4 elements. Therefore, the size of the power set P(A) is 2^4 = 16.\n\nNow, let's compare the size of the power set P(A) with the size of set A itself:\n\nSize of A = 4\nSize of P(A) = 16\n\nSince 16 > 4, the size of the power set P(A) is larger than the size of set A.\n\nProof:\n\nLet's consider a more general case. For any set A with n elements, the size of the power set P(A) is 2^n. Since n ≥ 0, we have 2^n ≥ 2^0 = 1. Thus, the size of the power set is always greater than or equal to 1.\n\nNow, let's prove that the size of the power set is always greater than the size of the set A for any n > 0:\n\nSize of A = n\nSize of P(A) = 2^n\n\nWe want to show that 2^n > n for any n > 0.\n\nFor n = 1, we have 2^1 = 2 > 1, which is true.\n\nAssume that the inequality 2^k > k holds for some k ≥ 1. Now, we want to show that 2^(k+1) > (k+1):\n\n2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k > 2 * k (since 2^k > k by our assumption)\n2 * k > k + 1 (since k ≥ 1)\n\nThus, 2^(k+1) > k + 1, and by induction, the inequality 2^n > n holds for all n > 0.\n\nTherefore, the size of the power set P(A) is always larger than the size of set A for any set A with n > 0 elements."
