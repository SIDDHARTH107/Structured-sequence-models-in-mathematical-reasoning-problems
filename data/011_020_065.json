    "message_1": "A factory produces three types of products: A, B, and C. The production times (in minutes) for one unit of each product are as follows:\n\n- A: 5 minutes\n- B: 8 minutes\n- C: 12 minutes\n\nThe factory has 30 minutes available for production. What is the maximum number of each type of product that can be produced in this time?",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z represent the number of units produced for products A, B, and C, respectively. We have the following equation for the total production time:\n\n5x + 8y + 12z ≤ 30\n\nWe want to find the maximum number of each type of product that can be produced in 30 minutes. To do this, we'll consider each product separately and find the maximum number of units that can be produced for each product within the given time constraint.\n\nFor product A:\n5x ≤ 30\nx ≤ 6\n\nSo, the maximum number of units of product A that can be produced is 6.\n\nFor product B:\n8y ≤ 30\ny ≤ 3.75\n\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a product, the maximum number of units of product B that can be produced is 3.\n\nFor product C:\n12z ≤ 30\nz ≤ 2.5\n\nSimilarly, the maximum number of units of product C that can be produced is 2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of each type of product that can be produced in 30 minutes is:\n- Product A: 6 units\n- Product B: 3 units\n- Product C: 2 units"
