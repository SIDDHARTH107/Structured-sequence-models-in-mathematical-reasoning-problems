    "message_2": "To find the maximum or minimum value of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, we can use the vertex formula: x = -b / 2a. In this case, a = 2, b = -8, and c = 7.\n\nx = -(-8) / 2(2)\nx = 8 / 4\nx = 2\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can plug it back into the equation to find the corresponding y-coordinate:\n\ny = 2(2)^2 - 8(2) + 7\ny = 2(4) - 16 + 7\ny = 8 - 16 + 7\ny = -1\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation is (2, -1). Since the coefficient of the x^2 term (a) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, meaning that the vertex represents the minimum value of the equation.\n\nThus, the minimum value of the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 - 8x + 7 is -1, and it occurs at x = 2."
