    "message_2": "Kuratowski's theorem states that a finite graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to K5 (complete graph on 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on 3+3 vertices).\n\nIn order to determine if graph G is planar or not, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs, which states that for any connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nGiven that G has 10 vertices (V = 10) and 15 edges (E = 15), we can try to find the maximum number of faces (F) that G can have if it were planar.\n\nAccording to the inequality derived from Euler's formula for simple connected planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for G:\n\n15 ≤ 3(10) - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nSince the inequality holds, it is possible that G is planar. However, we still need to check for the presence of a subgraph homeomorphic to K5 or K3,3.\n\nFor a graph to have a subgraph homeomorphic to K5, it must have at least 5 vertices with a degree of 4 or more. In G, since there are only 15 edges, the maximum degree sum is 2 * 15 = 30. It is impossible to have 5 vertices with a degree of 4 or more, as that would require a degree sum of at least 5 * 4 = 20, leaving only 10 for the remaining 5 vertices, which would result in fractional degrees. Therefore, G cannot contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K5.\n\nFor a graph to have a subgraph homeomorphic to K3,3, it must have at least 6 vertices with a degree of 3 or more. In G, since there are only 15 edges, the maximum degree sum is 2 * 15 = 30. It is possible to have 6 vertices with a degree of 3, as that would require a degree sum of 6 * 3 = 18, leaving 12 for the remaining 4 vertices, which is possible (e.g., 3 vertices with degree 3 and 1 vertex with degree 6). However, this doesn't guarantee the presence of a K3,3 subgraph.\n\nTo further analyze the possibility of a K3,3 subgraph, we can use the inequality derived from Euler's formula for bipartite planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 2V - 4\n\nIf G contains a K3,3 subgraph, then it must have at least 6 vertices and 9 edges. Plugging in these values:\n\n9 ≤ 2(6) - 4\n9 ≤ 12 - 4\n9 ≤ 8\n\nThe inequality does not hold, which means G cannot contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K3,3.\n\nSince G does not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K5 or K3,3, and the inequality derived from Euler's formula holds, we can conclude that G is a planar graph."
