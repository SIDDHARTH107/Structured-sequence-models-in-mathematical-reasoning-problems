    "message_1": "A sample of radioactive materials has an initial mass of 500 grams and a half-life of 50 years. Write an equation to represent the decay of the material, and determine how much of the material remains after 100 years.",
    "message_2": "To represent the decay of the radioactive material, we can use the exponential decay formula:\n\nM(t) = M₀ * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere:\n- M(t) is the mass of the material remaining after time t\n- M₀ is the initial mass of the material (500 grams in this case)\n- t is the time elapsed (in years)\n- T is the half-life of the material (50 years in this case)\n\nSo the equation representing the decay of the material is:\n\nM(t) = 500 * (1/2)^(t/50)\n\nNow, we want to find the mass of the material remaining after 100 years. We can plug t = 100 into the equation:\n\nM(100) = 500 * (1/2)^(100/50)\n\nM(100) = 500 * (1/2)^2\n\nM(100) = 500 * (1/4)\n\nM(100) = 125 grams\n\nAfter 100 years, 125 grams of the radioactive material remains."
