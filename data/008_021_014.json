    "message_2": "First, let's identify that this is a singular matrix. We can do this by calculating the determinant of the matrix formed by the coefficients of the variables.\n\nThe matrix A is:\n\n```\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 2  4 -2 |\n    | 3  6 -3 |\n```\n\nThe determinant of A is:\n\n```\ndet(A) = 1*(4*(-3) - (-2)*6) - 2*(2*(-3) - (-2)*3) + (-1)*(2*6 - 4*3)\n       = 1*(-12 + 12) - 2*(-6 + 6) + (-1)*(12 - 12)\n       = 0\n```\n\nSince the determinant of A is 0, the matrix is singular, and the system of linear equations does not have a unique solution.\n\nNow, let's analyze the system of equations to determine if there is no solution or infinitely many solutions.\n\nWe can start by simplifying the second and third equations:\n\nDivide the second equation by 2:\n\n$x + 2y - z = 1$\n\nDivide the third equation by 3:\n\n$x + 2y - z = 1$\n\nNow, we can see that all three equations are the same:\n\n$x + 2y - z = 1$\n\n$x + 2y - z = 1$\n\n$x + 2y - z = 1$\n\nSince all three equations are the same, they represent the same plane in three-dimensional space. Therefore, the system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo express the solutions, we can solve for one of the variables in terms of the others. For example, we can solve for z:\n\n$z = x + 2y - 1$\n\nSo, the solutions to the system of linear equations can be expressed as:\n\n$(x, y, x + 2y - 1)$, where x and y can be any real numbers."
