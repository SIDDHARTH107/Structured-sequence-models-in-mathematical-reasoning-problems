    "message_1": "In a company, there is a 5% chance that a financial fraud will occur in any given year. If the company has been in business for 10 years, what is the probability that at least one financial fraud will occur during that 10-year period?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability concept. Instead of finding the probability of at least one financial fraud occurring, we can find the probability of no financial fraud occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no financial fraud occurring in a given year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor no financial fraud to occur in a 10-year period, this probability must hold true for all 10 years. So, we have:\n\n0.95^10 ≈ 0.5987\n\nNow, we find the complementary probability, which is the probability of at least one financial fraud occurring:\n\n1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013\n\nSo, the probability of at least one financial fraud occurring during the 10-year period is approximately 40.13%."
