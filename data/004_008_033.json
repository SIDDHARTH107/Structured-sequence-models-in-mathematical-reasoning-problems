    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 4, we need to find the derivative of the given function and then evaluate it at x = 4.\n\nThe given function is y = x^2 - 3x + 2.\n\nFirst, find the derivative of the function with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = d(x^2 - 3x + 2)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule and the linearity of the derivative, we get:\n\ndy/dx = 2x - 3\n\nNow, evaluate the derivative at x = 4:\n\ndy/dx(4) = 2(4) - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where x = 4 is 5."
