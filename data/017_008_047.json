    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4, we will first analyze the possible structures of G, and then show that these structures correspond to one of the three groups mentioned.\n\nSince G has order 8, by the Sylow theorems, there must be a subgroup of order 4, say H. Let's analyze the possible structures of H.\n\nCase 1: H is cyclic\nIf H is cyclic, then it is generated by an element of order 4, say a. Then, G has elements {e, a, a^2, a^3, b, ba, ba^2, ba^3}, where e is the identity element and b is an element not in H. Note that b^2 must be in H, since otherwise, we would have more than 8 elements in G.\n\nNow, b^2 can be either a^2 or a^3. If b^2 = a^2, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4, as the elements and relations match those of D4. If b^2 = a^3, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C8, as the elements and relations match those of C8.\n\nCase 2: H is not cyclic\nIf H is not cyclic, then it must be isomorphic to the Klein four-group, V4, since it has order 4. In this case, H = {e, a, b, c}, where a, b, and c are elements of order 2. Let d be an element in G but not in H. Then, G has elements {e, a, b, c, d, da, db, dc}.\n\nSince |G| = 8, d^2 must be in H. Without loss of generality, let d^2 = a. Now, consider the element (db)^2. We have (db)^2 = dbdb = d(bd)b, and since d^2 = a, we have d(bd)b = ab. Thus, bd = adb. Since a has order 2, we can multiply both sides by a to get b = ad. This implies that dc = d(da) = d^2a = a^2 = e. So, d has order 4.\n\nNow, we can see that G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8, as the elements and relations match those of Q8.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, or the dihedral group D4, depending on the structure of the subgroup H and the relations between the elements of G."
