    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the non-periodic function f(t) = sin(2t) + cos(4t) for the interval t ∈ [0, 2π], we will first express the function as a Fourier series. The Fourier series of a function f(t) on the interval [0, L] is given by:\n\nf(t) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nωt) + b_n * sin(nωt)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π/L, a_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(t) dt] from 0 to L, a_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(t) * cos(nωt) dt] from 0 to L, and b_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(t) * sin(nωt) dt] from 0 to L.\n\nIn our case, f(t) = sin(2t) + cos(4t) and the interval is [0, 2π], so L = 2π. Therefore, ω = 2π/(2π) = 1.\n\nNow, let's calculate the Fourier coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n.\n\n1. a_0:\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * ∫[sin(2t) + cos(4t) dt] from 0 to 2π\n\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * [(-1/2)cos(2t) + (1/4)sin(4t)] from 0 to 2π\n\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * [(0 - (-1/2)) + (0 - 0)] = 1/4\n\n2. a_n:\na_n = (2/(2π)) * ∫[(sin(2t) + cos(4t)) * cos(nt) dt] from 0 to 2π\n\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/2) * (sin(2t) * cos(nt) - n * ∫[cos(2t) * sin(nt) dt]) + (1/4) * (sin(4t) * cos(nt) - n * ∫[sin(4t) * sin(nt) dt])] from 0 to 2π\n\nFor n ≠ 2 and n ≠ 4, the integrals will be zero due to the orthogonality of the trigonometric functions. Therefore, a_n = 0 for n ≠ 2 and n ≠ 4.\n\nFor n = 2, we have:\n\na_2 = (1/π) * [(1/2) * (sin(4t) - 2 * ∫[cos(4t) * sin(2t) dt]) + (1/4) * (sin(8t) - 2 * ∫[sin(8t) * sin(2t) dt])] from 0 to 2π\n\nAgain, due to orthogonality, the integrals will be zero, and we get:\n\na_2 = (1/π) * [0] = 0\n\nFor n = 4, we have:\n\na_4 = (1/π) * [(1/2) * (sin(8t) - 4 * ∫[cos(8t) * sin(4t) dt]) + (1/4) * (sin(16t) - 4 * ∫[sin(16t) * sin(4t) dt])] from 0 to 2π\n\nAgain, due to orthogonality, the integrals will be zero, and we get:\n\na_4 = (1/π) * [0] = 0\n\n3. b_n:\nb_n = (2/(2π)) * ∫[(sin(2t) + cos(4t)) * sin(nt) dt] from 0 to 2π\n\nIntegrating by parts, we get:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/2) * (cos(2t) * sin(nt) + n * ∫[cos(2t) * cos(nt) dt]) - (1/4) * (cos(4t) * sin(nt) + n * ∫[cos(4t) * cos(nt) dt])] from 0 to 2π\n\nFor n ≠ 2 and n ≠ 4, the integrals will be zero due to the orthogonality of the trigonometric functions. Therefore, b_n = 0 for n ≠ 2 and n ≠ 4.\n\nFor n = 2, we have:\n\nb_2 = (1/π) * [(-1/2) * (cos(4t) + 2 * ∫[cos(4t) * cos(2t) dt]) - (1/4) * (cos(8t) + 2 * ∫[cos(8t) * cos(2t) dt])] from 0 to 2π\n\nAgain, due to orthogonality, the integrals will be zero, and we get:\n\nb_2 = (1/π) * [(-1/2) * (1 - 1)] = 0\n\nFor n = 4, we have:\n\nb_4 = (1/π) * [(-1/2) * (cos(8t) + 4 * ∫[cos(8t) * cos(4t) dt]) - (1/4) * (cos(16t) + 4 * ∫[cos(16t) * cos(4t) dt])] from 0 to 2π\n\nAgain, due to orthogonality, the integrals will be zero, and we get:\n\nb_4 = (1/π) * [(-1/2) * (1 - 1)] = 0\n\nSo, the Fourier coefficients are a_0 = 1/4, a_n = 0, and b_n = 0 for all n.\n\nThe Fourier series representation of the function f(t) = sin(2t) + cos(4t) on the interval [0, 2π] is:\n\nf(t) = 1/4"
