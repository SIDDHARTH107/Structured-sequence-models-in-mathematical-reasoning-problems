    "message_1": "In a Trust Game, player A is given $10 and can choose to keep some or all of it. Player A's remaining balance is then tripled and given to player B. Player B can then choose to keep some or all of the money received from player A. What is the maximum amount of money that player A can keep and player B still receives at least $15?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount of money player A keeps, and let y be the amount of money player A gives to player B. We know that x + y = $10, since player A starts with $10. We also know that player B receives 3y, as player A's remaining balance is tripled and given to player B.\n\nWe want to find the maximum value of x such that 3y ≥ $15.\n\nFirst, we can solve the equation x + y = $10 for y:\n\ny = $10 - x\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for y into the inequality 3y ≥ $15:\n\n3($10 - x) ≥ $15\n\nExpanding and simplifying the inequality, we get:\n\n$30 - 3x ≥ $15\n\nSubtracting $30 from both sides, we have:\n\n-3x ≥ -$15\n\nDividing both sides by -3 (and remembering to flip the inequality sign since we're dividing by a negative number):\n\nx ≤ $5\n\nSo, the maximum amount of money that player A can keep is $5, while player B still receives at least $15."
