    "message_2": "To find the acute angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors. The dot product formula is:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere A and B are the vectors, |A| and |B| are their magnitudes, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the two vectors:\n\nA · B = (4 * 1) + (2 * 6) = 4 + 12 = 16\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n|A| = √(4^2 + 2^2) = √(16 + 4) = √20\n\n|B| = √(1^2 + 6^2) = √(1 + 36) = √37\n\nNow, we can use the dot product formula to find the cosine of the angle between the vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|) = 16 / (√20 * √37) = 16 / (√740)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nθ = arccos(16 / √740)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nθ ≈ 0.920 radians or 52.76 degrees\n\nSo, the acute angle between vector A and vector B is approximately 52.76 degrees."
