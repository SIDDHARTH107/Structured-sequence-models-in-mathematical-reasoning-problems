    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between nodes A and C using Dijkstra's algorithm, we need the weights of the edges. Assuming all edges have equal weight (1), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes: {A, B, C, D}\n2. Assign tentative distances to all nodes: A (0), B (∞), C (∞), D (∞)\n3. Set the current node as A (since it has the smallest tentative distance)\n\nNow, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the tentative distance for each neighboring unvisited node by adding the current node's tentative distance and the edge weight.\n   - For B: 0 (A's distance) + 1 (edge weight) = 1\n   - For D: 0 (A's distance) + 1 (edge weight) = 1\n2. Update the tentative distances if the calculated distance is less than the current tentative distance.\n   - B's tentative distance is updated to 1\n   - D's tentative distance is updated to 1\n3. Mark the current node (A) as visited and remove it from the unvisited set: {B, C, D}\n\nNow, we'll repeat the steps for the next unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance (B or D, we can choose either; let's choose B):\n\n1. Calculate the tentative distance for each neighboring unvisited node.\n   - For C: 1 (B's distance) + 1 (edge weight) = 2\n   - For D: 1 (B's distance) + 1 (edge weight) = 2\n2. Update the tentative distances if the calculated distance is less than the current tentative distance.\n   - C's tentative distance is updated to 2\n   - D's tentative distance is not updated, as 2 is not less than the current distance (1)\n3. Mark the current node (B) as visited and remove it from the unvisited set: {C, D}\n\nNow, we'll repeat the steps for the next unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance (D):\n\n1. Calculate the tentative distance for each neighboring unvisited node.\n   - For C: 1 (D's distance) + 1 (edge weight) = 2\n2. Update the tentative distances if the calculated distance is less than the current tentative distance.\n   - C's tentative distance is not updated, as 2 is not less than the current distance (2)\n3. Mark the current node (D) as visited and remove it from the unvisited set: {C}\n\nFinally, the only remaining unvisited node is C, which is our destination. The shortest path from A to C is A -> B -> C or A -> D -> C, both with a total weight of 2."
