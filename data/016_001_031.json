Its Hausdorff dimension can be found using a formula involving logarithms and the number of iterations used in constructing the fractal.",
    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle can be found using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski triangle, there are 3 self-similar pieces (the three smaller triangles that make up the larger triangle), and the scaling factor is 2 (each side of the smaller triangles is half the length of the larger triangle's side).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2) â‰ˆ 1.5849625\n\nThe exact Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is log(3) / log(2)."
