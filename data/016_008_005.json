    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, after each iteration, each line segment is divided into 4 segments, so N = 4. The scaling factor is 1/3, as each new segment is 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension remains the same after any number of iterations, so after three iterations, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is still approximately 1.2619."
