    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the stock price change, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the value of that outcome and then sum the results.\n\nExpected value = (probability of decrease * decrease amount) + (probability of increase * increase amount)\n\nExpected value = (0.40 * -$10) + (0.60 * $20)\n\nExpected value = (-$4) + ($12)\n\nExpected value = $8\n\nThe expected value of the stock price change is $8."
