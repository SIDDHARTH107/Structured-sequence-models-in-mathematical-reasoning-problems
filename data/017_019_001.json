    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36, we will use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible structures of G.\n\nSince the order of G is 36 = 2^2 * 3^2, by the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, divides 9 and is congruent to 1 mod 2, so n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, divides 4 and is congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. The intersection of P_2 and P_3 is trivial, so G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3. Since P_2 is of order 4, it is isomorphic to either C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). P_3 is of order 9, so it is isomorphic to C9. Thus, G is isomorphic to either C4 × C9 or V4 × C9. The first one is the cyclic group C36, and the second one is one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9, which is normal in G. Let P_2 be one of the 2-Sylow subgroups of order 4. Since the normalizer of P_2 has index 3 in G, it must contain P_3. Thus, G has a subgroup H of order 12 containing P_2 and P_3. The group H is isomorphic to either A4 or C3 × C4. If H is isomorphic to A4, then G is isomorphic to A4 × C3, which is one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36. If H is isomorphic to C3 × C4, then G is isomorphic to one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4, which is normal in G. Let P_3 be one of the 3-Sylow subgroups of order 9. Since the normalizer of P_3 has index 2 in G, it must contain P_2. Thus, G has a subgroup H of order 18 containing P_2 and P_3. The group H is isomorphic to either C6 × C3 or C9 × C2. In both cases, G is isomorphic to one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are no normal Sylow subgroups in G. However, we can still analyze the structure of G using the Sylow theorems and find that G is isomorphic to one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36. The elements of each group of order 36 that satisfy this property are the elements of the respective groups."
