    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player 1 has $20 and can choose to send any amount between $0 and $20 to Player 2. The amount sent is then tripled, and Player 2 can choose to send back any amount between $0 and the tripled amount to Player 1. What is the optimal amount for Player 1 to send to maximize their payoff, assuming Player 2 will reciprocate with a fairness motive?",
    "message_2": "Assuming Player 2 has a fairness motive, they will likely aim to split the tripled amount equally between themselves and Player 1. To maximize their payoff, Player 1 should send an amount that, when tripled and split equally, results in the highest possible return.\n\nLet x be the amount Player 1 sends to Player 2. The tripled amount is 3x, and if Player 2 splits it equally, they will send back 1.5x to Player 1. Player 1's total payoff will be the initial $20 minus the amount sent (x) plus the amount received back (1.5x), which can be represented as:\n\nPayoff = 20 - x + 1.5x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nPayoff = 20 + 0.5x\n\nTo maximize the payoff, Player 1 should send the full $20 to Player 2. In this case, the tripled amount is $60, and if Player 2 splits it equally, they will send back $30 to Player 1. The total payoff for Player 1 will be:\n\nPayoff = 20 - 20 + 1.5(20) = 30\n\nSo, the optimal amount for Player 1 to send to maximize their payoff, assuming Player 2 will reciprocate with a fairness motive, is $20."
