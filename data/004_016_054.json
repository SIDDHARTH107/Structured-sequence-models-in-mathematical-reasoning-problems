    "message_2": "To find the time at which the ball reaches a height of 50 meters, we can use the following kinematic equation:\n\nh(t) = h0 + v0*t + 0.5*a*t^2\n\nwhere h(t) is the height at time t, h0 is the initial height (10 meters), v0 is the initial velocity (20 m/s), a is the acceleration due to gravity (-9.8 m/s^2), and t is the time.\n\nWe want to find the time t when the height h(t) is 50 meters. So, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n50 = 10 + 20*t - 4.9*t^2\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation for t. First, let's simplify the equation:\n\n0 = -4.9*t^2 + 20*t - 40\n\nTo solve the quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nt = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = -4.9, b = 20, and c = -40. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nt = (-20 ± √(20^2 - 4*(-4.9)*(-40))) / (2*(-4.9))\n\nt = (-20 ± √(400 - 784)) / (-9.8)\n\nt = (-20 ± √(-384)) / (-9.8)\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for t. This means that the ball will never reach a height of 50 meters under the given conditions."
