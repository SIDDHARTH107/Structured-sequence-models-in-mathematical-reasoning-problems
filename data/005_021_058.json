    "message_2": "To find a 95% confidence interval for the median score using bootstrapping, follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort the original data in ascending order:\n44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92\n\n2. Calculate the median of the original data:\nSince there are 50 data points, the median is the average of the 25th and 26th values: (70 + 71) / 2 = 70.5\n\n3. Perform bootstrap resampling:\na. Randomly select 50 scores from the original data with replacement (meaning a score can be selected more than once).\nb. Calculate the median of the resampled data.\nc. Repeat this process a large number of times (e.g., 1000 or more) to create a distribution of medians.\n\n4. Calculate the 95% confidence interval from the bootstrap distribution of medians:\na. Find the 2.5th percentile (lower bound) and the 97.5th percentile (upper bound) of the bootstrap medians.\nb. This range represents the 95% confidence interval for the median score.\n\nNote: Since bootstrapping is a random process, the confidence interval may vary slightly each time it's calculated. However, the general range should be consistent."
