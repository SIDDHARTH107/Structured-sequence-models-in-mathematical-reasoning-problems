    "message_1": "Here is a probability distribution problem for you to solve:\n\nSuppose the average weight of a box of cereal is 16 ounces with a standard deviation of 0.5 ounces. If a random sample of 25 boxes of cereal is taken, what is the probability that the average weight of the sample is less than 15.8 ounces?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean. The standard error is the standard deviation of the sample mean and is calculated as:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, σ = 0.5 ounces and n = 25.\n\nSE = 0.5 / √25\nSE = 0.5 / 5\nSE = 0.1 ounces\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 15.8 ounces. The z-score is the number of standard errors a particular value is from the population mean (μ). It is calculated as:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, and SE is the standard error.\n\nIn this case, x̄ = 15.8 ounces and μ = 16 ounces.\n\nz = (15.8 - 16) / 0.1\nz = -0.2 / 0.1\nz = -2\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -2. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find this probability.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score being less than -2 is approximately 0.0228 or 2.28%.\n\nSo, there is a 2.28% chance that the average weight of a random sample of 25 boxes of cereal is less than 15.8 ounces."
