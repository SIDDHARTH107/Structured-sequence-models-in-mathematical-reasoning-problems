    "message_1": "A company produces two products, Product A and Product B. The company has a production capacity of 200 units per day. The profits on each unit of Product A and Product B are $10 and $15, respectively. Due to the high uncertainty in the market, the company can only estimate the demand for the next day. The expected demand for Product A and Product B are 150 and 100 units, respectively. However, the actual demand can vary and follows a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation of 10 and 5 units for Product A, and 8 and 3 units for Product B. \n\nAssuming the company wants to maximize its expected profit, how many units of each product should they produce to meet the expected demand as much as possible and maximize the expected profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced and y be the number of units of Product B produced. The company's production constraint is:\n\nx + y â‰¤ 200\n\nThe expected profit function is:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nSince the company wants to maximize its expected profit, we need to find the optimal values of x and y that satisfy the production constraint and maximize the profit function.\n\nFirst, let's consider the expected demand for each product. The expected demand for Product A is 150 units, and the expected demand for Product B is 100 units. If the company produces exactly the expected demand, it would produce 150 units of Product A and 100 units of Product B. However, this would exceed the production capacity of 200 units per day.\n\nTo maximize the expected profit, the company should prioritize producing more units of the product with the higher profit margin, which is Product B. Therefore, the company should produce as many units of Product B as possible without exceeding the production capacity.\n\nLet's assume the company produces the maximum possible units of Product B, which is 100 units. This leaves a production capacity of 100 units for Product A. Since the expected demand for Product A is 150 units, producing 100 units of Product A would not meet the expected demand completely.\n\nHowever, given the production constraint, this is the best the company can do to maximize its expected profit. So, the company should produce 100 units of Product A and 100 units of Product B to maximize its expected profit.\n\nThe expected profit in this case would be:\n\nProfit = 10(100) + 15(100) = 1000 + 1500 = $2500"
