    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation y = x² - 4x + 3, we first need to find the roots (x-intercepts) of the equation. We can do this by setting y = 0 and solving for x:\n\n0 = x² - 4x + 3\n\nWe can solve this equation by factoring or by using the quadratic formula. In this case, let's use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 1, b = -4, and c = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)² - 4(1)(3))) / 2(1)\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 12)) / 2\nx = (4 ± √4) / 2\nx = (4 ± 2) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (4 + 2) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\nx = (4 - 2) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1\n\nSo, the roots (x-intercepts) of the equation are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nNow let's find the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 1 and b = -4, so:\n\nx = -(-4) / 2(1) = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nNow, we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate back into the original equation:\n\ny = (2)² - 4(2) + 3 = 4 - 8 + 3 = -1\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (2, -1).\n\nNow we have enough information to graph the equation on the coordinate plane:\n\n1. Plot the vertex at the point (2, -1).\n2. Plot the x-intercepts at the points (1, 0) and (3, 0).\n3. Since the coefficient of the x² term is positive, the parabola opens upwards.\n4. Draw a smooth curve through the vertex and x-intercepts to complete the graph of the equation y = x² - 4x + 3.\n\nHere's a link to the graph of the equation: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/5zvqfjxk9d"
