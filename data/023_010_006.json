    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Apply the 2D Fourier transform to the grayscale image.\n2. Obtain the magnitude and phase spectra.\n3. Apply a low-pass filter by setting frequency components outside a radius of 100 pixels to zero.\n4. Reconstruct the filtered image using the inverse Fourier transform.\n5. Compute the mean squared error between the original and reconstructed images.\n\nLet's assume we have a grayscale image `I` of size 512 x 512.\n\nStep 1: Apply the 2D Fourier transform\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.fftpack import fft2, ifft2, fftshift, ifftshift\n\nF = fft2(I)\n```\n\nStep 2: Obtain the magnitude and phase spectra\n```python\nmagnitude = np.abs(F)\nphase = np.angle(F)\n```\n\nStep 3: Apply a low-pass filter\n```python\ndef low_pass_filter(F, radius):\n    H, W = F.shape\n    filtered_F = np.zeros_like(F)\n    cy, cx = H // 2, W // 2\n\n    for y in range(H):\n        for x in range(W):\n            if np.sqrt((y - cy) ** 2 + (x - cx) ** 2) <= radius:\n                filtered_F[y, x] = F[y, x]\n\n    return filtered_F\n\nfiltered_F = low_pass_filter(F, 100)\n```\n\nStep 4: Reconstruct the filtered image using the inverse Fourier transform\n```python\nfiltered_I = np.real(ifft2(filtered_F))\n```\n\nStep 5: Compute the mean squared error between the original and reconstructed images\n```python\ndef mean_squared_error(I1, I2):\n    return np.mean((I1 - I2) ** 2)\n\nmse = mean_squared_error(I, filtered_I)\n```\n\nNow, `mse` contains the mean squared error between the original image `I` and the reconstructed filtered image `filtered_I`."
