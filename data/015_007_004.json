(Hint: Start with x_0 = 0.5 and iterate the function until the sequence becomes chaotic.)",
    "message_2": "To find the first value of x that leads to chaotic behavior in the logistic map, we will iterate the function with r = 3.6 and x_0 = 0.5 until we observe chaotic behavior. \n\nThe logistic map function is given by: x_(n+1) = r*x_n*(1-x_n)\n\nLet's iterate the function:\n\nx_0 = 0.5\n\nx_1 = 3.6 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) = 3.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.9\n\nx_2 = 3.6 * 0.9 * (1 - 0.9) = 3.6 * 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.324\n\nx_3 = 3.6 * 0.324 * (1 - 0.324) ≈ 0.790\n\nx_4 = 3.6 * 0.790 * (1 - 0.790) ≈ 0.597\n\nx_5 = 3.6 * 0.597 * (1 - 0.597) ≈ 0.867\n\nx_6 = 3.6 * 0.867 * (1 - 0.867) ≈ 0.419\n\nAt this point, we can observe that the sequence is not converging to a fixed point or a periodic cycle, and it starts to exhibit chaotic behavior. Therefore, the first value of x that leads to chaotic behavior in the logistic map is x_6 ≈ 0.419."
