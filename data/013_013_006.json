    "message_1": "An auctioneer wants to sell an artwork to two bidders named A and B. The value of the artwork for bidder A is $300 and for bidder B is $500. The auction will be conducted as second-price sealed bid. Find the highest bid that bidder A should place to maximize their payoff.",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed bid auction, the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the second-highest bid. To maximize their payoff, bidder A should consider the highest bid they can place without overpaying for the artwork, given their valuation of $300.\n\nIf bidder A bids exactly $300, they will win the auction if bidder B bids less than $300. In this case, bidder A will pay the second-highest bid, which is bidder B's bid, and their payoff will be positive. If bidder B bids more than $300, bidder A will lose the auction, and their payoff will be zero.\n\nIf bidder A bids more than $300, they risk overpaying for the artwork if they win the auction. For example, if bidder A bids $350 and bidder B bids $320, bidder A will win the auction but pay $320, which is more than their valuation of $300. In this case, their payoff will be negative.\n\nTherefore, to maximize their payoff, bidder A should place a bid of $300. This ensures that they will not overpay for the artwork and will only win the auction if bidder B bids less than $300."
