    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = 2sin(x) + 3cos(x) on the interval [0, 2π], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(2sin(x) + 3cos(x))/dx\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 2cos(x) - 3sin(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x where f'(x) = 0:\n\n2cos(x) - 3sin(x) = 0\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1\n\nWe can rewrite the given equation as:\n\ncos(x) = (3/2)sin(x)\n\nNow, square both sides of the equation:\n\ncos^2(x) = (9/4)sin^2(x)\n\nSubstitute sin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x):\n\ncos^2(x) = (9/4)(1 - cos^2(x))\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n4cos^2(x) = 9 - 9cos^2(x)\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n13cos^2(x) = 9\n\nDivide by 13:\n\ncos^2(x) = 9/13\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\ncos(x) = ±√(9/13)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x in the interval [0, 2π] that satisfy these equations. Using the inverse cosine function, we get:\n\nx = cos^(-1)(√(9/13)) and x = cos^(-1)(-√(9/13))\n\nx ≈ 0.588 and x ≈ 2.553\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function f(x) at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval [0, 2π]:\n\nf(0) = 2sin(0) + 3cos(0) = 0 + 3 = 3\nf(0.588) ≈ 2sin(0.588) + 3cos(0.588) ≈ 3.674\nf(2.553) ≈ 2sin(2.553) + 3cos(2.553) ≈ -0.674\nf(2π) = 2sin(2π) + 3cos(2π) = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nComparing these values, we find that the maximum value of the function on the interval [0, 2π] is approximately 3.674 at x ≈ 0.588, and the minimum value is approximately -0.674 at x ≈ 2.553."
