    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set, we can use the formula for self-similar sets:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nHowever, the boundary of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is not a self-similar set, so we cannot directly apply this formula. The Mandelbrot set has a very complex structure, and its boundary has a fractal nature with a non-integer Hausdorff dimension. The exact value of the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is not known, but it is believed to be greater than 1 and less than 2."
