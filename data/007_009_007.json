    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, denoted as φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. To find the value of φ(60), we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk),\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factors of 60. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1. Therefore, the distinct prime factors are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nφ(60) = 60 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/5)\nφ(60) = 60 * (1/2) * (2/3) * (4/5)\nφ(60) = 60 * (1/3) * (4/5)\nφ(60) = 20 * 4\nφ(60) = 16\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function of 60 is 16."
