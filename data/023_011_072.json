    "message_2": "The Fourier Transform of a function f(t) is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken from -∞ to ∞, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nIn this case, f(t) = 2t + 1. Let's compute the Fourier Transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[(2t + 1) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we can split it into two separate integrals:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[2t * e^(-jωt)] dt + ∫[e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can solve each integral separately. For the first integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 2t, dv = e^(-jωt) dt\nThen, du = 2 dt, v = -1/(jω) * e^(-jωt)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫[u * dv] = u * v - ∫[v * du]\n\n∫[2t * e^(-jωt)] dt = (2t * (-1/(jω)) * e^(-jωt)) - ∫[(-1/(jω)) * e^(-jωt) * 2 dt]\n\n= -2t/(jω) * e^(-jωt) + (2/(jω)) * ∫[e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, let's solve the second integral in the original equation:\n\n∫[e^(-jωt)] dt = -1/(jω) * e^(-jωt)\n\nNow, we can combine the results:\n\nF(ω) = -2t/(jω) * e^(-jωt) + (2/(jω)) * (-1/(jω) * e^(-jωt)) + (-1/(jω) * e^(-jωt))\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral from -∞ to ∞:\n\nF(ω) = lim(a->∞, b->-∞) [-2t/(jω) * e^(-jωt) + (2/(jω)) * (-1/(jω) * e^(-jωt)) + (-1/(jω) * e^(-jωt))] evaluated from b to a\n\nHowever, the first term in the expression does not converge as t approaches ±∞. Therefore, the Fourier Transform of the function f(t) = 2t + 1 does not exist."
