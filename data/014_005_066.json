    "message_1": "Here's a problem for the math student to solve related to Digital Signatures:\n\nSuppose you have a message M of length 80 bits that needs to be securely signed using digital signature algorithm. The signer uses a hash function which produces a 256-bit hash message digest that is concatenated with the signer’s private key to produce the digital signature on M. What is the length of the digital signature and how long does it take to sign the message if the hash function runs at a speed of 2 million bits per second and the signer’s private key length is 1024 bits?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the length of the digital signature, we need to add the length of the hash message digest (256 bits) and the length of the signer's private key (1024 bits).\n\nLength of digital signature = Length of hash message digest + Length of signer's private key\nLength of digital signature = 256 bits + 1024 bits\nLength of digital signature = 1280 bits\n\nNow, let's calculate the time it takes to sign the message. First, we need to find the time it takes to hash the message M.\n\nLength of message M = 80 bits\nSpeed of hash function = 2 million bits per second = 2,000,000 bits/second\n\nTime to hash message M = (Length of message M) / (Speed of hash function)\nTime to hash message M = 80 bits / 2,000,000 bits/second\nTime to hash message M = 0.00004 seconds\n\nSince the time to concatenate the hash message digest with the signer's private key is negligible, the total time to sign the message is approximately equal to the time to hash message M.\n\nTotal time to sign the message ≈ Time to hash message M\nTotal time to sign the message ≈ 0.00004 seconds\n\nSo, the length of the digital signature is 1280 bits, and it takes approximately 0.00004 seconds to sign the message."
