    "message_1": "A plane is flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet. From the plane, the pilot spots a building on the ground that is at an angle of elevation of 35 degrees. If the distance between the plane and the building is 15,000 feet, what is the horizontal distance between the plane and the building? (Round to the nearest foot)",
    "message_2": "We can use the cosine function to find the horizontal distance between the plane and the building. Let x be the horizontal distance we want to find. We have:\n\ncos(35°) = x / 15,000\n\nTo find x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15,000:\n\nx = 15,000 * cos(35°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nx ≈ 12,283 feet\n\nSo, the horizontal distance between the plane and the building is approximately 12,283 feet."
