    "message_1": "A signal f(t) is given by: f(t) = 2sin(2πt) + 4cos(4πt) + 6cos(8πt), where t is the time in seconds. Find the amplitude and frequency of each component of the signal using Fourier Transform.",
    "message_2": "The given signal f(t) is already in the sum of sinusoids form, so we don't need to apply the Fourier Transform to find the amplitude and frequency of each component. The Fourier Transform is used to convert a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation. In this case, we can directly read the amplitude and frequency of each component from the given equation.\n\nThe signal f(t) has three components:\n\n1. A sine wave with amplitude A1 = 2 and angular frequency ω1 = 2π. To find the frequency, we can use the formula f = ω / (2π), so the frequency of this component is f1 = ω1 / (2π) = 2π / (2π) = 1 Hz.\n\n2. A cosine wave with amplitude A2 = 4 and angular frequency ω2 = 4π. The frequency of this component is f2 = ω2 / (2π) = 4π / (2π) = 2 Hz.\n\n3. A cosine wave with amplitude A3 = 6 and angular frequency ω3 = 8π. The frequency of this component is f3 = ω3 / (2π) = 8π / (2π) = 4 Hz.\n\nSo, the amplitudes and frequencies of the components are:\n\n1. Amplitude A1 = 2, Frequency f1 = 1 Hz\n2. Amplitude A2 = 4, Frequency f2 = 2 Hz\n3. Amplitude A3 = 6, Frequency f3 = 4 Hz"
