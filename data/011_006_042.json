    "message_2": "Let x be the number of Math books, y be the number of Chemistry books, and z be the number of Physics books. We have the following equation:\n\n20x + 15y + 10z = 100\n\nWe need to find all the possible non-negative integer solutions (x, y, z) for this equation.\n\nFirst, we can divide the entire equation by 5 to simplify:\n\n4x + 3y + 2z = 20\n\nNow, we can start by finding the possible values for x, y, and z that satisfy the equation:\n\n1. If x = 0:\n3y + 2z = 20\nThe possible solutions for (y, z) are (0, 10), (2, 7), (4, 4), (6, 1).\n\n2. If x = 1:\n4 + 3y + 2z = 20\n3y + 2z = 16\nThe possible solutions for (y, z) are (0, 8), (2, 5), (4, 2).\n\n3. If x = 2:\n8 + 3y + 2z = 20\n3y + 2z = 12\nThe possible solutions for (y, z) are (0, 6), (2, 3), (4, 0).\n\n4. If x = 3:\n12 + 3y + 2z = 20\n3y + 2z = 8\nThe possible solutions for (y, z) are (0, 4), (2, 1).\n\n5. If x = 4:\n16 + 3y + 2z = 20\n3y + 2z = 4\nThe possible solution for (y, z) is (0, 2).\n\n6. If x = 5 or greater, the total cost will exceed $100, so there are no more possible solutions.\n\nNow, we can count the number of different combinations of books:\n\n1. Four combinations for x = 0: (0, 0, 10), (0, 2, 7), (0, 4, 4), (0, 6, 1)\n2. Three combinations for x = 1: (1, 0, 8), (1, 2, 5), (1, 4, 2)\n3. Three combinations for x = 2: (2, 0, 6), (2, 2, 3), (2, 4, 0)\n4. Two combinations for x = 3: (3, 0, 4), (3, 2, 1)\n5. One combination for x = 4: (4, 0, 2)\n\nIn total, there are 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13 different combinations of books the student can buy using their entire budget."
