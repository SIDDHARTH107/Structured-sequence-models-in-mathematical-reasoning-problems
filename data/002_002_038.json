    "message_2": "The formula for the volume of a sphere is given by V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nGiven the radius r = 5 cm, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3)π(5^3)\nV = (4/3)π(125)\nV = (500/3)π\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume and round it to two decimal places:\n\nV ≈ (500/3) * 3.14159\nV ≈ 523.59878\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the volume of the sphere is approximately 523.60 cubic centimeters."
