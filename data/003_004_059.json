    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos(2x) = 1/2, we first need to find the angles whose cosine is 1/2.\n\ncos(θ) = 1/2\nθ = π/3, 5π/3\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\ncos(2x) = cos(θ)\n\n2x = θ + 2πn or 2x = -θ + 2πn, where n is an integer.\n\nFor θ = π/3:\n\n2x = π/3 + 2πn\nx = π/6 + πn\n\nFor θ = 5π/3:\n\n2x = 5π/3 + 2πn\nx = 5π/6 + πn\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = π/6 + πn and x = 5π/6 + πn, where n is an integer."
