    "message_1": "A student is trying to form a committee of 5 people from a group of 12 potential members. How many different ways can they select the committee if they want at least 2 men and 2 women on the committee? Use generating functions to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using generating functions, we first need to determine the number of men and women in the group of 12 potential members. Let's assume there are M men and W women in the group, where M + W = 12.\n\nWe want to form a committee with at least 2 men and 2 women. We can consider the following cases:\n\n1. 2 men and 3 women\n2. 3 men and 2 women\n\nLet's create generating functions for each case.\n\nCase 1: 2 men and 3 women\nThe generating function for selecting 2 men from M men is (C(M,2)x^2), and the generating function for selecting 3 women from W women is (C(W,3)x^3). The combined generating function for this case is (C(M,2)x^2)(C(W,3)x^3).\n\nCase 2: 3 men and 2 women\nThe generating function for selecting 3 men from M men is (C(M,3)x^3), and the generating function for selecting 2 women from W women is (C(W,2)x^2). The combined generating function for this case is (C(M,3)x^3)(C(W,2)x^2).\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of x^5 in the sum of the generating functions for both cases:\n\nx^5[(C(M,2)x^2)(C(W,3)x^3) + (C(M,3)x^3)(C(W,2)x^2)]\n\nTo find the coefficient of x^5, we can simply add the products of the coefficients of the corresponding powers of x:\n\nC(M,2)C(W,3) + C(M,3)C(W,2)\n\nNow, we need to plug in the values of M and W. Since we don't have the exact number of men and women, we can't provide a numerical answer. However, the expression C(M,2)C(W,3) + C(M,3)C(W,2) gives the number of ways to form a committee with at least 2 men and 2 women for any given values of M and W, where M + W = 12."
