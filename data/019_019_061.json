    "message_2": "To find the smallest integer n such that a binary string of length n belongs to L, we need to consider the simplest Turing machine that halts on empty input. The simplest Turing machine has two states: the initial state (q0) and the halting state (qH). The transition function for this Turing machine can be defined as:\n\nδ(q0, 0) = (qH, 0, R)\nδ(q0, 1) = (qH, 1, R)\n\nThis means that regardless of the input symbol (0 or 1), the Turing machine will immediately move to the halting state and halt.\n\nNow, we need to represent this Turing machine as a binary string. One possible encoding is as follows:\n\n1. Encode the number of states as a binary number. In this case, there are two states, so the binary representation is \"10\".\n2. Encode the transition function. For each state and input symbol pair, we encode the next state, the symbol to be written, and the direction to move. In this case, we have:\n   - δ(q0, 0) = (qH, 0, R) -> \"1 0 R\"\n   - δ(q0, 1) = (qH, 1, R) -> \"1 1 R\"\n3. Concatenate the encodings from steps 1 and 2. In this case, we get \"10 1 0 R 1 1 R\".\n\nNow, we need to represent this string using only the binary alphabet {0,1}. We can do this by encoding the direction \"R\" as \"0\" and separating the parts with \"00\". So, the final binary string is \"1000100100\".\n\nThe length of this binary string is 10, so the smallest integer n such that a binary string of length n belongs to L is 10."
