    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x^2 + y^2 = 169$, we can start by noting that $169 = 13^2$. Since $x^2$ and $y^2$ are both non-negative, we know that $x$ and $y$ must be integers between $-13$ and $13$ inclusive.\n\nNow, we can test each possible value of $x$ and see if there is a corresponding integer value of $y$ that satisfies the equation. \n\n1. If $x = -13$, then $x^2 = 169$, so $y^2 = 0$, and $y = 0$.\n2. If $x = -12$, then $x^2 = 144$, so $y^2 = 25$, and $y = \\pm 5$.\n3. If $x = -11$, then $x^2 = 121$, so $y^2 = 48$, which has no integer solutions for $y$.\n4. If $x = -10$, then $x^2 = 100$, so $y^2 = 69$, which has no integer solutions for $y$.\n5. If $x = -9$, then $x^2 = 81$, so $y^2 = 88$, which has no integer solutions for $y$.\n6. If $x = -8$, then $x^2 = 64$, so $y^2 = 105$, which has no integer solutions for $y$.\n7. If $x = -7$, then $x^2 = 49$, so $y^2 = 120$, which has no integer solutions for $y$.\n8. If $x = -6$, then $x^2 = 36$, so $y^2 = 133$, which has no integer solutions for $y$.\n9. If $x = -5$, then $x^2 = 25$, so $y^2 = 144$, and $y = \\pm 12$.\n10. If $x = -4$, then $x^2 = 16$, so $y^2 = 153$, which has no integer solutions for $y$.\n11. If $x = -3$, then $x^2 = 9$, so $y^2 = 160$, which has no integer solutions for $y$.\n12. If $x = -2$, then $x^2 = 4$, so $y^2 = 165$, which has no integer solutions for $y$.\n13. If $x = -1$, then $x^2 = 1$, so $y^2 = 168$, which has no integer solutions for $y$.\n14. If $x = 0$, then $x^2 = 0$, so $y^2 = 169$, and $y = \\pm 13$.\n\nSince the equation is symmetric with respect to $x$ and $y$, we don't need to check the positive values of $x$. The integer solutions are:\n\n$(-13, 0)$, $(-12, -5)$, $(-12, 5)$, $(-5, -12)$, $(-5, 12)$, $(0, -13)$, $(0, 13)$, $(5, -12)$, $(5, 12)$, $(12, -5)$, and $(12, 5)$."
