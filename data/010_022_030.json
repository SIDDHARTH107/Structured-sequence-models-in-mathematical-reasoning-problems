    "message_2": "Since the sphere is tangent to the plane at point P and P lies on the x-axis, the center of the sphere must be at point C(4, 0, 0) because the radius is 4 cm. The sphere is in the positive y-z quadrant, which means the plane must be parallel to the y-z plane and pass through point P.\n\nThe equation of a plane can be written in the form Ax + By + Cz = D, where A, B, and C are the coefficients of the normal vector to the plane. Since the plane is parallel to the y-z plane, the normal vector must be parallel to the x-axis. Therefore, the normal vector can be written as (1, 0, 0).\n\nNow we can write the equation of the plane as:\n\n1x + 0y + 0z = D\n\nSince the plane passes through point P, which lies on the x-axis, we can use the coordinates of P to find the value of D. Let's assume P has coordinates (4, 0, 0):\n\n1(4) + 0(0) + 0(0) = D\n4 = D\n\nSo, the equation of the plane is:\n\nx = 4"
