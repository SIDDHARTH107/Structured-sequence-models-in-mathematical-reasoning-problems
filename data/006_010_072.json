    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of a group of 100 people, at least 10 will be affected by a disease that has a prevalence rate of 5% in their demographic group?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (people affected by the disease) in n trials (100 people)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (5% or 0.05 in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (100 people)\n- k is the number of successes (10 or more people affected)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 10 people being affected, we need to calculate the probability of 10, 11, 12, ..., 100 people being affected and sum those probabilities. However, it's easier to calculate the probability of fewer than 10 people being affected (0 to 9) and subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, we will calculate the probability of 0 to 9 people being affected and then subtract the sum of those probabilities from 1:\n\nP(at least 10) = 1 - P(0) - P(1) - ... - P(9)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(at least 10) = 1 - Σ[C(100, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(100-k)] for k = 0 to 9\n\nCalculating the probabilities for each value of k and summing them up:\n\nP(at least 10) ≈ 1 - (0.005920529 + 0.031160680 + 0.081181771 + 0.139575677 + 0.178142641 + 0.180017827 + 0.150014856 + 0.106025121 + 0.064870970 + 0.034901296)\n\nP(at least 10) ≈ 1 - 0.871841358\n\nP(at least 10) ≈ 0.128158642\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 people out of 100 will be affected by the disease with a prevalence rate of 5% is approximately 12.82%."
