    "message_2": "To determine the automorphism group of G, we need to find all the permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relations in the graph. In other words, we need to find all the isomorphisms from G to itself.\n\nFirst, let's label the vertices of G as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, and v6, corresponding to the rows (and columns) of the adjacency matrix A.\n\nNow, let's analyze the degrees of the vertices:\n- deg(v1) = 2\n- deg(v2) = 3\n- deg(v3) = 3\n- deg(v4) = 3\n- deg(v5) = 3\n- deg(v6) = 2\n\nWe can see that there are two vertices of degree 2 (v1 and v6) and four vertices of degree 3 (v2, v3, v4, and v5). Any automorphism must map vertices of the same degree to each other.\n\nLet's consider the possible mappings for the vertices of degree 2:\n1. v1 -> v1 and v6 -> v6\n2. v1 -> v6 and v6 -> v1\n\nNow, let's analyze the adjacency relations between the vertices of degree 3. We can see that v2 and v5 are adjacent to both v1 and v6, while v3 and v4 are not adjacent to either v1 or v6. Therefore, any automorphism must map v2 and v5 to each other and v3 and v4 to each other.\n\nLet's consider the possible mappings for the vertices of degree 3:\n1. v2 -> v2, v3 -> v3, v4 -> v4, and v5 -> v5\n2. v2 -> v5, v3 -> v3, v4 -> v4, and v5 -> v2\n3. v2 -> v2, v3 -> v4, v4 -> v3, and v5 -> v5\n4. v2 -> v5, v3 -> v4, v4 -> v3, and v5 -> v2\n\nNow, we can combine the possible mappings for the vertices of degree 2 and degree 3 to obtain the automorphisms of G:\n\n1. Identity automorphism: (v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6) -> (v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6)\n2. (v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6) -> (v6, v5, v3, v4, v2, v1)\n3. (v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6) -> (v1, v2, v4, v3, v5, v6)\n4. (v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6) -> (v6, v5, v4, v3, v2, v1)\n\nThus, the automorphism group of G has 4 elements, which are the permutations listed above."
