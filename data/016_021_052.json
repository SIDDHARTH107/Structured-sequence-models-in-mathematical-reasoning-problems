    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is generated by repeatedly replacing the middle third of each line segment with two segments that form an equilateral triangle with the removed segment. The perimeter of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the nth iteration as P(n). The perimeter of the original triangle (n=0) is P(0) = 3 units (since it has three sides of length 1 unit each).\n\nFor the first iteration (n=1), each side of the original triangle is replaced by two segments, each of length 1/3. So, the new perimeter is P(1) = 3 * (2 * 1/3) = 2 * P(0).\n\nFor the second iteration (n=2), each side of the first iteration triangle is replaced by two segments, each of length 1/3 of the original side. So, the new perimeter is P(2) = 2 * P(1) = 2^2 * P(0).\n\nIn general, for the nth iteration, the perimeter is given by the formula:\n\nP(n) = 2^n * P(0)\n\nNow, we want to find the perimeter of the 7th iteration (n=7):\n\nP(7) = 2^7 * P(0) = 128 * 3 = 384 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 7th iteration of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve is 384 units."
