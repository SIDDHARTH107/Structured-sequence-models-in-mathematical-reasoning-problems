    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA Δ B = {x: x ∈ A or x ∈ B, but not both}\nA Δ B = {6, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, which is denoted as B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = {x: x ∈ B or x ∈ A, but not both}\nB Δ A = {3, 6}\n\nNotice that A Δ B = B Δ A, which means the symmetric difference is commutative.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A Δ B) and (B Δ A). The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = {(6, 3), (3, 6)}\n\nSince (A Δ B) x (B Δ A) = {(6, 3), (3, 6)}, we can see that the Cartesian product of the symmetric differences is also commutative."
