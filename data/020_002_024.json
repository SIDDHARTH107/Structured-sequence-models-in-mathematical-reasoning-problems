    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The total available resources are 200 units of labor and 150 units of raw material. Each unit of product A requires 2 units of labor and 3 units of raw material to manufacture, while each unit of product B requires 4 units of labor and 2 units of raw material. The company sells product A at a profit of $5 per unit and product B at a profit of $6 per unit. Determine the optimal quantities of products A and B that should be produced to maximize the total profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P = 5x + 6y, subject to the constraints given by the available resources.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Labor: 2x + 4y ≤ 200\n2. Raw material: 3x + 2y ≤ 150\n3. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 4y ≤ 200\nDivide by 2: x + 2y ≤ 100\ny ≤ -0.5x + 100\n\n2. 3x + 2y ≤ 150\ny ≤ -1.5x + 75\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both inequalities are satisfied, and x and y are non-negative.\n\nNow, we'll find the corner points of the feasible region:\n1. Intersection of y = -0.5x + 100 and y = -1.5x + 75:\n-0.5x + 100 = -1.5x + 75\nx = 25\ny = 37.5\n\n2. Intersection of y = -0.5x + 100 and x = 0:\ny = 100\n\n3. Intersection of y = -1.5x + 75 and x = 0:\ny = 75\n\n4. Intersection of y = -0.5x + 100 and y = 0:\nx = 50\n\n5. Intersection of y = -1.5x + 75 and y = 0:\nx = 30\n\nThe corner points are (0, 100), (0, 75), (25, 37.5), (50, 0), and (30, 0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P = 5x + 6y at each corner point:\n\n1. P(0, 100) = 5(0) + 6(100) = 600\n2. P(0, 75) = 5(0) + 6(75) = 450\n3. P(25, 37.5) = 5(25) + 6(37.5) = 125 + 225 = 350\n4. P(50, 0) = 5(50) + 6(0) = 250\n5. P(30, 0) = 5(30) + 6(0) = 150\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the corner point (0, 100), with a profit of $600. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 100 units of product B to maximize their total profit."
