    "message_1": "A manufacturing company makes two types of products, A and B. It takes 1 hour to produce product A and 2 hours to produce product B. The company has a total of 40 hours available for manufacturing. The profit for product A is $100 and for product B is $150. Determine the optimal number of products A and B to produce to maximize the profit for the company.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of product A and y be the number of product B.\n\nThe time constraint can be represented as:\n1x + 2y ≤ 40\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\nP(x, y) = 100x + 150y\n\nTo find the optimal number of products A and B, we can use the graphical method. First, we need to find the feasible region based on the constraint:\n\n1x + 2y ≤ 40\ny ≤ (40 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is the area under the line y = (40 - x) / 2, where x and y are non-negative integers.\n\nNow, we need to find the integer points (x, y) in the feasible region that maximize the profit function P(x, y).\n\nWe can start by finding the slope of the constraint equation:\ny = (40 - x) / 2\ndy/dx = -1/2\n\nSince the slope is negative, the profit function will be maximized at the point where the constraint line intersects the x or y axis.\n\nIntersection with x-axis (when y = 0):\n1x + 2(0) ≤ 40\nx ≤ 40\n\nIntersection with y-axis (when x = 0):\n1(0) + 2y ≤ 40\ny ≤ 20\n\nSo, the two points to consider are (40, 0) and (0, 20).\n\nNow, we can calculate the profit at these points:\n\nP(40, 0) = 100(40) + 150(0) = 4000\nP(0, 20) = 100(0) + 150(20) = 3000\n\nSince the profit at point (40, 0) is higher, the optimal number of products A and B to produce is 40 units of product A and 0 units of product B to maximize the profit for the company, which will be $4000."
