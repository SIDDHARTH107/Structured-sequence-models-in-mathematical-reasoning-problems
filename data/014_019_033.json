    "message_1": "Suppose we have a transposition cipher that uses a key of length 8. If the plaintext message is \"MATHEMATICSISFUN\" and the ciphertext message is \"SMUFNITISSAHCETAM\", what is the decryption key?",
    "message_2": "A transposition cipher rearranges the characters in the plaintext according to a specific pattern determined by the key. In this case, the key has a length of 8, which means that the plaintext is divided into blocks of 8 characters each. Let's first divide the plaintext and ciphertext messages into blocks of 8 characters:\n\nPlaintext:  MATHEMAT | ICSISFUN\nCiphertext: SMUFNITI | SSAHCETAM\n\nNow, we need to find the pattern that rearranges the characters in the plaintext blocks to obtain the ciphertext blocks. Let's label the positions in the plaintext blocks as 1-8 and try to find the corresponding positions in the ciphertext blocks:\n\nPlaintext:  M(1) A(2) T(3) H(4) E(5) M(6) A(7) T(8)\nCiphertext: S(2) M(6) U(7) F(8) N(3) I(4) T(5) I(1)\n\nPlaintext:  I(1) C(2) S(3) I(4) S(5) F(6) U(7) N(8)\nCiphertext: S(2) S(5) A(7) H(8) C(3) E(4) T(6) A(1)\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see the pattern of rearrangement is:\n\nDecryption key: 8 1 5 6 3 4 2 7\n\nThis key indicates that the first character in the ciphertext block corresponds to the 8th position in the plaintext block, the second character in the ciphertext block corresponds to the 1st position in the plaintext block, and so on."
