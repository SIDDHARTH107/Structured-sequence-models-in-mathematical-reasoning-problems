    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 101006 is divided by 11, we can use the divisibility rule for 11. The rule states that a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits at odd positions and the sum of its digits at even positions is divisible by 11.\n\nFor the number 101006:\n\nSum of digits at odd positions: 1 + 0 + 6 = 7\nSum of digits at even positions: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1\n\nDifference: 7 - 1 = 6\n\nSince 6 is not divisible by 11, 101006 is not divisible by 11. To find the remainder, we can perform the division:\n\n101006 รท 11 = 9173 with a remainder of 3.\n\nSo, the remainder when 101006 is divided by 11 is 3."
