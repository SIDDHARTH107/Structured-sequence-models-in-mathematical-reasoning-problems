    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 10 cm and one leg of 6 cm. What is the length of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the other leg, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the length of the unknown leg \"b\".\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nWe know that one leg (a) is 6 cm and the hypotenuse (c) is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n6^2 + b^2 = 10^2\n\n36 + b^2 = 100\n\nNow, we need to solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 100 - 36\nb^2 = 64\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nb = âˆš64\nb = 8\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 8 cm."
