    "message_2": "To determine the number of path-connected components of X, we can look at the zeroth cohomology group H^0(X, Z). The zeroth cohomology group is related to the number of path-connected components in the topological space.\n\nRecall that H^0(X, Z) is isomorphic to the direct sum of Z over the number of path-connected components of X. In other words, if X has k path-connected components, then H^0(X, Z) is isomorphic to Z^k.\n\nHowever, the given information is about H^2(X, Z), not H^0(X, Z). Unfortunately, knowing the second cohomology group does not directly give us information about the zeroth cohomology group or the number of path-connected components.\n\nIn general, without more information about the topological space X, we cannot determine the number of path-connected components solely from the given information about H^2(X, Z)."
