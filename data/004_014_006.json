    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid, we will use the method of cylindrical shells. The height of each cylindrical shell is the difference between the two functions, and the radius is the distance from the axis of rotation (y = -3) to the point on the curve.\n\nLet's first find the intersection points of the two curves y = x^2 and y = 4:\n\nx^2 = 4\nx = ±2\n\nSo, the region we are considering is between x = -2 and x = 2.\n\nNow, let's set up the integral for the volume using the method of cylindrical shells:\n\nV = 2π ∫[x = -2 to x = 2] (radius * height) dx\n\nThe radius is the distance from the axis of rotation (y = -3) to the point on the curve, which is (x, x^2). The distance formula is:\n\nradius = (x^2 - (-3)) = x^2 + 3\n\nThe height of the cylindrical shell is the difference between the two functions:\n\nheight = 4 - x^2\n\nNow, we can plug these into the integral:\n\nV = 2π ∫[x = -2 to x = 2] ((x^2 + 3)(4 - x^2)) dx\n\nNow, we can expand the integrand and integrate:\n\nV = 2π ∫[x = -2 to x = 2] (4x^2 + 12 - x^4 - 3x^2) dx\nV = 2π ∫[x = -2 to x = 2] (-x^4 + x^2 + 12) dx\n\nNow, integrate each term:\n\nV = 2π [-1/5x^5 + 1/3x^3 + 12x] (from -2 to 2)\n\nNow, evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds:\n\nV = 2π[(-1/5(2)^5 + 1/3(2)^3 + 12(2)) - (-1/5(-2)^5 + 1/3(-2)^3 + 12(-2))]\n\nV = 2π[(-32/5 + 8/3 + 24) - (32/5 - 8/3 - 24)]\n\nV = 2π[(-32/5 + 8/3 + 24) + (32/5 - 8/3 + 24)]\n\nV = 2π[2(-32/5 + 8/3) + 48]\n\nNow, find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\nV = 2π[2(-96/15 + 40/15) + 48]\nV = 2π[2(-56/15) + 48]\n\nNow, simplify:\n\nV = 2π[-112/15 + 48]\nV = 2π[(48*15 - 112)/15]\nV = 2π[(720 - 112)/15]\nV = 2π[608/15]\n\nNow, multiply by 2π:\n\nV = 1216π/15\n\nSo, the volume of the solid is (1216π/15) cubic units."
