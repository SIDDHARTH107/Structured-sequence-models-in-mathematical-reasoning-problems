    "message_1": "Suppose that in a company, the probability of a financial fraud occurring in a given year is 0.05. If this company has been in operation for 15 years, what is the probability that at least one financial fraud has occurred in that time period?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one financial fraud occurring in the 15-year period, we can first find the probability of no financial frauds occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no financial fraud occurring in a given year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor no financial frauds to occur in the entire 15-year period, this probability must hold true for each of the 15 years. So, the probability of no financial frauds occurring in the 15-year period is 0.95^15 ≈ 0.4633.\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least one financial fraud occurring in the 15-year period, we subtract the probability of no financial frauds occurring from 1:\n\n1 - 0.4633 ≈ 0.5367.\n\nSo, the probability that at least one financial fraud has occurred in the 15-year period is approximately 0.5367 or 53.67%."
