    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of depression, the height of the building, and the distance from the base of the building.\n\nLet h be the height of the building. We have:\n\ntan(angle of depression) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(30°) = h / 60\n\nWe know that tan(30°) = 1 / √3. So, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n1 / √3 = h / 60\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh = 60 * (1 / √3)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\n\nh = 60 * (√3 / 3)\n\nh = 20√3\n\nTherefore, the height of the building is 20√3 meters."
